god bless you and welcome tonight and if you have your bibles i'd like you to turn to two portions of scripture tonight proverbs chapter four you want to read verse 23 and also uh we want to look at second peter three we want to read verse one to twelve that's the whole year of second peter three one to twelve so at this time you want to uh look at proverbs chapter four reading verse 23. and if i were to put a title on this little exhortation tonight is guard your heart daddy heart i think i shared some things on this before but i want to bring back something again guard your heart all right so provoke 423 keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life and second peter three reading from verse one this second epistle beloved i know right unto you in both which i still pure pure minds but we have remembered that you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandment and of the apostles of the lord and savior knowing this first that they shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lusts and seeing where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation for this they willingly ident of that by the word of god the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water where i the world that then was being overflowed with water perish but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in store and reserve unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of godly men but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day the lord is not slack considering his promise as some men conquest but his long suffering to us word not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with flavored heat the earth also and the works that are there and shall be burnt up this is the verse i want to get to seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons would you to be in all holy conversation and that is holy life that is living does not talk and all holy conversation and godliness looking for and he's still under the coming of the day of god wearing the heavens being on fire shall be resolved and the elements shall melt with the food and heat may god add a blessing to his word god bless you and um good night and as you fully aware as you hear the news of more cases spiking up and up here you know a couple of weeks back when the government give us the green light have that services under conditions the question was and i was asking myself about the discipline and the order of things and i cherish the fact that as a people we could get into some kind of discipline and i hope you see discipline in a as an asset not as a binance force to bind you but as an asset to protect and to keep you because discipline is what it will take now to wash hands to wear masks to do what is required to keep yourself preserved in this hour and i want to challenge you and advise you to take any anyone as a carrier so you have to know your own protocols and what you are safeguarding and how you are managing your own day-to-day life whether you go to the grocery whether you go to the store or whatever it is if you don't have to go someplace don't go just take it easy and i want to encourage you to do that especially the seniors among us who are at greater risk uh as you are well aware that some countries have it rules than others and america is like a debacle right now is a terrible thing they reach i think 150 something thousand people have died and uh i read a report today about a man who he said he thought he was a hoax he didn't call it a pandemic he called that's condemned he didn't believe it was true and it's amazing that people could be hearing seeing watching and don't believe and of course we know this is the age of social media in which it have people i don't know what is the kicks behind it what is the boost behind it love to share false stories all kind of stories just maybe to go viral just maybe to get the clicks i don't know but there are a lot of fake news fake information and we are grateful that god sent a prophet messenger in his last day that didn't bring fake information he bring the truth and this is the truth that we are holding on to because where would we be we be tonight if we were baptist or methodist or pentecostal or whatever where would we be to understand malachi 4 behold i send you elijah the prophet before that great and terrible day of the law you know all these so-called prophets because we have a lot of profits now um or everybody calls of a prophet and who's not a prophet is a person all these great mighty men you're not hearing them much with this corner virus thing you're not hearing them much about the power that they have what they claim to have what they think they have and the whole thing is this that god promised to shake everything the world the nations countries people everything that can be seeking will be shaken and i want to quote it from the scripture itself from hebrews 12 uh verse 25 if you want to look at it if you want to look at it with me hebrews 12 25-29 says see that you refuse on him that speaketh for if they escape not or refuse him that speak on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him the speaker from heaven whose voice then shook the earth but now he had promised saying yet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more signify the removing of those things that are because of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain there we go wherefore we receive a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we serve we serve god acceptably with the reference and godly fear for our god is a consuming fire so i want you to be aware tonight that everything that can be shaken will be shaken that includes our countries nations marriages home life work life you name it government life positions powers whatever but everything that can be shaken will be shaken so we are not looking as if this is a surprise to us we are looking as this is what we have to be prepared for and we want to know what kind of people we ought to be in this kind of a scenario as but isaac said something powerful on sunday that people is not like a business as usual and i wanted to soak in a little bit tonight i want you to think about it tonight it is not business as usual for no country for no nation for no people for nobody it is not business as usual they call in things like new normal i see i think google uh is saying that the workers will work from home until next year july the whole thinking has changed the whole way people are communicating has changed and i was thinking about abraham this evening and how god gave him such a high written and i i was thinking and i'm actually worried high written for wheaton now what do you think about that abraham got a high written just for wheaton iran didn't build no city abram was looking for one abram didn't build no empire and so on like that all he did he believed god and it was imputed to him for righteousness and he waited for 25 years and i was thinking about the quotation that brown says perfection is patience waiting on god and waiting for god i know a lot of people don't like to wait waiting it takes faith to wait it takes courage to wait it takes in a strength waiting actually produces character god gave iran 25 years jesus had us to wait 18 years in silence before he stepped forward for ministry every test is connected to this thing called wheaton patience waiting on god waiting for god you said i wait till my change come if you are feet and you believe that your change will come then you are tested while waiting uh joseph joseph got vision joseph got revelation and i guess there might have been a great temptation for him to question whether the vision is true real or the vision will come to pass now if joseph knew by revelation and by experience and by dreams that god is dealing with him he's supposed to know that the vision can't lie and the vision is true but he has to wait he had to be imprisoned in egypt he had to be in jail and no power no talk no nobody to convince nobody to fellowship with to exhort them and yet the vision and the gift was there that he could see the butler being restored in the baker being hanged and so on like that and he could still wait even when he tell the butler when according to vision you are restored remember me and of course as human beings when we get up there we just forget who is down there and the butler forgot him and i guess if joseph was to be caught up in his own flesh he might be angry at that butler and he gave him a word and he will come to pass and i'll be next to pharaoh and he should have remembered me and like here care but that was not the point when you see but as i talk about above the business in the business and something like that when you see the higher picture the picture of god not not your picture not your friends or family picture but the picture of god then you could commit things into god's hand and say lord i know i don't understand this but i am trusting you when you work it out well god was still waiting because he had a time for fear to get the dream it's not a time for jesus to be ready and and you cannot uh get into that point or place before the time and the scripture even went on to say until his word came the word of the lord tried him now what do you think about that until his time came his word came the word of the lord tried him so god knows what we have to face god knows the challenges that lays ahead but we are challenged to stick close to the word stay close to oh god want us to behave and act and before i go further i want to just read this here for the brand i'm talking about love suffered long and is kind and then he said blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall seal man of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceeding glad could you do that could you rejoice when people say no man of evil against you i think we have to begin to take this and begin to apply just what you see here for my sake rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted the the prophets which will be for you here we go here's the part i want to get to the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of god's disapproval neither are bright skies and still waters signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the beloved i want you to think about that now i know it's things that you've heard before there's something new that we are sharing with you tonight the things you have heard before but i trust it become more and more real because there are some people because of what they go into presently and it may look dark it may be a shadow over your situation it may seem like doors are shutting in your face if it just seems like over your life now have dark clouds and it is just like gray skies you're not seeing no blue skies you're not seeing no sunshine and you're asking yourself what did i do wrong what did i say wrong what did i live wrong how would i have the wrong why is this happening to me here is the answer the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of god's approval neither are the bright skies and this is where people because of blessings they behave arrogant they behave proud they believe what is with me god blessed me i have this i have baptists working out it's working out there's no um whatnot but we just read here neither are the bright skies and still waters signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the beloved jesus christ his love i want you to talk think about god's love is not feel your love is not grandparents love grandchild it's not husband love wife it's not that feel your thing god's love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world i want you to think about that word so his love is elective love that is why god could save a god could save a prostitute god could bring out a drunkard god could bring out a whole monger goku deliver murderer because his love is not what they do or didn't do his love is elective love and that love is what he had before the foundation of the world that is why jesus could tell his disciples you have not chosen me i have chosen you regardless of what you did have done will do i have chosen you example the elective love that expressed to peter peter was going to unfail he said he's never his ass just to feel like weak that was one thing i see what the devil wants to do you number two you will deny me three times fights two things but yet the love was dear was elective love so regardless of peter upsets dongset's problems and situation it didn't cancel god thoughts of his election to peter so you said now how does he love us ah yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said so that's all he said so and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us of his spirit creasing us as sons how shall i prove my love to him this is proven up how shall i prove my love to him by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy i miss the trials that he in his wisdom allows to come to pass trials he in his wisdom to come to pass isn't that a beautiful thing tonight give the lord some praises for that hallelujah praise god so the scripture we read the bible said looking okay seeing that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons or he to be in all holy conversation and godliness in all holy living righteous living and applied word living i like to use that applying word living not church going membership that part is easy okay going to church you'll miss a service you go to church and say amen hallelujah praise god that is not what we're talking about now we're talking about you beginning to see the value of applying what you have heard what you read you begin to apply it just like we read something there how shall i prove my love to god by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials he and his wisdom sent our way now what if every one of us begin to accept and see every trial everything that comes our way god has arranged it and god knew before we had it it will come and that we have something in us to manage it but if you think you are not able the care manager can't take it then it reflects in your behavior because a man thinks in his heart so is he as you think so sometimes it take a change in how you think and how you process things yeah some people are positive beasts and there's some people a negative base so if you see the glass they say that glass is half empty they say that's the negative based person the other one will say the glass is half full that's the positive base person so sometimes our lives are leaning either negative or positive so when news comes or something happens the first thinking that comes in our minds and heart is something negative and that is when you are negative beast positive based person they will tend to see positivity in everything but the thing of it is god have a plan and a purpose for your life and you want to strive to enter into that plan and purpose of god so let's look at us again seeing them all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons or he to be ordered to be so this scripture here is talking about not what you have to do but what you are to be and i remember i think the sunday before i read something that you are what you are by your soul your soul which is your subconscious which is your inner being which is like your heart so the issue and we said guard your heart for out of it are the issues of life so he did not ask about what we do seeing all these things happening what to do what to do what to do what is more question of what kind of persons we ought to be or come down of of of the kind of person we are because what you are in heart or mind or spirit that is what going to live out like you heard but isaac said it abraham says i rather a man wrong in doctrine right and spirit done to be right in doctrine and wrong in spirit because you see that spirit part the hard part is more important than the knowledge part because a person of the right spirit or right heart could be led into the right doctrine but the person of the wrong spirit or wrong heart they are not leadable i know that's not a word but they cannot be led there's a block that is there so therefore let me just continue further matthew 15 if you want to have your bible matthew 15 i want to look at verse 11 and jesus was talking to disciples this is verse 11 matthew 15 if you want to search it in the bible which is great if you look at the scriptures so you have your bible between the phone or whatever now that which not that which quote into the mouth defiled a man but that rich comet out of the mount dis de ferrata man so the scribe on pharisees was contending that the cyprus is eaten without washing hands and that is bad for these scribes and pharisees that is not it's not it doesn't look good and jesus say is not what go any man that defiled let's continue then came his disciples verse 12 of matthew 15 and said unto him knows that the pharisees were offended after the hood is seen but he answered and said every plant which my heavenly father had not planted shall be rooted up let them alone they'd be blind leaders of the blind and the blind lead the blind boat shall fall into the ditch then answered peter and said unto him declare unto us this parable and jesus said he also yet without understanding do you do not understand that whatsoever entered into the mount gorge the belly and is castled into the drought but those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart and they defile the man so is not what go in is what comes out the issues are in the heart and then jesus went on to further to say for out of the heart proceed evil thoughts murders adulteries fornication tests false witness blaspheme and these are the things which defile a man but they eat with unwashing hands defileth not the man so in our truth everything comes from the heart and that's why and i heard somebody said this you cannot have the writing in your heart and live wrong and you cannot have the wrong thing in your heart and live right if you want to have a good life a blessed life start with a good heart a clean heart the bible exhort us don't overcome or try to overcome evil with evil overcome evil with good you have to see the power of good the power of light the power of truth the power of righteousness the power of god and if you stay with that it will work out right for you let's go to second corinthians chapter six and we want to read from verse 14 second corinthians chapter six foreign scripture are we gonna go through it and we're gonna go over to chapter seven and that's one verse there but we're gonna start second corinthians chapter six we want to read from verse 14. this is the lord speaking written to paul be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship about righteousness with unrighteousness so as a believer do you see yourself under righteousness because that is what you're supposed to be under righteousness so be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship had righteousness with unrighteousness what communion had light with darkness what concord had christ with bilia what part had he that believed with an infidel and what agreement at the temple of god with idols for ye are the temple of the living god so let's bring it coming at home now coming home to us coming home to you and i as god has said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people this is god said that's what he said wherefore come out from among them and be separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you and will be a father unto you and he shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty okay before we go further into seven chapter seven verse one let's go over this last line here in verse 17. let's look at 17 here first wherefore come on from among them and be separate so god calling for separation saith the lord touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you and i will be a father unto you and he shall be my sons and daughters see it the lord almighty okay so therefore you know it has this kind of superficial ambassador god and people boxing for years i have a seed and i'm just talking that kind of religious talk which what i'm going to do with this is the word here touch not the unclean thing be separate come on from among them and i will be a father unto you ye shall be my sons and daughters so god put certain conditions certain behaviors certain things he expect of us in in order for him to manifest the attribute of father and i you do this and i'll be a father to you what a father does look over his children protect his children help his children support his children and culturally children work with his children and what father does just as the natural father would be overlooking and so on that's what a father does what he says so if you're in the unclean thing that's a problem if you're not separate that's a problem if you're touching on painting that's a problem how could he receive you or he could be a father to you when you're messing up so you you have to do something about you because this thing about sanctification and um and all the hard preparation is things that that you have to do where your heart and mind is concerned now we could go across now to chapter seven and listen to what the bible says in verse one here of chapter seven having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of god now i believe that there are some things god will do and there are some things we have to do and um especially in light even of the message that was spoken have i done enough sunday tremendous and we thank god for that and you know i came home here and yesterday i keep thinking i have not done enough what more can i do and i'm thinking like if you carry that thought through on your your daily work your daily performance whether you're home whether you're a housewife whether you're a gardener farmer whatever it is it doesn't matter on the job a new study i haven't done enough it's just something more i can do is there something extra i can do in other words you know it's the same don't leave off for tomorrow what you can do today because sometimes you put it off tomorrow and tomorrow just as crazy and messed up as today was but sometimes you have a slot that you could do stuff and you know what you're headed again because this is what you want to do tomorrow you do it today and the more you have other things to do and you find yourself getting more and more topically but if you keep pushing things off what you call procrastination tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow after a while things begin to build up pile up pile up over your head it keeps building up over you and there are so much under outstanding things to be done and all you have to do is to beginners make a start start you say the first miles of doctor a journey of a thousand i start with the full step it's far thousand miles but if you make that first step you're going to get there so then the bible challenges us having therefore these promises and we could tie it in repeater that say by these promises we become partakers of his divine nature but having therefore please promise dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves that is on you tonight that isn't me tonight that is on an austenite you can't put it on nobody else you can't ask somebody to cleanse for you you can't tell the pastor clean up for me that is what is belong to the catholic church and whatnot the sprinkler holy water and the priest is here everything and you know once they preach cover you you're covered this is not that this is you here seeing the need of getting the word to apply to your own life all your temper your anger your misbehaving or your attitude you have to confront you with that and stop making excuses because the excuses is what is hidden in you you are saying my wife you are saying my husband you are saying my daughter my son my uncle my aunt my neighbor the boss the driver in front what the young man did what a young man did not do you are seeing all of that and you are not looking at you if you want the world around you to change start with you don't start blaming don't start who feeling yes this one feel this one sloppy this one this whatever it is all of us are wrong you but do you see you do you see if how you are acting and living if it is motivating and inspiring or is it bringing a depressing and uh uncomfortable atmosphere you know sometimes when people fall in depression there's like a dark cloud it's a spirit of heaviness you don't want to go off the bed they don't want to go to work it's just it's just like a bang it's like a shadow over them and god wants to exchange that heaviness for praises the garment of praise where instead of you just stayed here moping all by yourself and you're thinking that it's not going to work or it's not going to work that you can begin to praise god and shake off that darkness and shake off that heaviness i begin to bless god in advance for the breakthrough that god's going to bring to you so i want to say everything comes out of that heart god your heart and to guard your heart what obama says the mind listen carefully is the gateway to the soul the mind is an entrance a door that gets done to this heart that's why i feel good my hearing hearing word because you hear it mind intellectual feet and from here god could take an operation by the holy spirit and drop it down into your heart and then it becomes a revelation and that is the thing that is anchoring that is the thing that is holding him that is the thing to strengthen that's the thing that satan hates you to get divine revelation because jesus upon that rock you build his church now most of our faith as the prophet present to us is intellectual sorry reading we read in we believe here we believe but there's no test that that test has been if you really believe that you say you believe but when it has come it proven by your behavior you'd already believe that you say you believe god is with you all right when it has come do you acknowledge and recognize what is with you or do you misbehave and act like he's not there well when you act like he's not there you really do believe he is dear but he says but ram says when you pray and you ask god he's silent he's testing you he's watching to see your reaction you know uh we who have come down all this age in life we can look back and see where god brought us from we can look back and through challenges and different things and yet when new things come up sometimes we act the same old way that is not hard to understand or accept israel was like that they saw pharaoh plague with flies and frogs they saw they came up with a mighty hand and yet they complain they move they get vex they angry they complain water they want meat they want this and they carry on god work without him until they came to king ishmael all that behavior because you will realize the capital house your cabin knowledge in the wilderness is a journey and i am saying we are journeying to a promise that is what is about abraham whom he really studies in truth ibrahimovic airplane ibrahimovic no no big house and and have a a other super center and a big grocery and ibrahimovic a big grocery man abraham's grocery all abraham had was he believed god what god said and this is where when you believe this you believe the word i don't care what people say about you you believe that inside of here god counted that as righteousness what conquered that has a fate that you could believe him and all you do know you're waiting you're waiting on what you're waiting on the manifestation of your promise amen waited 25 years abraham i guess they were good school friends and sarah and everything else and whatnot he saw his wife getting older and older and older and older and every day it looked worse every day but god spoke and if god spoke it has to come to pass just like we read in the scripture we have received a kingdom that cannot be moved your confidence have to come into this world becoming spirit in your life and that's the kingdom or the word becoming flesh in your life that is the kingdom because once that word becomes flesh in you the invisible becomes visible whatever you say one day uh what is that what is invisible will become visible to you the holy they will become a reality to you so right now it's like you have any substance which is your fate or what you're hoping for you can't see it there's no evidence you can't show it but you have the evidence of faith what we are asking for is what you can do that expresses the fate that god put in you god is not trying to make us be like donkeys and just doing world bullwork and i just you know do no no god not trying to do that he wants that faith to become active because you see we have to work they're going to come or when we have to work because jesus there's a prophecy work while you have light because there's going to come an hour no man can work suppose this is a preview of what we come into what we're going on right now with this corner i suppose this is like a gallery this is not the actual thing but this is a preview what could we do at this point who's going on a plane to travel anyway i'm not going anywhere you can you can try to get me to go anywhere let's say for instance this is a preview of what is to come it means a way think about it now i have been traveling since 1981 that's a very long time every single year there wasn't a year i didn't travel from 1981 this year 2020 will be the first year that i will not be traveling at all i know many many thousands and most people will not be trapped okay what if traveling is over just making a point what if there is no more places to travel to and to go like before and we are in this box of time waiting on the coming of the law if that is so how shall we read what atmosphere we're going to be waiting in if there is no uh all this is preview now we're not saying this is so but what if it's something like this would you be angry would you be upset or would you rejoice and be grateful that we are getting closer and closer to the coming of the day of christ because that is what ought to be bringing a special encouragement to you this is what the gospel is about the gospel is not about killing time with the church and fellowshipping after service the whole purpose of the gospel is to introduce the fact that christ is coming and the scriptures tell us nations shall rise against nations yesterday wars rumors of wars earthquakes and and what not and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached and then shall the end come who have to preach the gospel we have to preach the gospel be brought up to preach the gospel because that's the only way the end come every time any time we can't get to the place to preach the gospel the end is is far off the end pushing you pushing back me and so if you know so so so so so that's why i saying and my son funny i know it might sound ridiculous to some people i've been saying all these years i've been waiting to preach the gospel and they might find that as a really cuckoo statement because i'm a pastor and i'm preaching i'm not talking about that i'm talking about what jesus says to do go into all the world and not read quotes not explain things preach the gospel and the only way that could be effectively done is if that quote and that would be read become flesh in us and if that comes flesh in us then we becomes we become actual channels of god to express the gospel your life become a gospel you can't help it when you go you testify you can't let a day go without testifying and sharing your faith with somebody because you've seen the value of this gospel the value of reaching out to others and getting souls of christ because one of these days the last name on that book going to come in we're going to be close you're going to be shut it'll be all over so you can sit down here in this room and tell us that the raptor will come you know it's not working not like that for the coming of the lord he has to appear among us before he comes brahm says two different words come in and appearing he has to appear even says about the seven thunders he said and when it comes manifested then you're worshiping the living christ him moving in and out in other words there will be such an atmosphere in the church that you will know christ is among us he is here he's only about that time the dead raised it's not a matter of time you know what i mean the sleeping scenes come forward through the amount of time no to get to dear that's why we're here tonight that you must guard your heart and the guard your heart you have to guard the channel that have access to your heart which is your mind what you read what you look at what you listen to what you soak in in your spirit you have to protect yourself there are some people they are not good for you not only they have spirits on them that bring depression and darkness over your life but what they speak is like blue smoke what they speak they will break the anointing of your life you have to know those people are wrong and cut them off you are scripted for that be separate because you want god bless them it's not you don't like them they themselves don't know what upon them you have to know what upon you the spirit is upon you the anointing is upon you and the spirit upon them want to cancel the spirit upon you that is what you don't understand that's what you don't know and sometimes somebody being blessed and whatnot like that and they encourage you wrong person coming to their life the wrong person come around them and next meet everything with toxic tv because a whole different vibration is coming around your life you have to be careful and that come like coronavirus right now you go wearing mask people wear hard to wear mask wash your hands and whatnot because you are in danger that virus not stick sticking on one person that progress is so dread it making sure it multiply an effect that's what it is about that why it's so dangerous that way you can't take no chances with nobody they might be nice they might be family they might be a good loved one like i told you about the man who said he thought was a hoax and he brought it in and his whole family got affected no he confessing there's no hoax well we know this gospel is no hopes god is real he actually fulfilled malachi 4 as in our prophet there's no hoax he sent a message to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers that is no hopes they had a real faith the fathers had it they manifest christ they manifest god we have to have it it has to start somewhere you have to begin i got in your heart now as all of you here in this room and as you would know over the years as a church we have not tried to bring any baccanal or confusion or what other church is doing or what is pastor doing or what is other church doing or what they're preaching on teaching and there's a reason for that by choice i try to guard the church from nonsense foolishness and weight and burdens that don't belong to them that you should not have you shouldn't be burdened by some kind of crazy teachings or stuff that some other church is doing boy you can hear what they're doing yeah what is saying yeah what are they teaching i want to have close ears i a hearing i don't want to know i want to see what the lord want us to do okay so if you want to get it right ask god to help you clean up that heart clean up your life clean up your walk and talk and then you could see the blessings of god pouring out upon you if you have your bibles look until luke chapter six this is things to apply this thing to look at closely and we want to look at verse 40. everybody in the bibles luke chapter 6 verse 40 to 49 you want to read verse 40 says the disciple is not above his master but everyone that is perfect love this shall be as his master jesus is going down now he's going down deep into behavior attitude things to apply let's hear what he said you know and why because though the mood that is in thy brother's eye but perceivers not the being that is in thy own eye you're looking at others you're finding fault with others you have issues with others but you haven't seen the issues with about you jesus is busting them he said either who is 42 how can saul say to thy brother brother let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye when doubt thyself behold is not the being that is in thy own eye and jesus nailed them he said dao hypocrite because that is hypocrisy thou hypocrite cast out first the beam out of thine own eye and then thou shall see clearly the pull out the moot that's in thy brother's eye so if we have to go forward we have to deal with some sincere soul searching and if we want to help others we have to know in what spirit that we helping others in you know the bible talk about there's no tests for temptation given to man but god with that temptation made a way of escape and the bible speaks about the spirit in which you try to get somebody to be reconciled to god be spirit the way you do it it's not just well god you're a sinner oh god how you could do that and you you know come back repent no no no no you have to understand that if it wasn't the grace of god you might have been the same condition you have to understand is god's love and mercy that has kept you and just as god listen extend grace to you you ought to extend grace to others let me listen again just as god release grace to you and put greece to your life you ought to release grace to others just as god released forgiveness to you you ought to release forgiveness to others just as god released hope and expectation to you that is what you have to be able to express to others because as he being your father he is being like the son that china is just unjust you also going to be a reflector of him that could shine on others not just dealing with people who you connect with not just dealing with people who you like or who you love who treats you favorably but you could treat all almost the same because it's in you to do good it is in you to help it is in you to bring a word of comfort it is in you and like i said this week there's some people they give respects to people who are higher up or who they they feel have a higher value that is the wrong kind of give them respects and you're not respecting this one and i can't respect that one no that is wrong you give respect because you have respect and if you have respect you could give it to the poor to be done trodden to the person who's the garbage collector it doesn't matter what position whether it's a policeman or the garbage collector you give it because you have it now many people don't have it therefore there are problems to give it so yeah how you expect so actually so that's not the point the behavior of the person is not the issue do you have respect and if you have respect it will show on your job it will show in your home it will show in the church it will show in your life you have to have it because you can give it let's continue first 43 for a good tree bring it forth a far good tree bring it not for corrupt fruit neither not a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit but every tree is known by his own fruit for of torns men do not got a figs nor bramble bush gather their grapes a good man here we go out of the good treasure of his heart bringing forth that which is good so you'll find out many people come to church there is a head and there is a heart many times they're not so connected the head shouting and saying amen the heart thinking and behaving and doing a whole different kind of thing altogether now the ideal is to get the heart and mind line up if we could get your heart and your mind line up with the word correctly then that's powerful you are almost unstoppable with your heart your mind and heart lined up most of the times your mind is thinking one thing and your heart is a different ballgame altogether so jesus is kneeling down here a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringing forth that which is good uh evil man where that treasure coming from out of the evil treasure of his heart bringing forth that which is evil for out here we go of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaking that's why you hear me talking about we want to hear what people are saying in terms of an angel come down somebody say angel a light and whatnot i don't want to say about the wings and the pictures and so on how bright he is i want to know what community is about and if there's a word or not you see so out of the abundance of the heart he might speak if in your heart of forgiveness it will show it will have love it will speak it will show it we have grace and kindness it will show it will show okay and then jesus said this here verse 46 why call me lord lord and do a lot of things which i say that's a big one you know your body lord my lord hallelujah hallelujah but when i come to the doing part this is not mysteries this is not doctrine this is not um revelations and and the book of revelation in the book of genesis and people call it viticus this is not that this is after all them books after all the revelation and mysteries and stuff this is whether or not you sincerely going to up verse 47 and here at my scenes and doing them i will show you to whom he's like so this is following up true now to doing it them do it them so it's two things and your body is that brother sunday hearing is one thing i'm doing is another here we go whosoever come into me and hear it by seeing and do with them i will show you to whom he is like he is like a man which built a house dig deep laid the foundation on a rock and when the flood rose and the stream beat vehemently upon the house and could not shake it for it was founded upon a rock now watch this scripture we read okay uh uh the shaken everything that can be shaken will be shaken so that those things can remain cannot be shaped all right now for something to be unshakeable the key part of that is the foundation and notice what jesus first said either hear it and do it or not okay he that is that a man that build a house and dig deep what he's talking about here lead a foundation on a rock so if you want to be strong if you want to be protected if you want to be effectively covered you have to have a scriptural foundation you have to have a bible foundation you have to have something solid and deep that your feet could rest on this is what jesus saying here he's like a man who built his house dig deep laid a foundation on a rock and when the flood arose now this is the part that a lot of people not expecting every work must be tried everything we build will be tried your experiences what you go through what whatever you'll be trying now as long as there's no flood the flood might take 30 years to come it might take 40 years to come the flood could represent any issue be it sickness be tumor cancer be it a loss of life a loss of a loved one we don't know but all we know the flood comes you know it reminds me of the storm and about to talk about and the winds were contrary jesus wasn't both but he wins for contrary you cannot determine when the winds around your life blows contrary in all of life there comes a time when things doesn't work out as you expect but iran call it a night time and many times as a christian there's a night time it comes to individuals it comes to home it comes to churches it's a night time where you cannot seem to find your way through one and you want to see the night and it's just like a dark time but as the bible says weeping and you're for a night but joy comes in the morning you have to believe that after this valley of depression and frustration there's a mountain to climb and it's a victory to shout about let's go at verse 49 but he didn't hear it and do it not so now you're seeing the two classes of people right here those that would hear and do and those that would hear and don't does not remind you of something else in hebrews 4 those are here the word wasn't mixed with fate so it did not profit them they were actually recent time the only hearing airing hearing the wise virgin is not heroes only the wise virgin comes into a revelation that being in possession of extra oil is what will be required to make the rapture and i always say the wise virgin appear to do extra that is where the wise virgin is different from the foolish virgins the foolish versions take for granted i'm fine always i have the books i have the tips i have some oil because i started with oil but the oil ran out so you see you cannot be arrogant you cannot be uh overconfident you cannot just know it all and and you're speaking and whatever you say no don't go there don't don't cody always have a humble attitude that you need more you want more you are crying for more you are desperate for more let's continue in verse 49 he that hear it and do it not he's like a man that without a foundation build a house upon the earth no no that house could be a prettier house that the man with the foundation one had foundation that house could be better painted that host could have better decorations better furniture and everything else it looks good but the flood had come yet the test had come here so let me just warn you a little bit don't look down on somebody who's going through their tests don't do that try to help them try to support them try to encourage them people going through rough times and tough times don't just do like if i was me i wasn't going to do it so and you don't know when your flood comes let's continue it's like a man with a house okay either hear it and do it or not like a man that without a foundation build a house upon the earth against which the stream did beat vehemently i mean i didn't really checked out the dictionary meaning vehemently but that would alone tells you is it's plenty vehement whatever whatever happens it means there's plenty blows it's plenty horse it's plenty licks it's plenty it's like wave after wave you ever sometimes that's some strong wind blowing and you ever watched the record with this thing going you hearing galvanize blowing somewhere and walk anything like that you say what right beat vehemently nothing there's not transitional it's not that it's not telling his trial this is beating vehemently and immediately it fell and the ruin of that house was great i'm almost done about two more scriptures i want to read all right have this one twice so it'll be fine titus 2 let's voice from 11 to 15 titus 2 wow and that's about it all right and just one more afternoon titus 2 i trust that this is helping you tonight i trust that this is making you rethink tonight of your response to the word in terms of how you apply it all right titus 2 reading from verse 11 for the grace of god that bringeth salvation and appear to all men teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lust we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great god and our savior jesus christ who give himself for us what's the purpose who gives himself to us like the next slide that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good wills and this is what was exhorted to titus these things speak and exhort and rebuke with all authority let no man despise so let's look again at that verse 14. jesus who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works amen so there's something god will do for us and there are some things we have to do for ourselves one of them is to cleanse ourselves one of them is to clean up our land one of them inch by inch you can take that final script we're going to read the familiar one that you know revelation 19 that's our last scripture if we find it verse 7 and 8 or last scripture this is your scripture now this is putting your name inside the dna let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife had made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be a read and find linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints i'm closing with that scripture let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and this is the emphasis there in that verse and his wife had made self-ready that doesn't apply to church members we're not talking about church members church members could do what they want but you see the wife of the lamb she is going to make herself ready by how the prophet said taking up the close of the promised word wrapping herself in the gong of the promised world taking the promises and wrapping yourself into it god you promised me the holy ghost thank you lord you promised me deliverance thank you lord you promised me a breakthrough you keep taking promise after promise you come give me freedom and knowledge and temperance and patience and you wrapping yourself in all these precious promises rapture the resurrection you're wrapping yourself up we're going to close this verse here verse 7 his wife had made itself ready it changes uh the perspective of putting everything on god you know god over gets out everything will gather for good and love god the more we call according to his purpose it changed that perspective and it bring into view something that isaac spoke about you have all the knowledge but you're not ready for the exams the syllabus i just love that reference and type the syllabus is the body of knowledge being taught to the students but the exam is honed to bring out the best out of the knowledge that you have sometimes i remember uh think maths exams and the teacher brought some much problems and they somebody shouldn't respond but still he never taught us that indirectly they were taught that but what was needed was to put together the different things that he taught to get the solution to it so the teacher is not stupid they're not going to say be a white boy or a spell boy and give you some kind of easy something there is no test if it is everybody will pass away think about that if the test is recited abc everybody going to pass as long as they reach from a to z but the test is to bring all the best that separates you from the rest that is what the test is about his wife had made herself ready that means his wife is conscious and aware that there are things that she has to do preparation is what it's all about just say but isaac said after five years somebody cannot come to you with a certificate or come to you with some kind of education five years in school i know fellas and some guys after five years they feel school was their whole life all of a sudden they're shaking to come to the office to find out what their results are they realize that their school life now is coming to a close the life ahead of them is uncertain they play the fool they make jokes the kicks they laugh and all of a sudden it's all over and i'm thinking to myself one day there'll be a last woman one day there'll be a last special one day there'll be a final gathering it'll be over it will be done let's bow heads for the prayer almighty god i thank you tonight for this time of fellowship with your children and they are so patient and they listening and i certainly appreciate the fact that they will take this time out to be with us tonight to hear what we have to share and it's concerning their own heart lord i believe in my heart that you saw something in them that's why you called them you said no man can come except the father draw lord you call us not because we were nice and clean and whole and well but we were undone we were naked we were wretched we were miserable we were in sin but you call us not to leave us in sin or leave us in iniquity or leave us in on penis or filthiness but you call us to clean us up and we thank you father that this word of sanctification of cleansing as a labor in part like root laboring in the field father god we thank you you said who you justified you had already glorified and the scripture has did not identify the working in between justification and glorification that scripture that part in between is the sanctification or the laboring part of the stretching part the striving part the pushing part we receive faith and revelation and we press and push and strain and labor to press towards charity which is the rest we press towards god's rest father tonight i pray that this broken up lesson tonight if you could piece it together in their hearts would bring lord a real uh a vision to them that you call us to glory and virtue not the slapness looseness negligence laziness neglect and not having a prayer life you call us to glory and virtue by these very promises father millions were lost when we were saved millions were when when you call us you you choose us as your own to reveal to us this lasting message father made the people take it to heart bless them tonight bless their homes and their family god may they have confidence that every activity that not of you every demonic activity oppression depression whatever sent by the enemy will have to go would have to leave even now we plea your blood tonight i pray a blessed service tomorrow night god may be with us father and bless the believers father god may they have a real revival on your word tonight with that final scripture that we read his wife had made himself ready made it meditate on these things lord and saying like that song is saying i want to be ready to walk in jerusalem just like john we want to be ready for ready for what's coming ready to deal with every challenge and issue and to know that we can still conduct ourselves with joy that and amidst the trials you and your wisdom sent our way to show that we love you and when you told your prophet pick up his pen and write you said those and the bride will love him they will be in his very image oh we thank you for loving us for first loving us and caring for us to release such a bloody message to us dripping with blood with forgiveness with restoration with reconciliation and we thank you for your mercy tonight and give us this opportunity to come around your word be with your people father in jesus name i ask it amen and amen god bless you thanks again for coming i wish i could see shake one of their hands but god bless you love you praise the lord amen so god be with you thanks again for coming with us
