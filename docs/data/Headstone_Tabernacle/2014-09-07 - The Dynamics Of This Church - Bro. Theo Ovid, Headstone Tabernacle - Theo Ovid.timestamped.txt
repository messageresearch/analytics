[11:47] and uh
[11:49] that's what we're here for to enter into
[11:51] his presence
[11:52] so we're here for to enter into his
[11:54] presence it was debt to go in in the old
[11:57] testament
[11:59] now his debt to be outside
[12:01] his presence
[12:03] so his presence is evidence that his
[12:05] blood is among us
[12:07] because it's true the blood you have
[12:09] access to his spirit
[12:12] blood is what produces pardon
[12:14] blood is what produces forgiveness
[12:17] blood is what produces that opportunity
[12:20] for god's mercy his blood
[12:22] his shown israeli a judgment seat
[12:25] it's a mercy seat because there's blood
[12:27] on it
[12:28] blood is what makes it to mercy
[12:31] once there is blood on that seat there
[12:33] is mercy
[12:35] oh we thank god for the blood out of the
[12:38] blood this morning we didn't stand a
[12:40] chance
[12:41] without the blood this morning i
[12:42] couldn't even be here
[12:44] it's only because of the blood
[12:46] and we could stand and speak to you
[12:48] it's only because of the blood you can
[12:50] come and hear the word of god
[12:52] nothing you have done nothing i have
[12:54] done but for the grace of god
[12:57] where would i be this morning
[13:00] but for the grace of god
[13:02] oh hallelujah how a great light shine
[13:05] into our hearts
[13:06] oh praise god we were lost and undone
[13:08] we prayed we were wretched and miserable
[13:10] and poor and blind and didn't even know
[13:13] it but evening light began to shine
[13:16] praise god we are here because of the
[13:18] light
[13:19] praise go to evening light
[13:21] bible prophecy gross darkness cover the
[13:23] earth but god sent a little light
[13:26] that we could stand up
[13:28] that we could worship
[13:30] that we could give god glory oh you love
[13:32] him this morning
[13:35] hallelujah you got to know that you love
[13:36] him
[13:38] hallelujah
[13:40] so this morning
[13:41] our title the dynamics of this church
[13:44] that's the title this morning the
[13:45] dynamics of this church
[13:47] i have an inspiration
[13:49] there must be a manifestation of
[13:52] brotherly kindness
[13:54] before
[13:55] the outpouring of dynamics
[13:57] that's my inspiration this morning there
[13:59] must be
[14:00] a manifestation of brotherly kindness
[14:03] before the old porn
[14:04] of dynamics
[14:06] so we want to go straight into the word
[14:08] this morning amen
[14:14] brother branham so i'll be running and
[14:17] if i even though don't quality title the
[14:19] message you know it's it's in the word
[14:21] but this is something is anything too
[14:23] hard for the lord he was talking about
[14:26] uh otherwise the sodom oh god help we
[14:29] help help help us to wake up
[14:32] the day of physician is here
[14:34] you say god doesn't send angels anymore
[14:37] the holy spirit is that angel the holy
[14:39] spirit is that person
[14:41] jesus said when he
[14:43] the holy ghost when he comes he will do
[14:46] the works that he did and he'd be with
[14:48] us even in us and he would bring things
[14:51] to our remembrance and would show us
[14:53] things to come
[14:55] now from why i'm against organized
[14:56] religion now this angel of light
[15:00] to the loud eastern church age
[15:02] rejected christ on his word for dogma
[15:04] and put him outside he stood at the door
[15:06] knocking trying to could you imagine
[15:08] that christ kicked out of his own church
[15:11] christ on the outside of people singing
[15:13] in the church singing specials in the
[15:15] church preaching in the church and he's
[15:16] outside his own church but watch the
[15:19] church age has rejected christ and
[15:21] christ is the word
[15:24] it's the word that was rejected could
[15:26] somebody say amen
[15:28] and he was on the outside the only
[15:30] church age that we have christ on the
[15:33] outside knocking trying to get in and
[15:35] this angel message
[15:37] messenger come from god was echoing his
[15:40] message on the earth to come out of
[15:41] babylon come out of organization the
[15:44] holy spirit today here we go the holy
[15:46] spirit today the manifestation of the
[15:49] holy spirit
[15:50] watch is that angel trying to get the
[15:55] people back to the world
[15:57] because the holy spirit will only
[15:59] vindicate the word
[16:01] so the first thing when the holy spirit
[16:03] comes is to get the people on the word
[16:05] because he didn't come to just bless you
[16:07] he come to vindicate his own word
[16:10] so if you want to really seal you you
[16:12] have to seal your first with the word
[16:14] with the revelation and then the spirit
[16:16] come behind that word in you
[16:18] then you are filled with power filled
[16:20] with this presence isn't that right
[16:22] because the holy spirit will only
[16:24] vindicate the word it can't vindicate
[16:26] dogmas there is no life in them
[16:29] isn't that right
[16:30] so therefore as paul tell us in
[16:33] ephesians to put on the whole armor of
[16:35] god is not right and we know what that
[16:37] alma is that allah is the baptism of the
[16:39] holy ghost
[16:40] isn't that right and there's we have a
[16:42] promise of power which is dynamics to
[16:45] come isn't that right to release virtue
[16:48] power for service which is dunamis is
[16:51] the word called isn't that right and
[16:53] that virtue power is that the sons of
[16:56] god can be formed into the word image
[17:00] oh praise god how many understand that
[17:02] now
[17:02] oh sometimes you give an easy reference
[17:04] like material you can have sand and
[17:06] gravel and cement and galvanized that's
[17:09] just materials but then when you take it
[17:12] and you build a building with it that's
[17:14] a building you take the material and you
[17:16] form a building out of the very
[17:17] materials so you could leave the
[17:19] material there you could leave the
[17:20] gravel there you could leave the cement
[17:21] there but you could take the bricks and
[17:23] put it together and form a building well
[17:25] what i'm saying the material is in the
[17:27] word
[17:28] but there's an image to be formed
[17:30] there's an image and that's the image
[17:31] right there
[17:33] faith and virtue and knowledge that has
[17:34] to be formed in you how many understand
[17:36] that now
[17:38] that has to be actually formed in you
[17:40] you can't just think it you can't just
[17:42] will it it's got to be formed in you
[17:44] isn't that right
[17:46] oh blessed be name of the lord and
[17:48] second peter 1 3 the bible said
[17:50] according as his divine power has given
[17:54] unto us all things pertaining to life
[17:57] and godliness through the knowledge of
[18:00] him that has called us to glory and
[18:02] virtue
[18:03] oh hallelujah so it's divine power
[18:05] not human power not intellectual power
[18:09] but divine power and that word in the
[18:11] greek means dunamis it means inherent
[18:14] power it means power
[18:17] being able to reproduce itself
[18:20] and that's where you get the word dynamo
[18:22] from
[18:22] it could turn and reproduce itself and
[18:26] that is where i get dynamics so in other
[18:28] words god wants to make you into a
[18:30] little dynamo
[18:31] a little powerhouse that you don't have
[18:33] to get charged up from anything
[18:36] you're going to have your own power
[18:38] a self-sustaining power
[18:41] a self-regenerating power
[18:44] jesus said in his way he that believeth
[18:46] on me as the scripture had said out of
[18:49] his belly shall flow rivers of living
[18:52] water
[18:54] it's the same thing he's talking about
[18:56] he is talking about something on the
[18:58] inside
[19:00] that have power to regenerate itself
[19:03] hallelujah are you talking about you
[19:05] shall receive power
[19:07] oh hallelujah not just upon your
[19:09] shoulder not just upon your life but
[19:12] inside power
[19:14] internal power
[19:15] power to reproduce itself
[19:18] all have power to reproduce itself
[19:22] when you're feeling down when you're
[19:24] feeling low it's a power to reproduce
[19:27] itself
[19:29] that power gonna be in you
[19:31] it's a promise
[19:32] it's the promise of the father he said
[19:35] behold i send the promise
[19:37] of my father upon you
[19:40] oh hallelujah man didn't make that
[19:44] promise man didn't release that promise
[19:47] god himself
[19:49] god himself
[19:51] god himself
[19:53] i send you the promise of the father
[19:59] oh
[20:01] hallelujah hallelujah
[20:03] glory
[20:04] so we want to hone in
[20:06] to your promise for the hour
[20:09] that you are to receive power
[20:11] personally
[20:13] hallelujah you have to receive power
[20:16] a personal
[20:19] personal portion of power
[20:22] your own liquor fire
[20:24] or your own little fire
[20:28] not the pastor's lick
[20:29] not the eldest lick
[20:31] not the church lick but your own lake of
[20:34] fire
[20:37] it's your promise this morning
[20:41] how many believe that
[20:42] hallelujah
[20:44] divine power
[20:46] which
[20:48] given us all things of life and
[20:50] godliness
[20:51] through the knowledge proper knowledge
[20:53] isn't that right
[20:54] so the only way in all words the only
[20:56] way
[20:58] we going to see adopted sons
[21:00] in this on this earth
[21:03] dynamics
[21:04] have to come
[21:06] power have to come
[21:08] to start the sun's rolling
[21:10] hallelujah into the pace of trying
[21:14] to be formed into the wild image
[21:17] hallelujah hallelujah i will say it
[21:19] again
[21:20] because jesus
[21:22] was the example son
[21:25] i say it this way jesus was the example
[21:29] seed sun
[21:30] he was the example
[21:32] he is the plum line
[21:34] he is the measuring rod and when he
[21:37] received his power
[21:39] on the bank of the river the spirit
[21:42] led him immediately into the wilderness
[21:46] to be tempted to be tested he received
[21:50] power
[21:51] power not to post
[21:53] power not to say i'm right you are wrong
[21:55] he received power that he could learn
[21:58] how to overcome himself
[22:00] that's correct power
[22:02] power to overcome yourself
[22:05] power to say the right thing
[22:07] power to control your tongue it is
[22:10] written it is written it is written and
[22:14] it is also written
[22:16] oh hallelujah
[22:23] hallelujah
[22:25] that's the ministry of christ
[22:28] isn't that right
[22:29] and we want to see now from the
[22:31] scriptures
[22:32] the ministry of christ
[22:35] the effect of it
[22:37] what is
[22:38] promised and i'm going to read these
[22:40] scriptures
[22:42] how we're going to see
[22:44] i know
[22:46] christ's ministry
[22:48] back on the earth
[22:50] among
[22:51] his people
[22:52] scripture mark 5 30 and jesus
[22:56] immediately knowing in himself
[22:59] that virtue had gone out of him turned
[23:02] him about in the presence said who touch
[23:05] my clothes
[23:06] that's christ virtue
[23:09] flew in
[23:10] virtue coming out luke 6 19 and the
[23:14] whole multitude sought to touch him for
[23:17] there went virtue
[23:19] out of him and heal them all
[23:23] who is that that's jesus
[23:25] that's the effect
[23:27] of power
[23:28] ministry of christ
[23:30] luke 8 46 and jesus said somebody had
[23:34] touched me for i perceive that virtue is
[23:36] going out of me isn't that right
[23:39] that virtue is power isn't that right
[23:42] hallelujah
[23:43] praise the name of the lord
[23:45] luke 6 19 and all the crowd sought to
[23:48] touch him for a power went out from him
[23:51] and healed them all he had it he could
[23:54] release it he had it he could give it he
[23:58] had it it could flow from him we are not
[24:00] talking about a sermon we're not talking
[24:03] about a teaching we are not talking
[24:05] about a message we're talking about his
[24:07] spirit we're talking about all that was
[24:10] in god he poured into christ all that is
[24:13] in christ he pours into the church and

[25:25] turn on the little thing and there it
[25:27] was the car started
[25:30] and he turned around and said who are
[25:31] you you know who he was
[25:33] he was the chief engineer in general
[25:35] motors
[25:36] he designed the thing
[25:42] so when that mechanic feeling wrong
[25:44] feeling wrong and he can't get it
[25:45] started a man come and say do that
[25:47] do that do that
[25:50] who is he the chief engineer
[25:52] he's the man that designed the thing
[25:54] he know to fix it
[25:57] he know to correct it
[25:59] he know to get it started and we gonna
[26:01] get something started he said if they
[26:04] could only get started
[26:06] god will do the rest
[26:08] oh that breathing of the lord
[26:11] praise god you maybe see that he's in
[26:13] this hour brother
[26:15] when we wonder what's the matter with
[26:17] our revival
[26:18] what's the matter we got the material we
[26:20] got the mechanics but where is the
[26:22] dynamics and that's what we need to move
[26:26] jesus christ on the scene
[26:28] what's the matter i'm telling you there
[26:30] is one here today
[26:32] called the holy ghost
[26:33] that can touch the dynamics
[26:35] he is the dynamics of the mechanics are
[26:39] you hearing it
[26:41] he is the dynamics who is he the holy
[26:44] ghost
[26:45] isn't that right we stand today as
[26:47] pentecostals one of the greatest
[26:49] churches in the nation
[26:50] thousand-time thousands added each year
[26:53] but where is the holy ghost
[26:55] he said we have except speaking in
[26:57] tongues we we see how we acted and
[27:00] shouted and fought but it's the word
[27:03] it's the word turn on the light
[27:07] turns on the mechanics and they become
[27:10] dynamics
[27:11] they are dynamics
[27:13] when the dynamic comfort mechanic it
[27:15] start the thing rolling
[27:17] so all what we scratching up with and
[27:19] struggling with we want to get it
[27:22] rolling but it will take dynamics
[27:25] and we have a promise this church have a
[27:27] promise
[27:28] the dynamics of this church
[27:30] we don't know about other churches but
[27:32] we're talking about this church
[27:34] we have a promise from god
[27:36] and we have to look for it
[27:38] we have to expect it we have to press
[27:41] towards it we have to emphasize it
[27:44] we have to push and focus on it this is
[27:48] our promise
[27:49] oh blessed be of the lord
[27:52] so take the word
[27:54] if there is one little thing messed up
[27:56] it won't start
[27:57] you have a nice car
[28:00] the seat's nice
[28:02] the paint job nice
[28:05] the rims looking very nice
[28:07] you have a nice number plate
[28:13] the air conditioner is supposed to be
[28:14] working but the car cast that
[28:18] so all you have there is just
[28:20] a nice
[28:22] looking mechanic
[28:24] that can't go anywhere
[28:28] you can tell the people that might kind
[28:29] of know
[28:30] let's go no i can't go anywhere can't
[28:32] start
[28:34] you might as well get a bicycle
[28:37] you always might get something else why
[28:39] you need dynamics
[28:42] to get it going
[28:43] so but the branham says if there's one
[28:45] little thing missed up it won't stop lay
[28:47] aside every weight every ism every creed
[28:50] that the dynamics the holy spirit
[28:54] might flow through the world
[28:57] and vindicate the word promise for this
[29:01] day
[29:02] then the great church of god will rise
[29:05] like a feet like a jet propelled plane
[29:07] and take off to the skies to meet her
[29:10] master oh blessed be the name of the
[29:12] lord
[29:13] praise god
[29:15] i've heard by now i see talking about
[29:16] job he said no they had job had no
[29:19] scripture
[29:21] so he had us to wait for the inspiration
[29:23] amen and then he knew by when the
[29:26] israelites strike him he knowed what
[29:28] would happen
[29:29] listen as we go forward
[29:32] that's the church if it's in order set
[29:34] in order it's got the mechanics ready it
[29:37] only need them dynamics tonight here we
[29:39] go
[29:40] if we will get the mechanics ready
[29:43] first thing he said get our hearts right
[29:48] the things that we can do oh brother
[29:50] ovid you mean the mechanics is the thing
[29:52] that we can do yes
[29:55] because you cannot produce dynamics
[30:01] i read it again
[30:03] now watch if we will get the mechanics
[30:06] ready
[30:08] get our hearts
[30:10] right
[30:11] the things that we can do
[30:14] follow every word
[30:16] follow him baptism
[30:17] follow him in every order he told us to
[30:19] do
[30:20] get every mechanic ready and stand there
[30:24] then we are ready for dynamics
[30:26] to be lit off
[30:28] and only god can do that
[30:33] because god himself made the promise
[30:36] only god could do that
[30:38] watch watch watch and that's to drop
[30:40] into your heart that faith that say i am
[30:42] on you
[30:46] so therefore what power do you have
[30:47] right now your power right now this
[30:50] morning to forgive
[30:53] you
[30:56] you don't need dynamics for that
[30:58] your power to repent
[31:02] your power this morning say i am sorry
[31:04] please forgive me you are probably to do
[31:05] that
[31:07] you are part of worship

[31:35] you have power to do that
[31:37] hell god doesn't want to wake up early

[31:53] oh you could walk in under expectation
[31:55] today is my day today gonna be a special
[31:57] day why today gonna be special because i
[31:59] say so
[32:01] and i believe so
[32:02] and i'm expecting it to be so
[32:05] you speak your expectation

[32:08] garment
[32:09] i want to be healed today i'm struggling
[32:12] but i want to be healed today i want to
[32:14] be delivered today
[32:16] i want to meet them today i want to get
[32:18] in contact with the pillar of fire today
[32:21] i want a brand new experience today
[32:23] now it is
[32:28] you have power to respect each other
[32:30] oh blessed being of the lord but abraham
[32:33] said it's your approach
[32:35] it's the attitude of what it takes and
[32:37] that is what it is tonight dear friend
[32:39] it takes the attitude we are and believe
[32:42] we are in the presence of jesus christ
[32:45] but it's your attitude that brings the
[32:46] results
[32:48] you want results well here's the answer
[32:50] it's your attitude that brings the
[32:52] results the mechanics is here and so is
[32:56] the dynamics if you can only get started
[32:59] god will do the rest
[33:01] oh hallelujah as we say i think some
[33:04] servants are back if the dove is coming
[33:06] for the lamb
[33:08] and the dove coming on his way down
[33:10] the dog look down and see wait is a wolf
[33:14] the dog have to put in reverse gear
[33:16] and just fly off
[33:18] and wait until you see
[33:20] lamb like nature
[33:22] so when you have your wool fish behavior
[33:24] the government is still wait wait until
[33:26] you cool down
[33:27] or wait until you behave yourself and
[33:30] wait until you want to get in the spirit
[33:31] one more time
[33:33] take me back to where i first receive
[33:35] you
[33:37] hallelujah hallelujah waited i'll wait
[33:39] until you come back till tears that come
[33:41] on your eyes you're thanking god for his
[33:43] love thanking god for his grace some
[33:46] people doing like they and god are
[33:47] partners
[33:49] and god going down the road with them
[33:51] that's not how he operates friends
[33:53] hallelujah if you're not flirting and
[33:55] full and wrong god gonna be with you
[33:57] until you go to fool around again
[33:59] then he has to pull off
[34:01] and wait till you repent wait till you
[34:03] make things right wait till you begin to
[34:05] set things in order isn't that right
[34:08] oh he didn't spare his children he
[34:10] didn't spare the children of israel when
[34:11] they misbehave some king of babylon took
[34:13] them into captivity until they cry and
[34:16] weep and veil and mourn when i remember
[34:18] zion when i remember my hometown when i
[34:21] remember where i was from we got the
[34:23] enemies to come and take them out from
[34:25] their land and take them off from their
[34:26] family and their country and they call
[34:29] it the slavery what a terrible thing
[34:31] slavery is rip you off from your country
[34:33] rip you off from your family rip you off
[34:35] into slavery and when the people begin
[34:37] to weep and cry and mourn god come back
[34:40] and punish the king of babylon let my
[34:42] people go release them
[34:46] oh hallelujah god is jealous for his
[34:50] people he hates to see them bowl oh
[34:52] glory to god sit down a minute praise
[34:55] god by the grace of you you'll be seated
[34:57] hallelujah but when his people are
[34:59] trapped
[35:02] can't just bring them out like that
[35:04] there has to be a first
[35:06] they had to be a a weeping in the
[35:08] morning
[35:09] look daniel daniel was crying out to god
[35:11] forgive us forgive your people we have
[35:13] we have come against your prophets we
[35:15] have sinned we have done wickedly and
[35:17] daniel began to seek the lord not only
[35:20] on his behalf but on behalf of god's
[35:22] people daniel had a burden because he
[35:25] saw that time was cutting it close and
[35:27] he wanted to get a revelation of
[35:29] homeless time is left and while he was
[35:32] seeking god angel gabriel fighting
[35:35] spirits in the spirit realm because he
[35:38] want to bring a message to daniel so if
[35:41] you think that things just normal and
[35:43] quiet
[35:44] in the spirit realm you are wrong
[35:46] there's a battle going on and i expected
[35:49] a battle this morning because of what
[35:51] god gave me to preach to you this
[35:53] morning i have a word message this
[35:56] morning and this evening praise god
[35:58] hallelujah and the devil's supposed to
[36:00] fight it praise god because this is your
[36:03] promise this is coming along to the real
[36:05] thing
[36:06] glory to god this is not no appetizer
[36:09] this is the promise itself
[36:11] this is the promise of your father
[36:14] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[36:17] glory to god
[36:19] glory to god
[36:21] you may be seated
[36:23] you see many of you walking here
[36:24] ordinary walk in here with no burden no
[36:27] burden to worship nobody to pray no
[36:30] burden to participate yeah no button to
[36:32] see nothing happen inside of here you
[36:33] come because you have no other place to
[36:35] go you come because it's sunday morning
[36:37] you come because you don't want to look
[36:38] like you're backslidden you come because
[36:40] you don't want to be able to think you
[36:41] miss service forget about to stay home
[36:43] when you come come on expectation when
[36:45] you come come for revival when you come
[36:48] come for manifestation when you come
[36:50] come on the expectation
[36:59] i can't just come to church and just say
[37:01] i'm gonna just say things and talk
[37:03] things and just waste your time i can't
[37:06] do that
[37:08] hallelujah hallelujah
[37:10] oh glory i have a sick i have to seek
[37:12] the lord
[37:13] to ask what god once spoke to his people
[37:16] hallelujah and i want you to have that
[37:18] same dedication and you come into church
[37:20] hallelujah god and a prophet a mighty
[37:23] elijah prophet
[37:25] because he had a whole world
[37:27] to bring a message to
[37:29] he sent that prophet to all kind of
[37:31] tests and trials to qualify him
[37:34] hallelujah to get that book from the
[37:37] mighty angel
[37:39] know that that book is on the earth
[37:41] people taking it for granted they're not
[37:43] even reading the book
[37:45] but you are the words of the book
[37:59] the holy ghost
[38:00] will always point to the word if it
[38:04] points to a creed or denomination it is
[38:07] not the holy ghost
[38:12] he couldn't do that
[38:14] point away from the word he died
[38:17] to confirm that word and make that word
[38:21] positive
[38:26] that's the purpose he's dying
[38:28] with his purpose of dying that he could
[38:31] still project
[38:33] what himself
[38:36] through his church
[38:38] i'll say it again the purpose of christ
[38:40] dying was that he could project himself
[38:43] not
[38:44] church self
[38:47] not man's self
[38:50] himself
[38:51] through
[38:52] his church
[38:54] and make every word
[38:57] through every age act exactly
[39:00] like it's supposed to act
[39:03] he is the dynamics of the mechanics
[39:05] the mechanics of the church what is it
[39:08] apostles
[39:09] prophets
[39:11] teachers and so forth
[39:13] he is the dynamics that works that
[39:16] so buddha branham
[39:18] taking his
[39:19] prophetic
[39:21] binoculars
[39:23] or equipment
[39:24] he break down mechanics to bring in a
[39:27] faithful ministry
[39:29] that going to become
[39:31] watch
[39:32] not the words i'm saying that going to
[39:34] become god's mechanics on the earth
[39:40] hallelujah
[39:42] that going to be activated
[39:45] by dynamics
[39:48] remember you give the reference of a
[39:49] cell phone you can buy a cell phone it's
[39:51] not activated it's a nice cell phone
[39:53] it's the best cell phone but it's not
[39:55] activated you can't call anybody with
[39:56] that
[39:57] it still have to be activated
[40:00] when in like manner the sons of god have
[40:02] to be activated
[40:04] so when you get activated you could call
[40:08] and he could call it
[40:10] he could tell you where to go
[40:12] when to go
[40:13] you'll have a direct line
[40:17] you don't have to ask anybody permission
[40:19] to love
[40:23] you don't have to anybody help who to
[40:24] forgive
[40:26] if this one's forgiven that one you
[40:28] don't have to ask anybody you have a
[40:30] clear line
[40:32] you have a direct flow
[40:34] you have a direct hook up
[40:39] and this is a wireless connection
[40:42] hallelujah connected to anybody
[40:45] this is you and your father this is you
[40:48] and your god
[40:50] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[40:53] notice what jesus told them
[40:56] behold
[40:58] i sent
[40:59] the promise
[41:01] of my father upon you
[41:03] oh
[41:04] hallelujah oh glory glory glory
[41:08] so it's worked by a certain dynamic
[41:10] which is the fire he is the fire
[41:13] so and that's in the combustion chamber
[41:16] and the gas is the word is poured in the
[41:19] combustion chamber and he's the one that
[41:22] sets her on fire so what god is doing
[41:24] right now is filling you up with
[41:26] gasoline the gasoline is the word
[41:29] hallelujah praise god you're going to
[41:31] get gas up this morning
[41:33] oh hallelujah we have a big thing like
[41:35] get your tank full up praise god and we
[41:37] come to put that in your tank and press
[41:39] squeeze
[41:40] hallelujah on you getting full up with
[41:42] gasoline oh glory to god and quarterback
[41:45] scratch the match put it on fire glory
[41:48] that god not that my god you see what
[41:50] happened in the devils now
[41:52] there was not a split
[41:53] they have to be gone because it's a
[41:55] different kind of fire
[41:57] the last time you saw this fire was a
[41:58] long time but fire coming back holy
[42:02] ghost fire
[42:03] holy ghost power virtue powerful service
[42:07] i could sense it
[42:08] i could feel it
[42:10] hallelujah hallelujah praise god you may
[42:12] be seated
[42:13] oh praise him of the lord hallelujah
[42:16] somewhere you're looking weary somebody
[42:17] looking down that's all right
[42:19] fire coming for you too
[42:21] over there god some of you sick some of
[42:22] you upset that's okay

[42:31] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah it
[42:34] could be a burning fire
[42:36] this is not hell fire no no no no no i
[42:38] won this fire it have this fire and it
[42:42] has hell fire this is holy ghost fire
[42:45] it's the holy ghost and power
[42:47] keeping me alive
[42:49] keeping me alive
[42:51] keeping me alive it's the holy ghost on
[42:54] fire
[42:55] oh
[42:56] hallelujah hallelujah
[42:59] inspired songwriters give me that
[43:01] old-time religion it's the old time holy
[43:03] spirit and the devil won't go near it
[43:06] that's the reason people fear it but
[43:08] it's good enough for me
[43:10] give me that old-time religion
[43:12] all time shelter
[43:14] all-time prayer
[43:16] or time dancing
[43:19] oh time rejoicing old time hallelujah
[43:23] it was good for paul and
[43:25] it was good for paul and silas it was
[43:28] good for paul and silas and it's good
[43:30] enough for me
[43:31] give me that old time
[43:33] not this mud and writing give me that
[43:35] old time
[43:36] whole time singing
[43:38] old time praying
[43:40] old time preacher
[43:42] oh yes oh yes
[43:44] oh hallelujah hallelujah what time
[43:47] religion
[43:48] oh my god the joy bears ringing
[43:51] you don't need marijuana and pop a
[43:54] cigarette you don't need booze
[43:57] my god this thing to get your trunk
[44:00] they were in the upper room
[44:02] they were praying in his name
[44:04] and the holy ghost fell upon them
[44:07] they were walking like drunk men
[44:09] or they were staggering
[44:11] oh they had stimulation
[44:13] of revelation because of the wine upon
[44:15] their lives
[44:16] oh you may be seated oh praise god
[44:20] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[44:22] hallelujah
[44:24] hallelujah hallelujah
[44:26] it's the word
[44:28] coming alive
[44:29] the word
[44:30] being quickened in your life
[44:32] isn't that right
[44:34] you wanna be seated praise god our faith
[44:38] makes that word live that's a thunder
[44:40] that's a thunder that's a bomb
[44:43] our faith makes the world live
[44:45] so the word could be laying right there
[44:47] but the fate is what makes the world
[44:49] live
[44:50] you see lazarus was dead
[44:52] jesus heard when he was sick and jesus
[44:55] deliberately slowed on his moving gear
[44:58] so he would not arrive there when the
[45:00] man is sick jesus want to come when the
[45:04] situation is so impossible that it
[45:06] doesn't even make sense
[45:09] that's what jesus
[45:11] want to deal with
[45:12] he want to deal with what is impossible
[45:15] he didn't want to deal with what you
[45:17] can't handle
[45:18] when there is no way out where there is
[45:21] no way you want to deal with it
[45:29] so jesus
[45:30] came
[45:31] to lazarus
[45:34] a week
[45:39] not in the past right now he's dead
[45:42] officially
[45:44] buried
[45:45] toned sealed
[45:47] this is the end part of the biscuit and
[45:49] the coffee
[45:50] this is the end part of people gathering
[45:53] wearing black this is the end part of
[45:55] that
[45:55] but a sister
[45:57] who believe in resurrection she throwing
[46:00] a gear
[46:01] lord if you have been here
[46:04] i know
[46:05] my brother was not going to die
[46:08] because i know where you are
[46:10] sick don't stay
[46:12] sick
[46:14] i know where you are
[46:16] blind gonna see
[46:18] jeff's gonna hear
[46:19] sick people gonna be restored
[46:22] so i know if you had been here
[46:24] my brother wasn't gonna be where he is
[46:26] now
[46:27] shut up with a stone
[46:30] sealed up dead wrapped up
[46:33] tied up
[46:35] in back clock
[46:37] in that clock
[46:40] but even no lord
[46:42] even no
[46:44] that woman had faith
[46:46] that's a real
[46:49] that's a real powerful faith
[46:51] a man dead
[46:53] and a woman talking about even no never
[46:56] heard anybody say it before but i say
[46:58] even now
[46:59] i never know that happened like that but
[47:01] even now
[47:03] jesus said you see that faith brought
[47:05] the word
[47:06] into action
[47:08] that faith challenged the world to come
[47:11] alive
[47:12] jesus said where have you led him
[47:15] where have you led him
[47:17] we getting started here
[47:19] nothing is moving yet but i just want to
[47:22] know
[47:23] where have you laid here
[47:25] she said lord is the god
[47:28] he said i am your promise let me give
[47:30] you a promise let me give you a promise
[47:33] let me give you a promise
[47:36] i am the resurrection
[47:43] feet
[47:45] peak
[47:47] feet
[47:49] feet bring it alive
[47:50] now watch let's change the story around
[47:54] jesus
[47:55] if you had been here
[47:56] your brother had not died but we still
[47:58] have some more biscuits and coffee
[48:00] you wanted black or always milk
[48:06] and the story would have read that jesus
[48:08] drank his coffee with biscuits and then
[48:11] left jesus and lazarus is safely dead
[48:15] but there's nothing behind her
[48:17] she didn't talk about biscuits and
[48:18] coffee she don't even know
[48:21] and then because of even know and her
[48:23] fate she received a promise the promise
[48:26] was i am
[48:30] because she was talking about i know any
[48:32] resurrection coming on the rise he said
[48:34] i am not talking about that i am that
[48:35] now
[48:40] when you see me you see dynamics
[48:44] i am
[48:46] in other words christ
[48:48] you may be seated was dynamics with
[48:51] flesh on it
[48:58] that's why he said if i don't go
[49:01] that dynamics will not come
[49:05] in this form i can give it to you
[49:10] i can't release it to you
[49:12] in this way all i can give you is a
[49:14] promise
[49:15] received for the holy ghost
[49:18] i could breathe on you
[49:20] i could give you the breath of promise
[49:23] over your life
[49:26] but the father had put it in his own
[49:28] power
[49:30] your time
[49:32] and your season
[49:34] and when your time and season come
[49:39] no man could stop you
[49:42] from your blessing from your healing
[49:45] from your breakthrough
[49:47] from your deliverance
[49:49] when your time comes
[49:52] it doesn't matter what happened last
[49:54] week
[49:55] last year
[49:57] last night does that matter
[50:03] you may be seated
[50:05] that's why
[50:06] that's what i love about the lord
[50:09] he brings it present tense
[50:11] no faith is
[50:13] even now go and sin no more go and show
[50:16] yourself to the priest rise up and walk
[50:19] will you remain perfect
[50:20] he always bring in present tense he said
[50:22] how long in that condition hey
[50:33] he doesn't go that way
[50:34] he said he said he asked the man he said
[50:37] will we meet whole he's i have no man to
[50:39] put me in
[50:40] he going that 38 years
[50:42] that was not the question christ asked
[50:45] all he asked
[50:47] you said last night you're saying last
[50:48] week he didn't ask you that the question
[50:51] is do you want to be made whole
[50:53] this morning
[50:59] i'm a party goer you're going to be your
[51:01] ex party goer after this morning
[51:06] it happens
[51:10] devil just lost him you were ex
[51:14] i'm an accident oh yeah
[51:17] i was one of them high ranking sinners
[51:21] but then i get a call
[51:23] and i answer the call
[51:25] you see you have to answer the call
[51:28] hallelujah
[51:29] glory to god and now i become an
[51:32] ex-sinner
[51:35] i used to be in satan's camp
[51:37] hallelujah ex-camper
[51:40] hallelujah norway and jesus camp
[51:43] hallelujah praise god
[51:45] then you know i learned how to put on
[51:47] the boots
[51:48] and the whole armor and the helmet
[51:51] because i recognize his war
[51:53] the devil don't like to lose his members
[51:57] hallelujah every time you leave he still
[52:00] feel you belong to him
[52:02] he believes you are a runaway slave
[52:06] he is not convinced
[52:08] that you have been redeemed
[52:10] by the blood of the lamb
[52:12] so that is why he's fighting you
[52:15] to try to get you back
[52:17] but he lost the battle
[52:20] oh glory to god
[52:22] you are free this morning
[52:25] the devil lost the battle
[52:27] christ has dismissed your case
[52:34] oh
[52:35] hallelujah hallelujah
[52:37] glory to god glory to god
[52:40] glory to god
[52:42] glory
[52:44] you gonna be seated remember because we
[52:47] were born in sin shape and iniquity have
[52:49] a full nature he know he could activate
[52:52] things that activate us in the flesh
[52:55] and in the natural and in the human
[52:57] spirit he knows that because we are
[52:59] grounded by five senses
[53:01] if we lost the sixth sense in the garden
[53:04] of eden he said malachi 4 to return our
[53:07] hearts
[53:08] back to the sixth sense
[53:10] that we could open the five senses
[53:12] and dominate the five senses and conquer
[53:15] the five senses with the sixth sense of
[53:18] faith because faith knows no retreat say
[53:21] don't give up faith don't back down say
[53:25] it don't retire
[53:29] and listen say don't get old
[53:35] so you kill us inside of here you have
[53:37] no excuse
[53:48] feet
[53:50] feet don't get old
[53:52] feet don't have gray hair
[53:54] on the contrary fate up here on his
[53:56] chest
[53:58] faith always young
[54:04] samson take a jawbone of a mule
[54:06] and beat down a thousand philistines
[54:21] the power was on samsung
[54:23] but they take faith to hold their
[54:24] jawbone listen it could be a bat it
[54:27] could be an ak-47 it could be a big
[54:30] stick a big tree anything you all was
[54:32] licked
[54:39] listen
[54:41] if samsung got a federal ostrich
[54:43] he was still going to beat them down
[54:48] it was embarrassing for the soldier to
[54:50] report when the man said how much
[54:52] thousands how many people home people he
[54:54] had
[54:56] how big was the army
[54:58] man said it wasn't a dear you know
[55:00] it was him
[55:07] say stop there's a thousand of my man
[55:09] got killed you know
[55:11] got beat up here
[55:12] tell me again stop lying
[55:15] how many men
[55:19] man ben is healing shame he says samson
[55:22] he stopped calling him samson well you
[55:24] might know because samson have a rep
[55:25] already
[55:28] that's what power does
[55:30] that's what dynamic does
[55:32] that's what you see
[55:34] with a man that anointed with power
[55:37] you see evidence of that power
[55:39] someone tell them i'll come back you
[55:41] know that's a message
[55:43] no they felt the jawbone
[55:45] they saw the gate move the lion got lick
[55:49] up
[55:50] that's the power of power
[55:52] power is the talk
[55:54] you shall receive more talk
[55:56] you shall receive tracks
[55:58] you try to receive more books that's not
[56:00] the promise of the father
[56:06] there's a promise of some benevolent
[56:07] dunya don't donate i want to do any
[56:10] books here that you could read
[56:11] when you read the books and you
[56:12] recognize what your promises you want
[56:14] your promise
[56:16] oh praise the lord we go a little
[56:18] further
[56:19] so our faith makes that word live
[56:22] because christ in us is a quickener to
[56:24] the word
[56:25] how i wish the church could see that
[56:28] all arguments and strife would be over
[56:31] that would be the supreme
[56:32] court
[56:33] that would be the naught star
[56:36] that would be an absolute
[56:38] praise the name of the lord and there
[56:40] you are that's all we arrive at that's
[56:42] the big machine that's set up they got
[56:44] the mechanics talking about the united
[56:46] nations and the only thing they have to
[56:48] get is satan there with the dynamics to
[56:51] force the marking of the beast
[56:53] and she is forced down then the dynamics
[56:56] is working let me say something too
[56:58] ubc church is united nations united it's
[57:00] a united time as i said nation united
[57:03] iran and america is enemy but you know
[57:05] then united to fight
[57:07] the terrorists
[57:09] isis
[57:10] so two strange bedfellows
[57:13] coming together they have what choice do
[57:15] they have
[57:16] because these guys
[57:18] they're bad enough
[57:19] they're taking heads off
[57:21] and i mean people just leaving the house
[57:24] leaving me
[57:25] you think about that now
[57:26] are you studying if you go paint this
[57:27] year or something
[57:29] and then come in
[57:30] you're leaving paint and brush
[57:33] you're heading out
[57:34] because as either you can't vote or
[57:36] you're there you i mean you know i mean
[57:38] they let them and they put in the video
[57:40] no and on the internet they want the
[57:42] world to be terrorized they want to
[57:43] generate fear
[57:45] hallelujah and god want to generate
[57:46] faith
[57:51] what have to get somebody that he could
[57:53] get that fate activate
[57:54] all right let's go further now now watch
[57:56] i said it's a reverence and respect i
[57:58] believe that the bride of christ is
[57:59] called i believe she is sealed into the
[58:01] kingdom of god i believe the mechanics
[58:03] is here they are waiting watch
[58:06] they are waiting for the dynamics that
[58:07] will take off the earth into glory and
[58:09] the rapture i believe with all my heart
[58:11] he is the dynamics
[58:15] so how a man can release the dynamics
[58:19] when he is the dynamics
[58:22] okay i think about that now
[58:24] we must become
[58:26] members of
[58:28] his machine of his body forming
[58:30] ourselves into his image so christ is
[58:33] the dynamics he is what is promised
[58:36] when that dynamics pours out and god
[58:39] takes some adopted sons then they're
[58:42] going to have sea german the body
[58:45] then they could release
[58:47] power
[58:48] to
[58:49] other sons
[58:51] by the spoken word
[58:53] as it was supposed to be in the garden
[58:55] of eden
[58:58] in the garden of eden the sons were
[59:01] supposed to comfort by the spoken word
[59:05] but because of the fall it fell into sex
[59:09] but when jesus came he said you must be
[59:10] born again of the word
[59:13] and the spirit
[59:15] so why peter yet speak the word
[59:19] the spirit fell upon them
[59:24] that is what happened to cornelius
[59:27] here comes dynamics and mechanics
[59:29] together
[59:31] wait and spirit together and they were
[59:34] born again
[59:35] oh give the lord some praises
[59:38] and we are coming right back to that
[59:41] where the dynamics going to be back in
[59:44] the church that people could be blown by
[59:47] spoken word
[59:49] oh hallelujah
[59:51] oh here we go this is where i get this
[59:53] picture from the dynamics of this church
[59:56] and i don't believe but ibrahim was
[59:58] talking about that brown time i could
[1:00:00] say and when we say that i'm not this
[1:00:02] church we're talking about the bright
[1:00:04] church
[1:00:05] it's a universal church this is not the
[1:00:07] church really the church is upon ibili's
[1:00:09] church is a rock of revelation the
[1:00:12] church is a universal bright body the
[1:00:14] dynamics of that church this church
[1:00:16] is a refilling of the holy ghost
[1:00:18] oh hallelujah could we say amen
[1:00:21] the dynamic is what
[1:00:23] are we filling in other words that
[1:00:25] confirms that god have to start with the
[1:00:27] filling
[1:00:30] and that feeling will be virtual power
[1:00:33] for you to stack your experience to
[1:00:36] climb up
[1:00:37] and when you climb up here comes the
[1:00:39] refilling
[1:00:40] to cap the pyramid of your life
[1:00:43] oh give the lord some praises people
[1:00:46] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:00:48] this world in itself
[1:00:50] confirms
[1:00:52] virtue
[1:00:53] powerful service
[1:00:54] starts the sun's growth experience
[1:00:58] into the pyramid life
[1:01:00] that in his place of trying he could add
[1:01:03] virtue and knowledge and temperance and
[1:01:05] all out the way
[1:01:07] and then here come the cap of that
[1:01:08] pyramid the spirit itself
[1:01:11] hallelujah coming to come along upon
[1:01:13] that son
[1:01:14] in other words look at jesus the holy
[1:01:16] ghost came upon him led into the
[1:01:17] wilderness jesus great grace and
[1:01:19] knowledge and then afterwards matthew 17
[1:01:22] the holy ghost come back again upon him
[1:01:23] and say hearing him
[1:01:25] oh hallelujah adopt the son isn't that
[1:01:28] right
[1:01:28] the dynamics of this church will be
[1:01:31] refilling of the holy spirit that we
[1:01:33] have worked in a small measure while the
[1:01:36] headstone is coming down
[1:01:38] to unite with the body isn't that right
[1:01:41] and when the head and the body unites
[1:01:42] together the full
[1:01:44] power of the holy ghost would raise her
[1:01:46] up
[1:01:47] so before the headstone connects with
[1:01:49] his bride the bride will have he said
[1:01:51] from christ his spirit coming into the
[1:01:54] church headstone coming down the great
[1:01:56] magnet to magnetize the elect
[1:01:59] hallelujah
[1:02:00] yes a ufo coming for us unidentified
[1:02:03] flying object and coming to pick up his
[1:02:05] people that that flying saucer praise
[1:02:07] god your flying saucer oh hallelujah
[1:02:10] praise god a great magnet the headstone
[1:02:12] coming to those people that are
[1:02:14] magnetized with the holy ghost so the
[1:02:16] holy ghost is what keep you magnetized
[1:02:18] therefore you're got to get the holy
[1:02:20] ghost not just books not just tapes not
[1:02:22] just sharing in a word you've got to be
[1:02:25] magnetized
[1:02:26] i don't know what you ever do in school
[1:02:28] at school use a kind of rubber material
[1:02:29] until you get magnetism in it take a
[1:02:31] metal and rub it rub it rub it and
[1:02:33] afterwards you start to pick up things
[1:02:34] pick up things that's what you're
[1:02:35] talking about let the holy ghost have to
[1:02:36] rob you so periods go come you come save
[1:02:39] as you get rid of them and afterwards
[1:02:40] you start to get magnetized except they
[1:02:42] get that magnetism inside of you then
[1:02:43] you pick up virtue you pick up knowledge
[1:02:45] you pick up temperance you gotta pick up
[1:02:47] the word you're picking up the right
[1:02:48] things why you have the magnetism of the
[1:02:50] holy ghost because the holy ghost
[1:02:52] desires the word the holy ghost feeds on
[1:02:54] the word and if you get the holy ghost
[1:02:55] all you want is the word
[1:02:57] oh the word become your diet
[1:03:00] oh the word is on menu
[1:03:03] isn't that right
[1:03:04] praise god god adoption trying to place
[1:03:07] his church in position to manifest
[1:03:08] himself
[1:03:10] so we find out according to what we just
[1:03:11] read here god
[1:03:14] has the place his church in position
[1:03:18] purpose to manifest himself
[1:03:21] getting one that he can work through and
[1:03:22] say there's my spirit flowing freely i
[1:03:25] can work here
[1:03:27] notice not there's my revelations
[1:03:29] there's my teachings they are my
[1:03:30] messages there is my spirit what does
[1:03:32] that mean that means the man has become
[1:03:35] a channel of god
[1:03:37] he has nothing to hinder the flow of god
[1:03:40] in his life
[1:03:42] god doesn't flow to the head
[1:03:44] god flows through the heart
[1:03:46] prophet peace out musical doors and
[1:03:48] doors have doors at the private life
[1:03:49] doors here doors your doors are all
[1:03:51] about inside your heart you've got to
[1:03:52] open those doors to let christ come in
[1:03:54] those doors some people have said don't
[1:03:57] talk about me don't say this and don't
[1:03:58] say this and you keep it all up christ
[1:04:00] comes out of there you've got to slam
[1:04:01] all those doors open

[1:04:34] if he just make up something it won't
[1:04:35] work we have had lots of that i mean
[1:04:39] manifestation of sons of god when god
[1:04:42] manifests himself and sends him out and
[1:04:44] when he goes forward what he says is the
[1:04:46] truth and what he does is the truth what
[1:04:48] he does he manifests christ
[1:04:51] are we looking for that manifestation
[1:04:53] aren't we oh we heard nice messages over
[1:04:55] the years 30 plus years of nice messages
[1:04:57] but we're still looking for christ
[1:05:00] manifested isn't that right
[1:05:02] hallelujah not what he preached
[1:05:04] but what he's manifesting isn't that
[1:05:06] right okay here we go oh you love him

[1:05:12] oh blessed be the lord notice abram and
[1:05:14] sarah
[1:05:16] the promise of transformation by
[1:05:18] dynamics let's look at ibrahman's era
[1:05:21] stage one
[1:05:23] abraham believing
[1:05:25] by revelation the promise
[1:05:36] praise the name of the lord
[1:05:38] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:05:41] blessed be name the lord remember the
[1:05:43] bible say abram believe god
[1:05:45] are the staggering of the promise i've
[1:05:46] got you unbelief but was strong in faith
[1:05:48] given praise to god is that right
[1:05:50] so i call it stage one abraham believe
[1:05:52] them by revelation the promise
[1:05:54] stage two
[1:05:55] after believing for 25 years here comes
[1:05:58] a voice
[1:05:59] hello invale
[1:06:00] bringing back
[1:06:02] the same promise
[1:06:05] after 25 years
[1:06:06] but this time
[1:06:08] identifying the season in other words he
[1:06:11] came to abraham to tell him he is coming

[1:06:38] according to time of life
[1:06:42] stage 3 was not a man
[1:06:45] stage 3 it was dynamics
[1:06:47] stage 3 a man didn't come again
[1:06:51] so why to look for a man
[1:06:53] stage 3 was the power the spirit
[1:06:56] transforming abram and sarah
[1:06:58] oh could we worship the lord
[1:07:05] let's look at elisha

[1:07:30] so and you're doing this all right you

[1:07:40] stay at battle stay at jericho elisha
[1:07:43] overcome all of that
[1:07:45] he says i'm not staying here
[1:07:47] i am not staying here
[1:07:49] i have to move on
[1:07:51] and he's pressed on until he had a call
[1:07:54] across jordan
[1:07:56] hallelujah
[1:07:58] then when he crossed jordan he got a
[1:08:00] promise
[1:08:01] double portion if you see me go
[1:08:04] you want another portion if you see me
[1:08:05] go you gotta promise you're gonna get it
[1:08:07] if you see me go
[1:08:08] if you don't see me go you're not going
[1:08:10] to get it if you see me go it's yours
[1:08:12] hallelujah are you going to keep on
[1:08:14] watching
[1:08:14] are you going to keep focused
[1:08:16] hallelujah are you going to keep focused
[1:08:18] you got to see something
[1:08:22] oh
[1:08:23] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:08:26] now being man
[1:08:28] all the people that spoke to elisha
[1:08:31] at gigger like jericho and battle
[1:08:34] these at the school of the prophets
[1:08:36] they say you know your muscle be taken
[1:08:38] from you you say hey i know and hold
[1:08:40] your peace
[1:08:42] i will shut up don't even discourage me
[1:08:45] you can't discourage me i wouldn't allow
[1:08:48] you to discourage me i am focused
[1:08:51] i want my dynamics
[1:08:53] i want my portion
[1:08:56] i want the power of virtual power
[1:09:00] notice
[1:09:02] elisha
[1:09:03] cross jordan with elijah
[1:09:06] notice those other guys
[1:09:08] they're looking they see them both
[1:09:09] crossed and they're waiting
[1:09:11] they're waiting they're waiting to see
[1:09:13] what's coming back
[1:09:14] they're waiting to see who coming back
[1:09:16] they're waiting to see how many coming
[1:09:18] back isn't that right elisha in stage
[1:09:21] two crossed jordan
[1:09:23] hallelujah
[1:09:25] he got the rule
[1:09:26] whatever i'm calling a secondhand rule
[1:09:28] this was the room of a prophet
[1:09:30] this is a second uncle you know what
[1:09:32] there's a huge rope
[1:09:34] this is not original robe there's no aim
[1:09:37] cut for elisha he's a secondhand robe
[1:09:40] and he feel like a prince
[1:09:42] he took off his whole robe he put on the
[1:09:44] second-hand robe and he looked into
[1:09:46] something to move and nothing moving
[1:09:49] nothing moving stage two nothing moving
[1:09:52] and all of a sudden a key turn in his
[1:09:54] heart he recognizes not this rule
[1:09:57] i have to get this thing for his hand
[1:09:59] i can get a second on revelation i can
[1:10:01] get a second an inspiration i can get a
[1:10:04] second hand message i have to get dusty
[1:10:07] at the lord
[1:10:08] oh where is the lord god of elijah
[1:10:15] where is the lord god of elijah
[1:10:20] then he took the mantle and strike the
[1:10:22] jordan and jordan did what jordan know
[1:10:25] it had to do
[1:10:27] when a man anointed with faith
[1:10:40] wrong
[1:10:47] when the school of the prophets
[1:10:51] see elijah come back over
[1:10:54] they have to confess
[1:10:55] they have to confess
[1:10:57] the spirit of elijah
[1:10:59] don't press upon elisha because we see
[1:11:02] the same signs we see the same wonders
[1:11:04] we see in the same miracles
[1:11:07] they have to take note that you have
[1:11:08] been with jesus they have to take note
[1:11:11] that you have been contact with
[1:11:13] something bigger than you
[1:11:14] something more powerful than you you
[1:11:16] have to take note that you have been
[1:11:19] with dynamics you have been with jesus
[1:11:22] oh blessed be the rock
[1:11:24] of our salvation
[1:11:27] hallelujah
[1:11:29] so the third stage
[1:11:30] elisha
[1:11:32] had was to call upon god
[1:11:35] to contact the power
[1:11:37] and the spirit
[1:11:39] for that promise that he was received
[1:11:41] so it means
[1:11:43] even though he crossed all the way
[1:11:45] if he didn't get the key
[1:11:47] to ask for the god that elijah had
[1:11:50] he was just going to be a man
[1:11:52] swimming over jordan with a rope on his
[1:11:55] back
[1:11:56] hallelujah because it take power to open
[1:11:59] up jordan if you don't have the power
[1:12:01] you better swim
[1:12:03] or wait till the jordan go low to cross
[1:12:05] over but elisha when he called for the
[1:12:08] court of elijah that god made an
[1:12:11] appearance i'd like to see what god does
[1:12:14] he does leave himself on the edge of
[1:12:16] your fate if you don't go to the edge
[1:12:19] you're not going to see here
[1:12:20] some people playing it safe
[1:12:22] don't play it safe let your faith go out
[1:12:26] let's take it to the edge
[1:12:28] he is going to be there
[1:12:30] when you need him oh blessed be the name
[1:12:33] of the lord
[1:12:35] i know the devil
[1:12:36] will bang your mind you may be seated
[1:12:40] and tell you
[1:12:41] what if he's not there
[1:12:43] what if he don't appear
[1:12:45] what if he don't confirm those two
[1:12:46] hebrew boys went through their own stuff
[1:12:48] they say our god
[1:12:50] is able to deliver us and if we don't
[1:12:52] deliver us we are not going to bow down
[1:12:54] god took them to the edge they were
[1:12:56] getting closer to the fire and quad
[1:12:58] wasn't there it was only when they get
[1:13:00] inside the fire that's the very edge
[1:13:02] itself in the fire itself in the fire
[1:13:06] itself some of you you don't even want
[1:13:08] to go near the fire but if god before us
[1:13:12] who can be against us if god be for you
[1:13:15] who can be against you come on now let
[1:13:19] your feet go out
[1:13:20] don't be afraid of going to the edge
[1:13:30] let me be seated
[1:13:33] oh glory
[1:13:35] don't be afraid
[1:13:37] faith
[1:13:38] is what it will take
[1:13:40] to go all the way
[1:13:41] in god
[1:13:43] amen
[1:13:44] the dynamics is the promise
[1:13:47] that no man can fulfill
[1:13:50] not even jesus
[1:13:51] he breathed on them
[1:13:53] receiving the holy ghost if jesus could
[1:13:55] fulfill it then he could have give them
[1:13:57] he could appoint upon them but all he
[1:13:59] could give them is the promise
[1:14:01] he said i have to go
[1:14:03] if i don't go
[1:14:04] comforter will not come i will give you
[1:14:06] another comforter who in the world
[1:14:08] cannot receive but you see him and he
[1:14:11] you do not with him but he shall be in
[1:14:14] you he is now with you but he's going to
[1:14:17] be in you
[1:14:18] who will hallelujah a little while the
[1:14:19] world see at me no more but i'm going to
[1:14:21] come in a different way i'm going to
[1:14:23] come and even for him it could be the
[1:14:25] same jesus i'm going to hide myself
[1:14:27] inside of you a power gonna come upon
[1:14:30] you
[1:14:31] hallelujah
[1:14:34] hallelujah
[1:14:37] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:14:40] hallelujah are you with me
[1:14:42] oh let's let's take another one look at
[1:14:44] mary
[1:14:45] bible said virgin shall conceive that is
[1:14:48] scripture
[1:14:49] hallelujah here come mary that's the
[1:14:51] word i promise hear the angel come to
[1:14:54] bring back the same word i promise mary
[1:14:57] you are highly favored mary you are the
[1:15:00] one spoken about in isaiah 9 6 not the
[1:15:03] angel manifesting things yet the angel
[1:15:06] come to remind mary of the word of
[1:15:08] promise the lord is with dead blessed
[1:15:10] adel so let's look at this stage one the
[1:15:13] scripture full of the promise virgin
[1:15:15] shall conceive stage two angel appearing
[1:15:19] to mary to give mary a promise of a
[1:15:22] mighty visitation to give mary a promise
[1:15:25] of dynamics coming upon her married a
[1:15:28] question how shall these things be how
[1:15:31] shall this dynamic is gonna come how
[1:15:33] it's gonna be fulfilled how i'm gonna
[1:15:35] get messiah he said the holy ghost the
[1:15:38] holy ghost the holy ghost the holy ghost
[1:15:42] the holy ghost gonna come upon you
[1:15:53] jesus
[1:15:54] hallelujah
[1:15:56] my
[1:15:57] hallelujah
[1:15:58] so when the sons
[1:16:00] receive it
[1:16:01] adopted
[1:16:02] dears my spirit flowing freely
[1:16:04] out of the body of sons it wasn't me
[1:16:07] sons in that sense it would be the
[1:16:09] spirit himself bringing out sea germ
[1:16:12] from the body because that's how sons
[1:16:14] are born a father i have a german
[1:16:16] hallelujah to the betting of a mother
[1:16:19] a son is perfect and the same way the
[1:16:22] sons of god could have the german
[1:16:25] of god because it will be god in the
[1:16:28] sons and god have the germ and the
[1:16:31] german in god in the sons will be
[1:16:35] released to call our sons by the spoken
[1:16:38] word therefore every elected son that
[1:16:41] was locked up in the loins of adam that
[1:16:44] was supposed to come forth by spoken
[1:16:46] word expression will come forth as names
[1:16:50] from the book in the last days the book
[1:16:53] is the term the book going to be in a
[1:16:56] fightful ministry and from that book
[1:16:59] names gonna be called by the world
[1:17:02] people are going to be sealed right in
[1:17:04] their seats
[1:17:09] the predestination
[1:17:12] going to be sealed
[1:17:14] even over the internet
[1:17:16] but if brenham said the holy ghost will
[1:17:19] sweep across the world
[1:17:21] overnight
[1:17:26] nothing going to stop it
[1:17:28] nothing going to stop it
[1:17:38] let me see that
[1:17:39] hallelujah
[1:17:41] the dynamics
[1:17:42] is the promise
[1:17:43] of the father
[1:17:45] when sons receive it
[1:17:46] and it's forward in the word we said
[1:17:48] that amen
[1:17:49] the promised dynamics
[1:17:51] is also the promised lattering
[1:17:54] according to the scripture
[1:17:56] matthew 13 he achieved the good son of
[1:17:59] man the field is the world the good seed
[1:18:02] are the children of the kingdom the evil
[1:18:05] seeds are the eternal wicked one the
[1:18:07] harvest is the end time the reapers are
[1:18:09] the angels that's the prophecy and but
[1:18:12] abraham had a vision the vision was the
[1:18:14] tears crying for rain and the wheat
[1:18:17] crying for rain it was taking rain to
[1:18:20] manifest both so the dynamics going to
[1:18:23] come from god
[1:18:30] who controls rain
[1:18:32] the farmer
[1:18:34] follow the plant where he planned
[1:18:36] if god has said it really fall
[1:18:38] a farmer operates by fate a fisherman
[1:18:40] operated by feet a fisherman from my
[1:18:42] fate if you want to see fit go and see a
[1:18:44] fisherman trolling his net he don't know
[1:18:46] what's under there you have no spy
[1:18:48] glasses to see how much fish where the
[1:18:50] fish is suppose the fish decide to go
[1:18:52] south since what if he said let us go up
[1:18:54] north
[1:18:56] he could say the whole night i caught
[1:18:57] nothing beat a horse a fish all night
[1:19:00] and call nothing but when jesus brought
[1:19:02] a word
[1:19:03] cast a net on the right side
[1:19:06] hallelujah you mean no he said no
[1:19:09] they say but just about no office i have
[1:19:11] nothing to do with just now
[1:19:13] i am talking about now
[1:19:16] oh hallelujah
[1:19:18] hallelujah
[1:19:19] and if god say no
[1:19:21] cast it right now
[1:19:23] pray it right now
[1:19:24] praise him right now
[1:19:26] worship him right now
[1:19:28] believe it right now
[1:19:30] receive it right now
[1:19:39] oh hallelujah
[1:19:41] hallelujah
[1:19:42] hallelujah
[1:19:44] they obeyed
[1:19:45] peter obeyed
[1:19:47] if peter was argumentative if peter was
[1:19:49] his intellect he got a debate with
[1:19:51] christ as a whole night we tired we
[1:19:54] weary oh hallelujah you can't expect me
[1:19:57] to put back that net in the boat a rack
[1:20:00] in the sea but peter knew different if
[1:20:02] the lord speaks my word
[1:20:05] my word
[1:20:06] my word
[1:20:07] cannot return void my word
[1:20:10] can return empty my word and have a hook
[1:20:12] on it my word have something to bring up
[1:20:16] my word had something to pull through
[1:20:27] so the ministry of christ
[1:20:29] he walked with the disciples
[1:20:31] the ministry of christ
[1:20:32] christ
[1:20:33] walk with his disciples
[1:20:35] his ministry
[1:20:36] ministry of christ christ himself
[1:20:38] isn't that right and he came for
[1:20:40] disciples temporary power in matthew 10
[1:20:43] behold i send you power her power was
[1:20:46] serpents and scorpions they did not have
[1:20:48] the holy ghost they didn't have
[1:20:49] character they had jealousy and envy
[1:20:52] they didn't have it they were preaching
[1:20:54] and witnessing and did not have what
[1:20:55] they took
[1:20:57] that paul was a taste
[1:20:59] that power was temporary that was that
[1:21:01] permanent power that was temporary power
[1:21:04] that was christ with them
[1:21:06] hallelujah giving words of promise the
[1:21:09] same works i do shall you do also christ
[1:21:12] giving them promise if you shall say it
[1:21:13] to the smoking we move i don't know in
[1:21:15] your heart you shall have whatever you
[1:21:18] said he knew they had not the character
[1:21:20] they did not have the character for that
[1:21:22] yet but they didn't hinder him from
[1:21:24] trapping the promises upon them because
[1:21:26] the promises belong to them the secret
[1:21:28] things belonging to the lord about god
[1:21:30] but the things that are revealed belong
[1:21:32] unto us and to our children so jesus
[1:21:35] knew as sons of god these promises
[1:21:38] belong to them even though they didn't
[1:21:40] understand it even though the fear
[1:21:42] couldn't grasp it it belonged to them
[1:21:45] and these promises we preached by these
[1:21:47] promises by these promises hallelujah
[1:21:51] you become partaker of the divine nature
[1:21:54] these promises belong to you yes i know
[1:21:57] some of you are wary but the promise is
[1:21:58] yours yes i know some of you are tired
[1:22:01] but the promises are yours yes yes i
[1:22:03] know some of you have dead but the
[1:22:06] promise is still yours
[1:22:11] some of you
[1:22:13] people give up
[1:22:15] give up
[1:22:16] but the promise is still yours
[1:22:18] you may be seated
[1:22:20] if god wanted
[1:22:21] goku to bring him into a land
[1:22:35] but god make sure
[1:22:36] the land is populated
[1:22:38] the land not only are philistines or
[1:22:40] hittites jebusites decide
[1:22:43] that right
[1:22:47] god and god said that is yours
[1:23:02] are you seeing smoke
[1:23:04] from a philistine pot
[1:23:06] cooking on a mountain

[1:23:19] philistines symbols
[1:23:21] ritualistic

[1:23:24] of their gods
[1:23:25] and god said that land is yours
[1:23:28] and god said
[1:23:29] drag them out
[1:23:42] i'm not trying to pump you for nothing i
[1:23:43] just i just observing you today i just
[1:23:45] pushing the word

[1:24:02] the land that is mine
[1:24:05] i already saved the philistine notation
[1:24:09] since since 1975 i on my way
[1:24:13] i can't back down now
[1:24:15] i can't give up now
[1:24:19] you know
[1:24:20] you maybe see that they find somebody
[1:24:21] digging for gold they dig dig dig and
[1:24:23] they get so tired and weary and they
[1:24:24] give up
[1:24:26] and our next man just just put each
[1:24:27] other wong soo

[1:25:42] of people's body on the living
[1:25:44] there's a man-made heart much as a
[1:25:46] god-spoken heart

[1:27:55] and somebody came and told and he had a
[1:27:56] kind of raspy voice and some news people

[1:28:01] ugly
[1:28:02] voices nice

[1:28:07] that's good people are coming to see me

[1:28:18] then they're shocked coming to me jesus
[1:28:21] in those days
[1:28:22] men walk into offices and people fall
[1:28:25] under the power of god
[1:28:27] when they walk into the office
[1:28:29] secretary type is falling under the

[1:29:25] resurrection faith
[1:29:27] they see jesus
[1:29:29] they know he's not dead
[1:29:30] they know he's alive their faith now is
[1:29:33] specially anointed because they know the
[1:29:35] messiah is alive and he tell them behold
[1:29:39] i send the promise of my father
[1:29:41] upon you

[1:29:49] ain't telling them when he just said
[1:29:51] stay there
[1:29:53] until
[1:29:54] until
[1:29:56] until
[1:29:58] until you get a new revelation no
[1:30:00] until you receive power
[1:30:03] from where from a deacon
[1:30:05] no come along by crate
[1:30:08] coming on an airplane in a box smack
[1:30:10] power to you
[1:30:11] no no no it's not coming that way
[1:30:14] power from on high
[1:30:16] that is what this will need
[1:30:18] power from on high not power for some
[1:30:20] bishop
[1:30:21] not power from some man
[1:30:23] power from on high you see when you get
[1:30:26] power from an eye those who low can't
[1:30:28] take off that power
[1:30:30] because that power comes from on high
[1:30:33] hallelujah those on the ground can upset
[1:30:36] that power because they come from high i
[1:30:38] know what the scripture said power
[1:30:40] belong to god
[1:30:43] do you know god gives power
[1:30:46] god raised up king and said dunking
[1:30:48] goddess take people out of power
[1:30:50] their kingdoms have been removed
[1:30:53] goddess take pastors out of power
[1:30:55] take men out of power take king and pray
[1:30:58] all the power god has set up who we want
[1:31:00] where he wants to face purpose nothing
[1:31:02] shall escape god's purpose and plan
[1:31:05] hallelujah do you know god set you up in
[1:31:07] power
[1:31:14] the amen that you say to that some of
[1:31:16] you you ain't sure about that
[1:31:22] some of you need to listen back to some
[1:31:23] of the messages that preach already
[1:31:25] i talk about the layers of demon power
[1:31:26] god at the mind to find you
[1:31:30] you know why daniel had to wait
[1:31:33] how many days i had to wait
[1:31:35] because
[1:31:36] gabriel was detained
[1:31:38] by evil spirits here to fight true
[1:31:41] but abram said if daniel stop praying
[1:31:43] the angels stop coming
[1:31:48] home and you know that amen
[1:31:50] he said if daniel only stopped praying
[1:31:51] if daniel got where he said god i don't
[1:31:53] know now enjoy her stop i going back
[1:31:57] but daniel
[1:31:59] he believed god was going to answer
[1:32:02] so as he prayed angel coming
[1:32:05] and he prayed right through daily angel
[1:32:06] come right through to him
[1:32:08] hallelujah
[1:32:09] daniel almighty man seeking god to find
[1:32:12] out the will of god
[1:32:14] hallelujah praise the name of the lord
[1:32:17] but abandon your written epistles right
[1:32:18] of all men to another wrong
[1:32:21] read of all man manifested word of god
[1:32:24] peter and john they had no education but
[1:32:26] they had taken notice that men were
[1:32:27] jesus they were ignorant and unlearned
[1:32:30] but they were written epistles
[1:32:32] read that they had been with jesus read
[1:32:35] that they remember jesus because jesus
[1:32:37] here we go was manifesting himself
[1:32:39] through them
[1:32:41] christ
[1:32:42] veiled in their flesh
[1:32:45] manifested
[1:32:46] made alive like he was in moses
[1:32:49] you see you you will recognize in what i
[1:32:52] am preaching and i'm we're doing this
[1:32:54] for years i emphasize strongly the life
[1:32:56] the manifestation
[1:32:58] i strongly emphasize that because i
[1:33:00] believe it has to come forward
[1:33:02] i cannot believe after 40 plus years we
[1:33:05] have to have more teachings and
[1:33:06] teachings and revelations and i i i
[1:33:09] really can't see that
[1:33:11] i am seeing that we are coming to
[1:33:12] ripeness
[1:33:13] and that's brotherly kindness broadly
[1:33:15] kindness is evidence of your rightness
[1:33:17] and after that the spirit have to come
[1:33:19] to connect with that
[1:33:21] okay so watch tree is perfection from
[1:33:23] prison the ministry
[1:33:25] comes to its perfection
[1:33:27] when it reproduced christ again in the
[1:33:31] natural among human beings and we read
[1:33:34] for you how virtue came under christ
[1:33:36] now we can't
[1:33:38] manufacture that
[1:33:39] we can pretend we can't set somebody up
[1:33:41] touch me touch me touch me and see vote
[1:33:43] you come out
[1:33:45] that's not working
[1:33:46] i don't have that and you ain't get you
[1:33:48] feel that there's not set up you know
[1:33:50] what i'm saying it can't work
[1:33:52] when christ come alive
[1:33:55] amidst his people the virtue going to
[1:33:57] flow but iran said you don't have to say
[1:33:59] anything he will make it known among men
[1:34:02] it will speak for itself
[1:34:07] so no body would be uh uh god wouldn't
[1:34:10] you know people boasting it wouldn't
[1:34:12] have that it's gonna be christ
[1:34:15] manifested made a life unlike his words
[1:34:18] here in the natural
[1:34:21] it's in other words you have to see it
[1:34:23] in other words i say this where the word
[1:34:24] must become flesh
[1:34:26] not the word becomes more word
[1:34:29] but the word becomes
[1:34:30] flesh okay but the bottom says here now
[1:34:33] if you got the holy spirit in you then
[1:34:36] you are candidate
[1:34:37] for association with the unseen world
[1:34:40] and the supernatural
[1:34:42] hallelujah watch when the holy spirit
[1:34:44] comes into the heart quickly you become
[1:34:46] a twofold being one on the earth to die
[1:34:49] and one of heaven to live and this body
[1:34:51] is still subject to death but in his
[1:34:53] soul he is passed from death unto life
[1:34:55] and this body has an earthly contact
[1:34:57] with five senses in his spirit he has
[1:34:59] contact with god through the holy ghost
[1:35:02] and the angel of god visits them and
[1:35:05] speaks with them and they are messengers
[1:35:07] sent from god to reveal and to bring
[1:35:09] messages of god to the individual
[1:35:13] oh praise the name of the lord do you
[1:35:14] believe that
[1:35:15] so the sea time is when the seed begins
[1:35:17] to take on life when these virtues begin
[1:35:20] to come alive at some point in time you
[1:35:22] see you cannot expect to be
[1:35:25] like uh
[1:35:27] you're born an adult son
[1:35:29] no you grow in god but abandon said it
[1:35:32] this way when you say i want to get
[1:35:33] closer to god what you are saying is i
[1:35:36] want to grow in god
[1:35:38] when you have faith you want to get
[1:35:40] closer you need virtue
[1:35:42] when you have virtue i want to get
[1:35:43] closer to you i love you you want that
[1:35:45] means you want knowledge
[1:35:46] you want to get closer to god that means
[1:35:48] they want temperance then you want
[1:35:50] patience then you want god you see
[1:35:52] you're getting closer and afterwards you
[1:35:53] can't get any more closer you become one
[1:36:01] so that's why that's why jesus come and
[1:36:03] say when you see me you you see the
[1:36:05] father he says she was the father but i
[1:36:07] thought you understand this thing by
[1:36:08] revelation when you see me you see the
[1:36:10] father the father is looking at me i'm a
[1:36:12] mature son now i'm ripened there's my
[1:36:15] spirit flowing freely
[1:36:16] the father is working through me if you
[1:36:18] don't believe me for what i'm saying to
[1:36:20] you my words believe me for the work
[1:36:23] sake you see right now nobody could say
[1:36:24] that
[1:36:26] because christ is not manifested in that
[1:36:28] way yet
[1:36:30] but jesus was in a position to say if
[1:36:32] you don't believe my words believe me
[1:36:34] for my work's sake
[1:36:36] in other words when the they had a man
[1:36:38] that was crippled and jesus asked them
[1:36:40] he said this is a given day he spoke the
[1:36:42] words to the man and they had a problem
[1:36:44] with that and he knew that issues with
[1:36:47] pronouncing forgiveness to a man because
[1:36:49] only god could forgive sins so by saying
[1:36:51] i forgive you you pray you plain god you
[1:36:54] are saying i am god that what you're
[1:36:55] saying they say we disagree with that
[1:36:57] that can't be he said which one is
[1:36:59] easier
[1:37:00] which one is easier tell the man for
[1:37:02] your sins forgiven or pick up a bed and
[1:37:05] walk he said i could do both
[1:37:07] he said mister pick up your bed and walk
[1:37:10] and a man pick up his bed and walk and
[1:37:12] they can't
[1:37:15] how could they deal with
[1:37:18] that because they can't do either
[1:37:21] he said i could do both
[1:37:23] because when your sins are forgiven you
[1:37:25] could be healed healing is evident your
[1:37:27] sins are forgiven
[1:37:29] because healing comes from that covenant
[1:37:31] of the blood
[1:37:33] oh glory to god so you can be healed
[1:37:34] today
[1:37:35] i look at what the doctors say
[1:37:38] i look at how you feel
[1:37:40] you can be healed today
[1:37:42] during the service
[1:37:43] right now
[1:37:45] i'm not talking about tomorrow tomorrow
[1:37:47] the doctor could confirm that you are
[1:37:49] healed
[1:37:50] but i'm talking about right now
[1:37:53] heal
[1:37:54] completely
[1:37:56] be made whole
[1:37:57] hallelujah
[1:37:59] the creature don't heal
[1:38:01] god is a healer
[1:38:02] and he's the same yesterday today and
[1:38:04] forever
[1:38:06] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:38:08] o praise his holy name
[1:38:10] isn't that right
[1:38:12] so i believe
[1:38:13] that there must be a manifestation of
[1:38:15] forgiveness
[1:38:16] a broadly kindness
[1:38:18] before the dynamic strike
[1:38:21] i'm talking about a real
[1:38:24] manifestation
[1:38:26] not a taste
[1:38:27] it i call it hornets
[1:38:30] sweet in the mouth
[1:38:31] i'm not talking about that i'm talking
[1:38:33] about the honey that sticks
[1:38:35] the sticky honey
[1:38:37] the sticky honey the sticky one that's
[1:38:39] the one division one that sticks i want
[1:38:40] to read something from a comment given
[1:38:43] on 18th of july 2010 how oft shall i
[1:38:46] forgive my brother
[1:38:47] if he sins against me
[1:38:49] until 70 times
[1:38:51] this was spoken in new york and i want
[1:38:53] to read it
[1:38:54] now church you may be seated
[1:38:56] this is very important very important
[1:38:58] because you cannot if you cannot forgive
[1:39:00] you do not have a revelation of your
[1:39:02] requirement for the age
[1:39:04] as spoken by the prophet malachi 4
[1:39:06] and you could never receive the holy
[1:39:09] ghost
[1:39:10] without this revelation of broadly
[1:39:12] kindness
[1:39:14] now on page 304
[1:39:16] which follows the manifestation of
[1:39:18] brotherly kindness
[1:39:20] malachi 4 is saying
[1:39:22] wait till them seven thunders uttered
[1:39:24] their voices to the group
[1:39:26] that can handle the bible
[1:39:28] that can handle the word handle it in
[1:39:31] love
[1:39:32] speak to one another in love
[1:39:34] you don't have to have a title
[1:39:36] you
[1:39:37] you are to get in your position and
[1:39:40] everybody ready to handle the word
[1:39:42] to handle the word
[1:39:44] then the seven thunders utter the voices
[1:39:45] of that group who is in position to
[1:39:47] handle the word
[1:39:49] that group that is ready and prepared by
[1:39:52] the lord himself for our seventh and
[1:39:54] revival
[1:39:55] no man can prepare you for that but they
[1:39:58] are the words of the prophet
[1:40:00] the son of man isn't that right
[1:40:02] from perfect faith now fear is based on
[1:40:03] forgiveness and we said this morning we
[1:40:06] are trying to get the church into a
[1:40:07] place to where we could see apostle
[1:40:09] times moving among us that's what we
[1:40:10] hunger for it's laying at the door
[1:40:13] and we wanted to flow
[1:40:16] to flow out
[1:40:18] to others
[1:40:20] so in other words the promise that we're
[1:40:21] moving into is not for us ourselves
[1:40:25] the promise we're moving into
[1:40:27] is to flow out to others
[1:40:30] it's you becoming your own dynamo
[1:40:33] it flow out of your bellies i'll flow
[1:40:36] something's gonna flew out it going to
[1:40:38] go out to others now let's go
[1:40:40] so this is what we are waiting for
[1:40:43] forgiveness
[1:40:44] a flow
[1:40:45] not a one-time thing
[1:40:48] but a flow
[1:40:49] brotherly kindness
[1:40:51] flowing out
[1:40:52] to flow out to others
[1:40:54] to call to the other sister churches to
[1:40:57] call to the others because the prophet
[1:40:59] said when the church finds his brotherly
[1:41:00] love
[1:41:02] holy see
[1:41:03] place in christ it will call to the
[1:41:06] other members of the body
[1:41:07] what are we calling say come and rejoice
[1:41:09] with us
[1:41:10] we have found the coin that was lost
[1:41:12] listen to this so may i drop this this
[1:41:14] is brother coleman marriage of this
[1:41:16] testimony concerning a flow going out to
[1:41:18] others
[1:41:19] while listening to the first service in
[1:41:20] harrisburg
[1:41:22] the lord spoke to me to call by the
[1:41:23] billy paul considering the manifestation
[1:41:26] of brotherly kindness as spoken by
[1:41:28] brother branham
[1:41:29] so i phoned by the billy and give my
[1:41:32] testimony concerning the meetings at
[1:41:34] harrisburg
[1:41:36] and told by the ability that i want to
[1:41:37] encourage you with this testimony
[1:41:40] i know how you have been waiting to see
[1:41:42] these things spooked my brother branham
[1:41:43] for this bright seven days requirement
[1:41:45] to be manifest
[1:41:47] knowing how your father's message was
[1:41:49] busted up into splinters
[1:41:50] so much misunderstandings and such
[1:41:53] but finally brother billy
[1:41:54] the message came down to the seven age
[1:41:57] requirement harrisburg it went into
[1:41:59] forgiveness
[1:42:00] and this is what happened at the
[1:42:01] meetings but i believe between six and
[1:42:03] nine
[1:42:04] that was laying right at the door
[1:42:05] perfect feet which is laying right at
[1:42:07] the door became a reality in harrisburg
[1:42:10] then brother billy sent back to brother
[1:42:13] coleman let me give you a testimony
[1:42:15] a group of 20 believers
[1:42:17] came directly from your convention to
[1:42:19] the tabernacle sunday july 11th i was
[1:42:22] not there but i was told i wish i wish i
[1:42:25] was there
[1:42:26] i was told that these 20 believers from
[1:42:28] the headstone time lachlan trinidad
[1:42:30] came down this is about to believe the
[1:42:32] brother coleman whereby the joe they
[1:42:34] really blessed random tabernacle
[1:42:36] and manifested a greater anointing of
[1:42:38] brotherly kindness
[1:42:40] in branham tabernacle and everybody is
[1:42:43] talking about it
[1:42:44] go out the prophet said
[1:42:46] let it flow
[1:42:48] let it flow to others amen everybody's
[1:42:49] talking about it so church catch what
[1:42:51] happened here
[1:42:52] i said a nucleus will go out
[1:42:55] and will go back and go out to other
[1:42:57] members of the body in other words
[1:42:59] broadly kindness interaction
[1:43:01] so by the tear of it that was from
[1:43:02] brother tears over church god bless you
[1:43:04] and those believers in your church that
[1:43:06] did that that was a blessing to me go
[1:43:08] out and no doubt it will be noise abroad
[1:43:10] not only what happened but i'm tamaraca
[1:43:12] but what happened at harrisburg
[1:43:15] so a mighty thing happened
[1:43:17] and it's got to excite you it excited
[1:43:20] billy
[1:43:22] watch it's got to excite you because
[1:43:24] think about what happened
[1:43:26] what happens now
[1:43:28] when the seven thunders you got barely
[1:43:29] kindness
[1:43:30] but when the seven thunders
[1:43:33] uttered their voices
[1:43:35] to a group
[1:43:37] a people
[1:43:38] who is manifesting brotherly kindness
[1:43:41] who is manifesting their seventh age
[1:43:45] requirement
[1:43:46] they shall break forth healings
[1:43:49] they will break forth signs
[1:43:51] wonders
[1:43:52] miracles or point of the dynamics to
[1:43:55] their mechanics i might say this brother
[1:43:57] coleman this is barack woman bradley
[1:43:59] kindness is the revelation that releases
[1:44:02] the holy ghost
[1:44:08] but you don't have to look far to
[1:44:10] understand that you can just look at the
[1:44:12] pyramid
[1:44:13] after brotherly kindness is holy spirit
[1:44:16] so then what we said is the night of the
[1:44:18] prophetic utterance in kyle 23 years ago
[1:44:21] the holy spirit is trying to see one to
[1:44:24] see the whole thing but where is the
[1:44:25] brotherly kindness
[1:44:27] where is the forgiveness
[1:44:28] oh hallelujah praise god
[1:44:31] just think
[1:44:32] the holy spirit can pour in upon you if
[1:44:36] there are no oughts in you against
[1:44:37] anybody
[1:44:39] there is nothing no devil could prevent
[1:44:41] you from receiving the holy ghost if
[1:44:42] there is no odds in other words you have
[1:44:45] rendered satan harmless
[1:44:47] oh praise anyway he cannot stop you oh
[1:44:49] blessed be the lord isn't that right
[1:44:51] satan you can't do anything he is
[1:44:53] rendered harmless he cannot stop you
[1:44:56] oh glory to god because you have no
[1:44:58] oughts he has nothing he can work
[1:45:00] through
[1:45:01] if everybody in this church no arts no
[1:45:03] grudge the devil do i have a speck
[1:45:06] i find no fault in him
[1:45:08] ah
[1:45:10] glory
[1:45:11] hallelujah
[1:45:13] glory hallelujah no watch it doesn't
[1:45:16] matter what anybody has done to you
[1:45:20] it doesn't matter what anybody has done
[1:45:21] to you
[1:45:22] because you have an open vision of
[1:45:25] forgiveness
[1:45:26] which is the channel for charity to come
[1:45:28] down dear that channel will flow out to
[1:45:31] the members of the body whosoever will
[1:45:33] so church do we finally understand that
[1:45:36] the seventh and the fate we have been
[1:45:37] speaking about is based on forgiveness
[1:45:41] you cannot get around it
[1:45:44] oh praise the name of the lord
[1:45:47] once that revelation
[1:45:49] from malachi 4 has been established they
[1:45:52] must come to it
[1:45:54] or be cut off
[1:45:56] but the bride she humbles herself
[1:45:59] she drops her out
[1:46:01] she forgives oh praise the name of the
[1:46:03] lord
[1:46:04] now i read that
[1:46:07] to say
[1:46:08] that this testimony was a sign
[1:46:11] that wasn't the real thing
[1:46:13] that was not the honey that sticks
[1:46:15] because some of the president who was in
[1:46:17] that not even in this church right now
[1:46:19] hallelujah hallelujah you understand
[1:46:21] what i'm saying so all of this is for
[1:46:23] science i am not talking about this i am
[1:46:26] talking about that that the prophets
[1:46:28] take off
[1:46:29] the honey that sticks
[1:46:31] there is going to be a manifestation
[1:46:34] of brotherly kindness
[1:46:36] i am not talking about revelation i am
[1:46:40] talking about manifestation
[1:46:43] let me give you all some praises
[1:46:45] now i read this
[1:46:47] to show this was a real experience
[1:46:50] but the terence was there real holy
[1:46:52] spirit poured out people were crying
[1:46:55] real experience we had it in cairo you
[1:46:57] can't put it on
[1:46:59] it's a feeling
[1:47:00] amen it's a feeling of brotherly
[1:47:03] kindness
[1:47:04] is that an emotional hip-hop is that
[1:47:06] something is a spirit of brotherly
[1:47:08] kindness it is what makes you put
[1:47:10] yourself on the brother's place on the
[1:47:13] matter
[1:47:14] before you judge somebody you put on
[1:47:16] their shoes
[1:47:18] and walk where they walk
[1:47:27] i'll restore
[1:47:29] all right amen now jesus spoke let brady
[1:47:32] love god paul said rather let by love
[1:47:34] continue that was in the first church
[1:47:36] but something taking place there's a
[1:47:38] fellow come by name of palmer woman and
[1:47:40] when he began to eat that vine of really
[1:47:41] love he cut the very sap line of it
[1:47:44] because it don't make any difference how
[1:47:45] smart we are how much we think we know
[1:47:48] how much we want to be different from
[1:47:50] somebody else but as long as that
[1:47:52] brotherly feeling isn't among us we are
[1:47:55] fighting a losing battle
[1:47:57] we can't win
[1:47:59] there is no way to win
[1:48:02] you you believe that
[1:48:04] as long as that brother is that what the
[1:48:06] devil does kill it
[1:48:09] and make doctrinal wars kill it
[1:48:11] but as long as that feeling is not there
[1:48:13] you can't win
[1:48:14] because faith is based on
[1:48:17] forgiveness
[1:48:18] hallelujah so to approach into sort of
[1:48:21] moving the perfect fate you have to have
[1:48:23] a forgiving heart
[1:48:25] is not right
[1:48:26] notice the first gift is wisdom
[1:48:29] the first gift of wisdom which is the
[1:48:31] best gift of the group
[1:48:33] if we don't have wisdom we won't know
[1:48:36] how to use knowledge
[1:48:38] which is the second gift
[1:48:40] so wisdom is how to use knowledge wisdom
[1:48:43] is first
[1:48:44] knowledge is second and if we can't use
[1:48:46] the second gift without wisdom how are
[1:48:48] we going to use the last gift
[1:48:49] interpretation
[1:48:51] all right no but imam said when the
[1:48:53] nomination isolates himself
[1:48:56] and separates his fellowship from his
[1:48:57] brethren that old palm room has eat the
[1:49:00] liver to begin with
[1:49:02] when we get to a place
[1:49:03] if you want to be different with a man
[1:49:05] why is the man i know
[1:49:07] i couldn't see eye to eye listen to this
[1:49:10] there's a man i know that i couldn't see
[1:49:12] eye to eye with as close in the script
[1:49:14] as anybody in the world is brother more
[1:49:15] set in here
[1:49:17] and we do get times when we are million
[1:49:19] minds apart
[1:49:21] in the scriptures but i'm a brother more
[1:49:24] but did that ever touch us no sir
[1:49:26] he loves me well enough
[1:49:28] not because he gives a penny of money no
[1:49:30] sir he flies on an old lockheed plane
[1:49:32] and everything else to get over here to
[1:49:34] be with me every little bit i don't
[1:49:36] believe that night would ever be too
[1:49:37] dark
[1:49:38] or the rain would ever fall too hard
[1:49:41] but what i'd climb and crawl to the
[1:49:43] jungles to get to him
[1:49:45] it's love
[1:49:46] and yet
[1:49:47] we wouldn't agree on scriptures by a
[1:49:49] hundred miles or millenniums and so
[1:49:51] forth like that on a security believer
[1:49:53] but that don't make it
[1:49:55] even a difference
[1:49:57] i am elected associate pastor to him
[1:50:00] i am so glad the power hadn't touched us
[1:50:02] yet but
[1:50:04] and i am saying that for example
[1:50:07] that we could do between two men why
[1:50:09] can't everybody do it
[1:50:14] but the problem is talking
[1:50:16] this is better more they have
[1:50:17] disagreement in scriptures but they
[1:50:19] still love each other
[1:50:24] i went to a church you know long ago i
[1:50:26] thought they would never invite me back
[1:50:29] caught a bunch a little safety woman was
[1:50:31] bobbing their hair wearing lipstick i
[1:50:32] tore the thing apart sure did
[1:50:35] i thought he wouldn't ask me back but
[1:50:36] you know what there was so much
[1:50:38] anointing of the holy spirit around the
[1:50:39] vine
[1:50:40] till an old palmer woman couldn't touch
[1:50:41] it at all
[1:50:47] you know there's an electric fence the
[1:50:49] palmer woman can't get over that fence
[1:50:50] that does shock him
[1:50:52] is the holy spirit of love
[1:50:54] it will kill him every time
[1:50:56] brothers if we need to build a fence
[1:50:58] it ought to be
[1:51:00] is it if we need fences to build it
[1:51:02] ought not to be natural fences it ought
[1:51:03] to be love fences to keep the insect out
[1:51:07] to keep the palm of him out
[1:51:09] he is the devil's number one destroyer
[1:51:13] he said no you have cancer no you have
[1:51:16] this he said come with love the world is
[1:51:17] dying he said we have got fine scholarly
[1:51:19] churches wonderful villains but we got
[1:51:22] weak pulpits something is wrong the
[1:51:24] congregation don't feel to one another
[1:51:26] like they used to there is something
[1:51:28] missing the world is looking to that
[1:51:31] what we need is a baptism of love for
[1:51:33] one another
[1:51:34] that will all men know you are my
[1:51:36] disciples then you have loved one for
[1:51:39] another
[1:51:40] oh are we in the word this morning
[1:51:42] praise god praise god
[1:51:44] from him that is where the is that's
[1:51:48] what the matter is they have lost their
[1:51:50] body love they have lost
[1:51:52] the feeling for one another
[1:52:00] what about them said here oh my god
[1:52:04] he said talk about his illumina spirit i
[1:52:06] read this sometime before what is in
[1:52:08] africa he said now watch i believe
[1:52:10] the great lesson today is to try the
[1:52:12] spirit of anything have this women of
[1:52:14] spirit i do not think that we should
[1:52:16] ever by any means ever try to judge a
[1:52:19] person by the denomination they belong
[1:52:21] to by the group they are associated with
[1:52:23] methodist baptist presbyterian
[1:52:24] pentecostal or whatever they are we
[1:52:26] should never judge the man by the
[1:52:28] denomination that he belongs to we
[1:52:30] should always judge him by the spirit he
[1:52:32] has the spirit whether he's laterine for
[1:52:34] marine inner outer norring whatever it
[1:52:36] might be we should never judge him by
[1:52:39] that but by his spirit we are to discern
[1:52:42] spirits watch now now i want to get this
[1:52:44] to the church this morning which is
[1:52:46] indeed funny nominations you are still
[1:52:48] the church of the living god
[1:52:49] and the thing i want to get to you is
[1:52:51] this we are really not divided we are
[1:52:54] stones that cuts in different forms all
[1:52:57] to the glory of god
[1:52:58] now there are so many much in this day
[1:53:00] that we live in pertinent to gifts so
[1:53:02] many people judge people by gifts that
[1:53:04] they have well i believe all these are
[1:53:06] gifts i believe we what we see is gifts
[1:53:09] they are god-given gifts but if we do
[1:53:11] not use them the right way that god
[1:53:13] intended them to be used then we can do
[1:53:15] more harm with the gifts that we that
[1:53:18] none of we didn't have gifts the other
[1:53:19] night i made a statement on the pulpit
[1:53:21] saying this i would rather see brotherly
[1:53:23] love existing among the church if we
[1:53:26] didn't have one case of divine healing
[1:53:34] we know
[1:53:35] we must know what these things are for
[1:53:37] now if a man comes and he has a great
[1:53:38] gift no matter if he belongs to our
[1:53:40] denomination
[1:53:41] or another nomination
[1:53:43] but
[1:53:44] you it doesn't matter how he dresses
[1:53:47] what you want to see is what is he
[1:53:49] trying to do with that gift
[1:53:50] what purpose he has if he's trying to
[1:53:52] take his influence and build himself a
[1:53:54] great name out of it i'll have these
[1:53:55] women of spirit enough to know that's
[1:53:57] wrong no matter how great a teacher he
[1:53:59] is how powerful he is how intellectual
[1:54:02] he is how his gift operates if he isn't
[1:54:04] trying to achieve something for the
[1:54:06] benefit of the body of christ your own
[1:54:08] spiritual desire will tell you that's
[1:54:10] wrong no matter how accurate how perfect
[1:54:13] how it is is wrong if it isn't used for
[1:54:16] the body of christ to achieve something
[1:54:18] maybe he got a great gift that he could
[1:54:20] draw people together with a great
[1:54:21] intellectual or spiritual power he could
[1:54:23] draw people together maybe he's trying
[1:54:24] to take a gift or make himself famous
[1:54:26] that he have a big name other person
[1:54:28] will look up to him as a big person
[1:54:30] that's wrong maybe he's trying to edify
[1:54:32] a certain thing here he wants everybody
[1:54:34] else to get out the picture let him and
[1:54:36] his group be in the picture that's still
[1:54:37] wrong but if he has a gift of god and
[1:54:40] he's trying to edify the body of christ
[1:54:42] then i don't care what he belongs to you
[1:54:44] are not discerning the man
[1:54:46] you are discerning the spirit
[1:54:49] the life that's in the man
[1:54:51] and that is what god told us to do not
[1:54:53] one time has he ever commissioned that
[1:54:55] he's in a man's group but we are
[1:54:57] constrained and commanded by god to
[1:55:00] discern the spirit in the man what he's
[1:55:03] trying to do
[1:55:04] what the spirit in his life is trying to
[1:55:06] lead him to and then we can find out
[1:55:08] that he's trying to lead the people not
[1:55:09] bring them up bring them together to
[1:55:11] bring the church of the living god not
[1:55:13] to one denomination but to an
[1:55:14] understanding to a fellowship to a unity
[1:55:17] of spirit that is what he's pointing to
[1:55:19] calvary that's what you want oh praise
[1:55:22] god
[1:55:22] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:55:26] i'll read it what he said here listen a
[1:55:27] moment i would rather have a church that
[1:55:29] knows nothing about any spiritual gift
[1:55:31] but just being so in love with each
[1:55:33] other and with christ
[1:55:34] i rather have that than every spiritual
[1:55:36] gift operated in the church now that my
[1:55:38] son had in a pentecostal group i would
[1:55:40] rather have it where there's gifts
[1:55:42] they'll feel
[1:55:44] where they're gifts they'll bring
[1:55:45] confusion
[1:55:46] whether it's gifts they can be
[1:55:47] questioned
[1:55:48] but there is love is perfect
[1:55:51] that's right and if you have perfect
[1:55:53] love you'll have perfect gifts
[1:55:55] so work with love first
[1:55:57] and that brings fellowship
[1:55:59] and fellowship bring gifts
[1:56:01] work with love
[1:56:03] love brings what
[1:56:05] fellowship if we say we have no sin we
[1:56:07] deceive ourselves the truth is not in us
[1:56:09] but if we confess us and he's faithful
[1:56:11] to amen
[1:56:13] and the blood of jesus cleanses us from
[1:56:15] all sin and we have fellowship one with
[1:56:17] another why because the same blood for
[1:56:19] you is for me
[1:56:20] isn't that right so what the church
[1:56:22] needs tonight is to know how to control
[1:56:24] these gifts for evil spirits can come in
[1:56:27] and speak just the same as good spirits
[1:56:29] can speak for satan can imitate every
[1:56:32] gift that god's got
[1:56:33] every gift he can the intimidate you
[1:56:36] must know the right and the wrong and by
[1:56:39] the fruits you're gonna know it watch
[1:56:42] whether it come to pass whether it's
[1:56:43] truth or not and that's the way of the
[1:56:45] spirit notice we are given gifts by
[1:56:47] measure christ was given the gifts
[1:56:49] without measure is that right he added
[1:56:51] without measure and
[1:56:53] christ it will be like a spoonful of
[1:56:55] water out of the ocean the chemicals in
[1:56:57] it is the same one spoon from the ocean
[1:56:59] is just the same chemical content as the
[1:57:01] ocean and he was talking that's the way
[1:57:03] it is that's the way we are when we are
[1:57:05] yielding to the spirit is the same
[1:57:07] spirit working through every gift are
[1:57:09] you talking about a woman that drinks a
[1:57:10] meridian and she died and years later
[1:57:13] they still find it pulsing on her oh
[1:57:15] pray i'll escape i'll skip that okay
[1:57:18] paul reader who perhaps preached right
[1:57:20] in his time and i could see him pulpit
[1:57:22] he said one time he and his wife were
[1:57:24] sitting at the table
[1:57:26] she wanted to do something he said
[1:57:28] there's no need to do that
[1:57:29] somehow he hurt a feeling and he thought
[1:57:31] well if a feeling is that easy hurt let
[1:57:33] them hurt
[1:57:39] he got up
[1:57:41] lay the people on the table
[1:57:42] went down to the street her custom was
[1:57:45] that she would meet him at the door kiss
[1:57:46] him goodbye
[1:57:47] and when he went out to the end of the
[1:57:48] gate he always looked back on the wave
[1:57:50] well she kissed him goodbye
[1:57:52] went out to the end of the gate looked
[1:57:54] back
[1:57:55] and she waved and said he started down
[1:57:58] the street and something began to
[1:57:59] condemn him
[1:58:02] he said what if she would die today when
[1:58:04] you're gone
[1:58:06] what if something would happen to you
[1:58:09] with that strange feeling that family of
[1:58:11] fear he got condemned
[1:58:14] he turned around run back real quick
[1:58:16] joke open the gate went in throw open
[1:58:18] the door look around he couldn't see her
[1:58:20] he heard her she was behind the door
[1:58:21] crying
[1:58:22] she said he never said a thing
[1:58:24] he just walked around there looked right
[1:58:27] in her face and kissed her again turn
[1:58:29] around went back out the gate she stand
[1:58:30] there wave again
[1:58:32] the difference of it was the last time
[1:58:35] she waved had feeling to it
[1:58:41] so the first wave was just that
[1:58:43] a wave
[1:58:46] the second wave it had feelings in it
[1:58:50] that is what we're talking about the
[1:58:51] honey that sticks
[1:58:52] the brotherly kindness that god bless
[1:58:54] you brother but if you have a chance
[1:58:56] you'll give him a little thing behind
[1:58:58] we're not talking about that kind of
[1:58:59] early kindness
[1:59:00] oh that's the way it is friends we can't
[1:59:02] put in artificial we need pentecostal
[1:59:05] fire and bloody love back in the church
[1:59:08] of the living god
[1:59:10] hallelujah you put the life of jesus
[1:59:12] christ back in the church you will stop
[1:59:14] fussing you'll be brothers and sisters
[1:59:16] you won't let your hair grow they will
[1:59:18] get up from manicures you will turn off
[1:59:20] the television programs that you ought
[1:59:22] not to be listening to and the glory of
[1:59:24] the lord shall return to zion with joy
[1:59:27] and there shall be a revival break out
[1:59:29] across the country that will put every
[1:59:31] critic to shame the powers of god will
[1:59:33] build into the church and jesus will
[1:59:36] come and manifest himself with signs and
[1:59:38] wonders
[1:59:40] what we need today
[1:59:42] oh we hope hidden home stretch just a
[1:59:43] little more again i can't cast up now
[1:59:45] right inside the gate right now
[1:59:47] hallelujah we just have two more gears
[1:59:48] to throw in there and up the hill are we
[1:59:50] gonna be there watch what beneath it is
[1:59:52] i beat him
[1:59:53] the gospel back into the church to
[1:59:55] straighten the church up to pull all the
[1:59:57] kinks of it back on the fellowship of
[1:59:59] the blood into the shekinah glory into a
[2:00:02] pentecostal experience what we need is a
[2:00:04] relationship with god
[2:00:06] till men and women that's the problem
[2:00:08] people in church too long that they
[2:00:10] think church is god if you have a
[2:00:12] relationship with god you'll treat your
[2:00:13] wife right
[2:00:18] your relationship with god empowers you
[2:00:21] to go in the kitchen and help her wash
[2:00:23] the wheels
[2:00:27] i ain't spock much even for that
[2:00:29] but i will still say it again
[2:00:32] your relationship with god will make a
[2:00:34] helper with the dishes
[2:00:36] happen with the children help her in the
[2:00:38] house and not sit down like king tut on
[2:00:41] some troll waiting to be served
[2:00:45] and i mean that brothers
[2:00:48] i really do
[2:01:01] what we need is a relationship again
[2:01:02] with god
[2:01:03] till men are willing to die out to
[2:01:05] themselves
[2:01:06] in the secret chamber with god
[2:01:08] until new life is produced until they
[2:01:11] become a new creature let a man do that
[2:01:13] if it'll cover it if he's an old coward
[2:01:16] he will go and win souls because why he
[2:01:18] become in divine relationship with god
[2:01:21] in the secret room to himself
[2:01:24] with him and god he's anointed and went
[2:01:26] in there with tears rolling on his cheek
[2:01:28] saying oh god give me the holy spirit i
[2:01:30] think if it cost me my wife my children
[2:01:32] my girlfriend whatever i am just fill me
[2:01:34] lord till i can stand in your presence
[2:01:37] and feel the shekinah glory searching
[2:01:40] over me
[2:01:42] sergeant truman
[2:01:44] oh hallelujah
[2:01:46] what you need is the holy ghost
[2:01:49] to be surging to your being
[2:01:54] we need men of god
[2:01:56] get back in the church where church
[2:01:58] ought to be
[2:01:59] association experience
[2:02:01] oh praise god a certain organization the
[2:02:03] other day because i i listen a certain
[2:02:06] organization the other day because i let
[2:02:08] another minister sit on the platform not
[2:02:10] preaching
[2:02:13] just sit
[2:02:14] down this is brother browner
[2:02:16] i said in organization the other day
[2:02:17] because i let another minister sit on
[2:02:19] the platform that didn't belong to the
[2:02:21] organization said we have drawn a line
[2:02:24] and we have drawn you out of it
[2:02:27] but i'm saying out of our circle
[2:02:31] but said i said i'm joined another one
[2:02:35] so big
[2:02:36] and take you back in again
[2:02:38] so you just can't push me out
[2:02:41] i will draw a line over the top of yours
[2:02:44] and take you right back
[2:02:48] that son of god
[2:02:50] that is christian
[2:02:52] that is minister of the gospel
[2:02:57] god stop
[2:02:58] now
[2:03:00] we are brethren
[2:03:02] we are not divided
[2:03:04] all one body we
[2:03:06] we are christians born of his spirit
[2:03:08] washington is blood
[2:03:10] we are christians we should act like
[2:03:13] christians we should behave ourselves
[2:03:15] like christians
[2:03:17] let me tell you one thing that the
[2:03:18] church is lacking today is behaving like
[2:03:20] christians
[2:03:22] that's what i've been preaching for the
[2:03:23] longest why
[2:03:25] hallelujah christian is not coming to
[2:03:28] church you have to behave like what
[2:03:41] we go wrong like dead flies
[2:03:44] no faith
[2:03:45] something is wrong
[2:03:47] hallelujah
[2:03:52] the sign official woman
[2:03:54] jesus is not fit to take the church but
[2:03:56] encounter the dogs
[2:03:57] talk about jesus she say the dogs get
[2:03:59] their crumbs we know that
[2:04:01] he said say something loyal
[2:04:03] say something real that's the way to get
[2:04:05] rid of devils
[2:04:07] he never prayed for the girl she never
[2:04:09] said one thing about her being healed he
[2:04:11] just said for this saying
[2:04:12] oh hallelujah so you could see the
[2:04:15] writing and devil's this pack up shop
[2:04:17] and they know
[2:04:18] oh my oh my oh my
[2:04:21] hallelujah musician come on please here
[2:04:23] we go hallelujah
[2:04:25] so do you believe
[2:04:27] that the holy spirit going to pour out
[2:04:30] but abandon he said now what jesus said
[2:04:32] say to this mountain you have heard
[2:04:34] what's taking place that's the ministry
[2:04:36] we enter into now we are way up the road
[2:04:38] now soon the coming of the lord jesus we
[2:04:40] have got to have rapture and faith in
[2:04:42] the church
[2:04:43] listen that will be changed in a moment
[2:04:44] and with an eye or we will not go but
[2:04:47] don't you worry it will be there
[2:04:49] it will be there and when the power of
[2:04:51] this church rises it will bring the
[2:04:53] bedroom the power of that church rises
[2:04:55] it will bring the bedroom the power of
[2:04:57] that shall rise it will bring the other
[2:04:58] bedroom and then there will be a general
[2:05:00] direction we are looking forward to it
[2:05:02] so the prophet prophesied that the power
[2:05:04] going to rise in the church
[2:05:06] oh how many believe that
[2:05:08] which is the dynamics of this church
[2:05:11] which is the virtual powerful service
[2:05:13] it has to come into the church do you
[2:05:15] believe that promise
[2:05:17] hallelujah
[2:05:18] but abandon said
[2:05:20] angel of the lord i know the next thing
[2:05:22] is to happen is the restoration of the
[2:05:24] gifts of the church and it's the hardest
[2:05:26] thing i've had to do in this pioneering
[2:05:29] work is to do this
[2:05:30] god
[2:05:32] cannot give back the gifts to the church
[2:05:35] as long as his church is divided
[2:05:40] we have got to get the church together
[2:05:42] before the gifts can come
[2:05:44] and if all of the full gospel people
[2:05:46] could come in one at one accord there
[2:05:49] would be a revival that would shape the
[2:05:51] whole world and every spiritual gift
[2:05:55] would be in the church within an hour
[2:05:57] time after it took place
[2:06:00] signs and wonders that was done by the
[2:06:01] apostle would be a minor thing to what
[2:06:05] do if we could get the change together
[2:06:07] it's got to happen
[2:06:09] it will happen
[2:06:12] oh hallelujah
[2:06:14] he said it got to happen and he
[2:06:16] prophesied he said it will happen
[2:06:19] it may be after and pass off the scene
[2:06:21] but i want to put my word in this that
[2:06:23] you might know my voicing is oh blessed
[2:06:26] be the name of the lord
[2:06:27] hallelujah
[2:06:29] hallelujah
[2:06:30] oh praise god he said they've got they
[2:06:32] have been brides brides brides but
[2:06:34] they've got to come one that not only
[2:06:36] have the mechanics but the dynamics oh
[2:06:38] hallelujah dynamics and mechanics
[2:06:41] together oh blessed be the name of the
[2:06:42] lord do you believe that
[2:06:44] praise god praise god he said there were
[2:06:47] cows in the upper room but all of a
[2:06:49] sudden the dynamics come what did they
[2:06:51] do it not only felt their spirit but it
[2:06:53] quickened their mechanics their bodies
[2:06:55] were quickened there were no more
[2:06:56] cowards they went straight into the face
[2:06:58] of the people he said you men and judea
[2:07:00] you dwell in jerusalem before the
[2:07:02] dynamics come they were just mechanics
[2:07:04] but when the holy ghost came upon them
[2:07:06] they quickened inside them
[2:07:08] oh the whole being was changed
[2:07:11] inside change they were so quick and
[2:07:13] that their tongues changed they spoke in
[2:07:15] another language they were so quick and
[2:07:18] when they lay hands on upon the sick the
[2:07:20] sick had to recover
[2:07:22] that's the quickening power that is what
[2:07:24] this promise may the lord bless you as

[2:19:34] opportunity to worship and share and i
[2:19:36] want us to put our hands together
[2:19:37] brother jason
