[0:53] paul an apostle of jesus christ by the
[0:55] will of god
[0:56] to the saints which are at ephesus and
[0:58] to the faithful in christ jesus
[1:00] grace be to you and peace from god our
[1:03] father
[1:03] and from the lord jesus christ blessed
[1:06] be the god and father of our lord jesus
[1:08] christ who has blessed us with all
[1:10] spiritual blessings in heavenly places
[1:12] in christ
[1:13] according as he hath chosen us in him
[1:15] before the foundation of the world
[1:17] that we should be holy and without blame
[1:19] before him in love
[1:21] having predestinated us unto the
[1:23] adoption of children by jesus christ
[1:25] to himself according to the good
[1:27] pleasure of his will
[1:28] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[1:31] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[1:33] beloved
[1:34] in whom we have redemption through his
[1:36] blood
[1:37] the forgiveness of sins according to the
[1:39] riches of his grace
[1:41] wherein he ether bounded toward us in
[1:42] all wisdom and prudence
[1:44] having made known unto us the mystery of
[1:46] his will according to his good pleasure
[1:48] which he has purposed in himself
[1:52] but we're promised according to
[1:54] revelations 10 and according to malachi
[1:56] 4 and
[1:57] saint luke 22 17 and so forth that there
[2:00] is
[2:00] got to come an ephesians to this
[2:04] there is promise to pray there must come
[2:08] an ephesians that these
[2:12] seven full mysteries of the word of god
[2:15] must be unfolded and it's in the ladies
[2:19] and age
[2:20] that this takes place i believe that
[2:23] we're
[2:24] we're there i believe we're right
[2:27] in the shadows of the coming of the son
[2:30] of god
[2:32] and at joshua just before
[2:36] uh the ephesians uh raised up so did
[2:39] john the baptist raise up just before
[2:42] the next ephesians
[2:43] and were promised another
[2:47] another uh ephesians is predicted here
[2:50] in the scripture
[2:51] therefore i think that we are living
[2:54] in the ephesians again
[2:58] back again we are promised
[3:01] that what was left off during those
[3:03] seven ages
[3:05] now you cannot add nothing to the book
[3:07] or take nothing from it revelations
[3:08] 22 18 says so whoever will add
[3:12] one word or take one word this part will
[3:15] be taken from the book of life
[3:17] now we cannot add or take so therefore
[3:19] we know that
[3:20] luther could not get to it west end and
[3:23] so forth the reformers not spending
[3:24] calvin
[3:25] on down so forth they didn't get it all
[3:27] but what they had was the gospel truth
[3:30] but now in the last days we are given
[3:32] the understanding by the word
[3:35] that we are going to understand it
[3:36] because is there a common ephesian age
[3:39] to it
