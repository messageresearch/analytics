[48:44] not caral you can't fight the devil with
[48:47] your car your house your money your bank

[48:56] carnality
[48:57] he's once you're going in the carnal
[48:59] realm you defeated already once you go
[49:02] in natural realm because the Bible
[49:04] teaches us we wrestle not against flesh
[49:06] and blood but against principalities and
[49:09] powers and spiritual wickedness so once
[49:11] you see me as the enemy you finish you
[49:14] you finish once you see your brother as
[49:15] the enemy you finish love your brother
[49:18] you might like the spirit that's in your
[49:19] brother or upon your brother but love
[49:21] him anyhow because that's your brother
[49:24] he might have a spirit on him or a
[49:26] spirit on a sister but is the spirit and
[49:28] them have them how they are all crippled
[49:30] up isn't that right so the sign of
[49:32] maturity brotherly kindness Spirit of
[49:34] forgiveness and ask a question why would
[49:37] God show this Prophet who was saved
[49:39] filled with the Holy Ghost about
[49:41] condemning a woman he said I forgive you
[49:43] you condemn her why would he open up to
[49:46] the Prophet this Spirit of Brotherly
[49:48] kindness and he said I saw what he
[49:52] meant this man is saved this man is a
[49:55] Prophet this man is filled with the Holy
[49:57] Ghost and yet God had to teach him the
[50:01] spirit of forgiveness a higher test was
[50:03] coming to him and the test was people
[50:05] coming to church carrying on and God
[50:07] dropped down if you say blind they blind
[50:09] they said death they death whatever you
[50:11] say going to happen to them let me see
[50:12] what you're going to do so I saying not
[50:15] only do you get test before you get
[50:16] power but you get test with power what
[50:19] you will do with the power that God
[50:21] going to release to you and many people
[50:23] don't understand this thing about power
[50:25] that's why you say power
[50:28] satanic men will mess up with power
[50:30] that's why God is reluctant to give man
[50:32] power because they will destroy other
[50:33] men so God have to look to see what Cali
[50:36] of man and Jesus himself demonstrated
[50:39] this forgiveness this power and his two
[50:41] incense I want to put to you this this
[50:43] morning just before we we have a special
[50:45] T I like to share with you this will be
[50:47] a continuation of Wednesday actually
[50:49] this tap will be to brotherly kindness
[50:50] at charity never preached on it before
[50:53] said some things I never said before and
[50:54] this was in Miami had a special Mission
[50:58] up there in a service up there and I
[51:00] preach two messages when finds his
[51:01] brotherly love and his second messages
[51:03] was and brotherly kindness at charity
[51:06] and I want that to come today certain
[51:08] things were said Wednesday night that
[51:09] never said before about the spirit of
[51:11] resentment and and and and Jesus when he
[51:14] was praying the Our Father prayer and he
[51:15] Amplified and if you forgive people
[51:17] their trespasses their Reckless and
[51:19] willful sins leaving them letting them
[51:22] go giving up resentment your heavenly
[51:25] father would also forgive you so part of
[51:29] this Spirit of forgiveness have to do
[51:31] with you giving up letting go the spirit
[51:34] of resentment now too many people want
[51:36] things to happen automatically they want
[51:38] no effort they just want life to work
[51:40] out and there's going to work out it
[51:41] doesn't work that way life have laws
[51:44] life have principles life have God's way
[51:47] of getting things done and God's way of
[51:49] getting things done is that you sit back
[51:51] relax like you having ease in Zion no
[51:54] the Bible said the kingdom is preached
[51:56] and Every Man Press their way into it
[51:58] and you have to understand whether you
[52:00] have a goal a business a target a job
[52:02] whatever you have to press your way into
[52:04] it whether it's a student and you want
[52:06] to achieve subjects you have to press
[52:08] your way if you just read the books and
[52:10] just take it casual you wouldn't get
[52:11] what you expect so you have to actually
[52:13] press your way both in mind and in
[52:16] spirit oh praise God you know I used to
[52:19] say I'm too old for this I'm too old for
[52:20] that I cancel all of that I Chang my
[52:21] mind on that Hallelujah I ain't all for
[52:24] nothing right now we're learning French
[52:26] I want to speak French by the time I go
[52:27] April I want to be able to talk French
[52:29] to them brothers I saw them when I first
[52:31] met them years ago they couldn't even
[52:33] talk English now they talk English just
[52:34] like me why can't I talk friend just
[52:36] like them but I have to be determined I
[52:38] have to believe I could do it I have to
[52:40] believe his old gry head could do better
[52:42] than that or give the Lord a shout in
[52:43] the house so I am not putting anything
[52:46] above me if I have to go back to school
[52:47] I'll go back to school if I have to
[52:49] there's all things are possible to them
[52:50] not believe I'm not going to stay and
[52:52] die and just just fade away and have my
[52:55] brains all rust know I'm going to do
[52:57] something about what God give me God
[52:58] give me a hand to raise a mouth to

[53:16] case he free me from my guilt he free me
[53:19] from my sins he free me from my past and
[53:21] I can't be happy you are to be a Madman
[53:23] oh give the Lord a shout in the way call
[53:26] her see that's the way I worship my God
[53:28] I'm not ashamed of the Gospel I'm not

[53:33] ashamed of his words oh glory to God
[53:36] give the Lord a shout in the
[53:37] [Applause]
[53:39] [Music]
[53:42] house may be
[53:44] seated so I know and I am
[53:48] convinced that without the spirit of
[53:50] forgiveness note my words now not the
[53:52] text of forgiveness not brother a
[53:55] thought have a thought tonight
[53:57] I know nothing about it can't forgive
[53:58] nobody at all just talking just talking
[54:00] we not talking about
[54:04] that resentment is a real thing you know
[54:07] yeah after a while years in marriage
[54:09] resentment come up H wife resent husband
[54:10] husband resent wife want to know what
[54:13] marry after they say I do they want to
[54:15] know what I done that of
[54:18] thing giving up resentment resentment a
[54:22] feeling of angry displeasure at
[54:24] something regarded as wrong insult or
[54:27] injury so you feel hurt and that's your
[54:30] feelings that's your emotions and that's
[54:33] what the devil do
[54:36] occupy so once you're feeling with
[54:38] feeling and emotions I feel so hurt if
[54:41] that woman who Jesus said is not fit to
[54:44] take the children's bread and cast them
[54:45] to dogs if she was going feelings all
[54:48] still V with the
[54:49] devil she Vex the daughter Vex the devil
[54:52] and all everybody Vex she Vex with the
[54:55] devil and but she stood the ground
[54:57] and even the dogs get Crum some of the
[54:59] master table she stood at grounds she
[55:01] wasn't backing down because those
[55:02] striving phes couldn't help her and you
[55:05] have to know that this gospel is the
[55:07] only thing on the earth that could help
[55:08] you not your uncle not your mother not
[55:11] your father not your grandmother not
[55:13] your grandfather is this word go help
[55:15] you because the word is God this word
[55:17] could transform your life this word have
[55:20] power in it and Satan hates it that's
[55:23] why you going to preach it to
[55:25] you the Lord some
[55:28] Praises all right almost done here so
[55:33] watch in a relationship a mixture of
[55:36] anger frustration bitterness that builds
[55:38] up over time
[55:39] resentment resentment is when you hold
[55:41] on to the
[55:43] anger at not being treated as well as
[55:47] you think you
[55:49] deserve you hold on to that instead of
[55:52] letting it
[55:53] go I tell you years ago when I had my
[55:56] juice I make my juice I don't want me
[55:57] touch my juice you know I love my juice
[55:59] you know when I come home from work and
[56:02] I open the fridge and that juice missing
[56:04] and you know people need
[56:10] homes but after a while it doesn't
[56:12] matter who you
[56:14] choose you
[56:16] grow you learn and you know this
[56:20] resentment thing come out so powerful
[56:22] for me because it's almost like if I got
[56:24] an experience with this mage that I
[56:26] preach unto brotherly kindness at
[56:28] charity because I recognize sometimes
[56:31] people offend you people lie on you
[56:33] people act nasty towards you and you
[56:35] could develop a complex the complex is
[56:38] not by the personal the complex is in
[56:40] your mind you forgive them you know but
[56:43] you cannot deal with them you cannot
[56:45] relate to them you cannot connect with
[56:47] them because there is something in your
[56:49] mind well God free me from that so now I
[56:52] could ride for you oh praise the name of
[56:55] the Lord again free because I recognized
[56:58] I had the problem not them other words
[57:00] they hurt me they lie they whatever it
[57:03] is that is not the issue the Forgiveness
[57:06] part is not just the issue because look
[57:07] at brother brandham he was condemning
[57:09] that woman because he was looking
[57:11] through his
[57:12] eyes is this what my child grow up in
[57:15] look at the condition of that woman with
[57:17] other men and car why God why don't you
[57:19] just judges place what in your Purity
[57:23] and you feeling the anointing upon him
[57:25] now God in your righteousness why don't
[57:28] you condemn this place God tap him on
[57:32] his shoulder show him his sins show him
[57:35] the bumper show him his forgiveness show
[57:37] him God put pardon and God told him with
[57:39] a serious voice I forgive you amen and
[57:44] you condemn her amen that's all and he
[57:46] know what he had to do do you know what
[57:49] you have to do this morning I'm not
[57:51] hearing you I am not hearing you I want
[57:54] to hear you
[57:59] Hallelujah because when you get this
[58:01] breakthrough you can go and see enemy
[58:02] you know after that I could have go
[58:05] by Oh Glory to God I can go by anybody
[58:08] now you know and I go in you know I'm
[58:10] going to knock on the door there see me
[58:12] for years but I come hey Hallelujah let
[58:16] them have the problem now let them have
[58:18] the fight now praise God I could love my
[58:20] enemies now I could go the extra mile
[58:23] now I could go beyond where I've gone
[58:25] before oh it's 50 mes a Elbow Room woo
[58:30] Hallelujah Faith have Liberty now
[58:33] because Faith here we go is based on
[58:36] forgiveness oh give the Lord a praise do
[58:39] you get that church Hallelujah now you
[58:42] cannot experience forgiveness by
[58:44] yourself I forgive me and you're by
[58:47] yourself that makes no sense you have to
[58:50] experience forgiveness in a group and
[58:53] that is where the Prophet talk about
[58:55] when the Church finds is Bradly love so
[58:58] in a group where there will be issues
[59:00] challenges different personalities
[59:01] backgrounds and so on like that where
[59:03] you have that honey it look like it
[59:06] won't stick but it will stick I'm going
[59:09] to sign off right there so therefore you
[59:11] could come out your resentment and
[59:13] forgive for Christ's sake oh blessed be
[59:17] the name of the Lord and I got a little
[59:19] testimony here I like to read there but
[59:20] over it I want to thank uh want I didn't
[59:22] want to even to to express my gratitude
[59:25] for your prayer for the situation of our
[59:26] loved one some Kell out we spoke to her
[59:29] your video last night and found and and
[59:32] she was in a virtual pray meeting and so
[59:35] on and the positive spirit and attitud
[59:37] she projected give her strength on
[59:39] another note earlier just after supper
[59:43] his wife zida excitedly showed me a
[59:45] scripture that was inspired to her in
[59:48] prayer during the day it was the weapon
[59:51] of our Warfare and not caral so this one
[59:54] BW my mind late as we waited for our
[59:57] prayer meeting to start she she
[1:00:00] expressed to me I saw today that we need
[1:00:02] to look at the invisible not the things
[1:00:05] that we see with our eyes nless to say
[1:00:08] she was very moved when you started with
[1:00:10] the same scripture and began to express
[1:00:13] some of the same things she expressed to
[1:00:14] me earlier today she wanted to hear the
[1:00:17] last night's exaltation again so we did
[1:00:20] so tonight just as about an hour ago and
[1:00:22] we have been greatly strengthened and
[1:00:24] grateful for all those words spoken
[1:00:26] weapons of warfare are not carnal
[1:00:31] there's a devil we have to fight the
[1:00:33] Bible call it Warfare Warfare is not one
[1:00:36] bullet boom and War over that's not
[1:00:38] Warfare no no no Warfare is a constant
[1:00:41] kind of thing you're ducking you're
[1:00:43] thinging but you have to fight and
[1:00:45] that's why I had to put on the whole
[1:00:46] armor of God that's why you have to get
[1:00:47] in the spirit and get out your stinking
[1:00:50] flesh get out the Envy the jealousy the
[1:00:52] malice all that things you have to give
[1:00:54] up Paul wasn't exalting unbelievers he
[1:00:57] was exalting church folks about what to
[1:01:00] do let go bitterness and let go anger
[1:01:03] let him that steal they stealing
[1:01:05] Believers now letting him not steal
[1:01:07] steal no more who he's talking to he's
[1:01:09] not talking about old Thief outside he's
[1:01:10] talking about Thief inside the church
[1:01:12] let him not steal steal no more oh get
[1:01:14] the Lord some don't say Amen now it's
[1:01:16] still the word I'm preaching don't

[1:01:19] know who I'm talking about I ain't call
[1:01:21] nobody no Thief inside of here you know
[1:01:23] but Paul was addressing people in the
[1:01:24] church because they want to get the life
[1:01:27] line up straighten up and that's what we
[1:01:29] want inside of here your life must line
[1:01:31] up and straighten up you must want God
[1:01:34] you must want truth you must want
[1:01:36] righteousness you must want the order of

[1:08:21] night spoke on a
[1:08:23] message when the church finds it
[1:08:25] brotherly
[1:08:28] love and it's a
[1:08:30] prophecy and brother did
[1:08:34] prophesy that that coin will be
[1:08:38] missing and we see that
[1:08:41] today we see the
[1:08:43] bitterness the
[1:08:46] hatred the
[1:08:50] disunity the
[1:08:53] Discord in this message
[1:08:57] actually I'm going to read it but the
[1:09:00] prophet said there' be no love left but
[1:09:03] among the
[1:09:07] elect so
[1:09:10] somehow
[1:09:11] Lucifer Satan has invaded this
[1:09:16] message to break brotherly
[1:09:19] love to break
[1:09:21] unity and the prophet said we have to
[1:09:25] get into the unity of the
[1:09:28] spirit while we are waiting for the
[1:09:30] unity of the
[1:09:32] faith did you get that we have to get
[1:09:36] the unity of the
[1:09:37] spirit the unity of the spirit have
[1:09:41] nothing to do with
[1:09:43] Doctrine it has nothing to do with
[1:09:47] belief it has to do with the spirit that
[1:09:49] is in the
[1:09:51] man what type of
[1:09:53] spirit amen amen amen amen and the
[1:09:57] prophet and be speaking about the spirit
[1:09:59] of Brotherly
[1:10:01] Love this
[1:10:03] issue is not a new
[1:10:05] issue this issue Jesus had to deal with
[1:10:10] it the disciple came and asked
[1:10:13] Jesus how much time must I forgive my
[1:10:17] brother should I give him seven times a
[1:10:20] day that was a issue and Jesus answered
[1:10:24] that not seven times a day but 70 times
[1:10:29] seven These
[1:10:32] Guys these men didn't have the Holy
[1:10:36] Ghost
[1:10:37] yet they didn't have the love
[1:10:40] yet they didn't have the charity
[1:10:43] yet that was a
[1:10:45] promise behold I send the
[1:10:48] promise of my father upon
[1:10:51] you now understand this the choosen
[1:10:56] wasn't those disciples
[1:10:59] choosing Jesus make the
[1:11:02] choos he got a tax
[1:11:06] collector nobody loves the tax
[1:11:09] collector but Jesus
[1:11:12] chose oh Hallelujah Jesus chose the
[1:11:17] fisherman and Jes and Jesus chose
[1:11:21] you whoever you are
[1:11:25] so when the tax
[1:11:27] collector is in front the
[1:11:30] service and Jesus said turn around and
[1:11:33] greet your
[1:11:37] brother do you see what happening there
[1:11:39] now when Peter go to put his hand like
[1:11:42] that you pull back your hand because you
[1:11:45] have nothing to do with that you don't
[1:11:47] want but Jesus call
[1:11:49] him he call you as you
[1:11:52] are whe he was a drunker
[1:11:55] whether it was a
[1:11:56] drunkard an

[1:12:04] liar whatever condition you are
[1:12:07] in God call

[1:12:23] see they don't feel what you
[1:12:27] feel they didn't go through what you
[1:12:29] went
[1:12:31] through but God called all of
[1:12:34] you and told you to love one
[1:12:39] another
[1:12:41] amen and Jesus he demonstrated this when
[1:12:46] he went and washed the

[1:19:38] God for the seven
[1:19:41] spirits as it come down not 20
[1:19:45] steps not 50 steps just seven steps and
[1:19:50] Peter identified those
[1:19:52] steps Faith to brotherly kindness
[1:19:55] are seven
[1:19:57] steps then the Holy Spirit could come
[1:20:00] down on brotherly
[1:20:03] kindness so brotherly kindness is the is
[1:20:07] that
[1:20:08] outlet that could access the spirit of
[1:20:12] God so God put brotherly
[1:20:14] kindness as our
[1:20:17] virtue that must be
[1:20:20] displayed he called that the blood
[1:20:25] Jude in the book of Jude we read that
[1:20:28] Thursday
[1:20:29] night he said and of some have
[1:20:33] compassion making a
[1:20:36] difference between bad spirit and BR
[1:20:39] Beast
[1:20:42] people and struggling weak
[1:20:45] [Music]
[1:20:47] SCS it is
[1:20:50] tremendous that God
[1:20:52] choose to put that book of
[1:20:56] Jude just before the Book of
[1:20:59] Revelation just before the Book of
[1:21:02] Revelation is this book of
[1:21:04] Jude that speaks about the Faith
[1:21:08] Delivered and speak about an some of
[1:21:13] compassion in other words brotherly
[1:21:16] kindness that Spirit give you
[1:21:20] access to that
[1:21:23] Revelation that book of re
[1:21:26] that's the true
[1:21:27] Spirit now we talk about
[1:21:30] truth truth is a
[1:21:33] person truth is more than
[1:21:37] information Jesus used the
[1:21:41] terminology the spirit of
[1:21:44] truth because when the devil was
[1:21:47] speaking to
[1:21:48] Jesus quoting the
[1:21:53] scripture qu
[1:21:57] wasn't coming from the spirit of
[1:22:00] Truth the devil was telling
[1:22:02] Jesus if thou be the Son of
[1:22:05] God jump down because the word
[1:22:10] say he shall give his angels charge over
[1:22:13] thee when the devil is
[1:22:16] speaking that's not the spirit of
[1:22:19] Truth he is quoting
[1:22:22] information and he is quoting knowledge
[1:22:26] so there is the truth and there's the
[1:22:28] spirit of
[1:22:30] Truth there is brotherly kindness and
[1:22:33] there's the spirit of Brotherly
[1:22:35] kindness or the spirit of
[1:22:37] forgiveness and when we get in the
[1:22:41] spirit of
[1:22:42] forgiveness you put
[1:22:45] yourself in your brother place on the
[1:22:49] matter in other words you put on his
[1:22:52] shoes
[1:22:54] to
[1:22:56] experience why he is walking this
[1:23:00] way because there was something in his
[1:23:03] shoes that you don't know so you can't
[1:23:06] just look and
[1:23:08] judge you can't just look and
[1:23:12] condemn you put
[1:23:14] yourself in your sister's place in your
[1:23:18] brother's place and then you can
[1:23:21] effectively
[1:23:22] pray for your brother
[1:23:25] or for your sister oh give the Lord some
[1:23:29] Praises amen
[1:23:31] listen it doesn't
[1:23:35] matter what they do to
[1:23:38] you
[1:23:41] amen God is Not testing

[1:23:59] amen can you let it
[1:24:03] go amen I am still
[1:24:08] learning I am still
[1:24:10] growing amen I am
[1:24:13] learning and I am still growing amen
[1:24:17] amen because there are people that have
[1:24:18] done
[1:24:19] things and said things and said lies
[1:24:23] about me
[1:24:24] I don't hold against
[1:24:26] them but somehow it gets a
[1:24:30] block this person said that about
[1:24:33] me now that doesn't stop
[1:24:36] me from praying for
[1:24:38] them because that's a
[1:24:40] way of keeping Spirits
[1:24:44] off you cannot pray from some for
[1:24:47] somebody that you cannot love amen you
[1:24:51] cannot
[1:24:52] amen amen
[1:24:55] amen when brother went to
[1:24:58] India there's a man that was
[1:25:00] blind from worshiping the
[1:25:03] Sun and he had no
[1:25:05] shoes and the first thing B
[1:25:08] did was to take off his
[1:25:10] shoes to see if the man could fit
[1:25:14] his because here in his heart he says
[1:25:17] wanting to be
[1:25:18] blind but he has no
[1:25:21] shoes in other words the comp
[1:25:25] open up in
[1:25:27] him to be effective to that
[1:25:30] man do you understand what I'm saying
[1:25:33] one time a
[1:25:35] woman she was waiting to to come up in
[1:25:38] the prayer
[1:25:39] line she had a baby that was
[1:25:42] sick the sister next to
[1:25:45] her asked if she could pray for the
[1:25:48] baby and the woman said
[1:25:50] fine and the sister next to her prayed
[1:25:54] for the the child and when the woman I
[1:25:56] think when the woman came up but says
[1:26:00] the child is healed he said God
[1:26:04] saw that woman had more
[1:26:08] compassion and God put it another
[1:26:10] woman's
[1:26:12] heart to pray for the
[1:26:14] child this is real this is not just
[1:26:18] words it has to live in us this has to
[1:26:22] become part of us
[1:26:24] this word must become
[1:26:27] flesh this word is not talking talking
[1:26:32] talking it's not sharing sharing
[1:26:35] sharing this word has to become
[1:26:39] alive in you and
[1:26:41] I could we give the Lord a praise amen
[1:26:44] Amen brother Bram seven CH
[1:26:48] ages seven
[1:26:51] steps God building his church
[1:26:54] is like one person into an
[1:26:58] [Music]
[1:26:59] individual and when you surrender your
[1:27:01] complete
[1:27:03] being then the Holy
[1:27:05] Spirit just pours into
[1:27:08] you through
[1:27:11] you in these
[1:27:13] virtues then you are a living
[1:27:17] Tabernacle then the
[1:27:19] people would say that's a man full of
[1:27:22] virtue
[1:27:25] knowledge Temperance full of the love of
[1:27:28] the Holy
[1:27:29] Ghost then they can say that's a
[1:27:31] Christian that's a real
[1:27:34] Christian you never seen a
[1:27:37] Kinder
[1:27:39] sweeter goder
[1:27:41] person you are
[1:27:44] sealed now listen to this when a man a
[1:27:49] woman possesses
[1:27:52] this what he's talking about
[1:27:55] these seven
[1:27:57] steps then the Capstone comes
[1:28:02] down and seals them into the kingdom of
[1:28:06] God then you are sealed with the Seal of
[1:28:11] love and Paul call
[1:28:14] love the bond of
[1:28:16] [Music]
[1:28:18] perfectness praise the name of the Lord
[1:28:21] seven
[1:28:22] steps but said in the Feast of the
[1:28:26] trumpets watch go into the prophet's
[1:28:30] chamber and watch them seven
[1:28:33] steps where did the god meet the
[1:28:35] challenge to bring the com into the
[1:28:36] presence of the
[1:28:38] king where where does they bring where
[1:28:41] do you have to
[1:28:42] stand to get into the presence of the
[1:28:45] King on the seventh
[1:28:48] step there are seven steps what's the
[1:28:51] seventh
[1:28:52] step brotherly love
[1:28:55] so in other words like Queen Esther you
[1:28:58] know the story she couldn't go in until
[1:29:02] the king call her she knew she not
[1:29:04] supposed to go
[1:29:05] in but she said
[1:29:08] herself if I perish I perish I'm going
[1:29:13] in but she was dressed
[1:29:16] right she was looking
[1:29:19] right Hallelujah so when she's accepting
[1:29:23] the the k
[1:29:25] when Esther get on that seventh
[1:29:28] step and there's a Esther here
[1:29:31] today the bride she is Queen
[1:29:35] Esther and you're going to get on that
[1:29:37] seventh
[1:29:39] step and the King said what I'm what you
[1:29:41] want me to do for you I I hand him the
[1:29:45] scepter put the anointing upon you
[1:29:48] because you are now on that seventh
[1:29:50] step isn't that something go praise the
[1:29:53] name of the Lord
[1:29:55] L he talking about this spirit is seven
[1:29:59] steps going to the king's
[1:30:02] chamber watch on the seventh
[1:30:05] step what takes out to take the uncomon
[1:30:08] to introduce the
[1:30:11] king and listen to this key here watch
[1:30:14] those who
[1:30:16] station that is standing there and you
[1:30:19] will see the day you are living in the
[1:30:26] pyramid so he's
[1:30:28] prophesying that one day you going to
[1:30:32] realize you are actually living in the
[1:30:35] pyramid what step are we supposed to be
[1:30:38] on the step of Brotherly kindness what
[1:30:42] is the battle in this
[1:30:44] message the pastors are
[1:30:46] saying the Lord delay is
[1:30:51] coming they're not preaching that you
[1:30:53] know but when you say that you could
[1:30:56] fight one another you could battle with
[1:30:59] one another because
[1:31:01] Jesus he's not coming now let's fight
[1:31:05] let's battle but God the a true
[1:31:09] Minister would say the Lord has
[1:31:12] descended with a
[1:31:14] shout amen amen so I'm talking about why
[1:31:17] wasn't the Caps put on The
[1:31:20] Headstone because it was rejected
[1:31:25] prophecy but it will be
[1:31:27] capped so this
[1:31:29] Capstone is
[1:31:31] ordained to come upon this
[1:31:34] bride do you
[1:31:36] understand this Stone was
[1:31:39] rejected this L stone this love Stone
[1:31:44] praise the name of the Lord praise God
[1:31:47] hallelujah give him some
[1:31:49] Praises amen amen amen amen glory to God
[1:31:54] Hallelujah soam says we God sent us a
[1:31:58] Seven
[1:32:00] Seals and send seven angels down from
[1:32:03] heaven to bring back the scattered
[1:32:06] word what to tie back into the
[1:32:09] word to bring down the holy spirit so
[1:32:13] the
[1:32:14] objective of the Seven
[1:32:17] Seals is to bring down the Holy
[1:32:21] Ghost we as men
[1:32:24] can't do
[1:32:25] anything God have to come down we are
[1:32:30] preaching a message sent from
[1:32:33] God brother bam he will send us a true
[1:32:37] prophet of the true
[1:32:40] word with a message to the return of the
[1:32:44] original faith of the
[1:32:46] fathers to bring down the power of the
[1:32:48] Holy
[1:32:50] Ghost do you see it now our objective
[1:32:54] of coming to church is to get to the
[1:32:57] Holy Ghost
[1:32:59] Land church is only the
[1:33:02] means of reconciling Hearts to
[1:33:06] God you not staying here
[1:33:09] permanently this is a
[1:33:12] temporary temporary holding
[1:33:16] day till we all
[1:33:20] come into the unity of the
[1:33:22] faith into of the Son of
[1:33:25] God into a perfect man Oh Praise Him of
[1:33:29] the Lord Brother BR I'm getting
[1:33:32] somewhere just bear with me a little
[1:33:34] bit I'm using a
[1:33:37] background he say in the time is this
[1:33:41] the
[1:33:42] mystery of the
[1:33:44] Thunders that will bring back The
[1:33:47] Headstone you know that you know the
[1:33:50] pyramid was never
[1:33:52] capped it may be the
[1:33:55] time for the rainbow to sweep across the
[1:33:59] skies praise God is that really them
[1:34:02] seven
[1:34:04] Thunders fixing to UT out
[1:34:07] something that the little group the ga
[1:34:10] together will receive Rapture in
[1:34:13] faith now hear this you remember the
[1:34:16] Prem
[1:34:17] message what did it
[1:34:20] do oh no I'm back up a little bit time
[1:34:22] shall be no more
[1:34:24] he announces that time is over what
[1:34:27] happens if that be so seriously
[1:34:30] think if it is then the pyramid is
[1:34:35] capped by the seventh ters I didn't see
[1:34:39] it the prophet said it the pyramid is
[1:34:42] capped by the seven
[1:34:45] tenders so he's identifying the seven
[1:34:47] tenders as the
[1:34:49] Capstone of Jesus Christ and this
[1:34:52] Capstone
[1:34:54] have to be in
[1:34:55] mechanics mechanics and
[1:34:58] Dynamics Oh Glory to God mechanics and

[1:47:58] indeed amen amen amen amen glory to God
[1:48:03] all right watch
[1:48:06] this oh I read here now Ezekiel 36
[1:48:11] said a new heart I will give
[1:48:14] you a new spirit I'll put within
[1:48:16] you then I'll put my spirit within you
[1:48:20] now brother he say he gives you new
[1:48:23] heart why the heart we born
[1:48:27] with is against
[1:48:29] God so that's why he draws
[1:48:33] you and give you a new something
[1:48:37] to then the reason to give you a new
[1:48:40] spirit is to get along with the Holy
[1:48:45] Ghost listen to this many times you get
[1:48:50] the new
[1:48:51] spirit think you got the holy
[1:48:56] spirit so first God give a new heart I
[1:49:00] want to serve the Lord you
[1:49:01] know like this year for
[1:49:04] me I think February
[1:49:06] 15th is 50
[1:49:09] years since I give my life to Jesus
[1:49:12] Christ I was 17 years old when I give my
[1:49:16] heart to the
[1:49:17] Lord and when I came back home after
[1:49:19] getting
[1:49:21] baptized and I told my cousin I've been
[1:49:24] baptized in Jesus
[1:49:25] name he tell me give me six months in
[1:49:28] that
[1:49:29] religion and words came up my
[1:49:32] mouth I say you don't hold
[1:49:36] time and you give me six months but now
[1:49:40] it's 50
[1:49:41] years and I'm still
[1:49:43] pumping Hallelujah 50 years Hallelujah
[1:49:48] am and the devil can't stop what God
[1:49:52] have started
[1:49:53] and the
[1:49:55] work what have started in
[1:49:57] you he is able to complete
[1:50:00] it don't give up on
[1:50:02] God don't give up on God hallelujah give
[1:50:15] praise that new
[1:50:17] spirit God had to give
[1:50:20] you a new spirit
[1:50:23] to get along with his
[1:50:26] spirit because some people are so
[1:50:30] mean they can't even get along with
[1:50:35] themselves much less when God
[1:50:40] come some people are so
[1:50:43] terrible the sister can't stand
[1:50:46] them the
[1:50:48] brother
[1:50:51] miserable so God have to change that and
[1:50:55] give you a new
[1:50:56] spirit that could work with the Holy
[1:50:59] Ghost so therefore the brotherly
[1:51:02] kindness
[1:51:05] Spirit has been
[1:51:07] released that we could work with the
[1:51:09] love of
[1:51:10] God because the Bible say how you could
[1:51:13] claim to love
[1:51:15] God and hat your
[1:51:20] brother do you see it now
[1:51:23] you can't
[1:51:25] say I love
[1:51:32] Jesus and you're just singing oh I love
[1:51:35] Jesus but you're
[1:51:38] vexed you're
[1:51:41] angry brother you don't want
[1:51:44] [Music]
[1:51:48] see you see you see your brother
[1:51:56] Tre because you have issues with
[1:51:59] that so the spirit ofly
[1:52:02] kindness was
[1:52:04] released to to work with the love of
[1:52:08] God the bride
[1:52:11] Church must come to the honey of
[1:52:13] Brotherly
[1:52:16] Love now this is not but coach I'm
[1:52:18] sharing some thoughts that I have
[1:52:21] here the Church must come into the
[1:52:24] spirit of
[1:52:26] forgiveness God has to see brotherly
[1:52:31] love how can we really approach the love
[1:52:34] of
[1:52:36] God because some point in
[1:52:39] time we have to be able to approach the
[1:52:42] love of
[1:52:43] God just like Esther had was
[1:52:47] approaching so the pyramid is Brad at
[1:52:51] the bottom
[1:52:54] but as it goes to the top it get
[1:52:57] narrow and people
[1:52:59] fall fall off now when a word
[1:53:04] comes if you turn down that
[1:53:08] word you cut off
[1:53:11] God in other words if forgiveness comes
[1:53:14] now God wants you to
[1:53:17] forgive God want you to drop your
[1:53:20] o if you
[1:53:23] if you have issues with people in the
[1:53:24] church if you have
[1:53:26] issues brothers and sisters in the
[1:53:28] church after the service is over go to
[1:53:32] them and make it
[1:53:35] right even if they are
[1:53:38] wrong you forgive
[1:53:41] them
[1:53:43] amen amen amen so the P the pyramid gets
[1:53:47] narrow on the
[1:53:50] top on the top
[1:53:53] is where you have brotherly
[1:53:55] kindness and faith that is based upon
[1:53:59] forgiveness because it will take
[1:54:02] Faith to catch the
[1:54:04] [Music]
[1:54:05] headstone the Capstone of
[1:54:08] Love do you get that now William Bram
[1:54:12] came to turn our
[1:54:14] hearts back to the Fai of the
[1:54:17] father what for to catch
[1:54:21] love will take Faith to pull down the
[1:54:24] love of
[1:54:25] God praise the god amen hallelujah
[1:54:28] hallelujah no brother Bram he
[1:54:31] interpreted this scripture here this
[1:54:34] way when that which is perfect is
[1:54:37] come that which is in part is done
[1:54:41] with and
[1:54:43] today by God's
[1:54:46] help the perfect interpretation of the
[1:54:49] word
[1:54:52] Divine
[1:54:55] Vindication he said we have that which
[1:54:57] is perfect is
[1:54:59] come the perfect interpretation of the
[1:55:04] word with Divine
[1:55:07] Vindication then that which is in part
[1:55:09] is done away
[1:55:11] with you ever hear the statement in the
[1:55:13] time of ignorance God
[1:55:15] [Music]
[1:55:17] wink I know in
[1:55:20] part I prophesy in part
[1:55:22] [Music]
[1:55:24] so when things are in
[1:55:26] part the whole is not
[1:55:30] required because the whole has not been
[1:55:34] revealed or
[1:55:37] unfolded but when that which is perfect
[1:55:39] is
[1:55:40] com you can't talk about part no
[1:55:44] more and that's what Jesus did the
[1:55:47] Scribe and
[1:55:49] Pharisees they had the documents with
[1:55:51] Moses and the qu
[1:55:53] [Music]
[1:55:54] and but the documents and the quotes and
[1:55:57] the
[1:55:59] prophecies was prophesied of the
[1:56:02] Messiah so when Jesus steep on the
[1:56:06] scene the light is now
[1:56:09] here and these guys who didn't walk in
[1:56:13] the
[1:56:13] light they walk straight in the
[1:56:16] darkness because the Fulfillment was
[1:56:18] just before the very
[1:56:20] eye are you with me
[1:56:22] so when says when that which is perfect
[1:56:25] is
[1:56:26] come and we have it the the perfect
[1:56:30] interpretation of the
[1:56:32] word with Divine
[1:56:36] Vindication men
[1:56:38] ministers take this and interpret this
[1:56:42] it to
[1:56:43] mean we have
[1:56:45] Mysteries we have plenty
[1:56:48] Revelations plenty things to preach and
[1:56:50] unfold but is the a little more than
[1:56:53] that it's not just this I'm going show
[1:56:56] you why but had an
[1:56:59] experience we talk about it a little bit
[1:57:02] I want to read part of it for you this
[1:57:04] morning with this
[1:57:06] bull you know he came out his
[1:57:08] vehicle he was passing through a field
[1:57:10] to pray for
[1:57:12] someone and this big
[1:57:14] bull stepped
[1:57:16] up he said I looked at the
[1:57:20] fence it was too far to run
[1:57:24] so he's
[1:57:25] human see the B he remember it's a
[1:57:29] killer look at
[1:57:31] the then he remember he forget the gun
[1:57:34] in the car
[1:57:37] and as a human being he said he was
[1:57:41] going to shoot the B and pay for
[1:57:44] it watch this now and here he
[1:57:48] come something happened
[1:57:53] so this not a
[1:58:00] text perfect
[1:58:05] [Music]
[1:58:08] Vindication he didn't talk Mysteries to
[1:58:10] the
[1:58:11] B he spoke I call it bull
[1:58:16] language the language of
[1:58:18] love but listen to what happen when he's
[1:58:22] looking
[1:58:23] around to run or get a
[1:58:25] Gun there's nothing there something
[1:58:29] happened I
[1:58:31] wish that it would happen all the
[1:58:35] time so he's not talking about a text or
[1:58:39] thought he talking about an
[1:58:42] experience and as the B was standing
[1:58:44] there 20 yards from
[1:58:47] me great long
[1:58:50] horns instead of hating that
[1:58:54] bull I loved
[1:58:56] him I wish I could explain
[1:58:59] it but let me tell you something brother
[1:59:02] you will never come in
[1:59:04] contact with a greater force in this
[1:59:09] life than
[1:59:11] love I do not try to conquer Demons by
[1:59:14] kicking
[1:59:17] them I I love
[1:59:20] God love
[1:59:23] is what God
[1:59:24] is God is
[1:59:27] love love is what
[1:59:29] conquers and when this big fellow
[1:59:31] started toward watchs
[1:59:34] me I know it would be de in a few
[1:59:38] moments something
[1:59:40] happened there was something happened to
[1:59:43] me and I love them I thought poor
[1:59:47] fellow he was
[1:59:49] asleep I'm on his ground I ought to be
[1:59:53] here and I said look fellow you are
[1:59:56] God's creative
[1:59:58] being I am God's
[2:00:00] servant I'm on my road to

[2:05:33] anyhow whether he agrees with you or
[2:05:36] not you would love him
[2:05:39] anyhow that is the consecrated
[2:05:42] life I don't want to hurt your
[2:05:46] feelings but I've got to stand with you
[2:05:48] on judgment
[2:05:50] someday I'm responsible for telling the
[2:05:54] truth many will come to me in that
[2:05:57] day and say Lord have I done this in my
[2:06:01] name in your name he will say depart
[2:06:04] from
[2:06:06] me
[2:06:08] notice this
[2:06:10] bull rushed towards
[2:06:12] me and he run until 5et of
[2:06:17] me no I don't know about you but if I
[2:06:20] see that b
[2:06:24] I don't think I'm standing to wait to
[2:06:27] see I will be
[2:06:30] running as fast as I could using
[2:06:34] [Music]
[2:06:35] bolt to catch
[2:06:37] me I'll be fleeing but this prophet he
[2:06:42] stood there with
[2:06:43] love five fees right
[2:06:47] there the bull press breaks
[2:06:51] Screech right
[2:06:53] there turn around
[2:06:59] and you know what that
[2:07:01] was that's a
[2:07:04] demonstration of what Adam
[2:07:07] had before the
[2:07:10] fall Hallelujah am make
[2:07:14] man and let him have
[2:07:16] dominion over everything on the
[2:07:19] earth nothing things have dominion over
[2:07:22] you you have dominion
[2:07:25] over oh praise the name of the Lord
[2:07:27] glory to God Amen so brother he
[2:07:31] prophesied he said the words of God
[2:07:33] being
[2:07:35] materialized brought To
[2:07:37] Us by the ministry of the
[2:07:40] spirit so he prophesied not only will we
[2:07:44] have the ministry of the
[2:07:46] word but we will have the
[2:07:49] ministry of the
[2:07:53] I don't know if you know this but he
[2:07:55] prophesy that the church will be
[2:07:58] rebuilt and he did that on the message
[2:08:00] of
[2:08:01] Grace he said in other words he said he
[2:08:04] shall bring forth the
[2:08:06] Cornerstone he said he say he shall
[2:08:08] bring forth The
[2:08:09] Headstone if he would think that the
[2:08:12] seventh
[2:08:14] messenger was to restore the faith of
[2:08:16] the
[2:08:18] children back to the fathers in other
[2:08:21] words words rebuild the church
[2:08:24] again under the power of the
[2:08:27] spirit now the
[2:08:29] Pentecostals when the spirit fell on
[2:08:32] them they speak in tones and only
[2:08:35] produce
[2:08:36] gifts men fell in
[2:08:39] adultery up to now their life not
[2:08:42] right after now they getting problems
[2:08:44] with their
[2:08:45] life they have 30,000 member
[2:08:49] Church 20,000 member Church church it's
[2:08:52] not the numbers it's not the
[2:08:56] money it's the life now the
[2:09:00] Pentecostal rejected this message
[2:09:03] because this message was to bring the
[2:09:06] life in the Pentecostal
[2:09:09] age God used
[2:09:12] men in this time God want to
[2:09:16] use the word in
[2:09:19] men so when the prophet
[2:09:22] brought the word which is the Bible
[2:09:25] which is the pyramid and that pyramid
[2:09:28] was to get to you and
[2:09:31] I so God is trusting
[2:09:34] himself in his sons in the last
[2:09:37] days because the secret is the
[2:09:41] word is in the bride so this word coming
[2:09:46] to you and I service after
[2:09:49] service message after message
[2:09:52] the word is coming to you what word by
[2:09:56] these
[2:09:57] promises by these promises we become
[2:10:03] partakers of his divine nature oh praise
[2:10:07] the name of the Lord so the prophecy is
[2:10:10] that God would rebuild the church and
[2:10:14] from Jehovah Gyra
[2:10:17] 1962 he said I will
[2:10:19] restore in the last days
[2:10:22] it shall be restored prophecy God shall
[2:10:25] send the Holy
[2:10:27] Ghost in such a
[2:10:29] way upon planted
[2:10:32] word that it will restore so in other
[2:10:36] words since the prophet left we have had
[2:10:40] the ministry of the
[2:10:42] word but we are promised the ministry of
[2:10:45] the
[2:10:46] spirit that's the promise of
[2:10:49] Dynamics power coming into the church
[2:10:53] now the purpose of the fivefold
[2:10:55] ministry in the Statue of perfect
[2:10:58] man he was said Build Me Lord into
[2:11:01] this let Christ be my
[2:11:03] head working on my
[2:11:06] Foundation let
[2:11:08] virtue knowledge Temperance patience
[2:11:15] godliness brotherly kindness work in me
[2:11:18] oh lord is my prayer
[2:11:21] live or
[2:11:23] die
[2:11:24] s sink or
[2:11:28] drown live or die sink or
[2:11:31] drown friend or no
[2:11:34] friend let Christ
[2:11:37] virtue his
[2:11:39] knowledge flow
[2:11:41] out that I'm able to teach those and
[2:11:44] this is the part I want again for God
[2:11:47] has set into the
[2:11:48] church apostles prophets
[2:11:52] teachers pastors evangelist for the
[2:11:57] perfecting and bringing all these
[2:11:59] virtues into
[2:12:01] it and we cannot give what we don't have
[2:12:06] so this is not virtue by
[2:12:08] Revelation this is virtue by
[2:12:12] experience so when Peter went to the
[2:12:14] house of
[2:12:16] cornelus and begin to speak the word the
[2:12:19] Holy Ghost the D
[2:12:22] the power the presence fell on Cornelius
[2:12:25] house because Peter had the germ inside
[2:12:29] of
[2:12:30] him Peter was speaking
[2:12:33] life Peter was speaking the word and the
[2:12:37] spirit was there to
[2:12:39] confirm and to vindicate the
[2:12:44] word
[2:12:45] oration he said these virtues has to be
[2:12:50] inar before the
[2:12:52] Capstone ever come into it until these
[2:12:56] things are scripturally
[2:12:59] proven and sealed into you the Holy
[2:13:03] Spirit sees you as an
[2:13:06] individual so first what do you have you
[2:13:10] have mental
[2:13:12] Faith right when you come and hear the
[2:13:14] word I believe and then he said the Holy
[2:13:17] Spirit comes down upon that mental fate
[2:13:21] and give you spiritual
[2:13:23] faith and that spiritual Faith only
[2:13:26] recognizes the
[2:13:27] word if God put a donkey to preach
[2:13:30] behind
[2:13:31] here you will not look at the
[2:13:34] donkey you will hear the word coming
[2:13:36] from that
[2:13:37] donkey that spiritual faith in
[2:13:40] you only recognize the
[2:13:42] word from your faith after the Holy
[2:13:46] Spirit seals you in
[2:13:49] Christ then you become one
[2:13:51] I'm almost done I'm going to finish then
[2:13:54] you become
[2:13:55] one and then you are sealed
[2:13:58] unit of the Lord God and then they are
[2:14:03] Vindicated and
[2:14:06] placed when that time
[2:14:09] comes they become Vindicated
[2:14:12] sons and Vindicated
[2:14:15] daughters do you believe that this
[2:14:16] morning do you see that this morning
[2:14:20] hallelujah amen

[2:14:27] purpose don't waste your

[2:14:44] Revelation our purpose on Earth is to
[2:14:47] come into the statue of a perfect
[2:14:49] man there be a perfect Pride on the
[2:14:52] earth there'll be a perfect man walking

[2:14:56] earth Hallelujah give your time to
[2:15:00] fulfill the
[2:15:01] purpose that God raised you up
[2:15:04] for you waste your hours you waste your
[2:15:08] days you waste your days waste your
[2:15:11] weeks you waste your weeks waste your
[2:15:14] months you waste your month you waste
[2:15:16] your years stop wasting time time was
[2:15:21] given to fulfill purpose oh give the
[2:15:24] Lord some Praises hallelujah
[2:15:28] hallelujah the scripture we

[2:15:37] hallelujah amen this scripture we read
[2:15:40] Paul made a
[2:15:42] contrast of this love of Charity I speak
[2:15:47] with the tongues of men and angels
[2:15:51] Paul was saying number one Tong of men
[2:15:56] two tongues of
[2:15:58] angels three gift of Prophecy four to
[2:16:03] understand all
[2:16:05] Mysteries five to understand all
[2:16:08] knowledge six to have all Faith seven to
[2:16:13] give to the
[2:16:14] poor eight to give my body to be
[2:16:18] burn all these things and nothing the
[2:16:22] prophet me nothing do I make the
[2:16:25] sacrifice burn
[2:16:26] me nothing waste of time do I preach
[2:16:31] vials seven
[2:16:33] T new name seven seal
[2:16:38] Mysteries six hour

[2:16:43] sermon Revelation sermon no all
[2:16:47] knowledge all Mysteries
[2:16:52] waste of time nothing nothing Hallelujah
[2:16:57] and all of a
[2:17:00] sudden he begin to speak about this
[2:17:02] thing called
[2:17:04] love the
[2:17:07] characteristics or the
[2:17:09] ingredients of this ter called
[2:17:12] love a
[2:17:14] spectrum a
[2:17:16] range that love
[2:17:19] covers now this charity we talking about
[2:17:22] is not charitable
[2:17:25] acts they have these people have pans
[2:17:27] and they looking get money inside that
[2:17:29] not that
[2:17:29] [Music]
[2:17:32] notth for people we not talking about
[2:17:35] that Paul said
[2:17:38] charity suffer it long and his kind and
[2:17:42] I want to pick up nine
[2:17:45] things nine
[2:17:47] ingredients of This Thing Called Love
[2:17:51] and this love is not for the other
[2:17:54] side it is to be not this love is not to
[2:17:58] be practiced in
[2:18:00] heaven this love is to be expressed
[2:18:04] here on Earth these virtues or
[2:18:09] qualities relates to man and relates to
[2:18:14] life there's a quote I
[2:18:17] found it is attributed to somebody
[2:18:20] called Ean theet or I don't know how to
[2:18:25] pronounce and the quote is this the
[2:18:27] quote is this I shall pass through this
[2:18:29] world but
[2:18:32] once any good therefore I can
[2:18:36] do or any kindness that I can
[2:18:41] show to any human
[2:18:43] being let me do it
[2:18:46] now let me not defer nor neglect it
[2:18:52] for I shall not pass this way
[2:18:54] again it's only once we are passing
[2:18:57] through this world it's only once if you
[2:19:01] have to do good do it now if you have to
[2:19:05] live right live right now if you have to

[2:19:16] this way again give the Lord some prais
[2:19:20] Give the Lord a
[2:19:22] Hallelujah glory to
[2:19:24] God so let's
[2:19:27] go the first ingredient of this
[2:19:31] love charity suffered
[2:19:36] long patience love is
[2:19:40] enduring and long
[2:19:43] suffering love waiting to begin Le
[2:19:47] waiting calmly
[2:19:49] Le not
[2:19:53] rushing it maintains a steady
[2:19:57] Spirit even in difficult
[2:20:00] situation suffering

[2:20:25] two love is
[2:20:28] active in doing
[2:20:30] good making others
[2:20:33] happy it reflects Christ
[2:20:36] example to bring joy to
[2:20:39] others never acting rashly or
[2:20:43] pridefully but being
[2:20:46] gentle and
[2:20:48] considerate in all things
[2:20:54] kindness love in
[2:20:56] action so we have love
[2:20:58] pastor we have Love In

[2:21:05] one
[2:21:08] generosity generosity
[2:21:11] charity EnV

[2:21:25] listening whenever you attempt a good
[2:21:30] work you will find other men doing the
[2:21:32] same kind of
[2:21:34] work and probably doing it
[2:21:38] better remember
[2:21:39] disciples they came to
[2:21:42] Jesus they see we see some people preach

[2:22:09] circle doing the same
[2:22:14] thing whenever you attempt a good
[2:22:18] work you find other men doing this
[2:22:22] and probably doing it
[2:22:23] better Envy them
[2:22:28] not is a feeling of ill
[2:22:32] will to those are in the same line as
[2:22:37] [Music]
[2:22:39] our love does not
[2:22:42] envy or resent other
[2:22:47] success it celebrates others achievement
[2:22:50] [Music]
[2:22:52] being
[2:22:56] magnanimous and free from
[2:22:59] jealousy this
[2:23:02] generosity is how love is how love
[2:23:05] behaves

[2:28:55] eager to believe the
[2:28:57] best always
[2:29:01] hopeful and
[2:29:03] enduring slow to expose or
