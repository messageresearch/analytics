jesus [Music] worship your lord right now hallelujah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah [Music] praise the lord so god bless you for your bible it's like to the daniel chapter 12. we want to read one to four we want to look at first corinthians chapter 10 want to read 1-11 ephesians chapter 1 when the word read from verse 3-10 thank you musicians greetings in jesus name to you all welcome written to all those connected to us on the internet welcome you to our sunday morning worship fellowship unto god daniel chapter 12 relevance one to four and at that time shall michael stand up the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people and that there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered everyone that shall be found written in the book many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt but they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the filament and leader turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever but thou o daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro knowledge shall be increased reading from first corinthians chapter 10 i want to read from verse 1. moreover brethren and i would not that he should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all pass through the sea we're all baptized unto moses in the cloud and in the sea they'd all eat the same spiritual meat they'd all drink the same spiritual drink for the drunk of that spiritual rock that followed them that rock was christ but with many of them god was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness now these things were our examples to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted neither be idolaters as was some of them as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three and twenty thousand neither let us tell christ some of them also tempted and were destroyed of the supers neither murmur ye some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer now all these things happen unto them four examples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come final scripture ephesians chapter 3 1 we want to read from verse 3. blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ what blesses with all spiritual blessings that heavenly places in christ according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he had made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption to his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he had a boundary towards us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him may god bless his word you may be seated you love him this morning it's always good to come into the house of god it's always good to come and hear the word of god amen blessed be the name of the lord so this is our convention week there'll be no service on thursday we're looking forward for a great time beginning friday 10 o'clock and it's a friday evening and for the three days 10 and four looking for a great time in the lord a great transformation time we are promised great things and we ought to be under great expectation must be under great expectation our title this morning the title is the fullness of times as it had the fullness of times i have an inspiration waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god amen that's the inspiration waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god and this scripture this inspiration is from romans 8 19 it says for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the money of the sons of god amen and in the amplified it says for the even the whole creation all nature waits expectantly and longs earnestly for god's sons to be made known it's waiting for the revealing or the disclosing of their sonship that's not toxic that is sonship so the creation itself is waiting for the revealing or the unfolding of their sanchi oh this is tremendous just imagine the whole creation is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of god when god will pull the veil off of his sons now these are sons of god not humans not that's natural people sons of god and sons of god express god bible said he came unto his own his own receive him not but as many as receive him to them he gave power to become the sons of god not baptist not methodist not pentecostal not jehovah witness not catholic power to become not a church member power to become the sons of god sons of god talk a certain way they act a certain way they dress a certain way they live a certain way sons of god they are different they are sons of god they are not sons of men natural they are sons of god they have god's gene inside of them they have god's german side of them hallelujah they are the sons of god that god picked out from the earth hallelujah right in the face of the devil god chose you right in satan's face he pick you up right in your condition he chose you because who he found he called who he called sons of god he called them for a purpose he called you onto something he just doesn't call you call you onto a purpose don't ever let the devil take that out of your mind you're not called to exist you're going to cause your behavior and you're behind and you're going through that's not what you're called for you call for a purpose that purpose must be accomplished hallelujah hallelujah your life is no mishap your life is no mistake what you've been to is not by chance because we know if the devil don't know we know something that the devil don't know if the people don't know we know something if your family know we know something penal romans 8 28 that all things work take care of the good that then we know that if nobody else knows that we know that this happened that happened so what where's the big deal where's the big thing god is in charge he brought you under my reclaim he set your feet in a rocket state he kept you all these years you could have been dead a long time ago you could be a up you could be practicing you could be in hell a long time ago but the blood of jesus put the blood of jesus this morning [Applause] your love for god will take you higher on the bar hard on his cigarette higher than parties and dance i am fat iron and fool along with women i am inflating the love of god will take you above all like that is the love of god you're talking about you you you can't pay for that [Applause] what they're gonna pay for the love of god what you're gonna pay for the blood of jesus god by his grace release his son he came in the fullness of time born of or not woman born under the law to redeem them who were under the law he came just like you to feel for you to understand what you're going through to put on your shoes and wear your clothes to reach down to pick you up and you can serve them with all your heart mind life and soul yeah israel the lord thy god is one god you love him with all your heart mind and soul and you can walk away from the things of the world [Applause] this person giving you a fight and this family gave you a fight enough i'll give you a fight what kind of nonsense is that what fight is that talk about the fight is all inside of you all inside your mind foolish inside your mind what you get in a fight god again i'll fight god loosen listen listen we bypass our teagal family are we going to prove to the devil that we come from thought bypass the word put on the earth to be tempted and tested in case it didn't know now you know okay the lord some praises people we have been put on this earth to prove we come from god we're going back to god we come from the eighth day we come from eternity we come from original gene thought that was in the back part of god's mind which devil could take that out whichever could you raise that out with job which losing job losing your roof losing your car whatever it doesn't matter what can separate me from the love of god that's in christ jesus [Applause] i wanted a songwriter i have a song it wasn't easy but it was worth it and you wanted it easy it wasn't easy for christ but it was really worth it oh hallelujah for even who creation waits expectantly and longs earnestly for god's sons to be made known amen god's sons to be made known the creation has grown groaning for that and god's sons couldn't be made known until we come down to the fullness of time that's when the time promised for god's sons to be manifested so you have seven two changes but coming now long to the fullness of time god promised to release a message that would bring the sons of god into position that he could adopt them and place them on the earth to give the whole devil one last death blow smoking the devil face before we leave here going and losing this battle this battle already won you know we're going through the motion god is not going to lose this battle you know it's almost six thousand years he's waiting for this showdown it's going to be a showdown a back to eden showdown we had one in eden and this is satan eden that was god's easing and man fell in god's ethos and god bringing back a bride in satan's either this is the big showdown big time this is a heavyweight championship this is good versus evil light versus darkness sons of god hallelujah the pride of christ versus praise god whatever the devil have to offer oh hallelujah and daniel said the people that know their god shall be strong and do great exploits we couldn't know god in all the ages in that kind of a way because his mystery wasn't fully revealed he was only unfolding part of himself but in this last day the full thing has come into view the full thing is unfolded now we know who he is that we know his nature that we know is being what he wants accomplished oh give the lord praise his people you don't need somebody's spoon feeding you all along you don't need that praise god you're gonna be strong this is harvester praise god feast of tabernacles feast of ingathering this is a harvest of what we labored for what you pressed for since all these years 74 75 and you're looking towards god for the harvest of the seeds that your soul that your family will be delivered that your loved one's going to come free where this is the time this is the over not to back down this is over to be strong this is the overton give god your highest praise [Applause] this is that hour this is at all give god your highest praise especially amidst your trying circumstance you gotta demonstrate your faith is in him my god you're rexy in front of you but your fate is in him because he's able to open up the red sea mountains on both sides but your faith is in him fear don't want to budge and move and release the people but your faith is in him so you're going to stay there till something happen you will stay there on these cells he said call for flies they're going to stay until they say call for frogs they're going to stay there until he calls for everything you had to call for until you break the grips of fear pharaoh hands off god's people and i'm telling you to break the break the binding of satan's hand upon your children upon your loved ones upon your family that devil had to let them go i don't care how bond they are this morning praise god they have to be loosed do you believe that praise god over there about tears and crimes forget your kittens forget crying about it we're going to speak and they're going to happen just as god spoken because god would can't return void whatever god said it must come to pass what are you waiting for don't be caught like those pharisees and scribes reading scripture and when jesus come they couldn't handle it amen amen yes in the bible years in the message of when the season changed when the season turned and it was manifestation time they couldn't deal with it they wanted to stick down their coat and coats because they all knew messiah's promise they all knew seventh on the revival has promised they all know about pride revival they all know what the prophet said that there were a manifestation of the seven thunders that people will fly from everywhere saying the seven thunders are being manifested not talked not taught but manifested [Applause] oh glory to god it got because hey listen he clears his streets and there's a time and season for everything under heaven you could cry you got bald but when you all come you know i come no devil could stop you from going free when your hour come no binding spirit no demon power no sin no sin could stop you from going free from when you are come [Applause] the devil buying you is one thing but don't bang yourself don't bang yourself who the son of man set free is free indeed don't bang yourself rory [Applause] glory my god is some of you free you could be free but you're still born like lazarus he was free he was raised from the dead but he said lose him and let him go all them grave caught all around him all them dead things all around him as i said preach already he come and jump in so he couldn't walk they didn't wrap him up already so he had to come up jumping so you're lying hallelujah but he tied up he alive but he wrapped up some of you you you him i'm preaching to you this morning praise god i'm come to lose them dead quarter for you all them but you're boyfriend chicken girlfriend you're not a chicken brother you are eager eagle was made to soar eagle was meant to fly [Applause] [Music] america is struggling with with a man in power in a position where the question is correct at the whole office how did he get there god will not have that goal not have a bunch of jokers that's why the troll have guards fire all around the throne serve us around the throne that's why he said no scary one could just go and sit on that troll or take from that troll you have to be presented fire have to come offering by fire fire to take a man inside the deal fire to take a woman inside a deal [Applause] talk is talk but approaching that throne that's different the cleansers the burners the seraph's idea to cleanse the worshiper hallelujah coming to being offering to god you want to offer something to god he said before you could even offer it go to a brother and make it right don't come and play a bigger offering offering and doing what i never ought against your brother we're doing that ought it's faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness on the top broadly kindness that's the spirit of forgiveness that's the fullness the seven steps that's as far as you can go because the spirit has got himself to come down upon you hallelujah and the spirit of god descending like a dove you can't operate that god does but you could get up on the seventh step and that's seven step is forgiveness that seven stuff is when you could drop your odds and the whole look grudging excuses and blame somebody and somebody and somebody you're still aiming down somewhere inside the deal you have to get out of that get in the real spirit of forgiveness look at jesus he said father forgive them they know not what they do and they will crucify him christian for him but he was higher than that he encouraged them he had swear against them he stood there and said i forgive them they don't even know what they're doing they don't know what they're killing they don't know what they're unfolding inside of there satan don't even know if satan only understood he was going to leave jesus alone but when he died he shed his blood he released a spirit now we are here and satan can hold us back nothing nothing nothing but to stop the sons of god from coming forth in this hour this is what the whole creation is groaning for not have a nice church and nice church members and so on and suit and tie that's not what the creation grown in four oh hallelujah we're going to rip the veil off for who he is you're going to see who he is and as you behold him you will become like him may be seated on the second hand the robe with branham god seeing for seeing elijah's day were numbered he had so long he could stay here on it so long as everybody has got to put boundaries you can't pass so don't worry god know where to find everybody there's a good one go ahead and knock on door you know where she wants to live no when a man overcomers are welcome so he's going to have a success of elijah when he did god called this man listen he wasn't in no seminary when he called him amen he was plowing a field with the yoke of ox doing the service taking care of his mother and father god called him to be the successor of elisha or elijah perhaps many up at the school thought they were sure to do going to be his successor they were going to wear his robe as soon as he was finished but god does the calling amen god does the choosing god does the electing and god does the setting in order [Music] do you love him god has set in the church some apostles some prophets some teachers some evangelists and pastors god does that himself we cannot make one here black or white neither can we add one thing to our stature by taking thought god in his infinite grace and by his election and for knowledge sets these things in order and every wheel works just right i like that i would be a discouraged man this morning if i didn't believe in the election and calling of god if i thought that this world was left to the outcome of it by the power of man and by the wisdom of man and by the united nations who never mentioned god's name i'd be a discouraged person but i'm not looking to that for the outcome i looked to the pages of this old book here where god wrote it out and everything will come just exactly the way he said it so you're not looking for man for your outcome you're not looking for uncle and auntie and tanty and this bishop and this minister's association you're not looking for that for your outcome you're looking to the word for your outcome because once that word is spoken over you nothing will not stop it oh jesus had to find that woman of the world you have to find bartimaeus you have to find peter and john and james and all of them you have to find them because the names was in that book and every name on the book shall be must be have to be delivered oh give the lord a shout praise god god not asking him what you hear your complexion your height your color your race where your country come from or the language you speak all you're looking for is the names on the book that time michael shall stand up and every name song written in that book [Applause] that's why the mighty angel came with the book open in revelation 10 to call your name the seven thunders is what called your name that was christ your husband that was christ your husband that's your husband revelation 10 1 is your husband revelation 10 7 is your messenger oh give the lord a shout in the house your husband dropped in revelation 10 to call you with a shout it was the covenant angel because he swore by himself what did he swear that time shall be no longer even time itself runs out shall we come into the fullness of time when time itself runs out that may be breaking into eternity breaking into the eighth day breaking into a holy convocation or give the lord some precious people time itself is about to run out so what are you doing with your life time is about to run out remember it's only what you do for the kingdom is what counts not your selfish living living for your own self your own pleasure that ain't coming for nothing that's your stinking rotten selfish being we're not talking about that perfect eternal life is living for others not you sitting on your rotten flesh living for you and your family and that's all no you've got to go hard on that oh glory to god jesus died for the entire world knowing that son wasn't gonna get it that you're going to work it out that you're going to understand what his calling is [Applause] i feel excited this morning don't wonder why peter said make a call in an election show make a call and lecture show make it sure god call me god elected me what the devil wants to land on me what the devil doing resting on me what the devil do inviting me i have a calling of god this is what samson understood that's why you can pray once more lord this is what daniel understood that's why you could go in the lion's den before the hebrew boys understood that the calling of god and if the and thy seed shall possess the case of the enemy they understood that so they face the land and lying there they face the fiery furnace come on now what are you facing come on man up this morning hang on up this morning what are you confronting this morning what is that goliath in your life this morning confronted [Applause] church you say prayers but here you pray they're different some men write their prayers and repeat that they choose the words to say are people saying that every morning there's a pill what do i want to hear is from your soul from your heart from your spirit have mercy upon you're not even worthy to be in that place oh god deliver me oh god secretary oh god do something i don't want to leave you the same way i live with me long enough i know me lord i know me i know me i know me you don't want to tell me more with me i know me i'm troubled by myself i want a new walker wanting to talk this but jacob come to that spot praise god hallelujah you have to talk you have people's back him up have you ever seen you're looking nice and looking good but your soul not nice your spirit not nice your behavior not nice your front might be nice your face might be looking nice your dress might be nice your time must be nice but you're not nice [Music] you may be in church and you're rotten and you're dying and all the things that happen to the past fathers happen for our examples upon whom the ends of the world have come and the ends of the world have come it is now upon us oh give the lord and praise his people [Applause] the fullness of time for noah's day was 120 years but the time came 120 years was up after preaching to them bunch of people for years and they wasn't listening they're doing their own thing they thought they were wasting time a hundred years they said no matter the same sermon was that 20 more years ago but when that fullness of time

judgment was coming [Applause] god gets obvious with man which is evil sodomite a filthy ways god regretty made man and everything else with the filthy living and everything else but the bible said noah found grace in the eyes of the lord not because he was taller not because he was handsome not because he was special not because he had a degree but he was elected he was chosen of god and if you understand that you'll rejoice tonight just to know no man could come except the father draw him praise god you lost this you lost that but you must lose your god come on now don't lose your faith

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] i don't know how i'm preaching this tonight [Music] so you're not looking for a man for the outcome i'm looking on the page of this old book where god wrote it out everything will come exactly the way he said it that's all so the only thing for me to do is to line up with them but not line up with them but line up with calvary line up with god line up with his word stay with this word no matter how much it looks like it's going to be that way it's going to be the way god intends it to be it can't be nothing else for him being infinite know the end from the beginning and he makes everything come to his praises everything come to give god praise and honor my if that wouldn't take make the courage in a christian nothing can go wrong amen that's ten percent saying amen i heard you i heard your silence on that one day you heard it [Applause] nothing can go wrong after all it's not our bible it's his it's not our wisdom it is his and the only one thing we have to do is to put our faith and trust there and set still and see the glory of god and see how it moves around to its place and every wheel move in it it may be scattered from side to side it will move right into its place when god speaks the word he knew the end from the beginning he knew who he who he was going to choose he knew elisha would take a larger place before the world was ever formed everything had to work exactly right and we are worried about our loved ones and so forth will they ever come in their names if they were written in the lamb's book of life before the whole day of the world they will walk right in there that's the only thing he could do [Applause] so that should free you from worrying about your loved ones and understand if the name is there michael coming to deliver them oh give the lord some praise people [Applause] [Music] i thought snake's not supposed to buy preachers super grab paul now watch paul didn't fear because jesus said they take up serpents it shall not harm them so he walked over here and shake him off in the fire turns out walk get some sticks and put back in the fire he turn around warm his back turn around warm his hands the said why don't he die why don't that man die because that particular snake when he bit you is some seconds and you're gone so they're watching them on the scene man you get dead proof [Music] but paul here we go was so full of the holy ghost he was full of it full of it that's what i want to be full of it it's so full that sickness [Applause] you walk into the hospital personal cancer and when you started walking there the cancers have to tremble because holy ghost full of the whole eagles the is crippled but when the see you're walking towards them that demons at the timber that means that crippled spirit have to go that blindness have to go that leukemia have to go that cancer have to go that female condition have to go because a man is full of the holy ghost what is it manifestation of the son of god are you looking for it are you expecting it are you waiting for it it will come [Applause] remember but abraham said he was so full of the holy ghost that the poison couldn't poison him they put john on the aleppo atmos in a pot of oil and hot it and he just had to boil it out to him and they still couldn't boil it when the fire went out and they had no more wood to put john step all the oil you can't boil down the hole he goes look how roast the holy ghost you can't toss the holy ghost you can't burn the holy ghost you can't kill the holy ghost the guy out the holy ghost they got poisoned the holy ghost oh get the lord if this is your promise you shall receive power after the holy ghost come upon you let's press for it let's pray for it let's ask for it let's believe for it [Applause] are you ready for our promise are you ready for a prophecy oh brother give me a church full of the holy ghost god will do in one year what all theology has failed to do in two thousand years you wait till the anointing of the church strike home to that fearful little remnant after the dawn of the gentiles is closed god will anoint the church then a church full of the holy ghost peter full of the holy ghost and you full of the holy ghost stephen full of the holy ghost [Applause] [Music] no motorbike hold him in cold water or her no pepsi or coke sprite he had no fast food no kentucky but he was fuller jesus full of the holy ghost take take five blows two fishes full of the holy ghost bless it tell the disciples share it and something happened that was miraculous you can't explain that that's a paradox incredible but true it feeds 5 000 people and had bread remaining you you didn't hear what i'm saying jesus full of the holy ghost wine runs in the wedding they come and ask him and tell him why he run out as if he's either wine and jesus tell them go and draw water draw water not not go and get grapes no water you don't need the grapes he bypass the process and turn the water into wine that's what we're talking about my god my god if this don't lift your faith i don't know what it if this don't raise up your faith i don't know what it is oh glory to god full of the holy ghost full of the holy ghost full of the holy ghost like a stuck inside idea you're going to be full of the holy ghost you can't overcome this you'll be full of the holy ghost my god you're going to beat that devil around and full of the holy ghost paul i know peter i know you i know the pride i know because they're going to be full of the holy ghost [Applause] glory let me be seated now this world was scattered through seven ages and god had to send our message seven angels to gather the scattered word to tie it back into the word to bring the entire holy ghost and the prophet said the entire holy ghost has visited the church that is what makes luke 17 30 the son of man in a son of man so jesus christ was veiling a prophet which is the holy ghost itself and he spoke of prophetic words spirit spoken words to go and anoint a bride so when you intruded that you could be wherever the weather define you that's why you're in church today something inside of you is what the word connect with oh give the lord a shout in the house because it's spirit given words hallelujah that means is that word going out it means it going to catch you to pull you in to wheel you in because the world has you have to become the sons of god that's what power was given for that was the word was given for not to become a church member but for you to be a reproduction of god so church supposed to be an avenue in which you get connect back to your god they come like a cell phone activated share supposedly place where you get the activation then well you could call him for yourself not through some priests not to some bishop but you have your own line back to your father come on say amen somebody [Applause] but this part is incredible after the doors [Music] of the gentiles is closed god will anoint a church then what does that mean the doors of the gentiles is closed the bible called the jews the olive tree olive branch and god cut them off to put this wild olive branch in called the gentiles and the bibles talk about the times of the gentiles until the fullness of the gentiles come in so therefore the gentiles have a specific time not a specific time but call it the fullness of the gentiles until the time was gentile coming in so it means that when that time come in not one more name person going to be saved so don't wait for the door to shut because nowhere 120 years where people had the opportunity to receive it to receive the message and then when god said they tell noah listen time up your fullness of time has come so you started getting animals in two by two people see that and thought like having a farm inside of there with that making fun of noah but afterwards god shut the door seven days into account preaching to doomed people the act sat preaching to people who could not be saved oh yeah would that repeat again yes in church yes people have the conversation here and can't be saved because they were already rejected you mean those people that act was preaching to no one foreign yes for seven days until the rain started fall then people say noah no i i see it now but the only problem is no i didn't shut the door amen god did and what gorge dog got shot no man cut open amen and what god thought man oh god open no man could shut so when god shut the door the door shut oh hallelujah so while you have a chance to make things right why you have a chance to be reconciled to god please do i couldn't wait for my family to save the lord you know that was a personal choice that's i choose that i choose this is the harder way this isn't our way either smoke and drink and run around but this is the harder way this is christian soldier there's no natural soldier this is christian soldiers where your life is there before a christian life is a public life you know oh it was a private life no it's a public life it's a public life it's a public testimony you know you live in a private you're a christian i want you to know him you're not a christian you might be imprisoned a christian is a public servant that's why god said take the blood and put it in your doorpost don't put it behind the door well i don't like how they're looking they call it not blending no you don't have that you know the teacher will take you out put it on your doorpost because you want to see it your neighbors could see it anybody walk and see blood blood no blood no blood no blood blood blood blood everybody could see it that's how god wants your testimony on your job your book as i see it [Applause] after the doors of the gentiles closed glory another church then he was filthy filthy still he is righteous righteous still he is holy let him be holy still god will anoint the church with the power of god and things will be taken place not only then that's prophecy you do not know there's a brother um recognizing his message but iran says now the church has not recognized a day like israel back in the whole palestine she's going to be forced to work on the churches why she didn't recognize the hour he said let him that fail to be very still let him not holy be holy still now a bobby a woman she can't be because god said woman look at you here he said bobby a woman she can't be no that sounds very flat that's the scripture the bible says she is under her head her head is a husband his head is christ so she dishonest christ how can she be this honorable and not be filthy let's see that got bob here let her keep it so in other words when that time come it sets your condition it's like a snapshot that snaps you and that's your picture you can't change it that's what that means so the time the changes now you must want change you must desire transformation you must hate yourself you must want god's will you have to ask god you want a revelation of his will for your life you can't just go no you have to drift you know like a driftwood let the stream of life just take you the current carrier wherever it hit whatever it bumps that's the stream of life and you go in with life everybody's doing that but that same driftwood could be carved out into a boat and put the power of an engine to power it to guide it to direct it this is what you want you don't want to be drifting because if you drift your head that was the falls i want to say if you drift you will head towards the falls don't drift let your wife be guided let your life be directed by the spirit of god oh hallelujah she that wears shorts keep on wearing them let he deny the word keep on denying it you cannot change fixed condition you will not be able to change oh hallelujah but let him not holy be holy still let him that righteous be righteous still isn't that right like israel back in the homeland national force but israel in the home must not force put israel in a homeland national force will put the work on the churches but the power of god will put the people in the bride and that's why i love that song oh lord send the power just now baptize everyone many people ask will the bride will this will this what the bride is the elected of god period so nobody could own the bible and said our church have the bride that's not the word the bride is the elected of god the church goes through that's the one who says whosoever will let him come but the bride is elected of god so you don't want to be part of whoever will like comment you know because whosoever will come i hear that no be elected be the bride that's what you must desire to be isn't that right watch there are five oh god let's keep that praise god but abraham each night we want every person that's not a christian hope something will be said or done that you'll become a christian and if you're not and if you have already believed in the lord jesus and accept him and be baptized and you haven't received the holy ghost as yet don't let this get by let this be your night remember here we go remember there will be just so many names on that book and when the last name is added that's all of it yours might complete it let's go a little further are you with me when the lamb come and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne that was the book of redemption those names was put in there before the foundation of the world and when that last name was called the book the plan everything else was revealed then the seventh seed was opened by the lamb the mystery of the whole bible was hidden there and the last name that goes on the book then he changes a little bit or the last name that's redeemed that was put on that book that settles it he comes to claim what he has redeemed so before the rapture comes you have to be redeemed because he's coming for what he has redeemed redeemed by the blood and redeemed by power oh hallelujah but you are going to be redeemed and redeemed means to go back to where i was before we're not talking about save now i am saving jesus and we're not talking about that we're talking about redeemed which is to bring you back into the adamic state to be restored back into your sonship to your godship to your inheritance back to the manifestation of the sons of god so god is not satisfied for you to be a nice church member saying amen hallelujah glory to god god is not going to rest until you come forth back to eden until you come into a manifestation of sons and daughters of the living god walking like god talking like god god on the earth when the lamb took the book john said we shall reign on the earth the reign is the rule the rule is to conquer to overcome the step on the head of devils to step on the head of the serpent oh glory to god to possess the case of the enemy that is what it is to reign to rule to conquer oh praise god praise god that sickness wouldn't back you up but you will back up sickness my god talk about sons of god coming forward he said they will stop cancer they're going to stop diseases they're going to stop this and stop that they're going to actually stop it [Applause] without the doctorate without a medical degree cancer stop right there stage four go to stairs street the stage one stays none ghetto that's what we're talking about that's what we're talking about hallelujah hallelujah glory to god i cursed that humor in the name of jesus christ i got you with that shrink that fry broiled disappear right inside your system give the lord a shout in the house no operation [Applause] glory glory to god oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah or jesus do you feel the anointed in the building do you feel the anointing in the building that's what we're talking about this anointing is a coming to you this is power they were in the upper room and all of a sudden there came us some from heaven and the holy ghost filled the whole house find the building [Applause] oh jesus hallelujah glory to god gloria glory to god praise god you are being delivered because your name is on the book jesus told disciples don't rejoice because devils are subject unto you but rejoice because your name is in heaven shout because your name is up there praise god because your name is up there [Applause] my god [Applause] every season [Applause] jesus he was the mystery of god god was so mysterious you want to reveal himself and christ is the mystery of god on the earth word made flesh walking among us nobody knew he came with names had he called peter come andrew come philip come he just called them and they were called to be manifested sons they don't know that yet they just following this man like messiah they're just following this man with his long gun and this beard he cast him devil and healing the sick and he began to throw promises over them the same works i do shall you do also i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you little while the world sees me no more but you shall see me oh hallelujah if you shall see it this mountain be moved and don't talk in your heart you can have what you say because you come from the same source i come from you come from the same gene you come with the same birth word [Applause] then to cap it off in his resurrection ministry he tell him as my father sent me so send that you and the father that sent him was in him so he said i'm going to be in you at that day you're going to know i'm in the father you and me and i and you saint john 14 20 he prophesy upon them that the day is coming they'll move on partial realization and the perfect realization that they will come in that they will know where they come from where they're going perfect realization come from god going back to god oh hallelujah praise god my god these brothers had no degree these brothers didn't have education but they had revelation they go in the spirit reveal it to you brother as good as getting whatever praise god it's the greatest thing to strike your soul when the spirit break upon you by revelation [Applause] it change the way you dress it change the way you look you stop following people and you receive people start to follow you because you become part of the book you become part of the call of god god used you need to call others let the devil pull you out but you praise god pulling others in because the object of calling these men what i will make you fishers of men [Applause] in our words in other words hear what it is i call you because your name is on the book i call you to become a fisherman to call other names in the book [Applause] so that is where you'll get all the suns together because the world has to come from the moat because god would come from his mouth let there be let there be so it had to come from the mouth of a sun to the son of god come and spoke you must be born again of the world and the spirit because adam wasn't supposed to speak to his wife and she wasn't supposed to bring forth a spoken word son but they fell in the flesh and went on to sex but adam was to speak and eve conceive and break for the next adam just like the father sons of god [Applause] but we fell from that but we are going back to that oh give the lord a shout in the house we are going back where we fell from go stay fallen toasted fallen do sit in your sin repent this morning [Applause] we're going back going back be a nice church member and you will make it that's a lie from a better hell bible says the kingdom of god is preached an heavy man you have to push your way into it get a pressure way for righteousness oh hallelujah resurrection about to take place so i'm going to resurrect your glory and resurrect shame and contempt and many who turn people to righteousness shall shine the stars hallelujah who have you turned to righteousness who you have encouraged into righteousness do encourage people to slackness don't cause people to sin shame on you if you encourage people to slackness and sin don't do that encourage others to righteousness we leave the world to encounter righteousness we go into a righteous place we see when a righteous god i got to keep his word oh hallelujah praise god thank you lord jesus oh hallelujah hallelujah praise god so let me read this again the last name goes on that book or the last thing that's redeemed that was put on that book that settles it he comes to claim what is redeemed it might be a strange time but around did you ever think people will go right on preaching the church will go right on even thinking they're getting people saved it is too late then it's over and the message will go to the totally lost what wait a minute you mean we have to preach to people who are totally lost oh yes once had the opportunity to repent once happened to get it straight and rejected it it was done in these anoa seven days in the ark it was done it is a sodom preaching to the eternal loss that we're in prison that repented not long staffing is unknown our souls in prison i hope you're not one of them tonight a soul in prison oh hallelujah the gospel stop having effect upon your life and you figure you're running your own show and you forget god called you out god bless your life god forgive you god splash blood upon you when you look back you're this invisible god working around you all the time but you're blinded to see the effect and the power of god's preserving and god's protection [Music] [Applause] i'll begin to see in my own life i didn't give myself a vision god did i don't give myself inspiration god does all that is good praise god what to preach this morning he give me to share this with you now where we are we coming into the fullness of time how we can look forward to see sons of god coming forth to be manifested not more talk less talk more action satan time for satan to see some drama see all the time brothers in the upper room satan didn't didn't believe they're coming for channel they were only staggering and speaking in tongues in the upper room you said that didn't simply deviate oh they're getting excited glamorous but when peter came to the gate called beautiful and the crippled man was laying there and peter said silvan gold have i none such as baron said the devil's teammate said no we have to stop that that's a manifested son now that is jesus reproducing himself you thought jesus was troubled now had more trouble with the only one jesus don't have a whole bunch of them acting like jesus talking like jesus a bunch of jesus satan recognized his kingdom in trouble because jesus was one man but has seen he has reproduce himself it seems like the pillar fight has divided it seemed like everybody get their portion it seemed like they got the inheritance and they're moving out with it they're moving out with it the talking is part of them they shall lay hands on the sick they don't even have to pray just to lay hands on the sick you're not hearing what i'm saying because the quickening power was all over them the quitting and power gonna be all over you oh give the lord a shout in the house [Applause] you heard that testimony you may be seasoned by the brown wife have this big tumor big like a grapefruit showing through her stomach or whatever things like that here on the fields preaching god tell him speak for his wife here next country and he's saying before the doctor's hand touches my wife she's supposed to want the operation operation before the doctor's hand touches my wife the tumor will go down please speak into the tumor watch this time space distance can't stop it you know because that tumor is right the next dimension there that demon that tumor that spirit is the next dimension so he's talking it right there when he's speaking that demon have to respond you know [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] humor gone because my son said gone could you imagine coming back to the spot where god start to honor his son's word when elijah believe it to curse the children the ass come and eat them he said god is on his way you know with the sun talking there it's scary that's why you say be careful what you see power is in your tongue power of deliverance power of restoration is in your tongue in your mouth be careful what you see hallelujah as a man thinking his heart so is he glory to god you think you're done you're done you think you can't make it you can't make it you think you can't get a victory you can't get rich because you that's you them to you those those 12 spies come and say we land is a good land but we can't take it could have giants in the land they couldn't take it caleb said we are more than able to take it let's go up at once god honored caleb 40 years seeing all this virgin fall along one by one and dying endless funeral services how to endure all of that and caleb and joshua that bunch of young people cross over to possess that land and give up still have to say give me my mountain it's still not easy mountain not valley mountain not flat mountain not plain you have to climb to get where you're going brother you need strength to climb you need grace to climb some of you looking tired hope you're not tired i don't want physical either you know spiritually tired you can't be tired now you know i can't afford to be say if you lose your teeth use a gum but you have to climb hold yourself up pull yourself up by your socks but you've got to climb climb a little higher because jesus is higher you've got to climb a little higher climb up with fate and virtue and knowledge you need that temperance that patience that godliness you have to have all seven virtues oh glory to god my be warned just don't stand the wrong let's do something about it if we are not right with god let get right with god my and this south side church needs today is a humble itself back again it got to a place there's no confession there's no love among the people it seems like dying daily churches cooling off everywhere your final revival is over you find it cool enough we need a humiliating they asked for a general and got a lamb god knew what they needed that's what the world needs today is a savior a savior to this condition something i could hold it together not an educated regime not some mechanical system not some educational system what we need is the power of the lord jesus christ and saving grace back in the church where men and women and girls can be saved not not you go to church you are saved so you can tell somebody no i'm not going there i am saved i'm not going with you to smoke to drink the party i am a safe person jesus saved me and i'm grateful to god and the life that i live are not living that life anymore if anyone in christ is a new creature it's a new creation i am change i am changing i want something better for my life [Applause] oh glory hallelujah could we take some more get this one it may be almost past feeling time almost past feeling time because there will come a time like that when the spirit of god will be taken from the earth so people can feel like how they want to feel past feeling time there will be no more the church will remain a while preaching because it has to preach to the eternal lost that is just part of the church ministry oh hallelujah has to preach to the eternal loss are you with me this morning and if he doesn't cut the work short for elected sake there is some that's elected to eat in life we all know that they got eternal life and if we don't cut it short for their sake no flesh shall be saved the world met a doom every two thousand years we know systems that fall apart in the days of noah and these are christ and so on now the spirit the dynamics of the promised word to drive to get into the church and drive them to calvary under and then to the rapture so he prophesied that the spirit will come to drive us to calvary where we have a crucifixion with christ isn't that right praise god now you say wait a minute know what the prophets rebuke those women in them days they call them woman haters now wait a minute you're writing the scriptures down a woman that lives in worldly pleasure can't be the pleasures of god so the woman that lives in worldly pleasure is dead while she's living and that's what the prophet said said paul the woman that lives in this worldly condition is dead while she's living and if she rejects mercy she can cross the separating line where there is no place for no more and then where is she at with her painted eyes her cut here she crossed the line with no way to come back there's got to be listen listen there's got to be a ministry preached to her but remember it's all over it is done it's just a haunting there will be a ministry that will show great signs and wonders joe has said so there will be no time for redemption it's all over the lambda took his book his redeemed is over as jesus first preached and was rejected and then went and haunted those that were there preached to them that were in prison could not repent no time for salvation that same ministry will have to repeat again what if that could be the third pole to return or lost what if it is there i hope it's not what if it is think of it in a minute now what if it is god forbid i got children but it looks pretty close oh hallelujah noah's ministry all ministry done the same noah preached exactly went into the ark and when he went into the ark there were seven days nothing happened and the testimony preached to the doom not by speaking in tongues not by dancing in the spirit not by joining church not at the fruit of the spirit watch but it's the word living there it is if they only have looked he was messiah he was the living word made manifest you say the church they'll go right on just the same but remember all this time noah's and the ark the bride is comparing it now the brightest ceiling with christ the last member has been redeemed the sixth seal produced itself and we know that the earthquake we lose like judgment isn't that right the seventh seal brings him to the earth tree is perfection the ministry comes to perfection when it's reproduced christ again in natural among human beings he did not say the ministry of the perfection when the ministry could preach mysteries he said when christ is reproduced so somewhere along that line we've got to see christ oozing on all flesh we got to see this word become flesh not talk not doctrine we had that for 50 years it has to be something more than that it has to be alive because that's the thunder that shakes the devil oh glory to god could you imagine you on your job testifying about the love of god [Music] what female could come around that [Music] you're not compromising you're on the world your testimony is true you're saying your testimonial i'm a christian so don't even say you want to get a drink with us i said i'm a christian you didn't say a drinking christian they don't have that you have church remember there's a drink i'm a christian i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god you're living for christ is this treating the knockout men you know woman money and popularity just three that not a hundred of them amen and all of them compared to the lust of the eyes that's the definition of the pride of life it's just three things all men are going through the bible three things woman money and popularity they're gonna catch a money kitchen woman catching fame only popular you want to be looking everywhere you're looking for selfies or you come somebody take your picture they're looking out for you as long as you see that desire cut inside of there devil have no room inside of you for your purpose in your god you're not going to fall by no woman you're going to stay with the world you're going to say with a word you're not be popular because to be popular you have to compromise you got to please everybody and then you become a dishrag everybody can wipe the floor with you because you're not making no stand but when you make a stand people respect you not what you're giving to people respect you for what you stand for i want to say it again people don't respect you for what you're given to people respect you for what you stand for what are you standing for what are your principles hallelujah and when you start to stand like that forget it you're going strong every day because the devil can't get stronger don't tell me that you could get stronger the devil is still the devil keep permanently the devil he can't change but you are not permanent sinner permanent just remember no you're growing in grace and the knowledge every day you're coming closer to your fullness of time when you're gonna be manifested when your life will be confirmed every day getting stronger believe that believe that say every day i am getting stronger say it again every day i'm getting stronger one more time loud every day i'm getting stronger give the lord some praises glory glory hallelujah what branham said when the holy was coming to you it comes like a little light like a button and as you die out as you give up this and give it back that button light expands to fill your entire being so the more you give up this let go this that light begin to expand take over your mind take over

foundation of the world he said no we see god was self-existent and there was nothing there so his own self his own good counsel produced these things that he might chew this one man through christ jesus got it up again now if i have a right inheritance of something if god is knocking on my head and say william branham i call you a long time ago before the value of the world to preach the gospel i have an inheritance of eternal life god sent jesus to make that inheritance real to me [Applause] so the inheritance is fixed [Applause] you can't remember it so he sent jesus to begin to unfold this book to make sure you understand this is the real deal this is the real thing that you're going back to the manifestation of your sonship of your culture of your inheritance it is real watch god sent jesus to make the inheritance real to me because there was nothing i could do to inherit it it was blank there's nothing i could do but in the fullness of time god sent his own good time jesus the lamb slain from the family of the world his blood was shed here we go are you ready that i might go back to my inheritance [Applause] so his blood was shared enough for you to occupy a church pew and say i'm a church member i belong to this tabernacle that's not what his blood was shed for his blood was shared for you to go back to your inheritance oh glory to god glory to god what inheritance

brain god he finds your repeating prayers praise our moses and what are them saying they're one thing but when jesus comes and said he said teach them how to pray our father what in heaven hallowed be thy name and to worship and tactically come and whatnot and he run them through the whole prayer and on top that he said i give us this day or daily bread yesterday adoration and worship and everything else and then he cap it off with forgiveness forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us [Music] everything inside the prayer you know faith in their virtue in their knowledge everything inside that prayer right after forgiveness and then thy kingdom come ready for the kingdom to come [Applause] [Music] that's right when you're ready to forgive they're ready for the kingdom to come [Applause] how many ever know how many know jesus said so the bible said do you not look do you did not your law say that you are gods and you call them gods which god said in

people abraham said the bride should be in the word to know how made the revealed word your husband your husband and my man the pulpit you crazy that was taken without the context your husband is christ that's your husband he was looking for a bride that's why he's an eliza not have a bunch of husbands all around his one husband is christ he's the head of the body called the church i want to say like he is the head the cap the church is the bride's body which is the mystical body of jesus christ so you can't fit the bride into one building into one country or one language or tongue out of many nations tongues and people all over the world god of people for his name's sake this gentile bride that jesus christ died for coming to a close because we're coming to the top of the pyramid we have not to preach this morning oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah we are now coming to this great hidden mystery that has been hid for the foundation of the world nor being revealed to the last days to the sons of god hallelujah you believe it to be true that the son of god has to be manifested that's a hidden mystery sons have got to be manifested preachers preaching but we're not talking about that but ibrahim was an example son so you can say sun come out and shine four days storm coming and rebuke the storm and the sun coming and shine four days because the sun son of god spoke it little fish dead in the water all of a sudden the pillar fire rolled off the mountain strike the prophet said little fishy i give you back your life little fishy i give you back your life you have power just like god have power to release life i give you your boys i give you your son [Applause] what's that manifestation that is manifestation that's not a pulpit talk that's not a sermon that's not an exhortation that's a manifestation that was the main church oh give the lord a shout [Applause] glory it wasn't even the church you don't have to be in church glory to god you come in church you get equipped you come in church you get empowered oh my hallelujah glory to god what is manifestation making known oh glory to god and as we grow from lutheran age baptist age methodist age pentecostal age we are right up to the capping stone waiting longing for that cappuccino to sit down in the building the bible said we're living in the last days the top of the pyramid the cross fishes of cancer age the coming the time of you the lion oh my where are we at we are the right watch the we are coming at the the time of the comet believe the lion the captain stone so that's why when the thunders came the land rose it was the end of time that's why when the angels swore time shall be no longer almost time yourself runs out but in the days of the fortune of the seventh angel he's coming behold i said elijah watch before the terrible day of the lord so elijah come the closure of the egypt loudly and age introduce a bright age where is a short time this is only shorter age a short time because they kept getting the aqua dhaka according to the prophecy of isaiah gross darkness cover the earth but i'm put by faith a little lighter represent you the bright coming fought remember all the homosexuals all the sodomites well they increasing in strength and power they're growing in recognition and everything else they're legalizing them and everything else all that is a sign the bible said nothing happened yet until the iniquities of the amorites are full so god wait until the cup full to make his move he written for you to make your move to make it to make his move praise god everything have to have his place sodomized have to have his place let the lukewarm church never have his place and abraham the elect with the angel have to have his place also do you see it serum condition return as prophesied as one days or noah oh glory to god so we are back in noah's day we are back in those days the spirit that was back there is back here and the heavens have our time oh hallelujah my god so we in the days of the capping stone in the days of the manifestation of the sons of god we are right at the end time you believe in dispensations the bible said in the description of the fullness of time what is the fullness of time they have been dispensation of the mosaic law dispensation of john the baptist there was the dispensation of christ there's a disposition of church organization there's a dispensation of the of the holy spirit now is the dispensation of adoption once the world is waiting and groaning when the fullness of time comes when the dispensation the fullness of time what is the fullness of time when the dead rises when the sickness ceases when all the earth ceases to groan the fullness of the dispensation of time tell me my brother when was there a time that the sons of god was to be manifested outside of this time now when there was a time in history that this was a manifestation the time to deliver all nature nature itself is growing and waiting for the time of the manifestation which i believe will be in the fullness of time now all things have been brought coming up shaped into a headstone to the manifestation of sons of god coming back here we go are you ready the spirit of god coming into these men so perfectly until dear ministry will be so close like christ till he will join him and the church together this have nothing to do with this pastor fighting this pastor this church fighting this first jesus christ which is foolishness which is all over the message we're not talking about that we're talking about the ministry becoming so much like christ not so much like a politician not so much evil and so among the people with nasty seeds not that that's not christ that's human that is natural okay the spirit of god commented these men so perfectly until their ministry will be so close like christ till we join him and the church together the church are you ready join the let's get we got to go now i'm i can't finish it right now is the last time before the convention are we have no communion service next this evening so there's one service so we're making a combine all right the church the church is supposed to be predestinated into the adoption of children where god can take a man and adopt him into the family and give him something do you believe that god could have a man and give him [Music] what's the first thing you do not the second or two the first thing to do he said the first thing try that see if it's right so my brother gets some kind of power whatnot and he come and my job is to try that and if you don't want me to try it we know something little wrong i said come bring it bring it bring it bring it bring it and come back bring it to the pastor and come you say i'm not bringing it go with it wherever it comes from go back with it because if you have it and it's right you're not afraid to bring it uncomfortable but your lord tell me don't tell nobody about it go back with it lord and tell me that brother he said bring it and come that's the authority to try it first let's continue see if it is right if it is right we thank god for it move right with it but we have to try it so any minister say you have to take it rebuke you because you're questioning me you're questioning me yes i'm questioning you don't question me don't question me don't even question me is it a word though do you not panic because you know this is sharp like a reason you know i am here not only the question but to challenge you because paul said if an angel comes from heaven much is on the pulpit if my angel come from heaven and preach any other gospel crack the bookshot and shoot you know [Applause] because that demon want to destroy you because that word is destructive a forced teaching force structure is destructive that's what the devil introduced in the garden of eden yeah god said you shall not surely die god did not say that god said you shall surely die devil twist it don't let the devil twist no word we come too far to turn back now [Applause] we come too far to bring strange fires [Applause] too fast to bring some offering of strange fire oh my so watch the whole a watch this man claims a certain thing try it see if it's right if it's right move right with it and say lord send us something else keep moving on watch until everything takes place every fellow takes place that is when the philistines go to backing up shorts will go off here will go down face will be washed single will be missing that's right when the church begins to get into his mighty power when they have a nasty sapphire few of them you will see that holy church stand together in its power positionally placed as sons of god adopted into the family of god powerful truth standing there that is what he's coming for what's going for a powerful church not no flimsy church not no whimpers church not no fight church a powerful church man and woman know how to pray not to call upon god not to shake themselves and get out of the way that's a real gift when you could get out of the way oh my he said look i'm going to skip here we shall be so on fire for god we should be going day and night nothing should be able to stop us we should be so sweet so pleasant so kind so christ-like in our lives it takes our everyday life let's take these three words again so sweet i hear that they're like 116 [Music] sweet after service i'll give you the honey take take two dose drink kitten we'll make it sweet but that's how you have to be so sweet so pleasant there's some people so unpleasant they look unpleasant they carry themselves unpleasant the way they can look you you won't talk to them this is unpleasant a smile has got a long way you know i hear there's better the muscles it's easier to smile at the front you're sticking the pressure to the front you know so they're pushing a hard face because everyone will talk to you and whatnot but if you ease up one thing it will easier stress when you smile it's a hell teaching to smile you know you don't know how you light up somebody you know beam them smile oh hallelujah praise god hallelujah praise god i'm going to come back my grandson says that grace and a knock on the door and knocking the door and he'd be there looking forward and he brings a smile he knew his mother going to open that door when she opened the door he just beamed us man she has this man he is waiting with that smile he's waiting he's just waiting expectations for that smile that's why he must come to service under a smile or worship a thanksgiving to god our gratefulness and whatnot you don't come back you're gonna come up with your shoulders hook like that you're coming you know your wrist back is shake back your shoulders this is the place to ease the pressure don't come in and get pressure please please stay home stay back go back here's the place the easy tension like a bend backbone he has a place to easy tension pressure you're pressing your job pressure when you come here oh my so good to be here hallelujah isn't jesus sweet sweet sweet you can make a song on that one jesus so sweet hashem has a sweet song hallelujah why you're coming to worship god praise god and god could say in heaven look at my people down there they're under trials they're not testing but they're worshipping me they love me i have to do something for them i have to bless them my god look how they love me i send them some to the waters i send some to the flood i send some to the fire but all them come to the blood but look at them all them praising me some of the lions then some of the fiery furnace some too hard trials some loses and lose that but they love me anyhow oh hallelujah praise god then become a love of fear then you have no fear in your spirit and your heart for the future you're not living by anxiety you're not even biting your nails you have confidence in your god he brought you out all these years he took you through up the mountain down the valley when he was in a hell hole he pulled you out your hell hole he set your foot up on a rock he delivered you from this he delivered him that oh praise god hallelujah deliver one child one child get back bone he deliver next child praise god but he's showing you that he could deliver you you had testimony before you see the power of god come upon them if it come upon once it could come back again come on if it hit you once it could hit you again come on same as somebody [Applause] a fire struck you before it could strike you again [Music] it takes an everyday life to have this kind of life not a sunday life or everyday life you're pressing your way as a christian god is calling his children aside by manifestation they don't have to say one word about it no paper testimony necessary so kind so christ-like god calls children aside by manifestation they don't have to say one word about it you see something happen positionally placed sons of god god getting into him into order exactly with the same thing and he just has as much authority his word is just as good as an archangel even better the son was adopted put on a high place set out there change his robes change his colors the father's ceremony this is my son from henceforth he's governor he's ruler he's over all my heritage all i have belongs to him oh praise god that's the reason the coming of the seals at the finishing of the seventh seal the mystery of god should be finished to know who god is what he is how he lives his nature his being you are supposed to be all the way up there by that time to bring us into the full stature of the sons of daughter of god here you come right back to the mystery of the seventh seal and under the seventh sea of seven thunders and he's saying we supposed to be all the way up there by that time all the unfortunately supposed to be in there by that time what time the fullness of time when the fullest times have come it's time to see the manifestation of the sons of god we are waiting on it oh glory to god hallelujah praise be to jesus hallelujah seven seals but ibrahim now for the end time message this seal he revealed all the six seals but he don't say nothing about the seventh so the seventh seal is for the anti-message first four seals history also fifth field on the altar fourth seal the b system and so on six year uh earthquake seven seas silence it don't say nothing but the seven seal but the end time seal when it starts will be a total secret only when it starts but at the finishing we just read that you're supposed to be way up the road now all faith and virtue and knowledge and temperament at the finishing what it is for the top of the pyramid when the pyramid comes to each step we are at the end time the opening of the seventh seal oh glory to god so when he made man of god he gave him a domain as the domain goes from c to c from shorter show he had control over it and jesus came being the one without sin he proved it when the winds blowed he said peace be still so it was more than talk he proved it by manifestation isn't that right then he said if you shall say this mountain be moved don't doubt you shall have what you said so go back to genesis now the world and nature is growing moving for what for the manifestation of the sons of god when true sons born sons filth and speak and their word is backed i believe on the on the border of it now say this mountain and brother desire so and so i give it to you in the name of jesus christ oh praise god from future who am i almost done now in ephesians 1 10 he said you're putting down it's called the fullness of time it's called not the seven days called the fullness of time when the fullest of time has come when time has been fulfilled when there is no more time then you go into eternity after the seventh church is over luther's age is over methodist is over pentecostalisation is over now you're going to what eternity no more sevens no more trees no more other than eternity oh my that is where the fullest time is at give me a church oh we said that oh praise god hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord praise god to this coming of the stone i'm going to close up musician please the coming of the stone upon the church in the glory cause it ended the gentile dispensation god ended it up with the coming of that stone so friends the coming of the capstone ends this gentile dispensation and the capstone is in two parts revelation and manifestation oh i'll close with this hallelujah oh glory to god oh hallelujah praise god that the worshipers are rising hallelujah and the only way okay jesus said there's messages to go to all the world then at the end shall be after this message born to all the world and the only way that god can preach the gospel today is through that lump of clay so god can't preach god put your mechanical tape he has to appreciate two lumps of clay thus men and that's the reason you sick people have the right to come and say lord jesus if you only heal me now i may not be a preacher i'll talk about it i'll do everything i can you are the vine i'm one of the branches and so forth okay now let's go let's work for them in order to preach the gospel before you can make it a gospel preach you have got to have power and demonstration of the holy spirit amen to prove the gospel the letter kill it and the spirit make it alive so the gospel is truly the gospel when it is preaching power and demonstration could we all stand and give god some praises as we worship the lord albert auntie gonna lead us in some song are we gonna close oh praise the lord let's all stand and give god some praises give him praise this morning oh oh hallelujah do you love him today oh glory be to god hallelujah thank you jesus glory be to god hallelujah this is my jesus [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] my [Music] me this [Music] hands is [Music] my head sweet holy spirit all this [Music] oh [Applause]
