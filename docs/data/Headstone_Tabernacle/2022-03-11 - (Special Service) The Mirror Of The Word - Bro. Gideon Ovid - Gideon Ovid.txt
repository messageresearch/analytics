you to turn to [Music] one portion of scripture tonight i'm gonna read from philippians chapter four and we want to read from verse four to thirteen of philippians chapter four and these are the words rejoice in the lord always and i say rejoice let your moderation be known unto all men the lord is at hand be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be known being known unto god and the peace of god which passed all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus we see finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatever things are of a good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things those things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do let me deadline again this is paul he said those things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the god of peace shall be with you but i rejoice in the lord greatly that now at the last your care of me i flourish again wearing he also careful but you lack opportunity not that i speak in respect of want for i have learned listen i have learned in whatever state i am there to be content i know both how to be a beast and i know how to bond everywhere and in all things i am instructed both to be full and to be hungry go to a bone and to suffer need i can do all things through christ which strength let me may god bless his word i want to read this what we just read here part of it in the amplified and it says here rejoicing lord delight love your thoughts in hell again i say rejoice let all men know and perceive and recognize your unselfishness your considerateness your forbearing spirit the lord is near is coming soon do not fret or have anxiety about anything but in every circumstance and in everything by prayer and petition death the night requests with times given continue to make your wants known to god and god's peace shall be yours that tranquil state of a soul assured of its salvation to christ and so fearing nothing from god and being content with its early earthly lot of whatever sort that is that peace which transcends all understanding shall garrison and mount guard over your heart and mind in christ jesus for the rest brethren whatever is true whatever is worthy of reverence and is honorable and seemly whatever is just whatever is pure whatever is lovely and lovable whatever is kind and winsome and gracious if there is any virtue and excellence if there is anything worthy of praise think on and we and take a count of these things fix your minds on them practice what you have learned and receive and heard and seen in me and murder your way and living on it and the god of peace of untroubled and disturbed well-being will be with you i was made very happy in the lord that now you have revived your interest in my welfare after so long a time you were indeed thinking of me but you have no opportunity to show it not that i am implying that i was in any personal want for i have learned how to be content satisfied to the point where i am not disturbed or disquieted in whatever state i am in but this is important how he phrased this that i am satisfied to the point where i am not disturbed or disquieted in whatever state i am i am i know how to be a beast and live humbly in straightened circumstances i know how to enjoy plenty and live in abundance i have learned in all in any and all circumstance the secret of facing every situation whether well fed or going hungry have insufficiency and enough to spear or going without and being in want i have strength for all things in christ who empowers me i am ready for anything and equal to anything through him who infuses inner strength into me i am self sufficient in christ's sufficiency i want to re repeat that last line here in the amplified i am self sufficient in christ's sufficiency what a word what a word tonight and tonight i am hoping that uh we can be helped to get out of and there's a thing that struck me about passivity i hope i seen it right passivity and that that word passivity being passive passivity is acceptance of what happens without active response or resistance acceptance of what happens without active response or resistance and that come like if like russia was expecting to maybe reach the capital of ukraine teeth yes in um maybe three days a few days and it'll be over because they are big bad and everything else but the people didn't accept or was passive towards that they responded and the in chemistry it is called the state of inactivity and i hope that something we said tonight that will rose you out of that statistic in that state that you could be active to learn active to change i think sometimes i wonder sometimes if people resign themselves to the place where this is how i am you're hearing a word but this is how i am and you you have heard that we spoke some time about from talking about people hearing the same thing and different responses one of the toughest things for me in ministry to deal with where couples are concerned and you hear me say it and you hear like maybe over and over is when you find a husband and wife and none can't help the other it's one of them is one of the most stressful thing to encounter you can't tell either one much because none can't help the other you hear me say at times i do believe half and half should get married i believe somebody has this whole whole two whole people is who should come together not half not three quarter and a half or cortana a half you know like two valleys would make a mountain and a two people that don't have uh are not in the right minds faith and spirit it's it's rough and even though they love the lord and they go to church and they hear the word they'll be issues because of this inner self or in a man or or sometime we call it low self esteem low esteem and because of that the reaction is the different one of the thing of somebody with that high confidence or high self-esteem people use that word is the ability to admit wrong the ability to be honest the ability to be confident the ability to hear and um and feel comfortable in the custody of your skin you don't have to pretend you don't have to defend you don't have to make excuses you could be sincere because you are not insecure if i could use that word when somebody is insecure then their reaction is a bit different they may be controlling they may be um how should i say not temperamental but manipulative because of that insecurity uh they may be over you know trying to control people and controls lives because of that kind of insecurity and if you take that into ministry now somebody having that background or if you come beyond it pull but not you could see how they would run the church and run people's lives because they themselves have issues internal issues and these things must be dealt with and i read the scriptures tonight and you know what the overlying thought i had there was think think on these think on this think on this there's a thing on this because there are things that you know bibles talk about whatever is lovely whatever is a good report uh think on these things that things that we could share things that would help us things that would bless us and edify us that we could learn from it and paul paul was a learning person and in this age and time sometimes what you learn said 10 years ago is not on void now because knowledge is just flipping over things are changing and you have to be willing to adapt and it's sad when you see people that not willing to adapt will interchange willing to address and in this kind of life you have to be able to adjust you get your thinking adjust for your feeling and and and and the anchor point of that script to help that is the scripture where paul said i can do all things through christ strengthen me and that is our inside confidence that is not i go to church that is not dependent upon what others see that is something president in him that he could verbalize it and express it all things to confront the world i can do all things it doesn't matter i can cope i can deal with my issues like here's some time where i have a spiritualist you had to figure it out and you have to figure it out and sometimes if you don't have the knowledge if you don't have the understanding if you don't have the wisdom it is hard and that is why sometimes in this fellowship and this sharing you could benefit so much from it and learn so much from it if you are willing to learn you have to have a desire to learn and even though you might be 80 89 92 94 it doesn't matter what age you are there are always things to learn never adopt the attitude that there is nothing more that you know it that you have it because that's only you're hiding there listen to some things and i'm going to wrap up here because we have something else somebody are going to share something with you so let's go back he said some someone asked me some time ago shall i shall we seek gifts now for our ministries some messages brethren who had just received the holies i said no don't do that when you do that then god can't use you i said the only thing to do is just go ahead being a christian if god has called you he pleased you just exactly where you belong usually those who seek and try to get things if god would give them something they may more or less be a stuffed shield so right here you could see but i'm dealing with growth maturity dealing with the fact that asking for gifts asking for these things um and we not grow to that point of maturity we get puffed up we will get attitudes saving these brethren from that by sharing with him don't do that don't put it that way he said usually when that the man that god calls is the man that's trying to run from him if anything moses paul different ones trying to get away from the call we find here that god in spite of all failure that moses had done he still had his hand on him he called him to go do his service call him to his commission and what a consolation that must have been to joshua when he heard god said as i was with moses so i'll be with you although here we go if i am trying and i feel so some people don't like to try because they don't want to feel so instead of going and trying and flopping and falling now that's a that's that inside issue when they get out tonight i married on if i am trying and i feel god won't leave me i never have much confidence in anybody that's too afraid to do anything are you like that you're too afraid i would rather be from a failure than too lazy to try and this is where i want to motivate you tonight or inspire tonight to try don't be lazy and do nothing because you don't want to stumble you don't want to fall you don't know don't try one time it was said that the ballad and ballad flower company hired a man and he's going to sign his name and the man had no erase on the end of his pencil and mr barron said to him why haven't you got eraser he said i don't make mistakes he said then i can't use you because if you make mistakes you don't make mistakes you you won't do nothing that's true god don't hold you responsible for your mistakes he hold you responsible for your willful sin either since willfully after you've received the knowledge of the truth but a man here we go that's going to do something is going to blunder don't be afraid to blunder because you're gonna do something you see a man that is gonna do something is gonna blunder okay things may go salt as you see all right here we go he says now he's going to fall he's going to make mistakes but if he's really divinely cold and god is in his heart he'll rise again he used to be coming to the church here years ago and they may be here this morning a little man and his wife used to sing a song that truly you go something like this forgive me lord and try me one more time i'll be yours if you will be mine if i fall or if i fail let me rise and try again forgive me lord and try me one more time you say i like that for any good soldier is up to get wounded or hurt but if he is still a soldier and got a purpose and sometimes a fight for he will rise and try again and any good soul of the cross will do the same thing okay let's continue but i was preaching this message about perseverance and he said i got a thought i got a thinking of virus listen to this what he said yes many men is perseverant watch this now before you can be persevered before before you can be persevered you have to have faith in what you are trying to achieve now that fate he's talking about here this stuff is internal you have got to first have faith before you can be persevered so faith and perseverance works hand in hand together they are brothers you must believe or you'll have no confidence you won't know whether you are right or wrong but when you have reached that place that you are fit and what you are trying to do then you can be procedural so you know now um i assure you see that kind of talk that can't get you very far too you have to know what do you know what do you have confidence in okay the word the confidence that god has called you if god has called you he can keep you if god has called you he can lead you if god has called you he can speak to you he was talking about what i was thinking the beginning of the history of our nation it behaves information when a handful of soul is in the cold winter day and the odds all against them there was american soldiers when i read the history of our nation it makes me cry in my heart their leader was a christian the delaware was frozen over ice gorges in it i understand about half of the american soldiers did even have shoes on their feet with stuff wrapped around their feet them was american soldiers the obstacle was great the odds was against him and yet after all night prayer until he was wet up to his hips and snow where he was knelt in prayer the great leader became perseverant for he had assurance of god that he could cross that delaware anyhow he was perseverant although three bullet hole was placed to his clothes he had heard from god and no matter what the odds was he was he could be persevered because he heard from god and believed that the god that was leading him to victory for this great nation was with him so therefore the delaware froze over meant nothing to him no matter how much ice there was or what the obstacle was still he could be current because he felt he had god on his side how great that is when we can hear from god and be rest assured that we are right in this fellowship there is nothing to greed there is nothing great enough that can stop that person men that ever amounted to anything at any time through any age has been men who believe in god had faith in god and stood against the enemy on every side and was perseverant they believed in god i believe every christian therefore should be very perseverant oh my then we went on he said now watch i cannot have confidence in myself i cannot have confidence in yourself together we can have confidence in what has taken over ourselves the holy spirit has taken us over we must have confidence in that and as we place our confidence in that then the results come so you see what paul says paul said it and that's what we read praise the name of the lord blessed be the name of paul talk about the sufficiencies in god he is confident in the sufficiency of god isn't that right and then i think we read this here that in is the go and that but that is the god the creator living in you and given you all the powers then you are in possession of anything that he had so it is in you to abstain from evil to do good to shun evil to flee to righteousness to turn away from temptation all malice hatred strikes envy and so forth turn away from it for that will take him from your heart if you will receive him and embrace him and love him and hold him in your heart and love him i tell you the church together and that kind of power has the power to find the heaven heal the sick open the eyes of the blind the death speak the dumb speak the death here the cripples will see why it's recognizing the power of almighty god in your heart he is dear deity oh blessed be the name of the lord he said but that we know that there's going to be a bride almost done what i'm going to share and there's going to be a wedding supper served in the sky that's just as to be as god is because it's his word and we know that those that are going to make up that bride is going to be his church they are going to appear before him without spot or wrinkle and they have here we go are you ready they have the material on it now to make themselves ready let me read that again they have the material on it now to make themselves ready if you notice it says she has made herself ready look what he says next so many says if the lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking or from gambling or from lying or stealing i'll serve him but that's up to you you have got something you have got to do something too dearly overcome shall inherit all things they will overcome you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down see she has made her suffering you are something to do what you are something to do and this is my point the point tonight is the word come for us to apply and this self-worth self-esteem how you deal with you how you see your inner self has more to do with you than you think and one writer put it as the confidence in our ability to think and to cope with the challenges of life the confidence of our right to be successful and to be happy i remember as we would know the older ones will know years ago like poverty is christianity like the poor you are you more spiritual you are because you come for the poor you preach the gospel to the poor and you know all kind of benefits of coco stuff but the truth is god gave us life and this to live in is not to be miserable not to exist not to be harassed and terrorized he said i come to my life and have it more abundantly so therefore god wants us to have confidence that he will like he said i'll never leave you enough for sick you want us to have confidence according that says i mean i was young not all i've never seen the righteous for sleeping and seeing big bread look at equilibrium 3 22 says wherefore i perceive that there is nothing better than a man should rejoice in his own works for that is his portion for who shall bring him to see what shall be after declarations 5 18 to 20 says behold that which i have seen it is good and comedy for one to eat and drink and to enjoy the good of all his labor that he taketh until his friend all the days of his life which god had given him for it is his portion every man also to whom god had given riches and words and had given him power to eat thereof and to take his portion and to rejoice in his labor this is the gift of god for he shall not much remember the days of his life because god answered him in the joy of his heart so to face life with low confidence low esteem christians are going to church and you know uh and we and i we got my very young age 21 and you know as god show meetings of her and by oneself we worked on it and i was amazed to see the confidence that she growed into in life and to testify to people and testify to fools and so on like that and whether she go in the clothes show or buy a piece of clothes or wherever she goes she's always seeking that opportunity to share something about the lord jesus that somebody could know about christ and come to the gospel and so and it's really something that i admire of her over the years as a soul winner and i know that lacking that oh i should i say she wasn't always like that she grew into that and i know that there are things that we are not in right now but we could grow into it and all the doubt about you know you're feeling now how to to be blessed and to be and to be successful and and all this is what god wants of us i i i want you to be obviously prosperous your soul prospers he wants us to be healthy he wants us to be blessed he wants to be happy to be joyful the first part of the scripture he said rejoice always rejoice in the lord god bless you give your life you're not a crook you're not a bandit you're not robbing people you're you're you're you're supposed to be enjoying the lord this is what god wants of us and in on that blessing that we can live better and we could respond to challenges in an effective manner that the world and people outside of christianity could admire how we deal with this thing you know so i believe that one of the things that shows up the confidence the assurance of somebody's heart is your willingness to admit mistakes have encountered christians well they call self-christians who they care accuse them of anything not me not me always not them everybody else and that's why they don't change because they never they can't come to the point admit that they're wrong they're defensive they can't be sincere they slide on their hands in church but this is something on the inside so to me the higher that inner part of you half with god is the more open you can be the more sincere you can be the more you could communicate effectively and clearly and to me this is what god wants you at home with people to the poor you become important and rich you become rich you know you have to become all things to all men that by all means you can save some so uh we have to begin to live a life that is how should i say it are comfortable measurable like we could measure our lives and you know if oh okay so i'll say this sweden i'm gonna close and we're gonna have something else coming to you if you know you are not doing the right thing this is you knowing that nobody else this is you have personal issues regardless of how people love you value you respect you you have issues loving your own self respecting yourself because of what you're doing because of your internal issues now when paul said what you heard what you see in me do it means that paul was consciously aligning himself with the word and with god not just in talk but in life so he was talking from a position of internal confidence because he was lining up conscious subconscious word values so if let's say for instance we not we don't believe in smoking let's say you find yourself puffing something in the corner okay you know you're not supposed to be doing that so right away you don't have the confidence in yourself to have faith to deal with certain things because you know nobody else knows you're puffing something up this way until you deal with that and things line up there'll be a great struggle and i trust you lord this is just like a taste uh i'm looking to see if god could help us drill down into some of the internal stuff that we could get the help that we need because some people accept themselves dear and they live in that level of passivity in which it's almost like if well you know the enemy coming what could do is strong be powerful but paul said i can do what all things through christ constructed me i'm gonna close with that tonight tonight we're gonna have a special uh something to share with you tonight from brother gideon my son gideon and um he came by me my home home sometime it was last week and he's just talking casually and talking about a client that he met and we're gonna talk and they begin to share some of the things that he was testifying to him about the lord and the man said i tell him oh god he's trying to bring conviction to me and different things but i would just listen to him and i was amazed at how he took that time off to share and witness of the lord to this to this guy and after he left i got this thought why not you know to ask him to share something whatever and that is how this comes out tonight so at this time i want to invite the gideon and he is going to share a few thoughts with you tonight but again uh feel free to come on now write the breakthrough good evening good evening since i i'm not sure where to start what i want to say though i feel like i am about to run the second leg of a two or two man race i pray that as i share my little my little part that it will truly be a blessing to somebody and somebody will be it's a benefit and i believe that um what i'm about to share would be meaningful and insights inside subtitle and truly inspirational before i start however i just want us to bar heads and pray pray for me and pray for what is about to be said oh lord we thank you for this opportunity lord lord we thank you for this this time these moments that we've posed i pray that you would take my few broken up words lord laws it'd be thoughts that i would try to express and articulate as best as i know how i pray that you'll anoint my lips lord anoint my thoughts as i speak lord that you could really minister to the hearts of the people gathered here tonight and those who will be blessed and see it even afterwards lord i pray that we be careful to give you all the praise honor and glory in jesus name we pray amen so i just want to say thanks for the opportunity to be able to share in this way and with that said i know there was a background that's been laid and it was simply you know within the context of business at times they they have have told us or taught us and some of the things they would say is you don't talk about religion you don't talk about politics there are things to stay away from when doing business and i met a a i can't say a young man this was a mature guy and he said you know in his experience he's been up and down he has seen the best he's seen the worst and i happen to have met him at one of his his lower ends and with that said he said you know he was in church and he probably goes to church when he can off and on but he was struggling he expressed you know his life was in a mess his finances were in a mess in his words everything was falling apart and it was at that time i decided to go against the principles i was taught in business and i asked him the question i say where's god in all this and he looked at me he said wait you come to convict me this hour i know telling you how bad things are how terrible things are my family fall apart this guy when i say fall apart he is about to embark upon his third divorce all right his house is about to disappear right so it's real bad and here it is and i'm asking him where's god in all this you tell me i have a background in church and stuff and it was interesting my response i i couldn't have predicted it or planned it but my response to him was you know i'm not here to convict you i'm not here to condemn you i'm not here to chastise you as a matter of fact i say you know you remind me of of of some characters i would have read about jenny biker and look you see you're gonna preach to me tonight i say no i'm not a preacher i say we're just having a discussion we just have enough conversation and there it is i thought you know what i was about to present to him although it was unplanned it may have been for him at that time a mirror to reflect on for him to see where he was at for him to see himself and one of the first things i shared with him was the story of the rich young ruler as told in the bible but just before i and i'm watching my time i i don't i don't intend to be too long i just want to share a little context from the prophet's message and i want to just read something very very brief you know and in the message identification chapter 38 he said this little lad must have been raised in such a home and when he came down to visit his grandmother she had uh a door that let me just expand it a little bit yeah a door that's on the back side of it was a mirror and the little lad was kind of lonesome and he was looking all around the house and after a bit he happened to look through the door and it had been closed since they they come in and in the mirror on his side he saw a little boy and he started to the little boy to make friends with him and as he began to look into this glass he got up close and he turned around he said why mama that's me and that's what we want to look at tonight i want to look at me i want to look at yourself and as we look into god's great mirror of his word let's our be able to identify ourselves with some that we're going to speak about some of the characters of other times and i want to see myself in god's looking glass because if anything will show you where you're standing it's this book there's no book like it it's cause it's all the truth i don't say that other books are not true but i know this one is true it's all truth because it's the word of god now jesus gave us the example of what we ought to be looking at when he reflected his life to us through the word what we should see when we look into god's mirror we should see ourselves identified with him that's the perfect example you know and it had me even going to see what a mirror was what what exactly is a mirror i know we could probably all relate to a mirror but really by definition a mirror is a surface typically of glass coated with a metal amalgam which reflects a clear image and i want you to hold that thought that the image coming out of the mirror must be clear for us to really see ourselves right and as i shared with him he said you know i could understand and i said you know the rich young ruler came to christ not because he was a bad guy not because he was doing a lot of wrong things i say i don't even think you are a bad guy things may seem bad with you no but really i i do think you're set out to be a bad guy but let's just examine that story a little bit and see what we could learn i mean this is by no means a bible study or anything but i want to share this so we could perhaps all benefit in this way so as we see here in machine 19 i hope we could all see it i'll try to expand it a little bit in matthew chapter 19 verse 16 to 22 you know it says and behold one came and said unto him good master what good thing shall i do that i may have eternal life that's a question he posed to jesus and he answered unto him why call us down me good there is none good but one that is god but if thou wilt enter into life keep the commandments he said unto him which jesus said thou shalt do new murder thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not steal thou shalt not be a false witness honor thy father and thy mother and thou shall love thy neighbor as i self the young man said unto him all these things i have kept from my youth up what luck i yet jesus said unto him if thou wilt be perfect go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasures in heaven and come and follow me but when the young man heard that saying he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions and therein lies the challenge to this man i spoke to it seemed that everything was bleak and dismal and dumb and i presented this story to him and said you know what there was a man kinda like you he was okay he did all the right things and he couldn't really explain what he was missing and i mean i have the time to really explore the fullness of the story there because jesus just handed him a card and said listen why you call me good do you realize that the only good one is god and went on as if to ignore that and answer this question directly he said but i know what you really came here you came to understand what more i have to do and this is what i posed to the gentleman at the time that it may seem as if you're in a scenario and looking for answers but really the answer is not from me or you or friends or family and loved ones but if you look in the word if you use the mirror of the word sometimes the answers are very very clear so the young man in this context he said you know i obey the commandments i follow the law i'm pretty sure with the confidence he had to speak to jesus directly like that as a rich young ruler it meant his parents perhaps were business persons he probably had great mentors and went to the finest schools he had no issue communicating and being articulate and being able to express the things he wanted however he had a very sincere and genuine question which was as a matter of fact i see you with these disciples here but what's wrong with me how could i earn this eternal life that you preach about and speak about and people follow you are wrong to find out about and jesus almost brushed him off and say you know what do the basics and he said i have done this all my life i went to sunday school bible school every school i could do academic school business school and i'm a success and i'm here seeking the wisdom that you have to offer but what jesus told him afterwards so after he passed that test what jesus told him seemed a little too tough for him to manage so the bible said he went away with sorrow he was sad he was aggrieved because jesus said sell all you have and just a few moments ago we heard jesus objective wasn't to make him poor you know god's desire wasn't for him to be living in poverty wasn't for him to be a beggar or destitute or anything but god knew despite what he looked like on the outside there was something on the inside to be fixed that man couldn't help him with that it wasn't an academic exercise and and go and say to our father and to hillary mary in that sense there were things that he had to deal with that nobody else could see or nobody else knew and as a result if he would just grab a hold of faith and go forth it would have been read differently today i want to switch back to the conversation i had with my my client and i went on you know you say over boy you you're a guy you know you always want to to tell me something you always want to advise me you always want to guide me and i said listen hear what hear what you do have to take that one i could share that but i'm not saying you have to apply that one i say what i want to share with you is something a little different so with that in mind once again unprepared i said listen i'm sure you know it it's a familiar script scripture that of the prodigal son i say you know it two brothers one decide he felt enough he go and do his thing and i said it kind of reminds me of you that's why i'm talking to you about these things i say because you were on top of the mountain no this is a former businessman he knows what money looks like he was a multi-millionaire an ex doctor board now right and i could probably just just pull it quickly when when he is faced with reality of pretty present tense he was forced to realize that he looked just like this guy he said in luke chapter 15 just part of it verse 11 to 12 24 it says and he said a certain man had two sons the familiar scripture would have to find financial tall and the younger of them said to his father father give me the portion of goods that follow to me in other in other words i want my inheritance whatever your plan to give me give me no he divided onto them his his living and not many days after the younger son gathered all together took his journey into a far country and there wasted his substance with rare trust living and when he had spent all their rules a mighty famine in that land and he began to be in want and he went and joined himself the citizen of that country and he sent him onto his fields to feed swine and he would feign fill his belly with the husts that this fine did it and no man gave unto him and when he came to himself i want you to look look at this because this is the point at which he starts to reflect on the mirror he starts to look to see a picture that he's not a custom seeing because of the position in which he's in so he says when he came to himself he said how many hired servants of my fathers have bred enough and despair meaning how many servants my father back home have that are well paid and paid sufficient to have to give away because they have enough to spare and he said but look at me i perish with hunger and i will arise and go to my father and will say unto him father i have sinned against heaven and before him and i am no longer worthy to be called thy son make me as one of thy hired servants and he arose and he came to his father but when he was yet a great way off his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him and the son said unto him father i have sinned against heaven and in my sight i am no more worthy to be called thy son but the father said unto his sevens bring forth the best robe put it on him put a ring on his hand shoes on his feet and bring hither the fatted calf and kill it let us eat and be merry for this is my this my son was dead and is alive again he was lost on his found and they began to be married now i read that scripture if just to show what might have been possible had the rich young ruler been obedient to what he was faced with in the face of the mirror of the word when jesus spoke unto him and said sell all you have give to the poor and the instruction was and come follow me i could only think for a second the the the lepers that came to christ seeking healing and jesus said you know what go show yourself to the priests in other words i give you an instruction i want you to be obedient and follow it follow it through he knew what the outcome was going to be he knows the end before the beginning he knows the end of the story before it start yet he wanted to see obedience to the word of god he was the mirror in in in the flesh he was the manifestation of the word on earth and it goes to show in looking at the prodigal son once you could reflect and see clearly where you are as brother over just shared and you see your mistakes and you repent and you turn around and you correct it and you fix it and you're willing to go back to that place that you left christ you could see the rewards that were waiting for him he killed the fatted calf he put a ring on his finger he decided to gather the flocks to get a guarded house together to be mary in other words let's have a celebratory party let's have a rejoicing time because this is somebody doing the right thing and i know it might be going through your mind you know on one hand we had somebody who was seemingly okay had all the ducks lined up and on this hand you had you might say this is a backslidden person this is somebody who knew the right thing and he moved away he walked away and yeah but you know there are other types too and i didn't want to leave it alone so as we spoke he say yes boy over your right you're right you're right you know you know this bible thing and i say listen it's not for me to know the bible thing these are just words i could share words with you but it really takes you to go into action it really takes a decision it really takes a choice so i could share and brother branham preached he said listen he could preach until his hair could fall off yeah here i could turn brilliant he had to tell whiter he had to turn great you could use all the scriptures all the quotes you could preach until you have no more words to say at the end of the day it's by the grace of god you're saved and it's by the grace of god you're allowed to get that opportunity to make that choice to make that turn to make that change to make the decision to do differently than you were doing before with that said you know i reflected again because the thoughts continue to come and i say i know he begged me don't preach to me tonight don't convict me tonight don't take me to church but there was something welling up inside me and i told myself listen if i lose this business here i'll lose it but i just have to tell you tonight i have to tell you this before i go and i thought for a second i say you know you're right you know it's not necessarily by your works it's not what you do or what you don't do it's not if you're right or if you're wrong i say i can't judge you i can't condemn you right i can cause you to to be convicted you may feel convicted but i can't do that to you i say you ever wondered why you're going through what you're going through now i say because the first question i ask is where is god in all this where is god and he say you know i never thought how i ended up here i said because i need to tell you another story i say there was a man i said i know you know him i said there was a man whose name was job and in his time i said you know he wasn't doing anything wrong he wasn't doing anything super right in that sense i say but hear what happened to him he was living such a righteous life such a life pleasing to god that god built listen to what god built god built a wall in our time we call that a pyramid offense right i think not necessarily every home but the average home has what we call a perimeter fence it helps you to feel secure so in your home your home may have walls and then you may have an outside fence whether the fans have a gate or not that's an outside fence but guess what god went one step further and i'll read it for you in a second and the devil actually said but satan said listen you have a hedge even around that fence right so you say this is not a fence that you could unlatch a gate and walk in no you have a hedge and and you know what i always believe the the the scripture says it way better than i can i stutter when i speak at times i may mix up things but his word never fails his word is always the truth so let me read it for you from job chapter 1 very familiar scripture here and just reading verse 6 to 12 it says now there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord worship they present themselves and satan came also among them and there's something in particular i want you to look at and the lord said unto satan whence cometh thou then satan answered the lord and said from listen from going to and through in the earth and from walking up and down in it so you know you go into the grocery you going to work you go into school and you think is you alone going to school you alone walk in the road and you go into church but listen to what he says he said the lord said where you know come from right because his sons are god presenting themselves and you show up where you coming from and he says from going to anthro in the earth and from walking up and down he walking all around looking for mischief and the lord said until satan has now considered when you busy doing nothing going up and down looking for people to terrorize have you considered my silver job that there is none like him in the earth so all the places that you walk you haven't found anybody that could be compared unto him and this is the description he gave a perfect and an upright man now i say that and i told you i told the gentleman this i said because we can clearly say even brother branham said jesus loved the rich young ruler you know that he was he was a great guy he was a guy going places he was a businessman he was an exemplary person i'm sure it's a society but when given the challenge he failed the prodigal son we could say you know what he was a backslider he left god he left his father he left what he thought and eventually he came back but you know with job god described him as a perfect and upright man not doing much not doing wrong he said one that feared god in verse 8 and a stuart evil then satan answered the lord and said job fair god for naught in all in other words satan is asking you feel he fear you because he fear you for nothing just because and this is the description i was alluding to before has not dull mage and hedge about him so that sounds like a hedge right and then you know what he says and about his house so you form a hedge about him then you form a hedge about his house about all that he had on every side everything that he has that he is associated with you form a hedge around that thou has blessed the work of his hand so everything he touch everything he does you have already blessed that and his substance is increased in the land his cattle his his his i mean everything this man touched as we see turned to gold everything expanded every every boundary he has has been enlarged his plans prospering his animals prospering his family prospering once again god didn't want the rich young ruler to move from his status of being the rich young ruler god wanted to highlight to him that he had something to do that he was not prepared to do that he was not prepared to give up it goes on in verse 11 of job one he said but put forth thine hand now and touch all that he had and he will curse thee to thy face and the lord said unto satan behold all that he has is in thy power only upon himself put not fought thy hand so satan went forth from the presence of god and i paused there because it made me wonder you have a a minute what god is saying about you you ever wonder what satan is saying about you i say a prayer every time i leave my home once i step in my car this is the prayer i say and i could sing it because i say it all the time i say lord i want you to bless me i want you to cover me i want you to cover my car cover my family cover my house cover my assets i use those words right the orders might be mixed up but i say that you know why because when i leave home i don't know who could try to interfere i don't know like job adventure seats and at that time say you know what he just seemed too cool you know he just seemed like he have it in order he she going to the bank let me just mess this up but you know what i pray that god will do that to me every single day multiple times a day you know why because we just read through scripture in the bible that these are things that are taking place and if god is the mirror if the bible is the word of god and the word is the mirror i should be able to see myself in the world i should be able to see my flaws i should be able to see my challenges as a matter of fact when jesus was under they said you know they didn't want anything be uncommon they didn't want anything be strange they wanted him to really have a solid firm understanding of what we go through so he can relate to us which is why he didn't speak one way or give one parable that answers all he gave multiple the same way we learned differently he used different approaches so this is what i did with the man i was speaking to i didn't give him a scripture and say hola because i can't predict where he is i can't predict where you are god knows that i don't so all i could do is throw the different types of artillery i have right the goal is to kill you so a knife may not work by using a gun a gun manager you work at using a sword you know i i want to throw things out to ensure at the end of the day the message gets home my time is almost up but i want to share one more thing just one more right and you know it was such a joy to me and it was so natural to me that i wasn't trying to pretend to him i wasn't trying to teach him something spiritual we were just talking i wasn't reading scriptures or quotes or anything to him i tell him i said man listen yeah what's going on i can't tell you why you're in the position you're in but i could tell you in the bible it have some folks that summon just like you i'm not sure which one it is but i could give you the options you choose you do you allow god to work based on the options are shared hopefully something will resonate with you and that's my prayer tonight that something will resonate with you that you could see yourself and you could make the adjustments you need i can't say whether you're good to great i can't say whether you're down or you're up i can't say a rich or poor but you know what god knows and he ensures that all things that's what romans 8 said for we know that all things work together for good to them that loves him to them that are called according to his purpose and i believe the fact that you're here tonight you are called according to his purpose the fact that you you are here tonight is similar to the victory rich young ruler you've come to hear what more can i do what good should i do what more could could be added to my life my prayer life i i read the bible i read the scripture i listened to the messages the quotes i go to church perhaps with over the last two years i've been locked down right i have been feeding on convention tape but what more can i do we always say church is not for the well special services are not because you feel awesome and great you come to get recharged to to tweak a little bit to change a little bit to to structure and help adventure you could be improved per adventure you can be pushed further down the road to perfection at the end of the day god is coming for a church that jesus could walk through it that can happen if you caught up in your thoughts and ideas and and self and pride and jealousy and greed and anger and things that we can't see you need to deal with that you need to see yourself in the mirror and see the way you have to adjust as a matter of fact in a practical sense if you have an important interview or important person to go see if they did we just had national awards i believe in trinidad if you had to collect a national award today i'm pretty sure before you leave home you will look in the mirror whether you have the best clothes or clothes half clothes however it is you will look in the mirror as a reference to ensure that you are clothed appropriately for the occasion that your attire could be reflective of what is necessary for the occasion you want to perhaps ensure that that that your clothes match that that it making sense and with that said you know i wanted to to ask you a question just for you to think a second we often hear folks loosely say choose your struggle choose your challenge choose your battle choose your fight and all that i'm sharing here i shared with him i say you know you've told me things about your family life and your finances and stuff but oftentimes you ever thought if you had to choose what choice you will make i say if the choices that you were presented right look like sickness health related challenges broken relationships family drama financial struggles things that people may go through on a day-to-day basis i said if you had to choose a trial which one you will choose and i stay quiet awaiting you choose i couldn't exhaust all but i'm saying if you had a true a choice to be poor to be sick on the brink of that you know to to have your children disobeying disobedient your child locked up in jail which trial would you choose you call yourself a christian right which trial would you choose and reality is when faced with the options i know which one we'll choose you know i believe we'll all choose the same thing and the choice we will make is to choose none which is why god is the chooser god is the one that has assigned it to us and that's what i shared with him i say you know if you had a choice which one you will pick sickness which one you'll pick poverty which one you'll pick yeah and he realized he couldn't give me an answer so i answered for him in this case i said that's why god does the choosing you don't get to pick the trial you want and say you know what lord i signing up for sickness no you don't do that you don't say lord listen i signing up for poverty and no you don't so god knows based on his goodness based on his foreign knowledge based on his predestination what you need to make you stronger he knew after job went through his struggles that job will be there and say listen do these kin worms destroy my body yet in my flesh i will see god god knew exactly the characteristics he wanted to come out so he knew what to send him through is the same reason that moses was sent into the wilderness after killing one man for 40 years god knew the education the knowledge he thought the ideas he had that he wanted to burn out that he wanted the desert itself to really excavate from from within him so he could say lord um you know what i was a ruler in egypt i was somebody i was a member of the who's who i was only one percent but but lord i can't talk lord um i don't know what what what to say what to share you want me to lead two plus million people out of egypt and and i am i am in the desert yeah i'm a farmer now i'm a family man but that is what god wanted to send him through in order to let him come out the other side of the line ready to go into action i know time is running away quickly and i did say i want to share one more more thing i want to take the opportunity to do so for now is one more thing i i i really think is something i want to leave with you something i want you to think on and it is found in the book of genesis genesis 13 verse 5 to 12. i mean i don't mean for this to sound like a bible study at all but genesis 13 verse 5 to 12. it speaks of lot and it says unlocked also which went with abram had flocks and herds and tents just as a context when you read tense and we could read this statement again it says had flocks and herds and tents tense speak to stability ten speak to be implanted being grounded verse six and the land was not able to bear them that they might dwell together for their substance was great so abram was not a poor man lot was not a poor man their substance was great so that they could not dwell together it was so much and overflowing that they couldn't be together in the same space verse seven it says and there was a strife between the hood men of abraham's couple and the third man of lot's cattle i want you to watch that there was no drama between abram and lot they were related the drama was between their hoodsmen right and the canaanite and the parasite dwelled them in the land and abrams abraham said unto lot let there be no strife i pray between me and they and between my hood men and thy with men for we be brethren it's not the whole land before thee separate thyself i pray thee from me if thou will take the left hand i will go to the right if thou depart to the right hand i will go to the left and lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plane of jordan and it was well watered everywhere before the lord destroyed sodom and gomorrah so this was pre-destruction even as the garden of the lord like the land of egypt as thou promised unto zore then lot shows him on the plane of jordan and lord journeyed east and they separated themselves the one from the other abraham dwells in the land of canaan and lot dwell in the cities of the plain and this is the most important line as far as i see and pitch his tent towards sodom and i had a thought you know i read this and i read this and i read this over and over and over and that last line struck me and pitched his tent towards saddam and what i wanted to take away from there is not the fact that he was wealthy not the fact that their substance was so increased that they couldn't coexist but he pitched his tent in a particular direction and oftentimes we we have heard it said his intent or his intention was not to go to saddam but he pitched his tents towards south sudan and if we read the very words by nature his intent and his tent was in opposing directions his intent wasn't to go but his tent was going so we as individuals have to be careful where we plant our tent where where we push our tent where where where we want to settle the direction in which we want to plant it because i didn't say when we speak tent we see flock right we see herd we see tent tent mean you're settled so you have to look at your tent and work right you may love it and you're subtle and you're comfortable and everything is okay but but your intent may not be to be in a particular place but because you have placed your tent and planted you attend to what a particular place you find yourself there right it's it's similar to a christian saying listen i'm a christian i don't smoke i don't drink i don't do this or not in the other but i'm going to work in a bar because i can't get at work it's just a matter of time before because you've put your tent there your intent may never have been that but before you know it all of a sudden you start off with a chandi you know you start off with a little thing then you know what you're just mixing the drinks you're not drinking it you're just mixing it so so you're you're doing something for the clients before you know it you involved in it hook line and sinker so i read that so you will be careful of where your your directing your tent right the direction you're going where you want to settle and with that said i am i'm almost closed i'm almost done i'm almost out but there's something i must read i'm not putting it on the screen but i must read it's actually a simple prayer that brother branham prayed i know it's thoughts that were we'll chop together i pray that that god will really stitch it together and making meaningful to your heart that you could look and reflect on the mirror of the word and see where you are see where you're falling short see where you have to improve and with that i just want to read this last prayer a simple prayer he prayed and it is from modern events that are made clear by prophecy preached in 65 the 6th of december and it goes like like this and tonight so far as i know the church maybe the time of calling may be already passed i don't know i can't see remember the people went right on having the meetings just the same after the crucifixion of jesus and all the people they'll come they watch they they'll go right on preaching and saying they're getting saved and everything just as if the world continues on as it was they say but it'll be too late then while you got a chance my brother while you got a chance my sister come into the kingdom of god you don't have to come in under anything else but just plain faith to believe his word he is that word lord jesus i know i'm looking at myself now in the mirror of god's word oh how short i am but dear god here tonight on this he says monday nights i say friday night on this monday night here in san bernardino california and i say here on this zoom call that we have in trinidad right here this is all i have lord but i'll give it to you will you take me as i am lord will you let me flee to the cross right quick i even see the messengers i see the time i see the calling out of sodom i see the signs i see the abraham's group receiving the light i see the manifestation jesus being manifested again right among us like it was i see all the things that you promised i see the impersonators i see you said that as it was in the days of moses how jamborees and janice would come back to imprison it and still remain right in that same dump that they were in see they couldn't follow moses through that wood and take those children out of there into the wilderness because they were associated in egypt they couldn't do it though they done the same works he did but their folly was made manifest and the bible says that thus said the lord it will take place again in the last days and you see it with your own eyes if you're spiritual um i can't explain it it's not necessary for me to explain it my sheep hear my voice let's go to him now while we have a chance will you if you have need of the baptism of the holy ghost if you have need of a rededication a new life your pastor won't despise you he'll love you for it just give yourself completely to god tonight while we're here let it i know it's been hard cutting strange i don't do that to be mean i do that to be honest i do that because i love you i love god and i do it to try to help you and truly friend i i i believe and with all my heart with all my faith i believe that my message comes from god it's it's been proving that you through the years now listen tonight surrender everything you've got everything that you have need of i believe with a true surrendered heart if you'll just stand up on your feet and raise up your hands to god and say dear god here i am take me lord no more will i try to use my own mind and my own interpretation your word says i must be holy i must be born again i must be filled with the spirit and then the spirit will lead me into all the truth dear god here i am lead me and with that i say god bless you i i i i am finnish tonight praise the lord thank you for the gideons he said we appreciate that tonight god bless you praise the lord how many appreciate that tonight uh i believe i was inspired to invite him to share what he testified to this man and this is the fruit of it so at this time we want to close in prayer and ask for blessing upon your father god i thank you for this special night special service and i pray it be something that will encourage and strengthen and and and to see that gideon what he had to share flow right into the thought of the internal stuff that we have to deal with so father may each one here tonight be blessed be inspired and see what they have to do what more what do i lack here you see you have something to do and we all have something to do lord we have to make a church that would make a revival father god made start tonight start in the house of the people that it wouldn't be in passivity further just waiting for things just to happen but they will become active active impressing forward for this fate to be made manifest amongst us granted lord bless you services coming sunday may your anointing be with us in a special way and jesus may ask it email amen god bless you thank you so much for being here have a good night god bless
