seated uh just before we read the scripture want to read a testimony here I got this testimony a greetings in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ last week Thursday while at work I hooked up to the headone Tabernacle link via VIA YouTube I went through the song Service as usual by precious but anonio bran I felt God's present resident and I knew that something special was waiting for for me I found myself opening up subconsciously to receive directly from God I never knew what was coming but I was ready by the time you started preaching it became an octave hire Lord God I felt scorched out I had to replay the message all over again in a backtack fashion today is making it the third time I've played that message short quick and Powerful but AB Bram said the spirit proceeds the word my sole purpose of sending this message to you precious Pastor to over is to show the devil publicly whose side I belong I am not ashamed to give my testimony that the Lord Jesus Christ delivered me from a long standing Spirit of resentment and bitterness a lot of times I have Justified my actions but this time you give me by impaction a spiritual scissors to cut off the webs of bitterness and resentment of My Life by the preaching of the word so I can access all God's blessing and goodness I know I am free and liberated to approach god with an increased service I am ready for a continuous growth process as we wait for the dynamic to strike us thank you precious uh Pastor over for yielding yourself a tool in the hands of God to be a blessing to God's children around the world we are portions of God children that are beneficiary of your ministry here in Sweden may God bless you and the head Tabernacle for your label of love uh humble brother your humble brother brother Peter Alfred uh he's in Sweden and he send his testimony praise the [Applause] Lord and this tonight so tonight we want to stand and we want to go our Bibles one scripture 1 Corinthians chapter 13 we want to read from verse 8 to13 uh from 1 Corinthians chapter 13 reading verbs 8 charity never feel it but whether there be prophecies it shall fail whether there be tongues it shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things but now we see through our glass Darkly and then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known and now abided faith hope charity these three by the graes of these is Charity may God bless his word you may be seated let us let's have a quick word of prayer father God I pray that you'd bless the word take me out of the way be glorified and be magnified in all midst in Jesus name I ask it amen praise the Lord amen this week I had a special uh time fellowship with brother Andrew lulan and he was sharing some things with me and as he was speaking you know it's like almost like a scene of vision seeing certain things that ties into all what we are seeing here it was such a blessing I said man you giving me messages after messages after messages man just talking fellowshipping and things begin to unfold so tonight I felt this is a message to follow Sunday message um and this the title I have here is that which is perfect is come and have an inspiration the reflection is the Perfection and this is very important this part here the reflection is the Perfection and this exposes all the false claims of adoption that ministers over the years have claimed to be perfect adopted and so on this make uh that that looks so foolish because the reflection is the perfection in other words we have to be able to reflect Jesus Christ not not no for our message and forward Mysteries and forward no no no the reflection is the perfect Perfection but I'm saying when Christ can be SE manifested in your flesh made alive like it was in Moses in other words the word becomes flesh itself in other you punch him you stick him only Christ could come out nothing else could come out but Jesus Christ isn't that right okay let's go God wants the church to love him that's what I title this a little paragraph here but I'm talking about the woman with the Lost coin I know we beat that over like a tune but we had to beat it again until we catch it but she scraped the floors and one bir tell me never I noticed that the neighbors saw the dust flying we never saw that before that that's when you're really cleaning up you don't care who see you know you're pelting out things you know you know some people brushing in a corner and they want to see much dust inside the house forget it they you to get fling things out throw things out you don't care who see what is getting out of your life isn't that right and then he said here she had a house cleaning time she scrubed the floor She swed the walls took down the cobwebs she kept on until she found that she had lost and when she did she called her sister chur to come now then prophesied he said I don't care if you're Methodist Baptist Pentecostal Presbyterian come let us rejoice together when that time come that's the prophecy in other words whether you're twofold six seal no seal half seal whether you press play no play you saying when you playay high low you hear from some Angel some cuckoo Angel whever he come and rejoice with us praise God that is the prophecy here now when the church finds his Brotherly Love prophecy that means it lost we have the find it because the devil it don't make no sense you see I can't say if I was the devil I can't play the devil but the devil wouldn't bring no press if you know he inside the church he owned the church he's resident in the church he's resident be the pulpit B scripti text do you understand that so once the Believers off key he don't touch them leave them so they can't produce nothing no Revival no breakthrough no healing no signs no Miracles keep them like that let them say they believe a message because they devil believe and tremble and people in the message not trembling they just believing but he believed too but if the bride strike that honey where the devil can't come between you and your brother the devil have an issue he has an issue then because there is no room to come between you and your brother because the honey sticks hallelujah oh give the Lord a shout I'm praying for you you praying for me back to back we face each other oh give the Lord some praise hallelujah hallelujah my back is to your back oh glory to God the devil can come in between we rocking Hallelujah in prayer we Rocking In Praise we rocking in Thanksgiving oh give the Lord I shout the devil is booted out he is kicked out you are still my brother you believe this you believe that but we will keep the unity of the spirit until we get to the unity of the faith oh give the Lord I shou in the house has nothing to do with Doctrine has to do with your spirit Hallelujah so this prophecy is still hanging hanging when that time come when the church finds his Brotherly Love wait all them bitterness in the groups where it all the separation division where it when ministers came get the Bel to Fellowship they want to Fellowship on behalf of the Believers them is big is M popes the only people that there cheap not not not not they are stewards you know that is their own if one leave as adultery Spirit adultery go to the next church but I'm say you could go wherever you want to go just don't don't cut somebody else off Hallelujah God bless you brother God bless you as you say people come here we say welcome they go we say bye-bye no love lost we still love them I ain't going to lie on them and talk and Ne about that some them will still come back because we still treat them right because we are Christians that's how we supposed to be I'm not supposed to whisper you know he do what she do and he do have nothing to do with that God bless you amen amen amen amen you're talking bad about me doesn't matter people see all kind of things it doesn't matter with that you know I have a have a goal I them in Miami they don't have a heaven they have a hell and they're putting people in heaven putting people in hell you can't they do have that they're not controlling that but when the church finds his brotherly love one when the church finds his holy decency brother love brother love you can't walk in fridge and take off man you know I mean you have to have behave yourself you have to have on top of Brotherly kindness have holy decency S I love you I love you smelling food in your kitchen kitchen to help yourself to the food that's no brother love that's foolishness so you need hold to go on top of that and then the final part is where we have adoption and the chase finds his place in Christ I placed Sons adopted Sons Vindicated Sons these three things Brotherly Love Holiness in place in Christ it will call to the other members of the body come Rejoice with us and this the B God want the church to love him not the pastor him not some Deacon him not some group him not some teaching him not some Doctrine him not we have it so not that him oh give the Lord a shout God wants the church to love him God love the group him oh praise the name of the Lord Brother brandom and this is one M called gifts he said he said um we don't have to have one thing to fear but be just a lovely little care child who is looking up to the father every minute and depending on him to lead us and to guide us by loving him that way you wouldn't do nothing to harm him if you do anything to harm him or all through the night your hot tears would run down your cheek in Repentance amen because you wouldn't hurt father for nothing you wouldn't hurt your little baby You' hate to do that you would hate to hurt the feelings of your wife or your husband how much more your lord and savior if you love himall if you love your wife you wouldn't hurt her if you love your children you wouldn't want to do anything wrong to them how about your heavenly father so do I speak with the tongues of men and angels do I have all knowledge and all wisdom though I have faar to move mountains and have not love I am nothing where this tongues shall cease prophecy shall vanish and so forth he said loves endure forever that's my team is love law Works fear law is negative works is negative but love is positive it is absolutely positive and I love this part you can trust anybody when they love you that's a big one you can trust anybody when they love you not because they fear you but because they love you and that's how I trust him because I know he loves me it's a love of fear not a works of fear or a fear if if if if if there's no if to it God's done it and it settled it I love him for it oh glory to God hallelujah could we give the Lord some Praises tonight the devil is just trying to scare you out of something he's trying to put something off somewhere say some of these days you'll be this you are now now are we the sons of God we are seated together in Heavenly places not in the Millennium we are now and here the bum drop what you are here is a reflection of what you are somewhere else oh give the Lord a shout so the reflection will be the Perfection because what we are [Applause] here is a reflection of where you are somewhere else then he dropped the scripture to back it up those who he found you when do he call he justified those who Justified he has all glorified already in the presence of the father we have a glorified body wasn't that deep or if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting so what we are here is a reflection of what we are somewhere else so if your Deeds are evil you know where it comes from you know where your other bu is waiting so what is he saying there as we get nearer to home oh my as we get nearer to home we are getting nearer to Perfection so then we have to reflect Perfection and this has nothing to do with a man behind the pulpit this is for brothers sisters mothers fathers this is for everyone till we all come hey Hallelujah into the statue of a perfect man to reflect Jesus Christ amen oh these are some powerful stuff tonight brother God was this great spirit so he's going deep now we picture him seven colors of the rainbow watch now God is eternal and he was the perfect perfect love perfect peace perfect Joy perfect satis satisfaction all those seven spirits the devil not in the picture Lucifer not in the picture time is not even in the picture am time May begin yet this is Elohim self-existing seven perfect Spirits there's not the word yet because in the beginning was the word come on preach to me somebody this was before the beginning this was Elohim this was the function of spirit perfect Spirit perfect love perfect rainbow nothing created yet Hallelujah then out of that perfect Spirit here come a birth of the Loos the word the expression of the mind of God or the thought of God God and then you get in the beginning was the word which is the expression of God which is the spoken word god expressed from thinking to word logos and then that form the beginning in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God oh glory to God the Mind became the word hallelujah Spirit became the word it has all been word and spirit oh give the Lord I sh there always been mechanics and Dynamics Hallelujah there's always been that H he was the perfect love perfect peace perfect Joy perfect satisfaction all those seven spirits as we get in Revelation they came out was made up God was Perfection so the brother Bram by Revelation bring Perfection before the beginning the seven spirits Elohim spirits that was Perfection and he said here now watch everything else outside of that has been something perverted from that amen so the only way that we can come back to Perfection is to come back with that Perfection which is God so he's saying the way back to Perfection is back to those seven spirits and that's what the prophet reveal in that [Music] pyramid then we come to Perfection then we have eternal life Without End just forever eternal life Hallelujah all right let's go thank you Lord the other morning about 5 weeks ago now reading I've been out in a meeting I was tired woke up in the morning about 7:00 we go to the Tabernacle this morning and in the morning to my wife she was still sleeping I kind of raise up head of the bed put my hands back like this I was laying there thinking I said hey I'm 50 years old I haven't done nothing for the Lord I've got to hurry up and do something I'll be old after a while I got to hurry and do something I ain't done nothing for the Lord I said but you know I sure hate the idea of having to die before he comes I dread the thought I have to go vitari I have to die and become a spirit I didn't like that at all and while I was laying there thinking that I heard something just as plain as you can hear my voice as I was telling you last night said keep pressing on and I said I am pressing on said keep pressing on keep pressing on the great reward is at the end of the road now I believe it was a vision but if it was I've never seen anything like it I've never seen anything like this never had such an experience to happen to me I heard it again and I hear someone singing that song Lord let me look past the curtain of time just then I felt something happened to me and I thought what's the matter here I looked back I could see myself laying on the bed so somehow whatever Vision whatever translation whatever it is he see himself on the bed and when I look come and running to me it looked to me a million young woman about 20 years old I never see such pretty woman in all my life the eyes look like stars the teeth as white as Pearl long hair hanging down to their waist white robes down to their feet and they were barefooted there were each one excuse me now you woman each one of them was running up and throwing their arms around me and holling our precious brother now let me say this I don't care how saintly a man is as long as he's a human he cannot take the other sex in his female without having a human sensation I don't care you could tell me that I'll tell you you're telling a story if you're a red blooded man now I looked here come a bunch of men look like millions of them come in from this way they all had on white robes they had shagly hair around their neck they were grabbing me screaming or precious brother and I said I don't know I turned around I looked and there I was laying on the bed now wherever it is it ain't very far from here it's in another dimension oh that's a that's a powerful one he said wherever it is it's not far from here it's just in another dimension he said or what I can say I look back I see myself laying on the bed I look this way and there were the people now if I would say perfect that wouldn't make it if I say superb I can't find the English word there is no yesterday no tomorrow it was all now no sickness no sorrow no no sin no tiredness they didn't eat nor drink they didn't sleep they didn't have two but yet they were beings and they put their arms around me and I feel it just like the same I feel my own hands like this so it's not like a ghost it's not your hand going through them and and like like Mist it's real now remember we have people that D going on you sir I look press through the crowd and here come my own darling wife she died when she was 22 and here she come Billy's mother she come right she called me her husband she was making her way through the woman waving at me like that I could see those black eyes just shining she was a German girl she run up threw her arms around me she said my darling brother and there were been a real pretty woman standing there just put her arms around me you said our precious brother then hope she put her arm that was my wife she put her arm around this other woman and said isn't it wonderful he's with us now I said I don't understand this and these men picked me up set me in a great high place and set me down and they were praising God none of them kissing me just embracing me and saying brother our precious brother and I looked people was coming from everywhere and I said what is this and the voice now from no one the same voice that spoke in the room was still with me he said this is perfect love amen could we give the Lord some Praises tonight the voice told him this is perfect love I've always taught the evidence of the Holy Ghost is perfect love see I believe in speaking in tongues but do I speak with the tongues of men and angels have not charity I am nothing become a sounding brass a tinkling symbol so when you speak with tongues and God love with it that will show you but the love that we would have here would be like oh my the love that we would have here would be like starting here from a shadow of a shadow and a shadow into a shadow and from a shadow to a Mist am to a little moisture to a little creek into a river and then into the ocean Hallelujah where it arrives there just perfect you see how far back he put the love it up here let me say it again he he said the love that we have here is like starting from a shadow of the shadow of the Shadow you hear that a shadow of the shadow of the Shadow into the Shadow the real Shadow then hallelujah and from the shadow to a mist and then a little moisture into a creek then into a river then into the ocean so this ocean is the ocean of love amen and that is where we pressing on into and where it's arriving there is perfect everything you couldn't die it couldn't be in any kind of sin I never be able to explain what that place was it was just perfect Beyond perfect and just then I said I don't understand what this is and a real beautiful woman ran up and said my precious brother I'm so happy you arrive and she turned off and look at her and I thought how everybody so pretty and so young what is this and the voice said in here all resemblance of old age and everything is brought back to Perfection that's why there's no old age there there's no gr hair and back pain and your liver and your foot and your heart and you had to measure and you had to take blood pressure that that does exist across there you're going back into that Perfection then this woman really pretty girl just put her arms around me like that and said just keep pressing on I said but I can't understand I said are all these Brams she said all these B she said the voice said they are your converts I said converts he said you see that woman you're admiring she was past 90 when you led her to Christ look at her now no wonder she scream my precious brother I said oh if I could only go back if I could only had a chance I would grab them I'll pull them and persuade them don't let no one miss this this is perfection keep pressing on I turn and look at my buddy I seen it move I was coming to in just a moment I was in room again friends that means he back to back in Trin then back to normal back back to your house this house this body house friends from that time I've been a changed person I don't know what you think about this but when my hand on the Bible that this is true wherever it is I don't know whether it was here whe a vision I never had one like it let's say it was a little translation I don't say it was say my spirit went out went there I I don't know Paul talk about the uh the Glorious under the first seven what Paul must have seen but I am more determined this is my second Revival since then I am more determined to do everything that I can to persuade men and women please be sure of this if God's love doesn't anchor in your heart supremely don't you take a sensational emotion you sure you be be sure you can turn the other cheek and Christ is all and all to you don't you miss it my brother I speak to you in the name of the Lord except you have perfect love you will never be dear hallah cuz nothing could ever be there without it your spirit would be out of place there this is what I'm trying to get to people your miserable cuckoo whatever attitude you have in your house you will get trouble in heaven up there so you're not going to make it it's serious this is for all of us you know I'm not talking down to you or preaching down to you you know I am standing right looking at this myself you know because I myself have to meas up with this this is not this is for the Brethren and we up here somewhere you know we up here nowhere because it's still perfect love to get there I'll be a dumb Dum to tell you you come up come up come up I have to come up all right so watch except you have that perfect love you'll never be dear cuz nothing could ever there be there without it your spirit is a big one now not your text not your book not your mouth not your talk but your spirit will be outter Place couldn't come there be no way for it to come no more it could be for a grain of corn to raise up out of the ground without a GM of life in it no matter how natural it looks it would not raise woo you love him tonight Hallelujah all right let's continue the Bible said come and buy of me gold pure gold tring the fire the old beaters used to take the gold go and when they beat it they would beat the goal and turn it over Beat It beating the drust out of it until are you ready the reflection of the beater he could see it in it then he know he had a drust out of it so if if we can't see the reflection still a drust there licks beat blows trials destines fire turn them over and put some more beaten oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah to get to the reflection you have to get some blows you have to be beaten God have beating you because he feeling beati he's not beating you he beating the dress out of you he beating what's supposed to get out of you because he want to see himself in you he beting all that is not him out of you what Give the Lord some Praises tonight what a word a word from God hallelujah wait a minute did I miss something here all right maybe I get attent ah but take my time all all right so let's go so watch this now so they beat it until the reflection of the beater he could see it in it then he know he had the Dr out of it and that's the way God takes the Holy Spirit and takes the Christian and the church and beats it with the gospel back and forth back and forth until it reflects Jesus in it the Holy Spirit can see the works of Jesus going on in the church then things begin to go fine but there's too much drust in the church today too much I'm not saying it the prophet saying it now there are fine people best in the world cream with a crop but the church needs to make itself get ready amen the bride I love how everything he's saying he has a scripture to go into you know he's not just talking on the top of his head he's talking based upon the scripture because he's a prophet and I want to tell you that's the title that which is perfect is come it is come that's what he brought brother brandham brought Perfection oh give the Lord I shout isn't coming it is here hallelujah Perfection by the word it's already here it's coming and when that which is perfect is come we get out of parts now Hallelujah we begin to want have a desire to line up with that which is perfect which is the word could somebody say Amen tonight you're not pulling back now you're saying Amen to the word might be cutting but you're saying amen might be hard but you're saying amen it might be beaten but you're saying amen you not pull him back why because when I was a child I speak like a child I understood like a child I caused drama like a child I explode like a child but when I became a man I put with childish things I could handle things of God now oh I could handle the rebuke now I could handle the instruction now I can handle the correction now I'm not a child stop acting childish hallelujah oh give the Lord some Praises stop acting childish you have to rant and Rave and misbehave because they get a rebuke hallelujah or you get straight out and your human spirit will get upset my if I stay too long tonight we just go over the [Music] timeall brandom in the Bible time there's next quote this some wise people can't keep Victory they used to take the gold before they had smelters and the beater would beat the gold turn it over beat it beat it till the beat the dress out of it and how he knew that it got down to really good goal all the pirate and fool gold and so forth was beat out of it the beater could see the reflection of himself in it then he know he had it clean clean gold listen my dear friends today when

of this brand new Holy Spirit baptism into a dry formal creedy Church in the message we talking about now message folks you cannot bring this brand new Holy Spirit baptism into a dry formal crey Church you just can't do it now remember I love you with all my heart and I hope that God will let you know but I've got a little boy at home going on two years old if I see him doing wrong I didn't correct him I wouldn't love him you got your children I want to say this and our great move of the Church of the Living God in this nation has become two factions one of them is going so stiff and Ching one of them is going so stiff and stachy and intellectual and the other one when Plum off on the deep end on the other side so you see there two sides one SW on the chandelier the his Fanatics rolling on the floor carrying set of nonsense and what they dream and what they see and the spirit tell them and they hear a voice and what them on that side and they want stiff and they can't move that's exactly the truth brother when Plum to The Fanatic side there is no middle of the road and that's what we have to stay was once that tangelo sweee sweety sweee too sweet other one is a sour lemon what God want is the orange the orange is the middle are you with me now sweet swe sweet honey not the sweet of the Holy Ghost tangel and the other one s L you late a serious because they not Spirit they can't praise worship they can't relax what they stiff that why so serious with it hallelujah praise the Lord all right let's go now brother M start your perfect man first you must be born again when you born again you have faith you believe the word until you born again you will argue against it if you're religiously inclined got a human knowledge you got to do right you'll never be able to agree upon the word of God you will never do it you have got to be born again and Born Again produces fate now after you get Fai you now in a position of growing so faith is not the end faith I faith I have faith yeah you're now starting to grow Peter say add to your faith add to that Faith have six other things to go up the ladder there isn't that right now a lot of people go up to the altar say Lord forgive me me and a great experience of sanctification come upon them then you have a great time at the altar shouting you go back bless God I got it no you just got started you come to a place where you can grow you ain't got nothing yet the only thing you done is lay the foundation now you're going to build a house and you pour on the foundation boy I got her but you got the foundation to build your house on now there is the thing comes in this morning we are going to talk about it all right a house this is the foundation first now building a house you put up the uprights and and so like that right you know the old time and then he he switches now to the gold he used to make gold before they had smelted the burning beating it turn it over and over and over the Indians do that now beating gold and they beat it you know how they could tell all the iron was out of it all the dirt and stuff and the dresses out of it when the one that was beaten could see its own reflection like a mirror in it it was clean and clear enough till it reflected the beter and that's the way God does he takes the gold that he has found in the earth so so now you identifi there now you are gold come on everybody in here is supposed to say Amen when you get gold it doesn't look like gold you know that's why it had to be purified that's why it had a go fire Hallelujah because gold gold does look like a little old stone with little glitter thing on it do you understand so when God M you out from your booze and your bars and all way God find you God knew it was gold but you have your boobs and your bars and you have all them stuff with you and then you come now and the wor that to clean you up and to put fire in you and wash you and then it start to shine here and shine it all there some of you still have your booze and your BS but God going to wash you and burn you out give the Lord some Praises but you are gold Hallelujah the Lord I shout in the house Hallelujah all right so that's the way he he takes a gold he found in the earth he beats it by the Holy Spirit turn over and over beating it he can his reflection and that's what we're supposed to do reflect the Son of God he that believeth in me he could a scripture again and see how I'm doing it uh uh the works that I do shall do also then he Dro into this now so many of us try to do the works of Christ before the reflection of Christ in us that's why I was so scared of gift because I frighten human being just stick onto you know man next you make your God and some of them businesss they taking the goship normal normal you know they taking it on behalf of Jesus Christ these Hypocrites anyhow not going there tonight so many of us try to do the works of Christ before the reflection of Christ is in us now there is the trouble we see these tumbles along the road and we find there we go the scrap heap of Ministers of Christians not just just Ministers of Christian piled along the road is because they didn't go it into it right ministers like scrap iron buying scrap iron going back to the smelter you know old B old bottle buying buying old battery old iron scrap Minister the devil going around collecting them old botle by and that is why I'm here this morning trying to teach this little church how that we can become the dwelling place yes sir of the Living God that's the objective it's not you and how you see it and how you feel it and what not how you can become a dwell in place of the living godallah then he said this here justification watch notice the life that was in the husk in the stalk in the tussel ga the seed so this this is the process of the church ages what we call the church ages smna epes smna pergamos Titus sadis Philadelphia L and church is the unfolding of the life of the Corn God put down a seed and it just begin to unfold and the life keeps growing moving moving until the seed which is the bride which is you gather up all the life so the shock in the message must pull back there are people who have to all glory to God there are people who start with you they will never finish with you because they are of the scaffolding not the building and when the building is completed the scaffolding is removed oh give the Lord some Praises Give the Lord a shout in the house Hallelujah there are people as you could look back in your life they were around you to protect you and after when you grow up and mature like the shock they pull away from you and you are there as the seed getting ripen in the sun getting gold and brown while the heat dries them up oh give the Lord some Praises because that bride gathers up all the life the bride become the seed the Pentecostal was the shock Oh Glory to God they could Testify the life moved through them they could testify they once had a Revival they could testify they once have a move of God but they don't have that move right now oh give the Lord some Praises but the bride she's going to have her Revival oh give the Lord some Praises do you see it tonight so then he said one went to make the other justification made a way for sanctification sanctification made a way for the Bap of Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come down write down in Perfection so that's what the Pentecostal didn't have because Perfection is the word and the word comes to a prophet and they rejected the prophet they rejected the word they couldn't come to Perfection they couldn't come to adoption they couldn't come to spiritual maturity so here he brought you out oh glory to God to lay the word inside of you that you could come to maturity when I was a child I spake like a child I understood like a child but when that is perfect has come it is here oh give the Lord a shout it's the word to form you into the word image that you could reflect Jesus Christ Hallelujah as many has received him to them he gave power to become the sons of God is that instant son is that message son it that spoken book on top of your head son is not that kind of son is you have to become son a process by which you become the sons of God oh give the Lord I shout in the house Hallelujah woo my God almost finished here election in Abraham Hallelujah justification in Isaac Grace in Jacob but Grace in Jacob but perfection in Joseph nothing against him a perfect man a perfect of Christ so our type is Joseph not Jacob not Abraham Joseph a perfect type of Christ he is the reflection hallelujah look at those four Patriarchs Abraham Isaac Jacob and Joseph Abraham calling Isaac election and so on and Jacob Grace but Joseph Perfection nothing against him that was God working its way out so if God start a work in you put a germ in you a button in you a light in you God himself working his way out to bring you to what to bring you to Perfection What is the fivefold ministry for for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry the bride has got to come to perfection in order to bring on a resurrection oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah we couldn't come to perfection in past ages because that which is perfect did not come but when God sent Malachi 4 the Lord a shout he brought forth that which is perfect and we have it here the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication oh give the Lord a shout in the house Hallelujah that is what brotherr brought the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication that's why we can say what the tape say because we know is the perfect interpretation of the word hallelujah oh do you love him tonight [Applause] Hallelujah wo my my my my my my my glory musician Get Ready Get Ready Get Ready Get Ready Get Ready all right this Joseph is what was the type of Perfection I want to talk about the Joseph anointing the anointing of Joseph this anointing is what do make you resist the Jezebels and the ptif for wiv this Joseph anointing you could see virtue in that man you could see Temperance in that man Hallelujah because Satan always prepares his Delila to bring down God Samson Hallelujah while you working on your virtue Satan working on his business too watch something here now judges 16 verse 15 this is theila now recognized that Samson playing games with her she said unto him how can thou say I love thee when thy heart is not with me thou has mocked me these three times and has not told me wearing thy great strength liar so when the devil see a man it may not be a perfect man just a man of God a man that loves God the devil wants to bring down that man that man is you tonight don't look at me now his job is to bring you down and he will use any means necessary to do so whether it's by woman popularity money family friends co-workers it doesn't matter his objective is to get you off of the foundation off of the beat of God came to pass when she pressed him daily watch that devil he say he get frustrated I ain't brother again boy because he a he not telling me no three times he mocker and she pressing him daily you hear the voice tell brother around keep pressing on that monthly press or daily PR give us this day our monthly bread daily bread you have to press daily you have to push daily you have to stand daily you have to withstand daily Hallelujah to fight that devil daily the devil not attacking you every month you know or once a year or twice a year you know it's every day he have minions and demons and spirit and lowlevel demons lowlevel demons to attack you in any way necessary with sickness with with frustration with depression you have to fight back you have to resist the devil he said resist the devil he shall flee why would the devil why would God say resist the devil he will flee he will not flee if you don't resist him because he want to in he want to invite himself to your table to drink some coffee and enjoy a sandwich sitting along with you too but you have to know that's the devil no coffee with me no sandwich me resist him push him back don't engage him he he want to seek to destroy you he want to gather your soul he's not too interested in your body you know it's your soul you want to get oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah so watch this he came to pass when she press them daily with the words and urged them so his soul was vexed unto death and he told her all his heart and said unto her they had not come a raise upon my head for I have been a Nazareth unto God for my mother's womb if I be shaven then my strength will go from me I'll become weak like any other man and when the Lila saw now she know this no trick now B when El saw that he had told her all his heart she sent and called for the laws of the Philistines a lot of brothers don't even understand that some of them women out there girls out there soal some them soal like Christians you got to watch them because they don't know who Lord they Ser Samson was interested in Li but he didn't understand she was under her Lord and when she finished the job with him she went to her Lords and said I have the secret now take him then the Lords of the Philistine came up to her brought money into her hand so she was do it for free no this sister was something else but this sister taking money she made him sleep up on her knees she called for a man and she caused him to shave off Seven Locks of his head and he been to afflict him and his strength went from him and Paul Samson he don't even know he Shake himself like he go the anointing come back upon him and he didn't know he he's ordinary man that Samson this woman prent Daily let take another man man called Joseph watch the anointing upon him now Hallelujah Gardener he get promoted part say fix my house run my house see what everything he ordering Market Goods he handling everything including man everybody came to pass after these things his master's Wife cast her eye upon Joseph she said lie with me and he refused she said unto his master wife behold my master what it not that what is with me in the house he had committed all he had to my hand there is none greater in his house than I neither had he kept back anything from me but thee because th his wife this is Joseph talking here now this is the Joseph anointing now thou his wife how then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God there's a man that love God this is the Joseph anointing he Lov God he said how could I do that you are his wife Oh Glory now you would think because Joseph bust her opening that she done let me hear the next verse it came to pass as she spake to Joseph day by day Samson get day by day and Joseph getting day by day look the difference he speak to Joseph day by day that he hack not unto her to lie by her or to be with her so he a bing with her she just burning ears but she pres on came to pass about this time Joseph went into the house to do his business and there was none the men of the house were within so she was timing things she caught him by his gar said lie with me he left his garment in her and fled and got out Joseph knew when to run he run straight out Hallelujah jailed and all but that's the Joseph anointing we're talking about wherever God put you you're blessed he put you in prison the anointing with you he put you here the anointing with you people walk away from you the anointing
