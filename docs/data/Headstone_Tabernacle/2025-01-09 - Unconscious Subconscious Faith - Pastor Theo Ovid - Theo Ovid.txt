read bless your word as it spoken and bless the word as is received in Jesus name we ask it amen and amen God bless you I'd like you to turn to your Bibles to three portion of scriptures tonight Matthew 16 want to read from 13 to 18 Mark 11 20- 26 and Luke 15 8-9 reading Matthew 16 reading from verse 13 when Jesus came into the course of cesaria for Philippi asked his disciples saying whom men say I son of man am they said some say John the Baptist some Elias others Jeremiah or one of the prophets he said unto them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said thou the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed are thou Simon B Jonah for Flesh and Blood had not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto you the th Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it in Mark 11 reading from verse 22 Jesus has cursed the thick trees disciples saw it dried up by the roots verse 2122 says and Jesus answering said unto them have faith in God they saw a manifestation that blow their minds Jesus said uh have faith in God for verely I said to you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he sayth shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he say therefore I said unto you what things soever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and he shall have them and when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any and your that your father which also in heaven May forgive you of your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses final scripture from Luke chapter 15 verse 8 and9 either what woman having 10 pieces of silver if she lose one piece do not light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligence till she find it and when she had found it she called her friends and her neighbors together saying Rejoice with me for I found the peace which I had lost let's pray father we thank you for your word tonight and I pray that your presence will come into your word and Speak Life into your people we are needy people tonight and we our hearts open before you in Jesus name we pray amen you may be seated praise God thanks for coming out tonight it's a blessing to have you here tonight tonight and those that connected online God bless you pray that God be with you and inspire you before I start tonight I have a poem I like to read from you for to you uh someone share this with me this whole thing that I'm going to read and I thought it would be a blessing to the church the title of it is yourself to blame by Mimi white Miller that's the point if things go bad for you and make you a bit ashamed often you would find out that you have yourself to blame swiftly we ran to mischief and then the Bad Luck came why do we fault others we have ourselves to blame whatever happened to us here is what we say had it not been for so and so things wouldn't have gone that way and if you are short of friends I'll tell you what to do make an examination you'll find the faults in you you are the captain of your ship so agree with the same if you travel downward you have yourself to blame and this is some words after this far too often we find ourselves complaining about our situation or environment rather than taking the appropriate next action necessary to create the life we want to live it is very easy to fall into the Trap of blaming others or routinely feeling victimized the next time you find yourself heading in that direction reflect on this poem make an examination and see what you find fine no excuses you are the captain of your ship you can do it upon reflection make an examination you would find that there's an appropriate next action that you can take and you already have everything you need including permission act now take the appropriate next action that will move you closer to your objective only those who act will Triumph praise the Lord so I trust that this was a blessing to you I was a blessing to me and I trust that will edify you praise be to Jesus Hallelujah okay so I have a title unconscious subconscious fate that's the title have tonight unconscious subconscious fate and the definition of the unconscious is the part of the mind which is inaccessible to the conscious mind but which affects behavior and emotions I'll read it again the unconscious the part of the mind which is inaccessible to the conscious mind but which affects behavior and emotions let's go what it's the lady with the glasses on here she stands right here before me there she years amen virus isn't it sister right there you got a virus isn't that right they don't even know what to call it that's just an excuse the doctor give you that's all but it don't do no good now it's over you can go ahead and be well your faith made you well lot of Fai sits a lot of faith is sitting in the corner here what's the matter people start believing I don't know those people I have never seen them I don't know you but I challenge you in Christ's name to believe the Bible is true and Jesus is raised from the dead forget about those Church Creed and things and serve the Lord believe on him he raised from the dead you serve him in a measure that's right but my dear friend when the enemy come like a flood God raises a standard against it you read all these magazines and things how Satan is on a rampage God is raising a standard against it don't worry he's always on the right side he's always above the enemy all the time do you believe that lady sitting right there yes had more faith than you thought you had so he's telling a lady you do you believe that lady sitting there you had more faith than you thought you had faith is a subconscious Thing lady faith is not a mental act it is something that you subconsciously do it people try to look to the intellects for Faith When Faith doesn't lay there the reasons laid there Faith lays in the soul we give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah faith livs in the soul now if you notice the subconscious is where you live you yourself live there there's a conscious and there's a subconscious so the some subconscious say I believe the conscious say I believe the say you sure now what you really believe is you you know because that's where you really live not the mental part not the front part but the deep inside part if you notice the subconscious is where you live that's where you yourself live that's the reason it is hard for them to have faith up here first they say yes I got faith but down here it's not for me when the storms are raging the little little boat about to sink talking about Jesus he walked out just as cool as he could be and put his foot on the brail of the boat and looked up and said Peace look upon the ocean he said be still and he walked back and lay down and the wave was just as scam that was him Never Scared never excited never fussy they said we know who he is he is Bab we know he does this by the prince of devils he said if sat sat cast out Satan his kingdom is divided he say if I by the Finger of God cast out Devils who does your children cast them out back you be the judge Faith was just a subconscious to him he just walked out because he knowed he was doing perfectly the will of God oh praise the name of the Lord Give the Lord some Praises tonight hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so you have more faith tonight than you thought that's why you are sitting here tonight you have faith tonight that your thought that's why you could get activated tonight you have more faith in your heart than your thought Oh Glory to God good put something inside of you the devil is lying to you praise God the devil tells you you can't make it the devil tell you you can't break through but faith is something that is subconscious Oh Glory to God deep inside of you and what's inside of you deep inside is what affect your behavior it was affect what come through your mouth oh give the Lord a shout if that faith is bured is breaking out of your soul it will come out in your mouth and you'll speak faithful things you would you you would have faithful words praise God you will speaking the word not speaking lies not speaking what the devil tell you you were speaking what God said Oh Glory God said so God said so God said so God said so God can't lie that is the faith that brother manam came to restore oh blessed be the name of the Lord not what your eyes see not what you feel not what you hear like the prophet said it's not what you see it's what you discern by what you see it's not what you hear it's what you discern by what you hear that makes the difference so when he ask a question who do men say I the son of man am and he say some say this some say that all of a sudden Peter break through he caught something praise God he caught something he said that about the Christ and then Jesus said Flesh and Blood have not revealed it to you but my father the question wasn't saying what Peter saying know the question was something Dro on him something inspired him something came upon him well what are you saying right over something have to come upon you that is why you come in expectation that is why you sing that is why you worship because you don't know if the night is your night the Wednesday night I was preaching and brother Sabu caught something once he walked down that step there I W I said but I went home I didn't talk to him you know I said and Mary some have this you know and he is the one that testified to me the next time but I knew it well just as I knew it Jesus knew it about Peter so he could have said he said Upon This Rock I will build my church and the case of Hell cannot Prevail against it because something come upon Peter that made Jesus identify him Hallelujah amen it was a revelation it was a fi he was going to fall he was going to fail but he had a revelation and that was the rock that the church was built on the Rock is not built upon bricks and stones the rock is the church is built upon Revelation so once that Revelation strike you oh what Revelation is fate it's something that is not but is it will be it's not yet but it will be it's something that's revealed to you oh give the Lord some Praises tonight Abraham and Isaac inside of him was not manifested but it was in him he couldn't show Sarah he couldn't show the doctor he couldn't show the neighbor but was something inside of him oh give the Lord a shout tonight there is something inside of you don't let the devil tell you anything otherwise there is still something inside of you give the Lord some praises the devil's a liar all your fears all your failures all your falling there is still something inside of you God told G Peter he said the devil want to S it like wheat but I've prayed for you what he prayed for that your faith fail not I am praying for your flesh I am praying for your head I am praying for your mind I am praying for what you're going through I'm praying for that Faith glory to God because faith is the victory that overcome every situation overcome the world overcome the cares of the life overcome what is terrorizing you right now Faith is the victory Faith still is the victory [Music] H do you believe that so the holy spirit will make every movement like Christ it will make you Christlike the fruits of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering goodness meekness gentleness patience faith those things are what the Holy Spirit controls our emotions our emotions is not so much jumping up and down you could do that a shindig will bring that to you but the Holy Spirit brings you into operation or in control of God that you walk in peace and in love and in Joy with longsuffering goodness meekness gentleness patience you see it isn't something you do it is something the Holy Spirit does in you oh praise God so what you do you make a way for the Holy Spirit you make a way for the inspiration you will make a way to become a channel that God can use then you get out of the way in other words you get a revelation that you are nothing oh glory to God hallelujah praise God hallelujah it is something the Holy Spirit does in you you see it's no longer an intellectual thought of your own it's a subconscious moving of the Holy Spirit oh I wish I could shout the Praises of God around the world to that brother bam said that I wish I could shout the Praises of God around the world to that it is no longer an intellectual thought of your own where you're fighting to figure it out you're fighting to be humble you're fighting to be right you're fighting to be this you're fighting to be that you're fighting with your own mind you kill that you dead that and you let the Holy Spirit Break in on you oh glory to God God wasn't caring about Jacob being a rascal he wanted Jacob to acknowledge that he could get an Avenue open that he could come down and use that man so that's why he asked the question who are you I want to know if you're a hypocrite but Jacob was in harmony subconscious unconscious he wasn't lying he said I am Jacob I am a deceiver he was one with his subconscious he was saying what was he really was okay the Lord I shout he wasn't pretending to be a Christian he wasn't pretending no pretense whatsoever he was what he was he had a temper he had anger he had hatred he had whatever he said I am done he God said I come to change you from that oh give the Lord some Praises when you recognize what you are God can change you from what you are oh give the Lord some Praises you don't have to pretend you don't have to put on sheep and you're a wolf oh give the Lord a shout a new heart I will give you I will take out your shony heart I will give you a heart of Flesh I will give you a new spirit and I will put my spirit within you no longer wolf in the message no longer a go in the message no longer an unbeliever but a Believer a believer of this word you are no longer intellectual thought of your own is a subconscious moving of the Holy Spirit I wish I could shout the praise of God around the world to do that no my Hallelujah there's a quote always thrill my soul you talk about when the Abraham came to came to the fullness of believing I just love that code the fullness you know har a old man you have a son by a wife who old to it's one thing to tell any man you have a son you know but by that that challenge his whole head to to you know he had to go and sleep a not again you next day I can imagine he battling his mind but the Bible said Abraham believed God he didn't believe his feelings he didn't didn't believe his emotions he didn't believe what Sarah looked like he just believed God he had no explanation as to how that will be what he knew is God said so that was the original faith that was the faith in Genesis that was the faith we have to come back to back to the word back to the Bible back to what God Said God can't lie we believe him Hallelujah we doesn't we don't need an explanation we just need to hear what he say oh give the Lord some shouts tonight I love that tonight we don't need to explain it we just need to hear what he say and if he said it we say the same thing we have the same confession it's our Rock confession it's our Rock Revelation Oh Glory to God and Upon This Rock confession I will build my church Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah this message of the hour is much more than people think Hallelujah many people in the message not in the message that's a big one because they have no Revelation in the message I could get for that all the disciples were there and they didn't know who Jesus was they were in the message but not in the message you know who was sure they was in the message Peter because he said about the Christ the spirit brought him in the message Hallelujah he act three and a half years he act them own disciples they in church they hearing specials singing worship and he say who do you say I am and they still don't know you're talking about men say and this one say and that one say who do you say you're following me who do you say you have the books and T who do you say well my pastor see it so I'm not asking you what your pastor see I'm asking who do you say and they couldn't say because they didn't have a [Music] revelation Revelation the greatest thing could strike you tonight is the holy spirit revealing this word to you not revealing the church to you or the Pastor to you the reading the word to you because the word is God and the word could defeat the Devil anywhere any time any place under any condition you can't defeat the Devil but the word can and if the word can defeat the Devil the word in you make you a champion over what the devil could offer oh give the Lord a shout the word by itself could defeat the Devil but take the word and put it in you then you are more than oh go get me started tonight you are more than a conqueror I don't care if the whole world is against you I don't care if your roof fall off and your house burned down it doesn't matter the word is God he'll make a way for you oh glory to God hallelujah he would make a way for you hallelujah hallelujah let's go Abraham fullness of believing but hear this when you let your faith run out to its end till you begin to believe we could say that that but but it seem holding myself you did you hear that when your faith run out to the end till you begin to believe afterwards this impossibility start to become possible because God said so Hallelujah first it starts as a seed like God said that this is going to happen Hallelujah is this is the word but then you start to believe what think I'm Mary she know the scriptures a virgin shall conceive she know she was virtuous when the Angel spoke to her she had a question the question was a very important question how this going to be the angel released the answer the Holy Spirit and when when that when that was spoken that was all the that was the last straw of any questions or doubts you know she ran Elizabeth not to explain not to repeat what the angel says but to confess her Revelation that she going to have a son without emotions without feelings without sensation with no experience at all this little virgin giving a testimony of her confession of a revelation that the angel appeared to her oh can the Lord I shout no other virgin had that testimony no other one heard the voice of God no other one but Mary and Mary represent that bright tonight she has the ability to hear from God oh give the Lord I shout did you get that tonight they should make you run and jump and and spin and go around the church and come back up the bride have the ability to hear from God no man could take that ability from you oh give the Lord a shout in the house the bride has the ability to hear from God that mean God can speak to you oh glory to God you don't have to speak to you true anybody he can speak true to you just like he spoke to Peter so let's dissect this a bit when you let your faith run out to its end till you begin to believe then let your subconscious go to acting then the faith of God will back it up cuz your faith won't do too much your subconscious has to move in the direction that your faith is moving and then God's faith moves in behind and confirms it all oh give the Lord a shout hallelujah my my my my myoo hallelujah hallelujah your subconscious have to move in the direction that your faith is moving Oh Glory your subconscious have to move in the dire direction that your faith is moving let me say it again your subconscious have to move in the direction that your faith is moving your subconscious have to move in the direction that your faith is moving and then God's faith comes behind that the backs that up because your conscious and your subconscious line up together it's an alignment and when God sees that alignment he drops down behind it and back up the whole thing oh give the Lord a shout by faith Abraham by Fai Fai Isaac by faith jeffi the conscious and the conscious line up together and God's faith dropped down behind it those Hebrew boys Oh Glory if you pray we're going to hot that fire seven times hotter they say our God is able to deliver if he doesn't Deliver us we still not going to bow down and we going be dead anyhow so they died out to themselves and they align their subconscious with their conscience so glory of God isn't that right they start to move in the direction our God is able to deliver us hallelujah and their faith was so thundering that heaven start to R Rumble with that kind of Fai the angel want to have water want to out it this one want to partake this one want to come down and drop down God said no no no no no no no this is too much of Fai I going on myself to confirm these boys oh give the Lord a shout God drop them be behind these two Hebrew boys to confirm they had the faith of the Son of God inside of them oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise God and the Lord just shout in the [Music] [Applause] house job know he was righteous he was righteous because he offered atonements he offered sacrifice burnt offerings and so like he knew that he knew he was blessed when the death come because God say Amen do whatever you want with with him don't touch his life and things happen Lord good Lord Lord bless the Lord Lord give and take it away but all that is devil warming up and you give testim Lord Lord take bless ble that when when when when when he Vex day born all story and I have come and tell them you sing secretly Fe L to tell you that I had a dream about you last night your backsliding that's why all this thing happening to you but if job was in that realm where it have so much unbelief and doubt he take that and go and sit down and depression take with them soall righteous Brethren when God finished with job and job say I I I speak to things that I didn't know about I utter things that you know contrary amen I've heard of thee by the hearing of the ear but now my eyes see thee and though and though and though the skin worm destroyed his body yet in my flesh letting the devil know that this flesh that you're messing with there's not the end thereof in my flesh I shall see him for myself and not another he's not asking permission from the elders to say that he's not asking a calling some Pastor to say that it was his Revelation it was his confession he said in my flesh I shall see him for myself I want no testimony from somebody else I will see him for myself and not another Oh Glory to God hallelujah when God finished with that man Hallelujah and his friends come wrong they said God say listen unless you go and repent to that man let that man pray for you and Jo got to forgive them because true Faith the cap of Faith from the from from the end point is really brotherly kindness is a display of forgiveness that's what job had was to do he had to forgive his friends he has to let it go to show he was mature to show he was right so the church has come to the ripness of Bradly kindness which brother brandham put as the Lost coin that this woman lost and she swept diligently to find what she had lost this thing about forgiveness is so powerful because this thing about forgiveness open up a channel that that Mark 11:22 could be manifested whatever you say and don't doubt in your heart let me switch it whatever you say with your conscious mouth mind and don't doubt in your subconscious you can have what you say with your mouth conscious oh give the Lord a shout in the house do you get that tonight whatever you say with your mouth conscious backed up by the subconscious that's believing in your heart you can have what you say and to practice When you pray When you pray believe that you receive and you shall have what you ask for but before that when you stand praying oh give the Lord I shout forgive forgive forgive forgive because if you don't forgive you cut yourself off if you don't forgive you finish and you have a Book and Tape of the message Hallelujah if you don't forgive you're not a believer much people the message not ready the message because Jesus was saying that when you stand praying because you can't just jump into speak to the mountain David got lion and bear Goliad was a different animal that was the third one lion and beer qualify to meet golad before you reach you have one and two so Jesus give the third first if you shall say then he give number two When you pray ask then you give number one when you stand praying forgive so let's reverse it let's start from forgiveness the word influences men but prayer influences God so even though we have the word believe the word we need to access God by this Spirit that's why God hates the intellectual part in this message because the intellectual part don't need the spirit they don't need God because they know stuff but you know in part but when that which is perfect has come which is charity and charity the pr absolute could only come to a Channel of Brotherly kindness that's why brotherly kindness is dear and then the holy spirit is right on top of that to seal the Hol thing if there's no channel of Brotherly kindness the Holy Spirit can't sweep through and the Holy Spirit have to sweep through and when we were in Kwa 1981 the spirit spoke and said where is the honey where is the brotherly kindness the spirit want to seal the whole thing oh glory to God but where is the spirit of forgiveness oh give the Lord I shout in the house my my my do you get that tonight glory to God truth is not truth unless it's connected to the spirit of Truth a man giving information giving knowledge and all and that's that that's knowledge and information and word that's not the truth unless the spirit of Truth is behind that oh glory to God the spirit of truth the truth is a person the truth really is Jesus Christ so be behind the real truth there's a spirit of Truth bringing truth not just a man talking the top of your head oh give the Lord some Praises so in KYW the Holy Spirit spoke out 1981 where is the brotherly kindness where is the Honey Hallelujah where is that coin Hallelujah so now my God something struck me what going message men not mature that why the animosity and the divisiveness that is why continue and man open him mouth and saying the wrong thing and God hates that God hates Discord the Bible you know you to be the message to see that you know just read the scripture he hates it when God hates something God hate something in know I hate it he hate this cord and man throwing seeds where they get from the the AR store where they get seeds from these hateful seeds as talk about somebody to stab it to kill you they just have to say evil about the ministry and kill your influence and that's murder because you're no longer effective to the people like if a parent said talk against the ministry it killed the effect upon the children and they ruined the children ruin the family and then they want to know why why this happen in the house who is to blame read the poem again oh give the Lord some Praises who's the blame but T do that and the church do that and he say like me what kind of foolishness who's the blame I no friends who's the blame what did the prophet said how they get closer to the love of God how they get closer to God read your Bible and pray monthly pray yearly half no read your Bible and pray every day if if you do that it's something must happen inside your heart you think the devil want you to be repeating this thing when you let your faith run out to its end till you begin to believe then you let your subconscious go to acting then the faith of God will back it up cuse your faith won't do too much your subconscious has to move in the direction that your faith is moving and then God's faith moves in behind let's look at that woman with the daughter Vex with the devil she is not a Jew she come to the disciples and said I want to see the master my daughter devil help help help help help help she's going for help she walking be disciples them brothers trying to pmer off them know what laying hands they know what casting our Devils but this is different the daughter is not there they can't lay No Hands they can't speak no word this is a new realm for them together so they went to Jesus said Jesus just talk to that woman behind us there because she's talking she keep following us Jesus didn't even look at the woman he just said it's not fit to take the children's bread and cast it to dogs the woman heard that it was deliberate words it was words that was designed for her to hear to see how she'll react now Fai is what brought her there she wasn't going to come if she didn't have Faith because she believed Jesus could help her so Faith brought her there but a word came to question and challenge the faith that she had to bring her there and when that word came she stood her ground so now what subconscious have to move now should I move and go to Facebook and complain she I move and go on the phone and gossip and be a you know the word that forget Sunday tlin to and become a tlin to there there a from from England to go and tattle and and and gossip and talk about this man and this church people and this church folk she stood there and she she started said truth Lord she confirmed the word she confirmed the word what what was coming out of Christ's mouth she said truth Lord and because she said truth she see what the dog see all of a sudden she get dog Vision she had to see what the dog see she see the dog eating crumbs and she confessed it she said even the dogs that comes off the master's table Jesus couldn't handle that one oh Glory Jesus could even pray but but stepen Jesus could even pray he said for this saying oh give the Lord a shout this woman said the right thing and Heaven responded Hallelujah Heaven responded and and drop a bum and blow the devil off that daughter no hands laid on her Hallelujah no spoken word from the man of God that was there who was Jesus Christ she spoke the word oh give the Lord a shout she give a correct confession Give the Lord for this sin so you want to tell me you can't say the right thing you want to tell me you could just have to speak just God give you a chance to speak speak light in the presence of Darkness speak truth in the presence of error speak what is right speak what is amen that will bring glory to God and I glorify your flesh hallu but if it's your faith you say I got it right now and your subconscious is rolling back there saying I wonder if it work for me it w't do it right there he said we want this to be a real he healing service so that's why he was teaching these things all right question brother brandham I want to receive the Holy Ghost I want to know what to do I am burdened for my family to be saved and the sister sign her name and Bam speaks if if you want to receive the Holy Ghost let me tell you something my dear sister if you are here Neville is a member of the church here and he said at the bottom I know he said what the Bible said blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness you are so blessed to even want it now remember you have got it but bless it the day that that you not got it but blessed are hunger and thirst for it for they shall be filled just stay right with it what must I do for my family use the same fate that using for yourself for your family commit them to the Lord and believe with all your heart and you are going to be saved don't let it just come on your natural thinking Let It Drop way down on the inside that's the subconscious then they are yours do you see that he say praying for your family let it drop down to your subconscious then your family belongs to to you they're yours it's not at the conscious level it's at the subconscious level it's at the Heart level and you could pray till it gets there Hallelujah remember the the woman who was D of cancer and she got desperate you talk about one woman she be to cry out unto God when she recognized the devil the doctor tell her that she will die she got desperate she began to pray loud and and she press away and she was healed why she got desperate what happened there it dropped from the conscious to the subconscious you remember the man who was blind and came in the prayer line and he prayed for him and he come back again and he said but you healed you are healed but he said but people healed and and he was a Catholic he had nothing for his faith to hold on to and B I'm telling what go and say by his stripe I'm Healed now what is happening there he is consciously confessing by strip I'm heal by strip I'm heal and one one day in the baraba saloon that conscious dropped down to the subconscious and the healing was manifested do you get it now so by I'm heal is not saying that bring me healing you know is the crystallization of it dropping in the subconscious level that produces healing because he was healed by stripe I was healed oh praise the name of the Lord so watch something now he said watch use the same faith that you're using for yourself for your family commit them to the Lord and believe with all your heart that you're are going to be saved they're going to be saved don't let it just come to your natural thinking here let it drop down on the inside that subconscious than they're yours God give them to you when you got it down here wo that's a big one tonight whatever you have in your heart here and ask for it when you pray believe that you receive what you ask for now you can't doubt it no more you can't believe and doubt it at the same time how many knows that you can't believe and doubt at the same time so you got to believe what you asked for you receive it and he said it would be given to you you just believe for your family and they'll get it I think it was Luka or some terrible disease or something so the hospital they don't they only let priests somebody have no wife to go in and B went he didn't go inside he just said Lord Heal the person in Jesus name amen and the sister or the wife or somebody well Hallelujah Glory Glory Glory the doctor said but this is this is foolishness a man almost dead man disease and whatnot and you want he said Doctor you watching you watching at your instrument I watching at what God say the doctor is doing the right thing he watching his instrument the sister is doing the right thing she watching what God say the man was healed short prayer no no long prayer a half an hour prayer in Jesus name Hallelujah Glory Glory Glory no no long praying sometime long price sometime people working theel up you know you're working you're working when when they come to Jesus and said the daughter is sick somebody come and tell man hey don't with him daughter dead he said I go weaker first thing Jesus did get the unbelief out just get them people out who come for coffee case and who commit to Thief you know people commit interair with stuff when they have weak they always come to touch just get them out thieves included get your unbelievers out and she get some disciples in get some suppor in all them having to back up the fate and whatnot and talita arise give us something to eat end the story Oh My My My you can take some more let's go let's go they said to me why brother Bram the reason it doesn't because the life is gone out of you then which is the Healer the medicine or the Life Life Is A Healer then God is life life does the healing medicine doesn't build tissue medicine doesn't develop cells medicine only keeps clean while God develops cells grows and Men your arm heals up the cut place so medicine doesn't heal medicine is an assistant someone said to me long go then what about pneumonia if you got pneumonia the doctor give you penisin so what does penisin do I said if you had a house full of rats and they were eating holes to the plaster all over the floor rats and you put out rat poison and kill all the rats it might kill the rats but it won't patch the holes that they eat I said that's what penon is it kills the flu germs but it doesn't patch the cells that been tore down God has to do that so he is the only healer God is the Healer and then it's your faith in God and many people have faith subconsciously and doesn't know it so God do expect you to be hearing this and you're watching me like if I'm ET or something some kind of extraterrestrial you do you don't want to believe what what we saying do you get that because I share with you already but told a woman you have more faith than your think didn't you in other words you didn't expect that did you because her faith pop up she had more faith he could see it what what Peter the the man at the gate he said I perceive you are fa to be healed I'm feeling inspired tonight not a jump up sh service but but G Peter said I perceive you have faith to be healed rise up and walk in the name of Jesus Christ the the woman with the blood issue she told herself that told herself wasn't in her head in know because her husband tell her don't go to that small church thing don't go to that Jesus thing and she know the money run out paying doctors and the doctors can help nothing so she told herself that herself is subconscious subconscious level you know that is why the crowd Around Jesus didn't throw her off you know but you know some people like that you know when they see the crowd they tomorrow for me yes I will take the next service not tonight but she told herself if I could touch him of His Garment yes sir so her job was to get to this garment and the crowd was there to hinder her hardfaced men tall pareses welld designed clothes and whatnot men with big ring and all kind of stuff and staff and whatnot looking real religious and powerful men that you wouldn't want to go close by she had to BN them and press your way through and when she touched the Hem of Jesus G she knew she was healed and Jesus knew virtue left him a power left him something left him somebody made a withdrawal is only Faith could do that she wasn't baptized in Jesus name and she wasn't in the message oh give the Lord some Praises me started tonight oh glory to God but she had Faith where that Faith come from that wasn't an external fi that was a Faith from within Jesus confirmed it by saying thy faith had made thee whole Give the Lord some Praises tonight so don't tell me people don't have faith faith is subconscious and to prove it you know there are many times that we try to reach for something for a certain kind of a fate and you don't have to have some kind of super fate to be healed the only thing you have to have is just the faith that you got you know the Bible the blood was applied to the doors by his up our Cy Brothers know hup is common weed what is it the people today are trying to find an orchid to apply the blood with it's not even applied by an orchid it's applied by by his up common everyday Fai you don't have to have a super fate how did you come here how did you know you're going to leave how can you drive your car how do you know you can move your hand you just subconsciously do it because you believe you can do it and that's the reason you believe for your healing it's just settled and that's just all it doesn't take some higher education it doesn't take some super duper something it takes common faith in God and faith is common just like his up just common reads all over and brother Bram stretch here I had this inside of here about rock confession He said Each age has had his Rock confession and and up to this rock confession of the laia then he said you cannot make a holy church there's no such thing as a holy church the Holy Spirit can be preached in it but in there you find good and bad Renegade indifferent than everything else so an organization wasn't hold it and he's talking about Shepherd dream in which a man poured his water into this big rock box and it leaked right out run down the hill and then he came and poured his bucket of honey and it looked like it would break but it didn't break it looked like it wasn't to but the honey held so he was interpreting the dream and so like that he said this is he said this Tabernacle is not a holy ghost Tabernacle there's no such a thing as that individuals that come into this church is Holy Ghost Tabernacles they are Tabernacles that contain the Holy Ghost but not the church as a group but this man who was pouring the water The Messengers to the church pouring the message to the church what was the water doing it was boiling out the trash that was in it and that is what the Holy Spirit does now the honey here we go represented Brotherly Love brotherly kindness which is this age so this brotherly kindness has to come on display not just as a revelation but as a manifestation that God can see so when God told the prophet be careful what you see and the people come in church making love and carrying on what not and he begged him talking to them and God said whatever you say it would happen to them then he said I forgive you and then the Holy Spirit fell upon that to confirm that was God In Action forgiven them because he had failed he had sinned he had backslid and whatever it is and God forgive him he forgiv them not only that God take him when he was in the restaurant and condemning the woman and condemning all the place and with my daughter going to raise in this place and God put him aside show him his sins show him the blood bumper show him his put all his sins and see forgetfulness he said I forgive you and you condemn her what is God doing there he's teaching the prophet to how to go to the next level and to go to the next level you can't be self-righteous you can't be legalistic come on now you can't sit down on Moses seat to go into the next level you can't judge me skirt and pant woman and cut them off and say well they finished they're not in it you can't say that because the Bible said whosoever will will come oh give the Lord a shout you have to be in a position to say whosoever will you have to be in a position to say the spirit in the bright say come the blood that apply to you have to be for others the Forgiveness apply to you have to go to others the grace apply to you must go to others the love apply to you must go to others oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah and you have to shine the light just as the father shine light on the good and the bad and the just and the unjust Oh Glory to God how the rainfall your life must produce that oh give the Lord some Praises so God in wisdom put Bradly kindness at the top so when Jesus said when you stand praying forgive if you have order against say he was speaking about us he was speaking about this age and the only way we have to forgive is has to be backal people outside might understand that confusion and liars and tattling toies once you have that group they go say the wrong thing they would lie about you and God not testing them God testing you you see I show to like brother nther I show like brother Jones I sure like brother ID good Lord but God love him you in trouble I sh like brother Jones I don't like brother so and so something like that but you let something happen to him brother your heart is broke it's nearly kill you we can obtain brotherly kindness and feeding for one another but to me why do you care for that brother because he brought break with you he shook your hands he worship with him he might do something in the flesh that you would disagree with because you kind of say he what to do sh him but in the bottom of the heart something happened to that brother will kill you I'm an old man I was once young I'm old I've seen it down to the age I hear people say I just won't have no more to do with him that is rampant in the message where the coin is is in that they lost the coin alone they lost all all the coins they lost the basic of Christianity if you say you have no sin you lie but if you confess your sin you what I'm saying that then the blood of Jesus cleanses us amen cleanses us and we have Fellowship one with another so if we cannot have Fellowship one with another something wrong something wrong you can't be smoking that grass that the devil give you you're smoking a different you're getting a different kind of head when you when you're taken in the word and you smoke that and and that going up in your head and you cut off your brother and cut off this one that's a different kind of thing you know God gave that to smoke you that's a different kind of thing all together you need the perfume of the of the valley you need you need you get a different kind of herb oh blessed be the name of the Lord you need Jesus as Isa preach you need to see Jesus Oh Hallelujah is that Jesus coming back the one that forgives and loves and pardon and restores there going to be a restoration I will ride this Trail once more the Holy Ghost there'll be one more ride Hallelujah real Revival not no bogus Revival one of the products of Revival is fellowship ship among the churches I feel the anointing striking right now one of the effects of Revival is a restoration of backsliders one of the effect of Revival is a fire come back on the church itself all of that is part of Revival not you have it nobody else have it not you have it you not sharing it that's not what the Bible says when that woman found the coin look at me St tonight when she found that coin she went to her friends brother George she went to her neighbors and said come and rejoice with us for I found the coin that was lost oh when the church finds his brothery love when the church find his holy decy when the church finds his place in Christ it will call to the other members of the body come and rejoice with us we have found a coin oh give the Lord some Praises somebody going to find that coin some church going to find that coin somebody somewhere going to find that coin and you talk about shouting you talk about a rejoicing if we go back to Psalms 1118 the song of rejoicing is in the TAC of the right the Lord had chasen me sure but he had not given to me over unto death open unto me the G of righteousness Oh Glory to God the stone the bill refused has become The Headstone of the corner this is the Lord's doing it's marvelous in our eyes this is the day that the Lord hath made we will rejoice and be glad in it oh glory to God the song of rejoicing is in the tabernac of the righteous oh give the Lord some Praises feel good tonight hallelujah hallelujah huah the church have to come to brotherly kindness have to come to maturity words brotherly kindness Spirit of forgiveness identifies you are mature you holding your or and Grudge without make you a h and Grudge holder you a cup for HS and grudges devil say look a cup there fill it up fill it up then your aunt say something your sister say something your uncle say something your father say something he Boss Say Something neighbor say something and you just load up and they come to say oh I love Jesus and H love Jesus up here so conscious but your heart Grudge or my daughter my son my husband my wife because you're speaking at you see them disciples get a burden Lord if my brother sin against me how much times you forgive him some times today there a big number to them Jesus busted them he said 70 * 7 am he said that for the whole year that's a year that's a year number 7 and7 he said a day when you start praying forgive if you have word against any hallelujah praise the name of the Lord he said I won't have no more to do with him my brother something happened to that man and he kills him he said oh God I let my precious brother go without making friends with him you see is brotherly love it looks like it won't stick but it does the honey it sticks are waiting for them to get convicted why you do you ask God to convict you first are waiting for them to make it right because they're wrong why don't you take wrong and let that kill you because God want to kill you that's how you get the Holy Ghost go want to bust that self is that big self that why you have forgiveness that God just check the you know I can't check it I not inside your heart I can see inside your heart I'm not hard viewer you no app to view I put on the app view let me see but a punch heart let me see yeah it's blinking they do have that app you know mus they can't invent that app for the you know only the word is a deser you know of the TOs and intense of the heart you know they don't have the word to do to make that kind of but God have that kind of app that why Peter had it when an come but why you let devil fill your heart to lie to the Holy Ghost because Peter seen it plain PL PL you know he's saying straight through them he said why you let the devil make a lie to the Holy Ghost and out they go so therefore to the revelation that Jesus said Upon This Rock which is the rock confession of this message I believe his message I believe seven sees I believe seven Thunders but to that confession brotherly kindness have to be added to the confession of Revelation without brotherly kindness you have nowhere to go Peter himself denied Christ three times Christ had to come back and forgive them fellas because them G fishing all of a sudden the Revelation is fishing three and a half years no fishing preaching spreading the gospel the good news Jesus say G on for a few days and because them fellas hey fishing time and fellas back to square one you know back to what Jesus called them from he said I'll make you fishes of men then go back to fish no more men no more fishes of men back to fishing again and then they fishing all night B bar and caught nothing and Jesus still come with Mercy children have any meat say fish all night caught nothing he said can't on the right side the wrong side all the time any right side though when they cast in net they say help fish then they say the Lord yes when goost had to pour that blessing so when your cups had to run over so when your net start to break so oh give the Lord a shout I say he's the same yesterday today and forever your neck will break your cup will overflow oh give the Lord a shout in the house I believe that that's why I'm preaching yes so somehow ministers pastors they have to come to this honey they have to come to spiritual maturity they have to come to this open Vision where the Fate is right there that is based upon forgiveness not Mysteries not fate that come here on your word and your word and your word and your word yeah you pumped that for 40 years but where is the honey divisions are not caused by Honey division is caused by teaching and a man saying I am right because I teach this way I am right because that way and God don't care about what you think is right what he said is right he said the honey does stick let's challenge that let's accept that let's believe that because we will never see I on this Earth Somebody Like Coke somebody like Sprite somebody like big red so we can't see but what we could have is a heart for each other and for God so Jesus brought it very simply by this shall all men know that you are my disciples not by when a Spoke book on top of your head or saying that you're pressing and playing that is not what are going to that is not the disciples but that you could love one another and Jesus demonstrated it with feet washing Hallelujah as I did this to you I want you to do it it to one another Hallelujah to demonstrate that you understand how God interpret love Brotherhood Hal and fellowship Oh Glory to Lord Give the Lord some Praises tonight hallelujah hallelujah so this brotherly kindness is the only thing that open UPS the channel of Charity let me repeat that this brotherly kindness is the only thing that the Holy Spirit could rush them through but the true Spirit of forgiveness and this this forgiveness is what will bring that final sanctification for the bride that she could get that fire baptism of the Holy Ghost that is promised to take us from here all the way to the Rapture that final fire baptism is to to baptize the body to change the body the body to be baptized with the Holy Ghost and Fire a transformation praise God Amen Hallelujah praise God so so tonight the church not just this church but the bride the body bride body needs that healing of Brotherly kindness that healing of being Sanctified from the foolishness in this message by the spirit of Brotherly Love The Spirit of forgiveness oh praise the name of the Lord hallelujah what we are coming back to we're coming back to while Peter yet speak these words the Holy Ghost fell upon them that heard the word what happened to them they were just they were devout they were Sanctified they were given arms the man was free as a bird Hallelujah the man had the Liberty in other words the man conscious conscious was up in so much that God honored him God recognized his his his arms his given not meanness not selfish not greedy God recognized his behavior that God could say send for Peter because Peter in a channel that the Holy Ghost could use Peter had the germ that he could speak and Peter himself didn't know that God was going to break for upon the Gentiles Peter did not want to go God gave him a vision to go and Peter went in faith Oh Glory to God he went in faith because God gave him a vision Hallelujah and when he break out of the vision the men in front the door saying we come to see one Peter Simon Peter the tner Hallelujah Here Come Peter he's walking by faith now his new territory Hallelujah he didn't know what going to happen he just had to give a testimony about Jesus and while he is talking oh give the Lord a shout oh God I feel good tonight while he is speaking he don't know what going to unfold that night but while he is talking charity the Holy Ghost Dynamics the power dunamis that dropped down upon them and they were filled with the Holy Ghost and Peter confessed it's the same holy ghost that they receive these bers receive they may even baptized in water yet but they were filled with the Holy Ghost there was something right in their heart something right in their soul something right in their subconscious and God fill them with the Holy Ghost and that same God can fill you tonight oh give the Lord a shout in the house that same God is alive tonight to confirm and to vindicate his word oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so the revelation of the word but George is to leave to forgiveness the revelation of the word is to lead to forgiveness because this is not the Pentecostal age this is not 1906 this is Dynamics to the mechanics Hallelujah this is fire because the Holy Spirit Oh Glory to God this broadly kindness kills you because you have to take wrong you have to let things go this will kill you and when that kill you it a room open for the Holy Ghost to come and fill you oh give the Lord some Praises I'm going to close mus come up please Hallelujah where am I it this one blow me out what if everybody in this building at this time would get in the kind of attitude every person would be perfectly healed how do we get people that way some can receive it some cannot receive it but those who can receive it they look at it and accept it believe it others maybe in other meeting now that's one way of preaching by the word another way is to maybe speak with tongues and they give interpretation you talking about how people get in the atmosphere right then something happen to you now remember when God is making his Revelation or revealing himself to his people now that's the benefit of the meance that is what God give the gifts for was to Magnify Him and to unify the people to bring the body together to help us to unite our efforts and our prayers a person here we go sitting in a group of people like this where faith is gathered on every side it will help you to get well there'll be a people who listens at the word being taught that will never be in a prayer line yet they will get well for something happen subconsciously maybe they don't even realize what is about they will get well somebody sitting and watch one of the signs of the Lord appear and they will get well it is when Faith then he use these words anything that can stimulate Faith watch a man say yes I believe in healing I believe right I believe it's the word of God I believe it for the believer I believe that I've got faith to receive it but until you receive it you get what I mean then when you receive it you rejoice amen amen that's a sign that somebody receive this Revelation they Rejoice he said when you receive it you rejoice the word is India it is settled all doubt is dead all the husk is dropped off New Life have sprung up growing up into healing for yourself and when you really get your healing that is where healing comes from Faith come by hearing hearing of the word now there's the bum here now almost almost done faith is not healing Faith produces is healing by faith you are saved then he said this there's a loaf of bread that cost a quarter I believe it's about the price of it 25 cents now if you have faith watch now 25 cents is the purchasing price of the bread I've got 25 cents but haven't got the bread now you can have faith for healing and I believe many of you have but you can't receive healing until you purchase healing oh we getting warm tonight almost done by faith that you have you say brother Bram I wish I had the Holy Ghost I've got faith that I'll get it well then just swap your faith for the Holy Ghost that's all you have to do when you got that Faith nothing can take it away from you if you're just make believing if you're impersonating if you're putting on it won't work for you if it's real faith it is over God will do it right then you believe that you say yes but I believe in Divine Healing all right but then take that same Faith you got in Divine Healing and purchase your healing so he's showing you Faith must be applied oh give the Lord a shout in the house don't I Faith No no no faith must be applied begin to play somebody said we were talking about receiving the Holy Ghost course they're being raised up Ned in my young days of my Ministry in the Baptist Church and teaching that you receive the Holy Ghost when you believe according to the Baptist Church but according to the Bible you receive the Holy Ghost after you believe amen after you believe you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ accept him as your personal Savior and then receive the Holy Ghost until you receive the Holy Ghost God has never recognized your faith wow so tonight faith is based upon forgiveness do you have watch tonight why you you drop it let things go let the P be the past free yourself it will open up a Channel of feeling for you tonight let's all stand father God I pray that your presence would saturate the hearts and lives of the children right now may the anointing of God speak to them by Revelation and may the leave you with a faith and trust in
