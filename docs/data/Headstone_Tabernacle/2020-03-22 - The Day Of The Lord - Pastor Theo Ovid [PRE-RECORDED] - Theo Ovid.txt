see had a great time last week tonight exact message salvation Redemption adoption of perfection I was I was really something I was overseas and I was so blessed listen there I was they connected life and this week he'll be going to Ghana and I'll be going to Argentina so let's just use it right here believe him so we looking forward I mentioned that to you that you were pre for us so he is an Africa and South America god is good so this morning is a special morning a special thing every Sunday is a special this Sunday we should be coming under great expectation that God will meet the knees and Lord will give the ocean and give inspiration that you have an ear that you have any heart because you have to have that in your heart this is an odd thing I will share this morning and I know when I come back I have more on it but this is a thought that came to me I have a tip I'd like to put on I'll see what the Lord will do but we want to stand for the would know we want to go into the world bishop or the rudolf where's the lord good to see you amen you you good happy to be here this morning all right so don't miss any service no and but a Steven gave a tremendous exhortation and on Friday a tremendous receiving after stitch those things together and give us a message a whole message okay so we want to look at footsteps Lunas up to five wanna read verse one to seven want to look at Isaiah chapter two 11 to 12 and we want to look at Isaiah 13 six take them now many times I can't even explain how I get messages how things come but they come and I have to speak what God put put my heart so let's go to first gesture in chapter 5 we have of this one but of the times and the seasons brethren you have no need that I write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child they shall not escape but ye brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief ye are all children of the day and we are not of the night nor of darkness therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober for data at sleep sleep in the night did I be talking a drunken in the night I'm a good Isaiah chapter 2 verse 11 God speaks the lofty looks of man shall be humbled and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed on and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day for the day of the Lord of Hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty and upon everyone that is lifted up and he shall be brought low Isaiah chapter 13 we're in verse 6 wholly for the day of the Lord is at hand it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty therefore shall all hands be faint and every man's heart shall melt and he shall be afraid pangs and soul shall take a whole of them they shall be in pain as a woman that travail it they shall be Amin is one at another the official shall be as flames oh praise the Lord let's continue 6011 behold the day of the Lord cometh crewel boot rat and fierce anger to lay the land desolate he shall destroy the sinners their own out of it for the stars of heaven and the consolation thereof shall not give their light the Sun shall be darkened in the going forth and the moon shall not cause a light to shine and I will punish the world for the evil and the wicked for their iniquity and i will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease and I will lower the haughtiness of the terrible let us borrow his heavenly father we read your word and Lord is just such an interjection at this point in time how this message came and what you gave me to say to the people Lord may you inspire take me out of the way and Lord I only speak what you want me to speak in Jesus name I ask it Amen I mean when you may be seated or praise the Lord amen praise God hallelujah glory to God I will contact Scripture provision 612 and I beheld and yet opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the Sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood title this morning is the day of the Lord as the title is one the day of the Lord I feel is the message the warning and God always send warning before judgment but before he sends a warning he always made a provision for you to escape whatever is coming because something is fixing to break for something is fixed in the seat please how can God give power question how can God give more than someone who doesn't know him looking for power but how could God gives someone power who doesn't know him who doesn't have a relationship with him who is not even close to him you know you could go and ask your father for something or your uncle for something but if you have some distance somebody you even talk to them or how you gonna ask them for this waxing for that or expect me to give you this nice time to give you that when you have a relationship with them it's easy to ask easy for them to give it to you because you're a relationship with them and they either forgot to give you the size of your heart because your relationship with him so how can God give you power when you don't know him when you're not interested in knowing him and the know him is not as though not in Lord you could only know him by his word you couldn't know him how we reveal how he could be contacted how he could all you could relate and commune with him if you don't go by the word then you're going by the God of the imagination of your own heart and mind the queen by the color of your own thoughts what you think he is what you feel E is was a good God all the time and all the milk at phases and so on you going back that but God is not that God is what we just read here tonight I will punish the sinners I will punish the world for the evil I will do that or glory to God hallelujah praise God I will share me with wife this one in the scripture when God was telling them that when I bring you all to Egypt I would bring it to a land a new land a different land or glory that got different from what you know in Egypt hallelujah prior to do so water the grass water the grounds and Egypt my mother taught water he said by water water in a labor and he said but do what the lamb I'm gonna bring you up mountains and valleys he said amble to say you're in that kind of will what you're doing I go to salary you'll ever come and draw with thing I'm big eyes have a trench and bring water flew in don't to weather the plants and so on I go send you in in your season I want to bless you and if you listen to me I'll bless you more I'll multiply what your have I will add to what your have but if you're told follow what I'm saying I'm gonna shut the heavens I will shut off friends from you and the locusts will come and take you and the Primeau will come after that I will send them MOU because I bring you to this land to bless you Oh glory to God hallelujah I want to bless you this morning or do you believe that believe that what I'm gonna send rain upon your life this morning all glory of God amen so watch and the Holy Spirit always speaks the word I've got amazing to tell you he cannot understand it now but when he comes he will guide you to it that's the reason the coming of the seals at the finishing of the seventh seal the mystery of God shall be finished to know who God is what he is how he lives his nature his being you're supposed to be all the way up there by that time to bring us into the full study of sons and daughters of God so it means that this climax age

knowledge and then God speaks behold in the day of your fast you find pleasure exact all your labors behold your fast for strife and debate and to smite with the fist of wickedness you shall not fast as you do this day to make your voice to be denied in other words there's a fasting that makes your voice to be who deny I call fast an amplified prayer as well pray have volume on it oh let's continue it is such a fast that I have chosen a different afflicted soul is it the bottom is head as a blur to spread sackcloth and ashes under you we don't call this a fast unacceptable later the Lord is not this the fast that I have chosen what for to lose the bands of wickedness to undo the heavy burdens to let the oppressed go free and to break every yoke is it not to deal I rented the hungry that don't bring the poor that are cast all to thy house when those here's the naked that don't cover him and on a high not thyself on my own flesh then shall thy light break forth as the morning then he'll shall spring forth speedily the health and thy righteousness shall go before thee the glory of the Lord shall be your rear award then thou shalt call and the Lord shall answer though shalt cry and he shall say Here I am if thou will take away from the midst of thee though you can put it for the finger and speaking vanity if thou draw thy soul to the hungry and satisfy the afflicted then that child I light rise in obscurity my darkness appears the lonely and the Lord shall Kinkaid he continually and satisfy thy soul and drought and make fact I bones and thou shall be like a watered garden like the spring of water whose waters feel not until I shall be of thee shall build always places though shall raise up the foundations of many generations and thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach to restorer of paths to dwell in we have a great ministry ahead a great call in the head but it's a cost that goes with it I'm almost done Ezekiel 33 reading from verse 1 again the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man speak to the share of Israel and send to them when i bring the sword upon a land if the people of the land take a man of their coasts and set him for their Watchmen well he see the sword come upon the land he blow the trumpet and warn the people then whosoever here at the strong of the trumpet not warning if the sort come and take him away his blood shall be upon his own head he heard this song of the trumpet took not warning his blood shall be upon him but he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul but if the watchman see the sword come and blown up the trumpet and the people be not warned if the sword come and take any person from among them he is taken away in his iniquity but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand oh so this give a different perspective now of this trumpet to be blow if the watchman don't know the trumpet and things happen God require at the watchman's hand the man so son of man so now verse 7 so so daro Solomon I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel therefore thou shalt hear over at my mouth and warn them from me when I say unto the wicked a wicked man don't shall surely die if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way that wicked man shall die in his iniquity but his blood will I require at thine hand nevertheless if the warn the wicked of his way to turn from it and he turn not from his way he shall die in iniquity but that was delivered I saw therefore thou son a man speak under the house of Israel does he speak sin if our transgression of all still be upon us and we finally holy shall we live say unto them as I live saith the Lord I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked but are the wicked till from his way and live tell me from your evil ways why will you die Oh hopes of Israel so if you see from these scriptures whatever burden for people to really repent because he wants to forgive he wants to restore he wants to heal he wants to bless do you believe that Isaiah 21 11 12 the building of Duma he call it at me or the shear watchman what are the night watchman one of the night the watchman said the morning coming and also the night if he/she will inquire inquiry return come on in brother branham preach a message watch my one a night he says and there is talking about as soon as we get washed up and groomed up talk but people this traumatising we will meet at the tavern as usual and I'm sure John you are you all this to buy body message be here today watch my mother tower trying to make a tick to joy or door life gonna tell us there's a push in danger because he was finally tower he seen something and these people want the party they want to drink and whatnot so he talking about people who talking about it with this watchman want to take away the joy from us he said know what and you know we have the best happy days I'm in our soldiers meet each night same place we enjoy fellowship together gambling a few drinks as for myself he said I would refuse to be alarmed about any of this stuff that this watchman would talk about all rabbis know about this or pastors and so on we believe that there will be a possible chance to Watchmen could be right or this warning thing and warning thing you know we don't have to take that so seriously do you know this this is Birdman on you know there's something about danger there's something about debt that seems to have a forewarning of it many times that loved ones before passed on across the other side a warning comes to them hallelujah Watchmen must be on duty at all times he was to warn the people of approaching dangers that was his duty to watch for Butch and Dena danger he was up in a tower I was built much higher than the walls and this tower had to be up there in it the books of astronomy and so forth he couldn't watch the stars until the time any approaching time of the day he could tell it then he was you could see further than anyone on the ground he could see further he was up higher actually before they build the city walls they build a tower that's the first thing that bill was he tall first thing so they kept pistol on the bella tower a reporter was one of there and he watchin and even fighting and they watchin lien bricks the wall they built the kid then decidable hoses they fortify but at watch man you had to put him up there because he had to scan the horizon cuz I always some demons some spirit some i'ts look in the sea they could come and take back get back get back revenge about all these that's just the nature of life and the Holy Spirit is that much man who is making ready the people and given warnings to God hallelujah that Watchmen have to be trained you have to know what he was doing for at any distance as soon as he arose the enemy could detect it he could tell their walk he could tell their match he could tell their color he could tell that rank-and-file that's as far um I could see could see it he was higher than the rest of them he was trained to know the enemy and God required the whole city as it had oh my position from a place oh praise God I'm closing I know you like read a lot of scriptures tonight but this is what I got fishy about you tonight know what trumpet shake yourself hallelujah 2nd Peter 3:9 the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness

touched that Boone would fire no under blackness and darkness and Tempest and the soul of a trumpet and the voice of words which voice be heard entreated that the word should not be spoken to them

things another leader see that they refused on him that speaketh for if they escaped not to refuse him and speak on it how much more shall be not escape if we turn away from it must be from heaven
