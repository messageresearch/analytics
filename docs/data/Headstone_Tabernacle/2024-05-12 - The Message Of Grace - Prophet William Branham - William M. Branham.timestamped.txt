[48:15] and my spirit is in the midst of you
[48:17] even now look unto me the true and
[48:20] living God because I am standing in the
[48:23] midst this morning I am rejoicing with
[48:25] you in my spirit and I will lift you
[48:28] this morning by my strong right hand in
[48:31] the place where you can represent and
[48:33] walk beside me in Heavenly places
[48:36] because my desire this morning is unto
[48:39] you that your hearts might be lifted up
[48:41] that you might Rejoice with me in spirit
[48:44] and gain it it is gain this Mighty
[48:48] knowledge and this spiritual wisdom and
[48:52] the understanding that you are going to
[48:56] need need when the time comes so this
[49:01] wasn't for the group that was listening
[49:03] hearing that then this is for this group
[49:06] here amen let me read it again that you
[49:08] might Rejoice with me in spirit and gain
[49:12] this Mighty knowledge and the spiritual
[49:14] wisdom and the understanding that you
[49:17] are going to need when the time comes
[49:21] and the persecution that is going to
[49:23] come just before I Rapture my bride
[49:27] so if the people in this message think
[49:29] that because of the pressure I want to
[49:31] go I want to go home all glory that's
[49:33] not what we saying that's not what is
[49:35] taught there's a process and this what
[49:37] people don't want to identify there's a
[49:39] process and that is why I feel that this
[49:41] is very weighted this morning to share
[49:43] this with you listen to these words next
[49:46] you will not endure my wrath my
[49:50] children God rra is different you know
[49:52] this is persecution they not the rra of
[49:54] God that's something different you will
[49:56] not endure my wrath my children let me
[49:58] interject this
[50:00] here part of God's nature and we read
[50:03] that sometime back that God doesn't
[50:05] judge a man before was warning him
[50:07] that's just how he is before somebody
[50:10] gets taken off the Earth God warns them
[50:12] that's course's nature part of God's
[50:14] nature is that he's longsuffering the
[50:17] Bible talk about the longsuffering and
[50:18] it is a Noah so God is very patient you
[50:21] know we get impatient we get vexed we
[50:22] write off somebody we finish with them
[50:24] we done God is not like that because he
[50:27] have no rejoicing in the death of a
[50:28] sinner what he wants people to is to
[50:30] come to repentance he has no desire for
[50:33] people to a sin you know he want them to
[50:35] come to repentance so he has a burden
[50:37] and he has this long suffering that he
[50:39] bear long with people foolishness and
[50:42] nonsense and everything else until he
[50:44] says the cup of the iniquity is not even
[50:46] full so so when people cup of iniquity
[50:49] is being filled up he is H hoping that
[50:51] they come to repentance if they come to
[50:53] repentance it emptied out but when it
[50:54] come full he had to deal with that now
[50:56] because the cup is full I have to deal
[50:58] with all that behavior now because the
[51:00] cup is not full are you understand what
[51:01] I'm saying then so he says here now you
[51:03] will not Endo my wrath my children but
[51:06] persecution will come upon you and beset
[51:09] you on many SIDS you will be tried you
[51:12] will lift up your hands and raise your
[51:14] voices on my behalf and testify when the
[51:17] going gets hard I will come down and
[51:19] witness through you I will ward off of
[51:23] you the evil devices of the wicked one
[51:26] because I have spoken to you by my
[51:28] spirit and if you would listen to my
[51:31] voice that I am bringing to you this
[51:33] morning you will have no cause to regret
[51:35] it thus sayeth my spirit could we praise
[51:39] the Lord this
[51:40] morning amen and amen okay just two
[51:44] little captions and we go straight into
[51:45] the tape God can take the vest Sinner
[51:50] and make him white as
[51:52] snow and don't have to ask anybody about
[51:55] it because he is
[51:58] Sovereign did you get that the violent
[52:00] sinner the worst condition you can think
[52:02] about God could take that and correct
[52:04] that and don't have to appe peep to
[52:06] nobody that's the God we serve why he is
[52:10] Sovereign so God could sovereignly heal
[52:12] you this morning sovereignly deliver you
[52:14] this morning sovereignly free you this
[52:15] morning sovereignly baptize you this
[52:17] morning sovereignly bless you this
[52:19] morning whatever it is he could do it
[52:21] for you this morning without asking
[52:24] anybody permission or any sister or or
[52:26] any brother if he could or should bless
[52:29] you oh give the Lord some Praises this
[52:35] morning think of it love and grace is
[52:39] Twin Sisters twin sisters you can't have
[52:41] Grace without having love de twin
[52:44] sisters before you can have Grace you
[52:46] have to have love before you can
[52:49] actually show somebody a favor you love
[52:51] them right or wrong you have to love
[52:53] them anyhow so love and grace is the
[52:55] same thing they are sisters love and
[52:57] grace we can't see one without the other
[53:00] so God so Lov the world he gave his only
[53:02] begotten son he shed Grace abroad into
[53:04] our hearts through the Holy Ghost there
[53:06] is just nothing you can do without
[53:07] working one with another grace of God is
[53:10] what saves us and then he read the
[53:13] scripture and you're going to hear it
[53:14] about the two olive trees and and what
[53:17] are these know my Lord and he said not
[53:19] by might nor my PA but my spirit there's
[53:21] the next prophecy here from the word he
[53:23] says okay now we read further that zerbu
[53:26] zerel has laid the foundation with his
[53:28] hands he shall also bring forth The
[53:30] Headstone I want you to notice he never
[53:33] said he shall bring forth the
[53:34] Cornerstone he shall bring forth The
[53:37] Headstone that's what we're looking for
[53:38] right now The Headstone to cap the pray
[53:40] in our lives The Headstone to anoint and
[53:43] empower the church just as the Beast
[53:45] have a image and the image will come to
[53:48] life the bride have a image look at
[53:50] right there that image there will come
[53:51] to life that image is his statue of
[53:53] perfect man before the Beast come into
[53:55] action the the Beast have to be
[53:57] empowered and before you come to action
[53:59] you have to be empowered do you
[54:02] understand this thing is real there's
[54:03] not fancy and fairy tale this is the
[54:06] word This Can't Fail God can't lie the
[54:08] prophecies will come to
[54:11] pass all right here we go he shall bring
[54:14] forth The Headstone and we know the
[54:16] scripture say that Jesus is the Chief
[54:17] Cornerstone he is also the headstone now
[54:19] if you will think for a few minutes this
[54:22] is but Brom now he's drilling down that
[54:25] the seven Church his messenger was to
[54:28] restore the faith of the children back
[54:31] to the fathers am and then he explains
[54:34] it in other
[54:35] words rebuild the church again under the
[54:40] power of the spirit so the church was
[54:43] built by word word word word word but he
[54:46] promised Hallelujah do you see it now
[54:48] there's a prophecy here now he promised
[54:51] that the church will be rebuilt under
[54:55] the power of the spirit amen not by
[54:58] might not by power but by my spirit
[55:01] sayth the Lord not by organization not
[55:04] by denomination but by the Holy Spirit
[55:07] God will bring forth the church in the
[55:10] last days so God will speak by this
[55:13] message it's a powerful
[55:15] message uh uh uh hold on to every word
[55:18] but Shan just go straight into it now oh
[55:20] by the grace of God the message is the
[55:21] message of Grace God bless you
[55:41] thank you brother NE Lord bless you good
[55:44] morning friends certainly a privilege to
[55:46] be here again this morning in the
[55:48] service of the Lord and just sorry that
[55:52] we don't have any room to place the
[55:55] people in the little Church it doesn't
[55:57] hold very much but we are very glad that
[56:00] you're here and willing to make
[56:02] sacrifice to to be patiently to wait on
[56:07] us and we'll do our very best to bring
[56:09] you the word of the Lord the best that
[56:11] we know how to bring it and now I just
[56:14] this little lady just walking in and she
[56:16] had a baby to be dedicated this morning
[56:18] and then she seemed that it was kind of
[56:21] running late and she said she'd just
[56:22] wait I never seen the woman before but I
[56:25] pray that God will bless her and give
[56:27] her the riches of His blessings in her
[56:30] heart because of her being patiently to
[56:34] wait now it's
[56:37] coming time of the year want to get
[56:40] cooler and it won't be so hot when we're
[56:42] jammed up in the
[56:45] church and we are trusting that God will
[56:48] richly bless all of
[56:51] you
[56:53] now I would like to say just the a few
[56:56] things here just before I
[56:59] speak I had given out that I was going
[57:02] to speak this morning at the Lord
[57:05] willing on the subject of the winds in
[57:09] the Whirl wind but he just changed it
[57:12] for me I never know what I'm going to
[57:15] say until uh just maybe a few minutes
[57:18] before coming to the
[57:20] meeting and I've tried the second time
[57:22] now on that subject and I failed to get
[57:26] the answer back from God I don't know
[57:28] why I always like as all you ministers
[57:31] here know that you have to wait on the
[57:34] Lord for what you're going to
[57:36] say last evening on the private line I
[57:40] had a a call come all the way from down
[57:44] somewhere in Arkansas some people wanted
[57:46] to move up here this next week said they
[57:48] heard we was going to start a meeting on
[57:51] the Seven Seals I just got through the
[57:53] seven Church ages to The Strangers and
[57:57] her husband is coming Monday to get him
[57:59] a job in Louisville so he could work
[58:01] while they stayed close enough to hear
[58:03] those Seven Seals I said that take about
[58:06] 3 months lately we don't have any place
[58:08] here to advertise a meeting and so forth
[58:11] nothing take care of it you're in the
[58:13] city nothing for to seat the
[58:16] people I'd like to sometime maybe if God
[58:19] being willing to uh have that out in the
[58:23] campaign somewhere set up about a 3
[58:24] months meeting and just start right
[58:26] through those seals like that out in the
[58:28] campaign and people could just stay
[58:30] right through it and here it runs from
[58:33] the sixth chapter of Revelations through
[58:35] the 19th so you get the Seven Seals the
[58:38] seven plages the three walls the woman
[58:41] setting on the Scarlet cover Beast
[58:43] 144,000 oh there's just so much of it
[58:45] goes in to tie those before the seventh
[58:48] um seal is
[58:51] given seventh plague Falls seventh
[58:54] trumpet sounds and there so many of
[58:56] those things that all tie that together
[58:59] and each one of them is a great day
[59:02] lesson in
[59:04] itself now let us bow our heads just a
[59:07] moment for a word of
[59:08] [Music]
[59:09] [Applause]
[59:11] prayer before we pray would there be
[59:14] some in here would like to be remembered
[59:16] in this prayer and you would make known
[59:18] by raising up your hands and in your
[59:20] heart thank to God just what you have
[59:22] need of now I pray that he will give it
[59:25] to you

[59:37] father that knows all his children has
[59:41] need

[1:00:37] heart everything that the people could
[1:00:39] imagine in their minds you could tell
[1:00:41] them right back what they were thinking
[1:00:45] about why reason ye in your heart of
[1:00:48] these
[1:00:49] things Jesus perceived their
[1:00:52] thoughts and we read in the scripture
[1:00:55] that thou art the same yesterday today
[1:00:58] and
[1:01:00] forever and it is also written that
[1:01:02] wherever two or three are assembl

[1:01:52] Lord that would bring your presence so
[1:01:55] close to the people that they would know
[1:01:58] that that same Jesus that walked in
[1:02:00] Galilee stands in the midst of his
[1:02:02] people
[1:02:03] amen they might go away from here today
[1:02:07] with the same assurance that those who

[1:02:15] after walking with him all day
[1:02:17] long talking to him and him talking to

[1:02:30] that you speak to us in the setting of
[1:02:34] the
[1:02:34] Sun in the singing of the
[1:02:38] birds in the rustling of the leaves in
[1:02:41] the blooming of the flowers in the hymns

[1:07:10] should be engraved upon this that it
[1:07:12] might go to All
[1:07:16] Peoples God's holy spirit has strange
[1:07:20] ways of dealing with his
[1:07:22] people many times Sue wonders and
[1:07:25] through gifts and callings which are
[1:07:28] without repentance that God gives them
[1:07:30] to his
[1:07:31] people by his
[1:07:35] grace
[1:07:36] I'm home now kind of a little vacation
[1:07:40] like I usually take this time at home
[1:07:44] for along this time of year C I like to
[1:07:48] relax when I go squirrel
[1:07:51] hunting now I've been down in Kentucky
[1:07:53] with my friends this week
[1:07:56] squirrel
[1:07:57] hunting my favorite
[1:07:59] spot
[1:08:01] somehow I was
[1:08:05] discouraged not exactly because I could
[1:08:07] find no squirrels but I just felt
[1:08:11] discouraged something was telling me I
[1:08:13] must return
[1:08:15] home and I slept in the car coming
[1:08:19] back last year as all of you know which
[1:08:22] is on print and also in testimon into
[1:08:26] tapes I was sitting at a place here in
[1:08:29] Indiana where the Lord God came down and
[1:08:32] spoke to me that my second Ministry that
[1:08:35] was ready to take place in the near
[1:08:38] future and there was spoken into
[1:08:41] existence Three Squirrels all of you
[1:08:43] know the story I'm
[1:08:45] sure somehow going up the road I while I
[1:08:48] let the rest of the boys off goinging
[1:08:50] Hunting I I had a strange feeling to go
[1:08:53] to this place again it was before
[1:08:56] daylight
[1:08:57] raining I didn't even know whether they
[1:08:59] get to hunt or not but that I would get
[1:09:03] over in the field there hunting means to
[1:09:06] get along to yourself to
[1:09:10] pray and I stopped the car and got off
[1:09:14] and walked across the road and went over
[1:09:17] into the bush and just before it would
[1:09:20] have been daylight it's kind of gray
[1:09:23] Dawn I'd stopped and it all for a little
[1:09:25] word of prayer as usual in telling
[1:09:27] father that just what I have need of to
[1:09:30] provide it I don't believe in wasting
[1:09:33] anything or destroying never shot a bird
[1:09:36] in my life for a target practice or
[1:09:38] anything else what I hunt I eat or give
[1:09:41] to someone that does eat
[1:09:43] it I don't believe in wasting anything I
[1:09:47] don't believe in doing those things
[1:09:48] because it's not
[1:09:51] right then as I turned and started along
[1:09:55] a familiar little pathway by the side of
[1:09:57] a pastor that crossed over to an L shape
[1:10:00] in the woods
[1:10:01] that something strange took
[1:10:05] place all my experiences I've never had
[1:10:09] anything like
[1:10:10] that I looked at the top of the hill to
[1:10:14] my left from where I was standing and
[1:10:17] they're coming up out of a like the top
[1:10:20] of the hill came three
[1:10:23] rainbows and they were running some 30t
[1:10:27] high first I looked and seen the light
[1:10:30] and I just turned back because I thought
[1:10:32] it might be the sun
[1:10:35] raising on the second thought it wasn't
[1:10:38] towards the sun it was towards the South
[1:10:40] and another thing it was smooth cloudy
[1:10:42] rain raining all over that was August
[1:10:45] the 25th last Friday morning and you
[1:10:48] know how it was
[1:10:50] raining and it's smooth clouds
[1:10:53] everywhere and I looked again and there
[1:10:56] it was growing taller and taller three
[1:10:59] rainbows I took off my
[1:11:02] hat I sat down my
[1:11:05] gun I started walking towards it with my
[1:11:08] hands
[1:11:10] up something you seemed to tell me this
[1:11:12] is close
[1:11:14] enough I was going to sit down and take
[1:11:16] off my boots that I had on to see if I
[1:11:19] could walk a little closer but I got
[1:11:22] within a few yards of it and I seen the
[1:11:25] color of it missing like a
[1:11:28] fog moving
[1:11:31] around I Stood Still for a few moments
[1:11:34] is coming right out of the top of the
[1:11:35] little
[1:11:37] mountain and I watched as the three one
[1:11:40] to the right one to the left and one in
[1:11:42] the center running down into one bowl
[1:11:46] L every what it was was
[1:11:48] alive it was moving and making its
[1:11:51] motions and I stood there just as it was
[1:11:54] graying Dawn
[1:11:56] I turned and looked again and I screamed
[1:11:58] out oh
[1:11:59] God what would you have your servant
[1:12:02] know just then the spirit of the Lord
[1:12:06] came
[1:12:06] in and said Jesus of the New Testament
[1:12:10] is Jehovah of the
[1:12:13] old he only changed his mask from Spirit
[1:12:17] to
[1:12:19] man that was confirming of course my
[1:12:23] message of him amen letting me know
[1:12:27] assured that these 31 years hasn't been
[1:12:30] in
[1:12:31] vain as I started to approach it began
[1:12:34] to go away went down into this bow like
[1:12:36] Affair and then
[1:12:38] disappeared I walked up close I was
[1:12:40] afraid to go any closer because he'd
[1:12:43] stopped me before I got
[1:12:45] there I turned to notice that that light
[1:12:48] the way it was shining for me was just
[1:12:51] exactly in line with the tree where I
[1:12:53] set last year where the squirrels
[1:12:56] appeared some 35 or 40 minutes later I
[1:13:00] went down through the woods and over the
[1:13:03] creek bottoms and so forth till I got to
[1:13:05] this tree that separates in four
[1:13:08] directions east north west and south
[1:13:10] four prongs of the tree running out and
[1:13:12] I climb into this prong and sit down
[1:13:15] where I was when he told me of that
[1:13:16] scripture if you say to this mountain be
[1:13:20] moved Hallelujah and as I stood there a
[1:13:23] little bit not thinking yet of the
[1:13:25] rainbow it had left my mind I stood
[1:13:29] there and this has been a very bad year
[1:13:31] for squirrel hunting uh everything is
[1:13:34] late no
[1:13:36] squirrels I thought right here is where
[1:13:39] God gave
[1:13:40] me them squirrels last year to speaking
[1:13:43] to
[1:13:44] existence I took off my hat
[1:13:48] again and I said Lord
[1:13:51] God you are still the same Jesus
[1:13:56] you are still
[1:13:59] God and something said to me how many do
[1:14:03] you need this
[1:14:05] time I said just as I did the other time
[1:14:08] the
[1:14:11] limit and then I said I shall have this
[1:14:14] limit before 10:00
[1:14:17] today and strange as it seems just then
[1:14:20] I was in a very
[1:14:23] bad mosquito area where it was invested
[1:14:26] with mosquitoes and kind of a swamp land
[1:14:29] the great big mosquito came to bite me
[1:14:32] right by the eye and I said not one of
[1:14:35] them will bother me this day no
[1:14:37] repellent or anything with
[1:14:39] me and before I knew it I said the sun
[1:14:42] will shine within 30
[1:14:45] minutes and no more than i' said that
[1:14:47] till just behind
[1:14:50] me a squirrel exactly like that in last
[1:14:53] year Young Red jumped out on the limb
[1:14:55] about 70 yard away and began
[1:14:59] barking I turned around at those long
[1:15:02] distance I could barely through the
[1:15:04] powerful scope see his eye just shocked
[1:15:08] that's all I didn't even have aim at no
[1:15:10] more than over the squirrel and the
[1:15:12] bullet would just exactly smack with the
[1:15:14] eye where it was the other
[1:15:16] time on down through the woods I went
[1:15:19] and it
[1:15:20] exactly 3
[1:15:23] minutes of 10:00
[1:15:25] I shot my third squirrel just like it
[1:15:27] was last year just exactly the same at 3
[1:15:30] minutes before 10 amen God being my
[1:15:35] solemn judge not one mosquito even Buzz
[1:15:38] all day long right where they just tons
[1:15:41] of them I suppose that they could be
[1:15:42] weighed out and I never even seen or
[1:15:45] heard one I was listening for them to
[1:15:48] see if I could and I heard a huming I
[1:15:50] thought there's one somewhere and I
[1:15:52] listened and it was a truck way back on
[1:15:53] the highway
[1:15:56] and exactly 30 minutes from that time
[1:15:58] the sun Shone out good and bright
[1:16:01] amen and I came back to the
[1:16:05] place and I've been thinking when I said
[1:16:08] limit that meant five squirrels which is
[1:16:11] the limit in
[1:16:12] Indiana but I remember last year when he
[1:16:15] asked me how many did it take for me a
[1:16:16] mess I said three and I just got the
[1:16:20] three so yesterday I went back was going
[1:16:23] to the same place again and something
[1:16:24] something said do not go across the
[1:16:27] road and at
[1:16:29] exactly 10:00 on the exact dot 10:00
[1:16:34] with my watch I shot the Indiana limit
[1:16:37] the fifth squirrel
[1:16:39] amen I want you to notice there was
[1:16:42] three
[1:16:44] rainbows and there was three things said
[1:16:48] Three Squirrels
[1:16:50] gotten there was three things Three
[1:16:52] Squirrels by 10:00 no mosquitoes the sun
[1:16:56] would shine in 30
[1:16:58] minutes and
[1:17:00] U there were three to give witness of it
[1:17:04] brother Banks Woods my son Billy
[1:17:07] Paul and his son David to give witness
[1:17:11] to it when I seen them
[1:17:15] rainbows about as wide across as that
[1:17:18] Halo is that angel of the Lord but there
[1:17:21] were three of them running into one
[1:17:25] oh how it helped my
[1:17:29] heart to know that
[1:17:33] God Jesus is not just a
[1:17:36] man as people think he
[1:17:40] is just the prophet as this modern idea
[1:17:44] today thinks that Jesus is just a
[1:17:47] prophet he's Jehovah of the Old
[1:17:51] Testament made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[1:17:55] Hallelujah there that sure did comfort
[1:17:59] me then thinking on that subject that
[1:18:03] God had s so many people now there is a
[1:18:06] group of people call themselves The
[1:18:08] Oneness or the Jesus only I don't agree
[1:18:12] with them upon their
[1:18:13] Theory neither do I agree with that
[1:18:16] trinitarian group that says that there
[1:18:19] are three different gods the extreme of
[1:18:21] the
[1:18:22] trinitarian but I believe that the three
[1:18:26] Father Son and Holy Ghost is one amen
[1:18:29] that they are three offices of one God
[1:18:31] he lived in the fatherhood in the pillar
[1:18:34] of fire he lived in the sunship in Jesus
[1:18:37] Christ and he lives now in the Holy
[1:18:39] Ghost in his church the same Lord Jesus
[1:18:44] that was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[1:18:46] is with us this day amen Among Us in the
[1:18:49] form of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah of
[1:18:53] all the experience
[1:18:55] when I turned first and seen thinking
[1:18:58] first it could be the sun peep through a
[1:19:01] cloud somewhere but it was before the
[1:19:03] suntime then when I turned back again
[1:19:05] and seen it wasn't a light it was
[1:19:08] rainbows and then when I looked and seen
[1:19:11] that I become numb all over just someone
[1:19:15] said to me did not you feel like
[1:19:17] shouting no I didn't feel like shouting
[1:19:21] those experiences never make you feel
[1:19:23] like shouting they just make you feel
[1:19:26] anchored just where that you know that
[1:19:30] there's something that tells
[1:19:33] you just a satisfied feeling now those
[1:19:36] things are truth I know we have things
[1:19:40] that said that many times some people
[1:19:42] say I don't believe in such stuff as
[1:19:44] that I can't voucher for that I don't
[1:19:45] know I can only voucher for what I know
[1:19:48] to be the truth and God Almighty who
[1:19:52] wrote this Bible and I his servant he
[1:19:56] knows that that is the
[1:19:58] truth think of it that the day that we
[1:20:01] are living
[1:20:02] in just before the coming of the Lord
[1:20:06] Jesus said there will be signs in the
[1:20:09] skies and in the
[1:20:11] earth great sights flying saucers
[1:20:15] missiles perplex of time distress
[1:20:17] between the
[1:20:19] Nations and fearful sights upon the
[1:20:22] Earth and we're living in that day to
[1:20:24] see those things now for the message
[1:20:29] this morning that I have chosen I want
[1:20:31] you to turn with me in the scriptures
[1:20:34] over to
[1:20:35] Zachariah it was my Zachariah the the
[1:20:39] 4th chapter I is my desire to tell you
[1:20:43] these things many times things happen
[1:20:46] that I don't U don't speak it don't say
[1:20:50] it but this was too outstanding for me
[1:20:53] to keep it from the church amen it must
[1:20:58] be
[1:20:59] told and before God who I stand it's the
[1:21:03] truth amen
[1:21:06] hallelujah I know that there is a
[1:21:10] God and I know that Jesus Christ is the
[1:21:13] Son of God
[1:21:15] Emmanuel dwelling amongst his people
[1:21:18] today in the form of the Holy
[1:21:21] Spirit and I know that the coming of the
[1:21:24] Lord is drawing
[1:21:25] nigh when signs and wonders are
[1:21:28] appearing ammen we just got through the
[1:21:31] seven Church ages and learning that
[1:21:33] we're in the last and latest seean
[1:21:35] Church age when the church would be
[1:21:37] indiffer get cold
[1:21:39] denominate and be organized
[1:21:41] organizations would take it over eat it
[1:21:44] up but a promise that there'd be a
[1:21:46] little Remnant left there would be a
[1:21:49] church it would be scattered abroad
[1:21:51] everywhere but God would gather it
[1:21:52] together and Rapture it into Glory
[1:21:55] amen a little Sanctified group somewhere
[1:21:59] waiting on the Lord praise His name then
[1:22:01] the other day when I got Daniel 70 weeks
[1:22:05] standing right here in the pull pit
[1:22:07] something struck me I've never been able
[1:22:09] to get away from it to see the hour that
[1:22:12] we're living in I want to go somewhere
[1:22:14] and do something else keep it off my
[1:22:16] mind I got too many loved ones that's
[1:22:19] unsaved knowing what can I do to get
[1:22:22] them saved what Israel I can do I have
[1:22:26] preached the
[1:22:28] gospel God has done great signs and
[1:22:30] wonders like he's never done since the
[1:22:32] world since the days of the Lord Jesus
[1:22:35] as he never did it in all the history of
[1:22:37] time and around the world it's went and
[1:22:40] still the world continually gets
[1:22:43] worse but then I have to remember that
[1:22:46] we're living in the lady oan Church age
[1:22:48] where they will get worse and it said
[1:22:51] they
[1:22:52] would then I chose the morning being
[1:22:55] that that message was so attacked and
[1:22:57] another thing that I'm so gotten after
[1:23:01] about is preaching
[1:23:03] Grace I want to speak on that this
[1:23:06] morning as I read the fourth chapter of
[1:23:09] Zechariah a portion of it and the angel
[1:23:13] that talked with me came again and
[1:23:16] awakened me as a man that is waken out
[1:23:19] of sleep and he said unto me what seest
[1:23:22] thou and I said I have looked and behold
[1:23:25] a Candlestick all of gold with a bowl
[1:23:28] upon the top of it and his seven lamps
[1:23:32] there on and seven pipes to the seven
[1:23:35] lamps which are upon the top thereof and
[1:23:39] two olive trees by one upon the right
[1:23:42] side of the bowl and the other upon the
[1:23:44] left side thereof so I answered and
[1:23:47] spake to the angel that talked with me
[1:23:49] saying what are these my Lord and the
[1:23:53] angel that talked with me answered and
[1:23:56] said unto me knowest thou not what these
[1:24:00] be and I said no my Lord then he
[1:24:04] answered and spake unto me saying this
[1:24:07] is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel
[1:24:11] saying not by might nor by power but by
[1:24:15] my spirit sayith the Lord of
[1:24:18] host do you see the message will not
[1:24:21] come by some great mights or Powers but
[1:24:23] by the spirit of God last verse seventh
[1:24:27] verse who art thou oh great Mountain
[1:24:30] before
[1:24:32] zerubabel Thou shalt become a
[1:24:35] plain and he shall bring forth The
[1:24:38] Headstone thereof with shouting crying
[1:24:41] Grace Grace unto it
[1:24:45] Hallelujah
[1:24:46] Grace Grace unto
[1:24:52] it we are all acquainted with this
[1:24:55] scripture that reads the
[1:24:57] Bible we know that this was during the
[1:25:01] time of the preparation of the
[1:25:03] restoration of the
[1:25:07] temple anzer was a great Prince amongst
[1:25:10] the
[1:25:11] people who had laid the foundation of
[1:25:14] the
[1:25:16] building now you want you to put on your
[1:25:19] spiritual
[1:25:21] thinking anointing jacket this morning
[1:25:24] as we
[1:25:25] think and this great
[1:25:29] Prince had determined to rebuild the
[1:25:33] house of the
[1:25:36] Lord and then when he did he had laid
[1:25:39] the foundation stone and as we read on
[1:25:42] farther we find out that God said
[1:25:45] zerubabel has laid the foundation with
[1:25:48] his hands he also shall bring forth The
[1:25:51] Headstone amen
[1:25:55] I want you to
[1:25:56] notice he never said he shall bring
[1:25:58] forth the
[1:26:02] Cornerstone he shall bring forth The
[1:26:06] Headstone and we know that the scripture
[1:26:08] says that Jesus is the Chief
[1:26:12] Cornerstone and he's also the
[1:26:17] headstone now if we will think for a few
[1:26:21] minutes that the seventh Church m
[1:26:24] messenger was to restore the faith of
[1:26:27] the children back to the fathers in
[1:26:30] other words rebuild the church again
[1:26:32] under the power of the spirit Hallelujah
[1:26:36] not by power not by might but by my
[1:26:39] spirit sayeth the Lord not by
[1:26:41] organization not by denomination but by
[1:26:45] the Holy Spirit God will bring forth the
[1:26:47] church in the last days
[1:26:50] hallelujah zerubabel the prince with
[1:26:53] Joshua was the one that was to Bringing
[1:26:56] forth this headstone he had laid the
[1:26:58] foundation he had tuck the people back
[1:27:00] to the foundation in tight which we all
[1:27:03] know that these candlesticks and so
[1:27:05] forth represented both Jewish and church
[1:27:08] they were Olive branches the Bible said
[1:27:10] here and the Olive Branch we are the
[1:27:13] wild branch that was grafted into the
[1:27:15] root of the tamed Olive Tree Gentile and
[1:27:19] out of these two branches come sensor
[1:27:21] pipes going into the seven golden
[1:27:23] candlesticks to give life to the seven
[1:27:26] Church
[1:27:27] ages now remember in our teaching on the
[1:27:31] lessons that we just been through that
[1:27:33] we took the Great Pyramid and studied
[1:27:35] that for a while that Enoch must have
[1:27:38] built and The Headstone was never put in
[1:27:42] the pyramid I've been there the
[1:27:44] architectur of it could never be
[1:27:46] replaced to this day we have no machines
[1:27:48] that could build a pyramid no powers
[1:27:51] less the atomic power that could build
[1:27:54] pyramid because it's too gigantic stone
[1:27:58] that will weigh tons and tons and tons
[1:28:01] stands way in the air so put together
[1:28:04] that even a thin razor blade cannot and
[1:28:06] they're not cemented they're just cut so
[1:28:09] that they Join one with another that's
[1:28:12] the way the body of Jesus Christ should
[1:28:14] be so cut by the Holy Spirit but God's
[1:28:18] Great instrument and tool that we be
[1:28:21] joined as one person we are not
[1:28:25] divided we should be one
[1:28:29] person and it goes to show that no
[1:28:31] Machinery can do that that way it takes
[1:28:34] God to do that no mechanics of
[1:28:37] organization no lodges none of these
[1:28:40] things can ever do it as good as their
[1:28:42] intentions are they can never do it
[1:28:45] because that it takes God to do this the
[1:28:48] Holy
[1:28:49] Spirit I don't think I have a dollar
[1:28:51] bill in my
[1:28:52] pocket but there is yes I do I have a
[1:28:56] dollar bill I'm sorry on the back of
[1:28:59] this dollar bill you'll see the Seal of
[1:29:01] the United States on the left
[1:29:04] side looking towards you from me it be
[1:29:07] on the left side yours is right it's the
[1:29:11] eagle and also in there the coat of arms
[1:29:13] and so forth but on this side here right
[1:29:17] side to me you see the
[1:29:21] pyramid and you notice above the pyramid
[1:29:25] is the
[1:29:26] Capstone and beneath there says the
[1:29:29] Great
[1:29:30] Seal even on our
[1:29:33] currency that we have to recognize no
[1:29:37] Infidel can stamp out
[1:29:39] Christianity every letter that you date
[1:29:42] dates the birth of our Lord every
[1:29:46] calendar everything speaks of
[1:29:48] him even on our currency The Headstone
[1:29:52] which is Christ
[1:29:54] why did not they put the headstone on
[1:29:56] the pyramid because the headstone was
[1:29:58] rejected when he
[1:29:59] come but now according to the prophecy
[1:30:04] there will come The
[1:30:06] Headstone amen now I want you to notice
[1:30:10] that when The Headstone comes the prince
[1:30:13] that's going to cry out the message will
[1:30:15] cry Grace
[1:30:17] Grace Hallelujah for it's by grace are
[1:30:21] we
[1:30:22] saved that not of works any man should
[1:30:24] boast Hallelujah and the message of
[1:30:27] Grace has been traed under the feet of
[1:30:29] man until it's become a
[1:30:31] disgrace some of them runs out into
[1:30:33] eternal security some runs out into
[1:30:37] everything but the true message of Grace
[1:30:40] Remains the Same and there where Satan
[1:30:41] tries to knock it out from the church
[1:30:44] but it's the grace of God that we're all
[1:30:46] saved
[1:30:48] by so in the deity of Jesus Christ if
[1:30:52] the Lord God could come there and
[1:30:54] confirm that that is the truth not only
[1:30:56] that but by his word he confirms it the
[1:30:58] truth and by signs and wonders he
[1:31:01] confirms it's the
[1:31:03] truth then all so Grace is the
[1:31:08] truth then why could anyone
[1:31:11] criticize and say that
[1:31:13] Grace is wrong that we're saved by works
[1:31:18] we are saved by
[1:31:20] grace that through faith not by works
[1:31:25] works shows that you have been saved but
[1:31:29] what saves you is the grace of God grace
[1:31:32] saves you Grace is what God does for you
[1:31:36] works is what you do for God to show
[1:31:39] appreciation of what God did for you but
[1:31:42] by grace are you saved some people
[1:31:45] thinks because I go jar Church put my
[1:31:48] name on the book that's all I have to do
[1:31:51] some people thinks because I shout
[1:31:53] that's all I have to do do others think
[1:31:55] because I speak with tongues that's all
[1:31:56] I have to do some thinks because I got
[1:31:59] power to heal the sick that's all I have
[1:32:01] to do it's
[1:32:02] not it's a grace of God that saves you
[1:32:06] amen God's Amazing Grace
[1:32:10] Hallelujah I could not trust in any
[1:32:12] marriage some said oh there's a great
[1:32:14] man that man I've heard him stand up and
[1:32:16] do this I've heard him stand up and do
[1:32:18] that Paul said in 1 Corinthians 13
[1:32:20] though I speak with tongue of man and
[1:32:22] Angels though I I have discernment
[1:32:24] though I have gifts to feed I'll take
[1:32:27] all my goods to feed the poor though I
[1:32:29] can move mountains with faith though I
[1:32:31] have knowledge to understand all things
[1:32:33] I am
[1:32:35] nothing the love comes in which is Grace
[1:32:39] Hallelujah God has to do it you can do
[1:32:42] all these things and still be lost it's
[1:32:44] Grace that saves you God's grace to the
[1:32:48] human race Hallelujah the think of him I
[1:32:52] was thinking of that Grace
[1:32:54] immediately after that appeared Friday
[1:32:57] morning just at the break of
[1:32:59] day up there in that field when I sit on
[1:33:03] a log later in tears come down in my
[1:33:07] eyes thought oh God your grace is stoop
[1:33:11] to save me why did you ever have such
[1:33:15] pity upon a poor illiterate wret like
[1:33:19] myself how did you ever come down to our
[1:33:22] humble little Tabernacle
[1:33:24] or peace and people of low Walk of Life
[1:33:29] poor have nothing in this world and
[1:33:32] still your grace is spread AB in our
[1:33:35] hearts by the holy spirit that you heal
[1:33:37] our sickness and save our sinsu save us
[1:33:40] from our sins rather and make us your
[1:33:43] people deal with us then I thought of
[1:33:47] David how that when he took a otion to
[1:33:50] build a house unto the Lord said it's
[1:33:53] not right for me to live in a house of
[1:33:54] Cedar and the Ark of the Covenant of my
[1:33:57] God under sheep skins and a
[1:34:01] tabernacle God told the prophet go tell
[1:34:04] my servant
[1:34:05] David I Tu you from the Sheep coat from
[1:34:09] feeding them few sheep out there of your
[1:34:11] daddies and made you a great name like
[1:34:15] great man in the
[1:34:16] earth I thought of the grace of God how
[1:34:20] that he could do that save to the
[1:34:22] uttermost
[1:34:26] Hallelujah and then would take a poor
[1:34:29] Rich like
[1:34:30] myself and give me the opportunity to
[1:34:32] preach the gospel and to see others
[1:34:35] saved see them healed see homes that's
[1:34:38] been broke up straightened up again see
[1:34:41] lives has been ruined made right
[1:34:44] again and they give me Grace IO oh it's
[1:34:48] amazing grace amen then come to a DE
[1:34:53] gred
[1:34:55] low squirrel Hunter out into the woods
[1:34:58] and form himself in a form of the
[1:35:00] rainbow which means a
[1:35:02] covenant with a message that he gave me
[1:35:04] to preach and form it there in a
[1:35:06] covenant that he's behind
[1:35:09] it he'll be behind it because the
[1:35:13] message is of Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[1:35:16] his
[1:35:17] glory how he's let me go all over the
[1:35:20] world around the world to the Nations to
[1:35:22] the millions of people
[1:35:24] seen Millions coming to the Lord and
[1:35:26] accept him as personal savior seen him
[1:35:28] filled with his goodness and Sanctified
[1:35:31] by his power Hallelujah see him healed
[1:35:34] by his great omnipotent power then I can
[1:35:37] cry like the prophet and said it's not
[1:35:40] by power not by might but it's by the
[1:35:42] spirit of God hallelujah not by
[1:35:46] education not by theology but by the
[1:35:48] spirit of God he saves the People by the
[1:35:51] spirit of God he heals the people it's a
[1:35:53] spirit of God that gives a message to
[1:35:55] the people it's the spirit of God that
[1:35:57] confirms the word we've got theologians
[1:36:00] today we've got doctors of divinity
[1:36:02] we've got great man all over the
[1:36:04] world Hallelujah that's smart
[1:36:07] intelligent and educated but it takes a
[1:36:09] Simplicity of believing God to make his
[1:36:12] word speak out to show that Jesus Christ
[1:36:14] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:36:16] amen takes a humble heart dedicated to
[1:36:19] God bring Jesus Christ unto present
[1:36:24] s amen hallelujah if it taken
[1:36:28] theology what would the Presbyterian

[1:36:33] we wouldn't have a
[1:36:35] chance us poor unlearned people but it
[1:36:38] doesn't take
[1:36:40] knowledge not the power or the might but
[1:36:43] by my spirit sayith God I'll unfold this
[1:36:46] mystery
[1:36:48] amen hallelujah and he'll cry to it
[1:36:51] Grace Grace was shoutings and crying
[1:36:56] Hallelujah that's what it is today God's
[1:37:00] Amazing Grace to his
[1:37:02] people how he takes the illiterate the
[1:37:05] unlearned and shows that Jesus is the
[1:37:07] same when he came he never come to the
[1:37:10] great theologians neither did he go to
[1:37:13] caas as a high priest only to be
[1:37:15] condemned by him but he Tau
[1:37:19] fisherman man over poor in Walk the
[1:37:22] common life so there he revealed himself
[1:37:25] and said follow me and I'll make you
[1:37:27] pictures of
[1:37:29] manall show that his grace still reach
[1:37:31] down even from the Jews to the Gentiles
[1:37:33] to call a people for his name in this
[1:37:35] last day as we have just been through an
[1:37:38] amazing grace How Sweet the Sound GL
[1:37:44] Grace is old Grace is as old as the
[1:37:47] world is Grace was first shto the human
[1:37:51] race when we had a beginning of the
[1:37:53] human race
[1:37:54] when the human race was first created in
[1:37:57] the Garden of Eden on that dark morning
[1:38:01] when that little woman had stepped
[1:38:02] across the separating line and had gone
[1:38:06] against God's Commandments and enticed
[1:38:07] her husband to do the same
[1:38:10] thing and the law was
[1:38:14] broken the law must have a penalty or it
[1:38:16] isn't no
[1:38:17] law the law was the day you eat thereof
[1:38:20] that day you shall surely die
[1:38:23] remember the first judgment seat was up
[1:38:26] on the earth and it was in the Garden of
[1:38:30] Eden and the last judgment seat will be
[1:38:34] upon the Earth at the end time the white
[1:38:36] Throne Hallelujah but when Jehovah come
[1:38:40] down I could imagine there wasn't even a
[1:38:42] star to shine it was so dark in that
[1:38:45] light little garden that once was
[1:38:47] because sin had blotted him out had
[1:38:50] taken the light from among them that's
[1:38:52] what's the matter with the church
[1:38:53] churches today that's what's matter with
[1:38:54] the peoples today sin has blotted
[1:38:58] out the light of the Living God show
[1:39:01] Christ still the same yesterday and
[1:39:03] forever and he lives to save to the
[1:39:05] uttermost and to heal to the Lord's sick
[1:39:09] person Hallelujah yes we oh how it was
[1:39:13] terrible that morning Darkness hanging
[1:39:16] in the garden I'd imagine fog of black
[1:39:20] sack
[1:39:21] cloth I'd imagine every leave never
[1:39:25] moved there was no wind
[1:39:28] stirring it was darkness and terrible
[1:39:31] because sin had blotted out
[1:39:34] amen that come Jehovah down like a roar
[1:39:38] of Thunder walking through the garden
[1:39:40] crying Adam Where Art
[1:39:43] Thou that's when Adam realized he is
[1:39:46] naked and had sinned before God he hid
[1:39:49] himself and tried to make himself a
[1:39:51] religion but it didn't work
[1:39:54] God killed some sheep Tu the skins and
[1:39:57] showed that something had to die to
[1:39:58] cover sin jining church will never cover
[1:40:01] sin no dry confession will ever cover
[1:40:04] sin it takes sorrow and repentance and
[1:40:08] the grace of God to cover sin while the
[1:40:13] blood of Jesus Christ the one that God
[1:40:15] killed at Calvary to cover
[1:40:19] sin there in the garden that morning
[1:40:23] When sin was so black Jehovah come in
[1:40:26] there stood his couple standing
[1:40:30] condemned there would be no more human
[1:40:33] race they had to
[1:40:36] die death on the human race give the
[1:40:39] world back to wild beast and there have
[1:40:42] been no human race but in that darkest
[1:40:45] of
[1:40:46] hour in that time when all hopes is gone
[1:40:50] Grace come pouring
[1:40:52] through Hallelujah said I'll give you a
[1:40:54] savior and
[1:40:56] Messiah oh it's a wonder how God could
[1:40:59] ever do
[1:41:00] it God's Amazing Grace in the Garden of
[1:41:04] Eden that give him the promise of a just
[1:41:07] one who could come through the woman the
[1:41:10] woman's seed shall bruise the Serpent's
[1:41:12] head the guilty one and his head shall
[1:41:15] bruise her heel shall there be an
[1:41:16] Affliction to the
[1:41:18] church but he promised a Triumph what
[1:41:21] provided a savior
[1:41:24] Grace Grace hallelujah what could they
[1:41:27] show to Mary
[1:41:29] Grace what could they show to do
[1:41:32] it the Army expression excuse it I only
[1:41:36] want to make it from a pull pit there to
[1:41:38] make a point passing the
[1:41:40] buck Adam said the woman you give me did
[1:41:43] it the woman said the serpent beg me one
[1:41:46] laid it to
[1:41:48] another there was no hopes for him but
[1:41:52] God provided Grace
[1:41:55] and it come breaking
[1:41:56] through and he said but I'll Make A Way
[1:42:00] somehow I'll save you
[1:42:03] regardless you've done wrong you've
[1:42:05] trespassed my
[1:42:07] laws and my laws will have to
[1:42:12] be the Judgment from my laws will have
[1:42:14] to be executed therefore it will have to
[1:42:17] be death because I've said
[1:42:19] death now my Christian friends
[1:42:23] and these tape here that's being made
[1:42:24] will spread across the world let me ask
[1:42:28] you
[1:42:29] something you who try to make
[1:42:33] God be three
[1:42:35] gods are you who try to make him to be
[1:42:39] one like your
[1:42:42] finger he's one in
[1:42:47] person it would not be right for God to
[1:42:50] make an angel die he could not be the
[1:42:53] right kind of a judge and make an angel
[1:42:55] die for a human being that still doesn't
[1:42:58] cure it because his great law demands
[1:43:01] death and something's got to die and an
[1:43:04] angel can't
[1:43:08] die neither could he say Eve because you
[1:43:12] caused Adam to do this I'll make you die
[1:43:16] let Adam live because Adam was partaker
[1:43:19] also
[1:43:21] amen like someone said was justified he
[1:43:24] washed his hands you can't wash the
[1:43:26] blood of Jesus Christ off your hands
[1:43:29] you'll never leave this building this
[1:43:31] morning and go to
[1:43:33] heaven if you die in your
[1:43:36] sins on your
[1:43:39] hands so it isn't right there was only
[1:43:43] one just way there's only one way that
[1:43:46] could be God's Great Law demands could
[1:43:49] be met he had to meet it himself amen he
[1:43:53] he had to do it God's a spirit and he
[1:43:55] can't die am so God had to be made man
[1:44:00] and he died in human flesh in the form
[1:44:02] of a man called Jesus Christ and that
[1:44:04] was the promised Messiah that brought
[1:44:06] the
[1:44:07] grace there where you see that God in
[1:44:09] Christ is the same person God dwelling
[1:44:11] in Christ I am my father and one my
[1:44:14] father dwells in me not me that speak of
[1:44:17] the word but my father that dwelleth in
[1:44:18] Me God in Christ certainly the grace was
[1:44:22] PR in the Garden of Eden and Grace came
[1:44:27] Grace to Adam and Eve no where to go no
[1:44:29] which way to turn and yet Grace made way
[1:44:32] amen let me say this my sinner friend
[1:44:34] you may be here this morning a
[1:44:36] prostitute you may be here this morning
[1:44:38] a woman Chaser you may be here a drunker
[1:44:41] or a gambler or a
[1:44:44] murderer you might be here as an impure
[1:44:48] husband an impure wife you might be the
[1:44:51] bolest of Sinner you say I'mma pass that
[1:44:54] stage of redemption no you're not or you
[1:44:56] wouldn't be at the church this morning
[1:44:59] Hallelujah Grace will make a way for
[1:45:01] you this dark hour if you'll just accept
[1:45:05] it Adam had to be willing to accept it
[1:45:09] so do you accept
[1:45:12] it the grace of God reached over in
[1:45:14] Noah's
[1:45:16] time Noah just an ordinary
[1:45:19] man he and his family but because Noah
[1:45:23] feared
[1:45:25] God he believed God you can't fear God
[1:45:29] without believing how can you fear
[1:45:30] something you don't believe am you've
[1:45:33] got to fear God Solomon said the fear of
[1:45:36] God's beginning of wisdom yes amen now
[1:45:40] just the fear of God you're beginning to
[1:45:41] have wisdom and the fear of God Noah
[1:45:45] feared the Lord and he believed the Lord
[1:45:49] amen and that's what God honors is your
[1:45:52] faith
[1:45:53] him that's right then when the fear of
[1:45:57] God come upon Noah God called him by
[1:46:01] grace and saved him in his
[1:46:05] house because it was Grace that did it
[1:46:08] not because Noah was a great big
[1:46:10] handsomer man than all the rest of them
[1:46:12] not because Noah went to the best Church
[1:46:14] there was in the country not because he
[1:46:16] belonged to the best in organization not
[1:46:19] because he could dress better not
[1:46:21] because he had more money not because he
[1:46:23] is some special person but because of
[1:46:26] the grace of God God saved
[1:46:29] Noah Grace saved Noah not his works but
[1:46:34] his grace and also saved his family we
[1:46:37] call another character where God's grace
[1:46:39] was extended many of them we just speak
[1:46:41] of a few

[1:46:56] there to dwell in a city of AA and while
[1:47:00] he was there God spoke to him by
[1:47:03] Grace not because he's different not
[1:47:05] because he's a better man but by Grace

[1:47:28] run Abraham spoke of
[1:47:30] us God take God took Abraham by grace
[1:47:34] and saved him and that's how he takes
[1:47:36] you by grace and how do we test these
[1:47:41] patients today we're up tomorrow we're
[1:47:43] down one day we believe the next day

[1:48:04] grace of God we'd all be
[1:48:06] gone sure God Saves Us by his
[1:48:10] grace Abraham was supposed to stay in
[1:48:12] that land but he went down into this
[1:48:14] child ends or not child ends but the
[1:48:17] Philistines went down there to souljourn
[1:48:19] to get out of the famine things are a
[1:48:21] little hard up in his country so he went
[1:48:23] down there to Journey down there with
[1:48:24] them done exactly what God told him not

[1:48:35] from taking his wife grace of God when
[1:48:37] Abraham said it's my
[1:48:39] sister lied about it but yet the grace
[1:48:42] of God held him because he repented amen

[1:48:58] you'll just repent God's grace is
[1:49:00] sufficient I good old Abraham brought
[1:49:03] him back and remember Abraham was not
[1:49:06] saved by his Works he was saved by grace
[1:49:11] Abraham was saved by faith which is
[1:49:14] Grace and God saved Abraham because of
[1:49:18] his grace not because of his behavior he
[1:49:21] saved him because of his Grace amen oh
[1:49:24] how
[1:49:25] good he was saved by grace let's take
[1:49:28] Israel I've got a scripture written down
[1:49:30] here I write it down that I can just
[1:49:31] refer to it in my mind if you want to
[1:49:33] put it down this will be a good one to
[1:49:34] remember if you want to Deuteronomy
[1:49:36] 7:7 um God gave Abraham uh his promise
[1:49:41] or gave not Abraham pardon me gave
[1:49:43] asrael and told him if you will not
[1:49:45] associate with
[1:49:47] idolatry if you will not do these things
[1:49:51] if you will stay away from all these
[1:49:53] Pagan ceremonies if you'll do all these
[1:49:57] things then I'll bring you to a good
[1:49:59] land I'll take care of you I'll feed you
[1:50:03] I'll lead
[1:50:04] you I'll do these things if you do such
[1:50:08] and such if you'll love me if you'll
[1:50:10] keep my Commandments my statutes my
[1:50:12] ordinances I'll do all these things if
[1:50:15] you'll just do something keep my
[1:50:17] Commandments and love me just like a
[1:50:19] husband taking a wife and saying if
[1:50:22] you'll be a good woman if you'll take
[1:50:25] care of the house if you'll be true to

[1:50:30] them if you'll do things I'll work till
[1:50:33] my hands bleed to make you
[1:50:36] living if you'll do it but then think
[1:50:39] what if that woman turns WR look lazy
[1:50:42] won't work won't do
[1:50:44] nothing then it takes
[1:50:46] Grace to keep that family
[1:50:49] together oh God
[1:50:53] it taken the grace of Jehovah to keep
[1:50:55] his family together that's the only way
[1:50:57] we're Jehovah's family today is because
[1:50:59] of the grace of Jesus Christ we'd all be
[1:51:02] gone but it's Grace oh
[1:51:06] [Music]
[1:51:09] Grace now but they didn't keep
[1:51:12] it but they were never did come to the
[1:51:14] full promise not that generation no the
[1:51:18] one that promis is made to perished in
[1:51:20] the wilderness but God fed him God took
[1:51:22] care of him God loved
[1:51:25] him he moved around why his grace did it
[1:51:29] his grace because of his promise his
[1:51:32] promise and the grace that went with his
[1:51:34] promise but they never did come to the
[1:51:36] full value of The Promise Land and
[1:51:40] neither does this church come to its
[1:51:41] full value the grace of God holds us but
[1:51:44] he wants to get a church that'll
[1:51:47] obey a people that'll take his word and
[1:51:50] say it's a truth regardless of your
[1:51:52] Argan
[1:51:53] ation he wants a people that will not
[1:51:55] say well I'm just as good as you are I'm
[1:51:58] Presbyterian I'm Methodist I'm Catholic
[1:51:59] I'm as good as you
[1:52:01] are that's not Grace that shows you
[1:52:04] something
[1:52:05] wrong but a person
[1:52:07] regardless that'll read God's word and
[1:52:10] see that you've got to be born again and
[1:52:11] filled with the Holy Ghost they'll
[1:52:14] believe
[1:52:15] that they'll take it by the word they'll
[1:52:18] take the word exactly what it
[1:52:20] says like in baptisms from
[1:52:23] sprinkling baptism is right there's
[1:52:26] nobody in the Bible ever sprinkled no
[1:52:29] such a thing in the scripture neither
[1:52:31] was there ever anybody baptized in the
[1:52:33] name of father son holy ghost in the
[1:52:34] Bible is everyone baptized in the name
[1:52:36] of Jesus Christ so there's not one not
[1:52:39] even one Speck of history for if anybody
[1:52:42] can show anywhere anywhere in the
[1:52:44] history where any person was ever
[1:52:46] baptized in the Bible are 300 years
[1:52:48] after the death of the last disciple
[1:52:50] until the Catholic Church if anybody can
[1:52:53] show anywhere that anybody was ever
[1:52:54] sprinkled or baptized in the name of
[1:52:56] Father Son and Holy Ghost until the
[1:52:58] Catholic Church you're so Duty bound to
[1:53:01] come tell
[1:53:02] me it's not there but what do we do
[1:53:06] we've been through the church agents to
[1:53:07] see where they had to do that so you see
[1:53:11] God wants somebody that will obey him if
[1:53:14] it's not in the scriptures then it's not
[1:53:16] a man it's a man-made Doctrine and not a
[1:53:19] Bible
[1:53:20] Doctrine see so regardless of what the
[1:53:23] church is how wrong you've been what
[1:53:25] difference does that make it's how right
[1:53:27] you can be
[1:53:28] now God's Grace has showed it to you
[1:53:31] then walking God's grace remember Moses
[1:53:34] also that great
[1:53:36] leader God should have killed him when
[1:53:39] he went down there to glorify himself
[1:53:41] but Smite in that rock and said you see
[1:53:42] what I can do in other words you rebels
[1:53:45] must we fetch your water from this rock
[1:53:47] and he smoted it and the waters didn't
[1:53:48] come he smoted it again what did he do
[1:53:50] he testified of the weakness of the of
[1:53:52] Christ because Christ was that rock
[1:53:55] That's The
[1:53:56] Headstone instead of smiting it or
[1:53:59] speaking to it it was smitten once
[1:54:01] remember God told Moses over in Exodus
[1:54:03] go out and I'll Stand before before you
[1:54:06] up on the Rock and smite The Rock and he
[1:54:09] smoked the Rock and brought forth Waters
[1:54:10] God said the next time go speak to the
[1:54:12] Rock and he'll bring forth his Waters
[1:54:14] but Moses want to show he had a little
[1:54:15] authority a little power so he said I'll
[1:54:17] bring you water out of this Rock God
[1:54:20] should have killed him far God should
[1:54:22] have separated him now he broke God's
[1:54:24] law right there because he spoke of the
[1:54:27] weakness of Christ he has to be smitten
[1:54:28] the second time Christ is only smitten
[1:54:31] once now we speak to the Rock and it
[1:54:34] brings forth its water but what was it
[1:54:37] let's look at the old man he's
[1:54:40] 120 someone said to me not long ago said
[1:54:42] God is an unjust God said because he let
[1:54:45] Moses down that told them Hebrews for 40
[1:54:48] years and that Wilderness out there he
[1:54:50] let him down and then would he let him
[1:54:51] go to Promised Land all
[1:54:54] nonsense no he didn't let Moses
[1:54:58] down he went to the promised
[1:55:00] land about 700 years later he was saw up
[1:55:04] on top of Mount Transfiguration as loud
[1:55:07] as he ever was standing talking to Jesus
[1:55:11] before he went to Calvary him and Elijah
[1:55:14] standing together talking to Moses
[1:55:18] Elijah appeared to Jesus Peter James and
[1:55:21] John on Mount Transfiguration he was not
[1:55:24] dead he was alive God didn't let him
[1:55:27] down he was in
[1:55:28] Palestine now look before he died he
[1:55:32] climbed up Mount
[1:55:34] Neo that morning when he knew he was
[1:55:37] going you done stripped Aaron put his
[1:55:40] clothes up
[1:55:41] another took his own Rob put up
[1:55:44] Joshua commanded him to stay with them
[1:55:48] precepts and when he climbed up to the
[1:55:50] top of Mount Neo went through the valley
[1:55:52] in the plains knowing he's going up
[1:55:54] there the die and climbed up on Mount
[1:55:55] nebor and up to
[1:55:56] pisga while he was standing up there God
[1:55:59] said look over in the land I want you to
[1:56:02] see
[1:56:03] it
[1:56:05] Moses you could have went over
[1:56:08] there but you know what you did down
[1:56:10] there at the rock that day you glorified
[1:56:13] yourself I think that's why it's going
[1:56:15] to be a great trouble with a lot of us
[1:56:17] people
[1:56:17] today go down there at the Rock and you
[1:56:20] glorify yourself but no
[1:56:23] when he got ready to die there stood The
[1:56:26] Rock Amen he must just stepped over on
[1:56:29] the Rock there at
[1:56:30] pisan and God buried
[1:56:33] him but he must have rose again
[1:56:35] somewhere because he was
[1:56:37] alive he's the type of Christ there he
[1:56:39] was then on Mount Transfiguration
[1:56:42] hundreds of years later over in
[1:56:44] Palestine see the grace of God provided
[1:56:46] the Rock Amen oh my when I think of
[1:56:51] Abraham of all the mistakes that he
[1:56:54] made and Moses and his
[1:56:56] mistakes but when Abraham's commentary
[1:57:00] was written when the Divine commentary
[1:57:03] was written when Paul wrote Abraham's
[1:57:06] commentary he never mention one thing
[1:57:08] about Abraham's
[1:57:10] unbelief no no there wasn't even
[1:57:12] accounted to him he said Abraham
[1:57:15] standard not the promise of God through
[1:57:17] unbelief but with strong giving praise
[1:57:19] to God Amen my humble prayer is before
[1:57:22] for the grace of God that you're this
[1:57:23] morning I hope mine wrote like that that
[1:57:26] he won't see my mistakes that when my
[1:57:29] commentary is written in my obituary
[1:57:32] that it won't be read out I made
[1:57:34] mistakes and done wrong but it'll only
[1:57:36] see the things that I tried to do for
[1:57:38] him may they just be coming what does
[1:57:40] that he'll take the grace of God that I
[1:57:42] believe in and that's where I'm solely
[1:57:44] trusting for my own marriage I can no
[1:57:46] more go in and unrest but upon the grace
[1:57:49] of God I'm depending yes it's Grace
[1:57:52] Hallelujah that I'm depending on there
[1:57:54] was a rock there when Moses got ready to
[1:57:56] die what could we say of David the grace
[1:57:59] of God that great warrior to whom God
[1:58:03] himself he said he's a man at of my own
[1:58:05] heart that great warrior David how could
[1:58:08] he do such a thing he he done to take
[1:58:11] Ura he Soldier when he had a handful of
[1:58:15] Gentiles out there as

[1:58:20] story just for a moment
[1:58:23] when they had the soldiers out there and
[1:58:25] Ur was one who stood by
[1:58:29] David Ura was a proelite he was a hatip
[1:58:32] a proelite to the Jewish religion and
[1:58:36] that man loved David so much they seen

[1:59:11] dawning is upon Him upon his message of
[1:59:13] his coming amen and he'll be king what
[1:59:17] did he do one day he would stand up
[1:59:19] there thirsty for a drink of water from
[1:59:21] the gate out there Bethlehem where he
[1:59:22] used to go her the sheep and you know
[1:59:24] what two of those men took a swords and

[1:59:29] him a bucket of water Hallelujah because
[1:59:33] why his least desire was a commandment
[1:59:35] to them think of that and they cut
[1:59:38] through those men always in the top of
[1:59:39] that mountain to where they said he was
[1:59:40] standing he'd be about 15 miles they
[1:59:42] went through there and every man raised
[1:59:43] up they du with him till they killed him
[1:59:45] went on through and took his bucket and
[1:59:46] got a bucket of water right through the
[1:59:47] enemy's line two
[1:59:49] men to get their King their brother

[2:03:03] all subject to death and should die for
[2:03:06] it when David did that evil thing his
[2:03:09] own judgment should have killed him when

[2:03:39] the boy died when the sun went down with
[2:03:42] a battled knife in his
[2:03:44] hand blood on his shield for he stood
[2:03:48] for Israel yet a proelite he was to the

[2:03:53] then when joab come back and told him
[2:03:54] that that David had di that U had died

[2:04:12] finally the baby died they was afraid to
[2:04:15] tell uh David that the baby is
[2:04:18] dead and he died then he thought her
[2:04:21] everything was heed so he comforted BBA
[2:04:24] he'd already taken her for his wife
[2:04:26] after all those other wives this old
[2:04:28] Prophet old baldheaded fell stomped in

[2:05:12] same spoon he eat with he slept with the
[2:05:14] lamb everything is just he's just like a
[2:05:16] daughter to him and one day a visitor
[2:05:18] came so instead of the rich man taking
[2:05:20] one of his own sheep and and making a
[2:05:22] feast for the visor well instead of that
[2:05:25] he went over took the poor man's lamb
[2:05:27] and by force took the lamb and slated it
[2:05:30] and made a feast now that was David's

[2:16:58] son and one day a murder killed that
[2:17:03] boy and through that

[2:17:08] that murder they finally found that
[2:17:11] murder when they found him they brought
[2:17:13] him back and imprisoned him and when
[2:17:15] they did a trial was set and a sentence
[2:17:18] was made oh it was a terrible thing he
[2:17:22] had murdered the King's son and he knew
[2:17:25] what was coming to him they put him into
[2:17:27] the inner cells they locked the doors
[2:17:29] they put pads on it so no one the guards
[2:17:31] around it CU we know what kind of a
[2:17:34] horrible punishment this boy was going
[2:17:35] to receive because he killed the King's
[2:17:38] son the Royal King's
[2:17:41] son guards is placed all around the
[2:17:43] doors he put an inner cell stripping
[2:17:46] nothing but a loin cloth on there he was
[2:17:49] set there in that condition and starv
[2:17:52] and wouldn't give him nothing to eat and
[2:17:54] sitting in that condition then they
[2:17:56] brought him out to a trial he was found
[2:17:59] guilty and proven guilty a sentence is
[2:18:01] made that he is to be executed under
[2:18:04] horrible capital
[2:18:06] punishment he is to be killed by inches
[2:18:09] until his mortal life is gone sentenced
[2:18:11] by the
[2:18:12] judge he is to die and he begged and he
[2:18:16] cried and he said though I am guilty
[2:18:19] though I am guilty
[2:18:21] I'm sorry that I did that I wish I had
[2:18:24] never done it I'm sorry that I did in a
[2:18:26] moment of a rage of temper I did it I
[2:18:29] didn't mean to do it that way one day
[2:18:31] the king went down to the place to visit
[2:18:33] the boy to tell him talk to him and tell
[2:18:38] him about killing his own son the only
[2:18:40] son he had he'd kill that boy he said
[2:18:42] I'm going down to talk to him and when
[2:18:44] he went down there he looked back in
[2:18:46] that cage like a caged in animal he saw

[2:49:08] what God sees many times we see
[2:49:10] ourselves this way and that way that's
[2:49:13] how God seen it and like how God saw uh
[2:49:16] uh th Mighty Man of Valor Gideon and so
[2:49:19] on God saw him a certain way God saw
[2:49:21] Abraham a certain way God sees you a
[2:49:23] certain way you may not see yourself
[2:49:25] that way but that's how God sees you and
[2:49:27] you have to begin to confess how God
[2:49:29] sees you you want to know that you are
[2:49:31] seeing to the eyes of God but flip the
[2:49:33] script now not about you now but others
[2:49:36] how does God see others you may see this
[2:49:38] one finished you may see this one can't
[2:49:40] make it and this one God doesn't want
[2:49:41] you to see that way you have to still
[2:49:43] look now for others Through The Eyes Of
[2:49:45] God to see that his grace could reach to
[2:49:47] the lowest to the deepest to the viest
[2:49:50] to the Whatever It Is God grace could
[2:49:53] still reach and bring them out that's
[2:49:55] why we say don't write off anybody don't
[2:49:56] cut off anybody God God grace could
[2:49:58] still come down and deal with them
[2:50:00] regardless of what your eyes see just as

[2:50:09] blessed be the name of the Lord and
[2:50:11] that's when we come into the true
[2:50:12] spiritual maturity where that Sun Shines
[2:50:14] on the just and the unjust like we see
[2:50:16] the sun doesn't shine on marijuana only

[2:55:28] Thomson God bless you
[2:55:30] Saints well we at that Junction again
[2:55:32] where we making physical preparations
[2:55:35] for convention coming but I want to put
[2:55:38] that in the context of uh a general
[2:55:41] awareness of what it takes to keep us
[2:55:44] going this is from a financial
[2:55:46] perspective
[2:55:48] and um over the last I would say even
[2:55:52] couple years a lot of our
[2:55:55] offerings and I want to at this Junction
[2:55:58] thank people who have extended
[2:56:00] themselves but I thought I would provide
[2:56:03] a little more background so that people
[2:56:06] in making decisions to Avail yourself
[2:56:09] your resources in whatever kind
[2:56:11] Financial or otherwise that you would
[2:56:13] make a more informed decision with
[2:56:16] regard to what we're doing and what we
[2:56:18] trying to
[2:56:19] achieve um many of you would have seen
[2:56:22] coming in this morning that we have
[2:56:24] begun the con some construction at the
[2:56:27] back this is for additional toilets for
[2:56:31] sisters um this has been on our heart to
[2:56:34] do for several years the pandemic kind
[2:56:37] of inter interrupted the program
[2:56:40] somewhat um because there's a greater
[2:56:44] need we have more sisters Among Us and
[2:56:47] there's a greater need need especially
[2:56:49] at convention time this is heightened
[2:56:51] where it's a strain on the current set
[2:56:54] of toilets that we have we've tried to
[2:56:57] rent in the last few years but that is
[2:57:02] always proving kind of a shaky we
[2:57:04] thought we would put something that is
[2:57:06] uh more permanent in place something
[2:57:09] that is more accommodating to the
[2:57:12] sisters our deserving
[2:57:14] sisters um our offerings and stuff
[2:57:18] generally speaking going over the last
[2:57:21] couple years have not always met
[2:57:24] recurring
[2:57:26] expenditure and um this is something
[2:57:28] that always proves a challenge I know
[2:57:30] that sometimes people come lights are on
[2:57:33] a air condition is going stuff is
[2:57:35] happening and we think that um okay you
[2:57:39] know I'm okay I don't need to do
[2:57:41] anything more but I'm seeing that it has
[2:57:45] not met our recurring expenditure and we
[2:57:48] want people in terms of when you're
[2:57:50] thinking of any sacrifice that you're
[2:57:52] making or further
[2:57:54] sacrifice that it is against the
[2:57:56] backdrop of
[2:57:59] listen more needs to be done and then
[2:58:02] the question comes on on a personal
[2:58:04] level what can I do more can I make
[2:58:06] myself more available to assist I'm a
[2:58:08] trades person I'm a this I'm a that I'm
[2:58:10] a that can I make financial resources
[2:58:13] available and um it always comes down to
[2:58:17] some form of sacrif
[2:58:18] sacrifice you know the the giving of
[2:58:21] ease I in in Reading when Solomon was
[2:58:24] constructing the
[2:58:26] temple they reached a point where they
[2:58:29] have to tell Believers listen don't
[2:58:31] don't bring anything more we we we have
[2:58:33] enough we are not from there we are not
[2:58:36] there we are far from that and um my
[2:58:40] sharing this with you this morning is to
[2:58:42] encourage people to make a more informed
[2:58:45] decision inquire about we've put out
[2:58:48] notices about
[2:58:50] um the pledges for convention and we we
[2:58:55] are not in the habit of making
[2:58:59] um taking up five offerings and saying
[2:59:02] well this one is for the toilet this one
[2:59:05] is so that we we we are not about that
[2:59:07] as you would know here you see that the
[2:59:09] focus is on the word but in order for
[2:59:12] the word to be received by those that we
[2:59:15] have coming into the Tabernacle there
[2:59:17] has to an environment that's created and
[2:59:19] it from a trusty perspective this is
[2:59:21] very physical it's dollars and cents
[2:59:24] it's it costs so we want people to think
[2:59:29] along a certain
[2:59:30] line more needs to be done and the next
[2:59:33] question is can I do more so I'm just
[2:59:36] giving a a overview this morning we were
[2:59:39] supposed to have done this a while back
[2:59:41] but I'm thinking that we at the junction
[2:59:44] where we we need to say it and reinforce
[2:59:47] it
[2:59:48] and hope that this would result in some
[2:59:51] positive response from all present you
[2:59:55] can share this with those who are not
[2:59:57] here
[2:59:58] today and um I want to say that want to
[3:00:03] thank all the people who have been
[3:00:05] extending themselves all the people who
[3:00:08] have come forward and volunteered to do
[3:00:10] things and given of their substance we
[3:00:12] want to thank you but we want to be able
[3:00:15] to State also that listen we need more
[3:00:18] more needs to be done and we want to
[3:00:20] thank you in advance for your positive
[3:00:23] response thank you very much God bless
