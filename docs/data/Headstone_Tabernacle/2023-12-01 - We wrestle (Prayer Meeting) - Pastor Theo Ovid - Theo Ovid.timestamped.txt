[11:47] Ephesians 6 you want to read verse
[11:50] 12 Ephesians 6 vers 12 Genesis 32
[11:56] reading from verse 24 speaking about
[11:59] Jacob here and after he parted his wise
[12:03] because he had issues with his brother
[12:06] Esau and we want to just look at that
[12:08] again tonight and Jacob was left alone
[12:11] Genesis 32 vers 24 and Jacob was left
[12:16] alone and sometimes we want we don't
[12:18] want to be alone we are busy whether on
[12:20] Facebook whether with friends whether
[12:22] with family we are very very busy we
[12:25] don't want to be alone alone give us
[12:27] time to think alone give it time to
[12:29] meditate alone give it time to consider
[12:33] and review your walk your life Jacob was
[12:37] left alone and there Wrestled a man with
[12:39] him until the breaking of the day when
[12:43] he saw that he prevailed not against him
[12:46] he touched the hollow of his thigh and
[12:48] the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of
[12:50] joint as he wrestled with him and he
[12:54] said let me go for the day break it and
[12:57] he said I will not let thee go except
[13:00] thou bless me and he said unto him what
[13:03] is thy name and he said Jacob and he
[13:06] said thy name shall be shall be called
[13:09] No More Jacob but Israel for as a prince
[13:12] H has thou power with God and with men
[13:16] and has prevailed and Jacob asked him
[13:18] and said tell me I pray thee thy name he
[13:22] said wherefore is it that thou asks
[13:24] after my name and he blessed him there
[13:27] and Jacob called the name of the place
[13:29] pennyel for I have seen God face to face
[13:33] and my life is preserved Ephesians
[13:38] 612 for we wrestle not against flesh and
[13:40] blood but against
[13:42] principalities against Powers against
[13:45] the rulers of Darkness of this world
[13:49] against spiritual wickedness in high
[13:51] places let me read it again for we
[13:53] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[13:57] against principalities against Powers
[13:59] against rulers of the darkness of this
[14:01] world against spiritual wickedness in
[14:04] high places may God bless his word and
[14:07] uh may God be with us
[14:10] tonight it's good to be
[14:12] here uh it's great to be in sath on
[14:15] Wednesday night if you have Wednesday
[14:16] night message you should the junction
[14:18] message is an important message uh the
[14:21] two spirits in the framework of the
[14:23] Christian church and tonight this what I
[14:26] get up on my heart and our titled two
[14:28] words we wrestle we
[14:31] wrestle and um you know brother Anthony
[14:35] was singing that song and everything
[14:37] give him thanks just the other night I
[14:39] was in some pain and um it test to me
[14:42] and everything else and I Su
[14:45] myself raising my hands and praising God
[14:48] amidst the pain and I recognized that um
[14:52] the little acts of Fai that we do like
[14:54] in everything give him thanks nobody
[14:57] wants to be sick nobody body wants to
[14:59] feel unwell is not something we we
[15:01] cherish as such but this is part of this
[15:04] thing called life and is what we do when
[15:07] we are faced with it I cannot preach to
[15:10] you give him thanks in the good times
[15:11] and bad times and when my bad times come
[15:14] I can't give them thanks we have to
[15:16] begin to apply the word to our lives
[15:19] that it can become effective you don't
[15:22] want to be like doing religion then you
[15:25] don't want to be like coming to church
[15:27] and going back home
[15:29] and it's not been applied to you you
[15:31] want to have a sense that this means
[15:34] more that you're coming to something
[15:36] that is greater more powerful than you
[15:38] that God want you to be a part of not in
[15:41] ritual because after a while the Scribe
[15:43] and Pharisees they were caught up in
[15:46] rituals um that's is why they question
[15:48] Jesus about why his disciples not
[15:50] washing hands because washing hands
[15:52] wasn't a scriptural Duty in that way and
[15:55] they had a ceremony of washing of hands
[15:58] and every every time they go to do
[15:59] something they wash their hands wash
[16:00] hands and that washing hands was to make
[16:02] sure nothing unclean Gentiles this that
[16:05] and another and that they were above
[16:07] those things but Jesus said you with
[16:09] your Traditions make the word of none
[16:11] effect so what God wants God want the
[16:14] word to be effective God doesn't want
[16:17] the word to be used as like a a good
[16:20] luck Chan when you're ready to wrap your
[16:22] word around you because you want to be
[16:23] lucky you want a job you want a wife you
[16:25] want a husband you want a car you want a
[16:27] whatever whatever God is not that's not
[16:29] what the word is for the word supposed
[16:32] to be something we surrender to that he
[16:35] could find the preeminence Jesus short
[16:38] circuited the whole list of people to
[16:40] call by getting these uneducated men
[16:44] because they were more how you say they
[16:47] had the ability to be submissive to the
[16:49] word that why he could use them now I
[16:52] used to think that intellectual means
[16:55] somebody with plenty head you know
[16:57] education and like that but
[16:59] intellectualism is actually a spirit so
[17:02] somebody could be read and write and
[17:03] they intellectual intellectual have to
[17:06] do with reasoning so somebody could have
[17:09] zero education but they have an
[17:11] intellectual spirit and that
[17:13] intellectual Spirit hinders them from
[17:15] operating at a faith level because
[17:18] anytime you reason Faith get thrown out
[17:20] of the books so you have to able to to
[17:23] cast on reasoning and let Faith have its
[17:26] way and when Faith Works and instead
[17:29] operate you recognize it's God at work
[17:31] then you see five l two fishes God is at
[17:33] work what are these among many that is
[17:36] sight that is reasoning that is
[17:38] intellect at work looking with eyes and
[17:41] saying you know what fire Los and two
[17:44] fishes that's a tough call but when
[17:46] Jesus took it and blessed it and said
[17:48] yes share it that's fi that that that
[17:50] that is fi he didn't multiply it and
[17:52] have 10,000 fishes and 10,000 bread no
[17:54] he just take it bless it share it that
[17:57] that is the act of faith and we
[17:58] want to come back to that Simplicity of
[18:01] believing exactly what God said because
[18:04] at the end of the day and I want you to
[18:06] see the structure of the scripture we
[18:08] read Tonight We R not against flesh and
[18:11] blood but against one principalities two
[18:16] Powers three rulers of
[18:20] Darkness four spiritual wickedness in
[18:24] high places so Satan kingdom is
[18:27] structured
[18:29] it is not anything go it have
[18:33] principalities it have powers it have
[18:36] rulers of Darkness so this man have
[18:38] generals and lieutenants and and and
[18:40] captains and and so on like that and it
[18:44] start at the top because remember all
[18:47] the kingdoms of this world belongs to
[18:49] him so all the presidents of the world
[18:52] the prime ministers of the world they
[18:54] are being influenced by principalities
[18:57] they are influenc to make laws and what
[19:00] everything I want you to see it in a
[19:02] panoramic if God could just pull us up
[19:04] in a in like a helicopter and look down
[19:07] and see in the panoramic this world is
[19:10] not for you if you believe you're
[19:13] Christian this world is not for
[19:16] us this world is
[19:18] Antichrist really this world is not even
[19:21] ours as it is this is Satan's Eden we
[19:24] trying to pass through this Satan Eden
[19:27] to get back to God's Eden
[19:29] and we needed the restoration of the
[19:30] word by this end time Prophet Messenger
[19:33] to be able to do that so tonight I want
[19:36] you to see it this way we wrestle we
[19:39] wrestling every day I would like to show
[19:42] you that in wrestling you cannot go in a
[19:45] wrong weight category you have small 150
[19:49] pound wrestlers itd have 300 pound
[19:51] wrestlers 600 pound wrestlers so God
[19:53] wouldn't line you up and you are 150
[19:55] pound with a 600 pound God will not give
[19:58] you more than you can be so anytime you
[20:01] in your battle you are to understand it
[20:04] is designed for you it could be rough it
[20:06] could be tough but God will not be
[20:09] unjust so God wouldn't let you line up
[20:12] unfairly he has prepared you and you
[20:15] have to understand in your heart there
[20:16] is a way out of what you are being
[20:18] challenged with there's a way out of
[20:20] what you are faced with right now amen
[20:23] so praise God that's a little
[20:24] introductory of what we want to share
[20:26] tonight okay
[20:28] so we read it we are battling not
[20:32] against family not against and this is
[20:35] where a lot of carnal church members
[20:38] miss the vot you know like people who
[20:40] think like brother and church and they
[20:42] fighting me and they fighting the
[20:43] ministry and the fighting and the kind
[20:45] and the Flesh and what they do now they
[20:48] take that disrespectful spirit and put
[20:49] it on their family on their children and
[20:51] the children carry on with that Spirit
[20:54] too now here what they don't understand
[20:57] and here what a lot of don't understand
[20:59] it's a spirit world we live in the
[21:03] natural but the reality is a spirit
[21:06] world the battle that was of angels and
[21:09] now the Battle of men so when we temper
[21:13] and we get involved with the wrong
[21:15] influences we don't know how much it
[21:18] affects our family and our
[21:21] lives for instance the woman who came to
[21:25] Jesus and said uh can to Jesus and said
[21:28] about um my daughter is vexed with a
[21:31] devil that's a spiritual condition she
[21:34] know these Pharisees and scribes they
[21:36] have no power they only have argument
[21:37] and talk and ritual so them on books
[21:40] tapes and and Revelations and Mysteries
[21:42] and all kind of stuff but they have zero
[21:45] power so she know Jesus have the power
[21:48] to deliver a daughter Jesus say it's not
[21:51] fit to take the children's bread and
[21:52] cast it to dogs now she could have get
[21:54] Vex angry and walk away from that man
[21:57] but she stood a ground
[21:58] and say even the dogs it Crumbs from off
[22:03] the master table now watch this she said
[22:07] the right thing not only that Jesus
[22:10] himself said for this saying so in other
[22:14] words her words of respect her words to
[22:19] God her words to what was challenging to
[22:23] her was so powerful it had a spiritual
[22:27] boomerang if I could use that she
[22:29] actually activate a spiritual boomerang
[22:33] that deliver the family so what I'm
[22:35] saying just as her words could activate
[22:40] a boomerang to deliver her family the
[22:42] reverse is also true you could say
[22:45] things that bind your family you could
[22:49] say things that affect your family in a
[22:52] negative way and you would wonder why
[22:54] things are not working out as you want
[22:56] it to work out and and it's all come
[22:59] back to you you who sit in a position of
[23:03] influence as mother as father as
[23:06] grandmother as grandfather as husband
[23:08] wife whatever especially parents when
[23:11] you sit in that position of influence
[23:14] over your children and your action and
[23:17] attitude they get the Vibes off you if
[23:19] it is negative the children grasp a
[23:21] negative fact you don't have to even
[23:23] talk it's the spirit atmosphere that
[23:25] they catch and then it begins to unfold
[23:28] in such different ways but tonight I
[23:31] want to challenge you the battle is not
[23:33] flesh and blood this is the Bible not
[23:36] your uncle and aunt and this one who
[23:38] like you and what no is Spirits behind
[23:41] people this service last Wednesday night
[23:44] was an astonishing one for me I was
[23:47] blown in my mind the way let me say this
[23:50] way the message was crafted and I know
[23:54] in myself I couldn't just do that
[23:56] humanly I know
[23:58] it was by the holy spirit that it was
[24:01] fitted together and when I begin to
[24:05] see like on a different level then I
[24:09] begin to see principalities and power
[24:12] standing with ministers
[24:14] G looking for control understand this
[24:18] the nicolan spirit is a spirit that
[24:21] binds theity is a spirit that want to
[24:24] control others it's a controlling spirit
[24:26] it's a very influential
[24:28] and God want
[24:29] sovereignity God wants the independence
[24:32] of the local church God wants you to be
[24:35] able to be led by the Spirit by the word
[24:39] and yet the devil looking at
[24:41] opportunities how to get in to your life
[24:45] let's let's let me say this now
[24:49] now they are DOs and dos and they back
[24:54] door and if we live wrong we open open
[24:58] doors to Spirits to influences to come
[25:01] into our lives into our homes and affect
[25:04] us and that is why we have to begin to
[25:07] close the gap and close the doors now
[25:10] the Jesus taught that when a devil is
[25:13] cast out he is roaming because he
[25:16] doesn't have a house so he come like I
[25:18] wouldn't say vagrant but he homeless
[25:21] he's Kicked Out the Devil is harmless
[25:24] until he get somebody to use we have to
[25:28] ensure and you have to ensure you are
[25:30] not the one devil using let me say that
[25:33] again you should ensure you are not the
[25:36] one that the devil is using because your
[25:39] will be exposed you have to want to be
[25:41] one that God is using because God
[25:44] himself is like harmless or until he
[25:47] gets a body that he could use so God
[25:50] want a body which is a temple and the
[25:52] devil want a body which is a temple so
[25:55] therefore there are influences and every
[25:57] single day we're in a battle because his
[26:00] family saying this is this one saying
[26:01] that is the boss is the neighbor is
[26:03] Brethren and whatnot and if you look at
[26:05] it there are spiritual influences behind
[26:07] all these things and if you stay with
[26:10] the word you recognize you have to like
[26:12] I said keep away from bitterness keep
[26:14] from Holdings all these are doors you
[26:17] you hold ORS and become a door you know
[26:19] a door that hinders you from getting
[26:21] your prayer answer because it affect
[26:22] your faith because faith is based on say
[26:25] it out loud faith is based on
[26:27] forgiveness
[26:28] so if forgiveness is not de and you know
[26:30] you're still a Christian you're still
[26:31] talking word you're still fellowshipping
[26:33] but the faith is not dear to get your
[26:35] prayer answer so here what I want to
[26:38] share with you tonight I
[26:40] long 2 Corinthians 10 3-6 here here Paul
[26:45] for though we walk in the flesh we do
[26:48] not war after the flesh for the weapons
[26:52] of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty
[26:56] true God to the pulling down of
[26:59] strongholds and here we go verse five
[27:02] casting down
[27:04] imaginations and every High thing that
[27:08] exalted itself against the knowledge of
[27:10] God and bringing into captivity every
[27:14] thought to The Obedience of Christ now
[27:17] this is deeper
[27:19] Christianity this is not comment this is
[27:22] God saying that we in this spiritual
[27:25] warfare is not carnal weap
[27:28] and we have to bring every thought into
[27:30] captivity into Obedience of Jesus Christ
[27:33] because fooling and running doesn't just
[27:36] ups and start you
[27:38] know before somebody fall in sin or
[27:40] fornication or adultery it does just
[27:42] start it doesn't overnight thing it
[27:44] starts with a thought it starts with a
[27:47] thought and it goes down into desires
[27:49] and then lust and then it goes to the
[27:52] ACT and that is where sin makes it
[27:55] climax do you get what I'm saying now so
[27:58] things start with thought and if we
[28:00] begin to bring our thought into
[28:02] captivity to bring it in obedience to
[28:05] Christ's words then we on our way to
[28:07] tremendous Victory so it's an effort
[28:11] it's you being conscious that the word
[28:14] is saying that our weapons are are not
[28:18] caral the weapons of a Warfare have to
[28:21] do with casting down imagination it has
[28:24] to do with bringing every High thought
[28:28] everything has exalted itself into the
[28:29] knowledge of of God and bringing into
[28:32] captivity every thought to The Obedience
[28:35] of Jesus Christ get this man and having
[28:38] a
[28:39] Readiness to Revenge all
[28:43] Disobedience when your obedience is
[28:46] fulfilled now this verse six in is an
[28:49] astonishing scripture listen and having
[28:51] a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience
[28:55] when your obedience is fulfilled now
[28:58] let's go over that we amplify it a bit
[29:01] for we walk and live in the flesh for
[29:04] though we walk Live In the Flesh we are
[29:06] not carrying on our Warfare according to
[29:10] flesh and using me mere human weapons
[29:14] for the weapons of our Warfare are not
[29:16] physical weapons of flesh and blood but
[29:19] they are Mighty before God for the
[29:22] overthrow and destructions of
[29:25] strongholds in as much as as we refute
[29:28] arguments and theories and reasonings
[29:31] and every proud and lofty thing that
[29:34] sets itself up against the true
[29:36] knowledge of God and we lead every
[29:38] thought and purpose a way captive into
[29:41] Obedience of Christ the Messiah the
[29:43] anointed one here is one the last ver
[29:47] being in Readiness to punish every
[29:51] insubordinate for his
[29:53] Disobedience when your own submission
[29:58] and obedience as a church are fully
[30:01] secure and complete this is MIND buling
[30:04] in other words it's saying here that
[30:07] when the church is submissive and
[30:09] obedient to God then discipline could be
[30:13] correctly effective so in other words I
[30:16] can't be trying to discipline you and I
[30:18] am a
[30:19] slacker do you get that do you
[30:22] understand that I am trying to to and my
[30:26] my discipline is not
[30:28] do you get that now so it come like um
[30:32] you know OB say cified Pastor how the
[30:35] children will live above the
[30:37] parents so everything come right back to
[30:39] the to the home if the mother will be
[30:42] respectful if the wife will respectful
[30:45] if the wife will be respectful to the
[30:47] husband and the husband respectful to
[30:50] the wife and there's respect to the
[30:52] family then you'll get the children
[30:55] respectful when the parents are not
[30:57] respectful you get the children not
[31:00] respectful do you understand so if we
[31:03] want to get a respectful
[31:05] house change have to begin with me with
[31:11] you before you want to see change in
[31:14] others see the change in you tonight we
[31:20] wrestle not all your
[31:23] wrestle we all of us every day
[31:27] every day is a p i driving through you
[31:31] know the ARA today and it's it's sights
[31:34] to behold it's not right here and I'm
[31:36] seeing my goodness there just satanic
[31:39] influences people looking at flesh and
[31:42] blood and clothes and walking and
[31:44] whatnot now in the Christmas spirit
[31:46] looking to shop and buy and everything
[31:48] else you know what it be it's a spirit
[31:49] it's not the Holy Spirit the Christmas
[31:51] spirit let me tell you one time the
[31:52] Christmas spirit is not the holy spirit
[31:55] because if that the Holy Spirit
[31:56] everybody have it
[31:57] and we know that not true the Christmas
[31:59] spirit is a spirit is a atmosphere you
[32:02] see and people get caught up in it be
[32:05] careful the season is that atmosphere
[32:08] that they end all right so therefore
[32:10] being in Readiness to punish every in
[32:12] subordinate for his Disobedience when
[32:15] your own submission and obedience as a
[32:18] church are fully secured and
[32:21] complete now remember I told you about
[32:24] weight classes in wrestling actual
[32:25] wrestling you get to wrestling just
[32:28] want to finish quickly wrestling are
[32:30] grouped into weight classes to ensure
[32:33] fear
[32:34] competition 1 Corinthians 10:13 they had
[32:37] no temptation taking you but such as is
[32:39] comeon to man but God is faithful who
[32:42] will not suffer you to be tempted above
[32:44] that you are able but will with the
[32:46] Temptation also make a way to escape
[32:49] that you may be able to Dear it so what
[32:51] this is telling us is that those people
[32:53] in church who have excuses they are
[32:56] lying
[32:57] you cannot say this is too much you
[33:00] cannot say um this is unfair because the
[33:03] Bible God can't lie and if the Bible say
[33:06] he will not give you something more than
[33:08] you can bear he is true and he is
[33:10] faithful do you believe that tonight
[33:12] come on say Amen want to hear shouting
[33:14] in your own house all right now the
[33:16] Amplified of that for no temptation no
[33:19] trial regarded as enticing to sin no
[33:23] matter how it comes or where it leads
[33:25] has over has over taken you and laid
[33:28] hold on you that is not common to man
[33:31] that is no temptation or trial has come
[33:34] to you that is beyond human resistance
[33:38] and the Bible exorts us resist the devil
[33:40] that that is not adjusted and adapting
[33:42] and belonging to Human Experience but
[33:44] such as man can bear but God is faithful
[33:47] to his word and to his compassionate
[33:50] nature and he can be trusted not to let
[33:54] you be tempted and tried and ased
[33:57] beyond your ability and strength of
[34:00] resistance and power to endure but with
[34:03] the Temptation he will always provide
[34:06] the way out the means of escape to The
[34:09] Landing place that you may be capable
[34:12] and strong and powerful to Bear up under
[34:16] it patiently now if you receive that if
[34:20] you receive this in your spirit you
[34:23] wouldn't talk in frustration and you f
[34:26] up and you can't
[34:28] that's the devil that's the devil want
[34:30] you to get F frustrated once you get in
[34:32] that M of stressed out and you and you
[34:37] can't handle it then the devil get you
[34:39] there get you in a mood you can't get
[34:41] this Mind Of God you can't get the
[34:44] sensitivity of God and you crash now if
[34:48] when whatever you're confronting you
[34:51] start to begin to look what is the way
[34:53] God have as a landing place that I could
[34:57] be positioned to manage what is
[35:01] happening to me they come like they come
[35:04] like somebody not doing well and you
[35:08] know in terms of Finance call it
[35:09] survival mode they can't study planning
[35:12] for next five years or 10 years they
[35:15] want bread today they want bread
[35:16] tomorrow they want bread next day they
[35:19] not studying a week a month a year
[35:21] because they in Survival Mode God don't
[35:24] want you in that kind of w God want you
[35:26] to vision and purpose God want you to
[35:29] have a picture that because you are not
[35:31] transformed overnight thing takes time
[35:34] transformation takes God want you to
[35:36] know that that he who began a good work
[35:38] in you is able to complete it but if the
[35:40] devil could frustrate it you may even
[35:42] forget the work he started in you and
[35:45] God is the one who started the work in
[35:47] you you call yourself you didn't bring
[35:50] yourself to the Lord God call you and
[35:52] yet you condemn yourself you wipe out
[35:55] yourself and you try to give up
[35:57] sometimes and the devil saying yeah give
[35:58] up let go go leave yeah give up and
[36:01] devil trying to promp you and sings
[36:03] singing some some Christmas HS to you
[36:05] then right in a kind of Christmasy way
[36:07] to encourage you to leave the people out
[36:09] in the world frustrated they fed up they
[36:10] can't handle what they're handling they
[36:12] just drinking they just smoking they
[36:14] just weeding and cooking and everything
[36:15] else to manage their issues and here we
[36:18] as Christians knowing there's an
[36:19] intelligence and that we have been
[36:21] elected and selected before the
[36:23] foundation of the world for this battle
[36:25] come on Saints you can make it you're
[36:27] sold of the Cross you could handle it I
[36:29] know it's difficult I know it's
[36:30] challenging but it will be glorious
[36:32] because this is the age that God going
[36:34] to show for his hand and show what his
[36:35] power and show for his glory and and the
[36:37] Bible said it so sweetly I reckon that
[36:39] the prevent sufferings of this world is
[36:41] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[36:43] that shall be revealed where in US in US
[36:46] that's all we have to see all right let
[36:47] me see I wrap up
[36:48] here my God this is something else to
[36:52] wrestle is to take part in a fight
[36:54] either as a sport or in earnest that
[36:57] involves grappling and of one's opponent
[36:59] and trowing to to to and trying to throw
[37:02] or force him to the ground wrestle is
[37:04] also struggling with a difficulty or a
[37:07] problem you could wrestle with issues
[37:09] wrestle in your mind wrestle in problem
[37:12] but we still wrestle and Jacob had to
[37:14] wrestle with that angel so it wasn't
[37:15] easy for Jacob to know it wasn't boxing
[37:17] you know it's wrestling wrestling is
[37:18] holding Letting Go slipping through
[37:20] getting back his foot and when when you
[37:22] think he get away hold your hand and
[37:24] roll you over and whatnot that is what
[37:26] wrest is about so it's not like it's a
[37:28] distant opponent it's a near opponent
[37:32] he's right there and you're wrestling
[37:34] with it you're wrestling with your
[37:35] thoughts you're wrestling what to do how
[37:37] to do it all right so therefore
[37:41] condition for success I have here Joshua
[37:43] one God telling be strong of good
[37:45] courage unto this people shall all
[37:47] inheritance only they were strong and
[37:49] very courageous here the condition that
[37:51] thou May observe to do watch all the law
[37:57] which Moses my servant commanded thee
[37:59] turn not him the right hand and to the
[38:01] left that thouest Prosper whatsoever
[38:03] thou goest this book of the Lord shall
[38:06] shall not depend from thee day and night
[38:08] and then sh th shall have good success
[38:09] so he was showing that meditation on the
[38:11] word and yielding to obedience to God
[38:13] brings that full success and give me a
[38:15] preacher I'm almost done give me a
[38:18] preacher give me a Christian give me a
[38:19] housewife that's a Christian give me a
[38:22] farmer or a factory worker that will put
[38:25] God first in everything and I show you a
[38:27] man that will be successful in spite of
[38:29] all the devil can put before him he
[38:31] seeks God first in closing I want to
