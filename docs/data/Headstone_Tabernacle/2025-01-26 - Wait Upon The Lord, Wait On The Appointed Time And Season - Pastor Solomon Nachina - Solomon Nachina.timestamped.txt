[46:35] consulted with the captains of of
[46:38] thousands of hundreds and with every
[46:47] leader and David said unto all the
[46:50] congregation of
[46:53] Israel if it seemed good unto you
[46:57] and that it be of the Lord Our
[47:01] God let us send abroad onto our Brethren
[47:08] everywhere that are left in all the land
[47:10] of
[47:12] Israel and with them also to the priests
[47:16] and the Levites which are in their
[47:18] cities and
[47:23] suburbs that they may gather themselves
[47:25] unto us
[47:27] and let us bring again the AR of the of
[47:29] our God to
[47:35] us for for we inquired not at it in the
[47:39] days of
[47:42] Saul and the congregation said that they
[47:45] would do
[47:48] so so the thing was right in the eyes of
[47:51] all the
[47:55] people and David gathered all the Israel
[47:58] all Israel
[48:01] together from shho of Egypt onto onto
[48:05] the entring of hmer to bring the Ark of
[48:08] the Lord of God from Ker
[48:13] [Music]
[48:33] and David went up and all
[48:36] Israel to Bala that
[48:42] is which belong to
[48:45] Judah to bring up then the Ark of the of
[48:48] God the
[48:51] Lord that dwelleth between the cherubims
[48:54] whose names is called on it
[48:59] and they Carri the Ark of God in a new
[49:02] cat out of the house of
[49:09] [Music]
[49:12] ab out of the house of
[49:18] Abad and us and
[49:21] hoseah dve the
[49:25] cat and they David and all Israel played
[49:28] before God with all their
[49:35] might played played
[49:38] played before God with all their might
[49:41] and with singing and with harp and with
[49:45] salry and with timbrell and with symbols
[49:48] and with trumpets
[49:56] when they came onto the threshing floor
[49:59] of chidon usza put forth his hand to
[50:02] hold the ark for The Oxen
[50:10] stumbled and the Lord's anger was
[50:12] kindled against us and he smoked him
[50:15] because he put his hand to the
[50:21] ark and there he died before
[50:23] God and David was displeased
[50:29] David was
[50:34] displeased because the Lord had made a
[50:37] bridge upon usza wherefore that place is
[50:40] called
[50:43] perusu to this
[50:53] day and David was afraid of God that day
[50:58] saying how shall I bring the Ark of God
[51:01] home
[51:02] [Music]
[51:05] alone so David brought not the ark home
[51:09] to himself to the city of David but
[51:11] carried it aside to the house of
[51:15] OB
[51:22] the and the act of God remain with the
[51:25] family of obom in the house three months
[51:28] and the Lord blessed the house of
[51:30] obededom and all that he
[51:44] had amen amen Mark chapter
[51:51] 7 verse 5-7
[51:57] then the Pharisees and the scribes asked
[51:59] [Music]
[52:02] him why walk not thy disciples according
[52:05] to the tradition of the
[52:11] elders but eat bread with un unwashed
[52:17] hands and he answered and said unto them
[52:21] well has Elias prophesied of you
[52:24] hypocrites
[52:29] as it is
[52:31] written thou the these people honored me
[52:34] with their
[52:37] lips but their heart is far from
[52:41] me how B in vain do they worship
[52:45] me teaching for
[52:47] doctrines the Commandments of
[52:51] men praise the Lord and our last one is
[52:56] Isaiah
[53:00] 40 verse
[53:02] 30-31 even the youth shall faint and be
[53:08] weary and the young men shall utterly
[53:12] fall but they that wait upon the Lord
[53:16] shall renew their
[53:19] strength they shall Mount up with wings
[53:21] as
[53:23] eagles they shall run and not be weary
[53:27] they shall walk and not
[53:29] faint may the Lord add a
[53:32] blessing to the of his word shall we
[53:35] pray father we thank you for the reading
[53:37] of your word we pray you send your
[53:39] anointing upon it father take us out of
[53:41] the way and speak to your people this
[53:43] morning in Jesus name we pray amen amen

[53:53] place to be than the house of the Lord
[53:57] amen amen as you may be seated you
[54:01] welcome one and all so there's no better
[54:03] place to
[54:05] be than the house of the Lord there's
[54:08] not a time to be
[54:10] alive than this
[54:13] time is the closing of the world's
[54:19] history usering in of the
[54:22] [Applause]
[54:25] Resurrection be a believer in this
[54:28] hour is a blessed time is a blessed
[54:33] thing we are a privileged
[54:36] people to live to see the coming of the
[54:39] Lord to see the outpouring of the Holy
[54:43] Spirit back in the church again to see
[54:46] God tabernacl in the
[54:49] people that God can take on
[54:51] flesh and lead the
[54:54] people to his glory
[54:56] there's no better place no better time
[55:00] to leave than in this
[55:02] time and I'm so glad that he brought me
[55:06] in this hour I am so glad that he
[55:09] brought me to leave and be a witness in
[55:12] this
[55:13] hour when all things are
[55:16] failing when demon powers are out on
[55:21] release but God chose me to be his right
[55:24] he chose me to be a witness
[55:27] he predestinated me in this hour to
[55:30] overcome this
[55:32] principali overcome these powers that I
[55:36] will be a witness to his
[55:38] glory praise God hallelujah you may be
[55:42] seated so for a title
[55:45] today wait upon the Lord
[55:50] amen wait on the appointed time and
[55:53] season
[55:58] so wait upon the
[56:00] Lord wait on the appointed time and
[56:05] season because every
[56:07] promise is going to come to pass but
[56:11] it's not going to come to pass according
[56:13] to your
[56:15] expectation is going to come to pass in
[56:18] his time in his season and last
[56:23] week the Lord brought us to a place
[56:27] the foundation of our
[56:29] faith to let us know that amen our faith
[56:33] is hinged on Revelation
[56:35] amen so he he told the
[56:38] disciples who do who do men say that I
[56:42] am amen and they were eager to say what
[56:46] others said about
[56:48] Jesus but it had to be revealed to
[56:52] you so Jesus turned around and ask
[56:55] them who do you say that I
[56:57] [Music]
[56:58] am and there was silence in the
[57:01] church so Peter rose up and said in
[57:05] Matthew
[57:07] 16:8 thou are the Christ the son of the
[57:11] Living God and in Matthew 16:18 Jesus
[57:15] said thou are also Peter amen I am but
[57:19] you also Peter and Upon This Rock I will
[57:23] build my church and the gates of
[57:27] will not Prevail against you may be
[57:29] seated so God as a church make no
[57:33] mistake about it God has a church God
[57:37] has a church that he will build himself
[57:40] and that church will be built on
[57:43] Revelation revelation of his word and
[57:46] revelation of who the church knows his
[57:49] word so who do you say that I am
[57:53] today oh you may be see it Hallelujah
[57:56] God is going to build his
[57:57] church amen and the Gates of Hell will
[58:01] try the Gates of Hell will come against
[58:03] that
[58:04] church but thank God Jesus said the Gate
[58:08] of Hell will not
[58:10] Prevail and so it is time that the
[58:13] church know who she is and who is the
[58:17] church they called out the
[58:20] separated the elected The Chosen praise
[58:25] God Called to his name
[58:27] how are you called before the
[58:29] foundations of the world he put your
[58:31] name there that you would come out today
[58:35] and receive the word and believe the
[58:37] word but the word has got to be
[58:41] manifested Oh Glory so God is looking
[58:44] for a people that will manifest that
[58:47] word praise God so we're going to take a
[58:51] lesson this
[58:52] morning you may be seated amen amen wait
[58:57] on the
[58:58] Lord wait on the appointed time and
[59:04] season praise the Lord hallelujah now
[59:07] God's church is built on
[59:11] Revelation and so the time of belonging
[59:13] to church is
[59:16] over the time of just coming to church
[59:19] is
[59:20] over because the
[59:22] pyramid is narrowing
[59:26] it's going to come to that needle
[59:28] point love must be in your
[59:32] heart oh because he first loved me he
[59:36] put me here that I could also love him
[59:39] back and who is he he is the word
[59:43] today so every
[59:45] question has his
[59:48] answer in the word every
[59:52] Behavior has it
[59:55] manifestation in the word every
[59:58] expectation has his
[1:00:01] manifestation in that word praise go and
[1:00:04] that word has got a time has got a
[1:00:08] season that it must be
[1:00:11] manifested so you know David is a very
[1:00:14] special
[1:00:16] man praise the Lord you may be see amen
[1:00:19] David David was a man after God's Own
[1:00:23] Heart David was a friend of God
[1:00:27] God loved David so
[1:00:28] much but David was also another careless
[1:00:33] leader he could follow after his
[1:00:39] passions he had so much desire to do
[1:00:42] good to the
[1:00:45] Lord to Avail himself in service for
[1:00:49] God and in that
[1:00:54] overzealousness David made some
[1:00:57] mistakes praise God but God's word is
[1:01:00] God's
[1:01:01] word and God doesn't change his
[1:01:04] mind about his word when he says what he
[1:01:09] says when he says it make sure it
[1:01:13] carries it to the
[1:01:16] letter God you may be seated so here was
[1:01:20] David trying to bring the Ark of the
[1:01:24] Lord that was taken out of
[1:01:27] Israel and David said when Saul was
[1:01:31] King we didn't make the effort to bring
[1:01:34] it
[1:01:36] back Saul just left it
[1:01:39] there in a foreign
[1:01:41] land but as for me we must
[1:01:45] inquire we must restore
[1:01:48] back back to is rightful
[1:01:51] place David had the right
[1:01:54] motive he had the right
[1:01:57] objective but his approach to it was
[1:02:01] wrong praise God because
[1:02:05] God had a right
[1:02:08] person that David needed to inquire
[1:02:12] from but the bible say that David he
[1:02:16] consulted with the captains of T of
[1:02:19] thousands of
[1:02:23] hundreds so he contacted
[1:02:29] military because his idea was if we go
[1:02:33] for that
[1:02:34] act there's going to be there's going to
[1:02:36] be a
[1:02:39] resistance and the only people that will
[1:02:42] fight will be the Mighty Men of
[1:02:45] Al so let's take some thousands of
[1:02:48] hundreds of military
[1:02:51] men once the military agree with
[1:02:54] me we will have the victory that was
[1:02:58] man's
[1:02:59] thinking praise God then he contacted
[1:03:02] with every leader of
[1:03:05] Israel and then after he had contacted
[1:03:07] these people he brought it to the
[1:03:11] congregation and said that if it be of
[1:03:14] the Lord Our
[1:03:17] God let us also send that information to
[1:03:20] all our Brethren
[1:03:23] abroad and so they did that and they
[1:03:27] went ahead and they brought the AR but
[1:03:31] they fail to
[1:03:34] contact the prophet of the
[1:03:36] land because naan was
[1:03:39] alive naan was
[1:03:43] God's naan was God's
[1:03:46] voice but David left naan out of
[1:03:50] it and relied on
[1:03:52] M praise God hallelujah hallelujah
[1:03:56] so his motive was
[1:03:59] right SE that his objective was
[1:04:02] right but God wasn't looking to David's
[1:04:07] objective David's objective had to come
[1:04:09] in line with his
[1:04:12] word but David couldn't wait amen and
[1:04:17] went his way and we saw the
[1:04:21] Calamity praise God that
[1:04:24] fell but they carried it number
[1:04:28] one They carried it in the wrong
[1:04:31] place They Carried the AR of the
[1:04:34] Lord on the wrong
[1:04:38] pedestral it was supposed to be carried
[1:04:40] on the shoulders of the
[1:04:43] Levi they Carri it praise God on a
[1:04:48] cat they made a new cat for
[1:04:52] it they made a modern cat for it
[1:04:57] praise God and God was not pleased with
[1:05:00] that so the prophet said here in trying
[1:05:04] to do God a
[1:05:07] service without in being his
[1:05:10] will he said now
[1:05:12] notice there in following God this to
[1:05:17] all of us now in following
[1:05:21] God now I want to kind of Jud this in
[1:05:24] your mind
[1:05:28] we must keep this in our
[1:05:30] mind in trying to follow
[1:05:33] God Amen to keep God's
[1:05:38] Commandments to do anything right for
[1:05:41] God to do a service
[1:05:46] correctly to do God a service
[1:05:50] correctly are you get me now you want to
[1:05:53] worship
[1:05:54] God worship Him
[1:05:57] correctly you want to believe the word
[1:06:00] you got to believe it
[1:06:02] correctly you got to live the life you
[1:06:05] got to live it
[1:06:07] correctly to do Serv to do God service
[1:06:12] correctly there is five
[1:06:17] musts to do God service
[1:06:22] correctly so go in looking at your
[1:06:24] motive
[1:06:26] go a looking at your
[1:06:28] objective go a looking at your the
[1:06:31] reason why you do what you
[1:06:34] do but it must follow these five
[1:06:40] must so the now David was doing God a
[1:06:46] service he was doing everything he know
[1:06:48] to
[1:06:50] do except living of God
[1:06:58] so everything David did was
[1:07:00] right but he left God out of the
[1:07:03] picture and a lot of us we are crying
[1:07:06] for
[1:07:07] Revival we are crying for
[1:07:10] Dynamics we are crying for a
[1:07:12] breakthrough in the
[1:07:15] spirit but we are leaving God out of it
[1:07:19] all like David made the mistake here see
[1:07:24] he was doing something something
[1:07:27] right something good for the
[1:07:29] people something good for the
[1:07:32] church but there is five
[1:07:36] masks I want you to remember
[1:07:39] these no matter how sincere A man may
[1:07:44] be in doing it doing a doing God a
[1:07:51] service this these five months must be
[1:07:55] there
[1:07:59] the first it must be his time to do
[1:08:06] it so you got to find the time of
[1:08:09] God to do whatever you want to do for
[1:08:13] [Music]
[1:08:15] God oh are you with me this morning amen
[1:08:18] it's going to be in his
[1:08:20] time doing a service for God you are
[1:08:24] waiting for the promise
[1:08:26] wait on God but you must wait on his
[1:08:29] time and wait on his season you must
[1:08:34] wait on God on his time to do
[1:08:39] it so you are praying you must wait on
[1:08:43] the Lord don't take a
[1:08:46] shortcut wait on God on his time it must
[1:08:50] be on God's time it must be on God's
[1:08:54] season it must be his will at his time
[1:08:59] Abraham had to wait 25 years after the
[1:09:04] promise but had to come at God's time at
[1:09:08] God's season is a must do a
[1:09:12] service God tried
[1:09:14] Abraham in that period God tried Abraham
[1:09:19] but Abraham had to wait Abraham had to
[1:09:22] endure Abraham had to believe Abraham
[1:09:25] had to hold on until it was God's time
[1:09:29] don't be in a hurry don't be in a hurry
[1:09:33] wait for God's time because his promise
[1:09:35] is sure once you wait upon Him He will
[1:09:40] bring it to pass in his own time oh you
[1:09:44] may be
[1:09:45] seated amen first it must be his time to
[1:09:49] do
[1:09:50] [Music]
[1:09:51] it you can't do it in your own time
[1:09:55] so to
[1:09:56] everything there's a time and a
[1:09:59] season and we must wait on God's time we
[1:10:03] must wait on God's season I prayed and I
[1:10:06] prayed and I prayed and it's not
[1:10:09] happening well God promised God promised
[1:10:13] that when you ask you will
[1:10:16] [Applause]
[1:10:18] receive praise God so I am waiting
[1:10:22] because I know I have asked of him and
[1:10:26] he's faithful to his
[1:10:28] word he is going to answer me at the
[1:10:32] right time it must be in his time it it
[1:10:37] can't be in your
[1:10:39] time glory to God hallelujah hallelujah
[1:10:44] it must be his time to do
[1:10:47] it so when God told Noah you may be see
[1:10:51] amen God told Noah it's going to rain
[1:10:55] the ask Noah how to get a
[1:10:58] revelation that this voice that he has
[1:11:01] heard it will not fail because it's
[1:11:04] God's voice it didn't matter the
[1:11:07] circumstances it didn't matter the
[1:11:09] technology of the
[1:11:11] Season it didn't matter who was saying
[1:11:15] what Noah believed the
[1:11:18] word and Noah went on to obey the
[1:11:23] voice and Noah buil the ey
[1:11:26] my
[1:11:27] Revelation Upon This Rock I will build
[1:11:30] my
[1:11:31] church
[1:11:34] Hallelujah it didn't sound like rain was
[1:11:38] coming but God said so in his own time
[1:11:43] the rain will come but Noah had to make
[1:11:47] ready for the
[1:11:50] [Applause]
[1:11:52] rain Oh Glory to God
[1:11:55] God Amen so Noah made ready for the
[1:12:00] rain he built the ark may be seated and
[1:12:05] then after he built the ark he had to
[1:12:08] preach for 120
[1:12:11] years God has
[1:12:13] spoken Noah called a
[1:12:15] revelation and he stood on that
[1:12:17] Revelation he wasn't revealed to the
[1:12:20] family it wasn't revealed to the whole
[1:12:23] nation it was revealed to Noah the
[1:12:27] individual but being a prophet of the
[1:12:31] age he had to bring the word for that
[1:12:34] age it is going to
[1:12:36] rain God has made
[1:12:39] preparation he's made a
[1:12:41] preparation by way of the
[1:12:44] ark that it is going to rain run into
[1:12:47] the
[1:12:48] ark but they doubted it they didn't
[1:12:52] believe it they made fun of Noah
[1:12:55] they disbelieve Noah they disobeyed Noah
[1:12:59] but God had an appointed
[1:13:02] time because Noah was doing a
[1:13:05] service for God he wasn't doing it out
[1:13:09] of his will he was doing service in the
[1:13:12] will of God so God had to B no
[1:13:21] up when you do God's will
[1:13:25] no matter the
[1:13:26] opposition no matter the trial no matter
[1:13:30] the storms no matter what the devil
[1:13:32] brings your way God is going to back it
[1:13:35] up because you are right in the will of
[1:13:38] God wait on that promise don't ever
[1:13:42] shiver God has spoken it stay on that
[1:13:47] word in his own time he will bring it to
[1:13:51] pass you may be seated

[1:13:59] time when all the
[1:14:03] scoffers all the
[1:14:05] mockers all the church
[1:14:07] members all the
[1:14:10] unbelievers refused to
[1:14:15] obey God after 120
[1:14:20] years told Noah by
[1:14:23] Revelation go get the into the Act 2 by
[1:14:26] [Music]
[1:14:28] two and Noah was getting the animals
[1:14:31] in can you
[1:14:34] imagine it was only in in the Garden of
[1:14:39] Eden that we
[1:14:41] know that Adam could
[1:14:44] speak to the animals and they obey him
[1:14:48] he was only the gun of Eden that The
[1:14:51] Lion and the lamb could lay together
[1:14:56] and here was God telling Noah get the
[1:14:59] animal 2 by

[1:15:07] there the tiger was there the lopers
[1:15:10] were there the Lambs were there the
[1:15:13] goats were there the dogs were there the
[1:15:15] rabbits were there every animal today
[1:15:19] was
[1:15:20] there God had to preserve life in his
[1:15:23] own time he brought back
[1:15:27] power on
[1:15:29] Dominion was in the grips of
[1:15:33] Noah and when Noah spoke the animals
[1:15:36] obeyed him because Noah was doing a
[1:15:41] service after God's Own
[1:15:45] [Applause]
[1:15:47] will With God all things are
[1:15:52] possible so don't care about what the
[1:15:54] scientist is
[1:15:56] saying don't care about what human
[1:15:58] reasoning is

[1:16:31] in and all of a sudden they were
[1:16:34] laughing at Noah oh Noah all your
[1:16:37] converts are animals you couldn't even

[1:23:28] the
[1:23:30] word no doubt you have heard a
[1:23:35] voice no doubt you have heard a voice
[1:23:38] but that is not the voice of God how do
[1:23:42] we know is not the voice of God we
[1:23:44] compare it with the word if it doesn't t
[1:23:48] with that word forget about it praise
[1:23:52] God David never heard from God David
[1:23:57] went by his own idea he went by his own
[1:24:01] intellect if David had heard from God
[1:24:04] the prophet Nathan would have told David
[1:24:07] it is time to bring back the Ark of
[1:24:12] God but David went according to his own
[1:24:16] thinking went according to his own
[1:24:18] passion and
[1:24:21] desires which was good his motive was
[1:24:25] right his objective was good to restore
[1:24:28] the Ark of God back to
[1:24:31] Israel it was a good thing but you've
[1:24:34] got to wait on God to be led by God to
[1:24:38] be moved by God You' got to wait on God
[1:24:42] oh glory to

[1:25:06] time his
[1:25:12] word r said it must
[1:25:17] be
[1:25:20] given so it must be
[1:25:22] given not just wake up and do anything
[1:25:26] you
[1:25:29] want God look Heaven is very
[1:25:35] orderly everything is playing according
[1:25:38] to his
[1:25:42] purpose the sun can just get excited and
[1:25:44] say today I want to visit the Earth I'm
[1:25:46] coming down lower than I'm supposed to
[1:25:48] be
[1:25:54] there's a
[1:25:59] Time the feather he goes from the
[1:26:03] earth the cooler the
[1:26:08] becomes you wake up and you are looking
[1:26:10] for pullover and blanket the sun is gone
[1:26:13] further away from the
[1:26:20] earth the closer it gets to the Earth
[1:26:26] get and the heat weather is to hot and
[1:26:29] we drinking
[1:26:32] water everything has a time and a
[1:26:38] season so has God's word go a time in
[1:26:40] the
[1:26:42] season there's a time we are
[1:26:45] children but the time has come once I
[1:26:49] was a
[1:26:50] child I as a child that was a time and
[1:26:54] the
[1:26:55] season but now I put away now we put
[1:27:00] away we put away childish things now we
[1:27:04] are moving to Perfection now we are
[1:27:06] moving to the Deep things of
[1:27:10] God time and
[1:27:12] [Applause]
[1:27:16] season number three you may be see that
[1:27:19] it must be given according
[1:27:24] to the person he has chosen to do it by
[1:27:29] [Music]
[1:27:32] amen so God has chosen all of us for a
[1:27:37] purpose for a purpose and he is to do
[1:27:40] his
[1:27:42] will and we are to do his
[1:27:45] service according to that
[1:27:48] will so we can't do it outside of his
[1:27:52] purpose and we cannot do outside of his
[1:27:56] will are you now is got to it must be
[1:28:01] given according to the
[1:28:05] person he has chosen to do it by so
[1:28:09] David had to wait on the prophet
[1:28:13] naan not according to his own
[1:28:16] thinking because God's voice for that
[1:28:19] day was the prophet
[1:28:22] Nathan amen didn't rely on the captains
[1:28:25] of the
[1:28:27] army he wasn't on the leaders of
[1:28:31] Israel it wasn't on the people it was on
[1:28:35] the prophet so David had to hear from
[1:28:38] the
[1:28:39] prophet David had that
[1:28:41] desire he needed to consult the
[1:28:45] prophet and he
[1:28:47] rejected the person God was to do it by
[1:28:51] and went by the army
[1:28:54] and David
[1:28:56] failed he couldn't bring it back he had
[1:28:59] to keep it in the
[1:29:01] house
[1:29:03] ofad praise God hallelujah so God has
[1:29:08] got his way that is why we must be
[1:29:11] careful it's got to be according to his
[1:29:13] word according to his time according to
[1:29:16] the person he has chosen by to do that
[1:29:21] will amen that is why
[1:29:24] said that is why the church has failed
[1:29:28] that is why ministers are failed that is
[1:29:31] why ministers are failing because they
[1:29:33] didn't go into it
[1:29:35] right that is why we have a scrubed heap
[1:29:38] of
[1:29:45] [Applause]
[1:29:49] ministers but there's going to be a
[1:29:51] Revival amen because God has got a
[1:29:54] people that he has chosen to do this
[1:29:58] revival
[1:29:59] by they will be loyal to the word they
[1:30:03] will be loyal to
[1:30:06] God and they will be loyal to his word
[1:30:10] they will stay true to God and they will
[1:30:13] bring the word
[1:30:16] unadulterated to the people and the word
[1:30:20] will produce the bride that word will
[1:30:23] produce a
[1:30:27] it's going to be a
[1:30:29] bride God has got a
[1:30:31] people so doing go a
[1:30:34] service it must be according to his
[1:30:41] will you may see that that's why the
[1:30:43] prophet said there's churches
[1:30:46] churches there
[1:30:49] Pride but he came back and told
[1:30:52] him praise
[1:30:55] Amen in Mark
[1:30:58] 57 I mean Mark
[1:31:00] 75 said thees and the scribes ask
[1:31:04] him why work not thy disciples according
[1:31:07] to the traditions of the
[1:31:12] elders no the God's church is not built
[1:31:14] on tradition of the elders
[1:31:25] it is built on his
[1:31:27] word it is built on Revelation of his
[1:31:31] word hallelujah he answered and said
[1:31:34] unto them well has Elias prophesied of
[1:31:37] you
[1:31:39] hypocrit Hypocrites as it is written
[1:31:43] these people honored me with their
[1:31:47] lips but their heart is far from
[1:31:51] me how beit in vain do they worship
[1:31:55] me so we are not here for vain
[1:31:59] worship no we are here to do the will of
[1:32:02] God it must be in his time it must be in
[1:32:06] his season it must be by his word it
[1:32:09] must be by the person he has chosen to
[1:32:12] do it by he going to be a bride the
[1:32:16] Revival doesn't come by the preacher the
[1:32:18] Revival come by the people it must be by
[1:32:21] the person he has chosen to do
[1:32:26] it
[1:32:29] Hallelujah so it is time the preachers
[1:32:32] will get out of the way and allow the
[1:32:35] Holy Spirit to flow through the people
[1:32:38] to bring forth that seventh under
[1:32:40] Revival so we should stop binding the
[1:32:43] people stop binding the people to
[1:32:46] ourselves no man has a right to find the
[1:32:51] people to a che tradition no man has a
[1:32:55] right to bind the people to a change
[1:32:58] Doctrine God reveals himself to his
[1:33:02] people and upon that rock I will build
[1:33:05] my
[1:33:11] church
[1:33:13] amen it's going to be by the
[1:33:17] word watch how these false
[1:33:22] ones they bind the people to themselves
[1:33:25] by
[1:33:29] fear remember is going to be by the
[1:33:32] word and we are bringing the word to let
[1:33:35] you know that not all Israel is
[1:33:39] Israel not all churches are
[1:33:42] churches not all bride is bride there's
[1:33:46] got to be a bride in his time in his
[1:33:49] season according to his word by the
[1:33:53] person he
[1:33:56] and those people chosen will point the
[1:33:59] people to the
[1:34:02] word because is by one Spirit by one
[1:34:07] Spirit by one Faith by one Doctrine by
[1:34:11] One Love by one father we are all
[1:34:15] baptized into one body there is no
[1:34:18] division in the body of Christ
[1:34:24] [Applause]
[1:34:30] in vain do they worship
[1:34:34] me you may be
[1:34:38] seated praise God
[1:34:42] hallelujah so the prophet
[1:34:45] said so we've got three now right must
[1:34:48] be in his time and in his
[1:34:51] season must be according to his word
[1:34:54] spoken must be given according to the
[1:34:56] person he has chosen to do it
[1:35:01] by said I don't care how my
[1:35:06] dignitaries there is King
[1:35:08] David just as great as any of
[1:35:12] them he was King over the
[1:35:15] nation but he had a way of doing
[1:35:19] it and he had told them how he would do
[1:35:22] it
[1:35:23] but they failed to do
[1:35:26] it it must be according to his
[1:35:29] word according to his
[1:35:31] time the the the fourth one according to
[1:35:35] his
[1:35:39] program you get it now amen it must be
[1:35:42] according to what his
[1:35:46] program so God told
[1:35:51] Moses go to Egypt
[1:35:54] and get the
[1:35:55] people
[1:35:57] out because I'm going to send you as a
[1:36:02] deliverer God had to roll out a program
[1:36:04] for
[1:36:09] Moses Moses didn't say yes I'm going
[1:36:13] now because I already tried it and
[1:36:18] failed but now that I've heard the
[1:36:21] voice I'm going No Moses said no
[1:36:26] lord I can't do
[1:36:33] it did I tell you
[1:36:35] something amen Mo said no I can't do
[1:36:40] ites looked for every excuse not to do
[1:36:47] it it's a fearful thing to lead God's
[1:36:50] people
[1:36:58] it's a frightful
[1:37:03] thing
[1:37:10] frightful to lead God's
[1:37:16] children if you truly have a
[1:37:20] heart that God has spoken to
[1:37:24] to lead his
[1:37:27] children he will run from
[1:37:34] it because that is his purchased
[1:37:40] blood Souls of men God has put in your
[1:37:47] trust and so God must roll a
[1:37:51] program for you to follow
[1:37:54] and it cannot be by your own desires and
[1:37:57] your own wishes it's going to be by
[1:37:59] God's
[1:38:03] program and you are put in a state to
[1:38:06] follow the
[1:38:09] word that word becomes your
[1:38:13] defense that word becomes your
[1:38:17] blueprint he has called The People by
[1:38:20] his
[1:38:22] word and he has appointed you by the
[1:38:25] word to roll his
[1:38:28] program to bring the people to
[1:38:30] unexpected
[1:38:34] end so if you come by the word the
[1:38:38] people come by the word you will be
[1:38:40] working in the program of
[1:38:44] God so Moses ran away said Lord I can't
[1:38:47] do it I can't speak
[1:38:52] well go said no I'll give you a
[1:38:58] sign you hold that Rod put it on the
[1:39:01] floor it to T to a serpent take it to
[1:39:06] Egypt God had a
[1:39:09] program but God didn't tell him that
[1:39:12] James and J will be
[1:39:15] there to do the same
[1:39:17] thing but that was God's
[1:39:20] program come on church amen
[1:39:24] [Applause]
[1:39:25] ah after they did that Moses took back
[1:39:28] the
[1:39:31] rod it didn't it didn't convince
[1:39:36] Pharaoh because Moses was
[1:39:40] excited Aon Aon we are going to
[1:39:44] Egypt even though I'm afraid but God say
[1:39:47] you be my spokes
[1:39:50] person and you know what God has done
[1:39:53] God has giving me something we will show
[1:39:56] this
[1:39:57] Pharaoh so Moses was
[1:40:02] excited but God was
[1:40:04] laughing said Moses Moses Moses don't
[1:40:09] get
[1:40:13] excited amen amen so when Moses got
[1:40:18] there he was hitting his Rock his staff
[1:40:22] with all the
[1:40:23] [Music]
[1:40:29] confidence God
[1:40:32] said let my people
[1:40:34] [Music]
[1:40:43] go just like
[1:40:45] that okay prove to
[1:40:49] me he threw his road on the floor
[1:41:04] saides your God is such a cheap
[1:41:12] magician can you
[1:41:15] imagine if it is
[1:41:17] you your heart to be
[1:41:23] that was God's
[1:41:25] program you see God was giving Pharaoh a
[1:41:31] bait he was baiting he was baiting
[1:41:36] Pharaoh for his heart to be more
[1:41:38] hardened for him to
[1:41:41] disbelieve for him to
[1:41:46] doubt said no problem because remember
[1:41:49] Pharaoh was the king of the Earth at the
[1:41:51] time now pharaoh
[1:41:54] but this was the king of heaven and King
[1:41:57] of the
[1:42:01] earth so he called James and
[1:42:04] jam and and when they did it I'm sure
[1:42:08] Aon looked
[1:42:15] Ates but when he swallowed up the
[1:42:22] two had more
[1:42:24] confidence he picked up his road then
[1:42:28] Moses knew this is God's program we are
[1:42:32] going to wait upon the
[1:42:34] Lord
[1:42:37] hallelujah so Pharaoh said no no no no
[1:42:40] no no no no you know
[1:42:43] what so if you watch all the plagues
[1:42:46] Moses started to call the Egyptians were
[1:42:49] doing the same
[1:42:55] see God was God was just Ling them Ling
[1:42:58] them Ling
[1:43:02] them but Moses heard from
[1:43:05] God and the Word was God came to Moses
[1:43:08] the
[1:43:09] prophet and Moses was the person that
[1:43:12] was to do
[1:43:13] it and the time was right for God to
[1:43:17] prove his
[1:43:21] word and here was the program
[1:43:27] unfolding so bece that so when the last
[1:43:30] plague of death
[1:43:35] came Pharaoh had no control over that
[1:43:40] one because Moses praise God could speak
[1:43:44] that se of the
[1:43:47] Lord why the death Angels swept over the
[1:43:50] land
[1:43:53] God has told Moses get them to apply the
[1:43:57] token apply that token when that token
[1:44:00] is there the de angel can come
[1:44:04] through Pharaoh had no
[1:44:08] Revelation he couldn't receive
[1:44:11] Revelation and it was not written
[1:44:13] anywhere for them to learn it it was
[1:44:15] God's program that every
[1:44:19] household must apply the token
[1:44:26] so the token Brought The
[1:44:30] Showdown that was part of God's
[1:44:32] program be
[1:44:35] SE I'm almost
[1:44:37] done amen so after they left Pharaoh
[1:44:42] said take your
[1:44:46] people take your children take your
[1:44:48] animal take everything leave my land
[1:44:54] [Applause]
[1:44:55] I'm sure if Pharaoh came and saw a rack
[1:44:59] Egyptian rack he I mean Hebrew R he pick
[1:45:02] it and throw it at them take your
[1:45:12] RS and they were
[1:45:15] dancing they were singing they were
[1:45:18] giving Glory we have overcome
[1:45:24] we have overcome
[1:45:27] today byebye Pharaoh bye-bye EG we have
[1:45:32] overcome
[1:45:34] to so as they were dancing and going and
[1:45:37] Pharaoh now looked back
[1:45:43] and but who will build this
[1:45:48] project we said they should go let's go
[1:45:50] and bring them back
[1:45:53] but that was God's
[1:45:58] program because the pillar of
[1:46:01] fire that was with Moses in the
[1:46:05] wilderness had to be
[1:46:07] identified with the people oh come on
[1:46:11] [Applause]
[1:46:13] church
[1:46:17] amen so they went down to the Red
[1:46:20] Sea and God didn't tell them that the
[1:46:24] Red Sea was there when they got to the
[1:46:27] Red Sea there was the Red Sea it wasn't
[1:46:30] a river it was a
[1:46:36] sea they couldn't go
[1:46:38] forward they couldn't go back but when
[1:46:42] they turned back maybe to find another
[1:46:44] way here was Pharaoh's Army
[1:46:48] coming oh but that was God's program
[1:46:53] what did Moses say they started
[1:46:55] trembling Moses say stand still wait

[1:50:24] seated I'm taking my
[1:50:27] time in the midst of
[1:50:30] that God did all those wonders in
[1:50:34] Egypt did all those wonders at the Red
[1:50:37] Sea and they knew that God truly was
[1:50:41] with
[1:50:43] [Music]
[1:50:45] Moses why he must it must be given
[1:50:49] according to the person he has chosen to
[1:50:51] do it so the knew Moses was chosen to do
[1:51:01] it so they knew they were working in the
[1:51:03] program of
[1:51:06] God which is the fourth step the four
[1:51:12] M but there was still the
[1:51:15] Wilderness to try them to prove them to
[1:51:20] vindicate them to show that they were
[1:51:23] truly
[1:51:25] [Music]
[1:51:28] [Applause]
[1:51:30] Believers so that program had just
[1:51:35] begun at the right
[1:51:37] sea Into the
[1:51:40] Wilderness and the program was a process
[1:51:45] of 40
[1:51:47] years in the
[1:51:50] wilderness but that was God's
[1:51:54] in that program God wanted to get all
[1:51:57] the old rebels out

[1:53:01] we
[1:53:02] following number two according to his
[1:53:05] word number three according to the
[1:53:09] person that he chooses to do by number
[1:53:12] four according to his
[1:53:16] program okay number
[1:53:19] fiveam says and it must be by the person
[1:53:23] he has chosen to give it by and to do
[1:53:31] it see take somebody he said Moses tried
[1:53:35] to run from
[1:53:38] it and Moses said take somebody
[1:53:41] else but God chose Moses to do it he
[1:53:45] said many of
[1:53:46] them Paul tried to get away out of it
[1:53:50] and many others but it's got to be by
[1:53:53] the person he chooses to do it
[1:53:58] by so that is why we we read The
[1:54:01] Prophet's message
[1:54:04] amen I will send you Elijah the
[1:54:10] prophet God a say no Pastor to no
[1:54:16] church you get it now God is sending his

[2:07:13] to an expected
[2:07:16] end do you think that God will bring you

[2:07:29] God so that expected end is every
[2:07:32] positive thing you can think
[2:07:37] of be

[2:07:57] us to that
[2:07:59] reality we must be buil we must be built
[2:08:02] on
[2:08:05] Revelation not on our
[2:08:09] imagination walking defeated no we can't
[2:08:12] walk

[2:08:18] up and do God a service
[2:08:22] according to his
[2:08:26] will amen
[2:08:29] amen so let's go on let's take David and
[2:08:33] close up but now God revealed the thing
[2:08:36] to them by
[2:08:40] David it was David that brought the
[2:08:42] attention of the returning the ACT to
[2:08:44] the
[2:08:47] people so God inspired David
[2:08:52] but what should have David done with
[2:08:55] that
[2:08:58] inspiration consulted the
[2:09:02] prophet there are so many voices in the
[2:09:04] land
[2:09:06] today especially from
[2:09:09] Nigeria Christian Christian Christian
[2:09:11] shouldn't pay tis
[2:09:15] anymore then some some already some
[2:09:18] Believers that don't like paying tis
[2:09:24] they grab
[2:09:26] it and this one they are not preaching
[2:09:29] this
[2:09:30] one then they grab that
[2:09:35] one
[2:09:37] [Music]
[2:09:38] inspiration whatever you
[2:09:41] read whatever you
[2:09:43] hear go back to the
[2:09:47] message check it with what the prophet
[2:09:50] said
[2:09:54] amen if the prophet is against what you
[2:09:59] heard no matter who is saying it no
[2:10:02] matter if angels came down when the
[2:10:06] person said
[2:10:07] it forget about it the prophet is the
[2:10:13] absolute but the br's
[2:10:16] message is the absolute
[2:10:23] let me say it with
[2:10:27] Clarity so that people don't
[2:10:29] misunderstand
[2:10:31] me when I say the prophet is the
[2:10:33] absolute I am not meaning William
[2:10:39] Braham I am meaning the message he
[2:10:45] preached the message is the Absolut
[2:10:53] not some
[2:10:56] theolog the message so whatever you
[2:11:00] hear check it with the
[2:11:02] message if that Prophet say so don't
[2:11:07] care who is against him it must come by
[2:11:11] the person that he has chosen to bring
[2:11:15] it back and that person must be
[2:11:19] Vindicated and the
[2:11:21] message is
[2:11:23] Vindicated is D of the
[2:11:26] Lord stay with
[2:11:28] it wait on The
[2:11:31] Lord Oh Glory to God hallelujah you may
[2:11:35] be
[2:11:36] seated said now God revealed the thing
[2:11:38] to them by
[2:11:41] David and by the
[2:11:43] ministers and by the people and by the
[2:11:46] captains of thousands and captains of
[2:11:49] hundreds and not by
[2:11:54] naan who had th serve the
[2:11:57] Lord and the
[2:11:59] Lord said he would do nothing until he
[2:12:02] showed that prophet of the
[2:12:05] age do you get
[2:12:08] it so whatever we are hoping
[2:12:12] for it must be revealed to the prophet
[2:12:15] of the
[2:12:17] age so he said wait wait till them seven
[2:12:23] tunders Al his voice to that group there
[2:12:27] is a group there is a group I said there
[2:12:31] is a group that are waiting for them
[2:12:35] seven tunders it shall alter it shall
[2:12:39] alter because the prophet said so and I
[2:12:42] am waiting no matter how long it takes I
[2:12:45] am waiting no matter how it lingers I'm
[2:12:49] going to wait for it
[2:12:53] Hallelujah Glory
[2:12:56] Hallelujah and the Lord said he would do
[2:12:58] nothing you
[2:13:00] may until he showed that prophet of the
[2:13:05] age what to
[2:13:07] do see what they did they went straight
[2:13:12] out of the word of
[2:13:16] God and put the ark upon a new cat see
[2:13:23] they went about to do
[2:13:26] it apart from God's
[2:13:30] Commandments and God's provided
[2:13:33] way that's what happened today
[2:13:36] friends that's why we've had so many
[2:13:39] great Crusades and so forth and no
[2:13:48] results no results
[2:13:51] no Holy Ghost no
[2:13:54] Deliverance
[2:13:57] why the answer is
[2:14:05] here more
[2:14:11] infidelity infidelity that is people not
[2:14:15] sincere to their marriages and
[2:14:17] relationships
[2:14:30] that's why we are so many great could
[2:14:32] say
[2:14:34] it and so forth and no
[2:14:41] results when you talk they say they say
[2:14:43] you shouldn't PR that way the message
[2:14:46] but the message is human beings that are
[2:14:47] in the message
[2:14:53] you go to conventions and young people
[2:14:55] come they're not
[2:14:58] converted there's no more message that
[2:15:00] will prick the heart of the
[2:15:03] people when the Holy Ghost fell on the
[2:15:06] day of
[2:15:07] Pentecost Peter was preaching the word
[2:15:10] to the
[2:15:11] people and the Bible say and they were
[2:15:15] prick in their
[2:15:16] hearts the Revival the messages
[2:15:22] sermons should convict people in their
[2:15:26] heart that they will want to see God
[2:15:29] they want to repent of their sins they
[2:15:31] want to turn away from their ways it
[2:15:34] must break their
[2:15:37] [Applause]
[2:15:38] [Music]
[2:15:43] hearts we've had great so many great
[2:15:46] good
[2:15:47] Saints and so forth and no
[2:15:51] [Music]
[2:15:52] results more
[2:15:59] infidelity you have conventions and
[2:16:01] young people instead of seeking
[2:16:08] God hiding in Corners to do filthy
[2:16:11] things
[2:16:13] [Music]
[2:16:16] during how can that be God
[2:16:25] in the
[2:16:31] message more infidelity more
[2:16:36] sin I tell you this nation is
[2:16:40] gone not only this nation but other
[2:16:45] nations is the spirit of the age but God
[2:16:49] must get a people
[2:16:52] God must get men God called men in shape
[2:16:56] and in
[2:16:57] place to run these Devils out of the
[2:17:00] land run these
[2:17:02] principalities out of the heart of the
[2:17:04] people because it's not the people is
[2:17:08] demon powers and they must be set free
[2:17:12] and the Holy Ghost is here in this time
[2:17:15] in his season in his program to set the
[2:17:19] people free
[2:17:22] we
[2:17:24] must get God back on the
[2:17:27] scene is said not this nation only but
[2:17:31] other nations he said this
[2:17:34] nation like England of another
[2:17:37] age has been The Prostitute of all the
[2:17:41] rest of the
[2:17:44] Nations you see that so we must stand to
[2:17:47] be Witnesses
[2:17:51] Witnesses of the power of
[2:17:54] God Witnesses of the
[2:17:57] word the lii shoulders was the original
[2:18:00] way to do
[2:18:02] [Music]
[2:18:05] it God called men to preach this
[2:18:10] word god called men to pre the word that
[2:18:16] hasn't
[2:18:17] changed the availability of books and
[2:18:20] tastes
[2:18:23] does not warrant the setting up of
[2:18:26] [Music]
[2:18:28] churches if you
[2:18:30] disagree according to the Hebrew
[2:18:33] Book says stay
[2:18:36] there and get the things straightened
[2:18:40] up you get my point now amen that's why
[2:18:43] we have all scrap heaps along the way
[2:18:47] but God has got a briide God has got
[2:18:51] will stand
[2:18:53] up today when you disagree with the
[2:18:57] pastor you break up the church and go
[2:19:00] and start your own church somewhere you
[2:19:02] disagree with this church you break up
[2:19:05] and take when the church grows to a
[2:19:08] level then you see all kind of James and
[2:19:13] J they want to break up
[2:19:16] churches and go start their own church
[2:19:19] where God has got to call you
[2:19:21] toeach that
[2:19:24] [Applause]
[2:19:28] word it's not books and
[2:19:31] tapes it is the call of God to preach
[2:19:35] the word it's a fearful thing to trade
[2:19:40] Where
[2:19:41] Angels Fear to
[2:19:45] trade the
[2:19:47] Levites was the original way God to
[2:19:51] was God's original way to do
[2:19:56] it today they put it on a new cat
[2:20:01] see today you have rich people in the
[2:20:05] church influential people in the church
[2:20:08] that God has blessed them with
[2:20:10] money they begin to they begin to Target
[2:20:13] the poor ones in the
[2:20:17] church before you know it they build an
[2:20:20] infuence around
[2:20:23] themselves before they know they feel
[2:20:25] they can preach the
[2:20:27] word before you know they feel they can
[2:20:30] put the quot and C
[2:20:31] together before they know they take part
[2:20:34] of the church
[2:20:36] out and we have so many of such churches
[2:20:38] in this
[2:20:39] ccil but God has still got God called
[2:20:43] men is not bringing the
[2:20:46] people is not packing the people to f
[2:20:50] the church but the Holy Spirit bringing
[2:20:55] his word to the people's hearts that
[2:20:58] there can be a
[2:20:59] manifestation of
[2:21:01] vindication of living
[2:21:04] [Music]
[2:21:07] [Applause]
[2:21:13] reality be seated
[2:21:17] amen and because it happens that way
[2:21:20] no room for
[2:21:23] Unity they will stand against Fellowship
[2:21:26] stand against Unity because they don't
[2:21:29] want the spirit to get through to the
[2:21:36] people new
[2:21:39] cat
[2:21:41] now it will never
[2:21:49] work remember Elijah and the B
[2:21:54] prophets when it came to the
[2:21:56] fundamentals of
[2:22:00] sacrifice they knew how to lay the
[2:22:04] altar they knew how to prepare the
[2:22:07] sacrifice they knew how to cry and call
[2:22:12] [Music]
[2:22:14] fire are you getting it now
[2:22:18] amen but fire only
[2:22:21] Comes In God's Time according to his
[2:22:25] word according to the man that he has
[2:22:28] chosen to do it
[2:22:30] by according to his program then the
[2:22:33] fire come to
[2:22:36] vindicate so the Holy Ghost is
[2:22:39] coming said it will never
[2:22:43] work they didn't consult the right
[2:22:48] way so
[2:22:51] they got
[2:22:52] out about it and went about it in the
[2:22:55] wrong way and that is what happened
[2:22:58] today when men no matter how sincere
[2:23:01] they try to do him a
[2:23:04] service outside of the provided way of
[2:23:07] revealing
[2:23:10] it they always mess it
[2:23:14] up God sets it in his own
[2:23:17] way no matter how sincere you try to do
[2:23:21] it outside of
[2:23:23] that you will mess it
[2:23:31] up God is calling us
[2:23:35] back wait on
[2:23:38] him don't
[2:23:40] run ahead of
[2:23:43] God wa on
[2:23:46] God amen amen wait on God
[2:23:51] oh and the prophet said look today at
[2:23:55] the big Crusades you wonder
[2:23:58] why I ask myself sometimes I ask myself
[2:24:01] questions why why why why why why can't
[2:24:04] we see the the outpouring of the Holy
[2:24:08] Ghost why can't we see people really
[2:24:11] come to revivals and leave the place

[2:27:30] about declaring what heaven has declared
[2:27:33] it's about declaring that se of The
[2:27:37] Lord Oh Glory to God Amen so Jehosaphat

[2:35:18] word
[2:35:21] she also fortified her right of virtue
[2:35:24] to
[2:35:28] Satan which we found in the breaking of
[2:35:30] these
[2:35:34] seals that that was
[2:35:36] Satan and still is Satan
[2:35:41] there in the church am that is why we
[2:35:44] are bring we preach
[2:35:48] sanctification that's why we pre
[2:35:50] Holiness is not is not it's not an old
[2:35:53] aake
[2:35:55] gospel because without
[2:35:57] Holiness no man can see
[2:36:00] God God a telling you are born in sin
[2:36:03] shaped in
[2:36:05] iniquity so by your birth alone you are
[2:36:08] already not in
[2:36:10] it but he has given you the word and
[2:36:14] that word gives you his program how to
[2:36:17] live holy how to live righteous how to
[2:36:21] stay faithful how to stay a
[2:36:24] witness it's not by yourself
[2:36:28] righteousness is by the word you are
[2:36:31] made clean by the washing of the water
[2:36:34] of the
[2:36:36] word you get it now amen amen amen so
[2:36:40] what what what made it the breaking of
[2:36:42] the
[2:36:44] seals prove that s it was Satan and
[2:36:47] still is Satan
[2:36:50] the Bible said that it is the very seat
[2:36:52] of
[2:36:53] Satan May SE and as he fortified her
[2:36:56] virtuous
[2:36:59] right and give them over to Satan in the
[2:37:02] Garden of Eden the church the bride of
[2:37:06] Christ did the same thing at
[2:37:09] Rome when they forfeited the
[2:37:14] Bible for their dogma and
[2:37:17] reasoning so how it t
[2:37:20] Tes you just run the types you are bound
[2:37:23] to come out
[2:37:27] right are you getting it now she
[2:37:30] forfeited her virous
[2:37:34] word the word of God when she sold the
[2:37:39] Bible and put a man there and says the
[2:37:43] church has right to change anything they
[2:37:45] want to change
[2:37:49] and they've done it and the bride of
[2:37:52] Christ the Pentecostal bride sold out
[2:37:55] her
[2:37:56] virtue at
[2:37:58] n and as if to Satan in the
[2:38:03] garden in the Garden of Eden
[2:38:06] exactly then the prophet goes so God has
[2:38:09] promised this
[2:38:11] church this Pentecostal Church knowing
[2:38:14] that she would do it like he did Eve God
[2:38:19] has promis the Pentecostal
[2:38:22] Church said do you believe that she has
[2:38:25] sold her birth
[2:38:27] rights she saw her bir
[2:38:29] before her vir when she left over
[2:38:33] there do you believe that then what good
[2:38:37] is a Creed not based on this
[2:38:45] Bible the prophet goes on so they sold
[2:38:48] out their B
[2:38:51] right not only the Methodist is said not
[2:38:55] only that Methodist Baptist Presby
[2:38:57] Pentecostals and the rest of
[2:39:00] them have sold their
[2:39:02] birth formed a
[2:39:05] denomination Rome what made her do that
[2:39:09] she formed a
[2:39:11] denomination and put man at the head of
[2:39:14] it no matter what God says you've got to
[2:39:18] do it the way they
[2:39:20] say do you get it now and they come no
[2:39:23] matter what no matter what God
[2:39:28] says amen amen no matter what God
[2:39:32] says you got to do it the way they
[2:39:37] say well what is it it is nothing in the
[2:39:41] world but spiritual
[2:39:47] prostitution so we going to stay with
[2:39:49] the
[2:39:50] prophets know what anybody
[2:39:54] says what I say not my interpretation of
[2:39:58] what the prophet
[2:40:02] means prophet's English is so
[2:40:06] basic that every primary child can
[2:40:11] understand so it needs no
[2:40:14] interpretation we got to stay what with
[2:40:16] that Prophet say
[2:40:19] oh no matter what God says you've got to
[2:40:22] do the way they say do
[2:40:24] it well what is it it is nothing in the
[2:40:27] world by spiritual
[2:40:30] prostitution the wrong type of a
[2:40:34] woman yes sir Creeds Ling
[2:40:39] Creeds manmade
[2:40:42] Creeds uh seven tunders is not the seven
[2:40:45] tunders they
[2:40:47] preach seven tunders is seven
[2:40:55] ters so if you are now agreeing that the
[2:40:58] seventh ther Revelation is true just say
[2:41:00] it nobody say say what we
[2:41:04] [Music]
[2:41:08] say because we didn't say seven the
[2:41:10] prophet say seven
[2:41:12] [Music]
[2:41:13] ters we are saying what the prophet
[2:41:17] said and if you announce saying it well
[2:41:20] the prophet said
[2:41:22] it and we thank God you are now saying
[2:41:25] it
[2:41:28] Li then she became when she did
[2:41:32] that she became a wh to
[2:41:36] God and her daughters has done the same
[2:41:40] thing said Christ wants his
[2:41:45] wife pure with the word
[2:41:50] pure with the word that is why God Wants
[2:41:54] You in doing his will in Waiting upon
[2:41:58] God you have to remain pure with the
[2:42:02] word the way she must
[2:42:09] be be
[2:42:11] seated the psychology of human
[2:42:17] beings Women Believe what they
[2:42:24] hear sometime you see a very beautiful
[2:42:29] woman and they tell that this is the
[2:42:31] boyfriend or the husband of this woman
[2:42:33] and you like with this
[2:42:41] girl is what the man is telling
[2:42:45] her what she's hearing from him
[2:42:51] he might be useless and know nothing but
[2:42:54] she's rich and beautiful but that's the
[2:42:56] one she
[2:42:58] loves because of what he has been
[2:43:01] pumping
[2:43:12] into that's a psychology of human beings
[2:43:19] and Men also choose by what they
[2:43:27] see our eyes is our
[2:43:30] problem and the women your
[2:43:33] ears are your
[2:43:36] problem so if you take gossipers you
[2:43:39] hardly see men in inside that
[2:43:45] thing have you heard is women who have
[2:43:48] time for
[2:43:50] their ears are
[2:43:54] always that's why the serpent said did
[2:43:56] God
[2:44:02] say bring that foolishness to
[2:44:05] Adam would have booted him out of the
[2:44:09] garden spoke to
[2:44:11] Eve well the devil has still got the
[2:44:14] same trick on the church
[2:44:19] he comes with
[2:44:21] interpretation to let you hear false
[2:44:26] Creed and God is also looking at the
[2:44:29] character of the
[2:44:31] church to see is there Faith there is
[2:44:35] there virtue there is there knowledge
[2:44:37] there is there Temperance there is there
[2:44:39] patience there because he's the
[2:44:41] bridegroom he looking at the character
[2:44:45] he is looking for a church with a spot
[2:44:48] with a rink he is looking for a people
[2:44:51] that can wait on his word he is looking
[2:44:54] for a people that can believe his
[2:44:58] word that's why the prophet said The
[2:45:01] more you hear the
[2:45:03] word the more you become the way because
[2:45:07] we are the Bride of Jesus
[2:45:11] Christ so Christ wants his
[2:45:14] wife de with the
[2:45:16] word the way she must be
[2:45:20] because
[2:45:21] nothing not one thought or one GLE or
[2:45:24] [Music]
[2:45:27] anything or TI will pass from that
[2:45:35] law from that book till all is
[2:45:39] fulfilled Jesus said both Heaven and
[2:45:41] Earth will pass away but my word shall
[2:45:44] never pass away don't put any private
[2:45:47] interpretation to it
[2:45:50] he want the pure unadulterated
[2:45:55] amen not even a
[2:45:59] fleet I wouldn't want my wife flating
[2:46:02] not even a flat
[2:46:06] sorry I wouldn't want my wife flirting
[2:46:09] with some other
[2:46:10] man and when you go to listening to any
[2:46:14] kind of Reason beyond
[2:46:17] that you are fting with
[2:46:21] Satan amen amen don't make it feel he
[2:46:25] said Don't It Make You Feel
[2:46:28] religious God wants you to stay

[2:46:34] word stay right with it all right stay
