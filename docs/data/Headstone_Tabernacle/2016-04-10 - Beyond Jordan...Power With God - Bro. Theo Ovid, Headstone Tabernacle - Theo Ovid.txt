this morning I have a something up on my heart that I Bel believe the Lord give me to share with you this morning we want to go straight into the word we have no comments so could we stand we want to look at 2 Kings chapter 2 want to read verse 6- 15 we also want to read from Genesis chter 32 reading from verse 22 to 30 read in 2 Kings chap 2:6 to 15 and Elijah said unto him T I pray thee here for the Lord had sent me to Jordan and he said as this as the Lord live it and as I saw live it I will not leave thee and they went and they too went on and 50 of the sons of the prophets went and stood to view far off and they stood by Jordan Elijah took his mantle wrapped it together and smoked the waters and they were divided hither and thither so that they two went over on dry ground came to pass when they were gone over that Elijah said unto Elisha ask what I shall do for thee before I be taken away from thee and Elijah said I pray thee let a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me and he said thou has ask a hard thing nevertheless if thou see me when I am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so and it came to pass as they still went on and talked that behold there appeared a chariot of fire horses of fire and parted them both a Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven Elijah saw it and he cried my father my father The Chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and rent them in two pieces he took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of Jordan and he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and smoked Waters and said where is the Lord God of Elijah and when he had smitten the waters they parted hither and thither and Elisha went over and when the sons of the prophets which were to view Jericho saw him they said the spirit of Elijah do rest on Elisha and they were came to meet him and bow themselves to the ground before him Genesis chapter 32 we want to read from 22 to 30 this is Jacob on his way to meet his brother going to meet the angel verse 22 and he rose up that night this is Genesis CH 32:22 he rose up that night and took his two wives his two woman servants his 11 sons and passed them over the Ford Jabbok and he took them and sent them over the brook and sent over that he had verse 24 I love this verse and Jacob was left alone and there Wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day and when he saw he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of Jacob's tie was out of joint as he wrestled with him and he said let me go for the they break it and he said I will not let thee go except thou bless me amen he said unto him what is thy name he said Jacob he said thy name shall be called No More Jacob but Israel for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men and has prevailed Hallelujah and Jacob asked him and said tell me I praise the thy name he said wherefore is it that thou ask after my name and he blessed him there and Jacob called the name of the place penel for I have seen God face to face and my life is preserved let's pray father how we thank you for these anointed scriptures this morning and we pray that you anoint each and every one of us to hear he your word anoint me to speak your word and may life Lord the seed go to taking on

ol give me a scripture and we're so fitting and we exalted in it for the preting on Thursday and I want to read back that scripture from Luke Chapter 9:51 you don't have to find it but it says and it came to pass this is about Jesus now when the time was come that he should be received up he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem amen so when Jesus recognized the time is Drawing Near amen for him to be crucified he he set his face steadfastly towards Jerusalem you have to fix your position towards your destination am amen amen you have to get focused on on where you're going that's what Jesus did amen earlier on when they tried to grab him he said you can't touch me he said my hour is not yet come amen amen but when his time was upon him he said my hour is come amen that the son of man be glorified amen he knew the time and the season but notice he didn't duck it he was facing towards it and we have ducked this part going through this morning a long time you can't duck it no

one the message world have right now we need a double portion one can be enough you not hearing what I'm saying [Applause] say praise God this battle hasn't even commenced and people freaking out much when the batt start go trying to introduce to you be and lion because Goliath on his way [Applause] you can't squinch now sitting down in church this not killable killable does mean Church you have to go out and meet him so you expect to come to church drive and worship and then go home and then go to the Rapture I'm going to meet him in the air is that how you expect to go because serious I didn't think that was part of my plan and understanding you know but M say after a bde will be a hunted persecuted group and after a short Display of Power she be taken off the Earth who hunting you who looking for [Applause] you have Jokers who might criticize you forget that shut up hold your peace you're ugly you're this you're too tall you're too short you're too this they see what they want there's not power with them it's power with [Applause] God power with God open doors that was formerly closed did you get that that door was closed yesterday but yesterday was yesterday and today today y today did you get that you may be seated yesterday the door is closed but you get power with God that door opening as you approach it is that Manpower it is God power and that's why brother bham said the world will bow at the feet of men and women who Cross [Applause] Jordan not just cross Jordan but cross Jordan go beyond Jordan and comeing back because when Elijah came back the schools of the prophets said the spirit of Elijah thought rest upon Elisha they know he was coming back in power come on say Amen somebody you may be seated but ask me he went across a son and he came back a manifested son did you understand that just a cross over Yonder have power to change and to transform you from being a son into a manifested son where is the Lord God of Elijah and he smok the Jordan and he walked just like Elijah and Jesus said the same works I do we'll be walking like him we'll be talking like him we'll be manifesting what he manifest he said the same works the same Works he cast all Devils we cast them out also he healed the [Music] sick how many going to say Amen to that am some people still not saying amen amen you may be seated you see when you look at yourself you don't want to say Amen cuz you telling yourself you're not ready for that but God don't deal with where you are at God deal with where you will be so Jesus could see what Peter was going through and said the devil want to sift you like wheat I see what the devil up to but I pray not to get you out of your stuff but in the midst of your stuff I pray that your faith don't fail because if your faith only fail all fall down because we live by faith we walk by faith your Christian Life Is by faith if you get delivered you keep your deliverance by faith yes you keep your healing by faith if you let your faith drop the disease come back the the thing is bind you comes back it takes Faith to keep off the devil it takes Faith to keep your healing it takes Faith to keep your deliverance you just say delivered and you're still walking in Slack it takes Faith to stand come on preach back to me somebody you need to have faith faith is the currency of God that God respect all that I am all that I ever will be is based upon faith in his word that's God's currency so somebody could be a Christian there for 30 40 years and have no faith and somebody walk in the building maybe a sinner maybe a a whatever it is and they have faith and they receive and walk [Applause] out Jesus never asked the blind man how long you're blind how long you believe in me no may be seated Jesus did blind man recognize no traffic on the street they say they say why he said what what's happening what they said Jesus in the next street the crowd on that side have mercy upon me now son of David somebody say he can't hear you have mercy see shut up hold your peace have mercy upon me L son of David Jesus couldn't hear that man voice but you see faith faith hit heaven heaven hit Jesus Jes to turn around you not hear what I'm saying that that blind man had to deal with people saying you're wasting your time you're shouting for nothing that's why you better shout inside of here you know what you're shouting for yes you saying hallelujah you better know why you're saying hallelujah that's the universal word of Praise I want to shout hallelujah right now that songs good that song like the walls of Jericho coming down ah Glory Glory I feel the vision is being transferred I feel that you're getting the vision it's not your mother it's not your father it's not your don't know your F your is and you're missing your mother a long time and you have this complex and that complex forget all them complexes shut up hold your peace this time we shutting up complexes we shutting up depression and and this one have a fight with me and that one have a fight forget all of that them fight with the self you have no fights with anybody your fight is with Jordan come on say Amen somebody you struggling to get Beyond [Applause] Jordan all them Devils troubling you slapping you packing you up in a corner that's because you ain't going to be on Jordan yet when you come past Jordan with them Devils them Devils taking off this look he coming back he coming back coming back coming back coming back power coming back I felt that power praise God the devil the devil know power the devil know and recognize Paul I know Peter I know power I know oh glory to God oh give the Lord a shout in the house may be seated Hall the Bible call it power from on high you know that church power Pastor appoint a man so man walking with power with power he's a deacon he's a police looking to lock up people in church amen looking to harass people go by the house and do this police that's power because a man put that man in power that's not power with God send that police to me goad that's woo not me somebody else power with God I want you to focus on that my trials my tri no no I don't want to study trials this morning my situation don't study that study what the power God will do for you in your [Applause] situation notice notice Moses in his intellectual condition kill a man and run that is having an understanding of his calling intellectually with no power he just had a little power to fight a man down you fight a man don't kill a man and then recognize but listen this trouble in know run so he had run in power without power notice when he got in contact with the pillar of fire he was alone wife not with him amen children not with him group not with him right alone this power thing is not group [Music] thing and a lot of people caught up because they want the group support they want group to feel saved but when Moses met that pillar fire and God finish with him I like that he was ready to face anything he was ready to face what he ran from question what are you running from Moses couldn't run from his past he kill a man Hallelujah that's on the record book he couldn't say let it be struck off Jesus everybody news history but that a changing what God think about Moses that doesn't change what God purposes has for Moses life and whatever you have done that does not change God's purpose about your life the pastor can stop it the Elder can stop it Deacon can stop it your past can't stop it your sins can't even stop it because God said my word hallelujah shall not return unto me void so once he sends his word out it's good as done thy word is settled forever in the heavens God settled that word concerning you the devil is finished this morning you're going to get a breakthrough I feel it going to be now right now this service the devil is finished this morning power going to come into your life I believe it that's why I'm preaching it we have to get [Applause] it oh let's go further hallelujah hallelujah I can't believe this have to believe it Hallelujah we were speaking about all the Mysteries that to be revealed to the bride when he went down the road he said now have anybody got a revised version of the Bible he said the eagle the messenger of the loud easn church age Russian 10: 1-7 he said he come down he put one foot upon the land one foot upon the sea and then time shall be no more and when he did seven Thunders utter the voices and when the seven tunders UT the voices John said I was about to write he said don't write it he sealed it amen there's a part I want to get to someone say well that Seven Seals then brother brandham talk about the seven Thunders that Seven Seals speaking about what just talk about there7 will be reveal in the last days are you ready some great mystery how we get closer to God Amen hallu that's a question here the answer no sir it can't be it's whosoever shall take one word from the Bible or add one word to it his part will be taken off from The Book of Life what it is is a revelation on what has been missed back there amen it's already wrote but it's to reveal what has already been written that is what the Thunders is about now the reason I presented that to you is to identify that the revelation of the seven t do is not the key how to get closer to God in that sense so in other words the Thunders doesn't make you bypass [Music] Jordan here the question again them Seven Seals will be revealed some great mystery how we get closer to God hallelujah am he said no it's to reveal what's hid what's written that's what that is about but God has revealed how to get closer to him by Faith by virtue by knowledge by Temperance by Patience by Jordan so in other words the seven Thunders can't make you bypass [Music] death people believe saying seven thund seven Faith or what that that what what that means no Jord that means no death no dying out no crucifixion when God took a prophet and God took away his wife God took away his child God took away the anointing God Dro a black sheat over him and he was that Elijah and if God could take a son to through all of that and when B was preaching adoption he would say he was just testing me going through it it doesn't look like test but he was just testing me because he said he Elisha got about 10 years to fit into the mantle God not cutting the mantle to fit you God cutting you to fit the mantle the mantle have the size cut shape already is you have to get cut it took Elijah some time to grow to meet the mantle that is why that particular time he could said praise God stay here stay here stay here to see what's in that man to see if he will go past stay here stay here stay here amen I am not staying until I meet up to what God purpose and predestination for my life I am not staying [Applause] anywhere notice there was no friends around him there was no family with him there was no brother sister mother husband no no no no just Elisha alone and that is how they must come to you got to be caught alone like Jacob Jacob sent his family here his wife here this one here that one here his property here all his things here and he was caught alone am God wanted that and some of you still not alone CU your cell phone ringing and the text still texting and the WhatsApp message keep coming so you're not alone yet you're busy engaged that's the age we living in people fully engaged and God want to catch you alone and to do that God to bring some problems some big ones to make sure we can't even we don't even want the phone ring go want to tr to pray and everything have you're so busy kind get a break this one calling this one texting oh the joy of not having a smartphone amen near you am at times I just say I just say the whole [Laughter] thing woo there my phone was outside in the room and I said thank God I said I ain't seeing I ain't hearing if you don't make time time wouldn't come you have to say this is time time off lock it off shut it off is a half an hour hour you got to do it to make time to connect with your God we need that connection we need that empowerment you see this be system making magic if the people from long ago come now and they see what's happening you know what they say witchcraft you put a car in a machine and money come out that's witchcraft Hallelujah you take something to your air and put it and talking to somebody else miles away witchcraft that will be a mystery for somebody 200 years ago come back and see you talking at the phone wait what what's that do you smoke signals long time one smoke mean yes maybe two smoke mean no I don't know maybe three smoke means how are you Hallelujah it had no facts it had no phone so what they will see now is like we doing magic well that is what the be system is supposed to do produce Miracles Powers relying on Science and Technology there is no need for [Applause] God long time you need translation power to move amen far distances like Phillip now you could take a taxi or a maxi or airplane long time was different it was power that was the church needed it was power they was calling for not man power power from on high not man of the hour coming to bring some revelation we had 40 plus years of thatall it's the power of God Amen and Paul Paul said it this way when I come among you I come among you with weakness and fear and trembling that your faith may not rest in the wisdom of man but in the power of God so he didn't want them to get get caught up in his intellectual capacity to reveal Mysteries and word he wanted them to be get caught up in the God that was behind the intellectual stuff that he was presenting that when he walk away they will have faith in the God that he presented by the the word because the power was in God understand this all these things could be preached without power all the Mysteries could be preached without inspiration it could be study and just plain intellect humans speaking but when God begin to move the Bible talk about men of old moved by the Holy Ghost that's different that's [Applause] different I would hate to think that I'm doing this not inspired amen hallelujah just intellectual just studying a man reading understand what the priest say do College of theology do breaking down Greek and and and all kind of all kind of mysteries and things inside of there and they will come and elct you and so on you ever went to a Catholic sermon for a funeral very polished and then they have this Sacrament and have this the sacrament and they smoking up and they're smoking up when they finish there it look so classy but that's just plain intellect God not in that God not inspiring that but we have to see God coming to inspire the word to us that's why you need to be in the spirit that the spirit could reveal himself to you and bring Revelation to you so when you leave here you leave will prevail in power it doesn't change a situation at home it doesn't change whatever it is but it changes you because you are the object of God to change the devil trying to give you sight shows that's why I hate blaming prise God I like when people own up God hallelujah notice what the angel asked Jacob what's your name who are you Jacob say I'm I'm a businessman very wealthy one at that amen amen you know I I deserve a break no Hallelujah he didn't say that he was a schemer I don't think people really understand that you know you about Jacob and Jacob and Jacob but you don't know how much people mother father brother he's everybody you if if you really understand Jacob you wouldn't want to talk with them because you'll be watching the pocket you'll be watching you you you can't trust him amen amen because he will rip you off with your eyes open that's Jacob and God said Jacob I [Applause] love we not going on Esau he hate not we're not going there we just sticking with the real thing Jacob I love what did God see in Jacob he had a desire for the birthright oh Hallelujah [Applause] prise God so do you understand amen you cannot bypass the life of Jesus Christ by Mysteries by knowledge by information by teachings you still have to get to the life because the prophet said that's the Thunder am that shakes hallu the devil not not the coat no no the life that's the Thunder because see Satan get in contact with power already you know and it sing him when Jesus give him his vult he can't forget that you ever get put your hand in a socket and get shock there some people now don't like to touch anything electrical because they were shocked before that is what Satan got from Jesus he was shocked with a vault from is written he got that and he getting it again that is why he'll be so mad at those who remain because the bride will give him a shock he don't understand who you are he don't even believe who you are how could he believe it Jacob you trickster you how could he believe that you are going to be changed you are history that he knows but you have a history that God knows which history is right your history is already in [Applause] God Oh Glory Hallelujah don't let the devil open his his history book go back in God's book that's why the angel came with the open book to reveal who you really are not your flesh history your genetic God history where you come from God you're going back to God listen with the power of God you would slap up those trials you would crush the things that on you would walk on water you would walk on your situation you will stop feeling weak weak weak and say I am strong strong strong we stop that oh Hallelujah okay let's go a little forward we going slow but sure I'm not hurry I'm fine I'm fine amen for marriage of the Lamb are you ready so many say if the Lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking from gambling from lying or stealing I will serve him but that's up to you you have got to do something too they that overcome shall inherit all things they that overcome you have power to do it am but you must be willing to lay it down you see she has made herself ready I like that you see God could not push us through a little pipe pull us out the other end and then say blessed is he that overcome it Hallelujah you had nothing to overcome Hallelujah he just push you through but you have got to make decisions yourself I have to make decisions for myself and in doing that we show our faith and respects to God I love decisions because decisions put you where you could be or where you should be or where you want to be by your decisions you could choose your friends choose to let go this don't go here don't do this that's your choice and you could stand by your choice because we find out people do what they want to do you see on a Friday people like to go online and go and relax yourself let's call a perit on Friday see what happened it's not the timing not late in night and traffic because you could have traffic they still going they go to a restaurant they going somewhere that not bothering them Hallelujah but prayer meeting Friday the way that is processed if we could only process that like going to the restaurant you're going to God's restaurant to see what you have on the table and God going to bless you and you're going to pick things off the table of God then the picture changes is what you want you have to have a desire in your spirit in your soul for a breakthrough for a closer walk with God you're tired of you you're coming to the end of yourself God to your Expo to your own experiences have already exposed you you know you're no good hallah Hallelujah you know you don't have the strength that you you think you wanted to have God letting you know he is your strength he is your support glory to God you lean on your money until your money fail he wanted your money to fail because the money didn't fail you couldn't lean on him so when your money fail this fail that fail then you have nothing else to do but to lean on him then he could tell you I don't fail I can't fail I will never leave you nor forsake you lean on me I can handle it I can handle your problems lean on me I can handle your situation lean on [Applause] me are you with me this is what God wants Satan's job is to disconnect you from God amen amen praise God he don't even mind you plugging the church praise God where the church have members but God have sons the over is not the same no it's not the same sorry members join sons are born Give the Lord a shout in the house the church have members the church you could join that but you could never join your family you are born there and they can't denounce [Music] you God can say you're not a son you might be Wayward you might be a Jacob you might be stward if there is a word hallelujah but God can deny who you are oh give the Lord some shouts in here that's why David said if I make me bed in hell he is [Applause] there why once a son once a eagle once a chicken always a chicken you can't change that Hallelujah come on now but you were born a eagle you were born to fly don't let no devil clip your wings this service is a service time to [Applause] show Wonder let's say this one again you say if the Lord if the Lord will take this e Spirit from me from drink drinking smoking stealing lying I'll serve him that's up to you you have got something to do work it outall clean up your life work it out get radical Hallelujah get angry at you get upset with you many of us get upset with everybody else but us we're not talking about nobody the external we still coming down to the individual get mad at you amen look in the mirror and talk to yourself when last look in the mirror and talk to yourself not like yourself somebody look in the mirror and they like how they're looking I'm not talking about that fixing the hair and fixing the face and everything else I'm not talking about that I'm talk about looking beyond that physical form and say you see inside of there hallu you have some work to do come on come on get serious talk to yourself get serious about God yes I'm talking to you look in the mirror tell him like it is whoever SE Shake him up and come to on fire hall come to church under the expectation come to church believ him that today is your day oh hallelujah hallelujah oh let's take a little further amen Martin Luther saw it he come with a catholism what did they do they built a little fence we are lutherans this is it they built a little fence then Wesley come what they say they build a fence this is it and the light move on Pentecostal SW what they do Wesley and all them build fences he said we cannot do that amen we cannot do that Hallelujah we have got to follow here we go are you ready we got to follow every day every hour of the day amen every step of the way amen we have got to be led by the Lord Jesus Christ amen if we don't we take on an organizational life Hallelujah and a life that doesn't follow Christ daily is not worthy remember organization is Mark of the Beast and that's why I tell you people talking on behalf of the church they have a church life they don't have a real Christian life because the Christian Life you take up your cross daily Hallelujah not sundly I know that's not a word not monthly but but daily not Sunday the cross and time you go downstairs the cross off your back no you follow him daily and a life that doesn't follow Christ daily is not worthy a man that's a Christian on Sunday then goes to church and sit back and think he owns the church because he does this that the other and Monday will St and lie wom that will go out on the public beaches and upon the streets and More close on they take the spirit of the world that don't belong in the Church of the Living God praise the name of the Lord here is now this is sea time bright time the shock is dead the shocks are dried up Virgin word time not touched it's virgin virgin word and listen there will be no denominational man handling in the Virgin birth of the Bride she is commanded by God to come out of such so the bride God will not allow the bride to be manhandled that's why God going to deliver the bride out of the spirit of man Hallelujah number six because the bride have to get the word from a husband oh Jesus here we go love this a Christian is not a tool or some kind of mechanical wrench to a great big religious regime a Christian is not some kind of tool that keeps a religious organization moving that's not a Christian a Christian is to be Christlike and a Christian cannot be a Christian until Christ come into the man am the Life of Christ in him then it produces the Life of Christ lived and you do the things that Christ did what am I talking about a personal relationship to Christ you come to church but do you have a relationship with Jesus Christ because that makes the whole difference it change your whole perspective that you are not alone you are connected to God oh hallelujah praise the name of the Lord Praise so there's only one way to get into the church that is by birth Christians you must have a personal relationship to God in order to be a Son of God you must become relations to God he must be your father in order for you to be a son and only his sons and daughters are saved not the members of the church but Sons and Daughters there's only one thing that can produce that and that's the new birth and if you are born again your entire nature is changed and God himself what you become a prisoner to him now you become a l prisoner other men can smoke the world can laugh make fun but you are prisoner to Christ other men can smoke and drink and carry on if they want to call themselves Christians deacons even preachers but not you you're prisoner you're prisoner to the word notice god making himself known we are not supposed to make convert to Christianity by government d by handing books and tapes and be bringing people to the Lord and whatnot watch he said now watch but by the Revelation that Christ is in you and God was in Christ and God was in Christ and Christ is in you and what God did in Christ Christ does in you so we not even supposed to make converts by government we supposed to make convert by Revelation isn't that right not by legalism don't cut your head don't do this don't do this we had that for 40 plus years what has it brought it brought churches but where is the power of God manifested oh praise the name of the Lord do you believe that am what is it is being filled with the spirit him having the no other Church no other sign no other Fellowship no other government no other testimony no other Creed no denomination is accepted outside of this God accept nothing else but Christ in you may God help us here this morning to see the burden of the word that what God really trying to get is Christ in you the hope of glory you see God is not in this bishop youing a bishop over his people God in the pillar Fire coming inside of you hallelujah hallelujah remember the pillar fire above what God identify God above us then God With Us in Christ then his purp was to be in us the object was God to come in his people not man ruling over man but God ruling in man you being a powered son so God come and put a power generator inside of you and you begin to light up others power up others from your mouth others being empowered and then the whole all Kingdom being revolutionized by sons of God because that is what God want originally let us make man and and multiply and replenish isn't that right have dominion and multiply isn't that right upon the Earth So Adam was to reproduce other Sons so we have a kingdom of sons but then the devil injected himself and that's where we get the battle that we have this morning oh glory to God so brother says God accept nothing else but Christ in you the hope of glory the only thing that God recognizes is no Fellowship no church no Creed no denomination it is dead it is fragments that had to be cut off all this church thing and message and that had to be cut off it has to be powered son people can't judge you by what group you go to church to that's what they have to do now who's your pastor and according to what they hear they the eyebow thing up so and the forward thing up so because they don't like your pastor trouble say you know like you know funny funny business no discernment no Revelation but on the platform on the platform somebody come there he don't know them he say you a Christian I feel that Spirit hallu I'm not hearing you come on now but who's your pastor what is you going to he has no time for that it's it's people just keep coming up like that and said no you're a Christian a man come he say you you're not sick you a preacher you you want a Revival look at Spirit the spirit saying Revival he have a big Revival sign I want a Revival all that's in the spirit realm that preacher come up there he not sick he said you want a oldfashioned holy ghost Revival so if you're not sick you you must want [Applause] oldfashioned all of us sick you may be seated I am sick this morning I'm sick of me I'm sick of myself I want a Revival a oldfashioned sin killing SK that's what I want that's what I'm preaching for I don't want to leave you the same I walk inside of here I want to leave your charge I want to leave you on fire I want to leave you empowered with the power of God we are all in the upper room I I am not in a higher room and you in a lower room we in the same room Oh Glory to God are you with me now so could know they Christian by their Spirit by discernment am he don't need to know who the pastor is he don't need to know what church to go to you're a Christian not because of where you go to church you're a Christian wherever you are you're a Christian because God put something inside of you to be like Jesus oh give the Lord a shout don't let nobody make you feel less than a [Applause] [Music] Christian one time there's a story about a woman who work in hand she have children and cleaning and can't go to church and whatnot and I tell her Sheed to go to church we going tell Christ she say show my hands going to church make a Christian that people go to church not Christian not Christian at all and forever in church the churchy not because SE is church and Christian Church is the same thing don't mix up those se's church is one thing Christian is one thing a Christian will stand anywhere a Christian could handle pressure a Christian can stand rebuke a Christian could take the word they could slam the word and them they taking it because they are part of that word you think God didn't see Jacob being transformed but Jacob had to work it out and did he work it out all night long his TI could out a joint while wrestling and he still wasn't letting go that pain and you're still holding on that is pain and you're still wrestling some of you in pain but you have to come on now come on now we talking

and he wanted to reveal himself it was a desire in him to unveil or unfold or show himself but he was so mysterious he was L Elohim all existing by himself he wasn't even God because nobody worshiped

and forever he had a promise a Spirit come upon the bride to do the same thing that he did it's reproducing again of the green so after brother bam came and left what we have to see is that green reproduced we have had the ministry of teaching the teach us and prophecy of what is to come but there comes an hour when a key is turned and the spirit begins to anoint to bring life to the seed and that will produce another grain again isn't that right we producing the grain same life same signs so the word Y young spake for itself this I'm see not a shock there is a secret of the message now

with God the individual Oh Glory to God oh could we take some more we now warming up Hallelujah all right let's go and talk about Jacob a little bit here now I love how B brought it out in his presence after Jacob wrestled all night and confessing his sins he called the place penal penel the word penal in the Hebrew means the face of almighty God Jacob had his name was Jacob which means a planter that's a deceiver had run all of his life away from God you hear that he run all his life away from God now if that was a Jacob in around that we know we say he he not a seed he ain't comeing to church he running running running running watch but he got a hold upon God I won't let him loose God we need more Jacobs amen he held on to the face of God in the presence of God he stayed until it was Sun up God said let me go the sun is arising he stayed in the face of God he went away Justified and saved what a great thing it was to know he had wrestled through that he had seen signs of God he had had dreams about God but this was one time he was in the face of God in the presence of God think of it friends as we hurry up in the presence of God a man is changed Jacob was changed now he could walk with God he was a different man that when he went up there the battle was now over yes sir he began to build an altar he hadn't been used to build an altars you know I tell you when you come in the presence of God you want to build an altar somewhere you want to find somewhere you can pray now Jacob was changed from Jacob to Israel a prince having power with God that is what happened to Jacob the deceiver are you ready the unrighteous the Unholy the deceiver he deceived his brother stole the birthright from his brother and a little dirty way of doing it such a deceiver he deceived his father-in-law put pop sticks and make speckled cares when the Cs being pregnated come here and look at it he deceive his mother he deceived his daddy he deceived his brother he was running everywhere he went always on a run from God he was on a run from his brother but when he come into the presence of God he recognized he was a sinner what did he do what did he do he seen his opportunity he had met something he didn't even think about before and he stayed there until all sins was gone amen God manages a way to get men in their presence and the made the decisions some of them run from him some run to him and if they're predestined to life they believe it they hang on to it the guy that confesses sins shall have pardon if you hide your sins you will not Prosper so Jacob you know the next day he met his brother Esau he didn't need no help from him then he didn't need armies he was in the business of building altars he wasn't afraid of Esau no more oh Hallelujah that contact with the angel that wrestling with God he didn't need no support no human support I need this one I need that one I need that I need that no you need God and God will bring and unfold all what you have need of David said I have set the Lord before me Psalm 168 that's a good thing to do I've set the Lord before me he wanted to be conscious of his presence so David said I have set the lord always before my face watch that's a good lesson for us tonight set the Lord before our face be conscious of his presence put him first put him first before you why then you won't sin when you realize that you are constantly in the presence of God when you realize God is WR you will watch what you say a man when he think God is gone he will cuss he would lust after woman he will steal he will cheat he would lie he will do anything when he think that God don't see him but bring him into the presence of God he will stop it right now amen and David said I have put the Lord all before me that's a good thing no wonder no wonder God said he was a man after his own heart man will do anything when God is near but when he realizes that God near and so forth oh Hallelujah so he said Jacob he watch old Jacob held on to all night he sure hold on a long time but when he surrendered himself when he got weak he couldn't hold on no longer oh God Let the church get like that the church get to a place where it can't hold on listen any longer with natural abilities and has to give over to God let the Methodist be ashamed of themselves if they are Methodist let the Baptist let the Pentecostal be ashamed of themselves stop holding on and yield to the spirit it was then Jacob become a prince of God the Bible said become a prince his name was changed remember he was a great strong man on this side intellectually aul but on the other side he was a limping Prince weak and worn down but have power before God before that strong man intellectually on this side when he crossed Jordan and

David not interested in money David not on the offer all he want is God on go who is that uncircumcised Philistine how long is he doing there what is he doing here defying the armies of the Living God I will fight him what is it he had power with God he knew God was with him come on now he knew he was anointed he was anointed oh give the Lord I shout you have got to be anointed head then you could be commissioned by God you be seated David knew he was anointed he had a testimony he said listen the minister Association wasn't there but while I was taking care of the sheep a bear came and I killed him a lion came and I killed him there was no group and anybody healing me out then it was me amen and the sheep and the bear and my God and God delivered me the same God that give me that experience with the beer the same God would give me the experience with the lion he will give me an experience to deal with goad notice not the teachings not the intellect not the mystery the mystery was the god that was with David that was David hidden Mystery it wasn't no talk he said the the glad came out with his intellect what David and said am I a da I'll feed him to the birds and David watch him with outter sword and I'll cut your head off that big talk I'll cut your head off Bible said David ran to meet him that's how positive that's how that's how anointed that's how inspired David didn't walk David ran he already had the victory he just had to manifest glory to God that's what we are talking about you want be seated understand there's thousands and thousands of people in the Army not a man move this boy who wasn't qualified this boy who was under the age of to be in the Army he was running down to Mid Goliath what would make him do that he was Fearless Hallelujah you didn't get that he was fearless and the say in the face of a giant that nobody ever conquered David was Fearless no want to say something to you but say rise up you sons of God be Fearless have no fear in going towards your [Music] promise we challenge fear Upon Your Life come out of that fear this wouldn't work this not going to work this not going to happen forget it it will happen you may be see some of you have fear you fear this going to work out fear that I saw a statement a man made about failure he said his company is the right place to fail because they have plenty failures he said because anytime you try experiment if you know it going to work it's not an experiment experiment could pass experiment could fail we not even experimenting we by Revelation amen is a faith it's something that God break upon your soul amen oh Hallelujah we not experimenting if God say he going to heal you he going to heal you the devil is a liar God going to heal you go deliver you deliver you and yet after that look where I'm talking about healing somebody have a tumor somebody have a cancer they prayed for after they prayed for now the spirit and the tumor or cancer leaves and the body of flesh is still there without the spirit in it and then it start to circulate in the system that to feel bad and sick and they start to feel that not really heal and what not then the Spirit come back right back he said he tell them when you are prayed for and you feel sick he said that your [Music] heal you got to teach them how to keep the healing how to understand what has been going on with their system because the devil job is to keep you in unbelief keep you out of faith God job is to bring you into Faith that's why say if God deliver you it will take Faith to keep that off of you you could be delivered in the service today but it will take Faith to keep that Deliverance that breakthrough to keep whatever God bless you with to keep that it will take Faith you can't go back and do the same thing and it's not legalism really is if you break the laws of God they get in trouble God want to keep you blessed so he don't want to go here he don't want you to do this he don't want you to do that in order for you to be [Applause] blessed is not God trying to regulate you in that sense God trying to say listen I have certain laws if keep it in those laws your blessing will flow freely you break those laws you get in trouble oh blessed be the name of the Lord let me see if we can wrap up here praise God so much hallelujah oh my so David went there that's the matter today God got a lot of sheep that going on astray the organization and things have stole them out and brought them out in Psychology God give us Davids with the word of God and the power of God to direct it when we go to these intellectual Giants with all their PHD whatever it might be give me the word and the Holy Ghost and I'll tell you we can slay every Giant on the field that's all we need today the word and the Holy Ghost and every Giant on the field going to be challenged and be slained Hallelujah so today we know we need a Revival we know we need a stiring amongst the people it will not take a doct of divinity it will take weak Hallelujah that will take the word of God in the power of the resurrection of Christ and slay this thing it will bring Christ to the country it will let them see he can still Open the Eyes of the blind heal the sick raise the dead he God is a conqueror we need a David untrained in theological schools we need a man who knows nothing about that just a plow boy some little guy with stoop shoulders not much to look at come walking down the road with the power of God hallelujah how many ministers could God use this morning if they only let God bind them with his word or with his power and loose them from the strength of the denomination and organization how many sincere people in the city this morning that goes to Great organization churches how many could he filled with the Holy Ghost and set the country of fire with the gospel and the power if they only take and loose themselves from the power that have them Bound by his Spirit to be like Paul was a love slave to godj God took Paul and made a slave out of him bound him to himself sent him to the Gentiles which he hated you hear that God take his power bind Paul to his power and send him to the Gentile which he hated but you see here we go he had to be loosed from his ecclesiastical power to be bound to the power of God do you understand that these churches out there both in the message and out the message have a power but call ecclesiastical power that binds the people amen amen amen but a power is coming to unbind them oh my way he had to lose his strength and become weak and nothing in order to receive the strength of God to be bound to God to do what God would tell him to do here is something to console us here's something that encourages out of weakness and humility God chooses the people the B his kingdom out of if we ever get to heaven if you ever stand in the presence of God in his church we will stand in a bunch of people have been weak rejected cast out of the world and know nothing a rabbit can run a squirrel can get in a tree a dog can bite a Lon can tear a horse can kick a bird can fly but a sheep stand helpless that's the way God wants us realize that we are totally insufficient then God can take that person and begins to mold himself into that person make his hands do what God would have hands to do make his lips speak what God lips would speak because they're not his they're Gods he begin to build a character and begin to take his weakness and to make his own self God's side is weak and humble that's God's opportunity that's God's way of getting to us is when we are weak amen say that again preacher that's God's opportunity that is God's way of getting to us when we are weak say that again preacher that's God's opportunity that's God's we have get to us when we are weak we get something then the problem is we are too strong so God had to do something to break you come on and weaken you that he can get to you oh glory to God praise God this encourages of course because God whole kingdom is built out of these kind of people amen then when you get that kind of way you are in his kingdom the case is that we not too weak we are too strong we are too Str stronge headed we're too strong in our head we know too much that's the problem in this message just know too much we have to yield ourselves oh my oh my you say Lord I've been school for 40 years I'm an intellectual student I can quote my the Bible my eyes closed God can't use that you said I belong to the biggest church in the country I am this I am Pentecostal I rece Holy Ghost night and now you're going to make me so and so whenever no God can't use that are you with me I'm not done yet so keep writing with me now a whenever you get licked and realize you're lck and then come on back and humble yourself and get weak and find out you are [Applause] human Oh Glory Hallelujah you have to know you get licks amen you have to know you licked amen and find out you're human get weak and there are none of your intellectuals can do that human weaknesses will never be used of God God here we go by human weaknesses pours himself into you then he uses himself and you become an instrument so your weakness give God an opportunity to pour himself inside of you hallah your weakness bring a crack amen that's right or a space or opening hallelujah or an opportunity for something that you cannot do am say for one blood issue the Bible said her money ran out that's right if the money didn't run out what you the money going to the doctor amen doctor say come again next month until the money ran out so now that she has no money she has to activate another Channel is the faith Amen to believe amen the choice she had was I going to stay in this condition and die huj because that's where she headed or look to be healed because Jesus is walking around Hallelujah so she made a choice I'm not going to say man die no I'm going to go beyond all right what my husband telling me right what myself want to tell me I'm going to beyond all of that and I'm just going to touch the H of His Garment and I will be made whole am she begin to talk to her herself and she had no promise of that but she been to tell herself some stuff when last have you told yourself that you're going to get a breakthrough when tell yourself you get delivered said help me help me help me God want to hear that God want to hear you speak I am going to be delivered I am going to go free Hallelujah yes I'm not going to leave it the same way I came you got to begin to speak certain things you got to begin to prophesy even over your own life oh hallelujah it's the word and God said so that Spirit In You CES with the word every word CA the word is life and you are know your a Christian when you can fully agree upon every word of godu and you find yourself in love with your enemy oh Hallelujah don't fuss don't fuss when the family get in a fuss don't fuss with them your mother said I ain't having you go up there to that old church no more your old grand old grandmother don't fuss with her no mother it's all right I love you just the same don't fuss temper breeds temper the first thing you know you grieve the holy spirit away from you you'll be fussing back then the Holy Spirit takes his flight again we could operate in a home and it's not a Christian home it's not a Christian environment because the holy spirit is not really there because fussing is carrying on and whatnot we not looking to the Lord your husband do the wife do the children do the neighbor do and all this is humans you're not pulling back to say know Lord Lord what would you have me to do she is fussing I willn't fuss he is fussing you will not fuss why you're looking to encourage the spirit of God because a home could run without the Holy Ghost you know understand this people could live their life without God you know and be prosperous and have a good home and good marriage and God not there just normal human being grow live and die that's not you you are called to be of God and the devil knows that amen he sees a light over you and try to out that so that's why he's in your marriage in your whatever in your life that's why there's so much attacks because of who you [Applause] are Hallelujah hear him he will do the same okay talk about Jesus he adopt his own son he will do the same if you stand here we go after you receive the Holy Ghost and make yourself a Christian it doesn't have a pill that we hand out after service and say take two pill and that makes you a Christian a gospel and take that and make you a Christian you grow into Christ you become a Christian you make yourself a Christian you respect your husband because the word said that you humble yourself in the whole because the word said that you respect your parents because the word said that you love your wife because the word teaches that amen am hallelujah praise God isn't that right you choose to obey the word hallelujah and that is what makes you a Christian by your choice and by your action and by your life and God recognizes that because thou has chosen you have walked in your own choosing you have picked the precise and correct decision it is my way you choose the road that you're walking on it's the harder way but it's God's way God going to bless you because you choose the harder [Applause] way look at Elijah and Elisha I like the last one he said the Lord sent me to Jordan stay here there's your last chance your last chance to stay where you are stay put no to follow me all the way and that man said no way I'm going all the way Hallelujah I wonder if we have people here like that this morning want to go all the way how can the church the Pentecostal Church the Methodist Baptist Church be adopted until they come to discipline we've got to be disciplined first Hallelujah God could not trust this power with the church am I didn't expect any big amen for that how could God release power and there's no discipline these bunch of jokers that have how God could just let power upon them they don't have power and look at the behavior think about it now look at the behavior of churches pastors and whatever it is without power it's so off the beaten part much as if God put Power on that that's why few will be adopted because few will come into discipline few would come into character oh Hallelujah because that's what God wants to use character How could a father trust his business with a boy that might pollute his whole inheritance so that's why the Bible said though he's a son he is not get inheritance until the appointed time you don't take the inheritance and give it a little child you say when he reach age 21 or when he reached 18 He will get this and that the other he's 7 years now you don't give him now you you put something in the in in the document Satan when he reached this age he will get all of this that's what God does when he reach the stature he get all of this get poken with power witness and power holy ghost power anointed power manifestation son the power Oh Glory to God so we could preach that we blew in the face we still have to get character we could teach Mysteries preach Mysteries hand out Mysteries but we still have to get character character connects with power Oh Glory Hallelujah and but pains I can't stop now I'm in a gear I'm teaching this morning in bird pains he talk about the chicken in the egg amen call it pimping yes nature have it you have to you has to pip his way out if he try to break the shell off it

you die wreck and are born into the kingdom of God I want to hear bigger amen than that you can't be that tired oh glory to God there's not a shouting jumping service but you can't be that tired that

God's provided way you don't go by book Shake hand join pump up pull down you simply have to get from your old Shell and no better way than they ever found Hallelujah amen there's found no better way for a baby to get what is wanted besides God way for it you could say my little son I'm a theologian I've read books how to raise a baby your mother child born in a mother home mother parents when you're hungry just ring that little bell the only way the baby know is the Christ head that's right that's God's way and that's the way we want is to cry for it don't be ashamed as I'm hunging for God

after the Living God not a bigger house not more money I'm hunging for God he know what I have need of he will bless you with house money Car Land whatever but seek first the kingdom of God that God know you're hungry for him put God first not your wife put God first not your job put God first not your family not your children put God first and God will honor your faith in him put God first and he'll make a way amen amen come on now put God first he will bless you in the presence of your enemies glory to God [Applause] hallelujah glory to God Amen thank you Jesus I'm on the home stretch here now amen amen talking about Paul he was so great so determined to smash out all the people that was weak but you know I'm a grandfather now keeping one of my grandchildren lying on the ground and he see something that he want to go after and I see his eyes eyes light up nobody he want to go after and he would stretch his way and I would raise the block him and he would stretch and he would stretch and he would stretch and he would go around I we say we know where his GPS heading these children admire they have such a determination and when that GPS tell them so and they want to go after that their eyes light up they go in after that nothing stopping them I like that and I said you know what the Bible say acceptable acceptable like a little child and children they Fearless one of them he don't want to creep he want to walk he seems that almost want to bypass creeping he creep as far as to get up to try to walk and he stand up there and he will make his move and and and and and he not backing down you know oh yes because it our come to make a next stage in life and I feel the same way this morning that that we come to a spot that that we got to make a move but you can't move it in fear you can't move and they scared because the children have no fear that's the beautiful thing about them they are fearless they would lean over they would look to dive out they have no fear glory to God hallelujah praise God and that's the way I want the church that's the way I want you have no fear don't say God will judge you and God going kill you praise God hallelujah glory to God hallelujah God not for you he said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you because this happened and that happened will not bless you that's a lie God blessing us based upon what you do what you didn't do you already blessing Christ he chose you before the foundation of the world he is not now choosing you glory he was strong he could bind the Christians and put them in jail because they wouldn't agree with him upon his theological Doctrine upon the doctrine of phes and Sadducees he was buying the Christians but notice he had to become bong himself so he could lose his strength and Authority God passes the Nobles he passes the priests he passed those who are arrogant he choose Paul this great man yeah this are you ready and made him fall in the dust of the earth he made him act the way those he was arresting acted Hallelujah he made him fall God High Paul powerful Paul throw him over his High House let him bite the dust and some of us that's why God have to put us hallelujah might be hard but every life have to face a Jordan that we bite the dust and we say good Lord hallelujah I'm done Glory Hallelujah glory to God Amen thank you Jesus God Joseph had was to shave off some stuff before he can meet the king God sometimes have to take people like that shave off their few wheels off they can't do what they want to do you know what I mean they not at Liberty to do what

the Holy Spirit to see the Holy Spirit make the word of God be confirmed by the thing that he been done I want tonight you say with our heads bowed if that ambition that we have of being something else maybe of some we might think be a selfish thing I wonder if we will lay that aside I wonder if some young boy here tonight would look around and say I'm going to be when I get big I'm going to be
