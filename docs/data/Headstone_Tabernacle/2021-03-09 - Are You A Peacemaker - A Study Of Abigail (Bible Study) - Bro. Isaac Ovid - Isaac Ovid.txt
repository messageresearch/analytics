lord take me out of the way and speak lip to ear to your people in the precious name of jesus christ amen amen and amen certainly want to welcome one and all uh tonight in the precious name of jesus christ uh it's such a great privilege to be here uh one more time and uh looking to see what god will do for us tonight and it's such a great privilege to be able to gather uh and to as i say to break the the i call it the monotony or the necessity of life and our various responsibilities and to be able to report for duty for what is most uh important you know which is the word of god and our spiritual growth uh in god and and all things concerning what we do every day and how we live and how we act and there's a template you know uh in in the business world there are templates that you use to guide you that you don't have to reinvent the wheel if there's something that you do every day it really makes no sense to do it you know fresh if you have to do it every single day you have a template you you have you have certain things that you have in place that sort to make your job easier that you don't have to reinvent your wheel you know you don't wake up in the morning and try to figure out how to make a car to get to work you know you use the car that has been made you know why you sit down they're trying to invent a car if there's a car already invented and the same thing is there are so many situations and challenges that we encounter on a daily basis how wonderful it is to know that there are templates in the word for how to deal with different situations that we don't have to figure it all out because the answer has been given to us if we only know where to look if we only know what questions to ask uh if we only understand the the amount of insights that god placed in scripture for us and the challenge for us is you know most of us don't spend that quality time to see what god wants us to see in the world so we thank god for his grace that he is revealing himself to us in his way and we thank him for the wisdom of revelation and and how god is able to you know bring light to these things to us that we could move differently act differently you know but over knows i have a major challenge you know i i i i struggle daily with this battle and this battle is a battle of dealing with mediocrity and dealing with average and dealing with people's default positions of that good pass and that's okay and this is acceptable you know and uh i in looking at the more i look at scripture and and as you know for if if you're here for the first time this is a very practical class um i don't consider myself to be super spiritual i believe that the gospel is a practical gospel it is meant to impact our daily lives the word is meant to impact our daily lives it's not meant for us to walk around swell headed because of knowledge and insight and deep mysteries and you don't know how to deal with your wife you don't know how to deal with your children you don't know how to to manage your business your fears your testimony in the workplace these things matter because it matters to god you know uh you read through scripture you see so many examples of how god called men and god called women operated uh it's examples to us that we used to check ourselves you know so i was sharing in a meeting work related this week you know about operational excellence and product excellence there are two things you know one is about the process and one is a body product so operational excellence is about the way you work and these all have scriptural context because a lot of us we accept mediocrity we we accept it of ourselves and we accept it of others and i was giving an illustration about steve jobs of apple one time one of his designers brought one of the devices to him and if you've ever interacted with a ipad or an iphone or any device it is it is characterized by its sleek design you know there's a lot of emphasis and a lot of effort goes into the design you know very few people ever get to see if ever the inside of a device you know very few people could see they have seen the inside of an iphone or the inside of an ipad you know and one of the designers you know was was showing steve jobs certain things about the device and he asked a question about something that was designed inside the device and one of the responses that he got well you know mr jobs uh nobody will see that thing you're asking about it's on the inside of the device and his response was i know it's like that i'm seeing it even though the public will not interact with that design on the inside it is there it bothers me it is not it is not product perfection it is not the way i want to see it because he was as interested in the inside of the device as the outside of the device and many of us we are we we put on this external show what the external is is what is important to us and the reality is on the inside that others may very seldom see or never see there are some crossed wires some some circuits that not designed just right that should bother us but because we believe nobody ever gets exposed to it you know it it could pass it's okay and the reality as you look through scripture to see how god shapes his men and deals with his men and brings the shape thing of character into view god is and i would dare say more interested in what cannot be seen than what you see he is more interested in what in what people don't know about you than what they know about you because the true character and person of who you are is locked up in what people do not see it is impossible for people to see the the hidden envy and the and the hidden jealousies and the the hidden challenges that that you try to lock up inside of you but god sees it and it matters to him and he's not satisfied with the external and i'm saying to myself if somebody like steve jobs who is a natural man you know could be that obsesses you would they use if you if you study the the business life of steve jobs they would said he was obsessed about product perfection it was an obsession for him obsessed means a disproportionate amount of time is spent focused on something you know it it consumes your thinking it wakes you up in the morning because you're not satisfied until it operates a certain way you're not satisfied until it works a certain way you're not satisfied until certain metrics are achieved or certain things are accomplished you know and i'm thinking if a natural man could be so obsessed about his ability to have something that he could even perfect or better than how much is god interested in seeing a perfect man walk the earth how how much is god interested in putting things in place to see you come to perfection you know so it's it's inspiring to us to see true scripture through the word how god is is is is hiding things for us to see the shaping of his sons and and shaping of his daughters so tonight by the grace of god i uh have a little thought that i want to share with you tonight and uh i will preface it by a scripture um which is not our substantive scripture but i do want to you know take a a a a line you don't have to find it because we want to go into the old testament but in matthew 5 and verse 9 the bible said blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god so it means that there's you know ecclesiastes speaks of a time of of war and a time for peace and you know it takes wisdom and understanding and knowledge to be able to rightly divide the world to place in context what should be in context but there's a blessing with being a peacemaker because the peacemakers are the ones who are called the children of god and you know as you look through life and the challenges of life and i want to come into your home this evening if you'll allow me to do so uh conflict is part of life there's conflict in the workplace there's conflict in families there's conflict and so many things and and and and my text or my thought tonight is are you a peacemaker that is the question i want to ask each question tonight are you a peacemaker so for a title for this bible study tonight it's are you a peacemaker a study of abigail so that's the thought tonight are you a peacemaker a study of abigail and to find this we're going to now go to our our subject which is found in first samuel 25 first samuel 25 and we will you know operate in that chapter for this teaching tonight first samuel 25. everybody feeling fine so first samuel 25 starts interestingly and this is the kind of stuff that excites me because i've realized that words words are more important than we realize it's only recently i was sharing my brother over the words are so powerful if you understand how powerful words are and how the words in the right order has an impact and how god doesn't play around with words because every spoken word has the ability to create and words in the right order has the ability to heal words in a different order has the ability to hurt people words rearranged have the ability to strip someone of their confidence words in a certain order if you take a certain you know quantity of words and put them in a bucket and you arrange them a certain way you can motivate your child or you could discourage your child you could rearrange those words to help your wife or to break her down you can rearrange those words to accelerate war or to create peace you can rearrange those words to to change your disposition to change your outlook on life you know and when you read the word we call the bible the word i begin to have a greater respect of how god inspired the written word and the insight of the revealed word on the written word so you have to take it together and i found myself in recent times uh asking questions and and and and i was sharing my brother over there i want to speak to the church on questions and the power of questions and you know so first samuel 25 starts off and samuel died now that alone just stops me and samuel died because it is not just three words and samuel died is more than three words because and samuel died automatically means the end of an era it means a line in isan is drawn and samuel died it means the person who was doing certain things was no longer there and samuel died now the book of samuel and the character of samuel is one of the most interesting in scripture and i don't know if you've ever studied the character of samuel but i wanted to just highlight a few things about samuel because the fact that this chapter that we are reading starts off with his death places a context on what is to follow we can't advance beyond this until we address this the fact that samuel is now dead and what samuel's debt also represents so i just want to read it and then come back to this and samuel died and all the israelites were gathered together and lamented him and buried him in his house at ramah and david arose and went down to the wilderness of paran so we see a context we see a few things happening here samuel's death has brought together all the israelites so it's a single force a single act it is what we will call today like a state funeral it is as if the president of a country were to pass on but why would the death of samuel have such an impact that's one question that i ask the other question i have is israel is gathering and if you study from first samuel to uh of chapter one to chapter 24 we would see a number of times where samuel is rebuking people correcting people telling people what to do and what not to do and for the most part they ignore him consistently but his death they rally around him and they're lamenting and they're crying some scholars would actually call it hypocritical because the man who you did not listen to you did not pay attention to suddenly you are there crying at his death but the reality is during his life you never regarded him this samuel who is now dead is the same samuel who lamented when they wanted to get a king and and he cried to god saying what to do and god said they haven't rejected you they have rejected me this same samuel was the one who told them if you choose this road there will be consequences to your actions and the bible says despite his warnings despite his admonitions despite his encouragement they still chose to do what they wanted to do but yet his death brings a state funeral and they are lamenting the death of samuel before i go on i just want to highlight a few things about samuel that i want us to consider we will recall that samuel is one of the few characters in scripture whose birth is carefully described many characters in scripture we don't have much information about their birth however we find with samuel we see a broken sad hannah who cannot give birth is there the altar crying because she wants to have a child and she's praying to god and she makes a promise to god that she has a child that she would she would give that child over to the lord and in so doing god hears a prayer in fact the bible says god remembered her and she gives birth to a young baby named samuel who is the only character in scripture that actually is simultaneously a prophet a judge and the priest of all the titles you could have in the old testament there are only four titles that have been shared throughout the old testament we have prophets we have judges we have priests and we have kings samuel is the only character who effectively totally carries all of these titles except the title of a king he's a prophet he's a priest and he's actually the very last judge so samuel's death is extremely significant because in samuel's death was the death of the last judge that ever ruled israel in samuel's death was also the death of the first prophet of the lines of prophet and i can reference it in scripture in fact uh in the book of acts let me just uh say it here acts 3 24 you you don't have to find it and uh likewise all the prophets were spoken from from samuel and his successors onward so in let me just just get it quickly this is acts 3 24. yea and all the prophets from samuel and those that follow after as many as i've spoken have likewise what all of these days so in the book of acts we see preaching that places samuel as the first of the line of prophets now we know before samuel the major prophet that would have existed would have been moses but after moses there was this break because after joshua's death it was all george's so samuel was the last judge and the first of the line of prophets and we know samuel is also a priest so i'm placing our context here because we are building to something in his role as prophet in his office as priest he was also the only one well he was the one to anoint the first king of israel now i want us to appreciate the fact that when we when we knock saul as the first king the reality is saul was a god-appointed king i wanted to be very very cautious when we throw saul out and say well well well i found a better king i found a better man in david but the reality is when saul was appointed king this was also god's blessing upon soul so samuel was the only one to have witnessed the creation of the monarchy as it were so he anointed two kings but at the point of his death he only saw one king because david was still coming into power all right so i just lay enough background on the context of what's happening here in samuel's act of anointing kings plural two kings he also created a situation of of great conflict not that he pushed it or accelerated it but the reality is because of saul's two acts of disobedience there were two acts of disobedience that saul had one was he was supposed to wait until samuel came and samuel was supposed to come in in seven days and because he didn't use samuel he take it upon himself to offer a sacrifice and someone said well this will be god because of this there are consequences but it was the second act when god remembered what the amalekites did the children of israel and he ordered saul to go and kill them when saul decided to make a command decision and save somebody the animals and save king aegon and he make a judgment call and god said listen that is not what i instructed you to do and then it was at that point that the kingdom was taken from saul so when you look at scripture if saul had obeyed god it would have been a different trajectory now we understand god and predestination we understand god for so all of these but i want us to understand that connection between decisions and consequences because the bible makes it very clear that it was upon that failure of soul to act upon the instructions that came from god that broke the kingship and at that point samuel steps in to now anoint david while saul is still on the throne david anointed the bible said when david was anointed that the spirit of god came upon him from that moment and at that exact same moment that evil spirit came upon saul so samuel is connected to all of these great activities when we hear about a man after god's own heart samuel was instrumental in the unfolding of this just let me lay a couple quick points and we're going to get to our subject so samuel is a miracle child and this scripture we're reading here saying that this great miracle child has now gone on samuel name means name of god he is from the tribe of levi he is the last judge he anoints the first two kings of israel he is the first of the line of prophets he is a priest you can read them first time you have he offered sacrifices he's a nazarite so like samson his here was not cut he is also the only ghost we meet in the context that saul went to the witch of endor to raise samuel back up again in second chronicles the bible said that there was celebrated a passover like no passover compared to the days of samuel so samuel was credited in scripture with the greatest of passovers samuel is remembered for his prayers because in psalms 99 it references samuel prayers so samuel is unique and and startling to some we have first and second samuel but samuel has not mentioned at all in second samuel and samuel died and with him died a history things he would have seen emotions that he would have felt god would have seen how long will you mourn for saul all of this is wrapped up in the death of samuel at a time when king david is on the run for students of scripture we can't get into all of it now but first samuel 25 the scripture we are in tonight is at a point in time when this heat this conflict this issue between saul and david is at a point where david is running for his life and although david is running for his life the death of samuel cannot even bring david into reconciliation with saul or even bring david to even attend the funeral everybody with me so again we're building and samuel died and all the israelites were gathered together and lamented him and buried him in his house at rima and david arose and went down to the wilderness of parents i want us to appreciate the fact that he is clearly not heading to where everybody else is heading because of obviously saul's eating it the bible says in verses in two chapters before saul every day was looking for david the anointing i was upon david we will recall that in in in in a few chapters before david would have dealt with goliath and it's interesting because the bible said david was saul's armor bearer david was saul's musician and it was only after goliad was killed saul is inquiring whose david father is so it is as if it's just a little boy that's around he he's not too significant he carried my armor he played music and stuff but when he killed goliath saul takes him now fully under his wings until the sisters got anointed to write a special and when they wrote this song the song is what started changing relationship the song was that saul killed thousands but david killed ten thousands and that song got soul so affected the bible said he got so angry that he processed that song to mean that the only thing that david don't have now is he tron meaning he have everything else that's how saul was so affected so this is the context so by the time we come the first samuel 25 i want us to also see the picture of david the picture of david didn't do anything to getty people's attention he didn't do anything to to try to displace soul in fact he had been a very good servant a very good student everything he had done to this point was in character of being in favor with god and favor with men he hasn't tried to undermine saul in any way he was living out something but i want to draw attention to call it king making there's a phrase that is used more in the political ring about king makers king makers are the individuals who influence decisions about kingship and leadership and and they help shape somebody who is about to go speak and how you should act and the people are around your circle and these things and this scripture we are into tonight is about king making so this title tonight could have been the making of a king but i want to focus on abigail because she helped she was almost a hell being a king maker but her approach is what i wanted to learn from tonight anybody wait with me so i want to before i go further make very clear that david being on the run was not accidental david being on the run was character formation that he didn't even understand i wanted to understand that with god there's no accident so people go through different experiences for job it was loss of certain things anybody with me different experiences you go through for god to shape the kind of character he wants because this king is the king out of whom son of david would come anybody with me so david as son of david and we talked about judah as we were dealing with joseph it was god taken his sons through certain experiences so that certain things can happen out of their lives anybody with with me all right so let's build a little bit and samuel died and all the israelites are gathered together and lamented him and buried him in his house at rhema and david arose and went down to the wilderness apparent which basically means he's not in the same direction with everybody else he still has to operate outside of the circle of this as much as david would like to pay his respects he really can't because saul will kill him if you see him anybody with me all right verse two let's go and there was a man in my own whose possessions were in camel and the man was very great and he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats and he was sharing his sheep in camel sharing his sheep in camel and possessions in common and in my own is the same thing like saying he running a conglomerate he is so vast in his business efforts that although he is in my own his reach his influence his spread is in the camel he actually have a sharing operation that's removed from his physical location because he is just that big everybody with me he is successful he is wealthy when the bible says you're very great you're very great there's no argument we can have about it the bible said the man was very great whose possessions were in camel all right three now the name of the man was neighbor now whenever there are many instances in scripture where the name is not given so the bible said there was a certain man who did this it was a certain man who did this there was for example the sunnah might woman there's no name given she says he shouldn't my woman but when the bible tells you the man name it is not accidental it is very deliberate so the name of the man was neighbor neighbor means fool so the fact that the bible highlights his name is to bring reference to names are important names have meaning names characterize the nature of a person all right so let's let's go so now the name of the man was neighbor and the name of his wife abigail and she was a woman of good understanding and of a beautiful countenance in fact in all of scripture this might be the only time where there is a description of beauty and intelligence together like this in scripture just characterizing this woman name abigail she was a woman of good understanding which in the amplified it says she was intelligent and beautiful in appearance but the man was chillish which means harsh and evil in his doings and he was of the house of caleb of the house of caleb is almost like saying we could expect better because we know his we know caleb's pedigree anybody with me so we have a situation here of a marriage of non-equals an inconvenient marriage on the left corner of this battle we have a woman who is beautiful and understanding and on the right corner we have a man who is chillish evil in his doings what a mismatch in this relationship what a relationship nightmare when we have the temperament of one person being of good understanding it didn't just say understanding you know good understanding you can have understanding but when the bible say you have good understanding that's a little higher than just understanding there's a lot i can say there but i will see the lord will bring it a little later on verse 4 and david heard in the wilderness that nabal did share his sheep five and david sent out 10 young men and david said unto the young men get you up to carmel and go to neville and greet him in my name so you can see david despite the pressure he is under despite the fact that he is hiding despite the fact he's on the run he is still operating with courtesy he hears of this man named neighbor he doesn't know him he doesn't know his character he doesn't know he's serious he doesn't know he's evil in his doings but out of him being on the run he's looking for some level of fellowship some level of relationship he said go to camel and go to naval and greet him in my name and thus shall he say to him that live it in prosperity peace be brought to thee and peace be to thine house and peace be unto all that thou hast now that's a powerful greeting so we see david extending only positive greetings peace be to thee peace be to thine house and peace be unto all that thou has and he's continuing and now i have heard that dao has sharers which are the people who are taking care of the sheep now thy shepherds which were with us we heard them not neither was there ought missing unto them all the while they were in carmel so basically what is unfolding before us is that david and his men had obviously encountered the sharing crew that belonged to naval and had obviously spent a little time with him everybody with me and he is sending now a report of the encounter that he has been having with nabel's men verse 8 ask thy young men and they will show thee so david is saying we encountered your men and rebelled my davis and you run with the army and he not only run you know having a social movement it's his season soldiers with him david is on the run at any point he can meet the reigning king so he's in a fighting mood you are fighting men and he's saying we encountered your men thy shepherds we heard them not so we encountered them we didn't touch them we didn't hurt them neither there was earth missing unto them meaning we didn't take anything from them all the while they were in camel somehow we run into each other we didn't touch your people we said in peace and greeting unto you ask thy young men so don't ask us you ask your own men and they will show you wherefore let the young men find favor in thine eyes for we come in a good day give i pray thee whatsoever commented thy hand unto thy servants unto my son david so i wanted to understand the context that was building here i don't know if you ever studied this before but basically david is saying we encountered your men we had them with us we didn't hurt them we didn't take anything from them we basically protected them ask them they will tell you we didn't hurt them we didn't take in them so we want you to give us whatever is in your heart to bless us with because your men were out here unprotected and we protected them we didn't rub them we didn't take anything with them bless your people so this is david i want us to see a king in the making because he's an iran reaching almost a point of desperation now he has a need and he is asking a very wealthy man listen whatever on your heart to bless us bless us now verse 9 we're not going to meet too long tonight and when david's young men came they speak the naval according to all those words in the name of david and ceased so they basically went and communicated to them and the bible says then they waited that cease means they expressed what david said to express we met your men on the road we we encountered them we didn't take anything from them we didn't fight with them in fact they were with us so they were obviously on our protection we're looking for a little blessing we need you know something give us a little something for protecting them verse 10 a neighbor answered david's servant and said who is david and who is this son of jesse there be many servants nowadays that break away every man from his master so this question who is david is not a question about identity it is like god asking adam adam where now in the garden of eden he wasn't asking adam of his location because obviously he knew his location he was asking adam of his spiritual position where are you you're not where i left you i left you in power now you're not in power left in dominion now we're letting dominion left you in charge now you just give up your seat so the question who is david it's impossible for neighbor to not know who david was because one if you knew saul you would have seen him around seoul as amabera two if you ever went to the palace you'd have seen their playing music three everybody heard about in the encounter of goliath so it's impossible for you to not know trust me the song was the song everybody was singing soul came thousands david killed ten thousands then if all of those four points didn't bring knowledge of david to your attention the fact that saul made an edict to find david and it was something that was expressed throughout all the land and in fact that saul himself spent a disproportionate amount of time hunting for david made nabel knew exactly who he was the question neighbor was asking was one of a question to create insult it was a question to say david is a nobody who is david who does he think he is who he feel he is coming up here asking for anything who is this son of jesse the fact that you're asking son of jesse is even like a foot in insult meaning what line you come from there'll be many servers down with this that break every man from his master so this statement break from his master is is could be a something is a hit against the perceived break between david and saul a couple of people running around there who who break from their leadership you know they don't want to subject yourself you know who is this david right listen to verse 11. shall i then take my bread and my water and my flesh that i have killed for my shearers and give it unto men whom i know not when they be so neighbor know that is food that i'm looking for now i want to understand the context david is on the run he has very little places where he can be safe because saul is still king it's food he wants so dear neighbor is smart enough to know that his food that he's interested in he says shall i take my bread and my water and my flesh that i've killed for my shearers and give it unto men whom i know not when they be so david's young men turned their way basically to back around and went again basically and returned and came and told david these things everybody with me tonight and verse 13 and david sent unto his men good ye on every man his sword david says strap up and they girded on every man his sword and david also girded on his sword and they went up after david about 400 men and 200 are bored by this stuff so basically it now makes clear that david was rolling with about 600 you know the mighty men of david these were not soldiers who won payroll these are soldiers who know they're rolling with the future king these are soldiers who prepare to die these are the soldiers who just got to the enemy for a drink of water these are a different breed of men david was so angry and this is what i want to build now david got so angry at the response of naval that he took two thirds of his men 400 left 200 to guard the provisions and the supplies that he had to head to deal with neighbors insulins verse 14 but one of the young men this is one of neighbors young men we're dealing with now told abigail neighbor's wife saying behold david sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master and he railed on them in the amplified that says one of neighbors young men told abigail neighbor's wife listen david sent messengers out of the wilderness to bless greet our master and he shouted at them in contempt you remember when i said earlier who is david that's contempt it was derogatory it was insolence it was disrespectful and the young man goes on explaining to abigail in verse 15 but the men were very good unto us and we were not hurt neither missed we anything as long as we were conversant with them when we in the fields listen now to what was taking place that is now coming out they were a wall unto us bored by night and day all the while we were with them keeping the sheep so in the amblyfire it says they were a wall of protection to us both night and day all the time that we were them tending the sheep now therefore know and consider what thou will do for evil is determined against our master and against all his houseful for he is such a son of belial that a man cannot speak to him now have you ever met people who you can't talk to them you can't get a word in by them because influence them so this young man who worked for the neighbor is communicating to his wife listen i don't know if you're aware of it because the master don't even know what already took place but while we were out there david men were protecting us they didn't ask for anything did they do anything they sent greetings the actual whatever the master want to give and he spoke to them in contempt send them away i don't know what you want to do over the matter but i don't know who could talk to this man because nobody could reach this man nobody could influence this man all right anybody with me verse 18 then abigail made haste now this is really powerful this woman of good understanding this woman of beauty this woman of character this woman who is a decision maker this woman who sees the consequences of actions made haste the bible said she hurried and took 200 loaves and two bottles of wine and five sheep ready dressed and five measures of parched corn and 100 clusters of raisins and 200 cakes of figs and laid them on asses and she said unto her servants go on before me behold i come after you but she told not her husband neighbor so this woman has the wisdom to see the context of the situation because you recognize if nothing is done david is so angry now bear in mind david don't know her david don't know who in the house david is just so angry of the contempt and the disrespect now i don't know you know their situation like the last straw that bring the camel back david has been on the run for a while the man is hungry he air asks for a salary for protection he acts a little food to eat and it's almost like listen if i fed up i fed up running i fed up this this this need to stop today this might have been prosperity for it he don't want to bless us so david is angry but that anger that david has is not the anger that a king should have anybody with me so there's something in david that needs to be addressed so i want to that's why i said this chapter is about king making as much as it is about peacemaking because what is in david what is being expressed in david god could not allow that so i want to see the deeper lessons here despite you see the lesson david is being taught here is sometimes your efforts and your actions you might think you deserve something for it but you you that level of this year's entitlement remember we dealt with entitlement some weeks back david felt that he was entitled to be compensated for what he did so his anger understand this neighbor didn't owe him a no i wanted to see the perspectives here he didn't enter into a contract of service with nabel he didn't go to navel and say listen i have security forces we're going to come and protect a man when we finish just protection detail this is what we wanted to get paid for david offered a service without being asked and then it seems he want to lock the man neck to pay him for service demanding order now on the one hand we could empathize with david's men being a wall of protection around it but what right does david have of entitlement to say neighbor have to pay me they will have to give me something so these are call it the issues that have to come to the fore that sometimes we process things in our mind that will put us in trouble anybody with me so here you have a situation that the bible has many stories about men but here we have a a woman being used in a powerful way to influence a king who is not yet a king and she has the wisdom because she is in a relationship that is a traumatic relationship the servant is saying to her you know your husband don't listen to nobody and it is evident from her actions that he husband was even listening to her because if he was willing to listen to her she could have gone to him and make him change his mind the fact that the bible said she told not her husband meant she didn't feel comfortable to go to him it meant that automatically she knew that if she did go to him the response she would get would not be this response so this is a woman who is willing to take a risk for a bigger purpose she's willing to take a risk for her household she's willing to understand the consequences of inaction because now that information was presented to her she had a choice and she had to make a decision out of limited options tell my husband wasting time option one dead do something about it that's our next option sit down and cry that's the next option lock myself in your room next option just take my horse and ride away into the sunset next option she had options she was in a this could almost be described as an abusive relationship this was her opportunity to get out if she had malicious nature in her heart the knowledge that david was coming to wipe out this man who was chillish who was harsh who was evil in his doings the opportunity had effectively presented herself for her to take her and her hand millions of people say let's just ride to that other mountain and spend the evening there and when david finished wipe out everybody we can go back but here it was in the face of it a woman of good understanding stands out making a great decision anybody with me but she told not her husband neighbor and it was so verse 20 as she rode on the ass that she came down by the covet of the hill and behold david and his men came down against her and she met them so i want us to understand the context in the ambiface it said it happened that as she is riding on a donkey and coming back by the way of the hidden part of the mountain that suddenly david and his men were coming down toward her and she met them so i want us to picture the drama that's unfolding here is this one woman riding a donkey and she meets david and 400 heavily armed very hungry angry men men who if david say kill will kill fight fight good them fellas just ready for anything you know in life it takes great skill to call it de-escalate situations as a father as a parent as a leader your choice of actions can either make things worse or make things better how could one woman face against our army you have to have wisdom to de-escalate you know there's some people who when they get angry you can't talk to them it takes you know people make horrible decisions out of anger what david was showing here is akin to almost having a temple he was out of control you know this what was being how can you kill a man because you ask him to bless you with whatever you want to and here bless you so you decide to kill him this is what david was on his way to do a lot of people don't know this existence so this is david not yet king yet no saul is still on the throne but david cannot be king unless this issue is dealt with and we will see how it calls out later on verse 20 again and it was so as you wrote on the eyes that she came down by the culvert of the hill and behold david and his men came down against her and she met them now david had said listen to david's thinking and i wanted to think because this applies to parents it applies to bosses it applies to relationships and i'm going to give the examples in a bit now david had said surely in vain have i kept all that this fellow had in the wilderness so that nothing was missed of all that pertain unto him and he had requited me evil for good in the amplified it says now david had said so this is david seeing in his heart in his mind this is what he's riding with this is what is riding him this is what affected him surely in vein i have protected and guarded all that this man has in the wilderness so that nothing was missing of all that belonged to him and he has repaid me evil for good it is as if you're saying i waste my time protecting him it's as if you're saying i waste my time sending my child to school it's as if you say i waste my time doing some activity that you felt or you had a desire to do and you ever get a return or the response from me that you wanted so david's anger is based on the fact that he feels he wasted his time protecting this man's assets and because he didn't behave the way david expected david is saying the response i expected is not what i'm getting that is in other words he had too much expectation of how neighbor was supposed to respond and our disappointments and frustrations in life are many times because we get disappointed by what other people do or don't do but i want us to appreciate the fact that david was missing the reality that nothing you do as a person can ever control what another person does it's either you're doing it from your heart or you're not doing it at all but you cannot sit down and say if i do something this is what i really expect in return and if the person doesn't do what you want to return you're ready to kill them that is not christ-like behavior yes david was a man after god's own heart but he had some issues that were being brought to before that god was about to deal with anybody with me how many times have we gotten angry with people because we felt we did something for them as a favor i wanted to catch it as a favor they didn't ask us to do it we do something for them as a favor and then we now upset that their return whatever we thought should be returned and in so doing we ready to ready 400 men i want us to to check it and see it with the word now right good so now verse 21 now david had said surely and vin have i kept all of this fellow hat in the wilderness sorry and vienna waste my time i should not do it i regret doing it i wouldn't do it again i thought i was doing something good i had good intentions i thought that if i do this the man would at least give a piece of bread a little piece of water something this is not right nobody respect my effort that has been doing all the thing and nobody's seen what they're doing because what david did was in secret it was not in public it was not neighbor didn't know what was going on check this i want us to catch this you have to know why you're doing what you're doing in secret and what you expect out of it you cannot get angry when you do something from your heart because it's either from your heart or not from your heart even from your heart you have to you're going all in anybody with me i want to reframe your thinking on these issues because they affect us i do this thing for f for my wife she didn't even know i do it i went to the backyard and i cut the grass i cut it thing it changed and however and i [Music] don't ask me to do that again this is this is i want to see the practical thing i remember you have young children young people you're you're you're supposed to do house shows i hope everybody have house shows i hope parents giving their young ones house shows you know things to do when you have your house chose to do your parents don't owe you compensation you know there's this this is back this is some serious entitlement issues you know i feel i waste my time i waste my time up in the house yes because i told when i mop it that i will get something i i waste my time cleaning my my father to me do so and so i do it um you know in fact i do a little extra and when i tell him i do extra he even do anything about it whatever it is all right so david had said surely in vienne have i kept all of this fellow hat in the wilderness so that nothing was missed of all that pertaining to him and he had requited me evil for good verse 22 we almost done so and more also do god unto the enemies of david if i leave all that potato here by morning light anywhere piss it against the wall so david say may god do so to the enemies of david and more also if by morning i'll leave alive any one male of who belonged to him so david said because i decided to protect this man and he didn't repeat his favor to me every living male are gone kill you see this level how your unrealized expectation can lead you to do something to get you into problems and when abigail saw david verse 23 she hasted and lighted off the ass and fell before david on her face and bowed herself to the ground again i want this to notice the approach because she is about to de-escalate the situation remember the question here the teaching is are you a peace maker because if there ever was the need to make peace this was it david was on the verge of doing something that he would have to regret for the rest of his life god give us more peacemakers who can step in before we do things we regret for the rest of our lives but here it was one woman against 401 men about to do an irreparable damaging decision that could prevent david from us ever ascending to the throne and here it is she comes off sit goes down on her knees and bow down and fell at his feet verse 24 and said upon me my lord upon me let this iniquity be now now this is where this is what you call master craftsmen you know countries go to war for many things the office there are certain offices uh uh ministers of of of of trade and and ambassadors and international relations and the secretary of state of the us and these kind of roles are supposed to help bridge issues of relationship between countries and and armies and these things here it is this woman had nothing to do with the current situation she did not speak to david's men she didn't say don't give them no food she was out of the conversation at the very beginning but look at her approach to de-escalating the situation she said upon me oh lord in other words it's my fault let this inequity be that's powerful the effect of this and david how david automatically had to reframe his thinking she says upon me my lord upon me let us iniquity be and let thine handmaid i pray thee speak in that audience and hear the words of the anime she said it's my fault it's my fault i am to blame hear me out hear me out what's the work of a master peacemaker too many of us like the arguments you know she has say you're wrong you're wrong you're wrong you're crazy you say listen i am to blame i'm to blame i'm to blame give me a little word let's hear me out listen to verse 25. let not my lord i pray thee regard this man of belial in the amplified they said please do not my lord pay attention to this worthless man neighbor [Music] for as his name is so is he you remember i made a statement that the fact that his name was called is relevant to what is happening here and we see now why is relevant because she is using his name as part of the peacemaking she said as his name is so is he nabal is his name and folly is with him so this man is admitting that she have a husband who i can't finish it she has a husband who's a fool except that he don't know he's a fool let not my lord i pray the regard this man of belial even nabel for as his name is so is he nabal is his name and folly is with him but i then hand me it so not the young men of my lord whom thou did ascend so you say the man who spoke to them is a fool i didn't encounter your men so let us reframe what we're about to do now therefore my lord as the lord live it and as i so live it seeing the lord had withholding thee from coming to shed blood and from avenging thyself with thine own hand now let thine enemies and they that seek evil to my lord be as neighbor so i want to read it again in the amplified so now my lord as the lord lives and as your soul lives since the lord has prevented you she is speaking in the past and she is appealing to to david on the next level the law has prevented you past tense so she is speaking to him as if he already changed his mind i want to see the level of craftsmanship going on here since the lord she is also not taking credit herself for what's happening right now she this one woman of good understanding and beauty is ministering onto a future king she is coaching a future king she is mentoring a future king she is guiding a future king and she has not even taken credit for it she said since the lord has prevented you from shedding blood and from avenging yourself by your own hand now then let your enemies and those who seek to do evil to my lord be as self-destructive as neighbor so she's saying this man is imploding himself verse 27 we're almost done and now this blessing which thine handmaid had brought unto my lord let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord so you're saying i bring the gift all the food you're looking for i pray thee forgive the trespass of dying handmade you see she tried to defend neighbor she said the man is a foolish man you make a foolish decision i am here pleading face case what i find is so powerful is that she know she's living with her worthless money amplified that she said worthless man and she didn't even say david david watch now i don't mind nick illumina i really am mine you know because i fed up i fed up you're already talking to him you know i telling him to change who is and he has listened to me i try i try god knows that's right this is a wife in action dunk to the end she's still defending us but although he's a fool i pray verse 28 forgive the trespass of thy handmaid for the lord will certainly make my lord a short house so she actually beginning to prophesy about david now so she is now switching gears from pleading and repositioning his thinking to now speaking into his life all right i pray he forgive the trespasser then handmade so in other words forgive the transgression now she do anything wrong but she's saying forgive me and she's about to say certain things for the lord will certainly make my lord a short house because my lord fighted the battles of the lord and evil had not been found in all the ideas so she's beginning to plead and prophesy in a whole next level in other words up to this point in time evil has not been found in lee that is real there so she is checking david and his decision-making and his current action with up to this point you haven't done anything that will ruin your testimony anybody with me yet a man has risen to pursue thee so they all know what's going conquest yet a man is risen to pursue thee and to seek thy soul but the soul of my lord shall be born and the situation this is the this is the climax of what he has been going through all the time is that he last straw so she is not just and it shows great wisdom she's not addressing just the issue with neighbor now she's going to the root cause of the problem is saying yet a man is risen to pursue thee speaking about saul and to seek thy soul but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the lord thy god in other words this woman of good understanding had a good understanding of exactly what was bothering david david was angry he was upset he didn't have a place to put his head at night because he had to be on his move all along he said by doing a good effort he was going to get a little food to eat we don't know when last he ate we didn't even last he slept well he had to keep moving because saul was hunting him and he felt if he could just sit down and rest and eat and take a pause and refresh he can fight another day and here it was after doing a good deed this insolent rich man who had the means to help him refuse to do it how could he do that and here is abigail the great peacemaker is first apologizing first thing is a fool you're dealing with first thing i bring food for you first saying i'm bring food for your men but now she goes to the root cause of the issue david i'm nowhere really going on i know the anger you have is not really at neighborhood verse 29 again placing it in context yet a man is risen to pursue thee after she said no evil has been found in thee you have had a testimony we heard the testimony we hear about goliath we heard of the victories your testimony has raised the whole land your whole land knows who you are david what are you doing what are you doing now why are you doing this yet a man has risen to pursue thee and to seek thy soul but the soul of my lord look she's given him comfort shall be bound in the bundle of life with the lord thy god in other words god will protect your soul and they sold of thy enemies and them shall he sling out as out of the middle of a sling and she's relating to david in a language he can understand because we know about david and his sling talk about the woman of good understanding she is ministering with complete knowledge of david's position his condition his understanding the fact he was a shepherd in fact he would know she's using an analogy he can relate to i want us to catch the depth of understanding upon ministering to him she is using this sling as an analogy because she knew david knows what a sling is and how it could be used he says them shall he sling out us out of the middle of a sling anybody with me verse 13 and it shall come to pass when the lord shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he had spoken concerning v so she is now tapping into what the lord has spoken considering him which would have come to the prophet samuel and shall have appointed the ruler over israel so she is already speaking she already saying you will be ruler when it shall come to pass when the lord shall have done so she is already speaking now in the i don't even know what tensei has called let's know the english experts could guide me when the lord shall have done to my lord she was he speaking future past tense i don't know but when the lord would have done all he said concerning you all the good he had spoken concerning thee and shall have appointed the ruler over israel listen now that this here right now this moment shall be no grief unto thee that is powerful she is saying here now listen carefully that this incident will not cause grief or bring a troubled conscience to my lord in other words if you move the wrong way right now this will forever be appearing upon you it will be a negative statement against your ministry against your testimony you haven't messed up before but if you do this act right now all that god will have promised to you will still come to pass you know but this will ruin your testimony so in that short message she gave to david she de-escalated the situation she brought context she brought what he wanted she snapped him back to reality she identified he would cause the problem and she now address the future and the wisdom of don't let this experience taint your testimony that this shall be no grief unto thee or pain unto thee no offense of heart unto my lord that's conscious that you will be sitting on the throne regretting that you made this move this decision that is not well thought out either that doll has shed blood cause less in other words she's saying if you act now there's no cause there's no reason for you to act this way how many times have we acted when there's no cause there's no reason to do so so she's telling david stop think think think think before you act any further before you do anything else think because you have a future you have a destiny you have a purpose there's a prophecy over your life and you have a point you have a chance now to make a decision and how you decide will determine the kind of testimony it'll determine your resume you don't want to regret doing the wrong thing anybody with me or that my lord had avenged himself but when the lord shall have dealt well with my lord then remember thine handmade so she also now say after all of that when the lord so she already speaking knowing that her argument is so convincing to david that when you reach your position don't forget me because my intervention here is helping guide you to kingship anybody with me could we could we just bring it to a close a little for a few more minutes would would that be fine verse 32 and david said to abigail blessed be the lord god of israel which sent me this day to meet me hallelujah look at her look look at a king being shaped owned a king who could who could listen to a good argument and say this thing making sense and say blessed be the lord god of israel would send thee this data meet me he recognized that this simple woman was sent by the lord to stop him in his tracks from doing something he should not do and listen to verse 33 and bless me thy advice and bless be thou which has kept me this day from coming to shed blood and from avenging myself with my own hand verse 34 for in very deed as the lord god of israel lived which had kept me back from hurting thee except thou had hastened and come to meet me surely they have not been left unto neighbor by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall so david is saying here in verse 34 nevertheless as the lord of god of israel lives in the amplified who has prevented me from harming you if you have not come quickly to meet me most certainly by the morning light they will not have been left to neighbor so much as one meal so david said if she didn't come quickly by morning every man in that camden so i want us to also understand that when jesus speaks that blessed be the peacemakers listen making peace needs to be a very quick thing you know david is saying if you come if you try to make peace tomorrow all night already i don't know making peace could actually be too late to know let me ask you the ministering question is there something you need to make peace about is there some pending war brewing beneath the surface some action taken or not taken that you need to address don't lie don't go to go for days you don't know who will be there here david said if you didn't come and arrest me right now i don't even know where where i would be all right so david verse 35 so david received of her hand that which she had brought him and said unto her go up in peace to thine house see i have hearkened to thy voice and have accepted thy person what a powerful testimony and it speaks to the character of a man that he can recognize i was making a bad decision there are some people who are wrong and strong they're wrong about to make a wrong decision and people give them good advice and they know it's good advice you know but they don't want to appear changing their mind imagine if david had an ego as you say imagine if david was a trinidadian said i don't reach out here ready i i'm going to buy it how are we going to them back they think are weak what were they thinking let me see arrive at him yes what david was willing to say go up in peace i've heard unto thy voice and i've accepted thy person accepted that person in the amplified means granted your request we're almost done verse 36 and abigail came to neighbor so she going back now and behold he held a feast in his house like the feast of a king no no neighbor is clueless of this whole interchange naval is so out of sync with reality he doesn't even know death was just knocking on his door neighbor doesn't understand that his wife who clearly doesn't have the best relationship with him clearly loves him enough to still save his life and the life of the host and the bible says and ever abigail came back to neighbor and behold he held a feast in his nose like the feast of a king and neighbor's heart was merry within him for he was very drunken wherefore she told him nothing less or more until the morning light when it but it came to pass in the morning when the wine was going out of naval and his wife had told him these things that his heart died within him and he became as a stone so i am not sure the bible doesn't tell us what exactly bothered him about what was said was it he was angry that she went and did what he didn't want to do was he shocked at the fact that death was knocking on his door and he could have died we have no information but the reality is it affected him so much that his heart died within him and he became a stone i think that would be a kinder almost like a stroke because he wasn't dead yet he was just paralyzed in the amplified it says he be in paralyzed and helpless like a stone that is the amplified so when he just shot on and he became a sword in verse 38 and it came to pass after ten days that the lord smote nabel so now this is now this is not here here f in a diagonal he is parallel and the lord's smooth smote is very very specific struck smooth wipe out then he died so the lord stepped in because neighbor had crossed the man after god's own heart so the lord took action there verse 39 and when david heard that neighbor was dead he said blessed be the lord that had pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of naval and had kept his servant from evil for the lord had returned the wickedness of naval upon his own head and david sent and communed with abigail to take her to him to wife and when the servants of david would come to abigail to camel they spake on us saying david sent us unto thee to take thee to him to wife and she arose and bowed herself on her face to the youth and said behold let the handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord and lord a blessing to the reading of his word so a diplomat became david's wife a peacemaker became david's wife a woman of good understanding and duty became david's wife she effectively had had distinguished herself to be a woman who was deserving of the spiritual discerning of the natural discerning on on on when to be discreet and when to move with haste of what to put as the provisions of how to confront a king in the making how to deal with the army on the move all of this was displayed in this woman called abigail key lessons to learn tonight peacemaking blessed are the peacemakers there are many times we'll find situations where conflict is rampant be it in our homes in our families any workplace in business whatever it is it takes great skill to be a peacemaker it takes great understanding to be a peacemaker it takes a good understanding of coming to the root cause of a situation to bring peace but on the flip side we see conflict and a situation he could have derailed david's life forever if abigail had not intervened the story of david would be very different and we see it in both abigail's narrative and david's acknowledgement that it was the lord had intervened to prevent david from doing something that he would regret forever i challenge you tonight on both sides of this spectrum to become a peacemaker because blessed are the peacemakers are you a peacemaker so i challenge you to become a better peacemaker but i also challenge you to take the words of abigail and apply it to your life understanding that like david you two have a purpose you two have a destiny you too have a place to rule because you are priests and kings so as a king that has a destiny as a priest that has a purpose there are some things you cannot do there are some actions you cannot take there are some activities you cannot do and there are some levels of avenging that you cannot indulge in because it will forever taint your testimony guard your testimony guard your future protect your life and use this scripture as an inspiration to you as a reminder of what could have gone wrong what may have been different and above all else if peace has to be made make it quickly make it history don't let your act meet the next day don't let issues just hang any balance don't let issues that could escalate just keep escalating we have to learn to de-escalate we have to learn to make peace we have to learn to live like christ and lastly we have to recognize how god could send people in our lives even tonight this is an invent intervention for somebody who needed to be stopped in their tracks because you might be taking an action or contemplating an action that when you reflect on this and gave his own entitlement when he said in vain i did what i did in other words i wasted my time and many times we feel as if we wasted our time many times we feel we may have done more than people expected we may have done more than we thought we should have done and there's this expectation at least of gratitude what david was looking for was simply gratitude he didn't put a price on what he wanted from neighbor he didn't say neighbor i want x y and z he said as it is in your heart whatever you want to bless us with and he was shocked that neighbor didn't even do anything at all i want us to realize friends that you cannot control what other people do for a brief moment david missed that fact that he had no control over naval and abigail was able to help david to recalibrate to realize he could have only controlled himself and in that moment of contemplation and reflection he was able to recalibrate and say wait a minute thank god you spoke to me because i was acting out of my feelings i wasn't spirit-led i sought no advice i was in my emotion i responded based on how i was feeling and quite honestly as i began writing this end i've been dealing with so many issues in my life that this was like the last straw solved been after me are frustrated and this was the narrative and sometimes in life we have so much going on that we confront this last straw that affects us so much it may push us to the edge of doing something that we will regret let us take a deep breath let us reflect on this tonight and this lesson laying in full samuel 25 and let it be an encouragement and an inspiration to us shall we pray our guest is heavenly father a simple teaching tonight lord of so much that could be said so much that has not been said but i pray tonight lord that lord i was able to lord express it the way that you wanted me to to help somebody i don't know who tonight lord but life is about decisions nabel made a choice and david would say the lord returned evil his evil upon his head his decision returned upon him and our decisions come back upon us we could choose to bless or we could choose to kiss we could choose to love or we could choose to hate we could choose war or we could choose peace we could choose animosity or we could choose forgiveness we could choose mediation and peace or we could choose separation and the breach of relationships in our homes in our lives in our marriages fellowship one with another between friends between relatives between associates between neighbors help us tonight to reflect on these characters to not be a fool like nabel and to be able to reflect if we're in a position to bless we could bless help us to reflect like david there are things we cannot control and we can only control ourselves and we have to realize that we are not entitled help us to reflect on our decisions and how it can impact us help us to be more like abigail a woman of good understanding she understood all of the pieces on the board she understood her husband and her his limitations she understood david and his challenges she understood the approach that was necessary to effect the results that were needed help us to learn from these characters in scripture these characters who are not fictitious but real who walk this earth lived with their challenges and their decisions and their consequences tell their story to this day help us lord teach us lord to be better christians to be better husbands be better wives to be with the young people to be better believers help us to grow to be stronger and above all from this teaching to be peacemakers for blessed are the peacemakers they shall be called the children of god may you bless the service tomorrow night may you bless a prayer meeting this coming friday and me with you may you be with your people we commit your church into your hands in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen amen may the lord bless you tonight have a wonderful night and uh look forward to seeing you in the next time god bless you take care then bye
