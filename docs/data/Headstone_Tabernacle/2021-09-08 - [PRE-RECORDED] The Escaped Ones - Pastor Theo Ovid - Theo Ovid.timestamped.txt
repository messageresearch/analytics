[25:17] bible speaks that it would speak like a
[25:19] dragger
[25:21] and what we are seeing unfolding being
[25:23] thought before
[25:24] right in front our eyes is the
[25:26] uh dismantling of democracy
[25:30] that's what you're seeing the
[25:31] dismantling of democracy it has to
[25:34] happen because the lamb have to speak
[25:36] like a dragon
[25:37] and things have to happen to turn alarm
[25:40] [Music]
[25:41] the dragon
[25:42] and the prophet said they will raise up
[25:44] a pharaoh
[25:46] that knew not joseph
[25:48] and joseph represent freedom of religion
[25:52] see so therefore it will be a
[25:55] system
[25:56] and take away the freedom from the
[25:58] people
[25:59] freedom of religion and i want to just
[26:01] uh go back to revelation chapter 13 and
[26:05] read something from there there was tree
[26:07] said i saw one of his heads talking
[26:08] about the beast he was wounded to death
[26:10] and his deadly one was healed
[26:13] and all the world wandered up after the
[26:15] beast
[26:16] and they worshiped the dragon which gave
[26:19] power unto the beast
[26:21] so the beast have to be empowered let's
[26:23] continue
[26:24] and they worship the beast saying who is
[26:26] like unto the beast
[26:28] who is able to walk with him
[26:33] and there was given unto him a mouth
[26:35] speaking great things
[26:37] and blasphemies and power was given unto
[26:40] him to continue 40 and two months
[26:44] and he opened his mouth and blasphemy
[26:45] against god to blaspheme his name his
[26:48] tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven
[26:50] and it was given unto him to make war
[26:53] with the saints
[26:55] and to overcome them
[26:56] and power was given unto him over all
[26:59] kindreds and tongues and nations
[27:02] this is not skim milk
[27:04] this is the word we're reading here now
[27:06] and all
[27:07] that dwell upon the earth shall worship
[27:10] him
[27:11] whose names are not written in the book
[27:13] of life of the lamb slain from the
[27:15] foundation of the world
[27:17] not some
[27:18] all therefore all those who will escape
[27:24] that's you know
[27:26] the bride we're going to be the ones
[27:27] that are going to be not going to the
[27:29] escape ones
[27:31] everybody else going to worship
[27:33] the beast and the b system
[27:35] watch if any man on air let him hear he
[27:38] that leave it
[27:39] lead it unto captivity shall go into
[27:41] captivity he that killed but the sword
[27:44] must be killed with the sword here is
[27:45] the patience and the fate of the saints
[27:47] and i beheld another beast coming out of
[27:49] the earth
[27:50] he had two horns like a lamb
[27:52] and he spake as a dragon
[27:54] and he exercised all
[27:57] the power of the first beast before him
[28:00] and causing the earth and then that
[28:02] berliner to worship the first piece
[28:05] whose deadly wound was healed which you
[28:07] know was pagan rome to enter papa rome
[28:09] let's continue and he do a great wonder
[28:11] so he making fire come down from the
[28:12] heaven on the earth and the sight of men
[28:15] and they received them that dwell on the
[28:16] earth by the means of those miracles
[28:18] which he had power to do in the sight of
[28:20] the beast saying unto them that well on
[28:21] the earth that they should make an image
[28:24] to the beast
[28:25] which had the wound by a sword and did
[28:28] live
[28:29] hallelujah
[28:30] make what
[28:32] an image unto the beast and he had power
[28:35] to give life unto the image of the beast
[28:37] so the image don't power in itself the
[28:40] image has to be given power
[28:42] hallelujah hallelujah and he had power
[28:46] to give life unto the image of the beast
[28:48] that the image of the beast should both
[28:50] speak
[28:51] and cause that as many as would not
[28:53] worship the image of the beast should be
[28:55] killed
[28:56] and he caused causes all both small and
[28:59] great rich and poor free and burned to
[29:03] receive a mark in their right hand or in
[29:05] their foreheads that no man might buy or
[29:08] sell save he that had the mark or the
[29:11] name of the beast or the number of his
[29:14] name here is wisdom let him that had
[29:17] understanding come the number of the
[29:18] beast for it is a number of a man his
[29:20] number is 600 three score and six six
[29:23] six six is not something tonight oh
[29:26] glory to god should the bible identify
[29:28] the image unto the beast oh praise god
[29:30] you know and the thing of it is in the
[29:32] beginning in genesis god said let us
[29:34] make man in our image and likeness
[29:37] hallelujah and god put an image with
[29:39] first created image isn't that right
[29:41] wasn't flesh man yet and god put this
[29:43] flesh man in the body isn't that right
[29:45] that man couldn't fail that man could
[29:47] not fall that was the original man
[29:50] isn't that right and god completed
[29:52] creation with a man that was in power
[29:55] a man that was in dominion because the
[29:57] man himself as a son had to reflect god
[30:00] and to reflect god you have to reflect
[30:01] his attributes so he said let us make
[30:04] man let him have dominion over over over
[30:06] over everything that creeped upon the
[30:08] earth
[30:09] so man wasn't was supposed to be a
[30:10] conqueror a overcomer a dominator is
[30:14] that right hallelujah man was supposed
[30:16] to be in control of
[30:18] in charge of
[30:20] ruling over
[30:21] that was man and god's original intent
[30:24] but you were by product because eve was
[30:27] a byproduct of the man
[30:28] hallelujah she was that in the original
[30:30] she pulled out of he of man and that
[30:33] became the woman isn't that right satan
[30:35] didn't approach the man he approached a
[30:36] woman we know their story and man fell
[30:39] but god promised to restore
[30:41] praise god you can't catch god in that
[30:43] god promised to restore because god had
[30:45] a plan to bring right man right back
[30:54] and i've got news for you tonight
[30:56] you're living in the verge of the
[30:58] manifestation of the fulfillment of the
[31:01] plan that god had since man fell god
[31:04] always was going to bring back man
[31:07] back to his original condition
[31:09] back to his first creating image so just
[31:11] as the beast of our image we have an
[31:13] image that image is fate
[31:16] virtue
[31:17] knowledge temperance patience goldiness
[31:20] brotherly kindness
[31:22] charity isn't that right
[31:24] and the mystery of god comes from god as
[31:26] the word of god
[31:27] and the word is being preached
[31:29] and the word come as a seed and that
[31:31] image coming to you in seed form
[31:34] by the word of promises and peter said
[31:36] by these promises not by this
[31:38] explanation by these promises you have
[31:41] become a partaker
[31:43] of his divine nature
[31:45] but power
[31:46] shelter power
[31:48] power after coming to that image and we
[31:50] are promised dynamics we are promised
[31:52] charity we are promised the price
[31:54] absolute is not right
[31:56] power to come down
[31:58] oh glory to god hallelujah
[32:01] hallelujah
[32:03] two images
[32:05] going to be empowered
[32:07] you may be seated praise god
[32:09] the image of the beast
[32:11] versus the image of god
[32:13] isn't that something
[32:14] let's continue now
[32:16] anyone who can explain anything you
[32:19] don't have to accept it anymore by faith
[32:22] it is things that we cannot explain
[32:25] that we have to accept by faith
[32:28] we cannot explain god
[32:30] no man can explain god he is sovereign
[32:34] he is great and mighty we just accept it
[32:37] because we know he is there
[32:39] and then by our faith and accepting it
[32:42] he brings the response back to us the
[32:44] baptism
[32:46] of the holy spirit
[32:47] so the baptism of the holy spirit comes
[32:49] in response to your acceptance by faith
[32:54] god is
[32:55] and he's a rewarder of them
[32:57] that diligently seek him

[36:14] do with it
[36:15] all that bill on the earth

[36:39] but when he comes he will guide you to
[36:42] it

[36:45] scene god released a spirit of truth
[36:49] two spirits was unfold on the earth the
[36:51] spirit of truth and the spirit of error
[36:53] but the spirit of truth was sent to
[36:56] guide us to the truth
[36:58] so listen to this part now that's the
[37:00] reason the coming of the seals
[37:03] at the finishing of the seventh seal the
[37:06] mystery of god should be finished to
[37:08] know
[37:09] who god is
[37:11] what he is
[37:12] how he lives his nature his being you're
[37:16] supposed to be all the way up there

[37:22] top of brotherly kindness
[37:23] [Applause]
[37:26] by that time
[37:27] you're supposed to have a faith
[37:29] based on forgiveness
[37:31] by that time
[37:32] by that time there ought to be no odds
[37:35] no grudge no jealousy no malice no
[37:38] foolishness by that time it's just our
[37:41] faith
[37:42] to pull down the cap

[40:09] watch he said the seed of god the word
[40:11] of god jesus said in a certain place the
[40:13] word is a seed and every seed will bring
[40:15] what after its kind now if the christian
[40:18] the children of god the church of the
[40:20] kingdom has become the seed of god
[40:23] then they must be the word of god
[40:25] the word of god manifested in the age
[40:27] that they're living in you shall replace
[40:29] it if the children is the seed then
[40:31] there must be the word
[40:33] word manifested
[40:34] don't get tired not talking with no word
[40:37] manifested
[40:38] hallelujah so when they say the children
[40:40] of the seed and the children had a word
[40:42] would it manifest it so god wants a life
[40:45] from you god wants your life to thunder
[40:48] when you speak the devil must hear
[40:50] hell must know our son and her daughter
[40:53] is walking the street do you believe

[41:04] and what god bless you for
[41:06] [Applause]
[41:12] let me see then
[41:13] okay we are first with children with
[41:16] your husband white children family
[41:17] whatnot and first it's not really fast
[41:20] enough spirits on them
[41:23] amen
[41:24] if god give you the power
[41:26] and you're walking with the anointing
[41:28] and back the spirit offered them they
[41:29] get free you know
[41:31] because they don't even know what on
[41:32] them you know
[41:33] no you're watching flesh and blood the
[41:35] acting so they answer back they ruined
[41:37] this but you have seen the spirit behind
[41:39] that
[41:39] but if they get spread off at that if
[41:41] the child nice the child normally try
[41:43] their bone to be like they want to want
[41:45] to look back like that but something
[41:46] moving upon that child
[41:50] that's why the prophet said when they
[41:51] check up the age of accountability the
[41:52] devil has come and the holy ghost has
[41:54] come
[41:55] and whatever the child leans to used to
[41:58] that is what overtakes the child
[42:00] then you have trouble in schools
[42:02] then afterwards they get the bandits and
[42:03] rubbers and everything else a spirit on
[42:05] them
[42:06] a spirit
[42:07] different spirit
[42:09] mandatory anointing all kinds of
[42:11] alternative employment
[42:16] do that kind of stuff
[42:18] it's a spirit
[42:19] and the prophecy a spirit has to come
[42:21] upon the bride
[42:23] [Music]
[42:27] it wasn't samson muscles it was the
[42:29] spirit
[42:30] upon samson it was the spirit upon david
[42:33] it was a spirit upon the brothers it's
[42:35] not you
[42:36] it's not going to be you
[42:39] is the spirit
[42:40] coming upon you
[42:42] jesus said the spirit
[42:44] is upon me
[42:46] for he hath anointed me
[42:49] oh glory to god
[42:50] [Applause]

[43:08] do i hear a shout in the house
[43:11] oh glory to god hallelujah
[43:13] you may be seasoned
[43:15] that is why the devil fight worship
[43:18] fight the atmosphere
[43:19] fight your worshipping and your praise
[43:21] and life
[43:25] baptised in the is day but have people
[43:26] with itchiness you know what they want
[43:28] teachers
[43:31] not preachers you know
[43:32] they want teachers people that could
[43:34] stimulate the gray matter
[43:39] stimulate the head i never see you so
[43:41] good
[43:44] but that can't fight the devil you know
[43:46] you can explain this the devil you know
[43:48] because that some fellas intellectual
[43:50] thought they could get a gift and the
[43:52] power and say come out devil in the name
[43:54] of of jesus paul preacher
[43:57] come on daryl in the name of jesus and
[43:59] the impersonation
[44:00] the devil said to talk to the man he
[44:02] said paul i know
[44:04] peter i know
[44:06] that talk i don't know you don't have
[44:08] what you're talking about
[44:11] and you spray jump on them and all them
[44:12] get in trouble
[44:13] but when paul comes walking the devil is
[44:15] going left right they say are you saying
[44:17] that devil's moving away why because a
[44:19] man of god is stuck because a son of god
[44:21] is back in the earth somebody who know
[44:23] where they come from know where they're
[44:24] going
[44:25] how much time did they ever back up in
[44:27] your own home back up in your whole
[44:29] house in your own environment you don't
[44:31] even know what to do it's the devil
[44:33] but there's a mind of christ in every
[44:35] situation there's an intelligence behind
[44:37] everything
[44:39] if we can tap into the intelligence
[44:42] it's over
[44:43] oh give the lord a shout praise god
[44:45] praise god praise god
[44:47] praise god praise god
[44:54] every situation

[45:30] more she said i'm going to the prison of
[45:32] the king you're not supposed to go
[45:34] unless you are called
[45:37] did you hear that
[45:39] you're not supposed to go
[45:41] until you were called but this woman
[45:44] she saw the need she saw the hour she
[45:47] saw what was going to happen if she
[45:49] didn't make a move and if you don't make
[45:52] a move you will be hitting this

[46:43] because i said test it because people
[46:45] have a problem with using certain words

[46:53] kindness is when somebody really do you
[46:55] in
[46:56] and you have no you have to forgive them
[46:59] [Applause]
[47:04] and there are situations where you are
[47:06] right
[47:07] and they are wrong and you've forgiven
[47:09] them
[47:11] you've given up your rights to be right
[47:15] and letting it go

[48:54] oh glory to god you can defeat the
[48:56] spirit of god show me once wherever the
[48:58] spirit of god will defeat it in genesis
[49:00] darkness cover the earth and god said

[49:05] began to move upon the water and in
[49:07] every confusion in every darkness and
[49:09] every chaos once the spirit began to
[49:12] move what we need is the spirit to begin
[49:15] to move
[49:16] you can't explain that you can't
[49:18] overtalk that
[49:20] other you can't teach that that is
[49:22] something to be manifested
[49:25] oh give the lord a shout
[49:28] they want teachers having itchiness
[49:31] they are here enough
[49:33] still want to hear more
[49:35] oh glory to god hallelujah
[49:38] praise god praise god praise god
[49:41] amen or if the church and the children
[49:43] of god the church of the kingdom had
[49:44] become the seed of god there must be the
[49:46] word of god the word of god manifested
[49:50] in the aid that they're living in for
[49:52] the promises of that age that is why
[49:55] watch
[49:55] watch
[49:56] we have lived through luther's age
[49:58] wesley age pentecostal age and the
[50:01] pentecostal age each age is given a
[50:03] promise of the word
[50:06] and the people of that age
[50:09] that manifest
[50:11] that promised word
[50:13] is the seed of that age
[50:16] i'm not going to do who the past says
[50:21] the people
[50:23] that manifest
[50:24] the promise of that age
[50:26] so god put brotherly kindness on top
[50:29] and on top of that have the holy spirit
[50:32] because the cap can't come down on top
[50:34] of early candidates that they be called
[50:35] out
[50:38] so they called out is the escaped one
[50:43] be called out is those who escaped
[50:45] laurisia
[50:46] which is heavy high-minded
[50:48] lukewarm
[50:50] god spewed them out the mouth that means
[50:51] church members
[50:53] that is not wise version that is foolish
[50:54] versions
[50:55] the called out is who see the oil
[50:58] who see the holy spirit
[51:01] that is dear you have to get into
[51:03] so that is why he said
[51:05] does if that be so then the seven
[51:08] thunders kept the pyramid
[51:10] then he wasn't identifying the thunders
[51:12] through the ages and that way he was
[51:14] showing their thunders in the holy
[51:16] spirit slot
[51:18] to cap your pyramid
[51:20] the pyramid of your life
[51:22] oh glory to god

[1:02:48] shaken the graves are not gonna shake
[1:02:49] open there will be a resurrection
[1:02:52] because the church will come to
[1:02:53] perfection by manifestation give the
[1:02:55] lord i shall
[1:02:57] always fight for ministry for the
[1:02:59] perfecting sins men flesh men ordinary
[1:03:02] men human beings think that they're
[1:03:03] doing that
[1:03:04] monkey perfect man
[1:03:06] sinful man perfect man they don't
[1:03:08] understand his fifo ministry as
[1:03:10] prophesied by the prophet of william
[1:03:11] branham and he said the fifo ministry is
[1:03:13] the ministry of jesus christ it's not
[1:03:16] this man ministry and that you have a
[1:03:17] great ministry what are you talking
[1:03:18] about that's not the message jesus
[1:03:19] christ you mentioned something different
[1:03:21] all together you have to be given that
[1:03:23] you have to come into that god have to
[1:03:25] put you put that upon you there is not a
[1:03:27] man trying a thing and my church and my
[1:03:30] church is better than everybody else's
[1:03:31] church they foolishness like humans
[1:03:33] business that's not the message jesus
[1:03:35] christ there is one cap there is one
[1:03:38] head there is one head you must
[1:03:39] recognize the headship of jesus christ
[1:03:42] oh glory to god i'm not the head of the
[1:03:44] church he is the head of the body
[1:03:47] called the church
[1:03:49] in that body of fightful ministry in
[1:03:51] that body of believers
[1:03:54] with gifts
[1:03:55] with places
[1:03:57] in that body
[1:03:58] but on top of that body christ alone is
[1:04:00] the head
[1:04:01] could look at the lord i shout
[1:04:04] oh do you see what i'm saying then
[1:04:05] oh glory to god so in the early part of
[1:04:08] bahrain ministry he said i
[1:04:10] said boy
[1:04:12] i represent the faith
[1:04:15] by way of a divine gift
[1:04:19] it's a powerful statement i
[1:04:22] represent the faith by way of a divine
[1:04:26] gift
[1:04:27] the faith didn't come into him yet
[1:04:30] he had a gift of healing
[1:04:35] and that was so powerful to take him for
[1:04:36] jesus christ
[1:04:38] but here was a growth from first pull
[1:04:41] second turtle into the ministry of jesus
[1:04:44] christ
[1:04:45] where god himself was veiled
[1:04:48] in him
[1:04:50] that's why you could say come to the
[1:04:51] unveiling of the mighty god
[1:04:53] oh glory to god and when god was veiling
[1:04:56] him god spoke himself out
[1:04:58] on books and tapes
[1:05:00] in the form of promises
[1:05:02] hallelujah and we catch the promises all
[1:05:05] the preachers catch explanation
[1:05:06] interpretation all kind of crazy
[1:05:08] revelation but what we see is promises
[1:05:11] so when you come to church all you want
[1:05:12] to hear is what you promise
[1:05:14] you want to hear what your inheritance
[1:05:15] is you want to hear what you call on to
[1:05:18] you want to hear what you're here for
[1:05:19] what you must anoint what you must claim
[1:05:21] what you must pull down you know if you
[1:05:23] have a backing confusion and talking
[1:05:25] other people business you're not here
[1:05:26] for that i am not here for that we have
[1:05:28] to speak at the oracles of god
[1:05:31] oh glory to god when we speak we have to
[1:05:33] speak for god
[1:05:34] hallelujah look i will open my mouth to
[1:05:37] the escape ones oh give the lord a shout
[1:05:40] that's a promise you know
[1:05:44] hallelujah
[1:05:46] yes prophetic otter runs will go out
[1:05:49] to the escape ones
[1:05:50] hallelujah you wouldn't want to miss a
[1:05:52] service because you don't know what god
[1:05:54] wants to say you don't want god going to
[1:05:56] speak because god's going to speak by
[1:05:58] direct inspiration it's not just the
[1:06:00] quotes we are quoting here is the spirit

[1:06:23] ago before i found the world and god
[1:06:25] sent jesus to make that inheritance real
[1:06:29] to me
[1:06:30] because there was nothing i could do but
[1:06:32] inherit it there's nothing i can do but
[1:06:35] in the fullness of time god sent his own
[1:06:37] good time jesus the lamb slain from the
[1:06:39] foundation of the world his blood was
[1:06:41] shed that i might go to my inheritance
[1:06:43] to be walked what inheritance the
[1:06:45] sonship
[1:06:47] to be a son of god
[1:06:49] not church member
[1:06:54] let's
[1:06:56] go with me a little bit right
[1:06:58] uh
[1:06:59] moses people
[1:07:00] children of israel gorge people pillar
[1:07:02] of fire they come out on its own right
[1:07:04] so go give them prophets they have the
[1:07:06] word they have the law
[1:07:08] from malachi to matthew
[1:07:10] hundreds of years
[1:07:12] no prophet here comes john the baptist
[1:07:14] repent
[1:07:17] by that time hundreds of years passed
[1:07:18] them fellas are tall hats
[1:07:20] long guns nice little twiddling beards
[1:07:23] nice tabernacles and temples and so on
[1:07:26] nice traditions and so on people respect
[1:07:28] them and whatnot here come a man
[1:07:30] not zechariah his name is johnny here
[1:07:33] come a man with camel skin blast and
[1:07:36] bring forth fruit me to repentance and
[1:07:38] blast in them
[1:07:39] the pharisees knew something happening
[1:07:41] because that behavior is out of sync
[1:07:43] with what they're custom with they say
[1:07:45] are you him
[1:07:46] are you the messiah should we look for
[1:07:48] another you see me i'm not me there's
[1:07:50] one standing among you
[1:07:53] whose shoes i'm not what if you're loose
[1:07:55] he gonna baptize you with the holy ghost
[1:07:56] on fire
[1:07:57] oh glory to god you under know who it is
[1:07:59] yet
[1:08:01] to god give him a sign upon whom you see
[1:08:02] the dove coming and resting and
[1:08:04] remaining that's the messiah jesus he is
[1:08:07] watching what's happening he had to wait
[1:08:09] for his time he can't come on the ball i
[1:08:11] ain't mess i'm jesus i am jesus
[1:08:13] everybody i'm jesus
[1:08:14] he can't introduce himself john has to
[1:08:16] introduce him a way has to be made for
[1:08:18] the messiah so jesus had to wait for
[1:08:20] john to start to preach and john the
[1:08:23] timing has to be just right and then all
[1:08:25] of a sudden the holy spirit tells jesus
[1:08:27] move now
[1:08:28] he's standing in line to be baptizing
[1:08:29] everybody else and john baptizen
[1:08:31] baptized him when you see jesus he said
[1:08:33] i said you should baptize me he said
[1:08:35] that might be so but it becomes us
[1:08:37] fulfill righteousness
[1:08:38] and john baptized him he said behold the
[1:08:40] lamb of god
[1:08:41] then the elect among john disciples
[1:08:44] stop following john and they start to
[1:08:46] follow jesus because they knew john was
[1:08:48] to introduce jesus
[1:08:50] john cena disciples but this guy is
[1:08:52] following jesus now because they know
[1:08:54] that the messiah oh glory to god what
[1:08:56] did jesus find another priest so-called
[1:08:58] fightful in them days the so-called
[1:09:00] custodians of the wood in those days
[1:09:02] they have the books they have the tips
[1:09:03] of the scrolls you follow i'm saying
[1:09:08] the caretakers they were taking the
[1:09:09] music scrolls
[1:09:11] after john got back jesus got baptized
[1:09:13] holy spirit again not man holy spirit
[1:09:16] led him into the wilderness
[1:09:19] you about lord is that you
[1:09:20] i've seen with this in front is that you
[1:09:23] i thought i was going i'm going on a
[1:09:25] platform and people would welcome me
[1:09:28] i thought i'd get up a lot of people
[1:09:29] shake my hand
[1:09:30] but is that really you
[1:09:33] yeah that is really you
[1:09:34] the holy spirit led him into the
[1:09:36] wilderness to overcome lucifer
[1:09:38] one-on-one
[1:09:41] private trial
[1:09:43] to overcome the lust of the eyes lust of
[1:09:45] the flesh pride of life to overcome
[1:09:47] himself
[1:09:49] because a lot of people they don't have
[1:09:51] the internal power
[1:09:54] self-discipline self-order conquering of
[1:09:57] self
[1:09:58] so that's why they multiply lose their
[1:10:01] they carry on because they don't have
[1:10:03] the eternal stuff
[1:10:05] so when jesus had that discipline look
[1:10:08] at this stone could turn into bread and
[1:10:09] say it is written this is written it's
[1:10:11] also written he overcame
[1:10:13] now the spirit come back upon him so
[1:10:15] here it is he baptized spirit on him
[1:10:18] when he hit the wilderness spirit off of
[1:10:20] him now
[1:10:21] he had to face the chest alone
[1:10:23] no help of faith
[1:10:25] this is written it is written he's doing
[1:10:27] that for you and me
[1:10:28] you don't need power to
[1:10:30] beat that devil you just need to know
[1:10:32] your word
[1:10:33] hallelujah it's written as written but
[1:10:35] i'm saying did that for you he did that
[1:10:38] for me that you could tell satan it is
[1:10:40] written it is written if you don't know
[1:10:41] it is written that's why you have to be
[1:10:43] in the word to know it is written
[1:10:44] oh give the lord a shout
[1:10:46] you have to know it is written you have
[1:10:49] to know it's in the word you have to
[1:10:51] study the word
[1:10:53] so when he come true
[1:10:54] and he come back over
[1:10:56] then he's speaking back upon him the
[1:10:57] bible called the power of the spirit
[1:11:00] so now you have a super anointing upon
[1:11:02] him
[1:11:02] he goes to the temple they say somebody
[1:11:05] wanted something we want somebody to
[1:11:06] read jesus put up his hands
[1:11:10] maybe the first time he went and read
[1:11:12] hallelujah then he had to find the
[1:11:14] scroll of isaiah isaiah okay
[1:11:17] then he's scrolling down now and finally
[1:11:20] and going down to the part where he
[1:11:21] marked the spirit of the law is upon me
[1:11:23] so they taught him reading scripture
[1:11:25] that's scripture this is the
[1:11:26] manifestation right now
[1:11:28] they thought he was reading that text
[1:11:29] they thought he quoting
[1:11:31] and he quoting he just quoted but he's
[1:11:33] himself he's quoting the spirit of the
[1:11:34] lord upon me because he anointed meter
[1:11:36] and when he finished finished reader he
[1:11:38] said this day
[1:11:39] the scripture
[1:11:41] is fulfilled
[1:11:43] in your air
[1:11:45] and he sat down
[1:11:47] close the book
[1:11:48] drama no start
[1:11:51] action no start
[1:11:53] hallelujah
[1:11:55] victorious vibrations from heaven oh
[1:11:58] glory to god he is now anointed he finds
[1:12:01] the scripture he is now commissioned he

[1:12:07] raise the dead and give them scribe and
[1:12:09] pharisees and run for the money or give
[1:12:12] the lord a shout

[1:12:36] are sons of god are amateur gods or this
[1:12:39] is beautiful
[1:12:40] men that are sons of god are amateur
[1:12:42] gods he didn't say men that are sons of
[1:12:44] god are preachers and teachers and
[1:12:46] explainers

[1:12:50] your sonship
[1:12:51] to be a son of god and the son of god
[1:12:54] rightly not church sun seven and pew
