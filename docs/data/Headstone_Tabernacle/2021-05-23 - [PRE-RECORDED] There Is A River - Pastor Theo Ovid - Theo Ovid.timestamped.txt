[39:21] the one that are praying and sweating it
[39:23] out and something like that
[39:26] and um the script we read was from
[39:28] second kings 3
[39:29] 15 to 17 where elijah
[39:33] was upset and the acts were minstrel
[39:36] at the play and the minister plead and
[39:38] the hand of the lord came upon him
[39:40] and the spirit the music uh
[39:43] was able to bring him in an atmosphere
[39:46] so it's not just plain
[39:48] but the right kind of a plane amen that
[39:51] would bring an atmosphere upon the
[39:52] prophet or
[39:53] let's say this we bring it in the spirit
[39:56] so we appreciate brother stephen this
[39:57] morning with that song service
[39:59] the right kind of singing atmosphere and
[40:02] this is brother branner
[40:04] he said hey heavenly father we're happy
[40:06] tonight for the privilege of standing on
[40:08] this church and praying for the people
[40:10] we are thankful for your word lord and i
[40:13] pray
[40:14] that you would send the revival that
[40:15] we're asking for

[40:19] personally myself

[40:23] people's heart
[40:24] an expectation let them never forget

[40:42] ghost
[40:43] i'll be the first one at the altar to
[40:45] repent of my sins
[40:47] i'll be the first one that god
[40:48] sanctifies and takes all the world out
[40:51] of me
[40:51] lord i'm a shame of my life i'm ashamed
[40:54] of the way i've been doing
[40:55] i want you to take it away from me give
[40:58] me something so great lord
[41:00] that i don't want to go back to that hog
[41:01] wallow again as the bible said as the
[41:04] soul returned of wallow
[41:05] and the doctors vomit we can see lord
[41:08] that many of our pentecostal people are
[41:09] acting the same way
[41:10] come out of the world and going right
[41:12] back in it again god please
[41:14] let me not think lord i'm trying to
[41:16] scold them but merely trying to put the
[41:18] scripture in front of them
[41:20] that they'll have to walk over it lord
[41:21] and push it aside to go any further
[41:23] and i pray lord every every person and
[41:26] myself
[41:26] all of us will take inventory of our
[41:29] lives
[41:30] and compare it with god's requirement
[41:32] granted father
[41:33] forgive us of our sins forgive us of our
[41:36] mistakes
[41:37] and our errors let the blood of jesus
[41:39] sanctify the little church tonight

[41:44] touch of the holy spirit
[41:46] right away granted father let it come
[41:48] please do
[41:49] lord start a revival right here in this
[41:52] city
[41:53] granted lord make this church an example
[41:56] an example church and
[41:57] let the people come from different parts
[41:59] and look in here and see the way their
[42:01] conduct
[42:02] is and how they shut back from the
[42:03] things of the world and back into the
[42:05] real
[42:05] genuine pentecostal path the genuine
[42:09] pentecostal experience
[42:10] walking with you blameless granted lord
[42:12] then other churches will see
[42:14] and they will say well if that brother
[42:15] can have his church like that and all
[42:17] them people can be together
[42:19] and their hearts can be won then they
[42:21] got the ammo for everyone
[42:22] and look how much difference there is in
[42:24] them lord that they will hunger and
[42:26] taste
[42:27] you said you are the salt of the earth
[42:29] god bring back the server
[42:31] in the sword quickly oh glory to god
[42:33] hallelujah
[42:35] praise god that the people might walk in
[42:36] the door and see the power
[42:38] of the resurrection of the lord jesus
[42:41] moving among the people
[42:42] showing himself alive oh glory to god
[42:46] hallelujah
[42:47] [Applause]
[42:48] i'm almost finished here you see i'm
[42:51] traveling i think there's a great thing
[42:53] that i've seen missing in the church
[42:54] today one of the greatest hindrances in
[42:57] the church today
[42:58] that keep the revival back is the lack
[43:00] of godly love
[43:01] that christ expressed when you will see
[43:02] on earth it is easy for you to love
[43:05] someone that loves us
[43:07] but with jesus didn't have that kind of
[43:09] a love he had god's love and god love
[43:11] his enemies
[43:12] forgot to love the world when the world
[43:14] was unlovable god still loved the world
[43:17] oprah it's a different even in the
[43:19] expression of the words
[43:20] of filio and a couple of divine love and
[43:23] if there's anything i believe
[43:25] listen listen listen to this this looks
[43:27] like simple there's no big hard mystery
[43:29] that you have to scratch your head
[43:30] if there's anything that i believe that
[43:33] would start a revival of
[43:35] los angeles would it be a time that we
[43:37] could break down all over different
[43:38] barriers
[43:39] and come together as christians in love
[43:42] that's the pentecostal the baptist the
[43:44] presbyterian
[43:45] and all together we would express to the
[43:48] world
[43:48] that we have loved one for another and
[43:51] jesus
[43:52] prayed that prayer that we might have
[43:54] loved one for another
[43:55] as he had loved us oh glory to god amen
[43:59] hallelujah glory to god
[44:02] do you believe that today let me close
[44:04] with this here no one can love like him
[44:07] you can't manufacture that kind of a
[44:08] love it's the gift of god
[44:10] that comes by the holy spirit the only
[44:13] way you will ever be able to have that
[44:14] love
[44:15] do i speak with tongues of men and
[44:16] angels and have that kind of love
[44:19] oh my amen praise god
[44:22] oh i love him this morning he said what
[44:25] we need tonight
[44:26] is the water of god the vision
[44:29] absolutely interpreted
[44:31] god's will to a dying persian people
[44:33] what did elijah said he said don't look
[44:35] for wind
[44:36] don't look for rain just dig ditches
[44:38] just in other words don't let your
[44:39] senses fool you
[44:41] don't bother don't mess with them senses
[44:43] because if you're looking for water you
[44:44] expect rain
[44:45] or you expect wind he said look for that
[44:47] just dig ditches and you go get water
[44:49] just take just dig just dig
[44:51] the more you dig the more water you got

[46:50] from verse 1.
[46:56] afterward he brought me again to the
[46:57] door of the house
[46:59] and behold waters issued out from under
[47:02] the threshold of the house
[47:03] eastward for the front forefront of the
[47:07] house stood
[47:08] towards the east and the waters came
[47:11] down from under the right side of the
[47:13] house
[47:13] at the south side of the altar
[47:18] then brought he out me out
[47:21] of the way of the gate northward and led
[47:23] me about the way
[47:24] without onto the utter gate by the way
[47:28] let's look at eastwood and behold they
[47:30] ran out waters on the right side
[47:33] when the man that had the line in his
[47:35] hand went forth eastward
[47:38] he measured a thousand cubits and he
[47:41] brought me through the waters
[47:42] and the waters were to the ankles again
[47:45] he measured a thousand he brought me
[47:47] through the waters
[47:48] the waters were to the knees again he
[47:51] measured
[47:52] a thousand and he brought me to the
[47:54] waters or to the loins
[47:56] and afterwards he measured a thousand it
[47:58] was a river
[48:00] that i could not pass over for the
[48:02] waters with risen
[48:04] waters to swimming a river that could
[48:06] not be passed over
[48:08] and he said unto me son of man has not
[48:11] seen this then he brought me
[48:15] and caused me to return to the brink of
[48:17] the river
[48:18] now when i had returned the hole at the
[48:20] bank of the river were very many trees
[48:23] on the one side and the other
[48:26] then city unto me these waters issued
[48:29] out
[48:30] towards the east country and go down to
[48:33] into the desert and go into the sea
[48:35] which being brought forth into the sea
[48:38] the waters shall be healed and it shall
[48:41] come to pass that
[48:42] everything that liveth which move it
[48:44] whereas wherever the river shall come
[48:46] shall live and there shall be a great
[48:49] molecule of fish
[48:50] because these waters come thither for
[48:52] they shall be healed
[48:54] and everything shall that live with it
[48:57] whether the river
[48:58] comet let's go for psalms 46.
[49:03] 1
[49:06] god is our refuge and strength
[49:11] a very present help in trouble therefore
[49:14] will we not pre-fear
[49:16] though the earth be removed do the
[49:18] mountains be carried into the midst of
[49:20] the sea
[49:21] though the waters thereof roar and be
[49:23] troubled
[49:24] do the mountain shake with the swelling
[49:26] thereof silla
[49:28] there is a river the streams whereof
[49:31] shall make glad the city of god
[49:33] the holy place of the tabernacles of the
[49:36] most high
[49:37] god is in the midst of her she shall not
[49:40] be moved
[49:41] god shall help her and that right early
[49:44] the hidden rage the kingdoms will move
[49:46] he uttered his voice the earth melted
[49:48] the lord of hosts is with us
[49:49] the god of jacob is our refuge come
[49:52] behold the works of the lord
[49:53] what desolations he had made on the
[49:55] earth he make it was to cease
[49:57] unto the end of the earth he break at
[49:59] the bow he cut the despair and sunder he
[50:01] burned the charge in the fire
[50:02] be still and know that i am god i will
[50:05] be exalted
[50:07] among the heathen i will be exalted in
[50:09] the earth
[50:10] the lord of hosts is with us the god of
[50:12] jacob is our refuge
[50:14] our last scripture is from john chapter
[50:17] 7 reading from verse 37
[50:19] familiar scripture and the last day that
[50:21] great day of the feast jesus stood and
[50:23] cried saying
[50:24] if any man taste let him come unto me
[50:27] and drink he that believe on me
[50:28] as the scripture had said out of his
[50:30] belly shall flow rivers of living water
[50:33] but this speak he of the spirit which
[50:35] they that believe in him should receive
[50:37] for the holy ghost was not yet given
[50:39] because that jesus was not yet glorified
[50:41] let us pray one more time father we have
[50:43] read your word
[50:44] and god i i i need you to come and
[50:47] interpret these words to the people this
[50:49] morning

[51:40] and can you swim
[51:47] and where are you planted hallelujah
[51:52] it's amazing what you know
[51:56] why there was such a contrast in the
[51:58] scripture
[51:59] when he says here in psalms 46
[52:04] therefore shall be not fear though the
[52:06] earth be removed
[52:07] and though the mountains be carried to
[52:10] the midst of the sea
[52:12] though the waters roar and be troubled
[52:15] through the mountains
[52:16] shake with the swelling thereof it means
[52:19] in the shaking times
[52:21] you have to know that there is a river
[52:26] that makes glad the city of god

[53:05] till he's on his face with his hands in
[53:06] the air praying to god and blushing
[53:09] because of the iniquity of the people
[53:11] then you're going to see a revival start
[53:14] a man
[53:14] cannot lay in the presence of god a
[53:17] church cannot stay in the presence of
[53:19] god under repentance
[53:21] unless the holy spirit come down and
[53:23] give unction and power
[53:25] to start a move a god among those people
[53:29] he said it's got to be so the holy
[53:32] spirit have to start a move of god
[53:35] not a man move not a move of man
[53:38] but a move of god how many want to see

[54:00] church who prayed all night for the
[54:02] iniquity of the people
[54:03] until his eyes will be swelled shut next
[54:05] morning from

[59:29] somebody
[59:30] we're going to get a clean out
[59:32] [Applause]
[59:35] all right let's continue we don't need
[59:37] much the tips of the spirit
[59:39] or spiritual awakening we need a revival
[59:42] revive what we've got not a spiritual
[59:44] awakening
[59:44] sometimes that brings mixed multitudes
[59:47] but we need a revival that will
[59:49] sift down shake out and cut out all the
[59:51] things
[59:53] hallelujah stand in puerto rico a few
[59:56] weeks ago
[59:57] when i see the great sea and the great
[59:58] storm the waves were higher than this
[1:00:00] tabernacle
[1:00:00] and i said you know what it hasn't got
[1:00:02] one more drop of water in it
[1:00:04] when it's beautifully calm but what does
[1:00:06] the training on the jump in
[1:00:08] what does it mean it throws all the
[1:00:09] trash out upon the bank
[1:00:11] that is what the church needs is a
[1:00:13] revival
[1:00:15] not a revival of specials not a revival
[1:00:17] of singing
[1:00:18] not a revivalist inspiration not that
[1:00:21] but a revival avoids the trust of the
[1:00:23] church
[1:00:24] special is good so inspiration good but
[1:00:27] this is something other than that
[1:00:29] [Applause]
[1:00:30] [Music]
[1:00:32] oh glory to god hallelujah we don't know
[1:00:35] ankle water revival that's what luther
[1:00:39] had
[1:00:40] oh glory to god we don't want no knee
[1:00:42] high revival
[1:00:44] that's what wesley had we don't want to
[1:00:46] waste revival
[1:00:47] that's what the pentecostal had we want
[1:00:50] water to swim in
[1:00:51] that's what the prophet had oh give the
[1:00:54] lord a shout
[1:01:01] that's what the church means is a
[1:01:03] revival to shake from it all the
[1:01:05] willingness and the things of the world
[1:01:06] and bring back purity and wholeness of
[1:01:09] god in the hearts
[1:01:10] of its believers humility as a powerful
[1:01:12] word humility when i say that i would
[1:01:13] call humanity
[1:01:15] everybody's somebody everybody in some
[1:01:16] big somebody who humbling itself humble
[1:01:18] what wait
[1:01:19] what name that
[1:01:22] see but when man suits himself they
[1:01:25] don't get a revival once in a while on
[1:01:27] their spirit
[1:01:28] okay when they don't get a revival once
[1:01:31] in a while
[1:01:32] on their spirit they become so
[1:01:35] carnal and so indifferent

[1:35:52] you can say so when it's anchored deep

[1:35:59] trickling down you could possibly so are

[1:36:05] house inside the area house anyway
[1:36:07] it's moving the whole show
[1:36:11] you not in charge of the river
[1:36:14] and if you don't put things right the
[1:36:16] river will sweep you away
[1:36:18] but the river is coming
[1:36:23] you ever see after the rains come they
[1:36:25] said they fall when they say the flood
[1:36:26] come down

[1:37:06] lord is the river source
[1:37:08] this river we're talking about he is the
[1:37:10] source of that river
[1:37:12] oh hallelujah praise be to jesus

[1:37:39] hearts
[1:37:40] by time and pressure sometimes it takes
[1:37:43] 30 years
[1:37:44] to get a man right
[1:37:48] 30 years for six months ministry johnny
[1:37:51] baptist

[1:37:54] prepare a man
[1:37:55] for one month how do i say sometimes i
[1:37:58] say 30 years to become an overnight
[1:38:00] success
[1:38:02] what does that teach you success doesn't
[1:38:04] come overnight
[1:38:07] you recognize overnight but the labor
[1:38:09] was there behind the scenes
[1:38:10] as we say you see a big tree standing
[1:38:12] tall it's not that tall on top there is
[1:38:15] so look at you know
[1:38:16] is what the roots how deep it is down

[1:38:28] that's how you must become oh glory to
[1:38:30] like a tree planted
[1:38:33] god placed you there and when god placed
[1:38:35] you somewhere nobody could approach you
[1:38:37] how they could approach you where god
[1:38:38] placed you
[1:38:39] god placed you in the spirit positioning
[1:38:42] no man could uproot you
[1:38:44] oh the promotion doesn't come from the
[1:38:45] east of the west it comes from the lord
[1:38:48] and when god promotes you no man could
[1:38:50] demonstrate
[1:38:51] or they could talk and yeah but no man
[1:38:53] could demote you when god promotes you
[1:38:55] oh glory to god hallelujah if we said

[1:43:22] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:43:25] where is he still
[1:43:42] be watchful and strengthen the things
[1:43:43] which will mean that the right to die
[1:43:46] if i have not found our work spoken
[1:43:47] before god i wish
[1:43:49] it could have been said that the
[1:43:51] sedition age
[1:43:52] was the restoration instead of
[1:43:54] reformation
[1:43:56] he said um i kind of see that the world
[1:43:58] does not call it restoration
[1:44:00] but certainly calls it reformation had
[1:44:02] it been restoration the age would have
[1:44:04] been another pentecostal age
[1:44:05] but it was not the best that could be
[1:44:07] said striking that which remains that is
[1:44:09] ready to die
[1:44:10] there was something missing there
[1:44:12] certainly was
[1:44:13] this age was justification but it had
[1:44:16] missed sanctification
[1:44:17] and the baptism of the holy ghost that
[1:44:19] is what god's original plan was
[1:44:21] that was what that is what they had at
[1:44:23] pentecost
[1:44:25] they were justified they were sanctified
[1:44:27] they were filled with the holy ghost why
[1:44:28] listen to me
[1:44:29] the reason for being justified and
[1:44:31] signified is to the end
[1:44:33] that you might be baptized with the holy
[1:44:35] ghost
[1:44:36] that is the reason there is a church it
[1:44:38] is a temple of god filled with god even
[1:44:40] the holy ghost
[1:44:40] the same spirit that was in jesus while
[1:44:42] he was on earth causing him to do the
[1:44:44] mighty works which he did
[1:44:45] back in the church at pentecost so that
[1:44:47] they did the work that he did
[1:44:49] this age did not have those works they
[1:44:51] had the written word
[1:44:53] but not the revealed word this was the
[1:44:55] reformation
[1:44:56] was going to be start of it he was going
[1:44:58] to according to promise
[1:44:59] take the tish back from the depths of
[1:45:01] satan in the dark ages
[1:45:03] to the depths of god that had a
[1:45:05] pentecost and which was a few years
[1:45:06] before
[1:45:07] now be careful get this it says in this
[1:45:10] second verse and i read for i have not
[1:45:11] found thy works perfectly before god
[1:45:13] do you know what the meaning of not
[1:45:14] perfect really is it is unfulfilled
[1:45:18] so he put his magnify grass not perfect
[1:45:20] it means unfulfilled
[1:45:22] this age was an unfulfilled age it was
[1:45:25] just starting to get him back
[1:45:26] and that is why i said the bible called
[1:45:28] reformation not restoration is that
[1:45:30] started out in the doctrine of
[1:45:32] justification which meant salvation
[1:45:34] was all of god now luther preached the
[1:45:36] sovereignty of god and election
[1:45:38] he knew it was all grace he separated
[1:45:40] the church from the rule
[1:45:41] by ecclesiastical hierarchy he taught
[1:45:44] idols he cast all confessions to the
[1:45:46] priest
[1:45:46] he denounced the people it was wonderful
[1:45:48] god had 1500 years before
[1:45:50] luther you are going to start things
[1:45:51] your age will see it all on fulfilled
[1:45:54] i'm leaving that till later he knows the
[1:45:58] end from the beginning
[1:45:59] luther was his messenger it didn't look
[1:46:01] like it
[1:46:02] as we examined the flaws
[1:46:08] so luther had flow
[1:46:11] and if you want to see flaws you can see
[1:46:13] plenty with looter
[1:46:15] and you can see with me and everybody
[1:46:16] else too is what you want to look at
[1:46:20] are you let's continue now but there was
[1:46:22] a man called jonah he had flaws in his
[1:46:24] life too
[1:46:25] he was a prophet though you might not
[1:46:27] want to say so
[1:46:28] on the basis of how we acted but god
[1:46:30] knows them that are his
[1:46:32] and he has his way just as david jonah
[1:46:34] he had his way with luther in that day
[1:46:37] and he will have his way
[1:46:38] until the confirmation oh could we give
[1:46:40] the lord as praise offering
[1:46:44] now let's look at the next step
[1:46:46] logically we think it's the actual
[1:46:48] forming and harvesting of the grain the
[1:46:50] completed cycle but not so
[1:46:52] there's another stage and that stage is
[1:46:54] when the husk
[1:46:56] or chaff is formed to cover the seed
[1:46:59] and that is exactly what happened in the
[1:47:00] spiritual cycle at the turn of the 20th
[1:47:02] century
[1:47:03] in the start of the lodestone age there
[1:47:04] was a widespread belief
[1:47:06] that the holy ghost was falling exactly
[1:47:08] as it did at pentecost people were
[1:47:10] talking in tongues and claiming to be
[1:47:11] baptized with the holy ghost
[1:47:12] with evidence of speaking in tongues but
[1:47:14] i've walked through the grain fields
[1:47:15] many times and here in summer
[1:47:17] plucked the heads of wheat rub them in
[1:47:19] my hand to get some green
[1:47:20] and to my surprise there wasn't any
[1:47:22] corner wheat in that shaft
[1:47:24] though indeed it looked as if we were
[1:47:26] there this is a perfect picture
[1:47:28] of this so-called pentecostal move now
[1:47:30] here we go just want to get to
[1:47:33] and this is a proven fact it's found in
[1:47:35] these people
[1:47:36] organized on a doctrine and bond
[1:47:38] themselves see that is where
[1:47:41] people go off when they pin down their
[1:47:43] doctrine and say you have to believe it
[1:47:44] like this
[1:47:45] and then nail it down like a thesis and
[1:47:47] hang it up and unless you don't believe
[1:47:49] it like that you're not
[1:47:50] brothers
[1:47:53] pharisees are the things are diseased
[1:47:55] here it is and jesus can't bust all the
[1:47:56] things
[1:47:58] so then he was a he was wrecking the
[1:47:59] churches as far as they can say
[1:48:01] and people had to bust it out from them
[1:48:02] and he had a whole following
[1:48:04] i went in come also he bust them too
[1:48:06] except people flesh and drink my blood
[1:48:07] you have no life see them getting licks
[1:48:09] all around
[1:48:10] because god want the word living
[1:48:14] so when they thought jesus was the next
[1:48:15] kind of one of them to start a new
[1:48:17] organization
[1:48:18] and take over to rome and they're gonna
[1:48:20] anoint him champion rebel and rebel
[1:48:22] risen
[1:48:23] and king and what time jesus said my
[1:48:25] kingdom
[1:48:26] is not of this world get it out of your
[1:48:28] head
[1:48:29] i ain't coming to fight rome for you my
[1:48:32] kingdom belongs to different realm all
[1:48:33] together
[1:48:34] in my kingdom you have to love your
[1:48:36] enemies you have to do good to them that
[1:48:38] mean to you or give the lord some
[1:48:42] [Applause]
[1:48:44] praises
[1:48:46] so listen from a natural concept he was
[1:48:49] gonna
[1:48:50] appear to be like crazy a crazy belief
[1:48:53] because everybody had a little stone
[1:48:54] behind they're waiting to build some
[1:48:55] roman soldier
[1:48:57] and she has nothing to be stolen
[1:48:58] anything
[1:49:02] peter was a swordsman you know when they
[1:49:04] come for jesus he just draws sword
[1:49:06] cut off my nails he fighting for jesus
[1:49:09] jesus will pick up ears and put it back
[1:49:10] on the heal at one time he said
[1:49:12] live by you so they died but he saw this
[1:49:14] ain't no sorting
[1:49:16] hallelujah that man was living something
[1:49:18] completely different
[1:49:23] hallelujah and we are caught in
[1:49:25] something completely different
[1:49:27] [Applause]
[1:49:30] god is about to shock the world with
[1:49:33] another bride
[1:49:35] completely different not not just
[1:49:38] walking by faith
[1:49:39] but living by faith
[1:49:42] [Music]
[1:49:45] jesus made it so simple preaching the
[1:49:48] five thousand people
[1:49:49] my god he wanted to dismiss them now he
[1:49:52] dropped seven and a month on them
[1:49:54] he said what we have here what we have

[1:52:59] but you did a long time and a little man
[1:53:02] come to jesus said my savings secret
[1:53:04] sick i'm not worried to come in my roof
[1:53:06] just to speak the word and someone shall
[1:53:08] be healed
[1:53:10] jesus said go your way we might run back
[1:53:12] run back run back
[1:53:13] he said what what i mean with you not if
[1:53:16] not let your doctor check him what time
[1:53:19] or the same time jesus spoke
[1:53:21] jesus said never never never see that
[1:53:23] kind of faith that was a gentile man
[1:53:25] that was one of you
[1:53:26] there was somebody like you so don't
[1:53:28] tell me you don't have that you have it
[1:53:31] that man reflected if you have it you
[1:53:34] have it
[1:53:35] for your children you have it for your
[1:53:37] healing you have it
[1:53:43] let me finish up here
[1:53:47] the chaff maggie 24 deceive any luck if
[1:53:50] possible
[1:53:50] now hear how brother branham tied in
[1:53:53] this scripture with ezekiel 47.
[1:53:55] it's going to blow my mind this chap
[1:53:57] stage
[1:53:58] was the danger period that jesus spoke
[1:54:00] of in matthew 24 24.
[1:54:02] deceivingly very elected was possible oh
[1:54:04] man
[1:54:05] felt that this husk the so-called
[1:54:07] pentecostal it was a true seed
[1:54:09] but it proved to be a carrier to carry
[1:54:11] the life over to the age in which the
[1:54:12] true restoration
[1:54:14] comes and the wheat bride
[1:54:18] is manifested in the power spoken by
[1:54:21] ezekiel 47 2-5
[1:54:24] and now he connects that with the script
[1:54:27] we read
[1:54:28] and when the man had that line in his
[1:54:31] hand
[1:54:32] watch then he brought me out of the way
[1:54:34] of the gate northward led me from the
[1:54:35] way without unto the utter gate by the
[1:54:37] way that looked eastward and behold iran
[1:54:39] waters
[1:54:39] on the right side and when the man had
[1:54:42] the line in his hand when fought
[1:54:43] eastward
[1:54:44] he measured a thousand cubit he brought
[1:54:45] me through the waters the waters were
[1:54:47] ankles
[1:54:48] again he measured a thousand and the
[1:54:49] water went to the knees and he measured
[1:54:51] a thousand brought me to the waters to
[1:54:52] the loins i asked already measured a
[1:54:54] thousand it was a river
[1:54:55] that i could not pass over for the
[1:54:57] waters were risen waters to swim in
[1:54:59] a river that i couldn't pass over oh
[1:55:02] glory to god he said that's the way it
[1:55:03] was done
[1:55:04] by god's perfect will and programming
[1:55:06] the lutheran had the holy ghost
[1:55:07] potentially under justification
[1:55:09] the method has had it potentially on the
[1:55:11] signification and today it has brought
[1:55:14] back
[1:55:14] a restoration the holy ghost is here
[1:55:18] so brother panama restore back the
[1:55:19] person of the holy ghost
[1:55:21] water to swim in oh give the lord some
[1:55:24] praises people
[1:55:26] hallelujah almost finish here
[1:55:30] watch to watch contains not only the
[1:55:33] idea of being awake
[1:55:34] but to be alert the idiot expressed is
[1:55:37] two words watchful and strengthened
[1:55:39] to be the otherwise instrument in
[1:55:42] insinuous danger and loss
[1:55:44] to strengthen means more than just to
[1:55:47] give strength
[1:55:48] it means to fix and establish for
[1:55:50] permanency
[1:55:52] that's deep these two commands refer to
[1:55:55] what is left of the truth
[1:55:57] which in itself is ready to die this
[1:55:59] expression of the spirit comes before me
[1:56:02] as an illustration a group of slaves
[1:56:05] in total bandage physically and morally
[1:56:08] has risen up
[1:56:09] and escaped their captors indeed this is
[1:56:12] what saddest mean the escape points
[1:56:14] they are pursued and their great and
[1:56:16] glorious gains are all but lost
[1:56:18] they have not been retaken but about all
[1:56:21] that they can be said that they have
[1:56:22] escaped
[1:56:23] not clean escape as some according to
[1:56:25] the word they have but they have lost
[1:56:27] much of their liberties
[1:56:28] now the lord say you are potentially
[1:56:31] back in captivity
[1:56:32] see that you don't go back to keep from
[1:56:36] going back
[1:56:37] become alert remain ever watchful
[1:56:41] concerning the things of your captivity
[1:56:43] or you would lose
[1:56:44] all strengthen yourself now in what you
[1:56:48] have left
[1:56:49] in such a manner as to permanently
[1:56:52] establish
[1:56:53] what you have and thus ensure against
[1:56:56] future laws in other words you're
[1:56:58] cutting your losses
[1:56:59] and you remain unsafe
[1:57:04] [Applause]
[1:57:05] this will not be an opportunity to
[1:57:07] fulfill that you have not fulfilled but
[1:57:09] where did they go
[1:57:10] on no sir they did not heed this voice
[1:57:13] of the spirit
[1:57:14] they went to another age oh my
[1:57:17] hallelujah jeremiah 2 11 and 13.
[1:57:20] god speaking in jeremiah 2 here saying
[1:57:22] have a nation change their gods
[1:57:24] which are yet no gods but my people have
[1:57:27] changed their glory for that but not
[1:57:29] profit
[1:57:30] be astonished oh you heavens of this and
[1:57:32] be horribly afraid
[1:57:33] be very desolate say the lord for my
[1:57:36] people
[1:57:37] have committed two evils they have
[1:57:38] forsaken me
[1:57:40] the fountain of living waters and hewed
[1:57:42] themselves out
[1:57:43] cisterns broke consistence that could
[1:57:45] hold no water
[1:57:47] oh glory to god hallelujah he said they
[1:57:50] abandoned the fountain of living
[1:57:52] water in addition to that they make
[1:57:54] systems
[1:57:55] or containers that are broken that
[1:57:56] cannot hold any water
[1:57:58] oh glory to god hallelujah praise god
[1:58:02] you see the nomination make stagnant
[1:58:04] pools where man can live with woman and
[1:58:06] then woman can carry on
[1:58:07] and cut their hair and wear shorts and
[1:58:09] anything else and calling them
[1:58:10] christians
[1:58:11] that's why they love the churches

[1:58:15] and you're a believer you can do
[1:58:16] anything you want and you're a christian
[1:58:17] you can do anything
[1:58:19] but when you come to the lord you want
[1:58:20] to do what his will is

[1:58:27] commandments

[1:58:38] but a genuine fountain of the power of
[1:58:40] god it can't stay there almost done
[1:58:42] he said i am the function of living
[1:58:44] waters they left me
[1:58:45] to dig themselves some system a fountain
[1:58:48] of living water is not dead
[1:58:50] it's not stagnated it is living it is
[1:58:53] constantly changing
[1:58:55] bringing up something new all the time
[1:58:57] moving on coming from its resources

[1:59:02] don't need no strainer
[1:59:03] when you're getting water off the roof
[1:59:04] you have to put a filter to the barrel
[1:59:10] because you're getting rain from off the
[1:59:11] roof you need filter
[1:59:13] but this fountain he said he'd believe
[1:59:16] it on me

[2:05:29] my life he said to me some of them were

[2:06:05] the truth
[2:06:06] if this tabernacle of habitation be
[2:06:08] resolved we have one already waiting
[2:06:12] and when a little baby drops from its
[2:06:15] mother
[2:06:16] as in the natural bird his body is
[2:06:18] twisting his legs are jumping excuse the
[2:06:20] expression you young woman
[2:06:22] but when it does it gets muscle jerking
[2:06:24] and when it comes to the earth the first
[2:06:26] thing it catches is breath
[2:06:28] and a spiritual body of nature come into
[2:06:30] that baby right then
[2:06:32] let it alone it will take his little
[2:06:34] head and root against his mother breast
[2:06:36] up against the nurse if he didn't do
[2:06:38] that the milk will not even come down
[2:06:40] when this earthly body is brought here
[2:06:42] there's a spiritual body ready for it
[2:06:45] and if this early time i could be
[2:06:46] dissolved there is one waiting yonder
[2:06:49] just as we stepped out of this one we
[2:06:52] step
[2:06:53] into that one or give the lord a shout
[2:06:56] just as we step out at this one we step
[2:07:00] into that one
[2:07:01] one that don't need a cold drink of
[2:07:03] water you don't have no need to drink of
[2:07:05] water
[2:07:06] you don't eat they are not of the dust
[2:07:08] of the earth
[2:07:09] but they are just as real and can feel
[2:07:13] and can shake hands and can love
[2:07:17] and everything perfect that body is
[2:07:19] great and yonder
