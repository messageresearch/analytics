[16:54] uh thank god for stephen's contribution
[16:57] last tuesday to the bible study we want
[17:01] to pray that god strengthen us
[17:03] and go will inspire us each one
[17:05] and it's amazing to see how the services
[17:08] and the whole things is being connected
[17:10] is connected together
[17:12] and you can see is one mind at work in
[17:14] the mind of god the mind of christ and
[17:16] this is what we want to see among us you
[17:18] want to see evidence
[17:19] of the spirit having it its own way
[17:22] among us not just fish
[17:24] blood and fighting up with mental powers
[17:26] and whatnot but things that would help
[17:29] and assist and strike me
[17:31] i trust that you're reflective over
[17:33] that um thought about parenting
[17:36] um a story
[17:37] and we talk about it on friday everybody
[17:40] have their own story
[17:42] and you know we
[17:43] paul said i show you a better way a more
[17:45] excellent way and this is where we want
[17:47] to strike for the cute other people as
[17:50] an individual
[17:51] you don't want to do things just the way
[17:53] you're custom doing it or this is the
[17:55] way you always do it you want to know is
[17:58] there a better way is there a better way
[18:01] as a father as a husband as a brother as
[18:04] a sister
[18:05] you know probably
[18:06] maybe maybe a brother brother sister or
[18:08] sister is there a better way that we
[18:11] could be
[18:11] genuine authentic no hypocrisy no guile
[18:16] honest and heart true in heart twin
[18:17] spirit is there a better way tonight
[18:20] i want to look at the book of jude it's
[18:22] a short book is one book
[18:24] it's a book just before the book of
[18:26] revelation
[18:27] it's a very important book it's an
[18:29] important book to me i don't know
[18:32] how many of you ever studied it look at
[18:34] it closely
[18:35] can it have our message
[18:37] about the faith why we need a prophet
[18:41] why god sent a prophet
[18:43] all of that is locked up in this book of
[18:44] jude
[18:46] and in this book of jude
[18:48] just before the book of revelation
[18:50] and um
[18:51] if i put a title to this i have it here
[18:54] written
[18:55] um jude
[18:56] an entrance
[18:58] before the book of revelation that's the
[19:00] title here jeweled an entrance
[19:02] before the book of revelation
[19:04] it's incredible
[19:05] that this book of jewish small book
[19:09] 24 so this is
[19:11] um one chapter
[19:13] and yet and it has so much that belongs
[19:15] to us in terms of the fate
[19:17] terms of the warning
[19:19] in terms of
[19:21] broadly kindness and a sum of compassion
[19:23] everything is right there
[19:24] just before this great
[19:27] climax of the bible the book of
[19:29] revelation the capstone revelation of
[19:31] the bible is where it is please god
[19:34] sweeten jude
[19:35] with something right before this so we
[19:37] want to look at it tonight
[19:38] the trusted will help you and edify you
[19:41] and strengthen you
[19:43] so let's go
[19:44] and start tonight
[19:46] praise the lord
[19:47] let's not be the only floor
[19:49] okay
[19:50] now
[19:56] let's read the first verse
[19:58] find the book of jude
[19:59] jew the servant of jesus christ
[20:02] brother of james
[20:04] and here who is this book too
[20:06] to them
[20:08] that are sanctified by god the father
[20:11] preserved in jesus christ
[20:15] and called
[20:17] so you're talking about a called people
[20:20] a sanctified people
[20:23] on a preserve to people
[20:26] now
[20:27] but abraham was saying this here
[20:30] we want to look right straight into his
[20:32] word and read some of this here
[20:34] and see what he would say about it
[20:37] how he would speak to our hearts
[20:39] and i want every person now
[20:41] let yourself forget about washington
[20:43] tomorrow and the things we got to do
[20:45] we are here for one purpose worship god
[20:49] we are here
[20:51] to learn something
[20:53] and i'm here to learn something now you
[20:55] see the humility
[20:57] you say i am here to learn something and
[20:59] i am looking
[21:00] to the holy spirit to teach me something
[21:02] this afternoon
[21:04] and teach me
[21:06] how to be a better man
[21:09] teach me
[21:10] how
[21:11] to be a better minister
[21:13] and through me teach you
[21:17] how
[21:18] to be a better christian
[21:20] and all of us together
[21:22] to be a better church
[21:24] that is what we are here for
[21:26] and the word of god is for instruction
[21:30] and reproof
[21:32] that a man
[21:33] might stand before god
[21:36] blameless
[21:37] if
[21:38] we follow the blueprint
[21:40] we will stand blameless
[21:43] so let's continue so jude
[21:46] was addressing it
[21:47] not to those who are just called
[21:50] and you know of time you hear but isaac
[21:53] say we need to drive a little slow
[21:55] slowly and we could see more things
[21:58] sometimes you zip past things
[22:00] you know your tongue got to be called
[22:02] but are you sanctified
[22:04] you're telling what to be called but are
[22:06] you preserved
[22:08] because preserved
[22:10] takes time to see how somebody is
[22:13] preserved you know the jesus spoke about
[22:16] that feed and fell among the rocks and
[22:18] it rejoiced for a while and when trials
[22:21] come and test and come it dries up so
[22:23] short for a while jump for a while and
[22:25] then disappear
[22:27] but you see when it is anchored like a
[22:30] tree planted by
[22:32] by water by rivers of water you see year
[22:35] and year old season and seasonal hard
[22:38] season harsh weather it is stevie it is
[22:40] preserved it is kept
[22:43] so its three parts to this year
[22:45] those who are called
[22:48] sanctified
[22:49] and preserved
[22:51] it is not uh
[22:54] a guess of words it is specific
[22:57] that he's writing he said mercy unto you
[23:00] and peace
[23:01] and love
[23:02] be multiplied
[23:04] then he gets done
[23:06] beloved when i give all diligence to
[23:08] write unto you
[23:10] of the common salvation
[23:13] it was needful for me to write unto you
[23:16] and exhort you
[23:18] that you should earnestly contend for
[23:21] the fate we just want delivered unto the
[23:24] saints
[23:25] so by this scripture it seems as if jude
[23:28] wanted to write other stuff maybe let's
[23:30] say positive stuff
[23:32] uh things that we have in not just in
[23:35] common but the fate that we believe but
[23:37] he he had was to interrupt what he
[23:40] wanted to share
[23:41] because something came up
[23:44] something came up
[23:47] that prompted jude
[23:49] to write this letter
[23:51] it was needful for me
[23:54] to write unto you
[23:55] i cannot hold back anymore i need to get
[23:58] this unto you it is agent
[24:00] it is important put an exclamation mark
[24:03] on it note it
[24:05] and i'm here
[24:06] to exhort you
[24:08] that you should earnestly contend
[24:10] for the fate which was once delivered
[24:13] into saints the saints had something and
[24:16] it is flipping it is flipping away it is
[24:19] dissolving it's disappearing there's a
[24:21] reason why
[24:23] and this contend
[24:25] is to fight
[24:26] to struggle
[24:28] to strain
[24:29] to agonize over serious
[24:33] difficulties
[24:34] so i'm gonna blend in the scriptures and
[24:36] some of what ram said are we gonna go
[24:39] and see how it goes tonight
[24:41] so again the content is to fight
[24:44] to struggle
[24:45] to strain to organize
[24:47] you know it's almost like if why should
[24:49] i have to do that as a pastor sometimes
[24:52] sometimes you don't want to tell people
[24:53] certain things you you don't want to say
[24:54] certain things but you have to because
[24:57] god is putting in your heart
[25:00] and it has to be said because he has no
[25:02] respect for persons
[25:04] now but the brain he's addressing to the
[25:06] church telling them
[25:08] just to those that are sanctified in god
[25:11] preserved in christ and called now he
[25:14] says you are the people i am talking to
[25:17] you will earnestly contend for the faith
[25:20] that was once delivered to the saints
[25:23] note
[25:24] not delivered to fight full ministry
[25:27] note not delivered to the bishops and
[25:30] the archbishops and they would be popes
[25:32] and message popes not that
[25:34] is what these scenes have
[25:36] remember and i keep saying that and you
[25:38] will hear me say it over and over again
[25:41] that the fifo that the the fifo ministry
[25:45] or the is not for the glorification of
[25:47] of the fifo ministry
[25:49] the technology and the purpose of having
[25:51] this military the fightful ministry is
[25:54] for
[25:55] the perfecting of the saints the saints
[25:58] or the sanctified one and if you're not
[26:01] sanctified the intercept so this scene
[26:04] to be talking about here is not church
[26:06] members let's get that clear
[26:08] it is not you go to church your husband
[26:11] is like
[26:14] whatever it is and you go to church and
[26:16] your wife is this or whatever it is that
[26:17] is not what we're talking about church
[26:19] and saint is not the same thing saint
[26:22] simply means sanctified
[26:24] set apart for service
[26:27] set apart because something has to take
[26:29] place to put you in service
[26:31] okay so this is what he was dressing to
[26:33] somebody says you are the people right
[26:36] that you would earnestly content for the
[26:38] feet that was once in the saints now not
[26:41] a feet that was delivered
[26:44] but defeat that was delivered did you
[26:46] notice that here this is about a man
[26:49] the fate
[26:50] that was once delivered to the sins not
[26:54] just
[26:54] a feet
[26:56] some people say well that's against my
[26:59] feet
[27:00] there's only one feet
[27:02] one feet
[27:04] one lord
[27:06] one god
[27:07] one baptism one doctrine this is barbara
[27:10] and now people say well i have a faith
[27:13] and i go to my own church but that's not
[27:16] what this is about
[27:18] jew speaking here
[27:20] he's talking to the people
[27:23] to contend for defeat
[27:26] that was once
[27:27] delivered unto the saints
[27:30] what if we could get the believers the
[27:32] saints of god
[27:34] to meditate on the scripture
[27:37] and begin to dig up
[27:39] study
[27:40] ask
[27:41] question
[27:43] challenge
[27:44] we want defeat
[27:46] that was restored by malachi 4 we want
[27:51] the fate that was once delivered to the
[27:54] saints
[27:55] and was restored by william marion brown
[27:57] and the prophet of malachi 4 we want to
[28:00] see that same fate back in the church
[28:03] what must we do
[28:05] what must we say what must we have
[28:07] because what we have now can't cut it
[28:10] and if we have to go down to the
[28:12] resurrection down to the press
[28:14] down to meet the challenge if they are
[28:16] we have to have defeat
[28:18] but
[28:20] isn't that why god sent malachi 4
[28:22] to turn our hearts
[28:25] back to spoken word books and listen to
[28:27] tips no
[28:28] that is not the objective
[28:30] he sent maokai for to turn our hearts
[28:34] back to the fate of the father this
[28:36] thing is so simple i don't know why
[28:38] people make it so complex as if you
[28:40] almost have to get the degree to get
[28:42] through the understanding or grasp the
[28:44] revelation
[28:45] of what this message is about it is very
[28:48] simple god started a church and put on a
[28:50] big corn seed a corn tree a corn an
[28:54] original grain their pentacles
[28:57] that train went through processes and
[28:59] then in the evening time he promised
[29:02] that green will come back again another
[29:04] original branch
[29:05] that tree will reproduce itself and
[29:07] produce another book of acts which is
[29:09] that simple amen so then
[29:12] jude
[29:13] saw this danger this danger and this is
[29:17] what prompted him to write this letter
[29:19] and brother bannon said this here
[29:22] if we will go back
[29:24] to where they were first called saints
[29:28] and find out
[29:29] what kind of feed they had
[29:32] then we will know more or less
[29:35] what to contend for
[29:37] so you can't fight
[29:39] for something that you don't know what
[29:41] you're fighting for
[29:43] you see
[29:44] so if you're fighting for a watermelon
[29:46] and you don't know what it looked like
[29:47] and somebody says you have vine you
[29:49] could end up bringing a pumpkin because
[29:51] pumpkin roll and vinyls
[29:53] it has to be clean
[29:55] and clear
[29:56] what this feat is
[29:58] now if this fate is sitting down under
[30:01] the most
[30:02] uh knowledgeable preacher then all who
[30:05] understand the knowledge they have
[30:06] defeated every fate is sitting along
[30:09] under the preacher up and down the
[30:11] platform screaming and hollering and
[30:12] speaking and downs
[30:14] then those who under that then that's
[30:16] the fate but that's not so okay so he's
[30:19] saying that you have to go back
[30:21] and find out
[30:23] what kind of fate that they had
[30:25] and i want to say this people go to
[30:27] church catholic church mathis church
[30:28] dear witness church whatever church you
[30:30] could do and they just accept this is
[30:32] the church
[30:33] this is what they do this is what they
[30:35] teach this is what they say and i'm a
[30:37] believer i believe amen amen
[30:40] this here is not that
[30:42] this here
[30:43] is trying to get back to the original
[30:46] not a copy
[30:48] not a new uh con like a new version of
[30:52] it or new interpretation of it no you
[30:55] want exactly
[30:57] what is there in the original now let's
[30:59] continue now when the church was called
[31:03] was after they were sanctified
[31:06] the word sanctifier saint
[31:08] come from meaning clean
[31:11] pure
[31:12] holy
[31:13] unadulterated and so forth
[31:15] that was the beginning of the church
[31:18] when it was inoperated
[31:20] at the day of pentecost
[31:22] now let's look at what they had back
[31:24] here
[31:25] what that church contended for
[31:28] what they had lost
[31:30] just 33 years after the beginning of the
[31:33] church
[31:34] and you know that jude
[31:36] wouldn't be talking about back in the
[31:37] old testament on the levitical law see
[31:40] he is a christian
[31:42] he is talking about when the first
[31:45] church was set in order
[31:48] was inaugurated on the day of pentacles
[31:51] now
[31:52] we will notice
[31:53] what kind of fate that they had
[31:55] they had a fate
[31:57] in a resurrected living christ
[32:00] someone
[32:02] who rose from the dead
[32:05] and was living among them
[32:07] that is not
[32:09] the fivefold ministry
[32:12] that is what we're talking about is
[32:14] jesus christ
[32:16] raised from the dead
[32:18] alive among his people
[32:21] confirming his word with signs
[32:24] wonders
[32:25] and miracles let me read this again we
[32:28] will notice what kind of fate that they
[32:30] had
[32:32] listen to the fate
[32:33] they had a faith in
[32:36] a resurrected
[32:38] living christ
[32:40] someone
[32:41] who rose from the dead
[32:44] and was living among them
[32:47] just the same as he was before
[32:50] he ever died
[32:52] now
[32:53] it wasn't contended for some historical
[32:55] affair
[32:56] they were contending for a living christ
[33:00] a resurrected one
[33:02] who
[33:03] was in
[33:04] their midst
[33:05] and i
[33:07] declared tonight what he is speaking
[33:09] about here is not pastor
[33:12] prophet
[33:13] teacher evangelist or apostle it is not
[33:16] these men
[33:18] it is christ
[33:20] christ
[33:21] to be veiled in these men
[33:23] okay let's continue
[33:25] so now when he rose from the dead
[33:27] he done the same thing after he goes
[33:30] from the dead through
[33:32] the apostles
[33:33] that he did
[33:35] before he died
[33:37] even greater and more
[33:39] of it
[33:40] so you could see evidently that when
[33:42] christ was on the earth he turned water
[33:44] into whiny he multiplied the bread and
[33:46] fish he healed the sick he raised the
[33:48] dead okay
[33:50] you see him on the cross my god while
[33:52] forsaking me he's dead now
[33:54] but he rose from the dead
[33:57] and
[33:58] didn't appear in public
[34:00] so he didn't have a public ministry
[34:03] post-resurrection
[34:05] he had a private ministry
[34:07] in which he was dealing with only his
[34:09] disciples or elected
[34:12] be sanctified the preserved
[34:15] he was dealing with them
[34:17] because he had to bring a prophecy
[34:19] over their lives
[34:21] of this resurrected life coming into
[34:23] them
[34:25] previous before he died
[34:27] he told them i will not leave you
[34:28] comfortless
[34:30] i will come to you a little while the
[34:32] world sees me no more but you're gonna
[34:34] see me
[34:35] so he was prophesying to them that the
[34:37] father will send this comforter which is
[34:40] the holy ghost
[34:42] so all of this they were seated down
[34:44] with this now bear in mind
[34:46] these men had ministries these men had
[34:48] anointed these men cast out devils these
[34:51] men were sharing in the ministry of
[34:53] christ without having his ministry in
[34:56] them
[34:57] they were anointed to preach anointed to
[35:01] preach about the kingdom anointed to
[35:03] heal the sick they were anointed to do
[35:05] that but that anointing was a temporary
[35:10] power that was released to them
[35:12] to make them a partaker of christ's
[35:15] ministry
[35:16] so by the time christ finished they knew
[35:19] about all the manifestation that sons of
[35:22] god will do because they were
[35:23] participating in that and then
[35:26] when he stopped them from preaching and
[35:28] said don't even cut it out no more
[35:30] preaching for you right now just stop
[35:32] because you have to get power for the
[35:34] next phase for the next level then and
[35:37] then
[35:38] he opened it understand to the
[35:40] scriptures
[35:41] and then open those scriptures to them
[35:44] and then open their understanding you
[35:46] need both not only must the word open to
[35:49] you but your understanding must open us
[35:52] so it's just like fatherhood
[35:55] maybe you never consider the depth of
[35:57] what a father is
[35:58] and when that open up to you
[36:01] then you look in the mirror and when you
[36:02] look you see how short you are
[36:05] then you want to talk you want to mesh
[36:07] up to that line of what a father really
[36:09] is
[36:10] or what a mother really is or what our
[36:13] wife really is you know some i know i've
[36:16] strained a little bit you know but the
[36:18] thing of it is sometimes we take things
[36:20] for granted a wife is somebody who might
[36:22] wash clothes and cook food and creepy
[36:24] hugs and you know i do certain things
[36:26] but sometimes when you drill down when
[36:28] you drive slow there is so much depth
[36:32] to our lives and purpose that you need
[36:34] to really look again and but this even
[36:36] brought that tremendous thought last
[36:37] tuesday about in the house of different
[36:40] vessels different purposes
[36:42] the king have gold cup and you know
[36:44] different purpose and whatever you have
[36:45] to find
[36:46] your value
[36:48] your goal what you are in god and how
[36:51] god wants to use you you have to find
[36:53] that spot but jude here he was pressing
[36:57] his way to to declare something so let's
[36:59] continue here
[37:01] now in the amplified
[37:03] of this same verse 3
[37:06] it says beloved my whole concern
[37:10] was to write to you in regard to our
[37:13] common salvation
[37:15] but i found it necessary and was
[37:18] impelled to write you an urgently appeal
[37:22] to and exhort you to contend for the
[37:26] faith which was once for all handed down
[37:29] to the saints
[37:30] the fate which is that some of christian
[37:33] belief
[37:34] which was delivered verbally to the holy
[37:37] people of god
[37:39] for there was certain men crept in
[37:41] unawares and that's the next scripture
[37:44] one thing we want to read it and that is
[37:46] verse four
[37:47] for there were certain men if you have a
[37:49] bible just watch
[37:50] crept in unawares
[37:53] who were before of all
[37:55] ordained to this condemnation
[37:58] and he is describing the men ungodly men
[38:02] turning the grace of our god into las
[38:04] difficulties
[38:05] and denying the only lord god and our
[38:09] lord jesus christ
[38:10] and the amplified they say for certain
[38:12] men have crept instiltively
[38:16] gaining entrance secretly
[38:18] by a sido now
[38:21] when
[38:22] i read this i don't want you to
[38:24] generalize and say you know certain men
[38:28] what jude is talking about is ministers
[38:30] pastors so-called apostles so-called
[38:33] prophets so-called evangelists
[38:37] let me say it good again
[38:39] it's not this man with a top hat and you
[38:41] don't know
[38:42] men no no point you think all about
[38:45] is men alive and kicking right now
[38:48] men in the pulpit right now men going to
[38:51] be fulfilled right now then we just walk
[38:52] away pulpit right now
[38:54] is these men we talking about
[38:56] and you would found it necessary
[38:59] and i think brother isaac i was a
[39:01] message that really
[39:02] was very inspiring to me about be not
[39:05] deceived don't be deceived
[39:07] because jesus won many false prophets
[39:10] arise
[39:11] so this is not just about um saints and
[39:15] and and and all the positives and all
[39:17] the you know the lift you up and to
[39:19] bring up this is also warning you from
[39:23] being naive
[39:26] in other words you're kind of
[39:30] smart by your you know you you can strip
[39:33] it
[39:34] yeah you're not acting with the wisdom
[39:36] of god to understand
[39:38] and it have crazies out there
[39:41] it has falsehood out there
[39:43] it have false teachers
[39:45] we're not against anybody yet i'll give
[39:47] an example
[39:52] something let's just shift gears a
[39:54] little bit samson
[39:58] didn't want
[39:59] and didn't find a girlfriend among the
[40:01] israel girls
[40:04] i'll just say it this way he'd go on any
[40:05] bush
[40:06] and find him
[40:09] out of
[40:10] the feet
[40:13] and
[40:14] because he like this girl
[40:16] he feel it's supposed to work out
[40:20] now samson is using his five senses
[40:25] he's out of defeat
[40:26] because faith
[40:28] pushes you
[40:30] beyond the five senses
[40:32] know what samson is not singing
[40:35] because that woman is not covenanted
[40:39] she is also
[40:41] a tool for the devil to use
[40:45] he's not seeing that
[40:47] he is seeing
[40:48] love and like
[40:50] and angie nice
[40:52] and whatever whatever you want to talk
[40:54] about
[40:55] what sam if sam's not pulled back and
[40:57] think it over and recognize wait a
[40:59] minute
[41:00] you mean
[41:01] my enemy could use that
[41:03] so i have to keep an extra eye out that
[41:06] is what he was supposed to do
[41:08] okay
[41:09] so sometimes so i like how the bible
[41:11] described this men slipped in
[41:14] crept in it's not so so these men is not
[41:18] overnight guys they're just banging do i
[41:21] i am i'm the messiah you know everybody
[41:22] knows
[41:24] who are you no they're slipping slowly
[41:27] crapped in by the side door people shake
[41:29] their hand god bless my brother and
[41:31] think like that if there's a brother he
[41:33] has preached and his gay people woke up
[41:34] saying email email emails wait for him
[41:37] watch him and afterwards he back back he
[41:39] brought back out of his own
[41:40] interpretation right there in his back
[41:42] so he gave you a good word
[41:44] that you know is true and he wanted amen
[41:46] amen amen when you have your heart with
[41:49] a man you don't want any black bags
[41:51] and drop his own revelation
[41:53] and if you don't work sharp you're
[41:54] saying he meant to that too
[41:56] so you have to watch these guys
[42:00] and as your pastor i'm telling you that
[42:02] it has flickers all day
[42:04] flickers out there no in this social
[42:06] media age like my sister
[42:09] she work in hospital and so on she said
[42:11] if it had
[42:12] social media anytime i pull you he said
[42:15] all the countries will have endless
[42:17] polio people with their foolishness
[42:19] because liars everybody with a camera
[42:21] could see something on facebook anybody
[42:23] in vaccine and immaculate beast and all
[42:25] kind of nonsense if this
[42:27] is this social media crap was back there
[42:31] the world wasn't going wasn't even going
[42:33] to get water pull you that's so much a
[42:34] diseases and sickness and balaam say you
[42:36] wish to get the indoctrination of cancer
[42:39] man if scientists when you say that i'm
[42:40] definitely cancer you will hear his
[42:42] empires i have taken
[42:46] what are they listening to
[42:48] what are people hearing
[42:50] you know what it's something in the
[42:52] system they like
[42:54] i can train everyone's talking about
[43:04] will be protected because right now it
[43:06] has gone down it has mutated downwards
[43:08] into like a common cold i'm i'm glad i
[43:11] am glad i want to be out of it i want to
[43:13] be but let me tell you something since
[43:15] i'll tell you as your pastor if i have
[43:17] to take this boost every year i taken it
[43:19] every year
[43:21] i am 10 like if every year i get a job
[43:23] i'm taking a job immaculately every year
[43:27] every year who want to see marketing
[43:28] beasts and they talk foolishness they're
[43:30] talking crap
[43:31] they're talking foolishness every year i
[43:33] will take
[43:34] okay because i'm here on the street and
[43:36] i have a choice i have a mind no
[43:38] minister will just swing my head and
[43:39] swim around
[43:41] no
[43:41] they are doctors mind you on basically
[43:43] any pulpit they have no qualification
[43:45] they give no pronunciation over medical
[43:48] issues you want a a legal issue you go
[43:50] to a lawyer you don't go to a pastor you
[43:52] want a medical issue you go to a doctor
[43:54] he's not he's he's not he's not a doctor
[43:57] you know you're your pastor many some
[43:58] people come to me with things that say
[43:59] that is about my pay grade i i can't
[44:02] answer that i can't talk about that yes
[44:04] go could inspire certain things sure but
[44:07] i cannot uh do like if i'm exploiting
[44:09] this and expressing that no i'm called
[44:12] to preach the word and i'm content for
[44:14] the faith and this is what we're doing
[44:15] tonight fighting for defeat so
[44:19] jude
[44:20] jude didn't want to go here but he had
[44:23] to
[44:24] because it was critical
[44:26] what was coming up on the church
[44:28] and this facebook and social media and
[44:31] whatsapp have been so destructive
[44:33] it has been more destructive than we
[44:35] thinking
[44:36] it's more than forwards and forward and
[44:38] forward and people ain't thinking no
[44:40] just forward to something forward is
[44:41] something forwarding something it is
[44:42] very destructive
[44:44] and the time people spend in social
[44:46] media if they spend it in prayer it
[44:48] might have been so much different now
[44:50] so i digest a digression and a whole
[44:53] different thing there but let's continue
[44:55] praise the name of the lord your love
[44:56] and tonight
[44:58] o blessed be near the lord so
[45:00] therefore
[45:02] oh christ let's continue
[45:06] so so the what the fate that they had
[45:08] was in christ
[45:10] being resurrected among us
[45:13] and you know brother branham he would
[45:14] say you know what i'm waiting on
[45:16] i don't know if you come out here i'm
[45:17] waiting to injure the lord and then we
[45:19] say angel is here he is here
[45:21] no brother brown is not the angel
[45:24] he is waiting on the angel
[45:26] he as a human being says i can do
[45:28] nothing i
[45:29] am depending on him i'm looking to him i
[45:32] am not it i am written for it when it
[45:34] comes it's a different thing all
[45:36] together i get a super charge it's one
[45:37] anointing i take every spirit under my
[45:39] control for the glory of god and the
[45:41] whole you know drama set behind here
[45:44] okay
[45:46] so then jude says here for there were
[45:48] certain men
[45:49] crept in unawares who were before of all
[45:52] ordained
[45:54] to this condemnation
[45:57] [Music]
[45:58] he said no during the time
[46:01] 32 years of last there come many false
[46:04] brethren
[46:05] who raised up
[46:07] and brought in heresies
[46:10] and brought people off the theology and
[46:12] different things like that
[46:14] and as paul i think of him playing here
[46:17] they come and told him this little jew
[46:19] with his little hooked nose laying down
[46:21] here in prison
[46:22] the chains around him around his ankles
[46:24] and so forth and say well
[46:26] he says some is preaching christ for
[46:28] gain some is trillion and others
[46:29] disciples aside
[46:31] there it began to organize and god great
[46:34] organization and so forth
[46:36] so let's continue to verse
[46:39] five
[46:40] and
[46:41] you know
[46:43] when jude spoke
[46:45] about contending for defeat
[46:48] he didn't say how
[46:51] how to contend
[46:53] he did that
[46:55] when we go down to verse 20 and lower 20
[46:58] 22 23
[47:00] but what he was caught up in
[47:02] is identifying
[47:05] what was the results of false teachings
[47:09] false leadership
[47:11] false leaders
[47:13] and the first example we give
[47:16] was in verse 5
[47:18] and we read this
[47:20] i will therefore
[47:22] put you in remembrance though you knew
[47:24] this
[47:25] how that the lord
[47:27] having saved the people out of the land
[47:30] of egypt afterwards
[47:32] destroyed them
[47:34] that believe not
[47:36] now remember
[47:40] the warning that i give
[47:42] the bible studies about two weeks ago
[47:45] when we read from first corinthians
[47:47] chapter 10
[47:49] that all all fathers were under the
[47:51] cloud
[47:52] all baptized into moses
[47:54] all eat the same spiritual meat
[47:57] all drink the same spiritual drink
[48:01] but what many of them god was not well
[48:03] pleased
[48:04] for they were overthrown in the
[48:06] wilderness
[48:07] and these things
[48:10] were
[48:11] for our examples
[48:14] to the intent
[48:15] we should not lust after evil things as
[48:17] they also lusted
[48:19] neither be you idolaters as they some of
[48:21] them and as a written the people sat
[48:23] down to eat who's up to play
[48:26] neither commit fornication some of them
[48:28] committed and fell in one day three and
[48:30] twenty thousand they attempted christ
[48:31] and they went down the stairs that and
[48:33] so and these things
[48:35] happen unto them
[48:37] for examples and they're written for our
[48:40] admission admonition upon whom the ends
[48:43] of the world
[48:44] are come
[48:46] so what jew did here the first reference
[48:49] he gave
[48:51] was how
[48:52] the people came out of egypt and got
[48:54] destroyed
[48:55] and you know
[48:57] of time you hear me say this message has
[48:59] never encountered god's judgment
[49:02] message don't know what god's judgment
[49:04] is
[49:05] that is why
[49:06] a lot of things go
[49:08] seemingly unpunished
[49:11] seemingly untouched
[49:13] and people take for granted because they
[49:15] believe
[49:16] they are fine
[49:18] they'll read the bible it is the lord
[49:20] they believe a prophet and they're good
[49:22] to go
[49:23] that is not the scriptures
[49:26] our type
[49:28] in going into the scriptures when you
[49:29] look at our time
[49:31] you'd realize the same people that god
[49:36] called out he destroyed
[49:39] because the word they heard will not mix
[49:42] with faith and we could see it
[49:45] and that's why we tell you ask god for
[49:47] divine revelation and brother anthony
[49:50] was tremendous on sunday to have true
[49:52] revelation give you a feed for the
[49:53] promise
[49:54] because with true revelation there is
[49:57] clarity because the uncertain
[49:59] inspiration comes from god straightened
[50:01] down into your heart
[50:03] because it is the operation of the
[50:04] spirit
[50:05] not your study
[50:07] not your mental faculties but the
[50:10] operation of the spirit so that's why by
[50:12] faith enoch by faith
[50:14] by faith
[50:15] it was revelation revolution is free
[50:19] so are you with me tonight
[50:20] so later on we would see what this fear
[50:23] is he's talking about how to get it how
[50:26] to get to it or praise the lord okay
[50:29] so watch
[50:31] he began to go and talk about and then
[50:33] he then in chapter six he said and the
[50:36] angels
[50:37] which kept not their first estate left
[50:40] their own habitation
[50:42] he has reserved an everlasting chain
[50:44] under darkness
[50:46] unto the judgment
[50:47] of the great day
[50:49] and verse seven
[50:51] he gave another pointed reference
[50:53] even as solomon gomorrah
[50:56] and the cities about them in a like
[50:58] manner given themselves over the
[51:00] fornication
[51:01] going after strange flesh a set forth as
[51:05] an example
[51:06] suffering the vengeance
[51:08] of eternal fire
[51:11] likewise also
[51:13] these filthy dreamers speaking about
[51:15] these guys
[51:16] defile the flesh
[51:19] despised dominion
[51:22] and speak evil of dignitaries
[51:26] you know what that is in the amplified
[51:28] nevertheless in like manner these
[51:31] dreamers also corrupt the body
[51:34] scorn and reject authority and
[51:38] government let me read that back again
[51:41] i apologize
[51:49] to set an order
[51:51] settings in order
[51:53] nevertheless
[51:55] this is amplified in like manner
[51:58] these dreamers also corrupt the body
[52:01] scorn
[52:03] and reject authority
[52:05] and
[52:06] government
[52:07] and revile and libel and discover
[52:10] heavenly glorious the glorious one
[52:13] wow
[52:15] this nine said yet michael the archangel
[52:17] when contend with the devil
[52:19] he disputed about the body of moses does
[52:22] not bring against him a reeling
[52:24] accusation but said the lord
[52:26] rebuked thee
[52:29] so jude now
[52:31] is drilling down
[52:33] into the characteristics of these guys
[52:37] and these speak evil of those things
[52:40] which they know not
[52:42] but what they know naturally has been
[52:45] beast
[52:46] in those things they corrupt themselves
[52:49] grow unto them
[52:51] he's calling judgment
[52:53] for they have gone in the way of cain
[52:55] and ran greatly
[52:57] after the era of balaam for reward
[53:00] and perished
[53:02] in the gain saying of korra
[53:05] verse 12
[53:07] these are
[53:08] you how we describe them spots in your
[53:10] feast of charity
[53:12] when they feast with you
[53:15] feeding themselves without fear
[53:18] clouds they are without water this one
[53:20] is a big one
[53:22] clouds they are
[53:24] without water
[53:26] you know you know when you see clouds
[53:28] setting up you guys have rain coming
[53:29] you're looking for rain you're looking
[53:30] for water and these are just
[53:33] blusters
[53:35] bluffers
[53:36] i call them mount champions
[53:38] clouds they are without water
[53:40] carried about of winds
[53:43] trees
[53:44] whose fruit withered look at the
[53:45] description judas beginner
[53:48] not only were they original
[53:50] but without fruit
[53:52] twice dead
[53:54] plucked up by the roots
[53:56] raging waves of the sea
[53:59] forming out of their own shame
[54:02] wandering stars
[54:04] to whom
[54:05] is reserved the blackness
[54:08] of darkness forever
[54:11] this is these people
[54:12] who are spiral
[54:14] spoken on workbooks
[54:16] claiming
[54:17] they're preaching the message
[54:19] sometime back we read for you i believe
[54:21] was in ezekiel
[54:22] where god was warning people about false
[54:24] prophets and he said i did not speak to
[54:26] them
[54:28] and i did not send them
[54:30] and yet they speak in my name
[54:33] this is almighty god telling the prophet
[54:36] these guys are speaking in my name and i
[54:40] did not speak to them
[54:42] i did not call them
[54:43] who called them
[54:45] who sent them
[54:47] so listen scenes
[54:49] it will come down now to
[54:52] to the british
[54:54] when he tired hit the road will come
[54:56] unto brassiere
[54:57] it will come down to let the god of
[54:59] answer by fire let him be gorgeous
[55:02] it will come down to a little more than
[55:04] talk no argument with men
[55:07] it will be god vindicates in his word or
[55:10] ibraheem prophesied
[55:12] when charity comes down
[55:14] seal all the virtues in he said when
[55:17] that time comes then you will see
[55:20] vindicated sons and
[55:22] vindicated daughters not just sons so he
[55:24] is not talking about men behind the
[55:27] pulpit because sisters not beyond the
[55:28] pulpit
[55:29] but there is going to be vindicated sons
[55:32] and vindicated daughters okay this is
[55:35] what is promised nobody could keep that
[55:38] from you this is your promise no
[55:40] minister no pastor no bishop could keep
[55:42] that from you do you believe that
[55:42] tonight could we give the lord some
[55:44] praises tonight
[55:46] okay so
[55:49] um
[55:50] so then it went into verse 14
[55:53] and enoch also received from adam
[55:55] prophesied of these saying behold the
[55:57] lord cometh with ten thousand of his
[55:59] saints to execute judgment upon all
[56:02] to convince all that are ungodly among
[56:06] them
[56:06] of all the ungodly deeds which they have
[56:09] ungodly committed and of all the hard
[56:12] speeches which ungodly sinners have
[56:15] spoke against him
[56:17] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[56:20] blessed be the name of the lord
[56:22] thank you jesus
[56:25] and then it went on to say you know
[56:27] wow who's 16. these are murmurs
[56:33] check check check them out
[56:35] complainers
[56:37] walking after their own lust
[56:39] and their mouth speaker great
[56:42] swelling words
[56:44] having men's persons
[56:46] in admiration because of advantage and
[56:49] it was 6016
[56:50] [Music]
[56:52] in the amplified it says here these are
[56:54] inveterate murmurs grumblers
[56:57] who complain
[56:58] of their lot in life
[57:00] going after their own desires
[57:03] controlled by their passions
[57:06] their talk is boastful and arrogant and
[57:09] they claim to admire men's person and
[57:12] play people flattering compliments
[57:15] to gain advantage so these are some real
[57:19] hyphen
[57:20] manipulators
[57:21] flatter you
[57:23] to work you over
[57:24] and my goodness you remember
[57:26] uh when we just have first seminar and
[57:28] talking about complimenting your
[57:30] children and your daughters and
[57:32] different things like that if you don't
[57:34] compliment your child until they're
[57:36] looking nice and whatnot the day some
[57:37] man tell them hey sweetie
[57:49] and we have to do these things we have
[57:51] to really show love one to another and
[57:53] show that this is a community of christ
[57:56] a body of christ a church that that that
[57:59] expresses by this shall all men know
[58:01] that recycles you know and these people
[58:03] fighting the law of the land and what
[58:05] the government say and he put a call and
[58:07] they want to fight it and fight out
[58:08] israel foolishness when god brought
[58:11] israel out
[58:13] and he said bring them to this mountain
[58:14] was to give them laws
[58:16] true laws you have a society
[58:20] that's why the bible talked about pray
[58:21] for the governor pray for the kings as
[58:24] much as possible if peace be with all
[58:25] men is laws that
[58:28] that give us the opportunity to have
[58:30] what we call a society if there was no
[58:32] laws anybody could just come and take
[58:33] your house take a car do whatever they
[58:36] want to do because there is no laws
[58:37] there's no penalties we have to have
[58:39] laws god have laws
[58:44] let me say it again we have to have laws
[58:47] god have laws man have lost you can't
[58:50] just walk in the airplane and you're no
[58:52] passport you're just here if you take a
[58:54] flight how much it costs you
[58:56] say passport i have a passport i don't
[58:58] want to paddle in your passport
[59:00] well the law is to throw you out
[59:02] because you need to get a passport to
[59:04] get on the plane to pay for a ticket to
[59:06] go on the plane
[59:07] so god have laws also you must be born
[59:10] again
[59:11] by jesus for his message
[59:14] you must receive the holy ghost then you
[59:16] should want the holy ghost
[59:18] you have to have a revival
[59:20] understand this if you don't fight to
[59:22] live you will die
[59:24] this fighting for defeat is fighting for
[59:26] your breakthrough it's fighting for your
[59:28] life it's fighting for your anchor for
[59:30] your whole this is your faith this is
[59:32] defeat this is what the saints was
[59:34] delivered to the saints and you want
[59:36] that for your own life for your family
[59:39] so you see what i'm saying tonight oh
[59:41] blessed be the name of the lord oh let
[59:43] me see if i could just
[59:45] get down here now
[59:46] these are murmurs
[59:50] no it's interesting i'm going to stop
[59:52] here and come back to it
[59:54] that in second peter 2
[59:56] i think you could just flick there
[59:58] quickly um second peter two
[1:00:01] it's impressive how these brothers so
[1:00:04] much in the spirit and they're almost
[1:00:06] saying the same thing in second peter
[1:00:07] two
[1:00:08] reading from verse one
[1:00:10] peter's saying this but there were false
[1:00:11] prophets also among the people
[1:00:14] even as there shall be
[1:00:17] false teachers among you
[1:00:19] so peter is prophesying all right
[1:00:21] who privily shall bring in tamil
[1:00:24] heresies
[1:00:26] even denying the law that brought them
[1:00:28] and bring them upon themselves sweep the
[1:00:30] structure
[1:00:31] and many shall follow their pernicious
[1:00:34] weeds
[1:00:35] so if you're looking where the crowd
[1:00:36] going look look the crowd right here
[1:00:39] many shall follow
[1:00:41] the pernicious ways by reason of whom
[1:00:44] the way of truth shall be even spoken of
[1:00:47] and through covetousness shall the fake
[1:00:51] words make merchandise of you whose
[1:00:53] judgment know for a long time the
[1:00:55] lingering knot and the damnation islam
[1:00:57] right now
[1:00:58] and here peter gone down drilling just
[1:01:00] like jude
[1:01:01] for if god
[1:01:03] speared not the angels that sinned
[1:01:07] but cast them down to hell and delivered
[1:01:11] them
[1:01:12] into chains of darkness
[1:01:14] to be reserved unto judgment
[1:01:17] and spared not the old world but save
[1:01:19] noah the eighth person a preacher of
[1:01:22] righteousness bringing in the flood upon
[1:01:24] the world of the ungodly
[1:01:27] and turning the cities of sodom and
[1:01:28] gomorrah into ashes
[1:01:31] condemn them with an overthrow making
[1:01:33] them an example unto those that after
[1:01:37] should live ungodly
[1:01:38] and deliver just lot vexed
[1:01:41] with the filthy
[1:01:42] conversations of the wicked which is
[1:01:45] for the righteous man dwelling among
[1:01:47] them in seeing and hearing vexed his
[1:01:49] righteous soul
[1:01:50] from day to day with their unlawful
[1:01:52] deeds
[1:01:53] the lord
[1:01:54] knew it
[1:01:56] how to deliver the godly out of
[1:01:58] temptation
[1:01:59] but to reserve the unjust unto the day
[1:02:02] of judgment to be punished
[1:02:05] but chiefly them
[1:02:07] that walk after the flesh
[1:02:09] in the lust of uncleanness
[1:02:12] and despise government here we go again
[1:02:15] presumptuous are they
[1:02:18] self-willed they are not afraid to speak
[1:02:21] evil of dignity
[1:02:23] whereas angels
[1:02:25] which are greater in power and might
[1:02:27] bring not a real accusation against them
[1:02:29] before the lord
[1:02:31] but these as natural brute beats
[1:02:34] look at the terminology peters use it
[1:02:36] very similar to what judas used
[1:02:39] make to be taken and destroyed
[1:02:42] speak evil of things that they
[1:02:44] understand not
[1:02:46] and shall utterly perish in their own
[1:02:48] corruption
[1:02:49] and shall receive yet
[1:02:52] the reward
[1:02:53] of unrighteousness
[1:02:56] as they that counted pleasure to riot in
[1:02:59] the daytime spots they are
[1:03:01] blemishes
[1:03:02] sporting themselves with their own
[1:03:04] deceivings while they feast with you
[1:03:08] having eyes
[1:03:10] full of adultery
[1:03:12] and cannot cease from sin
[1:03:14] beguiling unstable souls so these
[1:03:18] characters spirits people they're not
[1:03:20] they're staying by themselves
[1:03:22] but they dare
[1:03:24] to beguile
[1:03:25] deceive bewitched
[1:03:27] unstable souls
[1:03:28] and heart they have exercise with
[1:03:31] confucius practices cursed children
[1:03:35] which are forsaken the right way
[1:03:37] and are going astray
[1:03:39] following the ways of being i'm the son
[1:03:40] of bonzo who love the wages of
[1:03:43] righteousness but was rebuked for his
[1:03:45] iniquity the dumb ass speaking with
[1:03:47] man's voice forbid the madness of the
[1:03:50] prophet
[1:03:50] these are the intervals related to jude
[1:03:53] wells without water
[1:03:55] clouds that are carried with a tempest
[1:03:57] to whom the midst of darkness is
[1:03:59] reserved forever
[1:04:01] for when they speak
[1:04:03] great swelling words of vanity they
[1:04:05] allure to the lusts of the flesh too
[1:04:08] much wantedness those that were clean
[1:04:10] escaped from them who live in error
[1:04:13] while they promise them liberty
[1:04:16] they themselves are the servants of
[1:04:18] corruption
[1:04:20] for of whom a man is overcome of the
[1:04:23] same is he brought in bondage for if
[1:04:26] after they have escaped the pollution of
[1:04:28] the world through the knowledge of the
[1:04:30] lord savior jesus christ they again
[1:04:33] entangled therein and overcome the
[1:04:36] latter is worse with them than the
[1:04:38] beginning for it is better for them
[1:04:42] not to have known the way of
[1:04:43] righteousness
[1:04:45] than after they have known it to turn
[1:04:48] from the holy commandment delivered unto
[1:04:50] them
[1:04:51] but it is happening to them according to
[1:04:52] the trooper verb the dog is turned into
[1:04:56] his own vomit again and this fool that
[1:04:58] was washed to her swallowing in the man
[1:05:01] so saints i want to wrap that up there
[1:05:04] and then we're going to go to our climax
[1:05:06] of
[1:05:07] where jude
[1:05:08] was bringing back now to the things
[1:05:11] how
[1:05:12] [Music]
[1:05:13] to contend for this feat how to get that
[1:05:15] feet how to keep that feet and here we
[1:05:17] find it
[1:05:18] uh verse 17. and this is where we're
[1:05:21] going to hit the home stretch here now
[1:05:22] from verse 17.
[1:05:25] praise the name of the lord
[1:05:27] verse 17. look at these words now but
[1:05:30] beloved
[1:05:31] remember ye
[1:05:33] the words which were spoken before of
[1:05:36] the apostles of our lord jesus christ
[1:05:38] how that they told you
[1:05:40] that there would be markers in the last
[1:05:42] time
[1:05:44] who
[1:05:45] should walk after their own ungodly lust
[1:05:49] these be they who separate themselves
[1:05:52] sensual
[1:05:53] having not discovered
[1:05:55] and here we go this is our voice here
[1:05:57] now
[1:05:57] but beloved
[1:05:59] building up yourselves
[1:06:02] on your most holy fate
[1:06:05] praying in the holy ghost
[1:06:07] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:06:10] and in the amplified it says but you
[1:06:12] beloved
[1:06:14] build yourself up
[1:06:16] founded on your most holy fate
[1:06:20] make progress
[1:06:22] rise like an edifice higher and higher
[1:06:25] praying in the holy spirit
[1:06:26] so jude here
[1:06:28] is comparing this faith as a building
[1:06:30] which we know is the pyramid
[1:06:32] okay and it's starting that fate so you
[1:06:35] could say build yourself up on your most
[1:06:38] holy fate
[1:06:39] pray in the holy ghost
[1:06:41] keep yourselves in the love of god
[1:06:45] looking for the mercy of our lord jesus
[1:06:47] christ and eternal life
[1:06:49] enough
[1:06:51] some
[1:06:52] of compassion
[1:06:55] making a difference
[1:06:57] oh my
[1:07:00] verse 21
[1:07:01] it says
[1:07:02] god
[1:07:03] keep yourself in the love of god
[1:07:06] expect
[1:07:07] and patiently wait for the mercy of our
[1:07:09] lord jesus christ which will bring you
[1:07:11] life eternal
[1:07:15] verse 22
[1:07:17] i don't know some have mercy who weaver
[1:07:20] and doubt
[1:07:21] and this here
[1:07:23] is the anchor point tonight
[1:07:25] of
[1:07:27] true broadly kindness
[1:07:29] and of some
[1:07:31] have compassion
[1:07:33] making a difference
[1:07:36] between the brute beasts
[1:07:38] and those are
[1:07:40] failing
[1:07:41] who have garments spotted by the flesh
[1:07:43] let's read on verse 22.
[1:07:45] let's verse 22 again
[1:07:47] and of some of compassion
[1:07:49] making a difference
[1:07:51] and others
[1:07:53] save it fear
[1:07:56] pulling them out of the fire
[1:07:58] hating even the garment
[1:08:01] spotted by the flesh
[1:08:04] i want to pause here tonight
[1:08:07] you know
[1:08:10] god is able to
[1:08:12] keep you
[1:08:13] i want you to have confidence and faith
[1:08:15] in that
[1:08:17] that god wants you to stand
[1:08:19] having an all to stand
[1:08:21] stand
[1:08:24] if you don't have a revelation of the
[1:08:25] faith
[1:08:27] that god released
[1:08:29] then any winner doctrine could blow you
[1:08:31] aside
[1:08:32] any talk any any win anybody say
[1:08:34] something just sweep you off but if you
[1:08:38] are convinced that this word is true
[1:08:42] and this
[1:08:44] this fate was delivered
[1:08:46] but the branham went about to restore it
[1:08:49] that's why we have all these
[1:08:50] manifestations and testimonies and god
[1:08:53] bless and confirm his ministry and
[1:08:55] vindicate him as dedicated him as that
[1:08:58] elijah
[1:08:59] then we have prophetic questions that we
[1:09:00] could hold on to
[1:09:03] but
[1:09:04] here it is
[1:09:06] the next book is the book of revelation
[1:09:09] the next book is the capstone
[1:09:11] and here it is right before that book of
[1:09:14] revelation
[1:09:16] the book of the apocalypse the book of
[1:09:18] the
[1:09:19] right before the unfeeling of god
[1:09:23] here it is you have
[1:09:25] and if some
[1:09:26] have compassion
[1:09:29] making a difference
[1:09:31] we have to be able to make a difference
[1:09:34] with people who have no revelation
[1:09:37] and people who are arrogant
[1:09:39] unwilling to obey
[1:09:41] and follow god's program and plan
[1:09:45] it is not
[1:09:46] the same
[1:09:48] and god
[1:09:50] who have extended mercy and grace to us
[1:09:54] he would check out
[1:09:55] and he will ensure
[1:09:58] that we have this opportunity
[1:10:00] that we could extend grace to others
[1:10:04] if you extend grace to someone
[1:10:07] and you have to make a big boost about
[1:10:08] it
[1:10:09] i don't understand that one
[1:10:13] because when god extends grace to you it
[1:10:16] was no big scene you were grateful
[1:10:19] and you were thankful
[1:10:21] and you could raise your hands because
[1:10:22] god has been merciful to you
[1:10:25] i want to see you i'm not talking down
[1:10:26] to you now you and i what has been
[1:10:28] merciful to me
[1:10:30] and because god extends grace to you he
[1:10:32] looks to see
[1:10:34] how you will extend grace to others
[1:10:37] so somebody may do something in the
[1:10:38] flesh
[1:10:40] may do you something that was
[1:10:41] unwarranted may even lie on you says
[1:10:44] something falsely about you
[1:10:46] and yet
[1:10:47] god is not testing that person
[1:10:50] god is testing you
[1:10:52] because you
[1:10:54] have to go into this next book
[1:10:56] or next door
[1:10:59] and next door is a rapture
[1:11:01] next door is the revelation of jesus
[1:11:03] christ
[1:11:04] next door is come up hither
[1:11:06] next door is the climax or the harvest
[1:11:09] of the entire bible genesis 3 chapter
[1:11:12] revolution is the harvest right next
[1:11:14] door
[1:11:15] and you would understand
[1:11:18] where brotherly kindness is placed
[1:11:21] in the pyramid right on top of that
[1:11:24] have this
[1:11:25] holy spirit sloth
[1:11:27] that is where you belong
[1:11:30] that is where you want to go
[1:11:32] as many as are led by the spirit they
[1:11:34] are the sons of god they that are in the
[1:11:36] flesh cannot please god cannot be
[1:11:40] subject to the program of god
[1:11:42] so the object
[1:11:44] is to get us more into the spirit
[1:11:47] that god could have the preeminences the
[1:11:50] object is to get us
[1:11:52] malleable
[1:11:53] you know like when you're using putty
[1:11:55] sometimes you put to get hard
[1:11:57] and then they put some oil in the potty
[1:12:00] and then you put the oil in the putty
[1:12:01] and it didn't become malleable when you
[1:12:04] could press it
[1:12:05] okay when you could press it and when
[1:12:06] you could knead it and press it and
[1:12:09] shape it
[1:12:10] and then it could shape that putty into
[1:12:13] how you want it
[1:12:14] and we have to be like putty in gorgeous
[1:12:17] hands
[1:12:18] that he could make us malleable and
[1:12:20] shape us and press us
[1:12:22] however you want us to be
[1:12:24] and we could fit into god's program
[1:12:27] because the pyramid as you know not even
[1:12:29] a razor could go between the edge
[1:12:32] it was so well put together
[1:12:34] that
[1:12:38] with the pyramid
[1:12:39] nothing in between perfect
[1:12:42] and then paul talked about charity the
[1:12:44] bond of perfectness to come and seal the
[1:12:46] whole building cut out all the leaks in
[1:12:48] your life
[1:12:49] if you could have a leak in patience you
[1:12:51] can have a leaking temperance you have a
[1:12:53] leak here leak there yes you have but
[1:12:55] things are leaking out because you're
[1:12:56] not sealed yet
[1:12:58] with charity
[1:12:59] the bond of perfectness
[1:13:01] they get the charity we have to get to
[1:13:03] the seventh step
[1:13:04] the seventh step is really love
[1:13:07] the seventh step is where we have the
[1:13:09] opportunity to express and manifest the
[1:13:12] compassion of god his compassion
[1:13:15] and this is what was demonstrated when
[1:13:17] the two people came making love in the
[1:13:19] church and go to the prophet whatever
[1:13:21] you say will be happening to these
[1:13:23] people if they say die they will die we
[1:13:25] say blind they'll be blind and god gave
[1:13:27] him the whole list of what he could
[1:13:29] choose from
[1:13:30] and you know what
[1:13:32] because of this spirit life in him he
[1:13:35] said i forgive you
[1:13:37] and you know what he said behind that
[1:13:39] because he would have done things wrong
[1:13:41] he would have acted wrong inside he
[1:13:43] needed god's forgiveness
[1:13:44] and even those these people were
[1:13:46] terrible
[1:13:47] carrying on in church
[1:13:48] and you could say they deserve the
[1:13:51] judgment of god yet a man of god stood
[1:13:53] there and said i forgive you and god was
[1:13:55] pleased
[1:13:58] right at country when they bowling
[1:14:00] crucify him and all these people coming
[1:14:02] out to see our next man crucified jesus
[1:14:04] your father forgive them
[1:14:06] they don't even know what they're doing
[1:14:08] you want to tell me
[1:14:10] in your christian life
[1:14:12] in your christian work
[1:14:14] you have never recognized that you have
[1:14:17] been wrong
[1:14:17] [Music]
[1:14:19] to tell someone forgive me
[1:14:22] i'm sorry
[1:14:24] please forgive me
[1:14:26] you mean in your christian walk
[1:14:28] you have never had the experience
[1:14:31] of seeing how sorry you are wrong you
[1:14:34] are or
[1:14:35] forgiving someone who come to you and
[1:14:37] said forgive me
[1:14:39] i'm sorry
[1:14:40] you mean that has never been part of
[1:14:42] your christian world
[1:14:45] how you could go to the next step
[1:14:48] how do you know you have this
[1:14:49] forgiveness this kindness
[1:14:52] this is
[1:14:53] god's kindness
[1:14:55] even when they ask jesus teach us how to
[1:14:58] pray
[1:14:59] forgive us as we forgive those who
[1:15:01] trespass against us
[1:15:03] forgive us
[1:15:04] as
[1:15:05] we this is jesus now this is not brother
[1:15:08] we're trying to make up a prayer
[1:15:10] this is jesus
[1:15:12] showing you the conditionality
[1:15:14] of you
[1:15:16] forgiving others
[1:15:18] even when the disciples ask you how much
[1:15:20] time shall we forgive three times a day
[1:15:22] and these are troubling mathematics on
[1:15:24] them 70 times seven
[1:15:27] days for ten years is that ten years
[1:15:28] that deposit for ten years
[1:15:31] a day
[1:15:33] because god has forgiven us
[1:15:35] and god
[1:15:36] gradually forgive god
[1:15:38] thanks
[1:15:39] man
[1:15:40] and god have a friend in his face
[1:15:43] i know you're gonna do it again you know
[1:15:45] no
[1:15:47] that's why he could afford to put your
[1:15:48] name on the lam's book of life and
[1:15:50] forget about it
[1:15:51] you're born yet
[1:15:53] think about it you're even born yet and
[1:15:55] you put your name in the landscape of
[1:15:56] life
[1:15:58] and you're being when you're born you're
[1:15:59] born in sin i can say last last thing i
[1:16:02] talk about in friday emily babies
[1:16:04] recognize something amazing
[1:16:11] all right so
[1:16:14] we are not now saved in that sense
[1:16:16] he chose us before the foundation
[1:16:19] and the least we could give back to him
[1:16:22] is a quality of gratefulness let me see
[1:16:24] if i could wrap up here
[1:16:25] i wouldn't go on and on let me take a
[1:16:28] wrap up here like
[1:16:30] all right
[1:16:32] so let's go over this again here this
[1:16:34] little part here
[1:16:38] all right
[1:16:44] so jude
[1:16:47] one
[1:16:48] build yourself up
[1:16:50] in the most holy fate
[1:16:52] to praying in the holy ghost
[1:16:55] three keep yourself in the love of god
[1:16:58] and have some have compassion
[1:17:00] making a difference
[1:17:01] and this part
[1:17:03] i want you to look closer despite
[1:17:06] verse 23
[1:17:09] of some of compassion there's 22
[1:17:12] but verse 22 says and others
[1:17:16] saved
[1:17:18] with fear
[1:17:20] pulling them out of the fire
[1:17:22] hating even the garments spotted by the
[1:17:24] floor
[1:17:25] and it is one thing that i see things
[1:17:28] is how we have to be able to encourage
[1:17:31] one another because this is what i'm
[1:17:33] seeing here
[1:17:34] real genuine encouragement
[1:17:37] for one another
[1:17:38] when you hit number 23 on others
[1:17:41] this is beyond you
[1:17:42] know reaching out to others
[1:17:46] others who don't understand it's so easy
[1:17:49] to hold something against someone and
[1:17:51] you see me preach drop your words
[1:17:55] yes they did it
[1:17:56] yes they were rude yes they were even
[1:17:59] disrespectful
[1:18:00] yes but don't hold us against them they
[1:18:02] have their own problems already
[1:18:05] pray for them
[1:18:07] pull them out of the fire
[1:18:09] we have to be able to hate the sin and
[1:18:12] love this sinner
[1:18:13] we have to be able to separate and make
[1:18:15] a difference with what people do from
[1:18:17] who they really are
[1:18:20] because why we were sinners god died for
[1:18:22] us and god saved us god brought us up he
[1:18:25] didn't say when you get clean up then i
[1:18:26] will save you he saved you then he got
[1:18:28] cleaned up
[1:18:30] he invited you to come just as you are
[1:18:32] we are about to wrap up here
[1:18:40] i have some of compassion
[1:18:42] making a difference between who are weak
[1:18:45] and ignorant
[1:18:47] and those who are natural rude beasts
[1:18:51] in other words
[1:18:52] have discernment
[1:18:54] to see the difference between those who
[1:18:56] are proud and arrogant and unwilling
[1:19:00] to obey the truth
[1:19:03] the objective
[1:19:05] is not to run people out the objective
[1:19:09] really
[1:19:10] is to restore them
[1:19:12] to fellowship
[1:19:14] the attitude is one of grace and mercy
[1:19:16] remember
[1:19:17] some seniors years ago had a problem
[1:19:19] with me and how i manage young people
[1:19:22] they find i was too lenient
[1:19:25] they find uh they wanted a heavy hand
[1:19:28] because they came from a heavy
[1:19:29] legalistic background and they want a
[1:19:31] big stick come down to beat the people
[1:19:33] up
[1:19:33] whatever pastors do lots of time keep
[1:19:36] them in check
[1:19:38] and they both european they beat them
[1:19:40] here and beat them here and everybody
[1:19:41] yes two i turn on left unit
[1:19:45] and i
[1:19:46] saw some of these young people
[1:19:48] unsaved
[1:19:50] they don't know the lord
[1:19:52] many of them didn't even know the word
[1:19:55] struggling
[1:19:56] and sometimes yes
[1:19:58] we could take a big stick and beat and
[1:20:00] then you beat him out of church and then
[1:20:01] you have a prayer request would you pray
[1:20:03] for my son because you failed for my
[1:20:05] daughter
[1:20:07] and what we can do really is the prayer
[1:20:09] that they get revelation
[1:20:11] because a lot of things that young
[1:20:12] people are struggling with the one
[1:20:14] uncomfortable pill of fire one encounter
[1:20:17] with god twin country with god all that
[1:20:18] gonion
[1:20:21] all that gone you know i can't oh god i
[1:20:24] gotta tell my mindset god is sin he's
[1:20:26] still in me
[1:20:28] he can't stop sinning
[1:20:31] you yeah encounter fire
[1:20:33] you never come into presence of god
[1:20:35] where you
[1:20:36] fall as one dead
[1:20:38] it changes you
[1:20:40] coming into presence
[1:20:42] let me see if i could just close off
[1:20:44] here my god's grace
[1:20:48] but lebron
[1:20:51] you speak about faith is based upon
[1:20:53] forgiveness
[1:20:56] this
[1:20:56] this is glorious tonight i could show it
[1:20:58] right here faith
[1:21:02] is based upon
[1:21:04] forgiveness
[1:21:06] so jude
[1:21:09] is a book that is correctly placed
[1:21:12] it is placed correctly in the canon of
[1:21:14] scriptures
[1:21:16] because this book
[1:21:18] is what is a touchstone of this thing
[1:21:21] called forgiveness because what we want
[1:21:22] to turn back to is faith
[1:21:25] but what is faith based on
[1:21:28] no we've been creating business here and
[1:21:29] here in the word of god but faith is
[1:21:31] based on forgiveness
[1:21:34] and when jesus was given
[1:21:36] his word and said mach 11
[1:21:38] he said when you stand praying
[1:21:40] and so like that forgive you for your
[1:21:42] ought against any and then then he end
[1:21:45] up now if you shall know he's happy to
[1:21:47] pull first if you shall see to this
[1:21:48] monkey be moved and don't doubt what
[1:21:50] you're saying when you pray believe you
[1:21:52] have received you shall receive he's
[1:21:54] drilling down he's drilling up and when
[1:21:55] you stand praying forgive why would he
[1:21:58] say that
[1:22:00] he's not drunk conspiring
[1:22:02] he's not sinners praying
[1:22:04] is the believers he's trying to get to
[1:22:06] it is this like what he's talking about
[1:22:07] he said okay here's his book speak to
[1:22:09] him
[1:22:10] here's the second pull when you believe
[1:22:12] when you pray believe you have received
[1:22:14] and you will receive and always believe
[1:22:15] you receive it before you get it and you
[1:22:17] will get it
[1:22:18] but but
[1:22:19] when you contemplate
[1:22:21] if you have a vote against your husband
[1:22:23] your wife your children your boss your
[1:22:24] family your neighbor whoever it is drop
[1:22:26] it
[1:22:28] and your father could hear you
[1:22:30] so then when you drop it
[1:22:32] when you could express this forgiveness
[1:22:35] all of a sudden your feet
[1:22:37] that was done here goes straighter
[1:22:40] and you begin to get your prayer
[1:22:42] answered and you begin to get access to
[1:22:45] god access in a way that you did not
[1:22:47] have before
[1:22:49] this is what this is about
[1:22:51] building yourself up
[1:22:52] growing
[1:22:54] striving
[1:22:55] oh blessed be the name of your lord i
[1:22:57] think we are done tonight
[1:22:59] and then jude cruz okay one more
[1:23:02] and jesus said if you do not forgive
[1:23:04] neither will your father should forgive
[1:23:05] you
[1:23:07] and then he said rapture and faith
[1:23:10] will only be revealed
[1:23:13] to those who forgive their brothers
[1:23:16] that's a bomb i don't know if people
[1:23:17] even know this exists
[1:23:19] this is for man
[1:23:21] i believe on
[1:23:22] uh west palm beach farm 1953
[1:23:26] rapture and fate will only be revealed
[1:23:29] to those who forgive their brothers
[1:23:30] teaching on moses
[1:23:32] if we have one ought against us
[1:23:35] on squander we stand in damnation
[1:23:37] of hell's fire
[1:23:39] verse 24 and 25 and we close to the two
[1:23:41] last portion of scripture no one to him
[1:23:44] this is jude now given god praise and
[1:23:46] worship unto him he came back to god
[1:23:48] here
[1:23:49] under him that is able to keep you from
[1:23:50] falling
[1:23:51] and to present you fullness
[1:23:54] before the presence of his glory with
[1:23:56] exceeding joy
[1:23:58] to the only ones god our savior be glory
[1:24:02] and majesty
[1:24:04] dominion and power
[1:24:05] now for now
[1:24:07] and ever
[1:24:08] amen
[1:24:10] and i say amen tonight
[1:24:12] god bless you thank you so much
[1:24:14] i wanted to share this book of jude with
[1:24:17] you
[1:24:17] and i trust it was helpful i trust it
[1:24:20] was a defined
[1:24:21] i trust that you would
[1:24:23] uh come down to the point where you
[1:24:24] could see
[1:24:26] you as those seeds that judah's talking
[1:24:28] about hear what
[1:24:30] they're fighting their fate
[1:24:32] guys slipping and twisting are shake
[1:24:34] believers and people the wrong way
[1:24:37] a lot of people in problems no mind
[1:24:39] battles and confusion

[1:24:43] the most holy feet in other words i want
[1:24:45] you to act your feet with you and devote
[1:24:47] your knowledge to knowledge temperance

[1:25:04] be here
[1:25:05] it is such an exciting time to
[1:25:08] go into the scriptures
[1:25:09] and look again at what you said in your
[1:25:12] word
[1:25:13] william branham your prophet and servant
[1:25:15] didn't come and bring a new message lord
[1:25:18] he came
[1:25:20] to reveal what was already written
[1:25:22] further
[1:25:23] the scriptures
[1:25:25] it can't be something outside of the
[1:25:26] word it has to be something hid
[1:25:29] in the word
[1:25:31] and lord here it is jew tonight
[1:25:34] a very important book
[1:25:36] it connects with the message we are
[1:25:38] it connects with our heart being turned
[1:25:40] back to the face of the fathers
[1:25:42] it connects from the bottom to the top
[1:25:45] from faith straight up to bravely
[1:25:47] kindness
[1:25:48] because we know lord
[1:25:50] that once
[1:25:51] we hit that seventh step by revelation
[1:25:55] and manifestation
[1:25:57] we are ready
[1:25:58] for place in christ for you said in your
[1:26:00] word lord when the church finds his
[1:26:02] broadly love
[1:26:03] but the church finds his holy decency
[1:26:06] when the church finds its place in
[1:26:08] christ it will call to the other members
[1:26:09] of the body
[1:26:10] come and rejoice with us lord i feel
[1:26:12] your presence tonight and i pray and
[1:26:14] trust that all the believers connected
[1:26:16] and those who would hear it would feel
[1:26:17] your presence
[1:26:18] from your word lord
[1:26:20] god is not my presence is your presence
[1:26:22] we are thank you we are grateful father
[1:26:25] may they catch my revelation that this
[1:26:27] book
[1:26:28] was addressed to those who are called
[1:26:31] those that are sanctified
[1:26:33] and those that are preserved
[1:26:35] if there's anyone listening who are not
[1:26:37] sanctified it's not sanctified father
[1:26:38] may you
[1:26:39] give them the desire
[1:26:41] to be truly
[1:26:43] sanctified may the seraphs take the
[1:26:45] cause of the altar
[1:26:47] touch them even now
[1:26:48] your presence
[1:26:50] come upon them even now
[1:26:52] i mean the old leaves fall off
[1:26:54] the old ways fall off
[1:26:56] the old attitudes fall off
[1:26:59] there are people we have seen them lord
[1:27:01] just get old
[1:27:02] they have not grown they have not
[1:27:04] changed
[1:27:05] they have just
[1:27:06] aged away just as they always was
[1:27:10] and we feel sorry for them because
[1:27:12] we see a lack of revelation
[1:27:14] but i pray tonight something's still in
[1:27:16] their spirit and stood in their hearts
[1:27:18] is not how we start
[1:27:20] god
[1:27:21] is how we finish
[1:27:23] a lot of people go back
[1:27:25] and they have regrets
[1:27:27] they didn't start at this time they wish
[1:27:28] it was early dude whatever it is doesn't
[1:27:30] matter how
[1:27:32] we start
[1:27:34] the question is
[1:27:36] how are we gonna finish because many
[1:27:37] start
[1:27:39] but a bunch that gonna finish
[1:27:41] will be the bunch of overcomers how'd i
[1:27:43] pray tonight the doors under the song of
[1:27:45] my voice come true in overcoming lord
[1:27:47] overcoming themselves overcoming their
[1:27:50] fears overcoming their paths
[1:27:52] and they enter into the love of god
[1:27:55] father may there be a greater love for
[1:27:57] one another a greater love for your
[1:27:58] people and lord that word
