challenge the enemy in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ tonight that Lord the battle is the Lord's and the battle is already won Farah we stand believing with brother Terrence tonight that he's already healed Lord and Lord we're looking for the manifestation of that healing granted to us tonight father in Jesus Christ precious name we ask this amen any men may be seated praise God we're overt whistle amen well last week we spoke about the adoption of sons how that we were born first into the kingdom of God born by the baptism of the Holy Spirit we become a child of God but then we have to go on to be trained child trained and then adopted and placed into the body of Christ to really work for the Lord wanna go back on one or two records we read last week and some I couldn't I didn't have my glasses to see and I couldn't read please God from the adoption around says but now to please how are you you are first born into the kingdom by the Holy Ghost how many knows that all right the next you are predestinated unto the what adoption what is that you are predestinated unto the place in his Holy Spirit is here His Holy Spirit is here and he's trying to place his church to get his church in order place it in the promised land so they can enter so that all the enemies can be drove out no we know that when God made man he gave him dominion over the earth no that was God's plan that God Himself the Spirit of God would live in man it was the spirit aboard in Adam leading him and wherever I'm said Adam had dominion over nature he could change the course of the river by speaking it and era was to speak the Word of God and bring forth the other sons but we know that they fell and man came the way of the animals we were born like an animal just how animals born there but that wasn't the original plan however God wasn't it all he made he designed things in a way that that would happen didn't you wrong man but he allowed man to fall that he could be a savior sure his graced a man to his favorite a man so his healing a man to his powers a man reveal himself to man so what was in it all it's not that he'd ever pull one on God and God had to come fight him back amen it was foreknown and pre-planned that it would be this way no man had dominion over the earth now when when he lost that Dominion the enemy moved in no we know the enemy is a spirit and we know there was a rebellion in heaven and a certain amount of spirits I think one-third of all the spirits followed the enemy aboard at least well this guy who rose up with Lucifer and he was cast out from the high heavens and no easy princely power that he is still controlled certain things he controls the things that Adam should have been controlling so the devil infest nature infest the world usually have storms and all these things of nature acting contrary wild animals destroying even man probably the worst are the animals right now but that was not how it's supposed to be so God had planned that you going to bring back man from that condition even better BAM spoke about the poverty a man who is so depraved is a man with - a child out of a mother handle rubbish does the extent that man reached for from being a son of God to be a child a devil but God he proposed that he would bring back man Oh spirits fallen spirits demonic spirits followers of Lucifer they actually control the earth at this time then they control it but it's man was supposed to control it so God had to bring back man into the position so he has to take but all the powers that the devil has and give it back to his sons no we know that we're in no condition really to receive these powers as yet so we have to be trained we have to be brought up in the things of God we have to be educated in the things of God and not just educated by mental ly you know finding out these things did you would have knowing you could know the Bible from cover to cover and yet they not will be talking about that know what God is talking about either so there is a training has to be done the Spirit Himself has to do the training so God has to boot you in as a child you come out in front in God and then you have to be trained you have to be tutored by the spirit autism by the spirit so and then but when you look at it it has to come back to a place where we actually have to take all over all that Satan is doing know all the things he that is to it all you control he has over knit and everything man I think about that so that is more than coming to church you wanna Sandra said not because we come the church or we come regularly you understand I mean that is being a good Christian you know but we come the church then to be taught the word to receive the word and then to be tested on the word now everyone who is going back to that original position will be tested we gonna be tested and be testing it not gonna be in here I mean I've already stand here and say dog a fight with me because I thought if you come here take a fight with people of Israel of being zero but the fight is against the enemy no Satan knows the planner border and he knows it more than us and he's gonna fight he's not gonna give up his position he has a chiral atom he can atom inheritance in that sense illegally but he has it and we gotta take it back so we had a between spirit in spiritual things we are to be taught we are we oughtta have sickness come upon us and overcome the sickness we have to have trials come upon us and overcome the trials though sometimes you get sick and you forgot well boy thing going wrong it not so much acting going wrong you know is training is testings it's trials that will put upon you that you could learn the ways of God and to overcome it because there is something in you there's something in his son of God and that could overcome these things [Applause] jealousy don't fear those ferry one who could who could kill your body then but ferry one who could cast you into hell naughty one who going to catch you in the hell you know hell was created to cast the devil in but all who follow the devil will end up here too so in that's Newton who came you know to hell as you know you have a picture to the ages of devils like as if devil is a king I he'll say then let it kill my hero so I guess silence say that another King I had you know the present as ever the kingdom of Satan fighting the kingdom of God and say tell the king a hell and God is he King I haven't say that hell was created to destroy the devil to lock him up to bind him to destroy him that you will be no more and if you follow well you know mean who follow will end up there too well you got to say well Cora did never fight even the Bible said God casts out Devils with the little finger that Cora did ever fight him is you and it ever fightin is your inheritance you're trying to get back what straining you to beat the devil so you know last value a plane last week you know it was coming the main prayer that we have to learn to wait on the Lord and the Wheaton on the Lord we can't wait frustrated we are to wait with patience we have to wait in faith because all that God's all right city is what God promises and God can lay what promise you that when you cross the river you'll enter a place where there will be no pain no sickness no sorrow no death no end of life you know viselli a tequila see or know how many people really believe that boy it song like a lil times the storia note that no sorrow no pain but this is the promise of God if you could receive it if you could believe all of that so I was ending with you know we supposed to wait wait and pray wait on the Lord the Bible said in a tweet we will mount up with wings as I eagerly they will run they won't be very they'll walk and they won't fit so I'll say you know you know like like you know we hear about guys going on a hunt and your fellows will be less careful and climb up on their I did we did whole night for some animal to come by those who some time and the I did like where abarim even talk about him he was hunting some lion or something and you were tracking it and land was going and he was behind and your truck anything so these hunters fella they actually enjoyed the tracking and all you know they enjoyed each ear said oh so we're going after something I've got some time holding it back hauling it back from you pulling it back and it's a senior and you had you if you any wrong speed you get was treated but we not supposed to be waited on the Lord in frustration you supposed to be waited in faith you supposed to be waiting with joy and another thing that was coming to me to any permit in there is that we're not supposed to be looking back the chicory devil is a get us to look back what no neither all chick everybody here must he get trickled out already you make mistake you fall and he come in and showing your dad and he brilliant that in front of your face but once you confess your sins to board your forgive mind blood wash so you're looking forward so I get to see something I see you know is to be looking forward forward forward forgetting the thing that is in the past there because I like to carry devil he's come on whisper and tell your thing and show your thing is so is his job to do that we had a learn to beat him there was a there was a quote ever Balaam said we said we were born we born we born we say hallelujah praise the Lord glory say but we can whip the Philistines so we had to be trained we have to be following following following training taking the train and everyday is training you know when you leave here you leave here and you put on our next mindset but I do wrong things you know you got is leading all the way got training you everything that happened to you koala low it every single thing that happened to you got a low that if he didn't want you to go to that you would have stopped it because the Bible says for every temptation he has already provided a way of asking he meant everything there's a way out but if we keep our mind on Bob you'll see how they all did it up like Bobby let's say so now when you get in a situation you see what you want the whole boat get about it this one no he no volume came out anti-cheating some time you say you know you could lose the vagina you can lose the vision you go to work and you put on I would mine when you come to church sits back touch its main but no it's good all the way God is the one that is leading so do you think about it is that what was seen it is more than committed chills regularly and dressing regularly and being a large part of it be nice and being kind by bamse well a good citizen will do all of that too but we have to be born of the Spirit and then we have to take the training we have to grow up in God we have to mature in God sees note as we were hearing place in the body that we could drive out both Philistine because mode if Philistines occupy a lot of areas they control the earth and we ought to take it back really take it but this is as far as it goes and we had to go and take it back so it's more than you know being a good boy and a good girl and committed to to regularly ending but then you come into here you would you come into here you would because faith comes by hearing so you have to hear the wood and as we see anybody since Sunday you know something you might want us to my play a tape and set up come in but Julie is you gotta realize that plane at a home up in a tip-in city to the venting I knew that from years know when you play a tape in the church is that different in your game or date and if you see know who myself am plate and is it truth babbles in forsake not the assembling air is a purpose in the world oh we talk about
