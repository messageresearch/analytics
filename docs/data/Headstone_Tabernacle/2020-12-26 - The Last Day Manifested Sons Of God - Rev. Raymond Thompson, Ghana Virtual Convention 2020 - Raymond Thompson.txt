to the end of these services god will get all the glory and there'll be signs wonders and miracles and testimonies that god has changed their lives and heal the lord especially in this this time that we're living in we see the world falling apart but lord right when it's falling apart god you bring in your pride together lord for a great manifestation of the power of god so we pray lord help us to be in the right condition the right channel in the right inspiration at the time of god so may you lift us up this morning may you bless whatever will be said lord and when we come to the end of the service we won't forget to give you all the honor the praise and the glory for we ask it in the name of the lord jesus christ and the church i'll say the church shall say amen if you have your bibles galatians chapter 4 ephesians 1 and romans 8. now i want to say this that the inspiration our brother's inspiration is the manifestation of the sons of god and adoption so if the same scriptures are read and if the same quotes are quote remember then the holy spirit is wanting to emphasize something so i don't know what any other minister's reading what scripture is using but god knows amen so if it is like that remember that god has a purpose is emphasizing something amen galatians chapter four and we read from verse four to seven if you have it say amen but when the fullness of the time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because he are sons goddess send forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying our father and abba means my father so you can say my father wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an air of god through christ isn't that beautiful so just go one page over and you get ephesians one my this is my favorite scripture from verse 4 if you have it there according that he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace where in the earth made us accept it in the beloved age the devil hates the scripture man in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he have abounded to toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself my let's get on that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather watch together in in one all things and in in wizard in christ both which are in heaven and which on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will mind in romans chapter 8 from verse 19. for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of god for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who had subjected the same in hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god for we know that the whole creation growneth and prevaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirits even ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body may the lord the blessing to the reading of his glorious word you may be seated so uh we greet we greet you once again in the precious name of jesus christ it's a mighty name it's a name that make demons tremble and i know today devils are going to tremble they are shaking brother because scriptures like that put him out he's got no place there because god has already predestinated you and uh called you to adoption hallelujah amen so uh we just wanna uh i'm gonna have to fire quick this is almost a two-hour message and it's five past eleven so we're gonna stay on fire okay we're gonna stay on fire amen i said i'm not going after no one i'm just gonna preach and you're gonna preach back amen so i got a title this morning the last day manifested sons of god so we've had sons all through the ages but there's something special about the last day sons because they must bring redemption oh hallelujah to all nature and even to ourselves then my subject the dispensation of adoption which is now and then my inspiration the time for the sons of god to be manifested it's got to come to pass do you believe that do you believe you part of that amen it's okay i'm gonna fire straight from adam so we go all the way to eden amen and we see man was made a secondary god on earth he was given all power to control all the elements of the earth he gave him jurisdiction over everything he controlled the animal life he controlled the fish life he controlled the winds he controlled the plant life he could speak to it to the tree and say be planted over there and the tree will uproot itself and plant it over on the other side it will obey him why he was a son of god hallelujah he could direct and flow if the river was flown in his direction he could he could redirect that river by the word and say river flow that way towards the right and the river will open and flow towards the right why he was a son of god and when god made adam he made him superior to anything that was on earth he was superior to all the animals to all the plant life to everything that was on the earth he was superior hallelujah he was in control and brother brahm says he was a minor god under god so the human being was made to be a god a minor god under god now brother that's your original position that's what you were supposed to be and we are coming back to that brother hallelujah yeah complete supreme control a minor god under god god was the god of the universe but adam was the god of the earth and all nature obeyed him hallelujah but then something went wrong and adam all of a sudden because son came into the garden he became unconscious something happened he became unconscious of who he was because sin came into the garden and he lost consciousness that he was the son of god and all the channels that god would drop into him it all got clogged up and god could not reach him it got clogged up and all of a sudden adam couldn't understand the animals wouldn't come to him they rather ran away when he called the lion the lion ran away all of a sudden there was a growl something had gone wrong in eden what has happened brother something the son of god had fallen from his estate and all of a sudden now he had no more control of the earth oh hallelujah and brother brahm says here in the fundamental foundation of faith that in the beginning of man that that what god gave him power over everything on earth now through the fall he lost that power and he become unconscious of the fact after losing his relationship and friendship and fellowship with the father then he lost that and all of his great channels became clogged up and he couldn't get through and adam couldn't understand what went wrong he can't get through anymore he would call to them and they'll run away his channels got clogged up friends there was no more inspiration he couldn't hear from god no more hallelujah all of a sudden he realized something had happened in the unquote promises and adam fell he lost his sonship his inheritance his life his sonship his jurisdiction over the earth with with with these fall the earth fell [Music] now watch this and the earth fell so when god came and he says why are you naked god came looking for adam now i want you to listen to this when adam fell his son god didn't send an angel to go look for him god himself came down to look for his son that had fallen brother sister that's the god we serve man that every son and daughter that makes a mistake and fall don't you worry he comes himself to look for you brother sister [Applause] my and then brother prime says and in the scriptures in genesis god begin to curse he cursed eve he cursed the serpent but when he came to adam adam was his son brother he couldn't curse his son this was his son how could he curse his what father good was his son but the bible says instead of cursing adam he cursed the earth come on brother sister i don't care what the devil does you are his son you are his daughter you might have fallen you might have made a mistake but god who cannot curse you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] he cursed the earth and not his son god cursed the earth and the earth brought forth thorns and thistles the bible says he didn't do that before and and the book of life went back to the hands of the original owner and satan tried to get his grishy hands on it but he couldn't get in other words the title did the authority that adam had that went back to god satan tried to get that if he got that brother he would have done much damage but it went back to the original owner oh hallelujah that's why in revelations chapter 10 there comes down a mighty angel with a with a book in his hand that's the same book that went back to attitude to the original owner come on sons of god the sons of god are coming back brother hallelujah that that is why nature is groaning waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god and adam the bible says he had an adoption for he gave him dominion over all things but he lost his guardship he lost his sonship he lost his domain and satan took it over it becomes and it became satan's eden it was no more god's eating how he became satan's edener hallelujah and god and satan had adam's race pinned in the corner because adam failed and man lost his dominion and power over the earth hallelujah hallelujah but listen up brother things begin to change you know there's adam's responding a corner satan has got him hallelujah there's no way they can turn to but all of a sudden he says here who is god what adam lost in the fall christ restored in his death hallelujah brother did you hear that what adam lost in the fall christ came and restored in his death hallelujah to bring man back into fellowship with god and the church has moved up to that fellowship with god commune like adam had in the beginning in the garden of eden taking all sun away free from condemnation the holy spirit clenching us from all sin now you free to exercise the next step come on now now you can say i'm a sunnah i can exercise the next step i can speak the word i can claim a healing now because he died at calvary he brought sons back into fellowship back into communion you can speak with god hallelujah he says here now what adam was in god christ has redeemed us back to that now a redeemer is to redeem anything is to bring it back to the original again hallelujah so you are brought back to that original again hallelujah now he says in abraham and he said after him the second adam proved it amen when he stopped nature and he said peace be still now here we see something happening here comes a man on the scene he's acting like the first one acted and the winds and the waves are playing but blowing and all of a sudden he stands up and he says listen peace be still and the wishing uh ceased and the winds went down why he was demonstrating what the first adam demonstrated oh hallelujah he come to the victory and he looks for figs and there's no figs and he curses the victory certainly he was a man yet he was god come on people if that don't excite you this jesus we serve is not just a man he is god brother come on man your jesus is not just a man and the bible says all things will be gathered in christ and christ is god so we'll be gathered in god in christ not in a church not in a denomination not in a group brother but we'll be gathered in christ hallelujah so he goes the first victory and was a man yet he was god he was a manifested son of god that's what we listen these next words brother branham say now that's what we to be one of these days yeah the prophet prophesying this was in 1961 he said showing he was a manifested son of god he says the second adam showing and demonstrated and he says he was men he was a manifested son of god that's not the next word that's what we need to be one of these days like answer still when i hear something like that brother i can't sit there you mean i'm gonna be a manifesto yes thus say the prophet one of these days that's coming back again [Applause] hold on my brother hold on my sister keep pressing keep going you're gonna be a manifested son of god hallelujah my he says oh god christ came down through fallen god knowing in the beginning who would be saved and who would not therefore he came down and pursued the enemy right through life through death through paradise into hell and then all the way up again from glory to hell took over the powers of hell and the keys away from the devil and rose again and restored mankind to that he can be sons and daughters of god again you better listen to me this morning don't listen to the devil we listen to our doctor we listen to our boss we listen to our teacher you better listen to god to restore us what back to sons and daughters of god now we are the sons of god not we will be now man so put back your shoulders lift up your head walk like a son of god walk like a daughter of god brother show the devil i'm not afraid i'm no longer slave i used to be a slave but i'm no longer a slave i'm a son of god now i'm living for god i gave my life to jesus hallelujah my let's give him praise man there's no god like our god there's no savior like our savior and he took the keys remember he got the keys but he gave the keys to someone you're going to find out hallelujah it was god above us in the pull of fire it was god with us when christ was here now it is god in us the son of god became the son of man so that the sons of man could become the sons of god hallelujah can i read that again the son of god became the son of man so that the sons of man could become the son of god hallelujah listen brother he prepares you to manifest you come on out do you hear what i say he prepares you to do what to manifest you so what you're going through don't say oh god me again now he's preparing you to manifest you brother so what you going through your trial through your tests he's preparing you to manifest you christ came and redeemed adam's fallen race who was lost that's why nature's grown and waited for the manifestation of the sons of god to come and take it back the scriptures say they're waiting for the sons of god to come and take it back nature's groaning you just need to read the news brother california is burning up and the other state it's it's water they're drowning floods you need to just look at the feminists in the other the whole earth is groaning in birth pains what are they waiting for the manifestation for the last day sons to come to manifestation brother and to take it back again and we will reign on earth the earth was made for the sons of god brother we're not supposed to reign in heaven that's god's domain that's why we come in back even the souls under the altar of christ how long lord how long when are we coming back to earth we're gonna reign on the earth [Applause] my there was a dispensation of the mosaic law there was a dispensation of john the baptist there was a dispensation of christ there was a dispensation of the church organization there was a dispensation of the outpouring of the holy

father's business and now the father said hey it's time to adopt him and now he says i'm sitting back i'm giving him the authority bru luke his name on the check hallelujah whatever he fires he's fired whoever he hires is hired so here he him now remember you must remember the quotes we read this is what is going to do to the sons of god that's coming very soon now brother says here god placed on him the robe of immortality so in the earth he had received him that's the thing that god will do to his sons here on earth someday he will call you a side church if you'll only obey him stay on

special man she belongs to jesus christ hallelujah and the same sign same power same one the same anointing same healing same deliverances all the powers that was in christ will be in you god will call you a side church and he will adopt you in other words he'll call you aside you'll be in your secret closet and you'll be praying and all of a sudden there's a ball of light on the floor and you look and all of a sudden you step the angel and he says fear not i'm sent from the presence of god to tell you that god has accepted your faith and you are called to pray for the sick you are called to lay hands on the sick and give you a gift brother then there's no more preaching you don't have to hear from me god will be speaking with you god will be dealing with you dealing with you with you with you with you you call your side and he'll adopt you [Applause] now listen if you he says there's a thing that can happen that he can't please you know you must listen to this now he says here in uh uh pleasure he says here no sir your ups and your downs and your engine your outs things like that god can't place you as the sun [Music] now i'm just dropping in this i don't want to keep it negative but don't keep it positive but you see your ins and outs in your ups and your downs then you're in this church and in their church then you up then you down he says god cannot place you you must be about the father's business every day you wake up lord what is your prisoners for today i must vindicate malachi 4. i must verdict luke 17 30. i must vindicate those seven funders of revelation stain i must vindicate it i must be above the father's business wherever you go you speak about it you talk about it you witness about it brother doesn't care you meet someone in the gym you speak with him you meet someone and have a job you're above the father's business you tell him do you know god sent a prophet he fulfills malachi 4 evil false luke 17 30 what are you about the father's business hallelujah men are my faith muscles are getting stronger hallelujah he says but when you stay in the kingdom stay in the gospel stay right one stay right one with these one of these days god will call you out and set you aside and adopt you as his son before the people and give you something that will shake the nations with it see what i mean it's the adoption into the family so he'll give you something that will shake the nations in other words i don't have to manufacture brahmas i don't have to manufacture anything that i got a gift and then i'm gonna no that gift once i'm adopted will speak for itself he says it will shake the nations everyone will wonder what's happening hey something happened in el dorado something happened in ghana something happened in trinidad something happened in nigeria what he's adopted his pride and the whole world is shaking brother under the impact of the holy spirit my adoption three placing positionally where they are at show me where they're at i remember when i read this in lightroom brother cosmos answered show me where that he says here we are so i want to say answer today here they are here they are they be gathered all over in ghana trinidad all over in nigeria in usa they'll be there brother show me where they're at god calling the children aside by manifestation they don't have to say one word about it here's it you see something's happened positionally placing his son getting him in order just exactly with the same things he's just as much in authority his word is just as good as an archangel he says even better hey people do you realize who you are your word is even better than an archangel before the throne of god hear what he say oh my in kinsman redeemer now my sons and daughters and our sons and daughters who has who has most power before god what is in an angel an angel is a servant is that right they servants what are you his sons and daughters who has most power in heaven than a sinner that has been saved by grace or an archangel that's standing before his right side who has more power a sinister by grace or an archangel [Applause] in heaven or a sinister by as soon as christ by grace you start calling on the name of jesus and watch how god begins to move brother you start calling on that name and not even the archangel can move him but when he sees the sun go on his knees and he begins to pray that moves the heart of god why brother you have more authority you have more power you have more authority you're more anointing can the archangel in heaven you have more authority brother hallelujah take that satan this people has got more authority [Applause] a sinner that's been saved by grace as more authority in heaven than the archangel that stood by sight without sin because he's a son son is more authority than the seventh my hallelujah now listen to this quote fellowship by redemption he says a man has a soul not a striking even a sinner one man says you know what that sin affair but god never took his image out of him can you imagine because that man is still a creator now let me read the quote and therefore the soul is a part of god and even in his fallen state yet it's the most greatest species of all species of the earth is man so that man in his fallen state is still the greatest specie that man is a sinner and he can bend this thing let it crush he can look at the glass and burst it just with a with his intellectual powers but he's a sinner you know why it's because god's image is so god didn't take that away from me all he took away was his authority but he left his images that's why satan is always not sure he always questions your identity what's that when christ was hanging on are you the son of god when he tempted him in the desert if you the son of god you can turn these stones you see he questions your identity he's not sure but i want to make you give you double assurance you are a son of god that's been restored brother and when you restored you have double power you have a double portion [Applause] listen he says now that man that's fallen is the highest species on earth and then get him in connection with his maker he becomes a superman oh my goodness oh i feel like running through the building elijah listen man get him in connection with his maker he becomes a superman almost because he's a son of god becomes acquainted with his maker and with the creator of all things then when that man there is acquainted with his maker he becomes a part with his maker he comes back in fellowship with his maker every divine divine word becomes a living reality to him and he believes it so brother when you get that sinner back in restoration with his maker that man becomes a superman and yeah you're ready to give up for what brother just get into get connected with your maker you become a superwoman you become a superman you become someone that's connected with his maker now the maker the creator and and the soil creation is now one brother what devil is gonna stop you what demon is gonna come against what man can come against you you restored back [Applause] creation and creator is connected together again brother that's a son of god a manifested son of god [Applause] my please stay with me now i'm coming to something very striking and this is in the fission church age now this is just before christ came on the scene god's intention please listen god's intention for his creation man is to express his words in genesis adam was given the word to live by a life loved by the word would be the word expressed that is true is it not but did adam live by the word no because he he was to live by every word and he failed to take heed to every word then there rose moses what the great and mighty man of god he was yet he was yet he also failed to live by every word and that prophet a type of the great prophet to come failed in anger to obey the word then there was also david the great king of israel a man after god's own heart he fell by adultery when he was tempted so this is now god is working to his plan he wants to come to that perfect masterpiece so he took every man he saw adam fail but he he knew he had to restore that and bring it back so through every prophet he came but they failed and then he took another one and they failed and then he takes another one and they fail and they fail but listen mother what brother man says and they say every time there's a word but it erases out all the past oh i hope you got it already but eventually in the fullness of time they came one day ahead even jesus who also must be tempted to see if he would live by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of god then when satan was foiled for he was one who lived it is written and that masterpiece god overcame by reflecting god's word then was this manifested perfect one given the cross as the perfect lamb of god for the perfect sacrifice on the tree he received the wounds of death that we by him because of him might eat of the tree of life adam eight of what of the tree of knowledge the second adam brings us oh brother come on man so we can eat what of the tree of life oh and then the life freely given will enable us to overcome and express the word of god again oh brother so don't tell me listen moses had his part david had his spot assaila had his part but but but eventually there came one man and his name was jesus he was the word he loved the word he fulfilled the word hallelujah he died on calvary so that you and i might go free and we can live from the tree of life you're not living off a man you living of the tree of life [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] now you must listen to me i wanted to put it on a screen but it was a bit too late and how many saw the the new motor car that they made with no steering wheel and they said it's already ready made just waiting for production but it's already made and many of you got it on your cell phones seen this driveless car no press no driver no stain wheel nothing right now listen to this they say it's called a prototype an original model what is a prototype is an original model on which something is patent image of the prototype now for an image to be produced there has to be a prototype so before prosem they can manufacture it they must first have this masterpiece the prototype and it has to be tested through every test it can't fail because once you produce it it's faultless and i was in germany and brother sigma took us to the german factory where they had a massive car there no steering wheel nothing and they showed us a 10 minute video how they tested this car through they put it through the most rugged test and now they got it on display they say it's a prototype ready for manufacture because it's past every test hallelujah i i know you spiritual i know where you see i'm going so there to be a prototype so all the tests that god has done through the old testament they all failed and they all failed and they all failed and they all failed but but eventually came to a masterpiece he came to a real prototype hallelujah he came to a real prototype and his name was jesus and before they can produce it it must pass every test and he passed every test so much so he said who can accuse me of sin who can point the finger at me i pass every test brother he became the perfect masterpiece yeah what they say for an image to produce there has to be a prototype necessary this means man has to have a prototype if he or she is an image now we all want to be like jesus now that's why if you read ephesians pretty destiny to be in his image man i feel excited i know the devil is in trouble man glory be to god hallelujah [Applause] [Applause] okay one of the ones we read there he says we are we are supposed to be in the same image now any man or woman he or she is an image of what is now they say what is a prototype thing it's the original version so when god came down to christ 2nd adam the original version back on the earth so god has got now a prototype now in all the east asia it it's it's a it's original version or an example from which the subsequent images will depict so the prototype is produced first before mass production yo my god my god is smart man and you that understand mechanics and understand technical things it don't only apply to a car it can be an airplane it can be a computer it can be anything but i'm using a car today so he says now before is the original version the example of which so the subsequent images will depict so the prototype is produced first before mass production it is tested under various conditions to see how it will function when it passes then other products are produced to perform like the original oh are you ready brother sister so you mean if there's a prototype and god is going to make images then the images must act how exactly like the prototype god is not going to make a mistake he already tested the prototype he already protested the masterpiece and there was no fault hallelujah i can see the devil's running brother demons are running why the sons of god are coming back they're going to be in the same image like jesus christ they will fulfill the word of god they will deliver nature my that's why i said who of you can condemn me of sin man jesus christ the word of god that created what is our prayer is our prototype now watch where they take him they don't only take him when he was formed because he was right in the garden he's the one that said let there be oh listen when he started creation the world was formless and void but he brought order where there was darkness he brought light he demonstrated that he could speak for things to manifest thereby showing how faith operates and he also demonstrated dominion hallelujah now he has an encouragement for you i don't know if you're going to aim in this i don't know if you're going to stand up for this but listen brother don't bother about the chaos and the darkness in your life now you will dispel them hallelujah you will dispel there brother raymond i'm in darkness brother raymond i'm down but you see your type is the original type that said let there be and there was now when they were darkness and void in garden of eden he brought the eden to darkness and void and light so they encouraged man their darkness in your life you can dispel it let there be light let the darkness leave let the chaos leave there's life in you speak the word you are an image of the original come on [Music] don't bother about the chaos and darkness in your life you shall spell them [Applause] if that is how our if that is how our prototype behaved in those instances aren't we to behave the same so what are you scared of what are you scratching your head you're wondering am i going to make it am i going to be there your type your image you made in that same image of the prototype if he the spell and and behave in those instances aren't we to behave the same that is why he gave adam dominion over nature this is why it's adam that name the animals and adam exercise faith to show true likeness so adam showed true likeness so that same power is in you now now you must believe it like you believe your doctor or your teacher you must believe that this word that's been spoken is you and if there's darkness and you speak it away say darkness dispel and let there be light in my life let the chaos leave let the sun leave liver sickness leave speak the word [Applause] amen young people speak the word man i'm gonna be on fire for god satan you don't have no power over me i'm a son of god i'm walking with my head high and my shoulders back because i'm behaving like my image seat [Applause] my wow know the power of your original version in other words go from here and find out what power did my original version where do i come from why am i here you're not just here to work and buy clothes and see to the children and get married no you're not yet to occupy a seat you're here to be like your original person you have to be like jesus they must see christ in you and listen man i want to tell you something it's not even about you it's not about me it's about this man jesus this is what the world is looking for they're looking for jesus listen man we don't want to get people to the church we want to get people to jesus [Applause] hallelujah my know the power of your original version demonstrate it because we ought to do the same you're not a nobody your kind of your kind is christ and he is heavenly your kind walked on the water he calmed nature your kind multiplied fish and bread do not be deceived your kind is real and he will represent you your prototype is jesus christ so every time the enemy wanna make you force a satan i'm gonna be like my prototype he already died that i might eat of the tree of life enemies of the tree of good knowledge but the second adam brought us back to the tree of life we can live again no more slave to sinner no more slave to fear no more slave to sickness [Applause] wow i hope you caught that one oh my goodness we have a prototype brother and he was tested and without fault that's why problem says we can always point to him that's why when satan tries to accuse you christ come and he stands there in his blood he says but i died for them there's no fault in him you remember what his name brother carl always preached of the great evangelist when he got there and he thought he didn't lie and make mistakes he found what he did and just when he was waiting for condemnation who came here comes the prototype you say yes father is guilty but on earth he stood for me now i stand for him your prototype stands for you day and night brother every time the devil goes to accuse you he says not guilty not guilty the blood speaks on your behalf the blood of christ has got a voice not guilty we are predestined to be conformed to the image of christ so we want to get to jesus where he restores man back to the image of god that's why he said it's expedient watch for me to go so that my image could come back into you so that production can begin i'm just switching the words so you can get a picture he says it's expedient for me to go because i passed the test i'm the perfect masterpiece but if i stay here they can't be operation of mess they can't produce or protect more depict more of this image so it's expedient and they couldn't understand what's happening and then he said go terry in jerusalem until the factory will begin hallelujah oh brother this is gonna bless you man hallelujah never mind what's gonna happen after forget about the lunch forget who you must see you better listen to this brother you might never hear it again and he says you have the works that i do he shall do also even greater than this shall he do this is the image speaking this is a prototype and brother yeah goes the and then he was for 40 days he was with them speaking of the kingdom and the kingdom of god is coming now what will happen in the kingdom and the kingdom and he says terry in the city of jerusalem and a while and terry until and then they waited there in the upper room and brother says they were fasting and praying and they were waiting and suddenly oh yeah yeah the factory goes in operation the factory goes into operation and all of a sudden the holy ghost comes down he's the designer he's the one that designed come on brother i hope you see that he was the logos here he comes in 120 listen 120 can we say motorcars went into operation all of a sudden you had they're running around like drunk people they're running all over they screaming what is happening now god is making more images before god could do that he had to have a prototype and then he had to go send the only goes back and he has a hundred and twenty staggering under the impact of the holy spirit [Applause] oh hallelujah and they staggering like drunk people 120 images were produced went into demonstration products of the same image of the prototype and those that were around them said hey what mean is this what's going on we never saw these kind of models we never saw we know the old pharisee with this crown we know the sadducees were disturbed around color we know all about them but who's this we never seen this type of morals there's something about them and yet peter stood up hallelujah he said come on you men and brethren you pharisees and you sadducees these men are not drunk as you suppose but this is that spoken by the prophet joel that in the last days i'm going to start my manufacturing hallelujah god demonstrated and there was 120 morals [Applause] hallelujah praise god hallelujah there was 120 models and on the day of pentecost 120 images and were produced and went into demonstration products of the same image of the prototype hey you're going to like it man the sunday yeah there's more coming man very early only 12 o'clock and those are on us what mean of this peter said this is that that was spoken by the prophet joel in the last days i'll pour out my image and and after the sermon oh are you ready after the sermon was preached and if you go read the sermon and you time it that sermon was only for about four and a half minutes less than five minutes he preached and the bible says and another three thousand images was added to the 128. satan is in trouble brother after the 120 he has another 3 000 added now they don't know what to do because here they see more people acting like these people they never seen these models before they never saw this anointing before upon this people they see something is happening three thousand souls hey and they spoke in their own language but everyone rather speak in their language if you spoke stuana you heard them if you spoke zulu you heard them in zulu amen come on come on friend yes something new this image meets every condition you can't say no my condition is too bad no you make god a liar god is able to come to the lowest to the down and out and it will change your life [Applause] so besides the 120 blueberry yes now 3 000 edit oh my goodness and then the same image photo type was added to the church or to the kingdom of god now watch this now we must watch them and see how they act so peter and john went to the temple to worship and here they find a crippled man there's a gate called beautiful and they said silver and gold ever none but such as i have before that he didn't have it he was people papi before that he didn't have it but now he's got it he says servant golem but such as i have what do i have i have the image of the prototype that's in me now such as i have give i unto you in the name of jesus stand up and walk and when he held the man up the bible says life came into his ankles and he began to walk hey brother they were acting like the prototype oh hallelujah let's give jesus a hand to praise there's no god like your god there's no jesus like your jesus there's no saving like your savior there's no healer like your healer there's no deliverance like your deliverer come on satan take that man we giving you blow off the blow blow off the blower the devil has got no power over god's [Applause] children what did he have he had the image of the prototype in him and acted like the prototype that was his kind the original that that's where they came from then caiaphas and the elders wanted to know by what name was this man here hallelujah so what what peter did we didn't say you see what i did no peter points them back to the original version [Music] when you see someone point to themselves you know there's something wrong when when the pharisees are speaking by what name was this man here peter pointed back to the original version where they were born from by the name of jesus this man was made whole he said let it be known unto you all he and people of israel that by the name of jesus christ of nazareth of whom was crucified whom god raised from the dead even by him does this man stand here before you all this is the stone which was set at north of you boulders which has become the head of the corner neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby you shall be saved so that's why i say in the name of jesus receive what you come for this morning did you come for something did you come expecting something well receive it in the name of jesus christ receive what you came for oh to save time in acts chapter 5 the bible says then the people realize this people is anointed and they brought cots and they laid it in the street beds and couches and let the shadow of peter pass by them and as the shadow of peter would fall upon them they would jump over the couch they will jump off the cot what was happening exactly like the original you see brother once the original comes in there must be something happen you can't say i'm a christian you can't say god the holy ghost but there's nothing happening in your life you don't pray you don't read come on friends something must happen man they must know and see that the holy ghost the original person is in you and the bible says all men of unclean spirits then the high priest rose up all they did was with him which is the sect of the sadducees and they were filled with indignation they never saw these morals and laid their hands on the apostles put them in the common prison now watch you see once this original comes in something happens so they put them in prison because the services is upset they're shaking the regions they're shaking their churches but the angel of the lord by night opened the prison doors and brought them forth and said go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of life my so the angel comes the same night in prison lose them take them out hear what the angels say they don't say run away now to turban off the cliffs he says go right back to the temple you see what what it is brother once that is in you it makes you so bold it makes you so strong that you take on any challenge that comes away and the angel says and he says uh open the prison doors brought them forth and he said go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life then came one and told them and said behold hey this man whom you put in prison is standing in the temple and they teaching the people again come on oh hello this is the original version they back in the temple they didn't run away they say hey let's get out they went back to the temple like the angel [Applause] [Music] hallelujah okay to save time and then uh herod killed james the brother of john and the rest of them again the pharisees put them in prison and they couldn't kill them because there was a feast of unleavened bread so he said put them in prison so you know what they did they put the soldier here and a soldier next to him and peter's laying in the middle that same night the angel come he loosens the chains this is new models brother come on these are people with a prototype now these are people that's got the image the same angel come they lean between two soldiers chain will change the angel come he loosens the chains he wakes him up and as they walk in out of the door the doors just open and they come to the next door the next door open brother brahm says you think these modern buildings with the doors just open it get it he says no the bible headed first the doors just open as they walk this is the image you have in you man prison doors will open the chains will fall off feathers will break brother sickness will leave brother demon power that all you get must go [Applause] and right at that time they were they were praying for peter because he heard that he was arrested and cast into prison and they were playing at sister rhoda's house and here peter goes straight to the door and he starts knocking and the damsel go open my she runs screaming back she says they must have killed him there's a ghost of peter at the door you see the supernatural baffles people and that's what we're looking for supernatural it baffles the natural man so much so that when she called and came then they realized hey this is not the ghost this is peter it's a part of the original version brother when the original prison come in supernatural things are gonna happen get ready for the supernatural get ready to let it happen in your home in your life on your job whatever you have need of speaking this morning that's your kind man now they're baffled pramos they don't know who is this people and the bible says acts 4 10 13. now when they saw the boldness of peter and john and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men they marveled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with jesus [Applause] so i hope you caught that they marveled we know this men they fishermen they're ignorant they're unlearned they can't even sign their names they can't spell they can't do this they don't have no degrees but somehow they're acting with a man that we crucified how come they acting like that why because the image of the prototype was now in them and they took note brother they must take note you have been with jesus they must see jesus being expressed they didn't say they took note that they were the synagogue no they took note that they were with jesus why they were doing the same works that jesus did why are you so scared you made of the same material you made out of the same kind as your prototype that's your kind hallelujah the same source the same material they rest paul and silas existing they put them in prison now you people they don't like to worship and praise the bible says they just sang blueberry paul and silas prayed and they sang praises unto god and the prisoners heard it and suddenly was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison was shaken and immediately all the doors were open and everyone's pants was loose you want to get loose pray and worship you want to get loose in your home pray and worship start singing let others hear the prisoners heard them don't sing so they sing let them hear you die came an earthquake and it shook lose the pains they only prayed and sang no preaching come on brother do that in your home do that in your house do that in your secret closet do that on your job and there was a great earthquake and the doors was open again [Applause] we don't pray and we don't worship enough and then quality of appear before what's the guy's name uh a gripper and they sailed on the ship and the ship got into trouble 14 days and nights they were without food and water and the ship was tossed and
