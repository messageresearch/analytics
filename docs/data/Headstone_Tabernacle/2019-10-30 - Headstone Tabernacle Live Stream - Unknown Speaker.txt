now even right now as we speak the great test right now in the churches is can you stay with the world and God is bringing it down family by family man by man to see if you can stay with that word Oh hallelujah is now right a man a couple Sundays ago and so on we're talking about Iike and isn't that right tip but I second if one wants to share it so powerful isn't that right and even brother George last week was talking about a gun and how that God keep the commandment not to keep anything that was ungodly isn't that right not to keep anything hallelujah that was of the enemies he said Poorna consume it destroy it please God get rid of it hallelujah I will provide for you I will bless you I will give you comments I will give you food to eat saith the Lord I'll provide for you hallelujah where's Gordon Mary Mary's now and here was that the men went up to go and take another city holiday isn't it right and he suffered defeat and as soon as that happened Joshua's a roll up the program roll up the program is now I pull up the caravan something is wrong hallelujah is now right something is not right it is not the promise that God had set for us all that people ain't supposed to be dying holiday it's supposed to be sickness on all this disease and all this pestilence and famine there's not to be spaced out and share we have not received a spirit of fear how about we have received a spirit of adoption where we cry Abba Father Oh hallelujah be not afraid little high Jesus ruff sent mine angel before thee well it through everything he seated - and I'll be our enemy - your enemy and adversary to adversaries if you will stay with that word I'll back you up hallelujah blue glory to God hallelujah hallelujah stay with that word what do they can do he took some stuff and he put it in his stuff holily isn't that right some stuff that didn't belong to him some stuff that was against God's Word isn't that right Holly Holliday is nine and I was thinking about stuff in a kind of strange way you know and I was thinking you know that there's human beings we come into this world naked we come into this world a man just you know with nothing it's not right every one of us was a naked babe born in a hospital room but somehow another along the journey we start cumulating stuff stuff you know just stuff like you know one time I moved out me my wife you know we moved on from one apartment he was in he went to another and you know when we moved into the apartment first we had just a little bit of stuff I know when you're moving out of that one to go to the other one we have most we check the stuff that we had and we actually have more stuff then than we had before that ten asked my wife where did all this stuff come from is now and it's things temporal things some things we need it some things we hold on to it because it has maybe sentimental value nobody is you start accumulating stuff please go on sometimes it give people a sense of comfort they call them hoarders they keep things around them because it makes them feel comfortable in there you know that's my clock that's my lamp that's my this that's my that you man prison all right nothing wrong with that please good man but the problem is when this stuff gets in the way of God that's when God has a problem Haleh make no idols before me saith the Lord I am the Lord your God and I am a jealous crow but nothing before me hallelujah but worship me only but court first this tonight which a family second and then put yourself last a man in that in that order even hallelujah and God will bless you tonight please God because you don't have stuff before him Oh Holley by a contrast has stopped so much that he parried at the end of the tenth is narrow thinking nobody would see thinking nobody would know a man like we went over Sunday God saw him hey I'm as soon as that happened it true the balance off because when they went out to war they suffer defeat because they learn in line with God's Word they won't stain with the Covenant they won't stain with the agreement hallelujah that got trash one made holiday that God made with Joshua he said if you stay with this world I'll give you a victory after victory if you say with what I tell you I'll give you a holler anointing after anointing my man your enemies will be driven out before your face how didn't you never suffer defeat as long as you stay with this word hallelujah and it's not the great test that's going on now hallelujah we have to play things aside the Bible said lay aside every weight that so easily besets us so that we could run the race with patience the race that is set before us lay aside all your stuff tonight lay inside to stop that you treasure things that you value things that you think are so important lay it aside tonight ojala is not important hallelujah build your hopes on things eternal and words of God's unchanging hand go to his word tonight and if you stay with that word God will show you a continuation of the world Oh what he did in Peter he's going to do in you he'll shake you realistic holiday of James healing sick you Leela sick to raise the dead cast out Devils what he did in our early church he'll do for you to say if you stay with that word Holloway Oh somebody plays them tonight hallelujah so many people want a blessing from God but God's want to see how much you can sleep with that word how much you can set yourself aside I become a channel for God and then now as he blesses you you could become the in a position to be a blessing to other people amen other things and people around you then begin to see a bigger picture how God want to use each of us praise God as a powerhouse where we are to bless others and have an effect on others hallelujah prayer to change other people's thinking change other people perspective Oh hallelujah is now right the age we live in is just flowing tonight the age we live in is such an intellectually and people can argue right down to the word right down to a mare is now right what they believe and what Bible they read please don't there's so much of them now maybe not as there were before but the Bible says knowledge has increased and we see that taking place oh honey in the workplace is praise gone there's some people could go toe-to-toe with you on Scripture and this and that and what they think and what you think and a man is just sort come back and forth so what will make the difference well somebody has to live it oh that's right brother hippler our life has got to shine out of you so that people can see you live in this world and staying with this word not by might not by power but by his Spirit in you changing you making you more like this and left like the world oh and when you begin to live this you don't have to explain nothing it'll speak for itself Oh hallelujah people who see the difference they say oh there goes a brother who's been with Jesus

that's the power that's upon the seed world is now right he said remember Abraham seed believes that he said if you're a genuine seed of Abraham the feet of Abraham had in God he said that is in you and you believe what God has said and he said God keeps his promise God keeps his promises tonight if God promised you the Holy Ghost he's gonna keep it if God promised to deliver you he's going to keep it if God promised to make await tonight he's going to keep that word Oh hallelujah in season out of season he is still God and that word remains a sing he said heaven and earth will pass away but my words shall never pass away Oh hallelujah amen hallelujah he said that and he said it now remember he said he already made this promise to Abraham after he gave him a test a man is not right we're just talking about tests now he kept his promise to Abraham I she shall possess what I have to give him a test the seed of Abraham must first be tested all this is powerful to see if they really believe the word he said remember the only way that he could keep the promise of God because he believed the promise of God but the only way that he could keep it was to be tested whether he believed it or not hallelujah hallelujah says one thing to say you believe it but now can you keep it it has a difference now that the Prophet is bringing in in the scripture you believe they would have got Shaw the Word of God calm is powerful we in the church now and we say amen to the word and we feel the anointing and we thank God for his promises but as soon as you leave here can you keep the world

mounting up to something he was bringing it ahead to a point and he's very good at that he's been doing it for years so he was coming to this great crescendo we could bring drop down to a point we

we take what God said it's God's Word that's true we believe God's Word regardless of any but anything else ends amen amen hallelujah he said we let every man who will be alive and let clouds be the truth the true seed of Abraham is now but before you become that true seed he said you've got to go through the tests like Abraham did himself a man is not right he promised not only to Abraham but to his seed that would possess the enemy's games a man isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah I'm God always spoken sending the seed isn't that right God told him I have come out and count the stars

reason he's never a man oh my so now watch see let me just try to finish this up here he said a man it's not right so there's always a promise in the sea when God spoke concerning a seed what the sea were to that they would possess the key to the enemy well they're around the enemy Manas now and they become the fulfillment of God even though they will take on life and their time and in their season hallelujah praise God is nothing there's always a promise resident in there a cocky prophesy and prophesy thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemy Holly sitting in some sometimes he didn't

this 3d stuff that's happening looking around and getting getting thrown off hallelujah by the natural and not even realizing a pion that there's a supernatural God making supernatural things happen is a supernatural devil trying to destroy you trying to cut you off and it'll take supernatural weapons to defeat that super natural enemy and those weapon comes from God and that weapon is his word and word is powerful and any two-edged sword hallelujah and that word is here tonight and you've got that word tonight [Applause] roar equips his sons and daughters with the best equipment nothing

hallelujah hallelujah is not we just take so much confidence they put over the scene it in a pill in a tablet you take a tablet and it doctor tell it this will take care of you this will heal your prisoner sometimes I run experiments on people and tell them drink this and it'll get better and they think it's something fancy and that time is mercy water mixed with vinegar or something that they drink but they so believe it that symptoms actually begin to take place because their mind actually begin to believe that this thing will make them feel better holidays nice they get in the spirit of the things they drinking it believe it or not something will happen to them raises night if people can believe in natural things so much or much more ought we to believe in the Word of God not as eternal this word tonight it's not a natural word but this word you might read it as a Bible you might read in the scriptures halle-loo but when this word is inspired to you this actually have eternal properties in it when you begin to read it hallelujah and say I am the Lord he let all that diseases when that is inspired to you in your situation the eternal properties begin to lift out of the pages of the Bible because you begin to claim that as a promise to yourself Oh same answer my same and somebody halleluyah halleluyah I don't want to be long with you but tonight before we get to pray

weakness I am here for strength you give Beauty factions trench warfare Troy comment in the morning I'm here for my promise I'm here for my anointing I'm here for my blessing yes mic up Lord I lifted up Lord I need You Father but I begin to apply that word not eternal Word of God to every situation to every circumstance in your life in your situation apply to your family she would have gone mighty captain common throughout the years and that's when things just begin to begin to get common to you it's nothing I think prophet was talking about some man who had never seen the ocean before and when he saw it he was so delighted he said look at her wings look at it look at how it pumping and jumping and dancing look at all the solids reflecting through the light and they asked a fisherman about it somebody who was a sailor or something and he said it was just a ball see I see the sea every day and he wasn't excited by it because he seen every day you know to me people come from foreign and maybe they never saw beaches before they come to China look at the ocean look at a waves someone I live in a city for years so you never really get out there and see it for themselves but to us here in China which is normal go to the beach you could drive to the beach take care of our to get to the beach you'd be tried in you know it come on to us and so sometimes that's how sometimes the word might get common to us but don't let it ever get common to you friend don't let it ever come normal to Oh holiday as if it's just something you do on a Wednesday night or something you do on a Sunday or something on a Friday and I know come with our earnest come with an expectation comment a desire to meet God don't let it get common to you Oh hallelujah is now I in the prophetess seen at when the endtime come the church will get too accustomed to be in cool formal and powerless that when the Spirit of God leaves the earth they won't even notice oh because it come comment to them because they are custom lolly and between one another seeing all or delay it is coming I'm not in the spirit of the coming of the Lord not having that boon in that desire gentle no the word that cry to get in a spirit that full desire to please God don't let ever let that get common Oh hallelujah but stay with that will stay with the anointing but Jesus had tarry in Jerusalem and that word Tyree means to stay stay until something happened stay until God fulfill his promise stay until pray until worship until get in the spirit until to what you can do all that you can do ojala was a bridegroom is coming and he's gonna cry out at midnight go out to meet him the bridegroom comment well is not right there be a wise version and there be a foolish virgin it's not who did not do all that it was supposed to do who didn't get that extra oil holiday because they didn't see the need for it oh but there's a wise gudgeon who knows and she needs that extra if she's gonna make it in that rapture she needs the extra and that's what you come for tonight that's what we come for tonight we come for the extra oil Oh hallelujah it takes extra to get extra it's like you can't do hallelujah one fifth and expect 100% no no no no it takes the extra ticket extra extra prayer extra crying out extra blessing extra perseverance going the extra mile or to get that extra blessing Oh I want that kind of blessing already that saves that keeps that satisfies my soul or brother sister one day this world is getting ready to fall apart Oh hallelujah is now right now lost handle is on fire they're getting ready to excavate get people out of Malibu in different places and alright fire spreading all over the place judgments all over the world pretty soon that same city will be under the world huh where will you be then that takes place brother I don't want to be standing no else when I'm the promised Word of God I want to be standing on a rock build your house upon a rock tonight and not upon the sinking sand Oh hallelujah is a revelation of Jesus Christ to this endtime hour well I want to be standing on it oh I don't want to be praying on it Oh hallelujah you'll find my bones here Oh God when you pause and degeneration the fire the Holy Spirit it's every heart into every life in every home and every mother and every wife every father every child that's what we need Lord one more great move hallelujah hallelujah before the devil come and take it over oh and three and a half years but God promised to take you out of here friends amen amen that's what they are striving for tonight it's not right oh please God so now I see now still here when he was brought out testing time he believed God I was able to raise him up from the dead he believed it see because God had made the promise and when God made a promise that he would be father of Nations and he believed that that was so a man he didn't know how it would be when the baby would come but after he trusted 25 years then want us to destroy the baby oh my that same son that he loves so much offer him up isn't that right was a would a Abraham receive hallelujah and he still knew that God's promise was true hallelujah and he gave his son is now the Bible said the seed his seed is the same thing the promise of God is the seal watch to those who are the seed of Abraham the promise is a seal a sign witness and when we believe every promise word then the seal is given to us to confirm the promise oh oh God promised a senior when you stay with that promise word hallelujah seals you and confirms a promise that he made to you in the beginning isn't that right oh I wanna be seal away tonight Oh seal away a lot of baptism of the Holy Ghost see you little out and she'll God in holy glory to God takes fire to do that it takes power to do that only God could do that tonight that's what we come for nothing else will satisfy than the genuine sphere of the Holy Ghost hallelujah oh and God confirms his promise to you a man as an individual it's not right please God oh my Eman Abraham so he says he is he so he said if we being the seed of Abraham we go through the test whether we're gonna believe the Bible or not see the Bible is the Word of God because it is God isn't that right and then after you went through the test to believe he said when some that some what I'm saying that these Americans pass if you accept that he said that's contrary to the world he said if you say you can't see the Holy Ghost today there's no such thing just the Twelve Apostles receive it you can't get it see the word said Peter preaching on the day of Pentecost he said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen he said product promises on to you and to your children and to them that's a far off and even as many as a lord or God shall call oh there's gonna be one more hallelujah get ready to seal his children hallelujah is now right Oh glory glory hallelujah said behold I come quickly my reward is with me to give every man according to his work oh we come to work here tonight nothing become easy it come by a press yes something you have to do you've got a labor to enter into that Oh night labor to enter in it is not right glory hallelujah me man it says me right here in Hebrews four we was reading it here amen he said um he said uh Jesus had given them the rest then would he not afterward have spoken of another day he said there remaineth therefore our rest to the people of God he said up for he that is entered into his rest he also has ceased from his own works as God did from his no more striving one day the struggle will be over tonight one day our struggle with sin your struggle with doubts your struggle it always Amalekites all those Hittites almost Philistines one day will be over when you drag them out of your land o your land will finally have rest from war oh how do you be peace in you'll be rejoicing in heavenly places and the Prophet said that heavenly places is a believers position in Christ so what we are doing tonight is we are striving with all that is within us to get into our position Oh hallelujah hallelujah are not satisfied tonight until we get into our position oh that's what key that had kill him had a desire kill him had another spirit with him he said if I have it go to me be with me then I shall be able to drive out the Philistines to drive out the enemy as the Lord had said off of my Mountain or for my inheritance he had a desire to be in his position what Moses had promised him concerning the word is now right where this promise was he had a desire to be there early on when the time was up the time was up he said give me my mountain I'm not gonna still I am no more hallelujah I've got to go over I've got to possess it if you don't want it that's your problem I come for my portion I compromise heritance I come for my lolly I've got to have it and that's got to be your attitude tonight I've come for my Holy Ghost I come for my portion I come for my healing I come for my deliverance I can't pour what product promised me he promised a fill me with the Baptist Holy Ghost he promised to hear my body he promised to deliver my children he promised to deliver my family I'm not gonna stop I'm gonna pray without ceasing on my knees Oh God you promised Oh God you promised the Holy Ghost you promised to do something you polish the pour out your spirit Here I am Lord honey you need a prayer yeah I am Lord hanging I need a deliverance [Music] hallelujah oh my the right attitude staying with that word what was Cornelius before you will see you Justin leave ouch Justin leave out Oh hallelujah God had a man there praise God hallelujah who Steve with that word he was there doing his part giving arms the Bible said it was a memorial in heaven for his prey Oh hallelujah such a condition till God couldn't take it no more he said no this man is if something this man deserved his reward and he had to touch pizza is servant on the shoulder and say there's a man called Cornelius down there hallelujah who want you need to touch he needs the Holy Ghost I've got to give him up she promised Oh her because he's staying with the world Oh hallelujah I'm gonna give him his promised reward and tonight if you stay with that word sometimes people not looking don't worry what people see you be considered what God sees when you pray go into your closets in a secret place and pray to your father and the father which seeth in secret shall reward you openly father will see it in secret what you my my it's not right please go on hallelujah praise God something just come to me there and I just fail to read it Ezekiel 8 now we know that the supernatural world is real right isn't that right and about a set of father's see it in secret the Lord knoweth the thoughts of your heart what we're talking about Sunday isn't all right Ezekiel 8 here let me read this here and you just listen hey man you could follow along if you wish Ezekiel 8 I'm reading from post 1 the Bible says and it came to pass watch in the sixth day of the sixth month and the fifth day of the month as I sat in mine house and the elders of Judah sat before me he said that the hand of the Lord fell they upon me is Ezekiel's testimony now and he said then I beheld and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire from the appearance of his loins even downward fire and from his loins even upward as the appearance of brightness as a colour of am a man so this is his visitation here now and he said now and he put forth the form of an hand and took me by a lock of mine head and a spirit lifted me up between earth and the heaven and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem oh here's a prophet being lifted up into another dimension and he's seeing something now watch he says here now he says and into Jerusalem he said now much and and to the door the inner gate so he's been lifted up and he's seeing into Jerusalem and now God is showing him something - the door the inner gate and look at that towards the north where the seat of the image of jealousy which provoked it to jealousy and he said I behold the glory of the God of Israel was there according to the vision that I saw in the plane and he said then he said unto me son of man lift up thine eyes now the way to what the known so I lifted up mine eyes towards the way of the north and behold northward and the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry and he said furthermore to me son of man see us what I'll do even the great abominations that the house of Israel committed here and I shall go far off from my sanctuary but till me yet again and all shall see greater abominations it's not so here it was Ezekiel a prophet being lifted up by a lock of his hair into a realm and seeing what what other people not seeing he is seeing all of these great visions all of these things taking place how many times people do things behind closed doors and feel as if God not seeing but God is seeing everything that you do your attitude what you're seeing in your mind don't you know your thoughts speak louder in heavens than your words Oh hallelujah that's why you got to have the right attitude towards the divine promise of God towards his word to what courts people is now towards God's servants and God is judging your attitude and seeing what you are doing how you are doing it isn't that right and who is here tonight The Secret Service agent Oh hallelujah the tutor is here tonight and he's looking at your aptitude to see how you stay with that one oh it's nice to see how you take that word to see what's the to do you have when you go out is now and the test is not in here Amen all right we come in here we wish it the Lord oh we feel good but then when you go out of here what what what takes place who are you and you're out there and then people pull you this way and that way or when you have to face the challenges of the hour it takes something more than just coming to church to face those challenges it takes something more and you know it a many the test is real but God is real also and it's word is real and his word is anointed and if it's anointed in you you live it if it's anointed a new you speak it you something different than what you've been doing all a while because it's got to be inspired to you it's got to be real to you Holly it's got to take ahold of your life Oh hallelujah hallelujah slay me and I trust him it's got to be out there in the real you got to representing the natural and you're walking your talk well I'm getting ready to close tonight oh wee man do you love him Oh hallelujah glory be to God amen and amen Oh hallelujah amen there's something here I wanted to read before we get ready to switch over okay the prophets say he said uh in the end time and time science see he said many tried to say it's tampered with this but done away oh I don't believe that I believe there's got to come some kind of a standard that God will judge the church by or the world he said there's got to be some standard it cannot be a church organization no it can be a creep or something somebody made up it can be based on that no see because they're different and he said furthermore who would know what to do this one claimed to be right this one claimed to have the right interpretation the right thing is now right who would know what to do he said but there is a standard and he said and that is his word and he said I believe that God watches over his word it's not right he said I believe that that word is punctuated exactly the way God wants it amen amen hallelujah praise God isn't that right he said one time he said God didn't tell Moses take off his hat he said Moses gonna say we'll take off our hats in the presence of God it looks nice it looks gentlemanly but that's not what God said that take your shoes off Moses but a place where his tannin is holy honey is not right he go on holy ground now hallelujah you have to obey His commandments hallelujah and do all that he said to do hallelujah huh and here bless you and he'll anoint you and he'll inspire and he'll give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost you give me your promise he'll give you improving you make a way out oh my said but there's no standard what is it is this would I believe that God watches over his word I believe that God would is punctuated exactly the way he wants it the Bible he said it's God's Word to the people he said and there's where the reason I believe in that word he said and I believe that the word is a seed amen amen it's a satanic holiday as a potential to bring forth life and as a potential to become something greater greater than the devil could ever expect the devil watch him but he don't know what's inside of you tonight inside of you is a scene hallelujah inside of you is dynamite waiting to explode tonight Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah let's get ready tonight oh god what God's fixin to do inside of you tonight a man he said there's a reason I believe that whoo he said I believe it what is a seed he said in that seed is sold in a right ground and watered by the Holy Spirit he said it'll bring forth of its kind he said any promise that God made God will do a man just one little testimony here the Prophet the Prophet breath he said if they brought a little girl here on a stretcher he said they called me in in a night I'm on the road and stuff and said that the glue can't live he said the cancer was so bad he said she was about 17 years old he said and she can't even get there she was gonna die before he gets there he said it was a pitiful case he said a lovely little child about 17 years old and he said to prove something to my church I never touched the child at all here's what he did he said I never much as touched her he said I walked in she was laying on a stretcher he said of course there were other sick people he said but I was concerned about the child he said prophet said to catch her spirit when I spoke to her so you wanted to speak to her directly so anything you say she seemed like a very fine girl he said I see no reason why that child should fill a pretty mature grieve my so he had a desire to see her live amen amen hallelujah here is no and he said and and that has to be the devil trying to take a life so he said so I never touched a child at all he said I just went right to the pulpit with the word and he said and he stayed right with the world and the percent and the word healed her so instantly until she caught up and she walked away and he said she's alright now living like anybody else hallelujah Holocaust Oh
