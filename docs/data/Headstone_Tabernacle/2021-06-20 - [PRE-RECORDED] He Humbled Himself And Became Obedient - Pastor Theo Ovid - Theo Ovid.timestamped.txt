[35:46] 1
[35:47] to 5.
[35:52] all right here we go philippians
[35:56] chapter 2 verse one if there be any
[35:58] therefore any consolation in christ if
[36:00] any comfort of love if any fellowship of
[36:02] the spirit
[36:03] if any bowers of mercy is fulfilling my
[36:05] joy
[36:06] that should be like-minded having the
[36:08] same love being of one accord
[36:10] of one mind let nothing be done through
[36:13] strife or
[36:14] vain glory but in lowliness of mind
[36:17] that each esteem other better than
[36:20] themselves
[36:22] look not every man on his own things but
[36:24] every man
[36:25] also on the things of others let
[36:28] this mind be in you which
[36:31] was also in christ jesus and he's
[36:34] describing
[36:35] the kind of mind who
[36:38] being in the form of god thought it not
[36:41] robbery to be equal with god
[36:43] but made himself of no reputation
[36:47] and took upon him the form of a servant
[36:50] was made in the likeness of men
[36:52] being found in fashion as a man he
[36:55] humbled himself
[36:56] and became obedient unto death even the
[36:58] death of the cross
[37:00] a wherefore god also had highly exalted
[37:02] him
[37:03] and given them a name which is above
[37:06] every name
[37:07] that at the name of jesus every knee
[37:09] should bow
[37:10] of things in heaven and things and earth
[37:12] and things under the earth
[37:14] that every tongue should confess that
[37:15] jesus christ is lord

[37:22] i want to read from verse 32
[37:29] finally amen amen
[37:32] what shall i more save for the time
[37:35] would fail me

[37:42] through faith
[37:43] subdued kingdoms wrote righteousness
[37:45] obtain promises
[37:46] stop them out of lions quench the
[37:49] violence of fire escape the edge of the
[37:51] sword
[37:52] out of weakness were made strong wax
[37:54] valiant and fight
[37:56] turned to flight the armies of the
[37:57] aliens woman received a dead rays
[38:00] to life again others were tortured not
[38:03] accepting deliverance
[38:04] that they might obtain a better
[38:06] resurrection others had trials
[38:08] of cruel mockings and scourges ye
[38:11] moreover of bonds and imprisonment
[38:13] they were stoned they were sown asunder
[38:17] they were tempted they were slain with
[38:19] the sword
[38:20] they wandered about in sheepskin and
[38:23] goat skin
[38:24] being destitute afflicted tormented of
[38:26] whom the world was not worthy
[38:28] they wandered in deserts and mountains
[38:31] in
[38:32] dens and caves of the earth and these
[38:34] all
[38:35] haven't obtained a good report through
[38:36] fate receive not the promise
[38:39] god having provided some better thing
[38:41] for us that they
[38:43] without us should not be made perfect
[38:46] last scripture first corinthians chapter
[38:48] 2 i want to read verse 1 to 5.
[38:53] paul speaking and i brethren when i
[38:56] came to you came not with excellency of
[38:59] speech
[39:00] or of wisdom declaring unto you the
[39:02] testimony of god
[39:05] for i determine not to know anything
[39:08] among you
[39:09] save jesus christ and him crucified
[39:12] and i was with you in weakness and in
[39:15] fear
[39:16] and in much trembling and my speech and
[39:19] my
[39:20] preaching was not with enticing words of
[39:23] man's
[39:23] wisdom
[39:27] but in the demonstration of the spirit
[39:30] and of power that your faith here the
[39:33] purpose why
[39:35] why that your faith should not stand
[39:38] in the wisdom of men but in the power of
[39:41] god let's pray one more time
[39:42] father we thank you for your blessed
[39:44] word and we are blessed to read the word
[39:46] and to hear the word
[39:47] interpret it to our hearts confirm your
[39:50] word with signs
[39:51] wonders and miracles and may become a
[39:54] reality as the prophet said
[39:56] that the mysteries will unfold that we
[39:58] might see the plainness of god
[40:01] to know how to conduct ourselves in the
[40:04] evil day we live in
[40:06] granted father in jesus name we ask it
[40:08] amen
[40:09] you may be seated
[40:17] we'll have a title this morning this is
[40:20] our first
[40:20] service of the year are we looking
[40:23] forward for god to do great things among
[40:25] us this year
[40:26] this 2018 we have to be looking forward
[40:29] on a great expectation
[40:31] and you get what you expect and you have
[40:33] to do more if you want to get more
[40:36] isn't that right okay so the title i
[40:39] have this morning is he
[40:40] uh from the scriptures in philippians
[40:42] the title is he
[40:43] humbled himself and became obedient
[40:47] that's the title just to take a
[40:50] scripture
[40:51] text from what christ did he humbled
[40:55] himself and before you could come into
[40:59] obedience you have to learn
[41:02] how to humble yourself
[41:06] another inspiration the revelation of
[41:09] jesus christ
[41:10] now we know the scripture hebrews 5 8
[41:12] says though he was son
[41:14] yet learning obedience by the things
[41:18] that he suffered though he was a son
[41:21] it didn't give him a free pass it didn't
[41:24] give him
[41:25] as is you though he was a son
[41:28] the suffering didn't make him a son he
[41:31] was always a son
[41:33] but even though he was a son he learned
[41:36] obedience by the things that he
[41:40] suffered so obedience is something that
[41:43] you have to learn
[41:45] you are not born with obedience your
[41:48] mother didn't give you that
[41:49] and your father didn't hand you that you
[41:52] have to learn that
[41:53] and things have to come to teach you and
[41:56] to bring you
[41:57] in obedience are you with me now
[42:00] you have to be able to be taught in
[42:02] order to learn
[42:04] it come like if you're if you're not a
[42:05] good host wife coming to church doesn't
[42:07] make you a good host wife

[48:12] commission to work
[48:14] to labor to strive and this possession
[48:17] comes starts as a labor
[48:19] it starts with fate but you're laboring
[48:21] to enter into this great promised land
[48:24] there's always been that way god set it
[48:26] up that way a labor of striving like the
[48:28] chicken in the egg
[48:29] he had to pick his way out amen that
[48:31] worm had to be converted to a butterfly
[48:33] have to press its way out
[48:35] god put it in you that it wouldn't be a
[48:37] jellyfish
[48:38] that it wouldn't be some kind of oh my

[48:46] in puppet business forget where they
[48:48] call it
[48:49] you could say cookie monster i'm fluffy
[48:52] thing
[48:52] when you put the handy hands so when you
[48:54] put your hand here so god don't want you
[48:56] like that
[48:57] push it so you say so no no doesn't want
[48:59] you like that
[49:00] a rag doll yeah then toy doll them toy
[49:03] right though
[49:05] and you know deuteronomy 29 29
[49:08] the secret things belong to the lord
[49:11] [Applause]
[49:12] that's his own but those things are
[49:15] revealed
[49:16] belong to us no devil can't stop you
[49:20] from getting what what is revealed
[49:27] do i have a shout in the house
[49:30] once it's a secret god could keep it but
[49:32] once it come down as a word

[49:37] property
[49:43] secret things belonging to the lord our
[49:45] god
[49:46] but those things that are revealed
[49:49] belong unto
[49:50] us and to our children
[49:53] what's the purpose for that nobody just
[49:55] says us no that we may do all the words
[49:58] so all the revelation has to come into
[50:01] action
[50:03] it's not for sitting information
[50:10] i see people preaching already i meant
[50:12] scratching it so you could see the
[50:13] engagement
[50:14] making a question man you see people on
[50:16] the forum making a question maximum
[50:20] that's not what the word is for the word
[50:23] is to reveal
[50:24] to push you into action let me get
[50:26] another scripture habakkuk to write
[50:28] division
[50:29] make it plain that he that read it
[50:33] could run
[50:38] so this vision of god must be made
[50:41] plain i am not here to tell you you're
[50:44] fine
[50:45] all right i'm not here to tell you
[50:47] you're the nicest interesting sliced
[50:49] bread
[50:50] sorry i'm not here to tell you that
[50:52] you're here to find out your bad spots
[50:54] your crooked spots your wicked ways
[50:58] things in your heart that your husband
[50:59] don't know that your wife don't know
[51:01] that your children don't know
[51:06] that is what you're here for for the
[51:08] surgeon general's
[51:10] knife the sharp sword
[51:14] cut them between the bone and the marrow
[51:16] to come and cut out
[51:18] what's not like him do i hear a shout in
[51:21] the house
[51:21] [Applause]
[51:31] but about how many absolute says this
[51:34] let me tell you something listen to this
[51:37] closely
[51:39] this is the complete
[51:43] divine revelation of god
[51:46] his will the coming of christ everything
[51:49] lays
[51:50] right in this book completed
[51:52] [Applause]
[51:55] and if anything draws you off of that
[51:59] and throws you off the find the compass
[52:03] and that sets you to the word of god in
[52:05] other words don't let
[52:06] nothing shake you off the word of god
[52:09] don't let wife
[52:10] husband children money car land
[52:13] pasta bishop pope whatever it is
[52:17] don't let nothing shake you off the word
[52:19] when i give my heart to jesus christ i
[52:21] was 17 years old and when i saw is only
[52:24] three things
[52:24] to throw a man off is either as money is
[52:27] woman or popularity
[52:28] if there's ten things is there a hundred
[52:30] things just three things
[52:33] i asked god to protect me from them
[52:35] three things
[52:37] i said lord let me be a man that gonna
[52:39] wait upon you
[52:40] because i found the scripture where i
[52:42] said they that wait upon the lord
[52:44] i found the scripture where young men
[52:46] shall fall
[52:47] utterly fall and i know the scripture
[52:50] that i call you young man because you're
[52:52] strong
[52:52] so when i understood that because you're
[52:55] young that don't mean you're going to
[52:56] stand
[52:57] you still have to wait upon god when i
[53:00] understood that
[53:01] i purpose to be a man that could obey
[53:04] upon god
[53:05] i will wait till my change come and if
[53:07] you wait upon god going to bless you
[53:12] the devil cannot stop a man that put
[53:15] gods
[53:15] first i don't care what shape to the
[53:18] left
[53:18] what to the right but that man
[53:21] gonna comfort anyhow
[53:29] glory to god never in my
[53:33] life i ever thought i would encounter
[53:36] crooked dishonest
[53:37] lying preachers but they have them
[53:40] hallelujah
[53:41] but they can't stop anything because
[53:43] they don't have a heaven they don't have
[53:45] hell and they don't have the power of
[53:46] adoption years ago god showed me
[53:49] the adoption have nothing to do with the
[53:51] people adoptions do with father and son
[53:54] so because of how much the people love
[53:56] the man and love the pastor what did i
[53:58] have nothing to do
[53:59] god have to say this is my beloved son
[54:02] in whom i'm well pleased that's why i
[54:04] don't bother with the people
[54:06] whether you want to shout or shout don't
[54:07] show that's your business i will shout
[54:09] for you
[54:10] i will praise god for you oh glory to
[54:12] god because i know my name is on that
[54:14] book
[54:16] i know i'm a child of the king
[54:21] oh hallelujah
[54:35] [Applause]
[54:36] hallelujah what about him he said god
[54:40] created me a revival let me be the
[54:42] revival
[54:43] let each one of us be the revival the
[54:45] revival in me
[54:47] make me to hunger make me the test
[54:50] creating me lord that what is needed in
[54:54] me
[54:55] let me from this our own be more
[54:57] consecrated servant
[54:58] a better servant more blessed of you
[55:01] more humbler
[55:02] more kinder more willing to work more
[55:04] look
[55:05] to the things that are positive and
[55:08] forgetting to the things that are passed
[55:10] let's cut off 2017. we have a land in
[55:13] front of us
[55:14] atlanta possess it's a good land it have
[55:18] signs in it
[55:25] [Applause]
[55:31] in it it's a fire fire fire in it
[55:34] and have your foot on the devil's neck
[55:36] on it
[55:38] oh give the lord a shout if that breaks
[55:41] you after pressure in it
[55:42] deliver us after deliverance pull after
[55:45] power
[55:47] all of that is in that land it's my
[55:51] oh glory you must be seated
[55:55] so brother man i'm talking about the
[55:56] lesson he said feeling the holy spirit
[55:59] which way to set this
[56:01] that the people will see it you see
[56:04] you've got to see it i love how the lord
[56:07] did this thing
[56:08] it is beautiful i just love it write the
[56:11] vision
[56:13] make it plain so the ministers fulfill
[56:16] the commission
[56:17] when the people get the vision of god
[56:21] so what the prophet said is that the
[56:24] minister can't bring the revival
[56:26] thank god the prophet said that these
[56:28] jokers want to bring the revival
[56:29] themselves
[56:30] but he said the man can't bring it it
[56:32] take the people
[56:33] so the minister have to transfer the
[56:35] vision so if you want to play pope and
[56:37] keep everything for himself
[56:38] as the revealer of z miseries
[56:42] then he on his own because he have to
[56:45] stand there revealing a whole lot of
[56:46] things
[56:47] for a very long time but the point is is
[56:50] till we all come
[56:52] not till the minister come the ministry
[56:55] is still we all come
[56:57] into the unity of the faith into the
[57:00] knowledge not not some come all come
[57:02] knowledge of the son of god unto a
[57:04] perfect man
[57:04] unto the measure of the stature of
[57:08] christ
[57:10] measure because we don't have all the
[57:12] same
[57:13] measure oh hallelujah
[57:17] he ascended high and gave gifts unto men
[57:20] we don't
[57:20] have all the same gifts we don't have
[57:23] the same measure
[57:24] but the content is good
[57:30] so when god hit a housewife and fell
[57:33] over the holy ghost it doesn't make a
[57:34] preacher because she get god in her
[57:36] no no it doesn't do that if make a one
[57:39] anointed holy
[57:40] ghost big cooking
[57:43] cooking wife hallelujah food
[57:46] my god a husband can't wait to come over
[57:48] that kind of food
[57:49] that's anointed food in that house
[57:50] that's what we're talking about
[57:52] a revival inside the hole see them
[57:54] systems rejoicing already
[57:55] they want to be this kind of thing holy
[57:57] ghost-filled wife
[57:59] praying wife anointed wife husband and
[58:02] wife devils after him by the right
[58:04] prayer
[58:04] and michael jordan his sword cutting
[58:07] them devils away from her husband that's
[58:09] what we're talking about
[58:10] that's when we the wife can make the
[58:11] dishes holy ghost revival
[58:13] praying in the home oh glory to god time
[58:16] wash the dishes
[58:18] hallelujah when the husband come home
[58:20] see all the dishes all day
[58:21] you want to know what happened she said
[58:22] oh god oh god refill me with the holy
[58:25] ghost
[58:25] i had a holy ghost showdown come on give
[58:28] the lord a shout in the house
[58:29] how many of you for revival this morning
[58:39] [Applause]
[58:43] i want to see which way to set this that
[58:45] the people will see it that you might in
[58:47] seeing it
[58:48] be enlightened and cause you
[58:51] to come closer to christ because we are
[58:54] the end time
[58:56] not closest to church but the christ
[58:59] may we not take this as a lecture but
[59:02] may we
[59:02] solemnly take the warnings of the holy
[59:06] spirit
[59:07] and pray day and night don't let nothing

[1:02:15] i'll save my use my use my teeth use my
[1:02:17] gums butter fighting right true
[1:02:20] praise god queen don't fight it oh glory
[1:02:23] to god so they had goat skins tormented
[1:02:25] disinflicted
[1:02:26] what will our testimony stand up these
[1:02:28] ideas
[1:02:30] how will it be besides that we have to
[1:02:32] have everything so nice
[1:02:35] my my my my so holy church start up the
[1:02:39] early church start up with fire
[1:02:41] with power and then afterwards what
[1:02:43] happened
[1:02:44] they begin listening describe it they
[1:02:47] begin
[1:02:47] cutting off the spirit and adding the
[1:02:50] natural
[1:02:51] yes i know
[1:02:54] that's why i say you better talk about
[1:02:56] which doctors
[1:02:58] doctors you know
[1:03:01] you hear the title it's which doctors
[1:03:03] you
[1:03:04] then have their doctorate in witchcraft
[1:03:07] not
[1:03:07] talk craft which graph
[1:03:11] did they different altogether and they
[1:03:13] didn't have one
[1:03:14] some wish doctor coming from some church
[1:03:16] and he's doing something so like that
[1:03:17] and the pastor falling down and he fell
[1:03:19] asleep right pastor he broke him in
[1:03:20] jesus name
[1:03:21] and he fallen down man pelting spell and
[1:03:24] whatnot
[1:03:25] afterwards he passed and rebuked him in
[1:03:27] jesus name he fall back
[1:03:28] too far to hold him i thought he can't
[1:03:30] catch himself
[1:03:32] and he said that jesus people had to
[1:03:33] shout and jump
[1:03:35] because jesus name versus whatever power
[1:03:37] that fellow working with
[1:03:38] nice wish doctor thing this message
[1:03:40] people without spirit
[1:03:41] they have no clue what this person is
[1:03:43] like if satan come with a bright shining
[1:03:45] light they kind of interview him
[1:03:46] i know he's the devil i'm not descendant
[1:03:48] of the devil bringing wrong doctrine you
[1:03:50] don't know the devil
[1:03:51] entertaining satan says sit down here
[1:03:53] where else you have
[1:03:54] what are mysteries you have oh glory to
[1:03:57] god
[1:03:58] that's what we're talking about the
[1:03:59] church have to be attuned to spirit
[1:04:02] this natural path is only packed but in
[1:04:04] the beginning after the church has
[1:04:06] broken into the spirit realm
[1:04:07] there was removing spirit bringing
[1:04:09] natural removing spirit
[1:04:11] bringing natural until the only spirit
[1:04:13] man so called
[1:04:15] was the pope it went to one man
[1:04:19] he's our man and god don't want that
[1:04:24] actually god said he hate that he hate
[1:04:27] the lady being conquered
[1:04:28] he hate you not having what you're
[1:04:30] supposed to have
[1:04:31] when you leave are you supposed to walk
[1:04:33] with a bundle of joy a bundle of peace a
[1:04:35] bundle
[1:04:36] not a separate bundle like tottenham in
[1:04:38] your back a bundle
[1:04:40] when you open that up so you can share
[1:04:41] it out you can say neighbor i have joy
[1:04:44] in service
[1:04:45] you want some you have a bundle of it
[1:04:48] a bundle of god's love a bundle of god's
[1:04:50] peace when you go on your job you have a
[1:04:52] bundle of it
[1:04:53] you could smile hallelujah praise god
[1:04:56] you could laugh you could rejoice you
[1:04:58] could shout
[1:04:59] because you know inside your soul you're
[1:05:01] all right oh god the lord gods and
[1:05:03] praises
[1:05:05] hallelujah so watch each year the
[1:05:08] cutting of the spirit are the natural of
[1:05:10] the spirit other nature
[1:05:11] until now they're ready to do it again
[1:05:13] we're living in the last days the
[1:05:14] closing the consummation of the church
[1:05:16] now why does satan hate revelation
[1:05:20] why is he so against revelation
[1:05:23] it is because the entire canon of god's
[1:05:27] word
[1:05:28] and church is solemnly built upon
[1:05:29] revelation amen
[1:05:31] so normal no one wants satan your
[1:05:32] business keep you in the flesh
[1:05:34] keep it natural you come to service you
[1:05:36] come late so you can't even sing to get
[1:05:38] in the spirit
[1:05:39] that's what the singing is for the
[1:05:40] singing is again inspirational
[1:05:42] to be prepared for the world you know
[1:05:44] the singing is to bring an atmosphere
[1:05:45] you know
[1:05:46] the signatures will be singing that was
[1:05:50] song they write some long message song i
[1:05:52] have to appreciate the club
[1:05:55] because it's worth somebody profit now
[1:05:57] so yeah it's something good
[1:06:00] but have no anointing with it you have
[1:06:02] no inspiration with it they have no fire
[1:06:04] no presence nothing with it it's just
[1:06:05] like
[1:06:05] information in song form
[1:06:10] but when them writers was going through
[1:06:12] the experience
[1:06:13] it was no information in some form when
[1:06:16] that brother lost his wife
[1:06:18] and somebody says say lord he said
[1:06:20] precious lord
[1:06:22] and he said precious lord take my hair
[1:06:26] then fellas wasn't talking or lettering
[1:06:28] they're reading a book
[1:06:29] and they put some words together and
[1:06:31] call like a message song
[1:06:32] wasn't that it was real
[1:06:35] [Applause]
[1:06:39] the blind singer she said i shall know
[1:06:41] him by the prince of the nail in his
[1:06:43] hands
[1:06:44] that was no message song that was a
[1:06:46] reality
[1:06:48] oh the blood of jesus oh hallelujah i
[1:06:51] know
[1:06:51] it was the blood there's a fountain
[1:06:54] filled with blood
[1:06:55] joints from emmanuel fame where sinners
[1:06:58] punch beneath the flat
[1:06:59] loose all the guilty stills
[1:07:03] oh get the lord i shout in the house
[1:07:05] [Applause]
[1:07:12] hallelujah
[1:07:15] in the walls of an insane institution
[1:07:18] they found the words written
[1:07:20] the love of god so pure so merciless and
[1:07:23] strong
[1:07:24] it shall forever more endure the saints
[1:07:26] and angels song
[1:07:28] there ain't no lighting that's inspired
[1:07:31] stuff
[1:07:32] the man went crazy trying to figure out
[1:07:34] the love of god
[1:07:35] and have our important song written
[1:07:36] there oh give the lord a shout
[1:07:40] we might look crazy sometimes but we are
[1:07:42] inspired oh glory to god
[1:07:44] because the lord has shout we might talk
[1:07:47] crazy sometimes
[1:07:48] we might go crazy sometimes but believe
[1:07:51] you me
[1:07:52] be i inspired
[1:07:59] [Applause]
[1:08:04] so the church is not built upon jesus
[1:08:06] it's built upon the revelation
[1:08:08] of jesus christ what has been revealed
[1:08:12] so there's no intellectual stuff with
[1:08:14] that revelation
[1:08:15] revelation of nothing to an intellect
[1:08:17] when when when isaiah got the revelation
[1:08:19] of when he shall conceive
[1:08:20] if it had passed his intellect i've
[1:08:23] heard oh
[1:08:27] just rewind
[1:08:31] could you play that again that's if it
[1:08:34] hooked the intellect
[1:08:35] but because it bypassed intellect he
[1:08:37] says a virgin shall conceive
[1:08:39] and be a son his name shall be called
[1:08:41] wonderful counselor everlasting father
[1:08:43] prince of peace
[1:08:47] somebody said i challenge you of which
[1:08:49] you can conceive

[1:08:56] that's not my interpretation of it you
[1:08:57] know that come direct
[1:08:59] no secretary i come direct flesh and
[1:09:02] blood didn't reveal that
[1:09:03] that was direct a fortune shall conceive
[1:09:06] god interpret his own word

[1:09:21] and that bride will be called by seven
[1:09:22] thunders because seven thunders we're

[1:19:29] glory to god the prophet said when the
[1:19:32] devil saw that he said wait a minute you
[1:19:33] gotta stop that
[1:19:35] nice serious stuff now i know there's no
[1:19:37] shaking in upper room and falling down
[1:19:39] i could bear with that but this thing
[1:19:40] here this is the same what jesus do
[1:19:42] them guys doing too that's what we're
[1:19:45] talking about
[1:19:46] the same works i do shall we do also
[1:19:50] and greater oh my
[1:19:53] so barbara said when that time comes
[1:19:54] through the holy ghost when reveals
[1:19:56] christ back in the church with power
[1:19:58] and demonstration and healing the sick
[1:20:01] and making the signs that we said would
[1:20:02] follow the believers then satan turns
[1:20:05] over in his bed
[1:20:06] he does something about that until that
[1:20:08] time syrian document church you join
[1:20:10] amen oh how much money you reveal
[1:20:16] are they still in mysterious balls
[1:20:20] here's one packs
[1:20:23] and satan's satan loading them up when

[1:20:29] it's a bottomless pit
[1:20:39] let's move on to somebody else but i'm
[1:20:41] tap already they focus on that
[1:20:43] they're not focused on the life of
[1:20:45] christ to be made manifest
[1:20:47] to focus on that you have to have a
[1:20:49] revelation of jesus christ
[1:20:50] [Applause]
[1:20:52] do you get that who made me understand
[1:20:54] that
[1:20:55] not a revelation of this church not a
[1:20:57] version of my ministry
[1:20:58] not a man revelation i'm your pastor not
[1:21:00] that but the revelation
[1:21:03] of jesus christ if i die in the morning
[1:21:05] instead of that revelation
[1:21:07] if this church fall flat you still have
[1:21:08] revelation if trainers split into 15
[1:21:11] parts
[1:21:11] you'll still have the revelation of
[1:21:14] jesus christ make sure
[1:21:17] make sure you have a revelation of jesus
[1:21:22] [Applause]
[1:21:26] christ
[1:21:28] i remember a good friend of mines that
[1:21:30] perkins holiness he couldn't see the
[1:21:31] message
[1:21:32] we used to work together i said share
[1:21:35] with him with the word
[1:21:36] and they tell me it's over he said you
[1:21:40] have a revelation
[1:21:41] of jesus christ you see everybody that
[1:21:44] talked to him about his messenger brown
[1:21:45] and said brother brown saying brother
[1:21:46] bran i'm saying but he couldn't get that
[1:21:48] i was talking about jesus but jesus said
[1:21:52] how jesus said behold i will send you
[1:21:53] prophets and if you see through the eyes
[1:21:56] of jesus
[1:21:56] you could present it correctly if you
[1:21:59] don't have that but i
[1:22:00] am saying who is brother branham to them
[1:22:02] but iran is an authority to them
[1:22:04] but around that choice to you but you're
[1:22:06] not presenting christ
[1:22:08] you're presenting a prophet like a
[1:22:10] prophet and they prophesy prophet
[1:22:11] prophet who is that
[1:22:12] they don't even understand that there's
[1:22:13] a promise behind elijah
[1:22:15] they don't even understand that so
[1:22:17] you're presenting something they can't
[1:22:18] even start to begin to grasp
[1:22:20] and they turn it down and they say well
[1:22:21] they reject it they reject what
[1:22:24] you have to be have a revelation jesus
[1:22:25] christ then you can present christ to
[1:22:27] the people
[1:22:28] through the prophet
[1:22:29] [Applause]
[1:22:32] so that is why i can tell you i don't
[1:22:34] buy nobody fight
[1:22:36] you have your fight with this one that's
[1:22:38] you and them i know you me and them

[1:22:57] i just be sorry for the believers
[1:23:01] this pastor probably that passed and

[1:23:13] oh you're on doing that edit undo that's
[1:23:15] called only microsoft word
[1:23:16] that's the computer you can't do that
[1:23:19] after scrubbing people head
[1:23:21] and assault the mind and rape their
[1:23:22] spirits and sow the wrong seeds in them
[1:23:25] against this one and that one
[1:23:26] oh you're on doing that
[1:23:28] [Applause]
[1:23:29] god will judge them not supposed to do
[1:23:32] that
[1:23:35] oh yeah that's strong right that's
[1:23:37] strong right yeah yeah it's strong
[1:23:40] but it's the truth and you shall know
[1:23:43] the truth
[1:23:44] and the truth shall set you free when
[1:23:47] they go in court they say
[1:23:48] do you promise to speak the truth the
[1:23:51] whole truth
[1:23:52] are nothing but the truth the other day
[1:23:54] all three
[1:23:56] because you go and lie so the first part
[1:23:58] cleared that
[1:23:59] truth but you can sell part
[1:24:03] whole truth you can leave out some
[1:24:05] nothing but the truth
[1:24:08] give us all god say i desire truth
[1:24:12] from the inward parts god one truth from
[1:24:15] with inside
[1:24:16] the depths and shoot from inside of you
[1:24:19] that's why jesus tell the woman go call
[1:24:20] your husband
[1:24:21] to see what kind of woman she is it's
[1:24:23] not a matter she's doing this and doing
[1:24:24] that and living this man or that man you
[1:24:25] know it's what's inside of her
[1:24:27] it's not what so much you're doing is
[1:24:28] who you are is that your career
[1:24:31] he took upon him no reputation
[1:24:32] repetition is what others think about
[1:24:34] you
[1:24:35] but character is who you are
[1:24:40] everybody can see you nice and nice and
[1:24:42] nice but that does have to be so
[1:24:44] that's what people say that what people
[1:24:46] think but are you nice
[1:24:49] do you do nice things do you have a nice
[1:24:51] character
[1:24:52] or are you crooked inside but nice
[1:24:54] outside
[1:24:56] that's what the word come to do now go
[1:24:58] between the bone and the marrow and go
[1:24:59] down inside
[1:25:01] [Applause]
[1:25:04] glory hallelujah
[1:25:08] hallelujah the woman jesus is not fit to
[1:25:10] take that bread and casted the dogs
[1:25:12] the woman said truth lord
[1:25:15] i'm a dog but the doctors get crumbs
[1:25:18] just say go your way woman she humbled
[1:25:21] herself
[1:25:22] hallelujah praise god and she received a
[1:25:25] blessing
[1:25:26] that's the problem people don't want to
[1:25:27] humble themselves oh yeah they want
[1:25:29] bless you they want blessings but they
[1:25:31] don't want to humble
[1:25:32] because to obey you have to subject
[1:25:34] yourself
[1:25:36] and jesus didn't talk taught robbie to
[1:25:38] be equal with god he was god but here
[1:25:40] come and say i am god look at me
[1:25:43] you see these muscles these are god
[1:25:45] muscles
[1:25:49] be just like around that uh a gorilla
[1:25:52] jesus didn't do that he humbled himself
[1:25:56] he became the former servant and he
[1:25:59] became obedient
[1:26:01] and the bible said let this mind
[1:26:04] be in you before that paul said esteem
[1:26:07] each other better than yourself
[1:26:09] that means see your brother better than
[1:26:12] you
[1:26:13] bigger than you so you're not fighting
[1:26:15] for somebody's face
[1:26:16] like better than she i'm better than he
[1:26:19] i am
[1:26:21] say revelation another word this one has
[1:26:23] more revelation
[1:26:25] so he is the man of the hour
[1:26:28] listen every minister will be preached
[1:26:29] by the faith and revelation god gave
[1:26:31] them
[1:26:32] i'm not trying to have nobody measure i
[1:26:34] never try to be anybody
[1:26:36] else but what god have me i'm very
[1:26:38] comfortable to be what god made me and i
[1:26:39] want to do the best that i can
[1:26:41] and so each one of you must be that way
[1:26:43] to surrender to the lord isn't that
[1:26:45] right
[1:26:46] so let's look at the vision we have
[1:26:47] today for the burnout
[1:26:52] find out if david was talking about
[1:26:55] david
[1:26:56] and the rest of them would only have
[1:26:57] consulted the bread of the hour
[1:26:59] you remember david got in trouble right
[1:27:01] you didn't consult the prophet
[1:27:03] they even want to bring out the act
[1:27:04] david didn't move and led to do this and
[1:27:06] that's the other and he didn't consult
[1:27:08] god
[1:27:08] and men died innocent man died so you
[1:27:11] watch
[1:27:12] if the priests and prophets and
[1:27:13] preachers and theologians schools and
[1:27:15] our nation would have consulted the hour
[1:27:17] now it won't do them no good they don't
[1:27:19] they don't move out it won't help a bit
[1:27:21] she's gone now she's crossed the line
[1:27:23] five years ago between repentance mercy
[1:27:25] and judgment
[1:27:25] talking about um america notice what is
[1:27:29] then what can be done what is to be done
[1:27:30] let's consult the prophet
[1:27:32] the bible where we cannot add or take
[1:27:34] away from it
[1:27:35] god takes us from the book of life the
[1:27:37] bible said malachi 4
[1:27:38] version 10 how the seven seas would be
[1:27:41] open
[1:27:42] and reveal all these mysteries have been
[1:27:43] hid through these reformers
[1:27:45] he said how it would be done it's in the
[1:27:48] bible
[1:27:48] thus saith the lord god has completely
[1:27:52] perfectly identified that and vindicated
[1:27:56] to be the truth
[1:27:57] by signs wonders in the heavens in the
[1:27:58] skies everything else for 33 years you
[1:28:01] think they listen to it
[1:28:02] no they're dead it was when this thing
[1:28:05] happened that david saw
[1:28:06] he said oh god send us a david that can
[1:28:09] see where he's standing
[1:28:11] that can look out and see god made a
[1:28:13] promise what
[1:28:14] how he's going to do it today god said
[1:28:16] it writing in his word
[1:28:18] how he would do it god told mikaya
[1:28:21] maikaya examined his vision before 400
[1:28:24] dignified prophets
[1:28:26] he examined his vision to see what was
[1:28:28] right he looked back to what the prophet
[1:28:30] said before him
[1:28:31] to see what happened he looked back he
[1:28:32] saw elijah stand in there say ahab the
[1:28:34] dogs will lick your blood too
[1:28:36] and he seen that the vision was exactly
[1:28:38] according to the word of god so he
[1:28:39] pronounced it
[1:28:40] no matter what the rest of them said
[1:28:42] amen still with the word
[1:28:45] when my car said go you say when i come
[1:28:47] back i will be with you
[1:28:48] he said if you come back god never
[1:28:50] talked to me
[1:28:55] let's look at the vision we have today
[1:28:57] is it building churches
[1:28:59] is it new things is it great things are
[1:29:02] going to happen
[1:29:02] or is it judgment this is what is facing
[1:29:06] the world
[1:29:07] america is perfectly sodom right now it
[1:29:10] is saddam
[1:29:11] anointed america is getting ripe for
[1:29:13] judgment
[1:29:14] they have two kings kim jong-un on that
[1:29:17] side and kingdom
[1:29:18] trump on that side both of them chatting
[1:29:21] around and i'm talking
[1:29:22] nuclear talk but something on the break
[1:29:24] are you going to break soon
[1:29:26] it is judgment there's nothing left but
[1:29:29] judgment you know
[1:29:30] so the bride have to come into position
[1:29:32] before these things begin to strike
[1:29:35] oh yes they're going to begin to move in
[1:29:36] because when those hands really sink the
[1:29:37] bike will be here
[1:29:39] so things will be moving in it wouldn't
[1:29:42] be business as usual
[1:29:44] or business as normal something horrible
[1:29:46] happen watch people start to pray
[1:29:48] oh god not the praying but that's how
[1:29:51] we're supposed to be now
[1:29:53] making a greater push isn't that right
[1:29:56] because los angeles is a sign for the
[1:29:58] world not for the bride
[1:30:01] that's for the world outside but for you
[1:30:03] you're supposed to see your promises
[1:30:04] made manifest
[1:30:06] right in your midst that was you
[1:30:09] supposed to be looking for your promises
[1:30:11] isn't that right watch so watch
[1:30:14] so david consulted the priest of that
[1:30:16] day to illusion but it was contrary to
[1:30:17] the word
[1:30:18] god said he would do it today how he'll
[1:30:20] restore all things
[1:30:22] he would restore exactly in joel 228 all
[1:30:24] the years the conquer woman and the
[1:30:25] caterpillar restore
[1:30:27] everything back to the church exactly
[1:30:30] what they had in the first place what
[1:30:32] are you saying i'm saying tongues have
[1:30:34] to come back
[1:30:35] prophecies have to come back
[1:30:36] interpretation of tongues have to come
[1:30:37] back gift of wisdom gift of healing
[1:30:39] every gift
[1:30:40] have to be back in the church
[1:30:41] [Applause]
[1:30:45] every year
[1:30:49] somebody records in tongues and somebody
[1:30:50] interpret giving warnings
[1:30:53] exposing people calling out sin whatever
[1:30:56] it is that could be back in the church
[1:30:57] then people could just walk in the
[1:30:59] building just any old hoe there was no
[1:31:01] goddess among those
[1:31:02] people hallelujah fires there it used to
[1:31:05] have been a long time you know
[1:31:08] amen oh yeah our tongue was an
[1:31:10] interpretation and whatnot i was in one
[1:31:12] meeting i was so scared
[1:31:14] i wasn't preaching that day i was
[1:31:16] abnormal believer winter service don't
[1:31:18] stop
[1:31:18] and brothers ministers said on the
[1:31:20] platform and man was preaching talking
[1:31:23] afterwards
[1:31:23] tongues come that interpretation will
[1:31:25] come and when god had exposed some
[1:31:26] things and said the ministers sit on the
[1:31:28] platform sitting down there faults
[1:31:30] i'm tilting over and over and i
[1:31:31] trembling shaking like a young believer
[1:31:35] go call them false only platform they
[1:31:39] say say make that a better
[1:31:41] spirit picking up is in people's lives
[1:31:43] and hearts
[1:31:46] the full operation in the church god can
[1:31:48] film in the world
[1:31:49] with signs wonders miracles gifts
[1:31:52] do you want to see that or just one of
[1:31:54] your words words words words words
[1:31:57] that is what you must want to see the
[1:31:59] living god
[1:32:00] [Applause]
[1:32:05] but when thunders was preached 1975
[1:32:08] every gift dry up
[1:32:11] that was a kind of mind-boggling thing
[1:32:13] called his brother some pentecostal
[1:32:14] church and open bible church and whatnot
[1:32:16] had gifts and signs and all kinds of
[1:32:17] things every sign everything wonders you
[1:32:19] know what he was doing trying to do
[1:32:20] get the gifts to identify every word was
[1:32:22] true and god just try it up
[1:32:30] the wood is above all those things so
[1:32:32] god bring the word to the people
[1:32:34] see they could take it then penn person
[1:32:36] who couldn't handle it they leave the
[1:32:37] message
[1:32:38] because they want that science to
[1:32:39] empower them and they don't understand
[1:32:42] that the message comes to bring
[1:32:43] character because character is what's
[1:32:45] going to positionally place you
[1:32:47] for genuine power what the pentecostal
[1:32:51] was a temporary power temporary blessing
[1:32:54] god couldn't use them because they
[1:32:56] didn't have the word
[1:32:57] to use the word in them he used men
[1:33:01] but the word come to the prophet and
[1:33:03] because they reject the prophet
[1:33:05] they reject the word so god just used
[1:33:07] men
[1:33:08] flesh and blood but he promised a bride
[1:33:11] that would be a true seed of the word a
[1:33:13] true bride of the word
[1:33:15] and in that prayer we'll have the word
[1:33:17] and we're going to use the word and the
[1:33:18] pride
[1:33:19] that is why the bride cannot fail it's
[1:33:22] not you he's using
[1:33:23] you are not even the believer the
[1:33:26] believer is the word in you
[1:33:28] come unknown the lord i shout give the
[1:33:30] lord i
[1:33:31] shout you are not the believer
[1:33:34] the believer is the word in you god put
[1:33:37] something in you
[1:33:38] when before the foundation of the world
[1:33:41] [Applause]
[1:33:45] glory do you understand that
[1:33:48] god put it in you before you fail before
[1:33:51] your fault while you're messed up
[1:33:53] if god was running your business based
[1:33:55] upon failure none was going to make it
[1:33:56] because all have sinned and come short
[1:33:59] of the glory of god
[1:34:01] do you get that oh not some all
[1:34:05] right so don't come with me just sit on
[1:34:08] my nest in all this sin
[1:34:09] all have come short of the glory of god
[1:34:12] hallelujah so god richard mercy
[1:34:15] drop down blood dropping a covenant
[1:34:18] unconditional covenant
[1:34:20] to redeem you regardless blood speaking
[1:34:23] on your behalf
[1:34:24] my god the blood following you wherever
[1:34:27] you go
[1:34:28] that blood coming the book of redemption
[1:34:30] wherever you go blood following you
[1:34:32] the blood have to cover you and the
[1:34:34] spirit follows the blood
[1:34:35] because the life of the blood is the
[1:34:37] spirit so the spirit is upon you
[1:34:39] through the blood the blood is the word
[1:34:42] when the word is preached
[1:34:43] blood is on you blood is over you that
[1:34:46] will turn the spirit
[1:34:48] spirit upon you oh lord give the lord a
[1:34:50] shout
[1:34:51] oh hallelujah glory to god
[1:34:56] and once again in the spirit in the
[1:34:58] spirit there is power
[1:34:59] in the spirit as victory in the spirit
[1:35:01] is overcoming power
[1:35:03] samson was in the spirit those brothers
[1:35:05] live in the spirit
[1:35:06] that's why they were one with god they
[1:35:08] were in the spirit
[1:35:10] nothing could stop them or give the lord
[1:35:12] a shout in the house
[1:35:18] you cannot fix natural condition with
[1:35:20] spiritual things
[1:35:22] you cannot fix spiritual condition with
[1:35:23] natural things however the bible says
[1:35:25] i'm
[1:35:26] hungry you can't call me be filled with
[1:35:28] the holy ghost

[1:35:39] spirit give me a spirit spirit with
[1:35:41] naked
[1:35:42] you need clothes yes yes i'm saying that
[1:35:45] so you have to deal with what the needs
[1:35:46] are
[1:35:47] so for spiritual condition you need
[1:35:49] spiritual medicine
[1:35:50] spiritual attention and you have
[1:35:52] conditions here
[1:35:53] natural things can help you a new car
[1:35:56] new house
[1:35:57] that will fade so fast in front of your
[1:35:58] face and you just have new installments
[1:36:03] but that wouldn't solve your spiritual
[1:36:05] issue
[1:36:06] are you with me now your spiritual issue
[1:36:09] needs to be dealt
[1:36:10] with and that's where the surgeon
[1:36:12] general knife

[1:36:29] was what was in him you know
[1:36:30] it was his confidence it was his
[1:36:32] revelation of god
[1:36:34] it was his revelation of the experience
[1:36:37] on the backside of the desert
[1:36:39] [Applause]
[1:36:46] you can't go very far without an
[1:36:47] experience

[1:36:52] the experience of what kept me all these
[1:36:54] years you cannot go very far without an
[1:36:57] experience with god
[1:37:00] you need to confront that pillar of fire
[1:37:03] you need to get into the presence of the
[1:37:05] pillar of fire
[1:37:06] where you know god is a reality now

[1:40:20] my god i feel inspired this morning so
[1:40:23] paul said the scripture we read
[1:40:24] he said when i come among you i come in
[1:40:26] trembling
[1:40:27] i come in weakness i come in fear or
[1:40:30] that my preaching
[1:40:32] will be a certain way i don't want to
[1:40:34] come with the wisdom
[1:40:35] that you say oh god he really wise he's
[1:40:38] a smart man
[1:40:39] he's an intelligent man he's a man with
[1:40:41] a lot of deep mysteries
[1:40:42] of course i ain't come with that i come
[1:40:44] with a word of power
[1:40:45] that your faith may not rest in the
[1:40:48] wisdom of what i'm preaching
[1:40:50] but in power of god
[1:40:55] so paul's objective was to lock them
[1:40:58] into the power of god
[1:41:00] this paul go with you when they go back
[1:41:02] home this poor is available
[1:41:04] you are one as a majority in god when

[1:41:16] let god come down let god say to you i
[1:41:19] have heard the cries of my people

[1:45:06] hallelujah
[1:45:07] what's this threefold mystery for god to
[1:45:10] reveal himself
[1:45:11] one two for christ of the preeminences
[1:45:13] three
[1:45:14] to restore back eden it's simple what's
[1:45:17] complicated about her
[1:45:19] that preeminences had a deeper
[1:45:22] revelation
[1:45:23] of seven steps of life coming into you
[1:45:26] by those virtues
[1:45:27] that god could have the i'm going to get
[1:45:30] into it
[1:45:30] oh praise the lord i won't give it too
[1:45:32] long when you go to the next country
[1:45:34] you need to change your money you go to
[1:45:36] america your car go and use tt dollars
[1:45:39] nobody ain't buying that let it go to
[1:45:41] the blue dishon
[1:45:43] get the money change and come back with
[1:45:45] your us dollars
[1:45:46] then we could talk because that's the
[1:45:48] currency limit
[1:45:50] we'll have another currency and that
[1:45:58] currency
[1:45:59] i want to say is virtues
[1:46:04] so we're going to say something this
[1:46:05] morning all the mysteries all this stuff
[1:46:08] had to be converted to virtues
[1:46:13] so paul said do i speak with tons of men
[1:46:15] and angels do i
[1:46:17] have faith to move mountains do i give
[1:46:20] my body to be burned
[1:46:21] do i know all mysteries that i don't
[1:46:23] have charity i
[1:46:24] have zero nada not nothing waste of time
[1:46:29] oh glory to god so what are you saying
[1:46:31] every mystery
[1:46:32] every revelation every secret thing and
[1:46:35] mystery thing and
[1:46:37] it has to convert into something that
[1:46:41] god could recognize
[1:46:42] as a currency of heaven that give
[1:46:45] purchase and power
[1:46:46] to those who have it
[1:46:48] [Applause]
[1:46:50] in other words the golden rule what's
[1:46:53] the golden rule
[1:46:55] you have the gold rules yes that's my
[1:46:58] interpretation of it
[1:46:59] that goal is character
[1:47:01] [Applause]
[1:47:05] goal we'll rule oh my
[1:47:10] oh my let's get down here where are we
[1:47:12] going good
[1:47:13] my my my my my you know
[1:47:17] unexpected this morning right you wanna
[1:47:20] in the same boat
[1:47:25] oh my lord this time just relax just
[1:47:27] relax and i'm very relaxed
[1:47:28] that is so good oh my
[1:47:32] lord is an age but i know that works
[1:47:34] neither hot no cold
[1:47:36] i would have had no cold so then because
[1:47:37] i would look warm neither hot and cold
[1:47:39] i spilled my mouth oh this is the risk
[1:47:42] for christianity now
[1:47:44] look warm yeah cold call me you're dead
[1:47:47] you're not hot you're not on fire you're
[1:47:49] just in between
[1:47:51] lukewarm commentaries lukewarm
[1:47:54] lukewarm demands a penalty from god
[1:47:58] so when natural people say hey they come
[1:48:00] to church god's saying
[1:48:02] does it change
[1:48:12] he wants your passion to know the word
[1:48:14] he wants you
[1:48:15] cry to get in the spirit he wants the
[1:48:17] fifth and he's out to please him
[1:48:19] that's what he wants from you and only
[1:48:20] you could give him that
[1:48:22] they're not family things that is you
[1:48:25] that's not what your husband doing i'm
[1:48:27] gonna do with that people make excuses
[1:48:29] people do what they wanna do
[1:48:32] if you want to come here and sleep you
[1:48:33] could come here and sleep
[1:48:38] yeah you can relax in heaven and just
[1:48:40] doze
[1:48:41] like you just come for a dozen sessions
[1:48:46] sister news for the news
[1:48:50] if you want to be on fire you could be
[1:48:52] [Applause]
[1:48:55] at that time in services i'd be a little
[1:48:57] tired and untimely
[1:48:58] i would stand up bite my nail whatever
[1:49:00] it is
[1:49:01] bite my finger beat the huh sometimes i
[1:49:04] drive in any states
[1:49:06] sleepy but i have to do something
[1:49:10] see i know you have some biscuits you
[1:49:11] have a sweetie or something something
[1:49:13] why because i have to stay in my eyes on
[1:49:15] the road
[1:49:17] so if you want to be on fire you've been
[1:49:19] far you want the pressure way you could
[1:49:21] press your weight
[1:49:22] you want to achieve you can achieve as a
[1:49:24] man thinking in his heart
[1:49:25] so is he oh glory to god i am seeing
[1:49:29] breakthrough after breakthrough after
[1:49:31] breakthrough
[1:49:32] oh yes i'm seeing people lining up to
[1:49:33] come into the church
[1:49:35] yes i'm seeing the sick being healed i
[1:49:37] see in prayer lines spread lines prayer
[1:49:39] lines
[1:49:40] i see in service come a double portion
[1:49:42] afterwards service then prayer line
[1:49:45] service and walking service then
[1:49:47] the dead speaking
[1:49:48] the deaf speak the deaf hearing the dom
[1:49:51] speaking service after service
[1:49:53] people hearing the testimony of god
[1:49:55] among those people
[1:49:56] with signs and wonders and miracles why
[1:49:58] are you saying about all of it because
[1:49:59] there's a prophecy
[1:50:00] i'll ride this trail once more but
[1:50:03] didn't say that
[1:50:05] the holy ghost in him said that
[1:50:08] the holy ghost said i will ride the
[1:50:10] trail
[1:50:11] once more tell me one more ride
[1:50:14] the holy ghost is the white horse rider
[1:50:17] he's going to mount a bride
[1:50:19] there's going to be a power strike the
[1:50:20] church that's prophecy
[1:50:23] no devil could stop it somebody gonna
[1:50:25] connect with it
[1:50:26] somebody's gonna raise up and spare and
[1:50:29] because the secret thing belongs to god
[1:50:31] but everything that has been revealed
[1:50:34] belongs to us
[1:50:36] oh glory to god the holy spirit
[1:50:39] told that prophet pick up your pen and
[1:50:41] write he said our church will be a super
[1:50:44] church
[1:50:45] actually nears the headstone or glory
[1:50:47] that goes to every day
[1:50:49] as we get closer as we get closer more
[1:50:52] power
[1:50:53] more revelation more anointing more
[1:50:55] witness of the spirit
[1:50:57] it's got to be that way i refuse
[1:50:59] otherwise
[1:51:01] oh glory to god the timer lingering
[1:51:04] is almost over
[1:51:06] [Applause]
[1:51:13] you may be seated after iran with 25
[1:51:16] years
[1:51:17] don't come on manifestation tell him i
[1:51:20] will return unto d
[1:51:21] a quantity time of life there's still a
[1:51:23] time of life i come to remind you
[1:51:25] your 25 years is not wasted i come to
[1:51:27] remind you your years believe in this
[1:51:29] message is not wasted
[1:51:30] i come to remind you that time is at
[1:51:32] hand for sarah to conceive
[1:51:35] the time is at hand from mary to produce
[1:51:37] messiah you haven't wasted your faith
[1:51:39] you haven't believed cannon device
[1:51:41] fables no no no no no you're going to be
[1:51:43] activated
[1:51:44] or go in the word and you're going to
[1:51:45] come alive the wording you will be
[1:51:47] manifested
[1:51:49] oh glory to god amen hallelujah
[1:51:53] so abraham said lukewarmness demands a
[1:51:55] penalty from god
[1:51:56] the penalties that they be spilled out
[1:51:58] of his mouth here we don't want to go
[1:52:00] astray folks
[1:52:01] they very unwisely see that god can spew
[1:52:04] you out of his mouth
[1:52:05] and that proves there's no such thing as
[1:52:07] any truth of the doctrine of in
[1:52:08] our sins
[1:52:09] i want to correct you thinking right now
[1:52:11] this first
[1:52:12] is not given to an individual it is
[1:52:15] given to the church
[1:52:16] he's talking to the church furthermore
[1:52:18] if you want to keep the word in mind
[1:52:19] you'll recall nowhere does it say that
[1:52:22] we are the mount of god
[1:52:23] we are engraved on his palms we are
[1:52:25] carried in his bosom
[1:52:26] way back in the unknown ages before time
[1:52:28] we were in his mind
[1:52:29] we are in a sheepfold in his pastures
[1:52:31] but never in his mouth
[1:52:32] but what is in the mouth of the lord the
[1:52:35] word in his mouth
[1:52:37] oh hallelujah for prophecy came not in
[1:52:40] all time by the will of man
[1:52:41] but holy men of god speak as they were
[1:52:43] moved by the holy ghost
[1:52:45] so what is wrong with these people in
[1:52:46] the last day they have gotten away from
[1:52:48] the word
[1:52:49] they are no longer fervent about it they
[1:52:52] are lukewarm about
[1:52:54] it the baptists have their crease and
[1:52:56] dogmas based on the word and they can't
[1:52:57] shake them
[1:52:58] they say their possibilities and
[1:52:59] miracles are over there's no baptism in
[1:53:00] the holy ghost
[1:53:01] subsequently to believe in and the
[1:53:02] messengers have their stuff all them
[1:53:04] claim the doctrine to be word-based
[1:53:06] sometimes they strain to find anything
[1:53:07] anything to fit their doctrine
[1:53:09] they put the doctrine first and then
[1:53:10] trying to fit it
[1:53:15] they will sell out the word for
[1:53:16] sensation about every time if
[1:53:19] they can produce a manifestation like
[1:53:20] oil blood tongues and other signs
[1:53:22] whether it's word or not whether
[1:53:24] properly interpreted from the word
[1:53:25] the majority will fall for it the word
[1:53:28] god says here we go
[1:53:29] i am going against you all i will spew
[1:53:32] out of my mouth
[1:53:33] this is the end for seven out of seven
[1:53:36] ages
[1:53:36] i have seen nothing but men esteeming
[1:53:39] their own word
[1:53:40] above mind so at the end of this age i'm
[1:53:43] spinning out of my mouth it is all over
[1:53:45] i'm going to speak all right i'm here in
[1:53:47] the midst of the church the amen of god
[1:53:49] the faithful
[1:53:50] and it will be by my prophet then he
[1:53:52] quote russian 10 seven and this is the
[1:53:53] voice
[1:53:54] seven angel there it is he is sending a
[1:53:56] vindicated prophet
[1:53:57] he's selling a prophet almost two
[1:54:00] thousand years
[1:54:01] he is sending someone who is so far from
[1:54:02] organization education
[1:54:04] religion this prophet will turn the
[1:54:06] heart of the children back to the
[1:54:08] fathers
[1:54:09] listen to this he will bring back the
[1:54:11] elect of the last day
[1:54:13] and they will hear a vindicated prophet
[1:54:16] give the exact truth as it was with paul
[1:54:19] he will restore the truth as they had it
[1:54:21] and those elect with him
[1:54:24] will be the ones who will truly manifest
[1:54:27] the lord
[1:54:28] and be his body and be his voice
[1:54:31] and perform his works who is that the
[1:54:33] elect with him
[1:54:35] hallelujah a momentary consideration of
[1:54:37] churches she will prove
[1:54:39] in the dark ages the word was entirely
[1:54:41] lost to the people
[1:54:42] but god sent luther with the word
[1:54:44] lutheran spoke for god at that time
[1:54:46] at that time and watch but they organize
[1:54:50] again the pure word was lost for
[1:54:53] organization
[1:54:53] tends towards dogma and creed are not
[1:54:56] simple word
[1:54:57] shout out simple word simple word
[1:55:00] has to be able to be made plain to the
[1:55:03] people not complex
[1:55:05] because once it comes into complexities
[1:55:06] like telling ghana long time
[1:55:08] the priest used to say the whole mass in
[1:55:10] latin
[1:55:12] so the people just sit down there and he
[1:55:13] was secular said
[1:55:15] man he does meet me with the hands and
[1:55:18] they go home
[1:55:19] then they convert the latin to english
[1:55:21] but the people sitting there in this
[1:55:22] catholic and they they have a clue
[1:55:24] they demand cursing in the words they
[1:55:26] have no clue whatsoever
[1:55:27] he is speaking a different language the
[1:55:29] whole thing
[1:55:31] he's speaking mysteries another language
[1:55:33] god doesn't want that
[1:55:35] one time afterwards he has stopped
[1:55:36] talking parables he said lord don't
[1:55:37] speak us now plainly
[1:55:40] because he's speaking parables to tie up
[1:55:42] some of them
[1:55:43] but he's beginning to break of the
[1:55:44] disciples he is talking a certain way
[1:55:47] but then he begin to bring it clear to
[1:55:49] them because the mystery
[1:55:50] has to be made clear what you're about
[1:55:53] to receive
[1:55:54] that's why the bible said he opened the
[1:55:55] understanding to the scriptures
[1:55:57] and opened the word to them that they
[1:55:59] could go in the upper room without any
[1:56:00] doubt
[1:56:01] that this promises minds this holy ghost
[1:56:04] is minds
[1:56:05] i'm going to be filled behold i send the
[1:56:07] promise of my father upon you
[1:56:09] but parry you'll see jerusalem until you
[1:56:11] be endured with power from on high
[1:56:14] there ain't no power on coming sideways
[1:56:16] from on high
[1:56:17] buttons come on below from an eye no
[1:56:20] manner bringing no power
[1:56:21] from one eye that's a
[1:56:24] [Applause]
[1:56:27] and the weird said when the day of
[1:56:29] pentecost was fully come
[1:56:31] and like those words fully come they
[1:56:34] were in one mind
[1:56:35] they were in one accord they were
[1:56:37] praising as normal but all of a sudden
[1:56:39] something happened russian mighty wind
[1:56:42] fill all the old house
[1:56:43] terror fire divide itself give each
[1:56:46] everybody a portion
[1:56:57] what abraham says the church is no
[1:56:58] longer the more peace of god
[1:57:00] this is one more peace so god is still
[1:57:03] in her
[1:57:04] and who the church god is doing that
[1:57:07] oh yes he will confound her through the
[1:57:10] prophet and the bride
[1:57:11] for the voice of god will be in her in
[1:57:14] the last day
[1:57:15] the spirit and the bride say come
[1:57:17] version 2017. let's go
[1:57:20] once more the world will hear direct
[1:57:22] from god
[1:57:23] at that pentecost but of course that
[1:57:25] would buy will be represented as in the
[1:57:27] first age
[1:57:27] no he has cried out to this age you have
[1:57:29] heard you have the word
[1:57:30] you have more bibles than ever but you
[1:57:33] are not doing anything about the word
[1:57:35] except dividing and hacking it into
[1:57:37] pieces taking what you want
[1:57:39] leaving out what you want you are not
[1:57:41] interested in living it
[1:57:43] but debating it i would sooner you'll be
[1:57:45] hot or cold
[1:57:46] if you were cold and rejected i could
[1:57:47] stand that if you could get white heart
[1:57:49] to know it's true and live it
[1:57:50] i would praise you for that but because
[1:57:52] you simply take my word and don't honor
[1:57:53] it
[1:57:54] i will spew you out of my mind oh my
[1:57:57] god let's take a little more to him that
[1:58:00] overcome it
[1:58:00] well i granted him my throne now what
[1:58:03] are we to overcome
[1:58:04] that's the normal question to ask but
[1:58:06] that is not the actual
[1:58:07] thought in this verse it's not so much
[1:58:10] what
[1:58:10] we have to overcome but how
[1:58:15] but now this is logical for it doesn't
[1:58:17] matter what we have to overcome as long
[1:58:19] as you know how we can overcome
[1:58:21] a quick look at the scripture but jesus
[1:58:23] overcome devil the temptation by the
[1:58:25] word is written we know that
[1:58:27] watch adam fell in direct disobedience
[1:58:30] to the word
[1:58:31] but jesus overcame by the word and right
[1:58:34] now
[1:58:35] let me say this is the only way to be
[1:58:37] overcomer
[1:58:38] is the only way you can know if you're
[1:58:40] overcoming
[1:58:41] because that word can't fail you have to
[1:58:44] be able to overcome by the word
[1:58:47] because god said it you're standing by
[1:58:49] it god said it you're staying with it
[1:58:52] you say if you have a doubt in your mind
[1:58:54] don't do it and you know you're right
[1:58:56] should i say i said i should i don't do
[1:58:58] it you're right
[1:58:59] staying with the world oh my
[1:59:02] gosh so brother branham says watch he
[1:59:05] constantly apply the word jesus
[1:59:07] he spake only what the father gave him
[1:59:08] to speak there was not a time when the
[1:59:10] world
[1:59:11] was not utterly confused by his wisdom
[1:59:13] because it was the wisdom of god
[1:59:15] in his personal life
[1:59:18] contending with himself this is big
[1:59:21] this is huge now this is jesus are you
[1:59:24] with me
[1:59:25] in his personal life contending with
[1:59:29] himself
[1:59:31] he overcame by obedience
[1:59:34] to the word of god amen hebrews 11 says
[1:59:37] who in the days of his flesh
[1:59:39] when he had offered up prayers and
[1:59:41] supplication
[1:59:42] with strong crying and tears to him that
[1:59:45] was able to save him from death
[1:59:47] and it was heard and i was heard that he
[1:59:49] feared though
[1:59:50] he was a son yet he learned
[1:59:54] obedience by the team that he suffered i
[1:59:56] know you hear that
[1:59:58] you hear that intellectually because you
[2:00:01] have started to suffer yet
[2:00:03] you only get his stuff and you you've
[2:00:06] done faith already
[2:00:08] it's suffer not stuff
[2:00:12] sometimes he suffered before he come
[2:00:14] here
[2:00:15] by by he learned obedience
[2:00:18] so so see when we finish this service
[2:00:20] here nobody should complain
[2:00:24] if the roof falls along you fix it you
[2:00:26] are too flat tired fix it
[2:00:28] this happen fix it do something about
[2:00:31] each other work your ship get wrecked
[2:00:33] keep swimming don't get up and drown you
[2:00:37] that's what i'm saying but you see
[2:00:38] people feeling entitled what if paul
[2:00:40] said you're entitled lord god don't know
[2:00:42] us i'm not a porcelain a prophet to the
[2:00:44] gentiles
[2:00:45] this not supposed to happen to me
[2:00:48] what will the people think swim paul
[2:00:50] swim
[2:00:52] that's right
[2:00:55] [Music]
[2:00:57] [Applause]
[2:00:57] [Music]
[2:01:03] paul will be bowling because he'll be
[2:01:06] drowning
[2:01:07] other day paul shipwreck with everybody
[2:01:08] else had to fight up
[2:01:10] pull things off the shore get wood light
[2:01:14] fire
[2:01:14] and all of a sudden a snake bite him now
[2:01:17] everybody know that sneaking
[2:01:19] that snake don't make joke in one minute
[2:01:22] you're gone
[2:01:23] and paul just shake off the snake and
[2:01:25] continue anybody looking content ten
[2:01:28] nine eight seven
[2:01:32] six five four three two one
[2:01:35] and they seem still standing paul said
[2:01:38] jesus thinks i'll bite them and shall
[2:01:42] not hurt them
[2:01:43] we we snake proof
[2:01:48] that amen song a week it had a man used
[2:01:50] to bring snakes unless snake
[2:01:51] bite tried to bite him and was protected
[2:01:53] until you know he eventually just asleep
[2:01:55] by them
[2:01:57] but he was trying to prove what god say
[2:02:00] i'm not doing that
[2:02:01] i say his job if you want to do that
[2:02:03] let's feel free to go and do that but my
[2:02:04] point is this
[2:02:05] god proved himself paul being
[2:02:08] shipwrecked
[2:02:09] before we know all things work together
[2:02:13] for good to them that love god even when
[2:02:15] you ship wreck
[2:02:17] when your marriage wreck when you're
[2:02:19] home wrecked when this happened and that
[2:02:21] happened
[2:02:21] even oak where you're shouting the house
[2:02:28] what was jesus obedient to the word of
[2:02:31] god
[2:02:32] then there will be not be one person
[2:02:34] there will not be
[2:02:35] one person who will sit on the throne of
[2:02:38] jesus christ
[2:02:39] unless he has been living that word
[2:02:42] your prayers your fasting your
[2:02:45] repentances
[2:02:46] no matter what you present to god will
[2:02:48] not gain you the privilege of sitting on
[2:02:50] that throne
[2:02:51] it will be granted only to the word
[2:02:53] bride as the throne is shared
[2:02:56] with the queen understand this
[2:02:59] fasting is not obedient fasting is part
[2:03:01] of what you do
[2:03:02] but that is not what if god tells you
[2:03:04] something and you fast sin faster god
[2:03:05] said pick up that people from there
[2:03:06] you're fasting you're fasting
[2:03:07] god say pick up the people from there
[2:03:09] until you pick up the paper you're
[2:03:10] fascinated as reason diana
[2:03:12] go you want a fast pick on the paper
[2:03:17] you follow what god's saying this word
[2:03:19] husband love your wife that's the word
[2:03:22] i didn't put that there you know
[2:03:25] somebody
[2:03:26] when you're preaching the feeling preach
[2:03:27] up with the picture right he said you
[2:03:28] know i didn't put it there
[2:03:30] wife obey her husband i didn't i didn't
[2:03:31] write that the bible right there
[2:03:34] sharing obey your parents the bible put
[2:03:36] that in oh hallelujah
[2:03:38] all right let's go i know home stretch
[2:03:41] now the burden of the word of the lord
[2:03:43] to israel by malachi i have loved you
[2:03:45] see other lord yet you say where have
[2:03:47] you loved us
[2:03:48] watch they could not figure out god's
[2:03:52] love
[2:03:53] they thought that love meant no
[2:03:56] suffering
[2:03:57] they thought that love meant baby
[2:04:01] with parental care but god
[2:04:04] said his love was elective love
[2:04:08] the proof of his love is election that
[2:04:10] no matter what happened
[2:04:12] his love was proven truly by the fact
[2:04:14] that they were chosen on salvation
[2:04:16] because god had chosen you to salvation
[2:04:18] through the signification of spirit
[2:04:20] and belief of the truth he may become he
[2:04:23] may commit you to death
[2:04:24] as he did paul he may commit you to
[2:04:27] suffering there's no email on that one
[2:04:29] but it's still the word so we say amen
[2:04:31] anyhow that don't mean you're going
[2:04:32] undead
[2:04:34] you're just saying amen to the truth
[2:04:37] i'll say it again
[2:04:38] just to get a little confirmation he may
[2:04:41] commit you to suffering as he did job
[2:04:43] he may commit to the debt as he did paul
[2:04:46] that is his prerogative
[2:04:47] he is suffering
[2:04:49] [Applause]
[2:04:51] but it is all with a purpose
[2:04:54] if he did not have a purpose
[2:04:58] then he would be the order of
[2:05:00] frustration
[2:05:01] and not peace so god is not the author
[2:05:04] who got frustrated i'm frustrated yeah
[2:05:06] you frustrated
[2:05:07] god's not ordered that you fighting
[2:05:10] obedience
[2:05:11] you fighting humbling yourself because
[2:05:13] if you humbly yourself to the word of
[2:05:14] god
[2:05:15] you will know all things work together
[2:05:18] for good say if you want this and god
[2:05:21] said not no
[2:05:22] you want me vex with god and you're
[2:05:24] angry with this one and hungry with that
[2:05:25] one
[2:05:25] no you're going to believe that god
[2:05:27] knows why you're not getting now
[2:05:33] [Music]
[2:05:44] he's six years old the blade is enough
[2:05:46] for him
[2:05:48] the thing that could shade the father
[2:05:49] face now could cut him and damage him
[2:05:51] so god has to protect that ma that
[2:05:52] little guy from that shaving blade
[2:05:55] you know that's how i'm saying that so
[2:05:56] clone time whatever protect you from
[2:05:58] things that you don't even know
[2:05:59] will be indigenous to your own life so
[2:06:02] you just have to bless god and thank him
[2:06:03] for his mercy
[2:06:04] for things seen and unseen jesus you're
[2:06:06] not even aware of
[2:06:08] traps of the devil sneers from the enemy
[2:06:11] that put before you to trap you and to
[2:06:13] sneer you and god hand upon your life
[2:06:16] in the spirit realm you're not even

[2:11:40] short window to get the bus to take

[2:11:43] because i want to go home home england

[2:11:48] ghana is not my home i want to go home
[2:11:50] sweet home so i don't want to miss that
[2:11:52] plane for nothing
[2:11:54] so i am mr desperate
[2:11:58] so so help me god i was going on that
[2:11:59] bus i got on the bus

[2:12:04] mama i made it oh glory to god
[2:12:08] and there's another bus coming we call
[2:12:11] it the rapture express
[2:12:13] don't miss it make sure you're getting
[2:12:16] bored
[2:12:18] oh hallelujah make sure you get the
[2:12:20] token
[2:12:23] let me just make a rubber up here
[2:12:25] brother branham
[2:12:26] don't be a son he learned obi-wan i
[2:12:28] think he suffered james one two the four
[2:12:30] counted all joy
[2:12:31] when you fall in the divers temptation
[2:12:33] but that's the revolution by itself
[2:12:36] knowing this that the trying of your
[2:12:38] faithful patience
[2:12:39] that patients have a perfect work that
[2:12:41] you may be perfect and entire
[2:12:43] wanted nothing for i reckon that the
[2:12:45] suffering of this present time here we
[2:12:47] go
[2:12:47] it's not worthy to be compared with the
[2:12:50] glory
[2:12:51] which shall be revealed in us glory
[2:12:54] listen this unless we suffer with him
[2:12:59] we cannot reign with him amen you have
[2:13:01] to suffer the rain
[2:13:04] that should be a message right there you
[2:13:05] know there's a title sometimes i'm going
[2:13:07] to preach that one
[2:13:08] the other suffer the rain the reason for
[2:13:10] this is the reason there's a reason
[2:13:12] the reason character simply is never
[2:13:15] made without suffering
[2:13:16] amen that's why it's painful
[2:13:20] to see poor parenting and people spoil
[2:13:23] their children to death
[2:13:26] i've seen it is a painful thing mothers
[2:13:28] destroy sons
[2:13:30] destroy their own family by their
[2:13:32] behavior
[2:13:34] by their conduct by the operation
[2:13:37] by refusing to be the kind of example
[2:13:40] that the children could see
[2:13:42] and reflect and when their time comes
[2:13:44] they ruin their marriages and their
[2:13:46] homes and their lives
[2:13:49] and all the name of you love your child
[2:13:51] yeah you spoil your child
[2:13:53] if you only look how god handles his
[2:13:54] children and you try to emulate how god
[2:13:57] does that
[2:13:58] you'll be a whole different bald game
[2:13:59] altogether oh yes
[2:14:02] all right let's go character
[2:14:05] is simply never made without suffering
[2:14:08] character is a victory not a gift
[2:14:10] a man without character cannot reign
[2:14:15] because power apart from character is
[2:14:17] satanic
[2:14:18] so when i see brothers ministers lying
[2:14:20] and deceitful and underhand and
[2:14:22] corrupt or whatever it is i know they're
[2:14:24] not adoption for them
[2:14:26] they have no adoption for that oh it has
[2:14:29] power yes
[2:14:30] temporary power people power people love
[2:14:32] your power
[2:14:33] um convention power and whatnot that's
[2:14:35] fine microphone power
[2:14:40] but not power with god not not jesus a
[2:14:43] man approved
[2:14:44] of god not that that can't come like
[2:14:47] that
[2:14:47] that has to be the right behavior but
[2:14:50] ram use the term the right
[2:14:52] kind of a son not sun
[2:14:55] right kind of it have plenty of
[2:14:57] different mangos you know
[2:14:59] oh here they are mangoes and mangoes the
[2:15:01] kind of mango
[2:15:03] you have plenty sons kind of sons you
[2:15:06] are the right kind
[2:15:08] and your behavior set you up to be the
[2:15:10] kind
[2:15:11] not your mysteries not your revelations
[2:15:14] you have to convert that
[2:15:16] into behavior you have to convert all
[2:15:19] the revelations
[2:15:20] into a behavior which is a life and
[2:15:23] that is what going to shake the devil up
[2:15:25] amen oh glory to god
[2:15:28] a man without character can reign
[2:15:30] because power apart from karate is
[2:15:32] satanic
[2:15:32] but power with characters for to rule
[2:15:34] and since he wanted to share
[2:15:36] even his throne on the same basis that
[2:15:38] he overcame and settling in his father's
[2:15:40] throne
[2:15:40] then we have to overcome to sit with him
[2:15:43] and the
[2:15:43] little temporary suffering we go through
[2:15:47] now
[2:15:48] is not worthy to be compared to the
[2:15:51] tremendous glory
[2:15:52] that will be revealed in us when it
[2:15:55] comes
[2:15:56] oh what treasures are laid up for those
[2:15:58] who are willing to
[2:15:59] enter into his kingdom too much
[2:16:02] tribulation so the cloudy skies and
[2:16:05] storms of life
[2:16:06] are no signs of god disapproval neither
[2:16:08] the bright skies and still water signs
[2:16:10] of god's love and approval
[2:16:11] his approval of any of us is only in the
[2:16:14] beloved
[2:16:15] his love is elective which he had for us
[2:16:17] before the foundation of the world
[2:16:19] how does he love us yes how shall we
[2:16:21] know we shall know
[2:16:23] because he said so and manifest that he
[2:16:26] love us
[2:16:26] for he brought us to himself and give us
[2:16:28] his spirit
[2:16:29] placing us as sons how shall i prove my
[2:16:33] love to him
[2:16:33] are we ready everybody alive are we
[2:16:36] ready
[2:16:37] how shall i prove my love to him by
[2:16:40] conducting by believing what he said
[2:16:42] and by conducting myself with joy i
[2:16:45] miss the trials he in his wisdom
[2:16:49] are those come to pass that's how you
[2:16:52] prove back your love to god
[2:16:54] conducting yourself with joy believing
[2:16:56] what he said
[2:16:57] joy because of he and his wisdom send
[2:17:00] those things
[2:17:03] now friends many things the people do
[2:17:06] and say
[2:17:07] i am not the judge of people but i think
[2:17:10] any ministry or any demonstration of the
[2:17:13] spirit
[2:17:14] of god that can't be backed up in this
[2:17:17] bible
[2:17:17] i would leave it alone if anything that
[2:17:20] anyone says
[2:17:21] that isn't backed up by the scripture i
[2:17:24] couldn't go with it
[2:17:25] although i wouldn't say it wasn't god
[2:17:27] till i seen the fruits of it
[2:17:29] then i wouldn't say nothing about it
[2:17:31] i'll just let it go like that
[2:17:32] so that is just a little side ba on this
[2:17:35] whole thing
[2:17:36] oh i'll skip that skip that the prophets
[2:17:40] of the old testament
[2:17:41] or any time they live in the presence of
[2:17:42] god until they become with the word
[2:17:44] the message is the word itself now the
[2:17:46] holy spirit
[2:17:48] will not misbehave i'm almost done music
[2:17:50] will come please
[2:17:51] the holy spirit will not misbehave
[2:17:53] itself in one person
[2:17:54] and behave itself in another it will
[2:17:57] make here we go
[2:17:58] it will make each person come
[2:18:01] into its character because
[2:18:05] it's a spirit that leads you
[2:18:09] you are not all that natural and you
[2:18:10] think you know there's a spirit
[2:18:12] influence in your life
[2:18:16] whatever spirit it is there's something
[2:18:17] influenced in your life
[2:18:19] let's let's trust is the right influence
[2:18:22] but the holy spirit
[2:18:23] would bring each person into its
[2:18:25] character because it's a spirit that
[2:18:27] leaves you
[2:18:28] it makes you subject to its nature
[2:18:31] you don't bring it subject to your
[2:18:32] nature it makes
[2:18:34] you subject to its nature the holy
[2:18:36] spirit makes you live and
[2:18:38] love to do it how you love to give up
[2:18:39] the things of the world when the holy
[2:18:41] spirit comes
[2:18:42] in all right every word in the bible is
[2:18:46] god taught satan's seed form
[2:18:48] and if they receive into a human being
[2:18:50] and spoke by the same thought that
[2:18:51] materialized the bible
[2:18:52] it brings it to pass i'll skip that i'll
[2:18:55] skip that
[2:18:56] all right okay
[2:19:00] so brother bran i'm okay i'm getting
[2:19:02] there what am i talking about um
[2:19:05] each age god places two things into this
[2:19:07] church
[2:19:08] all right and showing that each
[2:19:11] individual that possess these qualities
[2:19:12] talk about the same virtues
[2:19:14] and this being this virtuous being
[2:19:17] is the church of god that's going to the
[2:19:19] rapture amen
[2:19:20] not this confession of mysteries no this
[2:19:23] being
[2:19:24] when it's completed is the church that's
[2:19:26] going to rapture
[2:19:28] okay are you with me hallelujah
[2:19:31] and this being when completed
[2:19:34] is a servant of god
[2:19:37] in the church of god that's going in the
[2:19:40] rapture
[2:19:41] so every minister have to complete that
[2:19:43] is being completed
[2:19:45] to go in the rapture you see when that
[2:19:47] big magnet come
[2:19:48] that magnet that rapture magnet i want
[2:19:50] you to look at it now
[2:19:52] the magnitude pickup cloth a magnet
[2:19:55] can't pick up wood
[2:19:57] so this rapture magnet could only pick
[2:19:59] up those virtues
[2:20:03] that magnet not coming for books and
[2:20:05] tips i have all but around books
[2:20:07] i have all brown tips you will stay with
[2:20:09] that for the tribulation
[2:20:10] with the books any tips that's not what
[2:20:13] the rapture is about
[2:20:14] he told
[2:20:17] that's part next part you have to
[2:20:19] display it
[2:20:20] apply it and display it display it
[2:20:22] everybody must see it
[2:20:24] remember in moses time take the blood
[2:20:26] and put it on your door post
[2:20:28] and this this this that when i see it
[2:20:32] i will pass over so there is something
[2:20:34] that must be displayed
[2:20:36] [Applause]
[2:20:38] not talked about
[2:20:41] i know pastors like to say your villain
[2:20:44] in mystery
[2:20:46] something manifesting yeah all right
[2:20:50] that sounds kind of good the
[2:20:53] manifestation is sons
[2:20:54] because they're revealing hidden
[2:20:56] mysteries but but remembering a lot of
[2:20:57] mysteries
[2:20:58] we can only echo what the prophecy ain't
[2:21:00] our mind reveal a mystery but i'm gonna
[2:21:02] be revealed you know that man off
[2:21:04] god they promised that it's almost one
[2:21:06] messenger
[2:21:07] to reveal every mystery that's why we
[2:21:10] could take the messenger and judge every
[2:21:11] minister
[2:21:12] you're not judging by his group you're
[2:21:13] judging my holy state with the word
[2:21:15] you can't judge me by my children you
[2:21:17] judge me oh i stay with the word that's
[2:21:18] the only way you authorize to judge me
[2:21:21] oh glory to god alone i'm on the word
[2:21:23] you can't take me off
[2:21:25] you can't take me out oh glory to god
[2:21:28] wants you on the word
[2:21:29] nobody can take you out hallelujah
[2:21:32] praise god amen
[2:21:34] glory so do you see it now
[2:21:37] all right it's maybe next week this is
[2:21:40] too much boy
[2:21:41] wow mamma mia we try to make
[2:21:44] weakness our excuses we want to tell how
[2:21:47] big we are how great we are
[2:21:49] and i think that's what god gave me this
[2:21:51] text for
[2:21:52] the little things that we do and we come
[2:21:54] to church is the fine way of false is
[2:21:56] that we can better ourselves
[2:21:58] we must come to find our weaknesses find
[2:22:01] our bad places
[2:22:02] and see how little we are and put our
[2:22:04] trust in somebody that's strong
[2:22:06] and the reason he chooses us when we say
[2:22:09] we are insufficient
[2:22:11] when we say uh i can't do it and you're
[2:22:13] feeling less down you're feeling
[2:22:14] unworthy you're feeling struggling
[2:22:17] he knows that and yet he choose you
[2:22:20] and he knows your spirit and your
[2:22:22] condition and he says the reason he
[2:22:24] chooses
[2:22:25] us because we're in that condition that
[2:22:28] sounds strange
[2:22:30] if god being willing we find out that
[2:22:32] weaknesses and rejections we find out
[2:22:35] that those people who are the weakest
[2:22:37] and rejected by the outside world is god
[2:22:40] heroes
[2:22:41] that's the conqueror in the front line
[2:22:44] those that feel himself unworthy
[2:22:46] i met his brother three of them they say
[2:22:48] but we just leave the holy ghost
[2:22:50] no should be saved gifts to the ministry
[2:22:52] i said don't do it
[2:22:53] let it alone he said because we need the
[2:22:56] holy ghost and we need gifts he said and
[2:22:57] become a stuffed shirt
[2:22:59] it is always those trying to get away
[2:23:01] from it he said don't seek nothing god
[2:23:02] got anything for you he'll give it to
[2:23:03] you
[2:23:04] notice it takes the weakest and rejected
[2:23:08] and practically every hero god ever had
[2:23:11] on the front line
[2:23:12] was that type of person a person that
[2:23:14] was rejected
[2:23:15] a person that thought he was
[2:23:16] insufficient a person that had no
[2:23:18] ability at all
[2:23:20] then that person is in good shape so god
[2:23:23] can start using them
[2:23:25] i have no ability lord i can't talk this
[2:23:27] like that good shape
[2:23:30] when we are thinking that we are able to
[2:23:32] do it god can't use us
[2:23:34] because we wanted to do ourselves now
[2:23:37] watch
[2:23:38] so the other side we get these feelings
[2:23:40] and we think that we're insufficient we
[2:23:41] don't want to do it
[2:23:42] and if we listen to the call of god
[2:23:44] that's the very thing that god wants us
[2:23:46] to do
[2:23:47] when we are so here we go this is a big
[2:23:49] thing
[2:23:50] when we are insufficient ourselves
[2:23:54] then we are subjects to yield to god's
[2:23:57] spirit
[2:23:58] as long as we think we can do it we
[2:24:01] can't do it
[2:24:02] when we get to a place where we know we
[2:24:04] can't do it then we
[2:24:05] yield ourselves to god and he does it if
[2:24:08] it's us trying to do it we'll fail
[2:24:11] but if we yield ourselves to god then
[2:24:13] god can fail
[2:24:14] that's one thing you can't do is fail
[2:24:17] the important thing
[2:24:18] one of the important thing we must
[2:24:20] master remember this
[2:24:22] especially you young preachers and only
[2:24:24] members alike there's one thing you've
[2:24:26] got to master
[2:24:27] if you expect to fulfill god's desire in
[2:24:29] our lives we have to master the thought
[2:24:31] of human ability
[2:24:32] if we get to a spot where we think we
[2:24:34] can do it with our own intelligence
[2:24:36] our own abilities we've got to master in
[2:24:39] such a way
[2:24:40] that we can get rid of the things as
[2:24:41] laid aside so god can use us
[2:24:44] and make a complete surrender to us
[2:24:47] no ability when we are expecting saying
[2:24:50] this guy is a great person
[2:24:51] this is a great person i lean on him
[2:24:53] that this peace is god
[2:24:54] so when a minister put himself as the
[2:24:56] lamppost as a pill any house
[2:24:58] lean on me god hates that
[2:25:02] it must be him it must be him working
[2:25:04] through the ministry
[2:25:06] it might be him and the man then you see
[2:25:08] god isn't that right
[2:25:09] no ability i don't care whose it is will
[2:25:11] ever be usable in the sight of god god
[2:25:13] has to get all our abilities out of us
[2:25:15] before he can achieve his purpose he's
[2:25:17] got something for us to do
[2:25:18] as long as we feel we're doing a pretty
[2:25:20] good job he'll never be the use of god
[2:25:22] we have got together from human ability
[2:25:24] we have got to get to a place where we
[2:25:25] can surrender our souls lives
[2:25:27] even to the housewife to the farmer to
[2:25:29] the mechanic whosoever we are we gotta
[2:25:31] surrender completely
[2:25:32] to god knowing we are nothing and then
[2:25:34] god starts from there
[2:25:35] he starts moving working that includes
[2:25:38] all
[2:25:39] of us oh my god but abraham said the
[2:25:42] reason
[2:25:43] that paul was fearing is not because he
[2:25:45] was scared of anything but he was scared
[2:25:47] he would displease god in some way and
[2:25:50] he will get his own ability mixed up
[2:25:52] into it
[2:25:53] so he said i didn't come with excellence
[2:25:54] of speech i come to you in fear
[2:25:56] that and so forth i come to know only
[2:25:59] christ and
[2:25:59] him crucified the greatest enemy i got
[2:26:02] is william branham
[2:26:03] he's the one that gets in god's way he's
[2:26:05] the one that gets lazy he's the one who
[2:26:07] gets to a place sometime where he thinks
[2:26:08] he can do something about it
[2:26:09] and when he does that sure has got out
[2:26:11] the picture but when i can get rid of
[2:26:13] that guy
[2:26:14] then i could get to a place he's out of
[2:26:16] the way then god can come over
[2:26:17] and do things william branham knows
[2:26:20] nothing about
[2:26:21] how many ministers could god use this
[2:26:23] morning if they only let god bind them
[2:26:25] with his word
[2:26:26] with his power and lose them from the
[2:26:28] strength of their denomination and
[2:26:30] organization
[2:26:30] how many sins are people in the city
[2:26:32] this morning that goes to these great
[2:26:34] organization churches how many could
[2:26:35] fill with the holy ghost set this
[2:26:36] country of fire
[2:26:37] with the gospel and the power if they
[2:26:39] only take and lose themselves from the
[2:26:41] power that they have
[2:26:42] and be bound to the spirit power that
[2:26:45] paul had
[2:26:47] moses realized look i'm almost done
[2:26:51] i know i keep saying that but almost
[2:26:54] done
[2:26:55] moses realized god took him back to the
[2:26:58] wilderness to learn some human
[2:27:00] weaknesses
[2:27:02] the prince principles
[2:27:05] your custom being really managed in
[2:27:08] egypt i mean
[2:27:09] carpet rule for him they pour out his
[2:27:11] right hand ruling
[2:27:12] sorry he took him back to learn what
[2:27:16] it's all about
[2:27:16] so he and where where did he learn did
[2:27:19] he get a lesson
[2:27:20] god must have had a time with him back
[2:27:22] there mother had a temper
[2:27:24] and god gave my wife my name is japo she
[2:27:26] had won two
[2:27:27] so i imagine things wasn't so pleasing
[2:27:29] back on the back side it does it for a
[2:27:30] while
[2:27:31] when both of the temper gets out of the
[2:27:33] control at the same time
[2:27:34] i suppose his intellectual conception of
[2:27:36] whole psychology ought to control a
[2:27:38] person didn't do much good
[2:27:40] because he was because on his way down
[2:27:42] to egypt she said in the temple she said
[2:27:44] you're a bloody husband to me
[2:27:45] god was so angry that he'd look him at
[2:27:47] the end and he could have found him
[2:27:48] behind mislead
[2:27:49] watch human weaknesses here we go will
[2:27:52] never be used of god
[2:27:54] this is the point god by
[2:27:58] human weaknesses pours himself into you
[2:28:02] and he uses himself you just become an
[2:28:05] instrument because you got yourself out
[2:28:08] of the way
[2:28:09] did god feel sorry for moses with all
[2:28:11] his weaknesses say paul and moses
[2:28:13] something sure has happened to you you
[2:28:15] fell from your degree
[2:28:17] yeah yeah yeah great intellectual
[2:28:19] brother you had your phd
[2:28:20] you are weak no god wasn't sorry for him
[2:28:24] god never took pity on him god had him
[2:28:26] cured of all that stuff
[2:28:29] and he wasn't sorry for him oh my
[2:28:32] 40 years out there i had you once a poor
[2:28:34] person kinda wrong in the wilderness
[2:28:36] where they could find out their human
[2:28:37] riches or not
[2:28:38] and then and so forth oh my
[2:28:42] god i think i want to read this one can
[2:28:44] i read something for you
[2:28:46] somebody tell barbara he's such a nice
[2:28:49] man and nice person i'm so happy for
[2:28:50] that
[2:28:51] um there's one thing one thing wrong
[2:28:53] what's that sister assistant
[2:28:55] one thing but that if you could just
[2:28:56] compromise with a little doctrine you
[2:28:58] have
[2:28:59] every organism will receive you he said
[2:29:02] i said um
[2:29:03] what doctrine sister that baptism in
[2:29:05] jesus name
[2:29:06] i said but sister you couldn't expect me
[2:29:08] to compromise on the word
[2:29:10] and still be a servant of god she said
[2:29:12] well there's a bunch of ministers
[2:29:14] i'm here to represent out of this big
[2:29:15] city and i if you tell them
[2:29:18] that the angel of the lord that gives
[2:29:20] you these visions told you to baptize in
[2:29:22] jesus name
[2:29:23] they will be willing to accept it
[2:29:26] you hear that he said well i said their
[2:29:29] experience is weaker than this water
[2:29:33] i don't care what any angel would say
[2:29:36] if it ain't according to the word i
[2:29:38] don't believe it
[2:29:40] if that angel told me something
[2:29:43] different from that
[2:29:44] i wouldn't believe the angel god word is
[2:29:47] first
[2:29:49] above all angels that way you may say
[2:29:51] bring your angel and come
[2:29:53] because we have the word amen to judge
[2:29:56] what any angel is saying
[2:29:58] and paul's ever angels from heaven
[2:30:00] preach any of the gospel let them be a
[2:30:02] curse
[2:30:07] when jacob lost all his strength then
[2:30:09] god gave him power to become a prince
[2:30:11] when paul lost his education god made
[2:30:14] him a missionary to the gentiles
[2:30:15] when moses lost all of his ability and
[2:30:17] become weak god make him powerful
[2:30:19] to send him to egypt when you are weak
[2:30:22] then you are strong it's the simplicity
[2:30:25] of the gospel that staggers the people
[2:30:27] they try to make some great intellectual
[2:30:28] something it's the simpleness
[2:30:31] but god takes the very tool of humility
[2:30:33] and weakness and simplicity
[2:30:34] to work his work with oh maya talk about
[2:30:37] the little of the cattle
[2:30:39] demons going around powers of devils
[2:30:41] under the name of christianity
[2:30:42] teaching for doctrine the commandments
[2:30:44] of men who is strong enough
[2:30:46] who is wise enough to tame them legion
[2:30:48] stripping off the woman
[2:30:50] in the name of preachers who is strong
[2:30:52] enough to say the words that say that
[2:30:54] there's a miracle is past
[2:30:55] what we need oh god i feel it pointing
[2:30:57] around here now well when needs a
[2:30:59] prophet of god to rise up
