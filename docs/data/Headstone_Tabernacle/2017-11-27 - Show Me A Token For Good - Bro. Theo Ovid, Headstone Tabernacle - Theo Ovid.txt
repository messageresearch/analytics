your fur get serious about it they were talking to hang over them let the devil know you are serious Oh glory to God here many many men listen if coming to church is the goal you reach but this is not the goal this is the opportunity for you to get reference ID to God this church is just a channel to reconnect you to God you see where the intelligence everybody get connected if they get connected

making a good wife but she isn't mine until I take off for mine that's the way the message is you can sympathize with it you can see it's right but you've got to take it in yourself and become part of it then you and the message becomes one and here the bomb then the anointing is with you as it is with others that's when you take the word and it becomes yours so it's no longer the prophet message or the message not as your message now you become one with it this is what you want to see live when you read this you come to the church to see this oh you want to see this in your life Oh glory to

can't get this a brittle that's also a lie you can't be blessed and prosperous that's a lie you can't have joy that's not life you can't overcome the flesh and the luster of that is a big lie that's a lie he said because I live you living it also walk after the spirit but after the flesh because they are in the flesh cannot please God [Applause] probably the cardamom my so Branham this was desperation he was seeing a message this morning was they highlight message of my entire ministry I highlight message of my entire ministry that one message moving after that place that was the capping off of it you see the token I sure you know what to talk meant the plans being applied the price had been asked required of God Jesus pay that price my shed his own blood and from his life Kim from his life Kim the Holy Spirit and when here we go when the blood is applied to you which is the full word the Holy Spirit is that taught me that your price is paid God has receive you and that's the token blood apply to you how they talk we have talked about all along but now is the manifestation of the token now we have sometimes a loaded glutens are loaded except in the world I said in Christ a personal Savior made they said when you happy get happy enough to show that's it Pentecostal say speak in tongues then you got it but the token is the token it is you and crisis person together it's the Holy Spirit his life and you work in his life through you it's for a rich is for the poor is for whosoever will receive it oh my so the life and out which was God and the word comes are given to them eternal life isn't that right and that is Zoe meaning God's own life that is not your life that has his own life then the light that was in Christ as the Holy Ghost another third person by the same person in the form the Holy Spirit coming upon you as a talking that your life and your fear speed you have been accepted until that token comes you are not permitted to be on the highway look what you will what you are that is how you know you see what is the evidence brother Branham I feel it in your minds why will I know how I know he said look what you are what you will look what you are there's how you know what was you before his took one supply what was you after was applied what was your desires before what is your desires after then you know whether you have the token applied or not these are the things automatic google it the devic and impersonal any of those gives some things but it cannot be the holy ghost he can implicitly these gifts but he can't be the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is a token that the blood has been applied here we go because it follows the blood all the way from the book of redemption you see that the Holy Ghost the token follows the blood all the way from the book of redemption that was the province of his common that what he followed every age in every age he followed up the seasons brought forth so in every age the world of that age the spirit follow that to bring it far to bring it forth brood over it and this would have to be booted that would upon you and the rightness of that wood is brotherly kindness spirit of forgiveness which fear is based upon forgiveness that faith give you access right to the spirit there must be faith to access the spirit there must be sanctification to access the spirit and there must be worship to affect the spirit oh my oh hallelujah no worship no spirit no worship no atmosphere any church without worship they have no spirit I get because the Holy Spirit not coming down on dry you had to be atmosphere created for the whole way to meet that atmosphere so there were in the upper room praising and blessing God continually and in prison undressing God continually they were creating an atmosphere happy self worship then all of a sudden Buncombe the Holy Ghost to connect with an atmosphere and then each one del liquor fire or glory to God you just don't want to be in a fire you want your liquor you want to lick your lip music we're going with it that is your lick or give the Lord praises people you don't want to be in the church fire you want your look hallelujah your individual liqueur fire get your power over whatever you have to leave the power with all or either God so now D without let's not be perfect no the entire Holy Spirit visit the church making Gordon human flesh so that is what what I Branham came to represent the son of man revealing is son a man reveal and dishonor man it was the entire Holy Ghost embodied in this on a man that feel himself in the brother branham he's a continent villain of the mighty God but I can fail himself and God feel spoke words spirit spoken words define you is not some message - no no it's a God his word from you hallelujah he wasn't questioning your condition or your situation he was just finding you when he was smoking or drinking or whatever that way you can't jump anybody for anything you just had a tango for the grace that God allow into your life oh and worship him and thank him and be a testimony to who smoking and drinking oh it's a privilege to be called of God Oh Holley like thank God for calling me God snatched me out of the world hallelujah praise got a very first message I heard was white Christ speak burning by the princes decease no long San Fernando and he played sheep and asked me if I believed that - the prophecy yes I believe something about you'd be anointing was the everything was there I was a Catholic first tip and that was just music to my soul hallelujah my mother tell me she don't want me in a small church because make a lot of noise in those days I sir cry I say one day I tell you one day I'll get back to it and then I got our opportunity to leave from Seoul

Isaac they've got as accurate as a Quran even coach Eric I mean coach Isaac go to talk to Ibrahim Abraham telling his servants when he see the mountain and go tell until mountain I shall show you so even Saint Longtin going mountain after Mountain God s daily nothing we just certain mountain God said this mountain Abraham told his men I am the lad we going up and iron the lad be coming back down and in his heart you know he going to offer pies up in his heart because he believed God and if God tell him offer by exact and he do that you'll be blessed so you're gonna be mountain as I can strip

very respectful he go on college so he understand words so he trying to access father what good already he says son God will provide for himself now he know God tell him over by secular yet he's

result he didn't want to come with a testimony since I got blessed last night I see the angel and I racked up a testimony in this morning no he didn't want to talk no see insulting or meet angel or she came Johan he said listen I want a change I am NOT going to let you go until you bless me I want a new walk a new talk that's why at the end of it all you have to know you are changed you can make no claims that you can back up you have to know something is happening on the inside your nose is the same your multi the same everything is you seem natural on the outside but on the inside something is changing something is transforming or glory that God and you are being changed day by day you have been redeemed T by T or chlorine of God you already start to work in you so don't let the devil tell you nothing has that in you he has already stopped to work in you and he that start to work in you is able to complete it let the devil know even finish yet so tell him take a vacation and make a return at six months Oh glory to God dealing my time out o God have finished with you yet give the Lord a show oh my my mind hallelujah the token Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit is among us we should reverence that we should we can't humble ourselves enough taking off his shoes getting on your knees wouldn't expel it it wouldn't satisfy it wouldn't suffice us but the life that brings for the fruit of the Spirit and the fruit of the Spirit is joy love peace and so on he said know the law and the prophets were until John the scripture used on every man I saw on this in that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man presses into it a man presses into it listen not just simply walk into it so it means that just your attitude you need to adjust your attitude even your praying at home even a pray in your closet you need to adjust your attitude you see them kind of repeated prayer that you see in regular that's not good enough you have to begin to cry out and call upon God amen watch he said no he's not simply walking to it easily but it's got to be pressed in to see when you seek me with your heart all your heart cannot be found now desperations usually it takes a state of emergency to throw us into desperation it's too bad it has to do that but human beings are so slothful in their mind that it takes an emergency something arises and when they do it shows them into desperation and really in doing in desperation it brings out the real thing that you are it shows what you are made up of in a time of desperation it usually pulls out all the good things data in you in times of death are good people you know they were dying the things that are kept secret all their life and desperation they're trying to confess it trying to say take this and make it right and go please and desperation the author have done that beforehand not wait till a time of emergency will you do this for me so-and-so emergency causes desperation when we ought to do it without emergency isn't that right and they had to eat this Passover the shoes and the feet joins grid up staff near hand eating it in desperation they had seen the hand of God they seen all the miracles and then they come down under the sign of the token and while they were under the sign of the token they had to take the communion in desperation they all knew at that time God was fixing a strike in judgment it was a shaken time it was a time where every man was examining self because it happened just exactly the way he said it the tiller fire was still there the profit that our knowledge that God will only pass over when he saw the token at the door it was desperation oh my desperation something arise and it shows you that desperation isn't that right lest had been another Lord I could imagine the children when they saw those big black wings dropped down from the sky the screams come from every house the Chairman I went to the Dahlia said daddy are you sure we are under the token and he could do he could go to the door and look up on the post and lintels his son that's according to his word remember I'm your oldest child Addie are you positive I am positive I am doing a corner where the Prophet told us to do when I see the blood I'm gonna pass it well daddy why are you got your shoes on why you have your stuff on your hand why you got the piece of bread in one hand and lamb in the other hand why then Peter heard some things what are you eating it he's a dead son debt is fixin to strike with the Swift why the sweat runnin on your face debt is fixing the strike it was a time of desperation and since the message this morning from God not me I believe it ought to show the entire congregation at the desperation we have played long enough when it's just long enough we have got to do something desperation signs of his coming should throw every member of Christ in the desperation now what about our souls well what are we going to among two if we gain the whole world what are we living for what do you work for what are you eating for what are you struggling for to live what are you living for to die you're not fit to live unless you're fit to die and I believe the reason we don't have the desperation is because the lack of love God the love of God I think the love of God causes desperation if God is in you the total inside of you you see the condition of times people within and sin the way they are it shows you in the desperation oh my hallelujah God can't change time changes but he's the unchangeable God with an unchangeable message it can be sucked for creats it can't be struck for the national standards the even time message is to apply the token oh my do you love him let's continue but a random here's a question that been puzzling to several of us pardon me on some tips please xt8 explain fully about the Gentiles that don't go in the rapture I thought you said the Gentiles our left went to the tribulation and give their lives for a testimony of Jesus when it returns on the Gentiles to the Jews he turns it from the Gentiles to the Jews then there isn't any more chance for the Gentiles being safe just the Gentiles who are being saved but not receive this last the truth will go in tribulation period and then receive an EM is that right please explain because you said there would be a small number go in the rapture what about the people that believe in the Lord now and don't believe the way you preach for this em time message will they receive and the person sign your name whatever our minds a very good question the first place the confusion is what I've said about the Gentiles being done with you in the tribulation no I do not see the Gentile bride the Gentile church now the dented church here we go we'll go to the tribulation but the bride is the elected they go true nothing but the rapture they are just changed and taken out of the world oh praise God this is my own thoughts nor minister bridge in my own way I feel the spirit revealed to me the next thing has to happen the Gentile elected bride is to be caught up with the rest of the Gentile elected by dumb to the ages caught up in the presence of Christ so the sleepin bride caught up with the Living bride and then the dead raises the ones that are alive and remain has changed they are caught up together to meet the Lord in the air and after the wedding ceremony in glory Jesus that was caught up in the skies return to the earth and makes himself known to his people a type of Joseph make himself known to his brothers his wife no Gentile was present nobody was Joseph alone Meagan's have known to the Brethren his wife was in the palace type of the bride would be in a palace in glory at that time oh praise the name of the Lord do you love him oh no the Gentile bride is in heaven the sleepin virgin the Gentile religion is not to be saved during that time she is already saved but has been rejected in the bribe she only goes to the tribulation period for the time of purification because she has rejected Christ the word for her purification then she has to suffer for her deeds but the bride who has become the world oh my so the church reject Christ the word but the bride becomes the word accomplished the autonomous myth of Christ because he is the word oh praise God so my my mind so when the soldier pushed a spear up his side the blood came forth he was already dead she was already redeemed in his body by his debt there is no more suffering tribulation for the bride oh praise the name of the Lord do you love him next question if the church is saved even though she does not go in the rapture as I believe you taught she must go to the tribulation for purifying but what about these other dead how will they purified the bride don't need no purification she already purify those that are dead back there they never receive the light like the church had received they lived true justification sonication the living like that they had but no are you ready in this rapture in time like this they will have to come a time that this bride that rejects the head part of the bride what do you mean to say that the church that reject the head part of the bride will have to suffer a rejection because the gospel was made plain to them back there like his made plain to you today you have examples the sieves are open the church age later everything like that you can't miss it so everything will be finished for the Gentile church when the bride is taken from the earth the Spirit of God leaves the earth he was filthy filthy still he was righteous and righteous still his whole is holy still in other words the sanctuary becomes smoky and the attorney stands to Peter case Christ leave the sanctuary his days of material workers over the rapture comes leaves on the sanctuary he goes forth takes the book of Redemption claims everything that he's the Redeem here we go no she wanted Church now she will have to go to the church and period and the reason of it is because she has rejected the atonement in his fullness so no but a Branham is bringing a different category to identify this potent as the blood it's rich over now to the fullness of the atonement that means you can accept the atonement but not the fullness of it the fullness gonna be all the world and through adoption perfection seven thunders seven seas the whole whole scroll so God want you to accept the fullness of the world which is the fullness of the appointment isn't that right praise be to Jesus oh my skip down a little bit where Bram says okay that doesn't change do nothing down man but change is well in place doesn't change your nature doesn't change your fate doesn't change nothing but you're done in place if your doctor this morning on God's Word you get out over there I'd like your whole-- you are how you live how you could you live wouldn't change you one bit to die just as well in please if you can't accept the whole Word of God the way it's written you won't do it there so don't worry it won't be there here we go you have got to accept it in its fullness in the power of his vindication and the revelation of what it is then you become part of it you can't know the words say to dress modestly and you're not just in the monastic you can't know the word saying don't cut to here and you're cutting here you can't know the word save the treat your wife right and you're not she's my wife right Oh hallelujah you've got to accept it in his fullness of his revelation and his vindication and then you become part of it it becomes part of you you become one with it it becomes your message it becomes your anointing it becomes your word Oh glory the car do you love him tonight Oh glory to God so don't turn down the blood that's the better were speaking on this morning no praise but hallelujah so but a Brandon brought the fullness of the atonement which is the blood and that fullness of the torment is what she looses the Holy Spirit which is the seven pattern eater of God seven perfect spirits seven manifestation of one Holy Spirit even elohim himself he has seeded you don't with Lewis would I know the spirit he have cereal with locust wood and no seven perfect spirits seven manifestations of the Holy Spirit coming on to pick up that glucose wood inside your soul now he could be changed and transformed into the wood image oh praise God he said the Holy Ghost was born at a river Euphrates but the end time message is to loose the Holy Ghost so first God loosed the Holy Ghost in the form of promises that by these promises you can become practical of the divine nature because God and you man with power you have to get him character so he lose promises to see how you interact with your promises how did Abraham reactors promise he staggered not at the promise of God but was fully persuaded that what God promised he was able to perform so he had faith for himself and yet fear forever for for 0ho give the law some praises people Abraham had a fear for himself and for his wife [Applause] when a pen when she was transformed and this King wanted to take Sarah's wife got Abram tells the King dies his sister and that night could appear to the king and say every woman house is locked up you are dead man we store under my servant his wife King said but I didn't know of course I know I didn't know

looked like I was done in a map of Palestine seemed I could hear this song I'm going on to Georgia someone was singing it I do near the river I look back and see in which we had come I was to tears of the way dear to Jordan a little cross Jordan who praise God just on the other side all the promises Lee every promise Lee's and the promised land then as I set there a little bit and share all of a sudden here comes back again I knew I was in a vision when I come into the vision again it seemed that I was lifted up set it on a highway now our highway with some brother I never knew who the better was I look around I said I'm sure unnoticed as a vision the Lord God is here it seemed like everybody was afraid what is everybody so afraid of and a voice came and said there's such danger in these days there's a great hideous thing that is dead when it strikes you I heard a wheat smashing down and I looked and there come a huge monster slink crawl into the weeds I thought no no this is a vision then I see the animal of this beast is he call up the highway and as soon as I got sight of him I knew it was a member now a Mamba is an African snake which is the most deadly bite of all things there is there is nothing as poison as a Mamba the snake of course represent death and sin we have any country rattlesnake Copperhead cottonmouth moccasin many other kind of snakes if you embattled I won't

Cobra far beyond him and yellow Cobra the patient dies at a horrible death died from suffocation it paralyzed the breathing system they can't read then comes the Mamba he is dead he is so fast you can't see him he goes over the top of the weeds and propels himself with a black of a steel and just like that he's gone hits you in the face usually stands up high and strikes hard when he hits you you got a few breaths to your finish it don't only paralyze and get in your bloodstream it get nerves everything your dying seconds then native boys and track boys you can say Mamba and they will put their heads together screaming cause I know he's dead in a few seconds when one hits you and here he was on the highway and I thought well this is it so I looked at him he looked angry at me he licked his stone and here he come the man becoming too much the Prophet now and when he got close to me he run up fast when he got he would get slower and slower and then quiver and stop and then something would hold him off he couldn't bite me what was the thing that he had the token he had the presence of God around him Mamba comments speeding and slowing down thrown on and I saw this stuff watch this he turned on the other side tried to approach from the other side so the man was given up he thought was this side ha d-block see trying to make say he would get back starts wish towards me gets flowing slow and then stop the shake unguent shake like that move back he couldn't strike me Danny turn and look at my friend I know where he went out on my friend I seen my friend jumping away in the air over him over him over him trying that thing was striking at him I thought all even enter his head with instant net no wonder everybody so scared of course when it hits you it's instant that I was tracking him like that I taught my hand say Oh God have mercy on my brother it does say whenever Strachan killer just then the serpent turned to me when I said that you see the Paul woods is if I'm going after his friend and he said Oh God have mercy on my brother I said it that's a pun ever strikes him it will kill him no you know what God gave Adam Paul over right every creeping thing that creepeth upon the altar so add a map over a serpent over the animals over everything so when we're I'm speak that that's upon here the serpent into me and ice as I said that and looked at me again and the voice came from above and said listen you have been given power to bind him the worse or any and I said well God what must I do God Toland you have been given power to bind him he's Oh God but what must I do he said there's one more thing you must do you must be more sincere this is God talking a prophet you must be more sincere I said well God forgive me for my own sincerity let me have sincerity when I raise up my hands to him there was something came over me here we go yet ii possess something came over me and lifted me up it seemed like my whole body was charged with something so what Iran wasn't any natural right now he said God forgive me for my in sincerity something come over him his whole body feels charged are you at me I looked at the serpent and he started to watch me he couldn't do it yet I said Satan in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I bind you and the serpent a blue smoke flow out of him and he curl up a s silica and sign backwards and he said and that means buying this one and anything below him cause he was the worst blue smoke fell out of him and his steel choked himself to death around his head and he make this a backward S that unsigned the conjunction sang it choked that under where I was free I went over and mash on it I said I've got to find out about this because it's a vision and I hit on it and it turn like to a glass handle on a picture it was to him to solid crystal and I said think of that how quick the blue smoke was the life that was in it all the elements turned the glass and just then a voice came again and said you can unbind him also then I said Satan listen that I might know I unbind you and when it did he's that coming to life and wiggling and then I said i ban you back in an emoji disguise so the unbalance just
