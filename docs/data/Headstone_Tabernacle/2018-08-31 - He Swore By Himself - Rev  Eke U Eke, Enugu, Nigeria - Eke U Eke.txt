around god bless you and I appreciate my host pastor here for the Charles for this privilege to stand behind this pulpit I trust that God who is we maker will make a way for me god bless you shall return to our Bibles I'm reading three scriptures this morning I'm reading Genesis chapter 20 maybe sure resolute Genesis chapter 22 verses 16 and 17 I'm reading revelation 10 verses 1 to 6 and Hebrews 11 39 so I just want to start with Genesis chapter 22 verses 16 and 17 and said by myself have I sworn saith the Lord for because thou has done this thing and hath not withheld thy son thine only son dharam blessing our blessed II Anna multiplying our multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the Sun which is upon the sea shore and I seed shall possess the gates of his enemies revelation 10 verses 1 to 6 and I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed that with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it where the Sun and his feet as the pillars of fire we had in his hand a little book open and he said his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth cried with a loud voice as when a lion roars when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices when the seven thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I had a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things with the seven thunders water right there not and the angel which I saw star upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth for ever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things which are therein that they should be time no longer finally Hebrews chapter 11 verse 39 and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise god bless you may be seated praise the Lord well this morning I want to speak on his swore by himself [Music] praise the Lord he swore by himself let me start by reading this quote from the key to the door brother Brahim said therefore I believe in the full gospel every word of God that turns the power of God loose that turns his blessing to the people is the key to the door that unlocks it oh those great heroes those prophets and great men of the Bible that had that key does the reason they could stop the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the age of the soul bring the dead back to life again and do all kinds of miracles is because they held that key and they knowed it worked because it was a scripture born key and just like they knew it worked there are people in the land that know that the key works it unlocks heaven it brings everything that we are yearning for into manifestation so we're in a warfare and gods Heroes has always had warfare can you say Amen you couldn't be a hero this morning if you are not having warfare a hero is an achiever and for you to be an achiever you must have an absolute every great achievement has absolute behind it by talking about spiritual matter some have human absolutes some have Church absolute some have bishop absolute and they take these people as absolute regardless of what the Word of God says and you can't go too far because you couldn't have a human that is a failure and be a hero you couldn't have a human being that's a failure to start with as your absolute and be a hero heroes never die that cowards die 10,000 times before their death sometimes millions times before they really does been a hero never dies I know you're sitting here this morning you've gone through with all luck since I started this journey but every pointer points to one thing that is not all of us that will test of death that Omega bright hero shall not see this you and I may die before he comes and that's all right as long as you die a hero you did not give up halfway supports or no supports you stood alone because you have an unseen companion he goes with you all the time and somebody say Amen again problems Selig honor and I seed shall possess the gate of his enemy look all these precious heroes got a page full of them which I wrote down here they're all those precious hues the things that they did they finally died but then come the real faith seed the royal seed of Abraham Jesus promised Abraham had Isaac true after the flesh but the real seat wasn't in their organization system it was in that promise of God's Word that he would make him a father of Nations not through Isaac that through the royal seat Jesus that was the real seat which actually the seed of Abraham Jesus was not a Jew neither was he a Gentile he was God and a seed that God was talking about that shall possess the kids of the enemy is not the Jew is this seat here through Christ Himself that shall possess every gate of the enemy Christ has already possessed a gate of death so we are not afraid of death and go to a liberal ham because you've done this thing I am not honoring works I'm honoring faith this fit this type of faith we took without minding the outcome and I'll tell you what will be the outcome before you took it because of this thing you have done in blessing I will bless you and multiplying I will multiply you it wasn't enter and I see shop was less they kept so does not hit them kids of your enemies that's why we're not scared about what comes up or what goes down let me tell you one other thing you must take your position in the army of the Lord [Applause] Marissa tech met Abraham not before the fights after the victory we must complete this victory we can't come this far and turn around God blessing somebody when Abraham has taken his position and gone after a lot and captured back Lots he brought back everything that was taken hostage on his way back Melchizedek met him and saved him communion because the battle was over we're in a warfare we will only be met after we've taken our position and gone after our lost brothers and sisters bring them back save in the fall then Jesus will meet us after the battle there'll be thousands of table spread across for the victors and you'll be moving around shaking your hands wiping your tears don't cry no more it's all over can you say Amen this fight we must send your it be true in the strike the enemy where a sickness where I see human enemy whatever we shall possess the gates of our enemy somebody say Amen malachi for the seventh age messenger picked up all the loose ends and reveal the entire history of the bible handed over to make a choice take the rapture and he swore by himself with that book he swore by himself he saw by him that liveth for ever and ever what can set and do this morning even if we are two or three set and cannot stop us slow all by himself we don't watch circumstances because calop had the promise of God as his absolute these are at 10 have circumstances as their absolute and if you watch Hebrews 11 where those heroes are listed none of them is there Abraham Moses calop them whether Joshua them whether David them whether those who turn to flight the armies of the aliens they were all there because they had the real absolute and unfailing absolute God's Word never fails when they came back from the land with the report of the land and all they had to tell was how while the land was the challenges I tell me they not try to go and collapse to the be immediately a wash looking at the promise of God not circumstances is there we are more able to take that man you say we look like grasshoppers by the sides of them circumstances but somebody was looking at a promise seven thunders give faith shall Canada prior together it will give a rapture in faith wait till the seven thunders uttered their voices to that group that's a promise they were looking at it Amen this God we are talking about the Lord Jesus Christ he was in the Alpha and he was he will be in the Omega there's nothing said about in-between so just like the early church mounted they flew over every child in the world that same God is now in the Omega to do the same things that he did powerful church that's what is coming for can somebody say Amen give Him praise [Applause] press a lot somebody say Amen God swore it by himself hallelujah if that don't make a fellow feel like hollering hallelujah that's not.you addicts for God to swear by himself it was turn anything God who cannot lie no matter what happens there will be rapture they'll be a church that nothing can defeat our God said Abraham because you did this not what somebody else will do you're not sitting here today because of what somebody else is doing is what you have done [Music] Abraham bundled his own son it took him years before I had this son and when he had that son and as soon as grown to show that he was a son and God say I need a son and abraham got ready and a son say that I've seen the wood of cinder fire where's the lamb of sacrifice God will provide himself Omega bride can you say Amen and they got their friends he told the sevens two weeks and it one day he grabbed Isaac Isaac didn't struggle does allow tired him up put him on top of the root arrays of the knife God waited to that final moment he didn't want to take it for granted that Abraham loved him he wanted to see to the end so when he knew he will do it Abraham don't do that for this act now I know [Music] let me tell you friends God will stop the test halfway God will take anything for granted he will prove two of us to test us to that final moment before the promise will come so I said Abraham because you have done this thing now I know you love me and God a second time from heaven in blessing bless you I will multiply the Rebbe Rahab live to see it no but it was walking it's still walking to this very moment somebody say Amen somebody say it will break open you you don't break up God you don't break up God you can't break up go when you have the absolute christ-centered life like Paul did that's a different kind of life you can break the rock because God made a promise to Paul he will stand before Caesar and all hell Rosa and Paul staring the middle of the deep for tweeks everything spooky and whatever resolute God has said you will stand before Caesar chorus said there will be a rupture so no matter what comes in between so the angel of God stood up by Myron told him you'll be okay with all the people here in this ship where the ship will scatter nobody will have any problem got up there VIPRE wrapped his hand because it was cold and it was said definitely this guy must be a terrible criminal somebody feel with quickening power that was on his way to go and see season so if I pop into five and they were waiting for when you will fall down and die they got kept on doing his business I said this man must be my god same people same critics [Music] could it be to repeat that now called names or whatever it is but one day they will change their testimony or can you say Amen how can they fight back killed a man that was to stand before Caesar according to the word of the Lord there's no way I can sickness kill you if God ordained you don't go after your lost brothers and sisters absolutely impossible how can seven Turner's not keep faith when chorus said it will give him it's got to be can you save it this morning friends has anointed as you are and with the absolute of the Word of God not in here or else you shaking I don't care what kind of situation you are facing right now if you take the Word of God as your absolute chorus away maker God is a strong deliverer chorus our mighty Toa let him say so he swore by himself there will be a rupture how will it be I don't know he will prove it he swore by himself there will be a resurrection how will it happen I don't know he will prove it can somebody say Amen praise [Applause] got to come off your seat shall possess the gate of those that hit them every sickness every confusion you should possess it's not your link with Abraham baby see Christ so the Holy Ghost is our hero thus whistlin people had a hero different people Alexander the Great was a hero they have heroes in football different kinds of heroes there all these heroes will die and some of them are already dead that's one huge there is a life even now and that is your unseen companion he's a hero in the facts he never loses any battle I don't care how long it takes they cannot lose a battle sarah was not too old to be changed get inspired friends can you say Amen again because you have taken this walk of faith you don't know what will be the outcome but because I said something and you believed me how about blessing I'll bless you you shall not be closed up you shall be taken off can you say Amen again Amen again usually people who have faith are people who have experience amen look at all of them the problems took about Shambhala was is that his name the IRA used Oxford as a seed of Abraham in the natural have taken this nonsense enough this time you can't come into my grounds can somebody say Amen and with that he killed so many Philistines he became a hero in his class because they had faith so don't tell me about what we are going through what you've gone through is so terrible and Warner or something nobody promised you a reward half way nobody saves you communion half way the way you've got to go all the way somebody is depending on you somebody's watching you all eyes of heaven is upon you will you give up will you stand or brother as seven steps to climb to hit your earthly call a perfect man on the earth is there possibility yes because God said so and this being when is completed that's the man of God the servant of God that will be in that rupture will it happen yes Wow God said so are we traveling on the right Road yes sir yes sir because God sent Malachi for st. Luke's 1730 revelation 10 7 these are all vindication of the world with standing upon so never you change your absolute it is time-tested absolute lie cannot stop it doesn't shift it stands shining that's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever people change absolutes you can be a hero because we are not certain of what you doing amen absolutely I like what calop said I was 40 years then I'm 85 I'm still watching strong is I'm ready to go take my mountain friend Scott he still remembers every what promise that God make because it wasn't associated with those unbelievers even God testified to eat that calop has another spirit he has a spirit that fully follows me praise Allah and talk about it they say now therefore give me my mountain and say there are giants they say I don't feel all giants I have already given you the land and you're on them all out because if believe God so let's believe God in this hour let's be heroes in the strife striving against evil striving against your human mind strive strive strive nothing comes up that will defeat you you are unconquerable can you say Amen praise God praise the Lord Amen I can hear you now [Applause] Nawab Ram said their bride has to come forth cause his part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the full feeling of all the revelations any others that spoken of her we must comfort never you get discouraged at any point in time amen get back to the word and see what God said about you bounce back so all things are working together for my good this nasty experience yes you can explain it nobody can that he said it's working for your good and we just say Amen once you echo that the devil will be crippled because all the stress that is building up because you are wondering why once you say that everything goes and your face brightens up because you are taking the Word of God as your absolute can you say Amen my my my give him praise man I'm not going to be long but listen after the short text is position we are called to the adoption of sons by the Holy Spirit it's not just keep going Emlyn God called you four people's something God had called you to do everybody here has a purpose the enemy has conquered the whole war it has conquered politics he has conquered the clean man the clean woman conquered churches conquer everywhere that is one set these people had been names in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world talk about fighting corruption a motor on earth cannot fight Devils [Music] [Applause] you don't have the impetus you don't have it if they give you if you were to live a hundred million years you still won't succeed there's only one set ii theta one having escaped the corruption does in the war through lost i believe I'm standing before part of that group this morning praising are you are not fighting it is already conquered you just went into the heat of the victory can you say hallelujah so there are just some things camera mind think that can achieve because they don't have any absolute then we have absolute problem say if you like put Abraham Lincoln in every county not in will change we are privileged people so Satan is not happy about you and I so he's heating up everything to make you restless and things but brother brother no matter what comes no matter what goes there victory is already yours at the end of it all is still walking for your ogive impressed give me great praise [Applause] there is that so after you've or recall it after you've taken your stand technique or position what God called you to do I'm Stan to the end of the road sometimes people ask is what I saw so still standing you've never heard of it before they ask those questions I'm glad you see standing stands to the end of the road going after the loss then you're getting ready for Mel she said that one more time to welcome you from the victory he swore by himself time no longer time no longer time has run out for everything it's just waiting third one of these things there will be a change amen the manifestation will be the vindication I've gone to these two that don't be a little wimp stop crying look to what God said because of the step of faith we took to it all my praise Lord I am just going to wind up here somewhere here and Bob Ram said Java Tyra but one 964 April the second notice water type we find here after the battle is over after the real believer has forced the enemy broke down the lines and tried to capture his brother the real seed of Abraham bringing back the wayward product Marissa that comes out and save wine and bread communion giving communion after the battle was over you don't know what I suffer to be in this meeting after the battle is over we are still in the heat of the battle so what Yusuf is immaterial resolute you've not finished a bottle no need to complain Donovan said your brothers are no need to complain [Applause] [Music] [Applause] can you give me my shop you know what one time one time losses was coming down from the mountain and the children of Israel has suddenly turned away they have never seen God to see that God had a sheep of animal or anything but they imagined that God was in an animal ship and they said Iran because God so when Moses had a shout he said waist like that's a battle in the camp they say that sure doesn't sound like the shout of say different kind of a shout so something has gone wrong so the shot we are shouting now the shout of victory a very beautiful type of when the battle is over missions come near here here on earth that victories have been one jesus said they would eat it anew in the father's Kingdom after the way work has been brought back program keeps pressing it has been brought back you have a commission you can't stop halfway there will be an adopted Church sons and daughters of God born Church fields church speak and their worries but talk about a time I'm glad I'm a part of this army and in the army of the Lord then the first thing we do when we go in after the battle is over is sit down at a table in the kingdom of God and there those that has fought and sat down and overcome shall be cluded in the righteousness of Christ and them again they take the bread and the wine in the father's Kingdom on the other side were a real picture these days of Abraham getting out and getting lots I'm bringing him back you cannot be received because you are sprayed with the repellent of predestination you cannot change your absent we already sprayed praise the Lord and God's word has power to transform and I thank God for His grace upon your lives friends because you cannot do otherwise yet I stand like Luther said I cannot do otherwise and less time as we cannot do otherwise give me the
