[16:43] a my
[16:48] amen
[16:50] Oh points in their Bibles the first
[17:02] Corinthians chapter 11 you wanna read in
[17:05] verse 23 as we approach the communion
[17:08] table you'll see a few words are you
[17:13] going to come in if I receive of the
[17:18] Lord that which also I delivered unto
[17:20] you but the Lord Jesus the same night in
[17:23] which he was betrayed took bread and
[17:25] when he had given thanks he brake it and
[17:27] said take eat this is my body which is
[17:30] broken for you this do in remembrance of
[17:35] me after they same manner also he took
[17:37] the cup when he had supped saying this
[17:39] cup is the New Testament in my blood
[17:42] this do ye as offered he drink it
[17:45] remembrance of me as often as they eat
[17:48] this bread and drink this cup you do
[17:50] show the Lord's death till he come
[17:52] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[17:55] and drink this cup of the Lord
[17:56] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[17:58] and blood of the Lord let a man examine
[18:00] himself and so let him eat of that bread
[18:03] and drink of that Cup
[18:05] for he that eateth and drinketh
[18:07] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[18:08] to himself not discerning the Lord's
[18:12] body for this cause many are weak and
[18:15] sickly among you I mean he sleep for if
[18:17] we judge ourselves we should not be
[18:19] judged when we are judged we are
[18:21] chastened of the Lord that we should not
[18:23] be condemned with the world wherefore my
[18:25] brethren when you come together to eat
[18:27] tarry one for now let's pray Heavenly
[18:30] Father we thank you for your word and
[18:32] for your presence among us Lord we pray
[18:34] come into your word and speak to our
[18:36] hearts and anointest for this little
[18:38] time here before communion in Jesus and
[18:40] we ask at amen
[18:41] now be seated there are two articles
[18:45] that have been given to us which is feet
[18:48] washing and communion that the believers
[18:51] and I want to put it as bright believers
[18:54] should be partaking of I think I will
[18:57] begin to include that bright believer
[19:00] should be are taking off this morning I
[19:04] heard about four groups you have to
[19:06] belong to one a group who identify with
[19:09] a group about a banner pitch a message
[19:12] using the same scripture and the
[19:14] scripture was designing the Lord the
[19:17] body of the Lord there was a message
[19:19] that he preached discerning the body of
[19:22] the Lord and he was saying our eternal
[19:24] destination is not altogether determined
[19:26] by what we see or what we hear it's
[19:30] determined on what dazeem and we have of
[19:33] what we see and what we hear it's not
[19:36] the same as it again our eternal
[19:40] destination is not altogether determined
[19:42] by what we see what we hear but it
[19:44] didn't my what design meant we have what
[19:47] we seem to be here and it's like every
[19:50] backer coming to you or every situation
[19:52] along your life it's not the situation
[19:55] you know is what you'd is in if you look
[19:59] on flesh-and-blood you get back up with
[20:00] flesh and blood if you look beyond flesh
[20:02] and blood you get a rest another back is
[20:04] not against flesh and blood but against
[20:06] principalities and powers and spiritual
[20:08] wickedness sometimes you can't explain
[20:09] people behavior and you are thinking you
[20:12] want an explanation or you would like an
[20:14] explanation but it was no explanation is
[20:16] that demon behind it it's a spirit
[20:18] behind here that is the explanation and
[20:21] some of the things is only prayer and
[20:23] God could serve such a situation is that
[20:27] or Kanade your man Tandy beat Travis
[20:30] your point
[20:30] that's pure water reason nothing that's
[20:32] pretty one to keep that person in
[20:33] bondage so your irrational against flesh
[20:36] and blood understand the warfare it's
[20:39] not what you I see is what it is earn by
[20:43] what you I see is not what your ears
[20:45] hear
[20:49] if you're negative about me the first
[20:51] thing somebody telling ago about me easy
[20:53] to hear it because your spirit is
[20:55] already negative but if they're not
[20:57] negative you're rejected outright
[20:58] because the other coming toward you with
[21:00] this before they bring the old talk so
[21:02] you shut them down right away
[21:04] you don't wanna hear that why you wanna
[21:06] hear about some sister or hirabai burn
[21:08] brother you have no discernment you have
[21:10] to come back to discernment Oh
[21:11] hallelujah
[21:13] you have to have discernment shout out
[21:15] discernment it's a word that you have to
[21:18] have manifested in your life
[21:20] discernment Christian resentment
[21:22] discerning the body of the Lord that's
[21:25] why I say when you think you're coming
[21:26] into presence the whole concept for
[21:28] coming to church changes you're not
[21:30] coming to this tabernacle you're coming
[21:32] into presence you can go to every church
[21:34] and there's no presence there's a
[21:35] building deacons people sitting down but
[21:37] there's no anointing
[21:38] there is no atmosphere you went to
[21:40] church but when you come you come into
[21:42] presence in presence you can get up
[21:45] richer impresses they get a touch
[21:47] impresses they get the revival they're
[21:49] coming into presence
[21:50] Oh glory to God and impresses you when
[21:54] to come in obedience Paul was not
[22:00] disputing with them for taking the
[22:01] communion the act was right by the
[22:04] decimal is wrong for taking the Lord's
[22:08] Supper is the commandment of the Lord
[22:10] but they take it on wordly not
[22:12] discerning the Lord's body is where the
[22:14] wrongly these Christians was taken the
[22:18] communion and not living the life
[22:21] Christianity is an experience and a life
[22:24] not coming to church more than a memory
[22:26] Jamaat going so I'm nothing moving in
[22:28] your heart no Christianity is applied
[22:30] word apply the gospel it's like when the
[22:35] doctor give the medication and just have
[22:36] to take it you are paying what you're
[22:38] taking how much time the doctor give it
[22:40] in your ticket you're taking the
[22:42] irregular with it because yeah yeah any
[22:44] convinced of it but when you know it's
[22:46] good for you when your notice will help
[22:48] you when you know your body going down
[22:50] and a troublesome road and then you have
[22:52] to apply what is being given to you but
[22:55] this is the gospel
[22:58] it got spills hallelujah this Christian
[23:03] would take in the communal living the
[23:04] life Christian sees experience in my
[23:05] life and these Christians will live in
[23:07] any kind of a life making a poor example
[23:10] of the profession
[23:12] this is direc there's a meter in the
[23:15] wood for you and I kind of rooting for
[23:16] you ain't we not one nobody a train
[23:17] would want to take it for example I
[23:22] remember my job first and I tell people
[23:24] when I hit a job a new job our news
[23:26] department is I'm a Christian you know
[23:28] you know as you see that not maybe
[23:30] Brusilov back for you
[23:31] but to be held a comfortable I want to s
[23:37] see nothing and then you have to
[23:39] compromise because he has seen let them
[23:42] know up front this soul come in here is
[23:45] a Christian so ever going off key but it
[23:48] look like Christian but if you're
[23:50] Christian boy dies I want to hear
[23:52] Christian do do that and you see a
[23:55] Christian how you doing man
[23:59] then the people are wrong you whole you
[24:01] are comfortable because with your
[24:03] testimony you bring presence
[24:05] I see people about the custom when I
[24:08] come at the Christian coming so your
[24:13] presence and your prison because
[24:15] conviction because your testimony is
[24:18] ahead of you and you live in because you
[24:20] easy high priests of your confession and
[24:22] as you confess the Christianity he is
[24:25] making intercessions to bring you the
[24:27] pass to make their life speak out to
[24:29] making life Tunde if you don't say
[24:31] nothing you have nothing to intercede on
[24:34] your behalf you have to speak it I'm a
[24:36] Christian I'm a believer by stripes I'm
[24:39] healed
[24:39] I will be delivered I will get a
[24:41] breakthrough my hallelujah you have to
[24:44] speak it you can't be sick and he permit
[24:50] a sick sick sick and even though you're
[24:52] sick I believe I know you're sick but
[24:53] God I know you're here yet
[24:56] and this word said I said I'm healed he
[24:59] want to hear your confession of healing

[25:38] eat soup because creamy healing and he
[25:40] said I am Here I am Hugh want
[25:41] affirmative holy stomach so I'm healing
[25:44] you somebody was lying he said he was
[25:46] confessing the promise of God he wasn't
[25:48] lying
[25:48] okay the Lord a shout when you
[25:50] confessing to you that I'm not I thought
[25:52] they were you're not lying
[25:53] okay the Lord has choked raise what I
[25:56] come in a preacher season let me say it
[25:58] again when you're confessing a team that
[25:59] enough I stole their world you're not
[26:01] lying
[26:02] you're confessing the word and say thank
[26:05] you handle that because you see a
[26:07] trembling by sound he'll Oh Gloria I'm
[26:10] here I'm here I'm here
[26:11] but after like a chamber less time he I
[26:13] am I hurried up God so it is your right
[26:23] to confess the word that you feel that
[26:26] you're delivered that's why the Bible
[26:28] says let the weak say let the weak say
[26:32] one more time let the weak say he will
[26:36] confirm strength to you because he's in
[26:39] the Serie B hands from your confession
[26:41] give the Lord a show come on man come on
[26:45] woman with the testimony on front verse
[26:48] let the world know you're a Christian
[26:50] let your name I know you're Christian
[26:52] let the street know your Christian walk
[26:54] like one talk like one act like one live
[26:57] like one and comment a communion like
[26:59] one
[27:00] or get the Lord a shout in the house let
[27:08] me see
[27:09] so what we and we who call ourselves
[27:13] Christians we have no right to take the
[27:16] communit unless we are living above a
[27:18] reproach of the world we have no right
[27:20] the comunicados or living ranked as an
[27:23] example of Christianity the worst thing
[27:26] that is in the world is a person who try
[27:27] to impersonate something there's too
[27:29] much of that in the world today not only
[27:31] do we in this deal are guilty of the
[27:33] same crime that Paul was rebuking the
[27:35] continued for but I'm trying to do
[27:38] something that the Lord had commanded
[27:41] without designing the body of the Lord
[27:44] yeah God said do it but what is hidden
[27:46] behind it you see this always as in man
[27:52] behind somebody who legalistic was
[27:54] talking about brother Branham over one
[27:55] playing a piano and she dressed was
[27:56] short he say but but but look at me
[27:59] spread that you have so somebody might
[28:04] find forth that's addressed not up the
[28:06] standard but a heart and spirit was up
[28:09] to standard maybe they all she had maybe
[28:12] that eunuch Roshi maybe the one she had
[28:14] that was supposed to be long fell in
[28:16] some mud or something I'm gonna get to
[28:17] put on and she said not to stay home
[28:19] she'll come and put them to piano she
[28:21] said doing something she still doing
[28:22] better than some people's that I here
[28:23] doing nothing she still doing something
[28:25] she praying for the Lord I'm somebody
[28:28] fighting forged by that but there's a
[28:29] reason behind that it's not what you see
[28:32] it's what you deserve
[28:34] okay the Lord I show you see a short
[28:38] dress but you deserve a spirit
[28:40] [Applause]
[28:42] [Music]
[28:44] it is you look and see the one of the
[28:46] well and all who won't she man she
[28:48] written what's she doing and how she
[28:49] living but you're not seeing the resume
[28:50] it of a spirit that she was honest and
[28:53] butter man said she was feeling hot and
[28:56] Rutland buddy
[28:57] and he Pharisees was cleaning buddy and
[28:59] rattling hard and God except when I
[29:02] reject the other or give the Lord some
[29:04] praises oh praise God I hear my name
[29:07] call tonight ray I'm identified with the
[29:10] woman at a well I don't know about you
[29:11] or Gloria but if you look at Nigeria
[29:14] business it gets caught in she likes a
[29:16] business that is media they can fight
[29:20] machine that is your business
[29:21] but when the master come and calling him
[29:24] every choice and show not only was she
[29:27] joking - no everyone shouting - because
[29:29] she found where name was written and she
[29:33] found which coop she was in or gave it
[29:36] all I shocked he said rejoice that
[29:39] because it has no Devils rejoice because
[29:42] your name is on that book and that is
[29:45] all your rejoice the name is on that
[29:48] book hallelujah all right so today he
[29:53] said okay what today we are doing things
[29:56] that is in in any of the Word of God we
[29:58] should have a dissonant on everything
[30:02] that we do I may take that slow this
[30:06] message has so much depth in it so much
[30:07] stuff in it just that one man I launched
[30:10] a shake up everybody's not here we
[30:11] should have a discernment of every thing
[30:15] that we do it ought to be measured by
[30:19] the Word of God that means you have a
[30:21] resentment of who sees your friends you
[30:25] call friends is not friends
[30:34] Samson like in Delilah wasn't the
[30:36] problem Emma he had a choice he kinda
[30:40] like somebody among Israel but he
[30:42] twisted like a liar
[30:43] the problem wasn't Delilah and the
[30:47] problem that the liner was a channel
[30:49] that it never could use that is the path
[30:53] Samson didn't deserve like she like she
[30:57] but what he did not see is that she was
[31:00] a pool in the hand of the enemy when the
[31:06] Mac bus as we were saying local Palin's
[31:09] she buses truth by selling the secret
[31:13] out to the enemy and then the cut is
[31:16] here he lost the power he lost he
[31:18] anointed he lost the joy he lost his
[31:20] glory because sentence so they totally
[31:26] like I like you know she might have good
[31:28] intention but behind she has somebody
[31:31] else so this friend might have good
[31:38] intention but behind that face that cold
[31:40] friend is somebody else have dissonant
[31:44] but I a shout in the house don't let it
[31:48] ever point will over I have discernment
[31:52] but as business friend natural friend
[31:55] normal friend family friend it doesn't
[31:57] matter have a discernment as what is
[32:00] working behind the act that mover let's
[32:06] continue which are these demand
[32:08] everything we do in order to be measured
[32:10] by the Word of God all of Christians do
[32:12] once a should be measured by the will of
[32:13] God
[32:14] today people change quite a bit they say
[32:16] sometimes but more reliability on what
[32:18] did she did see that what he would see
[32:20] that's why I tell you though watch what
[32:21] people do in here what's what you would
[32:23] see dr. mrs. the sponsor doing it you
[32:25] could do it to know what you would say
[32:27] when I say somebody back sitting right
[32:29] in here and she favorite that is and
[32:31] she'd have a clue what she hearing how
[32:32] much discerning no discernment just come
[32:35] into church so you're not following this
[32:36] and so and so and brother so and so you
[32:38] don't know where he I am God
[32:40] falling the word you're on the word
[32:42] hallelujah David couldn't give my
[32:45] testimony or follow any brothers or he
[32:47] brother Vinnie ami
[32:48] and no brother to fight Goliath when
[32:51] David come here his own personal
[32:52] revelation let's not test the money he
[32:54] wasn't following nobody
[32:56] yet he cement he killed a lion he killed
[32:59] a bear and the same God that delivered a
[33:01] beer into his hands

[1:05:15] death till he come wherefore whosoever
[1:05:17] shall eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:05:19] of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty
[1:05:21] of the body and blood of the Lord let a
[1:05:23] man examine himself so lovingly eat of
[1:05:26] that bread and drink of that Cup for he
[1:05:28] that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[1:05:29] eateth and drinketh damnation to himself

[1:05:35] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[1:05:37] many sleep for if we judge ourselves we
[1:05:40] should not be judged but when we are
