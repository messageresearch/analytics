[25:09] 23 it was 22 23
[25:14] the next scripture is from first Peter
[25:16] chapter 5 wanna read from with 8 to 9
[25:20] the last scripture from first
[25:22] Thessalonians chapter 5 verse 1 tonight
[25:25] so read an excerpt 23 from verse 20 be
[25:32] halt I sent an angel before thee to keep
[25:35] thee in the way and to bring thee into
[25:37] the place which I have prepared the way
[25:40] of him and obey his voice provoke him
[25:44] not for he will not pardon your
[25:46] transgressions for my name is in him and
[25:50] if though Wilk shall indeed obey his
[25:52] voice and do all that I speak then I
[25:56] will be an enemy unto thine enemies and
[25:59] an adversary unto thine adversaries for
[26:03] mine angel shall go before thee and
[26:06] bring thee in unto the ammonites and the
[26:09] hittites and the perizzites and the
[26:13] Canaanites and the Hivites and the
[26:16] Jebusites
[26:17] and I will cut them off 1st Peter
[26:20] chapter 8 universe 8 or 9 be sober be
[26:27] vigilant because your adversary the
[26:30] devil as a roaring lion walketh about
[26:34] seeking whom he may devour whom resist

[26:46] our last scripture from first
[26:48] Thessalonians chapter 5 reading from
[26:53] verse 1
[27:00] but of the times and the seasons
[27:02] brethren you have no need that I write
[27:04] unto you for yourselves know perfectly
[27:07] that the day of the Lord so cometh as a
[27:09] thief in the night and when they shall
[27:12] say peace and safety then sudden
[27:16] destruction cometh upon them as travail
[27:19] upon a woman with child and they shall

[28:16] first Peter 5:8 be sober be vigilant
[28:19] that's the title tonight be sober be
[28:23] vigilant supposed to be serious
[28:28] vigilance is keeping careful watch for
[28:32] possible danger and difficulties not the
[28:35] happy-go-lucky anything goes no but be

[28:49] right looking forward to see what the
[28:53] Lord will do tonight and only amplify
[28:56] that full script I read first Peter 5:8
[28:58] o 9 it says be well-balanced temperate
[29:04] super in mind
[29:06] be vigilant and cautious at all times

[29:14] around like a roaring lion in fierce
[29:17] anger seeking someone to seize upon and
[29:21] devour withstand him be firm in faith
[29:28] against his onset rooted established
[29:34] strong a movable and determined knowing
[29:39] that the same identical sufferings are
[29:42] pointed to your Brotherhood the whole
[29:45] body of Christians throughout the world
[29:48] Oh hallelujah hallelujah the Prophet a
[29:54] devil is almost harmless unless he had
[29:58] have something to work in you remember
[30:02] those Devils that were cast out of
[30:03] Legion he said they want to do more
[30:06] mischievousness so they wanted to go
[30:09] into the hugs
[30:10] so Devils must have something to work in
[30:14] and somebody to work through and that's
[30:18] the way God does - he has to have us he
[30:22] is depending on us to work through us
[30:25] all glory to God so God is dependent on
[30:29] you he's looking to you really that or
[30:33] glory to God to powers and there are two
[30:35] kingdoms and do you know we have had
[30:37] wars after wars and rumors of wars but
[30:40] if the earth stands we love plenty more
[30:42] wars and do you realize that there's
[30:44] only two powers in all the universe of
[30:47] all differences between nations

[1:17:07] grinding Shore look at her he's a
[1:17:09] you watch me 1 over 1 hour he said watch

[1:17:17] on Ukraine oh come on now give the Lord
[1:17:20] some praises Oh hallelujah I won't keep
[1:17:25] you long
[1:17:29] there's only 2 power sittin his power
[1:17:31] he's got is a perverted power of God
[1:17:34] it's a provision of God's power
[1:17:38] everything season has debt is a polluted
[1:17:41] life a lie is a treatment schooled
[1:17:45] adultery is a righteous act misused
[1:17:48] everything the season has got is
[1:17:50] something that was perfect but it's a
[1:17:52] power so you can say he had no power
[1:17:55] it's a power but the polluted power
[1:17:58] so Satan dwells in the realm of pavilion
[1:18:02] whenever you find a provision perverted
[1:18:05] thoughts mind attitude and behavior it's
[1:18:08] satanic because that is where he realm
[1:18:10] when he dwells oh my / Gideon hallelujah
[1:18:17] and this is where Bromstad sin did not
[1:18:21] originate in it it originated in heaven
[1:18:24] and it was thrown down from heaven cast
[1:18:27] out to heaven to the earth and fell on
[1:18:29] human pinions
[1:18:30] then the battle from angels became human
[1:18:34] battles and Satan come to destroy God's
[1:18:37] creation what God had created to be for
[1:18:39] himself
[1:18:40] Satan come to destroy this and that is
[1:18:43] what his purpose was to destroy it then
[1:18:46] the battle began here on earth and begin
[1:18:49] in US and has been region ever since
[1:18:52] this great battle that started on it
[1:18:55] they had to be a mutual meeting place
[1:18:58] they had to be a play selected for the
[1:19:00] battle to begin and for the back of the
[1:19:02] range and the battleground beginner the
[1:19:04] human mind that is where the battle
[1:19:07] starts the human mind was chosen for the
[1:19:11] place of the battle where it was begin
[1:19:13] and that is because decisions are made
[1:19:17] from the mind the head it never start
[1:19:21] from some organization they never
[1:19:23] started in some mechanical affair
[1:19:25] oh my Oh glory to God
[1:19:28] something has to happen on the inside he
[1:19:31] says your mind accepts it the world it
[1:19:33] grasp it what is your mind controlled by
[1:19:35] your spirit and your spirit catches the
[1:19:38] wood of God and that's the thing that
[1:19:40] but life in it it brings the life into
[1:19:42] your brother what takes place then the
[1:19:44] life come Tom's in that channeling to
[1:19:45] you the Word of God is manifested in you
[1:19:48] and that's why the Prophet said we're
[1:19:50] gonna play something he says when the
[1:19:52] invisible become visible then God is
[1:19:57] manifested so this battle of angels that
[1:20:01] has become human battle you will begin
[1:20:04] to see this war fear in the physical
[1:20:07] realm so when Jesus cast the devil out
[1:20:12] the people saw a supernatural power
[1:20:15] being defeated by the power of God when
[1:20:19] Jesus opened the blind eye that was
[1:20:22] Jesus uncovering blindness that belong
[1:20:26] to Satan and bring insight when Jesus
[1:20:29] brought Lazarus from the grave that was
[1:20:32] the power of God conquering debt
[1:20:34] ensuring that life is more powerful than
[1:20:36] dead and even though Satan could snatch
[1:20:39] that young girl and bring it the death
[1:20:41] Jesus could snatch it back
[1:20:43] or glory of God the man that was
[1:20:47] crippled he could tell the man Street
[1:20:49] now look at those guys who brought their
[1:20:52] friend and open up the roof and drop the
[1:20:53] friend down
[1:20:54] oh my dick couldn't come in him didn't
[1:20:58] leave but the bringin wasn't another
[1:21:00] ambulance and they bring him they walk
[1:21:02] with him on that crunch and palate or
[1:21:04] whatever
[1:21:04] the crowd was all wrong the bust through
[1:21:07] and they let him know but here comes a
[1:21:10] battle the devil have another condition
