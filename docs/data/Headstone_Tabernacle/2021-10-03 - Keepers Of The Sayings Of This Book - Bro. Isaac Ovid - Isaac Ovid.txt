thirsty hungry children this morning lord may you bless your people we commit the word into your hands the reading of the word and the hearing of it in the precious theme of jesus christ and the church says amen and the church says amen amen just before getting into the service just for two announcements or well actually i know the praise of prayer requesting an announcement so sister suzanne rajkumar is sending a note of praise uh thanking god for we would have prayed for her sister-in-law i believe a couple weeks ago and thanking god for total deliverance he is completely healed and looking for deliverance of her soul and for continued prayer so we thank god for that this morning amen she's also thanking god for daniel rajkumar who received a silver award out of over 26 000 students in the world for the queen's commonwealth essay he got a silver award for that so we thank god for blessing him and nationally he also won two awards from the national uh i guess two national youth awards one in art and one in english so we thank god for that blessing amen and we also want to just remember the sitaram family for those who may not have heard it the funeral service for our pressure sister christine will be today at 1 30 p.m via live stream only brother ovid uh is not here this morning he's preparing to head down to san fernando uh due to the coveted restrictions they could have only allowed this the family and just a total of i think 10 people uh man brought over there to to handle the funeral arrangements we want to remember the family in prayer this time let's just pray one more time our gracious heavenly father we want to remember lord our precious lord family lord mr christine's family and we want to firstly thank you for her life for her testimony and for her walk with you that lord touched us in so many ways lord despite lordy afflictions lord she persevered and maintained a testimony and that is such an encouragement to us lord and to know that when lord we see her again she will be able to see us because she'll be in a perfect body so father lord may you touch the family at this time and bring comfort to them to lord firstly know that all is well father that you are in control lord and where she is there's no more pain and there's no more suffering lord there's no more blind eye and no more diabetic condition this body this pest house has been put down and she is now walking in fellowship and singing and dancing and shouting and father we still lord as the bible said we sorrow but not lord like the world lord we sorrow knowing lord that we will meet again and we are encouraged by our dear god lord to make ourselves ready so may you bless lord the family may you bless brother nicholas and sister naomi in a special way and may you bless the funeral service at 1 30 p.m in the precious team of jesus christ amen and amen so we will be sending out the link uh for that after this service so that you can connect to the live stream amen so are you ready for the word this morning i just want to get to one portion of scripture and i'm connecting i'm plugging into but over its last two messages how many were blessed with the message two weeks ago revelation 10 and then uh the lord god had spoken who can but prophesy what masterpieces so i want to go to the book of revelation thank you musicians you know we're on a time restriction so i want to get history to where we need to go this morning so reading from revelation 22 a little bit read this scripture uh last week and i want to read it and touch something in there by the grace of god so revelation 22 and reading verse 7 behold i come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book and i john saw these things and heard them and when i had heard and seen i fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things then saith he unto me see thou do it not for i am thy fellow servant one and of thy brethren the prophets too and of them which keep the sayings of this book three worship god and he say it unto me seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand he that is unjust let him be unjust still and he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is holy let him be holy still and behold i come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be so your work is being evaluated i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end the first and the last blessed are they that do his commandments that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates of the city for without or for outside are dogs and sorcerers and hormones and murderers and idolaters and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie i jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches i am the root and the offspring of david and the bright and morning star and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that hear it say come and let him that is a this come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning blessed be the name of the lord thank you those who made it out this morning's weather last night i told my wife i looked up to make sure the roof was still there the rains and the wind and we know what what it is it's not the storm it's not the weather forecast you know what is it it's the whole creation groaning the whole of nature groaning and travailing because the the the groaning for sons to come back into position so the whole of nature the trees the animals the winds they know that something is not right and man coming back into position is what will make it right so if you are not crying out for a restoration of the sons of god the trees are crying out and the winds are crying out nature knows better than our politicians hallelujah the winds no better than the scientists because they know that when a man of god is in position then things are in order the devil loves disorder and chaos but when sons of god are in position then all is well can the church say amen and this great mystery this great message this great scripture we read is all about getting us back into position to get us back into order to take us from misunderstanding and not understanding and darkness and ignorance and not knowing to a place where you know that you know that you know that your confidence and your faith does not rest in man but your confidence and faith rest in the word of the living god because heaven and earth will pass away but this word that we preach this word that we believe this word that we hold on to will never pass away can the church say amen so i have a title this morning and my title is keepers of the sayings of this book hallelujah hallelujah keepers of the sayings of this book are you a keeper this morning of the sayings of this book hallelujah there's a special group of people who have existed in every single age who were keepers of the sayings of this book hallelujah it didn't matter what happened around them they were keeping the sayings of the book alive the sayings of the book was more important to them than their banker a saying of the book was more important than the doctor's report what the book said hallelujah was more important than how they woke up this morning the sayings of this book is something that they hold as precious they hold as valuable they are not going to backslide because they are keepers of the sayings of this book because what this book spoke about has got to come to pass and there is a blessing to those who keep the sayings of the book hallelujah can the church say man i'm not going to be too long with you but i want to follow but over his message because he was in these scriptures and as he as he was preaching i was looking at it and let's just go to it we kind of walked through a little bit then again and get into some quotes can the church say amen behold i come quickly hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book so anybody who keeps the sayings of the book is already blessed if you are here this morning and you are keeping and to keep hallelujah means a number of things can the church say amen to keep means to god to keep means to protect to keep means to defend to keep means to heed in the amplified it says heed and takes to heart and remembers oh hallelujah so every service we come to it's to help us keep the sayings of this book not my sayings not brother over chains not anybody's sayings but the sayings of the book because a saint of the book will withstand time and break you into eternity the sayings of this book will reach you in the hospital room the sayings of this book it is because of this book and the sayings of this book we could have faith this morning to call for a revival it is because of this book and the sayings of this book god said so i believe it and that settles it can the church see amen many people keep all kinds of stuff they keep something that their father told them they keep something their grandma told them they keep something the politician said they keep something they read in a book somewhere where shakespeare said this and this is what he said in his book but what about this book i'm speaking about this morning because this book says things and notice and this is so relevant to us it is not blessed is he that keeping the writings of this book so it's not the letter of the thing it's the sayings of the book so it has to move from the written to being expressed or anybody with me this morning you remember when that man came to the prophet and he was blind and when he got prayed for he went back home and he said my eyes didn't open so he came back to the prophet what did the prophet say to him i prayed for you already you already healed but your faith hasn't connected to the sayings of the book because the book has a saying that covers your situation so i need to connect your situation to a saying in the book we've got to find something to connect to in the book if we cannot connect to a saying in the book you're not going to get your healing so i want you to leave church today and say by stripes i'm healed because that's a saying anybody with me this morning that's in the book and that man he went to work oh he went to work and he said by stripes i'm healed by stripes i'm healed up and he started to do what he didn't realize he was doing but he was keeping the saiyans of the book and a blessing followed him because he was keeping the saints of the book and one day by stripes i'm healed by stripes i'm healed by stripes i'm healed by stripes i'm healed one day his eyes pop open he was blessed because he kept the saiyans off the book anybody with me this morning hallelujah anybody with me this morning what are the sayings you are keeping what sayings are you holding on to is it the word of your neighbor is it the word of the doctor is it the word of something you read or is it the same of the book because it's a blessing [Applause] simple message this morning a bible study this morning an encouragement this morning but i believe this morning i'm speaking to keepers defenders protectors guardians of the scenes of this book i don't want it flavored differently i want to keep the scenes of the book the way the book says oh come on somebody help me this morning i don't want a watered down version of the scenes of the book i don't want your interpretation of the sayings of the book i'm a keeper of the sayings of this book oh that's my testimony that's my walk that's my talk if this book says i'm gonna have a revival i'm keeping that same if this book says my sons and my daughters all gonna be delivered they're gonna prophesy i'll pour my spirit go take this gospel into the whole world it is for you and for your children that's a saying in the book i i don't want to leave it written in the book i want to say it so my children got to come my children got to come there's a saying in the book says be there for perfect as your father in heaven is perfect i don't want to leave it as a writing in the book i want to be a sayer of what is in the book somebody gave god a shout out praise [Applause] behold i come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the scenes of the prophecy of this book people hold on to all kinds of stuff their interpretation their idea their vision their perspective their opinion the amount of things we say that's not in the bible that we call to be in the bible hallelujah and it's so subtle we sing the song let the week say i am strongly under poor say i am rich where's the poor i'm rich part that part i'm not saying that the poor can't say original but when we get down into the science of seeing what the tape says into the science of saying what the bible says and finding what god says concerning you because even jesus had to keep the sayings of the book when jesus started to get into his ministry he had to go back to the book to find the writing and he has to now make it into a saying by saying the spirit of the lord is upon me he was not reading or writing he was beginning to express the writing as a saying the spirit of the lord is upon me they thought he was reading and writing but he was actually making a declaration the spirit of the lord is upon me for he has anointed me and listen to his they totally reading but he making a saying and then this day this scripture is fulfilled it's no longer writing it is now a saying it is now a declaration i have found where it is written concerning me and because i have found it i could stand firmly on the promise of god and no devil no demon no doubt no spirit no principality no sickness nothing could stop these saiyans these saiyans have defeated the devil every time every place under any condition it's more important to keep the sails than to keep your job it's more important to keep the saiyans than to keep your friends it's more important to keep these saiyans than to keep your reputation it's more important to keep these sayings that they keep your phone and to keep your bank card because these saints could put food on your table i've never seen the righteous peg bread i have never these saiyans could put food on your table these shears could take you through when you're in a storm are you accessing the blessings of the sayings of this book what words are coming out of your mouth what are the sayings that people know you for when people say one thing brother so-and-so says is x y and z what are the sayings that are always the first thing that you see we are connecting back to words and the power of words but more than that what good is it to be in the message what good is it to be a christian and you're not keeping the sayings of the book because the whole point of the book is to bring us into an understanding and a realization of who god is and his thoughts and intents and how he expressed it in a word form so that it could pass through the test of time and reach to us in 2021 that these words country now transform back to spoken word these written words can once more become saiyans become prophecy because the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy can the church see amen [Music] behold i come quickly we are still here in the scripture we'll see how far we get to this morning blessed is he that keep it the scenes of the prophecy of this book i'm not trying to keep church i'm not trying to keep membership i'm not trying to keep my no no no no no no we are fighting this is earnestly contending right here hallelujah for the saiyans of the prophecy of this book that's why brother said last week i listened back to the message that's why he said listen if you preach i'm messing and there's no promise no promise of revival no promise of deliverance no promise of manifestation of the sons of god these promises are prophecy and these prophecies are promises that give us access to the divine nature of god that deed by these precious promises not by what so-and-so said we need to kill our ideas and focus on the sayings of the book but abraham had to find a saying amen malachi 4 516. if that wasn't there the prophet doesn't have a platform to keep the saiyans you have to know the sayings you can't keep what you don't know imagine you are you are a security guard and anywhere you're working tomorrow and and report for 9am and nobody tells you where you have to keep your recent work and you know what to do you don't know nobody's to give you your assignment well what am i supposed to god i don't know yet you have nothing to guard but if you have to keep the saying then the sayings to you must become more precious than anything else so the challenge for us now in this age where knowledge has increased and people finding time to pursue all kind of extracurricular knowledge acquisition they want to learn about this the one they find it was that's the age we're living in you know how this work and why this is so and what is happening with this and you know you read this you read this but they can't give you sayings they don't know what the book says and because they don't even know what the book says they can't keep the saiyans of the prophecy of this book anybody with me this is the key the key to unlock you not backsliding because you can be living in the sayings and working to keep it and find yourself doing foolishness because when you start to connect to the sayings and see all that god has expressed in his word that we are supposed to live now and you now make it your business to keep it you're making your business to pray because prayer is in the word and you're keeping the sayings of the book so you can't live a day without praying you can't when god told joshua this book of the lord shall not depart from you but meditate on this thing day and night so you could have good success all through scripture it has been about keeping the saiyans of the book can the church say man i don't know just helping anybody this morning but how are you fought if how do you keep something how do you keep us saying alive hallelujah are you practicing the saying are you exercising these muscles of fate to keep saying what you're supposed to say do you if you if you are ceasing this mountain move have you have you tried to speak to situations look at david david said goliath i'll cop you cut your head off because david understood what he was standing on he understood the promises that were given that wherever you put your foot is yours he could rest on saying when jesus was there in the wilderness being tested the devil come and attack him take this tuna cassidy into into bread what did jesus say he went and pulled us in he said it is written swing the devil come again it is also written what was he doing keeping the scenes of the book because he knows that if he keeps the saints of the book the devil himself have to back up jesus could have used power he could have god could have sent angels but this was to demonstrate to you the power of the word and the power of you applying the sayings of this book to your life to your situation not what your mama said not what your wife said not what the doctor says not what the neighbor says not what anybody says but the sayings of the book is what will bring back your children your faith connected to the scene of the book is what will give you the baptism of the holy ghost because the promise is unto you and to your children and to them that are foul do you know that saying are you keeping that saying hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord oh blessed be in the name of the lord i feel good this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah arise shine for thy light has come oh and his glory will be seen upon thee do you know that saying are you keeping that saying is your light shining hallelujah blessed peter name of the lord when david said i was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the lord that became a saying it was a declaration is that your saying are you keeping that same when last have you said i was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the lord you know if you wake up feeling cranky and the first thing you say on a sunday morning is i was glad when they said unto me let us go to the house of the lord you know your cells and your molecules and the fibers in your body begin to line up right because you're saying it was the word that put the earth in place it was the word that put the sun in place it was the word that put animals here do you know the power of your words do you understand why this is not what is written but what is spoken what are you declaring this morning what is your declaration this morning i know who i am oh hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord oh hallelujah so we have a couple things in there just to share with you encourage you this morning yeah people who don't know the sayings that's one problem then you have people who know the same but they don't keep it and the two have to come together you need to know your promises and you have to guard it what did they say thy word have i hid hid in my heart that i might sin not are you guarding this world in your heart are you are you making sure and you protect it from all kind of attack and negative thoughts and the worldly music and distraction and envy and lust and laziness you know laziness is is actually a sin i need to do a bible study on that laziness is the synonym anybody say look at the ant look at the animal look at the insects who gets in up and working oh good let me just turn back and finish sleep and hope when i wake up you go on and what is it it is not a literal figure like it's situations that could hinder you that you allowing you're making excuses you're making an excuse for inaction why didn't you pray this morning why didn't you pray yesterday did you meditate on the word yesterday morning and night as god instructed joshua meditate on the word day and night so you could have good success so don't come to me and talk to me about you're not successful if you're not doing what he said to do to be successful anybody with me you want the key to success meditate on the word day and night and you'll have success that's the one formula oh you don't hear me this morning you want spiritual success meditate on the word day and night once you do that you can't ever come to church feeling down you can't come to church feeling well i feel pressure i feel like i fight i feel like no no no no no because the word is your source the word is your sustenance and you are a keeper of the saiyans of this book and i john when verse 8 saw these things and heard them this scripture is very telling because what john is experiencing and he's articulating and explaining his mind is blown we already know it's john because john has introduced himself to earlier in the same book but he's making it clear to you this is not hearsay i john i didn't hear it from somebody else listen he said i saw these things and heard them so i just see it from a distant but i saw it i saw it first person i saw it and i heard it and when i had heard and seen you know how i am with scripture where these things are when i heard and saw so there's no question in my mind i'm not taking somebody's explanation of my conviction i'm not trusting nobody with my experience john is saying i saw this thing for myself i understand that there's a blessing for those who keep these things and when i heard and seen he is so blown away by what the angel had shown him and allowed him to hear anybody with me this morning when i had heard unseen i fell down to worship you see what the default position of when something happens in spiritually in life what the default is john didn't say i fell down and i sat to the right notes i fell down and a message came to me i fell long and a court came to me i fell down when i saw these things listen he saw and heard and his default i was sharing in a youth service a week ago i had the opportunity to speak for brother peter chandler's young people and i said listen what made david unique is whenever anything went wrong he went back to default settings you know when something goes wrong with your phone when you install things on your phone or a new app and your phone get all corrupted there's an option to re to reset the phone to default setting and default setting takes everything that you do and messed up bring it back to factory settings david's factory settings was a believer david's factory setting was his heart was leading to god and look at john john's factory setting was what worship what he heard and saw drove him to worship are you driven to worship do you find do you find reasons to worship god do you realize worship is not just about hearing the word and worship but when you see the wonders notice when i see the stars and then saying it's my soul i'm not a singer but you know the song when you wake up and yes you can look at the negativity look at the news but when you see the sun get up and nobody push it up there you know how much trouble you when if you wake up and the sun any sight to get up who put his son up this morning but a more than you imagine you wake up in the morning and the sun just decide today i'm not getting up but you don't have to do nothing with that and you walk and you can't find a reason to worship god i was by but a punch some some time ago i was talking about the vehicle on the car and different things and i say look at look at this thing here no matter how good people make after time you have to service it you have to tune it up you have to change your engine you have to change that alternator you have to change the battery and look how god could create a human body but appointed you have to come back in three months of service and to think that god gave a man time on this earth 10 15 20 30 40 50 60 70 years and and and you're not the one take your heart out you take on your chest you take out your lungs and every two months you have to go and service it man can't make a device yet that can last that long and god wake you up this morning you then wake yourself up and you can't worship god i don't care what went wrong in your life you want to tell me you don't have a reason to worship god that's why i can't understand people who claim to believe this message and they sit down want to process information without a revelation and john had all the revelation because it was seen to him and he went to worship oh give us some worshippers [Applause] the magnitude how blessed john was to see what he saw think of it to see and hear you have a many of us are a fraction of what god allowed john to see firsthand testimony and all john could do is just worship all john could do is worship blessing anonymity power oh dominion holy holy holy is the lord lord god almighty people want to sit in a messy with revelation and no worship you're going nowhere with that understanding and no worship you have nowhere to go information and no worship get out of here i would overturn last week you might as well get used to worship yeah you might as well get used to making noise here [Applause] because when john saw his name he said all in heaven all on the earth all under the earth heard me shouting heard me worshiping heard me praising god worship god this morning i don't care in your living room if you're in the kitchen if you're here in the house of god if you're watching this on the replay worship god worship god worship god worship god that's what makes him god he's the object of worship revelation drives you to worship. [Applause] i wanted deeper i wanted deeper and no worship keep and no testimony information and it's not sayings you have it you know it you know it but your life still envy still jealousy but when you said you just worship god you take it and just worship god worship takes away your thinking you know because worship has nothing to do with you worship has nothing to do with you worship to have got to do with your bank account the doctor your body your situation is just you talking about god it's not even talking about you it's lord you are worthy you are king of kings you are holy you are mighty and when god feels that from you when god senses that from you he can now pour out grace to you grace to your situation [Music] [Applause] we need to understand friends you may be seated i can't be too much longer we need to understand the distinction and the clear separation between who god is what he is and his attributes there is a difference because he was god before he expressed his attributes oh you don't hear me this morning what a friend we have in jesus is secondary to the fact that he is god oh you don't hear me this morning the fact that he's a healer is secondary to the fact that he is god because as god he had attributes he wanted to express he could not express them all at once it took the unfolding of time for the full expression of his attributes but he always was god [Applause] before he was a father he was god before he was a healer he was god or you never heard that like that before self-existing one he was god when the angels worshiped him he was god before he made man object of worship makes him god that is what the devil hated not his relationship as father or healer or we maker or his torah because there was nothing to restore yet but the fact that he was god and in fact he was getting worship when lucifer saw it and he saw what was happening because of worship to god he could tell us let's make the devil jealous this morning let us make the devil jealous this morning by worshiping god [Music] one of the biggest assaults you can launch against the enemy is just to worship god [Music] the biggest issue the devil has is when you worship god i'm in the message you're not in no message if you can worship god because it's god's message hallelujah oh come on now somebody preach back to me we are the worshippers jesus said the hour cometh and now is up where the true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and in truth [Applause] hallelujah no more excuses no more excuses he deserves a worship no more excuses he deserves the worship he deserves the worst shepherd he deserves the worst shepherd he deserves the worshiper i'm not going to be too much longer and i john saw these things and heard them have you seen have you not seen enough have you not heard enough over the years for you to be a worshiper have you not seen enough have you not heard enough for you not to be a worshiper because you cannot get nothing from the preacher if you are not here worshiping because worship puts you in the spirit you want to get into the spirit make it about god not about you brother said last week yes your flesh what did i have to do with it have nothing to do with it make it about god when it ever comes you say don't look at me you know worship god it's about him his grace is keeping me his love is keeping me i can't keep myself i'm worshiping god watch the devil get confused because he wants to make it about you and we want to make it about god let god make it about you by saying this is my beloved son i want god to speak not the pastor not somebody else god will make it about you when you are approved when you have stood the test keepers of the sayings of this book i'm not going to be too much longer hallelujah and when i had heard unseen i fell down to worship but listen to john and this is so important as spiritual as john was this is the last book of revelation we're reading from john would have seen so many symbols so many mysteries seeing what we wish we could see and want to see and in time get to see john was so blown away brother clarence that despite the anointing and the atmosphere he was in john made a mistake he made a mistake that so many in the message i'm making this morning he had the right idea but the wrong direction he said i fell down to worship [Music] before the feet of the angel which showed me these things it is so easy to get impressed by an angel in operation this was not a fallen angel this was not the deceiving angel so it is logical it is not impossible for john to be overwhelmed with the magnitude of the anointing and the words like so many of us get caught up with this man of god and this apostle of god and this pastor my pastor and and what is it it's a form of worship how many make it clear like this angel did then said he unto me see thou do it not don't worship me remember the time when the bran was on the field and he heard that they were baptizing in his name but ibrahim didn't say i'm in the middle of a campaign let me finish the campaign and when i get back home i will deal with it he stopped the convention and said brothers i'm out before you could do that how you will leave the meeting we sponsor the meeting we set up the convention people travel here people set up your hotel don't pay for in advance you see that have nothing to do with me because there's some worship that is misplaced that i need to go on a dress and any true servant of god will quickly address misplaced worship or you don't hear me this morning because anything that takes the place of worship to god is misplaced worship so but amanda made it clear that anything could be your god you can make your car your god he can make your business your god he can make your house your god it can make your wife your god it can make your phone your god and most of us get that let's get the spiritual people who we may gods [Music] because your pastor is a man a prophet is also a man and this was not this is our angel but at the end of it worship belongs to only one place [Applause] i hope this gets deep into your heart because i hear people speak about the church and the pastor like it's infallible and make statements and declarations that are so not scriptural it is horrific it is a horror story and that's why god when anything like that happens god god breaks it up he take a sledgehammer and mash it up because you'll have no other gods before me even if it's one of my representatives that should not be a god before me i hope this gets into your heart welter john sorry and when i heard unseen i fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things then saith he unto me like any true angel any true man of god see thou do it not for i am thy one i read this and read it thy fellow servant in other words i'm i'm just like you i'm a servant just like you that's that's all that's powerful enough enough that i bred join the prophets so i'm a servant but i give it in my office now because all offices are servants so it's not no big me and little you we are all servants well parents we are all servants but my office might be pastor might be teacher it might be usher it might be deacon it might be host wife it might be we all have different but a man said god will adopt housewives an adopted housewife will trip up a pentecostal pastor with 50 000 people like that why because she's adopted and in her office oh come on come on you you don't hear me this morning an adopted housewife will walk in the hospital room not have a degree in medicine and walk in today and say my son come on the bed oh you don't hear me this morning do you understand where god is trying to take you that's why i see it and ministers would like to hear this but by the equal if it is true the fightful ministry is a it's a it's a limited ministry you know it's till we all come so when we reach the points above all coming into the unity of the fate and until when our work we uncontract on them and the contract will come to an end once everybody comes to their position because god has nobody between father and son father and daughter all god longs for is that relationship between father and son father and daughter direct one-on-one you may be seated now once god has a man on the earth and people are still being brought into the position he will go to the man because that's god's system but when you are in your position and we come into the fullness of our possession and the fullness of rightness when the hot july sun peaked through and all the greenness all the old ways and the little things you're still struggling with get dried out and the church is seasoned out by birth pains oh my my my mind they get tremendous sometimes but anybody with me this morning i hope this helps somebody let me try to wrap up almost done the music could get ready for i am thy fellow servant my god so don't make no mistake we all servant we serve in god and we are serving each other we have become so messed up here but i believe i respect the cabbage man i respect the name i respect the sinner people in the message are you talking to hina i have a revelation of this message he doesn't know the message so he is shock squad not just shock serpent seed you who could you how could you speak like that you you you find the message you find the message or the message found you because my understanding is the message finds us in them you will be hunting you're searching you don't know what to search for you listen to the testimony that people are searching they read this book they read that book they went to this church they went to this church they went through the baptism actually they read this book they meditate they went to the mountain upside down organic and then all of a sudden somebody come and say check this book out i said when he opened the book and they read a few words to reckon that this was different they never seen nothing like this before or they heard a tape and they never ever but but it found you you're going to be walking down the street and and somebody preaching by the corner and you're here to say wait time without talking about me i didn't know my name was was adoption and perfection and this thing started to ring a little i know it had to be more than salvation i know god had just saved me to save me but he saved me for a purpose he redeemed me backed her position taking me back to eden so i could have spoken with power anybody could relate to that this morning and you young people like me who grew up in this message it is not an automatic thing that because you're born in this thing you'll appreciate this thing you grew up in church you're hearing it you're hearing it in it if this thing don't come and meet you individually you get look up to you parents do their very best i would like to think parents do their very best the best they know how to do young people hear me and hear me well parents do the very best they may not do everything right they may not do all the answers but they try their very best to give you the best they could financially intellectually spiritually their ex don't abort could they do better perhaps could they do better sometimes maybe but in their heart they try their best to show you the right way not to trap you not to mess you up not to ruin your life count yourself blessed if they pointed you to this message because their journey to this message was harder than yours but you still need a personal experience for yourself for this message to be identified with you and that could never come with your father or never come from your mother it has to be between you and god and you catching a revelation that these sayings are true and you want to become a keeper of these things i'm trying to find a place to close off here see thou doeth not for i am thy fellow servant one and of thy prejudice prophets too and this is the part that captures all of us and of them which keep the sayings of this book that is the true common bond of a believer not i am in the message but i am of them which keep the sayings of this book now the statement say what the tape says has a whole new meaning because it makes you a keeper of the sayings of this book because the tapes is a spoken word the revealed form of the written word that brings us closer into being keepers of the sayings of this book and that angel closed that sentence with worship god so servants of the lord worship god of thy prejudice the prophet of thy bridging pastors of thy virgin deacon whatever you are worship god and of them which keep the sayings of this book worship god we just finished reading this scripture i didn't get any quotes this morning but i trust you're blessed this morning and you know i'm preaching the quotes and he said unto me seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book in other words it's not the time to keep it wrapped up this is not the time to play around with this thing because for the time is at hand the time is at hand for what what is the time at hand for it's not just a time at hand because on the track time the time is at hand what is it in relation to what does his time being at the hand mean for us as believers and this is the warning and the blessing he that is unjust let him be unjust still he was just filthy let him be filthy still he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is holy let him be holy still and behold i come quickly and my reward is with me he's walking with his reward oh church he's walking on the reward for the keepers of these things to give every man according as his work shall be in the amplified it says to give each one according to the merit of his deeds early works and faithfulness faithfulness have you been faithful have you been faithful to this book have you been faithful to the scriptures have you been faithful to this great message i'm not dealing with faithfulness of church or pastor or conviction or belief but faithfulness to this word of god amen i come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end the first and the last blessed are they that do his commandments that they may have right a right means nobody can stop you listen to where he writes come in blessed are they that do his commandments are you doing his commandments can you testify you're doing his commandments friends when i'm preaching i'm not preaching to church and i'm preaching to me so don't take a direction at you because i want to make this i want to be the requirement for myself i can stand and say as for me and my house we are keepers of the sayings of this book and we are doing his commandments because this is the same thing the prophet said with full obedience to the entire word of god entitles you to the token it's the same thing there's no difference here blessed are they that do his commandments so not only are you blessed there's a blessing by just doing his commandments but it goes beyond just a blessing it says that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates into the city through the gates means they could enter in without having to jump over the wall creek creep through the back that you can walk in knowing i have a right to be here who are you who are you i'm a son of the king i'm blood washed i'm redeemed i've been redeemed by the blood of the lamb check my papers i've been redeemed by the blood of the lamb i fell along so many times but i got back up i've been redeemed by the blood of the lord you have no idea which mistakes i made but just like hebrews 11 by faith abraham by faith david by faith daniel they get saved by faith lyndon by faith eclipse by faith anthony by faith isaac i wanted to say the same thing about me because we did what we kept his commandments i'm closing out i'm finished blessed are data do his commandments that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates into the city for without or outside are dogs and sorcerers and hormones and murderers and idolaters and whosoever love it and make it a lie that's that scripture is incredible any people who love lies you know you could you imagine that loving and making they have a factory they it goes into production they're making and they're loving and making lies i just want to read it to in the amplified outside are the dogs and it goes into godless impure those of low moral character and the sorcerers with their intoxicating drugs and magic arts as the amplified i'm reading and the immoral persons the perverted the molesters and the adulterers and the murderers and the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices lying deception and cheating these are the people who can't get into the gate last two scriptures i jesus have sent my angel to testify unto you these things in the churches i am the root and the offspring of david and the bright and morningstar and the spirit and the pride say come and let him that hear it say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely may the lord richly bless you this morning and i trust you take in your heart that from this day forward
