[12:54] believers
[12:56] there's fate in this house there's faith
[12:58] in the church
[12:59] and the bible teaches us that if two
[13:01] shall agree touching anything
[13:03] we can have what we ask for so we are
[13:06] coming tonight
[13:07] and we are uniting in faith and prayer
[13:11] making an altar where we are being

[13:26] through your word lord and teaching us
[13:29] from your thoughts lord the plans
[13:32] lord and the way you look at things that
[13:34] are so different from how we look at
[13:36] things lord and
[13:38] lord before we even get into that we
[13:40] want to
[13:41] lord to remember the needs of your
[13:44] people

[13:57] some people may not even want to express
[13:59] but they're there and lord
[14:00] more importantly you know they are there
[14:02] and you know they exist
[14:04] and lord in this virtual meeting tonight
[14:07] lord as so many times before and even
[14:10] when you are
[14:11] here on the earth you didn't need to be
[14:12] physically in the room
[14:14] where a subject was to be able to bring
[14:17] relief to them
[14:18] lord that centurion came lord for
[14:21] a servant who was sick lord and lord
[14:24] you were able to minister in so much
[14:27] that that centurion had to ask the
[14:28] question what time
[14:30] was he healed so father god we know that
[14:32] time
[14:33] is no limitation for you space is no
[14:35] limitation for you

[17:03] get started
[17:04] tonight i um uh i
[17:07] really want to salute um brother joseph
[17:09] williams he he shared a scripture this
[17:11] morning
[17:12] and um i just felt it was such a
[17:15] blessing
[17:16] and you know when i saw it as like this
[17:18] is such an encouragement you know and
[17:19] it and um it speaks to me because he
[17:22] took it out of the amplified
[17:24] and um i love um when you see the
[17:27] scriptures out of the amplified
[17:29] because it puts it's put some shape to
[17:31] the words at times you know so i'll read
[17:33] it
[17:33] as it would i was as i would normally do
[17:35] from both the king james and then he
[17:37] amplified and i trust it'll be a
[17:38] blessing to you
[17:39] before we get into this bit of a
[17:41] teaching tonight and um
[17:43] also if you're not seeing somebody here
[17:45] in a meeting tonight
[17:46] feel free to send them a message um to
[17:49] connect to the bible study
[17:51] we are we want to report for duty and
[17:54] strength and we want to encourage one
[17:55] another
[17:56] especially now in this time more than
[18:00] ever and um the scripture that brother
[18:02] jew would have shared
[18:04] was taken from second corinthians four
[18:07] and it was verses 16
[18:09] to 18 you know and um so thank you
[18:12] brother joe for this
[18:13] and uh i want to share it with the
[18:15] church uh
[18:17] second corinthians 4 16 for which cause
[18:20] we faint not
[18:21] but though our outward man perish yet
[18:24] the inward man
[18:25] is renewed day by day
[18:29] for our light affliction i love that
[18:32] light affliction you know sometimes they
[18:34] don't feel light
[18:35] but paul says it's our light affliction
[18:39] which is bought for a moment well if
[18:41] that's not the comfort i don't know
[18:42] what will be a comfort to you tonight
[18:44] that the affliction you're going through
[18:46] is just for a moment work it for
[18:49] us a far more and more far more
[18:52] exceeding
[18:53] and eternal weight of glory
[18:56] while we look not at the things which
[18:57] are seen but at the things which are not
[19:00] seen
[19:00] for the things which are seen are
[19:02] temporal but the things which are not
[19:04] seen
[19:05] are eternal so that's in king james but
[19:07] i want to read it
[19:09] and this is how brother joe would have
[19:10] shared it as well and he amplified
[19:13] therefore we do not become discouraged
[19:17] utterly spiritless exhausted and wearied
[19:20] out
[19:20] through fear i can't tell you friends
[19:24] how much time i've heard the word fear
[19:26] and tired
[19:27] and discouraged and weary in the last
[19:30] few weeks
[19:31] but here it is paul is encouraging this
[19:34] is this is not
[19:34] written solely to the corinthians but
[19:37] this is written to me this is written to
[19:38] you this is written to us
[19:40] therefore we do not become discouraged
[19:43] so so so this year i want this to be an
[19:46] encouragement to everybody
[19:47] we do not become discouraged
[19:50] utterly spirit-less you have no spirit
[19:53] yeah you have no
[19:54] no zeal you have no your drive it is
[19:56] there
[19:57] utterly spirit-less exhausted and
[19:59] worried about through fear
[20:01] though our outer man this physical man
[20:04] that we know it's not like we don't know
[20:06] this outer man is progressively decaying
[20:10] and wasting away yet our inner self
[20:13] which is more important is being
[20:15] progressively renewed
[20:17] day after day is that your testimony
[20:19] that your inner self
[20:20] is being progressively renewed day after
[20:23] day
[20:24] whether you feel like it or not for our
[20:26] light
[20:27] momentary affliction and i mean
[20:30] in the fight it says this slight
[20:32] distress of the passing hour
[20:35] is ever more and more abundantly
[20:38] preparing and producing and
[20:41] achieving for us an everlasting weight
[20:44] of glory
[20:46] beyond all measure excessively
[20:49] surpassing
[20:50] all comparisons and all calculations
[20:53] of vast and transcendent glory and
[20:56] blessedness never to cease
[20:59] since we consider and look not to the
[21:01] things that are seen
[21:03] but to the things that are unseen for
[21:05] the things that are
[21:06] visible and temporal the thing that are
[21:09] visible
[21:09] are temporal brief and fleeting but the
[21:12] things that are invisible
[21:14] are deathless and everlasting
[21:17] so we want to focus tonight i really
[21:19] appreciate about the joe
[21:21] i trust he's on the on the court tonight
[21:23] but that was really a blessing
[21:25] and i trust will be an encouragement to
[21:26] us tonight and i trust everybody's doing
[21:29] fine that you are pressing the battle
[21:32] amidst the trials that god in his wisdom
[21:35] send our way to ensure that we build the
[21:38] character
[21:40] and the disposition and the attitude and
[21:43] the temperament
[21:45] of sons who are being shaped to take
[21:48] over
[21:48] to take responsibility uh to reign on
[21:51] the earth
[21:52] and over the last few weeks god has
[21:54] really been gracious to us
[21:55] and i would have said it that we turned
[21:58] a corner
[21:59] uh remember we preached that message get
[22:01] into the golden altar
[22:03] and every service that followed have
[22:05] been there's a thread that's connecting
[22:07] it
[22:07] you know all about sacrifice and
[22:09] priesthood and
[22:10] we shall reign on the earth and and and
[22:13] and every service including sunday
[22:15] service and what a tremendous blessing
[22:17] it has all been so by the grace of god
[22:21] uh i want to continue from our last
[22:23] bible study
[22:24] where we would have touched on time
[22:27] talent
[22:27] and treasure and i would have entitled
[22:30] it to study of giving
[22:32] um tonight by the grace of god i want to
[22:34] speak on time
[22:35] talent and treasure 2 this is part 2 and
[22:38] i want to speak on equality of giving
[22:40] and i trust that it'll be a blessing to
[22:42] you that we could take a look
[22:44] at the scriptures and the word and see
[22:47] what god wants us to see
[22:49] um i don't intend to be too long with us
[22:51] tonight and uh i
[22:53] i'm trying to also fit in a number of
[22:54] things within a certain time
[22:56] frame um so certain things i i
[22:59] would have you know that me i may have
[23:01] wanted to share tonight
[23:02] um i would not be able to get it in that
[23:04] kind of a way
[23:06] but i trust that what we're able to do
[23:09] tonight could edify us and to reframe
[23:11] our perspective our approach to how we
[23:13] live
[23:14] and to how we use these three great
[23:17] resources we spoke about in our last
[23:18] bible study of our time
[23:21] our talent and our treasure the reality
[23:24] is that
[23:24] time as we said before is given to man
[23:29] a time a time beyond which we cannot
[23:32] pass
[23:32] a time that we have choice over a time
[23:36] that we could choose if to be in bible
[23:39] study or not be in bible study a time
[23:41] to choose if we work or play if we study
[23:44] or we relax time what we do with time
[23:48] time has results lack of time use of
[23:50] time failure to use time
[23:52] time running out time speeding up time
[23:55] how we look at time
[23:56] time talent the gifts that we are given
[24:00] you're not here on this earth without
[24:02] something to give i heard somebody say
[24:04] recently the fact that you are here the
[24:06] fact that you are alive means god is not
[24:08] finished with you yet
[24:10] so there's a talent there's something in
[24:12] you that god placed there that that that
[24:14] is there for a reason
[24:16] um and most people you know sadly never
[24:19] come to realize the purpose that god
[24:21] placed them on the earth
[24:22] and they are mel purposes a
[24:24] multi-layered thing
[24:26] because on the one hand um you could say
[24:28] well they want to understand your
[24:29] purpose in god
[24:30] but purpose has so all to do with your
[24:32] interaction with others
[24:34] so it's not just your purpose to god but
[24:36] your interaction with other people
[24:38] for some people their purpose so but
[24:40] iran would say i believe in speaking of
[24:42] of martin luther or one of those in the
[24:44] past that
[24:45] that his mother's purpose was to bring
[24:47] him to the earth
[24:49] i think it was john wesley or or one of
[24:52] them that the whole purpose she was on
[24:54] it was to bring wesley to the earth
[24:56] because he was such a critical peace in
[24:58] god's plan
[24:59] that how great of purpose was to bring
[25:02] him to the earth
[25:03] so so you have people who their purpose
[25:05] you know could be to
[25:06] touch somebody's life in a certain way
[25:08] it could be to to do
[25:10] certain things in a certain kind of you
[25:11] know and and you have to understand
[25:14] that your talent and what god gives you
[25:16] and how you do things
[25:18] is uniquely you and god doesn't want to
[25:20] use you
[25:21] like somebody else he wants to use you
[25:23] like you
[25:24] but you have to make yourself available
[25:27] to be used
[25:28] um you having a talent or a skill or a
[25:30] gift
[25:31] and not making yourself available is the
[25:34] same thing like almost not having it
[25:36] because if you're not available then god
[25:37] can't use you you know so
[25:39] time talent and treasure the resources
[25:42] it becomes an equation because how you
[25:44] use your time and your talent
[25:46] will typically equal your treasure
[25:49] somebody who works
[25:50] overtime it will result in a greater
[25:53] treasure because there's a greater
[25:54] compensation for working over time
[25:57] if you improve on your talent if you
[25:59] master your talent
[26:00] it will result in your treasure so it's
[26:02] all connected you know
[26:04] time talent and treasure very important
[26:06] for us to understand
[26:07] what god has given us access to and what
[26:10] we use it for
[26:11] not just as as citizens of this earth
[26:14] but as believers and what god wants
[26:16] for us so as we go a bit deeper um
[26:20] into this thing tonight um i want to
[26:24] start with matthew 16.
[26:26] um jesus's pivotal scripture in matthew
[26:31] 16.
[26:33] and then we're gonna just touch three
[26:36] different spots in scripture we're gonna
[26:38] look a bit at malachi something that
[26:41] malachi refers to
[26:42] and speaks about so and then we're gonna
[26:44] touch on david and
[26:46] then come back to jesus himself by the
[26:48] grace of god tonight
[26:50] so matthew 16 as we know
[26:53] is a turning point it is that discovery
[26:57] moment
[26:57] when jesus challenges his disciples
[27:00] who do men say that i am we are familiar
[27:02] with this and he gets his answers we're
[27:04] not teaching on that so we're gonna just
[27:05] go past it
[27:06] and then he comes to them personally all
[27:08] right it's one thing to know what others
[27:10] say but what do you say
[27:12] and then later on and very close to the
[27:14] ending of that chapter
[27:16] very powerful scripture matthew 16 24
[27:20] then jesus said unto his disciples if
[27:22] any man will come
[27:24] after me let him deny himself
[27:28] let him deny himself and take up his
[27:32] cross
[27:33] and follow me for whosoever will
[27:36] save his life shall lose it and
[27:39] whosoever will lose his life for my sake
[27:43] shall find it for what is a man
[27:46] profited if he shall gain the whole
[27:49] world
[27:50] and lose his own soul or what shall a
[27:53] man
[27:54] give in exchange for his soul
[27:58] powerful scripture and i want to hone in
[28:01] there's so much to say
[28:02] in this but i don't want to spend too
[28:04] much time
[28:06] on this area here but that last verse
[28:08] really struck me
[28:09] because we're dealing with giving
[28:12] the quality of giving and i think i said
[28:14] it in the last bible study that
[28:16] many of us in the message within the
[28:18] message for some reason
[28:19] we have some of the most selfish people
[28:23] sometimes you don't even realize it
[28:25] sometimes you don't think about it you
[28:27] don't consider it
[28:28] selfish with your time selfish with your
[28:31] talent
[28:32] and selfish with your treasure but here
[28:35] it is jesus is talking about
[28:37] what does it profit a man to gain the
[28:39] whole world and to lose his soul
[28:41] i want to read this in the amplified
[28:44] before i bring it so close and then
[28:45] jesus said to his disciples if anyone
[28:47] wishes to follow me as my disciple
[28:51] so not just follow me in any way you
[28:53] want to but as my disciple and disciple
[28:55] means disciplined one
[28:57] so it means in your operations your
[28:59] behavior you're not just following him
[29:00] you know the people who who follow the
[29:02] news
[29:04] they follow our entertainer they're
[29:07] following what's going on with the
[29:08] pandemic
[29:09] that's not the follow here that we're
[29:11] talking about if anybody wants to follow
[29:13] me this is now conditional
[29:15] as my disciple as my disciple now puts
[29:19] context of what this follow me really
[29:20] means
[29:21] because as my disciple it speaks now
[29:24] about discipline
[29:25] and i remember yeah last year we did a
[29:27] bible study uh
[29:28] speaking about the discipline of the
[29:30] word and having the word
[29:33] bring us into a conformity to be like
[29:36] god to be like jesus to behave the way
[29:39] he wants us to behave
[29:40] and we have been students long enough to
[29:42] know that we believe in a practical
[29:44] gospel
[29:45] that this thing can be a head knowledge
[29:47] thing or an intellectually we hear any
[29:49] message thing
[29:50] but it must be real to us that we have
[29:52] to have a discipline with how we live
[29:54] and act so it says if anyone wishes to
[29:58] follow me as my disciple
[30:00] he must deny himself which means set
[30:03] aside selfish interest
[30:05] so again i want to bear this out here
[30:08] when jesus is saying something it must
[30:11] be that a condition
[30:13] existed exists or will exist for him to
[30:15] make
[30:16] this statement can i say that one more
[30:18] time for jesus to make a statement
[30:21] it must be that the problem existed
[30:24] exists or will exist to warrant
[30:27] him making a statement she said if any
[30:29] man wants to follow me he has to deny
[30:31] himself
[30:33] and and the amplifier goes on to say
[30:34] this deny means to set aside
[30:37] selfish interests now we all have
[30:39] interests
[30:41] we all have things that we want to do
[30:42] for ourselves
[30:44] and quite honestly the vast majority of
[30:47] what we do for ourselves very important
[30:51] we are driven by self-interest you want
[30:53] to eat something
[30:54] if you don't eat or die so your
[30:56] self-interest would drive you to want to
[30:58] eat
[30:59] your self-interest will drive you to
[31:00] want to rest there are certain things
[31:02] you are driven to
[31:03] but you don't have to weigh everything
[31:05] you do in the context
[31:07] of a decision a choice a commission a
[31:10] command
[31:11] to follow jesus a certain way because
[31:14] not everything that you want
[31:16] or i want or you desire or i desire
[31:19] maybe in our true best interest is
[31:21] anybody with me
[31:23] all right so then jesus said to his
[31:25] disciples i want us to
[31:26] capture this again it is not anybody and
[31:29] anybody's talking to
[31:31] he is speaking to his disciples he is
[31:33] speaking to a very select
[31:35] group of people and it is almost as if
[31:37] he is rebuking them
[31:39] it almost comes across as a warning you
[31:40] know if anybody wants to follow me
[31:45] this is not the public he's speaking to
[31:48] this is him he's speaking to a chosen
[31:51] hand-picked few these people didn't
[31:54] volunteer they didn't sign up they
[31:55] didn't put in an application form
[31:57] they didn't apply for the job they
[31:58] didn't say i'll be interested in
[32:00] no no no this is after having spent
[32:03] enough time with
[32:04] jesus that he was comfortable to
[32:07] challenge their understanding of who he
[32:08] was
[32:10] and after the revelation of who he was
[32:12] is made clear to them he goes in deeper
[32:14] it's almost like he's going in to
[32:16] make a point now i don't understand who
[32:19] i am because god revealed it to peter
[32:21] now that it is clear to you let me let
[32:24] me nail this in this is this is the kind
[32:26] of teaching jesus is doing in matthew
[32:28] 16 and it's like a call to arms call to
[32:30] action kind of teaching
[32:32] and it applies to us tonight as well if
[32:34] you really want to follow this thing if
[32:36] you really want to be a christian
[32:37] if you really want to be a believer if
[32:39] you really want to make the rapture if
[32:42] you really want to be my disciple
[32:44] because ultimately these things in
[32:46] succession in sequence and in
[32:47] combination
[32:48] is what leads to victory as a christian
[32:51] right so
[32:52] again then jesus said to his disciples
[32:55] why would you say to your disciples if
[32:58] anybody wants to follow me
[33:01] and he's already his disciples so is it
[33:04] that jesus is looking for a deeper
[33:06] relationship a more
[33:07] consecrated relationship a more sincere
[33:10] kind of following
[33:11] because earlier in that same chapter he
[33:14] would realize that they were following
[33:16] without a fullness of revelation they
[33:18] were following him
[33:20] based on certain things but when he
[33:21] challenged them for their own personal
[33:23] testimony
[33:24] of why they were following and who and
[33:27] if they as
[33:28] individuals recognize who he was he
[33:30] recognized that they were failing the
[33:32] test
[33:33] i don't know this is helping anybody
[33:34] tonight i'm not into the teaching yet
[33:36] this is just foundation to just
[33:38] get that one line i just like to i'm
[33:39] just trying to reach it at one line
[33:41] but i just want to make sure the context
[33:43] is there because context matters
[33:46] most people who read scriptures take
[33:48] scriptures out of context
[33:50] so you have to put scriptures in context
[33:52] for it to make sense anybody with me
[33:55] right so then jesus said to his
[33:57] disciples if anyone
[33:59] wishes to follow me as my disciple in
[34:01] the amplified
[34:02] he must deny himself set aside
[34:05] selfish interest and take up his cross
[34:09] listen to the amplified here expressing
[34:12] a willingness to endure whatever may
[34:14] come
[34:16] and follow me believing in me
[34:20] conforming to my example in living
[34:23] and if need be suffering or perhaps
[34:26] dying because of faith in me
[34:27] that's all in the amplifier for whoever
[34:31] wishes to save his life in this world
[34:33] will eventually lose it through debt but
[34:36] whoever
[34:37] loses his life in this world for my sake
[34:39] will find it
[34:40] that is life without me for all eternity
[34:43] for
[34:44] what will it profit a man if he gains a
[34:47] whole world
[34:48] and it says wealth fame success but
[34:51] forfeits his soul
[34:53] or what will a man give in exchange for
[34:56] his soul
[34:56] so he's still coming back to this giving
[34:58] before i close off this chapter
[35:00] i just want to highlight this one point
[35:02] for what will it profit the man if he
[35:04] gains the whole world
[35:05] and the amplified says wealth fame
[35:08] success think about it
[35:10] wealth fame success what are people
[35:13] famous for
[35:16] wealth fame and success what are people
[35:18] famous for
[35:21] to this day people still talk about
[35:23] michelangelo
[35:25] leonardo da vinci shakespeare
[35:29] people are famous so for what what makes
[35:31] somebody famous isn't it how they use
[35:33] their time
[35:34] isn't it how they express their talent
[35:36] is that because of their treasure
[35:38] is there some combination of these three
[35:40] things is what make people famous
[35:42] so famous people wealthiest man on the
[35:45] earth
[35:45] forbes have their publisher list of
[35:47] wealthy people famous for what
[35:49] treasure people get prizes and awards
[35:52] for what for talent
[35:53] they could sing they can act they
[35:56] discover something
[35:58] scientists what is that is that not
[36:00] talent
[36:02] and don't you have to spend time to
[36:04] express these things
[36:06] so your time your talent and your
[36:08] treasure how you use it
[36:09] and then jesus ends that message that
[36:12] sermon with the question
[36:14] what will a man give in exchange for his
[36:17] soul
[36:18] so how much of your time will you give
[36:20] to ensure
[36:21] that your soul is in order how much of
[36:23] your talent will you give
[36:25] to ensure that you're that you are doing
[36:27] all you can do for the lord
[36:28] how much of your treasure will you give
[36:30] for this thing
[36:32] is it worth it is is it worth it is the
[36:35] time we spend in this room
[36:36] with it is your prayer life with it do
[36:39] you see the value of your prayer
[36:41] do you see the value of the effort of
[36:43] the sacrifice in my song light but it's
[36:45] connected
[36:46] because what shall a man give in
[36:48] exchange for his soul
[36:50] so can we go on i believe i would have
[36:53] touched
[36:54] it it was in my notes bible study if i
[36:56] didn't get to it but paul said i have
[36:57] shown you all things in acts 20
[37:00] verse 35 how that soul laboring
[37:03] [Music]
[37:04] ought to support the weak and to
[37:06] remember the words of the lord jesus
[37:08] how he said it is more blessed to give
[37:11] than to receive and i was sharing with
[37:14] brother ovid
[37:15] and um you know i hardly thought but in
[37:17] just having a conversation with brother
[37:18] i was just sharing with him
[37:20] and i said it's so interesting that most
[37:22] people
[37:23] give the lord their leftovers
[37:27] they give their leftovers of
[37:30] time they give their leftovers of their
[37:33] talent
[37:34] and they give the leftovers of their
[37:36] treasure it's almost like if
[37:38] after what is important is taken care of
[37:41] then i can give god
[37:44] so only what's left then when i finish
[37:47] doing then i will see
[37:49] you know i'll i will see if i have time
[37:51] i will see if i have time
[37:52] to do something pretty long i will see
[37:54] if i have time
[37:55] or i'll see if i could if i make myself
[37:57] available
[37:58] make my skill available or if i have a
[38:01] resource
[38:02] if i have the money to do something for
[38:04] the lord instead of god being first
[38:07] god is interested in in first fruits
[38:10] he's interested in the first of your
[38:12] time
[38:13] the first of your talent and the first
[38:15] of your treasure
[38:16] do you really want to be someone who
[38:19] give god
[38:20] what's left that's a question tonight
[38:23] do you really want to be someone who
[38:25] give god
[38:26] what is left all right so
[38:29] i want to go our first reading to
[38:32] malachi
[38:32] 1. i know many people have never read
[38:36] malachi 1.
[38:38] but we're going to go to malachi 1 and
[38:40] we're going to go to
[38:42] uh to we're going to start from verse 6
[38:45] malachi 1 and verse 6.
[38:51] malachi 1 and verse 6 and this is
[38:55] the lord speaking through malachi here
[38:58] right we're talking about time
[39:00] talent and treasure and look at and and
[39:03] specifically now tonight he's speaking
[39:04] about equality of giving
[39:07] in other words before i even read the
[39:09] scripture
[39:13] most of us choose what we give effort
[39:17] and energy to
[39:19] sometimes because the boss put pressure
[39:20] on us we give better to divorce
[39:24] because there's some pressure what
[39:25] something we give in that kind of a way
[39:27] but
[39:27] look at how god is dealing with this in
[39:29] malachi 1 and
[39:31] verse 6. a son on earth his father
[39:35] and a servant his master
[39:39] if then i be a father this is god
[39:42] speaking
[39:44] where is my honor a son
[39:47] on a written father and a servant his
[39:49] master
[39:50] if then i be your father where is my
[39:52] honor
[39:53] and if i be a master where is my fear
[39:57] so god is saying even a son that's
[39:59] honored his father
[40:01] even a servant his master then if i
[40:04] god is speaking about himself if i am a
[40:07] father
[40:07] where is my honor and if i be a master
[40:10] where's my fear say the lord of hosts
[40:13] unto you o priests
[40:15] that despise my name and you say wherein
[40:17] have ye
[40:18] despise my name so this year is
[40:21] interesting because
[40:22] he is speaking to priests who despise
[40:25] his name
[40:26] who by virtue of the next question they
[40:28] don't think they despise in his name
[40:31] that's why he asks this question and he
[40:33] say wherein have we despised thy name
[40:36] so god is using malachi to challenge the
[40:39] priests
[40:41] and we have spent and labored and spent
[40:43] effort to
[40:44] establish that we are all priests so i
[40:46] want to look at this very carefully now
[40:48] wherein have we despising him
[40:51] listen to verse seven this is how god is
[40:54] seeing the despising of the name now
[40:56] till the priest didn't realize they were
[40:58] despising
[40:59] the neymar so now god is telling them
[41:01] what he means by that he said
[41:03] ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar
[41:10] and he's still wearing have we polluted
[41:12] thee
[41:14] in that he say the table of the lord is
[41:18] contemptible
[41:23] and it and he offered a blind for
[41:26] sacrifice
[41:27] is it not evil the blind is referring to
[41:30] is
[41:30] you know when you bring a lamb to be
[41:32] sacrificed it has to be alarmed without
[41:34] blemish
[41:34] anybody with me so god is coming
[41:37] straight into
[41:39] not the fact that they're giving you
[41:40] know can we kind of drive home here
[41:44] it's not that they didn't bring the
[41:45] bread they brought the bread
[41:47] it's not that they didn't bring the lamb
[41:49] they brought the lamb
[41:50] they brought their sacrifice they gave
[41:53] they gave their time
[41:55] they gave their talent they gave their
[41:57] treasure they brought a sacrifice
[41:59] but they brought it anyhow they wanted
[42:01] to
[42:02] it and if you offer the blind for
[42:05] sacrifice is it not evil
[42:07] and if he offered a lame and sick is it
[42:09] not evil
[42:11] offer if no unto thy governor thy
[42:14] governor so you saying
[42:16] offer this not to the natural governor
[42:18] you bring into god
[42:20] you bring into kingdom business
[42:23] things that you can't even carry to
[42:26] natural man
[42:27] anybody with me anybody in the house
[42:28] tonight
[42:31] this is malachi 1. a lot of people have
[42:33] not spent time and we're going to
[42:34] connect this
[42:35] we're going to go to david then we're
[42:37] going to go to jesus himself so god is
[42:39] saying i see how old you're operating
[42:42] what you're bringing from me you
[42:44] wouldn't even care for the governor
[42:46] lord help us you wouldn't go to your
[42:48] boss with this thing
[42:49] you wouldn't go to pay your taxes this
[42:51] way the approach you're taking and this
[42:53] is priest he's talking to
[42:56] he said you and he offered a blind for
[42:58] sacrifice
[43:00] is it not evil we spent time but over
[43:02] spent time
[43:03] in in the message getting into the
[43:05] golden altar we spent time talking about
[43:07] the tabernacle
[43:08] and and they had to wash their hands on
[43:10] their feet and they had to
[43:12] all all the details of it that got laid
[43:15] out
[43:15] by the time malachi is profit look at
[43:18] how backslidden they have become
[43:22] but you can't tell them they're not
[43:23] bringing sacrifice on offering and doing
[43:25] what it's supposed to do you know
[43:27] so this is not a quantity of it it's the
[43:30] quality of it anybody with me
[43:33] it is the way they're doing it and the
[43:35] offer is still in verse 8 and ye
[43:37] offer the blind for sacrifice is it not
[43:40] evil
[43:42] and if he offered the lame and sick is
[43:44] this not evil
[43:45] or for if now unto thy governor will he
[43:48] be pleased with thee
[43:49] or accept thy person say the lord of
[43:51] hosts
[43:52] so god is speaking through malachi and
[43:55] has to resort
[43:58] to using an example of how they will
[44:00] treat a natural governor
[44:02] to try to make a comparison that what
[44:05] you do and not even good enough for man
[44:07] and he's trying to bring it to me
[44:11] verse 9 and now go through malachi
[44:14] saying and now i pray you beseech
[44:17] god that he will be gracious unto us
[44:22] this had been by your means will he
[44:24] regard your person said the lord of
[44:26] hosts
[44:28] who is there even among you that would
[44:31] shut the doors for naught
[44:33] neither do you kindle fire on my altar
[44:36] for note
[44:37] i have no pleasure in you said the lord
[44:39] of hosts neither will i accept an
[44:41] offering at your hand in other words
[44:44] when you give stuff to the lord and it's
[44:46] not willing
[44:47] it's not in your heart you don't want to
[44:50] do it you're not approaching god the
[44:51] right way god say keep it
[44:55] i'm not accepting it because you
[44:58] wouldn't do that
[44:59] in the natural why would you bring it
[45:01] any spiritual
[45:02] anybody with me all right
[45:05] we we i want to help you i want to help
[45:08] me i want to help us
[45:11] this is where the scripture comes from
[45:13] for from the rising of the sun
[45:15] even unto the going down of the seam my
[45:18] name shall be great among the gentiles
[45:22] that's verse 11 and in every place
[45:25] incense shall be offered anybody with me
[45:30] unto my name and a pure offering
[45:35] now there are so many layers and layers
[45:37] and layers that we can go to
[45:40] but i want us to understand part of our
[45:43] worship is our giving
[45:45] giving of our time giving of our talent
[45:49] and giving of our treasure not only is
[45:51] it a requirement to give
[45:54] god is clear on how he wants it given
[45:56] you can't bring your time the way you
[45:58] want
[45:59] and this is why is is babies you have to
[46:01] keep cooks and cokes and cokes and
[46:03] come to church connected you hook up
[46:05] report for duty let that be a meeting
[46:08] because as a priest it's your
[46:09] responsibility
[46:11] morning sacrifice even sacrifice keeping
[46:14] the flame burning
[46:17] if you're missing that go and watch
[46:18] every single service from getting to the
[46:20] golden altar watch everything
[46:22] twice three four times
[46:26] until you understand that you're a
[46:27] priest
[46:31] the priest can say i feel in this
[46:32] morning to do it i have feeling this
[46:34] evening to go
[46:35] and i'm feeling you can't do that
[46:40] and if you're called to be a priest that
[46:41] is your talent
[46:44] you're called to do it you have to give
[46:46] me time to do it anybody with me
[46:51] verse 11 trying to i'm trying to i'm
[46:53] trying to move i'm trying to get in
[46:55] for for from the rising of the sun even
[46:57] into the going down of the same my name
[46:59] shall be great among the gentiles
[47:01] and in every place incense shall be
[47:04] offered unto my name this is powerful i
[47:06] know in other words
[47:07] worship sacrifice in every place will be
[47:10] offered unto the lord
[47:16] and a pure offering for my name shall be
[47:18] great among the heathen said the lord of
[47:20] hosts
[47:23] but he have profaned it in that you see
[47:25] the table of the lord is polluted
[47:27] and the fruit thereof even his meat is
[47:29] contemptible
[47:33] and we can sub there anybody with me
[47:36] tonight
[47:39] so god wants our very best all right
[47:42] so i want to jump now if you will with
[47:45] me
[47:46] to first chronicles
[47:51] first chronicles 29
[47:56] i just want to pick up a little point in
[47:57] there to help us
[47:59] along this journey
[48:02] about putting god first and
[48:05] understanding a few things
[48:07] and we can take it from scripture to see
[48:09] how god thinks about about it so
[48:11] we saw god dealing with a certain
[48:13] situation there in malachi
[48:15] and we're talking about not giving godly
[48:18] leftovers
[48:20] so you work hard hard for the boss you
[48:22] work hard hard for the boss
[48:24] and then you're wiped out you could
[48:26] barely keep your eye open for bible
[48:28] study
[48:28] you could barely make it to our service
[48:32] you're there you're on two percent but
[48:34] 98 going
[48:35] 90 you're you're there breathless
[48:37] breathless going to work
[48:38] early early in the morning you're doing
[48:40] this you're doing that and and your car
[48:41] find you when it's time to report for
[48:43] god
[48:46] so we would have spent time in our last
[48:49] bible study coming offered by robert's
[48:51] message
[48:52] going into the that this was the first
[48:55] time a
[48:56] major offering was picked up in
[48:57] scripture was for the
[48:59] first tabernacle and for the what he
[49:01] pre-sat away and
[49:03] we went into extensive detail in that
[49:05] period there between exodus 25 as we
[49:07] know all up to exodus 35 and
[49:09] we spent some time in there so i don't
[49:10] want to spend too much time there all
[49:12] right
[49:12] now we're at a different junction in
[49:14] scripture
[49:16] this is no longer the tabernacle now in
[49:18] the desert
[49:19] but this is now first chronicles 29
[49:22] in first chronicles 28 gore will be
[49:25] telling david david
[49:26] i know your desire to build a temple
[49:30] but you have too much blood on your
[49:31] hands your son solomon
[49:35] i will put it in his responsibility to
[49:37] build temple anybody remember that
[49:40] so i want to now see the context here
[49:43] and when i saw this my mind was blown
[49:47] and i would tell any part that really
[49:48] blew my mind about perspective here
[49:51] all right so let's go first chronicles
[49:53] 29 we're going to take it from from
[49:54] verse 1.
[49:56] furthermore david the king said unto all
[49:58] the congregation
[50:01] solomon my son whom alone
[50:05] god had chosen is yet young and tender
[50:09] and the work is great for the palace is
[50:13] not
[50:13] for man but for the lord god
[50:17] now this is david speaking all right
[50:21] now i have prepared with all my might
[50:24] for the house of my god the gold
[50:28] for things to be made of gold and the
[50:31] silver
[50:32] for things of silver and the brass
[50:36] for things of brass the iron for things
[50:39] of iron
[50:40] though and wood for things of wood you
[50:43] recall when we
[50:44] we were in exodus it almost sounds a
[50:46] little similar
[50:47] it had different colors different
[50:49] elements but there's a pattern
[50:51] that is unfolding here that's very
[50:52] similar to inexodus right
[50:55] onyx stones and stones to be set
[50:58] glistering stones and of diverse colors
[51:01] and all manner of precious stones and
[51:03] marble stones in abundance
[51:07] moreover and this is one of the things
[51:10] that i didn't touch me
[51:11] because i have set my affection
[51:14] to the house of god
[51:18] where have you set your affection
[51:23] what are you affectionate about
[51:29] in the amplified that is said moreover
[51:31] because i delight in the house of my god
[51:38] and this way you think a little bit
[51:39] we'll keep you there just with your
[51:41] point a little bit and ask a question to
[51:42] prove you
[51:43] moreover because i have set my affection
[51:46] to the house of god this is the same
[51:47] david man after gone on heart this is
[51:49] david
[51:50] we know david
[51:53] moreover because i have set my affection
[51:55] to the house of my god
[51:58] i have no i are trying to move on from
[52:01] here
[52:02] but a lot of people their affection is
[52:03] not the house of god you know
[52:07] they're affectionately things of god you
[52:08] know
[52:10] they're not bothered with what happens
[52:11] with the kingdom you know
[52:19] can this be said because this is in
[52:22] scripture when you
[52:23] when you meet david david will have the
[52:26] same testimony
[52:28] i set my affection to the house of god i
[52:31] set my affection
[52:32] to the people of god i set my affection
[52:35] to the things of god
[52:36] can people say that about you
[52:40] not church people or anybody
[52:44] if i go to your closest friend and ask
[52:46] them what is brother so and so
[52:47] passionate about
[52:48] what do you think he set his affection
[52:50] to
[52:52] what will people say about you
[52:56] i want what is the thing about it it is
[52:58] you know these bibles are
[53:00] reflective movement are you selected for
[53:02] me when i see this i say but wait a
[53:04] minute
[53:04] can somebody say i have set my affection
[53:07] to the house of god to the kingdom of
[53:09] god to the people of god to the service
[53:11] of the lord to the care of these saints
[53:13] for the edification of the
[53:15] body
[53:19] to fighting for truth and clarity and
[53:21] present tense
[53:22] the gospel in a way that people's lives
[53:24] can be changed and impacted and
[53:26] for the unity of the faith and for some
[53:28] doctrine
[53:31] it can't just be words only to us it
[53:34] can't be our agenda what we're trying to
[53:36] achieve
[53:37] but i want to build into perspective
[53:39] because many of us
[53:41] and and you'll see by the time we get to
[53:43] the end of this service
[53:44] everything is connected and everything
[53:46] matters
[53:48] and i don't want to be guilty of a
[53:50] little thing or a small thing that could
[53:51] have been fixed
[53:52] because i wasn't looking at it the right
[53:54] way listen to david
[53:57] moreover because i have set my affection
[54:00] to the house of my god
[54:01] i have of my own proper good
[54:04] so david is saying of my own stuff
[54:08] of gold and silver which i have given to
[54:11] the house of my god
[54:13] over and above all that i have prepared
[54:16] for the holy house
[54:19] so david is saying of his own of his own
[54:22] substance he going over and above what
[54:25] he has already prepared
[54:26] for the holy house
[54:30] and david goes on to explain what he
[54:32] david is
[54:33] giving even three thousand talents of
[54:36] gold
[54:37] of gold of ophir and seven thousand
[54:41] talents of refined silver
[54:43] to overlay the walls of the houses with
[54:45] all
[54:46] the gold for things of gold and the
[54:49] silver
[54:50] for things of silver and for all manner
[54:52] of work to be made by the hands of
[54:54] artifices
[54:56] and who then listen now is willing to
[55:00] consecrate
[55:01] his service this day unto the lord
[55:04] so david is all about the temple now
[55:06] this is the temple and the temple we're
[55:08] talking about
[55:09] the temple
[55:12] and he challenges now he asked a
[55:14] question who then is willing to
[55:16] consecrate his services day unto the
[55:18] lord
[55:18] again he acted about three things there
[55:20] disservice
[55:21] time talent treasure
[55:25] and here we speak in treasure
[55:30] verse six then the chief
[55:33] of the fathers and princes of the tribes
[55:37] of israel you see whole as well now
[55:39] and the captains of thousands and of
[55:41] hundreds
[55:42] with the rulers of the king's work
[55:45] offered willingly note this word
[55:48] willingly
[55:49] we touch his word willingly in genesis
[55:51] in exodus as well with people who
[55:53] they were not willing and moses was
[55:55] calling for the people who willing
[55:57] and gave for the service of the house of
[56:00] god
[56:01] of gold 5000 talents and 10 000 drums
[56:05] and of silver 10 000 talents and of
[56:08] brass 18 000 talents
[56:10] and 100 000 talents of iron and there
[56:13] with whom precious stones were found
[56:15] gave them to the treasure
[56:17] of the house of the lord by the hand of
[56:20] jahil
[56:20] the gosha knight
[56:23] then the people rejoiced no you see this
[56:27] attitude here
[56:29] this is this is a revelation by itself
[56:32] so they give and they rejoice
[56:37] when last have you given and rejoiced
[56:40] it's a real question you know
[56:44] i want you to process this for a minute
[56:47] because somehow within the christian
[56:51] journey
[56:52] and the way of life and the pressures
[56:53] and the stress and stuff
[56:55] giving for many people feels more like a
[56:58] pain than a rejoicing thing
[57:04] listen i know few people can teach this
[57:07] few people can teach this
[57:13] giving is like a and people could could
[57:16] make it as a p as if it's a
[57:18] how how willing you know but you know
[57:20] deep down if you could really rejoice
[57:24] because if in you trying to give you
[57:26] don't have a rejoice in giving it
[57:28] because you understand why and how and
[57:30] what not just the blessing you will get
[57:32] but what god is looking for
[57:34] you denying yourself blessing including
[57:37] spiritual blessings including desires if
[57:39] we had and we'll get to it
[57:42] then the people rejoice listen for that
[57:45] they offered willingly
[57:48] because with perfect heart they offered
[57:51] willingly to the lord
[57:53] and david the king also rejoiced with
[57:56] great joy
[57:58] so the people were rejoicing because
[58:00] they were offering willingly
[58:02] with a perfect heart they offered
[58:04] willingly to the lord
[58:06] and david who started the ball rolling
[58:08] who was already saying his heart is set
[58:10] to the things of god was rejoicing
[58:12] because he realized the people
[58:14] were also genuine with their giving
[58:17] no hear me tonight i ain't talking about
[58:21] quantity of giving are dealing with
[58:24] quality of giving
[58:28] we might have to do our next teaching on
[58:29] quantity but right now we deliver
[58:32] quality the
[58:33] spirit of giving the willingness of
[58:35] giving
[58:36] the approach to giving time talent and
[58:38] treasure
[58:39] now this is where i want to come to now
[58:42] i even reached a pattern
[58:43] i still trying to reach where i'm going
[58:44] right
[58:47] verse 10 wherefore this is no afternoon
[58:51] rejoicing
[58:52] friends tonight if you look into
[58:55] unlocked blessings
[58:57] take this to heart study it meditate on
[59:00] it
[59:00] relook at your life look at what god
[59:03] said we'll look at the word
[59:04] and see how it applies to you
[59:07] go listen back to the first lesson on
[59:09] this connect it to this
[59:10] because i don't have to read and spell
[59:13] you need to understand
[59:14] god works by principles and the
[59:16] principles have existed for a very long
[59:18] time
[59:20] wherefore david blessed the lord before
[59:23] all the congregation
[59:25] and david said blessed be thou
[59:28] lord god of israel our father
[59:32] forever and ever
[59:35] verse 11 thine oh lord is the greatness
[59:41] and the power and the glory
[59:46] and the victory and the majesty
[59:50] can we just say that one more time thine
[59:53] oh lord is the greatness
[59:55] and the power and the glory
[59:58] and the victory and the majesty is that
[1:00:01] your testimony that you know the lord is
[1:00:04] great
[1:00:05] and powerful and glorious and victorious
[1:00:07] and majesty
[1:00:10] listen to david's perspective for
[1:00:13] all that is in the heaven and in the
[1:00:15] earth is thine
[1:00:17] thine is the kingdom oh lord
[1:00:21] and thou art exalted as head above all
[1:00:25] this is one of the few places in
[1:00:27] scripture
[1:00:28] that positions giving in a way that
[1:00:32] blows your mind
[1:00:35] both verse 12 both riches and honor come
[1:00:39] of thee
[1:00:41] so whatever you have is not your doing
[1:00:45] can i say that one more time whatever
[1:00:48] you have is not your doing
[1:00:50] both riches and honor come of thee
[1:00:53] and the reiness overall and in thine
[1:00:57] hand
[1:00:57] is power and might and in thine hand it
[1:01:00] is to make great
[1:01:02] and to give strength unto all
[1:01:05] now therefore our god we thank thee and
[1:01:08] praise thy
[1:01:09] glorious name anybody with me this here
[1:01:12] is the scripture that matched me up
[1:01:17] david is saying but who am i
[1:01:21] and what is my people
[1:01:24] that we should be able to offer so
[1:01:26] willingly
[1:01:27] after this sort
[1:01:31] so david just gave this huge offering
[1:01:35] and all the people follow willingly and
[1:01:37] excitedly
[1:01:38] and david is now praying and david is
[1:01:41] asking
[1:01:41] god a question and this is the question
[1:01:45] that i think if we begin to operate like
[1:01:47] david
[1:01:48] and we look at how god entreated malachi
[1:01:51] with your approach to offering and
[1:01:52] sacrifice and
[1:01:54] all of that tying talent and treasure
[1:01:56] captured on all of that
[1:01:58] david is saying after the giving this is
[1:02:01] after they have come there you say but
[1:02:02] who am i and what is my people
[1:02:06] that we should be able to offer so
[1:02:08] willingly after this sort
[1:02:10] for all things come of thee
[1:02:13] and of thine own have we given thee
[1:02:17] now you see this right here this
[1:02:20] should set everybody free because if god
[1:02:23] is saying
[1:02:24] give and it will come back to you bless
[1:02:27] and you'll get blessed
[1:02:28] it is better to give than to receive and
[1:02:30] all these things and
[1:02:31] we operate from a selfish standpoint
[1:02:34] that we
[1:02:34] earned it we worked for it we did it we
[1:02:38] acquired it
[1:02:38] it was my labor it was my effort and and
[1:02:42] i and they telling me i had to give
[1:02:43] something and i want to
[1:02:45] david is saying but wait a wave who am i
[1:02:48] and what is my people
[1:02:49] that we should be able to offer so
[1:02:51] willingly after this sort
[1:02:53] means of this abundance for all things
[1:02:55] come of thee so david is recognizing
[1:02:58] and acknowledging that what he had he
[1:03:00] didn't earn he didn't make
[1:03:02] he didn't work because whatever you say
[1:03:04] you worked if god didn't wake up this
[1:03:05] morning you couldn't work
[1:03:06] whatever you say you do if god didn't
[1:03:08] give you strength to do it you couldn't
[1:03:10] do
[1:03:10] whatever job you have if god didn't give
[1:03:12] any job you wouldn't have the job
[1:03:13] so david is saying for all things come
[1:03:16] of thee and
[1:03:17] of thine own we have given thee so
[1:03:20] david is saying but wait a minute we
[1:03:22] actually given to god what is already
[1:03:24] his
[1:03:26] ole catch that anybody seen that
[1:03:33] listen verse 15
[1:03:37] for we are strangers before thee answer
[1:03:40] journals
[1:03:41] as were all our fathers our days on the
[1:03:44] earth are as a shadow and there is none
[1:03:47] abiding
[1:03:50] our lord our god all this store
[1:03:54] that we have prepared to build thee and
[1:03:56] house for thine holy name
[1:03:58] comet of dine han and is all thine own
[1:04:03] so david is saying lord this store he
[1:04:07] david actually this is what david felt
[1:04:10] unworthy
[1:04:12] no there's a whole next perspective on
[1:04:14] offering
[1:04:16] david is there saying well you know
[1:04:18] because you have people who take the
[1:04:19] approach well
[1:04:20] i give something to the lord i give
[1:04:21] something to the church and it's i do it
[1:04:24] i give it it's mine it was mine to give
[1:04:27] i make a choice to give david not
[1:04:28] approaching it so you know
[1:04:30] david's saying i'm not even worried to
[1:04:31] bring this offering
[1:04:34] because yours to begin with lord
[1:04:37] everything is yours i don't even know
[1:04:40] why you're accepting it because it's
[1:04:41] yours
[1:04:42] i'm acknowledging you as the source of
[1:04:44] it all so it's out of yours that you
[1:04:46] have given me
[1:04:47] is utter yours be giving you listen all
[1:04:50] this store we have prepared to build
[1:04:52] here now look at the attitude
[1:04:55] look at the approach look at the
[1:04:57] difference
[1:04:59] look at the mindset this is scripture we
[1:05:02] read in scripture
[1:05:05] we are prepared to build your house and
[1:05:07] holding him comet
[1:05:08] of thine hand and is all thine own
[1:05:12] listen now to verse 17 i know also my
[1:05:15] god
[1:05:15] that thou has tried the heart and has
[1:05:18] pleasure in uprightness
[1:05:20] here the man that god will call a man
[1:05:22] after his ordinance beginner
[1:05:24] i know also my god that don't try is the
[1:05:27] heart
[1:05:28] the heart is going after you know
[1:05:33] and has pleasure and uprightness as for
[1:05:35] me
[1:05:37] in the uprightness of my heart i have
[1:05:40] willingly
[1:05:41] offered all these things
[1:05:45] and now have i seen with joy thy people
[1:05:48] which are present here to offer
[1:05:51] willingly unto thee
[1:05:52] i want you to know the parallel in this
[1:05:55] willingness here in david
[1:05:56] and building of the temple and what was
[1:05:58] offered to the kingdom i want to
[1:05:59] parallel it with exodus i want you to
[1:06:01] parallel it with poor
[1:06:03] experience i want you parallel
[1:06:05] throughout scripture
[1:06:08] are you a willing giver
[1:06:12] do you understand that nothing you have
[1:06:14] is yours and it's god's
[1:06:15] and you are steward gorgeous have you
[1:06:18] managing
[1:06:19] his stuff or anybody with me tonight
[1:06:22] it reframes you thinking you know
[1:06:25] because if god recognized that you can't
[1:06:27] manage his stuff he can't give you water
[1:06:29] manage
[1:06:29] oh come on i'm gonna push and a lot of
[1:06:32] christians tell me in a message in
[1:06:33] particular they want a financial
[1:06:35] breakthrough
[1:06:36] if you can't manage the little that god
[1:06:39] gives you from his stuff
[1:06:40] how you want god to give you more
[1:06:42] because the stuff you want coming from
[1:06:44] him
[1:06:45] or you don't hear me tonight
[1:06:48] this is not pentecostal teaching this is
[1:06:50] bible teaching
[1:06:52] because if you understand that
[1:06:54] everything is god and belongs to god and
[1:06:56] we are stewards
[1:06:58] and we are being measured evaluated
[1:07:01] performance review
[1:07:02] hr review come into the office and
[1:07:04] explain to god
[1:07:06] how you spend your time how you use your
[1:07:08] talent how you use your treasure
[1:07:10] and david is coming to that realization
[1:07:12] but wait a minute who am i
[1:07:15] to even give these things i is nobody to
[1:07:18] give it
[1:07:19] because it wasn't mine in the first
[1:07:20] place it's out of your in other words we
[1:07:22] going in god's bank
[1:07:24] and giving god from inside e-bank and
[1:07:26] transferring in his account
[1:07:27] into company transfer that's what david
[1:07:31] is saying here
[1:07:32] anybody with me anybody with me
[1:07:36] so it's not your time it is not your
[1:07:39] talent
[1:07:39] it is not your treasure
[1:07:43] you are accessing god's time
[1:07:46] the talent you have is his talent the
[1:07:48] treasure you have is his treasure
[1:07:51] and god wants you to give him from what
[1:07:53] is his own
[1:07:54] anybody with me anybody who understands
[1:07:58] these scriptures will never have a
[1:08:00] problem
[1:08:01] given offering paying tights all night
[1:08:04] prayer meeting you will never have an
[1:08:05] issue
[1:08:08] never have a problem because that is
[1:08:09] bible teaching
[1:08:14] let me let me go on assuming verse 17
[1:08:17] i know also my god that thou tries the
[1:08:21] heart
[1:08:23] and has pleasure in uprightness as for
[1:08:26] me
[1:08:26] in the uprightness of my heart i have
[1:08:29] willingly
[1:08:30] offered all these things and now i have
[1:08:33] seen with joy
[1:08:35] by people which are present here to
[1:08:38] offer willingly unto thee
[1:08:41] oh lord god of abraham isaac and of
[1:08:44] israel our fathers
[1:08:45] listen this here is so precious
[1:08:49] he said keep this forever in the
[1:08:52] imagination
[1:08:54] of the thoughts of the heart of thy
[1:08:56] people and prepare
[1:08:58] their heart unto thee so he say keep
[1:09:01] this
[1:09:01] forever what is it the willingness of
[1:09:04] giving
[1:09:05] will it catch that the understanding
[1:09:09] that everything belongs to god
[1:09:13] the understanding that everything is his
[1:09:17] his david counted this revelation to be
[1:09:20] a precious revelation
[1:09:24] he said keep this forever in the
[1:09:27] imagination
[1:09:29] of the thoughts of the heart of thy
[1:09:32] people
[1:09:34] forever and prepare their heart unto
[1:09:36] thee
[1:09:39] and give unto solomon my son a perfect
[1:09:41] heart to keep thy commandments
[1:09:43] thy testimonies and thy statutes and to
[1:09:45] do all these things
[1:09:46] and to build a palace for the which i
[1:09:48] have been provisioned
[1:09:51] and david said to all the congregation
[1:09:53] now bless the lord your god
[1:09:54] and all the congregation bless the lord
[1:09:56] god of their fathers and
[1:09:58] bow down their heads and worship the
[1:09:59] lord and the king and the sacrifice
[1:10:01] sacrifices unto the lord this whole
[1:10:04] chapter is about sacrifice
[1:10:07] before now they go they went from
[1:10:08] natural sacrifice to now
[1:10:10] spiritual sacrifice look how god wrapped
[1:10:13] it together
[1:10:15] and they sacrificed sacrifices unto the
[1:10:18] lord
[1:10:18] and offered burnt offerings unto the
[1:10:20] lord on tomorrow after that day
[1:10:23] even a thousand bullocks a thousand rams
[1:10:25] and a thousand lambs
[1:10:27] with their drink offerings and
[1:10:28] sacrifices in abundance of all israel
[1:10:31] and did eat and drink before the lord on
[1:10:34] that day with great gladness
[1:10:36] and they made solomon the son of david
[1:10:38] king the second time
[1:10:40] and anointed him unto the lord to be the
[1:10:43] chief governor
[1:10:44] and zadok to be priests
[1:10:49] anybody with me so we're building
[1:10:53] time talent treasure given the quality
[1:10:56] of your given
[1:10:57] we say god saying malacca i reject what
[1:10:59] you give because you give it any all you
[1:11:00] want you give it you bring whatever you
[1:11:02] want you throw it there you do it
[1:11:03] or how and here we see david a whole
[1:11:05] different approach
[1:11:06] willingly recognizing the lord i've
[1:11:08] given you what is the even mind to give
[1:11:10] is yours
[1:11:16] i hope somebody gets some help tonight
[1:11:20] and i'm touching three areas here
[1:11:22] friends time
[1:11:24] talent and treasure we are responsible
[1:11:28] for all three
[1:11:30] you have people who like to give one and
[1:11:32] two are going after
[1:11:34] all three your time
[1:11:42] you have people who there there are
[1:11:45] people who have a problem paying tithes
[1:11:46] they're paying attention but
[1:11:47] you don't see them giving time to the
[1:11:49] lord you know
[1:11:52] these are the people who feel they could
[1:11:54] they could peer their way into heaven
[1:11:59] so ties an offering they sanitize an
[1:12:02] offering but
[1:12:03] you can't find them in a prayer meeting
[1:12:04] you can't find them
[1:12:06] you can't find them helping nobody they
[1:12:08] don't know time and talent no it's
[1:12:10] theirs
[1:12:11] because for them their time is precious
[1:12:14] oh come on
[1:12:15] i'm going in i'm starting to but over do
[1:12:17] i have permission i try
[1:12:18] to push in i'm trying to drive down this
[1:12:20] road here
[1:12:24] so for some people titan offering is
[1:12:26] fine that that is not an issue for them
[1:12:30] but tell them let's go visit somebody
[1:12:32] tell them let's go help tell them
[1:12:34] let's do something tell them let's clean
[1:12:35] the church afterwards oh oh no
[1:12:38] don't ask that
[1:12:47] time and talent for them is the problem
[1:12:50] you have those
[1:12:51] time and talent is is is is
[1:12:54] it's finding the title they they
[1:12:57] they're working it out for the lord on
[1:12:59] on effort on labor
[1:13:08] anybody with me we're trying to bring it
[1:13:10] together in context of the word now all
[1:13:11] right cool
[1:13:12] great great anybody with me all right
[1:13:16] so let's let's move on a little bit
[1:13:22] i will have to skip a whole section
[1:13:23] because i don't have too much time
[1:13:26] tonight but i want to get to one of the
[1:13:29] most interesting pieces of scripture and
[1:13:31] i'll close up with this and i'm going to
[1:13:32] tie it to the prophet now
[1:13:35] and this one also
[1:13:38] because friends we have been doing bible
[1:13:40] study for some time
[1:13:42] and you realize perspective matters
[1:13:44] right when you read a scripture
[1:13:46] and and you read it in isolation and you
[1:13:48] don't get any perspective
[1:13:50] it's there but when you get it you get a
[1:13:51] whole perspective all right so
[1:13:54] i want to go to the book of saint mark
[1:14:01] so we're going now to to jesus and a
[1:14:04] specific context here
[1:14:06] in scripture and if you want to tie it
[1:14:09] to the prophet
[1:14:11] to close out tonight i trust this has
[1:14:12] been a blessing to you
[1:14:14] and encouragement to you in some way
[1:14:20] so jesus has given parables in saint
[1:14:22] mark
[1:14:26] and
[1:14:29] in mark 12 41
[1:14:35] we find jesus in a very interesting
[1:14:37] position the first thing i would define
[1:14:38] is jesus is position
[1:14:40] and this is what brings this whole
[1:14:42] teaching tonight
[1:14:44] to a point about quality
[1:14:47] one would expect or one would assume
[1:14:51] or one would think that if jesus
[1:14:54] is interested in observing people's
[1:14:58] behavior
[1:14:59] around the temple one would think jesus
[1:15:03] might go by the prayer altar
[1:15:06] and see people praying
[1:15:10] in fact he addressed the issue of
[1:15:12] praying you see praying in secret which
[1:15:14] is praying lord he
[1:15:15] he would he would highlight this thing
[1:15:17] so he was clearly conscious
[1:15:20] everybody with me still he's clearly
[1:15:22] conscious that people has been praying
[1:15:24] and they're praying for appearances and
[1:15:25] these kind of things and you know
[1:15:28] there are so many things jesus could do
[1:15:30] with his time there's so many places he
[1:15:32] could go
[1:15:34] people will come to the temple for
[1:15:37] different reasons
[1:15:39] one would think that jesus would spend
[1:15:41] time maybe looking to see somebody
[1:15:42] praying for a need
[1:15:44] doing different things and but sin mark
[1:15:48] has jesus doing something very
[1:15:50] interesting
[1:15:53] the bible says since in mark 12 41
[1:15:57] and jesus sat over against the treasury
[1:16:03] time talent and treasurer so now we're
[1:16:05] going from treasure to treasury
[1:16:08] jesus sat over i want you to picture
[1:16:09] this i want you to picture this
[1:16:12] jesus said that over again the treasury
[1:16:15] and beheld how the people cast money
[1:16:19] into the treasury i want to pause right
[1:16:21] there for a minute
[1:16:24] i want to picture the scene people going
[1:16:26] into the temple
[1:16:29] and jesus by now he's known this is not
[1:16:32] jesus unknown
[1:16:34] jesus at that point of time is not in
[1:16:36] the temple praying
[1:16:38] jesus is not there praying for people
[1:16:41] jesus is not there doing anything that
[1:16:42] it would seem
[1:16:43] to be spiritual and jesus of all the
[1:16:45] places he would go
[1:16:48] positions himself and sits down watching
[1:16:51] people come and put money into the
[1:16:53] treasury
[1:17:00] could you imagine
[1:17:05] i know few people have ever looked at it
[1:17:07] this way
[1:17:10] i want to imagine what would it be like
[1:17:12] if jesus was walking around with the
[1:17:13] offering container because that is
[1:17:15] pretty much the same thing
[1:17:16] in the context here here it is jesus
[1:17:18] sitting down just watching people
[1:17:20] putting money
[1:17:21] into the treasury and the bible says and
[1:17:25] many that were rich cast in much
[1:17:28] so jesus is watching the actions he's
[1:17:30] taking note
[1:17:31] he's watching what is going on this is a
[1:17:34] system that he built
[1:17:37] hundreds and hundreds of years ago and
[1:17:40] instead of looking from afar
[1:17:42] looking from him glory he is no one
[1:17:44] earth and he's opera he's watching the
[1:17:46] operations
[1:17:48] and the bible says in verse 42 and there
[1:17:50] came a certain poor widow
[1:17:52] and she threw in two mites which make a
[1:17:55] fathing
[1:17:57] our father is like a one cent piece so
[1:18:03] and this so blew jesus mind
[1:18:08] it blew jesus mind completely because to
[1:18:10] this point he
[1:18:11] would have had no conversation with his
[1:18:14] disciples
[1:18:16] but when he saw this he called his
[1:18:18] disciples the bible said in verse 43
[1:18:20] and he called on to his disciples
[1:18:22] because it was the first thing that was
[1:18:24] worthy of bringing to their attention
[1:18:28] nothing that happened before
[1:18:31] was noteworthy was what a message
[1:18:35] a text a tweet a call his disciples
[1:18:37] there just wondering why jesus is there
[1:18:40] and there jesus sit and watch and then
[1:18:41] this one where the woman comes throws in
[1:18:44] two mites which is a farthing and jesus
[1:18:47] actually calls his disciples and see it
[1:18:50] unto them
[1:18:51] verily i say unto you that this poor
[1:18:54] widow had cast more in than
[1:18:57] all day which have cast into the
[1:19:00] treasury
[1:19:01] for all they did cast in of the
[1:19:04] abundance
[1:19:06] but she of her want her want meaning
[1:19:09] her desire her choosing her willingness
[1:19:13] anybody with me she of her willingness
[1:19:16] she of her desire
[1:19:20] caused in all that she had even all her
[1:19:23] living
[1:19:28] no i don't know how you want to
[1:19:31] personally process this
[1:19:33] but this is jesus himself giving not a
[1:19:36] teaching
[1:19:37] as a parable this was not a parable
[1:19:41] jesus was giving parables but this was
[1:19:43] not a parable
[1:19:45] this was jesus sitting on watching the
[1:19:48] human condition
[1:19:50] and seeing the people who had giving of
[1:19:53] what they have but this woman
[1:19:55] give more than all they did because she
[1:19:58] wanted to do it
[1:19:59] and she had a desire to do it and she
[1:20:02] gave more than they did
[1:20:06] she gave all that she had to live on i'm
[1:20:08] not saying give all i have to live on
[1:20:11] but i'm just showing what jesus was
[1:20:13] taking note of
[1:20:14] and i'm going to get ready to close with
[1:20:15] this a familiar
[1:20:18] story we all know it
[1:20:24] brother branham this
[1:20:28] is from the message my new ministry
[1:20:32] we are familiar with it but
[1:20:36] i trust you i've heard of the butterfly
[1:20:38] effect scientists refer to the butterfly
[1:20:41] effect
[1:20:42] oh one action somewhere else in the
[1:20:44] world let's say a butterfly flaps its
[1:20:46] wings
[1:20:47] in africa could create a storm or a
[1:20:50] hurricane in the park you will because
[1:20:52] there's a ripple effect
[1:20:54] sometimes we don't know how things
[1:20:56] connect all right
[1:20:58] so i want you to see how this thing
[1:21:00] connected for this one experience here
[1:21:02] in brother brown's ministry brother
[1:21:05] branham in my new ministry
[1:21:07] sister hattie wright all of you know
[1:21:11] we call her right her name is mosey but
[1:21:14] she has been a loyal person
[1:21:16] a little old housewife lives in two
[1:21:18] rooms
[1:21:19] a way back into the hills out there with
[1:21:22] a shovel and a hole trying to
[1:21:24] hold the cockle bulls out of the corn
[1:21:26] part so like in agriculture trying to
[1:21:28] cut all the weeds from the corn patch to
[1:21:29] keep a little family together
[1:21:31] she has worked faithfully but abandoned
[1:21:34] goes on now listen don't miss this
[1:21:36] show you the sovereignty of god now
[1:21:39] while we were talking so we would recall
[1:21:41] that brother branham
[1:21:42] would have shared with sister hattie
[1:21:44] wright or in the presence of sisterhati
[1:21:47] right his experience with the squirrels
[1:21:49] when his spirits were created all right
[1:21:51] students of
[1:21:52] scripture any message would know this
[1:21:54] right so listen to this here
[1:21:57] now listen don't miss this now i'm
[1:21:58] reading show you the sovereign
[1:22:00] sovereignty of god
[1:22:01] now while we are we were talking i said
[1:22:03] i want to ask you something
[1:22:05] what put those squirrels there there's
[1:22:08] no squirrels in the woods i had hunted
[1:22:10] and hunted and i'm not the best of
[1:22:12] hunter
[1:22:13] but i've hunted since i was a little boy
[1:22:15] and i had hunted close and they were in
[1:22:17] the most
[1:22:18] ridiculous place and in the most
[1:22:20] ridiculous way i could call them
[1:22:22] i said what put them there so but the
[1:22:25] brandon was
[1:22:25] sharing you see in all his years of
[1:22:27] experience hunting
[1:22:29] them squirrels that he end up shooting
[1:22:31] it had to come from somewhere else
[1:22:32] because that is not
[1:22:34] where they would usually be the way it
[1:22:35] was was different right
[1:22:38] but ivan said i said i wonder if it is
[1:22:40] that my ministry fixing to take a change
[1:22:43] that the god of abraham is confirming
[1:22:45] his promise as he did to abraham
[1:22:47] when he was up on top of the mount and
[1:22:49] he needed a sacrifice for instead of his
[1:22:51] son
[1:22:52] jehovah jared performed a miracle and
[1:22:54] placed a ram a hundred miles back
[1:22:56] he was three days journey and any
[1:22:59] ordinary man can walk 25 miles a day
[1:23:01] then he lifted up his eyes and saw the
[1:23:03] mountain of fire off and then went to
[1:23:05] the mountain
[1:23:06] and went on and topped the mountain
[1:23:07] while ram back in their sheep wild
[1:23:10] animals
[1:23:10] would have killed it and then up on top
[1:23:12] of the mountain where there's no water
[1:23:14] how did that ram get up there what
[1:23:16] happened god needed a sacrifice
[1:23:19] to prove to abraham that he was jehovah
[1:23:21] jireh the very god of creation spoke
[1:23:24] aram into existence
[1:23:25] no it wasn't even a vision he killed the
[1:23:27] ram and blood came out of that animal
[1:23:30] it wasn't a vision it was a ram i said
[1:23:33] that same god hallelujah that jehovah
[1:23:35] jireh
[1:23:36] he's just as much jehovah jared today as
[1:23:38] he was on the mount with abraham
[1:23:40] can the church say amen but if branham
[1:23:43] clapped his hands three times
[1:23:46] he can still produce an animal to his
[1:23:47] glory these curls was not a vision
[1:23:50] i shot them blood came out of them i
[1:23:53] dressed them and eat them
[1:23:54] there wasn't visions they were squirrels
[1:23:56] i said that same jehovah gyra
[1:23:59] trying to get his promise over to me in
[1:24:01] my thickness
[1:24:02] and dollars of mine he could speak my
[1:24:05] need into existence
[1:24:06] the same as he could speak abraham's
[1:24:08] need into existence
[1:24:10] all right so listen brother bran i'm
[1:24:11] finishing he's sharing this
[1:24:13] in that room let's go
[1:24:16] i know more than said that until sister
[1:24:18] hat is sitting there crying
[1:24:21] no hasn't said a word
[1:24:26] so but abandonment is sharing it and
[1:24:27] it's having an impact on sister hattie
[1:24:31] and she said that's nothing but the
[1:24:33] truth
[1:24:35] but ibrahim goes on she said the writing
[1:24:38] she said just like bang said down there
[1:24:40] i heard her voice
[1:24:42] as it swept from my ears like up into
[1:24:44] the woods
[1:24:48] and that super annoying thing that adam
[1:24:50] said swept over me
[1:24:52] said tell hattie that she has found
[1:24:53] grace in the sight of god
[1:24:56] who would have thought said tell her to
[1:24:58] ask whatever she will
[1:25:00] then you speak it by this gift into
[1:25:02] existence
[1:25:03] whatever she asks it speak it into
[1:25:05] existence
[1:25:07] i look to sister hati the first time it
[1:25:09] was ever performed in a human being
[1:25:11] i said sister hattie ask what you will
[1:25:14] god is going to give it to you my
[1:25:18] that that's powerful her friends
[1:25:22] what do you think of that congregation
[1:25:23] says amen does it get into you
[1:25:26] seven times he had confirmed it all
[1:25:28] right ask what you will hating that to
[1:25:30] me brother branham what do you mean
[1:25:33] i said ask anything your heart desires
[1:25:35] and it shall be produced right here
[1:25:38] that you will know that the lord god of
[1:25:40] heaven answers and his scriptures
[1:25:42] are true but abandonment said he's
[1:25:45] sharing now because he's preaching this
[1:25:46] whole thing right
[1:25:47] in the pulpit my first time with a new
[1:25:49] gift my first anointing
[1:25:51] i could hardly hear and she looked
[1:25:53] around
[1:25:55] we had been talking about her little
[1:25:56] crippled sister
[1:25:58] i said oh no doubt in my heart within a
[1:26:00] few minutes
[1:26:01] little eat it will be jumping to the
[1:26:03] glory of god
[1:26:07] hattie looked around all around and she
[1:26:10] said brother bill
[1:26:11] my greatest desire is for the salvation
[1:26:14] of my two boys
[1:26:17] whether why there couldn't have been a
[1:26:19] greater thing she could have
[1:26:20] asked for ten thousand dollars she would
[1:26:23] have got it
[1:26:25] what if it would have been some
[1:26:26] millionaire who would have asked for
[1:26:28] another million
[1:26:30] god knowed what she was going to ask for
[1:26:35] everybody with me we're getting ready to
[1:26:37] close out now
[1:26:39] sister hearty at least seven or eight
[1:26:41] witnesses standing there
[1:26:43] all you people that was present when
[1:26:44] that happened raise up your hands so but
[1:26:45] at random is sharing this and the people
[1:26:47] in the church who were there when it
[1:26:48] happened
[1:26:49] all right ask anything you want cause
[1:26:51] god has given to me to give to you
[1:26:52] whatever you want
[1:26:54] she said her voice was beginning to go
[1:26:56] off on the
[1:26:57] on the teenage tantrum and she said the
[1:27:00] salvation
[1:27:01] of my two boys i said by the will of god
[1:27:05] by the power of god i give you in the
[1:27:08] name of jesus christ your desire
[1:27:11] and her two boys shook under the power
[1:27:14] of god
[1:27:15] and that whole building trembled my my
[1:27:18] my mind banks fell into his plate
[1:27:22] shelby grabbed and had his scream till
[1:27:24] you could hear her
[1:27:25] for two blocks
[1:27:29] and then two boys with tears rolling
[1:27:31] down their cheeks
[1:27:32] receive exactly what they asked for
[1:27:34] right then oh
[1:27:37] the first time it was ever used on a
[1:27:39] human being
[1:27:41] ask what you will and a child be giving
[1:27:42] on to you her boy sitting there with her
[1:27:44] this morning
[1:27:47] what would she have asked for what if
[1:27:48] she would have asked the healing of a
[1:27:50] little sister
[1:27:51] what if she would have asked that that
[1:27:52] little girl would have been healed but
[1:27:54] her two boys lost what if
[1:27:56] but ibrahim is there he said what if and
[1:27:59] then but ibrahim says something
[1:28:00] mind-blowing and most people know that
[1:28:03] part
[1:28:04] but what is what about i'm saying right
[1:28:06] after that
[1:28:08] but ibrahim says what if he said that
[1:28:11] poor
[1:28:13] speaking widow my sister hattie and
[1:28:15] brother branham had spoken about it in
[1:28:17] another message before this message
[1:28:21] he said that poor widow who had just
[1:28:24] told me
[1:28:26] that she are trying to give to this
[1:28:27] church 50 on a pledge
[1:28:29] to help build a new church and brother
[1:28:32] robinson
[1:28:33] wouldn't take it and only let her give
[1:28:36] 20 of it and i said to myself when she
[1:28:39] was speaking
[1:28:40] i'll give her back the 20. so brother
[1:28:43] branham is saying that sister hattie
[1:28:45] was struggling financially she had come
[1:28:48] to the church
[1:28:49] and said she wanted a pledge fifty
[1:28:51] dollars one of the brothers says
[1:28:53] he's not gonna take it end up taking
[1:28:56] just 20.
[1:28:57] and brother branham also felt so bad
[1:29:00] about it
[1:29:01] that he says he want to give up back the
[1:29:03] 20 dollars
[1:29:05] i wanted to show you the prophet
[1:29:06] experience and how god is seeing and
[1:29:08] dealing with it with the prophet as well
[1:29:10] but god said to me in my heart now not
[1:29:12] no
[1:29:14] god said to me in my heart no not by
[1:29:15] vision in my heart when jesus
[1:29:18] and that's why i'm tying it back now so
[1:29:20] i want you to see the connection now
[1:29:21] between sisterhati's experience with the
[1:29:24] salvation of our two boys
[1:29:26] the fact that the prophet was even in
[1:29:27] our house in the first place
[1:29:29] the testimony by the banana was given a
[1:29:31] number that branham has taken
[1:29:33] this scenario back now to a root cause
[1:29:36] stuck our connection here
[1:29:38] but i said but god said to me in my
[1:29:40] heart now not by vision in my heart
[1:29:42] when jesus was standing watching a widow
[1:29:44] putting three pennies
[1:29:46] where there was thousands of dollars
[1:29:47] laying what would you have done
[1:29:49] so that's god speaking to the prophet in
[1:29:51] his heart i said well
[1:29:53] if i would have been standing there and
[1:29:55] i said we don't need it sister
[1:29:57] so brother branham is being sincere he
[1:29:59] said he would have said we don't need it
[1:30:03] we got plenty of money but jesus never
[1:30:05] said it
[1:30:06] he let her go on listen to the prophet
[1:30:08] no he let her go
[1:30:10] on and do it because he knowed
[1:30:13] what was down the road
[1:30:16] you heard that
[1:30:20] so let me bring it to our close now so
[1:30:23] help me
[1:30:24] god as my solemn judge
[1:30:27] god knew that was down the road for her
[1:30:32] so but a branham is now saying
[1:30:35] god knew all along when sister hattie
[1:30:38] was trying to make a little pledge the
[1:30:41] effort she'd been in that pledge
[1:30:42] what the blessing would have been that
[1:30:44] was tied to that
[1:30:47] let me bring it so close and i run my
[1:30:49] hand listen to the prophet
[1:30:51] and i run my hand in my pocket to get my
[1:30:54] pocketbook to give her
[1:30:55] her twenty dollars back and say sister
[1:30:57] hearty
[1:30:58] but he said but what i'm saying but
[1:31:00] he'll told him don't do it
[1:31:04] and then a few minutes when the question
[1:31:05] is brought up about jehovah gyra
[1:31:07] she said that's nothing but the truth
[1:31:09] and it comes from a poor widow woman's
[1:31:11] heart
[1:31:12] god knowing she'd ask the greatest thing
[1:31:15] that could be done
[1:31:16] as long as there's a heaven when the
[1:31:18] stars is gone
[1:31:20] when there's no more moon no more earth
[1:31:22] no more sea
[1:31:23] them boys shall live on true eternity
[1:31:26] with the same jehovah gyra
[1:31:28] who gave the immortal promise his
[1:31:30] promises cannot fail
[1:31:33] so friends i want to show tonight that
[1:31:36] many people don't connect that part of
[1:31:38] sister hattie right testimony her
[1:31:40] experience
[1:31:41] and what he prophet himself went through
[1:31:43] as a man in this day
[1:31:44] but here it was god dealing with the
[1:31:46] prophet but he also honoring sisterhati
[1:31:49] as he did that widow woman who jesus
[1:31:52] himself saw
[1:31:54] who he said give more than all those who
[1:31:56] give
[1:31:57] because she was willing to give so it
[1:31:58] shows that since the heart he had the
[1:32:00] right heart to begin with your right
[1:32:02] desires to begin with
[1:32:04] i'm finished tonight says bower heads
