[34:18] the men on the mios road
[34:20] that did not our heartburn within us
[34:22] amen
[34:24] so as i stand here i just want to read a
[34:25] scripture before i
[34:27] i end my greetings praise god ephesians
[34:30] chapter 2
[34:33] oh praise god when you speak of
[34:36] ephesians
[34:37] then you are speaking about me
[34:41] the gentile bride we are pleased right
[34:44] in this ephesians
[34:45] ephesians 2 verse
[34:49] 6 there he said here and had raised us
[34:52] up together and made us sit in heavenly
[34:56] places in christ jesus
[34:57] was paul talking to the church of
[34:59] ephesus that was not israel that was a
[35:01] gentile
[35:02] church and paul was talking to this
[35:04] gentile god has raised them
[35:06] up and made them sit in heavenly places
[35:09] in christ jesus
[35:10] and that's where i'm seated and that's
[35:12] where you are seated if you're a bride
[35:14] that in the ages to come he might show
[35:17] the exceeding riches of his grace
[35:19] in his kindness towards us through jesus
[35:22] christ
[35:23] and this is the time that god is showing
[35:25] them kindness
[35:27] to his people for by grace are you safe
[35:29] through faith
[35:30] that not of yourself it is the gift of
[35:33] god
[35:34] not of works lest any man should boast
[35:36] for we are his
[35:37] workmanship oh you church of the living
[35:41] god you bride of christ
[35:43] you gentile church in this efficient
[35:45] dispensation
[35:46] paul said you are his workmanship
[35:48] created in christ jesus
[35:50] unto good works which god had before
[35:54] ordained that we should walk in them
[35:58] wherefore remember that ye
[36:02] being in time past gentiles in the flesh
[36:06] who are called on circumcision by that
[36:09] which is called the circumcision in the
[36:11] flesh
[36:12] made by hands that at the time
[36:15] ye were without christ being aliens
[36:18] from the commonwealth of israel and
[36:21] strangers from
[36:22] from the covenants of promise having no
[36:25] hope
[36:26] and without god in the world but now in
[36:29] christ jesus
[36:30] you who sometimes were far off are made
[36:33] near
[36:34] by the blood of christ oh my may god
[36:38] bless the reading of his word
[36:40] so this dispensation of the of ephesians
[36:43] brings us near and closer
[36:47] to manifested sons of god it brings us
[36:49] to the position of manifested sons of
[36:51] god
[36:52] it brings us to christ jesus that's what
[36:55] paul is saying here amen
[36:57] oh it brings us to perfection this
[36:59] ephesians
[37:00] is preparing us into the rapture this
[37:02] dispensation
[37:04] is preparing us into the rapture the
[37:06] holy spirit is the leader in this
[37:07] dispensation
[37:08] it's not a church it's not a group of
[37:10] persons no but it's the holy spirit
[37:13] himself
[37:13] god himself filled himself in the fight
[37:16] for ministry
[37:17] leading the church to perfection leading
[37:19] this bride
[37:21] unto adoption amen
[37:24] the ephesians is the perfection of the
[37:26] gentile bride
[37:28] we thank god for his grace for this
[37:30] glorious time in this ephesians
[37:32] is a perfection of the gentile bride

[42:28] verse 26
[42:43] but jesus beheld them and said unto them

[43:44] 10
[43:48] from verses

[44:14] and we shall descend into the deep that
[44:16] is to bring up christ again from the
[44:20] dead
[44:28] but what said it the word is an idea
[44:30] even in their mouth
[44:32] and in that heart that is the word of
[44:34] faith which we preach
[44:43] that if thou shalt confess with thy
[44:45] mouth the lord jesus
[44:47] and shall believe in thy heart that god
[44:49] has raised him from the dead thou shalt
[44:51] be
[44:51] saved
[45:00] for with the heart man believeth unto
[45:02] righteousness
[45:03] and with the mouth confession is made
[45:05] unto salvation
[45:20] verse 14 how then shall they call on
[45:24] him in whom they have not believed and
[45:26] how shall they believe in him of whom
[45:28] they have not heard
[45:29] and how shall they hear without a
