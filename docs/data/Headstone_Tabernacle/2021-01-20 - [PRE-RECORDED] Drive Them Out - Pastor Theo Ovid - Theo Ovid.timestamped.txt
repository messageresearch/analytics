[22:49] to exodus chapter 23
[22:52] i want to read from verse 20 to 33
[22:56] joshua chapter 14 one verse verse 12
[22:59] judges chapter 1 28-34 and we go back
[23:03] and read verse 20.
[23:06] exodus chapter 23.
[23:22] behold i sent an angel before thee to
[23:25] keep me in the way
[23:27] and to bring thee into the place which i
[23:30] have prepared
[23:32] be way of him obey his voice provoke him
[23:34] not for he will not pardon your
[23:35] transgression
[23:37] for my name is in him
[23:40] but if thou shalt indeed obey his voice
[23:42] and do all that i speak
[23:45] i will be an enemy unto that enemies and
[23:48] an adversary unto thine adversaries
[23:51] for my angels shall go before thee and
[23:53] bring thee
[23:54] unto the amorites the hittites the
[23:56] parasites the canaanites hivites
[23:59] jebusites and i will cut them off
[24:02] thou shalt not bow to their gods nor
[24:05] serve them
[24:07] nor do after their works but thou shalt
[24:09] utterly overthrow them
[24:11] and quite break down their images for ye
[24:14] shall serve the lord your god
[24:16] he shall bless thy bread thy water
[24:19] and i will take away sickness away from
[24:23] the midst of thee
[24:24] they shall nothing cast their young nor
[24:27] be barren
[24:28] in thy land the number of thy days i
[24:30] will fulfill
[24:32] i will send my fear before thee and will
[24:34] destroy
[24:35] all the people to whom thou shalt come i
[24:38] will make all nine enemies turn their
[24:40] backs onto thee
[24:41] i will send hornets before thee we shall
[24:44] drive out the hivites
[24:46] the canaanite the hittite and before
[24:48] thee and i will not drive them out
[24:50] from the before the in one year lease
[24:53] the land become desolate
[24:54] and the beasts of the field multiply
[24:57] against thee
[24:58] by little and little i will drive them
[25:02] out from before they
[25:03] until they'll be increased and inherit
[25:07] the land
[25:08] hallelujah praise god and i will set thy
[25:12] bones from the red sea
[25:13] even under the sea of the philistines
[25:16] and from the desert unto the river
[25:18] for i will deliver the inhabitants of
[25:20] the land unto your hand
[25:21] and thou shalt drive them out before
[25:23] thee thou shalt make no covenant with
[25:25] them
[25:26] nor with their gods they shall not dwell
[25:28] in thy land
[25:29] at least they make these sin against me
[25:31] for if thou serve their gods it will
[25:33] surely be a snare
[25:35] unto thee joshua chapter 14 verse 12.
[25:39] this is caleb given his testimony
[25:42] praise be to jesus now therefore give me
[25:46] this mountain dear
[25:47] way of the lord speaking that day for
[25:49] thou who this in that day
[25:51] all the anakims were there and that the
[25:53] cities were great and fenced
[25:55] if so be the lord will be with me
[25:58] then i shall be able to drive them out
[26:01] as the lord
[26:03] said judges chapter 1 we want to go from
[26:06] verse 28.
[26:14] and it came to pass when israel was
[26:18] strong
[26:19] that they put the canaanites the tribute
[26:21] and did not
[26:22] utterly drive them out verse 29
[26:26] neither did ephraim drive out the
[26:28] canaanites that dwell in giza
[26:30] but the canaanites dwelt in giza among
[26:32] them neither did
[26:34] zebelin drive out the inhabitants of
[26:36] kitran
[26:37] not inhabitants of nahola not the
[26:39] canaanites dwelt among them and
[26:41] became tributaries neither did usher
[26:43] drive all the inhabitants of
[26:44] akko no the inhabitant of zidon no alab
[26:48] no asib no hilab no ethnic nor
[26:51] rehab but the ashlights dwelt among the
[26:54] canaanites
[26:54] and inhabitants of the land but it did
[26:56] not drive them out
[26:59] okay neither did naftali drive all the
[27:03] inhabitants of
[27:04] beshmesh not inhabitants of bananas
[27:07] and he died and he dwelt among the
[27:09] canaanites the inhabitants of the land
[27:11] nevertheless the inhabitants of
[27:12] bashimesh and besanas became tributes
[27:14] unto them
[27:16] and the amorites force the children of
[27:19] dan into the mountains for they would
[27:22] not suffer them to come down
[27:24] to the valley let's go to verse 20.
[27:27] that's the last script you're going to
[27:28] read of that same chapter and they gave
[27:30] hebron
[27:32] unto caleb as moses said
[27:35] and he expelled against the three sons
[27:38] of enoch
[27:40] let's borrow his heavenly father we
[27:41] thank you for your word may you come and
[27:43] interpret into our hearts
[27:45] may this be a transformational service
[27:47] lord that no one will leave here the
[27:49] same way they came
[27:50] if the tongue made the leave up if they
[27:52] came sick when they leave heal
[27:54] if they came broken may you bind the
[27:56] broken hearted if the lay down out may
[27:58] you strengthen the feeble knees
[28:00] if they need encouragement bring that
[28:02] encouragement to them
[28:03] refine the saints lord quicken the
[28:06] people to the word of god
[28:07] if they're sinners or omits may they be
[28:09] saved backsliders may they be restored
[28:12] in jesus name we ask it amen you may be
[28:15] seated give the lord
[28:16] a shout as you take your seeds oh glory
[28:19] hallelujah
[28:23] [Applause]
[28:26] who praised god hallelujah what a
[28:29] scripted reader
[28:31] okay number 13 the people bought the
[28:34] report
[28:35] after the spies were sent out to bring
[28:37] back a report
[28:38] and they said they told him we came onto
[28:40] the land where did all sentences and
[28:42] surely it flew it with milk and honey
[28:44] and this is the fruit of it nevertheless
[28:46] the people are strong
[28:47] that dwell in the land and the cities
[28:49] are walled and very great
[28:51] moreover we saw the churn of anak there
[28:53] the americas dwell in the land of the
[28:55] salt the hittites
[28:56] jebusites amorites dwell in the
[28:58] mountains kill the nightstand by the sea
[29:00] and by the coast of jordan
[29:01] that was the report they say yes land is
[29:03] good
[29:04] it is nice it is wonderful but it's just
[29:07] that it have giants in that land
[29:09] and caleb still the people before moses
[29:12] and said let us go up at once
[29:14] and possess it for we are well able to
[29:17] overcome it
[29:18] that's my inspiration this morning we
[29:20] are well able
[29:22] to overcome it and my title is drive
[29:24] them out

[29:32] heart if it's in your life
[29:34] if it's in your body if it's in sickness

[30:20] out
[30:22] hallelujah praise god praise god
[30:26] let me be seated i appreciate the
[30:28] message but isaac spoke
[30:29] before you left the unfolding of the
[30:31] bride praise god but i answered it when
[30:33] it dies they're bringing forth fruit
[30:34] much fruit but the world john beneficies
[30:37] of the resurrection
[30:38] and by the stephen last sunday
[30:40] possessing your individual inheritance
[30:43] and that was such a tremendous blessing
[30:44] to me because that is the word
[30:47] you see god is that coming for church
[30:50] the people are deceived in churches
[30:52] because they think of god coming for a
[30:54] church so they figured in the best group
[30:56] god is not coming from a group there
[30:58] will be one taken
[31:00] and one left that between the field
[31:03] what will be taken while we left so
[31:05] we're not here to talk about that group
[31:07] talk
[31:08] we had to talk about an individual
[31:11] give me my mountain okay the lord i
[31:15] shout in the hole
[31:16] i don't know about you i don't know
[31:18] about you but i
[31:20] come to possess what i know is my own
[31:30] my jesus you may be seated glory to god
[31:34] hallelujah how about you say write the
[31:37] vision
[31:38] make it plain that he has written me run
[31:42] why why why why because the vision is
[31:45] for appointed time
[31:46] so you wouldn't get frustrated you
[31:48] wouldn't get fed up
[31:49] you will not why the lord ain't come yet
[31:52] no no no the vision
[31:53] is for appointed time and when you catch
[31:56] the vision
[31:57] you should wait on it i will wait till
[32:00] my
[32:01] change come oh give the lord a shout in
[32:04] the hope
[32:08] the vision itself is for an appointed
[32:11] time
[32:12] oh hallelujah glory to god abraham
[32:15] waited 25 years
[32:16] to see isaac come forth noah waited 120
[32:20] years
[32:20] to see the rain fall generally israel
[32:22] waited for 100 years
[32:24] before the liver come but god can't lie
[32:27] god is not a man if god say you're gonna
[32:29] be delivered
[32:30] there's no devil in hell to stop that
[32:32] deliverance i'm coming
[32:34] and i feel somebody gonna be delivered
[32:36] inside this very day this very morning
[32:45] [Applause]
[32:53] not coming for church coming for
[32:56] individuals
[32:58] isn't that right it's an individual's
[33:00] going to catch revelation
[33:02] and efficiency revelation is done right
[33:05] abraham faith
[33:07] isaac love jacob grace
[33:10] joseph perfection
[33:13] god working his way out is not right
[33:17] so this vision of god
[33:21] this prophetic vision that was loosed by
[33:24] seven seals and seven thunders
[33:26] produce the spirit of prophecy because
[33:29] once you see the vision
[33:30] then you know you could prophesy because
[33:33] the vision can't lie
[33:35] abraham could say isaac is coming there
[33:38] is no evidence
[33:39] there is no witness but isaac's still
[33:41] coming
[33:42] because god gave a vision and he had a
[33:44] revelation
[33:45] that put him on expectation and a spirit
[33:48] of worship
[33:49] that he's targeted not at the promise of
[33:52] god through unbelief
[33:54] but was strong in faith giving glory to
[33:56] god
[33:58] you can't have faith and you can't
[33:59] worship faith must have worship with it
[34:02] you could never have faith and you're
[34:04] dumb and you're dead
[34:06] no no faith is already a substance
[34:10] faith is something you can't show anyone
[34:12] faith is revealed
[34:14] [Applause]
[34:19] do i hear a shout in the house right now
[34:22] god is healing you
[34:31] my god my god
[34:35] we don't have a dead message this
[34:38] message is real
[34:39] [Applause]
[34:44] let me seated hallelujah
[34:47] the only way abel could do different and
[34:50] cain
[34:51] is because it was revealed to him
[34:54] it was a divine revelation to evil
[34:57] abel offered unto god a more excellent
[34:59] sacrifice
[35:00] and that's why jesus come and say who do
[35:02] men say either son of man
[35:04] some say you're this some say you're
[35:05] that some say you're that opinions men
[35:08] thoughts
[35:08] he said who do you say i am and peter
[35:11] break out and say don't worry the christ
[35:13] and jesus flesh and blood have not
[35:15] revealed this unto you
[35:17] but my father in heaven revealed this
[35:20] god could reveal himself to a drunkard
[35:24] to a murderer to a backslider to a hater
[35:27] that drug pusher it doesn't matter what
[35:29] condition him somebody remain
[35:31] scared some are prostitute god is
[35:34] suffering
[35:35] god reveals to whomsoever
[35:38] he will
[35:42] and if god is sovereign he could
[35:44] sufferingly deliver you this morning
[35:47] i don't care if he was boozing last
[35:49] night and piping coke there before
[35:51] it matters not when you overcome your
[35:54] outcome
[35:56] my god
[36:00] when the hour for your healing come the
[36:02] hour for your healing come
[36:04] when you're all for deliverance come
[36:06] your hour for deliverance come
[36:07] on
[36:11] you may be seated praise god for 400
[36:13] years
[36:14] between malachi and matthew no prophet
[36:18] no messenger just priests
[36:22] tradition pots and pans everybody's
[36:25] seeing
[36:26] pharisees and scribes and sadducees and
[36:28] this is how we just do it here
[36:33] and god loose a man named john the
[36:35] baptist not zebekaya not zechariah
[36:38] john the baptist gave him a different
[36:40] name
[36:41] different kind of a man to shake the
[36:44] thing up
[36:45] well i never see it so that's right it's
[36:48] different from everywhere else
[36:50] it has to be different because he's
[36:52] making way for messiah
[36:54] he's making way for dynamics if they can
[36:56] wait
[36:57] for power it's have to be different
[36:59] [Applause]
[37:04] what this message need is a revolution

[39:28] what
[39:28] to reveal you to reveal to you your
[39:32] here we go land of promise
[39:35] [Applause]
[39:37] all joshua and israel was a natural in
[39:40] type
[39:41] to a spiritual land that god promised us
[39:48] so he called him out of egypt like he
[39:51] called us out of the world
[39:53] the journey is not the destination i'm
[39:56] sorry for some of you
[39:58] who expect so much thing in the journey
[40:01] but the journey is to a place you say
[40:04] i'm caring i've taken you to a place
[40:05] that i have prepared
[40:07] you're going to a place along the
[40:09] journey you have this problem that
[40:11] problem
[40:11] but as i say you had to travel from
[40:13] grenada to here to there to get to
[40:15] ivory coast that's what from grenada
[40:19] let's say germany that's not the
[40:21] destination the decisions i recourse
[40:24] but you're flying and stopping different
[40:25] places along the journey of turbulence
[40:28] playing rocking a little bit fasten your
[40:30] seatbelt you have shakes a little bit
[40:32] scary a little bit you land here you get
[40:35] all to pick up your luggages you put it
[40:36] on there that's process
[40:38] but you have a destination destination
[40:40] is ivory coast
[40:41] destination dynamics destination holy
[40:44] ghost land
[40:45] destination revival destination come on
[40:47] now preach back to somebody
[40:53] so all the shakes along the journey
[40:56] don't let it upset you the child of your
[40:59] fate
[41:00] being more precious and cold don't let
[41:03] that
[41:03] shake you don't let child shake you in
[41:06] problem
[41:07] don't let it shake you give the devil
[41:10] romans here 28.
[41:12] for we know all things
[41:15] work together for good remember love god
[41:21] to them that called
[41:24] according to its purpose and the purpose
[41:27] of god must stand
[41:37] [Applause]
[41:41] jesus said in the spirit of jesus come
[41:44] spirit of truth
[41:46] he would lead you and guide you into all
[41:49] truth
[41:50] so the spirit of truth that was to come
[41:52] after the prophet
[41:53] could only speak according to the vision
[41:56] that the prophet bought so there are no
[41:59] new mysteries
[42:01] that any man could bring there are no
[42:03] new mysteries
[42:04] or hidden mysteries every mystery
[42:07] has been revealed it may not be revealed
[42:10] to you
[42:11] or me but it has been revealed to a
[42:13] prophet
[42:14] because the word comes to a prophet no
[42:17] other man can come and claim
[42:18] a mystery that the prophet did not
[42:20] reveal that's
[42:22] false that's contrary every mystery has
[42:26] been revealed
[42:27] scorching a prophet but the mysteries
[42:30] and the mysterious christ to be in you
[42:33] the hope of glory
[42:40] all right so all hell
[42:43] all hell will be against this prophetic
[42:46] vision
[42:47] that is why god hate the nicolaitan
[42:49] spirit he hit
[42:51] ministers taking the place of god
[42:52] playing there the holy ghost
[42:54] hallelujah the holy ghost is a promise
[42:57] to
[42:58] you no no man there any perpetrators of
[43:00] the holy ghost
[43:01] no the holy ghost is your promise i'll
[43:04] be with you but i'll be in you
[43:06] come on say amen somebody
[43:13] [Applause]
[43:24] oh
[43:29] remember this do not forget this
[43:32] when israel asks for a king
[43:37] samuel dropped to the ground don't go
[43:40] there
[43:41] don't ask for that they want the king
[43:44] like other nations
[43:45] i came to go before them a man
[43:49] god is a king will you want refreshing
[43:52] blood for
[43:53] we were human for pillar of fire hanging
[43:56] by night
[43:57] cloud hanging by day he brought you out
[44:00] with a mighty hand we want a man for
[44:03] we are one flesh and blood four
[44:08] [Applause]
[44:11] he told samuel they have not rejected
[44:13] you they rejected me
[44:16] give them what they want you see if you
[44:19] don't want god's perfect will he give
[44:20] you up a missive will and he could bless
[44:22] it in his permissive will too
[44:24] but that is not the bride the bride will
[44:26] have perfect will
[44:29] when i see him god bless you by
[44:30] receiving but he said the church member
[44:32] will not be abducted because the church
[44:34] members and go back up the philistines
[44:36] [Applause]
[44:38] this bride is born to overcome
[44:42] this is the age of overcoming so you are
[44:45] blessed to get the test
[44:52] don't just shake your head so say amen
[44:55] say hallelujah you are blessed to get
[44:58] the test
[45:00] you are honored to be tested
[45:06] [Laughter]
[45:17] he's the best man on the earth i am
[45:20] telling you what inside that man you can
[45:21] change
[45:22] all we think are wrong him don't watch
[45:25] satan's interpretation of joke is
[45:28] he have a hedge around him and that is
[45:30] why he behave in himself
[45:32] you have money of a nice car your family
[45:34] every attack everything nice
[45:36] that is why he's serving god that is why
[45:38] in church god telling the devil that's
[45:40] not why he's in church
[45:41] if you're stripping off his money his
[45:43] car his wealth has helped
[45:45] he will conserve me is not what around
[45:48] him
[45:49] is what's in him
[45:52] my god my god you don't make him refuse
[45:56] to preach
[46:12] what i had to rough things up man to
[46:14] make sure there's nothing connecting to
[46:16] you
[46:16] in you that is a contrary desire you're
[46:19] going to break this and bring this and
[46:20] break your pride
[46:21] and humble you and humiliate you because
[46:24] that's what jesus did
[46:25] he humbled himself and became in the
[46:27] form of a servant
[46:28] and he became obedient to the cross then
[46:31] he said learn of me i'm humble and
[46:33] meek and lowly and hurt there's a spirit
[46:35] of god
[46:36] that dwells in humility that belongs to
[46:38] the first sign of the holy ghost
[46:40] humility
[46:41] that's what's lacking people are too
[46:42] proud and god will show down your
[46:45] kingdom
[46:46] or give the lord some praises whether
[46:49] you say emerald
[46:57] so this messenger of malachi 4 is going
[46:59] to do two things
[47:00] according to malachi 4 he will turn the
[47:02] hearts of return to the fathers
[47:04] then he revealed the mystery of the
[47:05] seven thunders in version 10
[47:08] which are the revelations contained in
[47:09] the seven seals it will be these
[47:12] here we go divinely revealed not humanly
[47:15] stated and
[47:16] and preached divinely reveal mystery
[47:19] truths
[47:19] is what will literally turn the heart of
[47:21] the children back to the fathers turn it
[47:24] back to the fathers
[47:25] which is another ephesians the promised
[47:27] land
[47:28] so if our understanding is open of this
[47:32] prophetic vision
[47:33] then you will see you belong to that
[47:35] land
[47:37] no pastor no elder no bishop
[47:40] no church could keep you out of it
[47:45] god do have no secretary to pass through
[47:50] give the lord a shout in the house god
[47:53] have sons and daughters
[47:54] that's why god tell joshua listen moses
[47:56] was dead
[47:57] god didn't going to weep in more than oh
[47:59] god mr moses dead god not in that mood
[48:02] god said joshua mold myself it is dead
[48:04] now therefore takes people across jordan
[48:08] it was very simple three things cross
[48:10] jordan
[48:11] fight and divide the land
[48:14] [Applause]
[48:16] very simple the message of the hour is
[48:19] very
[48:19] simple
[48:22] moses is dead no joshua
[48:26] take the people over cross children
[48:30] fight drag them out
[48:35] i'm not hearing you i'm not hearing you
[48:39] some of you looking for god to fight for
[48:46] you
[48:48] [Applause]
[48:52] [Music]
[48:57] on you i give you the land you want me
[49:00] to bring watching cut last you want to
[49:01] bring
[49:02] hoe you're wearing fork you almost are

[49:10] and i do do all the work for you and say
[49:12] you overcome what
[49:16] there was a land to be taken this land
[49:19] was possessed by seven
[49:20] tribes the tithes jebusites gracious as
[49:22] all the heights
[49:23] plus palestines let me arrange there yet
[49:32] couldn't hit this height and after he
[49:34] couldn't deal with that height
[49:36] them is low-level fellas the philistines
[49:39] that must be dreadlords

[49:42] of they iron don't even talk about that
[49:45] yet

[49:48] day
[49:50] but for now we're going to drive out
[49:54] all their might all what we can drive up
[49:58] we're gonna drive them out
[50:02] could somebody say amen could somebody
[50:04] give a shout in the house
[50:15] this messenger of malachi first to do
[50:17] what bring back the original fate
[50:20] and he call it the resurrection fate
[50:22] that the same
[50:23] jesus after he was raised from the dead
[50:27] working among them by the world preacher
[50:30] masterpiece
[50:32] to identify the resurrection ministry of
[50:35] jesus christ
[50:36] among the disciples was not dear easter
[50:43] the lord is among us he's back yeah
[50:47] he is back but that is not your easter
[50:52] easter was pentecost
[50:56] so he came among them show evidence he's
[50:59] alive
[51:00] he'll sit multiply this fish and
[51:03] everything else
[51:03] do miracles for them but it was to give
[51:05] them a faith
[51:07] to go and believe the dynamics in the
[51:10] upper room
[51:14] so testifying we see the lord we see
[51:16] that's great that's a good testament
[51:18] we've seen you know we're saying lord
[51:19] yeah yeah in your room
[51:23] [Applause]
[51:27] but he promises not to be among us his
[51:29] promises to be

[51:35] oh we have a wonderful group no no no
[51:38] until this fire come inside of you
[51:42] fight press
[51:46] push until you connected to the actual
[51:50] source god i have no grandchildren
[51:53] god has sons and daughters that's who
[51:55] are here this morning is that right
[51:58] oh my my my lord so therefore what you
[52:02] must see is jesus back among
[52:04] the people since that prophet left
[52:08] so the prophetic vision brings on the
[52:10] fate
[52:12] shows you that the fate has been
[52:13] restored defeat has been revealed
[52:16] the fate must be ripened and the feet
[52:18] must be manifested
[52:19] hallelujah but abandon restore the fate
[52:22] that fate came as a revelation
[52:23] seven seas seven thunders it revealed
[52:26] but that faith must mature
[52:28] ripen hallelujah then manifested not
[52:32] talk
[52:32] not talking-fested manifested not just
[52:35] pulpit eyes
[52:37] peter peter had more than that his
[52:40] his intellectual faith making the united
[52:42] christ his intellectual faith make him
[52:44] run

[52:51] i could give unto you
[52:53] rise up and walk that was the power
[52:55] we're talking about
[52:56] that's the power to be in sons permanent
[52:59] power
[53:00] resident power not temporary power
[53:03] permanent power
[53:04] resident power that's your promise could

[55:17] chair and claim them
[55:18] [Applause]
[55:21] deliverance has come speak
[55:25] speak speak
[55:44] one of the hardest things is to do
[55:47] something
[55:48] that was never done before
[55:53] that's the hardest change you see if
[55:56] you're custom doing something and a
[55:57] little shift
[55:58] another shift that's easy but when
[56:01] you are challenged to do something
[56:05] you have never done before that is a
[56:09] transformational experience
[56:12] this is what these brothers encountered
[56:15] god promised them a land
[56:17] words is what they're hearing god
[56:19] couldn't wait to bring them up to the
[56:21] land
[56:22] god couldn't wait to send out spice to
[56:24] see it
[56:25] and bring back evidence here one more
[56:28] talk
[56:29] not when you're reaching land you want
[56:31] to bring back evidence
[56:32] of signs wonders miracles powers
[56:36] healings deliverances you want evidence
[56:38] back that's what the grapes represent
[56:40] that's what the wine represents that's
[56:42] what the oil represents that's what the
[56:44] milk represents
[56:45] evidence that god keeps his word
[56:50] the brethren testimony was yes it's true
[56:53] but
[56:56] we see giants we see we see cheering of
[57:00] enoch
[57:01] and this guy is who are gonna expel the
[57:04] the boss man himself
[57:05] and his two brothers so so we see giants
[57:09] and and therefore we we're not able to
[57:11] take it caleb
[57:14] who was the shortest man in the camp
[57:17] but the brother said came up at the
[57:19] staff on a box

[57:31] with all them giants and people only
[57:34] watching him and shaking their heads so

[59:00] this is brother branham you speak about
[59:03] elijah
[59:04] on a juniper tree he was tired he was
[59:06] hungry
[59:07] angel woke him up eat some more because
[59:10] the journey is very hard
[59:13] um is prophesying oh what we need in
[59:16] this journey
[59:17] that we is now is to find a place of
[59:19] rest and to feast
[59:22] on the word of god that it will give us
[59:24] strength
[59:25] he said before there is a great journey
[59:28] and a great battle ahead for the church
[59:31] and i believe we have been children long
[59:33] enough
[59:34] god is going to turn this church into
[59:36] manhood now
[59:37] we have played and followed as children
[59:40] but now
[59:41] we're going to have to put up with
[59:42] childish things and take on manhood
[59:44] maturity
[59:50] who would have thought we will be here
[59:51] almost 50 years
[59:53] since the last has already come
[59:56] long journey her journey
[1:00:00] and we are feasting on the word with the
[1:00:03] prophetic vision
[1:00:04] that the land belongs to us
[1:00:10] listen if you see that it changes you
[1:00:17] then you're on your road to possess you
[1:00:20] could only possess what you know is your
[1:00:22] own
[1:00:22] [Applause]
[1:00:26] you can't claim somebody else's land
[1:00:29] amen
[1:00:30] [Music]
[1:00:34] hear this one and they saw my brother
[1:00:37] jesus he sent this
[1:00:38] for me just in time beautiful quote from
[1:00:40] version chapter 5.
[1:00:41] you understand now what the seven seal
[1:00:44] book was
[1:00:46] what it is we got it in scroll now
[1:00:49] and just remember in these last days it
[1:00:52] was kept in an
[1:00:53] earthling vessel you understand that now
[1:00:57] who was the earthly vessel jesus christ
[1:01:00] no man had it nobody had it it's only
[1:01:02] through him it wasn't even written in
[1:01:03] the word if it was written in the word
[1:01:05] it was
[1:01:05] hidden so you couldn't even find it
[1:01:07] that's right
[1:01:08] and if it's in him that's it's revealed
[1:01:11] then
[1:01:12] in that earthly vessel it wouldn't rust
[1:01:14] or rust
[1:01:15] when he comes he pulls back one to his
[1:01:17] church
[1:01:18] so this seven sea scroll book is to be
[1:01:20] veiled
[1:01:23] in earthen vessels oh man
[1:01:27] it has to be veiled behind you so it's a
[1:01:30] little more than talk right
[1:01:31] it's a little more than preaching it
[1:01:33] right it's a little more than explaining
[1:01:34] it right
[1:01:36] what it is it has to be veiled in you
[1:01:38] that's why the prophet has to eat the
[1:01:39] book
[1:01:40] it was represented of taking in the word
[1:01:42] and getting the word on the inside
[1:01:44] so you have to receive the word and
[1:01:46] become the word then you fail the word
[1:01:48] itself
[1:01:49] because you are the words of the book so
[1:01:51] you will be veiling the book itself
[1:01:53] oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:01:57] remember adam had the book the book had
[1:02:00] names in it
[1:02:01] adam was supposed to call the names but
[1:02:03] adam fell
[1:02:04] the book went back to god but the book
[1:02:07] came back down
[1:02:08] then you like adam
[1:02:12] god bring back the book to put it back
[1:02:14] in sons in the last days
[1:02:17] back on the call names you're going to
[1:02:19] be born into manifestation
[1:02:24] oh jesus
[1:02:26] [Applause]
[1:02:28] my god help me this morning if you know
[1:02:30] what i'm seeing this morning
[1:02:32] i'm seeing beyond your failures be on
[1:02:33] your sin be on your fault
[1:02:35] be on your fear i'm seeing sons i'm
[1:02:37] seeing seeds i'm seeing genes i'm seeing
[1:02:40] germ
[1:02:40] i'm seeing what you have to become not
[1:02:42] what you are oh glory to god help me
[1:02:44] jesus
[1:02:45] i want you to see what i'm seeing
[1:02:53] i could see why the devil fought this
[1:02:56] prophetic vision
[1:02:57] because if you catch it you'll begin to
[1:03:00] fight with all your might
[1:03:02] you would recognize there's no system
[1:03:03] longer just taking things for granted
[1:03:05] you're accepting your sickness
[1:03:06] you're acting this is the cause and this
[1:03:08] is how it is lord and
[1:03:10] no no you stop that start to speak a
[1:03:12] little thing
[1:03:13] look look go tell moses bring the people
[1:03:14] to this place the bush at me right
[1:03:17] and then they end up with red sea in
[1:03:18] front of him mountains on both sides
[1:03:20] hard case moses fall back in humanistic
[1:03:23] ramp begin to crash under god god say
[1:03:24] why crimes i mean speaking forward
[1:03:26] then moses come back in order to say red
[1:03:29] see you have to move you know
[1:03:30] [Applause]
[1:03:31] [Music]
[1:03:33] now elijah was a little different he was
[1:03:35] a different kind of a man
[1:03:37] he had he had to talk he just take his
[1:03:40] mantle and destroy the jordan river
[1:03:43] jordan's supposed to understand give me
[1:03:45] room let me pass
[1:03:47] i want to pass jordan open up get the
[1:03:50] lord and shout
[1:03:51] out that's what we're talking about
[1:03:58] right now we need a revival
[1:04:01] right now we i feed the stepper foot on
[1:04:04] the river
[1:04:06] stepping foot on signs wonders miracles
[1:04:10] lay hands upon the section recover speak
[1:04:13] in the word
[1:04:14] put your faith on that you have a right
[1:04:17] to speak just as god spoke
[1:04:29] remember you see that a woman had a
[1:04:32] child was sick
[1:04:33] she was in the in the audience
[1:04:37] and a woman next to her fellow led to
[1:04:38] pray for her baby
[1:04:40] and she prayed for the baby and then
[1:04:43] one company prayer line or something
[1:04:44] like that becoming a full story it might
[1:04:46] be
[1:04:46] all the details of it and then bahram
[1:04:48] says a lady next you pray for the baby
[1:04:50] and baby was healed
[1:04:52] because god saw that we wanted more
[1:04:53] compassion and i and god used everyone
[1:04:55] to pray for the child
[1:04:56] so the prophet did not pray for the baby
[1:04:58] a woman ordinary person
[1:05:00] not pastor wife not bishop wife not
[1:05:03] elder wife
[1:05:04] ordinary soul daughter of god with faith
[1:05:07] good pray and god can answer prayer you
[1:05:10] to make god to answer your prayer
[1:05:12] satan trembles when he sees the weakest
[1:05:15] saint upon them
[1:05:29] [Music]
[1:05:35] so many say if the lord will take this
[1:05:38] evil spirit from me
[1:05:40] from drinking from gambling from lying
[1:05:43] or stealing i'll save him
[1:05:46] that's up to you you have got something
[1:05:49] to do
[1:05:50] did i overcome shall inherit all things
[1:05:53] they are overcome
[1:05:54] you have power to do it
[1:05:58] [Applause]
[1:06:03] see somebody tired
[1:06:07] and dead let the host catch a fire
[1:06:10] [Applause]
[1:06:13] see if they're so tired because you're
[1:06:14] blocking dead
[1:06:18] tiredness is relative to the environment
[1:06:23] that overcome this temptation oh yeah
[1:06:26] let something else come man you would
[1:06:29] run like joseph
[1:06:34] it all depends upon the environment
[1:06:38] that's why satan has make it nice
[1:06:41] to william but the wages of sin is still
[1:06:45] dead
[1:06:46] that's why the way is narrow and hard
[1:06:49] and that's the choice we make
[1:06:51] we choose this rugged way we choose to
[1:06:53] overcome our own selves we have to
[1:06:56] there is something called denying
[1:06:58] yourself
[1:07:00] that's a word people don't use denying
[1:07:03] self
[1:07:04] wife won her own way husband wants his
[1:07:06] own way everybody
[1:07:07] no why do you want to deny and just say
[1:07:09] deny yourself
[1:07:10] put yourself last night try it out and
[1:07:13] see how does it work
[1:07:14] [Applause]
[1:07:18] people want an eye but god wanted a nice
[1:07:22] self
[1:07:22] because that's what christ did he put
[1:07:24] self aside in order to press forward
[1:07:26] not my will but i will be done i
[1:07:30] i wish i could put this aside but
[1:07:32] there's a cost
[1:07:34] hallelujah oh my hallelujah
[1:07:38] so you see god could not push us through
[1:07:40] a pipe and pull us in the other end and
[1:07:41] say
[1:07:42] blessed he will overcome it you have
[1:07:43] nothing to overcome he just pushed you
[1:07:45] through
[1:07:46] but you have got decisions for yourself
[1:07:48] decisions are beautiful should i
[1:07:50] shouldn't die
[1:07:51] should i move toward a lot of fruit is
[1:07:53] what you see of your decisions
[1:07:55] so then you are challenged to seek god
[1:07:58] to make the right decisions
[1:07:59] because they want the right fruit oh
[1:08:02] glory to god amen
[1:08:04] hallelujah god they wanted a king god
[1:08:06] give them soul so
[1:08:07] start off nice they always do
[1:08:10] until pride overtake them then they're
[1:08:12] going off track
[1:08:14] isn't that right samuel comes they kill
[1:08:16] everything kill everything don't even
[1:08:17] take the flop nothing else
[1:08:19] come a day and hear britain
[1:08:23] he said was that a year bleeding he said
[1:08:26] we keep something for the lord
[1:08:31] and then king aegon big guy he

[1:08:38] draws sword
[1:08:39] kill ki god i mean it was it was
[1:08:42] finished
[1:08:43] because god said don't do it don't touch
[1:08:45] it i will send a hornet before you
[1:08:47] i will send my angel before you there
[1:08:49] you'll be there will be your enemy to be
[1:08:51] your enemy
[1:08:52] and your enemy to your enemies as long
[1:08:54] as you stay with that word
[1:08:56] [Applause]
[1:08:58] but israel had always backslide in and
[1:09:01] anytime your backslide is a king to take
[1:09:03] you into captivity
[1:09:07] and when you repent god punish that king
[1:09:13] so we must know when you repent because
[1:09:16] you'll come back with the joy
[1:09:18] and your hands back up in the air when
[1:09:20] you see you're in trouble

[1:09:35] hallelujah that's that's god is the
[1:09:38] object of worship

[1:15:27] praise god so abraham was heir to all
[1:15:30] things
[1:15:31] he could claim to everything and that
[1:15:33] was the land and abraham had been given
[1:15:35] a promise
[1:15:36] and it looked like everything went going
[1:15:37] wrong for abraham yet he owned the whole
[1:15:40] thing
[1:15:41] abraham could possess that land or what
[1:15:43] was in it god gave it to him
[1:15:45] and lot was part of that land so abraham
[1:15:47] had a right to it
[1:15:49] he could call or lay hold of it listen
[1:15:52] to this
[1:15:52] now god made a promise
[1:15:57] and that was the land and that was mine
[1:15:59] you made a promise now my kinsmen have
[1:16:01] been taken and he is gone
[1:16:03] and abraham i lay a whole of the promise
[1:16:05] it's my possession
[1:16:06] you told me so and then you can go after

[1:17:13] and god pack him up and send him
[1:17:14] straight back to you
[1:17:16] same place you run from the same place
[1:17:18] you're running from go go seniority back
[1:17:20] there
[1:17:20] to deal with the enemy and all you have
[1:17:23] to tell yourself
[1:17:24] to every goliath there is a divot
[1:17:29] oh let's change it this way to every
[1:17:30] goliath there's a stone
[1:17:33] so once you know good luck his family
[1:17:34] say enoch he's same family
[1:17:36] it's all lemon and giant thing but steam
[1:17:39] stone
[1:17:41] once there's a giant he could be
[1:17:43] conquered
[1:17:46] we have no reason to don't anymore
[1:17:49] i don't care for a giant as cancer tumor
[1:17:51] leukemia i don't care what condition it
[1:17:53] is
[1:17:53] it could be conquered
[1:18:00] i gave a shadow of death hanging over
[1:18:02] you no
[1:18:04] that could roll back
[1:18:11] hallelujah is that one time a man
[1:18:14] a man god said protect your papers time
[1:18:16] up for you and that man stayed before
[1:18:18] god and said god i serve you all these
[1:18:19] years i need more time
[1:18:21] and god give him more time that can all
[1:18:23] could be conquered
[1:18:26] oh my my my i call you young man because
[1:18:29] you're strong
[1:18:30] don't ever let the devil tell you you're
[1:18:32] weak he called
[1:18:34] because you have a strength as a young
[1:18:36] person
[1:18:37] to stand and withstand the devil come on
[1:18:40] say i met somebody
[1:18:46] what abraham says we are heir to every
[1:18:48] spiritual blessing
[1:18:49] abram had a right to the promise the
[1:18:51] promise was his
[1:18:52] and yet he had to fight to possess it
[1:18:54] there you are
[1:18:56] believer today we're here to all things
[1:18:58] yet we are heir to every spiritual
[1:19:00] blessing
[1:19:00] every physical blessing every blessing
[1:19:03] the bible promises
[1:19:04] yet you have to fight every inch of it
[1:19:06] that's the way god get it set up
[1:19:12] character is not a victory character is
[1:19:15] not a gift rather character is a victory
[1:19:17] and a victory is something that you have
[1:19:18] overcome and i see over the years i've
[1:19:21] never
[1:19:22] seen my blessings give people character
[1:19:24] does all mean pain
[1:19:25] suffering anguish hurts this is what
[1:19:29] forms you into the image
[1:19:33] of god i have seen blessings destroy
[1:19:36] people
[1:19:38] because it wasn't even repaired for it
[1:19:39] amen hallelujah that's why god could
[1:19:42] have blessed solomon with riches in him
[1:19:43] because solomon acts for wisdom he
[1:19:45] didn't accept yes
[1:19:47] he has a wisdom to govern god's people
[1:19:49] and because he asked for that god could
[1:19:51] well put wealth on him because you have
[1:19:53] the wisdom to manage it
[1:19:55] [Applause]
[1:19:58] sometimes when blessings come too fast
[1:19:59] and too much people go wrong
[1:20:02] because your human spirit cannot handle
[1:20:04] it like a brother says something in the
[1:20:05] middle was so powerful
[1:20:07] he said i don't want to know your
[1:20:08] weakness because i don't know how i
[1:20:10] could handle it
[1:20:12] i don't want to dig up and file where
[1:20:13] you do wrong and go wrong and no i want
[1:20:15] to know that
[1:20:16] you say because god know your weakness i
[1:20:17] need his attitude towards he doesn't
[1:20:19] change
[1:20:20] his nature towards you doesn't change
[1:20:22] but as a human we could change
[1:20:24] we could feel this way and feel that way
[1:20:26] but when god sees you
[1:20:28] he looks beyond your faults he looks
[1:20:30] beyond your weakness
[1:20:32] he looked beyond your struggle when god
[1:20:34] saw
[1:20:35] saul new testament saw god saw him
[1:20:38] becoming paul
[1:20:40] he was riding his high horse fighting
[1:20:42] the church
[1:20:43] killing battling all unbelievers running
[1:20:47] from saul
[1:20:48] and god see paul coming but he riding us
[1:20:51] all right in his high horse god knock
[1:20:54] him off his high horse
[1:20:56] who i thought lord who would have taught
[1:20:59] saul
[1:20:59] what's going to become paul we write off
[1:21:02] the man called saul
[1:21:04] because he fight in the church but god
[1:21:06] didn't write them off
[1:21:19] there's a real difference between
[1:21:20] opinion and judgment
[1:21:23] you can have an opinion about somebody
[1:21:25] that's fear that's fine
[1:21:27] with more information your opinion could
[1:21:29] change i didn't know this i
[1:21:31] don't have new information my opinion
[1:21:33] changed that person
[1:21:34] but when you judge somebody you put them
[1:21:36] in concrete there's nothing they could
[1:21:38] do because you have them fixed
[1:21:40] they could smile you still don't like
[1:21:42] them
[1:21:44] they can bring a gift for you with bow
[1:21:45] tie you still don't like them
[1:21:48] because you have an opinion and a
[1:21:49] judgment on that person thank god he's
[1:21:51] not like that
[1:21:53] [Applause]
[1:21:55] he said peter you deny me but after
[1:21:57] you're converted
[1:21:59] strengthening brethren peter did
[1:22:01] everyone want to sit for like wheat
[1:22:04] he could tell what could have happened
[1:22:05] he could tell where you're going to fail
[1:22:07] but he could tell when he would be
[1:22:08] restored tell you when you're gonna
[1:22:10] bounce back
[1:22:11] tell where you're gonna stand he can
[1:22:12] tell all about you he still choose you
[1:22:15] that's why you should be rejoicing you
[1:22:17] should be thanking god
[1:22:19] no god wants you to possess your land no
[1:22:22] no i'm skipping yours jumping here
[1:22:23] listen to this
[1:22:24] version 10 christ mighty angel
[1:22:28] russian 10 7 the messenger represents
[1:22:31] them three and four seven thunders after
[1:22:32] the voices the message
[1:22:34] by russian 10 8 11. john represented the
[1:22:37] bride
[1:22:38] said take the book eat the book though
[1:22:39] must prophesy again
[1:22:41] why should we have to prophesy because
[1:22:43] the time is not yet
[1:22:45] and the vision is from appointed time
[1:22:47] then you have to get the spirit of
[1:22:48] prophecy
[1:22:49] to prophesy over your own life david
[1:22:52] said the lord will perfect that which
[1:22:53] considered me
[1:22:55] you have to connect with the prophecy
[1:22:56] your own prophecy to step into your
[1:22:58] position
[1:22:59] because you have to be a heart of the
[1:23:01] children who turn hearts back to the
[1:23:02] faith of the fathers
[1:23:03] you have to connect with your prophecy
[1:23:05] the spirit and the bride said come
[1:23:07] this is you he shall turn the half of
[1:23:09] the children back to the faith of the
[1:23:11] fathers
[1:23:11] peter waiting on you paul written on you
[1:23:14] we have to go back and pick up what they
[1:23:16] had
[1:23:16] and go further than them we have to
[1:23:18] bring up the resurrection
[1:23:20] because they without us not made perfect
[1:23:22] we have to go and pick up what they had
[1:23:24] and go beyond them we are called to go
[1:23:26] beyond where any other people went
[1:23:28] before
[1:23:29] think about it north korea have their
[1:23:31] nuclear
[1:23:32] thing america feeling this way bombs
[1:23:36] threats the world is going crazy
[1:23:39] i miss all of that god is still not the
[1:23:41] heat
[1:23:42] but our bride has to be ready before
[1:23:45] anything take place
[1:23:46] the bride has to be ready and the bible
[1:23:49] said his wife had made herself ready
[1:23:51] that means she have done something about
[1:23:53] the clothes of the world
[1:23:55] she had just said she make herself ready
[1:23:57] look this morning
[1:23:58] thousands and tons of people in churches
[1:24:00] sitting enjoying our service
[1:24:02] enjoying a preacher preaching they love
[1:24:03] the pastor they love the preacher and
[1:24:04] whatnot but is
[1:24:05] adi be me ready if we don't make you
[1:24:09] ready
[1:24:09] we have failed if you don't catch the
[1:24:12] prophetic vision we are failed
[1:24:14] if i am the vision you have nothing to
[1:24:16] do just sit down and watch me
[1:24:19] watch watch your tv like a movie
[1:24:23] just come and watch but when you
[1:24:25] understand
[1:24:26] that the whole creation is grown in
[1:24:29] travailing for the sons of god to step
[1:24:32] forward
[1:24:33] and you are that you are called to that
[1:24:37] the people that know their god what you
[1:24:39] know luther didn't know
[1:24:41] what you know wesley didn't know you who
[1:24:43] know the whole secret of god
[1:24:45] because in a prophet anyone you could go
[1:24:47] back on the age of your messenger
[1:24:49] with the knowledge that you have of this
[1:24:51] world therefore to whom much is given
[1:24:53] much is expected
[1:24:54] much is required we have a higher order
[1:24:57] we have a higher calling
[1:24:59] hallelujah look look look the president
[1:25:03] of america said he didn't know job was
[1:25:04] so hard
[1:25:09] he applied for a job and received a job
[1:25:11] that he didn't even recognize what what
[1:25:12] all involved
[1:25:13] noise he thought it was an easier life
[1:25:15] in the other easy like before this
[1:25:19] that's what america have right now
[1:25:23] that's what they vote for god can i risk
[1:25:26] that
[1:25:28] son's coming position and power well
[1:25:30] well you see they're ready
[1:25:31] oman is ruling dictatorship and ruled
[1:25:34] rigor that's why god have to look for
[1:25:35] sons with character
[1:25:37] because god can't wait to put his
[1:25:39] signature to put his ring on his sons
[1:25:41] in the beginning he was proud of adam
[1:25:43] you know he's saying he's turning his
[1:25:44] back man
[1:25:45] let us make man in our own image and
[1:25:47] likeness let him have dominion when he
[1:25:49] put adam he walked away
[1:25:50] oh hallelujah the bible said and he saw
[1:25:53] it was good
[1:25:58] god didn't get a fight oh gosh homicide
[1:26:00] acting like me
[1:26:01] no a son reflecting the fathers
[1:26:04] adam was just like god god even tell
[1:26:06] adam to name the animals
[1:26:08] and the bible said whatever the name was
[1:26:10] that was the name thereof
[1:26:11] adam was authorized authorized to name
[1:26:13] the animals adam was had full dominion
[1:26:16] on the earth
[1:26:17] he had the book he had the authority he
[1:26:19] had the power
[1:26:22] but there was war in heaven
[1:26:25] [Applause]
[1:26:28] and satan got kicked out and the battle
[1:26:30] of angels
[1:26:31] became the battle of men oh hallelujah
[1:26:35] so that battle fell on the earth and
[1:26:37] tonight we're in a great battle
[1:26:40] but we have a word drive them out
[1:26:43] and if michael take out lucifer out of
[1:26:46] heavenly places
[1:26:47] what do you think we gonna do here on
[1:26:49] the earth
[1:26:51] think about it he was kicked out in
[1:26:54] heaven
[1:26:55] what are we gonna do here we're gonna do
[1:26:57] the same
[1:26:58] drive them out oh glory to god
[1:27:00] hallelujah praise god
[1:27:03] glory hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:27:07] thank you jesus abraham says tell satan
[1:27:10] give it back
[1:27:11] give it back with his mind don't let him
[1:27:13] bluff you stand right there and say
[1:27:15] he'll give it back
[1:27:16] but you have to believe in your
[1:27:17] authority
[1:27:20] not power yet authority
[1:27:24] when a policeman go out on the road and
[1:27:26] stop the trafficking power
[1:27:28] to stop no traffic that guy could knock
[1:27:30] him straight down and get control
[1:27:30] driving
[1:27:33] but what the respect is the uniform
[1:27:36] because he had backings the whole action
[1:27:39] that police force they hold the
[1:27:40] authority the whole legal system is
[1:27:42] behind that policeman
[1:27:43] so he can be small he could be a new
[1:27:46] recruit
[1:27:47] and he's looked in and fresh you know
[1:27:48] how this look already
[1:27:51] everything looking heavy on them looking
[1:27:54] like they overloaded
[1:27:55] and he could be thin as they haven't
[1:27:56] come and do so you have to stop
[1:28:01] it's not how tinny is so you could be a
[1:28:03] teen believer
[1:28:04] i'm not much physically thin in spirit
[1:28:07] but once you have the uniform
[1:28:15] authority authority
[1:28:19] so from the day today we're going to
[1:28:22] exercise authority
[1:28:28] but power coming just stop the car
[1:28:32] do you understand what i'm saying right
[1:28:35] now you're exercising authority
[1:28:36] but power coming stop devils cast every
[1:28:40] soul
[1:28:40] heal the sick that's power raise the
[1:28:43] that's power
[1:28:44] you will be seated that's power
[1:28:48] language is dead we have you laid him
[1:28:50] even now lord
[1:28:51] power where have you lead him lazarus
[1:28:53] comfort that's power
[1:28:55] hallelujah praise god praise god
[1:28:58] and there's a scripture after lazarus
[1:29:00] here from the dead describing pharisees
[1:29:01] plotted to kill lazarus you know
[1:29:03] yes there's a scripture they say this is
[1:29:06] too much now

[1:29:12] the man who was dead let me kill him

[1:31:18] demons
[1:31:19] and they get into places and they get
[1:31:21] among men
[1:31:22] ministers they get amongst church
[1:31:24] members they get among good people

[1:31:28] illusion and they say things
[1:31:31] and do things and teach things and
[1:31:34] practice things
[1:31:34] that are contrary to the word of god he

[1:34:18] jesus christ
[1:34:19] oh my my my my my oh
[1:34:22] hallelujah oh glory to god glory to god
[1:34:26] enticing spirit going forth demons under
[1:34:28] disguises
[1:34:30] people wondering brother branham how do
[1:34:31] you let go i've got a lot of people say
[1:34:33] i'm gonna fast for 40 days
[1:34:34] so i can do something you don't need a
[1:34:36] 40-day fast you need to
[1:34:37] let go of the world and all these
[1:34:39] devilish things
[1:34:40] and take god word in your heart you've
[1:34:43] got to be taught how to do that
[1:34:44] you don't do it by jumping up and down
[1:34:46] neither you do buy a 40 day fast you do
[1:34:48] buy a surrendered heart
[1:34:49] to almighty god and then he compared to
[1:34:52] a little baby
[1:34:53] he said like a little baby i noticed a
[1:34:54] little baby back there his mother tried
[1:34:56] to put a little jacket on him this
[1:34:57] morning
[1:34:57] and he wanted to get his little arm in
[1:34:59] the sleeve he couldn't put his arm in
[1:35:01] there he don't know how
[1:35:02] you have to guide his little arm he
[1:35:04] wants to get his arm in there but he's
[1:35:06] beaten all around
[1:35:07] he will never get the sleeve he knows
[1:35:09] not how to get in the sleeve
[1:35:11] so that is what you are you are not
[1:35:12] right with god when you are back biting
[1:35:14] lying doing everything you can't be
[1:35:16] right with god
[1:35:18] i don't care how much teachers you
[1:35:19] belong to until your soul becomes
[1:35:21] converted that's old-fashioned
[1:35:23] that's that's that's boiled down and put
[1:35:25] soup in your soul
[1:35:26] watch until you could he's got to have
[1:35:29] somebody direct him
[1:35:30] and that's the way it is every
[1:35:31] born-again christian when he really gets
[1:35:33] into god
[1:35:34] he watches his life with god's word and
[1:35:37] he realizes
[1:35:38] he's lined up with every bit of it he's
[1:35:40] got long suffering
[1:35:41] gentleness quietness meekness power
[1:35:44] faith love joy peace
[1:35:45] he impossible like the troublesome amen
[1:35:48] hallelujah praise
[1:35:49] god his thoughts are pure his heart is
[1:35:52] pure
[1:35:53] his intentions are pure his alternatives
[1:35:55] are right and he knows he's lying with
[1:35:56] the word of god
[1:35:57] hell can't move him he's lined up with
[1:35:59] the word of god he's got divine love
[1:36:01] puting heart for every man and every
[1:36:02] woman
[1:36:03] he's abstained from the things of the
[1:36:04] world they're dead to him he don't want
[1:36:06] them no more
[1:36:07] enticing spirits versus the word of god
[1:36:10] how do you do it brother branham just
