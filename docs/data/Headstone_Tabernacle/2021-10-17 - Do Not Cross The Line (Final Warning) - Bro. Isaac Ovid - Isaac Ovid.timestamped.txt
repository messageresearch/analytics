[41:32] i was very blessed
[41:35] amen
[41:36] to see god
[41:38] being able to use
[41:40] each one of us
[41:42] and it's we should all have a testimony
[41:44] you know
[41:47] at any point in time we're supposed to
[41:49] have a testimony
[41:51] we have so much to thank god about
[41:53] testify about tell somebody about we all
[41:57] have a testimony if it wasn't for the
[41:59] lord i wouldn't be here this morning if
[42:01] it wasn't for the lord i wouldn't know
[42:04] who i was if it wasn't for the lord
[42:06] who pulled me out who called me who put
[42:09] my name in the book who wrote my name in
[42:12] blood the devil is mad but i in business
[42:15] a sister donald can say i have business
[42:18] if the devil is mad i am so glad because
[42:21] he called me and he called you so i want
[42:23] to salute but the gideon brother stephen
[42:26] for the andy sister donna and brother
[42:29] clarence for yielding yourself to the
[42:31] holy ghost
[42:33] and to be a blessing to the body of
[42:35] believers
[42:36] so at this time let's go to the
[42:38] scriptures
[42:39] of three portions of scripture
[42:42] that we want to read this morning
[42:45] reading from the book of isaiah and also
[42:48] uh in the book of revelation
[42:50] and for a few weeks
[42:52] we have been on a certain road
[42:55] uh in revelation and um
[42:58] beloved speaking there in revelation 10
[43:00] and then we went you know between
[43:02] revelation 22 and so i just want to kind
[43:05] of pull some things out there still
[43:08] and we certainly appreciate the service
[43:10] last sunday amen i appreciate the pastor
[43:14] this morning
[43:16] amen
[43:17] and
[43:19] i don't often um listen back to messages
[43:22] that i speak
[43:23] but
[43:24] um i was blessed on wednesday night with
[43:28] have we not enough
[43:30] because it's a challenge still a
[43:32] challenge to me and still a challenge to
[43:33] us all
[43:34] with have we done enough you know so i
[43:37] think god has really been kind of
[43:39] directing us in the right way
[43:41] in the right approach both in the live
[43:44] services the bible studies the tapes
[43:46] that are played and even said the
[43:48] service last friday being led by the
[43:50] holy spirit you know because if it's
[43:52] about one person being delivered that's
[43:54] with it all
[43:55] if it's about one person finding out who
[43:57] they are in the mind of god and the
[44:00] purpose of god then it's worth it all
[44:02] so let's read uh we'll start in in
[44:05] isaiah 55 and reading verse 6
[44:09] seek he the lord while he may be found
[44:12] call ye upon him while he is near
[44:14] let the wicked forsake his way and the
[44:16] unrighteous man his thoughts and let him
[44:19] return unto the lord and he will have
[44:22] mercy upon him
[44:24] and to our god for he will abundantly
[44:27] pardon
[44:29] you know we have read this scripture
[44:30] many times but i want to highlight
[44:32] something interesting because verse 7
[44:34] says let the wicked forsake his way and
[44:36] the unrighteous man his thoughts and let
[44:39] him return unto the lord so this wicked
[44:41] man this unrighteous man
[44:44] being described here is not just some
[44:46] random person
[44:48] this is somebody who once had a
[44:50] relationship
[44:51] with god and is being challenged to
[44:53] return to the lord or return unto the
[44:56] lord so so what the scripture is
[44:58] directed at here
[45:00] is not the man who doesn't know god or
[45:02] not interested in god or god didn't
[45:04] write their name down in the book
[45:06] this is a different kind of wicked
[45:09] this is a different kind of unrighteous
[45:11] because for you to return to something
[45:13] you want had to be there
[45:15] you must have to have a relationship
[45:17] first you can't come back to where you
[45:18] never were anybody with me so i want to
[45:21] read it again from that perspective seek
[45:22] ye the lord while he may be found in
[45:25] other words there's a time clock on
[45:27] finding him that when that time runs out
[45:29] you cannot find him anymore anybody with
[45:31] me seek he the lord while he may be
[45:33] found calling upon him while he is near
[45:36] because there'll be a time when he'll no
[45:38] longer be near verse 7 let the wicked
[45:40] forsake his way
[45:42] and the unrighteous man his thoughts and
[45:44] let him return because he once was in a
[45:46] better place than he is now but let him
[45:48] return unto the lord and he will have
[45:51] mercy upon him he could only have mercy
[45:54] upon him because of the pre-existing
[45:56] relationship that he had with him
[45:58] because god only came to get those who
[46:00] he had a relationship with by writing
[46:03] their names by predestinating them by
[46:05] calling them can the church say amen and
[46:08] to our god for he will abundantly pardon
[46:11] let us go to the book of revelation 10
[46:13] and we have been in this for a few weeks
[46:16] but i want to touch on revelation 10
[46:17] from verse 5
[46:19] and the angel which i saw stand upon the
[46:21] sea and upon the earth lifted up his
[46:24] hand to heaven and swear by him that
[46:26] liveth forever and ever who created
[46:29] heaven and the things that therein are
[46:31] and the earth and the things that
[46:33] therein are and the sea and the things
[46:35] which are therein that there should be
[46:38] time no longer but in the days of the
[46:42] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[46:45] begin to sound the mystery of god should
[46:47] be finished as he had declared to his
[46:50] servants the prophets and our final
[46:53] scripture reading revelation 22.
[46:56] [Music]
[46:58] i spoke two weeks ago on this same
[47:01] subject but i want to pull something
[47:02] else out of it revelation 22 we're going
[47:05] to read from verse 10
[47:08] and he say it unto me
[47:10] seal not the sayings of the prophecy of
[47:13] this book for the time is at hand
[47:16] he that is unjust
[47:19] let him be unjust still
[47:21] and he
[47:22] which is filthy let him be filthy still
[47:25] and he that is righteous let him be
[47:27] righteous still and he that is holy let
[47:30] him be holy still and behold i come
[47:33] quickly and my reward is with me to give
[47:37] every man according as his work shall be
[47:40] i am alpha and omega the beginning and
[47:42] the end the first and the last may the
[47:45] lord had a blessing to the reading of
[47:46] his word you may be seated this morning
[47:50] amen certainly a privilege to be in the
[47:53] house of the lord so i do have a title
[47:56] this morning
[47:57] and it is connected to a message i spoke
[48:01] over seven years ago
[48:03] but as i was meditating this came back
[48:06] to me strong so i believe it's for
[48:08] somebody
[48:09] this morning so i have a title do not
[48:11] cross the line final warning
[48:15] do not cross the line final warning
[48:19] and a subject connecting to the subject
[48:21] but over it had last week make your
[48:24] calling and election show
[48:26] and an inspiration time
[48:29] no longer
[48:31] and before i left home this morning i
[48:32] was sharing some things with my wife and
[48:35] i was like you know i think i'll mention
[48:36] it this morning
[48:38] i said you look at the
[48:39] workplace today you look at society
[48:42] today
[48:43] you know and and to do anything in life
[48:45] you need to be inspired
[48:49] to do anything in life that's worth
[48:51] doing you need to be inspired
[48:54] you need to be motivated
[48:56] there needs to be something to drive you
[48:58] to achieve it
[49:00] if somebody has to wake you up in the
[49:02] morning to do what is important then you
[49:04] are not inspired
[49:06] you are not motivated
[49:08] so i was sharing with her you know the
[49:09] reality is
[49:11] my role and i was using it in a natural
[49:13] context is not to motivate people to do
[49:16] certain things
[49:18] because there are people in this world
[49:19] who are motivated and the people who are
[49:20] not motivated
[49:23] it is very difficult to motivate
[49:25] somebody who don't want to be motivated
[49:28] it is difficult to motivate somebody who
[49:30] don't want to achieve and who i don't
[49:31] want to grow and so so it is an effort
[49:34] you have to have a real burden
[49:38] if somebody's supposed to be doing
[49:40] something and you have to encourage them
[49:41] to do what's good for them
[49:44] if you know you're not supposed to eat
[49:45] certain things are you supposed to eat
[49:47] more vegetables i can't be calling every
[49:49] day to motivate you to eat vegetables
[49:53] i could do it for a while but afterward
[49:55] by punch i will get tired
[49:57] because at some point in time you
[49:58] supposed to know this is for your own
[50:00] good
[50:02] at some point in time you supposed to
[50:04] wake up for yourself i'm not needy alarm
[50:06] because you know you have certain things
[50:08] to do
[50:09] when somebody is motivated they can't
[50:11] wait to get up you know
[50:12] if you have something to do if you're
[50:14] excited ever and when people want to fly
[50:17] overseas and think are they excited to
[50:19] go on a trip somebody sent a ticket for
[50:20] you until they come up come up to new
[50:22] york comes and you're excited you could
[50:24] hardly sleep
[50:25] because excitement over here to get up
[50:27] to do something else your dear day wake
[50:29] them up you're telling me you're telling
[50:30] me when you're excited to do something
[50:32] nobody had to wake up you know you're
[50:34] packed three days ago because you can't
[50:35] wait to go you can't wait to
[50:37] experience something new and because of
[50:40] the interest and experience in that
[50:42] nobody has to motivate you
[50:45] you carry your own motivation you carry
[50:48] your own battery nobody to charge you
[50:51] you carry you have your own charger
[50:56] and something really struck me and it's
[50:58] in the natural and it's in the spiritual
[51:00] because the bible says in peter for god
[51:03] give us all things
[51:05] pertaining to life and godliness
[51:08] so a believer who overcomes in the
[51:10] spiritual will overcoming the natural
[51:13] and there's a connection between
[51:15] overcoming in the natural and overcoming
[51:17] in the spiritual it's connected
[51:22] so motivation has to come from within
[51:25] you have to be motivated you have to be
[51:28] inspired to be a christian
[51:31] it cannot be every sunday the preachers
[51:33] have to work up and and praise god and
[51:36] and come when you can make it you don't
[51:37] know yet that you could make it
[51:39] you don't know yet that god called you
[51:41] every sunday you had to be a world cup
[51:43] and a wind up on a let me turn it and
[51:46] get it there we kick start every sunday
[51:48] you need a kick start everything there's
[51:49] jumper cables every sunday is paddles
[51:52] give us some more people who are
[51:54] motivated who are inspired in the
[51:58] natural in the spiritual you can't wait
[52:01] to do what you're called to do
[52:05] you may be seated
[52:06] it's not that motivated people don't
[52:08] have challenges
[52:10] it's not that multi-page people don't
[52:12] have obstacles
[52:14] it's not that things don't go wrong but
[52:16] their motivation and their desire and
[52:18] their inspiration and something in them
[52:21] drives them that no matter what the odds
[52:24] against all odds
[52:26] against all opposition against all
[52:29] challenges against all situations
[52:32] against what the doctor says against
[52:34] what the government said against what
[52:37] your neighbors say against what your
[52:39] boss says against what the devil says it
[52:41] doesn't matter because you are driven
[52:43] from within you don't need somebody on
[52:46] the outside to tell you you can make it
[52:48] you know you can make it you don't need
[52:50] something to tell you you could overcome
[52:52] you know you could overcome even if
[52:54] you're down in the ditch you know you
[52:56] can overcome even though you fell you
[52:59] know overcoming is built in so a
[53:01] motivated son will get back up no matter
[53:05] what goes wrong no matter what happens
[53:08] something on the inside tells you
[53:11] lift up your head square back your
[53:14] shoulder
[53:15] [Applause]
[53:17] more than a conqueror
[53:19] more than an overcomer
[53:21] [Applause]
[53:25] you have to be inspired to smile
[53:30] motivated to smile because sometimes
[53:32] life beats you up and you don't want to
[53:33] smile
[53:34] you don't feel like smiling you don't
[53:36] feel like laughing you don't feel like
[53:38] being positive but something on the
[53:40] inside get you to look above that
[53:42] situation
[53:44] [Music]
[53:46] these struggles of life i don't know why
[53:48] i'm saying this there's nothing on my
[53:49] nose it's not anywhere here but i just
[53:51] woke up this morning saying we need to
[53:52] be inspired
[53:54] because if you're not inspired and
[53:56] you're leaning on somebody else when
[53:58] they're not here you can't stand and we
[54:00] need to stand whether nobody is there or
[54:02] not
[54:04] and it can only stand if you're inspired
[54:06] you can only stand if you have what it
[54:08] takes
[54:10] [Applause]
[54:13] not about looking around who doing what
[54:15] who's saying what who pressing i don't
[54:17] care who person i'm motivated for the
[54:19] rapture
[54:22] listen i ain't cut out for the
[54:23] tribulation you know
[54:26] i'm being honest
[54:27] i'm not built for that
[54:29] i'm not built for that i'm not gonna
[54:31] make it i'm not gonna survive in the
[54:32] tribulation so the best thing for me to
[54:34] do is make the rapture
[54:36] [Music]
[54:38] i ain't cut out for that tribulation
[54:40] stress not me
[54:42] i know how much stress i could take that
[54:43] stress not that stress give me this
[54:46] stress that shaped me into the word
[54:48] image so i can
[54:51] manifest perfect love because perfect
[54:53] love
[54:55] is what will take me there rapturing
[54:58] condition
[55:01] anybody with me this morning i will take
[55:04] this stress any day tribulation stress i
[55:07] can't handle that wheeling and wailing
[55:10] and gnashing of teeth i can't handle
[55:11] that
[55:13] [Applause]
[55:15] take me through the test take me to the
[55:18] child take me through the water
[55:20] take me through the flood oh cow come on
[55:23] now somebody help me anybody in the
[55:25] house this morning
[55:28] [Applause]
[55:32] no matter what comes your way
[55:35] you have a choice and that choice
[55:36] inspires you
[55:39] you want to buy a house you have to be
[55:40] motivated the house don't gonna happen
[55:46] it takes a plan it takes a sacrifice it
[55:49] takes effort it takes savings it takes
[55:52] research it takes understanding
[55:56] to make the right decision
[55:58] you have to be motivated to make the
[56:00] right decision
[56:02] in life and in god
[56:08] [Applause]
[56:11] there's a good way
[56:13] there's a better way and there's a
[56:14] perfect way i want us to see the
[56:17] difference you could get away with a
[56:18] good way you know
[56:21] you can get to it a better way but i
[56:23] want the perfect way
[56:25] if there's the best way to do something
[56:27] why do it half-hearted
[56:30] that's what the brandon preach god don't
[56:31] make her free christian with a christian
[56:33] community halfway
[56:34] why it can't be a real hundred percent
[56:36] version a real authentic version a real
[56:39] true version
[56:44] some days every day i don't know why i'm
[56:45] here this morning
[56:53] motivated
[56:55] inspired
[57:01] and you know what helps that you have to
[57:03] love what you do
[57:09] i was saying to my wife some time ago
[57:11] nobody has to wake me up to do my work
[57:15] sometime four o'clock in the morning i'm
[57:17] up
[57:18] working
[57:20] preparing
[57:24] because you know what god put us here to
[57:26] work in them
[57:27] [Music]
[57:30] i said it before there's no scripture
[57:31] for retirement
[57:33] it doesn't exist in the bible
[57:35] there's rest
[57:37] god after seven days rested
[57:41] as the sixth rested
[57:44] he didn't retire
[57:46] he rested
[57:48] if you finish your traditional work your
[57:50] work changed the winning souls
[57:54] your work becomes your prayer your work
[57:56] becomes your worship your work becomes
[57:59] intercession
[58:00] [Applause]
[58:04] your transition from the natural needs
[58:07] to the spiritual ones
[58:11] but they still have a plan because god
[58:13] we went through this in bible studies
[58:14] without a plan what are you without a
[58:15] vision what are you doing
[58:19] you get everyday aimless you have no
[58:21] plan you have no desire where do you die
[58:23] you know now
[58:25] whatever happened happen
[58:27] i do my due i don't walk 10 years so
[58:29] what now so god put yourself float you
[58:31] are a balloon
[58:35] whether you win carrier you float
[58:40] people lose the motivation
[58:42] you have to love the kingdom of god
[58:48] you have to love serving people
[58:51] you have to love being a christian it
[58:53] can be a grudging christian and you're
[58:54] you're forced to walk this journey
[58:56] nobody forcing you god enforcing you you
[58:59] have a choice
[59:00] but if you choose this thing fall in
[59:02] love with it
[59:03] and we have more than enough reasons to
[59:05] fall in love with jesus and i can
[59:07] guarantee you falling in love with jesus
[59:10] is sweeter every day than the day before
[59:13] [Applause]
[59:15] i don't know why i'm saying these things
[59:16] this morning but i don't even who is
[59:18] going to help or how it's going to help
[59:20] [Applause]
[59:30] never forget something where the nico
[59:32] told me he's if you love somebody
[59:34] and and and she in toku and you in
[59:37] porter spain you're gonna find yourself
[59:39] up here you know
[59:41] because that's what love does make you
[59:42] do
[59:43] love does make you do some crazy things
[59:45] lovers make it a crazy kind of way love
[59:47] does make you save extra find ways to
[59:50] make things work
[59:52] and if you love god then you will find
[59:55] ways to make this thing work because the
[59:57] god i serve he found ways to make this
[59:59] thing work he left glory take on a
[1:00:02] different form to tuck your take your
[1:00:05] place to make this thing work he has
[1:00:07] done listen you may be seated i don't
[1:00:09] know why i'm saying this this morning
[1:00:12] but in our marriage it takes the two
[1:00:14] sides to make it work enough
[1:00:17] well i have news for you god has never
[1:00:20] not kept his side of the bargain
[1:00:23] you could never accuse god of not doing
[1:00:26] his part in this relationship
[1:00:28] because every time you call him he
[1:00:30] answers whenever you need him he's there
[1:00:33] when he needs a shoulder to cry on he
[1:00:35] can count on him because he stands
[1:00:37] closer than a brother closer than a
[1:00:39] friend
[1:00:40] [Applause]
[1:00:50] hallelujah this helping anybody this
[1:00:52] morning
[1:00:53] so we need to look at ourselves
[1:00:56] because brother branham said if you ever
[1:00:58] lose your connection with god
[1:01:00] then retrace your steps because god
[1:01:03] don't walk away from us
[1:01:05] we are the ones walk away from him so
[1:01:07] you want to find him start to retrace
[1:01:10] your steps
[1:01:11] go back to where you left him
[1:01:13] [Applause]
[1:01:16] [Music]
[1:01:21] young people oh people tell me i lose my
[1:01:23] joy i'm not gonna be kind of joy i mean
[1:01:26] how much effort are you putting into
[1:01:28] this relationship
[1:01:35] how much
[1:01:36] effort you need dating somebody yeah you
[1:01:40] want to call them until
[1:01:41] if you're serious about anything you
[1:01:43] wouldn't call them once a year usc you
[1:01:45] are you are serious you you won games
[1:01:53] the lord teres
[1:01:54] help the brother who trying to talk to
[1:01:56] my daughter
[1:02:01] how much time he called
[1:02:09] i'll teach her the litmus test
[1:02:15] to filter who's serious i'm not serious
[1:02:21] because if you call in once a year
[1:02:23] in the dating where would be any
[1:02:24] marriage
[1:02:29] we need to do our marriage conference
[1:02:30] that whole separate thing because a lot
[1:02:32] of people telling me how it wasn't as
[1:02:33] good as it was when it was dated so so
[1:02:35] if we if we start in back we only get
[1:02:37] worse
[1:02:42] see the immense drive there but i don't
[1:02:43] let me come back let me reverse the car
[1:02:45] hit the reverse make a u-turn 3.4
[1:02:48] pointer and come on that street
[1:02:50] come out that street
[1:02:54] leave that street alone
[1:02:59] people say come over here
[1:03:02] not today
[1:03:05] but it takes work
[1:03:08] it takes work
[1:03:11] natural marriage takes work
[1:03:13] it takes work to succeed in your
[1:03:15] business and your job and anything takes
[1:03:17] effort it was work for god you know
[1:03:20] on the first day he worked on the second
[1:03:21] day he worked and he under then he
[1:03:23] rested
[1:03:24] and then he didn't stop because the
[1:03:26] moment things fell apart he started the
[1:03:28] rebuilding effort and he hasn't stopped
[1:03:30] yet
[1:03:31] [Music]
[1:03:37] we spoke about entitlement people just
[1:03:40] are so entitled they want things to work
[1:03:42] for them without work
[1:03:50] friends you have to be motivated
[1:03:53] yourself to get your work done
[1:03:56] anybody with me this morning
[1:03:58] let me check my time
[1:04:00] i trust that was that's my opening
[1:04:02] comments i have no note for that but
[1:04:05] but the grace of god
[1:04:07] trusted bless somebody so
[1:04:09] just to touch in my text a little bit
[1:04:11] for a few minutes being conscious of
[1:04:15] the
[1:04:17] natural
[1:04:19] situation i just call it that
[1:04:23] do not cross the line final warning
[1:04:27] i would have preached this message over
[1:04:28] seven years ago to the young people
[1:04:33] and
[1:04:35] back then it was prompted by
[1:04:38] something i read in a quote
[1:04:40] that affected me then
[1:04:43] and it still affects me now
[1:04:48] it affects me more now
[1:04:51] because god has allowed certain things
[1:04:53] to unfold
[1:04:54] to filter and test who is motivated
[1:05:01] you'll see how it connected now right
[1:05:05] and i want to read a quote because this
[1:05:10] is in the deity of jesus christ
[1:05:13] brother branham said father we come this
[1:05:15] morning as your humble children
[1:05:18] i realize that we are living in the last
[1:05:20] hour closing time
[1:05:23] something can happen at any time
[1:05:27] men women boys or girls here are without
[1:05:30] god
[1:05:35] and i pray thee father you be merciful
[1:05:39] i pray thee to be merciful to those
[1:05:42] who have received
[1:05:45] and now realize that you're near in
[1:05:47] their
[1:05:48] hearts and realizing that little things
[1:05:52] of the world
[1:05:55] little things of the world it does not
[1:05:58] big things
[1:06:00] little things of the world through cares
[1:06:04] the things we care about the things that
[1:06:06] we concern ourselves about the way we
[1:06:09] spend our time i pray god that every one
[1:06:11] of them this morning will be really
[1:06:14] consecrated to you for the coming days
[1:06:16] to come
[1:06:18] if this quote was ever relevant it's
[1:06:21] today it's now
[1:06:24] how much longer we're going to wait
[1:06:27] before you're coming
[1:06:29] we believe it's right at hand now and
[1:06:31] after a while listen to the prophet
[1:06:34] they're going to try to get saved
[1:06:39] so an attempt will be made brother
[1:06:41] benjamin
[1:06:43] an attempt will be made young people to
[1:06:46] get saved
[1:06:47] to get it right to get it together
[1:06:51] and i'm thinking
[1:06:53] brother branham said of those young
[1:06:55] people that night
[1:06:57] down there at the altar trying to be
[1:07:00] saved
[1:07:01] but had crossed the line
[1:07:04] no redemption for them
[1:07:07] they were gone
[1:07:08] could not be saved
[1:07:14] you process that
[1:07:17] how could a merciful god
[1:07:19] how could a god who wants to bless and
[1:07:22] wants to redeem allow you to come to the
[1:07:24] altar and now say
[1:07:27] can't do it
[1:07:29] it is not that he cannot do it it's
[1:07:30] because the time for doing it is gone
[1:07:34] the opportunity to do it is gone
[1:07:37] the chance to do it is gone
[1:07:39] you had it and now it's taken back
[1:07:45] so we're going to touch on this tonight
[1:07:48] today
[1:07:49] as i go through a few things and when
[1:07:51] i've read this then and i have a few
[1:07:52] other things i want to comment on
[1:07:54] this morning to shake us
[1:07:57] because i've observed during this
[1:07:59] pandemic
[1:08:01] the issue with the pandemic is not the
[1:08:03] world
[1:08:07] the issue with the pandemic is not the
[1:08:09] church
[1:08:11] the issue of the pandemic is filtering a
[1:08:14] bride
[1:08:31] i remember before i got married
[1:08:34] i think i told my wife this brother hugh
[1:08:36] williams said to me
[1:08:37] i don't know if you remember this
[1:08:40] whenever you get married
[1:08:42] make sure
[1:08:43] you know how the person is when they get
[1:08:45] angry but here you remember telling me
[1:08:46] that
[1:08:50] he said make sure you know how the
[1:08:51] person is when they get angry
[1:08:57] but the thing of it is
[1:08:58] it's an interesting thing to think about
[1:09:01] because typically in in the nice part of
[1:09:04] the fears there you do already have you
[1:09:06] do you do your best to not get people
[1:09:08] upset
[1:09:10] so it's almost what we call counter
[1:09:12] intuitive
[1:09:14] to have a scenario or a scenario must
[1:09:17] present itself
[1:09:18] because you can't be guilty of
[1:09:19] orchestrating it
[1:09:25] but you want to know if when this person
[1:09:27] gets angry if a plate will come flying
[1:09:29] with such able precision
[1:09:33] that it will connect with that point
[1:09:35] right behind your head where you'll snap
[1:09:37] to a reality that you did something
[1:09:38] wrong
[1:09:41] but the reality is this you only get to
[1:09:44] know people when situations change
[1:09:51] and this is connected to the virtues
[1:09:53] because for you to demonstrate
[1:09:56] temperance
[1:09:58] and patience
[1:09:59] and godliness
[1:10:01] and brotherly kindness
[1:10:03] situations in our lives must change
[1:10:09] that allow
[1:10:11] an assessment of our behavior under
[1:10:13] these very pressures and these varied
[1:10:17] testings
[1:10:18] and what i love about god god don't have
[1:10:21] no skip in class and not passing the
[1:10:23] test and he's not marking only on the
[1:10:26] curve brother stephen there's no curve
[1:10:28] you have to pass
[1:10:30] and the tutor is passing by assessment
[1:10:34] and only he ever say in the assessment
[1:10:36] i can't put in a word for you i'm sorry
[1:10:40] so i'm saying this pandemic has created
[1:10:43] a situation where now people have to
[1:10:46] give a true account you know
[1:10:49] and the account is not to the pastor
[1:10:52] because during the lockdown where we
[1:10:53] couldn't gather together
[1:10:55] you have to decide
[1:10:57] if you're going to connect to a service
[1:10:59] you have to decide
[1:11:01] not god completely completely did what
[1:11:05] he has wanted to do for a long time you
[1:11:07] know put a test to the people to see if
[1:11:09] they really wanted themselves
[1:11:19] by looking at your approach to god not
[1:11:21] your approach to church you know because
[1:11:23] if you don't see it as god trying to
[1:11:24] build a relationship with you using
[1:11:26] different ways and you miss the picture
[1:11:29] but your approach to god
[1:11:31] and i started to think about this cross
[1:11:33] in the line thing are we going to get
[1:11:34] into a few things
[1:11:36] not much but a few
[1:11:40] it's a choice you make when on a
[1:11:43] wednesday night you have to connect a
[1:11:44] service and you actually make a choice
[1:11:46] you know what
[1:11:47] today i'm not connecting because of x y
[1:11:49] and z and it's in your power to connect
[1:11:51] and you don't connect
[1:11:53] you know whatever i'm talking about
[1:11:54] that's still small voice that conscience
[1:11:56] speaking to you that warns you he said
[1:11:58] after a while when that voice say you
[1:12:00] know he's supposed to be in service
[1:12:02] you know he's supposed to be a primitive
[1:12:05] you know you're supposed to be in church
[1:12:07] he said every time that voice speaks to
[1:12:09] you and you ignore it the voice gets
[1:12:12] quiet
[1:12:14] a little more quiet
[1:12:15] a little more quiet
[1:12:17] and then after a while you're not going
[1:12:18] to hear me anymore
[1:12:27] let me say it again
[1:12:28] because that voice
[1:12:30] was placed there to guide you you know
[1:12:33] and that voice don't tell you to do the
[1:12:34] wrong thing you're supposed to forgive
[1:12:37] no
[1:12:37] you know you did the wrong thing you
[1:12:39] know you lie
[1:12:40] you know that's not the right approach
[1:12:42] you know you didn't have to say it that
[1:12:43] way you know you're supposed to be in
[1:12:45] church you know that's not how you're
[1:12:46] supposed to speak to your father you
[1:12:47] know that's not how i speak speak to
[1:12:48] your mother you know that's not how
[1:12:50] speaking to the deacon you know the
[1:12:51] pastor telling you to do something and
[1:12:52] you're doing something different
[1:12:55] and we make choices
[1:12:58] to lodging volume
[1:13:02] until there's a point where the volume
[1:13:04] is off
[1:13:07] and by the brandon describes it as you
[1:13:09] lose your sensitivity
[1:13:16] even me speaking this morning here in
[1:13:18] the church
[1:13:19] and through the internet there's a voice
[1:13:22] speaking to you telling you pay
[1:13:24] attention
[1:13:25] we're going on a certain road here that
[1:13:27] that you don't want to miss this thing
[1:13:28] here
[1:13:31] because we're in a life and death i
[1:13:32] never call it don't cross the line to
[1:13:35] look at the final warning because we
[1:13:37] don't have time left
[1:13:40] he was filthy filthy still he was
[1:13:42] righteous righteous still the angel
[1:13:44] already declared time no longer
[1:13:51] don't hush that voice
[1:13:55] that voice tells you to repent
[1:13:57] just dive in that water repentance that
[1:14:00] water
[1:14:01] that that void make things right you
[1:14:03] make it right one time
[1:14:11] back then i said it and i say it again
[1:14:13] today my heart is heavy
[1:14:16] burdened by what's happening all around
[1:14:17] us more so now than seven years ago
[1:14:23] but ibrahim said it influenced what we
[1:14:25] have seen happen should put every soul
[1:14:27] into action to make a church that would
[1:14:29] make a revival
[1:14:31] we have to be motivated to do that
[1:14:34] not depend on nobody some years ago my
[1:14:36] brother say well i'm not seeing this and
[1:14:37] i'm not seeing anything what are you
[1:14:39] doing
[1:14:40] because i'm not looking at what other
[1:14:42] people doing
[1:14:43] i'm doing brother eclair's everything
[1:14:44] that i could do
[1:14:48] i'm trouble today because of falling
[1:14:50] away young people
[1:14:52] calebs
[1:14:54] people who should know better
[1:14:56] need to return to their first love
[1:14:59] [Music]
[1:15:00] [Applause]
[1:15:03] and i want to challenge and i would have
[1:15:05] preached this message years ago to young
[1:15:07] people i want to start with parents
[1:15:13] because like it or not
[1:15:16] you set a tone for your house
[1:15:20] in particular the fathers and the head
[1:15:22] of homes set a tone for your house
[1:15:26] you set a cadence a beat a rhythm
[1:15:30] a way things flow
[1:15:38] you have more work to do
[1:15:40] if you have people under your care
[1:15:43] i love what is the donor said on friday
[1:15:46] she was doing all she could do to help
[1:15:47] her family but she realized you know
[1:15:48] what let her put on her mask first you
[1:15:50] know in a plane
[1:15:52] they say the planes have to depressurize
[1:15:54] if you have to help somebody else
[1:15:56] put on your mask first
[1:15:58] because if you don't put on your mask
[1:16:00] first or look at both getting the
[1:16:01] problems
[1:16:03] so you fix your mask first
[1:16:05] so that you get an oxygen you could help
[1:16:07] somebody else
[1:16:09] because the moment you start to lose
[1:16:10] oxygen your brain don't function as well
[1:16:13] you know
[1:16:13] you start to make poor decisions
[1:16:16] and so too in the spiritual we have a
[1:16:18] great responsibility parents
[1:16:24] to give an account and to accept
[1:16:26] responsibility for what god has placed
[1:16:29] under our care
[1:16:37] it is difficult for me to conceptualize
[1:16:40] complaining
[1:16:41] about children
[1:16:44] when more could be done in your prayer
[1:16:46] closet
[1:16:50] and more spiritual understanding could
[1:16:52] take place because there's always a
[1:16:55] better way
[1:16:57] and we have to strive to find a better
[1:17:00] way
[1:17:01] we have to strive to even move beyond
[1:17:03] the better way to the perfect way
[1:17:07] because it takes wisdom the bible says a
[1:17:09] wise man is who could win souls you know
[1:17:14] and sometimes within our own homes we
[1:17:16] have to be working to win souls
[1:17:21] we have to be able to convince to
[1:17:22] persuade to encourage to show to
[1:17:24] demonstrate to explain to invite
[1:17:28] peter didn't just come like that jesus
[1:17:29] invited him you know
[1:17:32] jesus had to know his approach to invite
[1:17:34] peter you know
[1:17:36] you ever thought of it
[1:17:38] what was jesus approach to convince
[1:17:40] peter to follow him
[1:17:43] what is your approach in your own home
[1:17:45] to be contending for the life of christ
[1:17:47] i'm not asking you to be perfect to be
[1:17:50] but
[1:17:50] your approach matters
[1:17:55] anybody with me i don't know why i'm
[1:17:56] going here this morning but this is what
[1:17:58] allah put in my heart
[1:18:01] so i'm troubled because i'm falling away
[1:18:03] and back then i was speaking to young
[1:18:05] people but it's also adults
[1:18:08] seasoned people who have lost their
[1:18:10] burden and they would say
[1:18:11] i am motivated i need a push i need a
[1:18:13] charge where why where where is your
[1:18:15] battery pack where's your charger
[1:18:19] where do you connect what do you connect
[1:18:21] to to get your charge
[1:18:23] because church is just a place to get
[1:18:25] you inspired to go again you know but
[1:18:27] the reality is every day you're supposed
[1:18:28] to be
[1:18:29] listen
[1:18:30] if you if you don't charge your phone
[1:18:32] every day
[1:18:33] we've had it if you don't pay your phone
[1:18:35] it will die you know
[1:18:39] think about it people they if you take
[1:18:40] their phone they're in trouble
[1:18:49] i saw somebody put out
[1:18:51] an ad
[1:18:53] don't get covered
[1:18:55] because somebody in your family will
[1:18:56] have your phone for 14 days
[1:19:06] our phones are so precious to us
[1:19:09] few if any forget to charge it
[1:19:13] in fact people get upset you see the
[1:19:15] charger
[1:19:17] who movement charger
[1:19:18] i left it who take it with a boring
[1:19:20] charger and and it's a big issue don't
[1:19:22] touch my charger this is my charger
[1:19:25] because you want to make sure your phone
[1:19:28] that's supposed to keep it connected to
[1:19:29] all kinds of stuff remains charged
[1:19:32] people will change course
[1:19:35] to get up to buy a charger to make sure
[1:19:37] that they phone charge
[1:19:40] people take preventative action like
[1:19:42] switching off their phone
[1:19:43] just to preserve battery life you can
[1:19:45] have to make an important callers and
[1:19:46] they don't afford to run out you could
[1:19:48] have to make a call
[1:19:49] anybody can talk about it
[1:19:52] and you want to live life as a christian
[1:19:54] without charging
[1:20:00] how could you overcome and how we expect
[1:20:03] to make calls in life and i want to see
[1:20:05] the calls in life being calls about
[1:20:07] decisions and choices and you want a
[1:20:09] call you want to make a call to know if
[1:20:11] to do something you want to make a call
[1:20:13] to everybody's right to approach you
[1:20:14] want to make a call to know how to move
[1:20:16] on your job you want to make a call on
[1:20:18] how to and you have no battery your
[1:20:20] phone dead
[1:20:23] and when you could thank you brother
[1:20:26] when you could get guidance from making
[1:20:27] a call you have no guidance
[1:20:30] because now you have to rely on your own
[1:20:32] strengths
[1:20:35] when you could call god any time
[1:20:43] simple message you know because people
[1:20:45] have all kind of mysteries and knowledge
[1:20:46] and information and no listeners and
[1:20:48] they're not praying every day
[1:20:50] check yourself
[1:20:52] we look at your operations we look at
[1:20:54] the priorities
[1:20:57] so to help you remind you maybe we could
[1:20:58] connect you too because you're
[1:21:00] disciplined to charge your phone
[1:21:02] so when you plug on your phone leave it
[1:21:03] and go and pray
[1:21:07] tie the activities together because you
[1:21:08] don't forget you see me don't forget to
[1:21:10] charge your phone so once you see it
[1:21:11] when you think about phone and charging
[1:21:13] an aim of battery running there hey my
[1:21:15] spiritual battery boy
[1:21:16] one time start to connect the two
[1:21:18] together
[1:21:19] make a connection
[1:21:20] that's how learning takes place so
[1:21:22] i don't need to teach you to charge your
[1:21:24] phone but when you see your battery
[1:21:26] going low and say well let me tap up my
[1:21:27] battery let me talk to god a little bit
[1:21:29] because i getting a reminder that i need
[1:21:32] to talk to gordon and say good morning
[1:21:34] lord and i and i approach it should i
[1:21:36] take this maxi or the maxi behind it
[1:21:38] which one should i take the first seat
[1:21:40] right here the front rod or the back of
[1:21:42] the car
[1:21:45] should i submit my report no or two
[1:21:46] minutes from now on you'll be surprised
[1:21:49] how god can handle all of your questions
[1:21:51] and give you all of the guidance and
[1:21:54] you know what the bible said in all your
[1:21:57] ways acknowledge him
[1:22:00] i saw a friend of mine he's 70 something
[1:22:02] years old
[1:22:04] and he said isaac
[1:22:05] in all your ways acknowledge him and he
[1:22:08] will direct your part he said every
[1:22:10] meeting i go to i say lord i acknowledge
[1:22:12] you as i walk into this meeting and it
[1:22:14] was so simple as a principle
[1:22:17] but it broke it builds your relationship
[1:22:19] with god
[1:22:20] because we need to be walking around as
[1:22:21] if we have no relationship
[1:22:26] lord i acknowledge you go into a meeting
[1:22:28] just give me the right words help me
[1:22:29] right now let me know because if this is
[1:22:31] not for me i don't want to be in here

[1:22:33] the boldness and your wisdom to say the
[1:22:36] right way i had to talk about a 55-hour
[1:22:38] prayer before every meeting but it's a
[1:22:40] relationship so go to it but i know that
[1:22:43] voice that's better malay talking to me

[1:23:22] it's sister karen again it's just a
[1:23:23] rosemary again unless he says a rosemary
[1:23:25] again
[1:23:26] [Applause]
[1:23:32] anybody is this helping anybody
[1:23:35] relation because what god wants he will
[1:23:37] come any cooler evening to talk to adam
[1:23:39] every day
[1:23:43] it was a habit it was a coming that god
[1:23:46] wanted
[1:23:47] think about it
[1:23:49] after god went through he said listen i
[1:23:50] need to go on talk to adam until one day
[1:23:52] came and said adam adam where are you
[1:23:55] not that adam was physically lost but
[1:23:57] adam we can't talk the way we used to
[1:23:59] talk
[1:24:01] how much he must have pee in god
[1:24:03] because this whole plan of having
[1:24:04] relationship had been interrupted
[1:24:07] and what was interrupted relationship
[1:24:10] anybody this morning with me
[1:24:13] let me try to
[1:24:14] find a place here time is source going
[1:24:16] so quickly
[1:24:18] but it comes as no surprise to us
[1:24:20] because brother branham told us there'll
[1:24:21] be a falling away
[1:24:24] people just can't stand anymore
[1:24:26] they just allow but what caused it you
[1:24:28] know what causes it the cares of this
[1:24:29] will you know
[1:24:31] the distractions the social media the
[1:24:33] news the entertainment the old talk the
[1:24:36] gossip the the everything else that just
[1:24:38] come to choke your life and you don't
[1:24:40] realize it until you're
[1:24:43] not dead in the grave no spiritually
[1:24:45] dead separated from god you're in church
[1:24:47] but you're dead
[1:24:49] because your joy gone because you
[1:24:51] haven't felt it your worship gone
[1:24:53] because you gave all your effort and
[1:24:54] your time to things that don't matter
[1:25:00] [Applause]
[1:25:04] i'm gonna have to find a place to close
[1:25:05] i don't know if i have to finish this
[1:25:06] message some other time but i want to
[1:25:08] read a scripture here for you
[1:25:10] in hebrews 6 and i want to read it
[1:25:12] let me get it here
[1:25:19] because i'm speaking to believers this
[1:25:20] morning this whole message about
[1:25:22] crossing the line and do not cross the
[1:25:24] line was the people who have a desire to
[1:25:27] get it right at some point you know
[1:25:29] to return
[1:25:32] but their desire to return by the end it
[1:25:34] was just a little bit too late
[1:25:37] when they could have fixed it and got it
[1:25:38] right and make things right and repent
[1:25:40] and get the holy ghost and i have the
[1:25:42] quotes for it
[1:25:43] they will live in two borderline but
[1:25:45] around them call it living on the edge
[1:25:47] borderline believers
[1:25:52] this is a scripture to address this
[1:25:55] falling away
[1:25:57] in hebrews 6 whether the bible says
[1:25:59] therefore hebrews 6 1
[1:26:02] leaving the principles
[1:26:04] of the doctrine of christ
[1:26:07] let us go on unto perfection
[1:26:12] not laying again the foundation of
[1:26:15] repentance from dead works and of fear
[1:26:17] towards god
[1:26:19] of the doctrine of baptism and of laying
[1:26:21] on of hands and of resurrection of the
[1:26:24] dead and of
[1:26:25] eternal judgment
[1:26:29] and this will we do if god permit
[1:26:32] for it is impossible for those who were
[1:26:35] once enlightened
[1:26:39] and have tasted of the heavenly gift
[1:26:42] and were made partakers of the holy
[1:26:44] ghost
[1:26:45] and have tasted the good word of god
[1:26:48] and the powers of the world to come
[1:26:51] if they shall fall away to renew them
[1:26:55] again unto repentance
[1:26:58] seeing they crucify to themselves the
[1:27:00] son of god afresh
[1:27:02] and put him to an open shame
[1:27:06] i want to read it in the amplified
[1:27:08] therefore let us go on and get past the
[1:27:10] elementary stage
[1:27:13] in the teachings and doctrines of christ
[1:27:15] the messiah
[1:27:16] advancing steadily toward the
[1:27:19] completeness
[1:27:20] and perfection that belong to spiritual
[1:27:23] maturity
[1:27:25] anybody wants to be spiritually mature
[1:27:27] and take our conversations into
[1:27:29] spiritual maturity not as i said
[1:27:31] cranking up every sunday oh gosh press
[1:27:33] press press press
[1:27:36] let us not again be laying the
[1:27:38] foundation of repentance and abandonment
[1:27:41] of dead works their formalism and of the
[1:27:43] faith by which you turn to god in other
[1:27:45] words we have to get past the elementary
[1:27:47] things
[1:27:48] we're teaching about purifying the
[1:27:50] laying on of hands and resurrection from
[1:27:52] the dead and internal judgment upon
[1:27:53] these are all matters of which you
[1:27:56] should have been fully aware long long
[1:27:58] ago
[1:28:01] so in paul's letter he is saying there's
[1:28:03] something that should be basic common
[1:28:05] understanding as a believer
[1:28:08] we can't keep rehashing the basics of
[1:28:10] worship and sanctification and living
[1:28:13] right and doing the right things
[1:28:16] anybody with me this morning
[1:28:19] if god permits we will now proceed to
[1:28:23] advance teaching this is the amplified
[1:28:24] of history
[1:28:26] for it is impossible to restore and
[1:28:29] bring again to repentance those who have
[1:28:32] been once for all enlightened who have
[1:28:35] consciously tasted the heavenly gift and
[1:28:38] have been sharers of the holy spirit
[1:28:42] and how felt how good the word of god is
[1:28:46] and the mighty powers of the age and the
[1:28:48] world to come
[1:28:50] if they then deviate from the fate and
[1:28:53] turn away from their allegiance it is
[1:28:55] impossible to bring them back to
[1:28:57] repentance for because while as long as
[1:29:00] they kneel upon the cross the son of god
[1:29:02] are fresh
[1:29:04] anybody with me this morning
[1:29:07] is this shaking anybody
[1:29:11] let me try to find a place to wrap this
[1:29:13] up
[1:29:16] i know there are many people
[1:29:19] young people calebs who are on fire
[1:29:21] who are pressing on who are fighting the
[1:29:24] good fight doing all that they could do
[1:29:27] to make it
[1:29:28] they are determining their hearts to
[1:29:30] stand and have it on all that they will
[1:29:32] stand
[1:29:34] i believe there are people like that in
[1:29:35] the house this one if there anybody like
[1:29:37] us in the house this morning
[1:29:38] no matter what comes your way come hell
[1:29:41] or high water you are determined to make
[1:29:43] it you are fully persuaded that nothing
[1:29:46] present nothing past nothing to come
[1:29:49] could separate you from the love of god
[1:29:51] which is in christ jesus
[1:29:54] and i salute you for your faith i salute
[1:29:57] you for your stand i salute you for your
[1:29:59] courage and confidence and love in this
[1:30:02] great vision of god that he has for you
[1:30:04] and that is wonderful it's not easy but
[1:30:07] we know we're going to make it it's not
[1:30:09] easy but we're going to keep on fighting
[1:30:11] we're going to keep on pressing
[1:30:14] but while we have those who have seen
[1:30:17] that i know that there are also people
[1:30:19] who are living on the edge
[1:30:23] standing on the edge of a line that they
[1:30:25] don't even know exists
[1:30:28] for a few minutes i want to speak about
[1:30:29] that line
[1:30:31] a line is used to divide an area of
[1:30:33] space
[1:30:35] a line helps you understand boundaries
[1:30:37] and limitations
[1:30:40] a line help maintain order and balance
[1:30:42] if there's no line in the middle of the
[1:30:43] road and people driving all they want
[1:30:45] you know what will happen
[1:30:49] lines help maintain order
[1:30:51] almighty god created heaven and earth
[1:30:53] and put a line between them
[1:30:56] a line doesn't have to be visible
[1:30:57] countries go to war because of the line
[1:31:00] that separates one from another you
[1:31:02] cross the border it's invisible
[1:31:06] but now you're in another land
[1:31:09] people die because of lines they do not
[1:31:11] see
[1:31:12] they cannot see
[1:31:14] you know many young people kill one
[1:31:16] another getting the fight
[1:31:17] over a word or an and the word that was
[1:31:19] spoken it's not a word that or the
[1:31:21] phrase and that's something somebody
[1:31:22] wasn't used to but they crossed a line
[1:31:24] an invisible line that triggered
[1:31:26] something in somebody else that they
[1:31:27] didn't realize that just took it too far
[1:31:30] anybody with me this morning
[1:31:33] there are some lines that are safe to
[1:31:35] cross and there are some lines that are
[1:31:36] not safe to cross
[1:31:38] whenever there's a nuclear meltdown or a
[1:31:40] chemical exposure or viral outbreak a
[1:31:43] lion is set up to keep those that have
[1:31:45] not been affected from becoming affected
[1:31:50] that is the line i'm speaking about
[1:31:52] today
[1:31:54] a line has been set to keep those who
[1:31:57] have not been affected from being
[1:31:58] affected it is very serious because if
[1:32:01] you cross the line there is no cure
[1:32:04] as we read the court no more redemption
[1:32:06] no more hope
[1:32:07] [Music]
[1:32:09] if you cross the line there is no coming
[1:32:10] back
[1:32:12] in brother branham's words for those who
[1:32:13] cross the line no redemption for them
[1:32:15] they were gone could not be saved
[1:32:18] final warning church
[1:32:20] where are you standing this morning
[1:32:23] if you are trying to live on the edge
[1:32:26] be careful
[1:32:27] and do not cross the line
[1:32:30] this line we are speaking about this
[1:32:32] morning separates the lord's side from
[1:32:34] the devil's side
[1:32:37] the only two sides it's not about
[1:32:39] doctrine is that about teaching it's
[1:32:41] about the lord
[1:32:42] and the rapture of the resurrection the
[1:32:44] millennium the holy city your
[1:32:46] inheritance your purpose your adoption
[1:32:48] your filling you're refilling your
[1:32:50] family that's on one side of the line
[1:32:54] and on the other side is torture and
[1:32:56] torment and wailing and judgment and
[1:32:58] gnashing on teeth and devils and demons
[1:33:00] of the devil himself
[1:33:03] where are you standing this morning
[1:33:08] so many so many people making decisions
[1:33:12] choices decisions
[1:33:14] and giving away their soul
[1:33:17] thinking they are comfortable being in
[1:33:19] church but they are standing right on
[1:33:21] the edge
[1:33:24] and because they are so close to the
[1:33:26] edge any slip you make you're falling
[1:33:28] over and if you fall over you're gone
[1:33:31] cannot be saved no more redemption
[1:33:35] borderline know the truth in church but
[1:33:38] you're just touching the edge of the
[1:33:40] line you're there doing things on social
[1:33:42] media having conversation with people
[1:33:45] doing things playing around with the
[1:33:46] world
[1:33:52] during this pandemic you're supposed to
[1:33:53] be connected to the service but you're
[1:33:55] doing something else that's the edge you
[1:33:56] know
[1:34:01] thinking nobody can see you no pastor no
[1:34:03] assistant pastor no elder no deacon
[1:34:05] nobody there and you're just there on
[1:34:07] your own
[1:34:12] thinking about the struggle of people
[1:34:14] coming to church years ago
[1:34:17] he had a story that were going through
[1:34:18] windows to come to church
[1:34:21] i think was since the donald said
[1:34:22] against her family
[1:34:24] support she got baptized
[1:34:27] you know many stories they are like that
[1:34:28] against their family and friends
[1:34:29] supporting them
[1:34:32] my own father against the family
[1:34:34] background he made a decision he had no
[1:34:36] support
[1:34:38] it was real but now church comes home
[1:34:43] because of the pandemic church has come
[1:34:45] home and now you could switch between
[1:34:47] and you're multitasking
[1:34:51] it is now like adding something to the
[1:34:54] menu of your life so you have your main
[1:34:56] course and church is now something i
[1:34:58] decide
[1:35:01] it's a add-on it's an extra it's a
[1:35:03] feature it's a benefit but it's not the
[1:35:05] product
[1:35:08] because no real control put in your
[1:35:11] hands for if you want to be a christian
[1:35:13] in your heart
[1:35:17] [Applause]
[1:35:20] help us this morning lord
[1:35:27] we're playing games
[1:35:29] we're playing games
[1:35:35] during the full lockdown we couldn't
[1:35:36] gather
[1:35:38] people who were used to getting up early
[1:35:40] in the morning i don't know anybody i'm
[1:35:41] not i'm not directing it as a specific
[1:35:43] person but the effort to get up in the
[1:35:45] morning and get ready and prepared for
[1:35:48] church and to travel to church and to
[1:35:50] get into the anointing and to pray at
[1:35:52] the service and to get ready for 10
[1:35:53] o'clock service
[1:35:56] people roll casually on their bed
[1:35:59] wait for a notification
[1:36:02] pick up the phone
[1:36:04] and rest it on the side of the bed
[1:36:10] at ease and zion and they're moving
[1:36:13] closer to the edge
[1:36:15] to the edge
[1:36:18] until it becomes like any other piece of
[1:36:20] content
[1:36:21] you know so i watch something on youtube
[1:36:23] and i want something else on youtube and
[1:36:24] i learn something and i do a course and
[1:36:27] i empower myself and i get a little word
[1:36:29] to feel empowered and stu's too too
[1:36:31] blessed to be stressed and i'm going to
[1:36:32] the rapture which rapture
[1:36:46] cross the line
[1:36:49] friends it's not about impressing me
[1:36:55] god gave his life
[1:36:57] and we want to be casual with this thing
[1:37:02] second peter three musicians get ready
[1:37:04] i'm humbled
[1:37:05] the lord is not slack concerning his
[1:37:07] promise
[1:37:08] as some men count slackness
[1:37:11] but is long-suffering to us what not
[1:37:13] willing that any should perish
[1:37:16] but that all should come to repentance
[1:37:21] long suffering
[1:37:23] long suffering
[1:37:26] god will do he will wait as long as he
[1:37:27] can wait
[1:37:28] he will call as long as he can call he
[1:37:31] will invite as long as he can invite
[1:37:34] not willing that enemy shall perish
[1:37:36] it is not god's desire to kill you
[1:37:40] his desire is to reconcile you to
[1:37:42] himself
[1:37:44] do we understand that do we appreciate
[1:37:47] that are we convinced of that are we
[1:37:50] concerned about that
[1:37:54] but the day of the lord shall come as a
[1:37:56] thief in the night in which heaven shall
[1:37:58] pass away with a great noise and the
[1:38:00] elements shall melt with fervent heat
[1:38:03] the earth also and the work that therein
[1:38:05] shall be burned up
[1:38:06] seeing then that all these things shall
[1:38:09] be dissolved what manner of persons
[1:38:12] ought we to be ought ye to be am i to be
[1:38:16] in all holy conversation and godliness
[1:38:20] looking for and hasting unto the coming
[1:38:22] of the day of god wherein the heavens
[1:38:24] being on fire shall be dissolved and the
[1:38:26] element shall melt with fervent heat
[1:38:30] i believe that this message this morning
[1:38:32] is a final warning to those who will
[1:38:34] hear it
[1:38:37] no excuse today
[1:38:44] do not cross
[1:38:47] the line
[1:38:49] i don't know how many quotes i could get
[1:38:50] to but just let me see very quickly i
[1:38:52] want to read something here i'll have to
[1:38:53] skip most of it
[1:39:01] friends the key is get far away from
[1:39:03] that line as possible
[1:39:06] because when you're on that edge
[1:39:08] you want to hear people on the edge
[1:39:09] hearing all these voices on the other
[1:39:11] side you know you want to hear the
[1:39:12] worldly music you want to look at the
[1:39:14] world he's tired and he fashioned you
[1:39:16] you're being you're on the edge you
[1:39:17] don't want to miss anything
[1:39:19] think of and have preachers before
[1:39:21] remember lot's wife
[1:39:23] had the opportunity to leave the
[1:39:26] opportunity judgment started with a
[1:39:28] punch and her heart was so embedded
[1:39:32] there that she couldn't resist to look
[1:39:34] back
[1:39:38] god knew what was in our heart you know
[1:39:42] and he still gave her the opportunity to
[1:39:43] escape
[1:39:45] it is not that god did not know what is
[1:39:46] in our heart because we know the bible
[1:39:48] that he knows what's in our hearts
[1:39:51] and he's still because of righteous lot
[1:39:55] because of the head of his home because
[1:39:57] the head of that home
[1:39:59] extended the blessing and relationship
[1:40:01] with lotte his wife
[1:40:03] but her heart gave her away
[1:40:05] oh god help us
[1:40:07] to not live on the edge
[1:40:11] trying to be in church and still get
[1:40:14] pieces of the world
[1:40:15] let us go beyond the basic things
[1:40:17] friends how we dress how we move the
[1:40:20] music we listen to the conversations we
[1:40:22] have
[1:40:24] we have come too far to be still playing
[1:40:26] those games i understand somebody now
[1:40:28] come but some of us young people some of
[1:40:31] us caleb's
[1:40:32] 5 10 15 20 25 years
[1:40:36] and it's still struggling for the basic
[1:40:38] things
[1:40:44] but i'm in the messenger token
[1:40:46] says you see that's borderline believers
[1:40:48] that's on the edge right borderline
[1:40:50] they come through these different
[1:40:52] elements and true church and joining
[1:40:54] church and baptism unfolds but when it
[1:40:55] comes right up to crossing to get the
[1:40:57] token
[1:41:02] the closer you're on the edge your car
[1:41:04] you the token is is fully in on this
[1:41:06] side of the campaign
[1:41:08] when you're moving to the edge
[1:41:09] go when you cross you're now your car
[1:41:11] your car get no seat no more redemption
[1:41:14] you need to come back from that edge and
[1:41:16] get into the holy ghost you know
[1:41:21] i challenge you church cut off those
[1:41:24] worldly connections
[1:41:26] that are pulling you to that side that's
[1:41:27] their only purpose
[1:41:29] is to steal your soul the devil will
[1:41:31] come in and show you his face but he's
[1:41:33] sending all kinds of distractions using
[1:41:35] that kind of technology to pull you and
[1:41:37] every day you're weaker until you can't
[1:41:39] find yourself i i don't know what's
[1:41:41] going on it's so much years but you are
[1:41:44] nowhere near ready because you're living
[1:41:46] on the edge
[1:41:49] it's a warning
[1:41:50] [Music]
[1:41:52] final warning church
[1:41:54] i'm trying to close out
[1:41:58] oh my
[1:42:01] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:42:03] hallelujah
[1:42:05] young people listen jairus one time had
[1:42:07] a little daughter that was dying but he
[1:42:09] was a borderline believer
[1:42:11] he believed jesus but was afraid to
[1:42:13] confess it
[1:42:15] so whatever someone certainly described
[1:42:17] borderline
[1:42:19] and young people i don't know i don't
[1:42:20] know what it is i don't understand it
[1:42:22] brother stephen
[1:42:24] they will put up whatsapp stuff to start
[1:42:26] us facebook starters instagram set up
[1:42:28] doing nonsense
[1:42:34] and the scary thing is if you're willing
[1:42:36] to put it into the public domain what
[1:42:38] would you do that god will see that we
[1:42:39] cannot see
[1:42:42] and it makes you wonder if they
[1:42:44] understand that hell is on the earth
[1:42:46] and the lid of hell is uncovered and
[1:42:48] their streams of demon powers dispatched
[1:42:54] and we are fighting a war this morning
[1:42:56] to pull it from the clutches of the
[1:42:58] devil and to pull you from the edge back
[1:43:00] into safety
[1:43:07] i hope this helped somebody this morning
[1:43:11] listen to the prophet in the message
[1:43:12] perseverance there's always borderline
[1:43:14] believers i call them
[1:43:16] people that will come to church they'll
[1:43:19] enjoy a message maybe from the choir or
[1:43:22] from the singers or from the minister or
[1:43:24] testimony they'll enjoy it
[1:43:26] but to come in and be a part of it
[1:43:29] to participate in it they won't do it
[1:43:32] they like to listen but they won't be
[1:43:34] part of it they do not want to be
[1:43:35] identified with them
[1:43:37] so because of that on the street they
[1:43:39] dress on the edge but equally so you
[1:43:42] can't be sure that they are christian
[1:43:45] they live they use words and their
[1:43:46] language and their conduct is like the
[1:43:48] ed because they don't want to be
[1:43:49] identified with them holy rollers
[1:43:52] they don't remember but you're a church
[1:43:54] girl or church boy god help me i'll tell
[1:43:56] you at the beginning of service
[1:43:58] helena
[1:43:59] aye cutter for the tribulation call me a
[1:44:01] church boy i church mouse at church
[1:44:03] whatever
[1:44:06] anybody with me this morning
[1:44:10] listen to the prophet in the message
[1:44:12] which is this one
[1:44:14] don't you borderline with god don't you
[1:44:17] just be a good man or a good woman
[1:44:19] you'll be filled with the holy ghost
[1:44:22] baptized into the body by the holy ghost
[1:44:25] don't take no hearsay nothing about it
[1:44:29] stay there until you're dead and your
[1:44:31] life is new in christ and your whole
[1:44:34] life is changed
[1:44:36] don't just take an emotion a sensation
[1:44:39] don't do that stay there until something
[1:44:43] actually happens that changes you
[1:44:46] completely this is not a statement it's
[1:44:49] not a profession it's not a declaration
[1:44:52] it's a complete transformation
[1:44:58] i'm trying to close out
[1:45:01] i hope you get this
[1:45:02] set of semantics and words and
[1:45:07] missing this thing
[1:45:10] and people think they're comfortable and
[1:45:11] they're on the edge
[1:45:12] not realizing that with one slip
[1:45:15] because stuff happens in life
[1:45:17] when you live on the edge if you slip
[1:45:19] your fall on your car get back
[1:45:22] i always see the people doing rock
[1:45:24] climbing and thing i can't do that
[1:45:27] one mistake berliner you're going
[1:45:29] falling why would i even do that
[1:45:31] but people like that trill you see this
[1:45:33] thing there's no trouble in living on
[1:45:34] the air you know
[1:45:36] young people there's no trill enlisted
[1:45:38] in the world in music
[1:45:43] and for some it's not well it's not
[1:45:44] really really really you know so
[1:45:47] that version the version one version two
[1:45:48] it have really really worthy and really
[1:45:50] worthy and worthy and not solid and
[1:45:52] slightly
[1:45:57] do you know that satan is a talented
[1:45:59] musician
[1:46:05] and he slips thing into music that
[1:46:07] changes your mood they have trees back
[1:46:10] people who went and do shootings and
[1:46:12] stuff to the kind of music they were
[1:46:14] listening to
[1:46:16] why is there such a relationship between
[1:46:18] music and certain types of music and
[1:46:20] certain types of activities not just
[1:46:21] internet around the world
[1:46:24] because there's a high desert there's a
[1:46:26] connection that come with the music that
[1:46:28] gets you ready to go and shoot and kill
[1:46:29] and do this because that's in the music
[1:46:34] and people feel themselves on that
[1:46:36] before because they could do certain
[1:46:37] things
[1:46:39] what are you feeding yourself on to be
[1:46:40] in the spirit to be holy to be eternal
[1:46:44] i find that music too slow i finished
[1:46:46] just another needle
[1:46:50] and you don't even realize and we said
[1:46:52] it before when you listen to some of the
[1:46:54] gospel music now you're you want to know
[1:46:55] if it's really gospel music
[1:46:57] because the spirit of the world finding
[1:46:59] ways and before you know it the beat is
[1:47:02] the exact same thing as your world so
[1:47:03] you don't know when at what point the
[1:47:05] lyrics change
[1:47:07] and you march into a beat that he never
[1:47:09] write the script
[1:47:15] the beat is the same so you can't tell
[1:47:17] the difference you don't know if from a
[1:47:19] distance if you hear the only words
[1:47:20] clearly you don't know what you're
[1:47:21] listening to and what you're dancing to
[1:47:23] and what it puts you into
[1:47:25] bring back the old-fashioned way it
[1:47:28] sounds crazy but that's what we need
[1:47:31] i'm trying to finish here
[1:47:35] i'll just close out with this you have
[1:47:36] come too far now to backslide
[1:47:39] come back from the edge you have come
[1:47:41] too far to give up you have come too far
[1:47:43] to quit
[1:47:49] when you're on the edge you hear too
[1:47:50] much voices from the other side
[1:47:53] come back into safety

[2:09:28] you know wherever his spirit might find
[2:09:29] you you just find a way to shut in god
[2:09:33] let him speak to you and really
[2:09:35] zone in and zoom in on what god has for
[2:09:37] you sometimes praise god uh it just
[2:09:40] takes
[2:09:41] just getting away from all the
[2:09:42] distractions to really hear god speak to
[2:09:44] us and so we want to do that
[2:09:46] as much as possible so wednesday night

[2:09:51] service will be service will be streamed

[2:10:11] prisoner
[2:10:12] uh maintenance team group four
[2:10:14] please meet with brother marlon
[2:10:16] alexander after the service okay so
[2:10:18] maintenance team group four you just
[2:10:20] meet with brother marlon he's here uh
[2:10:22] and you
[2:10:23] you'll have your assignments for clean
[2:10:25] up
[2:10:26] and of course we invite anybody else who
[2:10:28] willing to help and participate that's
[2:10:30] fine we certainly appreciate and thank
[2:10:32] you for that
[2:10:33] uh next week will be group six
[2:10:36] led by brother adrian joseph's group
[2:10:38] okay so just posting you to the future
[2:10:42] just a reminder also um i don't know but
[2:10:45] over i think about overdone mentioning
[2:10:47] this uh a prayer service also
[2:10:49] that uh
[2:10:50] of a ministry of prayer
[2:10:52] and uh
[2:10:53] we want to as much as possible keep just
[2:10:56] like a one hour
[2:10:58] of prayer minimum every day
[2:11:00] uh so just a reminder to you
[2:11:02] that uh every day you would want to try
[2:11:04] to make at least one hour of pray and it
[2:11:06] doesn't have to be one straight hour you
[2:11:08] can break it up however you want 15
[2:11:10] minutes segments or half an hour
[2:11:12] whatever but
[2:11:13] you know it'll be effective to you and i
[2:11:14] think it's such a wonderful thing
[2:11:16] because you know you're striving
[2:11:17] throughout the day and you know you have
[2:11:18] different things happening and we know
[2:11:20] that but we take every opportunity to
[2:11:22] pray
[2:11:22] you know and um and and you know
[2:11:24] sometimes maybe let's face it maybe you
[2:11:26] may not make the whole hour maybe you
[2:11:28] press and you make 50 minutes and that
[2:11:30] is still a victory in itself
[2:11:32] because you would have spent the day
[2:11:34] continually in prayer praying always in
[2:11:37] the spirit
[2:11:38] as the bible encourages us to do amen
[2:11:41] these are the things praise god that
[2:11:43] what another ephesians is all about
[2:11:45] practicing the presence of god so you
[2:11:48] continue to do that and
[2:11:50] try to aim for an hour at least every
[2:11:51] day
[2:11:52] to talk to god
[2:11:54] anything that's on your mind just let
[2:11:56] him know if it's a burden you want
[2:11:57] lifted a prayer deliverance or maybe you
[2:12:00] just want to praise him and thank him
[2:12:01] for what he's done
[2:12:02] feel free to do that anytime you want
[2:12:04] praise god whether you're washing the
[2:12:06] dishes you're ironing your clothes or
[2:12:08] washing the car give god praise
[2:12:11] every day
[2:12:12] amen so god bless you as we leave those
[2:12:14] in your announcements
[2:12:16] amen and uh joshua's come leave me lord
[2:12:19] i'll follow
[2:12:20] lead me lord i'll go
[2:12:21] may god go with you today and bless you
[2:12:24] amen
