[7:12] First Epistle of Peter chapter 2 and
[7:15] want to read from three to eight
[7:27] and it says if so be have tasted that
[7:30] the Lord is gracious to whom coming as a
[7:34] living stone disallowed indeed of men
[7:37] but chosen of God and precious ye also
[7:42] as lively stones are built up a
[7:44] spiritual house an holy priesthood to
[7:47] offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable
[7:51] to God by Jesus Christ wherefore also it
[7:55] is contained in a scripture behold I lay
[7:59] in Zion a chief Cornerstone elect
[8:03] precious and he that believeth on him
[8:06] shall not be confounded unto you
[8:09] therefore which believe he is precious
[8:12] but under them which be disobedient the
[8:15] stone which the builders disallowed the
[8:18] same is made ahead of the corner and a
[8:22] stone of stumbling and a rock of offence
[8:25] even to them which stumble at the word
[8:28] being disobedient whereon to also they
[8:32] will appoint it and got a blessing
[8:34] amen amen praise Lord hallelujah glory
[8:38] to God let us bow our heads on a prayer
[8:41] Almighty God Father we are gathered in
[8:45] your name
[8:46] to worship in the beauty of holiness
[8:49] all yeah depending upon your tonight to
[8:53] walk all the pages of the Bible and the
[8:55] come and speak lip dear to us
[8:57] what may take note of the we take most
[9:00] of the five senses out of the humanistic
[9:02] Lord there a mine of Christ robbed on
[9:05] the right thing be said in the right can
[9:08] be done that we could - in your
[9:09] blessings Lord caught me anoint
[9:11] believers knowing their feet to believe
[9:14] and they will see themselves in the
[9:16] world and see you promise we make
[9:18] manifest unto them love me a common
[9:20] filled with the Holy Ghost come and see
[9:23] come on he come and deliver come only
[9:25] five incher and why acid tonight in the
[9:28] precious name of Jesus Christ amen
[9:30] may obvious eats well I want to conclude
[9:34] from Sunday Sunday I didn't finish
[9:36] because time was against me so I'm with
[9:41] the same taught the stone that the
[9:44] builders disallowed don't look at me
[9:48] look to the wood because God is making
[9:55] love this bright the prophet said is
[9:59] tell Allah the love secrets and the
[10:03] things he has to get applause after
[10:06] himself before she leaves here
[10:10] so the word is becoming so simple that
[10:14] you could recognize decrease of God
[10:17] towards your life and the love of God
[10:20] towards you now this stone that we're
[10:23] speaking about this rejected stone had
[10:27] been prophesied way back in the Old
[10:30] Testament before the temple was built
[10:34] David as a prophet and Sam's 1:18
[10:41] identify the stone that the builders
[10:44] refused is become the headstone of the
[10:47] corner Solomon temple was not built but
[10:52] David in the spirit he had a revelation
[10:56] of this rejected stone and all through
[11:01] the Old Testament and the new Christ is
[11:06] that rejected stone
[11:10] and in this last day crisis comte's body
[11:15] and has been rejected
[11:20] the Prophet said that the Church of God
[11:23] is built upon the revelation of Jesus
[11:26] Christ then he went further the Sarah
[11:30] Church of what is built upon the
[11:33] revelation of the word of God in its
[11:36] season the career deeper because Jesus
[11:42] Christ is the word of God but the word
[11:47] of God comes in season so God is giving
[11:52] out a special menu this season you have
[11:56] to hook up with this menu you have to
[11:59] eat from this menu to be in the Church
[12:04] of God
[12:05] so the Prophet identified the life that
[12:11] was in justification when on to make
[12:15] sanctification the life of us in
[12:18] sanctification went on to make the
[12:21] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the life
[12:24] in the Pentecostals went on to make the
[12:30] seed would to bring forth Christ
[12:35] the life passed through the stages so to
[12:41] be in the Church of God
[12:43] in the days of Wesley you had to be
[12:47] sanctified to be in the body you had to
[12:52] have a revelation of sanctification that
[12:56] would be your confession in the days of
[13:01] the Pentecostals you have to receive the
[13:04] holy spirit of promise for that day to
[13:07] be in the body but the prophet common
[13:12] revealed the fullness of the Holy Spirit
[13:16] the life that passed to the seven
[13:19] churches because when the body of the
[13:23] bride of Jesus Christ has been built
[13:26] through the seven church edges from
[13:29] Ephesus to audition no light never shone
[13:34] on that building
[13:37] nobody had a crew got a sapling when
[13:41] John when the seals was open the Prophet
[13:45] said John so what God was sending for
[13:49] the church for time he strike in symbol
[13:54] form all he saw was an antichrist spirit
[13:57] readin he never saw the life that was
[14:03] combating the Antichrist spirit he never
[14:07] saw the tunnels that was shaking the
[14:11] devil in every age so he saw a white
[14:16] horse he saw a red horse a black horse
[14:19] and a pillow before living creatures
[14:24] they were guarding the blade
[14:27] in every age they were guarding the
[14:31] pride of Jesus Christ but Panem said
[14:33] this is Jesus Christ in bright form so
[14:39] when John saw him walking through the
[14:41] seven golden candlesticks
[14:43] instead he saw one like unto the Son of
[14:47] Man and brother branham said that was
[14:50] Jesus Christ in platform because Christ
[14:55] is the mystery of God revealed and the
[14:59] bride is the mystery of Christ's real
[15:02] so Christ is revealing his wife he's
[15:07] revealing his bride because Adam had
[15:10] Eve's locked up in him and Christ had
[15:14] the bride locked up in him so God put
[15:18] Adam to sleep and took out a ribbon and
[15:20] bring the feminine love spirit out of
[15:23] Adam and put it in that body and that
[15:25] was Eve and she fell God but Jesus
[15:29] asleep on the cross and water blood and
[15:34] spirit came on from his side those were
[15:36] the elements to make up the bride to the
[15:39] seventh which itches but nobody knew
[15:41] about it
[15:45] nobody knew about it but the seventh
[15:47] angel he was commissioned to reveal the
[15:52] mystery of God and to reveal all the
[15:56] mystery of God for the eruption of the
[15:58] church so when God given the revelation
[16:04] of the seven angels coming from eternity
[16:12] but a Branham recognized it was the
[16:15] coming of Christ
[16:18] he said the angel with the cut back
[16:21] wings is Christ the covenant angel the
[16:26] one hole in this different seal and he
[16:29] said he couple of the three full
[16:31] revelation of a short of voice the truth
[16:36] and he unfold the mystery of the shout
[16:42] only coming down to the end of his
[16:45] ministry so the people that were a world
[16:48] where abandon did not have a revelation
[16:50] of the Son of Man the new brother
[16:54] branham was a prophet but they did not
[16:58] have the revelation of the son of man
[17:01] that was revealed to them it was a son
[17:06] of man within public dissing of man and
[17:09] it didn't have that revelation that
[17:13] referee was will reveal only to his
[17:16] bride he said only the elected going to
[17:20] see that
[17:22] so what elected you in this generation
[17:27] to see this mystery because you as
[17:30] lively stones are built up a spiritual
[17:35] house for the habitation of the spirit
[17:39] not dead stones lively stones and we
[17:44] have to fit around a headstone so watch
[17:49] when Berta Brennan spoke in since is
[17:54] this the time they identified that
[17:57] message as seven thunders
[18:03] in court and simplicity in Albuquerque
[18:06] New Mexico he said you have heard my
[18:08] message the seven thunders says is this
[18:15] so he labeled that message seven
[18:19] thunders it was in that message the Lord
[18:25] spoke double poolman tell him go and
[18:28] start the church on the 6th of January
[18:33] 1963 that pastors preach on the 30th of
[18:39] December 1962
[18:44] but a Branham preach a message call a
[18:48] greater than Solomon is here and he was
[18:53] letting the people see the gift that
[18:58] word least in Solomon all of Israel
[19:02] gathered around that gift and they were
[19:05] blessed the nation was addressed and the
[19:09] world was blessed and the Queen of Sheba
[19:11] went to City gift
[19:13] and he was saying that God has sent the
[19:16] Holy Ghost in this generation he was
[19:21] showing them that that same gift which
[19:25] is greater not quest Christ in the
[19:27] headstone is now filled in him
[19:30] performing the same wood and did not
[19:32] gathering around it and he said in Asia
[19:35] a check was difficult to be judged in
[19:37] that message he said for years we have
[19:41] had the Word of God but now we have the
[19:46] god of the world in our midst
[19:53] he identified God himself
[19:57] it snow in the midst of the people but
[20:02] it wasn't seen it because there wasn't
[20:05] or didn't to see it because on the 7c
[20:08] morning he tell em you're not getting it
[20:10] you're not supposed to get it and the
[20:16] builders rejected so listen he preached
[20:22] a message called the way of a true
[20:25] prophet in that message he identified
[20:30] the Prophet Amos
[20:35] coming down to Samaria and he said let
[20:40] us suppose Amos will come here no today
[20:43] what will he see and he blasts all the
[20:47] Pentecostals he said the same God you
[20:50] claimed yes it was good to destroy you
[20:52] in that message he identify he has a
[20:56] message to preach to the ministers you
[20:59] gotta gotta be ministers to preach this
[21:00] message so when he preached the message
[21:04] indictment that message was not for just
[21:07] believers that message was specifically
[21:11] for ministers he said he will send and
[21:14] notify the ministers during that message
[21:17] was a whole lot of Ministers was
[21:20] gathered together for that message but
[21:24] it is God in the prophet knew the
[21:28] spirits that was operating the ban on
[21:30] tominaga
[21:32] so the Prophet sin and informative pull
[21:36] maneuver the hunt he's going to ordain
[21:39] them in that meeting at the come for
[21:43] ordination
[21:45] so they came the Jeffersonville for
[21:49] ordination all the ministers are
[21:54] gathered for indictment and they are
[21:57] gathered for ordination so when they
[22:00] came procurement tools and fellow
[22:03] ministers how the Prophet is going to
[22:06] ordain him they laugh they make fun out
[22:11] of it
[22:11] be perfect with all the already
[22:13] profitable for the no ministers for the
[22:15] longest wine
[22:17] but here is two colored men same chord
[22:20] is greater all T in them so but a parent
[22:24] comes the pulpit he never informed his
[22:27] elders and his associate ministers in
[22:30] the tabernacle that his greet or D in
[22:33] these two colored men because he knew
[22:35] the spirits that was operating in the
[22:39] church so he come to the tabernacle they
[22:43] talk about you sister happy right but
[22:45] I'm the sister that the second she going
[22:48] through menopause and who said - can you
[22:49] talk about the minister's welcome miss
[22:51] and many say he have two colored patron
[22:54] from New York City Tour de trop de palma
[22:58] each of the prominence of boom and then
[23:01] Paul for his angry son he had a lot of
[23:07] hobbies sweetie call
[23:09] and he call his ministry associate
[23:13] ministers LS the commonly hands upon
[23:16] them and two ministers were water within
[23:20] the car back
[23:22] because what abandom never ordained no
[23:25] colored ministers
[23:27] and the spirit upon these people if you
[23:32] let move her in front like we open a
[23:35] potential thing so here is here what
[23:38] discipline but a balance said he's
[23:42] ordained in these men and sent him forth
[23:44] so you're deemed but a pool man never a
[23:47] hunt
[23:48] then he preached the message indictment
[23:51] in the message except I am entitled all
[23:55] these ordained ministers for crucified
[24:01] the Lord Jesus Christ a second I am one
[24:06] minister said who is he speaking to
[24:08] other man say us us so he went and week
[24:14] all the ministers hide because they all
[24:18] had rejected the spoon of power the
[24:23] serpent under revelation this was in
[24:25] July
[24:27] the service just opening match because
[24:31] they reject what what's in he indict
[24:36] them but he sent out but a poor man
[24:39] about a haunted see we said them because
[24:40] they Anson to decry you see me a mesh be
[24:43] fruitful I may go attend to the foreign
[24:45] field and across the will listen at the
[24:52] end of that message
[24:54] he was pretty and he said lord I have I
[24:57] have invited all my fellow servants
[25:04] he identified what it did because they
[25:08] crucified you would he said where did
[25:10] they crucify we're getting more Spears
[25:12] from this one behind the pulpit behind
[25:16] the pulpit he blasts all the fun
[25:19] denominational system but he passed
[25:21] administers that was around him because
[25:24] they wasn't following in line with what
[25:29] was taking place so when the seventh
[25:33] under revelation came forth it was a war
[25:41] a spiritual disturbance as spiritual the
[25:48] statement was false but it always
[25:50] happens that way because it's rejected
[25:54] tool when God said the open door and a
[25:59] Philadelphian age and the people came
[26:03] out Azusa Street all these secular
[26:05] churches came together and held a
[26:09] meeting to try to cut it off oh no and I
[26:12] start having Street meetings to prevent
[26:14] their people from going to Azusa Street
[26:17] but what was anointed people to live all
[26:20] part of the states and traveled Azusa
[26:22] Street to receive the apportion these
[26:26] people were sanctified God was selling
[26:30] the Baptist money hooli goes upon a
[26:32] sanctified life not upon planted word
[26:38] was a sanctified life
[26:41] so people explained by trade and it was
[26:43] so sanctified that sometimes asked a
[26:46] step of the treat on the platform
[26:48] because equality of course committed
[26:50] four city blocks away
[26:52] this is just four eleven repower good
[26:55] you're not the wisdom up and ceremony we
[26:58] walk in to go to Azusa Street because
[27:00] they were so sanctified and sanctified
[27:05] life always attracts the Holy Ghost so
[27:10] you as an individual have to be in a
[27:13] sanctified condition you must come in
[27:15] here on a sanctified condition to
[27:18] attract the Holy Ghost the common
[27:20] baptized you cannot become in here any
[27:22] all how in the house of God you have to
[27:26] come under expectation with your life
[27:28] right a sanctified life to attract God
[27:34] Holy Spirit the baptized because you
[27:37] must receive the baptism of the Holy
[27:39] Ghost this is what the builders refused
[27:43] this is what they build us in the
[27:46] message of all refused because for the
[27:50] Branum identified the messages are super
[27:52] sign that God is going to send the
[27:56] baptism of the Holy Ghost outside of the
[27:59] denominational churches and when the
[28:02] Alexus unwanted are going to be a
[28:04] super-sized
[28:06] and you did that in 83 and the whole
[28:10] message will reject it they say they're
[28:14] going back to Pentecost
[28:17] you see if people only grown the
[28:20] grammatical of Pentecost and try it out
[28:22] here
[28:22] the administer them said what is this
[28:24] persisters for Negro not to put on
[28:26] them this elk hunting they were after
[28:28] Pentecost we have the world but whatever
[28:32] Bannon says they recheck the acts 2:38
[28:37] screaming Halloween young ones the only
[28:39] type the word going to bring forth it
[28:42] happens what nothing else these are
[28:45] birds is a mess we're in a pigpen
[28:48] whopping decorators hospital it is a
[28:51] mess and you must be born again by the
[28:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire
[29:04] listen prapannam said the messenger of
[29:08] malachi fo and revelation 10 7 is to do
[29:13] two things I want us tonight to analyze
[29:19] he holds admit he make impacts you're
[29:22] going to see awkward hide here
[29:24] officially seven thunders right here he
[29:28] say the messenger of Malachi 4 attend
[29:31] several two things right in that
[29:33] statement he is identifying that Malachi
[29:38] 4 verse intent 7 is the same person and
[29:43] his routing is a 1 according to Malachi
[29:47] 4 he will turn the hearts of the
[29:50] children back to the feet of the fathers
[29:54] and reveal the seven thunders of
[29:57] Revelation 10 92 things and anyone to
[30:07] see he's dull describing what is
[30:12] antennas are he says in Revelations
[30:17] contained in the seven seas
[30:22] so in revealing the seven thunders of
[30:26] Russia in Tennessee they are the
[30:28] revelations contained in these seven
[30:31] seals she cannot leave the series can't
[30:35] leave the world and one that says these
[30:39] divinely revealed basic truths but that
[30:43] surely turned the hats returned back to
[30:45] the faith three fathers
[30:47] JJ , analyze the whole sentence be
[30:52] messenger of Malachi for understand
[30:55] servants do one thing one thing reveal
[31:00] the seven thunders of Elisha 10 because
[31:06] once he revealed the 700 revelation 10
[31:09] is this revelation with the Teri Hatcher
[31:12] and back to the faith of the others so
[31:15] it's not that cool things is supposed to
[31:17] do is wanting reveal the revelation of
[31:20] the seven thunders which are the
[31:22] revelations contained in the seven seals
[31:26] right there he hid the mystery of the
[31:32] seven voices of these seven Church ages
[31:37] in simplicity they couldn't see it
[31:43] because it was so simple
[31:45] God hiding in simplicity and revealing
[31:49] himself in the same listen other
[31:55] experience 2009 in 2009 14 of us went to
[32:01] Jeffersonville we visited the butter
[32:05] problems tomb there's a big pyramid deal
[32:08] on the tomb and there are the seven
[32:10] churches there's this Commission a hula
[32:13] things written on different sides a -
[32:15] after we came back we went to a Chinese
[32:18] restaurant to eat buffet style so I was
[32:25] my first master cleaning so I went to
[32:27] collect my food and sat down there next
[32:28] to my wife Timmy cleared me both rivers
[32:31] Community Giving last they went to not
[32:33] separate people when Tim is Waldoboro
[32:37] sanitary went to them so the brothers
[32:39] are fellowshiping on the table and one
[32:43] brother make a statement about the fact
[32:46] that the seven virtues is not written on
[32:50] the tombstone of the Prophet
[32:53] when he made that statement I said in my
[32:58] heart I don't agree with that he should
[33:04] not have said that
[33:04] and God was pleased with what I said and
[33:10] the Holy Spirit started speaking to me
[33:14] so I just bend my head off my plate my
[33:18] knife and I'm listening to a still small
[33:21] voice speaking to me hear what the Lord
[33:24] said he said brother Branham placed
[33:28] before choose in the pyramid
[33:32] not on the pyramid it is the mystery of
[33:36] the life that was sealed in the seven
[33:41] church ages this is the mystery the poor
[33:46] abandoned took his grave and to this day
[33:49] it remains a secret he said this is the
[33:53] secret the periban took to his grave and
[33:56] to this day it remains a secret that was
[34:00] thus saith the Lord
[34:03] the secret was the life of these seven
[34:08] virtues that was inside the pyramid not
[34:13] on the pyramid so any better sort of
[34:16] tools which was written on the pyramid
[34:18] he made a statement I shall never meet
[34:22] so hold hidden the life of Christ in the
[34:30] pyramid that is why the Prophet said it
[34:35] is the guides duty to lead us from poor
[34:38] formalities and things into the glorious
[34:42] wonderful baptism of the Holy Ghost
[34:45] where there is virtue didn't see fit you
[34:49] see where there is virtue knowledge
[34:50] temporary writer and the Holy Ghost
[34:52] itself because the Holy Ghost comes the
[34:55] seal your feet at the bottom of the
[34:57] pyramid
[35:00] faith is the seed that God needs you so
[35:07] listen at one time but a Branham was
[35:11] walking in the stature of a perfect man
[35:16] but it did not have Pirelli kindness
[35:21] he was in godliness he was here in
[35:25] asleep like wood and doing things like
[35:28] God but he didn't have but early
[35:31] kindness he went into a restaurant and
[35:36] he saw a lady in a short pass with a
[35:41] toenail paint up with two men and
[35:43] fainting and decided say lower wider
[35:44] wipe this off the face of youth is
[35:46] decided to go up in inventing and a hand
[35:49] touch him an eternal and cried me back
[35:52] and watch through him his sins going up
[35:56] and Jesus right pardon potentia forget
[36:01] entreat guidance Baptist and I forgive
[36:03] you what you condemned in the lady so
[36:06] dear he got a revelation of the Father's
[36:09] kindness the quality burley kindness is
[36:12] not really your kindness honour is the
[36:14] father's - being expressed through you
[36:22] so you had a revelation of the Father's
[36:26] kindness now we had to quote out a testy
[36:29] revolution so he tell him a trap is set
[36:33] for you and he sent two people to church
[36:37] to make love and butter Panama's on the
[36:42] pulpit sweatin and his preaching I said
[36:46] don't do that he say call upon
[36:47] indifferent he said this is also calling
[36:50] the Lord tell him there in your hands
[36:54] whatever you see that is it if they say
[36:59] that if we say buying divine whatever
[37:05] you say
[37:07] God is testing this revelation of the
[37:10] Father's Agnes call is tested his
[37:16] revelation of bronchitis because were to
[37:19] come with charity the person of Christ
[37:21] is what coming next so he said I forgive
[37:27] you we say God was pleased he said dear
[37:30] acting so the power God came down upon
[37:33] them and conviction and repentance
[37:36] because he spoke the rantings I forgive
[37:40] you
[37:43] so now he is standing on the seventh
[37:45] step you call for a balancer when they
[37:48] reach up there the chance of comes out
[37:51] to challenge the comma to command the
[37:54] presence of the king
[37:58] so we have to give all diligence to at
[38:02] our feet virtue and knowledge temperance
[38:06] and patience and godliness all these
[38:08] things have to be in us that will be
[38:11] sealed with charity so this stone that
[38:20] the builders rejected is the same stone
[38:24] is this same story with the seven
[38:28] virtues because when Burakumin
[38:31] identified the seven thunders are the
[38:33] seven voices of the seven church ages
[38:37] which are seven manifestations of God
[38:41] holy spirit into the church as faith and
[38:45] the voice hood when the voice he
[38:47] identifies how the spirit was operating
[38:51] in the church as it was a life that was
[38:55] thundering and they rejected the
[39:00] builders rejected but they could only be
[39:03] in the church as a member of the body by
[39:11] the revelation the Word of God in its
[39:14] season
[39:20] so but abiram identified in since the
[39:25] time he said the seven seals are the set
[39:30] of the manifestations of the seven
[39:34] angels of the seven churches
[39:42] the life that was manifested it's no
[39:48] guard up in the southern man hear what
[39:53] he said I am the happiest man in the
[39:55] world for God to show me this that
[39:59] deceived went to the processes and come
[40:02] back to seed again so on the top by the
[40:06] pyramid of loud Isha Hezbollah Pan Am
[40:10] standing on the top of the pyramid with
[40:14] the seed would Christ veiled in him the
[40:19] life path to the stitches and is now
[40:23] fill in the man
[40:25] he says so hard you to get it separated
[40:30] it's not his son of man himself but this
[40:33] is Son of Man reveals buddy Solomon
[40:36] because the work is all fear in his
[40:39] flesh
[40:41] he said there was fine and fault
[40:44] with the man who was the woman who
[40:46] subscribes he's not a fine and fault
[40:49] with the word working truth man the
[40:56] people didn't recognize the headship to
[41:01] the body but abandon preach a message
[41:04] Christ the mystery of God revealed
[41:09] in that message we identify the headship
[41:16] which describes himself is know at the
[41:20] head of the body detergent they identify
[41:27] all the mysteries from FSS tell Alicia
[41:31] is no car up in the Sun among all the
[41:36] mischievous card up in him so what was
[41:39] happening the seven thunders was wrapped
[41:42] up in the Prophet as a seed
[41:49] so you had to get the seed of seven
[41:53] thunders in you to be in the Church of
[42:01] God in its season because the seven
[42:08] thunders is Jesus Christ when God came
[42:14] down among Sinai teacher of Israel there
[42:18] was thunder lightning and voices each
[42:21] other says totally both speak lest we
[42:23] die the shaking the boots yet they
[42:26] mounted on fire and got thundering go
[42:31] tell Moses the people have rightly
[42:34] spoken he no longer speak to them like
[42:37] that
[42:38] so what God did he happy thunders in a
[42:41] still small voice the heavy thunders in
[42:45] the prophets and brother branham
[42:49] speaking about it he said when the truth
[42:51] anointed of God speak it is the voice of
[42:55] God to reject it is remove the
[42:58] candlestick so these seven stars was the
[43:02] voice of God when Jesus aquiline said to
[43:06] the edge of sadhas here he said unto the
[43:09] Angel of the Church of Sardis write
[43:12] these things saith he and have these
[43:16] seven spirits of God and whole the seven
[43:19] stars
[43:21] once great going to each time because
[43:25] the star is the messenger and the Spirit
[43:29] is the Holy Ghost and mounting the
[43:31] messenger for the age to bring the word
[43:33] for the edge so that lovely voice Accord
[43:35] to the edge but I bound say I am the
[43:37] voice of God to you
[43:47] but a ballon tool is follow she wouldn't
[43:51] leave them took for good and they still
[43:53] didn't believe it when he got an accent
[43:56] they still looking for him too recently
[43:57] did we already tell them because they
[44:02] did not have a revelation Jesus own
[44:05] disciples didn't know who he was coming
[44:11] down to the end of his ministry say who
[44:12] do men say I is son of man they talk all
[44:17] what men say they're in service who do
[44:20] you say I am they did not know Peter
[44:23] received the revelation though are the
[44:25] Christ the Son of the Living God when
[44:29] Jesus died and rose from the dead
[44:32] they still like Alice in Wonderland they
[44:36] had new revelation when he success came
[44:39] and tell them that he is risen
[44:43] they say the words were like idle tears
[44:47] they couldn't believe it
[44:49] Jesus on the road to Emmaus had to
[44:53] rebuke them fools and slow of heart to
[44:55] believe all that is really possible this
[44:58] time concerning Christ these were men
[45:01] that was with Christ for three and a
[45:03] half years they fished with him eat with
[45:06] him sleep with him all about they went
[45:08] with him and is never a friend of who he
[45:11] was
[45:12] and that is the same thing that happened
[45:15] in this generation with whatever
[45:22] to prove how these people didn't know
[45:27] who he was but a banner on the THC he
[45:34] identified Chuck no Chuck boy was a
[45:37] better band from the look he saw the
[45:42] dead raised in Finland USDA he was in
[45:46] Mexico when the dad was really Korriban
[45:49] tend to put a jack you gonna pray for
[45:51] the lady she don't know you would he see
[45:55] you a lot he was D and here Bronson he
[45:59] believe I am God's prophet to the Sun he
[46:01] if you check him at the Sheep would see
[46:03] reason but I am always by Jack but
[46:05] listen
[46:06] underneath didn't see you but I wanna
[46:09] identify Jack more Knightly people's
[46:13] hairless coven he said all the right and
[46:16] said God sent us a prophet we did a
[46:18] prophet leader prophet then writing up
[46:21] people and telling gold and beg and gold
[46:24] to send them our prophet and the prophet
[46:28] present tense with them but a brand I

[46:34] whom attending and they still couldn't
[46:37] see who he was
[46:41] dinkum
[46:43] if you look about Joseph Busey he loved
[46:48] the Prophet the Prophet was put out of a
[46:52] meeting because he was going and
[46:55] preached by brother Joseph bossy
[46:57] after a forensic convention when he went
[47:01] in the stadium Courtney Lindsay and Eve
[47:03] had the big meeting and they asked him I
[47:07] go and preach about abortion he says yes

[47:12] proposal this was a cabbage and this

[47:25] producing ministers said emotion we feel
[47:28] and but our bosses didn't have a
[47:30] revelation of the baptism in jesus
[47:32] christ name for all these years but a
[47:36] brand said he was why the hardest person
[47:38] to see that and if you believe our brand
[47:43] our prophet and the prophet is the voice
[47:46] of God you just have to accept where the
[47:48] prophets
[47:49] Father Son and Holy Ghost titles to the
[47:52] name it was in either 63 or 64 but
[47:58] they're bad porno but I'll choose the
[48:00] favor abandon Isabella Joseph if

[48:05] baptized in the name of the rules or
[48:06] shine on the really valley and the
[48:08] brighter Melissa what will he do he

[48:29] as he baptized in Jesus name that was
[48:32] 564 the cattle evil evil join me parent

[48:41] back in 57 hours to them only time
[48:43] doctrine even doctor revealed he was
[48:45] only baptized and 63 in Jesus Christ
[48:48] name he was the creator of our brand
[48:51] speak about and these are men are only
[48:53] prophet only one minister hood confessed
[48:57] that he miss dishonor man
[49:02] that is what Eddie bisque
[49:05] at the bicycle testify of the kind of
[49:08] experiences he had with the Prophet
[49:12] hunting and fishing he was in the car
[49:14] when the injured came in the car all but
[49:16] I Bambi instead of Street and then the
[49:18] most commonly Road
[49:20] well I said me ok ok a moose and he
[49:22] should be moves and faintings and he
[49:24] said in a speech and you say but I miss
[49:27] this son of man and when he spoke those
[49:30] words you can see the hurt in his heart
[49:32] that he misses and he did all Canada
[49:36] profit and he missed the resolution of
[49:38] this son of man that he was with so all
[49:42] these people did not have a revelation
[49:47] of what was taking place right around
[49:53] them and as the same thing today is the
[49:58] exact same thing today he identified
[50:05] that they reject the builders we checked
[50:10] the baptism of the holy spirit today in
[50:15] this message people not looking for the
[50:18] baptism of the Holy Ghost they say they
[50:21] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost they
[50:23] say when they believe I was with a
[50:26] better talk in my actual Holy Ghost you
[50:28] see when you believe this message
[50:30] residually goes fine after I said how
[50:33] did but abandon receive the Holy Ghost
[50:35] he said brother branham received the
[50:38] Holy Ghost that we because the Word of
[50:40] God wasn't open up yet but since the
[50:45] Word of God has been open up once you
[50:47] receive the wizard you received the
[50:49] baptism of the universe and they believe
[50:52] a lie and be damned by the copper bomb
[50:56] blast that Baptist doctrine for all the
[50:59] years was a neat he blasted you
[51:02] understand since you believe not when
[51:09] you believe since you believe so you
[51:13] have to get the Holy Ghost by and
[51:17] experience
[51:18] I spoke another burden you my testimony
[51:23] he told me his mother had an experience
[51:25] like that in Canada I said what about
[51:27] you experiences I mean I have received
[51:29] the baptism without sensation but the
[51:35] banner in speaking with the mysteries
[51:38] once you have spoken at the baptism of
[51:41] the Holy Ghost without sensation but the
[51:44] person of Christ performing in you the
[51:47] same works that he did when us here
[51:51] they really should hop on chat ECU
[51:54] unison but he never had an experience a
[51:58] bribe answer must have an experience to
[52:00] have the illegals
[52:02] you must have an experience to have the
[52:06] Holy Ghost lister friends you that
[52:12] believed this revelation is a rejected
[52:15] sooner we are called to become the
[52:18] headstone so watch the common of the
[52:23] Lord is the capstone coming down so the
[52:30] pyramid at the bottom here prapannam
[52:33] identify chord as the white light and
[52:37] condescend to the earth he said the
[52:41] foolish Erie was the real Fred
[52:44] that is the long way that's healed he
[52:47] said when your red sins come under the
[52:50] red blood it comes white when the
[52:55] community red light it comes white so
[52:59] the foolish waiter hit the earth the
[53:03] real red doan feet and science and
[53:07] scientists discover that we right under
[53:11] the red yes another light infrared that
[53:18] could see to darkness
[53:21] so this real light came down in the
[53:25] earth with all the darkness of sin and
[53:28] see all the elected progresses and seeds
[53:31] and pull them out by that tree and fit
[53:35] them into that slot but a banham said
[53:39] these tools were for ordained of God the
[53:43] Phaeton each slot from Ephesus tell
[53:46] Alicia
[53:48] [Applause]
[53:51] think of it but we not initial changes
[53:56] he said the messenger comes at the end
[53:58] of the age blast the agents open another
[54:01] age but a Branham the last the audition
[54:06] is important a bright age or the age of
[54:09] adoption and it never knows nothing
[54:11] about it because it's not written and it
[54:13] was under the Seventh Seal that is in
[54:16] silence so we have been called out from
[54:25] loud isha to enter into the bride age to
[54:32] go back to god
[54:33] the white light reflected itself into
[54:38] the seven colours it got to go back to
[54:41] white light the only way it could go
[54:44] back to white light doctor pass to
[54:47] another pyramid in physics in physics
[54:55] they take a prison and take white light
[54:59] and pass it to again
[55:00] all these seven colors from a genocide
[55:01] then I take another prison the other
[55:03] side and you get all the seven colors
[55:06] pass really bring about the white light
[55:09] God is light
[55:11] and Himmler darkness what I put on the
[55:14] same principle so the life that was in
[55:17] the 70s ages was all gathered up in this
[55:20] son of man and he sodomized is so ugly
[55:23] conceded and he saw a sea containing
[55:25] seven part native Almighty God and
[55:28] sealed containing seven thunders and no
[55:31] it has to pass through another prison
[55:33] that is why the Holy Ghost lot is there
[55:37] because um above that is the white light
[55:40] the capstone of love so the bride have
[55:45] to claim the Holy Ghost slit by this
[55:49] route request you have this seventh
[55:51] under seed that was in the seventh which
[55:54] ages which is the same seven spirits of
[55:57] God have to come back no to the white
[56:00] light to hit the capstone so here are
[56:05] the Prophet says the professor after we
[56:08] have added or fearful to our knowledge
[56:11] and temples he said is this the mystery
[56:14] of the thunders that brings back the
[56:16] headstone if it is they have several
[56:21] messengers that was song is for to the
[56:24] 78 ages that they thought to bring back
[56:29] the fourth to bring behind if it is then
[56:33] the seven thunders kept the pyramid
[56:39] the seven thunders captain permit and
[56:42] the holy ghost lot and the builders and
[56:47] caretakers rejected they reject the
[56:52] headstone
[56:57] listen intrusion the professor the bride
[57:03] is an independent woman any message
[57:10] Christ is the mission of God with you
[57:13] he said the bride is an independent
[57:17] woman he says she is like this people
[57:21] build the blood he said this birdie
[57:26] kills speckled because they take the
[57:28] blood of the meat ran off the head and
[57:32] the sprinkled blood upon this building
[57:35] and the letter was justified and the
[57:39] blood was building wrong saying holy
[57:40] holy holy holy
[57:43] that's the speckled bird in the Bible
[57:45] and the song they sing they say all the
[57:50] other birds the flock is a cancer
[57:57] all the other birds are against the envy
[58:03] her fortune and fame because she been
[58:07] covered by the blood of a mate and the
[58:12] life is in the blood and the life is the
[58:16] life of Christ the life of seven lived
[58:19] voices the parcel of his need in
[58:22] jeffersonville is thousands of lives
[58:24] voices the thunder of God hundred and
[58:28] sweetness in purity and an undefined
[58:31] life that is the Thunder that shakes the
[58:35] devil the devil's don't care how magical
[58:38] shout how much a good holler but what
[58:41] hurt him is to see that life and he
[58:44] probably life back in the body is a
[58:47] vindication that the rapture is at hand
[58:50] so we got to see the life of Christ back
[58:53] in the body we gotta see signs murders
[58:56] and wonders accompanying the word in you
[58:59] to learn the life is back in the body
[59:01] because he promised to walk amongst us
[59:03] to heal the sick Teresa dared to open up
[59:06] recognize because your muscly conditions
[59:08] so called to be glorified and we magnify
[59:12] in the midst of his people so we have to
[59:15] be under such an expectation to see
[59:18] world walk in the temple suddenly
[59:23] suddenly this period of vodka just
[59:26] chopped down inside here and start the
[59:29] new things that with Marvel he will be
[59:31] mothered to see the live walk and the
[59:34] blind see court promise it and we are
[59:37] mountain it because the stone that the
[59:40] builders disallowed is become the
[59:42] headstone of the corner it is time for
[59:44] the headstone that come down in
[59:46] headstone Tabernacle you must be under
[59:48] that expectation you must be looking for
[59:51] the headstone to come and tap off the
[59:53] payment of your life this is what you
[59:57] have to be looking for to see the glory
[59:59] of God anything from you when I balance
[1:00:01] we got to bring the people in the
[1:00:03] presence of the living chord we got to
[1:00:05] have the presence of God within us where
[1:00:11] Anthony said the other night
[1:00:13] one is the maturity important one man
[1:00:17] taught is surrender to God is omnipotent
[1:00:20] God doesn't even a cold
[1:00:22] what did be holy goes to individuals
[1:00:25] you've got to recognize you got to get
[1:00:27] your individual portion you got to get
[1:00:29] your individual inheritance
[1:00:31] this is inheritance time this is time
[1:00:34] you to get your personal experience with
[1:00:37] the Holy Spirit this is time you have a
[1:00:42] positional birth into the body to be in
[1:00:45] the church triumphant to be in the
[1:00:47] serious bride he has only one way to
[1:00:50] enter in just as they did under their
[1:00:52] Pentecost but this is the headstone
[1:00:54] covered with Church of grace grace grace
[1:00:56] until is the grace of God towards us
[1:00:59] that God give us eyes to see the light
[1:01:02] of the real world and to walk in the
[1:01:04] light and to see more unfold before
