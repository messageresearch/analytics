[59:46] Theo having me to bring greetings to
[59:49] this
[59:50] convention and I believe all of us would
[59:53] like to salute but to and his team for
[59:57] having us
[1:00:01] here the government of the
[1:00:04] church the L and all the ministers that
[1:00:08] have us here it has been a rich
[1:00:15] blessing it's for the first time being
[1:00:18] here I recognize that they pull aside
[1:00:20] all the generals of the convention apart
[1:00:23] so I suppose the reason for it is to
[1:00:25] salute them
[1:00:26] for a job well
[1:00:29] done
[1:00:44] amen
[1:00:51] amen they have been a wonderful repres
[1:00:56] presentation of what God's Prophet
[1:00:58] called God's dress
[1:01:00] we amen and God's dress we will say what
[1:01:04] the prophet has already said so we
[1:01:06] really appreciate them we thank God for
[1:01:09] the blessings of the meeting I have been
[1:01:12] privileged by God's grace to be here
[1:01:14] physically for two of the services I
[1:01:17] followed the other two other three
[1:01:20] virtually the question is to ask what
[1:01:23] else can I add
[1:01:27] but I recall being a school child and we
[1:01:31] were taught repetition is the mother of
[1:01:35] learning so nothing is wrong in
[1:01:38] repeating
[1:01:40] ourselves amen there's no harm in being
[1:01:45] repetitive remember Noah's message was
[1:01:48] it's going to be it's going to rain
[1:01:50] children is going to rain they have to
[1:01:53] hear it until they receive it are to
[1:01:56] hear it until the work for them and we
[1:01:58] as a matter of fact the very message we
[1:02:01] believe in amen the very message we
[1:02:05] contend for tells us say what I
[1:02:09] say so being repetive is not wrong
[1:02:13] amen praise
[1:02:15] God
[1:02:17] Amen so the team of the meeting contend
[1:02:23] for the faith amen and Jude in his
[1:02:27] letter here addressing
[1:02:29] Christians addressing Believers
[1:02:33] addressing the
[1:02:35] Sanctified addressing those
[1:02:38] preserved addressing those called amen
[1:02:42] and just 23 years after the first church
[1:02:46] was set up he invit them that you should
[1:02:52] earnestly earnestly contend for the
[1:02:55] faith
[1:02:57] amen nowhere else in the sacred writing
[1:03:01] are we invited to contend but as brother
[1:03:05] Del shared for us last night amen
[1:03:08] hallelujah we as much as we are not to
[1:03:11] have contentions we are asked Amen to
[1:03:14] contend for defeat amen so contention is
[1:03:20] all
[1:03:21] right it's good to contend that's right
[1:03:25] if it is for the right
[1:03:27] thing Hallelujah it is good to contend
[1:03:31] we are not to contend get in the world
[1:03:34] of sin get in the world of argument get
[1:03:36] in the world of Doctrine and head
[1:03:37] knowledge and content for a kind of
[1:03:40] contention that get us angry and get all
[1:03:43] kind of spirit but we are invited to
[1:03:46] contend for the faith contend for the
[1:03:51] writing and not just content but to
[1:03:56] earnestly
[1:03:57] contend
[1:03:59] earnestly earnestly contend what it is
[1:04:03] to contend it mean to
[1:04:05] debate it mean to hold fast hold fast to
[1:04:09] your
[1:04:10] conviction earnestly content earnestly
[1:04:14] content mean that what we hold on to is
[1:04:17] between life and death Hallelujah
[1:04:21] earnestly content honestly argue
[1:04:25] honestly fight earnestly for the Fate so
[1:04:30] we are invited not to let the faith drop
[1:04:35] Hallelujah don't let the faith
[1:04:39] drop what are we to contend for this
[1:04:42] evening is it a historical God no is it
[1:04:46] a historical
[1:04:48] Affair is it a faith it is not a Fai it
[1:04:52] is the faith so we are inviting to
[1:04:56] contend Hallelujah for the
[1:05:00] faith contend for one faith and
[1:05:05] earnestly contend for that Faith what
[1:05:09] kind of Faith the very faith faith the
[1:05:12] Saints had amen and when you find that
[1:05:15] Faith contend Fai Hallelujah when you
[1:05:18] find that Faith content for it not only
[1:05:22] to argue but to hold fast yes to upheld
[1:05:28] to stay put to believe it to contend for
[1:05:33] it now if we ask ourselves all of us
[1:05:37] will say this evening that we are the
[1:05:41] people who are the ones who are
[1:05:44] earnestly
[1:05:48] contending all of us will
[1:05:51] say our church is
[1:05:54] contended we we are
[1:05:56] contending but question is are we
[1:06:00] contending for the whole
[1:06:04] thing the thing we need to remind
[1:06:07] ourselves amen you know God's Prophet
[1:06:10] tells us don't seed on anything that's
[1:06:14] right are we spending our time
[1:06:17] contending for our
[1:06:20] interpretation are we spending time for
[1:06:22] contented for what we see
[1:06:25] but our invitation is to examine our
[1:06:29] faith by the
[1:06:32] faith that was
[1:06:34] delivered to the Saint not our ideas not
[1:06:39] our thinking but the examine our faith
[1:06:44] Hallelujah
[1:06:46] remember 33 years after there was a
[1:06:51] falling away amen 33 years
[1:06:56] that group got tangled up in a short
[1:07:00] time what about 57
[1:07:05] years what about this
[1:07:08] group 57 years after the passing of the
[1:07:13] Prophet what about us we need to examine
[1:07:16] ourselves by the grace of the Lord so
[1:07:20] they were asked to
[1:07:23] contem after a short time
[1:07:26] they got off the track they got off the
[1:07:29] beaten path what about you and
[1:07:32] I tonight
[1:07:35] amen this message that the Lord has
[1:07:38] blessed our hearts with God's prit in
[1:07:41] the message God's chosen place of
[1:07:44] worship tells us how fitting and
[1:07:47] matching this is to Luke
[1:07:51] 17:30 when the son of man Eagle will be
[1:07:55] revealed in
[1:07:56] himself I want you to look at this to
[1:07:58] bring to North all other places of
[1:08:03] worship is see what we have to content
[1:08:05] for is see what we have to contend
[1:08:08] for this message has brought to
[1:08:13] not all other places of
[1:08:17] worship yes to bring to not other places
[1:08:21] of worship that's what the last day
[1:08:24] Eagle is to do
[1:08:26] to show the whole rest of it is
[1:08:28] foolishness denomination is folly to
[1:08:32] point them again with the same sign that
[1:08:35] at the end that he's the same yesterday
[1:08:38] today and forever so we already know the
[1:08:41] rest is
[1:08:42] rubbish we already know there's nothing
[1:08:45] to the
[1:08:47] rest there's nothing to the rest so all
[1:08:50] that we have as a matter of fact the
[1:08:52] only sacred thing we have is this
[1:08:54] message
[1:08:56] there's nothing in this world that is
[1:08:58] lasting there's nothing that is holding
[1:09:01] up nothing nothing Family Life politics
[1:09:04] whatsoever you call it but the only
[1:09:07] sacred thing we remain with is with the
[1:09:10] word of God
[1:09:12] Amen so God's Prophet put together Jude
[1:09:17] 1 and three and he tells us Jude 1 and3
[1:09:22] is written to all the churches all
[1:09:25] Church
[1:09:26] but is specifically for this
[1:09:31] age come on church we are the people
[1:09:36] amen it's specifically for this age it's
[1:09:39] written for all you know this is the
[1:09:42] people who are called to
[1:09:45] content remember the Apostle Paul amen
[1:09:48] he witness a situation and he said amen
[1:09:52] in Acts 20 he said Grievious w wolves
[1:09:56] will
[1:09:57] enter you have to watch for the Grievous
[1:10:00] wolves Grievous wolves will
[1:10:03] enter in not sparing the flock
[1:10:07] Hallelujah come on we have to
[1:10:09] contend amen God's Prophet described
[1:10:12] them Wolves of sheep stealing
[1:10:14] dogs they are going to come along amen
[1:10:18] Paul's testimony is that once I am gone
[1:10:22] they will try to come and claim a equal
[1:10:29] Revelation so you see where the
[1:10:31] contention going to come from Pentecost
[1:10:33] will give you no
[1:10:38] trouble have I said
[1:10:40] enough the denominational world will
[1:10:43] give us no
[1:10:45] trouble as a matter of fact they out is
[1:10:48] not you know what North is North is
[1:10:52] North you could multiply North how much
[1:10:53] you want it's still
[1:10:57] lot but they're going to be Grievous
[1:11:00] wolves once I have gone there are some
[1:11:04] foress coming that why God's Prophet
[1:11:06] tells people like
[1:11:08] us God have a hard time after he bless
[1:11:11] us to keep us
[1:11:16] humble not only us all of you we want to
[1:11:20] be bigger than God
[1:11:26] okay
[1:11:28] Hallelujah so God's Prophet tie those
[1:11:31] scriptures together amen so just to
[1:11:35] close off now I just want to share a
[1:11:38] quotation to you that I believe is very
[1:11:43] significant in our Battle of
[1:11:48] contending I rest my
[1:11:50] keys Christ is the mystery of God
[1:11:53] revealed
[1:11:55] Wesley was a man of
[1:11:58] God but what followed him Fallen
[1:12:07] Angels what was the Angels the first
[1:12:10] created beings of God that fell for
[1:12:13] Lucifer's wisdom fell for Lucifer and
[1:12:16] you see what they become fallen
[1:12:20] angels and he has show us a
[1:12:23] pattern that fall Angels follow Luther
[1:12:27] Fallen Angels follow Wesley Fallen
[1:12:30] Angels follow Pentecost you think is
[1:12:36] only ask
[1:12:38] yourself where our where this Fallen AG
[1:12:41] is going to come from is going to come
[1:12:44] from among me and
[1:12:47] you you see what a contending we have to
[1:12:50] do you see how we have to guard the door
[1:12:54] you see have to guard the
[1:12:58] entrance the last one and he shows us
[1:13:01] that in a man who can turn on the light
[1:13:03] and in turning on the
[1:13:05] light paragraph 250 there's a man who
[1:13:08] can turn on the light now you know you
[1:13:11] ain't going to take a
[1:13:13] Pentecostal and deceive him with a
[1:13:15] Methodist
[1:13:17] Doctrine or a Baptist Doctrine you ain't
[1:13:21] going to tell him that he knows
[1:13:23] better you you ain't going to deceive
[1:13:26] some Baptist with a Lutheran Doctrine
[1:13:29] either and neither are you going to
[1:13:31] receive the message or see the message
[1:13:33] now in this word by some Pentecostal
[1:13:36] Doctrine he's showing us a

[1:23:58] lives can we stand as we read the word
[1:24:00] of almighty God
[1:24:29] Matthew
[1:24:30] 7:10 Mark
[1:24:32] 16:20 Ephesians
[1:24:36] 41-6
[1:24:40] amen Matthew
[1:24:43] 17:10 and I'd like you to listen to the
[1:24:46] scriptures and the quotes that will be
[1:24:47] read there's a special reason I'm
[1:24:50] reading tonight and uh
[1:24:54] as brother rblo said uh brother Peter
[1:24:57] came from a different angle he came from
[1:25:00] a different angle so tonight I'm coming
[1:25:03] also from a different angle but we all
[1:25:07] contending for the same Faith amen so it
[1:25:12] says here uh
[1:25:14] 17:10 and the disciples asked him saying
[1:25:18] uh why then say the scribes that Elias
[1:25:21] must first come and Jesus answered and
[1:25:24] said said unto them Elias truly shall
[1:25:27] first come and restore all things so
[1:25:31] there's something striking there they
[1:25:34] ask him about Elias but he's speaking of
[1:25:37] another Elias that must first come and
[1:25:40] restore all things okay so he says here
[1:25:45] uh then he turns around but I say unto
[1:25:48] you that Elias is is come already and
[1:25:53] they knew
[1:25:55] right and they knew him
[1:25:57] not but they have done unto him
[1:25:59] whatsoever they listed likewise so shall
[1:26:03] it also be when the son of
[1:26:05] man suffer for them then listen the
[1:26:10] disciples understood that he spake unto
[1:26:13] them of John the Baptist wow so then we
[1:26:18] go to Mark 16:20
[1:26:28] a very familiar
[1:26:32] scripture if you have it and they went
[1:26:36] forth and preached everywhere watch the
[1:26:40] Lord working with them and confirming
[1:26:44] the word with signs following them amen
[1:26:50] and then uh Ephesians
[1:27:07] Ephesians
[1:27:11] 4 and we read from verse 1 to
[1:27:17] 6 therefore the prisoner of the Lord
[1:27:20] beseech you that he walk worthy of the
[1:27:23] vocation where with ye are called with
[1:27:26] all loneliness and meekness with
[1:27:28] longsuffering forbearing one another in
[1:27:32] love end end endeavoring to keep the
[1:27:36] unity of the spirit in the bond of
[1:27:40] peace there's one body one
[1:27:45] Spirit it says here even as ye are
[1:27:49] called in one hope of your
[1:27:52] calling one Lord
[1:27:55] One Faith one baptism one God and Father
[1:27:59] of all whom is above all and through all
[1:28:04] and in you all may the Lord add a
[1:28:07] blessing to the reading of his word you
[1:28:08] may be seated God bless
[1:28:22] you uh
[1:28:24] forgive me for rolling up my sleeves and
[1:28:26] taking off my
[1:28:28] jacket but uh I kind of feel more free
[1:28:31] when I do
[1:28:32] this
[1:28:35] uh I he brother all laughing you can see
[1:28:39] me doing it
[1:28:45] [Laughter]
[1:28:48] today yes sir so
[1:28:52] uh I got a title to tonight One Faith
[1:28:56] one Lord one
[1:29:00] baptism now there's not many faiths
[1:29:03] there's only one Faith as much as it is
[1:29:07] declare I don't know how many thousands
[1:29:09] of denominations is out there he said
[1:29:12] but there's one Lord One Faith one Lord
[1:29:14] one baptism my
[1:29:17] subject now I was just going to say two
[1:29:19] things but I thought hey people will
[1:29:22] wonder what's two things so I'm putting
[1:29:24] here Malachi 4 is to do two
[1:29:29] things amen so that's message talk
[1:29:33] right
[1:29:35] inspiration and brother Theo this is Ty
[1:29:38] still into your
[1:29:39] inspiration let's contend for the faith
[1:29:42] restored by Malachi
[1:29:47] 4 and you're going to find out as we go
[1:29:49] along please stay with me it's not
[1:29:51] something
[1:29:52] different but but Malachi 4 had
[1:29:55] something extra that the early church
[1:29:58] had that's right that's right so if
[1:30:00] we're going to go back just to the early
[1:30:02] church we're going to find out we come
[1:30:04] short
[1:30:05] somewhere because Malachi 4 restored
[1:30:09] more then what Jude was speaking about
[1:30:13] and brother Delhi I don't know you were
[1:30:14] a student I checked uh
[1:30:18] ad33 when he wrote it and then I CH I
[1:30:22] checked when did John write The Book of
[1:30:24] Revelation and they said at he died at
[1:30:29] ad
[1:30:31] 98 so maybe when he wrote Revelation I
[1:30:36] don't know if Jude was born or even
[1:30:40] wrad but it's not the contentious
[1:30:44] issue right contending but not
[1:30:47] contentious thank you
[1:30:49] sir so let's look at this a bit he says
[1:30:53] you earnestly cont for the faith the
[1:30:55] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:30:56] Saints then the first one to introduce
[1:31:00] the faith for the Christian church was
[1:31:03] none other than Jesus
[1:31:06] himself now this is beautiful because he
[1:31:09] says contend for the faith once
[1:31:11] delivered to the Saints but the one that
[1:31:13] introduced the faith was actually Jesus
[1:31:16] Christ and you're going to see why
[1:31:19] because it starts with him and it ends
[1:31:21] with him oh Hallelujah he was the
[1:31:25] introduction of the faith that was to be
[1:31:27] handed to the Christian church do you
[1:31:30] believe that now we'll have to see what
[1:31:32] he was we'll have to see what kind of a
[1:31:35] church he organized and see what kind of
[1:31:37] a Doctrine he preached and what kind of
[1:31:40] The Works he did and what he left for
[1:31:42] the people to do and then see if the
[1:31:46] disciples watch now so he done it first
[1:31:50] so that's right and then he had to watch
[1:31:52] now what the disciples is going to
[1:31:54] follow and how they going to do and he
[1:31:56] says here and then see if the disciples
[1:32:00] if they done the same thing he did and
[1:32:03] the way he did then we'll know by the
[1:32:06] Bible what the faith is that was once
[1:32:10] delivered to the
[1:32:12] Saints so our first example is Jesus
[1:32:15] Christ then if the disciples come back
[1:32:17] and do what he did then we know okay
[1:32:20] that's a faith that was once delivered
[1:32:22] to the Saints h
[1:32:24] Hallelujah okay I want you also to I
[1:32:27] don't know if I must even read this but
[1:32:29] just to let us get into it Malachi 4
[1:32:32] behold I sent you Elijah the prophet
[1:32:34] before the coming of the great and
[1:32:36] Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall
[1:32:38] turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[1:32:42] children and then Brahman says and is
[1:32:44] the conjunction and the hearts of the
[1:32:46] children to the fathers lest I come and
[1:32:48] smite the Earth with a curse so there
[1:32:51] has two portions two things happening
[1:32:53] here and I was surprised brother Theo
[1:32:56] every time I check I checked uh Jude he
[1:32:59] connected it with Malachi 4: 5 and
[1:33:04] 6 so brother there's a connection
[1:33:07] there's something happening and I know

[1:33:11] this that we have is greater than what
[1:33:13] Jude was speaking about it's greater
[1:33:16] than what Paul had Paul had signs he had
[1:33:18] wonders he had Miracles and we all want
[1:33:21] that but you know there's more than that
[1:33:24] Hey Brother the last restoration is

[1:33:41] word say that for me say that what I
[1:33:44] believe you sit there you're going to
[1:33:46] stay dead but if you start acting

[1:33:51] devil on whose side I am he didn't let
[1:33:54] the devil win why do you think you're
[1:33:56] here brother you fought through battles

[1:34:13] was delivered he says yeah now remember
[1:34:16] this is just 33 years brother green
[1:34:18] after the inauguration of the church
[1:34:20] Pentecost 33 years later there there has
[1:34:23] been such a falling away until Jew says
[1:34:26] yeah under the inspiration brother Theo
[1:34:29] of the holy spirit is sending the letter
[1:34:31] to the churches to earnestly contend for
[1:34:34] the faith that was once delivered to the
[1:34:36] Saints now if we can only find out what
[1:34:39] kind of a
[1:34:42] faith the the the first Saints had then
[1:34:46] we can find out what kind of a faith we
[1:34:49] can find out what kind of a faith we
[1:34:51] must contain for brother Del yes if we
[1:34:55] don't know what the faith was what are
[1:34:57] we contending
[1:34:58] for but the faith is oh
[1:35:01] my God help me so content for is that
[1:35:05] right but we must remember what kind of
[1:35:08] faith faith it was now listen here he
[1:35:12] says the disciples thought
[1:35:14] repentance and you might say but brother
[1:35:16] Amon this is all Beginnings we all know
[1:35:18] it you start I said but listen here
[1:35:20] something hidden here right this the
[1:35:23] deciples taught repentance water baptism
[1:35:27] Divine Healing resurrection of the Dead
[1:35:30] manifestation of the power of the Holy
[1:35:31] Ghost signs wonders spoke with tongues

[1:35:37] the sick open the blinded eyes saw
[1:35:41] Visions you mean that's the first church

[1:35:46] that was the alpha Church what about the
[1:35:49] Omega Church brother the Omega Church
[1:35:51] needs to have this in it

[1:35:59] and I'm going to say something the Omega
[1:36:01] Church does have
[1:36:03] [Applause]
[1:36:11] it so the Omega Church has got to have
[1:36:14] what the alpha church has so it's got to
[1:36:17] be the same and once we find out what
[1:36:19] they had then we preach repentance we
[1:36:21] preach baptism in the name of Jesus we
[1:36:24] preach lay on of hands we play healing
[1:36:26] brother Deli said last night he has

[1:36:31] dead been raised I saw a woman in our
[1:36:33] church she had a a cancerous tumor

[1:36:38] time to live she came for prayer and she
[1:36:41] went back when she went back tumor is

[1:37:22] you're going to find out brother it
[1:37:24] gives you something more than
[1:37:26] healing more than

[1:37:35] oh so he says here now I have to skip
[1:37:38] and I put the the ones in Red so that I
[1:37:41] don't have to read the whole quote
[1:37:42] there's only one
[1:37:44] Faith One Faith one Lord one baptism and
[1:37:48] that's the faith of the Lord Jesus
[1:37:50] Christ is the only Faith now he says
[1:37:52] here uh now he's addressing this telling
[1:37:56] them that those that are Sanctified he
[1:37:59] says yeah it's not a
[1:38:03] faith that was
[1:38:05] delivered it says it was the faith that
[1:38:10] was delivered do you notice there it
[1:38:13] says the faith was once delivered to the
[1:38:16] Saints not just a faith some people say
[1:38:20] well that's against my
[1:38:21] faith and you might be tonight say man
[1:38:24] this gu with a message I I'm not with
[1:38:26] him it's against my faith brother sister
[1:38:29] you're going to find out there's only
[1:38:30] one Faith one baptism one Lord not three
[1:38:35] Gods it's one
[1:38:36] God and if you baptize in the name of
[1:38:39] Father Son and Holy Ghost it's a false
[1:38:41] baptism you need to be baptized in the
[1:38:44] name of the one God the Lord Jesus
[1:38:47] Christ
[1:38:49] amen amen hallelujah not just the faith
[1:38:55] Hallelujah listen to this my I like this
[1:38:58] one are you
[1:39:00] ready brother he says earnestly content
[1:39:03] for the faith he says the faith that was
[1:39:06] once delivered to the Saints what was
[1:39:11] it my he's asking a question himself the
[1:39:15] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:39:16] Saints what was it you know what's his
[1:39:20] next words the spirit of Christ in the
[1:39:24] apostles that's the faith that was
[1:39:26] delivered to the Saints so we're not
[1:39:28] preaching a God that's far off we
[1:39:30] preaching a God that's here that's in
[1:39:32] the people that's in these ministers
[1:39:34] that's in the people tonight that's the
[1:39:36] faith that's the faith brother so where
[1:39:39] you walk the Holy Spirit walk where you
[1:39:41] go Angels go why the holy spirit is the
[1:39:45] faith that was once deliver to the
[1:39:48] Saints he didn't let the devil win he
[1:39:51] thought he had you but now the the Holy
[1:39:53] Ghost got you woo Hallelujah the Holy
[1:39:57] Ghost is in
[1:39:58] you my
[1:40:03] [Applause]
[1:40:09] Hallelujah it says the spirit of Christ
[1:40:12] in the apostles that's the
[1:40:14] faith and he says the Lord went with
[1:40:17] them watch how beautiful the scripture
[1:40:19] to do what to confirm the
[1:40:21] word so it's not not our word it's not
[1:40:24] it's not mine it's not
[1:40:28] mine hallelujah it's not for me to bring
[1:40:31] this word to
[1:40:34] pass sorry man it's not my it's not for
[1:40:38] me to bring this to pass this is already
[1:40:41] Vindicated this is Vindicated By An
[1:40:43] Angel by a Prophet by the pill of fire
[1:40:46] so it's not on me it's up to God God
[1:40:50] send the message God send the prophet
[1:40:53] God send the Holy Ghost you must believe
[1:40:56] it yes Lord yes Lord it's for
[1:41:01] [Applause]
[1:41:05] me my everyone want to protect the
[1:41:09] message it's not your duty the holy
[1:41:12] spirit is here
[1:41:14] oh that Mighty angel with a swear back
[1:41:17] Wings he's yet to uphold this message
[1:41:20] it's not going to fall to the ground
[1:41:22] it's not going to be grandle brother I
[1:41:24] don't care if the whole world walks away
[1:41:27] I don't care every church member don't
[1:41:29] believe there's going to be a bride that
[1:41:32] believe this word that will stand and
[1:41:34] uphold it why there's an
[1:41:36] angel the holy spirit is that angel
[1:41:45] [Applause]
[1:41:54] Hallelujah so if the Lord went with the
[1:41:57] Omega bride that means the Lord goes I
[1:42:00] mean went with the alpha bride that
[1:42:02] means the Lord goes with a Omega bride
[1:42:05] so no matter what they
[1:42:08] say you know Hallelujah I like to say
[1:42:12] this don't become a
[1:42:15] product don't become a product of some
[1:42:19] man's opinion or some woman's opinion
[1:42:22] and say are you not nothing headstone is
[1:42:24] nothing this church is nothing brother
[1:42:28] there's their opinion but when I read
[1:42:31] this message it tells me I'm a Son of
[1:42:33] God it tells me I'm going to be adopted
[1:42:36] it tells me I'm going to receive the
[1:42:38] Holy Ghost it tells me I'm going to fill
[1:42:40] with the power of God so brother who do
[1:42:43] I listen to not to the world not to the
[1:42:46] church not to any man not to any group I
[1:42:49] listen to
[1:42:50] God God in the prophet said I'm a Son of
[1:42:54] God he said I'll be adopted he said I'll
[1:42:58] be
[1:42:59] perfected Woo is there a shouting
[1:43:02] [Applause]
[1:43:11] [Music]
[1:43:14] house so we got to be so careful what we
[1:43:17] say about one another because the Lord
[1:43:20] goes with the people
[1:43:24] the Lord goes to confirm the word
[1:43:26] hallelujah so don't say no there's
[1:43:28] nothing happening be
[1:43:30] careful wow I I wrote you Simon the
[1:43:34] Sorcerer in in Acts uh 8:9 he saw the
[1:43:38] power of God and brother Isaac he was
[1:43:40] deceiving them with line wonders and
[1:43:42] attracting the people here come Phillip
[1:43:45] on with the true baptism of the holy
[1:43:47] spirit filled with God and he come and
[1:43:51] he did signs and wonders but yes Simon
[1:43:53] the Sorcerer sees that he deceived the
[1:43:56] people but when he saw that power hey he
[1:44:01] wanted to buy it brother Cosmos he
[1:44:03] wanted to buy it you can't buy the Holy
[1:44:06] Ghost you can't buy the message of the
[1:44:08] hour you can't put a price on the Holy
[1:44:11] Ghost you can't brother the Holy Ghost
[1:44:14] is a gift to you God promise you the
[1:44:17] Holy Ghost you shall receive the Holy
[1:44:19] Ghost it's yours by promise
[1:44:23] no amount of money woo
[1:44:26] Hallelujah my god brother he the lion
[1:44:31] of thank you
[1:44:37] man and and and and Philip told him die
[1:44:40] with all what you try man he he almost
[1:44:43] cursed him and he said please please
[1:44:45] don't say anymore you see that you can't
[1:44:47] buy this power and people want this
[1:44:50] anointing you can't buy this anointing
[1:44:53] it comes by divine inspiration it comes
[1:44:56] by the preaching of the word the Holy
[1:44:59] Spirit follows the word the spoken word
[1:45:02] brother stephanus the Holy Spirit
[1:45:04] follows that to bring it to
[1:45:06] pass Hallelujah so tonight you mustn't
[1:45:09] worry who's next to you you must get
[1:45:13] loose if you're worried who's next to
[1:45:16] you and who's going to brother you'll
[1:45:17] never receive the Holy Spirit but if you
[1:45:20] break loose tonight and say it's my
[1:45:24] brother watch the Holy Ghost come to you
[1:45:26] and meet with you and you'll be full
[1:45:28] sealed
[1:45:30] [Applause]
[1:45:41] baptized so he says addressing it you
[1:45:44] may be seated to the to the Sanctified
[1:45:46] ones now the Acts of the Apostles are
[1:45:49] showing what the acts the Holy Spirit
[1:45:51] did by the Apostles so we have an idea
[1:45:55] what must happen the Lord working with
[1:45:58] them so he says wasn't so from the
[1:46:01] beginning it wasn't so from the
[1:46:03] beginning the way they got the holy
[1:46:05] ghost at the beginning it's got to be
[1:46:07] the same
[1:46:08] today now now I'm very worried of our
[1:46:11] churches in the group I mean our
[1:46:13] churches in the message our groups
[1:46:15] because they getting away how did they
[1:46:17] receive the Holy

[1:46:22] power of the Holy Spirit brother BM says
[1:46:25] you Catholics mother Mary was staggering
[1:46:28] under the holy spirit before she could
[1:46:30] go to heaven so if they got the holy
[1:46:33] ghost acting like drunk people how are
[1:46:36] we going to have the Holy Ghost when we
[1:46:38] sit all dead and still we got to say God

[1:46:47] Spirit woo Hallelujah I feel fire on
[1:46:51] that man and this comes fresh brother B

[1:59:20] Ben says it was a the same tribe of GAD
[1:59:25] that was prepared to live with the Enemy
[1:59:28] he says was in gadara that's why they
[1:59:31] chased them away look how that thing
[1:59:33] come back on your Generations your
[1:59:36] decision you make tonight is so
[1:59:39] important because it's going to come
[1:59:41] back on your wife on your children on
[1:59:43] your children's children on your
[1:59:45] grandchildren on your great
[1:59:47] grandchildren why because the decision

[1:59:52] rather say Lord make me a part of it
[1:59:54] tonight I want the Holy Ghost I want to
[1:59:57] be
[2:00:08] saved I want to get you something so you
[2:00:11] may be seated so in the message circles
[2:00:14] we all know Malachi 4 and it speaks of
[2:00:17] two Messengers first one was John he'll
[2:00:21] come and turn the hearts of the fathers
[2:00:24] to the children who was the fathers
[2:00:26] Jesus and the disciples they were the
[2:00:29] fathers so that was John's job but he
[2:00:32] said Malachi 4:6 says he will turn the
[2:00:36] hearts of the
[2:00:38] children to the
[2:00:40] fathers wow so it's not
[2:00:45] confusing because John had to turn their
[2:00:48] hearts back to Jesus that's why I
[2:00:50] introduce him but when Malachi 4 comes
[2:00:55] after 2,000 years he takes the hearts of
[2:00:58] the children and what does he do he turn
[2:01:02] it back to what the Pentecostal fathers
[2:01:05] oh I feel a shout coming on me brother
[2:01:08] so you mean Malachi 4 was sent for a
[2:01:10] purpose to bring back and restore now
[2:01:14] there something beautiful brother Peter
[2:01:17] in in in in in uh Jude the faith once
[2:01:21] the
[2:01:22] delivered but yeah in Malachi 4 BR ISAC
[2:01:26] it's not delivered it's
[2:01:29] restored so one is delivered one is
[2:01:32] restored oh I hope you I hope you see
[2:01:35] that brother so it was delivered to them
[2:01:38] it was ordained for them but then the
[2:01:40] Palmer wom eat it and the caterpillar
[2:01:42] and all they eat that what they eat it
[2:01:44] to a stump but what did he say I will
[2:01:49] restore woo I will restore brother Delhi
[2:01:53] I'll bring that church back I delivered
[2:01:56] it they ate it they killed it but now
[2:01:59] I'm raising up Luther I'm raising up
[2:02:02] Wesley I'm raising up Pentecost and here
[2:02:05] come Malachi 4 He restored the
[2:02:08] Church one was
[2:02:11] delivered the second one is
[2:02:14] restored once it's restored you can't
[2:02:18] kill it
[2:02:20] again Hallelujah
[2:02:24] hallelujah
[2:02:28] hallelujah you see they could kill it
[2:02:30] brother green but not this last
[2:02:34] three cuz there's no other ages this is
[2:02:37] the
[2:02:38] finality that's why it's so important to
[2:02:40] recognize the message of the hour if
[2:02:43] you're not in the message you better run
[2:02:45] from your church get in the
[2:02:48] message you're going to find out only
[2:02:50] this message
[2:02:52] thanes

[2:02:58] run to I don't care how much money you
[2:03:01] have this message takes you in the
[2:03:03] Rapture this message is going to change
[2:03:05] your body this message is going to
[2:03:07] transform you this message has got wapt
[2:03:10] you in faith
[2:03:23] so every time you go to Jude brother B
[2:03:28] refers you back to
[2:03:30] Malachi so somehow he connected that two
[2:03:33] together so you can't separate
[2:03:36] it it's there I can read all the quotes
[2:03:38] here but it's going to save time he says
[2:03:42] but it does not say that the hearts of
[2:03:44] the children will turn to the fathers
[2:03:47] that he says watch is yet to take place
[2:03:52] the hearts of the last day children will
[2:03:54] be turned back to Pentecostal fathers
[2:03:57] John got the fathers ready for Jesus to
[2:03:59] welcome the the children uh into the the
[2:04:04] fold now this
[2:04:06] Prophet upon whom the spirit of Elijah
[2:04:09] Falls will prepare the children to

[2:04:15] brother there's something happening John
[2:04:17] here welcome the fathers right at the
[2:04:20] first coming of Christ
[2:04:22] but this message comes here right at the
[2:04:24] end what does he do he welcomes the
[2:04:27] children back to meet
[2:04:31] who oh come on man you mean so I have to
[2:04:34] believe this yes you have to believe
[2:04:37] this in order to be to introduced to him
[2:04:40] John
[2:04:42] said Behold the Lamb of God that takes
[2:04:44] away the son of the world only John knew
[2:04:47] him why he saw the dove coming down who
[2:04:50] was this prophet
[2:04:52] he was baptized in the 17th person here

[2:06:48] loving so he says there's a compound
[2:06:51] meaning
[2:06:52] showing Elijah and Elias to come

[2:06:59] comes he will turn the hearts of the
[2:07:01] children back to the faith of the

[2:31:31] Hallelujah now I I'm rejoicing over that
[2:31:34] because I can't bring it to pass but he
[2:31:36] said before the coming of the Lord you

[2:32:00] wow he says you can kill the messenger
[2:32:04] but you can't kill the
[2:32:07] message so they killed him but he said
[2:32:10] in the days of the
[2:32:12] voice he's not here but his voice is
[2:32:14] here so they kill him but you can't kill
[2:32:17] the message
[2:32:22] H I have to bring this in two
[2:32:26] things it's very
[2:32:28] important and I think brother the will
[2:32:30] connect beautiful and it's not a
[2:32:33] Doctrine please it's brother brandham
[2:32:36] this is a quote from the prophet so when
[2:32:39] I read he don't say ah there we go be
[2:32:43] very careful he says in the Lan Church
[2:32:48] age now this message mess of Malachi 4
[2:32:51] and Revelation 10:7 is going to do two
[2:32:55] things so in other words the whole
[2:32:57] message is wrapped up in two
[2:33:01] things brother Deli two
[2:33:03] things so the whole message brother
[2:33:05] Isaac is wrapped up in two things
[2:33:07] because this messenger is going to do
[2:33:09] two things one according to Malachi 4
[2:33:13] he's going to turn the hearts of the
[2:33:15] children back to the faith of the
[2:33:17] fathers you want to hear number two
[2:33:21] number two he will reveal the mysteries
[2:33:23] of the seven thunders in Revelations 10
[2:33:26] which are the revelations contained in
[2:33:28] the Seven Seals it will be these
[2:33:31] divinely revealed mystery truths that
[2:33:34] will literally turn the hearts of the
[2:33:37] children back to the faith of the
[2:33:39] fathers so are we preaching restoration
[2:33:42] well then Malachi is for he's going to
[2:33:44] do two things one according to the
[2:33:46] message he's going to re the mysteries
[2:33:48] in Revelations
[2:33:51] do those Mysteries contained in re is
[2:33:55] going to
[2:33:57] literally Hallelujah and tonight you in
[2:34:00] the turn he's busy turning you I feel
[2:34:03] you turning and he says that's going to
[2:34:05] literally

[2:34:09] going to be such a power of Dynamics
[2:34:13] when the Holy Spirit Falls and he pours

[2:34:22] tonight don't say I heard that before

[2:34:36] reality man this quote is a
[2:34:41] reality we have to preach it I could
