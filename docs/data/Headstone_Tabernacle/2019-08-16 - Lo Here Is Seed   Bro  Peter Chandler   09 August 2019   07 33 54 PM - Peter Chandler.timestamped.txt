[52:40] glory and the praise hallelujah well
[52:43] today I want to bring a thought to you
[52:45] and I brought some slides along maybe
[52:47] the brothers will help me to get them
[52:50] going for you and I would like us to
[52:52] stand as we go straight to the
[52:53] scriptures and I have a selection of
[52:56] scriptures which it is my prayer that
[52:58] they will be inspiring to you in this
[53:03] great inspiration they that sow in tears
[53:09] shall reap in joy a man and it's a very
[53:15] very special inspiration to me I wanted
[53:18] to start in the book of Genesis chapter
[53:21] 47 because we're talking about seed
[53:24] today seed in the days of Joseph was the
[53:29] most valuable commodity it was almost a
[53:34] currency in itself it was worth more
[53:37] than money practically and and I hope we
[53:41] feel the same way today that these seeds
[53:44] are so precious shall we say exceedingly
[53:48] precious amen
[53:51] Jose it's Genesis 47 and then Joe and 23
[53:56] then Joseph said unto the people behold
[54:00] I have bought you this day and your land
[54:05] for pharaoh lo here is seat for you and
[54:09] you shall sow the land praise the Lord
[54:14] so there's seed and they're sewing it
[54:19] Joseph never did it you have to sow and
[54:22] Hosea 10:12 goes on to say so to
[54:28] yourselves in righteousness reap in
[54:32] mercy break up your fallow ground
[54:38] for it is time to seek the Lord till he
[54:44] come and reign righteousness upon you
[54:49] Amos 8:11 behold the days come saith the
[54:56] Lord that I will send a famine in the
[55:01] land not a famine of bread nor a thirst
[55:07] of water but of hearing the words
[55:13] hearing the words of the Lord let's go
[55:19] on to acts 3 6 then Peter said silver
[55:24] and gold have I none hmm but such as I
[55:30] have I give thee in the name of Jesus
[55:36] Christ rise up and walk let's close with
[55:40] Galatians 3:16 Thank You brothers now to
[55:46] Abraham and his seed were the promises
[55:49] made and he saith not cease and to seeds
[55:55] as of many but as of one and to thy seed
[56:00] which is Christ Lord Jesus we want to
[56:05] thank you just for this honor to speak
[56:07] about your word and Lord to get behind
[56:10] Malachi for as your word has taught us
[56:14] and brother branham picked up this great
[56:17] statement it is God's law to receive a
[56:23] vindicated servant and Lord Jesus we
[56:27] thank you for Malachi 4 in this season
[56:29] we see the vindication we see how you've
[56:33] worked with him we see the perfect
[56:36] sounding of his message God we just
[56:39] can't thank you enough that we have been
[56:41] called by this voice of the seventh
[56:44] angel God we give you glory and we give
[56:48] you praise today be with us in these few
[56:50] words may they bring
[56:52] great encouragement in Jesus name I ask
[56:55] it amen and amen you can't be seen it
[56:57] says God bless you I've got a title I'm
[57:04] trying to harmonize and synchronize with
[57:09] the inspiration today which is sowing
[57:12] and reaping and I've just chosen a title
[57:14] lo here is seed amen
[57:18] and we know that one of the greatest
[57:20] messages brother Branham preached on
[57:21] seed is the spoken word is the original
[57:26] seed praise be to God and we are just
[57:31] gonna touch on this great scenario which
[57:34] happened in is in Genesis 47 where I
[57:38] tell you the famine you can't say they
[57:41] were surprised because Joseph was under
[57:43] a kind of eagle anointing where he knew
[57:47] it was coming he knew there would be
[57:49] good time and he knew there would be a
[57:52] bad time after that and that Eagle
[57:55] anointing prepared him for that bad time
[57:58] to come and Joseph put all that seed
[58:02] into storage and we've been told the
[58:05] same thing by brother Branham to store
[58:08] up the food a man in your car you should
[58:11] be having the tapes playing amen
[58:16] if you go online you should be looking
[58:18] at what the Prophet is saying don't
[58:20] waste your good years spend your good
[58:24] year as well get into the messages spend
[58:28] your time praying spend your time going
[58:31] through the books and spend your time
[58:34] just storing up and when you think
[58:37] you've got enough store up some more and
[58:39] add some more and some more you will
[58:42] never have enough of this message praise
[58:44] the Lord and what you store will become
[58:47] spiritual food in due season there's
[58:51] coming a time when when everybody is
[58:53] crying amen when the pressure comes down
[58:57] something is going to rise up in you the
[59:00] world will never understand it but God
[59:03] is already on the job now
[59:05] are you glad for Malachi 4 can you wave
[59:07] your hand and say Amen hallelujah to God
[59:11] be the glory
[59:12] I'm going to go my first slide brother
[59:14] at the back there and I'm taking a quote
[59:17] just to start with it the seed is not
[59:19] air with the shock and I want to start
[59:22] with this Luther went to husk with his
[59:26] first word that just shall live by faith
[59:30] Wesley had two words amen and it was
[59:35] sanctification the second work of grace
[59:39] Pentecost had the third word the
[59:42] restoration of the gifts Amen so that
[59:46] was the three that came but the entire
[59:50] seed has to come forth the entire seed
[59:56] and I'm so glad for this message which
[59:59] is the entire seed of God amen brother
[1:00:04] Branham called at the end time seed sign
[1:00:08] when you see the seed come only in this
[1:00:12] time can we say lo here is seed for you
[1:00:15] because the end time has produced the
[1:00:18] entire seed Luther couldn't do that
[1:00:22] Luther could only preach justification
[1:00:26] Moosa could only say lo here is
[1:00:30] justification he was surrounded by
[1:00:33] Catholicism but he said here I stand so
[1:00:37] help me God
[1:00:38] here I stand by faith alone solo today
[1:00:44] he stood and all Luther to say is no
[1:00:48] here is justification all Wesley could
[1:00:52] say is low here is sanctification a man
[1:00:57] that's all he had he never knew the
[1:01:01] things that were coming later that he
[1:01:04] said lo here is sanctification and he
[1:01:07] and the spirit roared through him no yes
[1:01:11] they call them Methodists but he said lo
[1:01:14] it is living right the paint
[1:01:17] they received the baptism of the Holy
[1:01:20] Ghost and they said lo here is the Holy
[1:01:23] Ghost here is the new birth here is
[1:01:27] baptism in Jesus Christ's name
[1:01:29] here's the gifts of the Spirit but they
[1:01:31] weren't there yet because there was
[1:01:34] coming one more stage and we can say in
[1:01:37] this age
[1:01:38] no here is seed for you from Malachi for
[1:01:43] it is precious seed hallelujah it is
[1:01:48] great seed exceedingly precious praise
[1:01:51] be to God
[1:01:52] I'm so glad just to know these things be
[1:01:56] living in the seed age hallelujah who
[1:01:59] can shout Amen to these things
[1:02:02] hallelujah glory be to the name of the
[1:02:06] Lord amen that's what we are with we are
[1:02:10] a seed people we have the entirety of
[1:02:14] the seed the entirety you know you can
[1:02:18] take one drop of water out of the sea
[1:02:22] and that drop of water contains the
[1:02:24] whole ocean hallelujah
[1:02:28] even though it's only one drop but every
[1:02:32] element of the ocean is in that one drop
[1:02:34] and I tell you the seed that Malachi 4
[1:02:38] is giving us brother it's got everything
[1:02:41] in it everything you need is in it even
[1:02:45] rapturing faith is in that seed
[1:02:48] hallelujah glory to God
[1:02:50] rapturing faith is inside there hey man
[1:02:54] if you need a healing it's in there if
[1:02:57] you need deliverance is in there if you
[1:03:00] need the Holy Ghost it's in there

[1:03:05] become like God himself

[1:03:11] moment spoken word is the original seed

[1:14:44] moment there was a there was a unep that
[1:14:48] had so much he was working on a queen
[1:14:52] Candace but he came to Jerusalem to
[1:14:57] worship but he came to Jerusalem and he
[1:15:01] he left Jerusalem a bit wandering and he
[1:15:07] took his Bible and he went into a
[1:15:10] portion of Isaiah and at the same time
[1:15:15] God was working and angel was directing
[1:15:19] someone and he sat there what does this
[1:15:24] mean he and Philip came up to him and
[1:15:29] said these words I understand this now
[1:15:34] what you're reading
[1:15:36] do you understand so it's not just he
[1:15:40] had the Bible he had the written word
[1:15:45] hey man he didn't know what he was
[1:15:48] reading he said who is this man
[1:15:54] what's the prophet talking of himself or
[1:15:59] was he talking about another one and
[1:16:02] Philip was listening and Philip said lo
[1:16:08] this is Jesus
[1:16:11] that we're talking about it and he gave
[1:16:14] him the seed and he baptized the eunuch
[1:16:17] and by the time he finished baptism the
[1:16:20] unit came to thank him and Philip was
[1:16:21] gone because he did his work hallelujah
[1:16:26] let me read reporter Brown said he said
[1:16:28] although an angel directed Philip to him
[1:16:31] but the germ of life had to come through
[1:16:35] the body Philip or brother we're on the
[1:16:39] line now where the germ come from
[1:16:41] through the angel no the angel showed
[1:16:45] him where to go an angel is a messenger
[1:16:49] but here is a son Philip had the germ
[1:16:53] the message the word that's how a child
[1:16:58] can be born hallelujah Church I'm so
[1:17:02] glad for this seed that we have we're
[1:17:05] not only reading the Bible but we're
[1:17:07] understanding what it's saying Alleluia
[1:17:10] we have the word but we have the
[1:17:12] understanding also hallelujah praise be
[1:17:16] to God Church this is a very great thing
[1:17:20] you can have the Bible here but about
[1:17:23] the prophecy of spoken word is the
[1:17:25] original seed the Bible has got to be in
[1:17:28] you the word is a seed as long as it's
[1:17:34] laying here
[1:17:35] it won't do nothing but when it comes in
[1:17:40] here then it begins to manifest by the
[1:17:46] Holy Spirit the works of God then
[1:17:49] visions come power comes humility comes
[1:17:53] all your know-it-all is gone hallelujah
[1:17:57] because it's not about it being here you
[1:18:00] can't say well I've got a Bible it's got
[1:18:02] to be inside here hallelujah I put a
[1:18:06] picture up there if you if you catch it
[1:18:09] amen about Jesus walking on the road to
[1:18:12] Emmaus Church the disciples were walking
[1:18:16] with him and he said didn't our hearts
[1:18:19] burn within us
[1:18:21] because the word was already inside here
[1:18:24] and when Christ spoke there it is their
[1:18:27] hearts was burning because the word was
[1:18:30] already inside there
[1:18:31] it was reviving the word that was
[1:18:33] already in there hallelujah
