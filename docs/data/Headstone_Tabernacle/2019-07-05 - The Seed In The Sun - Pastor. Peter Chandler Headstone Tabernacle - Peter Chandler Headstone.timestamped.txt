[49:39] welcome each and every one of you here
[49:41] to our harvest convention 2019 and this
[49:52] was one of the things that we put out
[49:54] from secondhand room where rom says and
[49:57] God has never left himself on earth
[49:58] without a witness but as always
[50:01] somewhere someplace had a person he
[50:04] could put his hands on that would stand
[50:06] for witness so he has did that don't you
[50:09] Genesis the beginning surely God has a
[50:12] man that he can lays on no for he he has
[50:17] more than one man that he can lay his
[50:21] hands on because we are coming down to
[50:25] the gathering time
[50:28] the harvest time so it's not one man he
[50:31] has more men that he could lay his hands
[50:34] on and over these few days you're gonna
[50:37] see some men that God has placed his
[50:39] hands on because it's harvest time we
[50:42] don't need less men we need more men
[50:46] because the harvest is right but the
[50:49] lever is a few so we tango for these

[55:06] you and as the precious Word of God
[55:09] means a lot for me brother brand him I
[55:13] just want to take only this one quote
[55:17] from a letter from brother Branham and
[55:19] it means also much for me to encourage
[55:22] us in the time we are living to make to
[55:26] make it to make it real in our heart
[55:31] to anoint ourselves and he is writing in
[55:35] a letter of 58 - it was a voice of
[55:39] healing and he's saying I now purpose to
[55:44] be away for a rest for a few months
[55:46] waiting on God and gaining new strings
[55:49] I'm confident that I will return to the
[55:53] field prepared for the fresh and greater
[55:56] anointing and I believe now this is a
[55:59] point please please watch it now
[56:01] I believe brother Branham said sets a
[56:04] vision of the coming glory will be
[56:08] fulfilled and he by his grades are a
[56:14] part of this coming lorry make use in
[56:19] these meetings to get closer to him and
[56:24] speak to him personally it's not it's
[56:27] not so much our face the Prophet said
[56:33] God cannot can only have confidence in
[56:36] you when you fellowship with him and
[56:39] this is what we are coming here to
[56:42] fellowship with him during this time and
[56:46] this attitude of believing and prophets
[56:51] spoke of a true witness and to be a
[56:54] witness and we had one true witness but

[1:15:05] Dunant of the harvest time it's not
[1:15:07] ruthless time it's not Wiz least I'm not
[1:15:10] the Pentecostal time but this is harvest
[1:15:13] time may a few words that I will speak
[1:15:16] be a great inspiration to you is my
[1:15:19] prayer the scriptures I want to look at
[1:15:22] today in the what shall I do I'll just
[1:15:24] raise my hand I guess to go on to the
[1:15:27] next slide I want to go just in these
[1:15:30] four scriptures so I'm 27 verse 1 the
[1:15:33] Lord is my light and my salvation whom
[1:15:39] shall I fear him and the Lord is the
[1:15:46] strength of my life of whom shall I be
[1:15:50] afraid

[1:16:02] come your shall doubtless come again
[1:16:07] with rejoicing bringing his sheaves with
[1:16:11] him
[1:16:13] man charity can't fail Isaiah 59 19 so
[1:16:19] shall they fear the name of the Lord
[1:16:21] from the west and his glory from the
[1:16:25] rising of the Sun when the enemy shall
[1:16:31] come in like a flood the Spirit of the
[1:16:34] Lord shall raise lift up a standard
[1:16:38] against him
[1:16:40] hallelujah man finally Galatians 6:8 for
[1:16:46] he that soweth to his flesh shall of the
[1:16:50] flesh reap corruption but he that soweth
[1:16:55] to the spirit shall of the Spirit reap
[1:16:58] life everlasting
[1:17:01] praise be to God let's go to be the
[1:17:04] picture slide brothers and then we will
[1:17:06] pray now gracious God
[1:17:07] I'm very if you were honored not only to
[1:17:11] be behind the sacred desk today but also
[1:17:13] to be seeing my beloved brethren the

[1:17:18] express my the depths of my appreciation
[1:17:22] to each one without exception dear God

[1:17:28] God may they collectively receive my
[1:17:32] very deep appreciation Lord and love for
[1:17:35] them for the better we are fighting
[1:17:37] together for the their arms we are

[1:18:02] you can be seated since God bless you
[1:18:04] richly praise be to God and I wanted to
[1:18:07] bring a little thought today which ties
[1:18:10] in obviously with the harvest time
[1:18:14] inspiration and I'm calling it seed in
[1:18:17] the son
[1:18:19] it sounds good it sounds happy but let's
[1:18:23] talk about it amen because it is the
[1:18:26] seed that's in the Sun and brothers you
[1:18:29] could just go to the next slide
[1:18:30] pretty much when I turn my papers you
[1:18:32] can just start over here the harvest
[1:18:34] time and I wanted to talk about this
[1:18:36] great great subject as Noah and Moses
[1:18:40] and David reflected the coming of this
[1:18:45] perfect bridegroom
[1:18:47] so has Luther Pentecost and wisly and
[1:18:53] Pentecost reflected the coming of a
[1:18:57] perfect bride isn't that real clear a
[1:19:00] man as those reflectors reflected
[1:19:05] jeepers
[1:19:06] he was a masterpiece so is the bride and
[1:19:09] identified masterpiece hallelujah and it
[1:19:13] came on like that and God is depending
[1:19:17] on you to be cut by the hammer by the
[1:19:22] chisel he's depending on you to stand
[1:19:26] there and say Lord cut me Lord
[1:19:31] shake me Lord take away everything
[1:19:35] that's not me hallelujah he's depending
[1:19:40] on you to stand there say Lord I'm ready
[1:19:42] to be cut hallelujah
[1:19:45] somebody once said we love the surgeon
[1:19:48] but we don't like the knife
[1:19:51] we love the surgeon which is the Lord
[1:19:54] Jesus Christ but we don't like the knife
[1:19:56] the knife hurts but we give God glory
[1:19:58] he's chipping chipping chipping chipping
[1:20:01] everything away that we can become a
[1:20:04] masterpiece in this end time praise be
[1:20:07] to God that's why I put the picture of
[1:20:09] the masterpiece up there let's go let's
[1:20:11] go next to the next picture brothers and
[1:20:13] here's something I think is gonna be a
[1:20:15] blessing to you but now at the end time
[1:20:19] look at this shucks here notice in the
[1:20:23] wheat
[1:20:24] the complete mystery of the life is suit
[1:20:31] up inside that shock we see it in Luther
[1:20:37] coming up we see it in tassel coming up
[1:20:41] we see it in the stalk coming up coming
[1:20:46] over here now it's in the in a shuck
[1:20:48] form almost like at the Pentecostal age
[1:20:51] but the real mystery is hidden inside
[1:20:57] hallelujah that's where you'll find it
[1:20:59] inside there you can't just rejoice with
[1:21:03] the shock the shock is just doing a job
[1:21:06] hallelujah but inside is the mystery
[1:21:09] that is sealed up I guess that seal has
[1:21:13] to be broken Amen for this this mystery
[1:21:17] to be revealed and now that all these
[1:21:20] are kind of platform quotations and the
[1:21:23] next one can play brothers he says oh
[1:21:24] brother sister are you catching it
[1:21:28] we can go cross brothers to the to the
[1:21:31] next life thanks and he says don't you
[1:21:33] see it's been failed all these ages
[1:21:39] according to what God said it will be
[1:21:43] opened in the last day those seven seals
[1:21:47] would be broke and the full thing would
[1:21:53] come into view of the people all right
[1:21:56] you God for the pool thing the seals
[1:22:01] have been broken we can see the fool

[1:22:20] the people and we we know the full thing

[1:22:26] took place all along

[1:22:30] something more deep and even just always
[1:22:33] a great teaching here brother band said

[1:59:43] one is that's what Jacob Jacob at lots
[1:59:45] of people around him but it came time
[1:59:48] for Jacob to be unprotected the Bible
[1:59:52] said he took all his people that would
[1:59:55] have died for him but he said go over
[1:59:58] the brook and Jacob was left alone to
[2:00:02] wrestle with that angel not with Bubba

[2:00:07] until the breaking of the day hallelujah
[2:00:10] Jacob had no one to protect him hey man
[2:00:14] even the angel never said oh he just
[2:00:17] slapped him he unprotected him but Jacob
[2:00:20] came away with power praise be to God it
[2:00:24] will come a time Church when God is
[2:00:26] going to remove the harvest time
[2:00:27] beautiful harvest time he will take away
[2:00:30] all that protection and you will stand
[2:00:33] alone
[2:00:33] and ripen before God and say I'm a son
[2:00:37] of God no matter what happens I am

[2:00:48] stay here amen even Jesus amen the
[2:00:51] parents forgot him
[2:00:52] they forgot him they did I thought he
[2:00:55] was following but he went back to the
[2:00:57] temple
[2:00:58] and Jesus never said mommy's left me she
[2:01:02] just started teaching he had no
[2:01:05] protection somebody could have reported
[2:01:07] them to social services you know for
[2:01:09] child neglect you know the stuff today
[2:01:11] but Jesus was all alone but he never
[2:01:14] said oh I'm alone and what watch - I'll
[2:01:17] just mention this then I'll move on he
[2:01:18] says he just feels just a little bitty
[2:01:20] thing back in the shock but he spoke for
[2:01:24] himself hallelujah
[2:01:26] you say what the word yet 12 years old

[2:01:49] wrong can be seated David he was a real
[2:02:01] shepherd hallelujah and he was ready to
[2:02:06] do what God showed him could be done and
[2:02:08] Saul came up to David and said no David
[2:02:11] this guy is a soldier from his from his
[2:02:15] youth David you need some protection
[2:02:18] David said I don't need no protection
[2:02:21] I've got all the protection I need
[2:02:23] just give me my slingshot and give me
[2:02:26] Jehovah in the name of Jehovah
[2:02:29] hallelujah so I wanted to arm David with
[2:02:32] his armor he put the helmet of brass on
[2:02:34] his head David he girded his sword and
[2:02:37] he is safe but he had not proved it he
[2:02:39] says I cannot go with
[2:02:41] David chose to go by faith instead of
[2:02:46] using swords Armour hallelujah he chose
[2:02:49] to go by faith let's move on brothers I

[2:03:34] divine love
[2:03:37] he was mature he was a real ripen son of
[2:03:42] God that divine love was his protection
[2:03:46] he said you poor creature you dumb brood
