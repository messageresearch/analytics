[26:58] [Music]
[27:08] God. Yeah. Psalms chapter 89 from verse
[27:13] one it says uh and I will sing of the
[27:17] mercies of the Lord
[27:18] forever. With my mouth will I make known
[27:22] thy faithfulness to all generations.
[27:26] For I have said, mercy shall be built up
[27:29] forever. Thy faithfulness shalt thou
[27:32] establish in the very heavens. I have
[27:35] made a covenant with my chosen, and I
[27:37] have sworn unto David, my servant. Thy
[27:40] seed will I establish forever, and build
[27:43] up thy throne to all generations, Silah.
[27:47] And the heavens shall praise thy
[27:49] wonders, O Lord. Thy faithfulness also
[27:52] in the congregation of the saints. For
[27:55] who in the heaven can be compared unto
[27:58] the Lord? Who among the sons of the
[28:01] mighty can be likened unto the Lord? God
[28:05] is greatly to be feared in the assembly
[28:08] of the saints and to be had in reverence
[28:12] of all them that are about him. May God
[28:15] add blessing to the reading of his word.
[28:18] Let us bow our heads. Let's lift our
[28:20] hands and pray in our own way as well
[28:23] this morning as we want to welcome the
[28:26] Lord this morning with our praises, with

[28:34] way this morning. And begin to release
[28:37] your faith this morning and talk to him.

[48:07] everything for me. You brought me out of

[52:55] Lord

[53:07] Praise the Lord. Let's just worship the
[53:09] Lord right now.
[53:11] Father God, we praise you, Lord Jesus.
[53:13] We thank you for your presence. We thank
[53:15] you for your spirit. We thank you for
[53:17] coming among us this morning. Father,
[53:19] may you minister to the sick, the
[53:21] afflicted, the needy, the bound. Lord,
[53:25] those that need a breakthrough, Father
[53:27] God, bring complete deliverance. I pray
[53:30] in Jesus name.
[53:32] Amen. God bless
[53:34] you. H so glad to be here this morning.
[53:38] and this song, have faith in God,
[53:40] because that's what we're going to speak
[53:42] about this morning about faith. So, God
[53:45] bless you. And if you have your Bibles,
[53:47] I'd like you to turn to Exodus chapter
[53:49] 3, we want to read verse 1 to8. James
[53:53] chapter 2, we want to read verse 17 to
[53:57] 24. Exodus chapter 3, reading verse 1
[54:01] to8.
[54:02] Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro, his
[54:04] father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and
[54:07] he led the flock to the backside of the
[54:09] desert, and the same and came to the
[54:12] mountain of God, even to
[54:15] Horeb. And the angel of the Lord
[54:17] appeared unto him in a flame of fire out
[54:19] of the midst of a bush. And he looked,
[54:22] and he, behold, the bush burned with
[54:25] fire, and the bush was not consumed.
[54:29] And Moses said, "I will now turn aside
[54:32] and see this great sight, why the bush
[54:35] is not burnt." And when the Lord saw
[54:39] that he turned aside to see, God called
[54:43] unto him out of the midst of the bush
[54:47] and said, "Moses, Moses." And he said,
[54:48] "Here am I." And he said, "Draw not nigh
[54:51] hither. Put off thy shoes from of thy
[54:54] feet. For the place whereon thou
[54:56] standest is holy ground." Moreover, he
[54:58] said, "I am the God of thy father, the
[55:01] God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the
[55:02] God of Jacob." And Moses hid his face,
[55:06] for he was afraid to look upon
[55:09] God. And the Lord said,"I have surely
[55:12] seen the affliction of my people which
[55:14] are in Egypt, and have heard their cry
[55:16] by reason of their task masters, and
[55:20] I know their sorrows. And I am come down
[55:25] to deliver them out of the hand of the
[55:28] Egyptians, and to bring them out of the
[55:31] land, unto a good land, a large a land
[55:35] flowing with milk and honey, unto the
[55:37] place of the Canaanites, and the
[55:39] Hittites, and the Amorites, and the
[55:42] Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the
[55:45] Jebusites. Let's now turn to James
[55:48] chapter 2, reading from verse 17. And
[55:51] this verse 17 is just after James is
[55:54] talking about if a brother is naked or
[55:55] destitute. You don't just tell them
[55:57] depart in peace but you give them
[55:59] something to wear or give them something
[56:01] to eat. So then in verse 17 he said he
[56:03] said what does it profit and you know
[56:05] you're not helping the person. So he
[56:07] said verse 17 now even so faith if it
[56:10] had not works is dead being alone. Yet a
[56:14] man say thou has faith and I have works.
[56:16] Show me thy faith without thy works, and
[56:18] I will show thee my faith by my works.
[56:21] Thou believe that there is one God, thou
[56:23] doest well. The devils also believe and
[56:25] tremble. But but but willil will thou
[56:28] know, o vain man, that faith without
[56:30] works is dead. Was not Abraham our
[56:33] father, justified by works, when he
[56:36] offered Isaac his son upon the altar?
[56:38] Seeing thou how faith wrought with his
[56:41] works, and by works was faith made
[56:45] perfect, and the scripture was
[56:47] fulfilled, which see Abraham believed
[56:50] God, and it was imputed unto him for
[56:53] righteousness, and he was called a
[56:55] friend of God. You see then how that by
[56:59] works a man is justified, and not by
[57:01] faith only. Let's pray one more time.
[57:03] Father, we thank you for your word and I
[57:05] pray this be edifying and liberating to
[57:07] your people. May faith take a hold
[57:09] tonight in Jesus name I ask it. Amen.
[57:11] Praise God. Bless you. May be seated.
[57:13] Oh, praise God. God bless you and
[57:15] welcome again.
[57:17] Okay. So today I'll be speaking a lot
[57:19] about faith cuz I feel that that is
[57:22] where we need some breakthrough in this
[57:24] thing called faith. Faith is God's
[57:26] currency. Not your feelings, not your
[57:28] cries, not your tears, not your
[57:29] emotions, but faith. So I have a title
[57:32] this evening, this morning.
[57:35] Works,
[57:37] experience,
[57:38] action accompanies faith. That's the
[57:41] title. Works,
[57:44] experience, action accompanies faith.
[57:48] And I have an inspiration, the obedience
[57:51] of faith. So faith have a lot of things
[57:54] connected with it. And that's my
[57:56] inspiration, the obedience of faith. And
[57:58] this obedience faith is where I get
[58:00] Romans 1:5. It says, "By whom we have
[58:02] received grace and apostilhip for
[58:05] obedience to the faith among all nations
[58:07] for his name." Uh, Romans 16:26 says,
[58:10] "But now is made manifest and by the
[58:14] scriptures of the prophets according to
[58:16] the commandment of the everlasting God,
[58:19] made known to all nations for the
[58:21] obedience of faith." Amen. Praise God.
[58:26] So
[58:27] therefore, reading about music or
[58:30] listening to music doesn't make you a
[58:33] musician. Why you think about
[58:36] that? To be a musician, you actually
[58:39] have to take up the instrument. Whether
[58:41] it's a guitar, whether it's a piano, and
[58:43] you have to put effort in it and
[58:45] practice in it. And that that practice
[58:49] and effort is what going to make you
[58:51] develop into this and become a musician.
[58:54] Looking at cooking videos and reading up
[58:57] on recipes doesn't make you a cook. I'm
[58:59] getting somewhere. There are people
[59:01] could look at recipes, look at uh uh
[59:04] video how to cook, how to cook, but
[59:05] unless you cut up the onion and the
[59:07] garlic and whatever you need to chop and
[59:10] mix and taste and what unless you do
[59:12] that, cooking is just a theory.
[59:16] Cooking is what you see other people
[59:17] doing. And I'm getting somewhere to that
[59:20] because reading spoken with books Amen.
[59:24] Listening to tapes,
[59:26] that doesn't make you a Christian.
[59:29] Do you get where I'm going now? Amen.
[59:32] Praise God. So, there's an element that
[59:35] many times is missing in people's life.
[59:38] You know, men are to pray and not to
[59:41] faint, but you have to also pray and
[59:43] obey.
[59:46] Do you see where I'm going now tonight?
[59:48] You have to actually pray and obey. So
[59:51] praying and not acting is wasting
[59:53] prayer. It's wasting time. There has to
[59:56] have action with your faith. It take
[59:58] faith to come here this morning. The
[59:59] weather wasn't that good and you have to
[1:00:02] be heading out and seeing the rain and
[1:00:03] still want to come. You could turn back
[1:00:04] if you want to, but you choose to come.
[1:00:07] That's an act of faith. Now that you are
[1:00:09] here, you want to go deeper and further.
[1:00:11] You don't want to miss anything. You
[1:00:12] want to catch what God trying to reveal
[1:00:14] to you and show you. So therefore it
[1:00:18] have applying what you have learned
[1:00:21] applying what you have heard come like
[1:00:23] you talk about but forgiveness and
[1:00:24] dropping ought if you hear that that's a
[1:00:26] word and this is where I'm beginning to
[1:00:29] see how unbelief really is sin and
[1:00:32] people still have unbelief and we have
[1:00:33] to repent of unbelief because if God say
[1:00:35] forgive and you don't you you disbelieve
[1:00:38] if God said trust him then you you're
[1:00:40] not believing him because he want you to
[1:00:42] trust him and I was telling my wife
[1:00:44] coming up I said you know money is power
[1:00:46] and many times when people of money,
[1:00:47] they figure they don't need God because
[1:00:50] they feel powerful. It's an anointing
[1:00:52] that goes with it. They don't have to
[1:00:54] ask anybody for anything. They don't
[1:00:55] have to ask permission to buy anything.
[1:00:57] They just do whatever they want to do.
[1:01:00] They go wherever they want to go because
[1:01:01] they feel empowered. And that's where
[1:01:04] people feel they're empowered in
[1:01:05] different kind of areas until God begin
[1:01:07] to humble them and break them and strip
[1:01:11] them. And then they realize God is is in
[1:01:14] charge. Isn't that right? So therefore
[1:01:17] we learn from our mistakes and if we
[1:01:18] don't learn something is wrong. All
[1:01:20] right. Now brother
[1:01:21] but now speaking this there are two
[1:01:25] different types of Christianity seems
[1:01:27] strange I would say not two different
[1:01:29] types I would say two different phases
[1:01:31] would be a better word to use. Two
[1:01:34] phases the same Christianity but two
[1:01:37] phases of it. One of them is an
[1:01:40] intellectual or mental conception of
[1:01:43] what God has said in his word and of
[1:01:46] Jesus Christ by way of knowledge and the
[1:01:49] other is an experimental experience that
[1:01:53] God has given the man in his heart. So
[1:01:56] that is why somebody could walk in here
[1:01:57] back sitting for 100 years and God do
[1:02:00] something in their heart and it changes
[1:02:02] them. Amen. The the man out there was
[1:02:05] talking about uh the Pharisee inside the
[1:02:07] building was saying, "I'm not like that
[1:02:08] man out there. I do this. I do that and
[1:02:11] that." And that man said, "Have mercy
[1:02:12] upon me. I'm unworthy." And Jesus
[1:02:15] examining both cases said, "The man
[1:02:17] outside was more justified than the man
[1:02:20] on the inside." So God still looks at
[1:02:23] that heart. So the prophet saying, "This
[1:02:25] one is intellectually hungering. He's
[1:02:28] feasting on God. His feast doesn't hold
[1:02:30] out. The other one seem to have the
[1:02:32] victory all the time. There's nothing
[1:02:33] bothers them. They solid and anchored as
[1:02:35] they can be. No trials, no storms
[1:02:38] bothers them at all. They seem to have
[1:02:40] something about them that people who are
[1:02:43] Christians trying to live for God admire
[1:02:45] that type of Christian and often wonder
[1:02:48] Lord what is it that these people have
[1:02:50] that the others crave for and they seem
[1:02:53] to fail to get it. Now you truly have
[1:02:56] two different mental faculties. You have
[1:02:58] one of them in your head by your brain
[1:03:02] and the the other is operated in your
[1:03:04] heart which is called your soul.
[1:03:08] So you have two things working there. So
[1:03:11] let's say this morning you have a
[1:03:13] certain expectation. You have a certain
[1:03:14] thought of what you would like to hear
[1:03:16] or you don't want to hear. But you see
[1:03:18] you can't use your senses where God is
[1:03:20] concerned. You have to use faith not
[1:03:24] your feelings. Faith. You come here
[1:03:26] because you want a breakthrough. You
[1:03:28] come here because you want to touch. You
[1:03:29] come here because you need help. You
[1:03:31] come here because you need to be in
[1:03:33] strengthened or empowered. You didn't
[1:03:34] come here to kill time because you have
[1:03:35] no place to go this morning. You come
[1:03:37] here because you really need something
[1:03:39] that you don't have. Something that God
[1:03:42] alone can give. Not even the preacher. I
[1:03:44] can't give it to you, but God can. I
[1:03:46] can't reveal it to you, but God can. The
[1:03:48] Holy Ghost. So, you need revelation
[1:03:51] because revelation is faith. Do you
[1:03:53] believe that? So but says two different
[1:03:56] mental faculties. You have one in your
[1:03:58] head, brain, other operating in your
[1:04:00] heart which is called the soul, your
[1:04:02] spirit and your soul. Now they are very
[1:04:03] much in disagreement many times. When
[1:04:06] the head seem to say something, the soul
[1:04:09] wonders at it like it's not right. And
[1:04:11] when it come to the soul, the head seem
[1:04:13] to step back. And that is why sometimes
[1:04:16] you get a sense of I should do this. or
[1:04:18] a wife tell her husband you shouldn't go
[1:04:20] down the road today you know and then
[1:04:21] next minute he hear some big accident or
[1:04:23] something she senses something that's
[1:04:25] that's not head that is heart that's not
[1:04:28] head that is soul and sometime if you're
[1:04:31] washing the ways you're doing something
[1:04:32] and somebody tell you pray and sometime
[1:04:34] God put somebody upon your heart to pray
[1:04:37] for that person right there and then
[1:04:38] don't don't wait I'm going to pray next
[1:04:40] two hours I'm going to pray next week no
[1:04:41] no no do it then because an inspiration
[1:04:44] come upon you to do that and you do it
[1:04:46] then and your breakthrough is right
[1:04:47] there okay the Lord some
[1:04:50] praises. Let's continue. I notice many
[1:04:53] people coming to me saying, "I have all
[1:04:54] faith, brother." That that's their mouth
[1:04:56] saying that
[1:04:58] and intellectually they are right here,
[1:05:00] but their heart isn't there. Because if
[1:05:04] it was, they wouldn't be on the platform
[1:05:06] to be prayed for for help of faith.
[1:05:10] Do you get that now? So when somebody
[1:05:12] have all faith and they go on the prayer
[1:05:13] line, they know all faith there because
[1:05:15] they want to hear. So somebody come from
[1:05:16] the prayer line and he say your name is
[1:05:18] so and so. Wow. And you start to explode
[1:05:20] in your mind. You're sick with so and so
[1:05:22] and last week you did so and so and so.
[1:05:24] And when the world begins to discern
[1:05:26] their condition their faith keep getting
[1:05:28] higher and higher because they know a
[1:05:29] man can't do that. Something inside of
[1:05:32] register that had to be God. And with
[1:05:34] that their faith explode and they walk
[1:05:36] out healed. But somebody with faith
[1:05:38] sitting on the congregation they don't
[1:05:40] need to come up here on the platform.
[1:05:42] They could take it and believe it and
[1:05:43] say God said so. God can't lie. God
[1:05:45] cannot make a promise that he can't
[1:05:47] keep. Man does lie, family does lie,
[1:05:50] boss does lie, teachers does lie, but
[1:05:52] God can't lie. And if God promis you a
[1:05:55] breakthrough, you're going to get that
[1:05:56] breakthrough. I don't care if you're in
[1:05:57] prison, I don't care what condition
[1:05:59] you're in this morning, you're going to
[1:06:00] get a breakthrough because God promised
[1:06:02] it. Oh, give the Lord a praise.
[1:06:04] Hallelujah. And one thing I love about
[1:06:06] God, he doesn't have to ask anybody
[1:06:08] permission to bless you, to help you, to
[1:06:10] deliver you, to free you, to heal you.
[1:06:13] Oh, give the Lord a shout. He doesn't
[1:06:15] have to ask your brother, your sister,
[1:06:17] your mother, your neighbor that who
[1:06:19] don't like you, your boss who want to
[1:06:20] fire you. It doesn't matter. Oh, give
[1:06:22] the Lord some praises. He is God and he
[1:06:24] change not. That's why I love him so.
[1:06:27] Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:06:29] Hallelujah. He will make your enemy
[1:06:31] crack up. He will make your enemy pack
[1:06:33] up. He will make the enemy run before
[1:06:35] you. Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:06:38] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I love what God
[1:06:40] tell Moses. He said, "I come down. I
[1:06:42] heard the cries of my people. The people
[1:06:44] are hearing me yet. I heard the cries of
[1:06:45] my people. They see them yet. But he
[1:06:47] tell Moses the whole package. I come
[1:06:49] down to deliver them to take them from
[1:06:51] where they are onto a big land. And he
[1:06:53] tell them what's inside that land. The
[1:06:55] Hittites are there. The Jebusites are
[1:06:57] there. The parasites are there. But
[1:06:59] we're going to drive them out. We're
[1:07:00] going to some praise this morning.
[1:07:02] That's what we here for in church this
[1:07:04] morning. To drive them out. You don't
[1:07:05] have to say sick. You don't have to stay
[1:07:07] b. We're going to get free this morning.
[1:07:10] Oh, it's our land. It's your land. God
[1:07:13] give you this land. No man could take it
[1:07:15] from you.
[1:07:17] [Music]
[1:07:23] Even the anointing that comes and your
[1:07:25] field that come to help your faith.
[1:07:30] That is not the faith you know that come
[1:07:33] to help your faith. When become mature
[1:07:36] in faith, it doesn't depend upon whether
[1:07:38] you feel anointed or not. Amen. The
[1:07:40] faith becomes part of who you are.
[1:07:44] Jesus didn't say, "Take a deep breath
[1:07:46] before I pray for the person."
[1:07:49] Jesus wasn't doing that. He says, "Pick
[1:07:52] up your bed and walk." Spoke. And the
[1:07:55] person pick up the bed and walk. He
[1:07:57] wasn't connected to feelings and
[1:07:58] emotion. When they get the report, uh,
[1:08:01] my Lord, my daughter's sick. Come and
[1:08:04] pray for her. Then somebody come and
[1:08:05] say, she's dead. And then Jesus said, I
[1:08:07] go wake her.
[1:08:09] He's talking from a revelation of faith.
[1:08:11] Isn't that right? And he walk and he
[1:08:13] raised her from the dead. Oh, give the
[1:08:15] Lord some praises. When your eyes see
[1:08:18] somebody dead, faith see them raised
[1:08:20] from the dead. When your eyes see
[1:08:22] somebody blind, faith see the blind see.
[1:08:24] The eyes see somebody deaf. Faith sees
[1:08:27] the hearing. The eyes see somebody dumb.
[1:08:30] Faith see the speaking. Your eyes see
[1:08:32] somebody passing. Faith see them
[1:08:34] restored. your hand and see them. Amen.
[1:08:37] Cold and former faith. See them revive.
[1:08:40] Oh, we come by faith this morning. We
[1:08:42] preach by faith this morning. We stand
[1:08:44] by faith this morning. Faith have to
[1:08:46] have something going with it. Faith is
[1:08:48] not a dead thing. Faith is a substance.
[1:08:50] Oh, give the Lord a shout. Hallelujah.
[1:08:53] Hallelujah. Faith is not imagination.
[1:08:55] Faith is a substance. And brother came
[1:08:58] to turn our hearts back to the faith of
[1:09:00] the fathers. Back to the substance that
[1:09:02] the father had. Oh, give the Lord some
[1:09:05] praises. Faith is not talk. Faith is
[1:09:08] when you walk in the talk. Oh, give the
[1:09:10] Lord some praises.
[1:09:12] [Applause]
[1:09:18] Let's go again. Reading about music or
[1:09:22] listening to music doesn't make someone
[1:09:24] a musician. You have hunters here. You
[1:09:27] could listen to tape on hunting, read
[1:09:29] book on hunting. What if you never went
[1:09:31] in the bush? Praise God. What are you
[1:09:33] doing? Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:09:36] Somebody come say, I'm a hunter. You
[1:09:38] know, I read 50 I listened to 50 videos
[1:09:41] in hunting. I borrow 10 books from the
[1:09:43] library and read all about hunting. How
[1:09:45] to hold a gun. You ever shoot a gun yet?
[1:09:51] I never
[1:09:53] have. So I could I could talk from what
[1:09:55] I've learned or what I've read. That's
[1:09:57] something called a recoil. When you
[1:09:59] shoot it, push back your shoulders. If
[1:10:01] you don't know about that and you come
[1:10:03] here, you think they don't know movie
[1:10:05] all kind of
[1:10:07] thing. The book telling about the
[1:10:09] mosquitoes and the snakes and the this
[1:10:12] and that is when you go in the bush have
[1:10:14] bush men here. They know I'm talking
[1:10:17] about I am not a hunter. I not going to
[1:10:19] no
[1:10:20] bush. Hallelujah. I believe that for the
[1:10:22] real hunters. I hunt in something else.
[1:10:25] I am a hunter but not that that kind of
[1:10:29] hunting. Reading about cooking, looking
[1:10:33] at videos of how to cook doesn't make
[1:10:35] one a cook. Reading about fishing, how
[1:10:39] to cast the line and you see people
[1:10:41] rolling back and the fish coming. Until
[1:10:43] you go by the sea and throw out your
[1:10:46] line and wait for hours and catch
[1:10:48] nothing and then try again and see how
[1:10:50] to do it, you ain't know nothing about
[1:10:52] fishing.
[1:10:55] Amen. That's why we come to close to
[1:10:57] with this part. Reading and listening to
[1:11:00] messages doesn't make someone a
[1:11:01] Christian or you put them in the bride.
[1:11:04] And this is what brother Abraham says
[1:11:05] here.
[1:11:06] Now watch. If the life of Jesus Christ
[1:11:10] ever puts out another body of believers,
[1:11:14] it will bear the fruit that the first
[1:11:16] one did. They will write a book of acts
[1:11:19] behind it. Notice what kind of book. Not
[1:11:22] a book of talk, a book of acts. It's
[1:11:25] called the acts of the apostle. It's
[1:11:28] something living. It's something moving.
[1:11:30] It's something active. Praise God. I
[1:11:32] told you last service, the devil is not
[1:11:34] passive. The devil are waiting, hoping.
[1:11:37] Hey, how you going? The devil is active,
[1:11:40] pursuing to destroy you. And you sit
[1:11:43] here normal, normal, normal, normal.
[1:11:46] Going to work, normal, going to home,
[1:11:47] normal. Not praying, normal. Not reading
[1:11:50] the Bible, normal. But the devil is
[1:11:52] actively planning to destroy your life.
[1:11:55] Oh the Lord, he's like a roaring lion
[1:11:58] seeking whom he may devour who he can
[1:12:01] devour to rip you of your faith. Because
[1:12:04] once your faith go everything fall down
[1:12:06] your experience come down. Once you lose
[1:12:08] faith that is it that's why Jesus told
[1:12:10] Peter I have prayed for you what he
[1:12:12] praying for that your faith fail not. He
[1:12:15] was praying for Peter faith problems
[1:12:18] going to come challenges going to come.
[1:12:20] We can't tell you how they going to
[1:12:22] come, but they coming anyhow. But you
[1:12:24] have to have faith when the trials come,
[1:12:26] when the testing come, when the
[1:12:27] tribulation come. Oh, give the Lord some
[1:12:29] praises. Praises. Praises. Glory to God.
[1:12:33] Hallelujah. Give the Lord a shout.
[1:12:38] America could talk all they want to
[1:12:40] talk. America never see bombs fall all
[1:12:42] over their places and their countries,
[1:12:44] all over the cities. They never see that
[1:12:46] before. The bombs is always in Iraq or
[1:12:48] Iran or some other places. outside of
[1:12:50] America. But there war coming, there
[1:12:53] bombs coming. Hallelujah. Are you with
[1:12:55] me? Storm is coming. You see, right now
[1:12:58] have a weather man. He say the weather
[1:13:00] and the storm and the wind and the dust
[1:13:02] and whatnot. You have to watch and hear
[1:13:03] what the weather man is saying because
[1:13:05] things are happening. And they are
[1:13:06] saying you get to prepare. The season
[1:13:08] change. You have to get your umbrella.
[1:13:10] You can't just walk by faith. And you're
[1:13:11] walking by faith. You will get wet. And
[1:13:13] that is not by faith. Give the Lord some
[1:13:15] praises. You have to get an umbrella.
[1:13:17] You don't have one, buy one. Praise God.
[1:13:19] You ain't stopping no rain right now.
[1:13:21] The season has changed. All the sunshine
[1:13:24] has rolled back. It's raining time. We
[1:13:27] need a rain. The Holy Ghost rain. The
[1:13:30] dynamic rain. The season has changed.
[1:13:32] Oh, give the Lord a shout. There's going
[1:13:35] to be a dynamic revival in this land.
[1:13:38] Oh, glory to God. When the season
[1:13:40] change, no devil could stop it. When
[1:13:42] your hour of blessing come, no devil
[1:13:44] could stop it. Nobody could take away
[1:13:46] what God ordained for you. Give the Lord
[1:13:48] a shout glory.
[1:13:52] [Applause]
[1:13:55] Hallelujah.
[1:13:57] Joseph as a young man, Joseph at a young
[1:14:00] man 17, 16, having visions and so on,
[1:14:03] sharing it with his older brothers, they
[1:14:05] get upset with him. Instead of jealous,
[1:14:07] a little quote, he make a nice coat for
[1:14:09] him of seven colors, rainbow colors, a
[1:14:12] multiolor coat. And what the brothers
[1:14:14] do? sell them out to another country all
[1:14:17] together, another tongue, another
[1:14:19] language, sell their own brother out.
[1:14:24] Little did they know they was pushing
[1:14:26] him into his destiny. So when people
[1:14:29] push you out and they reject you, they
[1:14:31] don't even know for such a time as this,
[1:14:34] God raised you up. Oh God, hallelujah.
[1:14:37] Hallelujah. All your life has been a
[1:14:40] journey to get you to this spot that you
[1:14:43] could see where you come from, where
[1:14:44] you're going, and the devil's a liar
[1:14:46] this morning. Oh, give the Lord a shout
[1:14:48] in the house. Oh, now something get
[1:14:50] excited.
[1:14:53] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:14:55] Hallelujah.
[1:14:56] [Applause]
[1:14:58] Hallelujah.
[1:15:03] The life of Jesus. Not what he said. the
[1:15:05] life of Jesus put forth another branch
[1:15:08] another church what they going to do
[1:15:10] have more churches no they will write
[1:15:12] another book of acts what was the book
[1:15:14] of act silver and gold have I none such
[1:15:16] as have I given unto you people can't
[1:15:19] come in church b and leave bong but what
[1:15:20] kind of thing is that you have to come
[1:15:22] here bong and leave your whole praise
[1:15:24] God it had lepers crying have mercy upon
[1:15:26] me son of David
[1:15:30] hallelujah to be a leper in them times
[1:15:32] there no healing for leprosy they put
[1:15:34] some big old pan on
[1:15:37] Tie down good with pan. Hallelujah. When
[1:15:39] you come turn come run because there's a
[1:15:42] contagious disease. God bless you, Mr.
[1:15:45] Leper. In the name of Jesus. Hallelujah.
[1:15:48] Nobody doing that.
[1:15:50] Even when them men come and ask me say
[1:15:53] go and show yourself to the priest.
[1:15:54] That's enough. Don't come
[1:15:56] closer. Go and show yourself to the
[1:15:59] priest. And they were healed when they
[1:16:02] come in obedience to what was spoken to
[1:16:05] them. So your your faith what you call
[1:16:08] faith have to come into obedience. When
[1:16:10] we see you obeying the word then we know
[1:16:12] your faith is becoming active. When you
[1:16:15] only hearing the word you become a
[1:16:17] hearer and not a doer. Oh glory to God.
[1:16:20] You have to get obedience of faith.
[1:16:23] Obedience to the faith. And and God know
[1:16:26] what you have to obey because everybody
[1:16:28] have a customized trials. It's not one
[1:16:30] fit all. You know, God know what to how
[1:16:33] to get to you. God know how to stir you
[1:16:35] up. God know how to crack you. Glory to
[1:16:38] God. Hallelujah. God know your weakness.
[1:16:41] God know your fears. God know your
[1:16:44] challenges. And God going to challenge
[1:16:46] you with your challenges. Oh, give the
[1:16:49] Lord some praises. He going to press
[1:16:51] you. He going to stir you. We not here
[1:16:54] to Hallelujah.
[1:17:06] Some point in time, y'all get fed up of
[1:17:08] you.
[1:17:15] Not your wife and you.
[1:17:19] Not your husband. You. The easiest thing
[1:17:22] is to get somebody to blame. And when
[1:17:24] you get somebody to blame, you make an
[1:17:25] excuse. It's she not me. It's he, not
[1:17:30] me. It's them, not me, it's the boss,
[1:17:33] it's the neighbor.
[1:17:36] But when you recognize the excuse carry
[1:17:38] no validity, it doesn't make any sense.
[1:17:41] Is you giving problems? As a brother
[1:17:44] tell me all them kings Darius Xerxes all
[1:17:47] them helping for the kingdom of God and
[1:17:49] helping build wall and helping do this
[1:17:51] and that is the people of God getting in
[1:17:53] trouble. All them old Ben king send them
[1:17:58] money sending to support the wall
[1:18:00] building they tell Nehemiah whatever you
[1:18:03] want you want wood you want discs go go
[1:18:05] and build.
[1:18:09] And the people of God will get in
[1:18:10] trouble. Hallelujah. The people who go
[1:18:12] out trying to deceive and tell people
[1:18:14] stop and hinder them from making
[1:18:16] progress.
[1:18:23] Blind leaders of the blind. Here we go.
[1:18:25] God alone hold the key. No theologian
[1:18:29] can tell you. It is not known. It is hid
[1:18:32] from them. They do nothing about it. So
[1:18:36] the schools when you say I've got a PhD
[1:18:37] LLD to me I believe to God and to any
[1:18:40] real believer that means you are just
[1:18:42] much further away from God. Here we go.
[1:18:44] Are you ready? God is not known by
[1:18:48] education. Hallelujah.
[1:18:51] He is not known by how to explain it.
[1:18:57] Will that cancel all the mysterious four
[1:18:59] five hour sermon pastors and ministers
[1:19:01] and prophets and apostles who unfold in
[1:19:03] the word for 5 hours to explain it
[1:19:06] because you want you to see it. You
[1:19:08] can't see it until God open your eyes.
[1:19:10] You can't see it until you get in the
[1:19:12] spirit. That's why I'm saying to you
[1:19:14] over and over, you'll hear me over and
[1:19:15] sing it like a piper. This is not a
[1:19:18] kingdom hall. This is not a Jehovah
[1:19:20] Witness group. You come here to get in
[1:19:22] the spirit because it take the Holy
[1:19:25] Ghost to give you revelation. I could
[1:19:27] speak and speak and speak. You ain't
[1:19:29] getting all you is information.
[1:19:32] But when the spirit comes, you get
[1:19:34] revelation. It make you stand up. It
[1:19:37] make you shout. It make you dance. It
[1:19:40] make you want to spin around. It make
[1:19:42] you say hallelujah. It make you say
[1:19:44] amen. When you're all when you're not in
[1:19:46] the spirit,
[1:19:49] you shake a head and hand goes to one
[1:19:52] thing. That in your spirit that you just
[1:19:54] tolerating, you're going through the
[1:19:55] motion. But when you're really in the
[1:19:56] spirit,
[1:19:58] [Applause]
[1:19:59] [Music]
[1:20:01] let's say you're you're short of cash.
[1:20:03] You're already struggling and somebody
[1:20:05] come and drop $1,000 on your own thing.
[1:20:07] What you going to
[1:20:09] do? I don't think it
[1:20:11] happen. You're bone dry like how Peter
[1:20:14] was. Silver and gold have I none. Bone
[1:20:16] dry. And somebody come and bless you.
[1:20:18] Hey, bye. Here man.
[1:20:27] Go and send me cousin g some trouble and
[1:20:30] talk about a punch about punch boy. This
[1:20:32] guy give me some problems and always
[1:20:34] fixing fixing fixing. He said why do I
[1:20:35] get old car? I said what is
[1:20:38] that? I don't know what that look like.
[1:20:41] You know the next day brother Angel
[1:20:43] called me and said we are proud of
[1:20:44] yourself
[1:20:46] not not two days after you know the next
[1:20:49] day this how God has work I'm clueless
[1:20:53] and that is what I'm driving right now
[1:20:55] like all that is inspiration you know I
[1:20:57] don't have to question things you know I
[1:20:59] just let the things flow because God
[1:21:02] have to work and if we see God working
[1:21:05] let God open the door let God work don't
[1:21:07] try to figure out anything praise God
[1:21:09] I'm not trying to figure out this
[1:21:10] service I come to pump some word inside
[1:21:12] of you that when you get faith inside of
[1:21:14] here, you'll be running to your house
[1:21:15] and run them devils out. Praise God. You
[1:21:18] will take an unbelief out your life.
[1:21:20] You'll be repenting and say, "God,
[1:21:21] forgive me for all the unbelief in my
[1:21:24] system. I claim my healing. I claim my
[1:21:27] deliverance. I claim my revival. I claim
[1:21:30] signs and wonders and miracles. Lord, I
[1:21:32] am a believer. You said you shall lay
[1:21:34] hands upon the sick and you shall
[1:21:36] recover." I am laying hands on
[1:21:39] myself. Oh, give the Lord a shout. Give
[1:21:42] the Lord a shout in the
[1:21:44] [Applause]
[1:21:52] house.
[1:21:54] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:21:57] Hallelujah.
[1:21:59] Glory.
[1:22:01] Glory. Glory.
[1:22:03] My God. How much things we witness and
[1:22:05] me and I and we know it's God. It
[1:22:08] couldn't work out anywhere else. Praise
[1:22:10] God. Even this place is all
[1:22:13] supernatural. How we get here?
[1:22:20] People walk in here now and they see a
[1:22:22] complete place, but they don't know the
[1:22:24] vision that brought us to here and how
[1:22:27] this came to be.
[1:22:30] So when we know it's God is no man
[1:22:31] inside of that, man can't eject himself
[1:22:34] inside of there. When when when Peter
[1:22:36] said thou the Christ the son of the
[1:22:38] living God, Jesus said flesh and blood
[1:22:40] hath not revealed it unto you. But my
[1:22:42] father in heaven and I will tell you
[1:22:43] something. When you get a revelation,
[1:22:45] you become fearless. When a revelation
[1:22:47] strike your soul, there is no fear. You
[1:22:50] fear no man, no bishop, no message pope,
[1:22:53] no interpretation. You fear no man
[1:22:55] whatsoever. Glory. When they send for
[1:22:58] Nehemiah, Nemiah say I'm doing a great
[1:23:01] work and I cannot come down now. Don't
[1:23:04] call me down. I almost reach the top. I
[1:23:06] almost reach the cap. I almost to pull
[1:23:09] down charity, the prize absolute. Oh,
[1:23:11] give the Lord a shout. I almost step
[1:23:13] into
[1:23:14] [Applause]
[1:23:16] loving me down now. I can't come down
[1:23:19] now.
[1:23:21] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Somebody say,
[1:23:24] "I'm feeling to party."
[1:23:28] Not now. Not now. You go and party by
[1:23:31] yourself.
[1:23:33] Not now. Hallelujah. A feeling to
[1:23:37] reinkrink and rejoice.
[1:23:39] Not now. No, I ain't called for that
[1:23:42] right now. I call to be separated.
[1:23:45] Moses.
[1:23:47] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Moses. We
[1:23:51] going to read it. Moses only hear from
[1:23:53] his mother. You are to be deliverer.
[1:23:54] You're born a special child. When they
[1:23:56] was killing everybody, I put you on the
[1:23:58] on the river and the alligators couldn't
[1:24:00] eat you. You were alligator proof, snake
[1:24:02] proof, mosquito proof. Oh glory, you're
[1:24:05] fully covered. It was under the blood.
[1:24:07] And then Pharaoh take care of you. Oh
[1:24:09] glory, you're a special child. You have
[1:24:11] a special anointing upon you. You are
[1:24:13] raised up for a purpose. I want to tell
[1:24:15] you, you are secret. Amen. You're like a
[1:24:18] secret agent. The mother pumping telling
[1:24:20] Moses all who he is. And when she
[1:24:22] finishing Moses, so Moses feeling
[1:24:24] inspired, ready to fight. And when he
[1:24:26] come to think, he kill a man. And Moses
[1:24:29] run. When I say run, run right out of
[1:24:32] Egypt.
[1:24:35] Because all he had was intellectual
[1:24:37] faith. Imm tell him the pastor tell him
[1:24:40] some elder tell him. He listen on a
[1:24:42] book. He hears on a tape but no reality.
[1:24:46] He never met the pillar of fire yet. Oh,
[1:24:48] but one day after 40 years, Moses
[1:24:53] relaxing. Oh, glory to God. You see a
[1:24:55] fire burning, burning, burning. He don't
[1:25:00] know what caused that fire. He don't
[1:25:02] know what stopped that fire. All you
[1:25:04] know the the bush wasn't being burnt.
[1:25:07] And he said, "I will turn aside to see."
[1:25:09] And the Bible said when Moses turned
[1:25:12] aside to see, and I hope you here this
[1:25:15] morning, you turn aside to see, turn
[1:25:18] from your stinking flesh, turn from your
[1:25:20] unbelief, turn from your past, turn from
[1:25:23] your sin, turn from your failures, turn
[1:25:26] from your fears to see God be waiting to
[1:25:29] give you an
[1:25:32] [Applause]
[1:25:34] experience. Glory to God. Give the Lord
[1:25:36] some praises. Praise God. Your head too
[1:25:39] heavy. You know too much. Too much ahead
[1:25:43] stuff.
[1:25:47] Hallelujah.
[1:25:49] What happened to Moses?
[1:25:51] When that pill of fire when he get
[1:25:53] counter with God, God said take off your
[1:25:56] shoes first.
[1:26:00] You know where I buy thy shoes.
[1:26:05] My son G was telling me about somebody
[1:26:06] wear shoes with some with some like
[1:26:08] diamond studs around the he never se
[1:26:09] shoes like
[1:26:12] that like like like diamonds around the
[1:26:14] bottom of the man heels with class
[1:26:17] stuff. Moses said but God you know where
[1:26:19] I get them shoes. You know how much I
[1:26:22] pay for them
[1:26:25] shoes man. God have to show who's the
[1:26:28] boss. God said the ground you standing
[1:26:30] on is not your own.
[1:26:32] talk that shoe talk when you're down in
[1:26:34] your in your tent. But on this ground,
[1:26:37] this is my ground. This is holy ground.
[1:26:39] And when you're on holy ground, get the
[1:26:42] right haircut. Get the right dress. Get
[1:26:45] the right wear. Get the right attitude.
[1:26:48] Come on, give the Lord a praise because
[1:26:49] you're not on your own ground. You're on
[1:26:51] my ground. Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[1:26:53] Take off your shoes. Take off your
[1:26:56] shoes. Oh, give the Lord a shout to the
[1:26:58] house.
[1:26:59] [Music]
[1:27:03] [Applause]
[1:27:09] Oh glory. These people know the history.
[1:27:12] Yes. They know the lineage. Abraham and
[1:27:15] Isaac and Jacob. So God have to tell
[1:27:17] them about what they know. He said, "I
[1:27:18] am the God of Abraham. I am the God of
[1:27:21] Isaac. I'm the God of Jacob." He said
[1:27:23] that whole line is come down there. I am
[1:27:25] the original God, the same God. And I
[1:27:27] come down to deliver and I am sending
[1:27:29] you. A man that run away 40 years of
[1:27:31] relaxing time. He taking chill. He
[1:27:34] cooling us out.
[1:27:37] With wife and family, private business.
[1:27:40] He in a little bubble along in Egypt in
[1:27:43] in in um in um in in in thing.
[1:27:46] Hallelujah. When God finished with him,
[1:27:49] he come down to his wife. He's had a
[1:27:52] backup. Did buy furniture yesterday?
[1:27:55] Fresh furniture from courts or whatever.
[1:27:58] She said, "Where we going?" Is it to
[1:27:59] Egypt? Egypt. What for? To take over.
[1:28:04] Anybody looking at a mad man? One man
[1:28:08] just heard from God. One man just
[1:28:11] encountered the pillar of fire. One man.
[1:28:13] The fire met the faith.
[1:28:16] [Applause]
[1:28:19] Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house.
[1:28:22] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. This
[1:28:25] is the first time Moses faith met the
[1:28:28] fire. And when that come together, a
[1:28:31] change man, a change ministry, a change
[1:28:36] anointing, a change witness. Oh God, he
[1:28:39] come down fearless.
[1:28:43] I can see Moses coming out to Egypt and
[1:28:45] somebody said, Moses, remember 20 years
[1:28:47] ago, you kill a man.
[1:28:49] Now if Moses was in the flesh, his faith
[1:28:51] weak, his faith dropped. Oh God, that's
[1:28:53] true. You know, good. They go, they go
[1:28:55] hold me. They have a one for my rest.
[1:28:57] Moses not in that mindset. He's out of
[1:28:59] the humanistic realm. He's in the realm
[1:29:01] of divine revelation. He's the realm of
[1:29:04] vision. He's the realm of the anointing
[1:29:06] and commission. This man is now
[1:29:08] anointed. This man always commissioned
[1:29:10] to bring them people out. And when God
[1:29:13] is with you, no devil could stop that.
[1:29:15] He went down straight to Pharaoh,
[1:29:17] straight down to Egypt. He said, "God,
[1:29:20] tell me um if it's okay, you could let
[1:29:23] them go." Not that kind of dog, you
[1:29:26] know. He come and said, "Thus say the
[1:29:28] Lord, let my people go. Let my people
[1:29:32] go. I bring the word, Pharaoh. But it
[1:29:35] was just talk." He gave Pharaoh some
[1:29:36] book and some tape and say, "Hold that
[1:29:38] Pharaoh." Say, "Let the people go." But
[1:29:40] he had come with talk only. He said, "If
[1:29:42] by this shall you know," and he chopped
[1:29:44] down his rod on the ground and his rod
[1:29:46] to a snake. Oh, God was baiting Pharaoh.
[1:29:50] God was baiting them bush doctors. God
[1:29:53] was baiting them. They said that is what
[1:29:55] you bringing. Stick turn to snake.
[1:29:59] Jonathan, please come forward.
[1:30:02] And fellas high.
[1:30:08] We will sit down here.
[1:30:11] And they come with two sticks and throw
[1:30:13] it down and they turn into snake. Now,
[1:30:16] if Moses didn't know he had, he run
[1:30:17] straight out, you know, said, "God, is
[1:30:19] this
[1:30:22] But Moses just stood right there and
[1:30:24] watched his snake eat up the other two
[1:30:26] snakes. Pick back up the rod. That is
[1:30:29] only wrong number one." That is to pull
[1:30:31] out that we on a supernatural battle
[1:30:33] here. Now, this is not word only.
[1:30:36] There's not quote versus quote. This is
[1:30:38] power and demonstration. That is where
[1:30:41] we going right now. Oh, give the Lord a
[1:30:43] shout. The devil that bind you, you will
[1:30:46] not bind him. The devil that rule you,
[1:30:49] you're going to rule him. The sin that
[1:30:51] conquered you, you will not conquer yet.
[1:30:53] Oh, give the Lord a shout. How many feel
[1:30:55] that this morning? How many feel that?
[1:30:58] Let your faith reach out to what we are
[1:31:00] preaching this morning. We are preaching
[1:31:02] to you the word of God. The devil's a
[1:31:05] liar. Don't even trust your feelings
[1:31:06] right now. Believe what God said. God
[1:31:09] can't lie. He's big enough to keep you.
[1:31:12] He's big enough to preserve you. If he
[1:31:14] could give Moses as a baby among
[1:31:17] alligators and stuff, he could keep you.
[1:31:19] Oh, glory. Give the Lord a shout.
[1:31:22] Whether you have a husband or not,
[1:31:23] whether a wife or not, whether a
[1:31:26] girlfriend or not, he could keep
[1:31:27] [Applause]
[1:31:30] you. The Lord that keepeth thee shall
[1:31:32] not slumber. Oh, glory. The Lord that
[1:31:36] keepeth the shall not sleep.
[1:31:39] He shall preserve your soul. Oh, give
[1:31:41] the Lord a shout. What do I have to
[1:31:44] fear? What do I have to dread? I'm
[1:31:46] leaning on the everlasting hand. Oh,
[1:31:49] give the Lord a shout.
[1:31:52] Leaning. Leaning. Oh, glory to God.
[1:31:57] [Applause]
[1:32:03] [Music]
[1:32:07] So, brother, you don't know. I want to
[1:32:09] explain it to you. God is not
[1:32:14] known by how to explain it.
[1:32:18] God is known by simplicity
[1:32:21] and of revelation of Jesus Christ to the
[1:32:24] most illiterate person. You don't even
[1:32:27] have to have an education to get
[1:32:30] revelation because revelation bypass
[1:32:32] your mind and drops into your heart.
[1:32:37] Only few people say amen on that. You
[1:32:39] should rejoice. I ain't saying they get
[1:32:41] degree or university or get Cxc. I'm
[1:32:44] telling you you don't. God has bypassed
[1:32:47] the intellect. The intellect is where
[1:32:49] you have doctorate and your CEO and
[1:32:52] you're a teacher or a doctor or a lawyer
[1:32:54] or a prime minister and all them post
[1:32:56] have your engineer and what that's here.
[1:32:59] You study a book and become engineer and
[1:33:01] you got big money. Hallelujah. You
[1:33:02] understand that that doesn't hear you
[1:33:04] know engineer have to repent you know
[1:33:06] doctors have to repent you know lawyers
[1:33:08] have to repent you know all them going
[1:33:09] to hell if they don't repent you know
[1:33:11] you understand that but a simple sister
[1:33:13] have no degree no education and God put
[1:33:16] something inside a soul that is a save
[1:33:19] soul you know when you get over yonder
[1:33:22] we going to sing and shout and dance
[1:33:24] about when we get over yonder you know
[1:33:27] glory to God our life not permanent here
[1:33:30] we let Abraham We are seeking a city
[1:33:34] whose maker and builder is God. Glory to
[1:33:37] God. Hallelujah.
[1:33:39] [Music]
[1:33:42] [Applause]
[1:33:47] Hallelujah.
[1:33:50] God has known my simplicity and of
[1:33:52] revelation of Jesus Christ to the most
[1:33:54] illiterate person. You see if God make a
[1:33:57] aision provision for
[1:33:58] that then you have to have education to
[1:34:01] understand this thing.
[1:34:03] When Isaiah say a virgin shall conceive
[1:34:05] if God had passed that through his
[1:34:06] intellect he must stop in the middle
[1:34:10] a virgin how to correct do I correct
[1:34:12] that
[1:34:13] Lord because a virgin can't conceive
[1:34:16] but Isaiah bypass his intellect spoke it
[1:34:21] a virgin shall conceive because God
[1:34:23] don't need no help to bring Messiah he
[1:34:25] just need a body
[1:34:28] he go organize the egg and the sperm but
[1:34:31] he just need a house to put it in. That
[1:34:33] house was Mary. She had to be a virgin.
[1:34:36] Hallelujah. The blood was God's blood.
[1:34:39] When Jesus died, it was God's blood. Oh,
[1:34:42] glory to God. Because the word became
[1:34:44] flesh. The word with flesh on it. Oh,
[1:34:47] glory to God. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:34:50] Praise God. Praise God. Isn't that
[1:34:52] something tonight? And he died to make a
[1:34:54] way for you and I. He had died for us to
[1:34:56] suffer. He died to make a provision that
[1:34:59] we come out of our sin. Come out of our
[1:35:01] unbelief. Come out of all of that. He
[1:35:03] died to make a way for us. Has he made a
[1:35:05] way? He has made a way. Not going to. He
[1:35:07] has made a way. Come on. Come on. On on
[1:35:10] that way. Get on that way. Get on this
[1:35:13] Holy Ghost train. Get on this Holy Ghost
[1:35:15] ride. Get in this Holy Ghost
[1:35:18] [Applause]
[1:35:20] [Music]
[1:35:22] bunch. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:35:26] [Music]
[1:35:29] Your praises right now is an expression
[1:35:32] of the faith you have in believing what
[1:35:34] you're hearing. You know, because the
[1:35:36] Bible said Abraham,
[1:35:38] old man. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Can't
[1:35:40] have no children. His wife is dead
[1:35:42] barren. And the Bible said he staggered
[1:35:45] not and the promise of God. True
[1:35:48] unbelief. True unbelief. Unbelief make
[1:35:52] you stagger. Unbelief you can step back
[1:35:55] and believe hinders you. And belief
[1:35:57] paralyzes you but faith give you freedom
[1:36:00] to speak, to live, to praise, to stand,
[1:36:04] to overcome. Faith is the victory that
[1:36:07] overcomes the world.
[1:36:11] [Music]
[1:36:12] [Applause]
[1:36:21] Hallelujah. Jesus.
[1:36:24] I remember one of my sons given some
[1:36:26] issues, some challenges, terrible
[1:36:28] challenges, real challenges. And he came
[1:36:30] to my office and I remember I almost
[1:36:33] said the wrong thing was just close to
[1:36:37] my lips. I watched him and I pointed
[1:36:39] him. I said, "You shall be delivered."
[1:36:41] Amen.
[1:36:43] I choose to speak that to the condition
[1:36:47] that I was seeing. Could you do that?
[1:36:50] Could you watch conditions around you
[1:36:52] and speak the right word
[1:36:58] and I live to see him to get delivered.
[1:37:05] That is how you walk in faith.
[1:37:07] The Bible said we walk not by sight but
[1:37:10] by faith. When you use your eyes, you
[1:37:13] are limited. When you use your eyes, you
[1:37:16] make excuses because using your eyes,
[1:37:18] you see every nobody claiming.
[1:37:22] Oh my goodness.
[1:37:24] I was I used to go to the ATM to get
[1:37:27] some money. I do some work. So I want to
[1:37:29] get some money. One bank long line and
[1:37:31] outside
[1:37:33] forget go another bank. bank have three
[1:37:36] it machines one line two line and a
[1:37:39] sideline there and I seen the machine
[1:37:40] there nobody in there so I asked a lady
[1:37:43] is that machine working she say I don't
[1:37:46] know nobody using
[1:37:52] it I went straight put in get the money
[1:37:55] walk back out
[1:37:59] now the thing about it time was of
[1:38:01] essence
[1:38:04] I couldn't have that length of time to
[1:38:05] stand up and wait. And God made a way.
[1:38:10] The people say nobody using it, but I
[1:38:12] commit to use it because I have faith to
[1:38:15] use it. You see that? There's a set up
[1:38:18] here now for me to go get and get out.
[1:38:21] Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house.
[1:38:23] Give the Lord some praises. That's the
[1:38:26] God we talking about. He just make a way
[1:38:28] where there's no way. Hallelujah. The
[1:38:30] reason I run from that back because the
[1:38:32] line was too long. I need to get a get
[1:38:34] get and move. It was waiting there for
[1:38:37] me. What if I say oh God the line the
[1:38:40] line the line but this time I see line
[1:38:41] you know but I still go by faith the
[1:38:44] line is stopping me. I see by faith
[1:38:45] there's a different I see a faith and
[1:38:47] that empty there that waiting for me and
[1:38:49] I am telling you if Abraham didn't take
[1:38:51] Isaac and go up on the mountain and
[1:38:55] begin to come down with that knife to
[1:38:56] kill him he never saw that ram in the
[1:38:58] ticket. You have to go up the mountain
[1:39:00] to see the ram. Come on. Preach back to
[1:39:02] me. Preach back to me. You're not seeing
[1:39:04] a ram in the valley. I want to hear you.
[1:39:06] Give me a shout in the house. You have
[1:39:09] to go up the mountain up Mount Mariah.
[1:39:12] [Applause]
[1:39:18] That is where Hallelujah.
[1:39:21] Hallelujah. Abraham t Isaac down. Isaac
[1:39:23] was no fool, you know. Isaac was a
[1:39:25] modern child, you know. He said, "Daddy,
[1:39:27] I see the wood. I see
[1:39:29] the I see no sacrifice, you know.
[1:39:33] So the boy start to antenna start to
[1:39:35] grow up and but but watch what the
[1:39:37] father say. God will provide for himself
[1:39:41] a sacrifice. He tie his son down. Yes.
[1:39:46] What if it was the modern kind of sons
[1:39:47] we have now? Hey,
[1:39:53] don't touch me. Don't touch me. That
[1:39:55] daddy don't touch me.
[1:39:57] If you touch me,
[1:40:00] daddy cannot.
[1:40:03] But this son was under obedience.
[1:40:06] He submitted himself.
[1:40:08] Abraham had faith because he know his
[1:40:10] body was dead. And if God could bring a
[1:40:12] son out of a dead man, God could raise
[1:40:14] back that dead.
[1:40:16] His his testimony is this. If this boy
[1:40:19] die, he could live because I was dead to
[1:40:21] begin with. And God brought something
[1:40:23] out of deadness. And you could be dead
[1:40:25] in here today. But God can bring
[1:40:26] something out of you. Don't just look at
[1:40:28] me. Amen. Like if I'm talking off the
[1:40:30] top of my head. Give the Lord a shout in
[1:40:33] the house.
[1:40:35] [Music]
[1:40:35] [Applause]
[1:40:43] When Abraham come down with his knife,
[1:40:45] the angel had to call him twice. But
[1:40:46] hold your hand. Hold your hand. This man
[1:40:49] walking in obedience of faith.

[1:41:45] tied up Abraham going to lasso to catch
[1:41:50] ramen lamb tied up already, you know,

[1:41:54] then God said, "Now I know you fear me.
[1:41:57] In blessing, I will bless thee. In
[1:41:59] multiplying, I will multiply thee and
[1:42:02] thy seed like this morning shall possess
[1:42:06] the gates of the enemy." God has said
[1:42:09] that the enemy will possess us. God say
[1:42:12] we will possess them. Thy seed shall
[1:42:15] possess what? What? Possess what? the
[1:42:18] case of sickness, cancer, leukemia,
[1:42:21] disease, eye problem, head problem,
[1:42:24] female problem, whatever problem, we're

[1:42:51] Hallelujah. May God do a miracle inside
[1:42:54] of here and turn your water into the
[1:42:56] wine of revelation. Oh, glory to God.
[1:42:59] You leave here stimulated with the
[1:43:01] revelation of the new wine.
[1:43:03] [Applause]
[1:43:04] [Music]
[1:43:07] Hallelujah.
[1:43:09] Hallelujah. When the Holy Ghost fell in
[1:43:11] the upper room and they start to act
[1:43:13] drunk, they say too early for Peter to
[1:43:15] be boozing like that and Peter to tell
[1:43:17] them these people didn't go into the rum
[1:43:19] shop. It not be that we had booze up
[1:43:21] there in the upper room. He said we are
[1:43:23] not drunk as you suppose but this is
[1:43:25] that the prophet Joel spake of this is
[1:43:28] the wine of revelation. It brings
[1:43:30] stimulation. We can't help it. Oh God is
[1:43:33] the stimulation of revelation. My God is
[1:43:35] better than coke. This better than
[1:43:37] marijuana. This better than ganja. Any
[1:43:40] drink you could take. This better than
[1:43:41] that. This is the new wine of God. This
[1:43:44] is stimulate in the inside. This joy I
[1:43:47] have, the devil didn't give it and the
[1:43:49] devil can't take it away. Oh, give the
[1:43:51] Lord a shout. This will put a dance in
[1:43:53] your feet. Shout in your heart.
[1:43:56] Hallelujah. In your soul because of what
[1:43:58] the Lord has done. See what the Lord has
[1:44:01] done.
[1:44:03] Hallelujah. See what the Lord has done.
[1:44:08] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:44:12] Don't worry. Your family will see it.
[1:44:14] Your friends will see it. Your enemies
[1:44:17] will see it. David said he prepares a
[1:44:20] table for me in the presence of my
[1:44:22] enemies. My cup over. Go play nice guy.
[1:44:26] You are enemies. The devil hate you, but
[1:44:29] God love you. Oh, give the Lord some
[1:44:31] praises tonight. Did you hear that?
[1:44:35] Hallelujah. The devil hates you, but God
[1:44:38] loves you. Press on in God. Come into
[1:44:42] obedience of his word. Hallelujah.
[1:44:46] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:44:49] Praise God. Praise God. Let's go.
[1:44:51] Hallelujah.
[1:44:54] Woo. Faith in God is a staggering thing
[1:44:57] to many people. And yet, we ought to be
[1:45:00] ashamed of ourselves to confess that we
[1:45:04] don't have faith in God. All right.
[1:45:05] First time your doctor say something and
[1:45:07] you give up and you're frightened and
[1:45:09] fear fear will push back push push away
[1:45:12] your healing. Faith could help you. Fear
[1:45:15] have nothing. Fear can't help at all. If
[1:45:18] you have an exam in the morning, fear
[1:45:20] can help you. If you have an interview
[1:45:22] for a job in the morning, fear cannot
[1:45:24] help you. But faith can. Oh, glory to
[1:45:27] God. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:45:32] Hallelujah. Somebody somebody going to
[1:45:35] um work and they trusting somebody and
[1:45:38] maybe get somebody a bad drive and they
[1:45:39] going for an interview and when they
[1:45:41] going in the office interview the same
[1:45:46] person same person your bad drive same
[1:45:50] person in the street and you had to sit
[1:45:52] down and the person watching you and you
[1:45:55] watching that person you know you're
[1:45:56] goose
[1:45:59] cook you know you're not getting that
[1:46:02] Hallelujah.
[1:46:04] That why you had to be nice.
[1:46:07] Make let the words come out your mouth
[1:46:09] nice
[1:46:12] cuz sometime sometime you Yeah. Yeah.
[1:46:14] You might eat it back.
[1:46:18] Here we go. We ought to be ashamed
[1:46:20] ourselves to confess we don't have faith
[1:46:22] in
[1:46:23] God. There's cowards who die 10,000
[1:46:26] deaths while they are here on earth and
[1:46:28] hero never dies. His memory lingers on
[1:46:32] for his great heroic deeds. And
[1:46:36] usually people who have faith are people
[1:46:40] who have experience.
[1:46:44] Experience brings faith.
[1:46:48] Hallelujah. Praise God. Jesus gives you
[1:46:52] an experience. Being around where he's
[1:46:54] at, watching his work, then that gives
[1:46:58] you faith. So it come like brother
[1:47:00] Brandham after he preaches and he called
[1:47:03] the prayer line people watching on now
[1:47:06] and a woman she came up on the platform
[1:47:08] in a wheelchair or with crutches rather
[1:47:11] and when she came up to brother Brandham
[1:47:13] her faith was so high that she hand him
[1:47:16] the crutches and walk off the platform
[1:47:19] no prayer necessary hallelujah no prayer
[1:47:22] necessary that's the faith we're talking
[1:47:24] about because she's seeing she is
[1:47:27] hearing she know is God is somebody to
[1:47:30] lift you out of your flesh, out of your
[1:47:32] stinking self, out of your humanistic
[1:47:35] realm, over your rotten mind to raise
[1:47:37] you above. That is what God did to
[1:47:39] Moses. Pillar of fire come down to bless
[1:47:42] Moses and deliver Moses out of his
[1:47:46] senses. He said 5 minutes in the
[1:47:48] presence of the pillar of fire, Moses
[1:47:50] knew more about God than 40 years in
[1:47:52] Egypt. All the education he had, all the
[1:47:55] books and tapes he listened to cancelled
[1:47:58] with five minutes in the prison of
[1:48:00] pillar fire. All what you can't
[1:48:02] overcome. All that giving you a fight.
[1:48:05] Let that pillar of fire come in here
[1:48:07] this morning and all that fight over.
[1:48:10] All that pressure over. Oh, give the
[1:48:12] Lord some praises. Young man, you need
[1:48:14] to encounter God. You need a God
[1:48:16] encounter. You need to meet that pillar
[1:48:18] of fire. The same one that makes his
[1:48:20] neck. Not another one. The same one.
[1:48:22] Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:48:26] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:48:30] [Applause]
[1:48:31] [Music]
[1:48:34] When you have an experience, it gives
[1:48:37] faith. Faith goes by your experience.
[1:48:42] You say my subject is have faith in God.
[1:48:44] Watch. Faith cometh by hearing and
[1:48:47] hearing by the word or the word of God.
[1:48:49] Amen. Now faith is also an experience.
[1:48:55] Oh, you see how part people only talk
[1:48:56] faith come hearing hearing the word and
[1:48:58] preaching the word. But let's go deeper.
[1:49:01] And many times faith is had by a former
[1:49:04] experience make faith grow. So David yes
[1:49:09] could say the bear
[1:49:12] the lion his faith is growing from bear
[1:49:15] to lion. And because I had faith for
[1:49:17] lion, faith for bear, this golad, he
[1:49:20] going to be like one of them.
[1:49:24] Now, if you never had beer and and lion
[1:49:27] and you see Goliath, you know what going
[1:49:29] on. You turn your back and you run in
[1:49:31] the opposite direction because it's a
[1:49:33] giant dealing with.
[1:49:35] Hallelujah. I know the normal spirit is
[1:49:37] a giant you're dealing with. But David
[1:49:39] had experience. Hallelujah. The brothers
[1:49:41] didn't know that. Saul didn't know that.
[1:49:44] The army didn't know that. He said, "You
[1:49:47] shall be like the lion and the bear
[1:49:49] because God delivered
[1:49:51] the lion into my hands." God delivered
[1:49:53] the bear into my hands. God will deliver
[1:49:55] you into my hands. And without a sword,
[1:49:58] that's what faith does. He said, "I'll
[1:50:00] cut your head off. There's a little boy
[1:50:03] with a sling telling a giant with spear
[1:50:07] and shield. I am going to cut your head
[1:50:10] off." And the boy don't even have a
[1:50:12] knife. Give the Lord some praises. That
[1:50:16] is what faith does. Faith prophesies.
[1:50:19] Faith speaks. Faith is bold. Faith
[1:50:23] challenges. Faith don't just sit back
[1:50:25] and relax. Faith does move. Faith does
[1:50:29] act. Give the Lord a shout. Faith is not
[1:50:33] static. Faith is dynamic. Give the Lord
[1:50:36] a sh. And David ran to the Goliath. He
[1:50:40] didn't walk scary and frightened and his
[1:50:44] foot shaken. He ran to meet Goliath. Oh,
[1:50:47] give the Lord some praises.
[1:50:49] [Applause]
[1:50:52] Watch this. Golth, he had been respected
[1:50:55] for a very long time. He big and bad.
[1:50:58] He's big and bold. He said, "Am I a dog?
[1:51:01] You have no respect. Young man, I'll
[1:51:04] feed the birds." And that's what the
[1:51:05] devil trying to tell some of you inside
[1:51:06] of here that you are bird feed. You
[1:51:09] ain't no bird feeder. He said, "I'll cut
[1:51:11] your head off." Hallelujah. Young man,
[1:51:13] you are an embarrassment. You see how
[1:51:16] big I am. You see how bad I am. You see
[1:51:19] how bold I am. That man might be cancer.
[1:51:22] That man might be a tumor. That Goliath
[1:51:25] might be some kind of sickness in your
[1:51:27] body, in your home, in your marriage, in
[1:51:29] your
[1:51:30] life. Come on, give the Lord a shout in
[1:51:32] the
[1:51:35] house. Glory.
[1:51:39] [Music]
[1:51:39] [Applause]
[1:51:47] Before David make that move, his brother
[1:51:50] said to ask him, "What about the sheep
[1:51:51] back home in front of everybody?" Yeah.
[1:51:53] Not come say that shame him that
[1:51:57] embarrass him. If David take that shame,
[1:51:59] he couldn't do the faith. have the faith
[1:52:01] in him because all the obstacles and
[1:52:03] hindrances and if you haven't heard that
[1:52:04] message go back and listen to hindrances
[1:52:06] on Wednesday night all the hindrances is
[1:52:08] to affect your faith is to out your
[1:52:10] light you understand that the Bible says
[1:52:13] you don't take a light and put it on the
[1:52:14] bushell you don't take a light and hide
[1:52:16] it know the purpose of light you put the
[1:52:19] light in a place where to give light to
[1:52:21] others so God want to light you up and
[1:52:23] then hide you so why you trying to be
[1:52:25] hiding in your flesh you in your
[1:52:26] stinking rotten flesh God want to put
[1:52:29] you on Stop others see they want to be
[1:52:31] like you. They want to walk like you.
[1:52:33] They want to talk like you. They want to
[1:52:35] live like you. God want you to be a
[1:52:38] light. What did he say? Let man see your
[1:52:40] good works. Oh, give the Lord some
[1:52:42] shame. Give the Lord a shout in the
[1:52:45] house. Hallelujah. When they see your
[1:52:48] good works, they could glorify your
[1:52:50] father in heaven. Not your good talk,

[1:52:54] explanation. No, no, no. Not that. Where

[1:56:19] to version 10:11, we are still here
[1:56:21] prophesying, prophesying because we went
[1:56:24] to the angel and we took the book. We
[1:56:26] had an experience. Therefore, we are
[1:56:28] faith this morning to preach what we
[1:56:30] preach and to say what we say because we
[1:56:33] met that angel. And that angel give us
[1:56:35] the authority. And now we are anointed.
[1:56:38] Now we are commissioned to bring a
[1:56:40] revival. Oh, give the Lord a shout to
[1:56:42] start a revival. He said what we see
[1:56:45] should make a church that going to make

[1:57:27] and people smiling already start to
[1:57:30] rejoice already. Oh good Lord. I
[1:57:32] wouldn't go down there. If I only start
[1:57:33] with the dessert and everything else I I

[1:58:25] us into godship. To bring us into
[1:58:27] inheritance. To bring us into adoption.

[1:58:48] to help you to learn how to fight. The
[1:58:50] good fight of faith. You have to fight,
[1:58:52] you know, but you have to know how to
[1:58:53] fight. You can't be swinging, swinging,
[1:58:55] swinging, swinging, and there's nobody
[1:58:57] there where you're fighting. Oh, give
[1:58:58] the Lord a shout in the house. You have
[1:59:00] to know how to fight. Hallelujah.
[1:59:03] Fighting the fight of faith. It's a good
[1:59:05] faith. It's a great faith. Oh, it's a
[1:59:08] wonderful faith. Oh, I win like nothing
[1:59:10] else in the world. Hallelujah. Praise
[1:59:12] God. Let's go.
[1:59:16] So a former experience makes faith grow.
[1:59:19] The growth of faith. Hallelujah. Faith
[1:59:22] getting ripe. Hallelujah. Or the
[1:59:24] maturity of faith. So not just faith
[1:59:27] have faith. Faith could grow. Faith
[1:59:30] could ripe. Faith could mature. The man
[1:59:33] who stood and watched Jesus cast out
[1:59:36] devils and heal that centurion man when
[1:59:38] he caught it, it's like a revelation
[1:59:41] break on him. All right. He say I am a
[1:59:43] man under authority.
[1:59:45] That's a nice revelation. He didn't say
[1:59:47] he had authority.
[1:59:50] He was under authority. So to have
[1:59:52] authority, you have to be under
[1:59:55] authority. He said I say to one go and
[1:59:58] he goeth. Because he knew he was
[2:00:00] authorized by the state to be in that
[2:00:02] position. Like a policeman. A policeman
[2:00:04] do a power in himself. He's authorized
[2:00:06] by the state to lock up people. We are
[2:00:09] not police. I can't go with a a padlock
[2:00:12] and just lock up people the police would
[2:00:14] lock me up
[2:00:16] for impersonal what they do because I am
[2:00:19] not authorized but the police have
[2:00:22] authorization so this man recognized
[2:00:24] Jesus have authorization over devils
[2:00:26] over sickness over disease and Jesus
[2:00:28] don't have to lay hands he said just
[2:00:30] speak the word only and my servant shall
[2:00:32] be healed that's gentile faith that's
[2:00:35] gentile warrior faith just speak and my
[2:00:37] servant shall be healed
[2:00:39] And the servant was healed. That's his
[2:00:41] faith speaking. Jesus marveled. He said
[2:00:44] in Israel, I never see faith like that.
[2:00:47] Oh God, bring back that kind of faith.
[2:00:49] Bring back that old time faith. Oh,
[2:00:51] glory to God. Remember about the black
[2:00:52] man talk about the testimony. He had no
[2:00:54] money to go service. Oh, glory to God.
[2:00:56] That's a powerful testimony. No money to
[2:00:58] go service. Them days were tough days.
[2:01:00] Had no for the car and whatnot. But yet
[2:01:02] he still no money. I no money. He
[2:01:04] dressed. All right. And went by the bus
[2:01:05] stop. Yes, sir. That is faith. Amen.
[2:01:07] That is faith. You have no money for the
[2:01:10] bus, no money to go service, but you're
[2:01:12] still dressed and you stand by the bus
[2:01:14] stop and you're waiting. The bus not
[2:01:16] taking you free. When the bus stop,
[2:01:19] somebody say, "I'll pay for you." Oh,
[2:01:21] give the Lord a shout in the house. Give
[2:01:23] the Lord a shout in the house. Come on
[2:01:26] in. I'll pay for you. That's the kind of
[2:01:29] faith we're talking about. That was a
[2:01:31] living faith. Oh, glory to God.
[2:01:35] Hallelujah.
[2:01:37] Hallelujah. I see brothers. Hallelujah.
[2:01:39] Lay hands on the tires. Tires we call
[2:01:42] smooth like pawn face. No spear.
[2:01:46] Hallelujah. If you see the tires, they
[2:01:47] get frightened. All right. Those tires
[2:01:49] are illegal. But faith. They go in
[2:01:52] service, you know.
[2:01:56] Hallelujah. And bre in those days wasn't
[2:01:58] driving the car, you know. Now people
[2:01:59] driving the cold breeze, driving by
[2:02:01] coming to service.
[2:02:03] In those days come in one coming in two
[2:02:06] in three four five six they coming in
[2:02:09] you don't even know they fit inside of
[2:02:10] there but they coming in because
[2:02:13] transportation was limited in that day
[2:02:17] that was fate.
[2:02:19] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:02:21] Oh my my my my
[2:02:27] I remember going up. Hallelujah.
[2:02:30] When I reach up there and about three
[2:02:31] people in
[2:02:33] service we had max about 10 by George
[2:02:35] about 10 but George asked me he say why
[2:02:39] you leaving quite
[2:02:42] bel why you see I say when you repent go
[2:02:45] forgive
[2:02:47] you I was studying three persons it was
[2:02:51] fate
[2:02:53] right amongst that 10 people is when the
[2:02:56] vision broke about the second coming of
[2:02:58] the Lord and how I went into brotherly
[2:03:00] kindness. It was in Kaiwal and that open
[2:03:04] up a door and I see it clearly without
[2:03:07] forgiveness. How do you go into Holy
[2:03:09] Spirit? How do you go into love of God
[2:03:13] when the prophet says he give you a new
[2:03:15] spirit that you could work with the Holy
[2:03:17] Spirit? How could we work with God's
[2:03:19] love when we don't even know how to
[2:03:20] forgive? They still have a from 15 years
[2:03:22] ago or 100 years ago. It's another like
[2:03:25] we said the grandmother and the
[2:03:26] grandchildren said granny why why we
[2:03:28] don't talk to them people again she say
[2:03:30] so long I can't remember

[2:05:02] breakthrough. Dig and get victory. Don't
[2:05:05] just take things for granted. Press on.
[2:05:09] We must
[2:05:11] work till Jesus come. We work.
[2:05:15] [Applause]
[2:05:17] That song was ringing in my head this
[2:05:18] morning. We will work till Jesus come.
[2:05:20] Begin his work.
[2:05:22] Faith is work. Amen. Abraham sting.
[2:05:25] Listen, Abraham checking the doctor.
[2:05:26] There's a harassing thing you know. Yes.
[2:05:27] He felt le to by the doctor just to get
[2:05:29] out of here. Now after two visit the
[2:05:31] doctor call the man money. There's one
[2:05:32] thing you know. But when the doctor see
[2:05:34] no hope for this man and the man still
[2:05:36] coming.
[2:05:38] Hallelujah. Amen.

[2:05:48] Same same condition same old man same
[2:05:53] wife can't make no baby same after 25
[2:05:57] years Abraham same but he was not the
[2:06:00] same his faith was going stronger
[2:06:04] because his praises was getting
[2:06:06] more God was seeing his faith man was
[2:06:10] seeing Abraham
[2:06:12] billing
[2:06:14] crib Abraham getting thing to shake
[2:06:17] Hallelujah. His works was expressed by
[2:06:19] that. Hallelujah. What is your works
[2:06:23] expressing? Hallelujah. How you going?
[2:06:26] So, so
[2:06:29] you know, if God was allowing licks to
[2:06:34] share for these kind of testimonies, you
[2:06:37] got plenty licks here.
[2:06:41] Because the Bible teach us how to speak.
[2:06:43] The Bible say let the weak say I am
[2:06:46] strong. The expression I am strong is
[2:06:49] the confidence you have in God to give
[2:06:50] you strength.
[2:06:55] When Pharaoh was coming and the people
[2:06:57] come out all that journey, they didn't
[2:06:58] say, "Oh God, the God had brought us up.
[2:07:00] Hallelujah. He could take us through."
[2:07:01] They wasn't talking that journal. It had
[2:07:03] voices in the congregation saying,
[2:07:04] "Let's go back." Hallelujah. Giants and
[2:07:07] champions and the boys them wanted to go
[2:07:09] back. But watch this. Moses fell back
[2:07:13] into the humanistic realm. Gone behind a
[2:07:15] rock and prayed, "Oh God, help me Jesus.
[2:07:18] Oh God, Pharaoh." Now he had a
[2:07:20] commission to bring them to the
[2:07:22] mountain, Red Sea in front of them,
[2:07:24] mountain on both sides. Fear is coming
[2:07:27] and he is crying. He is crying in his
[2:07:29] flesh. He is crying in his emotion. He's
[2:07:32] emotional because he doesn't know what
[2:07:34] to do.
[2:07:36] You know what God did? Okay, Moses, my
[2:07:39] son, I know what you're going
[2:07:42] through. No, there's some brother or
[2:07:45] sister talking to you. God talking to
[2:07:46] you. God say, "Why cry unto me?"
[2:07:55] I hear some brothers say amen there, but
[2:07:57] I hear I hear a strong brothers there.
[2:07:58] But them sisters quiet there. But I hear
[2:08:00] a road. He said,
[2:08:02] "Why? Cry unto me. Speak and move
[2:08:05] forward."
[2:08:07] You see, God hands is Moses hands.
[2:08:13] God's feet is Moses' feet.
[2:08:16] God cannot operate outside a man.
[2:08:19] [Applause]
[2:08:20] Moses is God's agent.
[2:08:23] For God to work, Moses to act a certain
[2:08:25] way. He cannot stumble and fumble. He
[2:08:29] said, "Why crying to me?" That's a
[2:08:30] humanistic realm. Get out of that. Get
[2:08:33] out your emotions. Get out your
[2:08:35] feelings, speak and move forward. Move
[2:08:38] this step forward. The Egyptians you see
[2:08:40] today, you shall see them no more
[2:08:42] forever. The Lord shall fight for you.
[2:08:45] Oh,
[2:08:47] glory. Give the Lord a
[2:08:50] shout. Give the Lord a praise. Give the
[2:08:53] Lord a shout in the
[2:08:55] house. That man stood, spoke,
[2:09:02] [Applause]
[2:09:02] [Music]
[2:09:05] stretch his rod towards the water and
[2:09:07] when he touched the water it open up.
[2:09:10] Woo! How you was going to feel? Oh, how
[2:09:14] if you were there, how was you going to
[2:09:16] feel? My God, I have the words. You can
[2:09:18] see them watching the mountain, the
[2:09:20] water on both sides going up, see fish,
[2:09:23] whale, all kind of things on both sides
[2:09:25] and you on dry ground. My God and you're
[2:09:28] singing the song of Moses and you're
[2:09:30] rejoicing. Now you're feeling the party.
[2:09:33] That is time to party. That is time to
[2:09:35] shout and rejoice because God has
[2:09:37] delivered you from the hands of the
[2:09:39] Egyptians. God has delivered you from
[2:09:42] Pharaoh and his army and his forces. Oh,
[2:09:44] give the Lord some praises.
[2:09:50] Faith.
[2:09:52] Faith. The action of faith. The life of
[2:09:56] faith. And here the costume
[2:10:03] till fire blocking Pharaoh and his army.
[2:10:06] You can imagine the bunch the last bunch
[2:10:08] across. Yes. They reach the top yet. And
[2:10:11] then Pharaoh feeling led. Hallelujah. He
[2:10:14] see a highway made and he feel led to go
[2:10:16] on the highway. He said go after them
[2:10:19] build that.
[2:10:21] Don't go and watch what you do building.
[2:10:23] God made that way for them. They go in
[2:10:24] they come
[2:10:27] in sister ny nice she at the end. When
[2:10:31] sister nice look back and see them. I
[2:10:33] hope nobody nice here. When she look
[2:10:35] back and see them you talk about
[2:10:38] ball. You know how to be emotional. You
[2:10:40] talk about scream. Oh god. He coming.
[2:10:43] Look how God bring you all the way out
[2:10:45] of Egypt. Open up Red Sea. And when you
[2:10:47] see them child coming now like a fresh
[2:10:50] ball and a fresh Lord. Hallelujah. We go
[2:10:52] dead. Hallelujah.
[2:10:56] Praise God. Jesus.
[2:10:59] When sister come up, I want a problem
[2:11:03] with nice.
[2:11:05] Hallelujah. God closed the water up. My
[2:11:08] God. And that is when Miriam get the
[2:11:10] tambourine and Miriam started to dance.
[2:11:12] Guys, when they could hold her
[2:11:14] back. Permission please to dance. No,
[2:11:17] no, no. M permission please to dance.
[2:11:18] Tambourine time. Dancing time. Shouting
[2:11:22] time. You see all your sins drunk. You
[2:11:25] see your enemy drunk. You see your
[2:11:27] pharaoh drunk. You see all binding you
[2:11:29] drunk. You see it floating. The dead.
[2:11:33] The sin that had you bound dead. The
[2:11:36] spirit that had you b dead. Oh, give the
[2:11:39] Lord. Give the Lord a shout.
[2:11:43] So you tell me I can't shout and
[2:11:46] dance. He had blood.
[2:11:50] He had made me
[2:11:52] glad. Oh
[2:11:57] glory. Hallelujah. So your praises, your
[2:12:01] praises and worship is evidence of faith
[2:12:04] in your soul. Notice notice when
[2:12:07] somebody in sin it's hard to praise God
[2:12:08] and worship. When somebody in unbelief
[2:12:10] is battered and what not is hard, you
[2:12:13] have to be released from your condition.
[2:12:15] Then you have the liberty. The woman
[2:12:17] with a the woman at a well when she has
[2:12:19] free her, she dropped a water pot and
[2:12:21] ran. If she was in a sense, she never
[2:12:23] ran. She was a somebody was dressed to
[2:12:25] buy to walk to get somebody impression,
[2:12:27] but she ran in the same clothes and
[2:12:28] said, "Come see a man." Somebody said
[2:12:30] another man, he said, "No, no, no, not
[2:12:31] not one of them." Hallelujah. A
[2:12:33] different one. A perfect one. A one that
[2:12:35] free meal. One that anointed me. Why not
[2:12:38] let me know who I am and I can live
[2:12:40] harder than that. Something ought to
[2:12:42] strike you that you can live harder than
[2:12:44] that. Give the Lord a shout. God live
[2:12:48] God called you to be little Lord and
[2:12:49] angels, not above the animals. Give the
[2:12:52] Lord some
[2:12:53] [Applause]
[2:13:02] praises. Faith is a substance of things
[2:13:06] fall. the evidence of things not seen.
[2:13:09] So many people fail to find the real
[2:13:11] meaning of what faith is. Some people
[2:13:14] believe that faith is some sensation or
[2:13:16] some emotion. But the Bible says faith
[2:13:19] is a substance of things hoped for. Some
[2:13:22] things is a mental conception of the
[2:13:24] word that is not right. Faith is a
[2:13:27] substance. Faith is not a myth. Faith is
[2:13:30] a substance of things hoped for. It is
[2:13:33] not something you imagine in your mind.
[2:13:35] It is something that you absolutely you
[2:13:37] have.
[2:13:41] Hallelujah.
[2:13:43] Lord,
[2:13:44] if I see people in the bank line,
[2:13:46] Hallelujah.
[2:13:48] And I could still walk inside the
[2:13:49] building,
[2:13:51] because I believe something could work
[2:13:53] out. I didn't know the how it was going
[2:13:56] to work out. And how fast it was going
[2:13:58] to work out. Understand? It's two lines
[2:14:01] plus a third sideline waiting to get
[2:14:03] into them two lines. Hallelujah. And I
[2:14:05] bypass all of that. All right. Straight
[2:14:06] to the machine. Get the money and get
[2:14:08] back out. Faith.
[2:14:11] That's how we live. That's how we walk.
[2:14:14] That's how we talk. Hallelujah. I
[2:14:17] believe God is a way maker. But you have
[2:14:20] to give him a chance to make a way. When
[2:14:23] you trying to bust away yourself, he
[2:14:24] can't make no way. But you have to show
[2:14:26] and make a way for he to demonstrate to
[2:14:29] you he's a way maker. He's a provider.
[2:14:31] Oh, glory to God. You believe that?
[2:14:33] Hear this.
[2:14:36] Faith is not something you imagine in
[2:14:38] your mind. And don't tell me you had the
[2:14:40] Holy Ghost to do our faith. When did
[2:14:41] Aban get the Holy Ghost? The Holy Ghost
[2:14:44] circumcision come as a confirmation of
[2:14:46] his faith.
[2:14:48] Where's the amens on that one? In other
[2:14:50] words, before he get the experience of
[2:14:53] circumcision, he had faith demonstrated.
[2:14:58] So once faith step forward, experience
[2:15:00] come behind that.
[2:15:01] Action come behind that. Works come
[2:15:04] behind that. Oh, give the Lord a sh
[2:15:06] praise in the house. Watch. Get this
[2:15:08] part. I want to get to this. Yeah. It is
[2:15:10] not something that you imagine in your
[2:15:12] mind. It is something that you
[2:15:14] absolutely you have. It is something you
[2:15:18] possess in your own being.
[2:15:21] I am conscious of the faith that God
[2:15:23] have that have inside of me. It's a
[2:15:26] consciousness inside of me. The faith
[2:15:28] inside of me. The devil can't take that
[2:15:30] out. He got to make not dear. It is
[2:15:33] something that you possess. It's
[2:15:34] something that you have. God put that in
[2:15:36] you before the foundation of the world.
[2:15:38] That is why you could react to the word
[2:15:40] is something inside. You are not the
[2:15:42] believer.
[2:15:44] The word in you is a believer.
[2:15:47] [Applause]
[2:15:49] God's faith in you believe in his own
[2:15:51] word.
[2:15:53] What says is something you possess in
[2:15:56] your own being.
[2:15:58] Okay. Let me just run through this
[2:15:59] quickly, but I want to talk about Moses
[2:16:01] right in the burning bush. He come to
[2:16:03] find out the angel of the Lord was in
[2:16:04] this bush. Moses had been a bitter
[2:16:06] failure yet knowing that God was going
[2:16:08] to deliver the children of Israel by him
[2:16:10] trying to do it within himself 40 years
[2:16:14] before that and become a failure. Get
[2:16:17] this. And lost all the vision of victory
[2:16:21] and freedom for the people
[2:16:23] enslaved. Moses was a bitter failure. We
[2:16:26] see his attention to the burning bush.
[2:16:29] Fire usually brings an attraction.
[2:16:32] Usually the Holy Spirit when it comes in
[2:16:33] a manner of fire attracts attention to
[2:16:35] people. God spoke to him. Here we go. A
[2:16:40] fresh vision by an angel.
[2:16:42] Watch faith take a hold right quick. Are
[2:16:46] you going with me? Don't Don't sleep
[2:16:48] now. Don't feed on me now. Just listen.
[2:16:51] Watch faith take a hold right quick. The
[2:16:53] old things pass away. But Moses now has
[2:16:57] a new vision. He has a revelation. He
[2:17:01] has an experience. He had met God.
[2:17:04] Notice how those words are placed. Moses
[2:17:07] had a new vision. He had a revelation.
[2:17:10] He had an experience. He had met God. He
[2:17:14] had talked to God. Before that, he had
[2:17:17] not met God. He only read and knowed
[2:17:20] what his mother had told him by hearing
[2:17:23] what his mother had said or by hearing
[2:17:25] what the pastor had said. But now Moses
[2:17:28] had a personal
[2:17:31] experience. Could I shout in the house?
[2:17:34] Isn't that the problem today? People sit
[2:17:37] on me churches hearing what the pastor
[2:17:39] said. Never have a personal experience.
[2:17:42] You have to have a personal experience.
[2:17:44] Not your father for you, not your mother
[2:17:46] for you, not your wife for you, not your
[2:17:48] husband for you. You have to have a
[2:17:51] personal experience. Thank God. Do I
[2:17:54] hear a shout in the house?
[2:18:00] Your mother, father, brother, husband,
[2:18:02] wife experience cannot work for you.
[2:18:04] Glor.
[2:18:06] He said, "That's what the church needs
[2:18:07] tonight is just stop studying so much
[2:18:09] theology and get down to the altar and
[2:18:13] pray until a personal experience burn
[2:18:16] down in a human heart." Oh, glory to
[2:18:18] God. And burns out the dullness and
[2:18:21] gives a new vision. How many you agree
[2:18:23] with that this morning? Well, open your
[2:18:25] mouth and say, "Amen." You know, you're
[2:18:28] dull. You want a fresh vision. You want
[2:18:31] a renewal. I wanted.
[2:18:35] [Music]
[2:18:36] Here we go. Moses now was experienced.
[2:18:40] He had witnessed the power of the Lord
[2:18:42] God. He had witnessed it in both divine
[2:18:44] healing. His hand was split with leprosy
[2:18:46] and then he put it back in his bosom,
[2:18:48] pull it out, and was healed. So, he knew
[2:18:49] God was a healer. So, God gave him a
[2:18:52] direct witness of his glory and power.
[2:18:54] And that's what we need. That's what you
[2:18:56] need, a witness of God's power and
[2:18:59] presence. And when you get that, nobody
[2:19:01] can take that out of you. No devil could
[2:19:03] talk that out of you. Oh, give the Lord
[2:19:05] some praises. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He
[2:19:09] said that's the way the Holy Spirit
[2:19:10] would come on the apostle who said such
[2:19:12] as I have. That's what we need tonight.
[2:19:14] A personal experience with God. Moses
[2:19:17] got the personal experience. Now watch
[2:19:19] faith jumping. Watch the difference in
[2:19:21] Moses. Now away he goes to Egypt. A
[2:19:24] oneman invasion going to take over.
[2:19:26] Nothing but a dry stick. He went down to
[2:19:29] do it and accomplish what God told him
[2:19:31] because he had a fresh vision from God.
[2:19:34] And if anything the church needs
[2:19:36] tonight, what we are trying to do,
[2:19:38] friends, is to bring a fresh vision from
[2:19:40] the presence of God to let the people
[2:19:42] see that God still lives and reign and
[2:19:45] moving in his church. Oh, give the Lord
[2:19:47] a praise in the house. Hallelujah.
[2:19:51] And then brother Bam said this in the
[2:19:54] days of our Lord before he left the
[2:19:55] earth. Acts 18 he said tar the se of
[2:19:58] Jerusalem until they do power from high.
[2:20:01] Isn't that right? Acts 18 says you shall
[2:20:03] receive power after it has come upon
[2:20:05] you. There was a little bunch of
[2:20:06] cowardly people in an upper room and the
[2:20:10] doors locked because they were afraid of
[2:20:12] the threats of the Jews. And all of a
[2:20:14] sudden there come a song from heaven
[2:20:15] like a rushing mighty wind fill all the
[2:20:17] house where they were sitting. And they
[2:20:19] were afraid a few minutes before that.
[2:20:21] But here they were all out in the street
[2:20:23] magnifying and glorifying God. A few
[2:20:26] minutes ago they were afraid. When that
[2:20:28] Holy Ghost come upon them, all fear
[2:20:29] gone. They're fearless now. They on the
[2:20:32] streets. You know what? They had an
[2:20:34] experience that set them a fire that
[2:20:37] could burn the whole world in that day.
[2:20:39] They had an experience. Experience a
[2:20:42] company's faith. They heard a word from
[2:20:44] Jesus. They obeyed Jesus word. They were
[2:20:47] in the upper room. They had faith to
[2:20:49] believe it will come. And when that
[2:20:51] experience came, they changed them all
[2:20:53] together. It will change you. It will
[2:20:56] change this church. It will change the
[2:20:57] ministry. It will change the elders. It
[2:21:00] will change the deacons. It will change
[2:21:01] every person in the church.
[2:21:09] Can we take some more?
[2:21:11] Listen to this. Hallelujah. Can't stop
[2:21:13] now. Middle of the runway. Faith is so
[2:21:16] simple. Faith is a substance things
[2:21:18] won't fall. Faith is not a miss. It's
[2:21:21] something you actually possess. If I was
[2:21:23] starving and you come to me and said,
[2:21:25] "I'm starving." And they say, "What
[2:21:27] would save your life?" I'd say, "A loaf
[2:21:29] of bread." And you go into your pocket
[2:21:31] and bring out 25 cents and hand it to me
[2:21:34] and say, "Here you are, Mr. Brandom. You
[2:21:36] don't have to starve. I haven't got the
[2:21:38] bread yet. But I have the purchase power
[2:21:42] of the bread. I may be a mile from the
[2:21:44] bread. I could just be as happy with the
[2:21:47] quarter in my hand as if I have the
[2:21:49] bread. You ain't smell it yet. You ain't
[2:21:52] eat it yet. You ain't taste it yet. But
[2:21:54] you have the power to purchase it. You
[2:21:57] have to get up the road. The bakery is
[2:21:59] up the road. That is where you get the
[2:22:01] bread in the bakery. You're walking.
[2:22:04] You're hungry, but you're rejoicing
[2:22:06] because you have the money to buy the
[2:22:08] bread. Well, faith is the currency this
[2:22:11] morning for dynamics, for the Holy
[2:22:13] Ghost, for revival. We can rejoice this
[2:22:16] morning. We can shout this morning. We
[2:22:19] can dance this morning because faith is
[2:22:21] here believing what God promised. Oh,
[2:22:24] glory to God. And the Bible said the
[2:22:27] Lord himself went everywhere with him,
[2:22:31] confirming the word with signs
[2:22:33] following. Oh, give the Lord some
[2:22:35] praises. Could you imagine the Lord
[2:22:37] everywhere we go, the Lord going with
[2:22:40] us, these signs shall follow, not you
[2:22:44] follow signs. These signs when you look
[2:22:46] back, signs following you. Wherever you
[2:22:49] go, there's signs. There are wonders,
[2:22:52] there are miracles. You're going to
[2:22:54] check grandma, you're going to check
[2:22:56] grandpa, you're going to check your
[2:22:58] friend and family, and these signs shall
[2:23:00] follow. Somebody sick in the family, you
[2:23:03] know, you could pray. your prayer before
[2:23:06] you can pray again. You know God going
[2:23:08] to heal because God is a healer. He
[2:23:11] wants somebody he could use. He want
[2:23:13] your hands. He wants your feet. He want
[2:23:16] your hands to lay on others. Give the
[2:23:18] Lord some praises
[2:23:19] [Applause]
[2:23:25] tonight. Amen. Brother
[2:23:28] Joel. When faith is anchored, it is
[2:23:31] finished. You are just as happy as if
[2:23:34] you're already jumping and shouting
[2:23:36] because it's all over now. When I got
[2:23:38] the bread, this 25 cents, I may have to
[2:23:40] go over some hills by a patch through
[2:23:42] water, cross bridges, but I'm rejoicing
[2:23:45] because I have 25 cents knowing I'm
[2:23:48] going to get the bread as soon as I get
[2:23:50] there. It's the purching power. Hear the
[2:23:52] bomb. Now, the most people have faith,
[2:23:55] but they don't try to use what faith
[2:23:57] they got.
[2:23:59] Hallelujah. Amen. You see when brother
[2:24:02] black man stand up there by the bus stop
[2:24:05] that's some people rain falling
[2:24:08] cargo services rain fall
[2:24:12] say the lazy man they say you have a
[2:24:13] land you street let me go and turn and
[2:24:15] sleep
[2:24:19] a man with faith even if you don't have
[2:24:21] a land street by time you get up in the
[2:24:22] morning the land gone
[2:24:26] the lazy man he don't want to go come on
[2:24:28] the bed you know because you know mother
[2:24:30] and father give him Good.
[2:24:32] Let them eat. My Jesus. Hallelujah. Run
[2:24:35] them out to get work.
[2:24:37] Jesus.
[2:24:39] Lord. Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:24:44] Most people have faith, but they don't
[2:24:47] try to use what faith they got. Lord,
[2:24:51] you said, I believe that every person
[2:24:52] that believes on the Lord Jesus has to
[2:24:54] have a certain amount of faith. But the
[2:24:56] reason it's never used too much is
[2:24:59] because you never put it to use very
[2:25:03] much. A person usually come to church,
[2:25:06] will just come in, listen to the sermon,
[2:25:08] they'll go up, put their name on the
[2:25:09] church book, become a good church
[2:25:11] member. That's just as far as they have
[2:25:13] to use their faith. But faith will do
[2:25:17] anything that you have need of being
[2:25:19] done if you will put it to work.
[2:25:24] So faith have to go to work then. Yes.
[2:25:28] Yes. Say yes to that. Your faith this
[2:25:31] morning have to go to work. Not sleep.
[2:25:34] Not rest. Go to work. Work for your
[2:25:38] children. Work for your house. Work for
[2:25:40] your family. Work for your life. We have
[2:25:44] not because we ask not. Give the Lord a
[2:25:47] shout in the
[2:25:49] house. To get you have to ask. But you
[2:25:52] have to ask in faith, not ask brethren.
[2:25:58] That's not my word. That's the Bible.
[2:26:00] You have not because you ask not. You
[2:26:03] don't have joy because you asked for it.
[2:26:09] Hallelujah. So whatever you have right
[2:26:10] now, keep it. Don't let the devil steal
[2:26:12] it and ask for more of it. Say, Lord is
[2:26:15] feeling good. I want some more of that.
[2:26:17] How I feel this morning, I want some
[2:26:19] more of that. I want it in my job. I
[2:26:21] want it in my house. When I'm bing, I
[2:26:24] want it. When I go to the supermarket, I
[2:26:25] want it wherever I go. I want that.
[2:26:28] [Applause]
[2:26:33] You're asking too small. Yes, sir.
[2:26:35] You're asking too little. He says like a
[2:26:37] mouse in Egypt. All them bands with all
[2:26:40] them corn and a mouse saying you think
[2:26:42] you going to run out. I only eating two
[2:26:45] this morning.
[2:26:48] Two green this morning. I take it two by
[2:26:50] two. And some people content with that
[2:26:52] you know their faith so weak so small
[2:26:56] that why I like Elisha he say I want to
[2:26:59] be like you Elisha you know Elijah know
[2:27:01] what we want it's a double portion
[2:27:07] Elijah say ask a hard thing you know I
[2:27:10] like that thing you're
[2:27:11] asking my brother only asked for this
[2:27:14] that's he he asked for one acre but you
[2:27:16] ask for 100 acres if his faith only
[2:27:19] could handle one acre and you could
[2:27:21] handle 50 acres. Take your 50 acres and
[2:27:22] go with it. Nobody stop asking for 50
[2:27:25] acres. If you can manage that, you want
[2:27:27] that you can manage. Whatever God give,
[2:27:30] you want to be able to manage
[2:27:30] effectively. That man with that one
[2:27:33] money and he bury it. Wicked servant.
[2:27:36] Why didn't he put it in the bank? He
[2:27:38] think he did a good thing. He was
[2:27:39] pleasing.
[2:27:41] Master, he give me this here and look. I
[2:27:43] bury it. I save it. I keep it. I
[2:27:45] preserve it. You know what I give you
[2:27:47] that for? For preservation. I give it a
[2:27:50] multiply for multiplication now. Now
[2:27:53] because of inflation now this thing less
[2:27:55] than where it really is because by that
[2:27:57] time price is going up. Why put my money
[2:27:59] in bank to get some interest on it?
[2:28:02] Wicked servant.
[2:28:05] So you preserving yourself and
[2:28:06] preserving your life. Wickedness.
[2:28:08] Hallelujah. God want to bless you so
[2:28:10] much your cup must run over.
[2:28:12] But some of you so selfish you can't get
[2:28:14] a cup full cuz you're fighting somebody
[2:28:16] by look inside your cup. Amen. You don't
[2:28:18] want to share your cup. Amen.
[2:28:20] Hallelujah. You want to open your pipe
[2:28:22] and when you do open your pipe pipe
[2:28:23] rusty water come in so long that pipe
[2:28:25] open because the more you give the more
[2:28:27] you get to know. God, you see once God
[2:28:30] find a channel, he will flow through it.
[2:28:33] That's why they say you must give a
[2:28:35] giver.
[2:28:37] You never hear it before, right? It's a
[2:28:39] new one. You must give a giver because a
[2:28:41] giver will give. When you give a stingy
[2:28:43] person, they keep it right.
[2:28:46] All the blessing lock off right there.
[2:28:47] So because it's me, I and myself and my
[2:28:50] own. But when you give a giver, a giver
[2:28:52] will keep on giving. Hallelujah. That's
[2:28:54] what God want to use you as a channel to
[2:28:57] effectively reach others, free others,
[2:29:00] deliver others. So watch faith will just
[2:29:03] do anything you have need of being done
[2:29:06] if you'll put it to work. But most
[2:29:08] churches today, that's as far as they
[2:29:10] teach. Just teach Jesus by faith and
[2:29:13] that settle it. That's like a man that's
[2:29:14] eating a slice of watermelon. That was
[2:29:16] good, but there was some more of it
[2:29:17] somewhere. So that's the way it is.
[2:29:19] Accept Christ, but there's more of it.
[2:29:21] Now, lo, I now don't go in a place where
[2:29:24] you just I I wonder if it will work.
[2:29:26] Just the same as you know, you're going
[2:29:28] to get a drink of water, you're going to
[2:29:29] raise up and walk across the floor.
[2:29:31] That's how simple to be about it. The
[2:29:33] Lord promise it, settles it. That's
[2:29:35] genuine faith. Now if people if the
[2:29:38] church here we go would put more faith
[2:29:41] to work hear this chance you would see
[2:29:44] more things take place in the church the
[2:29:48] pastor might stand on Sunday morning he
[2:29:50] might stand on Sunday evening whenever
[2:29:51] and preach hard on faith in a mighty
[2:29:53] message but if the members don't take
[2:29:56] that message and then start putting the
[2:29:58] work it will fall right back and the
[2:30:01] birds of the air will pick it up
[2:30:04] amen Amen. Amen. So, we have birds
[2:30:07] outside right now. Amen. And we
[2:30:09] literally have some birds outside. I'm
[2:30:11] not talking about those birds. Amen.
[2:30:13] That you see on the fence and thing. I'm
[2:30:15] not talking about those birds. We're
[2:30:17] talking about the bird Satan that has
[2:30:19] take things on people when they don't
[2:30:21] understand and grasp it. So, when you
[2:30:23] leave here today, I want you to take
[2:30:25] what faith inside of you and begin to
[2:30:26] act on it. Do something about it. You
[2:30:30] know, if you don't do that's an action
[2:30:33] you choose not to do.
[2:30:34] And you will fail by not doing. And
[2:30:37] don't go like some people they afraid to
[2:30:39] fail. So they no longer trying. They
[2:30:41] don't want to embarrass and whatn not.
[2:30:42] No. Go forward in action. If you fail,
[2:30:45] you fail. You you learn from your
[2:30:47] failures. You fall. You get back up. But
[2:30:48] you learn along the way. But don't say
[2:30:50] you're not trying. Try. Press. Cut your
[2:30:54] way through. I love decisions. Decisions
[2:30:56] have fruit with it. The fruit is the
[2:30:58] results of decision. When you don't make
[2:30:59] a decision, you make a decision not to
[2:31:01] make a decision. Hallelujah. But when
[2:31:03] you make a decision right or wrong, you
[2:31:05] see the fruit of it and you know
[2:31:06] sometime how God guiding you and leading
[2:31:08] you by your decisions. I see people make
[2:31:10] wrong decisions and they pay for those
[2:31:12] decisions that they make. Oh, praise the
[2:31:13] name of the Lord. Praise God. Faith.
[2:31:16] Here we go. This is deep. Always an
[2:31:19] experience accompanies fate. And how
[2:31:23] could it be tonight? I'd say to you
[2:31:24] women here, you got a little canary
[2:31:26] bird. You love pets. What good would it
[2:31:29] do to give them vitamins and seed and
[2:31:32] make strong bones and find wings and
[2:31:34] keep them in a cage all the time?
[2:31:37] There is no need of giving him vitamins
[2:31:39] if you're going to keep him in a cage.
[2:31:41] He don't need vitamins to make him
[2:31:42] strong wings cuz he never got a chance
[2:31:44] to use them. What good does it do to
[2:31:46] preach the Bible of a God that heals, a
[2:31:48] God that got power, and tell the people
[2:31:50] there's a miracle is passed. What good
[2:31:52] does it do? It's just like taking a man
[2:31:55] freezing to death. And here's a nice
[2:31:56] picture of a painted fire. The man
[2:31:59] cannot get warm by a painted fire. He's
[2:32:02] freezing. He's got to have warmth. And a
[2:32:05] man that is thirsting for God can't be
[2:32:07] satisfied till something happens.
[2:32:11] Amen. So real elect bride members can't
[2:32:14] be satisfied hearing, hearing, hearing.
[2:32:16] Hallelujah. Every Sunday they only
[2:32:18] hearing. There is no action or
[2:32:20] recognizing or acting on the word. You
[2:32:22] have to come to a place where you could
[2:32:24] act yourself on the word. In other
[2:32:26] words, do you bring a revival to the
[2:32:28] church? Hallelujah. Or you coming here
[2:32:30] to be we we are battery chargers.
[2:32:34] We we have a recharging ministry then.
[2:32:36] You come in here to plug in. What to
[2:32:38] your plug? You plug no working.
[2:32:43] Hallelujah. So you come to church and
[2:32:45] every time they come with with the
[2:32:48] plug and the preacher come with plugs he
[2:32:50] just say a plug man and you come to plug
[2:32:53] in to get charge I feel I'm feeling
[2:32:56] good and you you let your whole charge
[2:32:58] run out until next Sunday you act bring
[2:33:03] your charge
[2:33:05] let us start with the charge everybody
[2:33:08] bring the pillar of fire bring your
[2:33:10] experience bring your faith come here on
[2:33:12] that great expectation for a different
[2:33:15] kind of service.
[2:33:17] Praise God. Praise God. One time my son
[2:33:20] used to ask but that daddy what about
[2:33:22] that short quick message
[2:33:27] she long services but where the short
[2:33:30] quick message it coming. It come when
[2:33:33] you come to when you charge 15 minutes
[2:33:35] host poured out pour for 2 hours you're
[2:33:37] sitting on you can't move from your seat
[2:33:39] 15 minutes the preacher can't preach no
[2:33:41] more. Are you looking for that kind of
[2:33:42] service? You know, that looking for you
[2:33:44] think I looking here to crank up. Yes,
[2:33:46] we cranking up two hours service
[2:33:49] Wednesday. And before we had other
[2:33:51] ministries is we solo. Hallelujah. I had
[2:33:54] to preach Jude service. This service and
[2:33:56] you had to keep going, keep going.
[2:34:00] A man that's thirsting for God can't be
[2:34:02] satisfied till something happens. It's
[2:34:03] an experience and that kind of
[2:34:05] experience will never watch. And that
[2:34:08] kind of an experience will bring forth
[2:34:09] great faith. You never know what it is.
[2:34:12] You cannot trust God who you have never
[2:34:14] met. Okay, now watch something. You
[2:34:18] Methodist, you Baptist, you
[2:34:20] Presbyterian, Catholic, you human beings
[2:34:23] which Christ died for, you have got just
[2:34:25] as much right to these blessings as the
[2:34:28] Pentecostal has. The only thing you got
[2:34:30] to do is just sign. thing they want you
[2:34:32] to do is sign your name on the church
[2:34:34] book instead of staying there until you
[2:34:36] got an experience that God has changed
[2:34:38] you by the baptism of the Holy Ghost. It
[2:34:42] takes an experience to accompany faith.
[2:34:44] So all the faith they claim to have in
[2:34:46] this message all the faith, brother
[2:34:48] Kangly, where is the experience that
[2:34:50] accompanies the faith? I I will start
[2:34:53] with just the worship. Where is the
[2:34:54] worship? Where is the praises? Where are
[2:34:56] the shouts? Oh, we don't need that no
[2:34:58] more. Or you will use the code when you
[2:35:00] know when the when he when he um when
[2:35:02] when the van come back load don't make a
[2:35:04] noise when empty. So, so this church is
[2:35:07] an empty church. We making noise because
[2:35:08] we we go in light. But when when you put
[2:35:10] all the grocery and all the load inside
[2:35:12] his van, quiet man,
[2:35:16] they they will take that and
[2:35:18] find that devil is a wicked man.
[2:35:22] Nobody a wicked man. They went the
[2:35:25] court. No noise god. Because wherever
[2:35:28] God is, there's noise. Up in heaven,
[2:35:30] there's noise. You know, angel body,
[2:35:32] holy, holy, Lord, God Almighty. You
[2:35:34] think we make noise? Somebody say
[2:35:35] exercise when you're getting up. Say no.
[2:35:37] Get up. I'm getting say no.
[2:35:39] Well, you you stay healthy.
[2:35:43] Abraham knew what he was talking about
[2:35:45] for he met God for 25 years. He endured
[2:35:49] because he believe what God has said.
[2:35:52] Praise God. Moses, he had a knowledge
[2:35:54] that he was the deliverer. But you see,
[2:35:56] he never had any experience. But when he
[2:35:59] met God in that burning bush, he knowed
[2:36:01] what he was after then. He knowed in
[2:36:03] whom he had believed. Praise God. Praise
[2:36:06] God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[2:36:09] Praise God. Praise God. Do you believe
[2:36:11] that? Hallelujah. So he's talking to
[2:36:13] somebody in the wheelchair. He said,
[2:36:14] "Cast them reasoning down." He said,
[2:36:15] "Them things are vanities." Abraham
[2:36:17] called those things which are not as
[2:36:19] though they were. After he met God,
[2:36:21] that's the first thing. You have to have
[2:36:22] an experience. If you don't have an
[2:36:24] experience, you won't have faith. Every
[2:36:27] man, every Christian that calls the name
[2:36:28] of Christ has no right at the pull pit
[2:36:31] until he has a backside of the desert
[2:36:32] experience. Doctors may come and explain
[2:36:34] it and so on. You might explain all this
[2:36:37] away, that away, but if you ever met
[2:36:39] God, you had an experience. You know,
[2:36:42] you and God alone stood on those grounds
[2:36:44] and Satan can't put his dirty, nasty
[2:36:46] feet on it. That's holy ground. Give the
[2:36:49] Lord some
[2:36:49] praises.
[2:36:51] Hallelujah. I'm going to close.
[2:36:54] So James was justifying Abraham by
[2:36:57] works. But we know Paul referred to here
[2:37:00] what God seen in Abraham. So God through
[2:37:03] Paul was talking about God see the
[2:37:05] faith. And so a man is justified by
[2:37:08] faith. That's what God see in you the
[2:37:11] faith. But James say man will see your
[2:37:14] works. So the prophet preach a message
[2:37:16] works is faith expressed. So what faith
[2:37:18] is inside of people would be expressed
[2:37:20] by works. So you cannot say you have
[2:37:23] faith and no works. That makes no sense.
[2:37:26] Hallelujah. Your works will express what
[2:37:28] faith inside of you. If you have faith,
[2:37:30] you will praise God. If you receive a
[2:37:31] promise from God like Abraham, do you
[2:37:33] believe that? Abraham was expressing his
[2:37:36] faith. He had met in God's promise. He
[2:37:38] was ready. He ready everything for the
[2:37:40] baby. And God saw he believed. Now faith
[2:37:43] is a revelation from God. Faith is a
[2:37:45] revelation. And there's where I want to
[2:37:47] stay a moment. It's a revelation. It's
[2:37:50] revealed to you by his grace. It's
[2:37:51] nothing you did. You didn't work
[2:37:53] yourself up into faith. You ever have
[2:37:55] faith is given to you by the grace of
[2:37:56] God. And God reveal it to you.
[2:37:58] Therefore, faith is a revelation. The
[2:38:00] whole church is built upon revelation.
[2:38:01] Listen this part now. If God by his
[2:38:04] grace, not the preacher, not anybody
[2:38:06] else, but God can place into your heart
[2:38:09] a revelation that I'm going to be well.
[2:38:12] There isn't nothing going to keep you
[2:38:13] from sitting there. There's nothing can
[2:38:15] hold you there. You are going to be
[2:38:17] well. But until that does happen, you're
[2:38:19] going to sit right there where the
[2:38:21] doctor say you're going to sit. Until it
[2:38:23] has to be revealed to you by the grace
[2:38:25] of God. And that's why you need to get
[2:38:27] in the spirit. And when you get in the
[2:38:29] spirit, you can get revelation. Praise
[2:38:30] God. Hallelujah. David. Now remember, it
[2:38:33] was revealed to David. Here is the
[2:38:35] armies of the living God standing there
[2:38:37] and watch boasting uncircumcised
[2:38:39] Philistine. We call him cancer. We call
[2:38:40] him paralytic. Revelation struck him. He
[2:38:43] said, "The God that took me out of the
[2:38:44] pores of the bear, took me out of the
[2:38:46] port of the lion. How much more would he
[2:38:48] deliver me from this uncircumcised
[2:38:50] Philistine? His brothers were more able
[2:38:53] to do it, but it wasn't revealed to
[2:38:54] them. They had army, they had word, they
[2:38:56] had coach, they had books, they had
[2:38:58] mysteries, they had all kind of
[2:38:59] revelations, but they didn't have faith.
[2:39:02] They didn't have the real revelation to
[2:39:04] step out there to face Golth. And that
[2:39:06] challenge coming back. Goliath is on his
[2:39:08] way. As I said, the bull is coming. Oh,
[2:39:11] praise God. It was revealed to David.
[2:39:13] Notice when it was revealed, David
[2:39:16] became fearless. Notice the giant on the
[2:39:19] other side didn't believe it. Neither
[2:39:20] will the cancer. He laughed and said,
[2:39:22] "Am I a dog?" But David said it was
[2:39:25] revealed to him. He had faith in what he
[2:39:26] was doing. He knowed what he was doing
[2:39:28] to do. He did it because it revealed to
[2:39:30] him. Until that happened, every preacher
[2:39:33] in what? And if God would just spoke
[2:39:35] that right down in your heart tonight,
[2:39:37] you are not going to be laying in that
[2:39:39] bed. You are not going to be sitting in
[2:39:40] that chair. everything could change. But
[2:39:43] until that happened, every preacher in
[2:39:44] the world could could it wouldn't help
[2:39:46] you. It could pray for you. It would
[2:39:47] encourage you. But until that faith,
[2:39:49] healing power, the healing power is in
[2:39:51] you. It don't come from the preacher. It
[2:39:54] comes to you by faith. If the healing
[2:39:56] power was in brother, he didn't go and
[2:39:58] talk all this talk to get the people
[2:39:59] into faith. But he talked to them to get
[2:40:01] them into faith because faith is not
[2:40:03] activated. You see him on the platform
[2:40:04] all of a sudden he sweep here. He said
[2:40:06] that woman there with cancer, that woman
[2:40:07] there with sick with so and so, God just
[2:40:09] healed you. God has healed you. What
[2:40:10] they doing? They're pulling the pillar
[2:40:11] of fire off the platform. And faith just
[2:40:14] doing that. Faith just he want to deal
[2:40:16] with this here, but faith pulling the
[2:40:17] pillar of fire like that. He's operating
[2:40:19] here, but faith moving. And that faith
[2:40:21] is what does in the people. Amen. And
[2:40:23] that faith had to be in you. Praise God.
[2:40:24] Do you believe that? I'm going to skip
[2:40:26] out. I'm going to close. Music, please.
[2:40:30] Hallelujah.
[2:40:33] Hallelujah.
[2:40:36] Faith that doesn't produce works. Anyone
[2:40:39] has a right to doubt your testimony.
[2:40:42] Hallelujah. Now, do you hear it? Before
[2:40:45] we start the prayer line, if your faith
[2:40:49] doesn't produce works with it, you can't
[2:40:52] make anyone believe that you're healed.
[2:40:55] Hallelujah. And he says, well, I got all
[2:40:58] faith in the world. You don't. Because
[2:41:00] when you got all faith, works is married
[2:41:02] to faith. They are husband and wife. One
[2:41:06] identify the other. You say you're
[2:41:08] married. Where your
[2:41:10] wife? I can't
[2:41:14] tell. If you're married, you ought to
[2:41:16] have a wife. Where's your husband? I
[2:41:18] ain't saying at all. Works and faith
[2:41:21] goes together. Amen. I'll close with a
[2:41:25] scripture. Matthew
[2:41:27] 7:18-29, Jesus speaks, "A good tree
[2:41:31] cannot bring forth evil fruit. Neither
[2:41:34] can a corrupt tree bring forth good
[2:41:35] fruit. Every tree that bringeth not good
[2:41:37] fruit is heed down and cast into the
[2:41:39] fire. Wherefore by their fruits ye shall
[2:41:42] know them. Not everyone that say unto
[2:41:45] me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the
[2:41:47] kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the
[2:41:51] will of my father, not the Lord, Lord
[2:41:54] part, not the talk part, but who that do
[2:41:58] it. Many will say to me in that day,
[2:42:01] Lord, have we not prophesy thy name? In
[2:42:04] thy name we cast out devils. in thy name
[2:42:05] done manif works and I will profess unto
[2:42:08] them I never knew you depart from me you
[2:42:10] that work iniquity and here we go
[2:42:13] therefore are you ready whosoever
[2:42:17] heareth these things of
[2:42:18] mine and doeth them that's where the
[2:42:22] fate is that is where you have to follow
[2:42:25] through in obedience the obedience of
[2:42:26] faith
[2:42:28] what the prophet say follow obedience to
[2:42:29] the entire word of God entitly you to
[2:42:31] the token
[2:42:33] whosoever heareth these saints of mines
[2:42:35] and do with them, I would liken him unto
[2:42:38] a wise man which build his house upon a
[2:42:41] rock. And the rain descended, and the
[2:42:43] floods came, and the winds blew, and
[2:42:45] beat upon that rock, and it fell not,
[2:42:48] for it is founded upon a rock. And
[2:42:50] everyone that hear these saints of
[2:42:52] minds, and doeth them not, shall be
[2:42:53] likened unto a foolish man, which built
[2:42:56] his house upon the sand. And the rain
[2:42:58] descended, and the floods came, the
[2:43:00] winds blew, beat upon the house, and it
[2:43:02] fell. Great was the fall of it. It came
[2:43:04] to pass when Jesus had ended these
[2:43:06] saints. The people was punished at his
[2:43:07] doctrine for he taught them not as as
[2:43:10] one having authority and not as the
[2:43:12] scribes. So friends, we all here. Israel
[2:43:16] all heard the Moses, all heard the word,
[2:43:18] but many didn't walk with faith. Many
[2:43:21] walk out and they were still in their
[2:43:22] flesh and their senses. You're
[2:43:24] challenged this morning to walk in
[2:43:27] obedience to the faith that was revealed
[2:43:29] by the prophet of Malachi 4. We have too
[2:43:32] much of confessions of I believe, I
[2:43:33] believe. But the devil believe and
[2:43:35] tremble. You have to go beyond believing
[2:43:37] now. You have to really come in
[2:43:38] obedience to what God said that God
[2:43:40] could see the action of faith in your
[2:43:42] life and we would see by your works.
[2:43:45] Let's all stand as they begin to play
[2:43:47] something and we worship the Lord.
[2:43:50] Hallelujah.
[2:43:54] [Music]
[2:44:01] Father God, we thank you today for your
[2:44:03] presence. Thank you for your word, Lord
[2:44:05] Jesus. And may a great experience come
[2:44:08] upon your people right now. The fire of
[2:44:10] faith, the fire of your love, the fire
[2:44:12] of your presence. Have your way, Lord
[2:44:14] Jesus, and release the anointing that
[2:44:16] would birth the true baptism of the Holy
[2:44:18] Ghost upon their lives. Grant it,
[2:44:20] Father. In Jesus name we wait upon you.
[2:44:22] In Jesus name we ask it. Amen and amen.
[2:44:25] Praise the
[2:44:27] Lord.

[2:49:07] prayer. Oh, what peace. Oh, I
[2:49:11] know. Our peace we
[2:49:18] offer
[2:49:21] and what needless things we bear.
[2:49:31] Oh, because we
[2:49:34] do not
[2:49:38] carry
[2:49:41] everything to God in
[2:49:45] prayer.
[2:49:47] Oh,
[2:49:49] are we weak and heavy
[2:49:54] laden? Come with a load of care.
