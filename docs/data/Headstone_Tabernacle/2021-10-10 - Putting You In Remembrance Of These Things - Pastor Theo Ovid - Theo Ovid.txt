where there's evil on any hand even on every hand darkness covering the earth so much of disinformation misinformation lies all kind of spiritual deception throwing people off track off the beaten path off of plum off of the word into the old human instagram judging things for their own selves free thinkers lord remnant of that cloth because you have your pattern and you have your mind and we want to connect to that mind this morning father god may your mind drop down this morning and speak to our hearts as we beat up on you in jesus name i ask it amen god bless you thanks for coming out we certainly appreciate you coming out this morning uh and if you have your bibles i'm going to go straight into the scriptures uh ii peter 1 i want four to twelve matthew 25 we want to read 14 to 20 to 30. thank you musicians thank you by anthony such an inspiring song service second peter there's an echo we have here [Music] whereby i give them unto us exceeding great rabbi are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this giving all diligence up to your feet virtue and devote your knowledge and to knowledge temperance to temperance patience to patient's godliness to godliness brotherly kindness and to broadly kindness charity for if these things be new on a bone they make you that ye shall neither be borrowing unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that luck at these things is blind cannot see a file and had forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren given all diligence to make your calling an election sure so if you do these things you shall never fall so what's the opposite of that if you don't do these things you will fall we see therefore so on entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present truth second scripture from match chapter 25 and this is right after the parable of the virgins jesus speaking for the kingdom of heaven verse 14 matthew 25 verse 14. for the kingdom of heaven is as a man traveling as a far country who called his own servants and delivered unto them his goods and onto one he gave five talents to another two to another one to every man according to his several ability straightway took his journey then he that had received the five talents when traded with the same and made them another five talents and likewise he that had received two he also gained another two but he had received one went and digged in the earth hit the lord's money after a long time the lord of those citizens commit and recognize reconnect with them which is to give them an account right made them account and so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents in lord dawg has delivered unto me five talents behold i have gained besides them five talents more his lord said unto him well done though good and faithful sivan that has been faithful over a few things and i will make the ruler over many things enter though into the joy of the lord he also that had received two talents came and said lord thou has delivered unto me to talents behold i have gained two other talents beside them his lord said unto them well done good and faithful servant though has been faithful over a few things i will make the ruler over many things enter into the joy of the lord thy lord then he which had received the one talent came and said lord i knew that that was a hard man reaping where thou has not shown what a revolution and guarded where thou has not strawed and i was afraid and went and hid thy talent in the earth lo there thou hast that is dying his lord answered and said to him though wicked and full scissor down new ways that i reap where i sewed not and guarded where i have not strawed though or just therefore to put my money to the exchanges and when i come at my comment i should have received mine owned with usury which is interest take therefore the talent from him and give it unto him that had ten talents for unto everyone that hacked shall be given and he shall have abundance but from him that had not shall be taken away even what he had let us ball ahead one more time okay one vote for us and cassie the unprofitable seven into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth let's pray father we thank you for your word and father prayer take me out of the way cover me lord and hiding behind the cliff of the rock that the people can hear thus saith the lord by your word this morning and jesus in my ask at him and you may be seated water probably go praise the name of the lord so you find out the lord we have expect fruit from us expect more from us you don't expect what he gives you you give him back he expects something more and that's why we read that scripture add to your faith virtue and devote your knowledge he gives you faith for it is a revelation only god could give you that revelation came from heaven here revelation is not here in the word revelation is when the word is revealed to you and the holy word alone is the divine revelator or revealer of the revelation of jesus christ so i cannot reveal it to you i could share the word with you but between you and god the spirit have to take the word and reveal it to you and that that becomes your revelation not flesh and blood heart not revealed unto you you ain't hear from a man you hear that ready from heaven that was all that knew he was the christ but peter heard from heaven he said what the christ the son of the living god then jesus said flesh and blood hadn't revealed unto you but my father in heaven oh glory to god he was on the backside afterwards he had to deny cry after deny christ afterwards but that still didn't stop stop the revelation that god thunder into his soul and when god turned into a soul no demon in hell could take on what god put inside your soul oh glory to god that's my god a lord that goes so far and no more oh give the lord a shout your backslide so far and no more but all that the father hath passed and has given me oh glory to god shall come oh lord your prophecy hanging over your head you shall come i don't care what the devil put out there you can put virus after virus it doesn't matter press after press it doesn't matter government after government rome could come inside the church it doesn't matter oh glory to god hallelujah praise god no my devil's gone cut you to find you you must hell get blow up or can a demon power to find you you didn't choose him he chose you you have to bump to your family bump to your friends bump you to bear bump your adultery lion fornication to get to you oh give the lord and you can't shout this morning i can't choke this morning oh glory to god hallelujah praise god [Applause] david was straight under testimony he said i was young no i'm old i've never seen the righteous forsaken or a seed big bread you expect the back bread no come on now you expect to be forsaken no he said i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you but i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world [Applause] when your knee hurts in your head with you when you're back hurting you with you when you're lying on a sick bed he's sitting with you when you're doing a pressure until he's with you look at the lord i pray that while you pray no why you have blessed anymore to praise him now oh glory to god comes always a kind open your mouth [Applause] amen praise the lord receive it so from verse 12 ii peter wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always remembers of these things though you know them and be established in the present truth my title today is putting you in remembrance of these things these are these things you want to put remembrance of our subject make a call on election show have an inspiration if you do these things come back to these things you will never fall oh glory to god hallelujah but you can you fall sure how many palmer of his hands he move his hands poop you find me on the ground there oh harlan you mean that of course either any man could fall anybody could fall but peter gave an answer to that if you do these things is that these things that have to be done to keep it from falling we fall every day but these things oh glory to god hallelujah okay let's go i pray god is but if i'm praying and there's some statue perfect man no this is some um let's read i pray god tonight if there'll be some here who doesn't know you who never made the peace maybe tonight while we are speaking a little voice has been speaking down in their heart i feel a warning that i can't be around much longer oh god may they put the house in order right now may everything be set may the coldness maybe they're christians they just haven't lived they lived under this so long and seen so many things they lost the value of it the things they take lightly instead of real deeply and sincerely you say oh god let us check up tonight grant it knowing that these great things are only warning us of the soon rapture in church and if we are leading with sin with unbelief with slothfulness we shall not make that rapture amen it has no ifs it has no but this is just the word if we are laden with sin with unbelief with thoughtfulness we shall not make the rapture we know it lord so we pray that you will burn into us the holy ghost dung into our hearts set our souls on fire with your blessing help us to understand now bless the people together bless our precious pastor and his wife bless the deacons the trustees all the laity together forgive our sins heal our sicknesses lord and set our hearts aflame and may we go from this place with a warning message as we meet the people in sin and tell them friend aren't you shameful what you do those things knowing that you have to meet god someday grant it lord i commit them to you now i commit the message all together to work for your glory in jesus name amen or give the lord some praises glory sin unbelief slurfulness not going to make the rapture so you have to get on fire you know what's rightfulness we're getting laziness oh glory that's the opposite of giving all diligence oh praise the lord are you with me now nobody branham and we are approaching the seven seals we just finished the seventh churches i talked about the statue of him and he's preaching he said this is a message on teaching that times the man that is going to be redeemed by the blood of the lord jesus and is going to be in that church age that eternal church age at the end of the season so this message of the perfect man message with these virtues that we identify in second peter was a message and teaching that was going to tie the man to that teacher church oh glory to god that message was to tell you oh praise god isn't that right but a man um so every one of you cleanse your heart lay aside everything so there are some things that you got to do i got to do every one of us you have to lay the side you have to cleanse your heart you have to make yourself a christian you had to break bow your knees you want to get in your knees and pray everyone you cleanse your heart lay aside everything every way keep it out of the way don't let nothing bother you one don't be scared two there is nothing to be scared about three if jesus is coming it's the very moment the whole world has grown and cried for he said don't be worried don't be scared oh glory to god hallelujah watch if it's something breaking forth for a new coming a new coming of a new gift or something it will be wonderful if it is coming time that the revelation of the seven thunders will be revealed to the church how to go i don't know he said if there's coming a time of the revelation of the seven thunders as to how to go i don't know so the revelation of the seven thunder is to show us how to go there's after got to be a message to show us how to go not how to state good church members how to go the object of guiding us together is to show us how to go not to make the message the man of god some message pope no it's how to go [Applause] because if you know how to go it is finished hallelujah i just have to state what i saw my it's the same end but my feet moves because my head says so i can't i can't move like my hand because it's my feet luther can't do the things we did neither kind of meant to this because they had something else the feet moves because the head says so and the head never say no feet you become hand is no each age god has placed these things into his church and pattern it by showing that each individual has to possess these qualities and this being when it is completed is the church of god that's going in the rapture now i know you'll know it but i'm here this morning to put you in remembrance of these things oh give the lord a shout i know you know it but i come to put you in remembrance of these things so that is not just a board with a pyramid and nice colors in it mocking faith and virtue and knowledge and so that is not for that you know that is an example of what's supposed to be in you because with faith you bust out unbelief but virtue you're gonna destroy weakness with knowledge you're gonna destroy ignorance all glory to god hallelujah with temperance your power over everything around you dear with that [Applause] so peter said this if these things be in you and the bone they make you that you better be barren they won't be burned on fruitful if these things be in you so your battle this morning your fight this day is to get these things and recognize these things have to be added oh glory to god hallelujah praise god these things have to be what you have to want to add those things oh glory to god amen and this being when it's completed is the church i've got noticing over this salmon when you finish preach it this message when if people finish believe it no this being when it's completed watch is what when it's completed is the church of god going to rapture and this being and completed is a servant of god in the church of god that's going to rapture so these virtues here is how to go the amen song in the light you know oh you're taught you're shaking pasta and you're going so no you're going back home same way it's not shaking past the hand the kingdom is preached let me hear it and every man let me hear that again let me hear the louder the kingdom is preaching every man what they do they press they don't sit down and stare depressed they don't be lazy depressed the word peter used was giving all diligence or give the lord a shout make it your business hallelujah giving all diligence apply it press for it wrestle for it push be like jacob one electric until you bless me [Applause] glory hallelujah go to burnham the other night one will not that's all god had to do then nothing was going to stop them talking about the disciples they didn't question and study and hem ho and worry like we do whether they should do this or that they went ahead and done it anyhow just one little nut from god done it how could they know it was not from god question how could they know it was not from god they had all these virtues in here all these qualifications and the first little nut from god compared with the very every bit of this they knowed it was the word of god and where where they went did not worry about nothing else when god spoke they went oh glory to god so how could they know it was the voice of god because these things was in them and these things have to be in you that is why there's a faithful ministry for the perfection of the saints or bringing these virtues into the people first by seed word and then by manifestation because you have to get it yourself oh give the lord i shout do you understand what they're here for you're not just here to hear nice sermons oh glory to god hallelujah i don't want this message to be competing with things on facebook and youtube and time magazine and on the internet you know you're banging a mama this is a foolishness i said that this information i'm missing vision all kind of crazy little videos and clips and nonsense and we have the word of god here hallelujah this is dusty the lord you know all them people talking on youtube and facebook and all of them they don't say the lord you think i would say that crap on that nonsense said okay who say what i have got to hear the lord here god sent a prophet before the great and terribly of the lord praise god you see this horror this virus make millions of people in problems all around the world they have nuclear they have bombed their weapon and they can't do nothing about this they're still struggling with it and bro i'm talking about the plagues coming where sons of god going to back up diseases back up the plagues they come in you know this is introduction glory to god when moses tell everyone dropped down the road it turned to snake are jonathan jambos turn rod into snake too they thought they had power but moses said this is wrong number one and now getting started when mozart hit them flies get them fleas afterwards they had nothing to show all the anointing were all from them all the witchcraft anointing all this simile all the voodoo all the obian nonsense had to dry up and the power of god moving and take over he said that is what the holy ghost has given for to stay on the side of the minority and watch the black skies roll back and the power of god moving and take over to god amen [Music] [Applause] slutfulness you say this we are leading with sin unbelief and restlessness we shall not make that rapture amen peter said giving all diligent add what to your faith seven things to your faith you have to add seven things and the seventh one is the most dangerous one because the seventh one is love and that one can fail paul called charity the bund of perfectness that is the glue that's stitching all the rest together that when all the root is finished that come to seal the whole thing oh glory to god it called the bond of perfectness that does glue everything together because you can leak here and leak here he's taking leak out and temperance leak out in godliness leak out in this and leak out in that but when that charity come and seal the whole thing all the virtues is sealed inside of you and then you become a living moving monument devils know you for miles you don't you have to talk you just have to walk oh god oh don't get me started this morning you don't even have to talk you just have to walk oh glory to god and then there is no what is walking before you even start talking [Music] [Applause] you say that's true yes the disciples cast not trying to cast some epileptic spirit and and dramatize it they said come out there become whatever and he decided to talk back to them he said look jesus commissioned all the cast may not warn you the devil was telling them that one of you could cast me out and jesus commissioned the cast my little character and she has no combat among transfiguration no comedy mountain ram said here come jesus he didn't have to say one word he said i'm devastated one more time he said here comes a life here comes a life he didn't even have to say one word and them devils was trembling oh hallelujah praise god they're ready to leave because here come alive that's why he said you'd have to say nothing about it it will speak for itself oh my what is thoughtfulness lazy it means not eat not easily aroused to activity did you not easily aroused to activity a disinclination to work or to take trouble any time your streets start with easy they want to walk down it easy way no traffic might be under wood it must be smooth bubble top is perfect and say there's a line in the street you can't go this morning i might get bite the bed feeling nice oversleeping thoughtful lazy babies he doesn't lack these things as blind can't see your fire off hallelujah and forgotten the sin was perched all glory to god to be stuffful is to be lazy when you're stressful you don't want to do any work you just want to lie around you ever see a it's a slow-moving animal there's a lot that will come from i guess not full but ibrahim said god don't want this to be slutful he want us to have faith oh my hallelujah in the amplified of second peter verse eight it says here for as these qualities are yours and increasingly among in you they will keep you from being idle or unfruitful unto the full personal knowledge of our lord jesus christ the messiah the anointed one but whosoever lacked these qualities is blind and that blind is spiritually short-sighted so he's not blind as to not seeing but blind has to be spiritually short-sighted seeing only what is near to him and has become oblivious to the fact that he was cleansed from his old sin because of this brethren be all the most solitary and eager to make sure which is to make your co-election sure to make sure or to ratify or to strengthen or to make steadfast you're calling an election and if you do this you will never stumble or fall question why would peter say make a call in an election sure you hear we preach you are predestinated you are elected god god happened you say i have not chosen you but you have not chosen me but i have chosen you and yet make your calling an election show it's something that you have to do in other words he said don't take things for granted like the bible said let him that take at this time you take heed lest he fall oh glory to god is that is it a conscience of yourself a watching of your walk is an introspection of your very life oh hallelujah do you want to look within and say you know what where am i at how am i standing where am i standing lord i want to know i want to know from you i don't want the pastor tell me i am standing i want god to tell me i am standing you don't need to hear from the pastor you need to hear from god [Music] oh god you're not a child you're a son and daughter of the living god in the age of maturity so here we come along to this man who had these talents and gave these sevens these talents five produced five the one where two produced two and when the master came back i said is my certain thing well done you upright honorable admirable fit for servant you have been faithful and trustworthy over little a lot of people want big stuff and they can't manage little stuff like you say can't manage that ten dollars you want ten thousand dollars and your attitude towards the little stuff determines how you're going to manage the big stuff i hope one of the preachers in the church could make better sense of that what i just said there they could make more sense than that than me god give you some things into your hand just to see how you deal with it whether it's family friends whatever it is he put things and hannah to you and you just have an attitude towards it if you have a lazy you see if you're lazy about things put it to you you believe about other things you know i was telling somebody you can't lead if you're not prepared to follow you can't be a good leader if you cannot be a good follower you have to learn to follow in order to lead a lot of people want to lead but they don't know how to follow they come like the advice you talk about the man say the man had a revelation he said i'm a man under authority i say to one go he saw jesus under authority because to have authority you ought to be authorized that's how the police of authority the police are authorized by the government so the police could stop cars do that whatever lock up arrest and whatnot because they have the authority they want to authorize and next manpower put in a pull is uniform he do the same thing they arrest him it's not the police uniform is it already here that's where you call impersonation unless you are qualified and and designated to be authorized you can't do it you're not supposed to do it and that's how the bride will be she'll be authorized by god to do the very works of god oh glory to god hallelujah that's why when they challenge jesus he said when you see me you see the father oh glory to god amen so listen listen man said i was afraid this baxter didn't guy here this thoughtful guy here i hear and hit your talent in the ground where you have what is your own so what he was confessing you see what you're giving me i've given you right back and that's what some people have almost for years no change they come to the lord however they are they still are they don't want change they want to be religious they want to come to church they want to hear specials they want to hear good sermons but they don't want to change some people get pain but the pain that god has sent some pain ready come to change here but sometimes people just take pain and just get pain they don't understand it come to change trials come to change to change your desires to change your attitude the trials took job to be a better man he had pain you know he had pressure but it made him a more perfect man a better man oh glory to god hallelujah when you complain oh god why are going through this and why going through that and you're fighting you're fighting you're fighting you're ready yet jesus told peter when you're young you do what you want to do but when you get old somebody gonna lead you to where you don't want to go oh glory to god you're young you're strong but as you get older one day you become vulnerable where you can't go where you want to go you have to be led oh glory to god you better take the leader no from the holy spirit you better take the leader now from god hallelujah praise god amen hallelujah hallelujah so what god is saying here then you talk to the guy you should have invested my money with the bankers and at my coming i would have received what was my own with interest so take the talent away from him and give it to the one who has ten talents for everyone who has will more be given and he will be furnished richly so that he will have an abundance but from the one who does not have even what he does have will be taken away holy the god how long will keep your selfishness how long you already see about your own how long has he about your own family circle are you limited just that that is your world you think we can live there you think god could put us in ministry and live just a family circle alone when the whole church is a family where can't you extend yourself like that knowing that living for others truly is eternal life that you could pray for your brothers pray for your sister have a concern about them lift them up in prayer we're not interested in people business no yes i've been preaching when somebody dog in the dish i don't want to hold on in which holy getting this i want you to know if you want to get out i don't want to know your business i want to know do you want to get out of that situation or you want to stay there are you a pig or sheep in trouble a pig will stay in the mud as people cry to the ghetto or give the lord some praises glory to god hallelujah [Applause] to everyone who has will be given more and he will be finished richly so that he will have an abundance but from the one who does not have even what he does have will be taken away and throw the good for nothing servant into the outer darkness where they will be weeping and grinding of teeth so god expect us to add to what we have been given ten percent say amen god expect us to add to what we have been given he don't expect us to stay where we are and how we are we got to do better we got to do more we got to apply ourselves with diligence about these things of god these things glory to god amen hallelujah praise the name of the lord brother branham we need to go back to the power of god and something can do the same thing today although in our numbers he said persecution always gives strength to the church we have had it too easy we get thoughtful we get to a place where we don't want to move on because everything has just been handed to us it takes sorrow and tears and sweat and prayer and faith and promise to move forward in the power of the holy spirit you think that word reading again do you think i want to hear that again or if you're so comfortable you want kfc this morning oh hallelujah but here would have taken it takes sorrow and tears and sweat and prayer and faith and promise to move forward in the power of the holy spirit watch that zeal and power that they had in those days had long time vanished from all assemblies i'm afraid if the windows would be shut out tonight people would run every way and never come back again i guess he was talking about when them sisters was praying in the upper room in those days and some men was finding it's too noisy they call me some buck shots and build some bullets and the bullets just hit the sisters and fall along on the ground never damage them never do nothing to them and they continue worshiping just as usual and when that testimony go out is more people coming as they run them here the fire spread in here god had them to run them here and run them there and the devil didn't know that he's spreading fire he helping god do the work oh god when they push them here and they go here a fire built here a fire built here oh glory to god that was the old time old-fashioned that was the church in the early days hallelujah saw this trail man praying woman praying grandma pain grandpa prayed everybody praying everybody on the anointing everybody under the atmosphere now people sit down and they wanna hear talk another thing it's too bad you know to think that those things happening like that and yet proves that god that was in the old days is still god today god will ever remember god reacts and he expects his people to keep their vows and their promises when we get everything so easy then we just slip along and the first thing you know we have gone out from these things losing our inheritance oh you mean you could lose your inheritance of course adam lost his he lost his right to eternal life he lost his inheritance that's what the book is all about that's what the lamb came to take the book that's what jesus died for not to be somebody on the cross and he was dying across he died to get this book this book is what the prophet caught when the mighty angel revision 10 brought down the book this book had your name that's why you are sitting listening to me this morning because you can't come [Applause] the father to call you therefore you are one in a million if anybody else in china can rejoice nobody has to rejoice like you because god called you god put your your name on his book isn't that right oh my hallelujah why jesus now as in the individual these virtues and things knowledge and temperance is added to our faith then when the capstone comes prophecy then when the capstone comes the holy spirit cements it together so it's a building that god is building and when you lay bricks in the building the man come afterwards and do something called plastering where they put an and all little blocks space between the blocks is sealed up you have to plast it cement it all right there and watch and there is the baptism of the holy spirit that is why it is too short today so you say it's not just faith only of virtue or knowledge what not is all of that sealed up it's the true baptism of the holy ghost that's ten percent saying amen all right remember terence now watch now coming down from the holy spirit what has come then he will give you supernatural faith so they come from the world you give your heart to jesus they get baptized in jesus name but something supernatural has to take place all right that's the operation not of man but of god so the holy spirit come now and watch he said and and and the holy spirit come and give you a supernatural faith spiritual feet and here at the bottom then that spiritual faith recognizes only the word so baptist careful your methodist fool your pentecostal catholic catholic fully because your faith the faith that god gave you only recognizes his word once you take the word and slam it and you you say that is mine my father talking there i'm hearing from mighty orphanage god is talking to me that's spiritual faith spiritual defeat arrested recognize gossip and old talk and misinformation and disinformation spiritual faith recognizes just the word only the word because god is speaking oh glory to god are you with me now hallelujah watch no matter what anybody else say it don't do no good they only knows the word if somebody said that this america is past that faith only knows the word somebody said there's no such thing as the baptismal holy ghost that friend only knows the word that is real spiritual faith do you have that do you recognize the word do you know the word well you have real spiritual faith now did that say you have to add but give the lord some praises people oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah when you have the faith that recognizes only the word not professor so-and-so not doctor so and so not president and prime minister so-and-so when that faith recognized the only word then you could begin to add now to that faith number one coming down to your mental feet right here comes the holy spirit coming down into your mental feet making it spiritual faith then the spiritual faith only recognizes the word number two then you have a spiritual now you will have the holy spirit and will seal all these things into you as the holy spirit covers this from your faith up to the holy spirit seals you in with christ oh hallelujah what does the preacher have to do with that oh come on now this from the faith told the holy spirit sees you with christ know a devil can't touch that seed when god sees you in oh god there are seven seals oh give the lord some priests is that one seal this book was sealed with seven seals it had seven seats on the inside ismc on the backside but sealed with seven seals and you are seized with the book come on now look at me starting here this morning you are seen with the book and you are sealed by the word and then you are sealed by the spirit oh glory to god so god opened the channel of your mind to receive the word and then through that channel don't come the holy ghost oh give the lord i shout see you by the word see you by the spirit oh glory to god give the lord a shout my god my god no faith was sealed by the word it will rain no evidence no manifestation no dynamics nothing it felt real his faith was sealed by the word and at after 120 years don't come the dynamics don't come the rain abraham faith was sealed i am going to have a son i'm going to have a son still the old man he's my fault but i'm gonna have a son because it's a revelation god said so god said so they're laughing at us because we're waiting 50 years for dynamic mechanics we're still waiting there's not a man on earth to tell me don't wait oh get the lord i shall be still waiting and when the power of this church rises god that's what i'm waiting on the power of this church [Applause] hallelujah don't be ashamed of your testimony don't be ashamed of the words of the son of man don't be ashamed of the prophecy hanging over you don't take nothing for granted make your calling an election confirmed ratified sure okay the lord some presence [Applause] [Music] glory all them soldiers of the cross

ready to offer up that's the god bless of god will provide for himself if god said there'll be a super church a super race you think i could believe some corona virus or some press come down or

morning oh glory to god she's asking near the headstone super race super church [Music] [Applause] cooperating all these years to get into saturn eden with a secret agent bride no longer put god put you as a secret agent on the earth just dust man what kind of flesh man what kind of feeling man backsliding man mysteries on the earth and said can be them these people saw backstabbing they're fighting the laws fighting the country fighting orders they were going to fight caesar they will fight the taxation for them jesus born in nazareth at all sit down a minute you know i say you know why they call for taxes heracle taxes the only reason he covered taxes not because he wanted any money you know because god wanted jesus in position do you understand that so if bishop and message poor preaching don't bother with them forget herod don't pay no taxes also mary and joseph in the wrong place massive descriptions and breaking the scriptures but god along herod is a taxation he had to come back to your position a bit so mary was a big belly that was the head down to nazareth because the scripture says dear you have to be born the shepherd's head and don't nazareth because god showing his shepherds where he will be born it has no room in the end because everybody coming out to pay taxes because god wants christ to be born in a manger oh give the lord a shout bethlehem house of god's bread hallelujah so when there's no room for you here no room for you dear god want a position to replace you in position to be born or give the lord a shout god wants in the right place the right time oh glory to god the devil's a liar this morning oh forget the negative let's talk about the positive [Applause] [Music] either bodybuilding crazy fanatics in the message enough so i'm pure local plum off the rockers but you see i am not the lord of that servant or servant the lord of those servants will take care of them that's not my job i know brahm came to address two churches so he's on the message of only the bride he's the messenger of the bride and church oh glory to god he's the messenger of two vines hallelujah one vice crazy as hell i have nothing to do with that i can't talk about that vine they're vine on their own i come to preach the bright elect oh glory to god the blood wash of jesus christ those who want the press those who want to make the coin election show those who want to examine this health oh glory to god to see if they're in the fate oh hallelujah those who want to come out of the slutfulness and the laziness [Music] listen listen is that environment you are born in agenda no no no you're born diligent and you're feeling no we become that we acquire that we choose to walk in that like my wife was saying something this morning she said you know um life is so short people could do good amen i said that's so true there are people who just not doing good just about the article the rich has so much money and so they get greedy some people the more they get the more greedy to become not more giving more greedy because you see they reach ten thousand and they can horrors with the manual twenty so they can't give a man who are none and when they reach 40 they have a problem because somebody had eaten do you see what's going on there so somebody wanted five dollars they can't give that because they viewed the person 80. so they want to conquer that person they conquer 80 they go to 100 this is about 200. when there's a million they have horrors they're feeling poor they continue somebody with 10 million and when they get they tell me no they feel any porous because somebody's a billionaire and they want to know how they could get up there am i trying to finish the grave taking them they're on the way out now escorted out monique i helped them the doctor scared them and their life wasted they can't give a testimony who to help who they support who they encourage there's nobody they can't talk they are a testimony of a soul one for jesus christ where they go in like somebody called family war the grandmother vets with this one and the children pass on the fight after granny um what is worse about their guinness fighter body so it's so long i can't remember potentially the foolish only children just like pastors persons are foolish on the church how many children people fighting for them is we and we against them like a sword fight are you fighting with nobody i have fighted with nobody i fighting with the wrestler by the angel because the biggest enemy i have is to of it i haven't ministered any of them they may have their own battle of the fight and every church are three cannot believers them doing like only one kind of nature they are liars if they said one kind the lion and every church had three kinds oh god that's the bride that's the bride is that tree cannot right you only have one bro you know that's the body of christ you can't pin that down that's a universal body the bride that's only in trinidad has not wronged the world you epic in the bride and i can't pick the brightest god chose the bride oh give the lord a shout hallelujah praise god amen my my mind let me see how i could can wrap it no so then he said no the holy spirit from your feet after always preceding the christ from your feet up to the holy spirit season christ then you become one what you become one you and christ live together at that day so this is in john 14 20 come now at that day you will know that i am the father the father me and i knew so that is not a phrase that is appointed time at that day what day when all this is sealed unto you at that day you will know i'm in the father you and me and i knew he said what then that's a sealed unit of the lord god amen okay no when and then they are vindicated and placed when that time takes place prophecy they become vindicated sons and daughters of god when when that time comes so these virtues have to be you see how important this is these butchers are going to be inside sealed them sealed unit then they're vindicated this place if you die you take the blood out of a man you embalm him trouble a lot of them never got him bound you take the blood out of the man he's gone then the only thing to do is to put another black blood back in he's going to live again you took his blood out now we have got to put the blood of jesus christ in sea and that brings watch the fate of jesus christ devotee of jesus christ now remember we have our faith natural faith natural virtue natural temperatures some people can wait very long they have natural patience we're not talking about your natural patients we're talking about the patience of jesus christ right temples of jesus christ patience of jesus christ godliness of jesus christ brotherly kindness of jesus christ and the love of god which is jesus christ he's the head that controls you con you are controlled by the head dear is the perfect man of god when he possesses these virtues not when he preaches a good sermon now you hear me keep beating that all the time you know why i'm doing that because this is the truth people interpret the sermon to be the perfect man this being is the perfect man that's what we're coming to the perfect man in other words the word is a conduit for the spirit to flow the word was lost to the ages so god had to connect the word like a plumbing line that the spirit could float through the world hallelujah because first was god above us bill of fire right god with us and jesus christ now god come into us upper room holy ghost amen their pentecost fully come isn't that right so that same god when they're coming to uni now the word fell down the church fell into the ground and up come luther wesley godwin's what do you know restoring he says enjoy our restore his holy word so when he bring back the word now you have to bring back the spirit oh give the lord a show did you get what i'm saying so after jesus came son of man put seas and disciples holy ghost come on them which was son of god and son of god come through seven ages a prophecy in the day son of man will be revealed so god prophesy sorrow man will come back again so god send back william branham to reveal the solomon to bring back seeds to put into you to bring back son of god the spirit son of man gone what next son of god after the son of god be son of david in the millennium but now we're son of god to do what to bring on the manifestation of the sons of god oh give the lord a shout in the house then he's in the same pillar of fire that's resident jesus christ rest and placed sons in the body of christ [Applause] there ain't no joke that i don't milk there's no sermon that's some manifested reality same pillow fire i'm going to wrap up [Music] whoo then god representing his church as a bride a woman god represents his church as a bride and here we go this is important and the way he brings each individual to being a son to go in that bride he also brought the bride to these ages so in other words the aegis was living out these virtues these revelations these seals these mysteries and god bring that from the church ages to the individual that flood it wasn't just flooding nor flood and god spoke to knowing that was it being baptized with water like the mystery behind the flood it was justified [Music] when jesus died his blood fell on the earth it was sanctified then the prophet came in before the fiery day of the lord said earth had to get fire baptism so it's all perfect it's not just flood phenoid or the earth was justified in the day of noah showing that redemption is or work is already in effect so when god called you and justify you redemption work has begun upon you then he said grieve not the holy spirit of god whether you are sealed until the day of your redemption so god gave down payment while the rest of the revelation unfolds to bring you into complete redemption or to with the redemption of the body itself so all them sayings have gone on before going on the dust of the earth but you are one of them who are alive and remain to experience complete redemption including the change of the body oh glory to god hallelujah praise god praise god praise god do you believe that and jesus had been obedient to god and then god prayed them positionally so god didn't carry favor jesus i said you jesus no no no he went through though he was son yet he learned obedience for the things he suffered he had headaches you know that he felt tired you know you know the storm must come he wasn't even waking up he was that talk tired that would be talking about he went through processes just like what you go through he went through that too although he was a son it doesn't excuse him though he was a son you are son what do you want some through the waters some should have flood some true great trials all through the blood oh glory to god he could send you the lions then you're still god in the lion's den fiery furnace still god of the fiery furnace red sea in front of you still god of the red sea oh glory to god hallelujah watch now when the member here we go are you ready when the member is born by the holy ghost into the family of god and has proven to have these virtues in him that god can see that god can see virtue knowledge temperance patience brotherly kindness and godliness in him then god seals him or places him and that is when you see the sons and daughters of god so you already see them yet you know you've seen men in jackson ty you see this is a long dress but when you're talking about seeing these sons and daughters of god you're talking about sealed units before peter had them get deceived and jason stop preaching they were speaking all along with jesus and one time they get so excited they come and say lord the devil has something to do with devil's journal they're not converted they are anointed helping jesus with ministry but they are ready for yet to know notice when when the night come when jesus is going crucified and somebody said peace peace do you want him i see you in church no no no no no wrong man because he do have resident power to withstand world's assault demanding beginner nobody hit him a cloud i hit him with a stick you know you one of them peter says [Music] that one invested again elixir all the anointing way off you know you come like all these special singing boats when the boat was working and you broke along they said lord lord wake up did you perish and fellas stop singing yes no more specials you know me listening singing never get really here praise the lord storm coming but they're telling me something nothing you know they're singing you gotta talk to the storm you stomach the problem when jesus wake up so peace be still and whether no they had the fear to do that you know because peter had afraid to walk on the water you are more fit than you think you know you sit in a hearing but you have to move out one day of your comfort zone you have faith you know that's why you believe the word you have faith oh glory to god let me see if i can wrap up keep saying that all right so watch you say make us fit servants forgive our past bless our future guide us o lord with thy mighty hand she over bless these ministers here bless all the laity all the visitors be there with us lord we are your servants we give ourselves holy to you that the power of your spirit might have the more the prayer menaces in our life forgive us and help us raise up mighty men raise up mighty wires of faith open this year lord that hidden manner that rocked me to the rock that we might see the program of god prophecy now cap off the pyramids of our life so you have to have a pyramid in your life that has to be capped off watch put the capstone christ jesus upon each and every one of us how could christ the capstone come and the prayer is not built so it has to have a word praise built inside of you that the caption could come to that is that coming to you anyway coming to the pyramid in you oh praise the name of the lord he says may his great magnificent holy blessing be upon us all may the fire of the holy ghost come upon us may the poor resurrection be manifested oh my hallelujah he said time shall be no more you know the time is over what happens could it be so no brethren seriously think if it is then the pyramid is kept by the seven thunders so the capstone is seven thunders so that means capstone seventh under revelation word seed turns to spirit that's christ so the capstone the seven thunders is jesus christ because the capstone which is the seventh and this caps the pyramid if that be so time runs out oh hallelujah praise god hallelujah those voices becomes a manifestation in your life oh bye then if that be so much you remember the prayer message it's the caption what does it do the holy spirit kept off the individual and sealed it when we added to our faith righteousness godliness so forth it kept adding until we got seven things and the seventh one was love which is god and that is how he makes the individual and caps him and see them in the holy spirit if that be so he's got seven two changes because why you look back and see that's where they had your seven ages so you have seven ages watch and then he has been had seven mysteries have been sung on the way and they fought for to bring back and the heads don't come to cap that off does it turn doesn't mean that my bedroom of course does it means just that what they fought for you come to bring back what have we become channels of god that you can say there's my spirit fallen freely your flesh man is out of the way oh glory to god hallelujah praise god and the way god is expecting us as individuals to grow the way he has brought his church in to grow every church age amen these fellows watch okay these fellows was required what these fellows are that was required on orcas he brought his church up the same way he's bringing his people up peter said here first seven things fate virtue see knowledge temperance patience godness brotherly love and brighter love than the love of god the holy ghost christ here we go in the person of the holy ghost comes upon you in the true baptism of the holy ghost and you got all these virtues sealed into you then god lives in a tabernacle called the building the living tabernacle of the living gods dwelling place my and when a man possesses these kind of things then the holy ghost comes upon him we're not talking about the anointing you know or atmosphere no the person of christ and that was so much upon the prophet that they thought he was jesus christ because he was manifested in christ and that's why he said the world will bow on at the feet of men and women who cross journal why because they'll be manifesting jesus christ you pray and god answers prayer god and and pray everybody know god answer your prayer that's why they're lying up in front of your house because they want to be prayed for because they know god is answering your prayer hallelujah they know that's a man of god that's a woman of god if anybody praying all kind of people will come to be prayed for you know you mean there's a prophecy yes you mean over your prophet saying yes we have to already come from the word almost prophesied again [Laughter] oh glory that god people will be coming to be prayed for oh glory to god a lot of action with brother branham wasn't in church you know it was out of the church one time he left a meeting and a woman come late for the prayer and she said show me where you walk and i go walk and be healed then show me where the man walk and i go walk and i'm going to be healed oh give the lord some praises and deep call to the deep when the woman coming up there and she comes she just bounced back he said that's just his presence he said come that man surrounded with the atmosphere you think the devil could just behave so human being bouncing off of that do you think devils could just come up and just do anything like that then they get permission permission please let it get approval to come further than that or give the lord a shout what do you think the bride's going to have [Applause] you ever hear with martin thomas george martin one of them the time to some tree for the tree to fall on him i think they cut down the tree tree to fall on him you cheat you treat him right back and hit them you talk about anointing god the fellas was fearless you know god was with them you know man riding with horse and child horse break down or get break foot or something so man layers up on this horse horse foot get back heal that thing and continue right now do you believe these kind of things oh hallelujah oh god hallelujah she has took five loaves are better than two fishes and feeding multitude how do you like to be a cj's breaking breaking breaking breaking and bread multiplying without even looking and seeing multiplying this is what we still be talking about oh music come on please watch there are seven qualifications to make the statue of god there are seven churches that god has brought the church to disqualification and he had seven messengers to do it there were seven seven seven seven seven is god's number of completion oh glory to god make a call in an election sure still yourself up you have sat down for long you have heard for long and i don't know what will motivate some of you to get up from that slutful position yeah where you just take things for granted we taking your money for granted otherwise i'm not wishing somebody was just so dead they are serious because they're not in the atm they're not they're not present for atmosphere they want somebody to tell them things and the more things they hear the longer it is the better but listen to this proverbs 21 25 as we wrap up here the desire of this thoughtful killed him for his hands refuse to labor all your desires god i want a house i want that car but he ain't working at all said killing him he had plenty ambition but his hands snoring sleeping away i went for verse 24 i went to the field of destructful and by the vineyard of a man void of understanding and lo it was all grown up with torns nettles had covered the face thereof and the stone wall thereof was broken down then i saw and considered it well i looked upon it and received instructions yet a little sleep a little slumber a little fallen of the hands to sleep so shall i poverty come as one that travel it and i want as an our man hebrew six for god is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which you have shown to watch his name in that you have ministered to the saints have you ministered to the saints and do minister and we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope under the end that you be not thoughtful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises for when god made promise to abraham because he could swear by no greater he swayed by himself saying surely i will multiply thee so after he patiently endured he obtained the promise oh my hallelujah aram says usually it takes a state of emergency to show the church into desperation it's too bad it has to do that but the human beings are so stressful in their mind it takes an emergency and it's true sometimes you just need something to spark you off oh god help us help us as a people oh my oh my in a time of death i've heard people when they know they were dying the things they would keep secret all their life in desperation they were trying to confess it and try and take this and make it right and in desperation they ought to have done that beforehand not wait for emergency desperation when the wife was about to die with cancer he knew that god would heal her and if god could heal the wife god can heal the boy and it shows you into desperation when you must come when you're desperate then god is going to listen to you and if you are just thoughtful you don't care whether he does or not well that's different see and i believe that's the reason we don't have

in control father we have seen so many requests become notes of praise and lord we are so blessed by the service this morning and how you express your love to us through your word lord with a clear lord picture of your word is life to us lord and that father we have a responsibility to make our calling and the election sure we have to be able to give an answer we must be able to give an account we must be able to stand up lord in the face of our journey lord and be able to say we did what we should have done lord so father we come this morning lord as your word teaches us to do lord to bring requests before your throne and lord these these requests father from brother pop well for his grandmother who is sick lord at the holy ghost at the presence of the lord that the angel of the lord will walk into that room where she is right now and he would touch her from the crown of her head to the soles of her feet and if she does not know you may she come to know you lord by experience and by revelation of your wonder working power so father may this request become a note of praise and lord for our sister doreen who is experiencing body pains and swollen feet may the angel of the lord walk into that room where she is right now and may you touch her also from the crown of the head to the souls of her feet and may you bring a complete healing to her father and lord we want to remember sister over in a special way and lord the family lord all of the siblings and the loved ones lord and the grandchildren the great grandchildren everyone connected lord that father you would comfort us all at this time and you would be with us lord and father we yield ourselves to your purpose and for your will so father we commit what would happen next into your hands completely and lord god father for the church lord for anyone who has a request that was not expressed was not written was not discussed father but you know the thoughts and the hearts of your people so father lord may you minister to your sons and your daughters lord those that are here in the sanctuary those that are connected on the internet and those that would hear the tape as well father may we be burning in our hearts lord because we know that time is running out lord we see time blending into eternity and most importantly we want to be ready lord help us to be ready lord every service brings us closer to believe in this place so lord may you bless lord the service is coming tuesday the service on wednesday the service is friday and this coming sunday may you be with your people in their jobs lord

give notice of that um as well so may the lord richly bless you stay in the presence of the lord stay in the spirit of the lord and practice the presence of the lord it's one of the best advice i've given to young people over the years it's a simple piece of advice if jesus is next to you how would you speak what would you do where would you go how would you sing what would you say because he is not just next to you but he wants to move from being conscious of you and you conscious of him to him being on the inside of you and really seated in that control tower of your heart amen is that how you feel this morning so may the lord rich you bless you have a wonderful week god bless you [Music] glory to god amen as joshua's come get ready to dismiss you god bless you [Music] you jesus i wanna
