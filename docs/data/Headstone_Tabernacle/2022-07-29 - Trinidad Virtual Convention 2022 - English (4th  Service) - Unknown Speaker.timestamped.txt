[24:44] may god bless you
[24:49] [Music]
[24:53] greetings to the convention and god
[24:55] bless you all it's certainly a great
[24:56] privilege and an honor to be able to
[24:59] speak to the purchase of the blood of
[25:01] jesus christ
[25:02] and i know that you have been blessed
[25:04] thus far with the convention and we are
[25:06] so happy to be able to come together in
[25:09] this way and at this time around this
[25:12] great inspiration of preparation for the
[25:15] battle you know and
[25:16] no doubt you would have heard it echoed
[25:18] through the different services and here
[25:20] we are again tonight for another round
[25:23] or today depending on what time zone
[25:25] you're in to spend time in the presence
[25:28] of the lord and this thought of
[25:30] preparing for the battle is such a
[25:32] blessing to me because so many of us we
[25:34] could look back and speak about the
[25:36] battles that we have had and here we are
[25:38] speaking about preparing for more
[25:40] battles you know and and that's the way
[25:42] it is because there's a great coming
[25:45] together for a great final battle for a
[25:48] great final climax you know
[25:50] so god bless you to all of the ministers
[25:53] all of the churches all of the brothers
[25:56] who have greeted those from far and wide
[25:58] those who are connected live those who
[26:00] would hear it on the on the different
[26:02] connections we certainly appreciate
[26:04] you being a part of this and
[26:07] i'm here tonight just to say a few words
[26:09] before our speaker
[26:11] because he's going to be speaking to us
[26:13] and many of us would
[26:15] may not have heard him before but i know
[26:17] he's going to be a blessing
[26:18] to you
[26:19] he's an inspiration to me and you know i
[26:22] really want to encourage the young
[26:24] people
[26:25] um with this because so many times you
[26:28] try to maintain a balance
[26:30] you know with your spiritual testimony
[26:32] and being able to maintain that
[26:34] testimony in your job in your school in
[26:36] your home and it is not an easy thing
[26:39] but it is possible you know so i want to
[26:41] really encourage you that there's also a
[26:43] battle that's raging on your job in your
[26:45] home in your daily life and you also
[26:48] have to prepare for that battle and it's
[26:50] an encouraging thing when we can see
[26:52] people who are able to maintain a
[26:55] christian walk
[26:56] uh both within the church and outside of
[26:59] the church and you know tonight we felt
[27:01] led to invite our precious brother
[27:03] cosmos maduka to speak to us in this
[27:07] convention
[27:08] you know and for those who
[27:10] don't know him he you know is based in
[27:12] brother oluse church in nigeria and he's
[27:15] such an inspiration i remember being
[27:18] very young i think it was in 1996 i
[27:20] would have first met
[27:22] brother cosmos and over the years gotten
[27:24] to know him better and better and it was
[27:27] in enugu 2015 i had the opportunity to
[27:30] speak
[27:31] share service with him dedicated to the
[27:34] young people
[27:35] and brother maduka has a real testimony
[27:39] he has been very successful in life and
[27:41] in business and what is most notable
[27:44] about it is he has maintained his walk
[27:46] with the lord
[27:47] and that i have seen been a real
[27:49] challenge for many
[27:51] young and old the moment they begin to
[27:53] experience some level of success
[27:56] in the natural their walk with the lord
[27:58] becomes threatened but not by the meduka
[28:01] he has maintained a testimony he has
[28:04] maintained a level of humility in his
[28:07] worship in the way he conducts his
[28:09] affairs and it is not something that he
[28:12] was born with or entitled to it is
[28:14] something that he worked hard at both
[28:16] his natural and his spiritual work
[28:18] you know he was born into poverty and at
[28:21] a very early age around six years or so
[28:24] when he was six years old his father
[28:25] would have passed away and he would have
[28:27] had to leave school to be able to help
[28:29] with the family and
[28:31] failure after failure and battle after
[28:33] battle
[28:34] you know he was
[28:36] selling on the street and so many
[28:37] different things as part of his
[28:38] testimony and then he met the lord in
[28:40] his early teenage years and in that
[28:43] process he met this message of the hour
[28:46] that has been an anchor for him both in
[28:48] the spiritual and also in the natural as
[28:52] well and he has been able by the grace
[28:54] of the lord and only with the lord's
[28:56] help
[28:57] to successfully combine
[28:59] high-stakes business with an equally
[29:02] committed christian life for decades his
[29:06] is not a testimony of one year or two
[29:08] years but year after year being able to
[29:12] be present both in business and still
[29:15] not compromise this truth of this great
[29:17] message of the hour and i believe that
[29:21] he is going to be able to share
[29:22] something with us and be able to bless
[29:24] us in a way that i trust that you will
[29:26] be very receptive and responsive to the
[29:29] word as he brings it as he brings it
[29:31] from a very seasoned experience
[29:33] perspective that will be a resounding
[29:35] blessing to us so we are so happy that
[29:38] he accepted the invitation to speak to
[29:40] us and join us in welcoming him to the
[29:43] pulpit as he brings the word tonight so
[29:46] brother maduka may god richly bless you
[29:48] brother thank you for sharing uh this
[29:50] with us and may the lord richly bless
[29:53] you
[29:56] oh
[29:58] it's an honor and a real privilege for
[30:01] me to be called upon
[30:03] by god's servant and precious brother
[30:06] jovid
[30:08] and the trinidad
[30:10] headstone ministry
[30:13] to
[30:13] put my shoulder to the wheel and say a
[30:15] few things to the bride of christ around
[30:17] the world
[30:19] and
[30:21] what a blessing it has been for me you
[30:23] know i i
[30:24] feel really small humble to be standing
[30:28] in this position of responsibility
[30:31] because um you know
[30:33] it takes the grace of god i am nervous
[30:37] and i ask you to pray for me this
[30:38] morning i'm trusting god
[30:41] that he will speak to us that's why i
[30:43] sing that song you know
[30:46] i want to thank other ministers that
[30:48] have gone ahead of me or those coming
[30:50] behind me
[30:52] who it fell on their lord to be able to
[30:55] bring a message to praise the bride of
[30:57] christ
[30:59] the theme for this convention is
[31:01] preparation for battle hallelujah
[31:06] why yes
[31:07] you got to get ready
[31:10] because there's a battle coming on
[31:13] i've taken a title
[31:15] to support this team and my title is
[31:18] preparation time
[31:20] hallelujah
[31:22] you gotta get ready there's something
[31:24] you gotta do
[31:26] because you don't want the battle to
[31:27] take you unaware
[31:29] if you do not prepare it will take you

[41:13] a real pastor is not motivated by crowd
[41:15] though all these churches were there
[41:17] thinking that when people are too many
[41:19] then you know the holy ghost is there
[41:20] it's not true

[41:25] are you like the other people
[41:27] won't you also go away what are you
[41:30] doing here hallelujah
[41:33] prophet told us that the true pastor is
[41:36] suspicious
[41:38] he's a shepherd he shall spread every
[41:41] out of your move to know whether your
[41:44] motive is right
[41:47] he said i want to go away
[41:52] and then we are looking is it
[41:55] if you are like other people please go
[41:58] the prophet said the only person i don't
[42:01] want to leave is the holy spirit any
[42:04] other person can go
[42:08] when he threw that challenge upon them
[42:10] they were looking
[42:13] and he said
[42:14] let me tell you now
[42:16] we don't have any bread to give you
[42:18] anymore
[42:19] now you are going to eat my flesh
[42:22] we need to know how sincere you are
[42:25] there is no coca-cola or seven or for
[42:27] fanta to drink

[42:56] are you in this for real
[42:58] or you want to be a millionaire is it
[43:00] the julian that is motivating you
[43:03] some people go to church only to get

[43:26] fisherman is the best business in their
[43:28] village so peter owned a fishing company
[43:32] for those of you who think that god
[43:33] called you to be an entity no peter was
[43:35] doing well with his brother they owned a
[43:38] fishing business hallelujah
[43:42] peter said we've done very well in our
[43:44] business

[43:58] beings hallelujah

[45:02] them and you thought that the jesus the
[45:05] lord did not know judas he knew him
[45:07] he knew he was a thief
[45:09] and he still made him threaten off his
[45:11] church
[45:13] the man stole money from the church
[45:16] until
[45:17] that morning the mundane little bit
[45:18] decided to serve the master himself
[45:21] [Music]
[45:23] hallelujah
[45:25] we are in for business this morning
[45:28] let us get your scripture
[45:30] revelation chapter 12.
[45:38] revelation chapter 12
[45:40] verse 7 to 9.
[45:42] and there was a war in heaven
[45:45] hallelujah
[45:47] michael and his angels fought
[45:50] against the dragon and the dragon fought
[45:54] and his angel
[45:56] and prevailed not
[45:58] neither was there a place found anymore
[46:01] in heaven
[46:03] and the great dragon
[46:05] was cast out the old serpent called the
[46:08] devil
[46:10] and satan which decided the whole world
[46:14] he was cast out into the earth and his
[46:18] angels were cast out with him
[46:21] let's hear the prophet the greatest
[46:22] battle ever fought
[46:24] 1962 march 11
[46:26] paragraph 60 and so
[46:29] an army
[46:30] first
[46:32] in getting ready for a battle
[46:34] please you may be seated sorry
[46:37] to give you standing i'm so sorry
[46:41] amen
[46:44] first there got to be a select as
[46:47] selection
[46:49] some
[46:50] soldiers
[46:51] they got to be
[46:53] dressed
[46:54] for fighting that means you got to wear
[46:57] the government for war you don't wear
[46:59] baby girl to do this battle
[47:02] amen
[47:03] some people don't know what is the
[47:04] bangladega we call it parachute the kind
[47:07] of
[47:07] african dress
[47:12] they have
[47:13] big wing
[47:14] they got to be trained for fighting
[47:17] and i believe the greatest battle that
[47:20] was ever fought
[47:22] is now ready to go in action
[47:25] i believe that god has been selecting
[47:28] his soldiers
[47:31] this great
[47:33] first battle
[47:34] that was ever fought began in heaven
[47:37] when my call and his angel fought
[47:40] against lucifer and his angel
[47:43] it started the first battle was in
[47:45] heaven so sin
[47:48] did not originate on the earth it
[47:50] originated in heaven
[47:52] paragraph 63 and then it was shown
[47:56] thrown down from heaven and cast out
[47:58] from heaven to the earth and it fell on
[48:02] human beings then the battle
[48:05] from the angel became human battles
[48:08] and satan came to destroy god's creation
[48:12] what god has created
[48:15] to be for himself
[48:18] god did not create you to be for
[48:20] yourself
[48:21] god created you to be for himself
[48:24] hallelujah
[48:27] that's why satan is jealous
[48:31] he heard satan attempt to destroy this
[48:34] it is
[48:35] it is the order of the day
[48:39] to let the people
[48:42] positionally
[48:43] find their place
[48:45] and be ready for the hour of battle
[48:49] i believe
[48:50] he's
[48:51] been dressing them
[48:54] training them and the battle
[48:57] is
[48:57] the battle front is now set
[49:01] getting ready to start
[49:03] that's what the purpose was was to
[49:06] destroy it
[49:07] then the battle began here on earth and
[49:11] began in us
[49:12] and had been raging ever since so stop
[49:16] wondering
[49:18] why are you having mine battle
[49:20] the battle became urban battle and they
[49:23] started not it's no more in heaven
[49:26] elijah and elijah 1954 march 4. frankly
[49:30] you don't have to come up here
[49:34] you just have to have faith
[49:37] where you are sitting
[49:40] god
[49:41] takes care of the rest
[49:43] doesn't he
[49:44] and i say he does
[49:46] amen
[49:47] you prayed for me tonight the prophet
[49:50] said and i said this morning
[49:52] i am the one who really needs prayer
[49:55] not for sickness
[49:57] i am very thankful for that but i need
[50:00] prayer while i'm trying to minister
[50:02] to the others if you just realize what
[50:06] an
[50:07] opposition there is when you spiritual
[50:10] power that encloses around a person when
[50:14] you are speaking of christ
[50:16] and especially in a way of bringing the
[50:19] world or making the world manifest to
[50:22] the people that's the thing
[50:24] when the world is big when they when the
[50:27] world
[50:28] just preaching the world hallelujah
[50:31] amen
[50:33] time tested first
[50:36] 1958 may 13
[50:39] no man has the right
[50:41] to take the pulpit to preach the gospel
[50:45] unless he has been in the backside of
[50:47] the desert
[50:49] no man no person has the right
[50:52] to call themselves christians it's not
[50:54] only made for the preacher
[50:56] no man has the right to call himself a
[50:58] christian
[50:59] until he has a backside of the desert
[51:01] experience
[51:02] it is still the backside of the desert
[51:05] we call upper room
[51:07] but it is still the back side of the
[51:09] desert too is where you meet god
[51:14] god call man 1958
[51:16] and before you can have this revival
[51:19] god has to call out
[51:22] man god has to call out and train men
[51:26] god trained men
[51:27] to carry this message
[51:30] they don't care what the opposition is
[51:33] they are willing to go to the fire
[51:36] furnace in defeat or in the lion's den
[51:40] or whatever it may be
[51:43] they are ready to go because they have
[51:46] been in the presence of god
[51:48] that's why i tell you we need this
[51:50] presence we can't go without his
[51:52] presence
[51:53] they have been in the presence of god
[51:56] and know that he is
[51:58] whether it is perfect whether it's to
[52:01] victory or defeat they still stand the
[52:04] same
[52:05] that's the kind of training god does to
[52:08] a man
[52:09] and that is very strange to think that
[52:12] god will do that
[52:14] that god's strength
[52:15] his men like that what he does
[52:18] hallelujah
[52:20] you know we have an old song
[52:24] that we sing
[52:25] some through the water
[52:28] some through the flood summed through
[52:31] debt trials but all through the blood
[52:35] hallelujah
[52:37] god leads his people
[52:40] through great trials
[52:42] to punch them
[52:43] sometimes it takes years to do that
[52:48] because you are never promoted until you
[52:50] are overqualified hallelujah
[52:55] god never takes you to another level you
[52:58] got to be over-qualified
[53:00] when is training you the children of
[53:02] israel was 40 days journey but they
[53:04] missed it and 40 days become 40 years
[53:08] the prophet says sometimes it takes
[53:09] years but god is waiting whether you
[53:12] learn the lesson
[53:13] let me read it again
[53:16] hallelujah
[53:18] god leads his people through great
[53:20] trials to push them
[53:22] sometimes it takes years to do it
[53:25] and as for myself tonight
[53:28] i believe that's right
[53:30] now god is training such men
[53:33] to meet the front line
[53:35] men who are
[53:38] going through
[53:39] and time
[53:40] shook off their feet sometimes it looks
[53:43] like the whole thing is falling but yet
[53:47] in the midst of it all they
[53:49] know
[53:50] that they are leaving god they keep
[53:52] their face forward they keep moving
[53:55] hallelujah
[53:57] sometimes it looks like the whole thing
[53:59] is falling

[56:02] whatsoever you plan to do
[56:04] and your plan will succeed
[56:06] wow
[56:08] whatever
[56:09] whatever you plan to do
[56:12] commit it to the lord
[56:14] i need to succeed
[56:16] god built success in everything that he
[56:19] created
[56:21] if the thing god created did not succeed
[56:25] god's reputation is at stake
[56:29] then he said
[56:32] the way to describe his name's sake is
[56:34] not for you but for god's name's sake
[56:38] the manufacturers make a product
[56:41] to succeed
[56:43] they don't put their name on a product
[56:46] if they are not convinced that product
[56:47] will succeed hallelujah because if the
[56:50] product fell their reputation is wrong

[1:05:47] bride so we can go out and paint you
[1:05:49] will not abuse that knowledge anymore
[1:05:52] what god will do in you this year will
[1:05:54] be permanent
[1:05:56] in jesus name
[1:06:00] repentance
[1:06:02] and prayer
[1:06:03] and fasting must come
[1:06:05] before restoration
[1:06:08] ii chronicles 7 14
[1:06:10] if my people which are called by my name
[1:06:12] will humble themselves and pray
[1:06:14] i will hear from heaven
[1:06:17] and
[1:06:18] heal forgive their sins and i will heal
[1:06:22] their land
[1:06:23] prayer and fasting open the way for
[1:06:26] forgiveness
[1:06:27] blessing and resurrection
[1:06:29] if we are going to claim the promises
[1:06:31] and blessing of god
[1:06:34] for restoration
[1:06:36] and
[1:06:38] an outpouring of his spirit we must
[1:06:41] fulfill the condition god set forth
[1:06:44] there must be first
[1:06:46] a brokenness
[1:06:49] humbling
[1:06:51] breaking our spiritual pride
[1:06:54] and self-righteousness
[1:06:56] through fasting and prayer
[1:06:58] someone 103 verse 7
[1:07:02] he made known his way to moses
[1:07:05] but his heart to the children of israel
[1:07:08] the children of israel wanted the power
[1:07:10] of god that's what is going on today in
[1:07:13] church people are looking for signs and
[1:07:15] wonder jump from one church to another
[1:07:18] looking for it but that was not moses
[1:07:21] preoccupation
[1:07:22] moses preoccupation is to know the mind
[1:07:25] of god
[1:07:26] when you know the mind of god you know
[1:07:27] the way of god and when you know the
[1:07:30] word of god everything will line up
[1:07:33] the children of israel know the power of
[1:07:36] god but moses is not the mind of god the
[1:07:38] word of god it is not about
[1:07:43] the
[1:07:44] hand of god
[1:07:46] his power
[1:07:48] but the mind of god
[1:07:50] that god sent to us in this age through
[1:07:53] his prophet messenger to develop
[1:07:55] intimacy of a relationship
[1:07:58] many of us christians today still look
[1:08:01] on the surface
[1:08:02] the outward manifestation of god's power
[1:08:05] as an indicator or sign of great
[1:08:08] heartburn
[1:08:09] god has promised
[1:08:11] however the real sign
[1:08:13] will be when i close the nations of the
[1:08:16] earth the people of god begin to fall on
[1:08:18] their faces before god to repent to
[1:08:22] confess their sins before god and come
[1:08:25] one another begin to turn from their
[1:08:28] sins that we have allowed to come into
[1:08:30] the church
[1:08:31] another major indicator of this great
[1:08:34] outpouring of the holy spirit would be a
[1:08:37] major move of christians from different
[1:08:40] churches around the unit
[1:08:43] around
[1:08:44] the different churches towards unity in
[1:08:47] the spirit when we begin see christians
[1:08:50] leaders coming together in new unity
[1:08:53] you will know
[1:08:55] it is a sign for the great outpouring
[1:08:58] god has promised at this end time after
[1:09:01] god's people begin to fast and pray then
[1:09:04] we lie here and heal them be jealous for
[1:09:08] their land and pity the people 12-28
[1:09:12] after god's people have begin to weep
[1:09:15] among and repent
[1:09:18] will come a time of great rejoicing for
[1:09:21] the lord will do great things
[1:09:24] 12-21
[1:09:26] after god's people begin to fast and
[1:09:28] pray and repent then will heaven open
[1:09:32] and god will pour out the former and
[1:09:34] later land the holy spirit will pour out
[1:09:37] upon all flesh
[1:09:40] 12-23-28 after god's people humble
[1:09:43] themselves through time of fasting and
[1:09:46] prayer then will come the promise of
[1:09:49] restoration god will restore
[1:09:52] all things satan has stolen then we will
[1:09:55] come
[1:09:56] to an abundance
[1:09:58] then god's people will be satisfied
[1:10:02] 12-24-27
[1:10:04] amen
[1:10:06] what are the circumstances that we are
[1:10:08] facing now
[1:10:09] are there situations in your life which
[1:10:12] you must hear from god
[1:10:14] which
[1:10:15] you just don't know what to do
[1:10:18] even how to pray
[1:10:20] don't
[1:10:21] be willing
[1:10:23] pick up
[1:10:24] your weapon
[1:10:25] fight
[1:10:26] pick up the weapon of your prayer and
[1:10:28] fast fasting
[1:10:30] my advice
[1:10:31] is what we have seen
[1:10:34] what is going on today is what the
[1:10:37] prophet told us in 1962 july 22nd
[1:10:42] a message titled show us the father and
[1:10:45] it will suffice us
[1:10:47] the prophet said
[1:10:48] and when we take the promise
[1:10:52] we take the promise every promise we
[1:10:55] find here
[1:10:57] drop in our heart
[1:11:00] we keep watering it
[1:11:03] when you water it it will carry weight
[1:11:06] and they will drop inside your soul
[1:11:09] hallelujah
[1:11:11] keep watering it
[1:11:14] it keeps pushing out
[1:11:17] hallelujah
[1:11:19] when christ is planted in our heart the
[1:11:22] holy ghost
[1:11:24] the only thing to do is drink
[1:11:28] that's why we come to drink this morning
[1:11:31] at that great day
[1:11:33] the great day of the feast
[1:11:35] jesus christ
[1:11:37] if anyone does
[1:11:40] is anybody testing this morning
[1:11:42] come unto me
[1:11:44] to drink
[1:11:45] it's not a well
[1:11:47] a bubble
[1:11:48] bible say out of him
[1:11:51] shall flow it has current
[1:11:55] rivers of the living water
[1:11:57] it will wash out the crash
[1:12:02] it will push out salvation
[1:12:05] it will push out divine healing it will
[1:12:08] push out
[1:12:09] glory
[1:12:10] it will push out everything that we have
[1:12:13] need of
[1:12:14] right in us
[1:12:16] when we are planted in christ
[1:12:18] thus says the prophet
[1:12:21] you alive at the are you at the point in
[1:12:23] your life that it seems that heaven is
[1:12:26] at blast
[1:12:27] that god has forgotten you that he has
[1:12:30] not had your cry for help
[1:12:33] do not give up
[1:12:35] it's not the time to surrender
[1:12:37] do not listen to certain lies
[1:12:39] because it's the father of lie
[1:12:41] pick up your weapon of prayer and
[1:12:44] fasting
[1:12:45] use them fight back
[1:12:47] take your victory
[1:12:50] is there a growing hunger in your heart
[1:12:52] to know christ
[1:12:54] in all his fullness and be conformed to
[1:12:56] his image
[1:12:58] to
[1:12:59] draw into a closer relationship with him
[1:13:02] pick up your weapon
[1:13:04] of prayer and fasting and use them
[1:13:08] i am a great believer
[1:13:10] that there is nothing like a self-made
[1:13:13] person
[1:13:14] you can make yourself if god do not make
[1:13:16] you
[1:13:17] no self-made man or self-made woman
[1:13:19] but we must be willing to fight back
[1:13:22] to take what god has promised us
[1:13:26] genesis 1 26-28
[1:13:29] be fruitful
[1:13:31] it's a command on your potential
[1:13:34] be

[1:13:47] i say therefore
[1:13:48] that we have all things
[1:13:51] that we require
[1:13:52] to be a great christian in this last day
[1:13:55] to create another world around us like
[1:13:59] little really push
[1:14:01] don't give up push
[1:14:03] like joshua we have to fight
[1:14:06] because we have
[1:14:08] been prepared by the world to take the
[1:14:11] battle
[1:14:12] the prophet advice
[1:14:14] and believers thou this
[1:14:16] june 4.
[1:14:20] i am
[1:14:21] in the vine ye are the branches
[1:14:24] if a grape vine put forth a shot
[1:14:29] it comes out
[1:14:30] with pretty blue grapes
[1:14:33] the next vine
[1:14:35] it brings out will be pretty blue grapes
[1:14:38] on it
[1:14:39] if the first vine come out and it falls
[1:14:42] under the impact of the holy spirit and
[1:14:45] they did great miracles and signs
[1:14:49] and sealed their testimony
[1:14:51] to the world
[1:14:54] even many of them
[1:14:56] with their own testimony with their own
[1:14:59] blood they sealed their testimony
[1:15:02] then went through all kind of pearls and
[1:15:06] everything to bring the gospel
[1:15:09] they suffered they were beaten they were
[1:15:13] punished must we
[1:15:15] carry home
[1:15:16] to heaven
[1:15:18] on a flat bed of ease
[1:15:20] while others fought to win the prize
[1:15:24] and seal their blood
[1:15:27] and and sell through the bloody stream
[1:15:31] what do we do the prophet i ask
[1:15:34] what do we do
[1:15:36] i must fight
[1:15:39] i must reign
[1:15:41] increase my courage lord
[1:15:44] that's the prophet prayer
[1:15:47] we don't need a new denomination
[1:15:49] certainly not
[1:15:51] we don't need a new church building
[1:15:54] what we need today is an old blackwood
[1:15:58] sin blue
[1:16:00] sin killing pentecostal revival
[1:16:03] that was born at pentecost
[1:16:06] and that is back to the church again the
[1:16:10] power of the holy ghost again to bring
[1:16:12] jesus christ on the scene
[1:16:14] hallelujah
[1:16:16] you can never enter into a future church
[1:16:19] that you did not create because you're a
[1:16:21] little creator
[1:16:23] you don't need
[1:16:26] you you never walk into success by
[1:16:29] accident
[1:16:31] you can't live by
[1:16:32] luck it's not your promise there's a
[1:16:35] promise that you live in
[1:16:37] in the spiritual international they will
[1:16:40] take in principle of intentional living
[1:16:44] you have to be
[1:16:45] persistent
[1:16:47] passionate
[1:16:48] about your future
[1:16:50] because a passion is the fuel to the
[1:16:54] will
[1:16:54] whenever a man or a woman is passionate
[1:16:58] about the things you want to accomplish
[1:17:00] you will find the willpower to do it
[1:17:03] amen

[1:18:04] fate okay i think i finished the quote
[1:18:06] unquote
[1:18:07] please note that faith is awakening of
[1:18:11] our consciousness
[1:18:13] and deliberate effort which helps you to
[1:18:15] see the end of your journey
[1:18:19] even though you may not know all the
[1:18:21] route that was going to take you there
[1:18:23] but visualizing the end of the journey
[1:18:26] you have a compass to see what
[1:18:28] collaborate with your faith and the
[1:18:29] other things that you need to cut off in
[1:18:31] your life
[1:18:33] now let me begin to wind down on the
[1:18:35] power of preparation and change
[1:18:38] i want to focus in a few minutes on
[1:18:40] understanding the principle of planning
[1:18:43] preparation and
[1:18:46] planning and preparation and how if that
[1:18:48] relates to strategic thinking
[1:18:51] i'm talking to young people
[1:18:53] around the world not only here
[1:18:57] you don't just say i want to be a doctor
[1:19:00] you're an elective thinking click in how
[1:19:04] how
[1:19:06] you don't become because you say i want
[1:19:08] to how
[1:19:10] then that american thing can begin to
[1:19:12] tell you
[1:19:13] you need some science subject
[1:19:15] and you know what they are it doesn't
[1:19:17] mean you have it but you begin to walk
[1:19:19] towards it this is the way it happens
[1:19:21] spiritual i want to be like jesus how
[1:19:25] let's say now a village
[1:19:27] a market that is very close to church
[1:19:31] and all these denominational church
[1:19:33] members go to the market behave like the
[1:19:36] way they leak and the madman was
[1:19:37] watching them
[1:19:38] and they would go back to the church
[1:19:41] and they start
[1:19:42] reading
[1:19:43] apostles creed
[1:19:45] i believe in father i believe in god the
[1:19:48] only true father the one man who said by
[1:19:50] the window said form out
[1:19:59] i believe in the only true god the one
[1:20:01] who said form out
[1:20:03] will push him out they come back
[1:20:04] whatever they say the man will be saying
[1:20:06] from out
[1:20:08] you don't become from out
[1:20:11] hallelujah
[1:20:13] amen
[1:20:15] we got young people here today
[1:20:19] what plan do you have for your life
[1:20:22] don't forget my area scripture found
[1:20:26] in the book of proverbs
[1:20:28] 163 it says commit to the lord
[1:20:31] whatever you plan and it will succeed
[1:20:35] amen
[1:20:36] it's a promise to it
[1:20:40] young people listen to me
[1:20:42] you are very important to me
[1:20:44] and you are very important to this
[1:20:45] generation i am passionate about your
[1:20:48] future
[1:20:49] if you
[1:20:50] are below the age of 25
[1:20:53] you are very important for next year
[1:20:56] if you are between the age of 15 and 30
[1:20:59] i want you to bless up
[1:21:02] for a massive change
[1:21:04] if you are over 40 you are going to
[1:21:07] learn that the things you thought that
[1:21:09] were important
[1:21:12] the things you thought that were
[1:21:13] important
[1:21:16] though
[1:21:17] we are settled
[1:21:19] they are going to be shaken
[1:21:21] not in a negative way but in a positive
[1:21:23] way
[1:21:25] all we need to do is to follow us the
[1:21:27] message
[1:21:28] that god has sent to us
[1:21:30] to walk in the footsteps of jesus christ
[1:21:33] and embrace
[1:21:34] the cross despising the shame
[1:21:38] he went ahead
[1:21:40] to
[1:21:41] purchase us redemption for that is what
[1:21:44] the purpose is
[1:21:45] your life is not an experiment
[1:21:48] god is not about experimenting with your
[1:21:50] life
[1:21:52] god wouldn't have bring you if he had
[1:21:54] not finished you
[1:21:55] hallelujah
[1:21:58] but you've got to fight
[1:22:00] turn to your neighbor and say i am a
[1:22:03] finnish product
[1:22:06] tune to your neighbor and say i am on my
[1:22:09] way to be finished
[1:22:11] hallelujah
[1:22:13] i'm on my way to finish
[1:22:15] you are on your way brothers
[1:22:17] because that is what the purpose is
[1:22:20] everybody say purpose
[1:22:23] listen to me
[1:22:25] we don't have much time on this planet
[1:22:28] we have got a lot of work to do and we
[1:22:30] have to
[1:22:32] get millions of people here
[1:22:34] or billions of people around the world
[1:22:36] that we need to touch we have no time to
[1:22:40] continue to fumble the ball not anymore
[1:22:43] time wasted is over
[1:22:47] god
[1:22:48] in this meeting is demanding
[1:22:51] that the church stop being busy and
[1:22:53] start being effective
[1:22:55] the only way to be effective is to know
[1:22:58] the assignment
[1:22:59] it is sad
[1:23:01] to be taking exam that nobody said for
[1:23:03] you
[1:23:04] it is terrible to be successful
[1:23:08] in the wrong term
[1:23:09] it is a tragedy to win a race that we
[1:23:12] never asked to run
[1:23:16] fighting each other
[1:23:19] complaining
[1:23:20] about what is going wrong in your life
[1:23:24] without doing anything about it
[1:23:27] my concern is
[1:23:29] if a man or a woman
[1:23:31] does not know what he or she
[1:23:35] look for
[1:23:36] any wind will be the right one
[1:23:39] a man without a purpose is like a ship
[1:23:42] without a radar
[1:23:43] he just kept drifting drifting drifting
[1:23:48] though we are not distracted
[1:23:51] with that's why we are not distracted
[1:23:53] about what is going on don't waste your
[1:23:55] time with it
[1:23:57] we have a challenging message
[1:23:59] to follow
[1:24:00] we have something to preoccupy us don't
[1:24:04] let the devil give you another job
[1:24:07] and get you distracted
[1:24:09] let me tell you something friends
[1:24:12] if you don't know your purpose
[1:24:14] someone is going to give you dears
[1:24:17] if you don't know
[1:24:19] why where you are going any road will
[1:24:21] take you there the tragedy is that you
[1:24:24] wouldn't even know when you arrived
[1:24:27] god's goal
[1:24:28] in this season is maturity
[1:24:32] god is getting us ready for maturity as
[1:24:35] a matter of fact he's demanding it now
[1:24:41] it's been since
[1:24:42] 1956 or
[1:24:45] 1666 years it happened 55 or 60 years
[1:24:49] ago malachi 4 left this age
[1:24:52] if you take time to do a little
[1:24:55] examination about the church
[1:25:00] it's not something that is too exciting
[1:25:04] i mean the church world in the last 60
[1:25:07] years
[1:25:08] had
[1:25:09] had had an opportunity i've had an
[1:25:11] opportunity to do take this review and
[1:25:14] we've seen
[1:25:15] a bunch of excited group of people with
[1:25:18] no depth
[1:25:20] we got
[1:25:22] great anointing
[1:25:24] without character
[1:25:26] we got tremendous gifts with our
[1:25:29] standards
[1:25:31] we got power
[1:25:33] without principle
[1:25:36] we are flashy
[1:25:38] yet we don't have faith we got
[1:25:41] great posters
[1:25:43] and invite
[1:25:44] people for a meeting
[1:25:46] but fail to invite the presence of god
[1:25:50] we have a church that has become expert
[1:25:53] in setting up meetings but have
[1:25:55] difficulties meeting with god
[1:25:58] what
[1:25:59] god is demanding in this season is for
[1:26:02] us to take the diapers off hallelujah
[1:26:08] we can we upon pass at the age where we
[1:26:10] are
[1:26:11] listening to bully abraham paradigm 1963
[1:26:15] why
[1:26:17] this church ought to be a minimize up
[1:26:20] the road to where it is now
[1:26:23] jesus is waiting on the church to get
[1:26:25] ready the bride has made herself ready
[1:26:29] we've got the potential the holy spirit
[1:26:32] is here
[1:26:33] god is here the power
[1:26:36] to heal the sick the power to do things
[1:26:40] that christ did i have been i have seen
[1:26:43] it demonstrated
[1:26:44] myself
[1:26:45] by the holy spirit
[1:26:48] so the potential is here thus says the
[1:26:50] prophet
[1:26:51] he wants us to get rid
[1:26:54] of dampers powdered milk
[1:26:57] he is demanding that we act of age
[1:27:01] church
[1:27:02] the church should be fully grown
[1:27:05] to go and meet christ says the prophet
[1:27:08] i mean
[1:27:10] the church is almost 2000 years old
[1:27:13] and still gossiping
[1:27:16] by
[1:27:16] biting competing
[1:27:19] jerusalem one another 2 000 years old we
[1:27:23] are still
[1:27:24] hating one another comparing ourselves
[1:27:27] with each other
[1:27:29] as a matter of fact we are still
[1:27:31] prejudiced
[1:27:33] we still get all kind of internal
[1:27:36] jealousy and by biting
[1:27:39] it is horrible
[1:27:41] as a matter of fact the church is still
[1:27:44] in adolescent
[1:27:46] she had no breasts
[1:27:49] you didn't hear me i said the church is
[1:27:52] like a little girl
[1:27:53] she has no breasts
[1:27:55] the church word jesus isn't going to
[1:27:58] marry a little girl
[1:28:00] hallelujah
[1:28:04] church
[1:28:05] let's hear the prophet
[1:28:06] 1957.17
[1:28:09] the second coming of the lord so it is
[1:28:11] getting along towards the dark when she
[1:28:14] realized that she had lost everything
[1:28:18] time for her husband to come
[1:28:22] and is getting late
[1:28:24] the church
[1:28:25] better be examined
[1:28:27] has their serves
[1:28:28] by the word of god
[1:28:30] our purity
[1:28:32] our royalty our devotion
[1:28:35] will be contactless
[1:28:37] pelvis cigarette smoker by
[1:28:42] painted jezebel everything in the
[1:28:44] calendar that the rest of the world
[1:28:47] does the church is associated with those
[1:28:50] things
[1:28:51] today
[1:28:53] the church is associated with those
[1:28:54] things today till you can hardly tell
[1:28:57] one from the other it is time we take
[1:29:01] eventually
[1:29:03] it's getting late
[1:29:05] i'm going to tell you right now church
[1:29:08] unquote now god is demanding
[1:29:12] that we grow up church
[1:29:14] to the stature of a perfect man
[1:29:16] growing up means responsibility
[1:29:20] i'm getting to my inspiration now
[1:29:22] let somebody say
[1:29:24] take responsibility
[1:29:28] say it with me responsibility
[1:29:32] say it out responsibility
[1:29:35] a little louder responsibility
[1:29:39] one more time responsibility
[1:29:43] just a little louder
[1:29:47] that's what god is looking for
[1:29:51] church
[1:29:52] nothing is as desert nothing is as
[1:29:54] destructive as irresponsibility
[1:29:57] the most advised characteristic that beg
[1:30:01] our society
[1:30:03] worldwide today is that of
[1:30:05] irresponsibility
[1:30:07] irresponsibility is defined
[1:30:09] as not
[1:30:11] answerable to authority young people
[1:30:14] listen now
[1:30:16] lacking a sense of
[1:30:18] accountability unable to respond to
[1:30:21] conscience
[1:30:22] it also means flick
[1:30:26] filthy
[1:30:27] thoughtless rash
[1:30:30] undefendable
[1:30:32] unstable
[1:30:34] loose
[1:30:35] well
[1:30:36] a lot of charismatics are loose
[1:30:40] irresponsible people
[1:30:42] it means lack
[1:30:44] it means immoral
[1:30:46] people who worship on sunday morning
[1:30:50] and go out sleeping
[1:30:52] around on sunday night
[1:30:55] that's what is called loose
[1:30:59] irresponsible people
[1:31:01] we got a bunch in the church who are
[1:31:04] singing right now in the choir speaking
[1:31:06] in tongues
[1:31:07] and i mean
[1:31:09] be honest
[1:31:11] with you
[1:31:12] many
[1:31:14] cases i don't doubt their salvation
[1:31:18] just that they are irresponsible
[1:31:21] it also means
[1:31:23] on
[1:31:25] it also means
[1:31:26] unpredictable
[1:31:28] that's one of the things that
[1:31:29] responsibility means you can't predict
[1:31:32] them
[1:31:33] you don't know when they are going to
[1:31:35] stop out of the church
[1:31:36] the next time they are going to do that
[1:31:38] they don't care they are not answerable
[1:31:40] to anybody
[1:31:41] when they are going to leave the church
[1:31:43] no commitment to nobody no commitment to
[1:31:47] any vision they are irresponsible people
[1:31:52] it also means wild
[1:31:54] only liable
[1:31:56] untrustworthy
[1:31:58] i like this one it also means
[1:32:01] blame us
[1:32:04] let's hear the prophet again on the
[1:32:06] second coming of the lord
[1:32:08] let's read this prophet again oh
[1:32:12] if there was a time
[1:32:14] the church ought to take inventory to
[1:32:17] find out if she had got all the coin in
[1:32:21] it should be now
[1:32:22] is getting back
[1:32:24] the very
[1:32:28] is getting dark
[1:32:30] the very hunt and crowd of destruction
[1:32:33] destroying civilization is hanging on
[1:32:36] the earth
[1:32:38] same and they bought the bush on every
[1:32:42] every hand
[1:32:44] we are living in a tremendous time when
[1:32:46] there is wickedness wickedness
[1:32:50] people who go to church just for a
[1:32:52] chance
[1:32:53] people who go to church
[1:32:56] to try to hide from their meanness
[1:32:58] people who go to church and profess
[1:33:00] christianity and live like the rest of
[1:33:03] the world
[1:33:04] drinking smoking
[1:33:06] gambling some of them are in this you
[1:33:09] may be in this church playing nigel
[1:33:10] betty nigel

[1:33:25] drinking smoking gambling
[1:33:28] women immoral dress wearing clothes they
[1:33:32] ought not to wear in their dressing room
[1:33:35] out on the street before public
[1:33:39] broader love
[1:33:41] is a thing that's passing almost we have
[1:33:45] not lost one coin the prophet said we
[1:33:48] have practically lost every one of them
[1:33:52] and it was getting night remember her
[1:33:55] husband will return
[1:33:57] and if she finds one of this coin out
[1:34:00] it will
[1:34:01] show she has been marked a lot
[1:34:05] to be irresponsible means to transfer
[1:34:08] blame
[1:34:09] for your behavior
[1:34:11] to somebody else
[1:34:13] we have
[1:34:14] to fight
[1:34:16] to become
[1:34:17] responsible
[1:34:19] the entire world is suffering from this
[1:34:22] destructive influence of
[1:34:24] irresponsibility
[1:34:25] no one wants to take responsibility
[1:34:28] for their actions
[1:34:30] their decisions their situations their
[1:34:33] circumstances
[1:34:35] we become experts in blaming the past
[1:34:38] for our future
[1:34:39] we blame our teachers for we blame our
[1:34:44] parents for our bad habits
[1:34:47] we blame our teachers for our ignorance
[1:34:50] we blame our leaders for the way we
[1:34:53] follow them we blame sickness for our
[1:34:56] health we blame our children for our
[1:34:58] social problem they are our children
[1:35:02] we blame cigarette and tobacco campaign
[1:35:05] for our cancer we blame the government
[1:35:08] for our unemployment
[1:35:10] because we cannot find ingenuity within
[1:35:13] ourselves to be productive
[1:35:17] then the whole nation is suffering from
[1:35:19] poverty
[1:35:20] you get a brain
[1:35:22] between your head and neck with five
[1:35:24] billion cells
[1:35:26] you haven't used 10 percent of it
[1:35:28] there's something you can do with your
[1:35:31] hands that you don't need the government
[1:35:33] to give you a job
[1:35:35] tell your neighbour maximize yourself
[1:35:40] tell your neighbor deploy yourself
[1:35:44] say it again deploy yourself
[1:35:48] you see
[1:35:50] if you don't deploy yourself somebody
[1:35:52] else is going to deploy you
[1:35:54] and whichever employee will determine
[1:35:56] your what
[1:35:57] what you are paid
[1:35:59] i've decided many years ago that nobody
[1:36:02] can pay my watch
[1:36:04] so we blame the government for our
[1:36:06] unemployment
[1:36:07] we blame alcohol for our drunkenness we
[1:36:11] blame our wife for our worthiness we

[1:36:35] who believe that life owed them
[1:36:37] everything
[1:36:38] and everything

[1:41:54] the baptist is acting like the
[1:41:56] lieutenant the lutheran is acting like
[1:41:58] the catholic and is gone back to one
[1:42:01] great

[1:42:45] okay let me repeat it now she had a
[1:42:47] house cleaning time she's cropped the
[1:42:49] floor she swept the wall she took down
[1:42:53] the cobweb she kept on until she find
[1:42:56] what she has lost and when she did she
[1:42:59] called her little sister churches
[1:43:02] to come

[1:43:04] hallelujah
[1:43:06] i don't care

[1:43:12] pentecostal presbyterian
[1:43:16] come let us rejoice together
[1:43:19] when that time come
[1:43:22] future
[1:43:23] when the church finds his brother in
[1:43:25] love
[1:43:27] when the church finds his holy decency
[1:43:30] when the church finds his place in
[1:43:32] christ
[1:43:33] it calls to the other members of the
[1:43:36] body
[1:43:37] come and rejoice with us
[1:43:40] god wants his church
[1:43:42] to love him
[1:43:44] i'm winding down now
[1:43:47] to violate on quote to violence to
[1:43:50] worship
[1:43:52] is to be irresponsible
[1:43:56] so
[1:43:57] the criminals blame the society for his
[1:44:00] misbehavior
[1:44:02] it is not surprising we heard about a
[1:44:05] case in united states of america a guy
[1:44:08] that killed another guy
[1:44:10] and went to court and plead
[1:44:12] that the society made him that way
[1:44:15] that's the society we are living on it a
[1:44:18] young man
[1:44:19] that
[1:44:21] the community brought him up in a
[1:44:23] certain way and that's why he shot him
[1:44:26] now friends
[1:44:27] when you have transferred your behavior
[1:44:29] to the society
[1:44:32] that we live
[1:44:33] we are in trouble
[1:44:35] it also means
[1:44:38] we are not yet ready for the battle
[1:44:42] that is going on now
[1:44:44] we are a society of blamers
[1:44:48] the sinner blamed the hypocrite preacher
[1:44:51] for his domination
[1:44:54] see some young people say i don't come
[1:44:55] to that church again
[1:44:56] you people are a bunch of hypocrites
[1:44:58] please why not come and help us
[1:45:00] we need you we need your help you that
[1:45:02] is not hypocrites we need you
[1:45:05] please come
[1:45:07] we don't want you to go
[1:45:13] sinner
[1:45:14] blame hypocritical preachers for his
[1:45:17] domination
[1:45:20] think about that
[1:45:22] first of all i am not coming to church
[1:45:25] why those preachers are not good
[1:45:29] rather go to church for yourself
[1:45:32] don't worry about the preacher stop
[1:45:34] transforming your irresponsibility
[1:45:37] on another preacher
[1:45:38] the bible says work out your own
[1:45:40] salvation
[1:45:43] if the preacher wants to mess up let him
[1:45:46] mess up
[1:45:48] he says business with god and nothing
[1:45:50] with you
[1:45:51] but the question is where did the spirit
[1:45:54] of irresponsibility come from
[1:45:57] when did he enter the world and how did
[1:45:59] he come
[1:46:00] into our experience
[1:46:03] well we are going to find out in a few
[1:46:05] minutes
[1:46:06] and i'm closing
[1:46:08] can you quickly turn to genesis chapter
[1:46:10] one
[1:46:11] somewhere some great stuff
[1:46:14] is india this destructive spirit was
[1:46:17] first released
[1:46:19] in the garden of eden when the first man
[1:46:22] who carried all men inside his lungs
[1:46:25] violate his stewardship
[1:46:27] he was given trust and responsibility
[1:46:29] for the entire
[1:46:31] act
[1:46:32] and the world on it
[1:46:34] he was
[1:46:35] trusted with the responsibility to
[1:46:38] maintain the righteous standard of his
[1:46:41] creator god
[1:46:44] on the earth
[1:46:45] through obedience
[1:46:47] which is the highest form of reverence
[1:46:51] let's hear the prophet
[1:46:56] fate that was once delivered to the
[1:46:58] sense 1953
[1:47:00] now let's get back in genesis and pick
[1:47:03] up the beginning we find out everything
[1:47:06] that we got today originated in genesis
[1:47:10] genesis is the sixth chapter of the
[1:47:12] bible everything begins in genesis all
[1:47:14] right
[1:47:15] because genesis is the
[1:47:19] the word genesis means the beginning and
[1:47:21] it is the seed chapter where god saw his
[1:47:24] seed everything and the everyone saw his
[1:47:27] seed and god saw his seed and here the
[1:47:31] crops are coming up on the earth just
[1:47:34] exactly the way god says
[1:47:36] galatians 6 7 said be not deceived god
[1:47:40] is not mocked for whatsoever a man saw
[1:47:43] that shall he reap
[1:47:45] genesis 1 26 said then let us make man
[1:47:48] in our own image after our only life let
[1:47:50] them have dominion over the features of
[1:47:52] the sea over the fouls of the air and
[1:47:54] over the cattle and over all the earth
[1:47:57] and over every crippling things that
[1:47:59] creep into the earth so man was created
[1:48:02] to dominate the act the word dominate
[1:48:05] means to govern to control to manage and
[1:48:09] to have steel worship over
[1:48:11] that means
[1:48:13] he was responsible
[1:48:15] for the quality of life on the planet
[1:48:18] so
[1:48:20] he was
[1:48:21] trans he was therefore set up
[1:48:24] as a manager over god's property
[1:48:27] i want you to note here that god never
[1:48:31] give up ownership of this place
[1:48:34] he just gives us the management contract
[1:48:37] he's still the owner the earth is the
[1:48:40] lord and the fullness thereof
[1:48:42] so god
[1:48:44] sealed the honor of this planet but he
[1:48:47] gave men the management contract to man
[1:48:51] in genesis chapter 2 15 he told the man
[1:48:55] what to do with the planet to walk it
[1:48:58] cultivate it subdue it
[1:49:02] dominate it
[1:49:04] genesis chapter 3 god says
[1:49:07] that there
[1:49:09] god said that there was an irresponsible
[1:49:13] act
[1:49:15] this man
[1:49:17] took the trust and still worshipped and
[1:49:19] violated
[1:49:20] and end and he ended up in the hand of
[1:49:23] the unlawful illegal unemployed cherubim
[1:49:27] so here we see god's property
[1:49:31] being mismanaged and falling into the
[1:49:34] hands of diabolical abominable force of
[1:49:37] god lucifer
[1:49:39] in chapter 3 it says they fell and they
[1:49:43] destroyed
[1:49:45] it it says
[1:49:46] they fell and they destroyed
[1:49:49] destroyed and go and and and god they
[1:49:53] and and so they disobeyed god and they
[1:49:56] lost the management contract
[1:49:58] in chapter three somewhere something
[1:50:00] happened
[1:50:01] god came in and asked the man where are
[1:50:04] thou
[1:50:06] and here
[1:50:07] comes that interest of irresponsibility
[1:50:11] he transformed blame to somebody else
[1:50:15] adam said he said this woman you gave me
[1:50:21] is the cause of all this problem
[1:50:24] she came out of you
[1:50:27] how can you blame your offspring for
[1:50:29] your misbehavior
[1:50:31] that's why god ignored that statement he
[1:50:34] didn't listen to adam
[1:50:36] when
[1:50:36] trouble fell upon humanity god never
[1:50:39] went to the woman
[1:50:41] he went to the man
[1:50:43] he went to the source
[1:50:45] he said we are a dao
[1:50:47] he was not a question of location it is
[1:50:50] a question of disposition
[1:50:53] the prophet said the church had no more
[1:50:57] conscience
[1:50:58] the church better examine herself by the
[1:51:01] word of god her purity and loyalty and
[1:51:04] devotion
[1:51:06] it was a question of this position
[1:51:10] it was not a question of law of position
[1:51:12] you did not run your home well adam god
[1:51:15] said
[1:51:16] adam what happened
[1:51:18] that was the question
[1:51:20] where are you man
[1:51:22] how did you get this
[1:51:24] how did you get here
[1:51:27] look at adam's response
[1:51:31] he was that woman
[1:51:33] ever since
[1:51:34] till that day man has been saying it was
[1:51:37] this woman
[1:51:39] brothers
[1:51:40] irresponsibility
[1:51:43] transferring of blame
[1:51:45] from that day
[1:51:46] the man has been attempting to avoid
[1:51:50] responsibility by transferring his blame
[1:51:53] to other
[1:51:54] from that day god has been attempting to
[1:51:57] restore mankind to his rightful place of
[1:52:00] responsibility in all of god's
[1:52:04] demand and all of god's doing within his
[1:52:07] creation man in every generation in
[1:52:10] every ethics expressing his expression
[1:52:14] in every culture in every way god has
[1:52:17] desired man to be restored to a
[1:52:21] responsible free moral agent he created
[1:52:24] him when he first
[1:52:26] released him from his own lines
[1:52:28] god is still trying to get men
[1:52:32] back
[1:52:33] to their responsible free will agent he
[1:52:36] don't want to make you a robot
[1:52:39] god purpose is obvious in his design
[1:52:43] for a man
[1:52:45] he
[1:52:46] made and created man to be free spirit
[1:52:49] an independent will
[1:52:52] he
[1:52:53] intended for man to rule and govern and
[1:52:57] to be a manager over the edge through
[1:53:00] the power of choice
[1:53:02] and that's to determine the quality of
[1:53:05] life and environment that he was
[1:53:07] designed within the context of god's
[1:53:10] will that means he gave him will to
[1:53:13] activate his choice
[1:53:15] hallelujah
[1:53:17] friends
[1:53:19] the purpose
[1:53:20] of the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:53:23] is not just to have a shield bombs
[1:53:26] check your body
[1:53:28] it's not to have good feeling
[1:53:30] the purpose of the baptism of the holy
[1:53:32] ghost is not to have good
[1:53:35] dance
[1:53:37] that's okay but that's not his purpose
[1:53:40] the purpose is not for you to shout
[1:53:44] not only for you to shout or scream
[1:53:47] he comes to give you
[1:53:49] dreams and vision and prophecy
[1:53:52] it
[1:53:53] gets
[1:53:54] a good it's good to get good feeling but
[1:53:57] can't see you if you it's good to get
[1:54:00] good feeling but if you can't see where
[1:54:03] you are going
[1:54:05] you've missed the purpose
[1:54:07] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:54:10] should give you direction
[1:54:14] purpose and vision in your life
[1:54:18] if you speak in tongues
[1:54:20] which some people call the baptism of
[1:54:21] holy ghost
[1:54:22] and you don't know why you wake up every
[1:54:24] morning you are sick
[1:54:27] if you follow the holy ghost
[1:54:30] but you don't have any direction then
[1:54:32] you miss the purpose of the holy ghost
[1:54:36] he comes
[1:54:37] to make
[1:54:38] the old man dream
[1:54:41] and that's where i am this morning
[1:54:44] i am dreaming
[1:54:46] wonderful
[1:54:47] dreaming
[1:54:49] the old man dream
[1:54:53] and take that dream
[1:54:55] and transfer it to young people who will
[1:54:57] make it a vision
[1:54:58] come on young people
[1:55:00] hallelujah
[1:55:02] we are not just able we are more than
[1:55:04] evil
[1:55:06] we are going to take this land
[1:55:08] we will take this land
[1:55:11] i said we will take this land
[1:55:17] you don't understand
[1:55:19] what i'm talking about
[1:55:21] i don't think we are too old now we are
[1:55:23] not yet finished
[1:55:25] yet
[1:55:26] i suggest that the purpose of the holy
[1:55:28] ghost is to give humanity vision again
[1:55:31] the purpose of the holy ghost is to give
[1:55:34] you purpose for living
[1:55:36] again
[1:55:37] when you come into relationship with god
[1:55:41] and receive the holy ghost you have a
[1:55:43] reason of living again
[1:55:45] hallelujah
[1:55:49] i was was blind
[1:55:51] but now i can see
[1:55:53] my vision is crystallized
[1:55:57] i've risen to
[1:55:58] existence you receive the baptism of the
[1:56:01] holy ghost
[1:56:03] not to feel good
[1:56:04] but you have to you got a reason to wake
[1:56:07] up every morning
[1:56:09] hallelujah
[1:56:11] so
[1:56:12] as the holy ghost speaks to this
[1:56:14] convention
[1:56:15] my fear is
[1:56:17] that every purpose has a season
[1:56:20] and every purpose has a time
[1:56:23] it is possible to miss your season
[1:56:26] some have attempted to fulfill their
[1:56:29] purpose out of due season
[1:56:32] just
[1:56:34] like the prophet
[1:56:35] tried to pray for that little child
[1:56:39] before the
[1:56:40] old lady
[1:56:42] the grandmother
[1:56:44] took a seat
[1:56:45] and took off her grass
[1:56:47] and begin to wipe it
[1:56:50] the prophet said
[1:56:52] on experience 1948 march 2
[1:56:55] i said
[1:56:57] i am telling you now
[1:56:59] i am sorry for what i done
[1:57:01] a while ago
[1:57:03] the vision wasn't complete
[1:57:06] you cannot do anything out of season and
[1:57:09] vision
[1:57:10] don't miss it
[1:57:12] stay a lot
[1:57:14] with the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:57:16] there is a time for everything there is
[1:57:19] a time for everything
[1:57:21] if you miss your timing it could be
[1:57:23] premature
[1:57:25] to eat
[1:57:26] it could be too late
[1:57:28] that
[1:57:29] a time for everything
[1:57:31] under heaven there is a season
[1:57:35] my great fear
[1:57:37] for this generation is that many of us
[1:57:40] are preoccupied with the past
[1:57:43] seasons and we have
[1:57:46] not changed our clothes
[1:57:48] to the season that we are in
[1:57:50] to everything there is a season and to
[1:57:53] every
[1:57:54] new season
[1:57:58] is that right
[1:57:59] there is a time
[1:58:01] you are listening to me
[1:58:04] god is moving out
[1:58:08] to do something with young people
[1:58:11] young people you just got to believe in
[1:58:13] yourself now
[1:58:15] there's something happening
[1:58:17] just like our pastor have been telling
[1:58:19] us the wind of change has switched
[1:58:23] to the people
[1:58:24] who
[1:58:26] are
[1:58:26] unlike who who who are
[1:58:30] unlikely
[1:58:33] that is why i said
[1:58:35] it is the season for the bride of christ
[1:58:39] i tell you something about season
[1:58:42] that
[1:58:44] when a season change
[1:58:46] you can do nothing about it
[1:58:49] season have no
[1:58:51] respect for your opinion
[1:58:55] winter doesn't care
[1:58:57] what you think about it
[1:58:59] is going to come
[1:59:01] secondly season never comes
[1:59:04] with your permission
[1:59:05] it doesn't need your invitation
[1:59:08] it will come when it is the time and
[1:59:10] when it comes
[1:59:12] you can argue
[1:59:14] you can disagree you can get mad you can
[1:59:17] puff up
[1:59:18] you can separate
[1:59:21] but they are going to come
[1:59:23] and they will affect you
[1:59:26] thirdly
[1:59:28] if you don't
[1:59:29] like the season
[1:59:31] it will kill you
[1:59:33] if you defer winter
[1:59:35] winter will win
[1:59:37] just close your cars i don't like this
[1:59:40] you go outside it will kill you it
[1:59:42] doesn't beg you to come when the time
[1:59:44] comes he will come all you need to do is
[1:59:46] to adjust
[1:59:47] change your clothes
[1:59:49] hallelujah
[1:59:50] because it's not the end of it
[1:59:53] after winter there's going to be the
[1:59:54] best season
[1:59:56] some of us are going through winter of
[1:59:57] our life
[1:59:58] that's not the end of your life
[2:00:01] you got to look beyond that
[2:00:04] manage the season and let it pass
[2:00:11] hallelujah
[2:00:13] adjust to it
[2:00:15] otherwise it will kill you
[2:00:17] if you go out in the winter
[2:00:20] with no jacket
[2:00:22] winter will win
[2:00:24] he will not respect your opinion
[2:00:27] so we find out that the bride has made
[2:00:30] herself ready
[2:00:32] be willing to lay aside every weight
[2:00:35] of sin that does israel visit us
[2:00:38] that we might run this race with
[2:00:40] patients
[2:00:41] that is set before us
[2:00:43] we must lay aside
[2:00:46] everything
[2:00:48] that easily beset us that pull us back
[2:00:52] we've got to get ready and fight this
[2:00:54] battle
[2:00:56] the prophet said
[2:00:58] winter will kill you
[2:01:00] when you
[2:01:02] when
[2:01:03] you when the change comes
[2:01:05] don't get mad at it or just to eat
[2:01:09] change your clothes
[2:01:11] it will not be more than four months
[2:01:13] recognize
[2:01:15] it
[2:01:16] and give it its respect
[2:01:18] the reason i say this is that the church
[2:01:21] does not bother graham said the reason i
[2:01:24] said this
[2:01:26] if the church does not get himself ready
[2:01:29] that's your duty to get ready the bride
[2:01:32] has to make herself ready
[2:01:34] the government has been paid for
[2:01:36] they are ready but you have to put them
[2:01:39] on
[2:01:40] yourself
[2:01:42] says the prophet
[2:01:43] amen
[2:01:45] let's really wind down now oh it's too
[2:01:47] much
[2:01:49] i'm so sorry and there's a new season
[2:01:51] upon the world now
[2:01:53] and it cannot be business as usual
[2:01:56] god has turned his face to the young
[2:01:58] people
[2:01:59] everywhere including the third world
[2:02:01] country and america
[2:02:03] and is raising them up
[2:02:06] for this last battle
[2:02:09] and it doesn't need your permission
[2:02:11] you just get to get prepared because
[2:02:13] there's something on the move
[2:02:15] you better adjust the season no matter
[2:02:18] what your opinion is
[2:02:21] god is going to look for young people to
[2:02:24] use but abram said
[2:02:26] the young people will sweep this gospel
[2:02:29] if the devil is recruiting his
[2:02:32] army god is also recruiting his own he's
[2:02:35] preparing and planning them because
[2:02:37] there's going to be a showdown
[2:02:46] we must never sacrifice therefore
[2:02:49] the present
[2:02:51] responsibility on the altar of past
[2:02:53] accomplishment
[2:02:55] whatever you did before is not what
[2:02:57] counts
[2:02:59] we must never allow our season to pass
[2:03:02] us without fulfilling our purpose for
[2:03:04] that season
[2:03:05] people need to be born again by the holy
[2:03:08] spirit
[2:03:09] when
[2:03:10] god brings you out
[2:03:13] slavery
[2:03:15] personally
[2:03:17] or corporately
[2:03:18] as the nation of the people he brings
[2:03:21] you into deliverance
[2:03:23] reference is not freedom
[2:03:27] you can make a note on that
[2:03:29] i'm going to say it's slowly
[2:03:31] deliverance
[2:03:32] is not freedom
[2:03:34] don't confuse deliverance with freedom
[2:03:38] i'm going to say something here today i
[2:03:41] hope you hear the spirit of prophecy
[2:03:45] when people are delivered they will do
[2:03:47] what miriam did
[2:03:49] they will get tumbling jump dance you
[2:03:52] know have a good feeling
[2:03:54] shout
[2:03:55] that's tremendous
[2:03:57] but deliverance
[2:04:00] but you are delivered but you are not
[2:04:03] yet free
[2:04:04] the prophet said in paradigm 1963
[2:04:08] now let's ask ourselves the question
[2:04:11] isn't that something
[2:04:13] like that
[2:04:15] as bad as i hate to say it
[2:04:18] we got to face
[2:04:20] facts
[2:04:21] somehow
[2:04:22] there is something wrong somewhere
[2:04:26] listen
[2:04:27] he brought them out of egypt through the
[2:04:29] red sea
[2:04:31] but
[2:04:32] told us the life of the egyptians are
[2:04:35] like the christians journey the life of
[2:04:38] the children of israel in the in in that
[2:04:40] place he took them through the kenner
[2:04:43] let me run now i i don't think i need to
[2:04:46] go through all of this but let me just
[2:04:48] finish that
[2:04:49] the bible said they were never touched
[2:04:52] with water it was a dry ground it your
[2:04:55] their deliverance was miraculous when
[2:04:58] god delivered you from slavery you are
[2:05:01] delivered it is all hundred percent what
[2:05:04] god can do he serves and delivers you
[2:05:08] without your help
[2:05:10] he brings you into deliverance
[2:05:13] if you we are drunkard
[2:05:16] an alcoholic
[2:05:17] drug addict
[2:05:18] or
[2:05:20] whatever
[2:05:22] god saves you instantly
[2:05:25] means you are changed but don't confuse
[2:05:28] that
[2:05:29] with freedom
[2:05:31] reverse people are dangerous people
[2:05:35] because they are not free
[2:05:37] you don't believe me wait there is
[2:05:39] another problem come up you will see
[2:05:40] their true character
[2:05:43] but delivered people are dangerous
[2:05:45] because they haven't changed
[2:05:48] wait until something happened you will
[2:05:50] see
[2:05:51] what they are made up of
[2:05:53] all they have changed is location
[2:05:56] and that's not what we are doing god was
[2:05:58] asking her down where at that adam was
[2:06:00] telling him
[2:06:01] i saw you i might it's not location it's
[2:06:03] about this position your spiritual stand
[2:06:06] with god the reason why god will not
[2:06:09] take people direct into freedom is
[2:06:12] because you have been in slavery for a
[2:06:15] long time
[2:06:16] and you aren't god the mentality of
[2:06:19] freedom
[2:06:20] so
[2:06:21] wilderness is a place to knock
[2:06:24] that slavery mentality out of you
[2:06:27] to be able to enter the promised land so
[2:06:29] it has to take you through training
[2:06:32] processes in the wilderness to try to
[2:06:34] get egypt out of your mind out of your
[2:06:37] spirit before let you into canaan the
[2:06:40] wilderness is designed to get rid of
[2:06:43] egypt
[2:06:44] an exposition of seven church age
[2:06:47] nine
[2:06:48] the leadership church as many as i love
[2:06:51] i rebuke chester be serious therefore
[2:06:54] and repent revelation 3 19. this is the
[2:06:58] same message that john had he cried
[2:07:02] out in the in that religious wilderness
[2:07:06] of pharisees and disease he then
[2:07:09] repent
[2:07:11] there was no other
[2:07:13] cause then
[2:07:15] there is no other cause now
[2:07:17] there was no other way to get back to
[2:07:21] god and there is no other way now
[2:07:25] it is repent
[2:07:27] change your mind
[2:07:30] turn around repent
[2:07:33] let that
[2:07:34] slavery mentality leave you
[2:07:38] let me say this friends
[2:07:41] if you don't learn your lesson
[2:07:43] in the wilderness god will bury you dear
[2:07:47] and i'm going to say it again
[2:07:50] we have been wondering
[2:07:53] why certain group of people
[2:07:56] wouldn't see
[2:07:57] to progress
[2:07:58] don't they see
[2:08:00] to make how they didn't seem to make it
[2:08:03] forward i mean
[2:08:05] they have been delivered they have been
[2:08:09] complaining
[2:08:11] after their deliverance
[2:08:13] they have been delivered but they have
[2:08:15] been complaining
[2:08:17] they have been delivered but they have
[2:08:19] been blaming the past
[2:08:21] blaming everybody else transferring
[2:08:24] responsibility
[2:08:25] for hundreds of years
[2:08:27] blaming
[2:08:28] they just keep they've been delivered
[2:08:32] and god keep burying them right there
[2:08:36] in the wilderness keep burying them just
[2:08:40] keep burying them
[2:08:41] god will not allow the spirit of egypt
[2:08:44] to enter canaan or help me god
[2:08:48] there is no freedom
[2:08:50] without law
[2:08:52] therefore
[2:08:55] law
[2:08:56] is
[2:08:57] therefore
[2:08:58] is always law
[2:09:00] freedom means you are
[2:09:03] under control
[2:09:06] of another
[2:09:07] person
[2:09:08] but under the higher law
[2:09:11] of the principle laid down by god
[2:09:14] freedom is not
[2:09:16] an absent of work
[2:09:19] or the cancellation of responsibility
[2:09:23] but rather
[2:09:25] the release to work
[2:09:28] the release to work to fulfill an
[2:09:31] assignment of responsibility
[2:09:34] jesus closed the concept of freedom with
[2:09:37] a statement in john
[2:09:39] 8 32 he said
[2:09:41] then you will know the truth and the
[2:09:44] truth will make you free
[2:09:46] in other words freedom cannot be given
[2:09:49] to you by human
[2:09:50] beings
[2:09:52] it is discovered when you discover
[2:09:55] the truth about your life
[2:09:58] a slave has no permanent place in the
[2:10:01] family jesus
[2:10:03] said in john chapter
[2:10:06] john 15
[2:10:07] but a song
[2:10:09] belongs to the family forever
[2:10:12] servants he says must be promoted to
[2:10:16] friends
[2:10:17] god does not want to
[2:10:20] remain
[2:10:21] god does not want you to remain
[2:10:23] a servant always
[2:10:26] begging
[2:10:27] following crawling he wants you to
[2:10:30] become friend who knows
[2:10:32] his mind his will his purpose
[2:10:36] paul said in galentine chapter four and
[2:10:38] he said as long as a year he's a child
[2:10:42] he di he's treated like a slave but when
[2:10:45] he grow up
[2:10:47] he get inheritance
[2:10:49] no longer are you going to be treated
[2:10:52] like a slave in the body of christ
[2:10:57] church hear me
[2:10:59] that time is over
[2:11:02] no longer
[2:11:04] can you be treated as a slave
[2:11:07] in the body of christ
[2:11:09] irresponsibility led lead to slavery
[2:11:13] proverbs chapter 6 verse 5 says free
[2:11:16] yourself like a greaser you strum
[2:11:19] it and get up from your sleep a little
[2:11:22] slumber elite a little sleepy little
[2:11:25] slumber
[2:11:26] poverty comes upon you like a abundant
[2:11:30] freedom demand responsibility
[2:11:33] responsibility is a result of maturity
[2:11:37] which is the evidence of character which
[2:11:40] is produced by trials and testing
[2:11:44] disobedient
[2:11:45] leads to
[2:11:47] bondage
[2:11:48] and disobedient
[2:11:50] lead to irresponsibility
[2:11:53] it's an act of irreverence
[2:11:55] the highest
[2:11:56] form of act of irreverence is is
[2:11:59] disobedient bible says like a
[2:12:01] witchcrafting
[2:12:03] jesus was here seeking the will of the
[2:12:05] father
[2:12:06] you don't own yourself
[2:12:08] it's not about you
[2:12:11] i close now graciality
[2:12:14] freedom
[2:12:15] is
[2:12:16] expensive
[2:12:18] it's very costly
[2:12:20] it's a high price
[2:12:22] deliverance is instant
[2:12:24] but freedom is a process
[2:12:27] one must be prepared for freedom
[2:12:32] all oppressed
[2:12:34] through all oppression produce the
[2:12:37] spirit of irresponsibility
[2:12:39] the spirit of laziness hatred to walk
[2:12:42] fear
[2:12:43] distrust
[2:12:45] law self-esteem poor
[2:12:47] self-concept selfishness
[2:12:50] timid spirit of
[2:12:54] spirit of
[2:12:56] immediate
[2:12:57] and
[2:12:59] instant gratification
[2:13:02] that's what
[2:13:03] the world is sovereign under right now
[2:13:07] people who have been oppressed for many
[2:13:10] years they want instant gratification
[2:13:13] young people save yourself from that
[2:13:16] don't want to plan they don't want to
[2:13:18] plan
[2:13:19] and wait
[2:13:21] and end
[2:13:22] they want instant cash
[2:13:25] a spirit of slavery
[2:13:30] still upon them
[2:13:32] issa was a good example
[2:13:35] of a man
[2:13:36] who has a slave mentality
[2:13:39] when he is hungry he sells his
[2:13:41] birthright for some food instant
[2:13:44] gratification forgetting he will be
[2:13:47] hungry again
[2:13:49] but he needed something
[2:13:52] deliverance may not lead to freedom
[2:13:54] and that's the saddest of the this night
[2:13:57] this afternoon deliverance is not
[2:13:59] freedom freedom is deliverance from
[2:14:02] oppression
[2:14:03] deliverance is released from the
[2:14:06] oppressed
[2:14:07] let me repeat it deliverance is a
[2:14:09] release from the oppressed but freedom
[2:14:12] is deliverance from the oppression you
[2:14:15] can be delivered and still
[2:14:18] possess
[2:14:19] the
[2:14:21] the
[2:14:22] you can you can be released
[2:14:24] and still not free
[2:14:28] let me leave this
[2:14:29] but let us close really now i want to
[2:14:32] read my last quote and then we pray
[2:14:35] i just pray that we are going to pray

[2:14:52] upon us that there will be a revival and

[2:14:57] edge of the manifestation of the sons of
[2:14:59] god it fall upon you and me

[2:15:17] avoided prayer meeting if you have never
[2:15:19] had time to sit under the strength i

[2:16:09] philistines like they never been shook
[2:16:12] before
[2:16:13] i believe
[2:16:15] god
[2:16:16] have it
[2:16:17] if
[2:16:18] he wouldn't do it through the church
[2:16:22] he would take a christian businessman
[2:16:25] he would do something another
[2:16:28] but there be a shock of power
[2:16:31] a secret power of the holy spirit
[2:16:34] growing out
[2:16:36] just as certain as anything can be
[2:16:41] and get the job done
[2:16:43] god grant
[2:16:45] that will be numbered among

[2:17:19] no way
[2:17:21] no matter what you've been true
[2:17:22] he works in ways you cannot see
[2:17:28] he will make a way for me
