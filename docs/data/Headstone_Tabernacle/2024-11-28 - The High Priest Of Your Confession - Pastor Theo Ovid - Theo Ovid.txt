be in his presence tonight we want to go to Hebrews chapter 2 we want to read from verse 13 to 18 Hebrews chapter 3 1 verse verse one and Hebrews chapter 1014 to 23 first scripture reading tonight amen Hebrews chapter 2 verse 13 okay okay and again I will put my trust in him and again behold and the CH of God which God had given me for as much then as he are children then as a children are partakers of Flesh and Blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetimes subject to bondage for verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the Seed of Abraham wherefore in all things it behoove him to be made like unto his Brethren that he might be a merciful and a a faithful high priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people for in that he himself had suffered being tempted is he is able to sucur them that attempted and we continue over to chapter 3 verse one wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession Christ Jesus and we go to Hebrews chapter 10 and you want to read from verse 14 of Hebrews chapter 10 for by one offering he had perfected forever them that are Sanctified whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us for after that he had said before this is the Covenant that I will make with them in those these sayth the Lord I will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will I write them and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more for where remission of sin for for now where remission of these is there is no more offering for sin having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus by a New and Living Way which he had consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having an high priest over the house of God let us draw near with a True Heart in full Assurance of Faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promis let us pray father we thank you for your word it's already anointed it's already inspired and we pray a breed upon your people tonight the Breath of God Grant it Lord in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen God bless you I feel the anointing on the word hallelujah oh praise God praise God praise God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise God I feel the fire in the building praise God so then this Hebrews chapter 3:1 and he Amplified so then Brethren consecrated and set apart of God who share the Heavenly calling thoughtfully and attentively consider Jesus the Apostle the high priest in whom we confessed as we as ours as we embrace the Christian faith so tonight have a title the high priest of our confession praise God that word profession is confession the high priest of our confession oh we have a high priest tonight oh glory to God he speaks on our behalf he moves in on our behalf his blood was offered on our behalf we couldn't access God but his high priest this man Christ Jesus he did it for us tonight oh praise God let's go tonight brother somebody says how does Divine Healing does it last all the time it lasts just as long as Faith lasts and salvation lasts the same way just as long as Faith lasts when you feel that you are not saved anymore you are not saved for it is by faith are you saved that's a bum tonight when you feel like you're not saved anymore you're not saved for it's of by faith are you save through Grace is that right when you come to the altar what do you do you confess your sins and ask God to forgive you and in your heart now get it I'm still reading this an I saying now get it this is brother brandham saying now get it now get it in your heart you have to believe that he has forgiven you is that right you have to believe that then you walk away from the platform and then you have to confess it first that you are saved so the confession of being saved it come out your own mouth I am saved because you believe God forgive you and you receive Jesus Christ therefore you are saved isn't that right then you have to confess it first that you are saved you can't just keep it under a Bushell you would lose it right now youve got to confess it and tell everyone that you are glad now if you walk outside and somebody say there's nothing to it you just got sight to the altar how many Christians is in here let's see raise your hands all right 100% each one of you got saved in the same way by faith you could come here and cry and pray and pray and cry all this week and next week and a month you will still be a sinner until you accept him by faith tears not saving you prayer not saving you crying not saving you you are saved by faith amen true Grace let your faith rise tonight oh glory to God not your feeling let your faith rise tonight not your tears let your faith rise tonight it's not your crying that saves you I'm still reading it's your faith that saves youall then when you accept it you believe it and somebody say let's see if you look any different why you still got brown eyes you still the same as you was you can't show nothing that you are saved you are only testifying of the Unseen your faith says you are saved what you do you believe you are saved then you say you are saved you believe you sa it amen you believe you confess it you believe you speak it you don't believe and don't say say nothing you believe and you confess what you believe well give the Lord a shout in the house Hallelujah you are testifying of the Unseen your faith Sayes you are saved what you do you believe you are saved then you say you are saved then you act like you are saved then you associate with those who are saved and it works righteousness what working your faith Hallelujah your faith is working that righteousness and after a while everybody knows that you are saved isn't that right well he was wounded for our transgression and by his stripes we are heal and Hebrews 3:1 said he is the high priest of our confession now any Scholars know the word profession is translated as confession and he's the high priest and here it is get it now or you won't even have to come here to be healed you'll be healed right where you were sitting and I believe it's possible right now for people in this building to be healed right here right now oh give the Lord some Praises this is present tense tonight hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah open in half an hour you don't know even how long this service is oh G glory to God amenallah let's go remember it isn't how much you cry right it isn't how much you repent Hallelujah it isn't how loud you can cry to God I remember sister always repentant always repent she repentant she come back to her brother to repent for something she think about and this and that and always repenting until the brother come and tell me she tell her don't come back by me because you see in her mind she think by saying sorry for this sorry for this something happen to her but what is lacking there is fi I said but God forgive you for that the brother have no o you say I going to make this right I hope you have it against me against you you're free as a bird you're free to fly but like Johnny Crow still think you're tied so you're coming to try to make everything right and you figure you see when I make everything right everything will be all right and you're not walking in faith let's go it isn't let go again it isn't how much you cry it isn't how much you repent it isn't how loud you can cry to God it is now sincere you can be that's drill down we've driving slow down this this Alle tonight is how much faith that you have when you come to him he doesn't save you on the Merit of your prayer he doesn't save you upon the Merit of your righteousness he saves you upon the merits of your faith it is by faith you are saved through Grace I think a lot of people get away from these things now you come to the altar realizing that you a sinner now some the things might be repetitive it's different coach on different places but it's the same thing is something that I fell led to bring as a focus tonight and I trust the church gets it I everybody here gets it and those who online and those who here afterward they get it because you need to get this because you need to come here with faith and leave your flesh home and faith and get your feelings out of the way oh glory to God I was telling my wife I was telling somebody about something stop focusing on the grass that you you see rain falling right now grass just popping up like that study the plant that you have because you keep cutting grass and you neglect the plants all the plants will suffer keep make sure your mold and you're putting manual around the plants that you have save your plants the grass will always be around some people focus on the grass and they focus on the grass and they grass cutters he doesn't save in the Merit of your prayer he doesn't save righteousness by Grace right now you come to the altar realizing that you a sinner you're sorry for your sin so he's going through this you repent of what you done and you can stay there and cry for a week in and out it would never save you until you believe believe in your heart that you are saved then you confess it you ready tonight he can't do nothing for you until you confess it watch your mouth watch what you say this is serious tonight don't think this is SK milk and this is light and don't much salvation and save and Faith no no no no no this is real he cannot do nothing for you until you confess it for he is the high priest of your conf confession don't hold it in your mind come out your mouth that's why it's important for you to say amen amen a lot of Silent Saints in the message it is important you say amen amen means so be it amen mean I accept it amen means that for me amen mean I agree with it amen mean that what the for beast in amen

dare not you have to pray you you must pray all them Devils locking you you have to pray then when you begin to pray God said I heard the cries of hallu of my people I can't come down if I don't hear

what he has done Hebrews 3:1 Hallelujah he's the high priest of our confession and he says now you he cannot save you by the merits of your prayer he cannot save you by the Merit of your enthusiasm or good works he saves you by the merits of your faith and your confession so he recognize it's almost the same thing he's saying all deeper he saves You by faith and confession because you see you have to believe in your heart and speak with your mouth Hallelujah and confess then you are saved Hallelujah the word is n the even in thy mouth and in thy heart if you speak it then you could be be saved isn't that right so you are saved by The Merc of your faith and confession and then he used this if you confess me before men him will I confess before my father and the Holy Angels Hallelujah Glory

no good then you have got a right to go to God see Bush you you make your bush medicine you drink it men like the bush thing because men like like go doctor that's a problem so they want to start the bush to put thing together Shake It Up and boil it up and drink it and so hoping it work if that don't work go to call the dock next thing you call the doctor that's sensible things to do if the doctor can't do you no good you got a right to go to God that's what you should do call on God and God is the author of circumstance I like that he's the author of what circumstance whatever your situation you're in you don't B oh God no he's a god of circumstance he can do when nothing else can do when man comes to the end of their line God can do notice never forget this you people a sick and needy the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise will bring I wish this could just resonate like a bow like a if like if it's a a violin we preach it so much times but made come different tonight the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass when you believe and take God at his word and said it it so believe it so God will bring it to pass I hope I'm yelling at you but this thing really got my voice s the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise he written will bring it to pass if you are a sinner confess your sins believe that God save you and then go to testifying of it telling people you are saved it will work righteousness and after a while you'll be a [Music] Christian I want you to remember this this is for the weakest Christian that is in the building or in the world you don't have to have gifts you don't have to wait till some person come by who prays for the sick I will go on record it's a tape recorder taking it here and I said this that the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass if you can get the right mental attitude towards the Divine promise and I heard brother R

committal yes commit thy ways unto the Lord commit your thinking to him you see when you do commit you see when you PL de corn after two days you find yourself digging up to see it stting to grow

get the key from the pastor me I have one key pun you know and Men interfere in people's lives and have and making people believe that dedicated life that's a lie that's come from the bottomless pit of Hell that is false Revelation false inspiration have nothing to do with that when Paul when when Peter got the vision to go to cor's house and something like that had nobody to tell him do go so go so when the church to acoss Pete afterwards he says listen wait let me give me testimony when he give you testimony so they had to shut them out and just now we giving our testimony we start yet you

you come to interview now what they believe all believe Bram all believe a prophet oh yeah right they believe that that the Press coming for that J we we believe all the mystery We Believe vs and wars and Ukraine and Russia and this and that really you know what they coming for just like say silver and gold have on such as I have I can only give what I have God give it to me I can give it to you if

while you start to go higher afterward them fell confess to Pharaoh the power that that man working with now we have nothing for that you know what dark power run out God a run out at all Hallelujah Halle we going to start the battle Hallelujah and we going higher and higher and higher but say what you see manifested temporarily will be manifested in his fullness do ever forget that there's a manifestation for the fullness he said what we see should make a church that will make a Revival that the people will come from everywhere to see the seven Thunders manifested that's the word that's the prophecy we under oh give the Lord a shout oh give the Lord a shout something have to break maybe it's tonight maybe it's now maybe it's you maybe it's here oh give the Lord a shout Oh Glory to God the shout of the king is in the camp Glory Hallelujah it's the most powerful thing that I know of is a committal commit thy ways unto the Lord commit your thinking to him if you are sick and the doctors can't help you no more then just commit your case to God and act like it's already done something will have to take place it just can't keep from it because God is a Creator the word is a seed and a seed planted in the ground if that seed is watered it Springs forth into life and you know what what is the word worship what what is the word praise let the pastors don't know that because the the church with Morpheus and the arms of Morpheus they call out dead sleeping and man saying he would going in subconscious men hitting big snow in the church but the would go on subconscious praise God but the praise is the Thanksgiving that brings the water upon the seed in your heart that's when you know you have Revelation he staggered not at the promise of God true unbelief but was strong in faith giving praise giving glory to God because he was fully persuaded that what God promised he was able to perform that's a revelation when a Rel comes to you you know God said that you know God can't lie God is not a man that would lie he's not like them lying prophets and lying pastors and preachers in the tongue no he's not that kind of man if God say he will heal you he would heal you if God say he will baptize you he'll baptize you God say s fire upon you he fire upon you God said give you a breakthrough you'll get a breakthrough oh give the Lord a shout believe God for your business believe God for your health believe God for your family believe God for in your SP of your struggles come on come on come on listen you can put me on record after 30 years of preaching I can say this that I have never one time sincerely asked God for anything and committed it to him he either give it to me or told me why I couldn't do it why he couldn't do it we talking about committing you committed you committed where you committing and bringing it back up for why you committed and R back up for you committed committed let God Work It [Music] Out you simply say it's God's word it's not for me to try to figure it out that is God's business he spoke it and all necessary something will take place then he he said then watch what would you do he said what always remember church God word is true and he said Divine what if you can look at this right way remember here has been my standard in my life I have tried to do this the first thing I want to find out if it is the will of God or not then I know it's God's will the next thing is my objective to it and my motive in doing that so it's not just the will but why do I want it what is my motive amen what is my objective motive and objective that brings you to an internal audit of your own desires of your heart's intent of your heart's motive and objective that's a personal audit that you're not just jamming god with I want this I want that I want that I need this no why so next thing I found out is the will of God then I know it's God's will next thing is my objective to it motive in doing it then if it's the will of God and my objective is right and my motive is right I have faith that it will be done because first is the will of God then my objective is to glorify him my motive is to give him all the glory so there's no selfish motive about it at all and if you have selfish motive it won't work so selfishness have to get boots I mean boots you have to boot it out you have to get out of you get out of self-interest get out of what you feel that why say eternal life is living for others if you're more objective is to make money for yourself or something you'll never succeed when you try to something outside the will of God it won't work to begin with so there's a genuine Faith but you must come into a real channel of God to have that genuine Faith there is human faith and there's the faith of God and you must have a Godly Faith to believe and to have this Godly Faith you must have the mind of Christ in you all right let's go cast up now be about to take off now he says now healing is not something that you just say well I believe I believe if that's the best you can do just mentally I believe I believe I accept it then if you accept it on those basis watch if you accept it on those basis keep saying it over and over say it out loud did you ever hear that he say say it out loud you know say it over and over just keep saying I'm Healed I'm Healed say it until you actually believe it and when you believe it it's going to take [Applause] place there's a special teaching tonight you know there's something that I love he said about Abraham he said when Abraham come to the fullness of believing that mean ABR had his trouble in but he came to a place where I say this way his faith got ripe so let's say this way your faith could be green so it's not fully anchored yet but when your faith get right no devil can move you because you are anchored down by the word by it it is anchored inside of you oh give the Lord a shout so s frustrate you the Doctor Who tell you get out of the office because you're done old he say come here 10 years ago what happened to you I tell you no your wife can't have a child you can't have a child you're out of it you're out of the game you are finished but I know what God tell God tell abam by Sir having a son so shall th be as he Stars so when the doctor say finish doct he say you finish I about to get started well give the Lord some Praises because he's going to get transformation power going to hit him and power going to hit this bride all right let's go can I read this again if you accept it on those basis keep saying it over and over say it out loud say it over and over just keep saying I'm Healed I'm Healed say I'm delivered pray I'm free I have a breakthrough let's see go on further say it until you actually believe it and then something going to take place let's go let me drop the BM now don't have a negative testimony you like amen s they're coming to believe it now every time when you confess well I still feel bad today I guess you go right straight back in the same rot that it was in the there's not a man or woman in here that is baptized with the holy spirit that would start your confession I believe I lost the Holy Spirit I believe it's g from me he said you will go right down he said listen close you will never live above your confession that's a nuclear bomb tonight back you are back I finished you are finished I can't make it I struggling but struggling you are struggling that's your confession you will never watch that would never live above your confession and Jesus is the high priest of our confession he is making he is at the right hand of the father making upon what our confession he can't do nothing for you until first you confess it said that is why he said Say by his tribe I was healed I am healed you're not healed now he if Jesus come here now he can nothing for you he healed you 2,000 years ago you have to confess what he already done could somebody say Amen in the Tabernacle tonight all right hallu Divine Healing is in Calvary and the only thing that you can do is point to Calvary that's where salvation isay you wasn't saved years ago 10 years ago 20 years ago you wasn't saved then you were saved 900 years ago when Jesus died at Calvary he took the sins of the world today you just accepted your salvation so many years ago but everything that God can do both in sickness and sin has already been appropriated in Calvary the only thing that a minister can do is to point you to where God already did it for you in Christ a man could come to the altar here we go he could pray all night he could cry he could beg he could plead walk up and the flaws make restitution but until he believe and accepted he still be a sinner because Jesus is the high priest of our confession he can't do nothing for us until first we confess what he has done hallelujah and then he goes to work as the high priest here we go making good what we profess that he has done Oh Glory to God by his stri I was healed glory to God hallelujah then he go and make good Give the Lord some Praises tonight so you can understand why brother brandham the man was blind he pass through

expect that you heard you say well I'm weak my faith is not very much Hallelujah I'm not a very good Christian and those words growing up in the atmosphere Christ got wonderful you oh that's my boy woo woo that's my brethren that is what the devil want you to say you are just look look look you are just talking his language right there look at there I just talk about talking language look at right here he said you just talking his language right then you must never say that don't never let your testimony be negative let it be positive all the time I am saved I have God in my heart I believe him with all my heart do you believe healing with all my heart let your testimony always and your thoughts never permit a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it when it starts that don't entertain it that's is when he say the birds could fly on your head but don't let it build a nest God can only bless you as you confess he has done it for you all right almost done M come please Hallelujah I sking some stuff you go right out of this building testifying that you're saved what if you go out the building saying well I don't know then you are not saved but God will make your body obey your confession I don't care how much naked woman out there there hallelujah hallelujah God will make your body obey your confession oh God you can't put your eyes out there get back your eyes in order back to the word of God isn't that right God will make your body obey your confession if you don't confess it your body go the same way going all the time Hallelujah before you can be healed you have to confess it first you have to believe you are healed and when you believe you are healed God makes your body obey your confession so now when you're coming here just let it be settled God this is your command I believe I am healed oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah glory to God thank you Lord he said watch he says just simple say thank you Father you promis it to me I now receive it Watch What Happens mean it in your heart just keep saying it over and over here it is again if you don't believe it all together keep saying it until you do believe it just keep saying it over thank you Lord for my healing cuz what is he he's the high priest of our confession is that right Hebrews 3 he's the high priest of our confession then he cannot do things for you until and you cannot make intercession until first to confess what he has done then he can only act as we confess no confession no action oh give the Lord Praise In The House Hallelujah and remember nothing can be done without faith it first must be confessed and he's the author of faith and your faith brings God it's the thing that brings the prayer and God together in the scene Faith changes it and brings it together all Christianity right with me tonight all you are all you ever will be is based upon faith in the word that's the reason I believe the word Oh Glory to God I'm going to close with this testimony Hallelujah but say this Bible is the word and if a man woman whoever speaks anything to be the truth that's contrary to the contents of the Bible it is wrong and I have tried by God's help to make my Ministry that the Lord Jesus to presented to the people upon a solid basic Foundation God's Eternal Word if I come and told you that God give me power to go and make the blind to see and the deatha to hear that would be contrary to his word I told you and that that that touch the poll and you'll get well that's contrary to his word but when I come preaching the gospel the gospel is the good news that Jesus has come and has redeemed us and died in our stead isn't that right so no matter how weak here we go how sick how far in sin whatever the condition is he is there to make intercession upon what we confess that he had did for us and anything including the atonement he was wounded for transgressions he was bruised for iniquities the time of Peace was upon him when the will heal any of those things those attributes of his debt that we take into our hearts and believe to be the truth and confess what he has done he said he we feel anything about it he's before God to make it right if I was paralyzed and in my heart I believe he healed me I would confess that I was healed if I couldn't move a muscle I will believe I'll confess I was healed and I meal from my heart not mentally upset but from my heart praise God by his stripes I am healed no matter how I feel well look you say your heal and look right look at the body that don't have nothing to do with it God don't said so it ain't what I see it is what I believe Hallelujah he G his testimony now when I was so sick I couldn't hold a mouthful of food in my stomach the best doctors in the nation examined me said it's impossible for him to get well I read God's word I asked God to help me I eat cornbread beans onions I took a big mouthful my mother got scared and called the doctor I swallow them and when I swallow they come right back up again I held my hand over my mouth I can't do it God done said so I swallowed it back it come back I swallowed it again I just keep on till it stay down I got me another mouthful I kept on like that day after day walking down the street I have to hold my hand against my stomach it was hurting so bad praising God for my healing tears running on my eyes suffered so bad someone say how you feel brother Bram I say just wonderful praise the Lord I am healed you are healed yes praise the Lord I am healed just like God why somebody said you lied brother Bram he said no I never I believe what Jesus died he healed me and I accepted it it had to be so I wasn't confessing what I felt I was confessing what I believe I believe his word was the Eternal truth it couldn't pass away it's absolutely the truth God said so that's my faith I believe I'm saved oh give the Lord some Praises Satan could beat me around and stomp with my feelings a drunk man could come in and say I feel just as good as you do he probably does but he hasn't got the faith in the thing that I got oh give the Lord a shout he say Satan could beat him up with feelings but Satan couldn't beat him up with the faith that he had inside his soul Give the Lord Praises hallelujah hallelujah is I'm saved not because I feel like it I'm saved because I've met God requirement and you healed the same way final word is from Hebrews 4:12 Hallelujah it says for the word of God is quick and Powerful sharp as an inate sword pierced and divine the son of Soul and Spirit of the joints and Marrow and is a des of the T and of the heart neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open before him seeing then we have a great high priest that is pass into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin Let Us therefore from tonight come boldly into the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in a time of need may God bless you as you leave you in faith and
