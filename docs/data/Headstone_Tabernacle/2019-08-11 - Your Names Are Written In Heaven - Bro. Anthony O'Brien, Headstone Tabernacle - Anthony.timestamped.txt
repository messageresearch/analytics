[47:44] anointed 17 it says and the seventy
[47:48] returned again with joy saying Lord even
[47:50] the Devils are subject unto us through

[48:01] behold I give unto you power to tread on
[48:04] serpents and scorpions and over all the
[48:08] power of the enemy and nothing shall by
[48:12] any means hurt you notwithstanding in
[48:16] this rejoice not
[48:19] that the spirits are subject unto you
[48:23] but rather rejoice because your names
[48:27] are written in heaven and in that our
[48:32] Jesus rejoice in the spirit and said I
[48:37] thank thee O Father Lord of Heaven and

[58:56] grace of Almighty God I have a reason

[1:05:37] degrees have come on Sunday evening that
[1:05:40] the devil could almost preach a message
[1:05:41] perfectly hallelujah is now right
[1:05:45] but there's a secret that God hid in the
[1:05:49] back part of his mind that he didn't
[1:05:51] tell the devil about that's why he could
[1:05:55] look at job and say have you considered
[1:05:59] my servant because the devil was looking
[1:06:03] at what you're had and failed to
[1:06:06] recognize that there was something he
[1:06:08] did not see because the devil could mess
[1:06:12] with your mind he could mess with your
[1:06:14] human spirit but tongue inside a heart
[1:06:17] well he can't mess with that tongue
[1:06:21] inside there God put something something
[1:06:25] that holds arranged something that's
[1:06:28] there
[1:06:29] in the trial in the testing in the
[1:06:33] persecution God hid a secret oh hung
[1:06:38] inside your soul and that is a reason
[1:06:41] why no matter what dross the devil throw
[1:06:44] at you what scum the devil threw in your
[1:06:47] direction something inside of your soul
[1:06:49] is smaller because it comes a little him
[1:06:52] it raises back up again and raises your
[1:06:56] hands up again you find a reason in the
[1:07:00] midst of your million sorrows you find
[1:07:03] one reason why you should come to church
[1:07:05] this morning you still find one reason
[1:07:09] why you could shout why you could sing
[1:07:12] why you can lift your hands tell the
[1:07:15] reason this morning what is the secret
[1:07:18] the bird is in the pride and your names

[1:10:06] nothing will separate us from the love
[1:10:09] of God God loved you so much and he
[1:10:13] looked for the greatest treasure he
[1:10:15] could find and the only one he could
[1:10:17] find was a treasure of his own heart and
[1:10:20] when love protected itself
[1:10:22] love had a name and a name was Jesus
[1:10:27] and he came down and fought for you and
[1:10:31] paid the price for you hallelujah
[1:10:34] we didn't deserve it but he loved you
[1:10:37] anyhow he didn't deserve it but he
[1:10:40] called you anyhow he chose you anyhow oh
[1:10:44] that oughta make you shut up I haven't

[1:11:56] angels fought against them and it was no
[1:11:58] place found for the dragon so they

[1:22:45] he said have you never noticed how Satan
[1:22:47] hates 2 books of the Bible model another
[1:22:49] more than all the others to liberal
[1:22:52] theologians and tweedle scientists he's
[1:22:55] always attacking the book of Genesis and
[1:22:57] the book of Revelation is now in both
[1:23:01] these books we find satan's origin we
[1:23:05] find his awful wings and his destruction
[1:23:07] and why he attacks them talking about
[1:23:12] who God is who we are and who the devil
[1:23:14] is let's talk about the devil a little
[1:23:16] bit that that's why he attacks them he
[1:23:20] hates to be exposed and in those books
[1:23:24] he is exposed for exactly what he is
[1:23:29] halleluyah is not that old serpent
[1:23:32] called the devil Hollywood that
[1:23:34] deceiveth Collin is not the stars of
[1:23:36] heaven in there and he said now that
[1:23:39] it's exposing for who is jesus said
[1:23:42] about satan he has no part in me and I
[1:23:45] have no part in him the devil would like
[1:23:48] to prove that different but he cannot so
[1:23:52] he does all he can watch watch what he
[1:23:55] does no he does all he can to destroy
[1:23:58] confidence in the world because when you
[1:24:02] have confidence in the world
[1:24:04] there's nothing can penetrate that
[1:24:07] hallelujah holidays nothing can get past
[1:24:10] that hallelujah when you fortify
[1:24:13] yourself with the word holla is not
[1:24:17] Halloween let the weak say

[1:24:23] of God oh it makes you speak something
[1:24:27] it makes you live something it makes you
[1:24:30] believe something because a word of
[1:24:32] court heaven on earth will pass away but
[1:24:35] his word cannot pass away his word is an
[1:24:39] expression of God himself
[1:24:41] I went God give you his word he give you
[1:24:44] a portion of himself therefore all of
[1:24:47] the authority of God is in his word and
[1:24:51] when you take the Word of God and sent
[1:24:54] by His stripes I am healed and you Cham
[1:24:57] the devil in his mouth
[1:24:59] the devil cannot do anything about that
[1:25:01] Oh
[1:25:02] resist the devil and he will flee from
[1:25:05] you
[1:25:07] [Applause]
[1:25:07] [Laughter]
[1:25:09] [Music]
[1:25:10] you will have the victory you will have
[1:25:14] the victory every time you stay with
[1:25:17] this word every time you take this word
[1:25:20] forget about yourself
[1:25:22] forget about your intellect and just
[1:25:24] take the word for what it is
[1:25:26] hallelujah hallelujah you will have the
[1:25:29] victory every time Oh
[1:25:31] chlorine up on a devil knows it hallo
[1:25:37] hallo hallo might fight up with your
[1:25:43] situation but when you take the word for
[1:25:46] your situation watch the enemy go to
[1:25:49] running watch the enemy go to flee in
[1:25:51] seven ways from you why because you took
[1:25:55] the word hallelujah if Adam had stable
[1:26:00] to learn you don't never have fallen
[1:26:02] isn't that right
[1:26:04] but he put away to learn and he chose to
[1:26:07] go with his wife and that's what caused
[1:26:09] a form it's now right and all these
[1:26:11] things that happened back me when he
[1:26:13] stay with the word and what happens God
[1:26:16] shows us a continuation of the world God
[1:26:19] continues his work in us Oh we'll get a
[1:26:22] man my but when the church please
[1:26:26] believe Satan when the church you yab
[1:26:30] the believers this morning this believes
[1:26:32] Satan and believes the spirits
[1:26:35] revelation of the word then the gates of
[1:26:38] Hell cannot prevail against her so we're
[1:26:45] not just talking about reading the word
[1:26:47] now but he's talking about the spirits
[1:26:49] revelation of the word to you as an
[1:26:53] individual
[1:26:54] that's why revelation is so important
[1:26:57] that's why you've got to be in the
[1:26:59] spirit to catch revelation to catch what
[1:27:03] God is saying that's why we emphasize
[1:27:05] worship so much because worship creates
[1:27:09] a space
[1:27:10] for God to move worship invites the
[1:27:13] presence of the Lord for him to break
[1:27:15] the scriptures open to us so that you
[1:27:18] could see that your name is written in
[1:27:20] heaven and when you catch it when you
[1:27:23] understand who you are then the devil is
[1:27:26] in trouble then brother oh it's in
[1:27:29] trouble in your life he's in trouble in
[1:27:32] your situation he's in trouble in your
[1:27:34] circumstance because it's inspired to
[1:27:36] you and you know that no teller could
[1:27:39] take it away from you because they'll
[1:27:41] never give it to you in the first place
[1:27:42] it was God that called you it was his
[1:27:46] voice that spoke to your heart they'll
[1:27:49] let you know who you are and who you are
[1:27:53] Oh somebody shot a man
[1:27:56] [Applause]
[1:28:06] oh my oh my hallelujah hallelujah it's a
[1:28:13] power of the word don't worry about the
[1:28:16] signs and wonders it'll come but stay
[1:28:19] with that word once you see what that
[1:28:21] word God will reprimand the signs will
[1:28:26] follow them that believe
[1:28:29] hallelujah the signs and wonders our
[1:28:32] promise to follow him that believe I'm
[1:28:35] not call upon his name and not keep the
[1:28:38] prophecies of the saying of this book
[1:28:40] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:28:43] so don't rejoice because the Devils are
[1:28:45] subject to you but rejoice rather
[1:28:48] because your name is written in heaven
[1:28:50] oh the case of hepcat prevail against
[1:28:59] them but I said now let me just put a
[1:29:01] word in here from my own ministry if you
[1:29:05] don't mind he may said you all know that
[1:29:08] the gift in my life is supernatural
[1:29:09] it is a gift whereby the Holy Spirit is
[1:29:13] able to discern a diseases and the
[1:29:16] thoughts of men's hearts and other
[1:29:19] hidden things that only God could know
[1:29:21] and then reveal to me he said I wish you
[1:29:24] could stand with me and see the faces of
[1:29:28] people when Satan knows he's going to be
[1:29:32] exposed
[1:29:33] he said now it isn't the people that I'm
[1:29:36] talking about is that it is that Satan
[1:29:39] God our world and their lives true sin
[1:29:43] indifference and disease but you should
[1:29:47] see their faces
[1:29:49] when Satan knows is going to be exposed
[1:29:52] he said it's the most peculiar changes
[1:29:56] now come over people's countenances this
[1:30:02] is something huh
[1:30:03] said Satan is a free he's a free this
[1:30:11] morning yeah he's very afraid

[1:30:19] hide in shady places kind of cockroach
[1:30:22] mentality praise God he knows that the
[1:30:26] Spirit of God is about to let the people
[1:30:29] know his works and that is why he hates
[1:30:33] these meetings so much oh that's why he

[1:31:12] have joy in the middle of your town in
[1:31:16] the middle of your circumstance you
[1:31:19] expose the devil for what he is he's a
[1:31:23] liar and he's a bluff he told joke I'll

[1:31:30] don't go rather I'll get you to curse
[1:31:33] you to your face
[1:31:34] and he did all he could it was a mighty
[1:31:37] onslaught of Satan against job's life

[1:36:57] forever I'll sing forever oh and through
[1:37:01] these gates with Thanksgiving and
[1:37:03] auntie's courts with praise
[1:37:05] we are his people and the Sheep of his
[1:37:08] pasture Oh wonderful
[1:37:27] so we explain exposing the enemy this
[1:37:29] morning I ran my sea for what he is all
[1:37:32] right
[1:37:33] Satan hates it he's afraid see now that
[1:37:37] no what is it what is this he said it's
[1:37:41] not mine reading it's not telepathy
[1:37:44] nor is it witchcraft he said it is a
[1:37:47] revelation by the Holy Ghost amen amen
[1:37:51] the same spirit he said the comforter
[1:37:54] will come I light a spirit of truth and
[1:37:56] guide you into all truth how does it
[1:37:59] come by the Holy Ghost amen amen that's
[1:38:02] the only way I can know it he said of
[1:38:04] course the carnal mind will call it
[1:38:07] anything but the Holy Ghost a man is not
[1:38:10] right but we see it for what it is a man
[1:38:13] oh how ideal of him this morning a man
[1:38:16] is more familiar to you he said now let
[1:38:18] me show you another reason why Satan
[1:38:19] hates the book of revelation of Jesus
[1:38:21] Christ in the church he knows that Jesus
[1:38:24] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:38:25] forever he changes not he knows that a
[1:38:28] whole lot more than do 90% of the
[1:38:31] theologians do so Satan knows I mean he
[1:38:36] was there in the beginning
[1:38:37] he worship with the Angels he was one of
[1:38:40] the most beautiful of them all is now
[1:38:43] Bible says pipes were built inside of
[1:38:45] him he was a musician a man and the
[1:38:47] Peter he was created a mesmerize a man
[1:38:51] he knows about worship he wanted worship
[1:38:54] he was deceived hallelujah but there was
[1:38:57] no grace for him and when he was
[1:38:59] deceived and he led the other angels a
[1:39:01] strain they too were deceived also isn't
[1:39:04] that right hallelujah is now right and
[1:39:08] he fell from the former stage that's why
[1:39:10] Jesus said I perceived Satan come down
[1:39:12] from heaven as lightning and he come
[1:39:15] down to the earth according to
[1:39:16] revelation 12 seeing
[1:39:18] one to the inhabiters of the earth for
[1:39:21] the enemy has come down to you and he
[1:39:23] knows he has but a short time he knows
[1:39:27] what's taking place he knows what's
[1:39:29] going on he knows it's night
[1:39:32] he was waiting till a wrong Genesis tree
[1:39:35] we hear about the serpent the most
[1:39:38] subtle beast of the field is not right
[1:39:40] who come to have a conversation with Eve
[1:39:44] Oh with the woman at that time because
[1:39:47] she wasn't called Eve until she ate
[1:39:48] until a man later on down a man in the
[1:39:51] judgments then she was called a woman
[1:39:53] and he had to come to have a
[1:39:54] conversation with a woman because the
[1:39:56] devil began to see things taking place
[1:39:58] and the devil was looking all the time
[1:40:01] but an opportunity where he could slip
[1:40:05] in to the program of God I don't know
[1:40:08] how long he was on yet but he came down
[1:40:11] on the earth
[1:40:11] he might have seen man form from the
[1:40:14] dust of the earth waiting to see where
[1:40:16] he could slip in he saw a woman come out
[1:40:19] a man he was waiting waiting waiting
[1:40:21] waiting for his opportunity waiting for
[1:40:24] his moment to grasp to take to steal to
[1:40:28] rob and to destroy Oh hallelujah is not
[1:40:31] it's not right hallelujah are waiting
[1:40:35] for an opportunity for a moment watch to
[1:40:37] twist the pure Word of God you guys
[1:40:41] remember the devil is not a creator he's
[1:40:43] a pervert he's a pervert of the original
[1:40:46] it's not everything that devil has is
[1:40:50] just a little substitute of what we
[1:40:53] think the real thing is he's just
[1:40:55] provided substitutes so a pervert
[1:41:00] so this allusion of this modern age that
[1:41:04] we live in and people also think it's so
[1:41:07] wonderful and they wanted to go on
[1:41:09] forever like this but little does man
[1:41:12] know that the glory that God has beyond
[1:41:16] the sky beyond the river is far more
[1:41:20] glorious than
[1:41:22] thing that ever could create down here
[1:41:25] [Applause]
[1:41:29] [Music]
[1:41:31] nothing that never could do that ever
[1:41:34] come close in its glory
[1:41:36] so what God has for you and I when you
[1:41:40] cross that River nothing that the devil
[1:41:43] could create could be more beautiful to
[1:41:46] be more attractive than what God has for
[1:41:48] us so they are waiting on us the
[1:41:56] comfortable faction to go to a glorious
[1:41:58] wonderful perfect City as a bride
[1:42:02] adorned for her husband oh you are
[1:42:04] promised to go in there will be the
[1:42:09] light oh right now they think they have

[1:46:52] he said then I mentioned then it takes a
[1:46:55] Holy Spirit to give us revelation or we
[1:46:57] fail to get it bringing these two talks
[1:47:01] together you will see that it won't just
[1:47:03] take an ordinary study to make this book
[1:47:05] real inside but it's going to take the
[1:47:07] operation of the Holy Ghost that that
[1:47:11] that means watch what does it mean is
[1:47:14] that it means that this book can't be
[1:47:17] revealed to anyone but a special class
[1:47:20] of people let me say it again and I felt
[1:47:27] like it went over your head he said that
[1:47:29] means that this book cannot be revealed
[1:47:31] to just anyone but it must be revealed
[1:47:34] to a special class of people it will
[1:47:39] take one with prophetic insight it will
[1:47:42] require the ability to hear from God he
[1:47:49] taught in here let him hear what the
[1:47:53] Spirit is saying unto the churches God
[1:47:56] has a word for you this morning
[1:47:58] Oh a special class of people that's who
[1:48:06] you are this morning a special class
[1:48:09] they are soldiers and then they're
[1:48:12] special soldiers it have forces and then
[1:48:16] there are special forces you are special
[1:48:20] class of people because prophet said so
[1:48:23] because not everyone can understand this
[1:48:26] but blessed are your hears for what they
[1:48:29] hear blessed that I are eyes for what
[1:48:31] you see Oh your heart is blessed this
[1:48:34] morning because you understand what is
[1:48:38] written in this book
[1:48:41] [Applause]
[1:48:44] [Laughter]
[1:48:48] if luta was the common Sh
[1:48:51] and you had to explain to him what was
[1:48:54] taking place his mine will be blue
[1:48:56] because he didn't even know the fullness
[1:48:59] of this this image here this journey
[1:49:02] here at God took throughout the ages he
[1:49:04] would have to wander on Marvel and how
[1:49:07] he fits in there with patience it's not
[1:49:09] if Wesley come not here he didn't him
[1:49:12] understand the magnitude of what he was
[1:49:15] doing but he was proclaiming the Word of
[1:49:17] God in his age with all assurance with
[1:49:21] all revelation and what was it it was
[1:49:24] caught inspiring the word to each man in
[1:49:28] that day it's not they were all living
[1:49:32] out something they were all living out a
[1:49:34] mystery they were hid in God and each
[1:49:38] one broke out well it's not proclaiming
[1:49:42] something proclaiming the acceptable
[1:49:44] year proclaiming the Word of God
[1:49:46] proclaiming what Paul had said
[1:49:49] concerning the age and concerning their
[1:49:52] time and there was always a people to
[1:49:56] come out on every messenger in that age
[1:50:00] and just as sure as there was a prophet
[1:50:03] in this last day a mighty prophet who
[1:50:07] under which cord wrought miracles and
[1:50:09] signs and wonders he prophesied that the
[1:50:14] bride hasn't had a revival yet he
[1:50:16] suffered when the seven thunders uttered
[1:50:18] a group sudo coupe that can really take
[1:50:22] the Word of God and can hand it there it
[1:50:26] will slice it will cut till shut the
[1:50:29] heavens they'll open it till to whatever
[1:50:33] they want to praise hallelujah Oh
[1:50:37] [Music]
[1:50:39] [Applause]
[1:50:41] Oh hallelujah a special class of people
[1:50:53] one day the devil's gonna realize he was
[1:50:56] parking up the wrong tree one day the
[1:50:58] devil is gonna realize and he was
[1:51:00] messing with dynamite the whole time but
[1:51:03] she was hidden car this morning just as
[1:51:06] caught him this have some simplicity you
[1:51:08] were hidden in a black part of his mind
[1:51:10] he wanted to bring you forth but it
[1:51:13] wasn't time yet but when Luther came on
[1:51:15] and Wesley came on a lolly and the
[1:51:17] Pentecostals came on it begins they get
[1:51:19] closer and closer and closer to the
[1:51:22] fulfillment of the word so that this
[1:51:24] mighty pride could come forth we wasn't
[1:51:27] a comfort in part know we might know in
[1:51:31] part on prophesy in part but we was a
[1:51:33] comfort and perfection so in order for
[1:51:35] us to come forth in perfection he had to
[1:51:38] make a way for perfection hallelujah
[1:51:42] praise God hallelujah glory to God oh my
[1:51:47] are you catching me you are his
[1:51:54] wonderful glorious virtuous bra
[1:51:59] hallelujah
[1:52:01] isn't that right God loved you so much
[1:52:04] he wants you to come for the perfection
[1:52:06] so he had to make a way for that so he
[1:52:08] had to create a atmosphere how do you
[1:52:11] have to bring the word down hallelujah
[1:52:14] praise God the fullness of it and reveal
[1:52:16] it is profit not profit at a profit sir
[1:52:19] Honolulu is nice it was called for the
[1:52:22] pride in our last day
[1:52:23] Honolulu under her messenger and she
[1:52:26] would be the final voice to the finally
[1:52:28] holler she in order to be the final
[1:52:31] voice it had to come forth in the final
[1:52:33] age then you had to be here
[1:52:36] you couldn't come for the Luther's age
[1:52:38] oh that was a specification that wasn't
[1:52:42] a final age yet are you getting me okay
[1:52:55] all right back a little bit amen oh but
[1:52:58] a mystery said you see woky it will
[1:53:00] require a supernatural instruction it
[1:53:02] will require the ability to hear from
[1:53:03] God it's not right not just a student
[1:53:06] comparing verse to verse though that is
[1:53:09] good but a mystery requires the teaching
[1:53:12] of the spirit or it never becomes clear
[1:53:15] how we need to hear from God and lay
[1:53:19] ourselves open and become yielded to the
[1:53:22] spirit to hear and to know oh is that
[1:53:25] why we're here this morning to lay
[1:53:27] ourselves open to God that he could
[1:53:29] speak to us that he could show us his
[1:53:32] glory that he could show us all as
[1:53:34] reveal concerning us Oh hallelujah
[1:53:37] hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right
[1:53:38] that's why we get in a spirit and get
[1:53:41] Mel around their goal could speak at
[1:53:43] hollowed out so that God could speak to
[1:53:46] you only then the Spirit beholding his
[1:53:49] face shut in with God in a secret place
[1:53:53] Oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:53:58] I want to be so hidden in the presence
[1:54:01] of God until he could speak to us until
[1:54:04] his spirit could flow over you wanna
[1:54:07] take away all your bitterness take away
[1:54:09] all their evil take away all their
[1:54:11] clamoring and commotion and strife pull
[1:54:14] that all out of you we were born in sin
[1:54:17] shipped in iniquity but because there's
[1:54:20] a greater purpose in your heart God had
[1:54:23] to pull all that dross back off of you
[1:54:25] so he had to take you through a process
[1:54:27] so that you could be cut into the
[1:54:29] diamond you have to take it to a process
[1:54:31] so that he could beat you into pure gold
[1:54:33] you have to take you to a process
[1:54:46] revelation 1 says I was in the spirit on
[1:54:49] the Lord's Day and heard behind me a
[1:54:52] great voice as of a trumpet isn't that
[1:54:55] right talking with me Amen John was in
[1:54:58] the spirit ohana so - we've got get in

[1:55:02] coming of the Lord

[1:55:06] waiting for his coming and when we wait
[1:55:09] for his coming watching and watching
[1:55:11] we're making ourselves ready the Bible
[1:55:13] says his wife had made herself ready
[1:55:15] Hollan is not who is she the Lambs wife
[1:55:20] she is a pride of Jesus Christ she knows
[1:55:23] who she is she knows her spirits that's
[1:55:26] supposed to come to her in this last day
[1:55:28] hallelujah she's watching for it she's
[1:55:31] watching for his coming she knows he's
[1:55:33] out there somewhere
[1:55:34] she can feel it she knows the same part
[1:55:37] I poured out in the day of Pentecost is
[1:55:40] the same Jesus that's promised to come
[1:55:43] back again and anoint a bride in a last
[1:55:46] time it's the same power that will take
[1:55:49] her up out of the earth and into glory
[1:55:51] Oh hallelujah praise car
[1:56:00] hallelujah hallelujah oh man
[1:56:04] praise God so we identify the devil
[1:56:07] already amen is that a man he is that
[1:56:11] serpent the devil Lucifer that was cast
[1:56:14] out of heaven isn't that right
[1:56:17] revelation 13:8 all that dwell upon the
[1:56:20] earth shall worship Him whose names are
[1:56:23] not written in the book of life of the
[1:56:26] lamb slain from the foundation of the
[1:56:28] world it's not all shower ship that's a
[1:56:33] prophecy all of them to hide the mighty
[1:56:35] the one who think there's something
[1:56:37] priest caught as long as their name is
[1:56:39] not in this book praise God hallelujah
[1:56:41] all shall worship but it also says
[1:56:44] except those whose names except a man
[1:56:47] also worship him except those whose
[1:56:49] names are written amen
[1:56:51] those whose names are not written the
[1:56:53] book of life for same from the
[1:56:55] foundation world a man is now reign
[1:56:57] hallelujah
[1:56:58] so all shall worship Him except those
[1:57:00] names that are written in the blood
[1:57:02] section of the book isn't that right
[1:57:04] that's where God hid you inside of there
[1:57:06] hallelujah praise God amen hallelujah is
[1:57:09] now now watch
[1:57:11] amen hallelujah so we said the devil is
[1:57:14] a pervert isn't that right he's a
[1:57:15] polluted original truth he knows he
[1:57:17] original he knows a message but he comes
[1:57:19] down and he perverts it and he twists it
[1:57:21] why because he knows that when he does
[1:57:24] that
[1:57:24] it becomes cold formal and powerless
[1:57:27] isn't it
[1:57:28] and then I become the word of comes up
[1:57:30] non effect it's not hallelujah no
[1:57:34] because it's out of position it's out of
[1:57:37] place it's like a puzzle piece
[1:57:39] no all right without revelation if the
[1:57:44] bird is supposed to be in a tree the
[1:57:45] bird ends up in the grass and the call
[1:57:47] ends up in a tree hallelujah no
[1:57:50] revelation you haven't put it together
[1:57:51] right Amen well with divine revelation
[1:57:54] in our lives we know what we are and
[1:57:56] what we are supposed to produce is now
[1:58:00] hallelujah hallelujah the Prophet said
[1:58:02] if you don't have revelation he said if
[1:58:04] you don't know what a bathtub is he said
[1:58:06] somebody could give you a watermelon and
[1:58:08] tell you that is this is
[1:58:10] and you believe it because you don't
[1:58:12] know for yourself but when it's revealed
[1:58:14] to you what it is no one can deceive you
[1:58:17] no one can mess you up
[1:58:19] isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah
[1:58:23] like what but over is talking about with
[1:58:25] the original and then you have the
[1:58:27] substitute substitute it's not a man
[1:58:31] it's like somebody goes down to a car
[1:58:33] parts place and they tell him this is
[1:58:34] the part for this said I come looking
[1:58:36] for your part and make people take
[1:58:38] advantage of the ignorance a man they
[1:58:41] don't know the price they don't know
