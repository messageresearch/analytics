[28:52] we have prairie Quest we will take right
[28:54] after the service
[28:55] and um what a time we had last service
[28:58] but Isaac where is the Lord God of
[29:01] Elijah
[29:02] so we wanted to know about the second
[29:03] Kings 2 14 15 just want to come behind
[29:05] him to share something with you
[29:08] um
[29:09] Isaiah 61 1-2 Second Kings 2 14 and 15
[29:14] and revelation 22. verse 17. so let's
[29:19] read from Second Kings 2
[29:22] 14 and 15 and he took the mantle of
[29:25] Elijah that fell from him and smote the
[29:28] waters and said where is the Lord God of
[29:29] Elijah when he also had spit in the
[29:32] waters departed his antither and Elisha
[29:34] went over when the sons of the prophets
[29:36] were to view a Jericho saw him they said
[29:40] the spirit of Elijah not rest on Elisha
[29:44] and they came to meet him and bow
[29:46] themselves to the ground before him
[29:49] Isaiah chapter 61 written verse 1 and 2.
[29:53] the spirit of the Lord God is upon me
[29:56] because the Lord had anointed me to
[29:59] preach good Titans unto the meek yet
[30:01] sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to
[30:04] Proclaim Liberty to the captors and the
[30:06] opening of the prison to them that are
[30:07] bound to proclaim the acceptability of
[30:10] the Lord than the dear Vengeance of our
[30:13] God to comfort all that mourn last
[30:16] scripture reversion 22 verse 17. and the
[30:20] spirit
[30:21] and the bride say come let him that
[30:24] Herod should come let him that the tears
[30:26] come and whosoever will let him take the
[30:30] what of Life freely may God bless his
[30:31] word you may be seated we are so
[30:33] grateful to be in his presence
[30:35] with all this presence we are nothing
[30:38] so from second Kings chapter two we're
[30:40] just going to read back something there
[30:42] verse 9 it says he came to pass when
[30:44] they were gone over
[30:46] that's Jordan that Elijah said and
[30:48] Elisha acts what I shall do physique
[30:51] before I be taken away from thee and
[30:54] Elijah said I praise thee let a double
[30:56] portion of thy spirit
[30:58] be upon me
[31:00] and he said thou husband
[31:01] ask a hard thing nevertheless if those
[31:05] see me when I am taken from thee it
[31:07] shall be so unto thee but if not it
[31:09] shall not be so so it was conditional
[31:11] and it came to pass as they went on and
[31:13] talked behold they appeared a child of
[31:15] fire horses a fan party them both
[31:17] asunder and Elijah went up in a
[31:20] whirlwind into heaven
[31:21] Elijah went up in a chariot of Fire
[31:25] Hallelujah so tonight I want to take a
[31:27] title when Elijah said he said ax what I
[31:31] shall do for thee before I take him from
[31:33] thee and Elijah said I pray he let a
[31:35] double portion of thy Spirit be upon me
[31:37] that's the title tonight let out the
[31:39] proportion of thy Spirit be upon me you
[31:41] want another proportion tonight you do
[31:43] just want a blessing you want a double
[31:44] portion tonight so that's my titles and
[31:47] I let a double portion of thy Spirit be
[31:49] upon me it's a prayer it's a request
[31:51] it's what you're asking for it's what
[31:52] you desire is what you want from God you
[31:55] need that double portion isn't that
[31:57] right praise the name and he said if you
[31:59] see me go you can have that portion you
[32:01] got to know that's the condition you
[32:03] have to see me go praise God you have to
[32:05] know that amen Elias has already come
[32:07] William Branham came and do all that he
[32:09] had was to do and every direction faith
[32:12] is leaning the messages everything we
[32:14] have needed is already on the earth
[32:15] everything we have need of is already on
[32:18] the earth it's already here do you
[32:20] believe that tonight oh praise the name
[32:22] of the Lord we believe that Hallelujah
[32:25] give me a double portion that's what you
[32:27] want I want a double portion in that
[32:28] right so God had to send the anointing
[32:31] for the Rapture isn't that right so he
[32:33] had to send the Elijah anointing because
[32:35] the anointed to take you up praise God
[32:38] as a Rapture anointing the Elijah
[32:40] anointing praise God Elijah got caught
[32:42] up in a child by Whirlwind isn't that
[32:44] right so the Rapture anointing of the
[32:46] come of Elijah goes and behold lights
[32:48] and United the prophet but that spirit
[32:50] is what went up oh glory to God that
[32:53] Spirit was raptured Oh Glory to God in
[32:55] that anointing fell long on Elisha isn't
[32:58] that right Hallelujah blessed be the
[33:00] name of the Lord do you believe that so
[33:02] he releases Seven Seals it's not right
[33:04] that's the power of God the word of God
[33:06] but it takes Faith to move that power
[33:08] we're going to get down here tonight but
[33:10] Abraham the we are true prophet he says
[33:12] Elijah went to Jordan one day and struck
[33:14] it with Elisha it parted back and he
[33:16] crossed over and he come back with
[33:18] another proportion so when he came back
[33:20] he actually came back to the rubber
[33:21] portion and when we strike Jordan we'll
[33:24] give the Lord a shout that's a prophecy
[33:26] tonight you know not if not when we
[33:29] strike Jordan with Christ we got one
[33:33] portion but when we return we are coming
[33:36] with two portions we got eternal life
[33:38] Resurrection from sin now in
[33:41] righteousness with the Holy Ghost and
[33:43] then on the return with Christ we come
[33:45] back with both physical Resurrection we
[33:47] already got a spiritual Resurrection so
[33:49] you've got to get the spiritual
[33:50] resurrection and the physical
[33:52] Resurrection okay the Lord a shout we
[33:55] need that of proportion we're going to
[33:56] come back with another portion we have
[33:58] to have a double portion we'll give the
[34:00] Lord some Praises Hallelujah we have a
[34:02] double portion of it always a type of
[34:04] Christ Elisha and Elijah so there's a
[34:08] spiritual resurrection that has to go on
[34:10] now and there's a physical Resurrection
[34:13] so it's a double portion for the
[34:15] resurrection and the Rapture oh give the
[34:17] Lord a shout in the house did you hear
[34:19] that a double portion for the
[34:22] resurrection and the Rapture there's
[34:23] going to be a resurrection the whole
[34:25] glory to God and we who are alive and
[34:27] remain
[34:28] them who have gone on it's not right

[44:22] hold our peace when we see things going
[44:24] on the way it is it is time to take this
[44:28] holy spirit that we Anointed with and
[44:30] say where is the Lord God that was Upon
[44:34] Jesus Christ where is the god of Abraham
[44:36] Isaac and Jacob where is the god that
[44:39] was our Lord Jesus Christ he said we
[44:41] have to say that God God say that for
[44:43] you you can't make God say that for you
[44:46] you have to want it what you want a

[45:10] had some want to turn back to although
[45:12] Elijah was gone and that there was one
[45:15] that poured water in his hands had the
[45:16] double portion of the spirit so is the
[45:19] sick and sinful world looking here we go
[45:22] the second sinful were looking forward
[45:24] they look into a real Church
[45:26] of the Living God who possesses a double
[45:30] portion of his spirit
[45:34] not professors
[45:38] a double portion of his spirit
[45:40] what can we do in this time brother our
[45:43] answer should be who is going to be the
[45:45] next president our answer shouldn't be
[45:47] who's going to be the next president or
[45:48] some theology we should gift them the
[45:51] Living God the Resurrected
[45:54] Lord Jesus Christ could you imagine
[45:55] being able to produce the resurrected

[46:17] resurrected Lord Jesus Christ is back on
[46:19] the Earth
[46:20] confirming the word with signs with
[46:22] wonders with Miracles not someone

[46:26] resurrected Jesus Christ after every
[46:28] syllabus he could say I am waiting
[46:30] prayer line so and so and so you're sick
[46:33] but so and so and so and Christ come in
[46:35] and heal the people he said I'm not the
[46:36] Healer Jesus Is A Healer but you have to
[46:38] have faith to call him on the scene okay
[46:40] the Lord some Praises Oh Glory to God
[46:42] when are we going to make professions
[46:44] for that we can't be talking for our

[46:50] with no anointing okay the Lord some
[46:53] Praises it has to be a space where God
[46:56] can drop down Hallelujah it has to be a
[46:59] space where the minister get out of the
[47:02] way and the Holy Spirit began to work
[47:04] and begin to move Oh Glory to God
[47:06] hallelujah praise God praise God
[47:09] hallelujah
[47:11] Christ the mission of God revealed
[47:13] Christ revealing his own word he said I
[47:15] can't see with your hands yes it's part
[47:16] of your body you can't see with the ears
[47:19] yet it can hear you can't see but the
[47:21] nose yet it smells you can't see with
[47:24] the lips though it speaks that was the
[47:26] Pentecostal age but now it's high time
[47:29] seeing
[47:31] no there isn't one moving faculty beyond
[47:34] the eye the next is the intelligence
[47:36] which is Christ himself who controls the
[47:40] whole body not some man from America
[47:42] sorry
[47:43] not some not some Modern bishop or some
[47:46] Modern message Pope I call them and I
[47:48] preaching this long time blasting
[47:50] message Pope who look under control and
[47:51] have influence over no next after the
[47:54] prophet supposedly the intelligence
[47:55] watch see praise the name of the Lord
[47:59] hallelujah praise be to Jesus
[48:04] all right let's let's go
[48:06] watch see down to the age we started off
[48:08] from the foundation from the first
[48:09] church age the seed went into the ground
[48:11] complete seed then it comes to defeat
[48:13] Luther
[48:14] come back out through Wesley into the
[48:16] Pentecostal the tongues and the lips now
[48:19] it's the eyes prophetic of Malachi 4. so
[48:23] he identified his ministry the prophetic
[48:26] as the eyes he's the Seer but next he
[48:29] said but no there's nothing else for him
[48:31] to come but well okay but now
[48:34] there is nothing else left for it to
[48:36] come but him himself to step into that
[48:40] because that's the last thing there is
[48:42] so the prophet brought the sin right
[48:45] Division and make it plain he brought
[48:47] the vision that he that weird can run no
[48:50] he formed something that Christ himself
[48:53] could step into it oh glory to God which
[48:56] is all about the same one that pick up
[48:57] Isaiah 61 the same one that walked into
[49:00] the temple after you overcome Lucifer
[49:02] with lust of the eyes lust of the Flesh
[49:03] and the pride of life after the overcome
[49:05] himself that same one that went in the
[49:07] templates in the spirit is upon me for
[49:09] he anointed me he knew he was just not
[49:11] reading scripture he knew this day in
[49:14] scripture was being fulfilled he knew
[49:16] the seasonal changed because it was not
[49:19] no longer the prophet what was the
[49:21] prophet's prophecy oh give me a praise
[49:23] God hallelujah my God I'm having a
[49:25] Revival yet tonight Oh Glory God Jesus
[49:28] knew it was no longer Prophet John
[49:31] Elijah it was now the prophet's prophet
[49:34] see Behold the Lamb of God oh glory to
[49:37] God I take away the sins of the world
[49:39] hallelujah praise God Oh Glory the god
[49:42] that Mantle hit Jesus and the fullness
[49:45] the spirit coming upon him oh Hallelujah
[49:48] the fullness Came Upon him led by the
[49:52] spirit Into the Wilderness to overcome
[49:54] that devil and when he finished with the
[49:56] devil you overcome that devil to give us
[49:58] a witness it is written it is written it
[50:01] is also written he demonstrated no power
[50:03] he demonstrated no witness to the devil
[50:05] at all Unicode scripture walk into the
[50:07] temple find his own scripture the spirit
[50:10] is upon me because he anointed me but be
[50:13] fine all scripture tonight Revelation
[50:14] 2-17 the spirit and the bride we are to
[50:18] find our own scripture we have a
[50:19] scripture Oh Glory to God to break into
[50:21] the spirit realm we have a scripture
[50:23] that we could take brother Stephen and
[50:25] identify as the month of Elijah coming
[50:28] down upon her bride the Spirit charity
[50:30] will give the Lord some Praises that has
[50:33] to come upon a bride it will glory
[50:35] record the thing that can't fail even
[50:37] the voice of the Archangel okay the Lord
[50:39] I shout them is going to be a
[50:40] resurrection there is going to be a
[50:42] power strike the church Oh Glory to God
[50:45] and no coming in when man will speak the
[50:48] word
[50:48] gonna flash like lightning
[50:51] Hallelujah there is nothing else left
[50:53] here to come but him himself to step
[50:57] into that because that the last thing
[50:59] there is the next is the intelligence no
[51:02] we have no intelligence of our own we
[51:04] have no sight of our own and so forth
[51:06] like that one Oneness
[51:08] watch the Commandment is so imminent
[51:10] second coming of Jesus his garden is
[51:12] elected together he has got a Oneness
[51:15] his true one is showing himself among
[51:16] them out of every denomination bringing
[51:19] his leg together from all kinds of her
[51:22] churches from everywhere bringing out
[51:24] his children falling right in line with
[51:26] the word now the coming of the Lord
[51:28] Jesus is so imminent the coming of
[51:29] judgment
[51:30] coming up Jesus
[51:32] criminal judgment he's calling is
[51:35] elected together in Oneness with himself
[51:39] and with the same kind of ministry he
[51:42] had
[51:42] so the prophecy is the same Ministry has
[51:46] to come back among us to bring on that
[51:48] Oneness not the books
[51:51] not the tapes not brother so and so from
[51:53] foreign
[51:56] Ministry that means how to be Same
[51:58] Spirit
[52:02] watch this now you know how I shape the
[52:05] churches yes the big Torah was built
[52:07] called the pyramid and Hudson was never
[52:09] put on it remember how the Lutheran
[52:11] scheme Wesley in the minority then down
[52:13] to Pentecost and how what he's doing
[52:16] he's calling from that what did he do he
[52:19] called out the election
[52:22] Lutheran
[52:25] is our message
[52:29] to his thing all these books on tips you
[52:33] cannot believe us that call really
[52:34] shouting
[52:35] it having left who is the bride
[52:37] oh how the rest is tribulation since
[52:40] that's why identifying them all right
[52:43] what he's doing he's calling from what
[52:45] he called out the elect out of Lutheran
[52:47] to make the Wesleyan he could already
[52:49] let out of that to make the Pentecostal
[52:51] now he is calling the elect and the
[52:53] castle out to make the headstone
[52:57] the commented
[52:58] or you mean so brother Brandon was
[53:00] building a building
[53:02] and he was building this headstone
[53:04] that he that God himself could step into
[53:08] it
[53:10] govern the whole body
[53:12] because the headstone pulling up the
[53:14] whole thing
[53:15] The Headstone is the magnet
[53:17] that raising the dead and picking up the
[53:20] the the Riu alive and Remains The
[53:23] Headstone is the magnet oh my hallelujah

[53:31] Holy Ghost on the inside so when the big
[53:33] magnet come it picks up that and you win
[53:35] with it or give the Lord a shout

[54:01] so you are being stolen it's called the
[54:03] laodicia to fit into that Holy Ghost
[54:05] slot all right now here it is notice
[54:07] this is when the Holy Spirit told Brown

[1:00:39] will test you to see if you will obey
[1:00:41] evenly Little Things
[1:00:43] another one of the big things of little
[1:00:45] things little things here's a secret the
[1:00:48] wood is in the bride won and the mind of
[1:00:50] Christ two to know what he wants done
[1:00:52] with the word she does it his name she
[1:00:55] has thus here the Lord
[1:00:57] so if I'm part of this bright I have
[1:00:59] tonight don't say the Lord because God
[1:01:01] sent a prophet with us here the Lord and
[1:01:03] if I receive him I have that
[1:01:06] I have the authority to check every man
[1:01:08] by the word
[1:01:10] to try every spirit I don't care what
[1:01:12] your name and your surname is it doesn't
[1:01:14] matter what name you have and how long
[1:01:16] in the message this is the word here and
[1:01:19] Paul said another angel from America and
[1:01:21] eventually come from Heaven one which
[1:01:22] threat back wings and say any other
[1:01:24] thing that what this will say
[1:01:26] crack your book your book you're gonna
[1:01:28] shoot you know blast it you know because
[1:01:31] that is of the word understand this he
[1:01:34] said this will come unto a razor edge
[1:01:37] think about it now how sharp you have to
[1:01:39] be in the wood there's no joking like
[1:01:41] the message is fighting baptism
[1:01:43] this is a message fighting message
[1:01:47] you never had before
[1:01:50] the but the battle is right inside
[1:01:53] prophecy two Spirits working
[1:01:56] not one working alone you know two of
[1:01:58] them working one trying to match up the
[1:02:00] church one trying to bring cold formal
[1:02:03] Spirits one trying to to dry up the
[1:02:06] anointing job the atmosphere nice people
[1:02:08] you know Anointed with spirits
[1:02:12] and the other one is the Holy Ghost
[1:02:14] one Spirit trying to bind the church to
[1:02:16] bring him on this objection to some
[1:02:17] overseas
[1:02:18] Bishop
[1:02:21] Liberty to preach and speak what they
[1:02:24] put upon the heart so the man of God no
[1:02:27] longer have the rights to speak what God
[1:02:29] lay upon his heart he had to check
[1:02:30] headquarters hello what they play
[1:02:32] tonight
[1:02:35] you blame that too
[1:02:37] and then God completely out of it you
[1:02:39] see this is what happened in Old
[1:02:40] Testament you know they was playing the
[1:02:42] tips every Saturday

[1:06:56] under the spirit of entitlement that
[1:06:58] that entitles them to go any Rapture
[1:06:59] they are entitled to be fully received
[1:07:03] but believe in that foolishness they
[1:07:05] figure that because they have books and
[1:07:07] tips they're entitled to go in the
[1:07:09] Rapture that's a lie that comes from
[1:07:11] hell that have nothing to do with what
[1:07:13] is prophesied but I'm saying hear me
[1:07:15] Brandon Tabernacle you have to be
[1:07:17] talking displayed spirit
[1:07:38] did you have to see the spirit working
[1:07:40] not when I see church not when I see

[1:08:10] Spirit Waters it until it is grown and
[1:08:14] serve its purpose
[1:08:15] the Holy Spirit does what
[1:08:17] what is it that's what Rebecca did right
[1:08:19] now what the man of God prayed and said
[1:08:21] the servant says if the damselves that
[1:08:24] come and water my camel I'll give him
[1:08:25] what me get me water let that be the one
[1:08:27] for Isaac shout the water camel and give

[1:08:39] God you have to be a genuine Holy Ghost
[1:08:41] Worship in the church we can't get
[1:08:43] around that just as we can't get the
[1:08:45] wrong brotherly kindness we could we
[1:08:47] can't get around that
[1:08:49] so much I hate us in this message now
[1:08:51] you don't even know if they're saved
[1:08:53] tell people who like and I'm not even
[1:08:55] sure they're saved if they ever had a
[1:08:57] revelation or experience of Salvation
[1:09:00] not that kind of behavior it is
[1:09:02] absolutely horrible it I've seen as an
[1:09:04] unbelievers be even better than that no
[1:09:07] excuses none
[1:09:09] none no excuses well he do this and he
[1:09:13] don't have none
[1:09:17] because Revelation 2017
[1:09:21] is the bright expression
[1:09:23] of mercy and Grace
[1:09:25] an extension of life
[1:09:28] to whosoever Will
[1:09:34] revelation 22 17 is the key to the
[1:09:37] Jubilee

[1:09:42] delivered
[1:09:47] the spirit and the brights that come
[1:09:51] let him that heareth say come
[1:09:53] and whosoever will
[1:09:55] that is final Mercy
[1:09:58] only the spirit could do that people
[1:10:00] cutting you off they just want to shock
[1:10:01] this one is this this one is false this
[1:10:03] one is this and they're judging and
[1:10:04] they're judging the judging like they're
[1:10:05] playing God
[1:10:09] and the Bible said is somebody a cup of
[1:10:11] water they shall not miss the reward
[1:10:13] and these Jokers blame God
[1:10:15] trying to take people only book I gave
[1:10:17] them only book
[1:10:23] and the anointed
[1:10:25] and the people believe the foolishness
[1:10:29] I said that nonsense that they believe
[1:10:30] that the bride that little Club they
[1:10:32] have there that little cult
[1:10:33] that's the bride that the bride or what
[1:10:35] that was a brighter the man

[1:11:11] looking for friction looking for a fight
[1:11:12] you're looking
[1:11:15] don't worry we did no better
[1:11:17] in the early days you're looking fast
[1:11:19] forward when you see a sharp but when
[1:11:21] you study some Moody you're looking for

[1:12:53] he said the one you see the spirit
[1:12:55] coming along and resting so people can
[1:12:56] rest and then disappear and leave rest
[1:12:59] leave rest leave rest leave the one
[1:13:01] remain so he only see the dove come and
[1:13:03] Jesus and remain they say oh God that's
[1:13:04] the one
[1:13:06] when she is coming to him he said you

[1:19:49] coming when it's going to be a higher
[1:19:50] standard than that
[1:19:51] after these things are done away dark
[1:19:54] love
[1:19:55] will endure forever it's the love of God
[1:19:58] we'll be just standing preaching like
[1:20:01] this not playing taper not person player
[1:20:05] I want to identify what you're talking
[1:20:06] about here not touch close don't know we
[1:20:09] can't do this eh
[1:20:11] let me see it good not Church closing on
[1:20:14] this happening
[1:20:18] you get what I'm saying no
[1:20:21] good
[1:20:22] damn it right here
[1:20:24] we'll be standing preaching like this
[1:20:27] like this tonight
[1:20:29] or talking like this tonight and just
[1:20:32] the love will just settle over the
[1:20:34] building
[1:20:36] I didn't make that up
[1:20:39] the island dreamed that last night they
[1:20:41] still hear from God keeps his word
[1:20:43] oh give the Lord a prophecy hanging over
[1:20:46] your church Oh Glory to God I don't have
[1:20:48] to be standing anyone and ministers and
[1:20:50] anybody could be standing and love will
[1:20:53] just come down
[1:20:56] [Music]
[1:20:58] love God could use anybody anybody to
[1:21:04] stand and speak and love settle over the
[1:21:06] building
[1:21:07] Glory
[1:21:09] this is this bomb this is the day of
[1:21:11] preaching
[1:21:14] this is the day when we got to move in
[1:21:15] and get Sinners and pull them out
[1:21:17] that's what the preaching of the word is
[1:21:19] for it's for Sinners and bring them out
[1:21:22] and what he said when the last one comes
[1:21:24] in the door is shut oh praise God
[1:21:27] praise be to Jesus so therefore we must
[1:21:30] come truly into a real Spirit of
[1:21:33] forgiveness
[1:21:34] isn't that right and seventh under faith
[1:21:37] is based upon what
[1:21:38] forgiveness so brotherly kindness
[1:21:41] forgiveness opens the door
[1:21:44] to love
[1:21:47] you can't jump over that
[1:21:49] to get to the thing that can't feel
[1:21:52] you have to go through
[1:21:53] brotherly kindness and that opens the
[1:21:56] door
[1:21:57] of love to come
[1:21:59] upon you
[1:22:00] as the mantra
[1:22:02] no forgiveness means that you could put
[1:22:04] yourself
[1:22:05] in your brother's place on the matter so
[1:22:09] you could feel for him
[1:22:10] so that's all but Abraham operated when
[1:22:12] he was in India and he might come a
[1:22:13] blind the man of no shoes the first
[1:22:15] thing where I'm did was to take his
[1:22:16] shoes off to see if his foot could match
[1:22:17] the man to give the man his shoes
[1:22:21] he was feeling for the man
[1:22:23] he had that Spirit he asked him out of a
[1:22:26] Christian if he's a Believer and what
[1:22:27] nothing most like he might be a Hindu or
[1:22:28] whatever it is you get blind from
[1:22:30] looking at his son worshiping his son
[1:22:31] God gave back the money eyes and and I
[1:22:33] think but that's now he's talking about
[1:22:34] put yourself on the brother you don't
[1:22:36] worry about a Feeling
[1:22:38] and you don't know why he's so angry or
[1:22:40] so upset and why he treated you the way
[1:22:42] he's treating you
[1:22:43] and God sometimes allow things that way
[1:22:46] when he was making love in church God
[1:22:48] allowed that you know
[1:22:50] because God wants to know how he'll
[1:22:51] manage power
[1:22:53] is a powerful thing you know some of you
[1:22:56] want to know what people are having them
[1:22:57] give them power
[1:22:58] you will see what craziness inside is
[1:23:01] so God doesn't know if I have no crazies
[1:23:05] so you have to test you before power
[1:23:07] that's you with power to see what you
[1:23:10] will do
[1:23:11] even when he said your power to be
[1:23:13] buying the Mamba but be more sincere but
[1:23:15] Ram knew the mama couldn't affect him
[1:23:17] but he know the Bamba could kill the
[1:23:19] brother
[1:23:20] but God said be more sincere he didn't
[1:23:22] say if he'll be more sincerely get power
[1:23:23] I give you power but I want you to know
[1:23:25] the condition to really graduate with
[1:23:27] this power
[1:23:29] so the power have to grow with you
[1:23:31] Hallelujah Jesus ministry didn't start
[1:23:33] with Lazarus recently that you know it
[1:23:35] climaxed with that like when they could
[1:23:36] not live after Resurrection
[1:23:38] but he started with water to wine
[1:23:45] he started low and then go up high so
[1:23:48] when he hit Resurrection now they said
[1:23:50] No No all he will go after him let me
[1:23:52] kill him
[1:23:53] let me see you could sell him out and
[1:23:54] then they get Judas in the business they
[1:23:56] get a little silver thing now get some
[1:23:58] U.S and different things some euros
[1:24:00] get some punks
[1:24:02] today you know taking pongs euros and
[1:24:04] U.S
[1:24:06] who is Celio
[1:24:08] I kid you not still have them
[1:24:12] the God is still money
[1:24:15] Hallelujah let me tell you wrap up here
[1:24:17] now prophecy
[1:24:20] I believe the church is beginning here
[1:24:21] the message
[1:24:22] beginning to understand about friend so
[1:24:24] he was saying the channel to get into
[1:24:26] listen we have got to lay in the
[1:24:29] presence of the Sun
[1:24:31] not quote
[1:24:33] presence of the son
[1:24:35] we have got to be ripened
[1:24:37] what is he saying presence is what we're
[1:24:40] writing yeah watch this our faith isn't
[1:24:43] right intellectually we are hearing a
[1:24:45] message that God gave us seeing the
[1:24:47] signs that he showed us pruning by the
[1:24:48] Bible it is dear but holy church needs
[1:24:50] to lean on his presence till it tenders
[1:24:52] up and gets sweet in the spirit what
[1:24:54] he's talking about
[1:24:55] Spirit of forgiveness spiritually
[1:24:57] kindness till it gets sweet in the
[1:24:58] spirit so it can be done
[1:25:01] in my early days when I was sword
[1:25:02] fighting I know bathing down there you
[1:25:04] know
[1:25:05] it was blood it's a blood it was blood
[1:25:07] but
[1:25:08] they have a signature play with again
[1:25:11] I'm fighting them um
[1:25:13] computer games I forget what they call
[1:25:15] it
[1:25:16] this man fighting this one this one it
[1:25:18] was like that then like like the kind of
[1:25:20] combat some kind of comeback Mortal
[1:25:22] Kombat some kind of combat fight him
[1:25:24] just just clinging sword
[1:25:27] watch this you know
[1:25:28] but but seeing the signs here it's a so
[1:25:31] watch this the church need need
[1:25:34] to lay in his presence
[1:25:39] tell it 10 days up you know get sweet in
[1:25:41] the spirit so it can be done what is he
[1:25:43] saying that tendering is what's going to
[1:25:46] bring us any condition to being speaking
[1:25:47] things with God
[1:25:49] when that Thunder is not there is what
[1:25:51] is Grudge hit see somebody across the
[1:25:54] street yeah I want to shake the hand you
[1:25:55] have to tell nothing not even my
[1:25:57] greetings not even my season greetings
[1:25:58] big neighbor saying season greetings all
[1:26:00] believers say ingredients hello and
[1:26:01] Happy New Year and whatnot no happy new
[1:26:03] nothing
[1:26:07] you know so
[1:26:10] all of a sudden like I don't know if he
[1:26:11] wasn't human before
[1:26:14] we're humans said therefore you know I
[1:26:17] inquiring and you know I'm saying come
[1:26:20] on
[1:26:21] you know like remembering Ten
[1:26:22] Commandments the lady said those who are
[1:26:25] no strength or those who are no power
[1:26:26] Loveless
[1:26:28] Moses mother
[1:26:30] she wants you baby the woman claiming
[1:26:32] Moses to be baby she's mother too
[1:26:34] you fall on seeing them so people who
[1:26:37] love the pastor they love this other
[1:26:38] people love their Pastor too I mean
[1:26:40] they're crazy about it inside of here
[1:26:42] but I've been saying
[1:26:44] you know what I mean I'm saying that
[1:26:46] people have their own they support their
[1:26:48] own they love their own and whatnot
[1:26:49] Jesus disciples love their own thing too
[1:26:51] but Jesus tell them you have to exceed
[1:26:53] this kind of Pharisees you know because
[1:26:54] they love their own they treat each
[1:26:56] other nice and whatnot you have to love
[1:26:57] your enemies
[1:27:04] not that you have to love those who hate
[1:27:07] you bless them bless them bless them how
[1:27:10] could you get this experience if you
[1:27:12] don't have people doing hating doing the
[1:27:13] upsetting and mashing your corn it has
[1:27:16] to us these conditions are wrong that
[1:27:17] you could see what's going on in your
[1:27:19] spirit because you have to know how you
[1:27:21] come from swords man to sweet man
[1:27:24] oh you come from Salt to honey
[1:27:26] because the Honeys were gonna stick the
[1:27:29] Holy Spirit boil the trash out the
[1:27:30] church but the honey sticks it looked
[1:27:33] like it won't stick but it will stick
[1:27:35] sticky with love
[1:27:37] so the honey will stick
[1:27:39] charity
[1:27:42] and that's the only thing could take us
[1:27:44] out of here we cannot leave the Earth
[1:27:46] with brotherly kindness it will still
[1:27:47] fail but charity
[1:27:49] never fail at oh let's let's say no
[1:27:52] musician God please praise the lord we
[1:27:55] time has run on me and I'm now on page
[1:27:57] five you believe that
[1:27:59] my Jesus hear the prophecy now so till I
[1:28:02] get sweet in the spirit so you can be
[1:28:03] down sometimes you're speaking a message
[1:28:05] you get harsh after break it like that
[1:28:07] because you've got the Clinton name to
[1:28:08] make it whole but when the church once
[1:28:11] gets it the elected is called out and
[1:28:14] separated then in the presence of God
[1:28:16] where in the presence of God I know it
[1:28:19] will be something like that like the
[1:28:21] people was there when it takes the
[1:28:22] Rapture so before the Rapture comes they
[1:28:24] have to be the people get separated in
[1:28:27] presence oh Hallelujah my Lord no watch
[1:28:31] he said the Bible said called the
[1:28:32] illness that I'm Anointed with oil and
[1:28:34] pray watch he said well watch your your
[1:28:37] genuine faith will do it right there
[1:28:38] your genuine fit will make it so real to
[1:28:40] you look at that little woman with the
[1:28:42] blood issue if I can touch a part of His
[1:28:44] Garment I'd be made well and as soon as
[1:28:46] she did it she said she felt within
[1:28:48] herself that her blood issues stopped
[1:28:50] she actually believes it she said she
[1:28:52] wasn't hoping to be healed she knew
[1:28:54] without even getting a touch she knew
[1:28:56] something happened then but around said
[1:28:57] this now when she touched it to prove it
[1:29:00] stopped Jesus didn't say who touched me
[1:29:02] that perfect feet that same perfect
[1:29:04] Faith tonight will touch Jesus Christ
[1:29:07] just as it did them the woman come with
[1:29:10] a perfect for that time
[1:29:11] and we see at first the disciples didn't
[1:29:14] have this perfect fate they didn't have
[1:29:16] it because they had Christ walking with
[1:29:19] them but then afterwards Christ was in
[1:29:21] them so it's hard to have this perfect
[1:29:23] without the Holy Spirit
[1:29:25] it has to bring it
[1:29:27] so the Holy Spirit himself is what
[1:29:29] brings that perfect fate Oh Glory to God
[1:29:32] hallelujah oh glory to God I'm gonna
[1:29:34] wrap it up here it is he said they had
[1:29:36] power they had been given power to heal
[1:29:39] the sick to raise the Dead the castle
[1:29:40] that was refuted before that they had
[1:29:42] the power but not the Fate use the power
[1:29:44] there's the problem Tabernacle
[1:29:46] day of the church the bright today the
[1:29:49] holy spirit is here with the power but
[1:29:51] you haven't got faith to move it see
[1:29:53] what I mean it takes Faith to move it so
[1:29:56] the Seven Seas is the power but he puts
[1:29:58] seven Thunders
[1:29:59] on the back of the book
[1:30:01] to bring Faith to move the power
[1:30:04] when they reject the time there's a
[1:30:05] reject the Fate they can't connect with
[1:30:06] the power but Faith seventh on the faith
[1:30:09] which is based upon forgiveness going to
[1:30:10] connect with the power and you're going
[1:30:12] to see the power begin to work oh praise
[1:30:13] I do believe that
[1:30:15] he said no he said it takes Faith to
[1:30:17] charge it and throw it out there see
[1:30:19] what it takes perfect at night the power
[1:30:21] of the Holy Spirit perfect fate to
[1:30:23] ignite the power of the Holy Spirit
[1:30:25] which we have now since he come upon you
[1:30:28] Faith to ignite to see great things
[1:30:30] hallelujah praise God glory to God
[1:30:34] so knowing exactly oh my God I'm gonna
[1:30:37] skip that praise the name of the Lord
[1:30:39] hallelujah praise God so it takes Faith
[1:30:42] to operate these promises isn't that
[1:30:43] right
[1:30:44] brother Brown says
[1:30:47] at least I can kind of got speed up here
[1:30:49] now how would we see him
[1:30:51] Christ
[1:30:53] how would we see him question we have to
[1:30:57] see his spirit
[1:30:59] if he's in us that Spirit would have to
[1:31:02] do the same thing he did then or it
[1:31:04] wouldn't be the same spirit
[1:31:06] and he gave a script to fit I am Divine
[1:31:08] you are the branches if the branch is in
[1:31:10] Divine the branch will be the kind of
[1:31:12] fruit Divine produces and where the
