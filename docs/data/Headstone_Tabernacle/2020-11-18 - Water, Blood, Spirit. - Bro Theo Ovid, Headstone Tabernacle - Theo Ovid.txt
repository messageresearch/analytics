ask it amen and amen god bless you underneath of your bibles i'd like you to turn to second peter chapter three i want to read from verse one to eighteen and also from first john chapter five we wanna read verse one to eat for scripture reading tonight god bless you and welcome certainly i appreciate you coming out tonight praise the name of the lord it's good to be here so from 2nd peter chapter 3 verse 1. this second epistle beloved i now write unto you and both which i stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance that you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandments of us the apostles of the lord and savior knowing this first that they shall come in the last days scuffers walking after their own lust and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of god the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserve unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the lord as a thousand years some thousand years is one day the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men can't slackness but is long-suffering to us what not willing that then he should perish but that all should come to repentance but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the element shall melt with filth and heat the earth also on the works that are therein shall be built up seeing them that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought to be in all holy conversation and godliness and that holy conversation is not talk it's holy living holy behavior and godliness looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of god wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heaven and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness wherefore beloved seeing that he look for such things be diligent that he may be found in him in peace without spot and blameless an account that the long-suffering of our lord is salvation even as our beloved brother paul also according to the wisdom given unto him had written unto you and also in all his epistles speaking in them of these things and which are some things had to be understood which day that are unlearned and unstable rest as they do also the other scriptures unto their own destruction ye therefore beloved seen you know these things before beware least he also been led away with the error of the wicked fall from your own steadfastness but grow in grace and the knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ to him be glory but now and forever amen and from first john 5 whosoever believe it that jesus the christ is born of god and everyone that loved him that begot loved him also that is begotten of him and by this we know that we love the children of god when we love god and keep his commandments and this is the love of god that we keep his commandments and his commandments and not grievous for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is a victory that overcometh the world even our fate who is he that overcome in the world but he that believeth that jesus is the son of god this is he that came by water and blood even jesus christ not by water only but by water and blood and it is the spirit that they are at witness because the spirit is truth for they are treated be recorded in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost these trees are one and there are three that bear witness in it the spirit the water and the blood and these three agree and one may god had a blessing to his word you may be seated oh praise the lord of a title tonight just three words water blood spirit that's the title tonight just three words water blood spirit and the prophet here in birth pains he said the church had boot pains under looter and we know there are seven churches and seven messengers to them church ages according to revelation and when luther come forth it certainly threw the church into breed pains and after that it got in trouble again and brought forth wesley and after that he bought for pentecost each of their messenger rock the age back to the word the message of the age the message according to the bible he says now watch and the four chapters of revelation read it he said it proves being a shadow of a doubt that looter's message was justification what signification is the next process is the natural birth and then come the pentecostal notice each age rock the church and give it blue pains but what did they do after the blood pains come instead of going on with the word they got a bunch of men together just like the one the first one did it's exactly right after the rocking of the apostles then we finally going off again each age has rocked every time a messenger come forth with thus saith the lord it rocked the church age isn't that right now we know worse age now laodicea rich and blinded and so on now her messenger is promised in malachi the fourth chapter he promised to do it and the message is to bring back the word bring the people back to the word a bird is to be she is to be delivered of a new birth according to malachi 4. according to what according to malachi 4 this bride church is supposed to be delivered of a new birth not the pentecost according to malachi 4. hallelujah oh glory to god water seven seals that break hallelujah the blood seven thunders hallelujah that's the blood from the water of the word isn't that right there's a revelation that bring you in speaking condition with god the blood is what hangs over you that you could communicate to god outside the blood you can't talk outside of blood you can't access the throne oh glory to god the blood make it possible so you have to communication with god because when he looks at look at you he sees you through the blood oh glory to god you're ready yet yeah right as you ought to be yet but the blood is speaking on your behalf oh glory to god water blood but there's another step is spirit all glory to god just as water come hallelujah the blood have to come and i just the blood come the spirit have to come oh give the lord some praises tonight hallelujah praise be to jesus hallelujah so god see through the blood to your sanctified life that you're called into this thing isn't that right and then the next level now praise god hallelujah oh glory to god brotherly kindness hallelujah praise god and holy decency then place in christ isn't that something oh blessed be the name of the lord brotherly kindness the blood for the age oh displayed upon the bride's chest we have to be able to manifest but kindness that's in the spirit realm now broadly kindness blood given the fear to access holy spirit virtue powerful service isn't that right and then the next step what is charity adoption dynamics placing oh hallelujah what is it blood hallelujah water blood spirit oh blessed be the name of the lord then he said here now when that light struck little rebecca she knew something within her that brought her to isaac she wanted no more to do with her own thinking isaac was a thinking from then on and the church itself when it strikes prophecy the power of god the baptism of the holy ghost out of denominational churches out of the catholic church wherever it is when that baptism of the holy ghost is made real to the people them that are predestinated like you people here to eat in like season walk in it what is it super sign so it's a prophecy he's not talking about pentecostal baptists speaking in tongues he's not talking about this holy ghost and charismatics he's not talking about that kind of stuff he's talking about outside of that when the power of god strike oh glory to god hallelujah praise god we believe it people are going to see it who's going to see it the predestinated everybody can see it everybody cool and in essence they don't want to see it oh glory to god hallelujah now notice recognize the call of god's word which he's part of eager to eager call if that mother would have screamed like a buzzard he would have known isn't that right but it was the scream of the eagle talking about the eagle in the barnyard heard the mother scream and responded to it isn't that right and the same thing is with every believer when the preaching of god's word come forth and is vindicated and proved that it is god's word for this hour then there is something within the believer i don't care how loyal his father was to the church how loyal his mother was or his grandparents if that church is teaching contrary to this hour of the baptism of the holy ghost message there is something in him that screams out he would leave the banyan he's got to do it oh glory to god you hear what the prophet said if that church is teaching the contrary to this hour of the baptism of the holy ghost message there is something in him that screams he will leave the barnyard he's got to do it the chicken might have been all right one day but this is the eagle hour it is different there is something that he must leave the old coop and fly away into the blue then this earthly body is quickened and brought by the quickening spirit to the obedience of god's word oh my now when this holy spirit represented as the eagle flying over the land and finds the believer no man could come except the father who told me is that right it's the father drawing now the holy spirit is here on earth looking out for those individuals that god has ordained a life in this age now i say it's guaranteed nobody could stop it he's hunting you he's found you oh glory to god and you're gonna be filled and you're gonna be sealed and you'll be delivered and you will be set free and the god has stopped the working you're finished with you yet the devil devils are lying tonight don't let the devil tie up he start the work he go finish it the devil didn't stack the work on you it's god that stacked the work in you and he who start to work in you is able to complete it he's the one that has justified the ungodly he's the one that justify or go without any works by your faith in his blood by your faith in his name by your faith in his word you can be justified tonight oh glory to god abraham was justified and he received a sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness that his faith was accepted or give the lord some glory hallelujah or god sent a message to anoint the faith in your soul that you can rise up from your unbelief rise up from the depression rise up from your nonsense and your foolishness and enter into a land of perfect fate where all things are possible oh do you believe that amen let's go i know the holy spirit is on earth looking out for those individuals that god has ordained to life in this age and as soon as it finds it it does just like it did on jesus the great super son of god who redeem us all it comes down and takes its abode into the human life now notice brought the quickening power now that quickening power that come upon jesus here we go quicken him to manifest every promise of the word for that day so the quickening power not come and shake your shoulder no no the christian power comes from a little more than that it come to quicken him to manifest the promise for that day so does the holy spirit that come upon us in this day it's not a mockery holy spirit it's not the devil mocking the holy spirit it is the real true holy spirit it will manifest the promise of this hour when it fell upon luther it manifests that promise of that hour when it fell upon wesley it manifests the promise of that hour when they fall upon that day it manifests the promise of the world moses it manifests the promise of the allah it fell upon noah it manifests the promise of the hour when it fell upon jesus it manifests the problems of that our see it's the holy spirit coming down to quicken and make alive those that are ordained of god to be in the rapture there is going to be a rapture i look at what church members i don't care what the devil put in front there's going to be a rapture and it'll take the holy spirit to come and quicken those oh glory to god hallelujah that's why the elected are the first ones to be quickened oh give the lord a shout oh glory to god before janice and james come forward moses have to step out with the power of god then then impersonators will follow after the original is coming forward first then the counterfeit o hallelujah praise god oh glory to god hallelujah forgive me tonight hallelujah praise god everybody build house anybody have building but he saw me come yet oh glory to god he stormed this test what the building belonged and jesus gave the story the uncommon storm coming oh god it's a bill right they go rock it go shake it go fall down oh glory to god but we have received a kingdom tonight that cannot be moved oh glory to god because we are standing on this rock revelation of the jesus christ hallelujah not in some man not in some system but on the word of god oh hallelujah so there is the holy spirit that coming down to quicken and make a life those people that's for ordained of god to be in the rapture notice if he is a true eagle he will understand the message of the hour if he's a true eagle oh glory to god if you're a true eager must understand he misses here oh hallelujah thank you lord there are three debate record in heaven the element that come from jesus body when he died there was water there was blood and spirit and these three things make up the new bird oh god somebody say amen tonight what came from jesus water blood and spirit and these things three things make up the new birth is that right ministers these three elements make up the new birth water blood and spirit that make up the natural birth when a baby is born the first thing happen is water blood life all the natural things type the spiritual now in first john 5 7 i believe there are tree that bear record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost these three are one and there are three that they're recording earth that's water blood spirit and they agree in one now notice the first three are one the second three are earthly which are green one you cannot have the father without the sun you cannot have the sun without having the holy ghost but you can have the water without the blood and you can have the blood without the spirit i might say that again you could have the water without the blood you could have the blood without the spirit you can be sanctified without being justified and you can be justified without being sanctified you can be sanctified without receiving the holy ghost that's exactly i'm still reading not my thoughts the disciples in john 17 17 were sanctified given power to cast out devils and still didn't have the holy ghost and they had anointed ministry alongside jesus you can't say they don't know jesus they had they had the i mean they was in his inner circle with all the holy ghost there was preaching with all the holy ghost there was gaston out there without the holy ghost that shaken isn't it mighty ministry without the holy ghost sure they had to go to pentecost and wait till the holy ghost come that's where judah showed his color see how that spirit worked its way through justification sanification but when it come to the end he showed his colors when he come to the third step or the third phase or this third link oh glory to god hallelujah he showed his colors so you can't stop short it's three things it's water not water only it's blood is that blood only it's spirit also oh glory to god do you love him tonight look when a woman is in travail forbid the first thing comes to pass the breaking of water normal bit second thing is the blood and then comes life water blood spirit that constitutes the normal natural birth so it is in the spiritual realm it is water justification by faith believing on god believe him as your personal savior being baptized second is sanctification of the spirit that god cleanses the spirit from all the elements of the world and the desire of the world and then the holy spirit comes in and gives new birth and fills up that sanctifying vessel and when you speak about the glass layer in the chicken yard you don't pick it up and just put it on your table and fill it with water or milk no by picking it up its justification cleanses its simplification because the greek work signifies a compound word means cleanse and set aside not in service but for service but when you fill it it puts us in service so all this labouring and and travailing and and pressing is to get you into the position to be in service now real service for this age and for this hour is charity that is to put you in service we can't go back to 1906 which is a pentecostal birth spirit we have to go back to we had to come back to the spirit of adoption so it's really charity to empower the bride because the pentecostal did not have the person even though they had the spirit because the person came in by the word and the word came to the prophet and they reject the prophet that they couldn't get the person of christ to add faith and virtue and knowledge and temperance and patience and godliness because that comes by the word oh glory to god give the lord a shout if the pentecostal could have received the word then they were the rapture would have gone already because they was going to add those life and then connect with the capstone but they rejected it and destroyed them as shock so god had to bring a seed and there's a bird coming for that seed oh glory to god hallelujah all glory to god that bright church has to be delivered of a new birth so birds have to come for that seed because their seed is the church of grace the seed is truly perfection oh give the lord i shout the capstone word that's the seed that's in the bride i see to make you perfect because we have to come to perfection to bring on the resurrection this seed is not a church seed record there is no rage oh give the lord a shout this is the bright age glory hallelujah my god my god watch the perimeter that shapes up the church justification certification baptism holy spirit then here we go that's got to be honed some sometime ago he was talking about he said that holy ghost bunch being honed so without getting to the holy ghost he can't be home he's not holding sanctification he's at home in justification he's holding the that's spirit and that's deep and that's not skim milk because that there'll be no impersonation to that this step there is no imperfection to that oh glory to god hallelujah watch and the headstone never did come to the pyramid it was rejected just like the cornerstone now when the headstone come i've been to the pyramid so perfectly fit when christ comes to receive his church the church will have the ministry just exactly like that and true grace will raise the whole thing the coming of the headstone what he's saying christ not coming on dry like i said the holy ghost will come and dries at that dead people day no holy commander that there was praise and worshipping god in your room there was creating an atmosphere so christ himself not coming to no dead church it has to have his ministry his spirit to blend that's another word the prophet used i'm going to dig up in all those words honed blend those are key words those are very important words there is nothing so they know all your followers is a mystery yeah we could talk about daniel 70 weeks and the vials and the woes and he plays but blending hone in oh glory to god character formation character building giving all diligence how to run this race paul said we don't run like beaten in the air you'll run to obtain you don't want to enter well like in the race that's not touching what you're going through what you're going for because you have to answer the question why because why is what preserves you in your trial and testing oh glory when you're struggling you know why god called you you know why you have to keep pressing on you know why you have to keep pushing forward but if you don't know why you would let go you would give up you think the pastor doesn't be tired too and where are you but i know why i'm here i know why i'm here tonight i know what i'm expecting and why i'm expecting it i'm supposed to be expecting it so i'm pushed i have to push oh glory to god if you don't know why you'll give up you aim at and you'll get relaxed and you forget what you was aiming at you forget the purpose you forgot what raised you up for afterwards samson's had to play games play with delilah play with that and play with this the anointing still remember you're playing games but you still have the locks you still have the covenant hallelujah hearted the woman and his strength to god and god still working with that but when he break and he crossed a line and they reveal a secret and the siege was cut off from him he all of a sudden he thought that anointing was going to be with him i want to shake himself the anointing just was not there and sampson found himself ordinary he didn't realize without god he's ordinary with all the blood the ordinary oh glory to god with all the anointed ordinary oh glory to god the other one paid the penalty and go in prison eyes dug out and but he knew he was a son so he had access because of the faith that was in him but the luck still had to grow back so with no ball head he could crash and lose once more lord he had to wait until it has been restored from the very roots itself you have to go back back to the roots to get back that locks to be restored and when it's restored here in position now i've done all this thing at your word elijah built back the altar and he did hear him dig here he said pour some more water pour some more water pour some water then fellas carry on karen looking for vindication and not a sign come not income he said lord i did all of this according to your word and when you see the word is laid on word on top word here little dear little oh glory to god and you know we have done it according to the word we know fire is about to break out we know the power is about to strike oh god has justified us by his blood by his word isn't that right allah sanctify us by his blood and all the spirit the dynamics the token is about to be made manifest oh glory to god you know what this token is oh hallelujah praise god with this token you could ask whatever you will shall be given unto you oh glory the devil cast up this he can't fight this token not even death could interfere with this token when i see the blood i'm gonna pass over you in egypt was the blood but this is the spirit oh glory to god hallelujah it was typed all over because in the blood have the life [Applause] my lord he said what when he talked about the lutheran church there's some second name of the lord lost the light the baptist just lost her light the woman lost her coin she had a hustling time she scrubbed the floor she swept the walls she's turning on the cobwebs but george what if the woman told you how do you going i think it's somebody you know husband coming into somebody wait hey somebody not this woman she wasn't gambling she wasn't rolling the dice when he come by faith i was sick she was known by faith nothing you know she didn't want to get put away you know that was the law you know she missing that coin she get put away get through and whatnot hallelujah praise god she began to scrub the floors begin to clean you know what the bible said the neighbors could see the dust flying out like when you're serious you know when you're playing proud i don't want to see dustin on you coming on the carpet on your walk easy sneaking up in the garbage bag do you care it's your house you finding you're kicking off your trainer because is this coin hallelujah and then all this oughts and grudge and meanness and bad behavior and ministers carrying a bunch of foolishness putting all kind of evil seeds in their people and kind of hating the people that can't receive another minister they call you another all they bind to the pastor binding them with fear and all kind of thing like that you think god please do that [Music] do you think god pleased with them kind of things when there's a smack brotherly kindness spirit of forgiveness and you have to put yourself on your brothers but in your brother's place in your brother's shoes only matter and faith is based upon forgiveness we're wrapped you in faith you could get with with oats and grudge you can't put a long charity a couple of your spirit you can get until it's step you can get the limited face nothing only talk and more talk and more talk nice talk to the tribulation because it will take power to go in the rapture it works even even even the prophet was tested at what he gonna do people making love in church he said stop it please stop it stop it the carrying on then god drop down mind of god drop down whatever you do you're in charge you're a son sign off on them hallelujah in case you don't know you can stay blind in case you don't know you can say debt in case you don't know give them options and they'll overstand the bombs i forgive you what made them do that that is not a a text that is a manifestation what make him say i forgive you and then the holy spirit fell because god was pleased because his son acting like him or give the lord a shout out he he he didn't bother with none of the options number one people came together in church not now the police will throw them out before they even detest come to even say i forgive you see what i'm talking about now it's just legalistic it's just political it's just natural it's just revelation and people move in a certain way where is the test because all these virtues have to be proven tested scripturally proven to use the prophet's word that these things are in us that god can see not the pastor not the deacon not the elder that god can see faith and vote you and knowledge that's different because if god could see that it means that that living out by by expressing my works and because god seeing faith but mangosteer works so god's seeing these virtues but man will see the life of these virtues thundering out in sweetness and meekness and humility on the fire walking around the world today oh my you love him tonight so he said no watch she had australian time she scrubbed the floors she swept the wall she took it on the cobweb she kept on until she found what she had lost and when she did she called her little sister churches to come now i don't care if you're a methodist baptist pentecostal presbyterian what are you saying i don't care what you believe i don't care what church should be learned i don't care what group you belong to he said and come and rejoice together when that time come prophecy when the church finds his brotherly love when the church finally holds in c2 when the church finds his place in christ tree it will call to the other members of the body come and rejoice with us god wants the church to love him water blood spirit ezekiel 36 26 27 new heart will i give you a new spirit will i put within you and i will take away the stunning heart out of your flesh and i will give you a heart of flesh and i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments unto them so god promised a new heart a new spirit a sanctified spirit and then his spirit because with your new spirit without a new spirit you cannot agree with anybody how many kind of agrees your neighbor your husband just miserable so he gave you a sanctified spirit that could work along with the holy spirit oh hallelujah praise god because the holy spirit wants to come but he can't handle a filthy spirit he has to handle a sanctified spirit isn't that right and what happened in the old testament there were three courts the outer court people lived by the moon and the sun and the dark and whatnot the inner court has seven golden candlesticks isn't that right but sometimes the lamb gets smoky isn't that right but there's a place beyond that where the glory never failed it was called the innervale oh glory there were there was three stages there was three parts of the court the outer core the inner court and the most holy place the object is to get into the most holy place because that is where that dead red blossom embodied that is where dead things will come to life that is where you could come to life and stay alive in the presence of shekinah glory oh give the lord a shout glory to god hallelujah there are believers hanging on the outer court they content to live there they contend to stay there they are those who push into going to the inner court but there is something beyond that and beyond that veil there is something for you to press onto oh glory to god water blood spirit water is like ultra court blood is like the seven chest ages seven candlesticks and spirit is the inner veil i'll give the lord some praises tonight hallelujah hallelujah glory to god hallelujah praise god and the prophet said there's one thing to break through to go to that other step he said his self will you have to will to do the will of god you have to want it you can't sit down and get rocking like you're entitled go ahead and entitle people you fight for every inch the kingdom is preached and every man pressed away into it you have to want this third step you have to be intentional about it what paul said he said i fight not as beaten in the air i bring my body in subjection that i myself would not be a cast away after preaching the gospel so he now take it for granted well you know i'm a poor in the apostle i can do i want go where i want act like all i want so what i want no he said anybody that present like olympics have to be trained have to come under discipline in order to what in order to hit the mark is half first place second place and take place and have also run nobody also runs have no price again you know they also run have no medal to get you know it have gold silver and brands the rapture is for goal hope nobody asked me where i get out from i hope nobody asked me that's why rome going and rule the world right now they cancel a woman who was supposed to but donald trump wanted to be the head of the federal reserve a woman they said she had not case and all them even the republicans and the vote not that woman you know what you want to do she want to go back to the gold standard but guess what but iran prophesied that they will go back to the gold standard they find she's a nut case when i see that i say wow it is closer and nearer than we think so there's a method to the madness the queen of america oh hallelujah praise god is is much more than media oh hallelujah praise the name of the lord could we continue a little bit hallelujah so but i'm talking about uh water baptism there's some future home they repent and they get baptized and repentance and so on like that and then said you can't repent for what adam done i don't done done it he said but you just get forgiven so what you done the old nature is still there you get baptized right then you put a board you see here's a human heart and here is a human heart now indeed have a snake in it that is sin here he has his life and this one have a dove which is the holy spirit it's two different hearts here here he has life and this one have malice hatred envy and that's what causing it is this fellow here this one have love joy long suffering this is what does it do here now when you ask you are forgiven of your sins you have done this and take it away but the thing that made you do it is still there that is the old root of evil it is still there notice when you repent and are baptized in the name of jesus that he forgive you of your sins then secondly comes sanctification which sets our mind in order for holiness to think right and then sanification is the compound greek word mean clean and set aside for service next come the baptism of fire and the holy ghost that god might dwell in us and the fire of god cleanses our hearts from sin and puts the holy ghost inside not the pastor not teaching the fire of god not mysteries not the hidden ones and hidden hidden ones the fire let any minister challenge me on that the fire hallelujah let me read it again this song is good next come the baptism of fire and holy ghost that god might dwell in us and the fire of god cleanses our hearts from sin and puts the holy ghost inside then we bring forth the same life that this this did that this because he is in us notice in a natural birth when a woman gives bitter baby natural light spiritual life when wrong is bitter baby the natural things is breaking of water then blood then the spirit the life gravel fellow spank him away he goes screaming water blood spirit now when a baby is born into the kingdom of god he comes the same way water blood spirit not notice sanctification and the second stage of it cleanses the mind and sets the heart the mind of the heart in order of holiness now when he gets sanctified that cleanses that desire out of him see it takes the want of it away he can still be tempted to the temptation of the issue but it takes the want of it away still he's not right yet then he is baptized with the holy ghost on fire cleansed abraham was burnt out clean up and then put into the service of god sanctification only sets them aside for service notice exactly the messengers come martin luther justification was recently the pentecostal the bible egos the messages and there can't be no more ages of it we are the end time three stages baptism cleanses the heart with the holy ghost now how striking he takes the place where he we are to dwell in through the same process now he is called the church through justification call it true certification then fill it with the holy ghost and fire and he took it through a process here we go that he himself the holy spirit himself the son of god could dwell in the human heart no it has to go through that before he can come into it so there is no way to eliminate that process and i hear the word and an equipment dominion then i recognize that my son you see them fancy talk all of a sudden i get a realization and i believe the message and i had the holy ghost because i believe the message all that is talk [Music] that is not what is being taught that is not what the prophet brought hallelujah notice in the undiluvian world okay right after it repented through the bride of that day noah he gave it a water baptism so the further or deeper revelation of the flood wasn't just a flood it was god redeeming the earth so noah's earth or the earth was baptized with the flood in noah's time water hallelujah then christ came and shed his blood upon it and cleanse it claiming it blood and the scripture we read it waiting for fire and now satan hears the scripture try to make him break god's plan to receive it to give it to him when he took him up the mountain and tried to give it to him with all the purchase of the blood so that's what satan offer was let's interrupt this thing we had water but you see this blood thing don't go there all this kingdom i will give you you don't have to shed one blood just die dire village but jesus knew that the price is a blood currency it's a blood price that only he alone could pay he can't send an angel he can't send some other man he alone could play it god became man to pay the blood price oh glory to god so they beat him they tortured him and everything as they whipped him but he paid the price oh glory to god water wasn't enough we needed the blood because the blood released the life and once that spirit is released the devil in trouble because it means adam fallen race is getting back sons of god are coming back and we are coming back because the blood made our way back and the spirit follows the blood all the way from the book of redemption so when the lamb took the book and opened the book and lose the seven seas the spirit was following the blood words so tonight we are preaching blood tonight there's a blood message it is a blood message oh glory to god that's why the anointing is here the spirit follows the blood all the way from the book of redemption i'll die without it oh i'm connected with it you are the words of the book we can leave the book oh give the lord some praises oh hallelujah hallelujah praise god glory to god amen christ came and called the church to repentance and baptism in the name of jesus christ permission and sanctify the church and then the fire come down and burn out the filth and comes and dwells in the human heart now the world to be redeemed for this redeemed person he used the same method so the world the earth and the persons have to live in it is redeemed the same way oh hallelujah that's why it had to be renovated for the bride to come back to step foot on it isn't that right okay let's continue here now no it has to go through the baptism of fire holy fire from god which cleanses the earth and heavens around it then it's purchased so that the red team can live on it live in peace notice the baptism of fire it's a cleanse from sin from sickness from diseases from germs from sinners from the devil and all his group he is to be cast on the lake of fire holy far from god comes up from god out of heaven and burns it up notice is to make ready for god to dwell in for god in a new world that is to come it's dwelling in the earth because you say god he dwells in the human heart but he and the bride becomes one and they go to their home in the new world and the same plan of redemption is used to be redeemed both the world and the persons that live in it see here we go the heart has to be cleansed like that before god can come down in the person of the holy ghost these words are important the emphasis are important all the other words are we have to be made for god to step into you oh give the lord some praises oh glory to god hallelujah i see so much of people lying lying the lying prophets they prophesy lies and every person you know jesus continued more god they talked to them god never spoke to them i think it sometimes we read about jeremiah jeremiah 23 i believe it was god said these are prophets that i never spoke to and they speaking in my name calling just saying lord he said he's speaking by the deceit of their own heart i have not spoken to them i didn't send them he said don't listen to them i did not send them prophet don't try to mix and twist and and try to fit it to fit the prophecy no is that a man here from god in here from god and what do you say to the bride the last days she will have dust here the lord what what do you say anybody in last days she'll be the final voice to the final aid what do you say about the bride in the last days the world will hear direct from god girl only speaking to the bride think about it he spoke in the prophet you speaking on the bride present tense once more the world go here direct from god oh my now this baptism of fire cleanses from all the germs all the diseases all sickness even all the spiritual things which is by us two it does the same way to make it ready for god to dwell in in this great age to come okay i hope i didn't skip okay right so the heart has to be cleansed like that before god can come down in the person of the holy holy ghost which is christ coming down dwell in the human heart it first must be repented it must first be baptized in water it might be cleansed by the blood of jesus christ and then the holy fire holy ghost come from god comes down and burns out all the desire all the nature of the world oh my hallelujah praise god so you talk about the pharisees and scribes and so on outside they're looking white they're looking clean they're looking nice but the predestination back there is sinful isn't that right and black behind here and this woman are the well prostitute now her life looking sinful looking all negative and all the talk behind it but behind that her predestination was unto god elected and predestinated isn't that right in god's mind when jesus came and manifested the word watch he said this little woman had nothing to present she was as filthy as dirty as she could be but notice way down in her she got representation oh glory to god that's why she could get justification because she had representation that's how you get tonight that's why she could get justification because she had representation her life was filthy but she had representation back there so he devil could talk he could cry he could laugh he could say whatever you want she was going to come true oh glory to god and i don't care what you have been going through what negative or wrong your life you're going to come through if your name is in the book it has to come true oh glory to god we believe that hallelujah so he came to redeem that which was fallen and in the fall this got messed up with that girl but god had her in a stinking before the foundation of the world or when the priest what did it do to him it sent him back to his destination he had nothing only intellectual learning now listen friends if the only thing you got is intellectual learning you got something you've got to get something different from that you'll never be able to get it unless you got representation and the reason i believe you come from the east and west north and south the word living manifest isn't that right so watch something you become a new person not an old one patched up by joining church and trying to turn a new page but you are a complete brand new unit god takes the old man and burns him all completely out with the holy ghost on fire and comes himself and he sends down your representation oh glory to god by fire oh glory to god you're just not saying your name in any book you know you you have the you have your name manifested by the holy ghost upon your life oh give the lord some praises amen when you say when his blood was shed at calvary he dropped back upon the earth what for to redeem the earth no it's been justified it's been sanctified it's called and claimed her like that now to be received baptism of fire justification is called hallelujah the blood is claimed hallelujah the next step baptism of fire to be cleansed for jesus and his bride oh glory to god hallelujah are you do we love him tonight the earth you are part of the earth okay your body your soul is part of god attribute of god displayed here on earth the body is to be redeemed now the soul is redeemed because it was in sin so god come now by a process of justification sanctification baptism redeem your soul and you being a part of the earth it is redeemed by it you are in the process now it is growing on your body was justified on the north baptism your flesh when it dropped here and the earth is to be cleansed by fire oh glory to god we are already justified we are already glorified oh glory to god we are going to process who ethan we call come on hell who he call he justified who he justified he act already glorified oh my praise god you shall come and please oh hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord thank you lord jesus hallelujah praise god the place where you live with the baptism of the holy ghost a dwelling place for christ and his bride the new jerusalem watch this city this will take up his abortion you cannot he said okay i'll just keep by my lord now we have left the pentecostal age this sunday sign of this time now we are coming to where the pyramid not pyramid doctrine now but i mean like the pyramid the headstone when it comes to fit it's got to be honed saying it would again honed there's got to be a ministry in the church the true church of the living god to where when the heads don't come when the heads don't come we're not talking about teaching ministry and this ministry and and no when the headstone comes christ or the ministry of christ and and christ will fit right and perfectly together so in other words in the church have to have christ's own ministry his spirit the other half of the chinese thicket then he is one part and the bride will have the next part operated in the church that's why he said there will be a church where jesus christ walking in it the shout of the king will be in the camp oh glory not the silence of the king the shout of the king will be in the camp that means healing signs wonders miracles the glory of god it will be no private show oh glory to god be a witness to the world let me say it again it will be a witness to the world i say that again it will be a witness to the world that attack with me no private show oh glory to god go go say this is my bread look here this is my woman this is my lady i am proud of her i'll please with her i'm going to manifest myself protect her overshadow her and take her away oh thank you lord hallelujah christ or the mention of christ and christ will fit right into it then that brings back the redeemed to take the whole house to glory again we're the methodist baptist presbyterian through the great reformation ages praise god that come out and give their lives and persecution and things for the kingdom of god that stone is coming yes sir it certainly will come notice when a baby is born this is the final quote there are three things that constitute this birth the first thing normal birth your dog's listening close a bird is water then blood and life now the same thing that constitutes the new birth water blood spirit the elements that came from his body is what makes his body see my lord it comes from his body it is the material that takes to make his bride aha so these are the elements that was taken to actually make the bride water blood and spirit and his bride was taken from his body christ has his bride taken from his body and when christ died there was three elements that came from his body water blood and spirit justification to believe in he said water sanification through the blood and then the baptism of the holy spirit i close with these words here now now are you ready this last great step what is he talking about the spirit part this last great step must come into perfection so he's talking about the spirit part coming to perfection that the holy spirit has to live in that church so perfectly it will make the head and the body unite together that's the body and he's ahead we find out he promised in the last days that it would be done [Music] unfinished this last step that's why the pentecostal had the spirit but they couldn't come into this last step because you need the word to come into this last step this perfection is seven perfect spirits and that was only released by the message of malachi 4. the pentecostal didn't have that they had spirit built but the word produced faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness what is that a perfect church for the capstone to come to cap off christ spirit coming into the church to manifest these seven virtues seven living voices living in you and i let's all stand tonight and worship him begin to sing that song for me [Music] me here's my heart lord let it be
