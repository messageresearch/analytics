[51:57] Lord bless the reading of the word and
[51:59] bless the hearing of it in the mighty
[52:01] name of Jesus Christ and the church says
[52:04] amen thank you so much musicians
[52:07] just have one portion of scripture if
[52:09] you have your Bibles this morning
[52:11] would you turn with me to Genesis
[52:13] chapter 22 a very familiar scripture for
[52:16] a context this morning
[52:19] Hallelujah Genesis 22 and verse 10.
[52:25] Genesis 22 and verse 10 and Abraham's
[52:27] trip forth his hand and took the knife
[52:30] to slay his son
[52:32] and the angel of the Lord called unto
[52:34] him out of heaven and said Abraham
[52:36] Abraham
[52:37] and he said here my
[52:39] he said lay not thine hand upon the lad
[52:42] neither do thou or anything unto him for
[52:45] now I know that thou fear is God seeing
[52:49] thou has not withheld thy son thine only
[52:51] son from me
[52:53] and Abraham lifted up his eyes and
[52:55] looked and behold behind him a ram
[52:57] course caught in a Thicket by his horns
[53:00] and Abraham went and took the ramen
[53:02] offered him up
[53:04] for a burnt offering in the state of his
[53:07] son
[53:08] and Abraham called the name of that
[53:10] place Jehovah Jireh as it is said to
[53:12] this day in the Mount of the Lord it
[53:14] shall be seen and the angel of the Lord
[53:16] called unto Abraham Out of Heaven the
[53:19] second time and said by myself have I
[53:22] sworn say it Lord for because thou has
[53:25] done this thing and has not withheld thy
[53:28] son thine only son that in blessing I
[53:31] Will Bless thee and in multiplying I
[53:34] will multiply thy seed as the stars of
[53:38] the heaven and as a sandwich is upon the
[53:40] seashore and thy seed shall possess the
[53:43] gates of his enemy
[53:45] and in thy Siege shall all the nations
[53:47] will be blessed because thou Hast obeyed
[53:50] my voice may the lord of the blessing to
[53:53] the reading of his word you may be
[53:54] seated in the presence of the Lord this
[53:56] morning
[53:58] agreed to church in the precious name of
[54:01] Jesus is certainly good to be back home
[54:03] with you in Fellowship as we know but
[54:06] over the night we were out to Mexico
[54:07] last weekend and we had a tremendous
[54:09] time in the Lord with the Believers
[54:12] there in Mexico so we thank God for our
[54:14] Victory uh God is moving around his
[54:16] world he's moving around the church he's
[54:18] moving to the bride
[54:20] amen and we had a quite a time to see
[54:23] every service unfold and unfold and to
[54:26] see God ministering to his people so we
[54:28] salute the Believers over there in
[54:29] Mexico and uh certainly was a great
[54:32] tremendous time with the word and the
[54:34] theme of the convention was are you
[54:37] ready for the rapture
[54:38] getting ready for the Rapture and are
[54:41] you the one that's gonna go into the
[54:42] Rapture a real powerful uh earth-shaking
[54:45] campaign as it were to remind us that we
[54:48] are not just in church to be in church
[54:50] but we are we have a destination
[54:53] we have a purpose we have an objective
[54:55] and the construct of church is temporary
[54:59] this is just a means to an end the
[55:01] purpose of the faithful Ministry we all
[55:03] say this until we all come into the
[55:05] unity of the fate and we know the
[55:07] scripture so there's a time limit even
[55:09] on preaching whether Madam said one need
[55:11] a last service will take place one last
[55:13] one day the last song uh will be sung
[55:16] when the last scripture will be read and
[55:18] that's what we're looking for that we
[55:20] are looking for a shift to change a
[55:22] transformation from this this natural
[55:24] understanding of the message and this
[55:26] natural understanding of this word into
[55:28] a spiritual Revelation that drives us
[55:30] into desperation that becomes a reality
[55:32] to us that is not just a Sunday morning
[55:35] practice or a Wednesday night practice
[55:37] so it's a Friday night prayer meeting
[55:39] something but it's something that
[55:40] becomes infused into your life it takes
[55:43] complete control you find yourself
[55:45] losing the focus of the world to become
[55:48] more focused on the things of God
[55:51] Hallelujah you don't want it to be the
[55:53] other way around that you lose the focus
[55:55] on this great gospel to get focused on
[55:57] the world we want to lose the focus of
[56:00] the world so we can get focused on dial
[56:02] in on God and that takes something to
[56:04] speak to your heart that becomes a
[56:06] reality that shakes you from your
[56:08] lethargy and shakes you from this church
[56:10] canality and this church formality and
[56:13] that's the problem we have in the the
[56:15] the the the world today people have all
[56:17] the books and the tapes and I was I had
[56:19] the opportunity after the the meeting to
[56:22] visit one of the homes
[56:24] and you know and they had some questions
[56:25] and we were there you know speaking and
[56:27] having the translation in Spanish and so
[56:29] forth about how casual the message has
[56:32] become
[56:33] how we take it for granted and I was
[56:35] able to share you know but over his own
[56:37] testimony of coming into the message
[56:39] when uh he was 17 years old and in those
[56:42] days the books were a rare thing
[56:44] and when a book came it was a real
[56:46] hunger and a thirst to get the book
[56:48] because you wanted to know what else did
[56:50] the prophet say what else did the
[56:51] prophet teach what else did he show and
[56:53] these things and and now we live in a
[56:55] day when all of the books and all the
[56:57] tapes on your mobile device but most
[56:59] people spend time not in the message on
[57:02] their mobile devices they spend time
[57:03] doing other things Hallelujah they spend
[57:06] times giving unto the distraction and
[57:09] it's because they have lost the focus
[57:12] and they fail to recognize the day and
[57:14] the time that we are living in but I
[57:15] believe that despite all of the
[57:17] distractions and the news and and listen
[57:20] there are more news and content than
[57:22] ever was before
[57:23] think of 40 50 years ago if you didn't
[57:25] get a newspaper you didn't know what was
[57:27] going on but now it's the TVs and news
[57:28] is the internet is the radio it's every
[57:31] possible channel to try to pull your
[57:33] attention away from your prayer life to
[57:35] pull your attention away from crying and
[57:38] sighing and talking to the Lord but God
[57:40] is going to have somebody
[57:42] I don't know if it's going to be one
[57:44] person who's going to be two people but
[57:45] I there's a quarterback but Brandon said
[57:47] the Raptor may be just this much I don't
[57:49] know who that's going to be but Lord I
[57:50] want to be one of them
[57:52] I don't want to miss the Rapture I'd say
[57:54] it's crazy to spend all this time all
[57:57] these years in the message and miss the
[57:58] rapture
[58:00] oh hallelujah it's crazy A crazy thing
[58:03] to think that I almost made it no I
[58:06] don't want to almost make it I want to
[58:07] make it I want to make it in I want to
[58:09] know for sure I want to make my calling
[58:12] and election show and every service we
[58:14] come to is an opportunity to make our
[58:17] calling and election short to rise above
[58:20] the foolishness to rise above our
[58:22] emotions and our feelings and our issues
[58:25] and our problems and the devil has a
[58:27] laugh during the week sometimes but how
[58:29] we get down into the humanistic realm
[58:31] but if we could rise a little higher
[58:33] this morning to remind ourselves that we
[58:35] come from God and we are going back to
[58:38] God to remind ourselves that this world
[58:40] is on a trajectory and this world is
[58:42] finished there's no hope for this world
[58:44] there's no hope for the economy there's
[58:46] no hope for the government there's only
[58:48] one hope and that's in the Lord Jesus
[58:50] Christ that's in the Ark of Safety
[58:52] that's in this great message of the hour
[58:54] of Hallelujah we are not a denomination
[58:57] this is a mission and a message to
[58:59] prepare bright to meet her husband
[59:01] that's what this whole gospel is about
[59:03] it's to bring a bride into a condition
[59:06] to meet her husband is getting his
[59:09] wedding preparations and his wife hath
[59:12] made herself ready that's not a message
[59:14] to the church World less than a message
[59:16] of the message world that's a message
[59:18] yes to that elect lady and she knows who
[59:22] she is because something spoke to her on
[59:24] the inside inside and even though she
[59:27] gets beaten down and maybe she gets
[59:29] discouraged she still knows he spoke to
[59:31] me he is looking for me he is coming for
[59:36] me and every service is a reminder he is
[59:39] coming for me and we are here this
[59:41] morning to get ready what we see shall
[59:44] put our souls in the action to make a
[59:47] church that will make a Revival and I
[59:49] want to remind you this morning that one
[59:51] is a majority in God
[59:54] Hallelujah so if this service this
[59:56] morning is just to get one person back
[59:59] into position and it's worth it
[1:00:01] Hallelujah I want to be that one I trust
[1:00:04] you want to be that one I want to
[1:00:06] challenge you to be that one because the
[1:00:08] Revival is an everyday thing in your
[1:00:11] soul if nobody else wants this may this
[1:00:13] be what you want if nobody else wants to
[1:00:16] worship may you be a worshiper if nobody
[1:00:19] else wants to shout may you be the one
[1:00:21] to shout I don't care if you're five
[1:00:23] years old or 95 years old it must be
[1:00:27] your thing it must be what you are known
[1:00:29] for when people see you they know you
[1:00:32] are looking for the coming of the Lord
[1:00:34] the angel of the Lord is on the earth
[1:00:36] now not fixing things around for
[1:00:39] churches but fixing things around for
[1:00:41] the coming of the Lord that's why we are
[1:00:43] here this morning because we know he's
[1:00:45] coming and he's closer than yesterday
[1:00:47] he's closer than last week he's closer
[1:00:50] than last month oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:00:53] Hallelujah Paul thought he would have
[1:00:56] seen it but the pranama SAT so close I
[1:00:58] could almost feel it and I know this
[1:01:00] morning we are even closer still
[1:01:04] oh Hallelujah and as much as we wish
[1:01:07] this is for everybody as much as we
[1:01:09] desire this is for everybody it's not
[1:01:11] for everybody because in every Church it
[1:01:13] has three kinds of Believers Hallelujah
[1:01:16] blessed be the name of the Lord but
[1:01:18] Ibraham preacher messages said hearing
[1:01:21] recognizing and acting on the word of
[1:01:23] God there are people here there are
[1:01:25] people in message churches around the
[1:01:27] world they're just hearing they're
[1:01:28] hearing they hear him for years they
[1:01:30] hearing but they don't recognize the
[1:01:32] ministry of Jesus Christ that has been
[1:01:35] on the earth that shaping and honing
[1:01:37] into born son's filled Sons Place Sons
[1:01:40] like they didn't realize when Peter
[1:01:42] changed they were hearing ananas and
[1:01:44] Sapphira were hearing pizza but they
[1:01:46] didn't recognize her that the pillar of
[1:01:48] fire had tabernacled himself inside of
[1:01:52] Peter I hope you recognize this morning
[1:01:54] that for all of these years we have been
[1:01:57] under the ministry of Jesus Christ and
[1:02:00] this ministry of the word uh is changing
[1:02:03] and more is it a Ministry of the spirit
[1:02:05] up and one day only those who hear and
[1:02:09] recognize an actor will be caught up to
[1:02:12] meet him in the air friends I don't want
[1:02:14] to miss the Rapture I don't want to miss
[1:02:16] the Rapture I don't know about you but I
[1:02:18] want to be there I want to be numbered
[1:02:21] there Hallelujah is there anybody feel
[1:02:23] that way this morning
[1:02:26] oh Hallelujah time to play games is over
[1:02:30] it's easy to fall into this trap of
[1:02:34] coming to church and I'm in the message
[1:02:35] and I believe and I believe it's not
[1:02:38] just about believing what are you doing
[1:02:39] about the belief because Abraham
[1:02:42] believed God but there was something
[1:02:44] more than just a belief because you
[1:02:46] could believe because the Bible says
[1:02:47] even the devil believes and he trembles
[1:02:49] oh it's not just about belief what are
[1:02:51] you doing about this message brother I'm
[1:02:54] screamed out have we done enough have
[1:02:56] you done enough what have you done about
[1:02:58] this message lately what have you done
[1:03:01] about this gospel lately what is your
[1:03:04] testimony I'm not talking to the person
[1:03:06] next to you but what have you done with
[1:03:09] this gospel I'm not talking to the Lord
[1:03:11] of taking on the minister I'm talking to
[1:03:13] everybody this morning what have you
[1:03:16] done with this gospel is it all over you
[1:03:19] and keeping you alive is it your source
[1:03:22] is it your strength is it your
[1:03:24] sustenance of Hallelujah you have to
[1:03:26] forgive me this morning I can't touch
[1:03:31] [Music]
[1:03:33] break us into desperation break us into
[1:03:36] our condition to know that God is Not
[1:03:39] Just A Healer he's not just a deliverer
[1:03:41] but he's bringing a church to Perfection
[1:03:43] he's bringing a church at a Rapture he's
[1:03:47] bringing and preparing our people to
[1:03:48] leave this place
[1:03:49] [Applause]
[1:03:53] Hallelujah young people are taking it
[1:03:56] easy people are doing what they want to
[1:03:58] do they want to be entertained they want
[1:04:01] to be hooked on to their Center of atom
[1:04:02] they keep it on top of all these other
[1:04:04] things up but they're missing the markup
[1:04:06] of what we are born to do they're
[1:04:09] missing the mark of the great
[1:04:10] commissioner they are missing the
[1:04:12] preparation they are missing the
[1:04:14] applying of the token on the door of

[1:10:00] I don't know why I'm here this morning
[1:10:02] but this is where the Lord has leading
[1:10:04] me something got to happen something
[1:10:06] that is to us some of you holding on
[1:10:09] with your sickness and holding on with
[1:10:11] your trouble and God is saying you
[1:10:12] haven't obeyed me yet you haven't done
[1:10:14] what you're supposed to do yet all these
[1:10:16] years in the message and God is waiting
[1:10:18] to bless you but he's waiting for you to
[1:10:20] do what you're supposed to do God will
[1:10:22] not do what you're supposed to do he
[1:10:24] will only do what he has to do but this
[1:10:26] word makes it clear he said full
[1:10:28] obedience to the entire word of God will
[1:10:32] entitle you to the token
[1:10:34] we know these things we have read these
[1:10:37] things we are preach these things so why
[1:10:39] are you still playing games
[1:10:41] [Applause]
[1:10:46] Hallelujah I'm not just trying to rebuke
[1:10:48] you this morning I'm trying to encourage
[1:10:51] you
[1:10:52] and push you because we're in a battle
[1:10:54] and I need you and you need me and we
[1:10:57] need each other because the enemy knows
[1:10:59] the Bible said that time is short and he
[1:11:01] wants to take out as many people before
[1:11:03] but God give us a strength as Believers
[1:11:06] this morning we are not gonna just back
[1:11:08] down and let the devil run rough shot
[1:11:10] over the church We're not gonna let
[1:11:11] devil run into your home and destroy
[1:11:13] your home and destroy your family and
[1:11:15] allow the devil to infiltrate you with
[1:11:17] the music and the fashion and the styles
[1:11:19] [Applause]
[1:11:24] I saw her young sister this week while I
[1:11:28] was driving on the road
[1:11:29] wearing a skirt that was so far above an
[1:11:32] ear wondering what was going on but she
[1:11:34] said in the church this morning
[1:11:38] and I asked myself the question because
[1:11:40] Ibraham said I could preacher I'm blue
[1:11:41] in the face
[1:11:43] but unless this thing becomes a reality
[1:11:45] to you you're playing games
[1:11:49] there Comes A Time the Bible says when
[1:11:51] and and and and the word says that
[1:11:53] seeking the Lord while he might be found
[1:11:56] there's a time limit
[1:11:58] call upon him while he is there let the
[1:12:01] wicked forsake his way and the
[1:12:02] unrighteous man his thoughts
[1:12:05] how so slow will you always be that
[1:12:08] somebody gonna be on which is a big
[1:12:09] stick because a Christian is not here
[1:12:11] you live on a Sunday morning
[1:12:18] you better pray I don't call a name from
[1:12:20] the pulpit
[1:12:23] we're gonna be fighting for your soul to
[1:12:25] try to point you to heaven to point to
[1:12:27] the glory to point you to the Rapture
[1:12:28] where you want to go to hell there's
[1:12:30] only two influences you didn't want to
[1:12:31] go to heaven or you want to go to hell
[1:12:32] choose you this day whom you will serve
[1:12:36] and for some it may be on the external
[1:12:38] but for some reason the internal with
[1:12:40] your Orcs And your grudges and your
[1:12:42] disrespect and the animosity and the
[1:12:44] gossiping and God is looking at it this
[1:12:46] morning and saying you know better you
[1:12:48] could do better obey the world and be a
[1:12:51] real question or
[1:12:52] [Applause]
[1:12:53] [Music]
[1:12:55] serve him with everything make it your
[1:12:58] hundred percent
[1:13:00] a hundred percent that's what God wants
[1:13:02] he don't want a piece of your life he
[1:13:04] wants all of you
[1:13:06] he deserves it your life is not your own
[1:13:09] he gave you life and the least he's
[1:13:12] asking is for you to give it back to him
[1:13:17] somebody helped me this morning
[1:13:19] somebody helped me this morning real
[1:13:21] Christian not afraid to tell the truth
[1:13:23] not afraid to remind you to tell you
[1:13:25] that Hell is Hot and Heaven is high
[1:13:29] judgment begins in the sanctuary it
[1:13:32] begins in the house of God
[1:13:36] Hallelujah anybody with me this morning
[1:13:40] Hallelujah we hear the doctor's room
[1:13:42] this morning we have a surgery this
[1:13:44] morning
[1:13:47] be a real Christian or no Christian at
[1:13:49] all
[1:13:51] I was sharing in Mexico at home I said
[1:13:53] the things that were not nowhere near
[1:13:55] the message 40 years ago 30 years ago
[1:13:57] they have creeped into our homes
[1:14:00] until people come to church and not in
[1:14:02] the spirit
[1:14:03] because they've been duped the Bible
[1:14:05] said guard your heart for out of your
[1:14:07] heart are all the issues of life
[1:14:10] and your eyes are Doorway to your soul
[1:14:13] so all the stuff you're watching and
[1:14:14] consuming the conversations
[1:14:17] I preached a message remember Lord's
[1:14:19] wife in Mexico and I read the scripture
[1:14:21] in Peter where Peter redeemed lot and
[1:14:24] saying lot was was vexed just by the
[1:14:27] conversation of those that were in
[1:14:29] Solomon Gomorrah
[1:14:31] some of us the conversation don't bother
[1:14:33] us
[1:14:34] it wasn't just the actions were
[1:14:36] bothering not to know test the
[1:14:37] conversation was bothering him
[1:14:41] I have a title this morning
[1:14:44] by the grace of God for the time that
[1:14:46] the Lord will have me speak this morning
[1:14:47] because thou has done this
[1:14:52] that's my title this morning because
[1:14:54] thou has done this
[1:14:57] but over the preacher's message I
[1:14:58] believe twice before he called it
[1:15:00] because I was done this thing he took
[1:15:02] the entire scripture so I'm going to go
[1:15:04] with because I was done this
[1:15:06] because he has something to do
[1:15:10] it's not because you have heard this but
[1:15:11] because you have done this thing
[1:15:14] Hallelujah not because you believe this
[1:15:16] thing but because thou has done this
[1:15:18] thing
[1:15:19] that's why I asked the question what are
[1:15:20] you doing with this message
[1:15:22] because it's not good enough just for
[1:15:24] you to to know the truth if you're not
[1:15:26] doing something about the truth because
[1:15:28] there's no sin outside of unbelief yes
[1:15:33] sin smoking is the attribute of sin
[1:15:37] are we with me so it means if you truly
[1:15:39] believe and all the things that you find
[1:15:41] yourself doing you have to wonder if you
[1:15:43] really believe because believing will
[1:15:45] put you along a certain path if you are
[1:15:48] a True Believer you will never have a
[1:15:50] problem dressing like a Christian but
[1:15:52] it's because you don't believe you allow
[1:15:54] yourself to dress the wrong way because
[1:15:55] you don't believe
[1:16:00] because they never had a revelation
[1:16:03] because if it's revealed to you then
[1:16:05] whether your friends do it or not you
[1:16:07] still are Christian because it's your
[1:16:09] Revelation it's an individual thing
[1:16:14] [Applause]
[1:16:15] and when you read scripture before there
[1:16:17] was bride or the reference of Bride in
[1:16:20] scripture there was church
[1:16:22] Jesus said Upon This Rock I build my
[1:16:25] church when you go down later in the New
[1:16:27] Testament you see the introduction of
[1:16:28] Bride As distinct from church and before
[1:16:30] church it was a people I've heard the
[1:16:32] cries of my people the first time God
[1:16:34] referenced people wasn't Exodus
[1:16:37] Exodus 3 the first time he referenced
[1:16:39] church was in Matthew 16 but before
[1:16:41] there was bride there was church before
[1:16:43] there was church there was people and
[1:16:44] before there was people there were
[1:16:46] individuals
[1:16:47] Abraham come leave your family leave
[1:16:51] your people I'll show you a place that
[1:16:53] you're not gonna figure out yet just
[1:16:54] keep walking and we know that Abraham
[1:16:57] was seeking a city whose maker and Bella
[1:16:59] was gone he had no idea how he's going
[1:17:01] to pay his bills he had no idea where
[1:17:04] God was leaving him but he was following
[1:17:05] by faith that's why he's called a father
[1:17:07] of Faith before bride Church before
[1:17:10] church people before people Abraham
[1:17:13] upon which the foundation was built
[1:17:15] because we are seeds Royal seeds of
[1:17:18] Abraham if you are in this thing I pray
[1:17:21] you in this thing you know friends oh
[1:17:23] hallelujah hallelujah I don't know who
[1:17:26] is what kind of believer I know in this
[1:17:28] church I have three kinds of believers
[1:17:31] I pray that there are some True
[1:17:32] Believers here this morning who are
[1:17:34] willing not just a sacrifice but to obey
[1:17:37] because the word tells us that obedience
[1:17:39] is better than sacrifice there are many
[1:17:41] here they want to do the sacrifice part
[1:17:43] but they don't want to really obedience
[1:17:45] park or how you don't hear me this
[1:17:47] morning
[1:17:47] [Music]
[1:17:48] [Applause]
[1:17:53] are you obeying the word
[1:17:56] because this message is a message of
[1:17:57] obedience so no because the only thing
[1:18:00] that I know that entitled to the Token
[1:18:01] is full obedience not Full Sacrifice
[1:18:05] sacrifice is important we bring a
[1:18:07] sacrifice of praise we bring our
[1:18:09] sacrifice it's a sacrifice your life is
[1:18:11] a sacrifice but God is teaching us
[1:18:13] through the word that obedience is
[1:18:15] better than sacrifice
[1:18:17] because many people they look at their
[1:18:19] sacrifice as their way in
[1:18:22] I did this Lord and I did this Lord and
[1:18:25] I'm willing to do this and I give up
[1:18:26] this and they want to sacrifice
[1:18:29] but they don't want to be
[1:18:34] I hope this thing's done you know
[1:18:35] because we want a perfect Church
[1:18:37] I'd rather have two people who want fire
[1:18:39] for god brother punch who really have
[1:18:41] their swords so drawn that the devil
[1:18:43] knowed that no matter what side he end
[1:18:44] up getting caught with the game cut
[1:18:47] because the world is sharper than I need
[1:18:48] two head sword and he always have your
[1:18:50] sword ready like Joshua are you for us
[1:18:52] or are against us because we want to be
[1:18:54] obedient
[1:18:58] you know the best place the little
[1:19:00] obedience is in the Army you know
[1:19:02] because orders come and you obey the
[1:19:04] orders you don't question the orders
[1:19:06] sir yes sir you don't say well why I'm
[1:19:09] not sure I want to take this certain
[1:19:10] Mission no if you're a soldier you take
[1:19:13] the orders and if you don't take the
[1:19:14] order they throw you in that prison
[1:19:19] for insubordination for air War whatever
[1:19:21] it called but in the Army is wanting
[1:19:23] you're taking orders
[1:19:27] and that's a problem many of us because
[1:19:29] our the orders from God goes against the
[1:19:31] things we want to do
[1:19:36] Holy Ghost you have to make yourself a
[1:19:38] Christian
[1:19:40] so it's a constant effort a constant
[1:19:42] work of sacrifice and obedience so it's
[1:19:45] a sacrifice to be here but there's also
[1:19:46] more important to obey God to be here
[1:19:49] he said don't forsake the assembling of
[1:19:51] yourselves together as the manner of
[1:19:53] some
[1:19:54] who wanted to stay home and do what they
[1:19:56] want to do and they want to serve God by
[1:19:58] their own construct
[1:20:02] God will bless you for your obedience
[1:20:05] when it's time to pray you pray when
[1:20:07] it's time to worship It's Time To
[1:20:08] Worship when it's time to fast you're
[1:20:10] fast
[1:20:12] but you're being gone you're living as a
[1:20:15] Christian you may not understand it but
[1:20:16] you obeying God
[1:20:18] you know if
[1:20:20] uh kin had just obeyed and just follow
[1:20:23] this brother he will again blessed
[1:20:25] it had nothing to do then even with
[1:20:26] Revelation you know
[1:20:29] all he had to do was just obey
[1:20:31] do you realize that the whole issue with
[1:20:33] this fall was just one of exactly
[1:20:35] disobedience
[1:20:40] let me read a scripture for you could
[1:20:42] you could you take some more
[1:20:45] but obviously announced Saturn I want to
[1:20:47] go to Ephesians 5. just to kind of lay a
[1:20:50] few things
[1:20:51] gonna touch a few scriptures
[1:20:55] Ephesians 5 and verse 1.
[1:20:58] you could find it in the scriptures
[1:21:01] be therefore followers of God as their
[1:21:04] children
[1:21:06] and walk in love as Christ also hath
[1:21:09] loved us
[1:21:11] and hath given himself for us an
[1:21:14] offering and a sacrifice to God for a
[1:21:17] sweet smelling savor
[1:21:20] now this is a message to the Ephesians
[1:21:23] Church
[1:21:24] this is the same Ephesians that
[1:21:26] parallels Joshua this was that original
[1:21:29] Mighty Ephesians back to another
[1:21:31] Ephesians that we preach about and look
[1:21:33] at the
[1:21:34] teaching that's coming to this Ephesus
[1:21:36] Church
[1:21:37] but fornication and all uncleanness
[1:21:41] or covetousness let it not be once named
[1:21:46] among you has become it since
[1:21:50] in other words it not even be mentioned
[1:21:52] among you
[1:21:54] you're supposed to live higher than that
[1:21:58] everybody with me
[1:22:01] neither filthiness
[1:22:04] in every form category nor foolish
[1:22:07] talking
[1:22:13] not foolish talking
[1:22:17] nor jesting
[1:22:20] what is just in jokes or is that funny
[1:22:22] Joker noise it's kind of inappropriate
[1:22:24] but are you a Christian or you're not a
[1:22:26] Christian
[1:22:28] which I'm not convenient but
[1:22:32] this is how you're supposed to be rather
[1:22:34] giving of thanks
[1:22:35] so if it's one thing that people should
[1:22:38] know you for is being thankful
[1:22:41] and we heard the message some weeks ago
[1:22:43] remember the old who preached about
[1:22:44] living in the game it was all about
[1:22:46] being grateful and being thankful
[1:22:47] because it'll be a million things you're
[1:22:50] not happy about but if you spend more
[1:22:51] time on what you're thankful for you'll
[1:22:54] find your whole perspective on life
[1:22:55] changes Lord I Thank you for waking me
[1:22:56] up I thank you I eat when I eat cricks
[1:22:59] this morning a half a crick
[1:23:02] I still thank you
[1:23:04] and it puts you as an atmosphere because
[1:23:06] whenever attitude of gratitude and
[1:23:09] gratefulness and Thanksgiving and
[1:23:10] something happens around you
[1:23:14] for this you know that no whoremonger no
[1:23:18] unclean person nor Covetous man who is
[1:23:21] an idolatop had any inheritance in the
[1:23:25] Kingdom of Christ and of God
[1:23:27] he goes and let no man deceive you with
[1:23:30] vain words but because of these things
[1:23:32] these things we're talking about come at
[1:23:35] the wrath of God upon the children of
[1:23:38] disobedience
[1:23:41] so I want to hit there the children of
[1:23:42] Disobedience because we're talking about
[1:23:44] obedience persons Disobedience and we
[1:23:46] read that scripture in Genesis about God
[1:23:49] saying because thou has done this thing
[1:23:51] and has obeyed my voice
[1:23:57] friends
[1:23:59] we have to have this word as a reality
[1:24:01] to us
[1:24:03] and be obedient to this word of God
[1:24:07] I would have done a Bible teaching some
[1:24:08] time ago on the curse of disobedience
[1:24:11] and this is where I got it from where in
[1:24:14] Deuteronomy 11 verse 1.
[1:24:20] you could put the scripture up if you
[1:24:22] want uh Deuteronomy 11 verse 1 therefore
[1:24:25] Thou shalt love the Lord thy God and
[1:24:27] keep his charge and his statutes and his
[1:24:29] judgment and his Commandments always
[1:24:34] and this is why I say I'm speaking now
[1:24:35] to those in the church for ye know this
[1:24:38] therefore I speak not with your children
[1:24:39] which have not known
[1:24:41] in other words I'm speaking to you here
[1:24:43] because you know
[1:24:46] which have not seen the chastisement of
[1:24:49] the Lord your God his greatness his
[1:24:50] mighty hand and his stretch out arm you
[1:24:52] know but I will always say this message
[1:24:54] world hasn't seen judgment yet
[1:24:58] but God was speaking at this people
[1:25:00] saying you guys know the chastisement of
[1:25:03] the Lord his greatness his mighty hand
[1:25:05] and his stressed out arm and his
[1:25:07] miracles and his acts which he did in
[1:25:09] the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king
[1:25:11] of Egypt and unto all his land
[1:25:14] and what he did unto the army of Egypt
[1:25:16] unto their horses and to their chariots
[1:25:19] how he made a water of Red Sea to
[1:25:21] overflow them as they pursued after you
[1:25:24] and how the Lord had destroyed them unto
[1:25:26] this day
[1:25:27] and what he did unto you in the
[1:25:28] wilderness until you came into this
[1:25:30] place and what he didn't have dethan and
[1:25:33] abiram the sons of eliab the son of
[1:25:36] Reuben how the Earth opened her mouth
[1:25:38] and swallowed them up and their
[1:25:40] households and their tents and all the
[1:25:43] substance that was in their possession
[1:25:45] in the midst of all Israel
[1:25:47] but your eyes have seen all the great
[1:25:49] acts of the Lord which he did therefore
[1:25:52] shall you keep all the Commandments
[1:25:54] which I command you this day that he may
[1:25:57] be strong and going and possess the land
[1:26:00] whether he go to possess it and that ye
[1:26:03] may prolong your days in the land which
[1:26:06] the Lord sway unto your fathers to give
[1:26:08] unto them unto their seed a land that
[1:26:10] floweth milk and honey
[1:26:13] is not as the land of Egypt from when
[1:26:16] she came out where those soweth thy seed
[1:26:19] and water is it with thy foot as a
[1:26:21] garden of herbs but the land whether you
[1:26:23] go to possess it is a land of Hills and
[1:26:25] Valleys and drinketh water of the reign
[1:26:28] of the heaven
[1:26:29] allow me to the Lord thy God carried for
[1:26:32] the eyes of the Lord thy God are always
[1:26:35] upon it from the beginning of the year
[1:26:37] even until the end of the year
[1:26:39] and it shall come to pass if he shall
[1:26:42] hack and diligently
[1:26:44] unto my Commandments which I command you
[1:26:47] this day to love the Lord your God and
[1:26:51] to serve him with all your heart and
[1:26:53] with all your soul you see the command
[1:26:56] of the Lord serve him can you tell me
[1:26:58] this morning that you really serving God
[1:27:00] with all your heart and all your soul
[1:27:03] if that's not your statement let it be
[1:27:05] your desire this morning Lord I want to
[1:27:07] serve you with all my heart all of my
[1:27:10] soul the key to unlock your blessing is
[1:27:13] tied to this
[1:27:15] verse 14 that I will give you the reign
[1:27:17] of your land in his new season the first
[1:27:20] rain and the latter rain that now may as
[1:27:23] thou mayest Gather in thy corn and thy
[1:27:25] wine and then oil and I will send grass
[1:27:28] in thy fields for thy cuttle that thou
[1:27:31] mayest eat and be full take heed to
[1:27:34] yourselves at your heart be not deceived
[1:27:37] and he turned aside and serve other gods
[1:27:39] and worship them we know the prophet
[1:27:41] taught us anything could be your God you
[1:27:43] can make the news your God you can make
[1:27:45] clothes your God you can make fashion

[1:27:50] your children your God you can make
[1:27:52] money your God but he said serve no
[1:27:54] other cause and worship them and then
[1:27:57] the laws wrapped shall be Kindle against
[1:27:59] you and he shot up the heaven that there
[1:28:02] be no rain that the land yield not of
[1:28:04] fruit unless he perish quickly from off
[1:28:07] the good land which the lord giveth you
[1:28:10] therefore shall he lay up his my words
[1:28:13] in your heart and in your soul and bind
[1:28:15] them for a sign upon your hand that they
[1:28:19] may be as frontlets between your eyes
[1:28:21] and listen you parents you shall teach
[1:28:24] them your children so speaking of them
[1:28:28] when those cities in nine homes you see
[1:28:29] what we're talking about and when no
[1:28:31] walk is by the way when thou liest down
[1:28:34] and when they'll rise it up
[1:28:38] what is what they teach them the way of
[1:28:40] the Lord
[1:28:42] when you sit with them in the house what
[1:28:43] are you talking about when you're
[1:28:45] walking by the way what they're talking
[1:28:46] about when you're lying down what you're
[1:28:48] talking about when you're waking up what
[1:28:50] you're talking about and thou shall
[1:28:52] write them upon the doorpost of thine
[1:28:54] house
[1:28:55] and upon thy Gates that your days may be
[1:28:59] multiplied and the days of your children
[1:29:01] in the land which the Lord swear unto
[1:29:04] your Pharisee give them as the days of
[1:29:06] Heaven upon the Earth for if he shall
[1:29:09] diligently keep all these Commandments
[1:29:11] which I command you to do them to love
[1:29:13] the Lord your God to walk in all his
[1:29:16] ways and the cleave unto him then will
[1:29:19] the Lord drive out all these nations
[1:29:22] from before you and ye shall possess
[1:29:24] greater Nations and mightier than
[1:29:27] yourselves every place wherein the
[1:29:30] swords of your feet shall tread shall be
[1:29:32] yours from the Wilderness and Lebanon
[1:29:34] from the river the river Euphrates even
[1:29:36] unto the uttermost sea shall your cause
[1:29:38] be there shall no man be able to stand
[1:29:41] before thee for the Lord your God shall
[1:29:44] lay the fear of you and the dread of you
[1:29:47] upon all the land that he shall
[1:29:49] treadable as he has said be unto you
[1:29:51] behold I set before you this day a
[1:29:54] blessing and a curse a blessing if ye
[1:29:58] obey the Commandments of the Lord your
[1:30:00] God which I command you this day so
[1:30:02] there's an automatic blessing that comes
[1:30:05] with obedience
[1:30:08] and a curse if you will not obey the
[1:30:10] Commandments of the Lord your God
[1:30:13] but turn aside out of the way which I
[1:30:15] command you this day to go after other
[1:30:18] gods which he have not known may the
[1:30:20] Lord had a blessing to the reading of
[1:30:21] his word so we saw all the way back
[1:30:24] there God said is a blessing that I
[1:30:25] place upon you once you obey and there's
[1:30:28] a curse that's tied to Disobedience so
[1:30:30] so many people in the message for years
[1:30:32] they're doing what they want to do they
[1:30:34] sacrifice it how they want to sacrifice
[1:30:35] but there's no real obedience there's no
[1:30:38] real sighing there's no real commitment
[1:30:41] there's no real Zeal there's no real
[1:30:43] enthusiasm I know this is not the kind
[1:30:45] of message that John but in the shout
[1:30:47] but it's a real look at your life and
[1:30:48] say Lord I want to be a hundred percent
[1:30:50] he said love the Lord with all your
[1:30:53] heart with all your soul with all your

[1:31:15] things now friends obeying the Lord and

[1:31:49] direct scripture obedience is tightly a
[1:31:52] blessing some of you children you're not
[1:31:54] seeing your way because you're just
[1:31:55] disobedient
[1:31:57] and especially if you're here in the
[1:31:59] house of God more so because your
[1:32:01] parents not telling you to do no

[1:32:36] unto all them that obey him
[1:32:38] so this blessing is only to those who

[1:37:39] name of the Lord
[1:37:40] I want to touch my text
[1:37:43] we know the story of Abraham we mention
[1:37:45] it
[1:37:46] he followed the Lord
[1:37:48] he didn't know where he was going he
[1:37:50] wasn't in a church he had no example but
[1:37:52] God spoke to him and he followed God
[1:37:55] faithfully and God began to deal with
[1:37:57] his son Abraham and at a certain point
[1:38:00] God said Abraham what do you want at the
[1:38:04] beginning I mean all the story and the
[1:38:06] promise of a son came to Abraham and God
[1:38:09] didn't tell him when he's going to have
[1:38:10] a son
[1:38:12] and when God spoke to him Sarah laughed
[1:38:14] within herself because she knew she was
[1:38:16] past the age of childbearing Not only
[1:38:19] was she past the age of child Baron but
[1:38:21] she was Barren to begin with so two
[1:38:22] things were working against her
[1:38:25] but yet still Abraham had faith and the
[1:38:27] Bible said he believed God and he
[1:38:29] staggered not at the promise of God when
[1:38:32] one month was passed Syria feeling any
[1:38:34] better no one are feeling better you're
[1:38:35] still going to have a son you know I
[1:38:37] believe it Abraham after one year two
[1:38:39] years ten years 15 years he still had
[1:38:42] the same fate that he was going to have
[1:38:44] the promise because he knew God spoke to
[1:38:46] him his doctor said Abraham I'm not sure
[1:38:48] but this is crazy I don't know if it's
[1:38:50] already going to work out but nothing
[1:38:51] moved Abraham the Bible said he
[1:38:53] staggered not at the promise every
[1:38:56] service he came in he staggered not at a
[1:38:58] promise he in the message for 10 years
[1:39:01] but he's not staggering because he knows
[1:39:03] that this message he heard is real it's
[1:39:05] true he don't know when it's going to
[1:39:07] happen to know how it's going to happen
[1:39:08] but you know it's going to happen
[1:39:09] Hallelujah is God spoke to him nobody
[1:39:13] could discourage him nobody could
[1:39:14] dissuade him Hallelujah people tell him
[1:39:17] it's impossible but he's still crazy
[1:39:19] enough to believe that he's going to
[1:39:21] have a Revival in his home he's crazy
[1:39:23] enough to believe that resurrection
[1:39:25] power is not just going to come to him
[1:39:27] but his wife Sarah and he's believing
[1:39:30] God for 15 years 16 years 17 years it's
[1:39:33] not getting easier for him it's getting
[1:39:35] harder for him he's getting a little
[1:39:36] slower maybe get a little weary and
[1:39:38] tired but he said I'm still gonna have a
[1:39:40] son he's coming to service every Sunday
[1:39:44] I'm still gonna have a son 21 years 22
[1:39:48] years 23 years by now people say Abraham
[1:39:50] done lost it but after 25 years here
[1:39:54] comes a visitation and here comes a
[1:39:56] little boy named Isaac to be the
[1:39:58] Vindication that after all these years
[1:40:01] in the messages message was real it was
[1:40:03] real in his soul and I can imagine the
[1:40:06] celebration and the joy and the Victory
[1:40:09] after Abraham saw that boy he said it
[1:40:12] was worth it oh mama we made it up this
[1:40:15] thing we preached about is a reality and
[1:40:17] I look power to the dead church when we
[1:40:19] could say mama we made it we made it
[1:40:22] over the prophet left us but this
[1:40:25] message is real we will just be in
[1:40:28] tested we will just be in tried but we
[1:40:31] held on

[1:45:01] because that seed has a certain DNA that
[1:45:06] seed has a certain power that seed is
[1:45:08] designed to do a certain thing
[1:45:12] and that sea could only do what it's
[1:45:14] designed to do that seed has only one
[1:45:17] mission that see that's only one thing
[1:45:19] to do to bring forth after it's kind
[1:45:24] he can only bring forth after it's kind
[1:45:26] [Applause]
[1:45:28] I bring forth another kind

[1:45:36] word that kindness the holy ghost that
[1:45:39] kindness Dynamics
[1:45:53] [Music]
[1:45:58] and that seed according to the scripture

[1:46:03] [Applause]
[1:46:05] every gate of the enemy every kid to the
[1:46:08] enemy every kid to the enemy if they'll
[1:46:10] get the sickness that seed is designed
[1:46:13] to possess the Gate of sickness up if
[1:46:15] that I shot if that seed is luster that
[1:46:18] serious designer to blow up lust up to
[1:46:22] blow up filthiness The Blob on godliness
[1:46:27] foreign
[1:46:29] [Music]
[1:46:41] of the seed in you
[1:46:44] that sea that's why the Bible could say
[1:46:46] greater is he that's in you
[1:46:48] it's that seed that sea gem that is a
[1:46:52] part of God that the devil can't mess
[1:46:54] with he cannot touch it he cannot access
[1:46:57] it if he comes close to Earth there's a
[1:47:00] power in that seed that repels the devil
[1:47:02] oh Hallelujah that seed is what puts a
[1:47:06] beacon of Life over you that seed is
[1:47:09] what attracts the Holy Ghost to be over
[1:47:11] you when you walk in this morning the
[1:47:14] Holy Ghost was here because seeds are in
[1:47:16] the house
[1:47:18] Royal seat of Abraham see that are
[1:47:22] designed to overcome Caesar designed to
[1:47:24] worship see that resign to put your foot
[1:47:27] on the neck of the devil seeds seeds are
[1:47:31] dry seeds
[1:47:33] and they are seated here this morning
[1:47:36] dry seeds up waiting for the Holy Ghost
[1:47:40] foreign
[1:47:44] [Applause]
[1:47:54] the devil knows he can't touch the
[1:47:56] spirit
[1:47:59] the devil can never go to war with the
[1:48:02] Holy Ghost he knows he don't have a
[1:48:04] chance so the only thing the devil could
[1:48:06] try to do with the Terence is to attack
[1:48:08] the world because the devil understands
[1:48:11] that the word is the conductor of the
[1:48:13] spirit so for all these years the devil
[1:48:16] had only one strategy to attack the
[1:48:18] world because the world tells you who
[1:48:20] you are the word identifies your purpose
[1:48:23] the word tells you why you were born the
[1:48:26] word is God I shall Hallelujah so for
[1:48:30] all these years from when Jesus left

[1:48:35] the ages that was the devil's job let me

[1:55:33] I shared one time I went to a meeting
[1:55:36] and I walked in the room and a
[1:55:38] businessman was in a room and I always
[1:55:40] told my dad when I walk into that room I
[1:55:42] knew he was a Christian
[1:55:44] he didn't even say a word to me
[1:55:46] but the moment I walked in you just felt
[1:55:49] this man as a Christian when he didn't
[1:55:50] have to say a word and I came down
[1:55:52] afterwards he's a real Christian
[1:55:54] with the Revelation that God has given
[1:55:55] him he's living the best he could with
[1:55:57] what he knows and I say Lord let it
[1:55:59] Peter when people meet you meet me they
[1:56:01] must say that's a Christian they must
[1:56:03] have to ask the question they must know
[1:56:04] because they're oozing out to you your
[1:56:07] words are now secondary your words were

[1:56:34] attitude
[1:56:36] your parents the issues you have with

[1:56:58] Moses went through 40 Years of former
[1:57:00] trading 40 Years of wilderness training
[1:57:02] and in five minutes he had his reboot
[1:57:05] his restart his reset
[1:57:08] that change the trajectory of of this
[1:57:10] gospel is wood could you take some more
[1:57:15] so we're talking about Abraham
[1:57:18] and the joy that Abraham would have felt
[1:57:23] when everything worked out for him
[1:57:25] and the promise that he believed was no
[1:57:28] reality
[1:57:30] as a baby
[1:57:31] one year old two years old growing up as
[1:57:33] it were
[1:57:34] The Joy he felt as a father
[1:57:37] being how God is good
[1:57:39] God is faithful
[1:57:41] God is real
[1:57:47] and then they came a point in Abraham's
[1:57:49] life
[1:57:50] when as if the 25-year test was not
[1:57:54] enough of a test that God wanted to give
[1:57:55] him a deeper test
[1:58:01] America when he speaks about adoption
[1:58:05] he talks about he'll turn the church
[1:58:06] against you
[1:58:08] he'll turn your wife against you he
[1:58:10] truly in a bit of sickness
[1:58:12] that's not just quotes
[1:58:15] that's a life
[1:58:18] because he wants to understand what's in
[1:58:20] you
[1:58:22] friends when things are good
[1:58:25] the real you
[1:58:28] don't see it you know
[1:58:30] let me say that one more time when
[1:58:31] things are good
[1:58:33] the real you
[1:58:35] doesn't show up
[1:58:38] but you see when things go wrong
[1:58:41] re-rung
[1:58:42] and there's real pressure
[1:58:45] the real person
[1:58:47] who dresses on a Sunday
[1:58:49] and say God bless you um
[1:58:55] when things go wrong that real you
[1:58:59] oh yeah
[1:59:00] among other people you might see 50 of
[1:59:03] it but it's in your home environment

[1:59:28] the moment you saw but don't start me
[1:59:32] don't stack me here
[1:59:35] and they have this weird this inflection
[1:59:36] is like certain words will be longer
[1:59:38] don't start me you know
[1:59:42] don't push me look look look look
[1:59:49] you see the moment you're gonna any of
[1:59:50] them roads you know what coming out is
[1:59:53] not Jesus
[1:59:58] and it means there's still something in
[2:00:00] you that has to die
[2:00:03] [Applause]
[2:00:04] so God has to set experiences to see if
[2:00:07] anything else is still alive it's really
[2:00:09] a test to see what is there still enough
[2:00:12] [Applause]
[2:00:14] because some people as whole good
[2:00:17] behavior for a long time
[2:00:19] you know if you go to the monks and in
[2:00:21] the in the in the forests and hiding in
[2:00:24] mountain and meditate anything you'll

[2:00:33] you're good 20 or 30 years Luciani
[2:00:37] Luchia
[2:00:41] change
[2:00:44] it's like the Pig and the and the and
[2:00:46] the lamb
[2:00:48] the issues only Fallen long enough but
[2:00:50] when he lamb falls in the mud he cries
[2:00:53] because you don't want to be there
[2:00:55] Wendy Pig after you beat him and you put
[2:00:57] a few memory they put on clothes and I'm
[2:00:59] both tire and lock him in your house for
[2:01:00] today yes and he behaving in good
[2:01:02] behavior no because you can't get out
[2:01:04] he goes to the shower like everybody
[2:01:06] putting on deodorant everything
[2:01:08] but the moment you forget it all open
[2:01:10] and he finds himself outside and you see
[2:01:12] that Monday he said wait no wait wait
[2:01:13] hold on hold on hold on you know a long
[2:01:16] I see mud
[2:01:18] I forget how good money is this this
[2:01:20] month here and he's had a dance up and
[2:01:23] live and when it is is to try to pull
[2:01:25] him back out today because this is
[2:01:26] nature
[2:01:29] and all of us have a Wonder called wants
[2:01:31] to kill because our nature is at war
[2:01:34] with his nature
[2:01:38] and before God could ever give anybody
[2:01:40] power
[2:01:41] he has to make sure that your nature not
[2:01:44] there
[2:01:46] everybody
[2:01:49] and it happens so many of us
[2:01:54] and he gave some people a little bit of
[2:01:56] power a little bit of power and they see
[2:01:58] what they made up they say listen I
[2:01:59] can't give you any more you know
[2:02:01] so you should get a little promotion a
[2:02:04] little just a little promotion and
[2:02:05] before you know it they're moving a
[2:02:07] whole different kind of way
[2:02:11] but it was something but there's a man
[2:02:13] called Ibraham
[2:02:14] God help us to be more like Abraham
[2:02:17] [Applause]
[2:02:18] that When God Says time
[2:02:20] to
[2:02:21] do something for me
[2:02:25] he said take your boy and come up and
[2:02:28] offer him up
[2:02:31] and I try to wonder what would have gone
[2:02:33] to Abraham's mind
[2:02:36] because we are human
[2:02:40] he is a man
[2:02:41] he loved his son
[2:02:44] but he still has to walk and trust God
[2:02:46] I had to find his scriptures because
[2:02:49] this will be no will be to fly and if
[2:02:51] he's a God he didn't he wasn't
[2:02:55] and Abraham is
[2:02:56] [Music]
[2:02:59] AAC is no fool you see I see everything
[2:03:01] here where is he where's he lamb
[2:03:04] something where is he laughed
[2:03:09] and they go up there and you see them we
[2:03:10] read the scripture
[2:03:11] that God had to call Abraham twice
[2:03:15] because he was prepared
[2:03:17] to obey completely
[2:03:20] he was a better sacrifice the thing that
[2:03:22] he held there
[2:03:26] obeyed to the point of giving up what he
[2:03:29] held there
[2:03:31] what he worked hard for what he waited
[2:03:33] hard for
[2:03:34] Young Brother young sister
[2:03:37] father mother are you prepared
[2:03:41] to obey to the point of giving up what
[2:03:43] you hold there
[2:03:46] God would have known If Abraham was
[2:03:47] speaking is it because Abraham he had to
[2:03:49] call him twice because he was ready to
[2:03:51] kill his son
[2:03:53] and God could say to Abraham because
[2:03:54] thou has done this thing
[2:03:57] so the whole blessing to Abraham
[2:04:00] of in blessing I Will Bless thee and and
[2:04:03] thy seat I possessed together his enemy
[2:04:05] was as a direct result
[2:04:07] of his obedience
[2:04:10] I want to challenge you young sisters
[2:04:14] live for God
[2:04:17] the word requires you to dress modestly
[2:04:22] can you not obey God
[2:04:25] the world requires you to live in purity
[2:04:30] can you not obey God
[2:04:32] and watch God bless you
[2:04:35] for obeying his word
[2:04:38] you young Brothers can you not live for
[2:04:41] God
[2:04:42] and Leave the World Behind
[2:04:45] all the linemen and the partying and the
[2:04:47] groups and all his foolishness and have
[2:04:50] a real testimony
[2:04:52] and what God bless you for obeying God
[2:04:56] your parents in here can you obey God
[2:05:00] and watch God bless your home for
[2:05:02] obeying God
[2:05:05] husbands wives
[2:05:08] all of us
[2:05:09] you know but overnight we're having this
[2:05:11] conversation
[2:05:12] God Don't Make halfway Christians
[2:05:14] but a Christian could be halfway
[2:05:17] go to make halfway preachers but the
[2:05:19] preacher could be halfway go to make
[2:05:21] halfway deacons what a dick can be
[2:05:23] halfway he will make halfway could be
[2:05:25] halfway here to make happy musician but
[2:05:27] a musician could be halfway
[2:05:33] get ready
[2:05:35] are you living for God for all the way
[2:05:46] from the message believing God but
[2:05:48] Abraham said well no whatever Abraham
[2:05:49] said then Lord now Lord I want to ask
[2:05:51] you something me here
[2:05:52] and I received this boy and poor Sarah
[2:05:55] can hardly get around she is so old and
[2:05:57] she says wrinkled up he said he must be
[2:05:58] around went in this human and secret
[2:06:00] room
[2:06:00] and I am an old man have to lead on our
[2:06:02] staff and walking and just barely can
[2:06:04] walk and I'm soul and this boy is a
[2:06:05] young man
[2:06:06] I see what you've done but you mean me
[2:06:08] to kill him it'll tear my heart out
[2:06:11] you're going to kill him but Abraham
[2:06:13] didn't stagger the prophet said he
[2:06:16] didn't know how it wasn't his business
[2:06:18] the question he obeyed
[2:06:21] I love that it wasn't his business the
[2:06:24] question half of the problem with us at
[2:06:26] times we question God too much
[2:06:30] when God wants us just obey him
[2:06:33] in a message said no Abraham one thing I
[2:06:36] want you to notice he obeyed God's word
[2:06:39] to the letter
[2:06:40] always remember that that's my message
[2:06:43] the prophet said you must obey the word
[2:06:45] and knowing anything contrary to it
[2:06:48] leave it alone
[2:06:51] it may look good but don't reason
[2:06:53] against God's word
[2:06:55] you know when I was in Mexico
[2:06:58] one of the head Deacons
[2:07:00] he asked me in the shortest phrase
[2:07:02] possible
[2:07:04] what advice would I give to a young
[2:07:06] person
[2:07:07] in 2023
[2:07:10] and my response to him was very simple
[2:07:12] and something I've said for many many
[2:07:14] years
[2:07:15] live your life
[2:07:17] as if Jesus is in the room with you
[2:07:23] short and simple live your
[2:07:26] life as if Jesus is in the room with you
[2:07:30] and if Jesus
[2:07:32] would you have that conversation
[2:07:34] would you watch that thing
[2:07:38] will you be disrespectful if Jesus in
[2:07:40] your room
[2:07:46] would you operate that way in your
[2:07:47] school if you know Jesus right there
[2:07:49] with you
[2:07:51] if you could train yourself to be that
[2:07:53] way that's the kind of thing that
[2:07:54] attracts you holy also know
[2:07:59] because he is watching
[2:08:01] it's not like he's not watching he's
[2:08:02] watching you
[2:08:11] in the expedition of the second churches
[2:08:13] of Philadelphia to change but Abraham
[2:08:14] said God being Sovereign he foreknew by
[2:08:17] Divine decree exactly who would be in
[2:08:20] his bride
[2:08:21] he chose her she did not choose him he
[2:08:25] called her she did not come on her own
[2:08:28] he died for her he washed her in his own
[2:08:31] blood he paid the price for her she
[2:08:34] belongs to him totally committed to him
[2:08:37] and he accepts the obligation he is her
[2:08:41] head for Christ is the head of his
[2:08:44] church as Sarah called Abraham Lord even
[2:08:48] so the bride is happy that he is a lord
[2:08:52] he speaks and she obeys for that is
[2:08:55] Hoodie light
[2:08:59] may we be the kind of people that
[2:09:03] obeying God is not out of force
[2:09:06] or just out of obligation but she obeys
[2:09:09] for that is her Delight we take pleasure
[2:09:12] it obeying our Lord oh Hallelujah can I
[2:09:16] read a quote one more time
[2:09:18] God being Sovereign he foreknew by
[2:09:21] Divine decree exactly who would be in
[2:09:23] his bride he chose her
[2:09:26] she did not choose him
[2:09:28] he called her she did not come on her
[2:09:31] own you see we talk about that seed
[2:09:33] brought you here he died for her he
[2:09:36] washed her in his own blood he paid the
[2:09:38] price for her she belongs to him and to
[2:09:41] him alone you don't belong to nobody
[2:09:43] else but the Lord
[2:09:45] she is wholly committed to him and he
[2:09:49] accepts the
[2:09:50] ocean
[2:09:51] he is her head for Christ is ahead of
[2:09:54] his church as Sarah called Abraham Lord
[2:09:57] even so the bride is happy that he is
[2:10:01] her Lord
[2:10:02] he speaks and she obeys for that is
[2:10:07] honey light
[2:10:08] in the Ephesians Church age brother
[2:10:10] Brown said did you get it now there are
[2:10:13] those
[2:10:14] twins again they are those two trees
[2:10:16] again growing side by side in the same
[2:10:19] Earth partaking of the same nourishment
[2:10:21] drinking in the same rain and benefit
[2:10:24] them by the same son for they come from
[2:10:26] different seeds
[2:10:28] one tree is for the word of God listen
[2:10:31] carefully exactly as God gave it and
[2:10:35] loves and obeys it
[2:10:37] the other tree is from the sea that is
[2:10:39] untied the word of God and changes it
[2:10:42] where it wants to
[2:10:44] you see the problem now
[2:10:46] where you want some things but you don't
[2:10:48] want all one tree is identified by you
[2:10:53] heard it there exactly as God give it
[2:10:55] and loves and obeys it the other tree
[2:10:58] changes it where it wants to it
[2:11:00] substitutes its own Creeds and dogmas
[2:11:03] for the living true word exactly as did
[2:11:06] Cain who ended up killing Abel but fear
[2:11:09] not little flock the prophet says stay
[2:11:11] with the word keep that word between you
[2:11:14] and the devil Eve did not do that and
[2:11:16] she failed and when the church lets down
[2:11:19] on the word she goes into the depths of
[2:11:21] Darkness of Satan I'm just one or two
[2:11:24] more quotes and I'm done
[2:11:26] now the family of God in the message
[2:11:27] God's only provided place of worship now
[2:11:30] the family of God obeys the order of the
[2:11:32] family of the father of the family
[2:11:35] you hear what I said there the family of
[2:11:38] God obeys the order of the father of the
[2:11:40] family
[2:11:40] so God is looking for obedient children
[2:11:42] you know
[2:11:43] it's not taking more frustrating than a
[2:11:45] disobedient child
[2:11:48] we say a hard head
[2:11:50] I'll tell you something yeah and then
[2:11:53] went again tell you not to do it
[2:11:57] and we have some hard-head people in
[2:11:59] church you know
[2:12:03] yes in church and it's still can't fix
[2:12:06] these things
[2:12:07] not the family of God obeys the order of
[2:12:10] the father of the family and he is a
[2:12:12] prince of peace the Mighty God the
[2:12:14] Everlasting father and of his dominion
[2:12:16] and Reign there shall be no end the
[2:12:18] government shall be upon his shoulders
[2:12:20] and him being Governor King Emmanuel
[2:12:23] first last Prince of Peace the Mighty
[2:12:26] God Everlasting father every one of his
[2:12:29] children obey every word to the order
[2:12:32] because they are part of him
[2:12:38] so you know who will still run out
[2:12:40] because it shouldn't obey him they are
[2:12:42] part of that family
[2:12:44] or if this is the word of God from the
[2:12:46] sadistan churches if this is the word of
[2:12:49] God which indeed it is then it must be
[2:12:51] obeyed failure to obey would bring
[2:12:54] judgment
[2:12:56] from God's provided away for this day
[2:12:58] like Naaman dipping in the waters of
[2:13:01] Jordan why he said the waters in up in
[2:13:04] his country is much cleaner and better
[2:13:05] but that wasn't where the Prophet said
[2:13:07] dip here he dipped once leprosy still
[2:13:10] there six times it was still there he
[2:13:12] had to obey and come God's way and when
[2:13:15] he fully obeyed God's way the leprosy
[2:13:18] left
[2:13:18] and I say tonight if we obey God's
[2:13:21] provided way leprosy will leave sickness
[2:13:24] will leave everything will lead but
[2:13:26] we've got to come his way for this day
[2:13:28] now dipping in the Jordan won't do any
[2:13:31] good no for that was for Neiman the laws
[2:13:33] for the Jews Grace is by Christ but each
[2:13:36] age has its part of the Gospel already
[2:13:39] predicted the Bible is a complete
[2:13:41] revelation of Jesus Christ there can be
[2:13:43] no more added to it or anything taken
[2:13:45] away from it the person who does it is
[2:13:47] cursed we cannot add nothing to it take
[2:13:49] nothing we met we must look in him and
[2:13:51] see what's promised for this age and
[2:13:53] then see it happen listen friends
[2:13:56] and I'm cozy with this this is the only
[2:13:58] way for you to please God is to obey him
[2:14:02] so you want to please God and Jesus said
[2:14:05] this if you love me keep my Commandments
[2:14:07] the only way to please God is to obey
[2:14:11] him may the Lord will she bless you this
[2:14:13] morning church and I want to challenge
[2:14:15] you obey him
[2:14:18] build back the family altar obey him
[2:14:21] dress like a Christian obey him live
[2:14:25] like a Christian obey him drop your oats

[2:14:37] everybody forgive your enemies
[2:14:40] because that's what we're supposed to do
[2:14:42] he said do good to them that hate you
[2:14:44] you'll be in that part
[2:14:46] [Music]
[2:14:50] Lord I want to obey you in everything
[2:14:53] I want to obey You by coming to church
[2:14:56] that's a that's part of obeying God I
[2:14:58] want to obey You by singing with all
[2:14:59] that I have
[2:15:01] when it's time to pray I want to pray
[2:15:02] when it's time to worship I Want To
[2:15:03] Worship
[2:15:07] anybody feels that way
[2:15:15] [Music]
[2:15:18] let's just power heads
[2:15:26] no matter what
[2:15:29] [Music]
[2:15:31] come stands
[2:15:35] no matter what
[2:15:38] the sin to wish
[2:15:50] [Music]
[2:16:01] hello
[2:16:02] [Music]
[2:16:04] Lord we love
[2:16:07] to work
[2:16:09] ship you
[2:16:13] very long
[2:16:17] hello
[2:16:18] [Music]
[2:16:21] Lord we love to wear
[2:16:28] let's just pray
[2:16:31] Lord Heavenly Father Lord you know the
[2:16:33] burden
[2:16:36] Lord knowing that time is short
[2:16:40] Lord and each of us will hear those
[2:16:43] words one day because thou has done this
[2:16:45] thing
[2:16:47] it's a choice
[2:16:49] it's a choice to obey
[2:16:52] it's also a choice to disobey
[2:16:56] Lord we read the scripture in
[2:16:57] Deuteronomy where you said you give them
[2:17:00] a blessing on this day a blessing if
[2:17:02] they obey
[2:17:04] and I curse
[2:17:06] if they disobey
[2:17:09] Lord sometimes we take for granted that
[2:17:11] we have time
[2:17:12] we take for granted that we have other
[2:17:15] chances other opportunities and Lord we
[2:17:19] when we don't hold time
[2:17:22] we assume that we'll always be able to
[2:17:25] make things right but that's not what
[2:17:27] the Bible teaches us
[2:17:29] LOL it's a judgment seat and because
[2:17:31] there's blood on the Judgment seat
[2:17:34] it's a messy seat
[2:17:37] Lord we all have fallen short
[2:17:40] Lord of full obedience
[2:17:43] Lord of
[2:17:45] taking these Commandments in your word
[2:17:48] and making it our life testimony or a
[2:17:51] walk or talk we have Lord aloud so many
[2:17:53] different things to distract us and pull
[2:17:55] us and Lord when we reflect on what's
[2:17:58] really important and what's really not
[2:18:00] important Lord we lord we see we need
[2:18:02] your help
[2:18:04] we need a fresh touch we need to Lord
[2:18:07] reconnect we need to reevaluate we need
[2:18:09] to reassess there are things that we
[2:18:10] want to leave the services day and go
[2:18:13] and do father because Lord we can't go
[2:18:15] on this way father Lord your promise are
[2:18:17] Revival your promiser lord a ceiling
[2:18:20] time a promise of manifestation time and
[2:18:22] Lord we want to be ready Lord we want to
[2:18:25] dig a valley full of ditches
[2:18:27] we want to empty out ourselves so that
[2:18:29] the Holy Ghost himself can step in to
