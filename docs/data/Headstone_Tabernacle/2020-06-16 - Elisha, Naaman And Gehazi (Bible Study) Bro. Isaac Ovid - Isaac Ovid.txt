upon our lives and father we come Lord once more to Lourdes approach your scriptures in this little time of study Lord and pray Lord when we get to have a conversation as it were we pray dear God that you would bless it you would inspire it you would open our understanding you would speak to us and lord I pray that as we go into the word father something would jump out to us that maybe we have never seen before that or we could take another look at it and true the ministering of the word father we could have a time of Prayer Lord and a time of deliverance father that we could see lives change and transform father you are a miracle working God there is nothing that you cannot do and lo we bring a sacrifice of praise tonight Lord we come tonight Lord Lord looking for something more looking for something from your word that we could climb a bit higher we could drink out of the humanistic realm and father we could see that Lord as bad as sometimes we feel things are there are people who are going through even harder times and you truly will never give us more than we can bear so may you strengthen our faith Lord as you spoke to Peter that when you said you were prayed for us that our faith would never feel our fear it would feel not me you strengthen our feet tonight Lord and Lord we want to remember especially every brother every sister law in every situation every

Mimi's request become notes of praise and if there's any that would come in during the service shooter good leaders father Lord will remember them who they go to the end of the service as well but father we pray for your people and Lord I pray your minister to us in a special way in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen and amen and amen well it's certainly a great privilege to be here tonight and as we would have indicated last week this is I guess a new order for services of the week where we have the Sunday service and I really want to appreciate those who both meted out as well as connected as we Traverse and transition into this new normal or fooling of the new normal as it were and and I believe some sunny laughs and it was a real tremendous blessing it was certainly a privilege to see those who were there and certainly to be connected to those who were not able to make it but we thank God for His grace to us and how he has kept us and he has preserved us and and to have this Tuesday night call it a study and prayer we really want to take from what we learned over the last three months and really this medium on a Tuesday night a little bit of teaching a little bit of Bible study bit a Sunday school as it will and first to look at the scripture sometime we'll be descriptive said I'm gonna be true prophets message and can I just bring some things out to you and I was short time a prayer and then tomorrow night at 8 p.m. we have our Wednesday night service and this week we would have indicated at our Friday night will let you know what we will be doing and this particular week on Friday night we'll have pre meeting as well so it's Sunday school a little bit of teaching tonight and I'm not sure how to title a Bible study but if I want to call it a text a night just for your reference we will be in second Kings five that's where we're at tonight so if you have your Bibles and you want to ride with me we'll be in second Kings five tonight and if I were to give it a little thought it is Elijah Neiman and jazzy that is what we're gonna study tonight and then have a little time of Prayer Elijah Neiman and Josie and I pray it will be a blessing to you and it's a it's a I would say it's somewhat a familiar scripture because many times we quickly reference Neiman and Elijah and he instruction to go dip seven times but like I would have said in previous meetings like these sometimes we drive so quickly that we miss certain very small things so I want to kind of take it verse by verse and just pull out a few things tonight so second Kings 5 and verse 1 now Neiman captain of the hosts of the king of Syria what a title ah there's like commander in chief now naman captain of the host of the king of Syria captain of the host eyes everything of the king of Syria was a great man with his master that's a powerful statement he's a great man with his master so it meant that his master beanie King considered him a great man treated him as a great man he was was considered a great man he's a captain so his credentials the Spy's is very powerful he's a captain he is captain with a great responsibility he is reportedly a king who considers him great and he is honorable so in Bible says he is a great man with his master and honorable because of him the Lord had given deliverance on to Syria he was also a mighty man in Vala so thus far we have a really this is it is any way to describe somebody this is how ideally I would love to be described and I think for any of us it is it is how anybody should want to be described because there is nothing negative in his resume everything is positive even by the Brenham gives credit to Nieman and his character and his behavior and what he represents him but in verse one ends with but he was a leper naman he was a captain he was great he was honorable and whenever I'm reading with ladies I want to challenge a question to all of us can people see that you agreed and people say that you are honorable can people see that you're a mighty person of Valor meaning you're fearless you Bollier believing what you believe in he is a captain he was great he was honorable he was a mighty man of Valor but he was a leper but he was quitting his peon was not as a result of being poor if you were to do deep study of the time in which he was living in and what it took to be a captain and what captain's were given and what he had it was not a peon of being poor he was hurting not from a war injury he was nothing not because of his place in society because outside of being in a royal family he was pretty much the highest he could have achieved that he could have worked to achieve he was hurting not because he was unable to achieve because to be considered great by those that are above you those that are around you and everyone it meant that he had a work ethic and an approach to doing things and he Bible says that the Lord had given deliverance on to Syria because of him but he was a leper he was hurting he was not hurting with a toothache he was not hurting with a headache he was not hurting with a back peel he wasn't written with I trouble he was hurting from an incurable disease I want you to process that for a minute an incurable disease now this is all in scripture so we want to take our time and try to get through as much of this if the Lord would work that's the night it is quite a very large chapter and I'll try to see how much of it we can get through tonight taking it very slowly he was hurting with an incurable disease because leprosy is something that we know about throughout Scripture and it was considered an incurable disease you can live with many sicknesses and love your life unaffected by the people around you there are many people who and they want young people look out there young people with HIV looking healthy healthy healthy be careful as a warning but this is this is not HIV this is not something that you could live with as a peon or sickness and keep hidden that easy this is leprosy so you have somebody who has been a great standing somebody who is hauling public around public figure but he is hurting he is hurting from a disease and before we could get to the context of holy son fools he is good to come a disease that brings shame that brings rejection that brings separation even when Jesus was on the earth he didn't even lay hands on the lepers he said go and show yourself to the priest Jesus himself didn't want to interact with the lepers because leprosy is something that is contagious this man was hurting from a disease that required that you live typically in what it was call a leper colony but somehow you where he lived his life allowed him to live away from the other lepers think about it for a minute I know many of us we haven't slowed along to really process this and in that time if you had leprosy and leprosy is almost like a flesh-eating disease here your your work body but here it is this man is considered great he's considered honorable he is a leader he has authority he has position he has rank but he has a sickness that is contagious that people run from and he is being allowed to operate he's being allowed to lead an army in so much that God will give victory because of him what kind of man is that and with a sickness that would normally have you hiding away from people you will actually be allowed to offer it this man is living with a disease that would normally bring scorn that would normally bring resentment many people I'm sure would have had situations where you walk this street and maybe they saw somebody living on a street a vagrant and they have sores on their skin something kinda comes over you when you see that on the road almost on an unconscious or subconscious level you might just pull away just a little bit because you seeing that person has an infection I've seen people on the road with open wounds such is somebody with the condition of leprosy this man is living with a disease that bring scorn that bring use them and we still in this one let's take it a little deeper this is a man who led his people to victory and when the time comes to celebrate you would not want to shake his hand it is expected that when you experience victory people would hug you pat you on the back but not this man you cannot do it because you don't want to catch what he has we're still in we still in verse one in his case his victories would come with the ever so hushed whispers don't get too close his victories would come with he ever so quiet I can take a picture with him his victories would come with be careful around him because he has a contagious incurable disease that if you catch it in would destroy your life this is a man who is living with the pain of celebrating victories all by himself but he is so successful he has such credentials of achievement in his life that he has commanded respect but he is still an outcast and for those who are younger among us who he had he would leprosy in passing and I've never really looked at it because it is found in different pieces of Scripture leprosy also known as Hansen's disease is a long-term infection and listen carefully this infection can lead to damage of the nerves respiratory tract skins and eyes this nerve damage may result in a lack of the ability to feel pain which can lead to a loss of parts of a person's extremities so you can lose your hand from repeated injuries or infection due to you not even noticing the wounds that you have an infected person may experience muscle weakness poor eyesight leprosy symptoms usually begin within a year but for some people it could take up to 20 years for it to manifest itself so you can be a silent carrier of leprosy leprosy is spread between people the spread is thought to occur through cough or contact with fluid from the nose of a person infected by leprosy so people would have been careful around this man before I go further I want to make mention tonight that there is a disease that is much worse than leprosy and I'm not talking about covert 19 I'm not talking Whitaker on a virus I'm not talking about anything else that exists um there's a disease that makes you an outcast and no matter how much you achieve in life it brings a separation it makes you an outcast it brings a separation from God and this disease is called sin and just as leprosy would have a sickening smell to it sin also has a sickening smell beneath the achievements beneath the activity beneath the cover-up there's a pin but we have good news tonight there's hope this is a Bible study huh naman would have had to make every effort I want this to think about it to hide his condition once he was out of his house he would have had to be completely covered talk about cover-up his armor was not just for physical defense it was a psychological defense it was a mental defense it was an emotional affair his public life is what is described in verse one but when we go to verse two and three it is written it is also unwritten something about his private life so let's go on O verse 2 and the Syrians had gone out by companies and brought away captive out of the Land of Israel a little Mead and she waited on Nieman's wife so we have Lehman his greatness his credentials his resume his achievements his accomplishments his pain that we just spent some minutes talking about what his leprosy would have meant and then the scripture goes on to the CM Syria and that he would have led with go on and I guess going through the streets of Israel we don't know how the war played out but there was a young girl maybe instead of her being killed something about her Cortney attention and she is brought into Nima's house to work for Nieman's wife as a servant girl and she said this is the servant girl said unto her mistress which is Nieman's wife what god my lord were with the prophets that is in Samaria for he would recover him of his leprosy said another way because when you do in Bible study you need to go now and sometimes check back how much other ways it is said to me to capture it clearly she said to her mistress what that my Lord will with the Prophet who is in Samaria he would cure him of his leprosy so I asked the question because it's about character it's about life it's about living a life in front of people it meant that Neiman's home life we spend some time talking about his public life it meant that Neiman's private life had an impact on this servant girl that she actually took an interest or a concern in to Neiman's well-being now typically the relationship between master and slave or master and servant is not the is not a typically a pleasant one more often than not there's a level of scorn or a level of I'm better than you so you can tell me anything there's there's a disconnect between masters and leaders and people who are typically perceived to be in a lower level but however Nieman lived his life impressed on a girl who didn't want to be there it was not her choice to be in the house she didn't apply for the job to be there she was a captain yet in her captivity Mammon's life and the way he lived brought a impression upon this young girl's life maybe it was Nieman coming home after a great victory and after he had in all of his defenses to deal with a public he would come home and break down because of the silent P and he was living with that he really couldn't show out there maybe this seven girls saw him trying to relate how the war was and and how normally people get trophies and accolades but he couldn't go out there and do that in that way because of his condition maybe she overheard him gasping in pain the peon that he would only saw in private because it would be weak for him to show it in public and for him to be also still be called a great man living with this kind of team but however it cleared out this young girl is moved so much that she is willing to testify about a prophet and it should say Amen she's willing to break rank so to speak because this man is a spiritual man as well you see it he has a role to play his relationship with his King was not just military and we'll see it later down his relationship with his King was with there was also a spiritual part of it so she's in a house and she breaks rank so to speak to go to Neiman's wife and said my only desire is that my master who is naman can meet this prophet my prophet there's a prophet in the land and if I could just get naman to this prophet then something had happened the Bible doesn't tell us holy conversation would pass from one to one so you've ever said she said until her mistress would God my Lord will be the prophet that is in Samaria for he would recover him of left 40 leprosy between verse 3 and verse 4 the Bible doesn't recall the conversation between Nieman and his wife so we found God that Neiman's wife had to love her husband so much to bring this news to him of what his one her servant that said so the nemeth wife obviously would have gone to her husband and say listen this sleeve here this evangelist telling me about some prophet and if you go to this prophet you could be made wool the Bible said in verse four and one went in speaking about Nieman and told his Lord speaking Abadi king saying thus and thus said the maid that is of the Land of Israel so in other words we Unversed for now everybody with me so basically this verse for seeing so Nieman went in and told his Lord the King Russ and so spoke the good from the land of Israel and the king of Syria said go now in other words I don't know how much responsibility the King took in protecting Nieman's reputation but the King jumped at the opportunity to bring healing so maybe his most trusted lawyer captain anybody with me so Gordon now we in verse four and I will send a letter to the king of Israel we are we are here in verse five now right and the king of Syria said go to which is written as is ready go now go and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel and he departed so he's immediately the Bible doesn't tell us how long Nieman is living with leprosy but obviously the hope and the opportunity and the possibility of healing is enough to motivate Nieman to leave immediately he drops everything and the King writes an immediate letter almost a letter of recommendation as it were and the king of Syria said go to go and I will send the letter unto the king of Israel and he departed and he took with him ten talents of silver and six thousand pieces of gold and ten changes of raiment so Neiman is going now with a whole set of gold a whole set of silver and ten changes of clothing which it wouldn't be no kind of half clothing it will be really good clues he going because he going on and basically tried to find healing at a price so to speak everybody with me so far verse six and he brought the letter to the king of Israel saying so this is what it contains a letter no when this letter is common to thee this is what the King wrote you think I'm a sir the king of Syria routinely king of Israel who should be Jeroboam I believe which is a hab son would have been the king at that time or jwharam jeremy a hab son was king at this time and he brought the letter to the king of Israel saying no when this letter is coming to D behold I have dear with sent name and my servant today that don't mayor's recover him of his leprosy could you imagine could you imagine somebody come to you with a letter letter say here what I send somebody here well what did a fixie leprosy problem that he have if ever says that and it came to pass when the king of vision had ready letter here and his clothes and renting a clothes is like the ultimate display of anger this is like this is he actually you know he suggested shut the rip you closed the king of Israel rent his clothes and said am i God will feel I am a my god am I good to kill and to make alive in other words you bring a case to me that I cannot handle and I'm insulted not only insulted he says am I going to kill and to make a life that this man that said unto me to recover a man of his leprosy wherefore consider I pray you and see how he seek it a quarrel against me so the King process this letter and this leper as a challenge that can lead to war in other words I send in somebody for you to fix the problem so the king said I think if I don't fix the problem this or that King would be upset so you're really trying to be it mentor you're ready time to set up a war because I set a situation to me akka handle so it's like you're stacking the odds against me all right everybody with me so I just want to read it from another translation and when they give me a visual read the letter he tore his clothes and said am I good to kill and to make alive that this man sends word to me to cure a man of his leprosy only consider so I imagine he's speaking in his Kings court or Colosseum are we trying to pick a quarrel with me pick a fight with me my cellar situation a car a castle he said no listing as if I could solve it a car solve it so obviously if I sent him back he could say I'll do it and and maybe I couldn't do it and didn't do it so you rage on a pickup fight is ready an attempt to go to war but he Bible says in verse eight and it was so when Elisha the man of God Alleluia had heard that the king of Israel had rented schools so this is no news good news headline King rents close because this is all that Elijah hood the King granted he likes all he likes a here but his story here here who come here here when you request was you don't know who t he all he know the king read his schools and that is enough to Elijah to drop what he's doing to come and ask the question why your rent your clothes and it was so when Elijah the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes that he sends to the king saying wherefore has no rent I close is your seriousness let him come no to me that he shall know that day is a prophet in Israel I love that in other words the king can handle assembly problem over to me so like I can let them know that there is a prophet in Israel glory so name one I can imagine could you imagine now because naman would be looking at this letter looking le king expression seeing maybe the king or any school or how that whole thing unplayed but no it's almost like you have hope again you hope restored you hope renewed because what look like failure and it looked like he was about to go back to Syria suddenly I get in GPS coordinates so somebody else house in Sumeria where a man named Elijah is living and you toll on go to your next destination he will take care of you so naman came with his horses and with his chariot and stood at the door of the house of Elijah now this is where it gets interesting this is a great man let me just go back again captain of the host of the king of syria great man with his master honorable mighty man and valor that is making sure we know who we talking about here all right I want to put in parallel of the Roman centurion who went against a when I see it on one go he go it when I see the one can we commit this Niemann reach in front of Elisha house and the Bible says Elisha sent a messenger unto him well naman blow a fuse gasket went engine went Nieman cannot free life of him understand the Bible says and Elijah sent a messenger unto him saying go and wash in Jordan seven times and I flesh shall come again to thee and thou shalt be clean and Neiman was wrought and went away seeing the world I thought he will surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the Lord his God and strike his hand over the police and recover the level where the Branham said it like this he said naman was supposed to dip seven times in the Jordan he said why he didn't have to do that you know it was just a symbol that the Prophet gave him to do something to do so but a grandma was typing that interchange is really an issue of discipline and obedience and that is where it began to uncover that the problem that Neiman had was not just the leprosy he had some issues taking instructions he had some issues with guidance he had some issues following following recommendations maybe he got so used to giving instructions he had a problem taking instructions somebody helped me tonight he was he said insulted that this Elisha whoever he likes sure is wouldn't even come outside and talk to me I reach in front your house you you you you you ever went took somebody host and somebody else come is a complicity person so he have a mighty man the second in command in Syria as it were reaching funny lights out and he like Shay was he inside drinking coffee he said go by the Jordan I'm going to be seven times the first issue the first issue naman has read it he was wrought and went away went away and it comes back to I wrote some questions before I approach today and I ask the same question how bad do you want deliverance because this was a test of hope how much it already meant to me money after you go through all you went to you reach that point and you are not insulted by any instruction yet the end you you are insulted by an instruction but before your easy instruction you're insulted by who give the instruction he instructed by how the instruction come here and deal with it with you with what instruction is yet here you just upset with who tell you so so the first I'll tell you something but it's not a pasta so you're done oh God I mainly remember come over there the D can tell you something and and and just II couldn't because the holy messenger is and like did brother over tell you to tell me under whose is so why and anybody with me anybody with me tonight hallelujah listen the Bible have everything you know the more I study it when people live an act as like a witness as a Niemann spirit a boy the name when I know infant we took with the deal with the elements that is near munching here so Neiman was wrought and went away he went away walked away from his healing walked away from his blessing walked away from his deliverance because he didn't like who came to speak with him and that's a deep message a deep lesson because he regardless of who was speaking to him he was being given the right message he was being given the right instruction and it underscores something very different go ahead use anybody God could use anybody but God was also dealing with Neiman and I love because brother branham said it like this he said any days of Elijah he said there were many lepers but the Bible records only one and every time I go with the script I always say when the Bible brings up an issue is a message is a teaching it's clarity for us to take notes and to learn and to ensure that we are gonna take teaching so we'd love to repeat the issues and that I hear anybody with me tonight it might sound simple but it is a deep teaching a simple team teaching Niemann was wrought he went away so I want you to picture something Neiman didn't come by himself so the people who are around him would see this interchange of a Sylvan coming out speaking to Neiman Neiman losing it children I say we go in I wonder if there were young people around me man who was seen as behavior what message was he teaching them what was he displaying to his men because everything in life is a lesson anybody with me tonight it's about discipline it's about understanding every action we take somebody is watching us and we have to understand that they are first-order consequences and second-order consequences of our actions be who I thought you see that thereby the problem be whole I thought he will surely come out to me and stand so you define it how the monocots of us operate you you know how the amount of God supposed to break ladies here behold I thought you see that spot right there woody problem sir but if I hadn't said it like this he said like all Neiman this is from the message Israel on the church like only man when a man went down to get his he likes a tool him to go down doc seven times or dip seven time oh my that hurt his prestige well number the my name if we go over and we believe this and believe that we'll have a nice shirt and treat everybody nice happy little money except he's but a man was bringing out here that people have their own idea their own thinking their own beliefs of how things should be but God was dealing now with with me and how his thinking it was up the name and he tell you holding aluminum imagine you go Mary doctor I want you I was getting imagine if every doctor and the doctor is is given you a prescription Nana died nary prescription I want to do this I mean it should be this is that is eating a comedy doctor or you want to fix yourself you company that they regret to tell you Trudy newest Trudy he decide he pharmacist whatever go and do this any like man excitatory doctor would have come and right behold I thought he will surely come out to me and stand he said yet to stand up to do you got Saddam talk about defining and this is why I appreciate but over it so much because if you listen to what everybody think you it should be in trouble enough if you don't move by revolutionary inspiration one person think you should stand up in the front somebody think you should pray me back somebody think you should put it George so somebody think you should do it this way somebody think everybody thoughts into attend thought into Totten you're tarnishing Spanish is sit ting ting ting and afterwards you spinning like a top that's the way you know what I think I he will surely come out he was convinced he will surely come out I get spending who has it even in this one wisdom I trying to get on get me an early chapter come out to me and stand and call on the name of the Lord his God is hidden Syrian defining the terms of engagement of Elijah and his good and strike his hand over the police and recovery leper so that was his first issue for this issue then he goes on so in other words to add insult to injury that that's what he seems I'm not a banner and flapper rivers of Damascus better than all the waters of Israel so not only expected he prescription to be different but if you want me to wash I know better places to wash me I'm not washing them and be clean so he turned and he went away in a rage really bad I'm said it this way except a man be born again he will in no wise enter the kingdom notice it these charitable things are fine that's not God provided we hear him keen from his own weak so but a Branham type this to people who own their own way he said Kim come his own way and many tonight are coming their own way the one the world the gospel they want church they want this ministry to be today appetite so I would obviously it's a buffet so you want to take me things that please you you cannot even reason it why reasons can't even your reasons and not eligible in other ways how you think it should be is not even eligible you're not eligible to reason it out if you can reason it it would be no more feet you've got to offer it by feet you saw no you say by the banner you mean I have to get down there and get filled with the Holy Ghost and carry on like the rest of them if you expect to be with the rest of them you do that's all yes sir you can take it Neiman had the same thing God told the Prophet tell him go down and did seven times and he said isn't this water cleaner and better but it was that water of Jordan looks pretty bad sometimes can the church say Amen I'll touch it apart a little atone and this is where I find it gets a little interesting because it's important there are many lessons here even though naman was angry he was upset he went away in Ridge he had to have such a relationship with his servants I have a friend of mine who runs a business and I have been in meetings with him and I have seen him lose it slam is Hannah new table and scream at his employees because he's looking for a certain level of service if he hears something was wrong with a customer he is furious cause he wants his customers to be happy well the amazing thing about it is he is employees of such a love for him such a respect for him he's a Christian and I had my only fact that he could have a standard and he was not compromise only service he wants to give and even though he would correct them and straighten things out there's a love that they have for him that speaks volumes to the character of leadership because you could be firm you could be in command you could command respect not because I discipline you or shout at you for doing something that's wrong doesn't mean there's not love there or that love cannot be there but it is evident from this scripture that the greatness of Neiman and the way he lived and even though he was in this condition of rage his servants still had his best interest at heart because if his servant with malicious you were to say well boss your your your day tomorrow disrespect you well let me go let me go let me just bomb to be a Zuba you know you listen you better than that do let him worry just back here and all of them when I ride out and he will I still having leprosy condition but he Bible says and his servants came near and speak unto Him and said my father they speaking with respect if the Prophet had bid me to do some great thing wouldest Dowell not have done it how much rather than when he said to thee wash and be clean and they are two sides of it only one hand it is the servants love for their master as it were but on the other hand I feel it really powerful that that can encounter almost humbled Neiman didn't listen to his servants because it was not Elijah who end up convincing Nieman to go into Jordan it was his servants who persuaded him to go to Jordan it's a powerful teaching on leadership because if you are ever in a position of leadership it takes great wisdom to understand how to deal with people who may not be on your level but also genuinely have your best interest at heart it also applies to parenting it applies to any situation where there is a disproportionate or even balance of power many time as people go up and run the ignore good ideas around them but Neiman as upset as he was and I guess his servants knew him well enough to be able to persuade him listen listen you know if this man actually do something good and he would I get recognition and respect you were to do it so what's so different about this we're ready come for where are you come to change for you ready come all this way to go back home and do the same thing you ready come all this way so just walk away and I leave with nothing I don't know how much time they would have spent trying to explain this to him but it takes great strength up because it's now known Eamonn is no humble he has to be humble because after there there are people who so want to take you road of doing it not he disrespect me then they wouldn't even come back if something good for them I leave early church I coming back and they never want to come up because that Brower never go back there and I had to go and unwind all and woods it it all back because the way me my left you were not excused of thought he would have gone and did it everybody with me we taking out what time I just go into this but his fluence so I want us to understand something no and that is why it is important I am here tonight as a servant that is how I see my role tonight because the prophet of God hallelujah sent a message out for what we supposed to do and many of us we hear what he's supposed to do but we have not done it because of pride because of what we think we know because of what we think we understand but it took servants who had a love for naman to say boss father brother leader of course we come too far to go back now let me go all you either let me go on dip now we can we come in with you become a Mitchell everyone do this thing because we are going back if this market already got here why are you going back I sell it to the young people before friends as carrier Ando bringing back these were not regular servants these were subin's with distinction servants with class service similar to the men who carried a man with palsy and carried him up the roof when Jesus was there he couldn't go himself but their love for him carried him namin had reached that far and he reached a spot that he couldn't go further so whether it's a friend to you or somebody was under your level or somebody who might guess the impasse who say keep pressing brother hold on to that keep pressing brother keep pressing system because that encouragement is priceless for you to go all the way anybody with me that tonight I'm hoping I've taken too much time alone Bible study then he went down and dipped himself we had verse 14 then when he don't and dipped himself seven times in Jordan where the Branham said I could see him walking out there by pulling his feet out of mud like a tomcat in molasses you know buddy Branham and he prophetic eyes seeing him playing in front of him you know Walker there I guess I have to do it he's speaking like it I guess I have to do it dog dong it'll hit his prestige he saying dog he come back up he still had leprosy hallelujah he prophet said seven times but after he had done seven times his skin come to him clean again hallelujah and berry man said brother I'm telling you some people say I don't believe I have to get to the altar and boohoo and cry around snot or like the rest of them do stay back there then but I'll take away with a lord despise few started towards Jesus know this verse 14 which says and then he went known and dipped himself seven times in Jordan according to the saying of the man of God and his flesh him again like unto the flesh of a little child and he was clean my god they were all battle-scarred veteran and when he did God at His Word and he think the man of God's wood and he took action on the man of God's wood as he prophesied it was something to do that he had to follow somebody Branham in friction about this brought the type of Jesus remember when Jesus had these situations he was a blind man and he takes some dust on he's spitting in Europe he said Jesus didn't have to do it was just something to do it's something to do God has a way here do things in different way means these people can't tie these seven and he could type walk and I think but I bet him saying it is simple this God is really simple it was just obedience the new word of the man of God and the word of this prophet and once he did it you get in skin like a child it is skin like a baby and the church semen and he returned the telling man of God he and all of his company and came and stood before him so now that he was screamed he now has earned the distinction of standing before him Adam god I don't know why he might have Gordon want to see him as every man a girl say see this leprosy thing ideally without telling well fix that and then ready but now the relationship has changed hallelujah powerful Villa and he returned to the man of God he and all of his company and came and stood before him and he said Behold no I know that there is no God in all the earth but in Israel hallelujah no dear for I pretty now this is where is it interesting take a blessing of thy servant no there's so much teaching in this rain so you remember he came with ten change of clothes ten nice pinstripe suits Paloma de it was ten garments it was syllable I'm cool he come with all this thing I mean he thought he was gonna pay for this thing he took me one PF is healing he saw that it was a price that he can pee he thought that that doors of course he didn't know how much the cost was so he walked with extra we go when you want to buy something you will bring enough that he could peer fit and if you do any price you need to bring more than enough just in case the guy a high price so he's feeling good about himself but this is a Gentile a heathen as it would who is no getting introduced to this new kind of love because he don't understand what is working here and he teaching that is going on here so he doing what anybody who is transactional in nature is thinking he said he said he said take a blessing of thy servant take a blessing I feel I'm good o go and if yes what's gonna look this good take a blessing but Elijah responds he said as the Lord liveth before whom I stand I will see received none he urged him to take it and Elijah refused again and naman said shall then not then I prayed he be given to thy servant two mules burden of it but I serve as well hence what order offer need a boon offering or sacrifice unto other gods but unto the Lord so I want to I want to read that in a different translation but sometimes when people read as they get a little confused right so what are you seeing here this is we are now interval 17 so when he is urging Elijah the chicken he likes with the name and said if not please let there be given to your servant to mule loads up to it so in other words he said give me something for from no one your servant will not offer burnt offering or sacrifice to any God but the Lord in this matter and he goes on in this thing the Lord played and I servant that when my master goeth into the house of Rahman so in other words he an image going to our transition he's saying listen I have duties when my master he's feeling mighty king the Syrian King God in every house of women to worship there and he leaned it on my hand and that's why that's why Mary points that when the servant girl brought up the prophet of Samaria who is Elijah it was not just a captain who was a military captain but this was the captain who would go with the King to their idol worship God so nehemiah is trying to not protect himself because he has gone through an experience that he no knows there's no good from his own words outside of the God of Israel even in this thing the Lord pardon a silver and when my master going into the house of Rahman to worship there and he leaned it on my hand in other words I am going off with him he leaning on my hand and I bought myself in the house of women when I bought on myself in the house of him and the Lord cried and I silver in this thing this is deep we can't go into all of it no but Elijah said unto him go in peace so he departed from him in a little we know this here in second Kings five is a message about uncovering things much more much more time here at understand ephemera so it's about uncovering things so you have a case of Nieman who would have been living in some level of hiding now having to come and confront what he had been hiding which was his leprosy well we have this situation now similar to the prodigal son so you have the prodigal son who leaves his home with his money and he displays what's in him and his display gets him into trouble he comes back home but his return home as it were is what brings out what was in the other brothers hat that was hiding there all along it's a type of situations that come in your life to reveal what's inside of your heart so in verse 20 but G huzi he servant of Elijah the man of God said Behold my Massa had speared him and Assyrian it not receiving at his hands that which he brought but as the Lord liveth I will run after him and take somewhat of him so here now we have a rogue officer this is Elijah make clear his position but we have a rogue officer now I wrote down proximity to spiritual leaders doesn't help your character however in my notes because you would think better parents you would think were Thomson that jay-z next to Elijah he will behave yourself this is not the beginning of Elijah's ministry he has seen enough he would know of Elijah's Ministry of the mantle and felony life so he know enough to behave himself but in his hat he also has leprosy we start with natural leprosy in this passage every reading and now is at the uncover a stench right in Elijah's house that natural leprosy opened up into the identification so to speak of spiritual leprosy look at this rogue officer but she has any servant of Elijah the man of God said behold my master had spared name and this Syrian defender he see in this Syrian itself is he trying to chuck wooden fire each other you know he's a man come with all his gold all his silver 10 costume tonight suit I love a good suit look at them suit and my my say even take a suit yeah I take a shirt yeah I think I've sucks in not receiving Ares and that which he brought but I see Lord liveth he actually to speak and include gory me corruption as he learned live it I will run after him and take somewhat of him he just won't anything so Jay has him followed after Nieman and when Nieman saw him running after him he lighted down from the chariot to meet him and said it's all well is everything cool is everything ok I see you running reckless reckless I saw you there he lied shows host something happen because I'll even enjoy a co running what what what what what can I do for you so not only is the leprosy in his hat but is a lyin thievin we get any full in full stanchion alright and he said all is well all is not well its corruption Airy heart supplying all is not well my master had sent me line number two line number one all as well first life line number two my master had sent me saying you must have didn't say Nia line I'm a tree what he said behold even now they become to me from mount ephraim to a young men of his sons of the prophets give them I pray thee a talent of silver and two cheetahs of diamonds so this way lion on top a lion not only learn a double life he's fine - boys : Suns re profits bring them up there I'm a man said be content don't take one he actual wanna he's actually a talent singular name honesty rejoicing Easterlin Reviver he still in Jubilee he said oh just take one talent he said take two towers no one's a double portion and he urged him and brung two talents of silver in two bags with two changes of garments and laid them upon two of his servants and they bare them before him these two servants is two boys that Joe has a ring on the wings and pretend to be son through three prophets no bearing managed as if it is slick this is all scripture such as he said air receive anything them boys collect it and when he came to the tower he took it he took them from their hand so when he was out of sight of pigment is when he relieved these two young actors of the gifts that they lie to get and be stored them in the house so he put it away similar to a Cohen puttin his stuff away and he led the men go and they departed we almost done but he went in and stood before his master and Elijah said unto Him whence cometh thou has he I don't always realize this because he had been lying up online a stop comes in and he said die someone went know whether I went no way you see the effect of spiritual leprosy known that he would stand this is not standing in front of a teacher and evangelist is not an apostle this is not even a prophet with inequality revival ministry this is stand in front of a major profit and the major prophet who has divine insight into the mine and his sight of God you come and lie and say I doing anything and he said unto Him which is Elijah speaking I went not mynhardt with me when the man turn again from his chariot of MIDI is it a time to receive money and to receive garments and Olivia's and vineyards and sheep and oxen and men Subin and meat servants and listen now what is on the inside and is the point I want to get to what is on the inside comes on the outside and full circle this is one of the few scriptures if any that ends with these element of what began the story the leprosy therefore of Niemann shall cleave unto thee and under thy seed for ever and he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow end of chapter powerful lesson that I want you to study it think about it ponder reflect on it he P enough a man in leadership what he was hiding his journey for deliverance and how his situation and and that is why many times people around you get blessed again deliver them and things to in people's hearts you have to be careful friends yet to be very very careful so to bring this to a close I identified four questions so to speak that I wanted to take from this teaching first critical question how desperate are you for deliverance your desperation for deliverance is directly correlated with your obedience because if you really want to be delivered you have to have a willingness to obey the Word of God subject yourself to you would have good not to your thoughts because naman was clay and how he taught it will be I told his survey should be like this I thought he Prem attention good idea I told we should have two services one any morning I told this person should preach I thought he should come and spread his hand he didn't find evenly movement Shirley come up to me and stand up calling him a lord and strike his hand over the place all of that is happening there subjecting yourself not to your thoughts not to how you think it should be but to OB these simple instruction of the Lord means a lesson number two can you take advice from people who may not be at your level powerful teaching because Neiman has to thank God for the servants around him who had his best interest at heart because like I said it was not Elijah that pushed Neiman to Jordan it was his servants who and I want us to see this now it is a parallel so to speak of the world is coming and and the Bible was very clear man of God man a good man a good man of God so the man of God spoke his servant his messenger brought it out to Elijah so it's a third naman sorry naman goes away but he company you keep can have an influence on what you do when you were you here let me see it again never went to get a word your word came to him he didn't like who preached that Sunday he liked who gave it as the money he didn't like it was a table was life but he weren't came to him he got questioned would it was the word that came to him the medium of how the world was presented to him was not to his expectation nor that he received the message the way he should have received but it is important friends the company you keep especially after hearing you would it is important accompany you keep you have to know and I would have set aside young people years ago you have to separate friends from associates they're people you are so seed with on your job we take advice many times from the wrong people we take advice from the wrong people but you have to be to take advice from the right people and it takes spiritual wisdom to understand it it takes a deep and it takes humility to do that and I thank God that naman was able to reach that spot where his servants would be ones so India talk afterwards boss you have to use your father a little more respect father or garage if the Prophet had did be do some grating who are appropriate and do something you want to do it but no you have to go and do this simple thing thing take it was that talk afterwards so what we have in here tonight is to also it's like we having a conversation to help us process the word process scripture see how it applies our normal living and beyond that when you come to church when your your-your-your see a service spend time talking about a wood many time better balancing it with their fellowship or the body service people and the holy sprit drop don't see quad is pleased when I talk about him can you change the same man point number three this is how I wrote it brother open proximity the spiritual leaders does not change your character jaha's 'i live in an elijah house and he have spiritual leprosy he has greed in his heart he is lying in his heart and the same way that Neiman may have been hiding what he had externally jaha's II would have been relatively successful hiding what he had internally until the situation came to reveal what was in his heart sadly what was in his hat as a spiritual problem and they're being manifested as a physical problem manifested externally as well and underlying all of that it's to say this has been a Branham tortoise full obedience to the entire Word of God entitles us to the token ultimately because even in the case of Johansen Elijah made clear how he wanted a treat with the matter when Neiman tried to give the gift more than once he refused it basically that instruction and and I and I say this really really clear it's one body so gone crisis he had everybody he body car do I want to do hand ship defines the structure of the organization so within the spiritual context saying he is the head of the body and that's why but Urbana will say no is a lack of revelation that brings the division because if you have a revelation of the structure and in nature of the pose everybody then saying that source of a sovereign church don't mean you're doing what you want any way you want it I'm hitting something something something some things here because there has to be a discipline to do wood there has to be a level of obedience to order and I will DSA this the message has some of the most in discipline Christians you can find message churches lack discipline they are entitled they believe because they were blessed to have access to this prophetic message they could do whatever I want and get away with it and they live you way limited I thought I thought I thought and interestingly when outed being said that way jaha's he thought he was doing the right thing you know even so much that he wanted to say as the Lord liveth and these are words that Elijah would have used as the Lord loved it this man can go without being lack of discipline if he was a disciplined servant in Elijah's house he would have told align and respect the decision that Elijah had mean I want to get that if he was a discipline if he understood when I beated a shout shout when I bid either sit sit when I built a stands done this problem he feeis was simply one of lack of discipline the more I see it and I see it trust me with any spiritual armor to be natural around this simple virus that we be showing what people have in them showing what stuff in them can the church say me anybody with me we could talk for hours on this thing enough but mighty Ziya is out of this because in the case of lehman he was brought in to discipline being brought into discipline brought him into humility and obedience to follow instructions and as a church as the people what anybody say they did only what he told him to do they only said what you want him to see they say what he said only keep still that's discipline you Han want to go this way you were you're feeling led but abandom times in the upper room people feel in lead did Peter say shut up and sit down until empower come you can't get inspired Akaya you you feel and sing ish you feelin sing as you feel impeaches you feel like place you wanna do what you wanna do because i thought that this is how it's supposed to be discipline discipline of the word obedience I'm gonna brendham said it and we are clear the token is the thing is he thing is not he teaching is not induction is that Waverly is the token has to be explained and the condition to get it token is full obedience this teaching is a teaching on obedience and it unveils the benefits of obedience and a lack of obedience in the case of name and he came into obedience in the case of jaha's II he walked out from listen you know what it is to live in the house of a major profit think about it process that visitor living in in in in a in a mayor house or a policeman host or or this is the house of a major profit in them not only that you have no this is not this is not a man who have prompted any business Canada you just have a man who came and leprosy leave healed so you know God is working and you after that still want to do your own thing you know what it meant it meant just as he didn't really ever expect with your fish you know because it meant that despite the magnitude of Elijah's ministry Joe has he still felt he no better go help us process that for a minute it meant because if you see a man he loved what in that day was an incurable disease here in front of your eyes so yeah no question the ministry you don't question he spurred us out of things but what was actually the in question was administration oh god help us tonight the question was not if Elijah should open the door for his healing the question now was I don't think he likes her maybe right call on how to administer this matter and jaha's he took upon himself authority he did not have and he paid a price for it similar to King Uzziah going into the temple when it was not his place to go into the temple presuming but around him speaks about presuming taking authority is not your authority all of this speaks to discipline and I heard a brother said in one of our our meetings this church had some tabernacle we don't take no playbook from no other Church give me the scripture give me the prophets message and in there has every key we need to do things the way God wants us to do it I cannot exhaust we talking over all on one chapter you know what chapters that have in this book you know much service we have to have to even get to this thing we cannot exhaust it and the more you spend time in you would anywhere becomes a passion for you and you recognize that all things pertaining to life and godliness is in the scripture and brother branham's ministry and his message was the same light on the scripture so we could open this book and see with clarity and that's why we're ready quotes from the Prophet so you can see here just it as well and brought the types of receiving Allah knows how to get you all he goes you can't get anywhere you want it you got think about how to get it you can get in your own way there's a way to get it there's a way to healing there's a weak but a better pitch approach to God hallelujah it's all of these things it's an approach to what a way of doing things a way of operating and the question is as I get ready to close and we just close up in prayer hope I didn't take up too much of your time but let's get excited with when you see mine or you should know that I in a groove here but the Bible is used to be your life your sauce I don't want to make these mistakes I want to be the kind of leader who I can listen to anybody and think of I civilizer boy taken you come to father and I want to be that kind of leader and we are all called to be leaders so let me copy the code to be followers for you to swim against the current abide abandon brought you have to be able to make decisions that advance your spiritual trajectory and anything here like that before but you have to take an interest in advancing your spiritual trajectory and it seemed like God wants you to make decisions to advance every area of your life so you can be a complete Christian all things but in to life and godliness so in closing mediocrity substandard half waiting do anything more you want you do we don't know if your company you're going to create just in discipline that's why I love the army and I mean say with the army of the Lord and your actual post of duty whether your post of duty is in this room your posted it is on your live stream and they have an approach to how yeah yeah yes yeah wake up on Sunday and yeah community that's plenty like sheer lying on your bed and here for you that is that is approach to God oh come on now inside your house tonight you have to have an attitude that shows you really mean business about this because if you don't mean business about God God will not mean business with you God shrewd it out there dip seven times you couldn't do it six times you couldn't do it fight that you couldn't do it three time you do it how he said to do it and watch the blessing for can we bow our heads for a word of Prayer our gracious Heavenly Father we thank you tonight Lord for these few broken up words Lord to inspire and encourage your people father and Lord this one chapter that we spend this over an hour just having a conversation as it were and Lord um no no no theologian but I take a joy in senior scriptures come to life and to see how much lessons you left for us that we don't even spend enough time because this is your love letter to us many people say they wanted me God I want to know God they want to understand God and we have relied so much on man and the ways of man and and Lord you a written true scripture just begging to be read just yes yes you have left all of who you are in the wood and Lord your son a prophet to take this written word and and bring the reveal also this word can be written it is so than written in our heart so we can live this word because on people it can't move to interact with other people but you want to interact with people you want to walk the sheets you want to have an impact on family lives you want to have an impact on our environment you want a new heaven and a new earth so I pray dear God and you would touch your people tonight and he would continue to give us understanding you would give us revelation you would open our understanding to your scriptures as it worked he will reveal yourself to us the mystery of who you are the mystery of who we are the mystery of who the devil is the traps that the enemy has tried
