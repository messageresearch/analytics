[53:17] the mighty name of Jesus Christ and the
[53:18] church says and the church says
[53:23] amen so I'd like to welcome one and all
[53:26] in the precious name of Jesus Christ if
[53:28] you have your
[53:30] Bibles would you turn with me to three
[53:33] portions of
[53:36] scripture Ecclesiastes
[53:39] 3 Ephesians
[53:41] 1 Romans
[53:53] 8 starting in Ecclesiastes 3 and in just
[53:56] one
[53:59] verse to
[54:01] everything there is a
[54:03] season and a time to every purpose under
[54:08] the heaven and let's go to Ephesians
[54:14] 1 reading from verse three
[54:26] blessed be the God and father of our
[54:29] Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us
[54:31] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[54:33] places in Christ according as he hath
[54:37] past tense chosen Us in him before the
[54:41] foundation of the world that we should
[54:43] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[54:46] love having predestinated us unto the
[54:52] adoption sorry predestin us unto the
[54:55] adoption of children
[54:59] by Jesus Christ himself according to the
[55:02] good pleasure of his will to the praise
[55:04] of the glory of his grace wherein he
[55:06] hath made us accepted in the
[55:10] Beloved in whom we have Redemption
[55:13] through his blood the Forgiveness of
[55:14] sins according to the riches of his
[55:17] grace wherein he had abounded toward us
[55:20] in all wisdom and Prudence having made
[55:22] known unto us the mystery of his will
[55:25] according according to his good pleasure
[55:28] which he had purposed in himself that in
[55:31] the dispensation of the fullness of
[55:33] times he might gather together in one
[55:35] all things in Christ both which are in
[55:38] heaven and which are on earth even in
[55:41] him in whom also we have obtained an
[55:43] inheritance being
[55:45] predestinated according to the purpose
[55:48] of him who worketh all things after the
[55:51] counsel of his own will that's so
[55:52] powerful the counsel of his own will he
[55:55] has to consult nobody is a counsel of
[55:58] his own will he is Sovereign in his
[56:01] decisions he is Sovereign in his choice
[56:03] he is cons he is Sovereign in his
[56:05] purpose he is Sovereign in his will he
[56:07] doesn't need to even know what your will
[56:08] is he doesn't need to know what anybody
[56:10] else will is oh my the purpose of him
[56:13] who worketh all things after the counsel
[56:15] of his own will he takes advice only
[56:17] from
[56:19] himself when he has to discuss you he
[56:21] discusses you with himself he doesn't
[56:24] ever need to go to an angel he don't go
[56:25] to your Pastor you to go to your father
[56:27] you to go to your mother he only talks
[56:29] to himself about
[56:31] you and he designed it that way because
[56:35] having
[56:36] predestinated so your
[56:39] destiny is according to the purpose of
[56:42] him who worketh all things after the
[56:45] counsel of his own will that we should
[56:47] be to the praise of his glory who had
[56:49] first trusted in Christ and our last
[56:51] scripture reading from uh Romans we're
[56:55] going to read from Romans 8
[56:57] very familiar scripture
[56:59] 28 but very important for us this
[57:02] morning and we know that all things work
[57:04] together for good to them that love God
[57:07] to them who are de called according to
[57:10] his purpose so I want us to understand
[57:12] that that that all things that working
[57:14] together for good is conditional there
[57:16] are two conditions that need to be
[57:19] connected to that all things so it's not
[57:21] just all things work together for good
[57:22] no no it's all things work together for
[57:25] good to them specific that love God and
[57:29] if you love God you do what you keep his
[57:31] Commandments you follow his laws you
[57:32] worship him because your love is
[57:34] something that is expressed love is an
[57:35] action word so to them who meet two
[57:38] criteria which is one to them that love
[57:41] God and to them who are called according
[57:44] to his purpose so if you are not called
[57:46] according to his purpose there's no all
[57:48] things working together for good but if
[57:50] you love God and you are called
[57:51] according to his purpose and that
[57:54] purpose is the one that is the counsel
[57:55] of his own will that he has designed it
[57:57] to be that way then you have nothing to
[57:59] worry about then your steps have been
[58:01] ordered by God and you could walk in the
[58:03] joy of the Lord even when things go
[58:05] wrong even when you make mistakes even
[58:07] when you fall down it's a purpose being
[58:09] unfolded can the church say amen for
[58:11] whom he did for no past tense he also
[58:14] did predestinate to be conformed to the
[58:16] image of his son that he might be the
[58:18] firstborn among many Brethren may the
[58:21] Lord add a blessing to the reading of
[58:23] his word you may be seated this morning
[58:25] in the the presence of the Lord trust
[58:28] everybody feeling
[58:29] fine by the grace of God it's certainly
[58:32] a great blessing to be in the house of
[58:34] the Lord I'm happy to be here this
[58:36] morning this week was a very rough week
[58:39] for me I wasn't feeling too well for the
[58:41] whole week so I'm here this morning by
[58:42] the grace of God and uh I know there are
[58:45] different viruses and bugs and
[58:46] everything going around but we thank God
[58:49] for his grace that one of these days
[58:51] this pest house will have to not be in
[58:54] use anymore because we'll take on a etal
[58:56] body that could never get sick never get
[58:58] tired never get weary but right now we
[59:00] trying to bring this pest house under
[59:02] subjection to the word and to let him
[59:04] know that there's a soul inside of this
[59:06] body that has an eternal destination
[59:08] that nothing present nothing past
[59:10] nothing to come could separate us from
[59:12] the love of God so we thank God for his
[59:14] grace we thank God for his Mercy you
[59:16] thank God for the song service this
[59:17] morning and The Time Of Worship in his
[59:19] presence hallelujah amen and we thank
[59:22] God for the service last Wednesday from
[59:24] our pastor identification evidence of
[59:28] identity and identification identifying
[59:31] that this person has been redeemed and
[59:33] it was such an interesting thought
[59:35] because he was in Miami last Sunday
[59:37] preaching and he was not here in the
[59:38] Tabernacle when I brought the little
[59:40] thought last week around the Divine
[59:42] mystery of your spiritual identity
[59:44] because if you don't know who you are
[59:46] you already can't get anything so every
[59:48] time it hear about predestination and
[59:49] for knowledge God can't for know you if
[59:51] you don't know you and who you are is
[59:53] something that is you you are an
[59:55] identity you a person
[59:56] he knows you he say there's the mystery
[59:58] of who you are before Mary was born he
[1:00:00] know Mary before Jeremiah Was Born he
[1:00:02] know Jeremiah before Moses born you know
[1:00:04] Moses before George born you know George
[1:00:06] before Anthony born you know Anthony
[1:00:07] before Isaac born you know Isaac and
[1:00:09] because of that be who he for knew he
[1:00:12] could call he could predestinate he
[1:00:14] could glorify he could he could put
[1:00:16] things in place to make sure you're born
[1:00:18] in the right family in the right house
[1:00:19] at the right time in the right season in
[1:00:22] the right environment in the right
[1:00:23] economic situation to sure that no
[1:00:26] matter what happens you find yourself in
[1:00:28] the house of God that no matter what
[1:00:30] happens that the message of the hour
[1:00:32] would find it itself in the hands of the
[1:00:34] predestinated so you couldn't be born
[1:00:36] one day earlier you couldn't be born one
[1:00:39] day later you couldn't be born Ino
[1:00:41] Martin if you were supposed to be born
[1:00:42] in Porter SP you could not have gone to
[1:00:44] the Baptist Church if it didn't bring
[1:00:46] you to the message you couldn't have oh
[1:00:48] you don't hear me this
[1:00:51] morning and through all that journey of
[1:00:54] you not even knowing who you are it just
[1:00:57] take a point of you coming to a
[1:00:59] realization of who you are and your
[1:01:01] identity to recognize that you have an
[1:01:04] inheritance as the scripture we read and
[1:01:06] Paul is repeating it over and over to
[1:01:08] whom we have obtained an inheritance can
[1:01:09] the church say
[1:01:14] Amen so with the Clarance I said last
[1:01:16] week I didn't get to finish the message
[1:01:18] so I want to kind of continue a little
[1:01:20] bit from last week and kind of drive a
[1:01:22] bit further but for a title this morning
[1:01:25] the purpose of God according to election
[1:01:29] the purpose of God according to election
[1:01:32] and for an inspiration a time for every
[1:01:35] purpose and we have read it in scripture
[1:01:37] to every purpose there's a Time attached
[1:01:40] to purpose can the church say Amen so I
[1:01:44] want to connect to this title firstly
[1:01:46] the purpose of God according to
[1:01:50] election so I want to take a few minutes
[1:01:54] just to read from Romans 9 9 if you
[1:01:57] would allow me Romans
[1:02:00] 9 we take it from verse
[1:02:04] one if the brothers in the back could
[1:02:06] help
[1:02:08] me Romans 9 and this is Paul in
[1:02:12] pain this is Paul in anguish and this is
[1:02:17] what struck my heart even in opening the
[1:02:20] service today because many times people
[1:02:23] lose the burden
[1:02:26] amen many times people lose the
[1:02:28] Zeal many times people lose the urgency
[1:02:30] of the matter many times people forget
[1:02:33] the Great Commission many time we get so
[1:02:36] comfortable and we get so relaxed and we
[1:02:38] get so used to the tradition as the
[1:02:41] custom was similar to when Joseph and
[1:02:44] Mary went down to carry Jesus and they
[1:02:46] were so caught up in the custom that
[1:02:49] they just did what they did and they
[1:02:50] left forgetting and not even realizing
[1:02:52] Jesus wasn't with them because it was
[1:02:54] the
[1:02:54] custom become a routine and many people
[1:02:57] it become a routine to them being in
[1:03:00] church or being called a Christian and
[1:03:02] it's really a tragedy when it becomes
[1:03:04] something that hits Us in the message
[1:03:06] when we should know more and have a
[1:03:07] Greater Hope a greater understanding and
[1:03:09] a greater expectation but here we find
[1:03:11] Paul in almost one of his darkest
[1:03:13] moments as it were in the letter that he
[1:03:17] writes this is Romans 9 and
[1:03:20] verse1 I say the truth in Christ I lie
[1:03:24] not my conscience also bearing me
[1:03:28] witness in the Holy
[1:03:31] Ghost that I have great heaviness and
[1:03:34] continual sorrow in my
[1:03:37] heart so Paul is saying I have a great
[1:03:40] heaviness anybody ever feel heavy here
[1:03:43] is the Apostle Paul saying I have not
[1:03:46] just heaviness but great heaviness and a
[1:03:49] continual sorrow in my heart this sorrow
[1:03:52] not going away I wake up in the morning
[1:03:54] and the sorrow is there I go to bed at
[1:03:56] night and I drift away to sleep and I'm
[1:03:58] dealing with an issue that's just it's
[1:04:00] just bothering me it's paining me it's
[1:04:02] not just a simple issue because he is
[1:04:04] adding adjectives to describe the issue
[1:04:07] so he's saying it's a great heaviness a
[1:04:10] continual sorrow in my heart verse three
[1:04:13] for I could wish that myself were a
[1:04:16] cursed from Christ for my brethren my
[1:04:20] Kinsmen according to the
[1:04:23] flesh I want to read those three verses
[1:04:26] in the Amplified so you could see a bit
[1:04:29] more of what's Happening Here this is in
[1:04:31] the Amplified I am telling the truth in
[1:04:33] Christ I am not lying my conscience
[1:04:36] testifies with me enlightened and
[1:04:39] prompted by the holy spirit that I have
[1:04:42] great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my
[1:04:45] heart Hallelujah this is a brother in
[1:04:48] pain what is he in pain for what pains
[1:04:50] us as Believers what pains us as Sons
[1:04:53] and Daughters of God
[1:04:56] verse three for if it were possible I
[1:04:58] would wish that I myself were a curse
[1:05:00] separated banished from Christ for the
[1:05:03] sake of the Salvation of my brothers my
[1:05:06] natural Kinsmen in other words he was in
[1:05:09] pain because brothers were out of
[1:05:12] position brothers who should be on fire
[1:05:15] for God will not on fire for God
[1:05:17] brothers who should
[1:05:19] be brothers who should be sighing and
[1:05:21] crying and be on the firing line or not
[1:05:23] around and and it's not something that
[1:05:25] Paul is taken
[1:05:27] lightly do you take it lightly when
[1:05:30] somebody doesn't come to church when
[1:05:31] somebody backslides when somebody Falls
[1:05:33] when somebody slips or or does it cause
[1:05:35] pain because this s and cry for the
[1:05:37] abomination in the city means it's real
[1:05:39] to us there are people who come to
[1:05:40] church with no burden you
[1:05:42] know there people who live lives without
[1:05:45] Burden Burden is connected to sacrifice
[1:05:48] and understanding that something has to
[1:05:50] happen and it it weighs heavy on you
[1:05:51] there's a there's a burden when you go
[1:05:54] back generation because this age is
[1:05:55] different but when you go back to the
[1:05:56] grandmothers and the great grandmothers
[1:05:58] they had a burden for their
[1:05:59] home a burden for prayer a burden to see
[1:06:03] Soul save a burden to take the burden
[1:06:06] and and and see souls go down to the
[1:06:08] Riverside and and and get baptized and a
[1:06:10] burden to see Parts at the altar a
[1:06:13] burden to to hold on to the horns of the
[1:06:15] Altar and cry
[1:06:22] butall Paul goes on verse four who are
[1:06:26] Israelites to whom pertain it the
[1:06:28] adoption in other words Paul is saying
[1:06:29] I'm in pain because these are brothers
[1:06:32] Israelites to whom pertain the adoption
[1:06:35] in other words brothers are out of place
[1:06:37] who adoption is their
[1:06:40] portion but they're not in their proper
[1:06:42] standing this morning and I can't sleep
[1:06:44] because of
[1:06:47] it I find myself uncomfortable because
[1:06:51] of it because they are entitled to the
[1:06:53] promise but they are not in church
[1:06:57] can I can I go on who are Israelites to
[1:07:00] whom pertained the adoption and the
[1:07:03] glory and the Covenant and the giving of
[1:07:06] the law and the service of God and the
[1:07:11] promises This Is Us standing here saying
[1:07:14] there are people who they are called to
[1:07:16] adoption they are called to the Holy
[1:07:18] Ghost they are called to Deliverance
[1:07:20] they are called to Restoration but but
[1:07:22] who's going to reach out to them who's
[1:07:25] crying in for them who's sighing for
[1:07:26] them who's pleading for them this is not
[1:07:29] information this is not intellectual
[1:07:31] this is this is there's a Road to Hell
[1:07:33] there's a road to Heaven this is there's
[1:07:35] a road to Salvation And there's a road
[1:07:37] to death this is a Road to Redemption
[1:07:39] and there's a road to destruction if you
[1:07:41] truly believe that these roads exist we
[1:07:44] should be in pain like Paul was in pain
[1:07:55] verse five whose are the fathers and of
[1:07:59] whom as concerning the flesh Christ came
[1:08:01] who is overall God blessed forever
[1:08:05] amen not as though the word of God had
[1:08:08] taken none
[1:08:09] effect for they are not all Israel which
[1:08:12] are of
[1:08:19] Israel in the
[1:08:21] Amplified I want to read it so you could
[1:08:24] see the unfolding of it here from verse
[1:08:27] four who are Israelites to whom belongs
[1:08:29] the adoption of Sons The Glory the
[1:08:32] shikina the special covenants with
[1:08:34] Abraham Moses and David the giving of
[1:08:37] the law the system of Temple worship and
[1:08:39] the original promises to them belong the
[1:08:42] Patriarchs and from them according to
[1:08:45] his natural descent came Christ the
[1:08:47] Messiah the anointed he who is exalted
[1:08:50] and supreme
[1:08:53] overall however it is not as though God
[1:08:55] God's word has failed come to nothing
[1:08:57] for not all who are descended from
[1:09:00] Israel are the true
[1:09:04] Israel they are not all children of
[1:09:06] Abraham because they are his descendants
[1:09:08] by
[1:09:09] Blood but the promise was your
[1:09:12] descendants will be named through Isaac
[1:09:13] I'm reading the in the Amplified coming
[1:09:15] back to the King James
[1:09:21] now verse eight that is they are they
[1:09:24] which are the children of the flesh they
[1:09:26] are not the children of God but the
[1:09:29] children of the promise accounted for
[1:09:31] seed and I'm looking this morning are
[1:09:33] children of the promise Hallelujah D you
[1:09:37] are not blood and born of the Jewish
[1:09:39] lineage but you are children of promise
[1:09:41] you are born from the promise you are
[1:09:43] spoken from the promise you are evidence
[1:09:46] of the promise behold let there be let
[1:09:48] there be a bride in 2024 and here stands
[1:09:51] the promise the seeds of the promise
[1:09:53] Royal seeds of Abraham
[1:09:55] Royal priest Kings in whom you are
[1:09:58] priest and kings can the church say
[1:10:01] amen
[1:10:04] hallu for This Is The Word of Promise at
[1:10:06] this time will I come and Sarah shall
[1:10:08] have a son and not only this but when
[1:10:10] Rebecca also had conceived by one even
[1:10:13] by Our Father Isaac for the children
[1:10:16] being not yet born neither having done
[1:10:20] any good or evil this is where I got a
[1:10:22] title from that the purpose of God
[1:10:25] according to election might stand not of
[1:10:29] works but of him that call it can I read
[1:10:31] that one more time Hallelujah for the
[1:10:34] children being not yet born neither
[1:10:37] having done any good or evil that the
[1:10:40] purpose of God according to election
[1:10:43] might stand not of works but of him that
[1:10:45] call it verse 11 in the Amplified and
[1:10:48] we'll get to the text hallelujah
[1:10:51] hallelujah you love the Lord this
[1:10:53] morning he's talking about the twins now
[1:10:55] right and though the Twins were not yet
[1:10:57] born and had not done anything either
[1:11:00] good or bad so that God's promise his
[1:11:02] choice his election would stand not
[1:11:05] because of Works done by either child
[1:11:08] but because of the plan of him who calls
[1:11:10] them it was said to her the older Esau
[1:11:13] will serve the younger Jacob as it is
[1:11:15] written and forever remains written
[1:11:17] Hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:11:20] Lord oh Hallelujah it is sent to her the
[1:11:23] Elder Shall Serve the Young as it is
[1:11:26] written Jacob have I loved but Esau have
[1:11:28] I hated from before they were even born
[1:11:31] from before they did even good or evil
[1:11:33] this speaks to the election of God the
[1:11:36] predestination of God the purpose of God
[1:11:39] the design of
[1:11:42] God according to election might stand in
[1:11:45] other words whatever God desires to
[1:11:47] happen is going to happen it may look
[1:11:50] messed up it may look rough it may look
[1:11:52] as if it's falling apart and when it
[1:11:54] seems as if the purpose is defeated then
[1:11:57] the purpose of God according to election
[1:12:00] stands up and say this purpose is going
[1:12:02] to happen or you don't hear me this

[1:17:24] you on Note is God have to give me the
[1:17:26] strength to preach long today I don't
[1:17:28] have the strength I hear today encourage
[1:17:30] you I told my wife this morning this
[1:17:32] will be one of them short quick messages
[1:17:33] to shake the nation because I don't feel
[1:17:35] 100% but for the little few minutes that
[1:17:38] I have strength to S this morning I know

[1:17:47] no sickness nothing will separate me
[1:17:50] from showing the devil whose side I'm on
[1:17:53] and showing God whose side I'm on Whose
[1:17:55] child am I now this morning somebody
[1:17:58] preach back to
[1:18:07] me the purpose of
[1:18:09] God according to election
[1:18:14] Hallelujah and Jonah brother Stephen
[1:18:17] Jonah didn't even know that in his
[1:18:19] backsliding ways the purpose of God
[1:18:22] according to election because God
[1:18:24] operates multiple levels so while God
[1:18:27] dealing with Jonah he also know where
[1:18:30] Jonah have to go they worship a fish
[1:18:33] God so when Jonah jump overboard and say
[1:18:36] throw me over board you know Jonah
[1:18:37] thought he was going
[1:18:42] dead Jonah say when he did Jonah we make
[1:18:46] it seem as if Jonah knew there be a fish
[1:18:49] Jonah was prepared to die you
[1:18:52] know you never thought about that
[1:18:56] Hallelujah he said throw me overboard he
[1:18:58] didn't know what going to happen next
[1:18:59] but he knew if and that's you need to
[1:19:01] this is this is a issue of today people
[1:19:04] don't want to accept
[1:19:06] responsibility Jonah was prepared to say
[1:19:08] listen the problem in this ship is
[1:19:11] me there's somebody here the problem in
[1:19:14] the church I'm not going to say
[1:19:17] it the problem in your home the problem
[1:19:21] wherever because you know why you're out
[1:19:23] of position you're not in your purpose
[1:19:26] you're not walking your election but
[1:19:28] when a father is a father in the office
[1:19:30] of a father in the house as a leader and
[1:19:33] the mother is in her position in her
[1:19:34] Purpose By election and a son is in the
[1:19:36] house of God in Purpose By election and
[1:19:39] a daughter is in and a deacon is in his
[1:19:42] position by a purpose according to
[1:19:48] election when everything is in
[1:19:50] order then God can move
[1:19:57] but that is such a powerful thing
[1:19:58] because when Jonah got out the boat he
[1:20:01] can now allow God to put him in order so
[1:20:04] if you need go get thrown overboard for
[1:20:06] God to put you in your
[1:20:08] place
[1:20:10] H because plenty of us out of place oh
[1:20:13] gosh father help me help me this
[1:20:16] morning but the George I left
[1:20:19] my you know he say should here you fast
[1:20:21] and you're out of place
[1:20:24] Hallelujah God will never bless you out
[1:20:26] of place know but the brand said perfect
[1:20:29] faith is based on your position you have
[1:20:31] to be in your position you have to be on
[1:20:33] your ground you have to be standing on
[1:20:35] something God could defend and protect
[1:20:37] and act upon which is your position once
[1:20:40] you on the Promises once you in your
[1:20:42] Turf once you're on your terrain once
[1:20:44] you're in your jurisdiction the devil
[1:20:46] have to back
[1:20:48] up but when you go off of your
[1:20:50] jurisdiction then you are the mercy of
[1:20:52] the environment
[1:20:55] anybody with me this
[1:20:57] morning and Jonah there floundering he
[1:21:00] don't know a fish already prepared I
[1:21:02] don't have the details of the fish I
[1:21:04] don't have the the the biological
[1:21:06] definition the geneological history the
[1:21:08] the epical thing the whatever the fancy
[1:21:10] words they could put to describe it all
[1:21:12] I know God do
[1:21:13] it and God could do it whatever he needs
[1:21:16] to do to put you back in position he
[1:21:18] could do
[1:21:21] it and Jonah is in the fish but bam tab
[1:21:25] say he says he said let been look
[1:21:26] towards the temple and he say whatever
[1:21:28] Direction he was looking was the temple
[1:21:31] [Applause]
[1:21:32] yes but his
[1:21:34] purpose according to election was bigger
[1:21:37] than his situation took him straight to
[1:21:40] Nineveh and here comes Jonah walking out
[1:21:42] of a fish those people say well that had
[1:21:45] to be God whatever that man say listen
[1:21:47] to
[1:21:48] him and he said repent repent repent
[1:21:52] repent repent and he fulfill purpose
[1:21:55] showing once again that purpose could
[1:21:57] never be
[1:21:58] defeated this is an encouragement is
[1:22:01] also a warning because the story could
[1:22:03] have been
[1:22:04] different technically speaking Jonah
[1:22:06] could have just go straight to Nineveh
[1:22:09] you know and the purpose would have been
[1:22:11] achieved that way he take the Hard Road
[1:22:13] plenty of us like the Hard Road brother
[1:22:15] pel we want to go through a
[1:22:20] fish you're going to take the bus
[1:22:26] but you want to be a a geologist a
[1:22:31] biologist man venturing where he don't
[1:22:33] need to venture to try to avoid the
[1:22:36] purpose but you can't avoid the purpose
[1:22:38] whatever has to happen for the purpose
[1:22:40] to be achieved will be the purpose if
[1:22:42] God's purpose is for you to go to the
[1:22:44] Rapture I don't care what you
[1:22:46] do I don't care what you do if God's
[1:22:49] purpose is you for give you to get the
[1:22:50] Holy Ghost whether it's 1 minute before
[1:22:52] the Rapture you will come running down
[1:22:54] all the way down valenia you will if
[1:22:56] have traffic you will leave your car and
[1:22:58] run because it's your time because to
[1:23:00] every purpose is a time to every purpose
[1:23:03] and your son I don't care where your son
[1:23:06] is this morning if your son is elected
[1:23:10] predestinated there's a purpose there's
[1:23:12] a time that's attached to that
[1:23:16] purpose and I'm here to declare this

[1:25:29] Jesus Christ that's right men and women
[1:25:30] it's time that we found out who you
[1:25:33] are because I'm tying purpose to your
[1:25:37] identity you can't have a purpose
[1:25:39] without an identity Joseph had a purpose
[1:25:41] it's never written there is a purpose
[1:25:43] for somebody no Joseph had a purpose
[1:25:45] Mary had a purpose David had a purpose
[1:25:47] Jesus had a purpose brother Anthony
[1:25:49] Poppa has a purpose purpose is connected
[1:25:52] to a thing a person
[1:25:55] a place so there's a purpose for
[1:25:57] Bethlehem hallu there's a purpose for
[1:26:00] this Pulpit without this Pulpit this
[1:26:01] thing would fall on to the ground
[1:26:02] there's a purpose that's attached to a
[1:26:04] thing to a person so until the person
[1:26:07] shows up the purpose has to wait for the
[1:26:09] person and the purpose is only realized
[1:26:11] when the person is there or when the
[1:26:13] thing comes into
[1:26:15] being can the church say amen that's

[1:30:22] purpose of God Hallelujah according to
[1:30:25] election the prophet was an expression
[1:30:27] of the purpose of God according to

[1:30:39] election just as every hero of the Bible
[1:30:42] just as every believer who has gone on
[1:30:44] they were the expressions in their time
[1:30:46] and season of the purpose of God
[1:30:48] according to election what about you
[1:30:50] this
[1:30:52] morning that is why death doesn't scare
[1:30:55] me death can't scare you because we
[1:30:57] understand there a purpose of God
[1:30:59] according to election some of us have to
[1:31:01] go to sleep some of us have to go before
[1:31:03] some of us have to be part of the
[1:31:04] Resurrection train some of us have to
[1:31:06] get sick because the purpose of God ACC
[1:31:08] count election have to give way for

[1:33:53] date you know he didn't tell Abraham the
[1:33:55] date Hallelujah because some of us can't

[1:34:13] there so there are dates assigned to
[1:34:14] that purpose Oh Come somebody help me
[1:34:16] preach this morning
[1:34:20] [Music]
[1:34:24] so your purpose is connected to who you
[1:34:26] are I hope this helps somebody I'm I'm
[1:34:27] actually feeling better I'm not just
[1:34:29] saying
[1:34:32] that but the Adrian are feeling a lot
[1:34:36] better and you know what happened when I
[1:34:38] said I feel better and when you said I
[1:34:39] feel better the devil in trouble we go
[1:34:41] and give him a run for your money this
[1:34:46] morning it's so much licks the enemy put
[1:34:49] over the ages because Adam never knew
[1:34:52] what sickness were but when Adam fell
[1:34:53] sickness come and we dealing with that
[1:34:54] thing all these years there will come a
[1:34:56] time when we reverse
[1:34:58] sickness but bam say right now we lay
[1:35:00] hands and pray for people but when that
[1:35:02] time come we'll command the demons
[1:35:04] command the sickness to go that's the
[1:35:06] time I'm waiting for that happens when
[1:35:08] you get into your
[1:35:11] position can the church say
[1:35:15] Amen your purpose is connected to who
[1:35:18] you are your destiny is connected to who
[1:35:20] you are your ability is connected to who
[1:35:23] you are
[1:35:24] your ability to
[1:35:26] survive to
[1:35:28] overcome don't forget who you are do not
[1:35:31] forget your identity do not forget your
[1:35:33] purpose do not forget what God called
[1:35:35] you for I did a Bible study sometime ago
[1:35:37] the queen who didn't know our purpose
[1:35:38] talking about Esther I might talk about
[1:35:40] a little bit today as well because if
[1:35:42] you understand who you are and you
[1:35:44] understand your purpose that should be
[1:35:46] enough to keep you walking a certain
[1:35:50] way can I say that one more time if you
[1:35:53] understand who you are and you
[1:35:55] understand your purpose that should be
[1:35:58] enough to keep you a certain way and we
[1:36:00] have enough lessons in scripture and
[1:36:02] through the message to speak to
[1:36:04] this Samson knew who he was you
[1:36:10] know and he knew his
[1:36:12] purpose and he made the mistake of
[1:36:14] walking away from it but he was not
[1:36:16] ignorant of
[1:36:19] it so we're dealing with two issues here
[1:36:21] people who don't know their purpose and
[1:36:22] don't know who they are
[1:36:24] and then being able to act on and live
[1:36:27] out based on who you are and what your
[1:36:29] purpose
[1:36:30] is so you grow up in the world and you
[1:36:32] don't know who you are and do purpose
[1:36:33] that's one thing but when you come into
[1:36:35] the realization of who you are and what
[1:36:37] God called you to do now it's on you to
[1:36:39] live that to act that to walk that and
[1:36:41] we have examples in scripture of those
[1:36:42] who didn't know who they were and then
[1:36:44] those who did and they still dro the
[1:36:46] wall that God allowed us to see it so we
[1:36:49] can have examples of what we're supposed
[1:36:50] to do can the church say amen amen
[1:37:01] when Jesus was being tempted and tested
[1:37:03] by the devil the devil did not ask
[1:37:04] anything about his knowledge his ability
[1:37:06] what he was capable of his question was
[1:37:08] if thou
[1:37:10] be so the first thing the devil wants to
[1:37:13] attack is who you
[1:37:14] are because who you are is wor is
[1:37:16] connected to your purpose so if if the
[1:37:19] devil could throw you off of being a son
[1:37:21] or a daughter then he don't even need
[1:37:23] need to look at your
[1:37:24] purpose because you are not
[1:37:26] acknowledging who you are because your
[1:37:28] purpose is connected to your identity so
[1:37:31] you have to first accept that you are a
[1:37:33] daughter and a son of God you have to
[1:37:35] accept the fact that this message this
[1:37:36] scripture this word and the message
[1:37:38] being the interpretation of scripture
[1:37:40] for our day the fullness every loose end
[1:37:42] tied up every mystery revealed that we
[1:37:44] could walk in the plainness of the truth
[1:37:45] because today everybody else this book
[1:37:47] is a closed
[1:37:49] book to the Pentecostals to all the
[1:37:52] Christians this book is a closed book it
[1:37:55] took a prophet to come to reveal the
[1:37:57] mysteries of this thing all the things
[1:37:59] on to serp and seed and the godhead and
[1:38:01] the Mysteries and all these things in
[1:38:03] Scripture that we now know plainly the
[1:38:06] the the the the the statue of a perfect
[1:38:08] man brotherly kindness the virtue of the
[1:38:09] age the seven Church ages all these
[1:38:11] things that are now plain to us the that
[1:38:13] we are Beyond salvation and this is
[1:38:15] about Redemption and that we not
[1:38:16] predestinated there's no scripture but
[1:38:18] predestinated to Salvation you're
[1:38:21] predestinated to adoption Hallelujah
[1:38:23] amen when I meet spiritual Pentecostals
[1:38:26] and I say okay wonderful what are you
[1:38:29] predestinated
[1:38:31] to as get silence I say read Ephesians
[1:38:36] so what is your adoption when last of
[1:38:38] Pentecost I'll preach about adoption he
[1:38:39] say you know we never talk about that so
[1:38:41] you're predestinated to something and he
[1:38:42] has never talked about
[1:38:45] it so you miss the hold and they of
[1:38:47] scratch their head and because they have
[1:38:48] no clue and that's say you are not
[1:38:50] called to Salvation that the beginning
[1:38:53] amen
[1:38:54] but give the example you find the glass
[1:38:57] you wash the glass you sanctify you put
[1:38:59] something inside of there a new element
[1:39:01] has to be
[1:39:04] introduced so you walk around in the
[1:39:06] message and that's why in the message we
[1:39:08] have Baptist in the message Methodist in
[1:39:10] the message Pentecost in the message I'm
[1:39:11] not talking about the message or know I
[1:39:14] don't happy to be I saved I in the
[1:39:15] message that is that is just your
[1:39:17] confession and in the message but we
[1:39:19] talking about going all the way to
[1:39:21] adoption to perfection
[1:39:24] all the way till is no longer your
[1:39:26] emotions and your feelings but you die
[1:39:28] out and God sending experiences to help
[1:39:30] you to die out so that his purpose
[1:39:33] according to election could
[1:39:35] [Applause]
[1:39:37] stand can the church say Amen everybody
[1:39:40] feeling
[1:39:43] fine in the message wisdom versus Faith
[1:39:46] Jesus noted by Revelation in the
[1:39:48] revelation of God's word in his own
[1:39:49] predestinated life Glory I hope that
[1:39:52] soaks plum to into your heart Jesus knew
[1:39:55] who he was Satan was wondering he know
[1:39:58] that he was a predestinated creature of
[1:40:00] God that God himself was manifested in
[1:40:03] him it wasn't him doing the work it was
[1:40:05] the father that dwelt in him and the
[1:40:08] church say Amen can the church say Amen
[1:40:10] oh Hallelujah
[1:40:15] Glory
[1:40:17] Hallelujah so purpose there a small
[1:40:19] teaching is the reason for which
[1:40:22] something is done or created or for
[1:40:23] which something
[1:40:26] exists if you don't understand purpose
[1:40:28] you abuse
[1:40:30] things you misuse things you mistreat
[1:40:33] things if you don't want any
[1:40:36] purpose sometime I saw a story some of
[1:40:39] the stories you just have to wait and
[1:40:41] see if it really sing but the principle
[1:40:42] makes sense so i' still share it you
[1:40:45] have to fact check a lot you have to
[1:40:46] fact check a lot of this
[1:40:48] St in this especially now in this AI age
[1:40:53] but I heard a story somebody give
[1:40:54] somebody some
[1:40:56] money who wasn't familiar with cash
[1:40:59] currency and they put it in a rubber
[1:41:00] band hand them the money as a gift
[1:41:03] person look at the
[1:41:04] money had a fire going in there look at
[1:41:07] the r man take the money TR it in the
[1:41:09] fire to keep warm instead to play with
[1:41:10] the rubber
[1:41:14] man because he didn't understand any
[1:41:17] purpose of what he was dealing
[1:41:20] withall this microphone if somebody
[1:41:22] never I grown before they can say this
[1:41:25] look like something good to pong Nails
[1:41:26] in
[1:41:28] know because if you don't know the
[1:41:30] purpose of a thing you will abuse it if
[1:41:33] you don't need purpose you will
[1:41:34] misinterpret the use of
[1:41:38] it and the purpose of something is by
[1:41:41] the design of the
[1:41:42] Creator if you really want to understand
[1:41:45] how something is supposed to be used
[1:41:47] you're supposed to go to the person who
[1:41:48] made it to design it for a specific
[1:41:50] purpose Hallelujah but you know us in
[1:41:52] Trinidad
[1:41:54] whenever you buy something you don't
[1:41:56] ever read the
[1:41:58] manual you actually prefer to call
[1:42:00] somebody and say how this thing does
[1:42:04] work and we consistently build on the
[1:42:08] misuse of things that were designed for
[1:42:10] a certain thing and then when somebody
[1:42:11] who is a professional or somebody who is
[1:42:13] training it uses it the proper way they
[1:42:15] recognize but wait a minute this is how
[1:42:17] it really supposed to workall because
[1:42:19] you've been misusing it all along
[1:42:21] Hallelujah can say Amen
[1:42:29] am there's nothing more
[1:42:32] inspiring than a man or a woman who
[1:42:35] knows their
[1:42:37] purpose when you go to school you go to
[1:42:40] school for a
[1:42:43] purpose and you could put purpose into
[1:42:45] primary secondary tertiary you could
[1:42:47] have different levels of
[1:42:48] purpose you the number one reason to go
[1:42:51] to school cannot be to just make friends
[1:42:53] hallelujah
[1:42:54] amen hallelujah it is said that
[1:42:57] depending on the school you go and who
[1:42:58] you might meet you might Network in the
[1:43:00] future so that could be a sub purpose a
[1:43:02] secondary purpose or a tertiary purpose
[1:43:05] but it don't matter who you know if you
[1:43:06] dumb and you fail everything I'm not
[1:43:08] trying to speak badly here but I
[1:43:10] speaking about not missing the mark of
[1:43:12] the original
[1:43:13] purpose so you just go you just you
[1:43:16] network your way through school
[1:43:18] hallelujah hallelujah all you leave
[1:43:20] after school is with friends yes
[1:43:26] am I am I am I talking to anybody so
[1:43:29] it's important to understand purpose and
[1:43:32] what is the primary so some years ago
[1:43:34] but over it said let the main thing be
[1:43:36] the main
[1:43:37] thing it is wonderful to come to church
[1:43:40] and to be part of the fellowship and
[1:43:41] these things but if you miss a change in
[1:43:43] your heart something wrong with
[1:43:46] them if your behavior not changing
[1:43:49] something wrong or
[1:43:52] noall there are people in church their
[1:43:54] knowledge have increased and it's good
[1:43:55] because you're supposed to study to show
[1:43:56] yourself approved that is fantastic
[1:43:58] that's a secondary purpose the real
[1:44:00] primary purpose is for this body and
[1:44:03] this soul and this mind to be
[1:44:04] transformed be transformed by the
[1:44:06] renewing of your mind so your thinking
[1:44:08] becomes different your walk becomes
[1:44:09] different your talk becomes
[1:44:13] different so if there a choice between
[1:44:15] more knowledge or less knowledge and
[1:44:17] have to trade less knowledge for a
[1:44:18] change of behavior I rather be less
[1:44:21] knowledge and be a better Christian than
[1:44:23] have more knowledge oh come on now no
[1:44:26] wonder but the Brandon would say I
[1:44:27] rather be wrong in Doctrine and right in
[1:44:30] spirit than right oh come on now in
[1:44:32] Doctrine and wrong in
[1:44:34] [Applause]
[1:44:36] spirit this speaks to a true
[1:44:38] understanding of
[1:44:40] [Music]
[1:44:43] purpose I heard somebody say the purpose
[1:44:45] of money is to spend
[1:44:55] is that the purpose of
[1:44:58] money so if you don't know your purpose
[1:45:01] as a
[1:45:03] Believer your purpose as a Christian
[1:45:05] your purpose as a student your purpose
[1:45:07] as a father your purpose as a mother
[1:45:10] your purpose as a husband your purpose
[1:45:12] as a
[1:45:13] wife Hallelujah because if you don't
[1:45:16] know purpose you will abuse all these
[1:45:18] [Applause]
[1:45:18] [Music]
[1:45:20] roles you will misuse the seats of
[1:45:22] authority
[1:45:26] [Music]
[1:45:27] I don't know who this is helping but I'm
[1:45:28] feeling stronger about Anthony so I
[1:45:31] drive it you know I to drive a little
[1:45:33] bit one thing we are blessed with the
[1:45:35] different gifts you have the different
[1:45:37] officers come in here and speak
[1:45:38] different things everybody have their
[1:45:39] unique way of dealing with
[1:45:42] things
[1:45:45] Hallelujah purpose there's nothing more
[1:45:47] inspiring when than somebody who's on
[1:45:49] their
[1:45:50] purpose who knows their purpose they
[1:45:52] know what they about that's it they know
[1:45:54] what they thereare to do they know what
[1:45:56] they thereare to achieve but the brandom
[1:45:58] he knew his
[1:46:00] purpose he was letting nothing stop him
[1:46:02] from his
[1:46:04] purpose and many of the Natural Things
[1:46:07] We enjoy is because people were created
[1:46:09] for a purpose to do certain
[1:46:14] things there's nothing more intimidating
[1:46:17] than a man or woman who knows their
[1:46:20] purpose and that's why when you get a re
[1:46:22] revelation of who you are in God the
[1:46:24] devil is mad he's scared because once
[1:46:27] you are on your purpose that I'm a child
[1:46:29] of the king that means I have to have a
[1:46:30] prayer life I need to forgive I need to
[1:46:32] drop my ODS I need to be I need to be in
[1:46:35] a position to pray for somebody I can't
[1:46:37] be walking around depressed the Bible
[1:46:39] say let the weak say I'm strong that's
[1:46:41] part of my purpose so I need to be I
[1:46:42] need to be fighting and contending for
[1:46:44] the faith all that is my purpose I going
[1:46:47] to work but I'm not I'm not in the
[1:46:49] culture of the workers there I'm I'm a
[1:46:50] Son of God I'm a daughter of God because
[1:46:52] because of my purpose I dress a certain
[1:46:55] way I'm not dressing to to please the
[1:46:57] workers or impress anybody no boy could
[1:47:00] talk to me no girl could talk to me
[1:47:01] nobody can carry me to effect or party
[1:47:03] because of noral purpose there's nothing
[1:47:05] more dangerous than a son or daughter of
[1:47:07] God who knows their
[1:47:11] purpose so what are you speaking on
[1:47:13] about Isaac God has a purpose that
[1:47:15] cannot be defeated but you have to have
[1:47:17] a purpose you must know your
[1:47:19] purpose understand your purpose walk in
[1:47:22] your purpose
[1:47:24] there's nothing more
[1:47:27] frustrating than a man or woman who's
[1:47:29] out of their purpose one time the comes
[1:47:32] in where you going I don't know what you
[1:47:33] want to be I don't know what you want to
[1:47:34] I don't know
[1:47:37] hallelujah
[1:47:40] hallelujah young people now they don't
[1:47:42] want to
[1:47:44] work they they like
[1:47:46] entitlement I thought it was a Trinidad
[1:47:48] thing alone but traveling around the
[1:47:50] world and thing I recognize is a
[1:47:51] worldwide phenomena
[1:47:55] people just want things the easy way
[1:47:58] they don't want to work for it even when
[1:48:00] God himself worked first day second day
[1:48:03] Third Day fourth day fifth day sixth day
[1:48:04] then he put himself to
[1:48:06] rest people just want to get they want
[1:48:08] to to to to to to reap into that's why
[1:48:11] the crime you see going on here is
[1:48:12] entitlement to
[1:48:15] know people preer I I saw a video
[1:48:17] recently of a lady got I think was in
[1:48:19] Grandy got cuff up for her bag or
[1:48:21] something I said what will possess a
[1:48:23] young man to cough a female to get a
[1:48:29] handbag what is worse is they attacking
[1:48:31] grandparents and and you watch it and
[1:48:33] I'm feeling so sick because I asking
[1:48:35] myself go when you start to have
[1:48:37] children and you see it what it just
[1:48:40] it's it's it's it's
[1:48:43] crazy and when you walk around it have
[1:48:45] signs Help Wanted worker wanted worker
[1:48:47] wanted worker wanted here there all over
[1:48:49] it have jobs in them amen
[1:48:54] amen do you know God put man on the
[1:48:56] earth to
[1:48:59] workall the first purpose was to tell
[1:49:02] you before he even had a
[1:49:09] wifeu so when say it was not so from the
[1:49:13] beginning we really gone down a road
[1:49:15] here where people don't understand and I
[1:49:17] shared it many times before in Bible
[1:49:19] studies that the root word of work and
[1:49:22] worship is the same same
[1:49:24] word so your work is your worship and
[1:49:27] the Bible goes further to say when
[1:49:29] you're working working to your boss
[1:49:31] you're looking to the Lord It's a
[1:49:33] reflection of the very purpose of God by
[1:49:37] election that he put Adam therefore to
[1:49:39] work and then he ties it into other
[1:49:41] scripture because he who is faithful in
[1:49:43] little could be faithful in much if you
[1:49:44] got to be faithful for somebody else's
[1:49:46] thing how could you be faithful for even
[1:49:48] your own thing and if you got to be
[1:49:49] faithful in the natural how could you be
[1:49:51] faithful in the spiritual that's that's
[1:49:52] all true
[1:49:54] [Applause]
[1:49:56] scripture but we bypass these
[1:50:00] things we with
[1:50:05] purpose nothing is more exhausting and
[1:50:08] tiring than a man or woman out of their
[1:50:13] purpose that's why when you're out of
[1:50:15] your purpose and and this speaks to even
[1:50:17] your spiritual walk people say well I
[1:50:19] frustrated and I L my joy and are you
[1:50:21] doing the things you supposed to do that
[1:50:23] as part of your purpose as a
[1:50:25] Believer Hallelujah because Jesus
[1:50:27] Through scripture butov read it a couple
[1:50:30] Services ago my yoke is easy my burden
[1:50:32] is light there's a yoke there's a burden
[1:50:34] but I could guarantee it's lighten on
[1:50:36] whatever you're carrying right now if
[1:50:37] you're not carrying his
[1:50:40] own because if what you have is heavy
[1:50:44] all you are heavy laden and I will give
[1:50:46] you rest his rest is an easy
[1:50:48] yoke my yoke is easy and my burden is
[1:50:51] light and he will never give you more
[1:50:53] than you can bear so if you carrying
[1:50:55] more than you could bear and you say a
[1:50:57] car bear you have to check yourself with
[1:50:58] how you're living what you're doing and
[1:50:59] if you're already doing what God want
[1:51:01] you to do because if you're in your
[1:51:02] purpose then what God gives you as the
[1:51:05] strain or dist stress for your character
[1:51:07] is by Design only to serve the purpose
[1:51:09] to bring out what he wants out of
[1:51:13] you so this is encourage you Church to
[1:51:15] find your purpose your purpose is your
[1:51:18] protection your purpose is your weapon
[1:51:21] your purpose is bigger than your
[1:51:23] problems your purpose is more powerful
[1:51:25] than any challenge you have dealt with
[1:51:27] or will ever deal with Hallelujah your
[1:51:29] real purpose your spiritual purpose the
[1:51:32] reason you exist the Reason God put you
[1:51:35] here the fullness of your purpose your
[1:51:37] purpose comes with benefits your purpose
[1:51:40] comes with access your purpose comes
[1:51:42] with oh come on now can the church say
[1:51:44] [Applause]
[1:51:47] Amen because of your purpose God is
[1:51:49] obligated to provide you with whatever
[1:51:51] you need to achieve your
[1:51:55] purpose hallelujah hallelujah God is
[1:51:58] more interested in you achieving your
[1:52:01] purpose than you could ever be
[1:52:02] Hallelujah and this is not just your
[1:52:04] spiritual purpose it's your natural and
[1:52:06] spiritual purpose God is interested in
[1:52:08] your natural and spiritual
[1:52:10] purpose God is more interested in your
[1:52:13] success than you will ever be he is more
[1:52:15] interested in your healing than you'll
[1:52:17] ever be he's more interested in what you
[1:52:19] eat every day than you will ever be can
[1:52:21] the Church Say Amen
[1:52:22] [Applause]
[1:52:27] Hallelujah when a mechanic fixes a car a
[1:52:30] good mechanic will call you you say how
[1:52:32] it working Hallelujah can the church say
[1:52:34] Amen because he doesn't just fix it and
[1:52:36] just leave it he checks up on you he say
[1:52:38] come back in a few months so I could
[1:52:40] service it and make sure it working good
[1:52:41] again because he is the mechanic on the
[1:52:44] job just so God when he put you here how
[1:52:46] you going when Adam was he coming in the
[1:52:49] cool of the evening he checking on his
[1:52:51] creation to see how his purpose is being
[1:52:54] up oh come on now can the church say
[1:52:58] Amen it is so sad that most people live
[1:53:01] without ever knowing their purpose they
[1:53:03] live their lives without meaning but
[1:53:05] thank God that this message came to us
[1:53:08] to call us to a Heavenly purpose a
[1:53:10] Divine Purpose By a revelation of Who We
[1:53:13] Are by a revelation of the Divine
[1:53:15] mystery of God
[1:53:23] when purpose is not known you could use
[1:53:25] the right thing for the wrong reason and
[1:53:27] the wrong thing for the right reason
[1:53:29] it's ignorance of purpose that drives
[1:53:32] individuals to abuse their bodies with
[1:53:35] drugs and alcohol it's ignorance of
[1:53:37] purpose that drive people to go and put
[1:53:39] tattoos on their body it's ignorance of
[1:53:41] purpose to let people waste time when
[1:53:43] you don't know your purpose you waste
[1:53:44] your time but when you know your purpose
[1:53:46] every minute is important every time
[1:53:49] with Jesus is important every service is
[1:53:51] important can the church say Amen oh
[1:53:54] Hallelujah we have a short time on this
[1:53:56] Earth if the Lord chooses to take us

[1:54:02] life how many lives did you impact how
[1:54:05] many people did you tell about Jesus how
[1:54:06] many people did you invite to church

[1:58:01] bad he he went
[1:58:02] suicidal so let's not play games there
[1:58:05] are times when you feel down when you
[1:58:06] feel low and you can't judge somebody
[1:58:08] when they feel low we need to know where
[1:58:10] to go in the word to pick ourselves up
[1:58:12] how to encourage yourself the Bible said
[1:58:14] David encouraged himself in the Lord
[1:58:16] sometime we need to do it ourselves
[1:58:17] sometimes somebody else happens to be
[1:58:18] around to say come on lift your head up
[1:58:20] it's going to get better this this two
[1:58:22] will pass this Storm Is Passing Over

[1:58:44] family don't let somebody face fool you
[1:58:47] that they not going through some stuff
[1:58:48] you
[1:58:51] know Hallelujah I preach a message about
[1:58:54] the storm finding faith in the midst of
[1:58:56] your storm and I say everybody goes
[1:58:58] through a storm you either going in
[1:59:00] through a storm you're in the storm or
[1:59:01] coming out of a storm but storm is part
[1:59:03] of life so be kind to people because you
[1:59:06] don't know what storm they're going
[1:59:09] through and not because my face looking
[1:59:12] happy don't mean beneath me brother PO

[1:59:17] and when you think that you going
[1:59:19] through something and I say you want to
[1:59:21] exchange you may not want to exchange my
[1:59:24] storm for your storm because my storm
[1:59:26] might be worse I just might be have a
[1:59:28] little more experience on on hiding
[1:59:30] storms because the Bible say keep your
[1:59:32] head up and and some of us have learned
[1:59:34] to keep our head up but don't get it
[1:59:35] twisted we deal with our storms we deal
[1:59:38] with our struggles we deal with our
[1:59:40] heartache some through the water some
[1:59:43] through the flood some through great
[1:59:45] trials but all of us all of us all of us
[1:59:48] go through the blood
[1:59:52] but it's the purpose of God according to
[1:59:55] election that keeps us standing none of
[1:59:58] us could stand on our own strength
[2:00:03] nobody we read this scripture you know
[2:00:06] hallu that scripture in Romans 9 say it
[2:00:08] wasn't even their good works before they
[2:00:11] could do good or evil you understand God
[2:00:14] loves to take
[2:00:16] credit Hallelujah God loves to take
[2:00:19] credit for your success amen
[2:00:23] that's why the Bible says acknowledge
[2:00:25] Him in all your ways and he will keep
[2:00:27] directing your path he'll direct your
[2:00:28] path because when you acknowledge Him
[2:00:30] God just feels good when you say that's
[2:00:33] my God he say That's my boy that's my
[2:00:35] God that's my boy that's my God that's
[2:00:37] my daughter that's my God that's my
[2:00:39] daughter that's my God that's my
[2:00:43] son said not by might nor by power by my
[2:00:46] spirit God wants the
[2:00:48] credit because he wants good what did
[2:00:51] God say through Jer I know the thoughts
[2:00:53] I have towards you thoughts of peace to
[2:00:56] an expected end God have no negative
[2:00:58] thoughts about you and God is not trying
[2:01:01] to punish you there's a difference
[2:01:03] between punishment and
[2:01:04] chastisement because his chastisement is
[2:01:07] as many as I love a rebuke and chasen he
[2:01:09] chastening because of love to get your
[2:01:11] behavior better he not punishing well I
[2:01:13] take away money and I take away God
[2:01:16] punish you no that's a storm to get you
[2:01:18] stronger for your promotion because the
[2:01:20] Bible says promotion will come from the
[2:01:22] East it don't come from the West it come
[2:01:23] from the Lord when the Lord ready to
[2:01:25] promote you no man could stop
[2:01:27] it nobody could stop
[2:01:30] it but your character has to be worthy
[2:01:33] of promotion because power without
[2:01:35] character is satanic and if God give you
[2:01:37] too much and see your little behavor he
[2:01:39] gave you a $2,000 raise and you acting
[2:01:40] like you have $2 million you say well
[2:01:42] hold him right there yes next raise in
[2:01:44] 22
[2:01:50] years a littleit money went from ritual
[2:01:52] to Starbucks
[2:01:53] before let me let me get started prise
[2:01:57] God hallelujah and not knocking no
[2:01:59] coffee
[2:02:00] business thank you Jesus is the behavior
[2:02:03] because some people you get him a little
[2:02:04] thing and all of a sudden is where you
[2:02:06] buy your coffee uhhuh rituals I buying
[2:02:10] Starbucks I get promoted last
[2:02:12] week
[2:02:14] Hallelujah and two little blessing two
[2:02:17] little blessing change your your whole
[2:02:18] air your whole walk and the Bible say
[2:02:20] Pride come in before the
[2:02:23] fall just right there after pride is
[2:02:25] just the
[2:02:26] fall Pride just before the fall God
[2:02:29] looking brother say for somebody the
[2:02:31] more that He blesses the more humbl they
[2:02:33] become these are listen all you fin all
[2:02:36] you know the thing you
[2:02:37] know it's not no new teaching have only
[2:02:40] know the thing the more he blessed but
[2:02:42] it's how do you find humility in
[2:02:44] blessing there's a whole message you
[2:02:46] know how do you stay
[2:02:49] humble amid the blessing because God
[2:02:51] pour in the blessing and it's a test of
[2:02:54] humility oh God help me Jesus the more
[2:02:56] he bless you where you get humbler is
[2:02:59] that a
[2:03:01] word CU you see the more he bless you
[2:03:03] with a clown the more humble you become
[2:03:05] and he want to bless you more he want
[2:03:07] you and he's with David say I want to
[2:03:09] press your cup you want to press down
[2:03:11] shaking together running over your cup
[2:03:13] running
[2:03:14] over and some of us the first little
[2:03:16] blessing we get we get pride and we get
[2:03:18] con out he say well I go on to the next
[2:03:21] one let me see if this one if I could
[2:03:22] bless this one and see if this one could
[2:03:24] get stay in humility stay in humility
[2:03:26] and what does humility look like
[2:03:28] humility looks like acknowledging God
[2:03:30] for everything you
[2:03:32] know as simple as that you know hallu
[2:03:35] hallu is the Lord who make it possible
[2:03:39] my child pastor at night school is the
[2:03:40] Lord we want say the child bright we
[2:03:42] tell the child bright and you know much
[2:03:43] work I do I tell you if you don't I was
[2:03:45] up with them know 8 hours a nightall
[2:03:51] Hallelujah the moment you find a way to
[2:03:53] slip yourself into the thing that what
[2:03:57] God don't like because he want all eting
[2:04:00] oh God help me preach this morning
[2:04:01] anybody with me I don't know why I
[2:04:04] just I don't know this helping anybody
[2:04:07] this is not no complicated deep mystery
[2:04:09] I just taking what the prophet say the
[2:04:11] Lord want to bless you but if you could
[2:04:13] get humbler in the blessing you have
[2:04:14] more blessing to get because he can
[2:04:16] trust you with more
[2:04:22] so the word your homework is to take
[2:04:24] yourself out of the acknowledgment of
[2:04:27] the
[2:04:34] activity the company say performance was
[2:04:37] good is the Lord who do it
[2:04:40] to you need to practice it we just
[2:04:42] practice talking caners practice to
[2:04:45] speak the right things because life and
[2:04:47] death is in the power of the tongue you
[2:04:49] know and don't let it be just lip
[2:04:51] service it has to be from your
[2:04:53] heart because when you begin to see that
[2:04:55] it is the Lord who is working is the
[2:04:58] Lord made it possible is the Lord put
[2:05:00] food on your table
[2:05:02] listen you walk in the
[2:05:04] hospital and see what people cannot do
[2:05:07] if you ever wonder if you have to thank
[2:05:09] God Walk a hospital floor and see who
[2:05:12] can lift the hand and who can feed
[2:05:14] themselves and tell me what you doing
[2:05:22] we like to acknowledge well a study hard
[2:05:25] and and there are people who their minds
[2:05:28] are to fade they can't remember things
[2:05:30] they strength fading and you they will
[2:05:32] my mind my mind is the Lord give you
[2:05:34] that is the Lord made it
[2:05:36] possible anybody who achieved anything
[2:05:39] the Lord made it
[2:05:43] possible and that's why God is saying
[2:05:45] you even being here today is not even by
[2:05:48] your own choosing is the Lord made it
[2:05:50] possible that's why I can be better than
[2:05:52] you you can be better than me the Lord
[2:05:54] called both of
[2:05:55] us I didn't ask to be a minister I
[2:05:58] didn't put in an
[2:06:07] application is the grace of God I just
[2:06:09] here to share something that say I don't
[2:06:10] ever see myself as any
[2:06:13] Minister but others others say
[2:06:18] it
[2:06:19] Hallelujah but I want to just encourage
[2:06:21] you that time is
[2:06:23] short and if you have been living
[2:06:25] outside of your
[2:06:27] purpose because Esther we know the story
[2:06:30] she found herself by virtue of her
[2:06:33] identity and purpose and by virtue of
[2:06:36] the family because she was an orphan and
[2:06:39] her uncle morai was gracious enough to
[2:06:41] take her in he did the best he could do
[2:06:44] and he trained her
[2:06:45] well in so much that when she stood
[2:06:48] before the King after Queen vashi was

[2:08:04] so she knows her purpose she knows her
[2:08:07] identity she know she not from the world
[2:08:10] as it were and even though she has been
[2:08:12] called into this room with these other
[2:08:14] women she doesn't let them affect her
[2:08:18] dressing she doesn't allow them to put
[2:08:20] on airing and makeup and jewelry and cut
[2:08:22] this and cut this and snip this and the
[2:08:24] hair would the only thing they say the
[2:08:27] hair wouldn't grow and and and
[2:08:29] anybody they don't want to tell
[2:08:32] me what you he addressed
[2:08:36] as the he go drop and
[2:08:42] breakage Hallelujah all these modern
[2:08:44] interpretations that he we having a time
[2:08:48] this morning Hallelujah she didn't let
[2:08:51] let none of the sisters in the room well
[2:08:53] not
[2:08:54] sisters I
[2:08:58] apologize none of the females in the
[2:09:00] room to distract
[2:09:04] her and Esther by virtue of being a
[2:09:07] virtuous woman found
[2:09:10] favor in the eyes of the king and his
[2:09:15] chosen she's recognized she's respected
[2:09:18] she's acknowledged and the anointing of
[2:09:20] her virtue speaks for her more than any
[2:09:25] clothes could do more than any saching
[2:09:28] down the runway could do more than any
[2:09:31] outfit could ever do her virtue has a
[2:09:33] pulse that a king could say that is
[2:09:36] Queen somebody help me this morning that
[2:09:39] is
[2:09:40] [Applause]
[2:09:43] Queen and we know the story but over had
[2:09:46] preaching this many times as
[2:09:49] well with hmon
[2:09:52] getting elevated to power this is a good
[2:09:54] a good example of what we were just
[2:09:55] talking about he get
[2:09:57] promoted and as he say people supposed
[2:09:59] to Bow and everybody bowing but one man
[2:10:04] right in his Spirit why morai can't
[2:10:08] bow everybody else
[2:10:11] bowing just this one man morai who morai
[2:10:14] feel he is this man
[2:10:18] morai Hallelujah and that one man right
[2:10:21] him up so
[2:10:23] much he went to the king and said listen
[2:10:25] have a people in the land not he and and
[2:10:29] do you have to understand human nature
[2:10:31] he didn't say there's a person in the
[2:10:32] land
[2:10:34] know he said there's a people in the
[2:10:36] land who don't really respect our laws
[2:10:38] our cultures they don't listen to our
[2:10:39] music they don't really associate with
[2:10:41] our thing there's a people and you see
[2:10:43] how B The Squeeze could
[2:10:47] come because he squeeze it could be just
[2:10:49] one person trigger a people
[2:10:53] in one person that fall out of favor
[2:10:56] with somebody say there's a people in
[2:10:58] the
[2:11:00] land and we should deal with them and so
[2:11:03] so forth and so forth we know the story
[2:11:05] meanwhile Esther is in the palace she is
[2:11:07] content She is safe she has
[2:11:10] favor but she is out of
[2:11:15] touchu with what's
[2:11:17] happening in the political world the
[2:11:19] religious world the economic world the
[2:11:21] natural world because what's happening
[2:11:22] is outside of her circle of conversation
[2:11:25] of influence and she has lacked the
[2:11:27] awareness so when the Bron preach
[2:11:29] message like mother events made clear by
[2:11:31] prophecy and these things he's dealing
[2:11:32] with the events that's happening around
[2:11:34] so we could be sensitive to watch Russia
[2:11:37] see what's happening with Ukraine you
[2:11:39] see what's going on with Israel and
[2:11:40] Palestine you see what's going on with
[2:11:41] the gold standard you see this day is
[2:11:42] the election in the US his election here
[2:11:44] in Trinidad next year these things are
[2:11:46] important we wouldn't spend the whole
[2:11:48] service dealing with it but the reality
[2:11:50] is the clock is ticking on the economic
[2:11:52] World on the religious World on the
[2:11:54] geopolitical scene on the military scene
[2:11:56] these things are happening the clock is
[2:11:58] ticking you might be in a position of
[2:12:00] safety and comfort because you have been
[2:12:02] living and it contending and it but it
[2:12:04] doesn't mean you're outside of the
[2:12:05] danger zone as it were and Esther had
[2:12:08] lost sight of the vision she had lost
[2:12:10] her
[2:12:13] purpose we know the
[2:12:16] story meanwhile while hmon is looking to
[2:12:20] plan to exterminate the
[2:12:23] Jews we see Paul in anguish in Romans 9
[2:12:27] we see the king getting trouble to sleep
[2:12:29] he say read me to sleep read some things
[2:12:32] that happened and let me see this going
[2:12:34] to help me fall asleep and they reading
[2:12:36] the Chronicles they reading the
[2:12:37] Chronicles and there was once that there
[2:12:39] was these two men who plan an
[2:12:41] assassination attempt against the king
[2:12:43] and Mori overheard it and Mori warn the
[2:12:45] king and and it goes on the king say
[2:12:48] wait wait wait wait wait wait what did
[2:12:50] we do for morai for saving the King's
[2:12:54] life I'm getting ready to close out I'm
[2:12:56] not going to be too much longer I left
[2:12:58] my watch
[2:13:00] time
[2:13:04] Clarence what shall we do to the man
[2:13:06] that that that that that that that that
[2:13:09] saved the King's life and what did we do
[2:13:10] he said we didn't do anything he said
[2:13:11] this C be right when I in the morning I
[2:13:13] want to deal with
[2:13:16] that call himmon hmon is my top guy he
[2:13:19] say hmon
[2:13:22] hallah if the king wants to bless
[2:13:25] somebody wants to reward somebody wants
[2:13:27] to acknowledge somebody who has going
[2:13:29] above and beyond the Call of Duty and
[2:13:31] has served the king faithfully and well
[2:13:33] and what would we do for such a
[2:13:36] man Hallelujah and hmon look around the
[2:13:40] room he say there only one person he
[2:13:41] could be talking
[2:13:42] about it's only one person you could be
[2:13:45] talking about here it had to be me yes
[2:13:47] he say he say I would want the king's
[2:13:50] horse
[2:13:51] and a robe and the ring and the bow
[2:13:55] down and every everything he have a
[2:13:58] whole listus
[2:14:00] Hallelujah I we know this
[2:14:03] story
[2:14:05] Hallelujah you say whatever you say day
[2:14:09] go and do for
[2:14:14] Mor and that's how God operates so this
[2:14:17] whole and and true script we see and I I
[2:14:20] really want us to leave here this
[2:14:22] morning with something that this gospel
[2:14:23] friends the purpose of the message is
[2:14:26] for us to change our
[2:14:28] lives our heart our Behavior the way we
[2:14:30] treat our husbands wives family
[2:14:33] neighbors Believers the world it cannot
[2:14:36] be you are God bless you Sister in
[2:14:37] church and to your neighbor your
[2:14:39] neighbor have no testimony the ne the
[2:14:42] neighbor can't be shocked you make the
[2:14:43] Raptor you
[2:14:46] know Hallelujah can I say that one more
[2:14:49] time if if you don't let your neighbor
[2:14:53] know you going into the Rapture they
[2:14:54] will put it an APB for you if you going
[2:14:58] missing your neighbor cannot be shocked
[2:15:01] that you make the
[2:15:03] Raptor because they can't believe
[2:15:05] because last week you were such a
[2:15:08] tyrant your behavior has to be
[2:15:11] consistent everywhere because your
[2:15:13] behavior is your conduct is your
[2:15:14] character is who you are
[2:15:17] 24/7 I'm not saying you when have
[2:15:19] moments when you struggle and because
[2:15:21] still figuring things out he still
[2:15:22] growing and he's still climbing the
[2:15:23] pyramid and these things but the reality
[2:15:25] as we get nearer our Behavior supposed
[2:15:27] to getting better not
[2:15:31] worse some of us going the other way we
[2:15:34] getting better as we get nearer to The
[2:15:35] Headstone our behavior and conduct which
[2:15:38] should be more
[2:15:40] Christlike our behavior in fact should
[2:15:42] invite a question from me neighbor and
[2:15:44] know you had a situation but how you
[2:15:46] manage it boy how you overcome that how
[2:15:50] you overcome and know the neighborhood
[2:15:51] because some of us in rough
[2:15:53] neighborhoods how you overcame how you
[2:15:55] maintain your sanity how you maintain
[2:15:57] your peace and though you didn't have
[2:15:58] much to eat but you made it work what I
[2:16:00] said the Lord who sustained me it's the
[2:16:03] Lord who kept me because it's the
[2:16:05] purpose of God according to election
[2:16:06] upon your life and you understand that
[2:16:08] whatever you go through is by Design
[2:16:09] because the purpose of God this is a
[2:16:11] simple bible study this morning I want
[2:16:14] to try to close up with
[2:16:15] this Esther
[2:16:18] yes get word her uncle
[2:16:23] is in sack cloth and
[2:16:27] Ashes send a message what going on with
[2:16:30] you uncle look some clothes look some
[2:16:32] food whatever you need you say I don't
[2:16:34] want that you don't know what going on
[2:16:36] our people are going to get killed and
[2:16:38] if you
[2:16:39] think that because you in the castle
[2:16:42] your life will be spared think again
[2:16:45] because per Advent it be for such a time
[2:16:48] as this you are in the position that you
[2:16:50] are
[2:16:52] in you got to do something and if you
[2:16:54] don't do something about it trust me
[2:16:57] Deliverance will come from some place
[2:16:58] else Hallelujah because God's purpose
[2:17:00] will not be defeated and nobody will
[2:17:03] wipe out this line of people here on the
[2:17:05] earth and Esther had to reconnect with
[2:17:08] her purpose and make her declaration if
[2:17:12] I
[2:17:13] perish I perish in other words if I have
[2:17:16] to
[2:17:17] die for this gospel I'm willing to do it
[2:17:21] but I'm not going to sit down here and
[2:17:22] let this thing die here you have Paul in
[2:17:25] Romans 9 saying I rather be a dead man
[2:17:27] be cut off because of what I seeing with
[2:17:30] my Bren not being in their position not
[2:17:32] all Israel is is is is is Israel I
[2:17:35] understand that but there are people who
[2:17:36] are called to the promise of adoption
[2:17:38] and Perfection and these things and
[2:17:39] somebody need to do something about it
[2:17:41] and that's what I want to encourage us
[2:17:42] this morning no matter what you're going
[2:17:44] through there's a purpose of God in the
[2:17:46] natural a purpose of God in the
[2:17:48] spiritual a purpose that ties to your
[2:17:50] family a purpose TI to your situation to
