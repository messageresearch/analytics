for the former rain and the let rain in the first month and the floor shall be full of wheat and the fetch shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten the cankerworm the caterpillar and the palm of my great army which I sent among you and then Ephesians chapter one from verse three according as he hath chosen us but I declare this one in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace when he hath made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through the blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace way near the bound to toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself may the Lord a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated so I'd like to just take your title yeah prepared ground for the harvest amen you need to have prepared ground if you're going to ever of us so that's my title prepared ground for the harvest then my subject brother although I will restore saith the Lord and then my inspiration I hear the sound of abundance of rain I hope you can hear that tonight my there's a sound of abundance of rain but although a brother over I found this coat it's in the second miracle that's a title of brother Ben's message it was speech in Toledo Ohio USA it says here let's power it Lord now the service is almost ready to begin again it's the closing night here among the lovely people so yeah I find myself at the closing meeting amongst us lovely people Wow God how did you ever bless me in such a way to bring me up and let me be able to stand and talk to such an audience of people lovely born-again Christians Oh God I just love you for it and there's no words that I can find to express my thanks that you let me meet these ministers and these people out here lovely people your people the very cream of the crop Wow so I'm addressing the cream of the crop lovely people born again people washed in the blood of Jesus Christ the people that has the same story like us why your people this is the very cream of the crop of the Earth's harvest wow that's beautiful this is your people the very cream of the crop of the Earth's harvest and right at this time the inspiration is harvest time and yes that in a crop it's the last meeting and it says yeah and not only that to me them and to know them but to have fellowship with them through the son thy son Christ Jesus and to know that I'm a fellow citizen with them an a of the same kingdom of God we journey through earth going to heaven where we'll associate together throughout ceaseless ages through aliens of time we'll be together forever not where we'll be sick again or not where we all be in buildings and have to crawl across the country to pray for each other but where there'll be no sickness there'll be no older age or there'll be no purpose and no blinds but we'll be young there forever and we'll be in the likeness what the glorious time to be he says Oh father I just feel like rising my hands up and just screaming as loud as I can to give vent to the feelings that's within me of the appreciation of all that you've done don't you feel like that you feel like screaming you feel like shouting uh you feel like giving vent to the feelings that you eat us let's work these nitwits bless this city Lord bless the people the lawmakers of the city and God granted there'll be an old-fashioned revival sweep the city Lord that these anointed ones there's something in the presence tonight these ministers of God represented here on this platform in out today in the audience Oh God charge their lines with a new vision with a new power and may they be just abundance of rain from everywhere my brother did you hear that may there be abundance of ranges from everywhere so I say tonight brother I hear the sound of abundance of rain the Prophet prayed it he was in the last meeting now he was closing out in a convention and he said the lovely people and he says Oh God he even says bless the law makers Wow it says here change give them a new vision with new power and may they just be abundance of rain from everywhere Lord coming into the churches here the prey of your sermon now and now keep us ever in your world give us great service tonight for we asked in the name that child Jesus Christ it's almost as if the Prophet was in this meeting brother so I say tonight I claim that rain now I claim that power tonight I claim that our healing power to come down in the service tonight I speak it over the audience in the name of Jesus Christ so it's up to you to receive it it's up to you to make use of it to take it and say that's mine now I'm making it my own tonight Oh hallelujah my identify maybe I must read it now before I go on brother see oh what a striking scripture this easier Anthony so I feel like brother Felton brother Isaac the burden for the people that if you haven't gone through yet the Bible says Jesus took at the last day of the feast and he stood up and said if any man thirst let him come and take of the waters of life freely so this is the last meeting you better make use of it if you didn't go free yes one more service with the Holy Spirit speaking direct to you and say change turn your life around come on we can play Church we're gonna get desperate ah this is the last meeting and if I didn't get my breakthrough Lord tonight let it be my breakthrough let this be the service where I dedicate my all I give my everything this could be their last chance brother and as a apostle was seen don't say there's so for months mm oh this is harvest time I can't promise you tomorrow I don't know about next week but I know tonight there's an opportunity that you can get right with God ah and your life can be changed and you can be turned around and the power of God can come upon you and you life will never be the same again Oh hallelujah my son listen listen to the scriptures in Proverbs 10 verse 5 he that gathereth in summer is the wise son but he that sleepeth in others is the Sun that causes shame Wow so I'm saying this before I'm starting to preach don't sleep in the time of the harvest if you must heed us all these six meetings well yes the last meeting number seven if you were sleeping well wake up tonight today I'm not gonna bring my father's shame I'm not gonna let his name be dragged through the pasture I'm not gonna be a wise son tonight huh and don't bring him shame say Lord I'm waking up and listen the seven thunders wakes us up anyhow so you ought to be awake you can't be sleeping in the time of hours so if you have you wanna make this opportunity tonight well make it tonight brother sister because if you sleep in in the time of the hours you bringing shame on the father sure oh my goodness [Applause] so you better be on fire tonight you better your life must be changed man we can't come in here after year convention the convention we go back the same you must say you know what I wrote somewhere there I don't know what the level of your expectation coming to this meetings my level is very high brother I came here and if you read the Bible it says there in Matthew 13 that the seed was sown probably oh there's something laying right there Isaac he said they in Matthew 13 that the seed that fell on good ground listen now Matthew 30 Jesus his son brought and refer some brought 60 and some 30 but that's all in the good grant so how come there's a different levels from the good ground there was different levels so it depends on your expectancy what did you come for you tonight for 3464 I came for a hundredfold brother hallelujah I came for a hundred four I refuse the tea I refuse 60 100 is God brother the secret is out the court 60 is in the court but hundred is the only of Holies there's a kind of glory brother so we're not settling for less don't let the devil let you settle for Less this more God there's more power this morning cleaner this more glad to receive brother hallelujah I've River knowing on that one man I didn't know if I'm a saint but the Holy Spirit laid it on my heart brother Pinker so don't settle for 30 now I'm not even speaking about the deli of the stony thorny in the Rockies I'm speaking about the good ground and three different stages go read it and in Matthew Christ counts from the top down he says wonderful 60/40 Matthew takes you the different way but we preach most of the time from Matthew 30 so it depends what your level of expectancy because you get what you expect so if you came here just to criticize you get enough to criticize if you come here just to be in the convention that's only thirty percent if you come here just well to show your face and to let the pastors know I'm here that's sixty percent but if you came here and as I'm not leaving not until you give me the Holy Spirit I'm not leaving now No till you fill me with your power that's 100% brother you see God deals in the hundred phones hallelujah my I always wondered how could the same ground reduce threefold so that's why I say tonight don't sleep in the time of hours if you're sleeping by now you should be what the ministers priests men brother I tell you this was dynamically this was powerful it should make you go home so enthused that I'm gonna serve God better I'm gonna be on fire I'm gonna be a laborer I'm gonna be a worker God needs more lateness so I'm going there back home I'm not just gonna sit back there and watch things no pastor what can I do Isaac what can I do brother Peter where can I help I wanna be a laborer hallelujah and the labor doesn't mean preaching hallelujah it means plain it means lame before God it means calling upon the name of Jesus praying for the shepherds playing for them ah that's what it means brother a laborer doesn't mean preaching come on we settle in 400 for tonight we know 130 we do 160 we want hundredfold hallelujah my my my my my my so I don't know what what's your level of expectancy in the speakings but brother for myself I came brother Theo to put my shoulder to the wheel and knowing the burden we have and we yet to pull that last sheep we have to say come on young person you can make it man this is our story you heard brother Paso truth this morning the story of our lives story of us and while he was preaching now I always remember the quote where brother says when you spell Jesus its Jes and us so us is in Jesus hallelujah us is in Jesus man you name us us our stories in Jesus so are you afraid man show that devil on whose side you are Jesus Jesus brother says Jesus eternal salvation for us hallelujah Oh provide enough I'm gonna preach tonight man come on hallelujah so I don't know what your level of expectation is so god bless you you may be seated so he says Ian works his faith express the Word of God is a seed and must listen the Word of God is the seed and must save the ground prepared before him if he is sowed seed just floated out there on the ground it would do no good the birds would pick it up you throw it among the Fussell's and phones to choke pretty soon Jesus parable said so the ground has to be made very first so God is sovereign grace prepares the heart first he prepared you listen before the foundation of the world you received him in this age what he prepared you before the foundation world to receive him in this age so there's no way you can escape you can be running you can be arrogant you can be indifferent but God is on your track brother if you're naming you and his thoughts well you're gonna come brother you gonna comment because God is in the Sovereign Grace she says here prepares our first he prepared you before the foundation world to receive him in this age he foreknew you by his foreknowledge and no danger to eternal life he knew you therefore he prepared you the reason you you staggered out of these things and staggered into what you have now it was God leading you to the place where he had ordained for you to be if this if this ground isn't prepared before him it can't grow so God didn't prepare you now the day you got saved the day you came into the mess you know you were prepared way before the foundation of the world you better listen to me tonight so that you can see where you stand and your position and what he's speaking to you and what is calling you why do I feel so conflicted why does the Holy Spirit condemn me because your name is on the book Oh [Applause] hallelujah you in God's mind brother his brother always said the ground was prepared and put before the foundation of the world for the seed he prepared you and ordained you to receive him in in this age you can't help it that is why you can't get away from him his sovereign grace prepare your heart to receive the promised word for this age that's the reason you staggered from this and from that and out of those things that could not satisfy your soul until you came into the message of the hour hallelujah until you came into this message something satisfied you brother Alleluia your soul until you came into the message you knew it was right prepared ground from the foundation of the world without you there is no harvest can I say that again without you there's no harvest brother Peter so your name is on the book come on man don't keep up the harvest come and give your life to Christ can we get right with God because without you there's no harvest [Applause] my so without you there's no harvest he says yeah question answers he says when in God's own mind he foresaw a sentry destinated us by his foreknowledge before the foundation of the world oh brother if that wouldn't make the church get up and run through the aisles listen brew Blenheim listen to the Prophet getting excited the first quote also he said I feel like screaming to give vent yeah he says man it should make us wanna get up and run through the aisles think of it you are born again before the foundation of the world God puts your name on the Lamb's Book of Life and Christ died send the Holy Ghost here to call you to eternal life you have received these he senior you are there to the day of redemption he says hallelujah it should make us run through the aisles brother it should make us shout it should make us pains it should make us excited I should make us give our lives to Christ we must be excited man we must have something to the choice over hallelujah if the Prophet felt that way why can't we do it come on every no place demon we find you tonight rain we're gonna worship God we want God to be worshiping God loves to be worship he dwells in the praises of his people when he's worship brother that's the time he comes down brother Solomon when the people reach out when they forget who they are when they doubt to themselves and to know that your name is on the book bass solo that's something man he said if you make us run through lives shouting jump racecard forget these next to you come on get beside yourself give him a shout give him priests mm brother poor Amy brother Lu Amy Bella cosmos the Solomon but Isaac Amen with Anthony of the Moses come on hallelujah my my my my hallelujah The Devil's in trouble tonight brother I tell you Satan is in trouble that sickness is gonna leave your body you're gonna be change you're going to be born again you're going back a different person brother you're not settling for just 54 you're not settling for 64 we want a hundredfold God loves wonderful [Applause] amen he says he'll leave the 99 and he goes after the one you know why he goes after one because the hundred fold is not complete that's why he goes after them God wonderful brother he leaves the 99 gets have carries a sheep back because he wants his home to be full so your level of expectancy tonight must be a hundredfold brother [Applause] so he died send the holy go she had to call you to your eternal life so you always eternal the story of your book didn't start here way before the foundation of the world hallelujah the Holy Spirit follows the blood all the way from the book of redemption he says he and see the seed of discrepancy he said the seed of God the Word of God Jesus said in a certain place that the word is a seat and the very seed will bring forth of its kind now I like what but all who said because I was going to say the seed is the power to transform itself so the Laurel Isaac lays in the sea so in you is the seed how you gonna get away from God it has a power to transform itself hallelujah I might not know how to praise him I might not know how to do but somehow something changes me I forget my status I forget all Who I am after what family I come now why the Holy Ghost the seed in the soul is quickened by the Holy Spirit [Applause] and just four into the second brother Isaac I checked up and I got into there it will take too much time to read all the quotes I when they go look where brother Brandon speaks of thirty and sixty I couldn't find it everytime he prays he says 104 I couldn't find it maybe if you study a bit more but the short time I had I couldn't find no way where he speaks of thirty or sixty every time the prophet in is like sixty quotes it's hundred under four so you see we don't live in the outer court only some people came there and they live there for twenty years they didn't move on some manage to get to the 60% the outer court and they came there for twenty years but listen man I want to tell you a secret did you know there's another Court the Holy of Holies that's where the presence of God dwells that's where the Shekinah glory they say there's no light there but there's only one light and that's a pearl of fire that hangs between the cherubims and they say listen up that place is so small it only has place for one so you can't take your neighbor in you can't take your friend or your buddy you go alone into the Holy of Holies God deals with individuals he don't deal with a group of people today in this convention he's speaking to individuals and they say the Holy of Holies was so small it was only enough for one man which talk only the pure fire Peter but you find people that's 20 years in the message to living in outer coat coming to church paying their ties being in service that's all they have and the 64 maybe go to the outer court you know they but more desperate but it's still not under 4 you need to get to the Shekinah glory because when you eat in the presence of God a dead Rock abroad you speak of harvest there was harvest right in the Shekinah glory a dead stick came to life overnight it parted in blossom and it bloomed overnight there was a harvest right you see why you're not coming to have us because she's selling out the court get into the inner court with the presence of Gladys and your life will blossom out brother bloom bring forth blossoms fruit almonds sheep eat that brother when he cut in the presence of God so please don't settle for less tell God now tell him now why don't you see today before you come in the pray line say Lord if you heal me brother brain would always ask the people if God heals you why do you want healing what you're gonna do after that do you go back to your old ways or do you say Lord if you hear me I'm gonna serve you I'm gonna change my life so you must tell God that now or didn't you're gonna see why it's needed to tell him so the word is the seed and every seed will bring forth of its kind now if the Christian the children of God the children of the kingdom has become the seed of God then they must be the Word of God the Word of God manifested in the age that they are living in for the promised seed of that age God gave his word at the beginning and each age had exceed its time and his promises so in this this last age harvest time seed time promises oh brother oh you can escape a scene is given time tonight this time and there's promises for this age that's why we so easy for us to prophesy over you from the words of Malachi fall we take that promise I'm a prophesy over you what malachi for said what he revealed there'll be a harvest time they'll beat he says may something be done tonight that were quicken that life Lord to a realization of the message of the end time in which we are living so each age headed seed its time in its promises okay seed of discrepancy now we live through Luther's age Wesley says Methodist age all down through the ages and the Pentecostal agent each age is given a promise of the word and the people of that age that manifests that promise word is the seed of that age during in that swimming Luther was the scene of his age Wesley was the scene of his age the Pentecostals was the scene of the age what about our age what about these people that year brother then they've been they are the seed of God and they fulfill the promise of the stea and they become the seed of God take that Satan ah this people you can't touch them in you can't have them they are the children of God they the seed of God they come from God and they're going back to God I love them rising I said about myself you say for you according to what Jesus said yeah they are the children of the kingdom that's right the manifestation of the Holy Spirit operating through the children is those seed of the kingdom at that age so the Holy Spirit operating through you is that makes you the children is the seed of the kingdom of that age so there's no other ages after that I don't know if any other age but I know about this age so that's why I'm preaching now and that's why I feel the way I feel now because I don't know I can't promise you another age I don't know about tomorrow there's Los Angeles shaky look how quick that came brother the old one was sleeping and yet God just said the earthquake and shook them brother and when they thought it's all over he said the bigger 17.1 brother and after that more and more and promises one day she's gonna copy the ocean now that is happening so suddenly how suddenly won't they come to you and me so tonight I feel the presence of God speaking to you tonight say come my child I love you Mina suddenly you come to you man my the people that manifests the word is received for their age and the seed will bring forth a novice must bring forth hours the Holy Spirit operating through his children is the seed of the kingdom she is the literal spoken word see pride right brother cause of the seed of the age is to manifest the promise would of the age so you don't just here by the way just living and going to work coming back no you here to manifest something the people want to see God again how they're gonna see God again my Susanna and time evangelism by these messages witnesses we see we find out the what crop we are in so he speaking of two crops here look what crop you in this morning look what crop we why he said on this side these signs will be following them that believe they'll be mocked scoffed and like the days of Noah they will come this other group back here making fun of them heady highminded having a form of godliness denying the very thing that you are professing so you can see what crop you in see these through messengers of today Jesus foretold that would be Satan with his message so there's two groups in the time of ours so you must see which group you are Oprah I know where I am I don't know about you but where I am and way this manner that's what I'm identified with them I'm identified with them because they know where I was group they're in hallelujah it says here Satan with this mess and his messengers would have this going it says yeah and Christ now his messenger would have this going these signs shall follow them that believe see Satan's messengers will be having a form of godliness his messengers which we have this and then he comes back to Christ his messengers would have these signs taking up serpent drinking deadly things casting out Devils laying hands upon the second that's what we're gonna do tonight that's what this group is gonna do that's why you were raised that brother for this time for a time as this lay hands on the sick receiving the paps from the Holy Ghost signs and wonders now we in one of the crops and we at the end time so when it comes to in time like brother Ola was explaining and so did brother overt in the different ministers that anytime is harvest time so when he says here with the end time we in the harvest time so you in one of these crops criticizing and scoffing or believe in the promise with the signs and wonders falling Satan crop bring sickness and disease but God's crop is commissioned to cast out Devils they ain't on the sick been baptized with the Holy Ghost and that's what we come to do tonight is to cast out demons that's why I feel the way I feel brother is because we're gonna cast out demons and you know what brother says the preaching of the word cast out demon so by the time when you come you only receive your promise but you already free what made you free brother him the Word of God my my I wrote you a maniac listen you remember the man that came up some maniac but the Peter and he was gonna take brother branham apart and I met one of the ministers that was in that service brother Theo he told me first and news he says there was about three hundred ministers here and they were falling over one another champion of the platform and their prophets today and then the police came after the man they were arresting he said no this is not a natural better this is spiritual he challenged the Spirit of God oh man we had a prophet man we had an example seed man hey son of God seed will produce Son of God seed come on that's how story what Peter and we must have what Paul had we must have what brother brethren we must have [Applause] so the mania came up and the police wanted to less is a province is no leaving it's not the natural better he defied the Spirit of God and then the police backed off and he came up and brother man you know the story said all of a sudden you come that lost spirit and he looked at the man and he said this is some mother son some little girl steady but he says because she challenged the Spirit of God you see that was the difference there that's what David had against the the against Goliath how can he defy the armies of the Living God brother you don't speak against the Church of God I don't get what condition they are they are the armies of the Living God [Applause] so brother misses as he came up he could feel his put in his face and the man came up to him and he says because you defied the Spirit of God tonight you fall across my feet he says any fell vain now what's this oh we serve a mighty Godman he says right here there was people in cots stretches wheelchairs he says and when those demons saw their main demon Lane he says they jumped out to those people and that people come up and they got healed come on come on come on man we serve the same God we serve the same car brother Johnny we serve the same card man we serve the same God he said what happened when they saw the chief demon being defeated he says all the in peace they got out to the people and they got healed just jumping up without even being prayed for you speak of faith you speak of a story brother that's how story that's what we coming back to that's what we want that's what we're looking for he's what brother Branham and son of God mass-produced son of god seeds you remember his sling but Paul he just came in he shook it off in the fire tonight I want to say the fire is here if a snake is but then you shake it off tonight shake it off in the fire shake it off in the Holy Ghost shake it off tonight son of God seed producer Son of God seed [Applause] my so when those god when those in peace or the major demon brother I can see ain't from the dead this weekend brother the major demon ran for his life and they in pieces all the Hyneman because there's a people in the land who under the messenger will become the final voice to the final age they become God's mouthpiece they speak for God God is in them hallelujah God is in you God is in you that's what harvest time is is to let you know that God is in you [Applause] come on praise God man if you seek praise him tonight you'll feel the difference you'll see the difference and Isaac can you imagine the impediments running for their lives they came out to the people said I know chief demon is Linea lights out it's not the spirits not the natural fight it's a spiritual fight that we are busy with brother we fighting against demons we fighting against devils and every demon we will conquer in the name of Jesus Christ we will conquer we will have over end of him brother [Applause] and mine he says the Roman caterpillar he says here in the restoration of the pride tree the Roman caterpillar started eating on that dry tree and it took it all the way no brother Ola on what you preach on the story of us the miracle wasn't so much that he could change five loaves to fish and feed 5000 how could people follow him for three days what was he telling him what was he telling them that they forgot they must go home they followed him so he sorry brother my man he must have been just just auditioning out and giving it and the Bible says this man says then the the miracles not so much the fish in the brain but out in three days they were hanging on his words it's because of the story he told oh when I feel a presence here ready I don't know how much get on with the quotes on my side just go by inspiration whatever he drops in my heart

brother because there's life inside you can't stop life you can hide these people from the presence brother they got life in their mouth let's see this power to transform itself and if they can't come up they grow on the side and they come out brother you'll come out anyhow brother and ok what's lean on you what your circumstances what you under brother you are coming forth because this life he knew hallelujah man when I look at your faces man hallelujah gives me courage to know that this lovely bunch of born-again people has got life in name brother and God give me the privilege brother deli to preach to them to have ministers like yous brother over hallelujah main to share the spoon put God is going to restore the second seat pride back to the first like what Peter head we must have what brother branham and we must have you know you can make all sort of claims I'm this I'm that and that but show me your works Stephen said man Jesus you crucified Him but he was a man approved of God with one signs in oneness Jesus said if you can't believe me believe my works show me your works then I'll believe you man but don't say you am that then you have that then you have that but you got nothing to show me if you have one brother branham F speakers corner speaker machine Lama speak to the blinded eyes then say no you got something brother you see brother branham brother Peter was the Silver Dollar brother oh look it takes a hundred pennies to make a silver dollar and they still not the Silver Dollar they only play nice with let me leave that God is going to restore the second sheep right back to the first she will be exactly like the first church was with every attempt of blessing flowing through her the full manifestation of Christ in the church they will be the self same person same signs same oneness same Americas same ministry same in every wait okay so yeah I come to this quote spoken word its original see see now I have been so samus of the kind of see that I now yeah you don't say so plant it for the body there's a big difference between sowing and planting Provinces planted for the body the rain is gonna fall pretty soon I mean the real rain and it's gonna have seen too fond I hope you see do you understand how congregation says Amen it will be the Living Word that's what we're looking for brother overt that's what we're looking for brother Olu the living word brother Peter not just word word word word word we want to see the spirit with the word brother that's what brother Branham and that's what Peter them had on the day of Pentecost they had spirit and word together it says here it will be the living word as it was at the beginning the spoken word of God have his power for it's in him in his own body work in his own way look to the promises that God gave this body now we come into something we come into Mount Zion and Mount Zion is showdown showdown whose pride in was not bright whose seed in who was not seeded promises those two vines intertwine the branches even they grow together provinces they rejoice by the same rain you ain't seen nothing yet you think you've seen jealousy you watch when the dynamics is poured out brother they rejoice just as much as you rejoice because they're also waiting for the rain but there's a different life in you you got a different image in you and I check the with zealous it means fervent ardent fanatical passionate impression the default devoted committed dedicated hardcore enthusiastic eager key over key my god so mean I can be fanatical he says here Kevin vigorous energetic intense fears a zealous worker that's what it means propose the one sellers of the kind of seed that he planted for the body he knew the real rain is coming and it has to have seed to fall on and he said I hope I'd love to see it it was so close he said I can almost feel it he was hoping it happens in his day but God didn't allow him to happen in his day so I mean what he had was in the fullness the fullness comes now at harvest time he's off the scene oh but there's another people in the land Oh why who under their messenger becomes the final voice to the final age they will speak for God and they will be God's mouth the real kick coming and you see the SFC I hope I love to see it is it so close I almost can feel it look at the promises God gave this body now if you go to Matthew 13 the parable of the sower I already explained today and I'm not speaking of thorny and Rockies and and I speaking of the good ground that healed the three phases of fruit imagine if it's a good ground it should have been all under this am i right but how come he made a difference go really day and you I couldn't find a quote where Bluebell speaks about the thirty fold every time he prays he said Lord wonderful I went through all the quotes maybe someone will find it I don't know but every time he speaks of that Matthew 30 he says lord give us wonderful and tonight that's what I'm looking for hundredfold I'm not settling for Less brother Liu if he is that's your level of expectancy that's up to you but I came for a hundredfold now promises there is a difference between sowing and planting planted special seats for the pride body because he knew the real rain is coming it must have the seed to follow so we so when you are sowing as far as I know the oak the guy just walks and throws the seed that's so in but he says when you plant it says you dig a hole you take all their and you put you you plant it now I'm not doing away with Matthew 13 don't get me wrong but brother ben says here planting you dig a hole and you put the seed in the ground now listen so I'm gonna read the scripture someone that we always read blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night and he she he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper the ungodly are not so but I like the chaff so that's where Burroughs was right on the threshing floor and that's where they throw the the wheat up and the wind blows the tough way come on you must be spiritual now so that's where Bo's was in the threshing for fresh in the wheat thrown it up and the wind will come let a moria Shh through the shack away the tears he says the ungodly are not so bad I like the chaff which the wind drives away therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous for the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly Shall Perish now listen to the court planting the vine and way to pondage blessed is the man that will not assemble himself with this office making fun calling the true church a bunch of phonetics he shall be like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water God has put him in a choice spot oh I hope you get the stone masters please man God has put you in a choice spot his fruit shall not wither he shall bring forth his leave and his fruits in his season was how payment wonder that this man is blessed he will be planted not just said hope you know I like seeing anything that's planted this is the Prophet now so don't argue with me if you want to argue check out who the Prophet then he says your wisdom versus faith he says it wasn't sent out he shall be like a tree that's sent out transposed from this to that he was planted what predestinated that thought of God before the foundation of the world placed him there not stuck out not by chance but was planted predestinated what to the rivers of water now look where you planted man he's who shall not wither or the process again Oh hallelujah though he dies I'll raise him up again at the last days that's right he's predestinated to be there not just by chance he was predestined to catch the word when it was sold and shall be right there when it sticks she is there he's planted not just stuck down he's actually planted that's right there's a lot of difference now this is a prophet speaking a stick in the ground then planting something it's different the seed was planted it found its own root holes when the waters begin to come in and break forth its life the spirit so that's what what is to give them sea life so that's why I am looking in I am a sound of abundance of rain he says because the rain that the rain is coming then he turns around sees I mean the real rain you mean he's making a difference between a shower in the real rain the real rain The Arbors rain the let the rain that's gonna come brother but he must have seen so what is the profit oh he's so the seed he put in season for the body that's why everyone can't take it come on man hallelujah I feel like running around this war man listen man if you realize God plant you in a choice spot your leaves cannot wither your fruits cannot wither right below low that's what you were saying you cannot the see the news not weak and strong the seed is strong it's gonna overcome but I think show the difference of his power this is just the end that's lame but you gonna pierce it brother sure says restoration the bright in David SOI and he spoken he said blessed is that man and notice he said he could not die his lease would would not wither no matter what they do they'll never kill that tree why it's way he's planted you see they tried to kill him but they can never kill it because it's where he's planted oh god I love this is so beautiful man and notice he said he could not die sleeves would not wither no no no matter what they do they'll never kill that tree why it sways planted that's what does it it sways planted he's planted by the rivers of water now notice Davis says his roots won't die hallelujah what if a man is planted in such a thing by the river with the springs he says 90 different springs feeding into him my what establishment yes do you realize what what you have my what in the stephanie has an a man that's planted by the river the rivers of water he says one water one spirit they are gifts of healing same spirit keeps her rassee same spirit and the same spirit but many gifts and one Giver Oh hallelujah now I like this John 7:38 he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of love it you must believe on him as the scripture says said not what some past they say but as the scripture says said now the prophets word is ain't over wrong and we know what Rome was supposed to do the prophets word is is hanging right in the stain over the Antichrist and what he's supposed to do he says the prophets word is hanging over the world council of churches and they were they supposed to prove the prophets word is hanging right over a bunch of sodomites and brother Peter was telling me they had a cape a parade just yesterday in London there was a gay parade so that they think they're marching and coming out to the closet meet them that's the word that must be fulfilled the Prophet said the sodomites must be revealed in the state so over them is hanging the word of Malachi for the prophets word is hanging over Los Angeles there's a prophesying of this man hanging over Los Angeles that she'll go down brother and now as she was shaken maybe that's the final loose maybe the next one will take it down where are you gonna stand like brother or us what is your story the story of your life sure man I feel the power of God in this place and right now the word of the Prophet is hanging over the prize right now this word is hanging over you brother right now this word there will be a church there will be a pride there will be a people the same word is hanging over you tonight there will be a bride brother delay there will be there will be Wanna without spot without wrinkle the same word thats hanging over los angeles is hanging over you tonight that you will be the bride you are the people in this Lane who will become the final voice so this word hangs over me tonight and that's what I'm preaching from that's what I'm holding on to brother Theo is this word of the Prophet they've got to come a pride I don't think I'm gonna go long tonight my brother cosmos already feels something telling me to cut off his presence is here already and the people who needs to break through so give them that privilege oh what a presence wow what an anointing Oh God the spoken word is original see the Gentile dispensation is to be finished with the church age when this anointed message arrives of course he will plant the seed of the entire Bible but all who pump from the serpent to the message in the former rain then will be rejected by the enormous people is this as he's for father John and Elijah as was spoken by our Lord this machine you plant the seed from of the entire Bible another original branch is coming forth scriptural signs of the but if that tree ever puts forth another branch it will be another book of ex-brother that's the story of our lives we won the same play we've not settling for less I'm not settling brother I want to see what brother Branham had I want to sit and remember he was the windshield that was waves over the people right and they say according to the Levitical law why is he waived the first corn that comes to maturity why is it waived do you know why to say that the rest of the crop the rest of the crop is also coming to maturity so brother Branham our first wave sheaf he came brother Liu what about the people behind him--as that's in the harvest about them brother you also come in man yeah when I say hang on don't give up don't give up don't give up that's why he was waved as an acceptance brother Anthony that the rest of the crop resources that's why we have the wave sheaf 23 then I would restore say the Lord I will do I will bring her back to original condition I will bring her back to original doctrine I will bring her back to the original word I will break every denomination pieces I will bring her back to my word God will not man not man did you see that God will everything he said yeah God will not man and this branch cannot bear fruit of her own not until it's energized by the vine and that's what I'm looking for and he says here in Matthew 15 verse 13 but the answered and said every plant which my Heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up and I'm here tonight every false doctrine every false interpretation will be rooted up brother everything that's in your life that's not of God it wasn't planted by God that cigarette said alcohol that lusts that pornography was implanted by God so everything that's not planted by God the car is gonna uproot it so tonight let him a blue tea tell him God open up take this out of me it's gonna be routed pluck it out deliver you set you free is going to approve that sickness that depression their filthy habits that malice that hatred that Autzen conscious that unbelief he's gonna uproot it hallelujah oh brother I hear the sound of abundance

Lord for me Oh God I'm gonna skip all this I'm gonna go yet to something I want to come to you my there's so much they'll just leave it oh my oh he says all this background has only been laying a foundation for a short quick message hallelujah listen don't give up he says we under he says listen to this quote here oh my I feel his presence is here man who might as well call that tray liner brother over my Alleluia yo listen what it says and I believe that right that the church is now standing on the threshold of the greatest fornication of applicants that the world has ever known you wanna go back to the world but right now he's ready to parties fullness he's ready to put on the Reina I hear the sound of abundance of rain so we right on the precipice we right on the edge don't go
