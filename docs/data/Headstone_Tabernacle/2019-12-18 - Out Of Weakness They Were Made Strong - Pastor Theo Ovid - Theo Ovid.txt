we need to hear from you tonight are you thank you for Sunday service we come here for more Lord feet or slow Peters please give us life feed us O God and strengthen us in the inner man granted Lord and we believe here inspired draw closer to you granted father in Jesus and we ask you tonight wanna turn to one portion of Scripture for people's chapter level wanna read a couple of verses dear when we verse 1 then 100 to 500 until he 1 to 40 Hebrews chapter 11 verse 1 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen verse 5 by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death I was not found because God had translated him but for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God our old faith is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him as belong to verse 31 my feet the holiday huh yo stop with the harlot and so unlike Rhea but is my feet by feet the hallelujah perish not with them that believe no when she had received the spies with peace what shall i must see for the time would feel me to tell of gideon of barack of samson of Jeff Todd of David also signer of the prophets who to feed subdue kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of the fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong rocks violent and fight tuned to flight the armies of the Indians women received their dead raised the life again others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection others a trial of cruel mockings and squadrons here moreover of bonds imprisonment they were stoned they were sawn asunder were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins being destitute afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and mountains and dense caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provided some better things for us the day without us should not be made perfect may God blesses woody would be seated I want to take a title from verse 34 we said quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong rocks fear and in fight to deflect the armies of the aliens and the title of the night is out of weakness they were made what a time last Sunday the continuation of the Book of the mission of Jesus granny I believe the Holy Spirit used or Birla mightily to bring out the history and and the channels that God use having some real colorful stories and tonight just want to draw some inspiration out of weakness they were made strong another thought it's very strange but changes equal pressure over time that's like a formula that's achievable so I put I want to do some work around the yard home and I was looking for couldn't get me on the fire final the cut lines so I excited with the old-fashioned way I've taken a compass and Robin again to stone it's an old fashioned with a shock muneca I recognize that apply pressure and had to take some time but every time I keep pushing the Cutlass on the stone for some water you can fire them you see the edges getting shiny getting shocked I could feel so I begin to think about what pressure over time does not just time but what pressure over time what it does it brings a change and this life of feet is not a 110 feet is a it's a life my feet you come here tonight you come here my feet tonight and if you come by feet you want to receive something tonight okay not just natural you come in let by the spirit you come to hear something from God it's not right praise the Lord judges 6:14 and the Lord look upon him this is top this is Gautam the Gideon and call him a goal in this guy mind and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites have that i sent thee he said on the air oh my lord where it shall I save Israel before my son is poor in and I am the least in my father's house and the lord senator and surely I will be the T and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man it is amazing whole board will take the lease the lowest the weakest the one that you didn't expect for your would even team to do great things with hallelujah so board would use and channel and go past human weaknesses and whatever it is that his sovereign purpose will be accomplished and that is why that book of the generation of Jesus Christ that is so important to know back and to the bride will be fulfill all that was prophesied you believe that so all these different brothers because he was he livin in the chapter of the hues of faith but his out of witness they were made strong David wasn't a big mighty man with muscles and qualify for the army but God used him as somebody under qualified I'm not qualified to qualify him the deeper go higher so when you're thinkin not qualified are you're unqualified God could qualify you because it's not by might nor by power it is by his spirit nobody like to have their witnesses exposed but God did identify these characters in the Bible to show not only their strengths but their weaknesses the not only their strength but their struggles and to show that he can he would denied an because they are part of him you're part of the can plan on his great mystery isn't that right Jacob I love you so I heat he knew all about Jacob before Jacob was even born hallelujah he know the kind of person Jacob was going to be but that didn't stop him from predestinated Jacob on to a desired end hallelujah so all what you brought you have a desire in the behind it or glory to God these stories of Abraham of Moses up Sarah all of them you don't only see their faith and their strength but you saw their weaknesses also hallelujah and that is why he bruising that mr. important because Hebrews 11 didn't take to come just their weaknesses it's show their faith in God it didn't say rehab on a prostitute he said I hate the holiday hab by fate she didn't care sure the rest of them because she operates under the level of faith it shows how much caught on his feet or glory of God by fate the elders obtained a good report and I think you have a good report tonight but God will do something better for us that table of us and that made perfect so God call us something higher something further before the battle for you can be hotter and heavier because it's a great shape to take us out to this age or blow it up God we will take a great faith to pull on that cap you you believe that even the prophets of the third Pole is the hope we can feed some people do our Bulldog faith and go to get him speaking fake just speak the world or glory to God amen we believe that hallelujah so this fate built out of weakness build out the struggles built out of battles hallelujah all mine Abraham and God say you have a son hallelujah impossibility but God drop out on him to see how his feet will get activated how could her old man his wife and child Aaron could believe God on a Bible said it when believed God or glory level and that belief was imputed unto him for righteousness and the Bible says blessed is the man unto whom god would not include sin or glory the court because the faith yep I'm the blood of Jesus was even shed yet or Chloe the corner court call that man righteous go you I a shot in the house Jesus they're comin County and pay the price yet but the faith and Ibrahim God call them and righteous God righteous seed so what you see feet is a journey features are process fit as a same time because 18 tell Abram 25 years and I love the phrasing that the brother branham brought he said when Abram came to the fullness of believe in you to get in on struggles you think he didn't have dogs when Sir didn't wanna make breakfast for him didn't think he got problems but he believed God not Sarah face not Sarah looked but he believed God Sarah physical looks wasn't encouraging to him because it couldn't be possible he was Sarah encouraged him to go until it heha and two years I mean oh praise God so Hebrews quenched the violence of fire as skilled another sword out of weakness no there are many people inside of that scripture they know their name everybody you know he said time would feel to tell all the stories of all these people here the god heroes not just what people are not they are called heroes hallelujah quenched the violence of fire you can talk about such a vision of it excape the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong what's vision in sight intend to flight the armies of the aliens or glory to God women received their dead raised to life again there wasn't taking no for an answer or glory the Cordillera can't give up you can't let go you cannot be condition so get you the press and domino that you want to give up a little cannot do that not Mannin have these heroes insider here I'm not man got enough profit to turn our hats back to the faith of the fathers or give the Lord a show it has always been about the fate let me say that it has always been about the faith because sin is unbelief always been about defeat hallelujah did the collective stories and histories and testimonies they were stoned they were sawn asunder they were tempted are you tempted they were tempted to temptation is part of it they were tempted they were trained with his soul they wonder what and scheme and goatskins being destitute affected and tormented it wasn't easy because

with a gift across the spirit away the world will do it feet in Courchevel [Applause] tn right tonight yes faith in God's Word Jesus had all the fine qualities of God in him do you believe that yet powers upon powers but when he met Satan he never uses power he give an example for the weakest of Christians when he met Satan he said it is written man shall my bread alone but by every word that proceedeth the mother of God the weakest question can take that stand God in His Word and every time when he would meet the enemies it is written he had power to do it but he met sit on the scene groans with the same word you can meet him wit it is written you Maria one is written whatever thing to desire when you pray believe you received them watch the order of the word believe now present tense you receive it and you shall have it it will be given to you later but believe it now before you can get your crop you have got to plant the seed and water it and believe it don't pick it up

when you separate in your heart that God's heal you sister you little boy you brother any of you you take one of this world and start testifying about it give it plenty of water fertilize it watch what takes place the Word of God will produce just exactly what it says if that is not the inspired Word of God I wouldn't be standing here I wouldn't believe in it but I know it's the truth all glory to God heaven will pass away but my love will not pass away I had a lot of planted it i watered a night least some block it out of my hand get you out God is in his word or glory to God Amen hallelujah are you giving my promise Terry you see the Jerusalem until McEwen perform on hang and they stay there until powerful on my hand I want to get her something here no glory to God I remember the quotation the world of God will be fix it and any way any time any place under any condition the Word of God alone I Lord I want to emphasize the fact alone not the world and I just not the word on a preacher just the word alone you would have got alone it is written world if he sit on no matter who he is what for me comes in ways act it well defeat Satan the written word of God so the devil don't want two things you know you don't want you in praise and worship and he don't want it with you written with no watch now here's another statement I want you to remember and that's you especially a so sick setting here but cancer cases and so for tonight he wanted to remember this that the right mental attitude this is a minor how you choose to think that's your your mind disposition because somebody could tell you something on you could choose to we see something negative for you to something positive he said the right mental attitude towards any divine promise of God will bring it to pass can you understand what I need the right mental attitude towards and if I promise of God we bring it up as gifts you will take the right mental attitude towards anything God has for me did you yell at anything anything performance you can have it I think that going over your head let me say that again anything God promised you could have it let me say it again anything God promised you gotta be angel of God coming to your house you can have the pillar fire in your home you could have a rainbow over your home you could have healing you can have Sealand you could have the liver runs you could have multiplication in your house your food could multiply in your house whatever you have listened when but apparently testimony or speaking skills since the haughty Rises that's nothing but the truth no that statement nothing but the truth that wasn't just a normal sheet metal oh that actually past dimensions when she said that back that past dimensions and went into the a break internment in heaven now having looked up their own heaven is right here in a faster dimension the energy said has nothing but achieved godhood that and that was so pleasing to God that God dropped down on the prophet and said give that woman whatever whatever whatever did you get at whatever whatever she wanted or glory to God whatever she wanted it was available or glory to God because this son had access to give that woman whatever she wanted because she said the right thing let me use a sinner I came after I saw we striving for like every because share the right then split the right take off the right wing get the right results hallelujah we find out we find him as soon as God came upon him he was anointed so Jesus he was waiting for his anointed he's 12 to 13 he was waiting for his anointing and that came when he got baptized fullness of the Godhead bodily 12 tell him he was anointed he made the Christ not right so what's something now no when he God came upon England on today went to new business and out after 40 days he defeated Satan by the Word of God and he did that so he brought this is part 1 again any divine promise in reach of the weakest of Christians if he was God why did he let Satan say it dub the Son of God before the miracle he says written and so then season always try to quote the word so what that shows that you can defeat sittin on the Word of God no matter the wood of corporal defeats isn't any place any way under any condition it's if it's in a belly of a wheel if it's in a lion's den if it's on the bed with a cancer it's leaning on the brilliant a debt in an automobile accident the Word of God will defeat Satan anywhere and the weakest Christian can use it it's your god-given privilege to do it Oh glory to God did you hear that now it's your privilege of code back that word the Lord that keep a vegan Lord that keepeth thee the Sun shall not smite thee by day nor the moon by night he shall preserve thy soul it's your word the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want it's your little Fiat me beside the still waters it's your good we restore it my soul dear do I walk to the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and staff they comfort me Oh hallelujah is his word it's your word what glow a little oh and your ticket and you applying your word it's no longer in the Bible yours will give the Lord a show [Applause] go with what you're not saying because you feel like you received if somebody say I know I'm saved because I had a children to me that's not why I am saying citizen could with me around that storm anyway and he can you to upon your feelings that's right but when I walked back and said don't say at the Lord my fear is built on the Word of God he can whip that away he can beat you on your feelings but he can't be sure you're safe because your faith is resting wear underwear and he cannot defeat that [Applause] you're feeling up you're feeling down you're feeling go you feeling - Kristen you know feeling forget that yes here's a question forget that tell a feeling go somewhere else you're a Christian because clutch net so you're Christian because God told you you're crystal because by putting him on the book and you see a name like John and you're shaking and you're worshiping is that feel as though this is believers though this [Applause] now listen let's continue remember Jesus had all the qualities of the father in him do you believe that he sure did all the fine gifts of God was in Christ he was the offspring of God but notice when he met Satan no I'd get us all different parts in the message so I won't put you together like this to him I find it something repetitive but there's some key things inside here I want you to get all right that's why I'm seeing it back but watch but but when he met sit and for you for your example he never used one gift on him when Satan came he said is written and he was put into ternary 727 14s belief on the SAMS man shall it be better alone so what is risk with me would you know just wasn't just touring that you know he's eternally stolen the bread Jesus given Scripture man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God Satan tell me who you talking to he talking to by the believe in cotton Christian okay the Lord a shout come on now come on now say it I'm gonna eat your can do he is talking to a Bible believer called a Christian so Jesus was floatin undercoats he was broken on the scriptures he went even back set on the world man shall live by bread alone but this descriptor I say that so I'm not out here with you no knowledge of the principles of land that's what Satan had since the Canadian see understand don't reform so that my till had a bus that I'm destroy that I'm sure the devil he of power over himself now he fit the rule because he put me of character there was nothing in him that he'd ever could hold on to couldn't pull him with temptation couldn't pull in here and pull in here because he was clean on the inside from all unbelief a life of faith was inside of him he was flowing through him that's why he said Peter come Andrew come is fear talking here I'm never a respondent because they are seeds of God they they don't know yet who they are they just following a man with a beard come I will make you fishers of men and then drop the message that the volume sheep arancino vertically forgery business all awkward women a nose prettiman net building business and the board building businessman I'm official business and all of a sudden things crash become his sons fallen preaching about the kingdom of God is that happen oh let's continue know it but I'm gonna get notice here it is I want you to see it and get it know the Word of God the written word of God will defeat Sita anywhere any place any time it is written there it is listen this is if I don't want to get here everybody wouldn't have gifts so Jesus brought it down to a place where those who do not have gifts that to Putin that do not have much very much faith could say it is written everybody don't have gifts so Jesus brought it to a place where it goes with all gifts it is written it is written I don't need a gift to say that I just need to say it I am THE LORD thy God ideality of all I diseases it is written I will never leave you nor forsake you but I'll be with you even in you it is written Oh glory I shall be filled I shall be seen speak a dog must prophesy again [Applause] [Music] [Music] there was a little woman in Germany but a year two ago she had transferred is it on the back of the transmitter did of being English I could read it she have been crippled in a wheelchair for 15 years and she got this she read her she must call the past there's no pastor called some Christian then confess everything that she had everything that she had done wrong and make it right with God and then lead up over her heart and pin it on a underneat garment and then have feet so when she got all this done a pastor was there she put it in her heart she said no almond ever you have had me long enough get away and up she got and when walking that is how simple it was perfectly healed normally it is just your simple faith in believing people try to make fear too complicated it is not complicated it's a simple childlike feet you know the blood in the Old Testament was applied by this earth you heard that so many times you know what hyssop is just common weeds you find it anywhere down in Egypt it grows out up a cracks in the building where the wind pack the seed they get it in a little diamond shape leave hyssop is common so what does that mean you don't have to have a super faith to a title engineer just common feet believe it that's all email hallelujah let's see if we could hit the home stretch here Wow from perfect strength but a Brannon read this scripture where God told pouring my grace is sufficient to thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness and he said for my strength is made perfect in weakness and he says now he said no this unusual text and this text on weakness because we are always testifying we are so strong we try to make our weaknesses excuses we want to tell our big Br how great we are and I think that's one of the things that God give me this text for was to get both of our mind the little things that we do and what we come to it for is to find out where our falses and the things we might better ourselves if we would come to church for any other objective I'm afraid we won't get too much out of coming to church we must come to find our weaknesses find our bad places house to see all that we are and put our trust in somebody that are strong but so there are so many of us like to testify or like to think we are insufficient therefore we meet an excuse I have no education I have no ability I'm unable to do this and if you keep that up and do that in that way keep going like that then you can't among anything but the very thing that we make excuses by our weakness God uses that very thing to tackle the job with he waits for us to get in that condition so he can use us we take the exclusive say well I can't do this I'm insufficient I can't do this and God takes that very thing to do job is true and the reason why he chooses us is because we in that condition now that sounds strange there's a few minutes we get it God's willing we find out that those people who are the weakest and they rejected by the outside world is God he rose that's a conquerors in the front line take those who are feeding themselves unwitting and I said that I remember when Batman was preacher nobody sees an unfolding in wood and so on he said when the voice said in line or a tripod Judah had prevailed and you know where that was and they got negate cemani so it songs dramatically I know you have a Judah everything to hoop the seven seals that time Jesus born in fire it was possible it's got paths Jesus battle in the Garden of Gethsemane hallelujah to take the full mantle to go to Calvary and when he overcome his human spirit and the choice of will and he battled with it in human will and you overcome that and you recognize that he's going forward he overcame right there that was a lion Oh hallelujah praise God so you see what God called great god you

up in such a way to keeping honor and glory to God Oh in his weakness God brings tranked inside of him to make money festoons for his glory all glory to go that way Sam say once more Lord they have no right to take on my eyes I'm fencing in my eyes once more Lord Oh glory to God he had it before he could have it again Oh glory that God once more and we had this before what we talking about we're

mother sinem yeah make man that was us but the man that got put there to unfold us he fell so God had to go and reboot and started another way on the sand this Adam was supposed to speak for us because Adam had the names and I'm at the book so he was the speaker for us to come for but when I done said the book went back and he has a rigid order so the names I was seated in Adam hallelujah I

words you could talk talk to have said all your multi-contour fate for when the co-workers even know that just feet in operation so before Enoch was translated he had a testimony that he pleased God you can see it on feet but this life of pleasing God was evident that was about this man and he here we go pressure over time and the formula bring changes he is a rewarder of them that seek Him no no no not seek Him because you can stick up a1 Laura what I seek you I want to see a face alright until next week and then you tell people you apply this year that's not what we talking about them that diligently energetically enthusiastically passionately pressure over time bring a reward and result or blow either gourd you have to have an attitude or glory they'll call you have to get a we don't have a camper gets it started tonight Oh glory logo you can just listen if you rub any cordless or knife against this one sue mm-hmm you cannot behold and do not know go there's no pressure just rub in a killin time a sharpening your cold your formal you're lukewarm Asia and the in church a priest no one again no one here yet bring it we quit early pastor Dupree you're reading a Bible on your panic pastors they open a Bible I read down your again day I mean laughs angry baby last episodes it nothing happening with you there's no change but when you set a press person present you see that action you see all your us at the edge is that I guess silver because I want to bleed a green and cut I want to cut clean I wonder cut shot if it's not sharp you have to put more pressure to cut down the grass and the code only treason hallelujah are the sons of God will get the shorter the one of the same sure they have the same way they have listened mango just step forward and bring this with allies the same when people read in dead they're struggling with them words it would just come alive that's what but I bottom did he just came out of nowhere and make that would begin to live and it challenged other ministers to come forward with signs and wonders and miracles but he step out because a voice said us john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of Christ you have a method of foreign my second coming of Christ quad kill him my message Oklahoma to God and before that message thundered he had was triples cheese THS three phases a football a second polymer triple Oh hallelujah a feelin ministry to catch the people that you have confidence qualities with this man but the message will come in and human ministry he going to Baptist Methodist Pentecostal everybody they'll love him the oven Wrigley five hours the churches full enough big tent meeting and so on like that and afterwards as you get some in a message they started pulled back hallelujah because it can take the world why because they were always shocked to begin with God waiting for your generation got to bring the pic you have to be the continuation of the book of the generation of Jesus Christ God knew the Pentecostal was gonna be shocked could as part of the cool process of the plan life hallelujah but after his shocking will be seeded supporters written on you so you had the people I thought it was back enough you had the people as what was brought in for you had the people that God was looking out for all the other words are stages of the plant life but this is the recovering of the life and got enough to get it up in the cedar and at the end of time all the life is gone into the seed and the shock is dead the tree is dead everything else is dead does all the life is in the cedar now sorry all the life could be in the bride and she you have the equipment power and the magnetism of the Holy Ghost going to be in that seed and the seed gonna be in you so when that great mighty man that come over that city of Moscow because the rats are gonna be in you so if I just fight Antonio up turn off the bright we'll be in the rapture we got a raptor gonna be in the pride that fake was an e knock Oh glory to God hallelujah he couldn't share our faith with his wife there's not much going on get Y fast when you get hot please not that oh no this has to be in you you can't share it you know how the testimony please God and one day was walking he got lighter and lighter and lighter and then he took off let me finish oh my oh my magically every hero God ever had on the front line was that type Ella please i poisoned above rejected a person that thought he was insufficient a person that have no belly at all then that's the person in the good ship so what could stack using them when they feel like they can't they haven't got nothing that's why I got stuck at all of them and do something with them when we are thinking that we are able to do it then God can't use that because we all wanted to do it ourselves see and then we get the fever's now on the other side with insufficient we don't want to do it then if we just listen to the call of God that's the very thing that God wants us to do the kind of sheep that so he can when there we go here we go what all this weakness is about what but always talking about listen it's bad when we are insufficient ourselves then we are subject to yield to God's Spirit so sometime go lay around your runn until you feel and flop because you run in your run you do in your do and when you recognize you can't do it then your give room nobody to do it because you try and you feel you try and it didn't work out you put your best foot forward and it still wasn't good enough God don't want your best foot forward he want your foot to be out of it altogether you want you to give room that he could step in to show you with your boss others but by your micro power but by his spirit I want this spirit come upon your life then that's what happened Sampson the spirit of walking upon Sampson happened to David speed of walking upon David all and I just woke him up on them and they did this under this and after what they felt it was they flesh and all continents but the spirit looking upon them and this was accomplished so in this is God put the word in the bright to use the word in the brain because the spirit upon a penny custom and was a whole disaster and a mess so Court is not doing that again he's not anointing flesh he imagined would so that's why I take all these years to get this word in the bride he said the world is being preached so called or team that this word is preached to get inside of you know you have to know it is inside of you you have to believe it inside of you that's what faith is about inside of you [Music] it is something that's revealed to you that is not yet but you know it will be so ever ever revelation but you're not ripen and experience yet you're right and you're getting revelation but you don't have the experience of it yet that is faith Oh glory to God so when God drop I use upon Abraham he had a revelation he couldn't give it to Sarah a fast Sarah is concerned she is barren she can't have no chance he's past childbearing age so do talk that talk to me but far as Abram concerned he arising do you see that Isaac has not manifest yet it's in his fate it's in the seed inside of him he had to testify the singer God said so because Sarah is the wound that he gonna use to make this CD rom hack manifest so he can't be forced Mira he got drunk Sarah he can't give up Sarah he can't somebody to kidnap Sarah Soraka stay right here whatever condition she's in or the crunchy punky she is that is the woman that gonna be used by God to produce this child for Liza and if you believe Isaac coming here EE Sarah will be change so it will take some pressure it will take some time it will take twenty five years [Laughter] but that change coming I do return unto thee according to the time of life transformation is coming change is coming if we take some pressure it's my pick something guardian and when we are insufficient ourselves I'm gonna lose then we are subjects to yield to God spirit as long as we think we can do it we can't do it but when we get to a place where we know we can't do it that's the problem there but we have to come to a place where we know we can't do it then we yield ourselves to God and he does it so that if it is us trying to do it we will feel I think I want to read it again if it is us trying to do it we would feel but when we just heal ourselves a God then God can feel [Music] when them guys come with all moldy bread to Joshua Josh annum Dinkins alone they say you come off a country Oh God that time Phoenix place the gone conquer then they end up saddle with them characters with us a designer because they make a covenant with them characters who are supposed to be defeated by talked everything young yeah

instruct the people and when men's are the for long this guy work this guy worked is not always supposed to be the know about see God Cal I save things going off key something going off key because God have to keep his word he is god this is land possession time more than was drifting from Egypt to this land the journey was the direct one God send them to the wilderness in order to make sure time and pressure change their mind but Egypt was in the heart yes it was a short journey you know but God passed them a tough road to hope that time and pressure will change and main and change your heart from then the leeks and onions in Egypt but it was in the heart Oh glory to God hallelujah you want him cross over and run back and after was right at Hayes mania when they stumble there and they said we can't take it I wasn't gonna say hard enough that was it that was all that wilderness journey God was being ridden he could handle that but not when you learn in front of your man could imagine a reached this point this is 2019 and I'm taunting God's promises and I'm told is you could take it God will finish anybody want the question of what will finish with them we had near another worry first believed so I am back in no no we never know be aware labor or glory of God to be part of Hebrews 11 we are well able to be counted but Emma Wallen brothers with it we are wherever don't tell me God blessed you're here and do this for you here look away for you here and open that door for you here and that corner was closed that I don't have to open we will moved it or Fiasco no glory no God hallelujah [Applause] you cease lack of strength or weakness let me talk about a turban I'm not the most sinful weakness but weakness is a lack of faith because faith is the victory that overcomes the world and if you study you you went good very far but God brings the wood brick bring the wood no for your faith in Him see in the word so when you take 15 it what this is what this is what power in you then you seal yourself another get charged up because you will get no calls got a charge of a cell phone I'm sure people don't make no miscibility if there was reading the Bible as much as I do but for right now forget this church and revival right now but didn't want to miss the course it and attach it up right shredder charged up it's a function well you have to charge up the effectively function when somebody boxes in the lawful discharge and then the funeral home dispose of them outside after selling in church muezzin chants the discharge arrange it because there's no pressure over time that's what prayer does to Adam you can say good morning good evening gotta take some time I'm still there with intense elijah a man of like pastor prayed earnestly did you hear that inner prayer yeah just say prayers he prayed earnestly that it will not rain then he prayed again for him so is an approach of desperation its approach of businesses that much is the axis shall be given see condition and fine not gonna be open if somebody Taylor and run as they asked yesterday oh god I get it now I seek and I didn't find I'm not played over but anywhere don't further he that asked it he that seek it either knock it it has to have some condition to Jive you not just a not once but to keep knocking the door open when you understand this you don't open it what you want then you're not stopping is go open you wanna walk you have come to go back and come to get in you come to get your request made known make manifest let me see oh my [Music] remember one thing we must master especially young preachers and ly members alike there's one thing that you have got to master if we expect the fulfill go design our life that is we have to master the thought of human ability if we ever get to a spot where we think we can do it with our intelligence and our abilities we have got to master that in such a way that we can get rid of the thing leader societal gorkon users and make a complete surrender we cannot use one ability but is it vegan we have got to surrender complete surrender to come to God you've gotta surrender him both soul body and spirit everything you are has to be surrender to God in order he can work his will in you and I know that's hard I know so he's not saying it as easy singing that's hard I know because we all always wanted to do our part in something we know you know we want to do it we see well I just know it should be done this way but as long as you're doing it that way it's gonna be wrong go we'll never use that effort maybe with the help of the Lord we're going to get into that few minutes to show you how God cannot use your ability so he put his ability in you and use that not your own is his ability so we are here tonight by the ability of God we speak tonight by courts ability hallelujah are you at me no and what what what no no ability I don't care whose it is we'll never be usable in the sight of God God has to get all of our abilities out of us before he can achieve his purpose so he got something for us to do as long as we feel we're doing a pretty good job out of it then we will never you people use of God what good did it do nothing he said it was so wet then God can achieve his purpose by sinning not a revival he needs to send a killin so we can revive you need to die before you can be born again he needs a killing of ourselves this Tabernacle needs are killing on me with it all of us we need a killing so we can be revived to a new life whole turn you hope to a new experience we first need a day of mourning that's what we call it a day of mourning we need a place of yielding to the spirit instead so much only turn upon schooling upon programs or campaigns and rely upon so many ministers to cooperate we allow so many if we can't get some money we won't do it we won't go into the cities without that he said we have got to get away from that that is human ability you an ability of man and fight for men man go contrary to the leader of this five old gang he said he put a modify for so he here today I magnify for tomorrow he's no fool he's already fool because the bishop the bishop keep the money food animal is he that person was a soldier - minister he's all fallen angel fall from way for my mind sister immediately becomes a fallen angel Oh dies when man appointed and then man get disappointed he must get disappointed and mana point but when got a point to disappoint when court appoint a man nobody could on appointed but when man appointed as a different thing about it you look at my disappointment that's how you have to seek the Lord you have to look to hear from God gonna have to speak to you Oh hallelujah let me let me see no watch he said so we have got to carry from your nobility we gotta get to a place where we can surrender our souls and lives even to the housewife so not my past and another housewife farmer mechanic whoever we are we gotta surrender completely to God we are nothing then Gorka start using us and he said that include all of us everyone that's the thing we got to do history proves history does that God always choose the nobodies to become in somebody's go take the person that is nothing and I hope this get don't deep to us good here and it equal to that you realize that you've got to become nothing I don't know it all not agree somebody better nobody and you're glad to come to dust and you've got to come to a place where you know you're nothing and don't ever rise above that as soon as you rise up over to rise above God you got to keep yourself in the dust could imagine people saying I am the Holy Ghost Lucas in here you stay neat does he rise above God man playin good hallelujah please cook you got to keep yourself in the dust on the road to Damascus you got to keep yourself off your high horses that's four everywhere here and in the typical I often said the greatest enemy I've got his william branham he's the one that gets in going to me he's the one that gets lazy he's the one that gets to our place sometimes way thinks he can do something about it when he does that shows quad right out the picture when I could get rid of that guy then I can get to a place that he's out of the way and court can come over and pick things that william branham knows nothing about [Applause] hallelujah glory to God so God passes nobles and get to beat this God passes those who think there's something to take somebody above nothing in order to work his purpose in their life court set up all my strength is made perfect in your weakness oh my I want to skip if we ever get to happen let me say let's something to console you I'm going to close here is some that encourages us are you ready out of weakness and humility God chooses the people the bill his kingdom out of if we ever get to heaven if we ever stand in the presence of God with his church we were standing a bunch of people that's been weak and rejected and cast out by the world and knows nothing I'm gonna close I want to read a scripture and this is from okay and I keep the past when David and his men would come to Z Glock under to the day that the Americas had invaded assault and Ziggler had smitten Ziggler and burn her with fire up taking the woman captive and what the errand is true not any either great or small but tied him away and went on their way so David Iceland came to the city and behold it was boom with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captives and then David and the people that were with him lift up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep so this is this is depression on steroids the week till they have no more tears to weep they do any Lord's business and come to see the wise taken away the city's pillaged so then David and the people that were with him lift up their voice and wept until there was no more power to weep and they were too wise you're taking in the captives a hen WOM his jester lights and Abigail the wife of Navarre the camera light and evil was greatly distressed for the people speak of stoning him because the soul of all the people was greed this imagine it taught him to stone live thanks how upset people I know he's the pastor he the leader is it this is it that easy champion I think and look all gone his wife gone family gone every man for his sons and for his daughters but okay but he called the soul of the people would grieve every man for his sons and his daughters but David encouraged himself in the Lord and then this is what faith does this is what a life of faith does every body we press and it's a legal depression it's not like you've got a dead where's no we owe so many Lord look what he'd ever come and do and look what happened look what and everybody around David is in this mood and David encouraged himself in the Lord his God I like that but David encouraged himself in the Lord his God and David said there'll be other priests I'm America son I pray thee bring me here at the ephod and he brought him here at the e-40 David and David inquired of the Lord shall I push you after the truth shall I over take them and he answered and pursue for thou shalt surely overtake them and with old feel recover all here it is the family is captured here it is everybody along is depressed crying considering the stone David what a terrible hour for him to be in there's no support the Brethren are wrong David he has no support the Bible said he encouraged himself and he acts the priests to bring on the iPod to seek the Lord and the ark squad one question should I continue on moopan morn no shall I push you go after them or not God's sake on overtake them I'm your queen and recover all listen listen if David was in the mood that them weepers was in to weep with them and to be in that spirit he wouldn't have this chain to pursue but I said David when everybody was crying ask of the Lord if he should go after what it rightfully is and God told him push you and David jump on his horse with some human and ride all night long and go ahead Boston Philadelphia everybody he's got every single one was restored time and pressure does bring change it took time to pursue it took time to ride to get the way it was going but when he pursued but there he put the hole that he was supposed to bring back home on church this feat was lost for seven ages God was isn't to wait for this our descent Malachi 4:2 turn on us back to the faith of the fathers we will rise up we will push you we're gonna have that faith
