speak to our hearts Lord maybe not leader the same where we came but may our lives be transformed by the transforming power of the word of God granted Father in Jesus and we asking it god bless you and thank you praise God for coming out this morning and we want to go straight into the scriptures we have second Peter tree 1 to 14 Malachi tree verse 6 and Hebrews 6 was 10 to 18 tree portion of Scripture second Peter tree wanna read from verse 1 to 14 Malachi 3 is 6 and Hebrews 6 10 to 18 so we go to 2nd Peter this second epistle beloved I now write unto you in both which I stir up your pure Minds may we have remembrance that he may be mindful of the words which was spoken before by the holy prophets of the commandments of us and of our pastors of our Lord Jesus Lord and Savior knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lusts saying where is the promise of his coming for since the father's fell asleep all things continue as the world from the beginning of the creation for this day willingly are ignorant of that by the Word of God the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished but that the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word a kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men but beloved be not ignorant of this wanting that one day with the Lord is a thousand years and a thousand years as one day the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is long-suffering to us-ward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance but the day of the Lord shall come as a thief in the night in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that out the Aaron shall be built up here we go seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought he to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for and hasting unto the common of the day of God wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall never feel the need nevertheless we look we according to his promise look for a new heaven a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness wherefore beloved seeing ye look for such things be diligent that you may found of him in peace without spot and blameless malachi tree one verse verse six and it reads for i am god i changed not stop right there and we go to hebrews chapter 6 we didn't from verse 10 for God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which you have sure towards his name in that you have ministered to the Saints under Minister we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end that you be not slothful but followers of them who true feet and patience inherit the promises for when God made promise to Abraham because he could not swear by no greater he swore by himself saying surely blessing I will bless thee multiplying I will multiply thee so after he had there we go patiently endured he obtained the promise for men verily swear by the greater and an ode for confirmation is to them an end of all strife wherein God willing more abundantly - shown to the ears of promise the immutability of his counsel confirm it by an oath that by two immutable things in which is impossible for God to lie that we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge they lay hold upon the hope that's before us let's bow our heads one more time father we thank you for your word blesses it and interpreted our hearts in GSM we ask it amen and amen god bless you may be seated praise the Lord but array night god bless you thank you for that message not sunday appreciate a message what shall we say to these things if God be for us who can be against us and let us go on to perfection amen shall we tango for that an inspiration a brought light service I was a real blessing to us under the church so are you ready this morning for the words ready for God to stick to your hearts I am still waiting on him Oh hallelujah one day we're gonna get to that spot to say but you know what I'm waitin on hallelujah praise God but this morning I saw upon my heart I have a title and that title was taken from the scriptures in Malachi 3:6 the title is I am God and I change not this is not the overt saying I am God no just want to make sure that very very clear this is the scriptures hidden I am God and I changed not and the inspiration the coming of judgment that's the inspiration the coming of judgment when we use the term the coming of the Lord and Jesus coming again he's not coming to halo the world he's not coming to smile with mankind he's coming in judgment that's what the coming of the Lord is don't forget that now he's not coming to bring apples and grapes he's coming in judgment hallelujah I'll read and this is from the unchangeable word of God but aberlin given a story here testimony a young lady out in Oregon was trying to discuss with me one time she belonged to a church where that Mary was the boss over and she was talking about I hear she said you mean to tell me in heaven these bunch of idiots like what's going on in the last night when you were preaching will be the people that they really have I said that's what the Bible says she said I said your Blessed Virgin Mary had to go up to Pentecost and receive the Holy Ghost and act like them people did last night or she would have never went to heaven she said that's not so I said let me show you right here in acts 2 where it was so or not Mary got so drunk she staggered like she was drunk in the spirit actually like a drunk person on their Pentecost and if God wouldn't let Mary go home to heaven anything less than how in the world are you gonna make it without that you she let you belong to any choice you want to you'll have to have the same experience the same exactly she said well I wouldn't want to be there I said I don't think you have to worry very much about that I don't think you have very much to worry about that I said no go on and write up a real dirty article of it in the people and I will tell you this does say it the Lord you mark my words down between this and two months from now you'll be dying on the side of the road in an accident and you will remember the words I told you let's continue she never wrote nothing she played a wise trick there I seen her dying no hello this this is important this is very important I seen her dying lean in a car accident and God was given her a chance then but she is smart enough not to write nothing there was nothing in the paper they just let it go that was a smart idea she only save her own life by it God is still God do you understand what happened there the prophet saw a vision of her dying an accident and that vision was dependent upon the action she would take if she wrote that evil article she was gonna be judged she was smile she saved my life I'm not writing article it Pierce to do the right thing and say the right thing it pays to have respects because God is still God I'm a dying a morning but you still God you may get I really paid but he is still God you could do whatever you want to do but here still God you could say a free to do this and you're free to do that but you are not free from the consequences of what you have done [Applause] hallelujah does not free of choice of consequences because nature have laws if you break those laws you pay the penalty of those laws beside free I plant my garden with corn and I thank God I am NOT cleaning no grass I clearly know weeds well you will see some tap corn and you'll get no corn and you're wasted time planting because they lost the other get never wins away from them corn isn't that right and that's because God is God he deserves respects and we have got to respect him and give fear to him and that brings respects and that's why the virus talked about here's the beginning of wisdom to fear God and keep his Commandments the beginning of wisdom isn't that right and God has demanded watch and he we have got to respect him and give fear to him and that brings respect God has demanded that for himself and for all his servants and God demands respects for his servants his servants how we know they're his servants because he's vindicates these servants by his word he takes these servants and make them service of God and prove their servants and by making his wood work through them servants then as I respect that servant you respect God and when you respect when I respect you and you respect me and we respect each other then we are respecting God so you can't claim to respect God and disrespect your brother or your sister your give respects because you have it you have to have it to give it and that's something that we fought for and we taught you to fight for because here's the coming of judgement hallelujah and the tongue is an unruly member and something have to come to team that tone you have to pressure wait to see the right thing that's what sister haughty right did she said the right thing she said that's nothing but the truth but a random and that true even a different day all together that's what Martha Mary said the right and even know Lord and that showed Jesus into another channel altogether that he could says we have you lead him praise God I am the resurrection and the life because a sister said the wrong ting praise God she can say Jesus you want some more coffee and biscuit is awake going on here we have some special covering or something for you know she went in a different gear Lord if you had been here my brother had not died she was in a gear to ask for more or glory to God she wasn't in a gear to stick in a circumstance and to remain in a condition around her she wanted to see it as something that could have changed what was wrong huh sometime your words changed brick in some dimension that change the whole thing for your life Oh give the Lord some praise this morning hallelujah Jesus praying one time preaching one time when I saw you come up to him so now watching him for a while observing him when he recognized what going on he caught it he had a sick man home and he came up to Jesus he asked permission he said master respects you say you knew who I am forget it Master I have a servant sick and I see you a man under Authority I see you say no one going he go just speak the word don't even come on my house I might serve I shall be healed this wasn't a gene this was a Gentile this was a soldier this was one of Rome's men that understood the principle to have authority you can't do your own thing you got to be under authority but the lawyers out in the halls we don't nobody in the church doing their own thing running the own show you have to be authorized you have to be under authority then you have the backup from everything behind you and Jesus said go thy way that you suffered is healed then he said I've never seen faith like this in Israel that man just popped the world on run with it we want you to take that well don't steal anything just take it and run with it I am healed by His stripes go go deliver my family deliver my husband my love my children [Music] Oh hallelujah hallelujah you ain't emit the water from it the touch you have come into watching from intercourse how will it happen you come in the clear-up myself welcome to stay here you come to participate they come to recognize what God is saying what God is doing you got a gun and falls inside of it you are a popular shake or possibly shake him but there's a shaken coming Oh hallelujah God Jesus is coming [Applause] it's continued I was standing right there in the corner preaching some years ago as a boy preacher boy preacher and there was a woman come he was a Catholic by fate how small was a Catholic she was a pretty woman nice-looking twenty years old twenty-two I knew I was a girl in the city she came by he stood here she said I wouldn't let my pet cow have the religion that william branham god how old twenty two young sister the next day before I could get to her she was dying in the hospital and I don't know yet what killed her she was dying on Hospital husband come to get me he was a Catholic he come he said come quickly say a prayer for my wife she's been calling for you all evening she's dying when I said I will go I got in the car and left the meeting and started to the hospital and I run up the steps I met the nurse and she said she's already dead he said come say a prayer for her now and you know I said she is dead he said say a prayer anyhow I said it won't do him no good no but but come and look at her I went down she had that reddish black I believe they call it over in here very pretty woman few freckles across her face great big brown eyes that woman the new said Billy she died in such agony until she scream out your name as loud as she could and said tell him to forgive me till the freckles stood out of her face like watts and those big eyes had set way out of her eyelids half closed over course you know what happen when a person died they would kidney and boughs move she was steaming all over and dying in such agony not because she disrespected me but she disrespected the gospel that I was preaching and God was working with signs and wonders and why die what Jesus said I could say you could talk against this now but the olive will not come when quad understand his Holy Spirit one word against it will not be forgiven in this world or the world to come just one word against it that's the gospel that's the word and that's how much we just have to respect Oh hallelujah I do believe that sometime in New Albany I was standing talking to a sinner leaned them to Christ a big ol rough handed man in the guard a man was a friend of mine his son-in-law run the garage next door I was standing preaching a dinner or eating a sandwich talking to him about God until the daytime I find somewhere I could good or through the daytime I'd find somewhere where I could go at dinner and time and tried to win us all to Christ that was his dinner hobby don't eat by yourself you gonna even get to win somebody he said mr. Branum he said I was just a boy preacher myself he said mr. Brannon my mother had that kind of religion that hot that religion and tears was running on his cheeks I said how long she'd be going yes she always prayed for me I said that God had hit her prayers is trying to answer them right now for her and this man walked in there and say hello he was drunk he said hey Billy listen any time you want to come over to my garage you come but don't bring that all you all a religion of yours over here I tell that him I said anywhere Christ is not welcome I'll not be so he turn around and said all get max SL boy and I just heard in my heart a voice see you would reap what you sow it'll be better for you that a millstone was hung at your neck and drunk in the depths of the sea and his own son-in-law that very same afternoon run him over with a 2-tone shovel a truck loaded on and mash him down in the ground you have got to respect God God demands respect he demands it how I could get my testimony for hour after hour I've seen in my lifetime I've seen other countries other parts of the nation so for the things are taking place but to omit that just you'll get the idea of what I'm trying to say to you you must respect it I've seen young people except in the meetings and snicker and laugh in the meeting and less than 24 hours be crushed into the streets this is young people in that's right Ezekiel 9 the Bible says slay utterly young all male/female little children but come not anyone near with that mark that has nothing to it which church you go to that has that newest denomination it belong to that have to do with the pillar fire and God because God promised alas this Baptist and Methodist and your witness and Peres myself message people couldn't promise that God promised sons and daughters that put a comment to a manifestations position in the last days that's what God promised hallelujah there's only one church jesus said upon this rock I will build my church there was only one church and you are baptized into that church you can't join it they're gonna be born in it that bird changes your heart that bird can use your desires that birth changes emotional objectives and your ambition [Applause] that change give you one wife not a wife a nice your friends outside that don't give there that one wife gives you one husband not husband and special men outside as a close friend not that [Music] because they come to Christ you have to come to the waters of separation something that separates you to know you are mad you are separated unto God [Music] [Applause] but the gospel has preached know anything goes because I don't want to offend the people you don't want to show them where the exit is you don't want to do that you don't want the trough this one I know of this one's here that walks off like Excel listen quarter on a democracy brought around people for him and everybody vote for this my god [Applause] [Music] his word comes from Ellen is what kill someone hi he is no respecter of persons shops pastors priests he has no respect here respected horn word when his pocket he swore by yet Oh glory to God his pocket and he swear by it there is none greater than him tonight that was none greater than this clot these are awesome cut he is God [Applause] [Music] maybe season but you know what happened men making their own gods the gods of the imagination the courts of their own mind they have idols they don't have to regard they are message God they have your interpretation god I tell somebody gonna come on a photo shoot go to come into sense and I like by oh man I'll take a picture with a rainbow here let's go here let the light yeah that means what [Music] [Applause] [Applause] and I change not [Applause] listen you may be Caesar if everybody in America repent America will still be judged because America already rejected God the judgement is already sealed got a change that I've seen young people says in a meeting in one year when I was placed on next maybe within six months go back to the same place and practically everyone I was born stricken somewhere with disease and things you have to respect it I remember sitting younger one night of Tennessee I was going out the door preaching enough big Baptist Church I felt led that night to call her to come up to Christ she laughed in my face when I when I called them the crowd she happen to be one of the Deacons daughters so they didn't like the daughter I became his pastor daughter pastor son passed mother pastor father pasta brother pastor sister elder daughter eldest son my daughter what possession that has nothing to do with what God has said God is no respecter persons that's why no hire me and bigger you we all have different positions and roles and posts a fulfill I'm called to do this if I do this I mean God's plan and program for my whole life to be you call this there here wouldn't do something about the free online if you don't personally apply what you're hearing to your own spirit and life you just like a Catholic basically I don't really marry I'm going with that the priests say that the other post-feminist authorized all and priests to forgive abortions and because his mom says so he fee whistle here anything he's got and he's got to them but this one we say yes Malachi g6 he said I am God [Music] not that kind of not that kind of he wanting they set them up as God but mine own poop but he didn't Bible the one who say I am good and I changed that he does prove themselves he does vindicate himself he not afraid to throw himself that's my lighter said let the brother and I serve I fire let God be God give the Lord a shout in the house [Applause] and this message would is aborted in a serious challenge after all these churches of 50 plus years when the god of Elijah began the stepfather to identify his men yet God called man not man cold man but old man not man appointed man but i anointed appointed destinated when God began an outdoors man what a rockin is gonna be because the people are trained to listen to the sky beneath Pharisees but Jesus came from the volume of the book not from the Pharisees not from the Sadducees not from the Minnesota Association he came from the volume of the book and he was Messiah and we declare massage is on the earth now [Applause] boss Messiah anointed word anointed word would come and don't mind my god and you have something as sad as you delicate take it or put it inside of you your father couldn't put it out your mother couldn't Potter don't you'll be false appearance tabular adultery fornication lying is that

efficient else you may be seated vision like a dream in real time you live in time you live in a book like a novel it's half past present future they could go to the mystery who do who kill who teeth and whatnot and you could spin the fate for one and see the answers but you owe to the book if they find it front too fast you go tell me back if you want is it hard to be the new fast I wonder what happened because could be hold show and go to the end you'll miss the drawing up all the way all M pages and whatnot but you're Shawn or the end because too much for you say it goes truth in the end

somebody to have some sense not somebody like you I said go say what you wish it Oh bother me but someday you'll regret it not long after that pass through the same city she was down the street with her under skirts hanging down slopping with a cigarette and a hand offered me a drink of whiskey and here's a testimony she said you remember the night you called me see that she said that was the truth the Spirit of God was testifying to me that night trying to get me to come and since that time I could see my mother soul fine hair like a pancake and laugh at it that's what happened you got to respect God I should we be living like a prostitute in street but she went to hell seal the soul away already we have people walking in hell hello that's why that's why what a man talk what the hell

fit let's go Eddie noise too bad you do not blend you see widget why are you not rich not in fit he's blind and he wanted site email Shibata Branum if you can't respect the man respect to office he who's in God that's exactly right we respect him if a minister comes up your posture always respect him after congressman's talk about their posture and run him down ridicule him how is that possibly gonna do anything for you he can't I don't say this church but I've seen churches or you got a lovely posture you gotta know he's a human being and yet God has made him his posture the Holy Ghost has made him overseer and then when you got to respect him in that manner listen I no matter what the past is done if you respect him in your heart as got7 God will respect you for doing it God will respect you for doing that so these wars you take these young kids talk about the young people on the army they're the cream of the crop cause they don't know no better knowing discipline army discipline stick a head up the hill let somebody shoot it off and the nation forgets them unless their family come back here many of soldiers but listener is but a man seldom will you find one that will lay down his life for the cause of Christ always think about that statement people find it for money bigger job bigger house want to do this and that and everything else but what about the sacrifice for Christ for God's sake listen they will lay down their life because of Christ you wouldn't even crawl out of a shade tree to go to church won't even get out from behind a television long enough to attend a Wednesday night perimeter that's right it's a shame and disgrace that's the reason angels don't visit the churches that's the reason angels don't visit homes you mean in terms of it assumes yes we have got to get down to deep sincerity of this thing that's why is disgusted to see the arrogance of people in this message as if God is obligated to them because they believe God's and a prophet God is not obligated to this with that at all what is obligated to his word because even the dead I believe and tremble so we have got the final higher because Jesus busted his own disciples and say you have to have righteousness bigger than love in your own checking your own eyes they've got to go beyond that to love even your enemies they're cut to go beyond that demonstrate that you are the higher class that is what this is about not to stay where you are but then lift your higher but somebody say man [Applause] notice whenever they call of God comes excuse me it always calls to

you one upon your life hallelujah blessing could be delayed but not denied Oh hallelujah praise thank you Jesus praise God there are many things that change trying changes people changes weather changes nature nation changes but God is unchangeable he's the same all the time God is an infinite God and we could we could use any word to explain the world or try to explain the word infinite he never had a beginning he will never had an end therefore when God calling us into act or to make a decision the way he acts the decision he makes that is forever the same he cannot change it because he is perfect now you and I could say certain things next year we have to change it maybe or do something different because we are finite we do not normal things but he is perfect and his first decision will have to be a second decision well after me like the first or if you make an incision then he is not a cure right when you make the first decision that will put him as finite as us so Kakadu something said of course coach I didn't realize it was gonna move soon not mean gorgeous Tigers but God can't do that so when he speaks his word that's why you can say by myself have I sworn

Him listen to this you could get any blessing you want in God you could wrassle God and get what you want from God you can harass and believe I'm not asking please until you get him I have to do something for that sister that mother I gotta ask it shall be given unto you seek and you shall find not don't hear me preaching it yet Jesus saying it [Applause] now the thing of it is God give it

Gordon expect us to name babies all along he acts as a coming to the knowledge of the Son of God your knowledge hallelujah praise God blessed be the name of the Lord so watch God gives it sometimes in

know that was lion professors get stoned you know because God is the author of truth that's why people say God told me and go to meta peoples be careful when you talk that talking so I'm gonna tell him at all and then line and God you can do that go to the line alright but abandoned I may not have fear to make all things that he done live again but I will never stand in the road of somebody who was fit enough to do it I would be thanking God for that feat hallelujah see the spirit and attitude the Prophet had he wouldn't go on hinder anybody who was free to step out to believe God I can go and record on this tonight if any people will take the right mental attitude there was any divine promise that God has ever made and claim it for yours here we go if you have the right mental attitude of any promise that God has made and claim it Furby as yours God will bring it to pass claim your healing claim your deliverance claim your bridge room clean your blessings clean your inheritance claim your portion don't sit and don't say nothing you have to be convinced that you need a word spoken for things that get activated happy you happy delivered I'm gonna get a break through the prison bars gonna open up you gotta speak some even now Lord we are you let him roll away the stone Lazarus come forth so Jesus couldn't go my last verse grave and said you're there he's there that's not the word we want easier you want him to come on from there Lazarus come forth you have to speak it what are you speaking you speak a negative you speak and you can make it the speaking you home this your wife this your husband this you speaking negative change what you speak [Music] you can make it you could come out yeah yeah amen you can be healed or praise God I won't be long again with you but but I'm Adam says the word is a seed I saw so and a seed if it is a German I'd see that goes into the ground then that seed under the right condition which Sun and moisture will bring forth the life that's in the seed so the Word of God if a person take it and press it in their heart create right atmosphere they're gonna produce itself so the key thing is to create the right atmosphere and the devil is fighting that atmosphere that Atma says what you can create create in your own home in your own heart you can choose not to whole odds you can choose not to have a grudge and in your heart have a right atmosphere and you're waiting upon God I can't bless you hallelujah praise God praise God the thing it is with people is the way God appears many times you want to make an idol out of God we ask God for something and then he must do it just do it when we ask it you get he calleth making an idol out of God I see people put I know somebody who said cut the Bible I think that's about disparate wake up early morning call a Bible verse the eyes fall on my descriptively day that he would our society by blanca mandela we're not supposed to play back tips and have TV knee touch to pre-paint back message cuz i don t coach who she's as an idol i said go to you that I wonder commanded testimony service listener diamond because he I'm not fitted another Freda should I'm the exit because we're not big and I'm bombing and trying to drag anybody's out of here especially especially religious ones one who know difficult is no more than appreciated no more than God himself God doesn't have that God have a word for you the people sit down and they're looking for what they dream that get confirmed I let the dream ring and the preacher on his errand they say they don't show me the real they are so important that God make sure if you just say that to confirm that what is seen is it and it's not so what you come here for is to get exposed that your life could be changed you want God to rip things out of you that's not like him you want all the hindrances in your life that affecting your communication with God and with others you want your life to be purged and purified oh my Logan some issue with some system but I said we conclusive here Moses was 80 years old almost you might think - all for God to deal with he was an old man unexpected in his age to be dealt with God and he was an unexpected place Mount Horeb and on an unexpected way God met Moses the way he usually met he didn't meet Moses the way usually admit men he met him with the pillar of fire isn't that right old man strange place but that God met him a certain way so no sometime he answers a prayer in the way he thinks is best I remember since that a dream she Jim she has grown to some dark waters some some some some troubling waters and so on and this brown skinned man was consoling or whatnot different things I don't know what not know she was a real a bullhead bullet spirit whenever her husband is back Sidon condition she and she's shoot you whenever husband started come straight no time Street hold on what not she will stay and with him and beat him don't decide until he back side so I see the spirit upon her son like that so he had his dream of this man talking to her and straighten talking down helping on solid earth so doing it dream now when I we get to talk to her and I'm straight not and showing her operations she said now I say I am that man in that dream you know she didn't believe dream after that I said this is your dream here being interpreted straight to know she didn't wanna she figure when you asked her husband I pray with I pray for him I pray for him a pretty film cuz she didn't whip them into in turn on entity ready whipping straight alternative because she so she's spiritually strong especially when he's weak she's strong when he began to get his strength to stop like a man in his own house forget it she stopped coming to church he under pressure in the stress and I know eventually everything break up all because she done what she do a humble self to the Word of God we all have to subject ourselves to the Word of God oh praise the name of the Lord so sometimes it may come as this guy's it becoming another way all wrong another way no matter what way it comes if we have two acts we shall receive God said so oh praise God no I was gonna wrap up here he said no the coming of the Lord no the common of Jesus is so imminent the coming of judgment he is calling his elected together in oneness with the particular church in Trinidad no it didn't say that in oneness with himself so when you hear oneness with some church or some pass or Bishop you know that is plumb off the beaten path it is oneness with himself and he is the word so what he's doing he's calling the elect out of the Lutheran's to make the Wesleyan he called the electron's and to make the Pentecostals now he is calling the elect and accustomed to make up the headstone that come into it he's going to come into it isn't that right and he is dropping the same kind of ministry amongst them it wouldn't be my ministry or ministry it'll be his ministry the Ministry of Jesus Christ and if it's his ministry it wouldn't be puffed up there will be arrogant wouldn't be know-it-all it wouldn't be above all and what it will be that it will be just what the Bible says hallelujah what about the talk about charity appear at all things believeth all things hopeth all things where's that everybody spiritually very superficial a baryon where is that one time Barbra was preaching and there was this man used a bit of preachers the man have a repetition okay is repetition went before him in Barbra mittens he had about 200 men on the platform behind him famous preachers back in the prophets in him and glory and sleeping sometimes when that man came up on the on the under in any congregation he bought you snake in the grass though actually beacon once maybe he didn't heard about him I went didn't saw him deacons leave their posts but that man came up in the meeting and they said you snake in the grass a hypocrite I wanna kill you and so on but a Brahmin is standing there and he's preaching and after a while as the man get closer he spoke these words you have to say something he says you shall fall over my before because you challenged the Spirit of God you will fall over my feet not fall at my feet over my feet the man came up walk out on a platform of course the two hundred brethren behind there were no longer on the platform so they leave this big 200 pounds man the face this five foot short guy on the platform alone the man walk up on the platform as a man comment about a Branham he said come out of him but before he said that he said al of kin for that man he said maybe the man as a husband that man is a father he doesn't want to be in that condition whatever I love for him as a man says it and come up reminds spinor wrong and fall over his feet as he prophesied that'll lift the man off of him before that somebody said call the police the church police about nun pose call the outside police but about him says this is not a flesh and blood of fear ah hallelujah a flesh and blood did not flesh and blood business this is this is something else the acts are questioned but a Branham was that man delivered he said no he said he worships that spirit he loved it he said if you love whatever you have in your heart you will do we could talk no tell me gray turn black and come back Greek as long as you are something in your heart that that's why you had a heart surgery you have to have the right desires inside of your ass got to work on your heart got to have the right desires because you ride his ass give you the right aim ambition motive and objective and once that lineup is bull's eye never had a man when once you have that heart for God it's bullseye that's why God called David a man after my own heart because regardless of what David problem he had he loved God get a heart for God he will fight for God he will cut off next for God you will do whatever for God God first that's David or give the Lord a show when you leave you have a heart for God revolution book of Silver's he said if you've got the Holy Spirit in you then you are candidate for Association but the unseen world and the supernatural
