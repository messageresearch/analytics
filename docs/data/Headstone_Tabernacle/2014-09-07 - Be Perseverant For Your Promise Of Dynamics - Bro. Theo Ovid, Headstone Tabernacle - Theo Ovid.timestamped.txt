[8:15] reading from matthew chapter 15
[8:18] reading verse 21 then jesus
[8:23] went dense and departed onto the coast
[8:25] of tai and sidon and behold a woman of
[8:29] canaan came out of the same coast and
[8:31] cried at him saying
[8:33] have mercy on me o lord
[8:35] thou son of david my daughter is
[8:37] curiously vexed with the devil
[8:40] but he answered another word
[8:42] and the disciples came and besought him
[8:44] saying send her away for she cried after
[8:47] us
[8:48] and he answered and said i am not sent
[8:50] but unto the lord sheep of the house of
[8:53] israel
[8:54] then came she and worshipped him saying
[8:57] lord
[8:58] help me
[9:00] but he answered and said it is not meat
[9:03] to take the children's bread
[9:05] and cast it to dogs
[9:07] and she said
[9:09] truth lord
[9:10] yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which
[9:13] fall from their master's table
[9:15] then jesus answered and said unto her o
[9:18] woman
[9:20] great is thy faith be it unto zee even
[9:23] as dog built
[9:24] and a daughter
[9:26] was made whole
[9:28] from that very hour
[9:30] and reading from romans
[9:32] chapter four
[9:33] i'm going to read from verse 19 to 21.
[9:37] speaking about abraham and being that we
[9:39] can fate he considered not his own body
[9:41] now dead when he was about a hundred
[9:44] years old
[9:45] neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb
[9:48] he staggered not at the promise of god
[9:51] true unbelief
[9:52] but was strong in faith giving glory to
[9:54] god
[9:55] and being
[9:57] fully persuaded
[9:58] that what he had promised he was able
[10:01] also to perform let's pray father we
[10:03] thank you
[10:04] for your holy word
[10:06] and what consolation we have
[10:08] in the scriptures
[10:10] even jesus had full confidence in the
[10:12] scriptures
[10:14] that he said destroy this body and
[10:15] treaties i'll raise it up because of
[10:17] david's word i shall not suffer my holy
[10:20] one to see corruption or leave his soul
[10:22] in hell
[10:23] father help us this night this evening
[10:26] that we can have such full confidence
[10:27] and faith in your word
[10:29] knowing that your word can't fail
[10:31] heavens will pass away but you will will
[10:33] never pass away or we thank you for the
[10:35] blessed assurance that your word is true
[10:38] that your word is you that your word is
[10:40] real confirm your word this evening in
[10:42] jesus mighty ask it amen amen you will
[10:45] be seated oh praise the name of the lord
[10:48] for title this evening
[10:50] be perseverant
[10:52] for your promise of dynamics
[10:54] that's the title this evening be
[10:56] perseverant
[10:57] for your promise of dynamics another
[11:00] inspiration summer quote
[11:03] uh from brother branham message
[11:04] perseverance he said what we need today
[11:07] is a man and a woman who will take god
[11:10] by his word
[11:11] and be persistent with it
[11:14] that's what we need a man or woman that
[11:16] will take god by his word
[11:19] and be persistent with it
[11:21] perseverance the quality that allows
[11:24] someone
[11:25] to continue trying to do something
[11:29] even though it is difficult
[11:32] perseverant able or willing to persevere
[11:37] and i want to bring something from this
[11:39] message called perseverance
[11:40] amber
[11:43] to the people
[11:44] and he said perseverance means to be
[11:46] persistent
[11:47] to make a goal
[11:49] faith is the substance of things hoped
[11:51] for the evidence of things not seen we
[11:53] have a body like a seed a seed on the
[11:56] outside as a shell inside the shell is a
[11:58] crust or a pulp
[12:00] and a germ that's the way we are body
[12:02] soul spirit
[12:04] and the body has five senses say ct
[12:06] smell here
[12:07] to the soul
[12:09] and so forth inside one avenue that
[12:11] avenue is the place that god set every
[12:14] man from adam and eve self-will
[12:17] you will to live
[12:19] or you will to die
[12:21] either one you want to it is based on
[12:23] free moral agency
[12:26] and whatever spirit listen that you let
[12:29] dominate you
[12:30] will bring forth the fruits
[12:32] your life
[12:34] will be dominated by the inside
[12:37] so regardless of what people say
[12:39] your life
[12:41] is dominated by what is on the inside of
[12:44] you
[12:45] so if you let fate dominate your life it
[12:48] will reflect on the outside if you let
[12:50] doubt dominate your life it'll also
[12:52] reflect on the outside so many people
[12:54] rely on these outside senses they're
[12:56] fine nothing against them
[12:57] if they agree with the sixth sense
[13:00] this spirit can be only two kinds one is
[13:02] the spirit of god the other is the
[13:04] spirit of the devil
[13:06] you can't serve two masters at the same
[13:08] time
[13:09] you either give one or you give the
[13:11] other so if you've got a spirit of god
[13:12] in you you've got faith and you believe
[13:14] every word that god said
[13:16] now the devil is not like some people
[13:18] think he's mean and everything but he's
[13:20] deceitful the devil make you think
[13:22] you're right and when you disagree with
[13:24] the world that shows that it isn't the
[13:26] spirit of god because the holy spirit
[13:28] wrote the bible
[13:29] there has got to be agreeable with the
[13:30] word isn't that right so you can't hunt
[13:33] for wisdom you have to stay with the
[13:35] word
[13:36] doctor persevere to be persistent is to
[13:39] make a goal you've got to set your mind
[13:41] on something you got to be persistent in
[13:43] it because you believe it's the thing
[13:45] that you want you believe you can get it
[13:48] hallelujah is dynamic the thing you want
[13:51] do you believe you can get it yeah
[13:53] praise god now watch you've got to in
[13:56] your mind made up of what you're going
[13:58] to do
[13:59] now you cannot have faith in god without
[14:00] knowing the word of god or knowing
[14:02] something about god isn't that right
[14:04] blessed are the name of the lord christ
[14:07] when he was on earth was the body of god
[14:09] god created this body
[14:11] isn't that right someone built him a
[14:13] house hobby the most i don't dwell in
[14:15] houses made with hands but a body has
[14:17] not prepared me no god prepared himself
[14:20] a body in the form of the lord jesus
[14:22] which was the christ meaning the
[14:23] anointed one now all i was in god he
[14:25] poured into christ he was the fullness
[14:27] of the godhead bodily and all of his
[14:30] christ he poured into the church what is
[14:32] it anointed one to continue his work
[14:36] so christ's work must be continued
[14:39] through a body
[14:41] a bright body this time his body
[14:43] hallelujah so in other words you become
[14:46] mrs jesus christ by coming into his body
[14:49] and you become god's mechanic on the
[14:51] earth isn't that right
[14:53] hallelujah you believe that
[14:55] now god can't change if god made a
[14:57] decision it has to remain that way if he
[14:59] changes then he's human like i am
[15:02] he is just a man that can make a mistake
[15:04] but he's infinite
[15:06] and he's omnipotent he cannot make a
[15:08] mystic and be god
[15:10] so his first decision when man sin he
[15:13] forgive him on the basis of believing
[15:14] the word the second man come he's got to
[15:17] act the same way isn't that right you
[15:19] have got to have faith in what you're
[15:21] doing
[15:22] and if your heart condemns us not then
[15:25] we have faith isn't that right now you
[15:27] cannot get yourself together
[15:31] because you know there's things there
[15:33] that god teaches that you will not cope
[15:34] with
[15:35] so if your life is not coping with the
[15:37] word you have a problem to get faith to
[15:40] receive what god say because your heart
[15:42] sits there condemned but once your life
[15:45] begins to cope with the word every
[15:47] promise is here
[15:48] every promise is true
[15:50] everybody says amen there is no
[15:52] condemnation in your heart as a believer
[15:55] you have access to your father
[15:57] isn't that right
[15:58] do you believe that
[16:00] so therefore you can't come up here and
[16:01] said i want to be healed and last night
[16:03] i was drunk all day lord hear me this
[16:05] morning i won't drink too much more
[16:07] you've got to surrender yourself you've
[16:09] got to give yourself completely to god
[16:10] you've got to obey the word steroid
[16:13] completely
[16:15] when god speaks to a man here we go
[16:18] he has ambition
[16:20] and he has papers
[16:22] and that is why you have to hear from
[16:24] god
[16:26] and that is why people follow people
[16:28] because they're not hearing from god
[16:30] so they trust the people that they're
[16:31] following that they hear from god but
[16:34] they themselves don't hear themselves
[16:36] and that's why jesus asks his disciples
[16:38] who do men say i am
[16:39] then he asks who do you say i am and
[16:42] peter said that what the christ peter
[16:44] who are direct from heaven
[16:46] oh hallelujah
[16:48] he didn't ask james and anybody else he
[16:51] said what the christ the son of the
[16:53] living god he could pronounce his
[16:55] confession because he got a revelation
[16:58] once you get a revelation you can
[16:59] confess it
[17:00] but it got to be according to the word
[17:03] god only reveal his word
[17:05] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[17:08] so when god speaks to a man he gives
[17:10] them faith
[17:11] that's why amram and joseph didn't hide
[17:13] moses
[17:14] under the bed
[17:16] they take that baby and put them to sail
[17:18] right right in the midst of alligators
[17:20] they put them to sail into the arms of
[17:22] pharaoh why because when god speaks to a
[17:24] man he has faith
[17:26] not fear
[17:27] he has faith you know you're gonna get a
[17:30] breakthrough you know you're gonna get
[17:31] delivered you know you're gonna get a
[17:33] victory you know you're gonna get
[17:35] touched
[17:36] hallelujah you know that because god put
[17:39] a faith
[17:40] tongue inside your soul
[17:42] hallelujah so when god speaks to a man
[17:45] he has faith
[17:47] in god
[17:48] hallelujah not what the doctor say what
[17:51] god said
[17:52] not what the results of the test say
[17:54] what god said
[17:56] oh hallelujah the test is negative but
[17:59] god say i am positive
[18:01] you are going to be healed
[18:03] oh give the lord praise his people
[18:06] when god speaks to a man
[18:08] he has faith he has ambition i like that
[18:12] ambition when you have no ambition you
[18:15] have problems
[18:16] serious problem any days any day
[18:19] yesterday and today is the same they
[18:20] don't have to have that tomorrow you
[18:22] cooled right through you have no
[18:24] ambition you got where you are you don't
[18:26] need to progress you don't need to pray
[18:30] you don't need to do anything at all you
[18:32] just dear you under existence
[18:35] you have no growth no maturity
[18:38] hallelujah you think you think you're
[18:40] just staying in some cocoon somewhere no
[18:42] ambition no goals nothing excites you
[18:46] nothing boos you you don't have nothing
[18:48] to achieve when you wake up in the
[18:50] morning you just wake up in the morning
[18:52] you don't feel to wake up and say today
[18:54] is a great deal i'm getting closer to
[18:56] where i want to go too i have a name i
[18:59] have a vision i have a purpose that's
[19:01] what having a vision is that's what our
[19:03] ambition is it makes you get up from
[19:05] jericho and head down to bethel it makes
[19:08] you get it from bethel and hector to
[19:11] jordan that's what purpose is that's
[19:13] what goal is it make you sick of
[19:16] yourself until i want a revival it makes
[19:19] you sick of where you are and stay away
[19:22] you want to go
[19:32] no ambition
[19:34] the job you have you like it
[19:36] because you not i'm not be sure to go
[19:38] further
[19:39] ambition me more work more
[19:40] responsibility more orders more
[19:43] comfortability you don't want to be
[19:44] accountability so you doubt
[19:46] responsibility because responsibility
[19:48] carries accountability ambition is a
[19:50] powerful thing let my people go and they
[19:52] go they have no more excuse they can't
[19:54] be in pharaoh they can't blame his
[19:56] horsemen they are out of egypt no
[19:58] horsemen behind them no licks behind
[20:01] them no whip behind them they only have
[20:03] a here man
[20:04] line to
[20:11] and some people said give me across the
[20:14] border because say all right you want to
[20:15] water across there come and fight food
[20:17] and then go back wanna go back they go
[20:18] back
[20:20] fight with everybody else
[20:22] when the first fight go back and take a
[20:23] portion
[20:24] before there
[20:26] so when god speaks so many as fate
[20:28] he has ambition and he has purpose
[20:31] so therefore if i know you have no
[20:32] purpose god will speak to you you are
[20:35] dead
[20:36] you are laodicean you have a badge mark
[20:38] laudisia you flashing audition all them
[20:41] demons seen now there's a past passing
[20:43] straight he's a church member passing
[20:45] straight as ever she have allowed
[20:48] that wretched poor miserable blind they
[20:50] don't even know it leave them let them
[20:51] go and send a message leave them let
[20:53] them go and go to the church leave them
[20:55] leave them but you see that bride
[20:56] they're different boy they're hungering
[20:58] they have telstra they are passionate
[21:09] watch when god speaks to a man he gives
[21:11] him a purpose when god speaks to a man
[21:14] he gives him ambition when god speaks to
[21:16] a man he gave him faith to do it
[21:19] to accomplish
[21:21] or to achieve
[21:23] what his purpose is in life
[21:26] what god called him to do
[21:29] and he called us to be the church of god
[21:38] not to be in a church
[21:40] to be the church
[21:42] and the church is his body i want you to
[21:44] catch what we're talking about when we
[21:45] say church we're not talking about this
[21:47] building we're not talking about here
[21:48] we're talking about being in his body
[21:51] that's your calling is not right
[21:53] so let's just make it our purpose in
[21:55] life to see that we are the church of
[21:58] god let's have ambition not sit around
[22:01] because of jones is what do we care
[22:03] about it

[29:12] and actually see nothing there's
[29:17] you could see that
[29:18] there is nothing
[29:19] after 40 plus years i've been leaving a
[29:22] message there's nothing
[29:24] there is nothing you mean you
[29:26] communicate all these years and days
[29:28] nothing run again
[29:30] go and see again
[29:31] run again
[29:33] see again run again hallelujah run again

[29:46] oh glory to god run again
[29:52] you run seven times you know i run
[29:54] sometimes because elijah wasn't taking

[30:01] nothing is nothing you can't come back
[30:03] with nothing come back with something he
[30:06] said i see a cloud like um i gotta say
[30:09] what run

[30:12] it's that small but
[30:15] rain is coming i hear the sound of the
[30:19] abundance of red you better begin to
[30:22] persevere to your promise of dynamics
[30:30] each one of you
[30:32] each individual
[30:33] begin to understand begin to anointed
[30:36] afresh you each one of you be like
[30:39] simeon
[30:40] god must reveal to you you're gonna get
[30:42] the holy ghost god must reveal to you
[30:45] that this revival is yours it's not your
[30:48] children
[30:49] it's your own come on come on come on
[30:51] now come on
[30:58] i don't have permission to put people in
[31:00] the right
[31:01] or all the bride
[31:03] so really and truly we don't know who
[31:04] really is the bride
[31:06] that mystery is in god
[31:08] i have permission to preach the word
[31:10] your permission to receive it
[31:12] believe it and act upon it i have
[31:14] permission to be convinced this is the
[31:16] truth
[31:17] that many people right now all over the
[31:18] internet they're coming against brother
[31:20] brown coming against the message they
[31:21] don't want to quote abraham they don't
[31:22] believe the prophet no more all kind of
[31:24] foolishness but i believe this is a
[31:27] genuine malachi 4 20th century prophet
[31:30] that brought a message and god is
[31:32] allowing the critics the skeptics to
[31:33] make believers all of them to be exposed
[31:35] because god could only work through true
[31:36] believers so after 40 plus years god
[31:40] filtering you see the first filter was
[31:42] big holes in it the big big unbelief
[31:44] fall right through then you have smaller
[31:46] holes
[31:47] that's it but afterwards the rest that
[31:49] remain is true believer
[31:50] all the unbelief
[31:52] god shaken the camp
[31:54] god shake it in the 70s in the 80s and
[31:58] the 90s shake in the camp shaking
[32:01] filtering because you want to get some
[32:04] people who can become his voice
[32:06] who become his body who become the final
[32:09] voice who become his very word itself
[32:11] he's got the finer people that wouldn't
[32:14] move one iota so what he has promised
[32:17] because what he has promised he has able
[32:19] to perform
[32:21] what he has promised
[32:27] what this promise
[32:30] god is able to perform
[32:31] so i have no problem with even the
[32:33] gonna walk
[32:34] because god promised it i have no
[32:36] problem believing this name will be
[32:37] restored because god promised it i am
[32:40] not responsible keeping it to bring it
[32:42] to pass i'm responsible to make myself
[32:45] available to be a channel in which god
[32:47] can use because you can make yourself
[32:49] available to god if god could use a
[32:52] donkey god could use me come on
[32:54] come on now if god could
[32:58] that's a measly fate
[33:01] that's a low one call it a low blue if
[33:03] god could use a donkey's reason
[33:06] god could use me donkey donkey
[33:08] don't you have no soul
[33:11] god use a donkey
[33:13] surely god could use me
[33:15] yeah yeah god can fix me up
[33:17] hallelujah god could make me a
[33:19] thoroughbred horse
[33:20] hey god could change my desires
[33:23] yeah i want the world into the world i
[33:25] have these styles out there i find
[33:26] myself looking in magazines but god
[33:27] could change that
[33:28] and that's how you have to begin to
[33:30] speak to yourself you have to tell
[33:31] yourself something oh glory to god you
[33:34] have to tell yourself something that's
[33:36] the problem you're talking the wrong
[33:38] thing
[33:39] you're on selfies tell yourself
[33:41] something that's the selfie to have i'm
[33:43] going to tell myself i'm going to arrive
[33:46] i'm going to go to my father take a
[33:48] picture of yourself saying that take a
[33:50] little video of yourself that's the
[33:51] right selfie speak it to yourself i'm
[33:54] going to be a christian and take a
[33:56] little video clip of that i'm going to
[33:58] be overcomer or give the lord some
[34:00] praises and when you're feeling dumb
[34:03] play it back
[34:04] when you're feeling low play it back
[34:11] oh
[34:12] we worship him
[34:14] worship him
[34:17] let's make our purpose in life to see
[34:20] the fear the church of god
[34:22] moses he had ambition
[34:24] never was he the same after that
[34:26] he had ambition he has something to work
[34:28] to watch too and that's why some of you
[34:30] wouldn't even testify invite people
[34:32] because you're not even inviting
[34:33] yourself into the presence of the king
[34:36] i understand now

[34:39] you're dead
[34:41] we just need some coffins

[34:49] and not testify of how you get saved
[34:52] when you get saved and of your you can't
[34:54] have friends and don't tell them about
[34:56] the lord

[38:13] all the days of his life he saved god to
[38:14] deliver those people
[38:16] as long as he was getting along all
[38:18] right what he cared about was those
[38:20] people in their suffering that was moses
[38:23] burden
[38:24] he was living his life to deliver the
[38:26] people with his mental conception his
[38:29] intellectual revelation he killed one
[38:30] man and ran but moses was packed with a
[38:33] burden
[38:34] do you have a burden today
[38:36] a burden in this church a burden for
[38:38] dynamics a boon for a revival a burden
[38:40] for breakthrough a burden to see people
[38:42] delivered
[38:43] i'm not talking about talking about
[38:44] people that is the easy one you don't
[38:46] even have waiting for that just open
[38:47] them up and yap i'm talking about a
[38:49] burden that you guys say you know what i
[38:51] know my sister in trouble i'm a brother
[38:52] in trouble i'm going to pray for them
[38:54] i'm going to ask for god to deliver them
[38:56] i'm going to call them i'm going to help
[38:58] them i'm going to encourage them i'm
[39:00] going to back them up i'm going to hold
[39:02] them up
[39:05] even if they kind of get somebody on the
[39:06] phone or whatnot they can still get them
[39:08] up in prayer
[39:09] lift them up before god
[39:11] isn't that right
[39:13] but i'm saying people god still hear
[39:15] people crying out unto god and you talk
[39:17] about the sister the woman who died and
[39:19] she swallowed something called radium
[39:21] and years after they still find with
[39:23] them thinking on her bones and he's
[39:25] saying this here he said watch oh
[39:27] brother if radium have that kind of
[39:28] effect unless how much more will unless
[39:30] eternal supernatural all-powerful
[39:32] infinite almighty god have the same
[39:34] effect this all-powerful god is waiting
[39:38] for somebody with bully fate to step out
[39:41] and challenge the enemy on the basis of
[39:43] his word
[39:44] oh hallelujah when elijah
[39:48] they're from second half
[39:50] after his whole heart desire was to get
[39:52] that promise
[39:53] he wanted the promise that was his
[39:55] motive that was all he has that was his
[39:58] life that was his intent everything all
[40:01] every hung on getting that promise
[40:04] that's the whole every time you wake up
[40:06] in the morning the promise
[40:08] simeon the promise abraham the promise
[40:11] if i'm going to mark it but he's
[40:13] starting to promise at him
[40:14] oh yeah boy i'm going great but god
[40:17] promised me
[40:19] hallelujah you're going abraham hopes
[40:21] you have a sign i am promised a baby
[40:25] not everybody didn't like that sign
[40:27] who would like that sign everybody say
[40:29] old man but abram only laughing and
[40:31] rejoicing because he already had isaac
[40:34] isaac was in faith inside his soul
[40:36] so he could shout he can't produce it
[40:38] yet but it's a revelation to him
[40:40] revelation comes to the individual
[40:42] listen you have an internet call to
[40:44] share you can share this and share that
[40:45] you can share revelation
[40:50] i'll say it again you cannot share a
[40:53] revelation you have no button to click
[40:56] share with revelation you can testify
[40:58] your revelation but revelation is
[41:00] personal and individual revelation is
[41:03] your own that's your button when god
[41:06] reveal it to you it's yours
[41:08] no faith is so when abraham is quickened
[41:11] to him his precious wife he is so close
[41:15] to it wasn't quitting to her that is why
[41:17] she could have a good laugh
[41:21] but that was his wife she could laugh
[41:23] because she doesn't have what god
[41:25] revealed to abraham and when god
[41:27] revealed it to you your sister could
[41:29] laugh your mother could laugh your
[41:30] brother could laugh your husband could
[41:31] laugh but you can't laugh because you
[41:33] have a revelation of what god has
[41:35] revealed to you could we say amen
[41:38] here's the prophet now
[41:40] i'm persuaded that we are not sincere
[41:42] about the things that we're talking
[41:43] about
[41:44] if your whole motive this morning
[41:47] rest upon giving god praise for my
[41:49] healing i'm determined to be healed by
[41:52] the power of god
[41:53] this is brother branham now this is the
[41:55] attitude you have to have
[41:56] i am determined to live a christian life
[41:59] i am determined to walk in peace with
[42:01] god i am determined to do it i don't
[42:04] care what mother say what church say
[42:06] what pastor say what anybody else say
[42:08] what the world say i am determined
[42:10] that's the singleness of my heart you
[42:13] are going to get somewhere there
[42:14] oh hallelujah
[42:16] praise god and brother i'm talking about
[42:18] elijah we heard it this morning second
[42:20] hand robe don't you put somebody else
[42:22] robe that's more eating with doubts
[42:25] where all these defeats and superstition
[42:27] and ups and downs has put holes in it
[42:29] leaking all through
[42:30] put on the robe of the conqueror don't
[42:32] trust in your church who once taught
[42:34] salvation by the baptism holy ghost who
[42:36] once taught divine healing and now we
[42:38] have mort and doubts put on the robe of
[42:40] him that never lost the battle
[42:43] and you're on your way to jordan
[42:45] brother what you need you'll find your
[42:47] luck too when you come to jordan you may
[42:49] be taught you may be smart you may have
[42:51] doctor of divinity my phd philosophy
[42:53] doctor of latin all kind of degrees you
[42:56] may have the robe of the methodist
[42:57] church you have your own pentecostal
[42:59] church only a second arrow to begin with
[43:01] some man-made dogmas to comfort like
[43:03] that
[43:04] but even if you're a christian
[43:05] he said today
[43:07] what about some preacher he said today
[43:11] with many school and educated scholars
[43:12] with many men who can tear the bible
[43:14] apart and settle together in mathematics
[43:17] many men who can tell you great things
[43:19] in the way of teaching who knows bible
[43:21] history to the very moment who could
[43:23] tell you that the our hell was lit on
[43:26] the oh it went out
[43:29] that's how deep these mens are
[43:31] they could tell thee our
[43:33] hell got lit
[43:35] and how it went out
[43:37] they can tell you these things they've
[43:40] got spiritual baptisms more kind of
[43:41] thing but when you come to jordan to the
[43:43] face the critical world what did he cry
[43:45] nobody elisha where is the god of elijah

[43:50] elijah that done it it was the power of
[43:52] god of elijah and i've done it
[43:54] and the thing that the world needs today
[43:56] this morning is the power of the god of
[43:58] elijah
[43:59] you might have spoken tongues you might
[44:01] have run up the floor
[44:03] watch a secondhand robe was all right
[44:05] but he needed a fresh call in his heart
[44:08] from god
[44:10] you need a fresh anointed from god
[44:13] he wore a second-handed robe when he
[44:14] come to the river but he needed a brand
[44:16] new fullest hand call from god
[44:20] our first unpower to perform the
[44:22] miracles
[44:24] acts 1 8 you shall receive power
[44:26] after the holy ghost come upon you isn't
[44:28] that right oh blessed be so what are
[44:31] they looking for what more do you want
[44:33] what does the church want
[44:35] he said everybody looking for messiah
[44:37] what does the church really on what are
[44:38] you looking for actors what am i looking
[44:40] for what are you looking for here he
[44:42] said we already got it
[44:44] god give it to us
[44:46] it's his promise for the hour
[44:50] that is what you're supposed to be
[44:52] looking for
[44:54] the promise of the oh what's the promise
[44:56] dynamics
[44:57] you shall receive power
[44:59] you already got the promise
[45:02] hallelujah
[45:04] listen to this we look in the bible we
[45:06] see it everywhere through the bible
[45:08] anointed ones come on and make that wood
[45:10] live again
[45:11] right in the hour for the hour we have
[45:13] cut the messiah it's him the word
[45:17] say in the beginning was the word it's
[45:18] just waiting for somebody with faith to
[45:21] anoint it and make it live again
[45:24] oh that's beautiful
[45:26] so think about it now all the promises
[45:27] are there
[45:28] the messiah is right here he's not
[45:30] coming he is here the messiah is the
[45:33] word the promised word for the hour just
[45:36] waiting for somebody with faith to
[45:38] anoint it and faith is based on
[45:42] oh hallelujah so therefore you still
[45:44] have to come to broadly love
[45:46] you still have to come to the honey to
[45:48] have the faith anointed let's take a
[45:50] look at that woman she came to jesus she
[45:53] had a lot of effects for the devil oh
[45:54] she had plenty disappointments her
[45:56] disciples couldn't handle her and then
[45:58] jesus said it's not fit to take the
[45:59] children's bread and cast at the door
[46:01] but when faith is anchored
[46:03] you could perceive here when faith is in
[46:05] your soul
[46:06] you don't have disappointments because
[46:08] you just bind this appointment
[46:10] when jesus said it's not fit to take the
[46:12] children's breath and cast a dog that
[46:15] didn't draw off she didn't stop coming
[46:17] to church she didn't give up on god she
[46:20] stood right there you see faith makes
[46:22] you stand
[46:24] faith make you persevere say how i'm not
[46:27] going to give up
[46:29] i'm going to stay right here
[46:31] till something happens
[46:33] that's what faith does
[46:35] that's how faith works
[46:37] real fit perseverance real fear press to
[46:41] watch the promise so the bible said
[46:43] abraham staggered not at the promise of
[46:46] god through unbelief but was strong
[46:49] worshiping he was strong praising he was
[46:52] strong smiling when he come to church
[46:54] because he knew every day isaac was
[46:56] coming closer
[46:58] every day the promise was coming more
[47:00] real
[47:01] every day he was nearer to his revival
[47:04] every day he was nearer to his
[47:05] deliverance every day he was narrow to
[47:08] his healing every day he was narrow to
[47:11] his feeling that's what fate does
[47:19] the church
[47:20] sits spiritually dead
[47:27] hardly know what to do one running this
[47:29] way one that way and here every promise
[47:32] that god made in the bible every one of
[47:34] them is lean just as good as it ever was
[47:41] what make the church like this laodicea
[47:44] she has to come that way
[47:46] oh praise god
[47:48] now here we go from the absolute
[47:51] every great achievement
[47:53] has been
[47:55] tied to an absolute
[47:57] not achievement
[47:59] every great achievement
[48:01] and there's got to be something
[48:04] a final time post
[48:06] and no man cannot by no means achieve
[48:08] anything
[48:09] unless
[48:10] they're recognized as an absolute and
[48:13] paul and the absolute he's afraid with a
[48:15] christ-centered life
[48:16] so what brother brahma is saying you
[48:17] cannot achieve much if it will come to
[48:19] an absolute well i don't know if this is
[48:22] right because somebody doing this
[48:24] somebody you're doing that you have no
[48:26] absolute absolute is the red light red
[48:28] light cannot mean go
[48:31] that gonna be massive confusion
[48:34] red supposed to mean absolutely stop
[48:38] green means absolutely go
[48:40] that is an absolute
[48:42] umpire absolute money is out man is out
[48:45] is a goal there's no goal blow the
[48:47] whistle you're out off the field
[48:50] walk whatever your passing is final
[48:53] if you don't have empire it will be
[48:55] right in every match
[48:57] so you have to have the umpire you have
[48:58] to have the lights you have to have an
[49:00] absolute one time hitler was an absolute
[49:02] ever hitler say everybody yes sir no sir
[49:05] hitler's divorce
[49:06] but that was bogus absolute
[49:08] but we have an absolute absolute is the
[49:10] word
[49:15] don't know how to say this here but you
[49:16] don't have skills but hit a full scale
[49:19] hit somebody with full skill falls thing
[49:22] on the scale and some people use false
[49:24] skills they use one skill for themselves
[49:26] and one skill and change skills quick to
[49:27] change to judge somebody else so the us
[49:30] skills to suit yourself that's not
[49:32] absolute you're shifting skills you're
[49:34] shifting your weight the same way you
[49:36] judge you have to go consistent
[49:38] you have to use the same plumb line you
[49:39] can't say this is for my family and
[49:40] that's not for yours this is church not
[49:42] for that church no it got to be the same
[49:44] scale and when you see the same skill
[49:46] that's the absolute the word
[49:47] so you don't have feelings in it and
[49:49] emotions it's just the word
[49:51] hallelujah that is what the absolute is
[49:54] the word
[49:56] oh praise god i'm going to wrap up here
[49:59] the reason that
[50:00] paul
[50:01] had a christ-centered life
[50:04] because he personally lay aside his
[50:07] teaching and he preached only met christ
[50:09] quite like that
[50:11] he really met christ
[50:13] so he wasn't just taught and had
[50:15] knowledge and information and revelation
[50:18] he met
[50:19] christ by way of the pillar of fire
[50:21] and when you meet christ and the only
[50:24] way you're going to ever know him is to
[50:25] meet him
[50:26] to know him is life
[50:29] not even to know his word as good as it
[50:30] may be you've got to know him to know
[50:33] him's life to know him his life and when
[50:35] your life's changed you make you make it
[50:37] make you do things you ordinary will not
[50:39] do
[50:40] he says like a ship a ship of an
[50:42] absolute that's the anchor
[50:44] when the ship is tossed in you could put
[50:45] the anchor it will hold and if christ
[50:49] here we go is your absolute you are tied
[50:52] to him in a manner no matter what
[50:53] anybody says how hard the persecution
[50:55] gets how bad the storm seems to be how
[50:58] it looks impossible for it to happen
[50:59] it's something has to happen to you
[51:01] christ becomes your absolute on any
[51:04] promise and the bible becomes your
[51:05] absolute if you are sick you are praying
[51:07] for healing and something strikes you
[51:10] i've got it nothing going to shake you
[51:12] from it
[51:13] amen
[51:14] here we go
[51:16] what the christian needs today in this
[51:18] atomic age in this time of incidency you
[51:21] need something besides just an
[51:23] experience of joining church
[51:25] you need an anchor
[51:26] an absolute that you know
[51:28] because here we go churches will
[51:31] fail
[51:36] might want to admit it but that is what
[51:37] the prophet said
[51:39] i am not a prophet i believe a prophet
[51:42] so if he said that i have to believe
[51:44] that
[51:45] churches
[51:46] will
[51:47] fail
[51:48] people will
[51:50] fail but christ cannot fail
[51:54] so christ is the absolute
[51:56] to the believer
[51:58] and if christ is your absolute you are
[52:00] tied to him
[52:02] not the church
[52:05] to him
[52:06] so if the church failed that's not you
[52:12] you heard what david said
[52:14] do 10 000 fall on my right side
[52:18] action let me move
[52:21] that is them
[52:24] they have nothing to do with me
[52:26] that is ten thousand on my right side i
[52:29] am on this
[52:30] side they're on that side
[52:34] that's david the lord is with me
[52:38] thyroid and stuff they comfort me
[52:43] don't prepare the table for me in the
[52:44] presence of my enemy david had a
[52:46] relationship with god
[52:48] a personal one
[52:52] when he get in trouble identity oh lord
[52:54] have i sinned
[52:56] david know he sinned against god so he
[52:58] came to god and confessed
[53:00] restore unto me
[53:03] the joy
[53:07] david recognized the joy gone
[53:09] but he know he's a son
[53:11] restore unto me the joy god i'm not
[53:15] feeling good
[53:16] oh give the lord praises
[53:22] so you do have joy by the time you
[53:24] repent and ask god to restore your joy
[53:26] and when you repent and ask god to
[53:27] restore here comes your joy
[53:29] then david i was glad when they said
[53:31] unto me what let us go into the house of
[53:33] the lord then they get that joy to come
[53:34] to service they get a joy to come to
[53:36] church they get a joy to worship a joy
[53:38] to hear the word of god it becomes your
[53:40] joy
[53:46] amen
[53:51] so you know
[53:52] if the red doesn't mean red he said
[53:54] don't watch you have a big traffic jam
[53:57] it's kind of a rude way to express it
[53:59] but yet you know what i'm trying to say
[54:00] notice the reason we have gotten to it
[54:02] there because every one of us make our
[54:05] own absolute
[54:07] i cannot selfie absolutely they already
[54:10] making their own
[54:12] we have our own absolute each church has
[54:14] this absolute each group has its own
[54:16] absolute and they say each one and say
[54:18] we are the truth the way we got it all
[54:20] you ain't got nothing to do with it
[54:22] you and a minority we are the greatest
[54:24] group and people do that you ought not
[54:26] to do that
[54:27] until it's like the days of judges where
[54:29] every man does what's right in his sight
[54:32] he thinks
[54:33] he is right in his own side but there's
[54:34] a way to see him right unto mine
[54:36] and the end thereof is the way of death
[54:38] but the bible said people did that
[54:40] because the word of god was precious
[54:41] they didn't have a prophet
[54:43] and if we didn't have a prophetic
[54:44] message that we could go back to
[54:46] to tie ourselves back to it we'll be in
[54:48] big trouble
[54:50] he said we want to live life is the
[54:51] greatest treasure that man can have i
[54:53] know we've got to find what is life he
[54:55] said my word is life he's the same
[54:56] yesterday today and forever you have got
[54:58] to get the living word in you to have
[55:00] the living god in you because the word
[55:02] here is god when it's made flesh in you
[55:05] made spirit and life in you when it goes
[55:09] into your flesh and your faith and
[55:11] becomes life
[55:14] not just your faith you have to go in
[55:15] your flesh too the way that the sins you
[55:18] the world have to become part of you
[55:20] and i say you have your hand you can
[55:21] raise it that's your hand that's how the
[55:23] word has to be part of you you must want
[55:25] it to live
[55:27] you see when your competition go back
[55:29] home and it doesn't apply to your life
[55:31] you're not getting involved you're not
[55:33] you have to get mixed up with the word
[55:34] then
[55:38] you have to come saturated in your being
[55:41] it has to become part of you where
[55:43] you're feasting on it you're living on
[55:44] it you're talking about it amen tomorrow
[55:47] you could testify about the service you
[55:49] could share back things from it
[55:50] if tomorrow you forget everything you
[55:52] know going on
[55:55] you're not focused
[55:56] you have to be able to you know yeah
[55:59] dynamics is minds i am supposed to
[56:01] connect with it that's my promise that's
[56:03] the promise of my father he's sending
[56:05] dynamics to me give a promise another
[56:07] time of life he's going to visit me i
[56:09] know i'm going to get a bridge right no
[56:12] i'm going to get yes i have a hot temper
[56:13] but i know go cool it down
[56:17] yeah something some people need it a
[56:19] certain way
[56:20] and you're by finding oh gosh i wish i
[56:21] was gonna push that person cool but a
[56:23] person too cool
[56:25] they cool till they cold
[56:28] so you don't want to go on that you have
[56:29] extremes people are meeting a certain
[56:30] way and that person fire temper oh
[56:34] they could fight a bus or they could
[56:35] fight more than but one bustle they have
[56:38] that but god called all of them
[56:40] the cool coal and the fire heart tempers
[56:45] oh all of that is what people do and god
[56:48] love them the same you know
[56:49] god will have i love mr cool mr cool
[56:52] real cool i'm mr noisy and rowdy i don't
[56:54] love him that much no god don't have
[56:56] that everybody have a place for it
[56:58] jacob was drama you know
[57:00] oh yeah jacob so was gideon also all
[57:03] them guys had drama joshua was drama too
[57:06] isn't that right gideon said the lord be
[57:08] with me
[57:09] is the lobbyist where the miracles
[57:11] that wasn't easy you know abraham was
[57:13] piece of drama too
[57:15] it got tele-brown yeah sheila and great
[57:16] reward and abram said what reward can i
[57:19] go challenge god says talking you're
[57:20] talking rude come
[57:22] come the stars
[57:24] then come back and let's talk because so
[57:25] shall your seed be now abram eleven to
[57:28] see all themselves come forth but god
[57:30] says so shall your seed be you could say
[57:32] what you want you could think what you
[57:34] want if i say so i am god
[57:36] my word will not return void and you
[57:38] could say what you want god's gonna heal
[57:40] you if god said he's gonna heal you and
[57:42] god gonna deliver your family i don't
[57:43] care what they're doing right now today
[57:47] that has nothing to do with what god
[57:49] promised
[57:50] oh glory to god god have them so in some
[57:52] condition
[57:53] oh my feeling inspired right now
[57:56] their conditions all are wrong as god
[57:58] set it up that way
[57:59] he sent the mountain so high
[58:01] he said the valley solo he said the
[58:03] river so high
[58:05] to prove he is god
[58:11] you heard that
[58:12] he set the mountain so high
[58:15] he set the valley
[58:17] solo
[58:21] when it comes into your flesh and your
[58:23] faith and becomes life then you are
[58:25] living example
[58:27] you are an epistle of god oh blessed be
[58:30] lord
[58:31] god is right his word is right others
[58:33] are not right that's right along as they
[58:35] stay with the word when you leave the
[58:37] word you leave god god is watching over
[58:40] his word to vindicate it to make it real
[58:43] when a man takes a word of god no matter
[58:46] how little his fate is if he won't mix
[58:48] it with unbelief it will bring him out
[58:49] to the light or praise the name of the
[58:51] lord and that's how you are christian by
[58:54] birth when you are born of the spirit of
[58:56] god persistent yes but when you can
[58:58] achieve something all men to all the
[58:59] ages have been able to achieve when they
[59:02] are persistent if their faith in what
[59:04] they're trying to achieve it depends
[59:05] upon what your achievement is it depends
[59:07] upon what you're trying to do oh blessed
[59:09] being the lord today and here we go i'm
[59:12] closing musicians please what we need
[59:14] today is men and women who will take god
[59:17] by his word and be persistent with it
[59:21] samson
[59:22] hallelujah
[59:24] he was persistent as long as he could
[59:26] feel those seven locks around him
[59:30] hallelujah
[59:32] so samson wasn't easy we know that
[59:34] samson was quite a character but as long
[59:37] as he could feel several lots he felt
[59:39] invincible
[59:41] you couldn't
[59:43] you can't fault him for that because god
[59:45] says as long as then seven locks dear i
[59:47] am with you
[59:49] that is my contract with you
[59:51] you have several locks
[59:52] i am with you how are you moving i have
[59:55] the back here
[59:56] so samson moving man
[59:58] are you
[59:59] oh yes
[1:00:01] he moving so much he move out of god's
[1:00:03] program and god's will
[1:00:06] when he lost it i see after a while
[1:00:08] stands to believe it's his power
[1:00:10] recovery lie let's have a tell him god
[1:00:11] tell me now what is secret now we have a
[1:00:14] secret because only seven seals no
[1:00:16] silence there nothing they say tell me
[1:00:17] something what's going on there he's
[1:00:19] safe he'll time it with this and then he
[1:00:21] break the chords afterwards he started
[1:00:22] to lie but he was still there started
[1:00:24] doing small wrong but the pot was still
[1:00:26] there started breaking the rules but the
[1:00:28] power's still there
[1:00:30] because god said seven i'm with you
[1:00:32] if you hold seven
[1:00:34] when he finally breaks and he tell her
[1:00:37] make sure he gets it all said cut off
[1:00:39] so now he's ordinary
[1:00:42] all of a sudden this man that conquer
[1:00:44] land conquered gates conquer the enemy
[1:00:46] be or he's find himself ordinary
[1:00:49] same muscles same man same books same
[1:00:52] tapes same message
[1:00:55] ordinary no unction no inspiration no
[1:00:59] vision no fire
[1:01:00] no power no presence
[1:01:02] all of a sudden you realize
[1:01:05] is so
[1:01:07] dies how would this be
[1:01:08] now the eyes out
[1:01:11] grinding at the mill
[1:01:13] what a pitiful condition
[1:01:15] what a shame
[1:01:17] to come to the spot
[1:01:18] after serving god i have to be under his
[1:01:22] glory and anointing to be stripped to be
[1:01:25] just like another man
[1:01:27] it makes no sense
[1:01:29] god called you out all these years
[1:01:32] not to be ordinary
[1:01:34] no
[1:01:35] we are called to break into the
[1:01:37] supernatural
[1:01:38] realm
[1:01:39] where all things are possible
[1:01:41] do you believe that
[1:01:43] hallelujah now watch i'm closing with
[1:01:46] this
[1:01:49] samson was very persistent as long as he
[1:01:51] could feel those seven locks around him
[1:01:53] he know that the promise was god given
[1:01:55] him
[1:01:56] and every man and woman could be
[1:01:57] persistent as samson
[1:01:59] as long as you can feel what
[1:02:02] that power
[1:02:04] of promise or wrong you of god
[1:02:08] power of
[1:02:10] promise said
[1:02:11] power of promise say it again
[1:02:14] power of promise as long as you could
[1:02:16] feel the power of the promise of

[1:11:16] all of your service this evening let's
[1:11:17] just turn to our bibles

[1:11:22] to 32.
[1:11:27] praise god amen
[1:11:29] trust your appreciated service this
[1:11:30] evening
[1:11:32] amen praise god
[1:11:36] first corinthians 11
[1:11:39] verses 23-32
[1:11:47] for i have received of the lord that
[1:11:49] which also i delivered unto you
[1:11:52] that the lord jesus the same night in
[1:11:55] which he was betrayed
[1:11:56] took bread
[1:11:58] and when he had given thanks he broke it
[1:12:01] and said
[1:12:02] take each
[1:12:03] this is my body which is broken for you
[1:12:06] this dude in remembrance of me
[1:12:10] after the same manner also he took the
[1:12:12] cup
[1:12:13] when he had stopped saying
[1:12:15] this cup is the new testament in my
[1:12:17] blood
[1:12:18] this dewey as often as you drink it in
[1:12:21] remembrance of me
[1:12:23] for as often as eat this bread and drink
[1:12:25] this cup
[1:12:27] ye do show the lord's death till he come
[1:12:31] wherefore
[1:12:32] whosoever shall eat his bread
[1:12:34] and drink this cup of the lord
[1:12:36] unwillingly
[1:12:37] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[1:12:39] the lord
[1:12:40] but
[1:12:42] let a man examine himself
[1:12:44] and so let him eat of that bread and
[1:12:46] drink of that cup
[1:12:48] for he that each of them drink it
[1:12:50] unwittingly
[1:12:51] eating them drinking damnation to
[1:12:53] himself not desealing the lord's body
[1:12:56] for this cause many are weakened sickly
[1:12:58] among you and many sleep
[1:13:01] for if we will judge ourselves
[1:13:03] we should not be judged
[1:13:05] but when we are judged
