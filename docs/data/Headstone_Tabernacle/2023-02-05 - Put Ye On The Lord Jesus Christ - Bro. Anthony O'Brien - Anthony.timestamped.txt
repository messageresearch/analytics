[1:02:34] by Vindicated prophecy of Vindicated
[1:02:37] Prophet spoke praise God our vision and
[1:02:40] now the world is almost like fighting
[1:02:43] towards fulfilling that Vision with

[1:02:50] tomorrow they're going to have more
[1:02:52] advanced technology than they had five
[1:02:53] minutes ago praise that's how fast it's
[1:02:56] moving and if the world is moving so
[1:02:58] fast then brother we've got to move fast
[1:03:00] too the Bible says we're not a vision
[1:03:03] the people perish so it took on Malachi
[1:03:06] for profits to present us with a vision
[1:03:09] a vision of what we are to achieve what
[1:03:12] we are to be all and what we supposed to
[1:03:15] conquer what we're supposed to overcome

[1:11:51] and prove what is word and what is not
[1:11:54] word what's called and the devil praise
[1:11:57] God prove the difference between the

[1:18:07] this word that we're hearing this
[1:18:09] morning comes from God
[1:18:10] it is his Divine message to us
[1:18:13] and we ought to treat it so
[1:18:16] and not in a carnal atmosphere
[1:18:18] but Francis if I could get more in the
[1:18:20] monitors please not in a carnal
[1:18:22] atmosphere
[1:18:23] but in a spiritual atmosphere
[1:18:25] so I'll approach or to be one of
[1:18:28] sincerity
[1:18:29] recognizing that there's a holy God in
[1:18:33] this place this morning and wants to
[1:18:35] touch you to bless you if you can open
[1:18:37] your eyes like Elijah's servant to see
[1:18:39] what's really happening around you to
[1:18:43] see that you are accompanied by angels
[1:18:45] that you are not alone in this battle he
[1:18:48] says stand still and see the salvation
[1:18:50] of your car here I believe it shall not
[1:18:53] make haste but we are resting on the
[1:18:56] promised word of God what he said what
[1:19:00] he said cannot fall to the crown it
[1:19:03] shall accomplish it shall accomplish
[1:19:05] because it is not man's words it is
[1:19:08] God's words oh even the devil knows that
[1:19:13] God's word must be accomplished but he
[1:19:15] fights against it he fights against you
[1:19:17] believe in it because he doesn't want
[1:19:18] you to change he doesn't want you to be
[1:19:21] filled to be sealed because if that
[1:19:23] happens he has no more hold on your life

[1:19:57] ones and the pain are different there

[1:27:04] night I was preaching and you just come
[1:27:06] to me that I was looking at it I look
[1:27:09] Paul even said in Ephesians 6 above all
[1:27:11] take the shield of fate
[1:27:12] and I think it was the Spartans who they
[1:27:15] revered they respected they appreciated
[1:27:19] their Shield so much it meant so much to
[1:27:22] them
[1:27:23] until the Spartan mothers would tell
[1:27:26] their sons come back home with your
[1:27:28] shield on your hand or if you come back
[1:27:30] Dead come back lying down on your Shield
[1:27:33] but by all means come back with your
[1:27:35] Shield
[1:27:36] that's how much they respected it that's
[1:27:38] how much they appreciated it because
[1:27:40] with your Shield you could quench the
[1:27:43] fiery thoughts of the wicked the devil
[1:27:45] has come with fiery darts say they can't
[1:27:48] make it you can't overcome your sin too
[1:27:51] much you can't receive the Holy Ghost
[1:27:53] you can't pray you can't call on God but
[1:27:56] if you have your Shield of Faith you
[1:27:59] could quench those fiery thoughts when
[1:28:01] they come Hallelujah I know my court is
[1:28:04] a deliverer I know my God Is A Healer I
[1:28:06] know my God is a Waymaker oh Hallelujah
[1:28:11] you could quench the fiery dots
[1:28:15] and that Shield is so powerful you
[1:28:18] cannot over cover yourself where you can
[1:28:20] cover the brother to the left of you you
[1:28:22] can cover the brother to your right to
[1:28:23] you your feet your sheer can stand in a
[1:28:27] gap for somebody this morning who's too
[1:28:29] weak so if you're in the battle and your
[1:28:32] brother's bleeding out on the ground go
[1:28:34] down with your Shield of Faith quench
[1:28:36] the pirate out of the wicked oh
[1:28:38] Hallelujah cover your brother cover your

[1:29:14] to contact the supernatural
[1:29:16] it takes Faith to fight the spiritual
[1:29:18] warfare it's very important no wonder
[1:29:21] Paul said above all

[1:34:31] bed in hell behold Thou Art there
[1:34:34] if I take the wings of the morning and I
[1:34:37] dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea

[1:37:24] faith that was being tried even though
[1:37:27] your feelings fell to the ground even
[1:37:29] though your human Spirit was stripped
[1:37:31] and beaten God put something in your
[1:37:33] soul this morning that's the only reason
[1:37:36] you came here this morning is because
[1:37:38] God put something in your soul that
[1:37:42] something is eternal that something
[1:37:45] cannot fall to the ground the secret is
[1:37:48] the word is in the bride that word is in
[1:37:52] you this morning and the Holy Spirit the

[1:38:25] works
[1:38:27] and that my soul
[1:38:29] know as well
[1:38:31] God wanted to get a message something
[1:38:34] you wanted to see somebody want to get
[1:38:36] to us like but it always says God want
[1:38:38] to read God could speak God correct
[1:38:40] so God had his hand on somebody got his
[1:38:43] hand on Paul a different one throughout
[1:38:45] the ages to write to speak to send the
[1:38:48] word a message from a supernatural God
[1:38:51] send this word to them to be encouraged
[1:38:54] Amen to keep your faith in God the same

[1:39:00] will take you all the way
[1:39:02] to Heaven amen glory to Heavenly places
[1:39:06] amen in Christ Jesus wonderful
[1:39:09] so that is why God sent us a prophet see
[1:39:12] because he needs to get a message to us
[1:39:15] in this last day
[1:39:16] amen he got somebody he could use
[1:39:19] speak through
[1:39:21] and that's how we're here today
[1:39:22] shout message went out
[1:39:24] call us praise God from all walks of
[1:39:26] life here we are and now it's up to us
[1:39:29] individuals
[1:39:31] to walk this narrow road
[1:39:34] to walk this straight gate
[1:39:36] to walk this narrow way
[1:39:39] few there be that find it
[1:39:41] a Straight Gate I don't think it's
[1:39:43] straight like what you're thinking as
[1:39:44] straight in terms of like a line that
[1:39:46] word straight means odd it's kind of
[1:39:48] like strange to the eye
[1:39:50] you'd miss it if you were driving too
[1:39:52] fast but somehow God allowed you to turn
[1:39:55] around and take a look at this one more
[1:39:56] time because there's some way I want you
[1:39:58] to be there's somewhere I want you to go
[1:40:00] you interrupt your flow interrupt your
[1:40:03] your program to show you a better way

[1:40:14] you
[1:40:15] what he has to show you because by that
[1:40:17] process you're going to become perfect
[1:40:19] praise God have you continued on a
[1:40:21] highway you might have been on a Highway
[1:40:23] to Hell
[1:40:24] but God pull you off to the side and
[1:40:26] allowed you to look just like you pulled
[1:40:28] Moses off to the side and said what is
[1:40:31] it attraction upon the mountain I will
[1:40:33] turn aside to look and see what this
[1:40:36] thing is and that's all God wanted to do
[1:40:38] that was the start of something good
[1:40:40] when Moses turned aside to look all the
[1:40:44] time he had questions all the time he
[1:40:46] had doubts all the time he had fears but
[1:40:49] when he turned aside to see that's when
[1:40:52] God started something good in his life
[1:40:53] and this morning my brother this morning
[1:40:56] my sister God wants you to Turn Your
[1:40:59] Eyes Upon Jesus all the time you have
[1:41:02] doubts all the time you have fears all
[1:41:05] the time you have questions but this
[1:41:07] morning if you could Turn Your Eyes Upon
[1:41:10] Jesus look upon the glory of his
[1:41:13] wonderful Pace look upon his word this
[1:41:17] morning cast your eyes on this that
[1:41:20] could be the thought of something good
[1:41:22] this morning I challenge you to believe
[1:41:24] it I challenge you to turn your eyes
[1:41:26] this morning lift your hands worship him
[1:41:29] get in the spirit turn your attraction
[1:41:32] set your affection on things above

[1:41:40] to the side somewhere
[1:41:43] give your power
[1:41:45] and let the whole world know
[1:41:47] that he is witch
[1:41:49] hey man that's his promise and he's
[1:41:53] happy to fulfill that promise with his
[1:41:55] sons and his daughters as evidence that
[1:41:58] he keeps his word God's Gonna bless you
[1:42:02] so much that it's going to be evidence
[1:42:04] to the devil that God keeps his word
[1:42:07] God's gonna let your cup overflow he's
[1:42:10] gonna anoint you at all until your cup
[1:42:13] run over in the presence of your enemies
[1:42:17] God not shame to do it you don't feel
[1:42:20] know how to do it because that is
[1:42:22] evidence that God keeps his word oh he's
[1:42:27] gonna keep us over this morning he's
[1:42:29] Gonna Fill you he's gonna seal you
[1:42:32] oh stay without worrying man Hallelujah
[1:42:36] so we know that there are three rounds
[1:42:38] right humanistic divine revelation
[1:42:41] and vision
[1:42:42] so God sent us a prophet in his last day
[1:42:45] and that gift of God is what goes up
[1:42:47] into the Realms of the supernatural
[1:42:50] and sees a vision
[1:42:52] so it's beyond humanistic uh Revelation
[1:42:56] in that sense he goes way up into Dusty
[1:42:57] the Lord
[1:42:59] Etc
[1:43:00] is that right
[1:43:02] and of course that would kind of fail
[1:43:03] here's a prophet talking about it here
[1:43:05] and you put in the position of
[1:43:06] Christianity
[1:43:07] uh paragraph 54 he said and God liken
[1:43:10] the prophet to the ego
[1:43:12] that will go up in the makeup of a
[1:43:14] prophet he's a Seer that in the spirit
[1:43:17] he's describing it now
[1:43:19] in the spirit he climbs beyond the
[1:43:22] emotion of the church
[1:43:24] wow so people going through stuff and
[1:43:26] whatever right the Prophet this year he
[1:43:28] goes beyond all that
[1:43:30] beyond the emotion of the church he goes
[1:43:32] beyond the rhythm of the music
[1:43:34] how descriptive he goes beyond the
[1:43:36] Clapping of the hands
[1:43:38] I could see it now amen amen he goes
[1:43:41] beyond the joy and the Saints
[1:43:43] he goes beyond all that and God bring
[1:43:45] him up into a realm alone alone
[1:43:48] Prophet says it twice
[1:43:51] alone
[1:43:52] and then he opens his eye and he lets
[1:43:55] him look around
[1:43:56] and see things that is to come
[1:43:59] Visions pictures
[1:44:01] seemingly almost real right then he
[1:44:03] comes back down and among the members of
[1:44:05] the body to foretell to them what is in
[1:44:08] the making
[1:44:10] it's not so these pictures that are
[1:44:12] coming to him
[1:44:14] it's not coming in Emotion because the
[1:44:16] prophet said he's beyond all that
[1:44:18] this is not coming in the Clapping of
[1:44:20] hands or how loud you shout this Vision
[1:44:23] realm we're talking about is a vision
[1:44:26] it's around beyond all of that
[1:44:28] beyond the noise of here you hear
[1:44:31] an asylum
[1:44:34] something speaks
[1:44:36] something comes forward picture
[1:44:38] Prophet said sometimes it's almost so
[1:44:40] real he could feel the wind on his face
[1:44:43] in that Vision World
[1:44:45] sometimes when he's here on the Earth
[1:44:47] he is not sure whether he's in a vision
[1:44:49] or he's in reality because they're both
[1:44:51] almost the same
[1:44:52] oh what a gift of a prophet that God
[1:44:55] gave us in his last days to see because
[1:44:57] not many people live in that Realm
[1:45:00] only few people can live in that room
[1:45:02] and God just had a man on the Earth
[1:45:06] in all time and all day
[1:45:08] to have that kind of a gift
[1:45:10] to be able to do that a lot of people
[1:45:14] live in a humanistic maybe many of us
[1:45:16] here this morning thinking about whether
[1:45:18] we forget the iron on or we left the
[1:45:20] stove on this morning
[1:45:23] huh
[1:45:24] you think about that we think about all
[1:45:26] the things in the car I'd have to fix
[1:45:28] and all the bills are not paid yet it's
[1:45:29] still in the humanistic above that is
[1:45:32] divine revelation
[1:45:33] and then above that is Vision so the
[1:45:36] prophet is taken way up look how high he
[1:45:37] is
[1:45:38] above clapping of hands above people
[1:45:41] shouting above the negative above the
[1:45:43] noise above everything else oh in a
[1:45:46] place where God is on a place where his
[1:45:48] thoughts are and the prophet has the
[1:45:50] ability to see these Divine things to
[1:45:53] see these pictures these visions of
[1:45:56] things that are yet to take place
[1:45:58] thus say the Lord things that are going
[1:46:01] to be
[1:46:02] no wonder he could talk about that
[1:46:04] egg-shaped car isn't that right no one
[1:46:06] that you could talk about Nazism and all
[1:46:08] that I've been swallowed up in the
[1:46:09] communism and the whole thing he saw it
[1:46:11] was seven visions that must come to pass
[1:46:14] before the Lord come oh he saw it happen
[1:46:17] in front of him and God cannot lie that
[1:46:21] is the mind of God that Prophet a
[1:46:23] prophet saw and when he comes down and
[1:46:25] speak it he's speaking according to the
[1:46:27] mind of God
[1:46:28] oh and that Prophet saw official of a
[1:46:31] bride Marching In Step she was marching
[1:46:35] left right left right she had her
[1:46:38] garments on spotless she was Marching In
[1:46:41] Step she was marching holy holy unto the
[1:46:43] Lord oh I believe he saw you I believe
[1:46:47] he saw me I believe he saw us coming out
[1:46:50] of the world marching onward to Jesus
[1:46:53] Christ Marching In Step Marching In
[1:46:56] Holiness Marching In Purity only five
[1:46:59] lives say anything to them just as sweet
[1:47:05] uttering their voices in sweetness and
[1:47:08] humility
[1:47:10] thousands of live voices
[1:47:12] coming out of the world marching into
[1:47:15] Glory that's what he sees this morning
[1:47:25] [Music]
[1:47:29] amen so do you see it now
[1:47:32] think on this
[1:47:34] amen
[1:47:35] so you're not Ram alone isn't that right
[1:47:39] all right
[1:47:41] paragraph 55 he said so God took Ezekiel
[1:47:44] that scripture I think it's Ezekiel 8
[1:47:46] right
[1:47:46] yeah high and far up and if you have
[1:47:49] time we should read it it's very
[1:47:50] interesting
[1:47:51] Ezekiel actually describes how God took
[1:47:53] him by a lock of his hair and took him
[1:47:55] up into a dimension
[1:47:57] Between Heaven and Earth
[1:47:58] and he saw things he said a man look
[1:48:01] what all men do look at the men look
[1:48:03] what the men do in the dark
[1:48:05] they think I'm not seeing
[1:48:08] they like it so
[1:48:10] they're doing stuff and they say go to
[1:48:12] see us
[1:48:13] we shut the door
[1:48:14] but you say look Solomon look what
[1:48:15] they're doing watching them long time I
[1:48:18] just let you take a sneak
[1:48:20] take a peek
[1:48:21] I watching them since they start
[1:48:23] since they began coming off that beaten
[1:48:26] part
[1:48:27] watching them from that long time and I
[1:48:28] already know the end from the beginning
[1:48:30] I already know where they're going to
[1:48:31] end up
[1:48:32] that's why you call for those
[1:48:33] slaughtering angels to purge praise God
[1:48:36] amen amen but before you send them an
[1:48:40] incarnate
[1:48:41] with an ink on by his side was sent to
[1:48:43] put a mark upon those that sigh and cry
[1:48:47] for the Abominations being done in the
[1:48:49] city therefore if you have a sign your
[1:48:51] heart when you see all these signs
[1:48:54] happening when you see all these movies
[1:48:55] being made and things being done it is a
[1:48:58] sigh a cry in your heart Lord surely you
[1:49:01] send a prophet not for naught surely
[1:49:04] your spirit is here to do something
[1:49:06] surely I didn't come all this way
[1:49:08] Hallelujah just to be uh pray to the

[1:50:40] it in your self you need Jesus says we
[1:50:45] would see Jesus
[1:50:50] oh Hallelujah
[1:50:53] read Jesus in this message
[1:50:55] we need Jesus in this church we need
[1:50:58] Jesus in our lives we need Jesus in our
[1:51:01] hearts we need Jesus Hallelujah in our
[1:51:04] cars when we drive into work we need
[1:51:07] Jesus to stand with us hallelujah in the
[1:51:10] dark times the days are evil but God
[1:51:13] promised he'd be with you he said I'll
[1:51:16] never leave you I'll never forsake you
[1:51:20] we need Jesus this morning
[1:51:23] oh my god well let me hurry on here now
[1:51:26] think of it now see let him look around
[1:51:28] okay
[1:51:29] up looking around about 2 600 years
[1:51:32] think of it now and let him have a
[1:51:33] prophet also a gift of knowledge and now
[1:51:36] he talks about a gift of knowledge
[1:51:38] Prophet said our knowledge
[1:51:40] knowledge as he said like an attorney
[1:51:42] who studies the books
[1:51:44] when you go to hire an attorney to plead
[1:51:46] your case he's only taking what he knows
[1:51:49] and you're paying him for what he knows
[1:51:51] to present your case before the judge
[1:51:55] and he types that here now and says and
[1:51:57] now a gift of knowledge in the Bible is
[1:52:00] prophecy
[1:52:01] which goes up and finds out these things
[1:52:04] that are to come
[1:52:06] and brings them back down
[1:52:09] but they must compare with the Bible
[1:52:12] and with the book so it can't just be
[1:52:16] anything any kind of knowledge can't
[1:52:18] just be how to how to how to change a
[1:52:20] car tire it has to be a Godly knowledge
[1:52:23] spiritual knowledge to compel the Bible
[1:52:26] isn't that right
[1:52:27] see so if they're out of the book then
[1:52:30] they're not received because the judge
[1:52:32] judges by the book is she so it has to
[1:52:35] be by the book isn't that right
[1:52:37] it's not right so that gift of knowledge
[1:52:39] goes up
[1:52:40] it is not right in the Bible and it's
[1:52:42] prophecy it's also prophecy which goes
[1:52:43] up
[1:52:44] no wonder the Bible says that
[1:52:46] um the lion had roared who can but fear
[1:52:49] and if the Lord God has spoken
[1:52:52] then who can be prophesied
[1:52:54] then what we've had all these years is
[1:52:57] prophecy it shall be it shall be coming
[1:53:00] out of the Seven Seals seventh on the
[1:53:03] message of Malachi 4 our Revelation come
[1:53:05] to us seven Turners give Faith to gather
[1:53:08] the bride together to give a faith for
[1:53:10] Rapture and Grace we've been prophesying
[1:53:13] all these years with a revelation of
[1:53:16] what God is about to do for us with a
[1:53:19] revelation of those seven Thunder that
[1:53:21] utter their voices
[1:53:23] Mighty Angel all that come from Glory
[1:53:26] isn't that right rainbow upon his head
[1:53:28] Feed Us pillars of Fire
[1:53:31] it's not right he calmed down and he
[1:53:34] claimed the Earth
[1:53:35] God said Heaven is my Throne Earth is my
[1:53:38] footstool do you know what a footstool
[1:53:40] is it's a little square object you put
[1:53:42] your foot on it well God come down
[1:53:44] Mighty Angel come down upon the Earth
[1:53:47] with pillars of fire put his right foot
[1:53:49] on the earth left put on the sea and so
[1:53:52] forth isn't that right he come down to
[1:53:54] claim what he has redeemed oh Hallelujah
[1:53:58] honey come down to claim you pillar Fire
[1:54:01] come down to claim you claim you by fire
[1:54:04] claim you by power claim you by
[1:54:07] anointing oh Hallelujah and that message
[1:54:10] Rose out to catch that bride oh oh
[1:54:15] there's unbelievers there's make
[1:54:17] Believers but in the midst of all of
[1:54:19] that God has a True Believer who's gonna
[1:54:22] stay with that word oh hallelujah
[1:54:24] hallelujah isn't that right he's got
[1:54:27] some calebs who's got another spirit
[1:54:29] with them who knows who their father is
[1:54:32] who knows he didn't come out all these
[1:54:35] 40 years to occupy space but give me my
[1:54:39] Mountain oh Spirit of Prophecy Spirit of

[1:54:56] Oh Glory to come
[1:55:00] so we thank God for revelation
[1:55:02] [Applause]
[1:55:03] to know what the prophecy is
[1:55:06] amen is not right to know what we have
[1:55:09] to receive
[1:55:10] that's what kept us on fire all these
[1:55:12] years that's why we're not lolly in a
[1:55:15] message just sit around waiting for
[1:55:16] somebody to give us something like a you
[1:55:18] know pray like a beggar or something
[1:55:19] isn't that right but we know who our
[1:55:22] father is and we know who Jesus is and
[1:55:25] we know what the Bible said concerning
[1:55:27] us hallelujah I know we don't see it
[1:55:29] with our eyes but something in our
[1:55:32] hearts knows that is real or Revelation
[1:55:35] 50 plus years in this message but a
[1:55:38] revelation echo in our hearts
[1:55:42] Raptor increase then we step out of the
[1:55:46] pages of the Bible and boldly declare
[1:55:49] our promises and anoint our promises to
[1:55:52] ourselves knowing that the time is at
[1:55:55] hand for this seven Thunder Revival oh

[1:56:21] already said we're just speaking about
[1:56:24] by by faith believing what he said will
[1:56:26] come to pass that's all it is but they
[1:56:29] take a revelation to do that and take a
[1:56:31] revelation to see your promises in this
[1:56:33] book and even though the prophet preach
