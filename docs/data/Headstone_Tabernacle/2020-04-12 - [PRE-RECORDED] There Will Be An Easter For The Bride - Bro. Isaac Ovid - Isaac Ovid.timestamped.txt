[1:12:14] morning so what can we say about the
[1:12:16] weekend thus far Good Friday Gore
[1:12:19] reproduces himself with Antony minister
[1:12:22] such a tremendous blessing and the
[1:12:25] praise and worship service last night
[1:12:27] and here we are this morning under
[1:12:29] expectation for God to do exceedingly
[1:12:33] abundantly above all that we can ask or
[1:12:35] thing this morning and I encourage you
[1:12:37] today you get what you expect you get
[1:12:41] what you expect and you will get out of
[1:12:44] it what you put into it and this church
[1:12:47] is not a movie this church is not
[1:12:49] entertainment it's a participatory
[1:12:51] experience so you're not here to sit
[1:12:54] back to just enjoy it but you're here to
[1:12:56] create something because men around them
[1:12:59] torches that the minister can never
[1:13:00] bring the revival but when the people
[1:13:02] come under expectation and come with
[1:13:04] their knees and come to put something
[1:13:07] into the service then something happens
[1:13:09] can the church same
[1:13:11] so I'd like to get straight to the word
[1:13:13] this morning reading from st. mark 16
[1:13:17] reading from verse 1 reading from Romans
[1:13:19] 8 and reading from revelation 1 this
[1:13:22] morning
[1:13:32] like to welcome all the visitors and our
[1:13:34] gates this morning so readings in mark
[1:13:38] 16 and reading from verse 1 and when the
[1:13:42] Sabbath was passed Mary Magdalene and
[1:13:45] Mary the mother of James and Salome II
[1:13:48] had brought had bought sweet spices that
[1:13:51] they might come and anoint him and very
[1:13:54] early in the morning the first day of
[1:13:56] the week they came unto the sifaka at a
[1:14:00] rising of the Sun and the said among
[1:14:04] themselves who shall roll us away the
[1:14:06] stone from the door of the sepulchre and
[1:14:10] when they looked they saw that the stone
[1:14:13] was rolled away for it was very great
[1:14:16] and entering the sea Falcor they saw a
[1:14:19] young man sitting on the right side
[1:14:20] clothed in a long white garment and they
[1:14:22] were affrighted and he said unto them be
[1:14:25] not afraid said he seek Jesus of
[1:14:27] Nazareth which was crucified he is risen
[1:14:29] he is not here behold the place where
[1:14:32] they laid him but go your way tell his
[1:14:35] disciples and Peter that he goeth before
[1:14:37] you into Galilee where shall you see him
[1:14:39] as he said unto you reading Romans 8 and
[1:14:42] reading from verse 11 Romans 8 and verse
[1:14:47] 11 but if the spirit of him that raised
[1:14:49] up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he
[1:14:52] that raised up Christ from the dead
[1:14:54] shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
[1:14:57] his Spirit that dwelleth in you and
[1:15:01] reading revelation 1 and reading from
[1:15:05] verse 12 revelation 1 and reading from
[1:15:10] verse 12 and I turned to see the voice
[1:15:16] that speak with me and being tuned
[1:15:19] I saw seven golden candlesticks and in
[1:15:23] the midst of the seven candlesticks one
[1:15:26] like unto the Son of Man clothed with a
[1:15:28] garment down to the foot and good about
[1:15:30] the paps with a golden girdle his head
[1:15:33] and his hairs were white like wool as
[1:15:35] white as snow and his eyes were as a
[1:15:38] flame of fire and his feet like unto
[1:15:40] fine brass
[1:15:41] as if they burned in a furnace and his
[1:15:44] voice as a sound of many waters and he
[1:15:47] had in his right hand seven stars and
[1:15:49] out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged
[1:15:51] sword and his countenance was as the
[1:15:53] sunshine it in his strength and when I
[1:15:55] saw him I fell at his feet as dead and
[1:15:59] he laid his right hand upon me saying
[1:16:01] unto me fear not I am the first and the
[1:16:04] last I am he that liveth and was dead
[1:16:06] and behold I am Alive for evermore amen
[1:16:09] and have the keys of hell and death me
[1:16:12] the Lord had a blessing to the reading
[1:16:14] of his word you may be seated him so I
[1:16:19] have a title this morning there will be
[1:16:27] an Easter for the bride
[1:16:29] a subject who will roll away the stone
[1:16:33] and an inspiration if that same spirit
[1:16:37] that raised Christ from the dead dwells
[1:16:39] in you but before I go any further I
[1:16:43] want to read one more scripture for
[1:16:46] context this morning and it's the same
[1:16:48] script everywhere the last night in
[1:16:50] Hebrews 2 and verse 14 for as much then
[1:16:55] as the children are partakers of flesh
[1:16:58] and blood he also himself likewise took
[1:17:02] part of the same that through death he
[1:17:05] might destroy him that had the power of
[1:17:08] death that is the devil
[1:17:10] and deliver them who through fear of
[1:17:13] death were all their lifetime subject to
[1:17:16] bondage for verily he took not on him
[1:17:18] the nature of angels but he took on him
[1:17:21] the seed of Abraham wherefore in all
[1:17:24] things it behooves him to be made like
[1:17:27] unto his brethren that he might be a
[1:17:29] merciful and faithful high priest in
[1:17:32] things pertaining to God to make
[1:17:34] reconciliation for the sins of the
[1:17:37] people for in that he himself had
[1:17:39] suffered being tempted he is able to
[1:17:42] succour them that are tempted can the
[1:17:46] church say Amen
[1:17:47] so just to place this in context
[1:17:50] yesterday we spoke on the secret
[1:17:53] mission of Jesus and how when we go back
[1:17:56] to back to the beginning and God created
[1:18:00] the heavens and the earth and he created
[1:18:03] the animal he created animal life he
[1:18:05] created plant life he created the fishes
[1:18:08] he created all of nature and any
[1:18:10] policeman in the Garden of Eden and in
[1:18:14] the Garden of Eden God would come down
[1:18:16] in the cool of the evening to fellowship
[1:18:18] with Adam he would come down in the cool
[1:18:20] of the evening to converse with Adam
[1:18:23] that's what the Bible teaches us and
[1:18:25] it's interesting to note that even
[1:18:28] though God would come down in the cool
[1:18:29] of the evening to fellowship with Adam
[1:18:32] and his wife that when the devil came
[1:18:34] and spoke to Eve the interaction that no
[1:18:38] doubt you would have had when God come
[1:18:40] down in the cool of the evening did not
[1:18:42] seem to be enough to have kept her from
[1:18:47] falling for what the devil had to offer
[1:18:50] God had spoken to Adam and given Adam an
[1:18:53] instruction and given him dominion over
[1:18:55] the earth and dominion over everything
[1:18:57] Adam had the power to create he had the
[1:19:00] power to move things around he was like
[1:19:02] God on the earth he was made in the
[1:19:05] image of God he had attributes like God
[1:19:08] and his responsibility was to let Eve
[1:19:11] know what God had said to him and God in
[1:19:14] His grace and mercy would come down in
[1:19:16] the cool of the evening here in the
[1:19:19] Garden of Eden to minister to them out
[1:19:21] of how was your day Eve how was your day
[1:19:24] and and I could imagine I want to know
[1:19:26] what your experience would be like if
[1:19:28] every evening you had the opportunity
[1:19:30] for court to walk into your house and
[1:19:32] and talk to you and find out how your
[1:19:34] deal was and it's very hard for court to
[1:19:38] have spoken to you yesterday evening and
[1:19:40] for the devil to come today and you make
[1:19:44] a mistake you fall and the devil is able
[1:19:47] after you would have met God yesterday
[1:19:49] evening and the devil would come and see
[1:19:51] something to you to throw you off at
[1:19:56] that time it was a relationship that man
[1:20:00] had an obligation to not touch that tree
[1:20:04] and when man did not touch that tree he
[1:20:08] was keeping his part of the Covenant
[1:20:10] with God but when man fell God said you
[1:20:14] know what I am never making that kind of
[1:20:17] covenant with man again because man in
[1:20:20] his best condition could never keep the
[1:20:24] word that I have so I'm gonna make a
[1:20:27] covenant with myself I'm not gonna make
[1:20:30] a covenant with man anymore
[1:20:32] because man even in his condition fail
[1:20:36] man in his authority he fell from his
[1:20:39] authority man with his jurisdiction he
[1:20:42] fell from his jurisdiction so God made a
[1:20:46] covenant to bring back things a
[1:20:48] different condition that physical please
[1:20:51] call Edom was not enough to have kept
[1:20:55] them so God envision a different place
[1:20:58] that man could live in where he would
[1:21:00] fall no more he couldn't make mistakes
[1:21:03] no more you don't hear me this morning
[1:21:05] so from all the way back there God
[1:21:08] planned out everything that would take
[1:21:11] place
[1:21:12] he planned every trial he planned every
[1:21:15] situation he planned for every prophet
[1:21:18] to come when they came he plan for the
[1:21:21] children of Israel to end up in Egypt he
[1:21:23] he wanted it that way because he had
[1:21:26] something to prove he was on a mission
[1:21:29] he had an objective he had a purpose the
[1:21:32] Bible tells us there is no accident with
[1:21:35] God there is no mistake with car there's
[1:21:37] no I didn't know how it happened with
[1:21:39] God with God it's all about purpose it's
[1:21:43] all about objective so when Moses was
[1:21:45] born there was a purpose for Moses being
[1:21:48] born when David was born there was a
[1:21:50] purpose for DVP and Paul when Joshua was
[1:21:54] born there was a purpose but Joshua to
[1:21:56] be born when Pharaoh was born there was
[1:21:59] a purpose for Pharaoh when
[1:22:01] Nebuchadnezzar was born there was a
[1:22:03] purpose for Nebuchadnezzar when Judas
[1:22:05] was born
[1:22:06] also had a purpose to everything yes a
[1:22:09] season is a time there's a purpose and
[1:22:14] you don't think God has a purpose for
[1:22:16] you you don't think God has a purpose
[1:22:19] for you being here this morning
[1:22:21] you don't think God has a purpose and a
[1:22:24] plan for your life that the devil cannot
[1:22:26] take away your body pains cannot take
[1:22:29] away sickness cannot take away your
[1:22:31] mistakes cannot take away your failures
[1:22:34] cannot take away your problems cannot
[1:22:37] take away your past cannot take away oh
[1:22:40] [Applause]
[1:22:43] I'm gonna say a few things this morning
[1:22:46] but I just want to connect to yesterday
[1:22:48] before I talk about today so God had a
[1:22:51] secret mission and for this secret
[1:22:54] mission called under soda oh that there
[1:22:57] are three realms as a heavenly realm
[1:22:59] there's the earthly realm
[1:23:01] and there's that realm of Hell and Hades
[1:23:03] and I know all of that way the devil
[1:23:05] operates and the Bible tells us there
[1:23:07] was war in heaven so all the trials and
[1:23:10] the struggles we feasted he did not
[1:23:12] originate on earth it originates in
[1:23:15] according to scripture in heaven so the
[1:23:17] devil raised a rebellion in heaven but
[1:23:20] that rebellion was destroyed because
[1:23:22] Michael and his angels fought and the
[1:23:25] devil was kicked out of heaven he could
[1:23:27] no longer dwell in heavenly places he
[1:23:30] could no longer walk in heavenly places
[1:23:32] and he was kicked out of heaven and
[1:23:35] thrown onto the earth but the earth was
[1:23:38] not his jurisdiction the earth was not
[1:23:40] his realm so he ended up under it
[1:23:42] because when God please man in the earth
[1:23:45] he said let man have two minions over it
[1:23:48] let man have two million in this realm
[1:23:51] let man have authority in this realm let
[1:23:55] man of authority over the animals that
[1:23:57] man have authority over the elements let
[1:24:00] man have authority over every creeping
[1:24:02] thing every walking thing every
[1:24:05] situation every obstacle
[1:24:08] had authority he had Dominion he had
[1:24:11] power Hugh ceylon in order for God to
[1:24:22] give man dominion it meant God had to
[1:24:24] have it to give it you cannot give what
[1:24:27] you do not have so when God gave man
[1:24:29] Dominion it was his power that he was
[1:24:32] sharing with man he did not give man
[1:24:35] power in heaven he gave man power on the
[1:24:37] earth
[1:24:38] and he caused signs every check like he
[1:24:40] said to Peter whatever you bind on earth
[1:24:43] mine in heaven because if two shall
[1:24:47] agree touching anything it's a law of
[1:24:49] the contract of god but god realizes in
[1:24:54] your fallen condition you cannot do it
[1:24:56] all by yourself so he put a feel safe
[1:24:59] that was not based on your condition the
[1:25:04] feel safe was not based on your mistakes
[1:25:06] it just said if you shall see the
[1:25:09] disillusion and don't talk in your heart
[1:25:11] just see it I'll take care of the rest
[1:25:13] of it because it's a contract
[1:25:17] unconditional covenant
[1:25:18] [Applause]
[1:25:23] he may be seated so God in his realm in
[1:25:28] the realm of the heavenlies with angels
[1:25:30] in the realm of the heavenlies with the
[1:25:31] seraphim's in the realm of the
[1:25:33] heavenlies with the cherubims in the
[1:25:34] realm of the heavenlies his god is our
[1:25:37] angel says angels and he's looking over
[1:25:40] everything but there banham said nothing
[1:25:42] happens in the earth that is not
[1:25:44] something simultaneously happening in
[1:25:47] heaven so we are meeting this morning
[1:25:49] here on earth and simultaneously there's
[1:25:52] a meeting going on in heaven it's a
[1:25:54] hidden meeting we can't see it what it's
[1:25:57] happening you don't have to feel it what
[1:26:01] it's happening one air whenever there's
[1:26:04] a meeting of sons of God on the earth
[1:26:07] there's a meeting going on in heaven
[1:26:08] because the angels of the Lord are
[1:26:10] dispatched they are watching what's
[1:26:13] going on there's a secret mission going
[1:26:15] on because whenever you speak because of
[1:26:18] who you are angels are dispatch to make
[1:26:20] it happen hallelujah I'm just laying a
[1:26:27] background I'm laying a foundation put
[1:26:30] on your spiritual hats this morning we
[1:26:32] didn't come to church just to have a
[1:26:34] meeting we didn't come to church because
[1:26:36] we want to be here for Easter Sunday
[1:26:38] it's got to be more than that we have to
[1:26:40] understand the true meaning of Easter we
[1:26:43] have to understand what happened when
[1:26:45] Jesus broke the barriers of data you may
[1:26:51] be seated
[1:26:52] [Music]
[1:26:52] [Applause]
[1:26:54] I'm by the man I'm types 87 the three
[1:26:57] Hebrew boys were in the fiery furnace
[1:27:01] that the Angels they were obligated the
[1:27:04] fact compelled to help the situation and
[1:27:07] that's what happens whenever you get in
[1:27:08] trouble
[1:27:09] [Applause]
[1:27:13] the moment the three Hebrew boys cut in
[1:27:16] the fire but the Brenham said the angel
[1:27:18] Gabriel around to the throne room and
[1:27:20] pull his sword out
[1:27:21] he said somebody's in trouble I don't
[1:27:24] know if you got the memo but somebody's
[1:27:26] in trouble
[1:27:26] and quartern together let's see I've got
[1:27:29] this handle don't worry about it
[1:27:32] whenever you get in trouble angels start
[1:27:35] to draw their swords because you are
[1:27:37] royalty they are obligated to respond
[1:27:40] whenever there's a distress signal you
[1:27:48] may be seated for a minute
[1:27:49] a few days ago I call a government
[1:27:55] office Oh Sarang eat 18 in the morning
[1:27:58] between eat 18 to eat 21 in the morning
[1:28:01] and I got a voice message the office
[1:28:04] opens at 8:30 and my wife said to me
[1:28:07] don't expect that phone to get answered
[1:28:09] one minute before you today and I
[1:28:15] thought about that for a while and I
[1:28:17] realize you know that's right when you
[1:28:19] want to get certain things done you have
[1:28:21] to wait on earth for the time that
[1:28:23] you're supposed to get it done you want
[1:28:26] to go and do business with the bank you
[1:28:27] have to wait until the bank opens
[1:28:29] you could be desperate you could bang
[1:28:32] down the bank doors you can do whatever
[1:28:34] you want that door not open it until the
[1:28:37] time comes but you know what's the
[1:28:39] difference with the kingdom of God it
[1:28:41] never closes it has no time off there's
[1:28:45] no opening hours they are not closing
[1:28:47] hours there's no moment the phone is not
[1:28:49] answered once there's a need you can
[1:28:52] call heaven anytime and angels in the
[1:28:56] realm of the heavenlies a dispatch to
[1:28:58] the sons and daughters of God that have
[1:29:01] a need
[1:29:05] can we preach a little bit this morning
[1:29:08] I don't know what's gonna do but I
[1:29:10] noticed one of you is tough for the
[1:29:12] bride you who are dead in here this
[1:29:14] morning
[1:29:15] yes resurrection power to raise you
[1:29:18] raise you from your sin raise you from
[1:29:20] your depression you may be seated
[1:29:23] I don't know how the system works
[1:29:28] because my jurisdiction and realm is
[1:29:30] here in it but in heaven the Hebrew boy
[1:29:34] is in trouble and Gabriel he gets the
[1:29:36] alert I don't know it's a picture I
[1:29:38] don't know some people I don't know if
[1:29:40] it's a text message I don't know what
[1:29:42] technological system in the realm they
[1:29:44] use but he knew something was up
[1:29:47] and God said Gabriel and know you can
[1:29:50] handle it but the Branham said Gabriel I
[1:29:52] know you've done everything I asked you
[1:29:53] to do but I'm asking you this time don't
[1:29:55] worry about this one stand down but the
[1:30:01] random said when Kira was finished
[1:30:02] pleading his case because he injured
[1:30:05] wanted to come to help the angel
[1:30:08] wormwood who was the one who was
[1:30:10] responsible for the flood but the
[1:30:12] Branham said he was the one who was in
[1:30:13] charge of the water he said can I go and
[1:30:16] draw water on the fiery furnace and God
[1:30:20] said no no no no I don't want to go this
[1:30:22] fire one more you did a fantastic job
[1:30:26] with it
[1:30:28] in the days of Noah but I don't need an
[1:30:32] angel to do this I want to go myself to
[1:30:36] swap out this situation
[1:30:39] you may be seated and brother branham
[1:30:41] said I know he said this yesterday but
[1:30:44] some people missed it so we want to make
[1:30:46] sure we all in the same and the same
[1:30:49] train because we are going somewhere
[1:30:51] there are certain prerequisites before
[1:30:54] you could go to the next level and the
[1:30:56] church hey man
[1:30:58] so by the Branum said that God stood and
[1:31:00] he summoned the east wind he summoned
[1:31:02] the north wind he's summoned the south
[1:31:04] when he's summoned the west wind
[1:31:06] and he jumped upon her from the head and
[1:31:08] he had straight down into the fiery
[1:31:11] furnace and he was the fourth man in the
[1:31:14] fire
[1:31:15] it wasn't an angel it was the fourth man
[1:31:18] in the fire but the bottom said it
[1:31:21] needed a man to come now to redeem them
[1:31:24] it needed a man to come out to save them
[1:31:27] an Almighty God in all of glory he could
[1:31:31] not come in his glory to redeem man but
[1:31:35] he had to take on sixteen elements he
[1:31:37] had to take on flesh you may be seated
[1:31:42] hallelujah he had to feel what you feel
[1:31:46] he had to go through what you go through
[1:31:47] he went through every temptation there's
[1:31:51] no temptation that you ever have to face
[1:31:53] that he didn't face there's no tiredness
[1:31:56] that you face that he didn't face oh
[1:32:00] come on now somebody preached back to me
[1:32:03] [Applause]
[1:32:04] I want to read it one more time Hebrews
[1:32:11] 2 verse 17 wherefore in all things he
[1:32:15] didn't see some things with a gangly in
[1:32:17] all things it behooves him to be me and
[1:32:20] like unto his brethren so Jesus wanted
[1:32:24] to be made like unto you and I that he
[1:32:26] might be a merciful and faithful high
[1:32:30] priest in things pertaining to God to
[1:32:35] make reconciliation for the sins of the
[1:32:38] people in other words he wanted to
[1:32:40] understand what we go through so when he
[1:32:43] makes reconciliation he is speaking from
[1:32:46] a position of truly experiencing what we
[1:32:49] experienced so it's not God above who
[1:32:53] doesn't know what you're going through
[1:32:54] but as Jesus he went through the trials
[1:32:57] he went through the tests he went
[1:32:59] through the heartache he went through
[1:33:01] frustration he went through depression
[1:33:03] he went through hunger the Bible said he
[1:33:06] was tempted in every way that we
[1:33:08] attempted but he sinned not but upon his
[1:33:11] shoulders was placed all of our sins
[1:33:14] upon his shoulders was placed all of our
[1:33:17] mistakes upon his shoulder was placed
[1:33:20] every mistake you ever did everything
[1:33:24] you're doing wrong now every mistake you
[1:33:26] were ever do he took it upon his
[1:33:28] shoulders only his shoulders could've
[1:33:32] carried our sins only his shoulders
[1:33:35] could have carried our mistakes up
[1:33:37] because we weren't strong enough to
[1:33:39] handle it so it took our kinsman
[1:33:41] redeemer it took somebody like us it
[1:33:44] took a brother
[1:33:47] [Applause]
[1:33:51] hallelujah don't you know Jesus is your
[1:33:54] brother but he's also your father he's
[1:33:57] also your God he's also your King he's
[1:34:00] also your Savior he's also your Redeemer
[1:34:03] he is also your restorer
[1:34:04] he's also Yahweh makeup hallelujah
[1:34:12] hallelujah oh you may be seated
[1:34:15] so Jesus had a secret mission so he had
[1:34:19] to leave glory he couldn't come as
[1:34:22] spirit yet into the earthly realm
[1:34:25] because he had to deal with the
[1:34:27] situation as a man so God so loved the
[1:34:31] world that he and move he himself
[1:34:35] transformed himself he had to come as
[1:34:41] flesh and blood not a spirit not yet
[1:34:44] that time will come but not yet God had
[1:34:50] to come because he had to win a battle
[1:34:52] on the earth so Almighty God left heaven
[1:34:57] and drop down on the earth of 16
[1:34:59] elements born in a manger warned of a
[1:35:03] virgin what did God do god slipped a
[1:35:06] secret weapon onto the earth that the
[1:35:10] devil didn't even recognize what was
[1:35:13] happening
[1:35:20] the greatest nuclear weapon the world
[1:35:22] ever saw was lying in a manger in
[1:35:25] Bethlehem hallelujah the devil had come
[1:35:36] into Eden and upset God's kingdom
[1:35:39] [Applause]
[1:35:40] [Music]
[1:35:42] but God did not want the devil to know
[1:35:44] how he was gonna fix the problem
[1:35:46] so whenever God starts something he
[1:35:49] always that small in for him to have the
[1:35:55] element of surprise he has to start
[1:35:57] small so he started as a baby and in
[1:36:00] your life for him to have the element of
[1:36:02] surprise he's gotta start small some
[1:36:06] small changes some small movement some
[1:36:09] small deliverances some small signs some
[1:36:13] small wonders some small miracles or you
[1:36:17] don't hear me this morning
[1:36:18] you may be seated for a minute one time
[1:36:21] or the Branum pray for somebody the hand
[1:36:24] was crippled up a little own feet and
[1:36:31] when the parent said here's what the
[1:36:35] person said my little fingers start to
[1:36:36] move he said if your little fingers are
[1:36:38] to move that's all you need because that
[1:36:41] small movement is a sign that little
[1:36:44] movement is coming give me another
[1:36:47] example that little boy that Elijah said
[1:36:50] go and see if the rain is coming he went
[1:36:54] the first time he went the second time
[1:36:56] he went the third time you see oh gosh I
[1:36:59] see nothing but after the seventh time

[1:37:05] was working out or not but he came back
[1:37:06] tired he said Elijah I don't know what
[1:37:09] this means
[1:37:10] but I see a cloud it's a tiny cloud it's
[1:37:14] like a man's hand Eli just hit run one
[1:37:18] would run you know what the Bible says
[1:37:22] Elijah was not a young man returns but
[1:37:25] the Bible said when Elijah heard that he
[1:37:28] ran faster than horses don't tell me
[1:37:32] that is Holy Ghost thing doesn't make
[1:37:35] you do superhuman thing Oh
[1:37:36] [Applause]
[1:37:40] radio Bible the Bible says that Elijah
[1:37:46] got to where he had to go before the
[1:37:48] horses got there it's you know one of
[1:37:51] two things and horses was doing this but
[1:37:54] Elijah was running so fast that the
[1:37:56] horses couldn't catch him
[1:37:58] and I'm seeing the horses of hello after
[1:38:00] you if you see the sign is warning it
[1:38:03] could be a small time but the devil
[1:38:05] cannot catch you cannot move you cannot
[1:38:08] change your mind you may be seated
[1:38:11] [Applause]

[1:38:42] hello baby baby crying baby wants milk
[1:38:48] and that baby no miracles yet no
[1:38:53] preaching yet but in that baby is the
[1:38:56] potential to turn over it in that baby
[1:39:04] is the potential to restore all that man
[1:39:07] lost in that baby is the potential what
[1:39:11] Abraham couldn't finish and Moses
[1:39:13] couldn't finish David couldn't finish
[1:39:16] Joshua couldn't finish a elisha couldn't
[1:39:18] finish in that baby that baby possessed
[1:39:24] all that he was was in that baby because
[1:39:27] all that God was he bought it's a christ
[1:39:29] in that baby

[1:39:35] you may be seated growing up in the
[1:39:42] temple growing up in the church he's on
[1:39:46] a secret mission but I love God because
[1:39:48] some of you here today you think you're
[1:39:50] here because somebody invited you when

[1:39:54] the father draws you first you you

[1:39:59] up in the church you trying to be
[1:40:00] resistant you have power to resist you

[1:40:06] he will flee from you why this is your
[1:40:09] jurisdiction you may not have the power
[1:40:13] yet but this is still yours because the
[1:40:16] Bible says we shall reign on the earth
[1:40:18] you may be seated
[1:40:20] recently a new president was elected
[1:40:25] before the installation ceremony before
[1:40:31] the swearing-in ceremony that person who
[1:40:34] is about to become president is called a
[1:40:37] president-elect

[1:41:56] more it means you have a ring on your

[1:42:10] the wedding is about to happen your
[1:42:12] party didn't change your party
[1:42:15] investigation he already decided you are
[1:42:18] the one he wants to be with oh god help

[1:42:22] mind that this lady is going to be flesh
[1:42:25] of my flesh blown up oh you know here
[1:42:27] minute
[1:42:28] anybody knows what I'm talking about
[1:42:30] this
[1:42:30] [Applause]
[1:42:36] you may be seated
[1:42:38] ever see when somebody get engaged
[1:42:43] decide to take pictures of your ring and
[1:42:47] they post it on Instagram because they
[1:42:56] want people to know I'm engaged I'm
[1:43:01] spoken for I'm with somebody I don't
[1:43:06] know what you were I'm with somebody
[1:43:09] under the Branham said that before the
[1:43:12] foundation of the world he put an
[1:43:14] engagement ring this unprotected nation
[1:43:19] is unsworn knowledge he elected you and
[1:43:22] said one day I'm gonna marry you
[1:43:28] you may be seated with the random taught
[1:43:35] us through every age they were elected
[1:43:39] that were predestinated so God had to
[1:43:45] wait a long time for this particular
[1:43:47] portion of that lady imposed a that was
[1:43:55] riding Martin's day there was bribe in
[1:43:58] our day this bride also to complete this
[1:44:02] whole image of God can the church say
[1:44:05] man everybody feeling fine so Jesus had
[1:44:13] a secret mission a secret ministry so
[1:44:23] everything he did was deliberate
[1:44:27] because you wanted to establish not
[1:44:30] himself but he wanted to establish man
[1:44:34] back in his position he was never the
[1:44:37] one out of position he made a choice to
[1:44:40] come down to earth to restore things or
[1:44:43] you don't hear me this morning it was
[1:44:45] man who lost his position Adam Adam
[1:44:48] where though
[1:44:53] it was not that God couldn't see where
[1:44:57] Adam was but Adam had lost his position
[1:45:02] he had fell from his authority he had
[1:45:06] fell from his place and God purpose to
[1:45:10] restore it so Jesus is growing up in the
[1:45:15] temple growing up in the church and I
[1:45:19] preached it before and he's growing up
[1:45:20] just like a young person in the church
[1:45:22] nobody know he is that's Joseph's boy
[1:45:25] that's a carpenter's boy a fine young
[1:45:27] man is a nice lad you see that little
[1:45:29] table he made and they don't even know
[1:45:35] they're playing with nuclear weapon
[1:45:39] [Applause]
[1:45:45] you know whenever you're transporting a
[1:45:47] nuclear weapon dick they put some sang
[1:45:49] on it warning signs God took the warning
[1:45:52] sign over this one because he didn't
[1:45:54] want the table to understand that it was
[1:45:56] a nuclear weapon yet slipped in until
[1:46:03] the time came for what God had planned
[1:46:06] note to begin to be unfolded the Bible
[1:46:10] says he's the author and the finisher of
[1:46:12] our faith so it means that this Bible
[1:46:15] what is written in here was actually
[1:46:17] planned out before it was even put into
[1:46:19] words form because it existed in God's
[1:46:22] mind so the Bible said the lamb was
[1:46:25] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:46:26] so if God is writing a diary before it
[1:46:29] happens in that diary he was right at
[1:46:32] the right time I'm gonna change form and
[1:46:35] come as a baby and I'm gonna be dropping
[1:46:37] her home and I'm gonna pick her young
[1:46:39] lady named Mary and she gonna be in kids
[1:46:41] a choice if they want to think something
[1:46:43] wrong with him so I'm gonna comfort him
[1:46:45] and send the angel to tell em it's gonna
[1:46:46] be all right
[1:46:47] he's taken care of everything
[1:46:50] [Applause]
[1:46:52] and in the plan is okay plan is seen one
[1:46:56] let Jesus begin to display who he is so
[1:46:58] on that day this is happening in the
[1:47:00] heavenlies but under that normal service
[1:47:02] and the elders allowed a young man to
[1:47:06] come read the scripture they say young
[1:47:08] Jesus won't you come and Jesus quietly
[1:47:11] nobody knows who he is where the candy
[1:47:13] comes up he finds where it is written in
[1:47:15] the scripture I said to read the Spirit
[1:47:17] of the Lord is upon me for he has
[1:47:20] anointed me to preach the gospel and I
[1:47:26] was reading and this is not something
[1:47:27] strange the young men they have this
[1:47:29] nice opportunity to to bless us but when
[1:47:34] Jesus finished and he closed the book he
[1:47:36] said this the scripture is fulfilled and
[1:47:41] I can imagine in the church he elders
[1:47:43] was like what in fact the Bible said
[1:47:52] they said to raise the question is not
[1:47:54] this Joseph's son quizzes this is not
[1:48:00] this is not Elisha son this is not it's
[1:48:02] not a it's not just Joseph's son but
[1:48:08] unbeknownst to the enemy
[1:48:09] I could you imagine what the devil is
[1:48:11] saying about you
[1:48:13] is this not George Sunnis that's not
[1:48:16] Jenny son is this not how come you
[1:48:19] talking about this D descriptives well
[1:48:22] how come you're talking them are you
[1:48:23] gonna get the Holy Ghost and you gonna
[1:48:25] be deliver you wanna be charged the
[1:48:33] devil's biggest mistake is the thing
[1:48:35] that your past and your family
[1:48:36] determines your future because the devil
[1:48:43] in understand the genetic code that
[1:48:45] Jesus had that he was not even from this
[1:48:46] earth the seeming devil looks at you
[1:48:48] didn't realize you not from it we are
[1:48:51] strangers we are just passing through
[1:48:53] one of these days I'm gonna be missing
[1:48:56] one of the disease I'm gonna be gone if
[1:48:58] you want to stay here that's you but
[1:49:01] goodbye world
[1:49:02] good morning glory can the church shame
[1:49:07] [Applause]
[1:49:10] so on a drive this home this morning
[1:49:14] so Jesus of the secret mission
[1:49:17] everything in his public ministry is for
[1:49:20] the public so when he goes his first
[1:49:22] miracle that wedding in Cana when he ran
[1:49:25] out of wine Mary comes to Jesus that
[1:49:29] Jesus hears what he runs a wine she's
[1:49:31] like what I have to do with me but Mary
[1:49:38] had a reveler to say she tell you
[1:49:40] brothers whatever this man see they do
[1:49:41] do it and Jessa get some water and bring
[1:49:46] some water and when in first of the pour
[1:49:49] water the water turned to wine with
[1:49:51] Antony not just wine you know but they
[1:49:54] say this wine so good because the custom
[1:50:00] was you serve your best thing first so
[1:50:03] that means they were not the best thing
[1:50:04] first of all they were the finish the
[1:50:06] best thing then the next best thing then
[1:50:08] he laughs he drags whatever is there was
[1:50:10] there everything finished really drink
[1:50:11] everything out but when Jesus lady water
[1:50:14] but the Branham said eventually that
[1:50:16] water would have met grapes eventually
[1:50:19] those grapes would have fermented
[1:50:20] eventually there would have been age
[1:50:22] over time but Jesus bypass the whole
[1:50:24] process and put time on it so when they
[1:50:28] tasted it is a witness who seems the
[1:50:30] best wine for last
[1:50:33] [Applause]
[1:50:34] but listen Jesus mission was not to turn
[1:50:38] water into wine they brought the blind
[1:50:43] they brought the whole they brought the
[1:50:45] lame that was public ministry he could
[1:50:49] have done it so he did and he would
[1:50:51] still qualify what he did by saying I do
[1:50:54] nothing except the Father show me first
[1:50:57] he goes to the Pool of Bethesda and they
[1:51:01] are hundreds of people sick and he finds
[1:51:03] one man and we said yesterday when he
[1:51:05] healed up man all of he'll get upset but
[1:51:08] that's what Jesus wanted because he
[1:51:11] wanted the devil to come after him
[1:51:14] because you wanted to overcome on the
[1:51:17] earth in this earthly realm he wanted to
[1:51:20] conquer in this earthly realm
[1:51:24] but Jesus also understood that the devil
[1:51:29] had the keys to death and hell and in
[1:51:32] order for Jesus to get the keys the
[1:51:34] death and hell he couldn't get it while
[1:51:36] he was in the earthly realm so when he
[1:51:39] shed his glory and came in flesh he also
[1:51:42] had to shed flesh and leave his flesh on
[1:51:46] the cross and leave his flesh moving
[1:51:48] around but while he was in flesh on the
[1:51:51] cross and moving around he already left
[1:51:53] that body he had to be in a different
[1:51:56] condition to step into hell to walk
[1:52:01] straight up to the devil and say give me
[1:52:04] that keys give me the keys to death
[1:52:07] give me the keys to hell or you don't
[1:52:10] hear me this morning another random said
[1:52:15] Jesus left hell with the keys on his
[1:52:18] waist the keys to death and hell so it's
[1:52:23] a Sunday morning nobody knew that this
[1:52:27] was going on when the disciples met
[1:52:29] Jesus they didn't know that he had went
[1:52:32] down and taking the keys he knew he said
[1:52:35] he was going to be raised up and even T
[1:52:37] didn't even believe it
[1:52:38] Thomas who see Jesus walk on water
[1:52:41] Thomas who saw all the miracles say I'm
[1:52:44] not gonna believe until I touched a near
[1:52:47] prisoners hand
[1:52:51] because what Jesus did nobody ever done
[1:52:54] before he said I have power to lay my
[1:52:57] life down and pick it back up again
[1:53:00] [Applause]
[1:53:05] so he already had power over death but
[1:53:12] he wanted to release his people who are
[1:53:16] in fear of that he was at a release
[1:53:19] Abraham and Ezekiel and Daniel and
[1:53:22] everyone who are tied who the devil had
[1:53:24] locked him up somebody back to me
[1:53:29] and he wanted to let you know that death
[1:53:32] is nothing to fear because I live you
[1:53:35] live also but more than that I took the
[1:53:38] keys I took the keys of debt I took the
[1:53:41] keys of hell I took the keys of the
[1:53:44] grave Oh hallelujah
[1:53:48] you may be seated Halloween so said
[1:53:57] yesterday it's like having a house your
[1:53:58] house is your realm and your keys is
[1:54:02] your jurisdiction because you have keys
[1:54:05] to your house you can open your house
[1:54:07] and you could walk in anytime you want
[1:54:10] because you have keys so your house and
[1:54:11] when you go to your house you can lock
[1:54:13] the door and when you lock the door you
[1:54:16] keep elements outside and you keep
[1:54:18] yourself safe on the inside so the devil
[1:54:22] is in RL as we seen to that
[1:54:23] RL monkey pants because he has a house
[1:54:26] but he has no keys he can't lock anybody
[1:54:29] in and he can stop anybody from getting
[1:54:32] out he have to watch people go in and
[1:54:34] out a door because you have no keys to
[1:54:37] control nothing because Jesus took the
[1:54:40] keys
[1:54:41] [Applause]
[1:54:46] so whatever situation you are in this
[1:54:48] morning there's no devil can hold you
[1:54:50] back because it never can lock you up
[1:54:53] Jesus already unlocked it and he has the
[1:54:56] keys you're healing already paid for
[1:55:04] your deliverance already paid for the
[1:55:07] Holy Ghost already paid for your baptism
[1:55:10] already paid for your adoption already
[1:55:13] in motion and no demon or devil those
[1:55:16] spirit that stop you
[1:55:18] somebody's amen
[1:55:20] [Applause]
[1:55:25] Oh glory glory glory glory glory
[1:55:35] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so the
[1:55:43] same way God had a secret mission that
[1:55:46] the world didn't see didn't understand
[1:55:48] couldn't relate to he has a secret
[1:55:51] mission going on in your life right now
[1:55:52] that the devil doesn't understand he
[1:55:55] can't figure it out because he was
[1:55:57] supposed to be dead you are supposed to
[1:55:59] be defeated you are supposed to be a
[1:56:01] statistic but here you are this morning
[1:56:04] giving God praise giving God thanks and
[1:56:06] the word is coming to you in a real way
[1:56:09] to remind you that you come from God and
[1:56:11] you go back to God those are not just
[1:56:13] words but you come from God and you're
[1:56:16] going back to God hallelujah
[1:56:18] somebody say man this morning we
[1:56:22] celebrate the resurrection of the Living
[1:56:24] King Confucius is dead Muhammad is dead
[1:56:27] Buddha is dead every other God is dead
[1:56:30] but Jesus Christ is alive an Easter it
[1:56:34] means our freedom it means our
[1:56:36] restoration it means our attention is a
[1:56:40] means Pentecost Easter means a super
[1:56:43] Church in some beans another Ephesians
[1:56:48] Easter also means that God once again
[1:56:51] change form
[1:56:54] he was spirit he became flesh he changed
[1:56:58] form again went down into hell change
[1:57:00] form again in a glorified body transform
[1:57:04] himself as Holy Spirit he may be seated
[1:57:11] [Applause]
[1:57:14] man was in the Garden of Eden and he was
[1:57:17] pushed out I eaten then the whole of the
[1:57:19] Old Testament was speaking about a
[1:57:21] natural land so it was always being in a
[1:57:24] in a location in a position so in Eden
[1:57:26] in the land but when Jesus came he
[1:57:30] changed a whole geographical thing for
[1:57:33] you and he gives you a new land of
[1:57:36] promise
[1:57:36] call the lamb the Holy Ghost he also
[1:57:39] called a lampion in Christ so he said if
[1:57:43] any man be in Christ he's a new creature
[1:57:46] there's therefore now no condemnation to
[1:57:49] them that I in Christ Jesus you don't
[1:57:52] hear me this morning but listen when he
[1:57:55] was father you couldn't be in him in
[1:57:57] that kind of a way when he walked in the
[1:57:59] earth you couldn't be in him because he
[1:58:01] was flesh but now that he is spirit and
[1:58:03] he represents the land the promise now
[1:58:06] you could step into that land no wonder
[1:58:08] he can say the same works I do you shall
[1:58:11] do also and I thought do you wanna know
[1:58:13] I'm in the father he and me are you you
[1:58:17] Oh somebody help me this mornin
[1:58:20] [Applause]
[1:58:26] hallelujah
[1:58:29] so Easter meant all that Adam lost could
[1:58:33] now be restored Eastern now meant that
[1:58:37] there was a higher law that is to prove
[1:58:40] that there was a higher law because the
[1:58:42] law said it because you fell in sin that
[1:58:44] you are finished
[1:58:45] the law says because you made a mistake
[1:58:48] you can stand the law found a woman
[1:58:51] caught in the act of adultery and when
[1:58:59] Jesus walked past you see Lord this
[1:59:01] woman was caught in the very act and
[1:59:03] everybody happier stones and 1/4 the law
[1:59:06] if she is caught she should be stood
[1:59:08] Jesus didn't refute the law he does say
[1:59:11] listen whoever don't have sinned by one
[1:59:17] means cast the first stone and so that
[1:59:20] Jesus don't embarrass anybody he turned
[1:59:22] his back and when you look back around
[1:59:24] he's a woman where are your accusers
[1:59:27] everybody suddenly realized had
[1:59:30] something more important to do than
[1:59:31] stone this is turning anointed left them
[1:59:36] stolen inspiration yes yes well you know
[1:59:39] what I don't feel inspired as soon
[1:59:40] anymore because he addressed the sin
[1:59:43] issue he see when man fell he fell into
[1:59:47] sin into sickness into death and he lost
[1:59:51] his inheritance so when Jesus came he
[1:59:54] had to come to restore everything so he
[1:59:57] came to turn sin over because for all of
[2:00:01] the time since man fell they offered
[2:00:03] bulls and goats as a sacrifice because
[2:00:07] God is merciful
[2:00:08] so he said if you sin let the lamb take
[2:00:11] your place but that was only temporary
[2:00:16] because that lamb blood was only
[2:00:18] covering the sin but Jesus came to
[2:00:22] dissolve sit altogether
[2:00:28] not to cover the sin anymore
[2:00:30] but by his blood he brought Redemption
[2:00:33] by his blood he brought cleansing by his
[2:00:36] bloody paw transformation by his blood
[2:00:40] so what the devil didn't realize is that
[2:00:43] when Jesus came it wasn't just a healer
[2:00:45] because the children official they had
[2:00:47] testimonies they knew what Moses did
[2:00:49] didn't you about Elijah in knew about
[2:00:52] miracles it wasn't like miracles was
[2:00:53] foreign to them
[2:00:55] but when Jesus came it is what he did in
[2:00:58] combination that upset the kingdom of
[2:01:01] Hell forever because he paid the price
[2:01:04] for sin permanently no more you need
[2:01:07] gold on cheapen plus he broke the veil
[2:01:12] from top to bottom brought the power of
[2:01:15] the priesthood say no you were priests
[2:01:17] you have direct access to God so he
[2:01:19] dealt with the sin situation he tells me
[2:01:22] the access situation he does with the
[2:01:24] sickness situation because the blood
[2:01:26] also came to take care of your
[2:01:28] sicknesses and then he changed our
[2:01:32] spirit to deal with your nature and then
[2:01:36] he took the keys of death and hell to
[2:01:39] let you know that you're not gonna die
[2:01:42] that death can't hold you the grave
[2:01:46] can't keep you so at a time Paul gets
[2:01:48] there he said death where is your sting
[2:01:50] grave where is your victory
[2:01:52] you've already been broken oh come on
[2:01:56] now so this morning we live by a higher
[2:01:59] law
[2:02:02] we don't live by the law of nature we
[2:02:04] don't live by the law of the world we
[2:02:07] live by the law of God we live by the
[2:02:09] law of the FT we live by the law of
[2:02:12] resurrection power we live by the Lord
[2:02:14] to defy gravity we live by the law not
[2:02:17] to defy depth and defy sickness and
[2:02:20] define somebody give God a shout of
[2:02:23] praise you belong to call this morning
[2:02:26] Oh hallelujah and because we belong to
[2:02:30] him he will do whatever it takes to get
[2:02:33] you back he's not gonna leave you
[2:02:36] he's not gonna leave your family he's
[2:02:38] not gonna leave you in the house of the
[2:02:39] enemy you belong to God you bet you
[2:02:42] don't belong to Satan this morning oh I

[2:03:23] service is about is to remind you that

[2:03:28] that you have access this morning to

[2:06:52] retail therapy they say when you shop

[2:07:27] temporary high but in this grocery where
[2:07:31] you take joy you get a permanent high
[2:07:35] joy unspeakable full of glory when you
[2:07:39] take this joy pill and this gospel and
[2:07:42] this happiness pill you can lose your
[2:07:49] job and still have joy the devil confuse
[2:07:55] you may be seated
[2:07:57] I don't care how bad things get listen
[2:08:00] friends no matter how tough things got
[2:08:03] in your life you still eat something
[2:08:05] isn't that right because the Bible said
[2:08:07] I've never seen my seatback bread God
[2:08:10] will work things out for you to eat
[2:08:13] every day he promised to supply all your
[2:08:16] need and what you need in this world is
[2:08:19] temporary because we are leaving this
[2:08:22] earth to go to a place way at all have
[2:08:25] to eat no more good have to cry no more
[2:08:28] don't have to feel pain no more that's
[2:08:31] what Jesus died for and when he rose
[2:08:33] again he proved that that couldn't hold
[2:08:36] him
[2:08:37] [Applause]
[2:08:44] hallelujah Oh glory glory glory so when
[2:08:53] Jesus rose again he opened the door into
[2:08:57] the land of the Holy Ghost by pouring
[2:09:00] out his spirit up to when Jesus died
[2:09:02] Peter and they still struggled the
[2:09:05] disciples still had hard times when
[2:09:07] Jesus died he went back fishing because
[2:09:11] they need to have not yet been changed
[2:09:12] you can go all the church services in
[2:09:15] the world and I wouldn't change your
[2:09:18] nature they can change your behavior
[2:09:20] temporarily but once you're out of that
[2:09:23] atmosphere you go back to how you used
[2:09:25] to be but God wanted a place of
[2:09:30] permanent solution not a temporary
[2:09:33] solution the blood of bulls and goats
[2:09:36] was a temporary solution but when Jesus
[2:09:39] died he brought a permanent solution
[2:09:41] committed Church is a temporary solution
[2:09:43] but one of these days he says you're
[2:09:46] gonna be in Christ not in church but in
[2:09:48] Christ and in Christ you are a new
[2:09:51] creature not temporary not one day I'm
[2:09:55] up not one day I'm down not I fighting
[2:09:58] my way back there's no fighting no we're
[2:10:00] back when you are in Christ you are in
[2:10:02] Christ
[2:10:04] when you are in Christ diamond or you're
[2:10:06] in Christ when your implies the devil is
[2:10:09] afraid of you
[2:10:10] [Applause]
[2:10:16] you maybe see that I'm not gonna be too
[2:10:18] much longer
[2:10:19] listen the devil still hasn't recovered
[2:10:21] you know to devastate a recovery you
[2:10:27] know but the random Twitter that when
[2:10:29] Jesus was in the wilderness being tested
[2:10:30] and he said it is written it is also
[2:10:32] written his written it is written is
[2:10:34] also written it was like electric volts
[2:10:36] in the devil he said the devil with an
[2:10:40] avocation I don't know who he left in
[2:10:43] charge but the other way through first
[2:10:47] season and that wasn't even power it was
[2:10:50] just a word you don't hear me this
[2:10:53] morning so the devil may have just been
[2:10:56] recuperating from his vacation when he
[2:11:00] went to get therapy for what Jesus did
[2:11:02] in the wilderness when he concocted a
[2:11:05] plan to crucify Jesus and the devil
[2:11:08] taught that this was his sweet revenge
[2:11:10] but he finally was able to get Jesus to
[2:11:13] die because he had got me around today
[2:11:16] and you got to give it to time and every
[2:11:19] tiny yellow celebration the devil's not
[2:11:25] the plan is celebration by the toil
[2:11:26] because he had to get Jesus if he could
[2:11:30] just kill Jesus it was all his trouble
[2:11:32] vanish and he would prepare for his next
[2:11:35] target he was used to it in centuries
[2:11:38] you doing this he knew David he knew era
[2:11:40] ham he know Joshua you know Elijah every
[2:11:43] man will come he will battle with them
[2:11:45] and every time is your gosh whose shoes
[2:11:48] and then the next one will come and he
[2:11:51] was used to it he was accustomed to it
[2:12:01] and when Jesus died the devil thought it
[2:12:03] was just like Iran I'm just like David
[2:12:09] so could you imagine where it is the
[2:12:13] Sunday morning
[2:12:15] [Applause]
[2:12:21] when until they realized this one is
[2:12:23] different
[2:12:23] [Applause]
[2:12:25] this one was dead but yes Dan dead
[2:12:28] [Applause]
[2:12:31] listen you may be seated the problems
[2:12:34] done anytime
[2:12:35] that's 120 devil tone was supposed to
[2:12:37] happen the problems to get back up you
[2:12:43] imagine the confusion and when you kill
[2:12:51] him the Calculon again and then Jesus as
[2:12:56] with an antenna priests on Friday night
[2:12:58] start to open up the data pottery plan
[2:13:01] he wanted to reproduce himself
[2:13:09] you may be seated you have to understand
[2:13:13] it's not good starter this is it that
[2:13:16] was added it but we will finish it I
[2:13:20] [Music]
[2:13:22] have a sailor I are looking for trouble
[2:13:24] but if trouble come we'll deal with it
[2:13:27] and when the devil came in cause Eden
[2:13:30] God see fine take it
[2:13:32] good I would owe it because I'm eternity
[2:13:39] the devil was created so he belongs to
[2:13:42] time so time doesn't move God he's from
[2:13:45] eternity he steps in and out of time to
[2:13:48] eternity for his purpose so when Jesus
[2:13:52] came and rose again no TVs two of the
[2:13:55] plans had to unfold here comes Peter
[2:13:57] here comes James
[2:13:59] here comes John they afraid for their
[2:14:02] lives but they rejoicing in their heart
[2:14:04] because they could read recall how
[2:14:06] Easter made them feel but Jesus left
[2:14:09] them didn't really understand why he
[2:14:13] left the understanding was open but he
[2:14:14] knew something was gonna happen didn't
[2:14:16] even know what it meant and the devil
[2:14:18] when Jesus left he said well wash he
[2:14:21] died he rose again heal and is he left
[2:14:25] could imagine the devil went through a
[2:14:27] really an emotional time in
[2:14:30] and put a billy policy a poor devil did
[2:14:35] everyone emotion he had to deal with all
[2:14:36] these do miracles the healings and
[2:14:39] deliverances and Jesus died he got
[2:14:42] temporary relief and Jesus rose again he
[2:14:44] gets a cardiac arrest and then and then
[2:14:48] Jesus left if you level that's about
[2:14:49] himself I'm gonna Brandon said like this
[2:14:52] he said when they were in the upper room
[2:14:53] the devil wasn't bothered he used to
[2:14:56] people making noise entering he was
[2:14:58] there when they were shouting Hosanna
[2:14:59] that didn't bother him but he said when
[2:15:01] pizza walked out of the upper room and
[2:15:07] went by here caught beautiful and saw
[2:15:10] the man who he knew because he was lame
[2:15:12] for a long time and pizza who made
[2:15:16] mistakes Peter who denied Christ Pete oh
[2:15:20] who chopped off the man is only a short
[2:15:23] while ago it wasn't like Peter was a
[2:15:25] long-standing believer just a short
[2:15:28] while ago Jesus just died and rose again
[2:15:31] Peter just got delivered but all of a
[2:15:34] sudden he the consist silver and gold I
[2:15:37] don't have but such as I have
[2:15:40] he wasn't praying for it he said such as
[2:15:43] I have I give it all to you
[2:15:48] brother branham said Red Alert started
[2:15:52] to happen in Hill wha-wha-wha Malone
[2:15:56] I told Jesus bed they said it looked
[2:15:58] like he multiplied himself he talked
[2:16:00] looking like Jesus James looking like
[2:16:02] Jesus John looking like Jesus
[2:16:05] [Applause]
[2:16:13] Oh somebody help me this morning and
[2:16:19] listen listen this never even happened
[2:16:22] with Jesus but Peter is walking and the
[2:16:26] Bible says people were being healed in
[2:16:28] the shadow the greatest weapon the world
[2:16:36] had ever seen was slipped as a baby
[2:16:38] right under the devil eyes and then the
[2:16:41] devil thought he had Peter listen you
[2:16:47] ever see this when Peter went back
[2:16:49] fishing when Jesus died you'd ever see
[2:16:52] look at them they couldn't even look
[2:16:53] Chee and a half years look at him
[2:16:56] gone right back this always the devil
[2:17:01] didn't even understand that there was a
[2:17:05] secret mission going on beyond the veil
[2:17:08] beyond the eyes there was a
[2:17:11] transformation there was a sea that was
[2:17:12] planted in Peters soul that the devil
[2:17:14] couldn't pull out and all of Peters
[2:17:17] mistakes and failures couldn't take that
[2:17:20] seed out of his soul he took a backslide
[2:17:23] even in Matthew 16 Jesus turned to Peter
[2:17:27] and say get behind me Satan
[2:17:28] and that didn't even touch the seed that
[2:17:32] was in Peter soul the seeding with the
[2:17:35] soul was destined for the upper room and
[2:17:38] the seed in your soul is destined for
[2:17:40] your upper room experience
[2:17:43] [Applause]
[2:17:49] come on was finished Oh hallelujah how
[2:17:56] is this possible Peter was always a part
[2:18:01] of God just like Jesus he was pleased
[2:18:08] there for a purpose
[2:18:12] just like Jesus he was there for a
[2:18:14] purpose a part of the mystery that God
[2:18:18] was unfolding he didn't know it
[2:18:21] Peter growing up as a fisherman had no
[2:18:23] idea that there was a higher purpose for
[2:18:26] his life the same way every one of us in
[2:18:28] here have a revelation that is a higher
[2:18:31] purpose for our lives and no devil no
[2:18:35] depression no demon could stop that
[2:18:37] purpose from being accomplished and we
[2:18:39] are in fishing balls this morning
[2:18:41] swimming around life thinking we are in
[2:18:43] control and gold I just waitin waitin
[2:18:46] waitin until like soil he could drop you
[2:18:49] from offer your horse and give you a
[2:18:52] burning bush experience give you an
[2:18:55] experience of a transformed your soul
[2:18:58] that you who are free to testify will
[2:19:01] suddenly be able to testify that it is
[2:19:04] all over me and it's keeping me alive
[2:19:06] you need to testify on your job testify
[2:19:10] in your home testify in your school how
[2:19:13] you made it
[2:19:14] testify that you have your own
[2:19:16] resurrection experience that you have
[2:19:18] your own restoration experience you had
[2:19:20] your own deliverance experience that you
[2:19:23] are just a man but behind us can feel is
[2:19:26] a seed of God that has a destination at
[2:19:29] his glory we shall not all sleep but
[2:19:32] it's gonna be a rapture there's gonna be
[2:19:35] a deliverance there's gonna be a wedding
[2:19:37] supper glory to God kinda Chertsey man
[2:19:42] Oh hallelujah hallelujah
[2:19:48] my my my I'm almost finished the
[2:19:51] musician to get ready so let's just
[2:19:54] touch this here when the Sabbath was
[2:19:58] passed Mary Magdalene and Mary the
[2:20:00] mother of James and Salome had brought
[2:20:02] sweet spices that am i come to anoint
[2:20:05] him and very early in the morning the
[2:20:09] first day of the week they came unto the
[2:20:10] sepulchre at the rising of the Sun and
[2:20:13] they said among themselves who shall
[2:20:14] roll us away the stone from the door of
[2:20:17] the sifaka and friends didn't come
[2:20:20] expecting to see Jesus not there they
[2:20:24] came to unknowing the body they came out
[2:20:27] of reverence and respect and brother
[2:20:30] branham type that he said the devil I
[2:20:31] tried to bind the wood Jesus the word
[2:20:34] they put a stone you know where they put
[2:20:36] the stone there they put the stone
[2:20:39] because they were afraid because they
[2:20:42] heard a rumor going around that children
[2:20:44] are raised from the dead so they put a
[2:20:46] stone in a very big stone not only they
[2:20:49] put a stone but they put God's
[2:20:54] because therefore afraid by the irony
[2:20:57] that the disciples will come and take
[2:20:58] the body and say you see he rose from
[2:21:01] the dead so they put a stone and they
[2:21:05] put guards to make sure that a true man
[2:21:08] doesn't come to pass but how you could
[2:21:12] put a stone if God pulled Lazarus od
[2:21:18] grave if he walked on do you know
[2:21:21] sometimes one Davie the other thinking
[2:21:22] you know if somebody has power to say
[2:21:26] peace be still
[2:21:27] if he has power to take five loaves and
[2:21:30] two fishes and feed 5000 if he has power
[2:21:34] to raise Jairus daughter if he has per
[2:21:39] hope a stone
[2:21:46] and a few men clearly didn't think it
[2:21:51] true but it was a good effort and the
[2:21:55] devil has made a good effort to try to
[2:21:58] put a stone in front of your life and
[2:22:00] try to put glads to stop your
[2:22:03] resurrection
[2:22:04] [Applause]
[2:22:05] [Music]
[2:22:09] but the my Bible tells me I don't know
[2:22:12] about yours but my Bible tell me if that
[2:22:13] seems spirit that raised Christ from the
[2:22:18] dead dwells in you and dwells in me it
[2:22:23] should represent type of reaction like
[2:22:32] when Jesus was here
[2:22:36] so if you put Jesus and put a stone and
[2:22:40] put men and if you put put a Jerome
[2:22:42] behind stone and men and the same spirit
[2:22:45] that was in Christ Jesus is in him what
[2:22:48] stone what man what nature what
[2:22:53] situation what sickness
[2:23:01] [Music]
[2:23:06] [Applause]
[2:23:10] he may be seated
[2:23:17] that stone brother Jerome was the very
[2:23:21] first witness of the resurrection
[2:23:25] [Applause]
[2:23:28] so whatever stone if it's a stone of
[2:23:30] sickness this morning that sickness will
[2:23:33] be the first witness of your
[2:23:36] resurrection if it's a problem in your
[2:23:39] marriage that stone will be the first
[2:23:42] witness of your resurrection if it's
[2:23:46] what's going on any with your children
[2:23:47] with your family that stone will be the
[2:23:50] first witness that you are not dead
[2:24:04] [Applause]
[2:24:10] [Music]
[2:24:14] but the random said it ladies if Christ
[2:24:16] the wood has been placed in your heart
[2:24:18] and the devil tries to block that life
[2:24:21] in you from being lived out so he would
[2:24:24] please stones to try to block that life
[2:24:28] from coming out but this morning we asks
[2:24:32] a question like this who will roll away
[2:24:35] the stone because those sisters came to
[2:24:38] unknowing Jesus and they themselves
[2:24:40] couldn't move the stone but the angel of
[2:24:43] the Lord he came to move the stone from
[2:24:47] their lives and the angel of the Lord is
[2:24:49] here this morning to move the stone from
[2:24:52] our lives so that you can walk out
[2:24:55] victorious walk out as an overcomer walk
[2:24:59] out as a conqueror because he is the
[2:25:03] Conqueror we are also now more than
[2:25:05] conquerors so it's time that we begin to
[2:25:11] act like more than conquerors and the
[2:25:14] very action of moving like conquerors
[2:25:18] starts to get the devil so afraid that
[2:25:21] he has to let you go because he doesn't
[2:25:24] know how much like him you really are
[2:25:26] I'm to protect himself he has to stand
[2:25:29] far away lest he get the same kind of
[2:25:32] response that Jesus gave him because the
[2:25:40] devil didn't even know who Jesus was and
[2:25:43] if he couldn't even figure out who Jesus
[2:25:45] was how will you know who you even
[2:25:49] to the devlins being cautious this
[2:25:51] morning he is trying to see if he could
[2:25:54] pin you down but like the Bible says if
[2:25:57] you resist him he has to flee because
[2:26:00] this is your jurisdiction this is your
[2:26:03] realm this belongs to you and it's just
[2:26:09] a matter of time before the resurrection
[2:26:12] power which is the dynamics strikes the
[2:26:16] mechanics words seen in your soul that
[2:26:19] has been preached for all these years
[2:26:20] by a vindicated prophet that a message
[2:26:24] of deliverance to speak and Easter for
[2:26:27] the bride because the bride hasn't had a
[2:26:29] revival yet she hasn't had a
[2:26:31] resurrection yet but it's coming that
[2:26:34] scene has been in the ground for a long
[2:26:36] time and the devil thinks you are over
[2:26:39] the devil think you are finished but you
[2:26:42] are gonna make it on any day now it
[2:26:45] could be today you can break out of that
[2:26:47] stone break out of your grave break out
[2:26:51] of your tube

[2:27:01] of God take your position in the Holy
