[1:33] it reason this was blessed is the man
[1:36] that walketh not in the counsel of the
[1:40] ungodly nor standeth in the way of
[1:44] sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the
[1:47] scornful but his delight is in the law
[1:50] of the Lord and in his law doth he
[1:53] meditate day and night and he shall be
[1:58] like a tree planted by the rivers of
[1:59] water that bringeth forth his fruit in
[2:02] his season his leaf also shall not
[2:04] wither and whatsoever he doeth shall
[2:07] prosper but the ungodly are not so but

[28:55] hallelujah well today I want to bring a
[28:58] thought to you and I brought some slides
[29:00] along maybe the brothers will help me to
[29:02] get them going for you and I would like
[29:05] us to stand as we go straight to the
[29:06] scriptures and I have a selection of
[29:09] scriptures which it is my prayer that
[29:12] they will be inspiring to you in this
[29:16] great inspiration they that sow in tears
[29:22] shall reap in joy a man and it's a very
[29:28] very special inspiration to me I wanted
[29:31] to start in the book of Genesis chapter
[29:34] 47 because we're talking about seed
[29:37] today seed in the days of Joseph was the
[29:42] most valuable commodity it was almost a
[29:47] currency in itself it was worth more
[29:51] than money practically and and I hope we
[29:55] feel the same way today that these seeds
[29:58] are so precious shall we say exceedingly
[30:01] precious amen
[30:04] Jose is Genesis 47 and then Joe and 23
[30:09] then Joseph said unto the people behold
[30:13] I have bought you this day and your land
[30:18] for pharaoh lo here is seed for you and
[30:23] you shall sow the land praise the Lord
[30:28] sow the seed and they're sewing it
[30:32] Joseph never did it
[30:33] you have to sow and Hosea 10:12 goes on
[30:39] to say so to yourselves in righteousness
[30:44] reap in mercy break up your fallow
[30:50] ground for it is time
[30:54] to seek the Lord till he come and reign
[30:59] righteousness upon you Amos 8:11 behold
[31:06] the days come saith the Lord that I will
[31:11] send a famine in the land not a famine
[31:17] of bread nor a thirst of water but of
[31:24] hearing the words hearing the words of
[31:29] the Lord let's go on to acts 3 6 then
[31:36] Peter said silver and gold have I none
[31:41] hmm but such as I have I give thee in
[31:47] the name of Jesus Christ rise up and
[31:51] walk let's close with Galatians 3:16
[31:55] Thank You brothers now to Abraham and
[32:00] his seed were the promises made and is
[32:05] safe not seeds and to seeds as of many
[32:09] but as of one and to thy seed which is
[32:15] Christ Lord Jesus we want to thank you
[32:19] just for this honor to speak about your
[32:21] word and Lord to get behind Malachi for
[32:24] as your word has taught us and but the
[32:29] Branham picked up this great statement
[32:31] it is God's law to receive a vindicated
[32:37] servant and Lord Jesus we thank you for
[32:41] Malachi 4 in this season we see the
[32:44] vindication we see how you've worked
[32:47] with him
[32:48] we see the perfect sounding of his
[32:50] message God we just can't thank you
[32:53] enough that we have been called by this
[32:56] voice of the seventh angel God we give
[33:00] you glory and we give you praise today
[33:02] be with us in these few words may they
[33:05] bring great encouragement
[33:07] in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen you
[33:10] can't be seen it says God bless you I've
[33:17] got a title I'm trying to harmonize and
[33:21] synchronize with the inspiration today
[33:24] which is sowing and reaping and I've
[33:27] just chosen a title oh here is seed amen
[33:31] and we know that one of the greatest
[33:33] messages brother Branham preached on
[33:35] seed is the spoken word is the original
[33:40] seed praise be to God and we are just
[33:44] gonna touch on this great scenario which
[33:47] happened in in Genesis 47 where I tell
[33:52] you the famine you can't say they were
[33:54] surprised because Joseph was under a
[33:57] kind of eagle anointing where he knew it
[34:00] was coming he knew there would be good
[34:03] time and he knew there would be a bad
[34:05] time after that and that Eagle anointing
[34:09] prepared him for that bad time to come
[34:12] and Joseph put all that seed into
[34:16] storage and we've been told the same
[34:19] thing by brother Branham to store up the
[34:22] food amen
[34:23] in your car you should be having the
[34:25] tapes playing amen if you go online you
[34:31] should be looking at what the Prophet is
[34:32] saying don't waste your good years spend
[34:37] your good year as well get into the
[34:40] messages spent your time praying spend
[34:44] your time going through the books and
[34:46] spend your time just storing up and when
[34:50] you think you've got enough store up
[34:51] some more and add some more and some
[34:54] more you will never have enough of this
[34:56] message praise the Lord and what you
[34:59] store will become spiritual food in due
[35:03] season there's coming a time when when
[35:06] everybody is crying amen when the
[35:09] pressure comes down something is going
[35:11] to rise up in you the world will never
[35:14] understand it but God is already on the
[35:17] job now
[35:18] are you glad for Malachi 4 can you wave
[35:21] your hand and say Amen hallelujah to God
[35:25] be the glory
[35:26] I'm going to go my first slide brother
[35:28] at the back there and I'm taking a quote
[35:30] just to start with the the seed is not
[35:33] air with the shock and I want to start
[35:36] with this Luther went to husk with his
[35:39] first word that just shall live by faith
[35:43] Wesley had two words amen and it was
[35:49] sanctification the second work of grace
[35:52] Pentecost had the third word the
[35:56] restoration of the gifts Amen so that
[35:59] was the three that came but the entire
[36:03] seed has to come forth the entire seed
[36:09] and I'm so glad for this message which
[36:13] is the entire seed of God amen
[36:16] brother Branham called at the end time
[36:19] seed sign when you see the seed come
[36:23] only in this time can we say lo here is
[36:27] seed for you because the end time has
[36:31] produced the entire seed Luther couldn't
[36:34] do that Luther could only preach
[36:37] justification Moosa could only say lo
[36:41] here is justification he was surrounded
[36:46] by Catholicism but he said here I stand
[36:49] so help me God here I stand by faith
[36:55] alone solo today he stood and all Luther
[37:00] to say is no here is justification or
[37:04] Wesley could say is lo here is
[37:08] sanctification a man that's all he had
[37:12] he never knew the things that were
[37:15] coming later
[37:16] but he said lo here is sanctification
[37:19] and he and the spirit roared through him
[37:23] lo here they call them Methodists but he
[37:27] said lo it is living right the pentacle
[37:31] they received the baptism of the Holy
[37:33] Ghost and they said lo here is the Holy
[37:36] Ghost here is the new birth here is
[37:40] baptism in Jesus Christ's name
[37:42] here's the gifts of the Spirit but they
[37:45] weren't there yet because there was
[37:47] coming one more stage and we can say in
[37:51] this age though here is seed for you
[37:54] from Malachi for it is precious seed
[37:59] hallelujah it is great seed exceedingly
[38:03] precious praise be to God I'm so glad
[38:07] just to know these things we living in
[38:10] the seed age hallelujah who can show
[38:13] them into these things hallelujah glory
[38:17] be to the name of the Lord amen that's
[38:21] what we are with we are a seed people we
[38:26] have the entirety of the seed the
[38:29] entirety you know you can take one drop
[38:33] of water out of the sea and that drop of
[38:37] water contains the whole ocean
[38:40] hallelujah even though it's only one
[38:43] drop but every element of the ocean is
[38:46] in that one drop and I tell you the seed
[38:50] that Malachi 4 is giving us brother it's
[38:54] got everything in it everything you need
[38:57] is in it even rapturing faith is in that
[39:00] seed hallelujah glory to God rapturing
[39:05] faith is inside there hey man if you
[39:08] need a healing it's in there if you need
[39:11] deliverance is in there if you need the
[39:14] Holy Ghost it's in there
[39:15] hallelujah by these promises you shall
[39:19] become like God Himself praise the Lord
[39:22] glory be seated for a moment spoken word
[39:26] is the original seed what I'm trying to

[51:12] he came to Jerusalem and he he left
[51:16] Jerusalem a bit wandering and he took
[51:20] his Bible and he went into a portion of
[51:24] Isaiah and at the same time God was
[51:29] working an angel was directing someone
[51:33] and he sat there what does this mean and
[51:38] Philip came up to him and said these
[51:43] words I understand this now what you're
[51:49] reading
[51:50] do you understand so it's not just he
[51:54] had the Bible he had the written word

[52:01] reading he said who is this man what's
[52:09] the prophet talking of himself or was he
[52:13] talking about another one and Philip was
[52:17] listening and Philip said lo this is
[52:22] geez
[52:24] that we're talking about it and he gave
[52:27] him the seed and he baptized the eunuch
[52:30] and by the time he finished baptism the
[52:33] unit came to thank him and Philip was
[52:35] gone because he did his work hallelujah
[52:39] let me read before the brown said he
[52:41] said although an angel directed Philip
[52:44] to him but the germ of life had to come
[52:48] through the body Philip or brother we're
[52:52] on the line now where the germ come from
[52:55] through the angel no the angel showed
[52:58] him where to go an angel is a messenger

[53:07] the message the word that's how a child
[53:11] can be born hallelujah
[53:14] Church I'm so glad for this seed that we
[53:17] have we're not only reading the Bible

[53:33] thing you can have the Bible here but

[53:38] original seed the Bible has got to be in
[53:41] you the word is a seed as long as it's
[53:48] laying here
[53:49] it won't do nothing but when it comes in
[53:53] here then it begins to manifest by the
[53:59] Holy Spirit the works of God then
[54:02] visions come power comes humility comes

[54:16] to be inside here hallelujah
[54:19] I put a picture up there if you if you
[54:22] catch it
[54:22] amen about Jesus walking on the road to
[54:26] Emmaus Church
[54:28] the disciples were walking with him and
[54:30] he said didn't our hearts burn within us
[54:34] because the word was already inside here
[54:37] and when Christ spoke there it is their
[54:41] hearts was burning because the word was
[54:43] already inside there
[54:44] it was reviving the word that was
[54:46] already in there hallelujah
[54:49] while Jesus was just walking he didn't
[54:51] tell them who he was but their heart was
[54:54] burning and burning and burning Church

[56:15] but Ethan anyway it will change you
[56:19] praise be to God if you want to go in
[56:22] the rapture eat that word get that word
[56:25] on the inside praise be to God that's
[56:28] why we're so glad he said in spoken word
[56:31] here is the secret the word is in the
[56:39] bride
[56:41] and the mind of Christ to know what he
[56:44] wants done with the word and she does it
[56:49] in his name
[56:51] praise God she has thus saith the Lord
[56:54] then it is germanized the Holy Spirit
