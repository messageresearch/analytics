way Lord and as we approach your word may you come in a special way and minister to your people tonight in Jesus name I ask it amen God bless you welcome and all for Wednesday night service thanks for coming out s of your Bibles I like you to turn to 2 Peter 1 you want to read 3 to1 Philippians chapter 22-6 and reading from second Peter 1 reading verse three according as his divine power had given unto us all things that pertain to life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby given under us exceeding great and precious promise that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the vual lust and besides this and listen to the approach giv all diligence that's the key underlining approach you know add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge to knowledge Temperance to Temperance patience to patience godliness and to brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity and if these things be in you and abound they make you that he shall neither be barren nor un fruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lacked these things is blind and come see a far off had forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather Brethren this is the script we want to get to now uh give diligence to make your calling an election sure for if you do these things he shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the Everlasting King Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and from Philippians chapter 2 we going to read from verse 12 and Paul speaks wherefore my beloved as he have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling for it is God which worketh in you both to Will and to do his good pleasure do all things without murmurings and disputings that he may be blameless and harmless the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse Nation among whom you shine as lights of the world holding forth the word of life that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I have not run in vain neither labor in vain let's pray father we thank you for your word again and I pray that you would Breathe upon it breath life in it and minister to your people in Jesus name I ask it amen you may be seated praise the Lord amen praise God you know a couple of years ago I wanted to make an appointment with my dentist this dentist that I knew since I was down in Belmont uh dentist that I had um since living in pois pain and sometimes you know you run to other dentist in the area now um in AR remon so like that so I wanted to make an appointment to see my dentist at I have over 20 something years and when I call it's the office that have different Dental people there and so on you have to call to the secretary and then they will put you on and me an appointment and something like so when I call for appointment there was a slight chuckle in the person's voice and they said that um he retired about three or four years ago he's no longer there now I was stumped and stunned because I never thought he would move anywhere I took for granted that the dentist would be dear even somebody asks does Nurse retire then say retire and I just felt to bring that back to you because I have a title here not taking things for granted Breaking Free from entitlement that is my title this morning not taking things for granted gred Breaking Free from entitlement do not take your salvation for granted do not take your walk with God for granted but make a call in an election show there's a reason why these scriptures are dear it's not by flukes or by chance there's a reason why the scriptures say work out your own salvation with fear and trembling as if you could save yourself but it's not really that there's something deeper than that and we want to take a look at that tonight now brother brandham in a message called presuming and I read this message many times and I never saw this spe presume I got in the dictionary looked up what the word presume actually meant Webster said it means to venture without actual authority to presume anything is to venture without actual Authority that's the part we normally emphasize but then he say or to take for granted so for take for granted is to presume to venture without actual Authority or to take for granted to do something that before you are authorized to do it without the actual authority to do it so we ought not to make false claims we ought not to claim we are this and we are that and we are not really that because God has not confirmed that to be so now brother Bram says Satan is the Great is sopus he has never and and sopus is like an argumentative type person he has never been overcome in Strife of words in Divine service the words of men are usually heard more than the word of God each one Chatters as he pleases or kills Time by learning disquisitions and disproving the views of others of the new birth and how a man must be changed into the likeness of Christ to become Akers of his divine nature second Peter 1:4 scarcely ending is said of the power of the keys the church has almost lost the power of binding only the power of loosen Remains the sacraments given as symbols of unity of love and of our life in Christ have been made the occasion of bitterest conflict because of mutual hatred a center of sectarianism in short Christian has become a labyrinth the Fai have being split into thousand little Parts but only one thing is needful return to Christ looking to Christ as the only leader and walking in his footsteps setting aside all other ways until we reach the goal and have come to the unity of the faith as the heavenly father built everything on the gr of the scriptures so should we leave all part particularities of our special confessions and be satisfied here what we must satisfy with that with the reveal word of God which belong to us all with the Bible in our hand we should cry I believe what God has revealed in this book I will obediently keep his commands I hope for what that he promised Christians give ear there's only one life but death comes to us in a thousand forms there's only one Christ but a thousand Antichrist and this is where but Kelly s testimony and even the title of what he a walk in a new land a report of the new birth and its effect is so relevant and so important this is needful this is needful in 1 Thessalonians 3:13 and if you haven't heard it Go and hear it again if you heard it Go and listen to it again watch in 1 Thessalonians 3:13 it says to the end he may establish your hearts unblamable in Holiness before God watch these words carefully even our father at the coming of Our Lord Jesus Christ with all the saints in the Amplified it says so he may strengthen and confirm and establish your heart faultlessly pure and unblameable in Holiness in the sight of our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ the Messiah with all his Saints to confirm so God will confirm the Holy Ghost to you confirm your experience confirm your breakthrough he's going to confirm it or give approval to it to confirm is to make firmer or to or to make firm or firmer to strengthen to confirm one res Amen to give a new Assurance of validity to remove all doubts Oh Glory to God so therefore you come to a place there's absolutely no doubt so when that man came with the robe that was glowing and telling people bow and bow and bow and thing was they say well let me go on check in Martin bring your robe and come when Martin that rope disappeared that where that rope come from we I can explain that rope but one thing we know St Martin he was a man of God for that hour there and that fals couldn't stand before that word and there's going to be a bride that no falsity going to stand before that [Music] [Applause] bride amen do you believe thatall so we read the scripture wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling an election sure in other words it's not good enough to say I'm a believer I'm in the bride I'm in the eye in the bride and and whatnot and thing like that for if you do these things you shall never fall which things are the virtues how with all diligence in other words you have things that you must apply but a Bram I was crossing on Old Log the other day they some shall overcome don't wash what we call a hollow and I jump up on this lug on the outside look good it looked like a old beach lug but when I jumped on it a great chunk of it fell off it was real rotten and doy I said that is the way Christians are becoming they have been dead now we not talking about unbelievers we're not talking to Sinners we talking about message folks we talking about Christians people go to church when I jump on it a great chunk of it fell off it was real rotten and Doty I said that's the way the Christians have become in they have been dead in sin trespasses so long till they become Dy they can hold no weight at all they don't know what overcoming means they know what going to church means listen to specials mean listen to message songs means they know about all them things but what overcoming is they hold no weight at all they don't know what overcoming means and I begin to think of this text overcome keep life in you not going to church keep life in you it's s inside of here but I'm going to pump what God put upon my heart overcome and keep life in you you don't overcome and church say a church B Bing amen and you have dead half sleepy you're overcoming nothing you're coming to church it's when you leave church is when you have to deal with things when you leave church and you go to your home to your wife to your husband to your family when you leave and go to whatever St station you go to that is where the test come and that is how you can see the test is glorious because it makes you keep Life In You by overcoming what the devil he's supposed to P dce at you he's supposed to spell stuff at you but you don't have to let them stick oh Give the Lord some Praises he is doing his job are you doing yours Hallelujah overcome Le life in you when life went out that's what brought the luck to that condition so it rotten so here he say and it's made worse than ever when it laid in the branch where the water is so the explanation people could sit down in church and rotten away there's no life inside of there so the water of the world don't get them just rotten wood just rotten wood taking up pews and size but br I pray God that tonight if there be some here who doesn't know you never made their peace maybe tonight while we have been speaking a little voice have been speaking on in their heart I feel a warning that I can't be around much longer talk about himself oh God may they put their house in order right now may everything be set May the coldness maybe they are Christians they have lived under this so long and seen so many things have lost the value of it the things to take lightly instead of real deeply and sincerely he say oh God let us check up tonight granted knowing that these things are only warning us of a soon Raptor in church and if we are Laden with sin with unbelief and with fullness that's the killer right there Hallelujah we shall not make the Rapture I don't care who Minister tell you make any Rapture like that he's a liar he said if we are Laden with unbelief and with fullness and with sin we shall not make the Rapture so you must as well prepare for the tribulation period because that way you're on your way to if you want to make the Rapture you have to meet God's requirement Hallelujah we shall not make that rapture we know it Lord so we pray that you will burn into us the Holy Ghost D into our hearts oh God set our souls on fire with your blessing help us to understand Bless the people together bless a pastor and his wife bless the deacons the trustees the lady forgive our sins heal our sicknesses Lord set our hearts a flame and may we go from place with a warning message as we meet people in sin and tell them friend aren't you ashamed that you could do such things knowing that you have to meet God someday Grant it Lord I commit them to you now I commit the message and all together to work together for your glory in Jesus name oh give the Lord some Praises now Paul was the gold standard that the prophet said that he measure every Messenger to Paul was the man that God put as a standard everybody get measured to Paul but Paul himself did not take things for granted and this was such a Trill in studying this for me because I recognize that a lot of things that I see the attitude that people have is not scriptural Paul had a certain mindset here Paul in 1 Corinthians 15:10 but by the grace of God I am what I am and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain but I labored more abundantly than they all yet not I but the grace of God which is within me hallelujah oh give the Lord some Praises this is Prophet Paul this is Apostle Paul this is mindset by the grace of God I am that what I am but I labored more so the grace of God gift you call you anoint you and bless you and you want to sit and steare sit and watch and do absolutely nothing that can't work but that was not the mindset that Paul had Oh Glory to God give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah so let's drill a little bit into Paul's mindset 1 Timothy 1:1 12-4 he said I thank Christ Jesus our lord who has enabled me for that he counted me faithful putting me into the ministry Hallelujah who was before a blasphemer and a persecutor and injurious but I obtained Mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief but the grace of our Lord was exceedingly abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah hallu glory to God hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus think I want to give the Lord some Praises [Applause] man think I want to get a scripture here [Applause] h [Applause] he said therefore this is from Romans 5:18 therefore as by offense of one judgment Came Upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men under justification of life for as by one man's Disobedience many were made Sinners so that The Obedience of one shall made many many righteous moreover the law entered that the offense might abound but when sin abound Grace did much more abound that's exciting scripture when sin B Grace did much more B but in chapter six he said shall we then say what what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that Grace May abound he said God forbid Hallelujah he said God forbid all this Grace talk and Grace talk doesn't mean you get a license to go and sin because Grace when s you deceive that can't workall Hallelujah we have a responsibility to this glorious gospel we have a responsibility to the scriptures we have a responsibility to the [Applause] word so Paul was directly challenging take taking God's grace for granted taking God's grace as if it's a license to do whatever you want to do and it is not it's not a license to live in sin so Paul demonstrated this attitude of humility and gratitude not taking things for granted hope I could get you tonight judges 16:17 after Samson lie and and El Li trying to get he he he's blind to see the devil going to use her he just likeed that chick he liked that girl and everything else his eyes long and lustful but he doesn't see the spirit that going to move behind that so judges 16:17 and this is a good example of somebody who took his gift call and everything for granted watch this he told her all his heart and said unto her there had not come a razor upon my head for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb if I be shaven then my strength will go from me and I will become weak and be like any other man this is a man that was called This is a man that is Anointed this is man who could sing this song I know who I am I don't know this song I am positionally placed you see what see in the message I have revelation of my position in Christ I kill a lion I kill this I do that I'm a champion I'm a warrior yeah that years ago no longer Li me a cat instead of R is meow watch this they had not been a razor come upon my head for I've been a Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb if I be shaven then my strength strength will go for me I'll become weak and be like any other man and when elila saw that he had told her all his heart so she knew she have him she sent and called for the lord of the Philistines that's the person who giv she loot that's who pay she she money saying come up at once for he showed me all his heart then the Lords of the Philistine Came Upon him her and brought money in their hand so she wasn't doing it for free you know she doing for love for loot amen and she made him sleep upon her knees and she called for a man and he caused him to shave off the Seven Locks of his head and she begin to afflict him and his strength went from him now this is the scary part verse 20 and she said the Philistines be upon the Samson now she custom saying that and he break the band and this and that and thing and he woke up of as sleep and said I will go out as other times before and shake myself but here the sad part and he wish not that the Lord was departed from him God hand is off that man a man that killed lion a man that have testimony a man that ripped to Philistine God hand is not off that man and the man don't even recognize it Samson taking things for granted that he lie and God still bless him he lies and he the power was still there but the lie was just an entrance you know to make him do other things he presumed he took for granted he shook himself he said this will be like other times not even knowing the Lord had departed from him listen to how Bon brought this in presuming Samson was a great man he was born a Nazareth unto the Lord Seven Locks here hang on his shoulders he proved by his sign of nazare to the Lord and God was good he run from his parents went down started going with a Philistine woman and that was against the tradition or against Israel to ever fool with a Philistine but there he was going down there God kept on being bearing merciful to him and then she tried to woo him a secret instead of coming right out and telling her not to do such a thing as that he was a Nazarite to the Lord he wouldn't tell it he told her bind my hands and lie to her God forgive his lie watch this is it don't know how I never see this like that God forgive his lie and he broke the bands and on and on like that till finally one time he presumed he could just do anything he wanted and get by witht it but say the devil want to get you to cocaine and you start on cigarettes not cigarette he want you on you know he want to get you on hard drugs so he start you on cigarette Broadway I don't know what have right now long time Broadway start you on some cigarette and then get it to tampy and from tampy something else and then get he said if the devil recognize you could see where heading him you'll keep it right andway ain't touching I ain't touching Tamp I ain't touching no marijuana you're smoking then a spirit jump inside have a smoking demon to feed that spirit Spirit smoking Spirit they have to get it that's the trouble is presume we can do anything and get by with it we are Pentecostal people they say we need message now we believe the prophet you see we can just do anything and get by with it you can't do it you cannot do it Samson said I'll raise and Shake myself just like I've always done when I what when and then when I do it God will be there I just presume he is there but he found out he was gone you know what I believe that the church ought to get back to Holiness again or to get back to the right way of living Samson he taught well I went down there live with this prostitute and everything else and she finally told me to do this and I finally got by with it and all I really told her the truth and here it is all about it was like this I think it'll be all right I presume he is with me and when he got up and shook himself he found out that his power was gone and I think today brother when we look around upon our churches the way they're going it's time to shake ourselves something is wrong we are presuming that we are running all right we are presuming that we are doing fine Church better be straightened up don't let us presume this because we are bigger number than we used to be we are more financial better than we used to be we got better buildings that we used to have we were dress better clothes than we used to have we have better cars than we used to have I wonder about Christ how much he's with us so Samson took his god-given strength and calling for granted don't do that Hallelujah but this supposed to get you people on the toes you know because you're taking nothing for granted hallelujah look at Paul's mindset 1 Corinthians 9 verse 24 Paul speaks know you not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the price so run that he may obtain Hallelujah in other words Paul is telling them don't run stupid don't run foolish run to to get the prize then he want to give his testimony now this is Paul he want to give a testimony brother a punch he says no watch and and every man that striveth for the Mastery that is to be on top of your game it's temperate in all things not some men you callor your belly lead you your lust lead you uh you know whatever your TOS lead you you have to bring that into into subjection that a lazy man that say a in the street that way not going to work he saw a land yesterday and he still think the land coming back again this week so home for the week every man that stri for the Mastery is temperate in all things they do it to obtain a corruptible Crown but we are Incorruptible Hallelujah so Paul give his testimony now I therefore so run hear how I'm running I'm Prophet Paul I'm Apostle Paul but I want you to hear how I am running I therefore so run not as uncertainly so fight I not as one that beat the air but I keep my body and bring it into subjection do you know your body do you understand your body and your appetite what does trigger you I keep my body and bring it into subjection least by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a Cast Away Paul say I'm the man of the and I can never fall I can never fail he's not talking that talk he is taking practicality and saying listen I don't want to be able to preach and after all be a cast away I have to get myself in order oh get the Lord a shout in other words examine yourself to see if you're in the faith not examine the pastor examine you yourself oh give the Lord some Praises not to examine the church examine yourself look in the mirror of the word you have nobody to compare yourself with but the word of God oh give the Lord some [Music] [Applause] praises and the Amplified verse 26 said therefore I do not run uncertainty without definite aim I do not box like one beat in the air and strike with anniversary you need boxing you box you boxing the air you air boxing what matches that the same spirit that you have no music heavy base without a guitar but like a boxer I Buffet my body his body his physical body I handle it roughly and discipline it by hardships and subdue it for fear that after proclaiming to others the gospel and things pertaining to it I myself should become unfit hallelujah hallelujah oh it means people can start off run well and become unfit yes yes over the years we have seen that men come from positive to negative come from God side to the dark side become on fit right before your eyes I myself should become unfit not stand the test be unapproved and rejected a counterfeit oh praise God so this is where we get that scripture now didn't know how to approach it but this is it Philippians 2:12 wherefore my beloved as have always obeyed not as in my presence only but no more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling Hallelujah you have some to work out I can't work that out for you you have to work that [Applause] it come like people gossip and Li and what kind of things so you got to be careful with this kind of people you know because they could drive it want to cuss and you know that is not Holy Ghost you know they not Christian but they almost come to light light you up then to gas you up then to R you up then and you have to hold your peace sometime the best thing is to shut up me a wife had some problem with husband and whatnot and they going to some Cel and man tell her something some gum or something so time he started make just chew and things will go different she started chew and chew and chew so she said what the secret he say all I trying to get you is a shut that's true you talking that's true cuz that mouth is what causing a lot of problem so Paul was trying to get a different mindset from his people one that is not a complacent one one that is not slothful one that is of diligence that would work out stuff that wouldn't sit there and just be buffed by the devil like Devil slapping you up like I know that a then and devil just slapping you up and as he hit you so your head going so your head going so afterward this this this too easy resist the devil he shall that flee song and so poor tonight Galatians 5:13 I know lot of scriptures tonight almost like a Bible teaching for Brethren you have been called unto Liberty only use not Liberty for an occasion of the flesh but by love serve one another a Christian free you know but that don't mean you're going a bar to to show free you are and only order water because you go stumble others you said I thought a church boy I thought she's a church woman and she in other words not the miss use and abuse the freedom that God has given us and that applies to the position of Pastor or the position of every any office whatsoever to not to abuse that because have men that abuse that and abuse the people and bring them in subjection to their Spirit not Christ Spirit their Spirit not the word of God we rebuke that and we reject that we're talking about this here is all of us subject to the spirit of Christ oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah Give the Lord a shout in the [Applause] houseall Paul is the same one that says wherefore let him that think that he standed take he Les he fall why would Paul talk like that I thought we had the bride adoption time we could speak the word when the Press come down what then without all these things here yes we find Prince out there not a carnival B you're jumping and you're chipping and you're going on the road you're going nowhere it have some fine prins that you ought to be inced in tonight Hallelujah not to take things from Grant for granted and free yourself from this entitlement spirit that has seemed to overtaken and possess his message Hallelujah I could tell them they're not going to no Rapture with that thinking and that attitude wheree Paul say let him that think he stand to us he fall what is he questioning people about arrogance overconfidence brother asked me I will brother tell me I'll never backslide and I keep quiet my mouth was sealed so he recognized I wasn't saying anything he said but you could say that I said no I can't say that I say I'm in he palm of his hands and if he move his hands I will fall I can't say that you see he big and high and mighty to say that I a reach there yet he felt as something because he recognized I didn't jump me too do say me too on that that's complicit with that man s don't all know me to you know I going down with that no you can't go there so Paul was reminding the Believers to walk a certain way that's why he said let him that is spiritual restore one that is full with a certain amount of Grace and understanding that you could have fall too not restore one with a hey hey hey like he mov his chair and he come to judge no a way to restore a way to bring back a way to get people reconciled there has to be a way has to be a Christian way a Christ Way a Bible Way oh give the Lord some Praises not the craziness we have seen over the years in this message Hallelujah we going good Romans 11 this is one of the chiefest scriptures for me with Paul in this mindset Romans 11:17 and Paul was describing about Israel being grafted and so like that and here how we bring it if some of the branches be broken off and thou being a wild Olive Tree would grafted among them and and with them partakers of the root and fatness of the Olive Tree boast not against the branches but if thou boast thou bearest not to root but to rooty thou will say then the branches were broken off that I might be grafted in know well because of unbelief they were broken off but thou standest by faith be not high minded but fear oh give the Lord some Praises Oh Glory to God I hope this this shake you this tonight be not highminded but fear for if God spared not the natural branches take heedless he also spare a day oh give the Lord a praise glory to God you think God will not spare the land of the free and the and the brave no the land of free and brave get judged God not going to spare them the judgments already fixed and set if God not the if God spared not the natural branches take heed L he also spare not the behold therefore the goodness the severity of God on them which fell severity but towards the goodness if thou continue in his goodness this scripture is so deep this if thou continue you see people started off good and then the drift my CL we talk about like that's why it was rebuked Return to your first love because that other song service tonight was awesome even going old school was awesome return to First Love why why why because things clut up the heart and you have to guard your heart because the devil trying to show everything to see what will stick in behold therefore the goodness and the severity of God on them that fell severity but towards the goodness if thou continue in his goodness otherwise thou also shall not be cut off amen amen how the message world can appreciate a message like this when they are told they are the bride they are the eye in the bride without the Holy Ghost without the experience of the Holy Ghost they know nothing but the Holy Ghost the ministers throw like bread to them and talking about Holy Ghost without sensation be it done to me according to Thy word and everything else and the people there lacking something the minister knows it it's a lack that is there that's why I have all this competition and no cooperation and that's have all of that because it's a lack of spirit and there was a brother here giv problems and so I talked to him I said listen the Bible talk about the unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace you're not looking to be miserable in the church if you want to take if you want to be miserable go somewhere else are not trying to comfort you in a miserable business I will make you get more so miserable you just run straight out in other words you're breaking the rhythm of the spirit he want to do things a certain way and then when I ask challenge him and it I and he said but I didn't I didn't see it I didn't think about that I said well I'm here for that as a pastor to think about things you don't think about because I'm in a position to see what you cannot [Applause] see there are some people that believe they have technical glasses and they seeing deep so watch this therefore behold therefore the goodness and the severity of God on them which fell severity but towards the goodness if thou continue in his goodness otherwise thou shall also be cut off if Samson tell hey stop that stop that who tell you to ask me that question who tell you ask me where lay my strength CU that's my secret he didn't ask her that he was playing games too so she had to

from his entitlement after he lost his eyes after he grind his Mill after he pay his price and they was dear enough to take that son that servant to bring him for entertainment God hated that God despised that is wanting for the man to be under judgment but it's another thing when you had to bring out that man of God to for entertainment they not no rally there not no Stadium thing no no no you can't do that don't do that and when Samson understood what was going on he began to pray and through them socketless eyes Tears start to come down and he said once more he could only pray once more because he had it before Oh Give the Lord a praise in the house he couldn't pray once more and he never had it and the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost that they have

voice and cried and the people wept that night instead of having a prayer meeting them have a weeping meeting and all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron and the whole Cong them would God that we had died in the land of Egypt oh would God we had died in this Wilderness imagine that they get out of pharaoh they get out the licks and bondage and these people say we should have dead in the wilderness we should have die in Egypt verse three and wherefore had the Lord brought us into this land to Fall by the sword our wives our children should be pray were not better for

happened and the glory of the Lord appeared in the Tabernacle of of the congregation before all the children of Israel so after all the mouth Champions spread the rumors and the talk Pillar of Fire Glory come down and settle over there man had to shut up you know because man put that there man sto that there man didn't light that up there the glory of God hallelujah oh give the Lord some praises and the Lord said unto Moses how long will this people provoke me how long will it be he they believe me for all the signs which I have shown among them I will Smite them with pestilence and disinherit them I will make of these a greater nation and mighy than they that the same God who love everybody and Moses said unto the Lord then the Egyptians shall hear it for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land for they have heard that thou Lord art among this people and thou Lord art seen face to face and that thy Cloud standeth over them and that thou goest before them by day and a pillar of cloud and a pillar of Fire by night now if thou shallal kill all these people as one man then the Nations will have heard the fame of thee will speak saying because the Lord was not able to bring his people into the the land which he sway unto them therefore he had slain him in the wilderness so Moses was like a lawyer there he bringing a case to God because of what the neighbor is going to talk about hallelujah hallelujah now I beseech thee let the power of thy my Lord be great according to thou has been spoken saying hallelujah hallelujah the Lord is longsuffering of great Mercy forgiven iniquity and transgression by no means clearing the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children upon the turn four generation Hallelujah pardon I bese Thee Moses begging the iniquity of this people according unto thy greatness of thy mercy that thou Hast forgiven this people from Egypt until now and the Lord said I have pardoned according to Thy word he didn't finish there know but as truly as I live all the Earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord because all those men which have seen my glory and my Miracles which I did in Egypt and the Wilderness and have tempted me now these 10 times and have not haed my voice surely they have they shall not see the land which I swear to their fathers NE shall neither shall any of them that provoke me see it but my servant Caleb because he had another spirit with him and had followed me fully him will I bring into the land where on he went and his seed shall possess It Go say yeah forgive them I pardon them but they see none of the land they have 40 Years of willingness to go tell them die out oh my Hallelujah let me see I can finish WRA up here maybe maybe this is a message I should have preached on a Sunday morning but this this is what has been right in me about taking things for granted I'll skip I'll skip some stuff hallu but I'm talking about preachers they presume they're doing right when they preach their Doctrine they presume that that's that's just what God requires a certain Creed a certain affiliation had to join to us you had to connect to us and here have it and um what um we had the seed is a shock all kind of foolishness no Vindication no confirmation man son of my Ministry and all he son a woman I'm and know it's like a it's like a exciting thing to say Apostle I know who the Apostle attraction now who who's Apostle and Prophet long time when you talk about Prophet you tell people go a prophet a false prophet no every other Tom Dick Harry and he neighbor is a prophet and they're saying it to you know Prophet this Prophet that Prophet that and 99.99% of them false Jesus said many false rise and I I to be honest I didn't know was so many but Jesus can't lie you know it's true you know many you know I mean almost every one of them false for I I stop I stop thinking I will hold on to this true Prophet here this is Mal prophet there's only one Creed in the Bible That's Christ to know him is to have life outside of that there's no way to have life outside of knowing Christ by personal experience with him not joining a church of Rec a Creed so somebody leave here because they like brother go next church that person leave here but who they are and how they are nothing has changed but say we go to a funeral home we feel sorry for the person that is dead that doesn't change nothing but a dwelling place sometime we think we want to think of the best we can for them that's right but Jesus said except a man be born again he will no wise enter in there's no halfway line you presume he went to heaven but according to the word he didn't do it that's plain every fun go to people going it had a funeral the man had to come and look somebody come up and look you want know the wrong funeral because what they saying about that man in the box and what they know of that man is two different things you know so the person he was in wrong funeral you some sometime they see dead people make p lie oh Isaac wouldn't say lie say misrepresent the truth you know sometime I had to go with that the misrepresent TRU be the pulpit because they want to make it look good but the man is a rang stinking sinner that missed the portals of Heaven man he way to hell because nobody never witnessed to that man oh my but I'm say you presume he went to heaven but Accord to do he didn't do it you just presume that he was well he was a good church member he done good for the Neighbors that's fine but nothing to say against that part but do you realize what kept people out of the promised land they were borderline Believers it wasn't unbelievers you know it was people in Moses message that had books and tapes and press and playah the way men and women today they go so far in God they will say yes I believe but but when it comes to surrender everything to Christ your life and all where that line lays and that's what makes people say well I look at the rest of them and here you are older Christians to the younger the younger woman look at the older women younger men looking at the older men and see the way you conduct yourself and see what you do and they presume it's all right because you do it the way you do Israel had those experiences Israel mus come please had come out of Egypt Israel had seen signs and miracles and wonders all along the road they had passed through the Red Sea on dry ground they were Witnesses of the blessings of God upon their life and went and but then they failed to disobey one of God's command what happened the blessing cut off from them and they presume that because God has been so good he just go on to be good but God can't do that and I don't think this has wred homers yet because years now I've I've preached for years about Kang will know that judgment has not struck this message yet amen it's almost it's almost as if it's the longsuffering of God but Ste is the longsuffering of God has extended mercy and grace to the life of this message and thing like that skip it here it is when we warn spiritual gifts in the church if we want the power of God the real power of God now I tell you brother sister it's so easy for someone to be deceived on that sensation but you see our church is not moving on the way it should it should move we know there's something wrong we know then then God will not be with us until we get whatever it is straightened out so it's time to check up and see the things that we should do and that what the things we should do and get ready and go ahead oh praise the name of the Lord glory to God so some so he said he said the boat that Mo that Noah had to build that Noah had to build had to be a holy ghost constructed boat it Happ had to be boat with the design of God he said a Cyprus boat material make Cyprus boat a popular material make popular boat he said a worldly material make a worldly Church a holy ghost material made a Holy Ghost Church what is this Holy Ghost Church brother Brandon what does it do how does it act the Holy Ghost is the power of God that is sent you into the heart as a witness of the spirit you are born again and your life is cleaned up Moses take for Egypt but he failed until he met him in a burning birth when he met him in a burnish birth all he talk was over oh blessed be the name of the Lord we must keep the word of God don't presume nothing just don't take it for granted don't venture out when you don't have the authority to do so just stay and wait if it is 10 days 20 days 10 years whatever it is until you are dead positive Oh Glory to God you want to know in whom you have believed Oh Glory to God hallelujah then then that life will straighten up isn't that right and the church I often wondered he said I'm closing before I die walk into a church sometime and walk through there and just see how sin couldn't even set in that church any member would have to confess it before they got there the holy spirit will call it right out on the spot like that see women sitting there looking like ladies see men like men Real Men of Integrity Holy Ghost filled men oh praise God so what you have to do tonight examine yourself whether you be in the Fate he said 2 Corinthians uh 13:5 examine yourselves whether you be the fith prove your own selves know you not your own selves how Jesus Christ is in you except you be reprobate Hallelujah the a scripture I love hey 5-7 I'm going to close now therefore th say the Lord of hosts consider your ways you are sown much and bringing little you eat but you have not enough you drink and you are not filled with drink he clothe you but there's none warm he do earn it wages earn

God we have communion coming up this coming Sunday 1 Corinthians 11:20 say let a man exam examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup oh my Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord thank you Jesus I'm going to begin to play something [Music] see when the prophet Nan came to David and give him a story and David said that man should be killed and the prophet said to the

anointed loved of God but he fell and he failed but he called upon God and God Mercy extent to him it had rupture in his family there's a price and cost of Disobedience there's a price and cost of
