[16:32] and we are trusting god uh for what he
[16:35] has planned for us
[16:36] it's it's really a tremendous blessing
[16:38] to see everybody out
[16:40] i know that some people uh had some
[16:42] trouble getting the link
[16:43] um so feel free to send it
[16:47] uh to anybody who you know you may not
[16:50] be seeing in the room tonight
[16:51] um for adventure they did not get it uh
[16:55] looking for a wonderful time around the
[16:57] word of god the word of god is food
[16:59] so we actually come in tonight um you
[17:02] know they say social distancing you know
[17:04] gala to to eat in restaurants and these
[17:06] things but we could come tonight and
[17:08] eat around this this food this food
[17:11] tonight
[17:12] that the the the social distancing rules
[17:15] don't apply
[17:16] we could come together and eat and eat
[17:18] your fill
[17:19] you know eat and and see your life
[17:21] change eat them get a smile on your face
[17:23] eaten
[17:24] and get a change in perspective a
[17:26] paradigm shift
[17:27] uh another look another another look
[17:30] like like elijah told us
[17:32] again you know the first look wasn't the
[17:34] real look you know when he went and
[17:35] looked again and again and he looked
[17:36] seven times
[17:38] then he saw that small sign that
[17:40] represented the change
[17:42] of season you know so uh we thank god
[17:46] for his grace we thank god that as we
[17:48] come to the closing
[17:50] uh chapters of or pages rather of 2020
[17:54] just in about three weeks or so we close
[17:57] this year
[17:58] that has been a year of years you know i
[18:01] heard somebody say it was
[18:03] this year was like 20 years packed
[18:04] together so much happened in sequence
[18:06] it's like
[18:07] you know it it is that kind of a season
[18:10] that we're living in you know but we
[18:11] thank god for the unfolding of his word
[18:13] we thank god for
[18:15] you know the the ministry that we have
[18:17] been blessed to be under we thank god
[18:19] for
[18:19] how he has kept us and he has has
[18:22] allowed us through this season to do
[18:25] what we have
[18:26] never done before you know um you know
[18:28] had it not been
[18:29] um for this time we would not have even
[18:31] had these bible studies in this kind of
[18:33] a way
[18:34] um but god allowed you know all of this
[18:37] you know to bring
[18:38] changes in not just our lives and
[18:41] changes
[18:42] in church changes in the world the way
[18:44] the world operates the way things
[18:46] happen the way business happens the way
[18:49] you know
[18:50] how you drive and what you buy and
[18:52] what's available
[18:54] you know the way you do business
[18:55] everything is is changing you know
[18:57] and it would be you know remiss of us to
[19:00] to to consider going back to how it used
[19:04] to be
[19:04] you know i see that being an
[19:06] impossibility you know
[19:09] it is as if a chicken has broken out of
[19:11] the egg
[19:12] you know you can't put the pieces of the
[19:14] shell back together and try to fit the
[19:16] chicken back in it
[19:17] you know the wool as we uh used to know
[19:20] it
[19:20] uh you know is no longer exists you know
[19:23] and and it's this type of a situation
[19:24] where
[19:25] you either adapt or you die you either
[19:28] change or you die you know funny enough
[19:31] and
[19:32] and you have to forgive me you know in
[19:34] these bible studies these conversations
[19:36] it gives us some liberty you know to
[19:39] share and to to talk a little bit so i'm
[19:40] just going to
[19:41] kind of chat a little bit before i get
[19:43] to the teaching tonight you know
[19:45] and i was going to say that you know
[19:46] rewind a year ago
[19:48] there are many people who didn't even
[19:50] know what zoom was
[19:53] remind rewind a year ago there are
[19:56] certain technologies and way of doing
[19:58] you know education schooling you know
[20:01] now you have young children muting and
[20:02] unmuting and and and and putting up
[20:05] their hands in
[20:06] zoom classes and and they like because
[20:09] they have been forced to adapt
[20:11] the the the learning curve you know so
[20:14] you know looking at even within you know
[20:17] trinidad and tobago and many countries
[20:19] where e-commerce was not
[20:20] was not you know as active as in the u.s
[20:23] or europe
[20:24] you know you have seen this spike in
[20:26] online transactions and
[20:28] and a lot of ways of doing things that a
[20:30] year ago
[20:31] would not have been the case but that
[20:33] that is the world that we're living in
[20:35] and it's a world of change you know and
[20:38] we realize that as we look at
[20:40] spiritual history look at church history
[20:44] change has been a constant and
[20:47] god has also been a constant you know he
[20:50] said i am the lord and i change not so
[20:52] he is the constant but yet still around
[20:55] that constant is another constant call
[20:57] change
[20:58] you know so we went through the car age
[21:00] we went through the
[21:01] horse and buggy and then the car age and
[21:03] then we we went through the airplane and
[21:05] now we're in the age of the astronauts
[21:06] and now
[21:07] there's so many other dimensions of what
[21:09] is unfolding to us
[21:10] and it and and it now requires more and
[21:14] i want this to resonate with us tonight
[21:16] the expectations are higher in every
[21:20] facet of your life
[21:21] what you have to be conscious of is
[21:24] higher than ever before
[21:26] i look back to when the pandemic started
[21:28] and
[21:29] you know when it first started it was
[21:31] almost like you have to remember your
[21:32] mask you need to be conscious of these
[21:34] things and
[21:35] and and it was a a process of
[21:38] of having to remember these steps to do
[21:40] certain things you know when
[21:42] when you first heard that you know
[21:43] they're going to check your temperature
[21:45] and they do these things
[21:46] at first in in the first hearing of it
[21:48] it sounded like this
[21:50] rigorous process but now after months
[21:53] and months and months
[21:55] it has become normal we have become
[21:58] accustomed to it
[22:00] and and rewind a year ago if you told us
[22:03] that you had to do all of these steps to
[22:04] enter a building
[22:05] we would have said all of that you have
[22:07] to do all of that just to go into the
[22:09] grocery
[22:09] you have to do all of that to go and do
[22:12] to go in the bank you have to do all of
[22:13] that to do this
[22:14] and and just all of a sudden the
[22:16] expectation
[22:17] or if i could say the requirement to do
[22:20] normal living is higher than it was last
[22:22] year
[22:23] and in the same way in the spiritual
[22:26] application of it
[22:28] the expectation that god has for us is
[22:30] also higher
[22:31] and we cannot go back to the standard we
[22:34] were
[22:35] before that the wrong god higher than so
[22:38] i want to
[22:39] encourage us tonight in this vein a
[22:41] little bit and to challenge us
[22:43] uh there's something that is in me about
[22:45] challenging
[22:46] myself challenging individuals um
[22:49] challenging us
[22:50] to do better you know i was i
[22:53] i i have this if i call it a uh
[22:56] i want to be careful and use any word
[22:58] habit or i would rather say a discipline
[23:00] to listen to audiobooks i love listening
[23:02] to audiobooks
[23:03] because i find that it is there's a lot
[23:06] of time
[23:07] that you could waste you know and
[23:08] sometimes you're driving and there's a
[23:10] lot that that you could accomplish while
[23:12] driving and what
[23:13] what i try to do while driving is
[23:14] listening to audiobooks you know and
[23:17] i was listening to to our audiobook
[23:21] and it was speaking about change and
[23:23] these things and about
[23:24] challenging and about and there was a
[23:26] word that the author used about
[23:27] transformation
[23:29] you know when i started whenever i hear
[23:30] something i look at the spiritual side
[23:32] of it as well
[23:33] because the bible say be transformed by
[23:35] the renewing or the rebooting
[23:38] of your mind you know and this thing
[23:40] about transformation really struck me
[23:42] because at the end of the day our
[23:45] encounter with the lord
[23:47] not church not doctrine not belief our
[23:50] encounter with the lord is to bring a
[23:52] change
[23:54] a change in behavior a change in
[23:56] attitude a
[23:57] change in language a change in how we
[24:01] do everything we do that proves that we
[24:03] have had this experience
[24:05] so the bible will say like they took
[24:07] note that they had been with jesus it
[24:08] wasn't
[24:09] the words that they used but it was
[24:11] their behavior
[24:12] you know and i've seen after a while
[24:15] having gone through this
[24:16] you know that's why brother brown is
[24:18] about getting seasoned out experiences
[24:20] come
[24:20] to take certain things away from us
[24:22] experiences come
[24:24] to help us deal with different
[24:25] situations experiences come
[24:27] to do all these things you know so
[24:30] that's my little
[24:30] kind of introduction tonight i don't
[24:32] intend to be too long
[24:34] with us tonight uh just a little
[24:36] inspiration that i had and i told about
[24:38] over i wanted to kind of
[24:39] do a little teach you know have a
[24:40] conversation around this
[24:42] um it is somewhat different in the sense
[24:45] that
[24:46] and during this whole bible study
[24:48] experience we find
[24:49] things that people may not normally
[24:51] focus on but i want to call this
[24:53] teaching tonight planning for 2021
[24:57] planning for 2021
[25:01] that's the teaching tonight and i want
[25:04] to start off with a quote
[25:06] from the prophet whereby the brahman
[25:08] said in the message hear he him
[25:11] now jesus when he was here on earth he
[25:14] didn't just go
[25:15] about all haphazardly
[25:19] haphazardly means you're just doing
[25:21] anything
[25:22] you're you're you're you're you're here
[25:24] you're there you you know why you're
[25:26] here you don't know why you're there
[25:27] he said jesus didn't do anything
[25:29] haphazardly
[25:31] so you know when we say we want to be
[25:32] like jesus
[25:34] many of us underestimate the magnitude
[25:38] of that statement
[25:40] after this service after this teaching
[25:42] tonight i want you to rethink that song
[25:44] to be like jesus
[25:46] because if you really because there are
[25:49] aspects of jesus that people easily want
[25:51] to be like you know
[25:53] so so there's the kind jesus they're
[25:56] aspects of the ministry of jesus that
[25:57] people can easily connect with
[25:59] but when you look at the there are other
[26:01] aspects of god
[26:03] and other access of jesus's ministry
[26:05] that are
[26:06] quite a tall order that requires the
[26:08] best of us
[26:10] it requires effort and many of us
[26:13] don't realize how much effort it takes
[26:15] that's why i say we underestimate
[26:16] so he didn't just go about all
[26:18] haphazardly
[26:20] which means that he was intentional it's
[26:22] a word that i use a lot now cause
[26:24] intentional meaning
[26:25] he had an intent or he was very
[26:27] deliberate
[26:28] he wasn't doing it by accident he he he
[26:31] didn't go down the road because he felt
[26:33] going on the road ish to use how about
[26:35] over and say he if you're drivish
[26:37] so he went by drive no if he went
[26:39] somewhere he was going for a specific
[26:41] purpose
[26:42] to meet a specific person to do a
[26:44] certain thing
[26:45] so he always had a plan i want to make
[26:47] the point he always had
[26:49] a plan all right i want to continue on
[26:51] the quote
[26:52] he had one thing to do that was the will
[26:54] of god who sent him
[26:56] now that's powerful because if brother
[26:58] branham is saying here that
[26:59] jesus had one thing to do it meant all
[27:02] of his cumulative actions
[27:04] the totality of all that he did was
[27:07] wrapped up in that one thing
[27:09] it meant every action was part of that
[27:12] one thing
[27:13] and i want us to as we look into 2021
[27:16] because we're going somewhere tonight
[27:18] what is the thing that we are supposed
[27:20] to be doing and that thing can have
[27:22] different dimensions
[27:23] because there's a spiritual thing that
[27:25] we have to do there are also natural
[27:27] things that we have to do
[27:28] but it's wrapped up in the purpose the
[27:31] purpose singular
[27:32] purpose of god for all of us so he said
[27:34] he had one thing to do
[27:36] that was the will of god who sent him
[27:39] and everywhere he went
[27:41] i want us to wear this now and
[27:44] everybody if i ask a question tonight
[27:46] who wants to be like jesus
[27:48] i don't think there's anybody in this
[27:50] room because if they don't want to be
[27:51] like jesus this is the wrong room
[27:54] but if you want to be like jesus let me
[27:56] talk about attributes of the jesus that
[27:58] we want to be like
[27:59] and everywhere he went everywhere
[28:02] not somewheres everywhere he went
[28:05] everything he'd done
[28:07] had a meaning had a purpose i'm reading
[28:10] the prophet
[28:11] had a plan a for-ordained plan of god
[28:15] everything he did
[28:18] and if we be children of god our life
[28:21] is in the hands of god who orders
[28:25] our footsteps and the footsteps of the
[28:28] righteous
[28:28] is ordered of the lord jesus never went
[28:32] places or listen carefully or did things
[28:34] unless it had a meaning
[28:37] and many times you talk to young people
[28:39] and you encourage people and
[28:40] and you realize that 99 of the problems
[28:43] people find themselves in
[28:45] in general but now i'm bringing it
[28:47] specific to believers
[28:48] is because they have gone to a place or
[28:51] they did a thing
[28:52] that really had no meaning in the
[28:54] context of your purpose
[28:57] anybody with me tonight i get them today
[29:01] no this is just a
[29:02] this is the phone this is the appetizer
[29:03] you know we're here to eat tonight is
[29:04] the appetizer
[29:05] i want a lady foundation from the
[29:07] prophet so you know where i'm coming
[29:09] from
[29:09] because i'm gonna run through some
[29:11] scriptures tonight
[29:12] to to let us look at planning i want to
[29:15] look at planning
[29:16] and the whole concept of planning and
[29:18] the fact that you cannot
[29:19] you cannot approach 2021 without a plan
[29:23] that is where i'm going with this you
[29:25] have to have a plan for your marriage
[29:27] you have to have a plan for your
[29:28] business you have to have a plan in your
[29:31] job
[29:31] you have to have a plan for your career
[29:33] you have to have a plan for your prayer
[29:35] life
[29:35] you have to have a plan for your
[29:37] approach to god
[29:38] you have a plan for saving but abraham
[29:41] said you don't know when he's coming
[29:42] so plan as if you come in next 20 years
[29:44] but live i see you coming tomorrow
[29:46] anybody with me tonight
[29:47] so you have to have a plan you want to
[29:50] get healthy for 2021
[29:52] we are we are believers so planning is
[29:55] part of the dna attribute of god that we
[29:58] want to tap into tonight you want to get
[30:00] healthy you have to have a plan you
[30:01] can't tell me you want to get healthy
[30:03] and you're going to do the same thing
[30:04] you're doing all along then you don't
[30:05] have a plan
[30:06] all i can ask you that thing you want to
[30:08] achieve
[30:09] what is the plan to get it anybody with
[30:12] me
[30:14] what is the plan you want to reconcile
[30:17] your family
[30:17] do you have a plan to do so you want to
[30:19] save to buy a
[30:22] expand what is your plan how will you
[30:24] move
[30:25] from where you are now to where you want
[30:27] to be in god
[30:29] how are you going to move how much how
[30:31] are you going to not be volume on your
[30:33] prayer life anybody with me tonight
[30:35] what does he plan to turn up i get an
[30:37] excited no you have to forgive me
[30:38] the food start to eat good already how
[30:40] are you going to turn up the volume
[30:42] on your prayer life what is the plan
[30:45] what will you
[30:45] push aside come on now to be able to fit
[30:48] this thing in that is more important
[30:50] because it's
[30:51] part of the plan that's tied to your
[30:53] purpose
[30:54] you want to talk to your family more
[30:56] whether they're in church or not in
[30:57] church or you
[30:58] but but what is your plan because
[31:00] watching tv
[31:01] can be part of the plan any oh
[31:04] hello anybody any you know these these
[31:07] cameras kind of
[31:08] offended yeah i hope i hope only there
[31:10] you know
[31:13] everybody there you know all right so so
[31:17] because i challenge and i've shared this
[31:18] before
[31:20] you cannot this world the way the world
[31:23] is now
[31:24] it was easy in the 40s and 50s i'm
[31:27] thinking
[31:27] you see the amount of distractions that
[31:30] we have now
[31:31] if you don't have a plan to fit
[31:34] everything in a day
[31:35] because they want you to to look january
[31:38] they're going to open school virtually
[31:39] so some children in school some children
[31:42] home and zoomed some people doing this
[31:44] some people do in that some people do in
[31:45] the other all kind of different things
[31:47] right
[31:47] you have to know that that that that
[31:50] that you have a plan
[31:52] to be able to navigate how you're gonna
[31:55] get into work
[31:56] who doing this if you just sit down you
[31:58] cannot scream
[31:59] you cannot get a nervous breakdown
[32:01] because that is not your promise anybody
[32:03] with me tonight
[32:04] and you can handle the pressure anybody
[32:08] with me tonight
[32:09] all right all right all right all right
[32:11] so let's start to go into some
[32:13] scriptures
[32:14] i believe my last uh teaching we were
[32:17] we were kind of dealing with proverbs so
[32:19] i'm still going to be pulling some stuff
[32:21] in proverbs because the wisdom of this a
[32:23] lot of it comes from proverbs and
[32:25] and we're going to go through some of it
[32:26] so we're going to start um
[32:28] from in proverbs 21 verse 5. we're not
[32:31] reading
[32:32] necessarily a story or extensive passage
[32:34] might be just going to
[32:35] hit certain verses and if you're taking
[32:38] notes
[32:39] and i encourage you as a discipline
[32:42] yes it'll be on tape but i want to
[32:45] encourage you you see the act of
[32:46] writing there's actually huge studies
[32:49] done
[32:50] with very successful people have a
[32:52] certain thing in common
[32:54] they have a discipline of writing this
[32:57] is not writing on a phone
[32:59] or writing on a computer this is the
[33:01] discipline because the hand-eye
[33:03] coordination
[33:04] it takes to write something
[33:06] long-form-writing
[33:07] creates a strong connection with your
[33:09] mind with your heart
[33:11] with your eyes with memory all right so
[33:13] a little word of encouragement in there
[33:15] right
[33:16] but proverbs 21
[33:22] 5.
[33:25] so we're gonna let's get some scriptures
[33:27] i'm planning right
[33:28] the thoughts of the diligent tend
[33:31] only to plenteousness but of
[33:34] everyone that is hasty only to want
[33:38] all right so i want to read that now
[33:40] when you amplify so we see it here
[33:42] so the plans
[33:46] this is the amplified of the same verse
[33:48] we just read proverbs 21
[33:49] 5 the plans of the diligent
[33:52] lead surely to abundance and advantage
[33:56] so if you want to get ahead if you want
[33:59] to have an advantage
[34:00] you have to have a plan but everyone who
[34:02] acts in haste
[34:04] comes surely to poverty so
[34:07] the wisdom of solomon is saying when you
[34:10] just make a decision and yeah consider
[34:12] it carefully
[34:12] his head is head into poverty but the
[34:15] man who sits down
[34:16] and plans has a diligent plan
[34:20] that is diligent about his plan will
[34:23] surely lead to abundance
[34:24] all right so we're going to move through
[34:26] quickly i'm not going to take up too
[34:27] much time because
[34:28] the real homework tonight is not so much
[34:31] a teacher you know it's after the
[34:32] teaching
[34:33] how you're starting to go to ride on
[34:34] certain things and and you begin to work
[34:36] on your plan that is your your homework
[34:38] tonight
[34:39] so it is one thing to understand that
[34:42] planning will give you an advantage
[34:44] you have to be able to answer you know
[34:46] many times people say going to do this
[34:48] and and ask the question how
[34:51] how are you going to do it because if
[34:54] you don't have a hole
[34:55] it's not going to happen success is not
[34:58] accidental
[35:00] spiritual success natural success
[35:02] success is not accidental
[35:04] especially no especially no you have to
[35:07] be systematic
[35:08] you have to be deliberate you have to be
[35:10] methodological you have to be that way
[35:13] so moving on to proverbs 16 and verse 3.
[35:19] proverbs 16 and verse 3.
[35:23] the bible says commit thy works unto the
[35:26] lord
[35:27] and thy thoughts shall be established
[35:32] commit thy works to the lord
[35:35] commit works unto the lord and thy
[35:38] thoughts
[35:38] shall be established that word thoughts
[35:41] there
[35:42] is really plans all right so in the
[35:45] amplified it says it like this
[35:47] commit your works to the lord and it
[35:49] says submit and trust them to him
[35:51] and your plans will succeed if you
[35:54] respond
[35:55] to his will and guidance so i'm not just
[35:59] saying you're having a plan
[36:00] and and you just planning in a vacuum so
[36:02] you're ignoring everything else and
[36:03] you're just doing what you want to do no
[36:06] now that you understand that that you
[36:08] have to plan and as a christian you're
[36:10] supposed to plan you can't just
[36:11] live your life haphazardly because
[36:13] that's not how jesus operated
[36:15] everything he did was planned everything
[36:17] he did was meditating everything he did
[36:19] was fitting into a context of his
[36:21] destiny
[36:22] all right so because of who you are
[36:24] because of where you're going there are
[36:26] certain places
[36:27] that could no longer be on your gps your
[36:29] certain places
[36:30] can't be in your directory it's certain
[36:32] four numbers you cannot have
[36:34] because that is not leading you closer
[36:36] to where you need to be
[36:37] so now you're planning to do the thing
[36:39] that will bring you to your spiritual
[36:41] destination
[36:42] to your destination that you need for
[36:43] your family for your destination that
[36:45] you need to
[36:46] whatever are the goals and plans that
[36:48] you have that are in alignment with god
[36:49] anybody with me
[36:50] tonight so we have established
[36:54] two points that planning gives you an
[36:57] advantage
[36:58] that's the first point we established
[37:00] that was the proverbs 21 5.
[37:03] we are now talking that you have to now
[37:05] submit your plan
[37:07] because we all now are going into more
[37:09] planning
[37:10] we're planning a slot and i've said it
[37:12] before if you don't have a plan
[37:13] of when you pray when the day comes
[37:16] you're not gonna find it it's not gonna
[37:17] just appear
[37:20] you have to create that space to read
[37:22] your word
[37:24] that is planning you have to create a
[37:25] space to pray that is planning
[37:28] and you want to submit your plan to the
[37:29] lord that's proverbs 16
[37:31] 3. and now let's begin to expand this a
[37:34] bit
[37:36] many people and i'm fortunate to to be
[37:40] one that
[37:40] people come to and say what you think
[37:42] about this i want to do something like
[37:44] this i want to achieve something like
[37:45] this
[37:47] the bible says 15
[37:50] 22 without counsel
[37:54] purposes are disappointed
[37:57] but in the multitude of counselors they
[38:01] are
[38:01] established i want to read that one more
[38:03] time without
[38:05] counsel purposes are disappointed
[38:08] but in the multitude of counselors they
[38:11] are
[38:12] established in other words when you
[38:15] don't get advice
[38:18] your plans will be disappointed
[38:22] and when you have multiple people who
[38:26] you can go and bounce
[38:27] ideas from people who are different
[38:30] types of experts
[38:31] who have different type of experiences
[38:34] who have had their own failures and
[38:35] their successes
[38:36] and now you can now because you're
[38:38] working with the lord is the ultimate
[38:39] personal proof in your planner
[38:42] but you're taking your time because you
[38:43] want to consider
[38:45] what you have not considered you want to
[38:47] see what you have not seen
[38:49] and one of the ways to do that is to go
[38:51] to people who have been down that road
[38:52] before
[38:54] so in the amplified it says without
[38:56] consultation
[38:58] and wise advice plans are frustrated
[39:02] but with many counselors they are
[39:04] established and succeed
[39:05] you know how many people have seen try
[39:07] to do things on their own and feel
[39:12] they went without talking to anybody
[39:16] they went get no advice and the
[39:19] sad thing is there were people around
[39:21] them who
[39:22] had gone on that road before
[39:27] so it's a biblical principle to seek
[39:30] counsel
[39:30] to seek advice and to get counselors
[39:34] around you
[39:35] people around you who are sound who have
[39:38] experience
[39:39] who have walked the road why would you
[39:41] try to do it alone
[39:42] if there are people in your family and
[39:44] i'm talking about even your church
[39:46] family
[39:48] it could be your natural family i'm not
[39:50] limiting that
[39:51] but you want to get counsel because you
[39:53] want to make sure
[39:54] i want to see what i haven't seen yet
[39:57] because you are not an island
[40:01] this world that we live in you can't say
[40:03] well i'm the only person and i'm the
[40:05] best and i don't need any help
[40:08] so god put it there in scripture that
[40:10] you need to talk to people
[40:14] you need to be able to be humble enough
[40:16] to say i'm not sure
[40:18] how to take this road is there somebody
[40:20] who has been here before that can guide
[40:22] me
[40:22] on how to buy this house or should i buy
[40:24] this car you think i gone buy a used car
[40:26] gesso
[40:31] if i meet him and say i used to say but
[40:33] now i've taken it and i open the bonnet
[40:35] and i look at it and i i do i don't even
[40:38] know how to start
[40:40] to figure out if this thing would buy
[40:41] another i would be a fool
[40:44] to go and just see a car and just say
[40:46] well i'm buying it
[40:48] you check the engine no you check the
[40:49] transmission no you check it
[40:51] no so however by it
[40:55] i have a degree your degree
[40:58] in whatever subject unless your degree
[41:00] in car
[41:02] you need to get somebody who is an
[41:04] expert
[41:07] now now look how some people
[41:11] get messed up so
[41:16] there are people who like to be lone
[41:17] rangers
[41:19] so your loan range is because you just
[41:21] have an anti-social spirit
[41:22] oh this is not social licensing this is
[41:25] anti-social spirit
[41:26] so you don't want to talk to people you
[41:28] don't want to tell you what to do
[41:30] you don't want to appear vulnerable the
[41:32] scriptures such as iron
[41:34] sharpen iron confess your first one to
[41:36] another those scriptures are not yours
[41:38] because you just don't want to talk to
[41:39] nobody
[41:42] and sometimes you go praying to the lord
[41:46] to show you what to do and god looking
[41:48] at you
[41:49] and looking at proverbs 15 22 and saying
[41:52] but
[41:52] all those people i put around you who
[41:55] have done these things
[41:56] i put them around you for a purpose
[42:00] so they could go in your car and drive
[42:02] and look at the car you have to buy
[42:03] i want to make it practical
[42:07] because i want us to understand that god
[42:09] put us in this room it's not by accident
[42:12] it's a plan we are we are walking and
[42:13] are planning on
[42:16] being in this room tonight is part of a
[42:17] plan
[42:19] i didn't make the plan we are walking in
[42:21] the plan
[42:22] and we have to learn to lean on each
[42:25] other
[42:26] because if you look at the church in the
[42:27] book of acts that church operated
[42:30] as a strong family anybody with me
[42:35] can we go on so we talk now and i'm kind
[42:38] of structuring the
[42:40] teaching so we talk about planning gives
[42:42] you an advantage
[42:43] proverbs 21 5. we talk about submitting
[42:46] your plan to the lord
[42:47] proverbs 16 3. we talk about seeking
[42:50] counsel when planning
[42:52] so you know you have an advantage you're
[42:54] bringing your plan to your lord
[42:55] you're making sure and get counsel you
[42:57] want to get somebody else
[42:59] to look this thing over to see if it
[43:01] making sense
[43:02] this coronavirus yeah 2020
[43:05] has disrupted jobs businesses and quite
[43:08] honestly i will tell you from an
[43:09] economic perspective
[43:11] the real ripple effects economically
[43:13] have not hit yet
[43:15] which means by next year there will be
[43:18] ripple effects still
[43:19] so you have a lot of people saying i can
[43:21] open up business i want to do this i got
[43:23] to do this
[43:23] well if it is listen you know many
[43:26] people have the desire to do things if
[43:28] desire alone is what will take to make
[43:30] it then everybody finally know
[43:32] it's not just the desire there has to be
[43:34] a systematic approach
[43:36] and if you could get a better way if you
[43:38] could get a better approach
[43:40] wouldn't you one that way so we say get
[43:42] counsel when
[43:43] planning now we want to talk about
[43:46] including the lord in your plans and
[43:49] this is where i see a lot of young
[43:50] people
[43:51] they they they we say they ramajit
[43:53] itself i'm going to do this
[43:55] i'm going to do that i go and conquer
[43:57] the world and listen i know that i
[43:59] i i went to that myself as a i'm not as
[44:01] young as
[44:02] i used to be but i know how it is when
[44:04] you feel you have it all figured out
[44:07] all right so let's go to the book of
[44:09] james in the new testament
[44:12] to see how james was starting to deal
[44:15] with this situation and
[44:19] and it's really enlightening when you
[44:20] look at it in the amplified
[44:23] to kind of zoom in on the impact of it
[44:25] right
[44:28] james 4 verse 13
[44:31] james 4 verse 13. i hope this has been a
[44:33] blessing to you it's not
[44:34] our normal teaching but but but we're
[44:36] getting ready for 2021 we kind of deny
[44:39] that this year has been a googly a curve
[44:42] ball unexpected so so what is your
[44:45] response in the spiritual in the natural
[44:47] to this year in preparing for 2021
[44:50] and beyond by the grace of god all right
[44:52] so james 4 verse 13
[44:55] go to now ye that say today or tomorrow
[44:59] we will go into such a city and continue
[45:03] there a year
[45:04] and buy and sell and get gain
[45:08] so so so james is addressing an economic
[45:11] situation
[45:14] this is not a spiritual situation all
[45:16] right
[45:17] and one of the challenges in the message
[45:20] is that people have not been able to
[45:21] confront the issues of economics
[45:23] and decision making the reality is we
[45:25] all have to work we will have to live we
[45:27] all have to eat
[45:28] so this is context in application here
[45:31] now verse 14
[45:33] whereas you know not what shall be
[45:36] on the moral for what is your life
[45:41] it is even a vapor that appeared for a
[45:44] little time
[45:45] and then vanish it away for that you
[45:48] ought to say if the lord will we shall
[45:51] live and do this or do that
[45:53] so a lot of times you know many of us we
[45:56] grow up hearing
[45:57] say lord willing or tomorrow lord
[45:59] willing and we grew up using that freeze
[46:02] this is where it comes from this is the
[46:05] context of placement
[46:06] with james showing them that with all
[46:09] you're doing with all your planning with
[46:10] all your activity
[46:12] make sure you getting that continual
[46:15] approval from the lord by including the
[46:17] lord in even your statements
[46:19] not want to challenge you you know in in
[46:21] recent times
[46:22] you know and and i don't know how it is
[46:24] with you with with business
[46:26] communication and stuff like that
[46:28] but i've started a discipline now you
[46:31] know
[46:31] you're doing an email for work or
[46:33] something and somebody says well uh
[46:36] can you get this to me tomorrow you know
[46:39] or something you send me a proposal and
[46:41] i would and
[46:42] you know i i found myself wondering how
[46:44] should i phrase this
[46:46] because i'm saying i'm going to send you
[46:48] the proposal to you on thursday
[46:50] i said i say you know what i'm going to
[46:52] make it i'm not going to back down from
[46:54] putting it so thursday lord willing so i
[46:55] put it in the email
[46:57] it doesn't matter who i'm writing to it
[46:59] doesn't matter what your message is
[47:01] because this is james in action because
[47:03] you don't know what tomorrow is
[47:05] you don't know what tuesday is and james
[47:07] was teaching them
[47:08] all right so i want to read it in the
[47:09] amplified so we can this could resonate
[47:12] with us
[47:12] because anytime you tell somebody i will
[47:14] see you tomorrow you know
[47:16] this is what james is talking about here
[47:19] all right so listen to the amplified of
[47:21] this same james
[47:23] 4 13 to 15. we're not going to be too
[47:27] long
[47:27] but listen to this in the amplified come
[47:29] now and pay attention to this
[47:32] i'm reading amplified you who say today
[47:36] or tomorrow we will go to such and such
[47:39] a city
[47:40] and spend a year there and carry on our
[47:43] business and make a profit
[47:46] this can apply to anything you're doing
[47:47] right yet you do not know the least
[47:50] thing
[47:51] about what may happen in your life
[47:53] tomorrow
[47:55] what is secure in your life
[47:58] you are merely a vapor like a puff of
[48:01] smoke or a wisp of steam from a cooking
[48:04] pot
[48:05] that is visible for a little while and
[48:07] then vanishes into thin
[48:09] air instead you ought to see
[48:12] if the lord wills we will live and we
[48:15] will do this
[48:16] or that so we are building and i'm
[48:19] and i'm building it systematically here
[48:22] by the grace of god
[48:24] planning gives you an advantage proverbs
[48:26] 21 5.
[48:27] you have to submit your plan to the lord
[48:29] proverbs 16 3.
[48:30] you have to seek consul when planning
[48:33] proverbs 15 22
[48:34] you need to include the lord in your
[48:37] plans
[48:37] which is james 4 13 to 15
[48:41] and if the lord wills whatever you have
[48:43] to do that's how we do it
[48:45] now let's move to jesus himself teaching
[48:48] on planning you know jesus thought on
[48:51] planning himself
[48:55] i hope after this you say wait a minute
[48:58] i need a plan and i need a plan for
[49:00] tomorrow
[49:04] the rest of this year we're talking
[49:07] about planning for 20 21
[49:09] i need a plan for christmas in the plan
[49:12] for the rest of this year all right
[49:13] so listen to jesus teaching and planning
[49:16] in luke's in luke 14
[49:19] verse 28.
[49:22] listen to jesus verse 28. for which of
[49:24] you
[49:25] intending to build a tower sit it
[49:29] not down first and counted the cost
[49:33] whether he have sufficient to finish it
[49:37] so jesus is making a point that here
[49:40] well
[49:41] they're supposed to be normal which of
[49:43] you intending to build a tower
[49:46] don't sit down first and come the cost
[49:50] to see if you have enough to finish it
[49:53] all you ever see unfinished buildings in
[49:55] trinidad
[49:56] host air finish government billing and
[49:58] finish
[49:59] corporate billing and finish three
[50:01] stories four series up
[50:03] and dressed up for years and he said you
[50:06] know if they just built one story they
[50:07] could actually finish
[50:09] it meant that somebody didn't sit down
[50:11] and properly count the course
[50:13] to see if they could finish right verse
[50:16] 29
[50:18] less happily after he had laid the
[50:20] foundation
[50:21] and is not able to finish it all that
[50:24] behold it begin to mock him
[50:26] this is jesus saying this is the
[50:30] consequence
[50:31] of you not planning and not realizing
[50:35] what you need to put in place to achieve
[50:38] a certain something
[50:40] verse 30 saying this is what i'm mocking
[50:43] him this man began to build
[50:45] and was not able to finish
[50:51] anybody with me to tonight
[50:54] verse 31 or what king
[50:57] speaking to leadership now going this is
[51:00] jesus teaching her
[51:01] or what king going to make war
[51:05] against another king sit not down first
[51:09] and consulted whether he be able
[51:12] with ten thousand to meet him that
[51:14] comment against him
[51:16] with twenty thousand or else
[51:19] while the other is yet a great way off
[51:22] he send it and ambassador
[51:25] and desired conditions of peace
[51:31] so jesus is saying after he assessed if
[51:34] he could win the war or not
[51:35] he will decide if he have enough men or
[51:38] he need to send somebody to
[51:40] negotiate but that doesn't happen unless
[51:43] there's an attempt to plan
[51:44] because you want victory or you want a
[51:46] positive outcome
[51:48] listen to how jesus uses this now in the
[51:51] life of the believer
[51:52] verse 33 so likewise
[51:55] whosoever he be of you that forsaketh
[51:59] not all that he had
[52:01] he cannot be my disciple
[52:04] so jesus put forsaking as part of
[52:07] planning
[52:10] i don't know if anybody caught that
[52:15] he actually tied the act of forsaking
[52:18] because he said you have to know what
[52:19] you need to forsake
[52:22] and to plan you need to take inventory
[52:25] to planning to know what you have to
[52:27] planning to know what you want to
[52:29] achieve
[52:30] and you have to know what you need to
[52:32] let go to achieve it it's like budgeting
[52:34] you want to save you cannot have a plan
[52:36] to save and keep spending the same way
[52:38] you've been spending all the time you're
[52:40] not going to achieve it
[52:41] so you have to forsake something you
[52:43] have to cut back on one box at kfc you
[52:45] have to cut back on
[52:46] on whatever it is because you want to
[52:48] achieve a thing
[52:49] so what are you willing to forsake going
[52:52] into 2021
[52:54] to be able to achieve it
[52:58] anybody with me tonight i want to read
[53:01] it from the amplified because i really
[53:03] want to nail it down
[53:04] for those who have never studied this
[53:06] out this is the
[53:08] preliminary conversation on planning
[53:10] luke 14
[53:11] 28 for which of you when he wants to
[53:13] build a watchtower for his guards
[53:15] as he amplified does not first sit down
[53:18] and calculate the cost
[53:20] to see if he has enough to finish it
[53:23] otherwise when he has laid a foundation
[53:25] and is unable to finish the building all
[53:28] who see it
[53:30] will begin to ridicule him
[53:33] saying this man began to build and was
[53:35] not able to finish
[53:37] or what king when he sets out to meet
[53:40] another king in battle
[53:42] will not first sit down and consider
[53:44] whether he is strong enough
[53:46] with ten thousand men to encounter the
[53:48] one who is coming against him with
[53:50] twenty thousand
[53:52] or else if he feels he is not powerful
[53:55] enough while the other king is still
[53:57] a far distance away he sends an envoy
[54:01] and asks for terms of peace so
[54:04] then listen to the context as a believer
[54:06] now where planning comes in
[54:08] none of you can be my disciples who
[54:12] does not carefully consider the cost
[54:16] and then for my sake give up all his own
[54:22] possessions isn't that powerful
[54:25] that's jesus teaching them so let's
[54:28] build now so i've taken a note in
[54:33] teaching style here so planning gives
[54:35] you an advantage
[54:36] you have to submit your plan unto the
[54:38] lord you have to seek counsel when
[54:40] planning
[54:40] you have to include the lords in your
[54:42] plan
[54:44] we now we introduce jesus foundational
[54:46] teaching on planning
[54:47] in luke 14. and now we're going to say
[54:50] now that planning
[54:51] alone is not enough
[54:55] because a lot of people have good plans
[54:56] and there's no action behind the plan
[54:59] you have plans sitting on there it's
[55:00] like your plans for a house you have any
[55:02] plans but if you start a bill
[55:03] that just will always mean a plan you
[55:06] have a nice house plan it's a beautiful
[55:08] house planner i would stick up on your
[55:09] wall
[55:10] you just get up in the evening and look
[55:11] at it that's great fantastic you have
[55:13] the plan but when anyone start to build
[55:15] all right so listen to proverbs 20
[55:18] verse 5 counsel in the heart
[55:22] of man is like deep water
[55:25] but a man of understanding will draw it
[55:29] out
[55:30] i'll read it one more time counsel
[55:33] in the heart of man is like deep water
[55:37] but a man of understanding will draw it
[55:39] out let me read it
[55:40] in the amplified same scripture
[55:44] a plan that's how it starts so that that
[55:47] council is a plan motive or wise counsel
[55:51] in the heart of a man is like water in a
[55:54] deep well
[55:55] so it's like what in a deep well so the
[55:57] same architectural drawing or the plan
[56:00] for your house
[56:01] it's like what in a deep well you can't
[56:03] access it
[56:05] you can't enjoy it but a man of
[56:09] understanding
[56:09] draws it out that that's why draws it
[56:12] out
[56:13] so a man of understanding will take it
[56:16] from water in the well
[56:17] to water in the cup a man of
[56:19] understanding
[56:20] will move it from being a drawing into a
[56:23] house he could walk into
[56:25] and remember in our teaching on proverbs
[56:28] talk about wisdom
[56:29] knowledge understanding and it's why i
[56:32] said
[56:33] the way we operated in 2019 2018 2017
[56:37] 20 years ago cannot be what is required
[56:40] for 2021
[56:41] we have to become people of wisdom
[56:44] people of knowledge
[56:45] people of understanding because the
[56:47] bible is saying you know a man
[56:49] of understanding he understands what is
[56:51] required
[56:52] to turn it from plan into manifestation
[56:56] to turn it from water in the well to
[56:58] water in the cup
[56:59] because if it's stainless well how good
[57:00] is it in the well i have a plan
[57:03] you no longer planning to save you no
[57:04] longer planning to save and
[57:06] you're not taking no action towards the
[57:09] planning to to be healthier are planning
[57:11] to stop drinking soft drink are planning
[57:13] to and you're always planning a planning
[57:15] to pray
[57:16] a planning to read the bible a planet
[57:18] and it always wanted you well
[57:21] so a plan in the heart of a man is like
[57:23] water in a deep well
[57:25] i want us to move beyond having it in
[57:28] your heart
[57:28] and it becoming a living reality i plan
[57:31] to worship more well stop planning now
[57:33] and worship now
[57:34] because it's been a good plan let's
[57:36] worship a plan to exercise more feet
[57:40] we spoke about in in our teaching about
[57:42] not complaining
[57:43] so move it from the plant and not
[57:45] complain and not complaining
[57:47] just stop it moving from water in the
[57:50] well to water in the cup
[57:52] i hope this resonates now huh anybody
[57:55] with me tonight is this is this helping
[57:56] anybody
[57:57] to reframe their thinking about being
[58:00] more intentional and
[58:01] and well life happened to me how how
[58:03] what do you mean life happened to you
[58:05] what time you woke up in the morning
[58:07] what was your plan to wake up in the
[58:08] morning
[58:09] well whatever time awake that could be
[58:10] that that does sound
[58:12] jesus though whatever time i wake up is
[58:14] well that doesn't sound like like what
[58:16] we're looking at here
[58:17] tonight what are you doing this week
[58:20] well whatever happened yes whatever
[58:22] happened
[58:24] you have a plan to what you do every
[58:26] monday so so
[58:27] so how you could how you could miss
[58:29] church if you would have a plan how you
[58:30] could
[58:31] so you you you didn't put on your
[58:32] schedule to be in bible study tonight
[58:36] hallelujah you don't have on your
[58:38] calendar
[58:39] wednesday night service me you got you
[58:42] ca you can't tell me your plan to be in
[58:44] wednesday night live stream
[58:45] and you miss it because even on your
[58:47] plan you can miss it anybody with me
[58:49] tonight
[58:50] it means your prayer meeting on friday
[58:52] night how do you party a plan
[58:55] anybody with me tonight you're going to
[58:57] your job
[58:59] why are you recently to work you didn't
[59:01] have you didn't plan you didn't think in
[59:02] advance what you
[59:03] required to be able to put what in place
[59:06] had to be put in place to make it to
[59:07] work on time
[59:09] for you to succeed in your job you don't
[59:11] know what is required for you to succeed
[59:13] in your job
[59:14] if you know what is required what have
[59:16] you put in place to be able to
[59:18] be to be the best at it
[59:21] we are being challenged as disciples
[59:24] we are being challenged to be best in
[59:26] class
[59:27] because jesus was best in class in the
[59:30] early stages of his ministry they
[59:31] referred to him as master
[59:34] and that master was not rulership that
[59:36] master was differentiating
[59:39] master to apprentice they were seeing
[59:41] the elements of mastery when you say
[59:43] beethoven is a master and shakespeare
[59:46] was a master of literature
[59:48] they saw attributes around jesus that
[59:50] spoke of mastery
[59:53] what are you a master of what is it that
[59:56] you do that when people look at you they
[59:57] say
[59:58] it has to be the hand of the lord upon
[1:00:00] you or are you just comfortable to be
[1:00:01] average
[1:00:04] anybody with me tonight i'm challenging

[1:00:14] do today what they're gonna do today on
[1:00:15] the first day let there be
[1:00:17] second day let there be third day let
[1:00:19] there be first
[1:00:20] age i want paul second age irenaeus all

[1:00:34] me tonight you know
[1:00:38] let's let's let's jump a little bit i
[1:00:40] want to bring out something here
[1:00:42] i see a lot of young people uh talk
[1:00:44] about the the proverbs 31 woman
[1:00:47] a lot of lots of proverbs 31 do you have
[1:00:50] any proverbs 31 sisters
[1:00:52] in the house tonight i know they're
[1:00:54] hiding me any cameras anything but but
[1:00:55] it's a great thing to aspire
[1:00:57] to be a proverbs 31 woman a virtuous who
[1:01:01] can find a
[1:01:01] virtuous woman right
[1:01:04] so let us look at at one of the
[1:01:06] attributes of a virtuous woman the
[1:01:08] proverbs 31 woman
[1:01:10] because all through that you're seeing
[1:01:12] well i'll just pull us
[1:01:13] about about planning all right so
[1:01:15] proverbs 31 verse 14
[1:01:17] she is like the merchant ship she bring
[1:01:20] it food from afar
[1:01:23] that is not running by the shop around
[1:01:24] the corner
[1:01:26] you don't just bring food from afar by
[1:01:29] accident
[1:01:30] to bring food from afar you have to put
[1:01:32] things in place to bring food from afar
[1:01:34] one theologian postulated that bringing
[1:01:36] food from afar
[1:01:38] were meant putting things in place
[1:01:40] because they knew the kind of quality
[1:01:41] food they wanted to have lord help me
[1:01:45] verse 15 she rise it also while it is
[1:01:48] yet night
[1:01:49] that is not whatever time i wake up
[1:01:51] she'll rise it also while it is yet
[1:01:53] night and give it meat to her household
[1:01:56] you don't do that without a plan an
[1:01:58] apportion to her maidens
[1:02:00] verse 16 she consider it a field this is
[1:02:03] ca what are we talking about
[1:02:06] and buy it it with the fruit of our hand
[1:02:09] she planted a vineyard
[1:02:11] you can't do all of that when he did
[1:02:13] come without a plan
[1:02:15] let me read it in the amplified she is
[1:02:18] like
[1:02:19] the merchant ships abounding with
[1:02:21] treasure this proverbs 31
[1:02:22] woman she brings her household food from
[1:02:25] afar
[1:02:27] she rises also while it is still night
[1:02:30] and gives food to her household and
[1:02:33] assigns
[1:02:34] tasks to her needs you cannot assign
[1:02:37] tasks if you don't know what tasks are

[1:03:17] you say what god wants you to see you go
[1:03:19] where god wants you to go you seek god
[1:03:21] before you move
[1:03:23] last verse verse 16 she considers a
[1:03:26] field
[1:03:27] listen to the amplified level 16 she
[1:03:29] considers her field
[1:03:30] before she buys or accepts it expanding
[1:03:34] her business prudently that's the
[1:03:36] amplified version
[1:03:38] with her profits she plans fruitful
[1:03:41] vines in her vineyard
[1:03:44] this is the same woman who woke up early
[1:03:45] morning to provide food and give out

[1:04:12] interested in we pay attention
[1:04:15] you have people here who are following
[1:04:16] the u.s election when i tell you they
[1:04:18] could tell me every state
[1:04:19] they could tell me who was singing who
[1:04:21] count to t
[1:04:22] because they they like that
[1:04:25] so the internet they know their their
[1:04:28] forecasting
[1:04:29] from right the engineer they forecasted
[1:04:32] if cnn called them they telling them the
[1:04:33] answer before
[1:04:34] because they like that but ask them
[1:04:37] other things they don't know because
[1:04:38] that's not interesting to them
[1:04:40] you have to know what is important for
[1:04:43] you
[1:04:44] what you need to do to achieve your
[1:04:46] purpose and i want to talk about details
[1:04:48] and listen to the scripture
[1:04:51] proverbs 27 23
[1:04:54] and look look at this instruction and
[1:04:56] this applies and this is this is
[1:04:57] this is christian living there friends
[1:05:00] people are true they tell me loosely i'm
[1:05:02] a believer i'm a christian
[1:05:04] line up to this one verse 23 proverbs 27
[1:05:07] verse 23 be thou diligent to know the
[1:05:10] state of thy flocks
[1:05:12] and look well to thy hoods in other
[1:05:14] words useless evil to tell me
[1:05:16] how much flocks you have
[1:05:20] how much trees you have in your garden
[1:05:22] how much how much how much cows you have
[1:05:24] that apply to business you have cars on
[1:05:25] your road you have this you have that
[1:05:27] you have
[1:05:27] what is your inventory
[1:05:31] well i had some tools um
[1:05:34] at a lan one i did borrow one
[1:05:37] and not let me go and check
[1:05:40] does that sound like this scripture
[1:05:43] be thou diligent to know the state of
[1:05:46] thy flocks and look well to thy hoods
[1:05:49] so this is this is not a question this
[1:05:52] is not a suggestion this is an
[1:05:54] instruction you know
[1:05:55] and this is applying to your job to your
[1:05:57] business to your life
[1:06:00] be diligent to know the state of thy
[1:06:03] flock in other words
[1:06:04] mind your business
[1:06:07] take care of your business know the
[1:06:10] state of your affairs
[1:06:12] understand what's going on take an
[1:06:14] inventory tonight
[1:06:16] what needs to clean out what needs to
[1:06:18] put in what you have what you need to
[1:06:19] put in place what you need to do
[1:06:24] this what we're doing tonight is is is
[1:06:26] the key to joshua's success was what
[1:06:28] meditation on your word day or night all
[1:06:30] this is weird in them
[1:06:35] you know mystery and you can reach the
[1:06:36] word you carry the church on time
[1:06:38] because you can't put a plan in place to
[1:06:39] reach a church on time but you have a
[1:06:41] mystery
[1:06:44] all these dots have to connect in your
[1:06:45] life you know
[1:06:50] it all has to make sense the word is not
[1:06:53] just disconnected
[1:06:54] because the word that would have
[1:06:56] appeared disconnected through the ages
[1:06:57] was wrapped up in this man called jesus
[1:06:59] oh help me tonight
[1:07:01] so what would have seemed to be
[1:07:03] fractured and a little he and a little
[1:07:05] there could have been wrapped up in
[1:07:06] jesus
[1:07:07] and truly prophetic ministry of brother
[1:07:08] branham is now tied up there's no loose
[1:07:11] ends
[1:07:13] so the book is open tonight we have to
[1:07:15] be diligent
[1:07:16] to know the state of what is happening
[1:07:17] with your family do you know
[1:07:21] well let's bring it home now what is
[1:07:22] happening in your house
[1:07:25] be thou diligent to know the state of
[1:07:27] thy flocks
[1:07:28] look where to thy hood your family is
[1:07:31] your business
[1:07:33] jesus said i must be about my father's
[1:07:35] business
[1:07:36] so the business is not just for money
[1:07:38] business it's about god's business
[1:07:42] can you give an inventory of your prayer
[1:07:43] life are you diligent about the state of
[1:07:45] a prayer life
[1:07:47] anybody with me
[1:07:51] let's just finish that scripture so we
[1:07:52] see the context of it verse 24
[1:07:55] for riches and not forever and dot the
[1:07:57] crown endure to every generation
[1:08:01] so solomon is saying if you don't watch
[1:08:03] out for your stuff you're going to fall
[1:08:04] apart
[1:08:07] verse 25 the here appear it and the
[1:08:09] tender grass through itself
[1:08:10] and he heard that the monkeys are
[1:08:12] gathered the lambs are for thy clothing
[1:08:14] and the goats are the price of the field
[1:08:16] do you say all these things matter
[1:08:18] everything
[1:08:19] matters
[1:08:23] and thou shall have goats milk enough
[1:08:25] for thy food and for the food of thy
[1:08:27] household
[1:08:28] and for the maintenance of their
[1:08:29] millions this outcome
[1:08:31] of verse 27 is a product of what
[1:08:33] happened in verse 23
[1:08:35] being diligent to know the state of thy
[1:08:37] flocks
[1:08:39] you're trying to save but you're not
[1:08:41] tracking you're saving
[1:08:45] anybody with me tonight i'm not going to
[1:08:47] be too much longer almost almost
[1:08:48] wrapping up
[1:08:50] so we have gone through a little journey
[1:08:54] planning gives us an advantage we want
[1:08:57] to submit our plans here lord
[1:08:58] we want to seek counsel when planning we
[1:09:00] want to include the lord in our plans
[1:09:02] we went through jesus teaching on
[1:09:04] planning and now we talk about planning
[1:09:06] alone is not enough
[1:09:08] the council in the heart of a man is
[1:09:10] like deep water but amount of
[1:09:11] understanding will draw it out
[1:09:13] so you have to understand what is
[1:09:14] required to draw it out
[1:09:16] you want to start a business you have to
[1:09:18] understand the business you're going to
[1:09:19] study kind of start it
[1:09:20] it you know just start you have to
[1:09:22] understand it to draw it out to bring it
[1:09:24] into fruition
[1:09:25] we went to the proverbs 31 woman and
[1:09:28] look at the attributes of her
[1:09:29] that spoke to the planet because god is
[1:09:31] showing the same way he planned your
[1:09:34] life and predestinated certain things he
[1:09:36] laying this message of planning from
[1:09:38] genesis or revelation
[1:09:39] and showing it in there's so many
[1:09:41] scriptures i can't take it all tonight
[1:09:43] but to show how important this thing is
[1:09:45] we talk about planning pay attention to
[1:09:47] the details
[1:09:48] god took care of the details with the
[1:09:50] house you were born into
[1:09:52] the country you were born into the
[1:09:54] journey you had to take
[1:09:55] this school that you went to the person
[1:09:57] you had to meet to even come to this
[1:09:59] message
[1:09:59] because you didn't find the message the
[1:10:01] message found you
[1:10:02] and that has been pre-planned or
[1:10:05] predestinated
[1:10:06] or pre or for ordained to take place you
[1:10:08] know how much planning it takes
[1:10:10] or help us tonight to put all of us here
[1:10:12] tonight in the same room
[1:10:15] hallelujah you know what's planning it
[1:10:17] takes to make it happen
[1:10:18] that we can be here tonight hearing this
[1:10:20] gospel it's a lot of planning
[1:10:22] that we could be here tonight and you
[1:10:24] don't want to take a little effort to
[1:10:26] put a plan for your children
[1:10:27] a plan for your savings a plan for your
[1:10:29] marriage a plan for your prayer life a
[1:10:31] plan to really word
[1:10:32] a plan to be more diligent a plan to add
[1:10:34] a skill
[1:10:36] i challenge the church months ago in
[1:10:38] this pandemic
[1:10:39] to use your time wisely in the lockdown
[1:10:43] there are people who do in lockdown
[1:10:44] wasted their time
[1:10:47] and their people who apply themselves
[1:10:51] anybody with me tonight
[1:10:56] trying to get to the home stretch here

[1:11:00] powerful scripture and i have the
[1:11:03] headline here

[1:11:07] line up
[1:11:07] with his plans jeremiah 29 verse 11

[1:11:19] think toward you say the lord
[1:11:21] thoughts of peace or plans of peace are
[1:11:23] not of evil

[1:11:27] words he is planning
[1:11:28] towards an end and that end is not
[1:11:31] finished that end is outcome
[1:11:32] or result so i'm planning for a result
[1:11:36] i'm planning for an outcome i want to
[1:11:38] see you in a certain place so i'm
[1:11:40] putting things in place for that
[1:11:41] verse 12 this is jeremiah 29
[1:11:45] verse 12 then shall he call upon me and
[1:11:47] he shall go and pray unto me and i will
[1:11:50] hearken unto you and he shall seek me
[1:11:52] and find me
[1:11:53] when you shall search for me with all
[1:11:54] your heart
[1:11:56] it has to be part of your plan your
[1:11:57] desire you put things in place

[1:12:15] you will come and pray to me
[1:12:17] and i will hear your voice and i will
[1:12:19] listen to you
[1:12:20] then with a deep longing my lord
[1:12:23] a deep longing you will seek me and
[1:12:26] require me
[1:12:27] as a vital necessity you will
[1:12:30] find me when you search for me with all
[1:12:33] of your heart
[1:12:34] can we get the lord a hand of praise
[1:12:35] tonight
[1:12:38] hallelujah so we're building tonight
[1:12:41] we're heading to the home stretch
[1:12:42] we're coming in fast last round here we
[1:12:44] we're in the last lap here
[1:12:46] of this race tonight god's counsel will
[1:12:50] stand
[1:12:52] proverbs 19 21 there are many devices in
[1:12:55] a man's heart
[1:12:57] nevertheless the council of the lord
[1:12:59] that shall
[1:13:00] stand in the amplified many plans
[1:13:04] are in a man's heart but there's a
[1:13:05] lord's purpose for him
[1:13:07] that will stand or be carried out oh
[1:13:09] that is so powerful tonight
[1:13:11] so powerful to know that that you are
[1:13:14] trying to put things in place
[1:13:15] you want to do right but above that
[1:13:17] there's god making sure
[1:13:19] all things work together for good to
[1:13:21] them who love god who are called
[1:13:22] according to his purpose
[1:13:24] because at the end of the day it is the
[1:13:26] lord's purpose that will stand
[1:13:32] hit in the hopes right now ephesians
[1:13:34] familiar scripture
[1:13:36] ephesians 1 5 having predestinated us
[1:13:41] that predestinated us is planning unto
[1:13:44] the adoption of children
[1:13:46] by jesus christ to himself according to
[1:13:49] the good pleasure
[1:13:50] of his will have you ever read that any
[1:13:53] amplified
[1:13:55] ephesians 1 verse 5 in the amplified he
[1:13:58] predestined
[1:14:00] and lovingly planned
[1:14:03] for us to be adopted to himself
[1:14:06] as his own children through jesus christ
[1:14:10] in accordance with the kind intention
[1:14:14] and good pleasure of his will oh let me
[1:14:17] read that one more time
[1:14:18] he predestined and i love this and
[1:14:20] lovingly planned
[1:14:23] you mean this whole plan of adoption is
[1:14:25] a plan is really a plan
[1:14:27] he predestined and lovingly planned for
[1:14:30] us to be adopted to himself
[1:14:32] as his own children through jesus christ
[1:14:35] in accordance with the kind intention
[1:14:38] and good pleasure of his will
[1:14:42] i'm getting ready to close out i told
[1:14:44] her tonight i'm not was not going to be
[1:14:45] long
[1:14:46] and that i think i stick into the plan
[1:14:52] so i want to close over this quote
[1:14:54] tonight the oneness of unity
[1:14:58] but abraham said now god has a plan and
[1:15:00] the devil has a plan
[1:15:02] you see that there if you needed a
[1:15:04] motivation
[1:15:05] to get your into your planning that is
[1:15:07] it there because not only is god
[1:15:09] planning but he devil planning to you
[1:15:10] know he definitely not sitting now why
[1:15:12] are we having this meeting he's planning
[1:15:13] no no
[1:15:14] how do i go on trip this person up
[1:15:15] tomorrow boy how i go and get you so
[1:15:17] frustrated
[1:15:18] that by the time the service has to
[1:15:20] stream at 8 pm tomorrow night
[1:15:22] you'll be out of the spirit it will take
[1:15:23] you a whole hour to get in the spirit
[1:15:26] that what he planning right now
[1:15:29] i talk about over today i had such a
[1:15:31] rough day today
[1:15:34] a beer a barely making
[1:15:40] i call him twice twice i call him
[1:15:44] i said bro you ready
[1:15:47] [Laughter]
[1:15:51] and in in a simple way
[1:15:54] i told my wife look how easily just pass
[1:15:57] it back to me twice
[1:15:58] i tried to i tried to but i tried to i
[1:16:00] tried to brother
[1:16:01] o'brien i tried to bod the ball i'm
[1:16:04] brought over
[1:16:11] and you have to know because listen you
[1:16:12] will have these when when you don't feel
[1:16:14] like and
[1:16:14] and when i look back on a rewindy day
[1:16:17] and i say you know what
[1:16:19] because we live in the natural world you
[1:16:22] have bills to pay you have things to do
[1:16:23] you have things
[1:16:24] i said wait a minute wait a minute this
[1:16:26] whole day is really connected to this
[1:16:27] year for me you know
[1:16:31] the whole flow of my day i could look
[1:16:33] now and say the whole flow of my day to
[1:16:35] day was connected to this here
[1:16:39] because the devil didn't want this
[1:16:44] so he they're trying to to to
[1:16:48] to throw things off make sure you yeah
[1:16:50] yeah you think are they trying to put
[1:16:51] air in
[1:16:52] my tire this happened that happened they
[1:16:54] think they think and
[1:16:55] all can my team are philly of you they
[1:16:57] confabulated that's not a word
[1:16:59] but they could write it down they
[1:17:00] confobulated
[1:17:02] and you feel like who else had done
[1:17:04] attire finish
[1:17:09] that is when you know the purpose of god
[1:17:11] stands
[1:17:13] hallelujah because some of you
[1:17:16] you try your best to do what you could
[1:17:17] and you thank god for the purpose of god
[1:17:19] that could give you strength to keep
[1:17:20] fighting
[1:17:22] and then when they come in and get you
[1:17:23] recharged and your battery gets charged
[1:17:25] and and your feelings you often
[1:17:26] come nearby and get you quicker and you
[1:17:28] feel the anointing you say wait a minute
[1:17:30] but this devil is a real liar yes
[1:17:35] but brother stephen cinema what's up the
[1:17:37] other day he said
[1:17:38] this satan is a wicked man that's what i
[1:17:41] said
[1:17:42] is a wicked man
[1:17:46] so god has a plan reading it here and
[1:17:48] the devil has a plan
[1:17:50] and then the devil listen to the prophet
[1:17:52] is trying to get all people under his
[1:17:54] plan
[1:17:56] while god is trying to get people to be
[1:17:59] one under his plan
[1:18:02] so we talk about influence and there are
[1:18:04] only two influences but ibraheem now say
[1:18:06] there's influences and there's plans
[1:18:10] because the influence has to tempt our
[1:18:12] plan because the devil
[1:18:13] has a plan to try to pull you away from
[1:18:14] god with all kinds of different things
[1:18:17] and
[1:18:17] some of it could seem innocent it will
[1:18:19] all be negative things
[1:18:20] it's just to take your time to take your
[1:18:22] interest to take your energy
[1:18:24] so you don't have time and energy and
[1:18:26] interest for god
[1:18:27] and god is is pulling your attention
[1:18:29] tonight and saying listen
[1:18:31] plan to lock him out close the windows
[1:18:34] put a plan to close windows
[1:18:35] put a plan to close the doors put a plan
[1:18:38] to shut things down
[1:18:39] to make sure that god has access all the
[1:18:41] time
[1:18:43] god should need a password into your
[1:18:45] life come on now
[1:18:47] the password is not for him you have to
[1:18:48] give him permission put the password to
[1:18:51] lock the devil out
[1:18:52] anybody with me tonight so there's two
[1:18:55] great spirits in the world
[1:18:57] one of them is the devil the other is
[1:18:58] god the devil has messengers god has
[1:19:00] messengers
[1:19:01] and we are at liberty to make our choice
[1:19:04] to whom we will yield ourselves to
[1:19:06] and that's whose servants we are so i
[1:19:08] want to encourage you church
[1:19:10] in closing tonight we have
[1:19:13] to face the unknown on the one hand
[1:19:17] and we are also facing the known on the
[1:19:19] other hand
[1:19:20] because what we do know is that god has
[1:19:22] already put things in place
[1:19:24] for us to be adopted for us to be
[1:19:26] perfected for the holy ghost to paul
[1:19:28] that is in place we are walking in that
[1:19:30] land anybody with me
[1:19:33] that is what the beauty of
[1:19:34] predestination is what branham said he
[1:19:36] put the
[1:19:36] engagement ring of predestination
[1:19:44] so that part we know and we are
[1:19:46] fulfilling that we are living that out
[1:19:48] whether we feel like it we don't feel
[1:19:50] like it
[1:19:50] we have a good day we have a bad day we
[1:19:53] have a destination in god
[1:19:55] at the same time we have to be able to
[1:19:57] bridge in this world where we have
[1:19:59] choices
[1:20:01] what time to cook what time to go to the
[1:20:03] grocery what time to do this
[1:20:04] how to live what what what what to study
[1:20:07] in school and all these things
[1:20:09] and and the same way god is planning on
[1:20:12] a grand scale how this whole world will
[1:20:15] come to an end
[1:20:16] and all these pieces that will come to
[1:20:17] place you have to take responsibility
[1:20:20] you have to take ownership for your
[1:20:23] decisions for your actions
[1:20:24] for your words and how
[1:20:28] you will do what you need to do because
[1:20:30] there are things that god will do
[1:20:32] and the thing that you have to do
[1:20:36] come to it say amen so i want to
[1:20:39] challenge you
[1:20:40] begin to put things in place by the
[1:20:42] grace of god to plan for your 2021.
[1:20:46] can we just borrow heads or word of
[1:20:47] prayer or gracious heavenly father a
[1:20:49] little teaching tonight to
[1:20:51] encourage your people to challenge your
[1:20:54] people to
[1:20:55] push your people lord i'm speaking not
[1:20:57] just to them but to me also
[1:21:00] lord to be able to give an account
[1:21:03] to be able to relook at the approach to
[1:21:05] every day
[1:21:07] what you do how you say things what you
[1:21:10] achieve
[1:21:11] what you intend to do what you have to
[1:21:12] put in place and we read that powerful
[1:21:15] scripture
[1:21:16] lord where you yourself taught father
[1:21:19] that how could a man try to build a
[1:21:20] tower and that county cost
[1:21:22] how could a king try to go to war and
[1:21:24] not understand the size of his army
[1:21:27] versus the enemy he has to find and make
[1:21:30] the necessary decisions
[1:21:32] for a positive outcome and how we cannot
[1:21:35] even be your disciples
[1:21:37] unless we are able to sit down and
[1:21:39] calculate the cost
[1:21:40] of what we need to give up to make room
[1:21:43] for your glory
[1:21:44] to make room for holiness to make room
[1:21:46] for perfection
[1:21:47] to make room for adoption to make room
[1:21:50] for redemption
[1:21:51] because these natural things will take
[1:21:53] up space if we allow it to
[1:21:55] but we need to plan to push these things
[1:21:58] out of our minds out of our heart out of
[1:22:00] our lives
[1:22:01] so that the holy spirit can flow freely
[1:22:04] so that you can say
[1:22:05] just as it was lord there's my spirit
[1:22:08] flowing freely this is my beloved
[1:22:10] son there's no hindrance there's no
[1:22:11] obstacle lord it's it's not by accident
[1:22:14] there's an effort there's a sacrifice
[1:22:16] there's a cost help us to
[1:22:17] understand that cost help us to bear
[1:22:20] that cost
[1:22:21] help us to approach that cost help us
[1:22:23] further
[1:22:24] through these scriptures that we read to
[1:22:26] be able to relook how we move how we
[1:22:28] live how we act
[1:22:29] where we get advice from are we getting
[1:22:31] enough advice are we approaching things
[1:22:33] in a systematic way
[1:22:34] do we understand the inventory of our
[1:22:36] lives of our family
[1:22:38] of our careers of our businesses of our
[1:22:40] ministries
[1:22:41] lord help us as we begin to really look
[1:22:44] at
[1:22:44] how you planned everything in a certain
[1:22:47] way
[1:22:47] to happen a certain how to do a certain
[1:22:50] thing help us to be just like
