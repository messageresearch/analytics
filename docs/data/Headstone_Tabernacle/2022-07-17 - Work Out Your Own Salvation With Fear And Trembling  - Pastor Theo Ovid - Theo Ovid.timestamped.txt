[46:39] just dry weather christians it's raining
[46:42] sunshine let there be sunshine in your
[46:44] soul amen
[46:45] praise the lord so philippians chapter 2
[46:48] we want to read from verse 12.
[46:55] okay
[46:56] wherefore my beloved as you have always
[46:58] obeyed
[47:00] not as in my presence only
[47:03] but now much more
[47:06] in my absence
[47:08] work out your own salvation
[47:12] with fear and trembling
[47:14] for it is god which worketh in you both
[47:17] to will
[47:19] and to do
[47:20] his good pleasure
[47:22] do all things without murmurings and
[47:24] disputants
[47:25] that you may be blameless and harmless
[47:28] the sons of god without rebuke
[47:31] in amidst a crooked and professed nation
[47:34] among whom
[47:36] he shines lights in the world
[47:38] holin fought the word of life that i may
[47:40] rejoice
[47:42] in the day of christ that i have not run
[47:45] in vain
[47:46] neither labored
[47:48] in vain
[47:50] and from hebrews chapter 1
[47:52] chapter 4 rather verse 1
[47:56] let us therefore fear at least a promise
[47:58] being left us of entering into his rest
[48:02] any of you should seem
[48:04] to come short of it for unto us was the
[48:07] gospel preached as well as unto them
[48:10] but the word preached did not profit
[48:11] them
[48:12] not being mixed with fate
[48:14] in them that heard it
[48:16] for we which have believed do enter into
[48:18] rest as he said as i have sworn in my
[48:20] rat if they shall enter into my rest
[48:23] although the works will finish from the
[48:25] foundation of the world
[48:27] for he is spake in a sitting place of
[48:29] the seventh day on this wise
[48:31] and god did rest the seventh day
[48:34] from all his works
[48:35] and in this place again
[48:37] if they shall enter into my rest
[48:40] seeing therefore it remaineth that some
[48:43] must enter therein
[48:44] and they to whom it was first preached
[48:46] ended not in because of unbelief again
[48:50] he limited a certain day saying in david
[48:52] today after so long a time as it is said
[48:54] today if you hear his voice had not your
[48:57] heart
[48:58] for if jesus had given them rest then
[49:01] would he not have afterwards spoken of
[49:03] another day
[49:04] there remain that therefore arrest to
[49:07] the people of god
[49:08] for he that say it for he that is
[49:11] entered into his rest notices his rest
[49:14] he also had ceased on his own works as
[49:16] god did from his
[49:18] and there's a voice i want to get to
[49:20] let us labor therefore
[49:22] to enter into that rest
[49:24] least any man fall
[49:26] after the same example
[49:28] of unbelief our last scripture from
[49:30] second peter chapter 1
[49:32] verse 10
[49:34] wherefore the rather brethren
[49:36] give diligence
[49:38] to make your calling and election show
[49:41] for if you do these things
[49:43] you shall never fall may god bless this
[49:45] word you may be seated
[49:47] praise the name of the lord
[49:49] so
[49:50] praise god so have a title this morning
[49:54] work out your own salvation
[49:56] with fear and trembling
[49:58] that's the title we have this morning
[49:59] work out your own
[50:01] salvation
[50:03] with fear and trembling
[50:05] have an inspiration
[50:06] let us labor
[50:08] to enter into that rest
[50:11] and that
[50:12] that that verse that inspiration we find
[50:14] out is from the hebrew scripture we we
[50:16] read
[50:17] have a subject make a call on the
[50:19] election show
[50:20] and that is what we get from second
[50:22] peter 1 10.
[50:23] so it is i have uh two context
[50:26] scriptures second timothy three one to
[50:27] nine you can write it down if you want
[50:29] second corinthians chapter seven
[50:31] verse one
[50:33] so
[50:34] we find out that
[50:36] god puts a seed
[50:38] and the object after the seed even
[50:41] though the seeds have great potential
[50:43] i want to listen carefully even though
[50:46] the seed is the seed the seed is
[50:47] original the seed of great potential
[50:51] unless the life of the seed unfolds it
[50:54] just remains a seed
[50:56] so you have to go beyond seeing god's
[50:59] word as a seed what you have to be
[51:01] concerned about is the unfolding of the
[51:03] life of that seed
[51:05] and for the life to unfold there's a
[51:08] debt required
[51:10] the debt of a corner wheat there is no
[51:12] way or wrong it
[51:14] there's no way you can't explain this
[51:16] away this is the reality of what it is
[51:18] it is what it is
[51:21] deliberated
[51:22] and when you have issues and challenges
[51:24] you deal as you find out it is what it
[51:26] is deal with it isn't that right
[51:28] so let us labor therefore into that rest
[51:32] it's a work
[51:34] it's a job it's a responsibility
[51:37] there is no free ride
[51:40] and hebrews 4 11 that last verse and the
[51:43] amplified says let us therefore be
[51:45] zealous
[51:47] and exert ourselves
[51:49] so that that is not being laid back
[51:52] that is not being thoughtful or lazy
[51:54] let us therefore be zealous
[51:57] that is being enthused
[51:59] so you can't have a deadbeat attitude
[52:00] you know
[52:01] whatever go go whatever will be k sarah
[52:04] whatever we will be not that
[52:06] let us be zealous
[52:08] and exert ourselves and strive
[52:12] diligently
[52:13] to enter into that rest of god
[52:16] to know and experience it for ourselves
[52:20] so you don't want to hear god was with a
[52:22] prophet and god with this one and that
[52:23] one you want to know god with you
[52:26] because you have to make your calling
[52:29] an election show
[52:31] so this is not to the church this is the
[52:32] individuals
[52:34] this message is to individuals this is
[52:36] not addressing church no church can make
[52:38] their calling and election show anytime
[52:40] you hear calling an election that's an
[52:41] individual
[52:42] because you as an individual is who's
[52:44] elected we're not talking about your
[52:46] wife your husband your chair and your
[52:47] family you as an individual is elected
[52:51] god called abraham who if on you he
[52:53] called he called you you have a
[52:54] responsibility for the calling of god
[52:57] upon your life
[52:58] glory to god the devil didn't call you
[53:01] you didn't just drop a wrong and you're
[53:02] hanging wrong no god called you
[53:05] not no pastor called you not no
[53:07] evangelist call you not no minister call
[53:10] you god himself call you
[53:13] you you you sitting here this morning
[53:17] oh glory to god i look at where your
[53:18] mother is who your father is they didn't
[53:20] call you
[53:21] no man can come except the father make a
[53:24] pull make a draw it's god himself you're
[53:27] wretched but he called you your back
[53:29] says what he called you you're this way
[53:31] and that way but he called you you up
[53:33] your tongue but he called you who he
[53:35] phoned you he called do i hear a shout
[53:38] in the house
[53:39] this ought to get everybody on fire
[53:42] don't read the god i ain't talking about
[53:44] your feeling call i'm talking about god
[53:46] call you you didn't feel nothing
[53:48] something happened and turn on your soul
[53:51] that's why you react to the gospel
[53:53] that's why you're responding to the
[53:54] gospel because god himself called you
[53:57] [Applause]
[54:03] know the same god that called you
[54:06] same god
[54:07] as your seed begin to unfold
[54:10] or the life when you begin to unfold you
[54:12] have different situations and conditions
[54:14] and challenges
[54:15] there's doubts
[54:17] there are fears
[54:18] there are certain things depression and
[54:20] frustration that same god i'd call you
[54:23] that same god in this world say make
[54:26] your calling
[54:28] an election show
[54:30] get a confirmation of it
[54:32] and when you get a confirmation of it no
[54:34] devil could move you i don't care what
[54:36] the ten thousand fall on your right side
[54:38] you shall not be moved
[54:40] oh glory to god as my david said is the
[54:42] confidence do i walk to the valley of
[54:44] the shadow of them i shall fear no evil
[54:46] for the lord with me thy run and stuff
[54:48] they comfort me oh glory to god don't be
[54:50] perish
[54:51] in the presence of my enemies my cup
[54:54] running over surely goodness and mercy
[54:56] that's a man who knows calling that a
[54:58] man who knows calling election show
[55:03] or could you give the lord a shout in
[55:04] the house that's why david said restore
[55:07] unto me the joy of my salvation take not
[55:10] thy holy spirit from me
[55:13] [Music]
[55:18] glory glory
[55:22] that's when our man nick is calling
[55:25] an election sure
[55:27] you know what there is no ten thousand
[55:28] following my rights i shall not be moved
[55:30] i'm not gonna do with that
[55:31] that they're shaking my
[55:33] that it's stumbling me i don't have ten
[55:35] thousand backslides that i shaken my
[55:37] faith
[55:38] [Applause]
[55:40] i shall not be moved
[55:42] i shall not be true
[55:45] blessed is the man who walketh not in
[55:46] the country of the ungodly nor stand in
[55:48] the way of sinners but is enlightened in
[55:51] the law of the lord and in that law that
[55:53] he meditated day and night he shall be
[55:55] like a tree
[55:56] not drop down planted
[56:00] anchored do you want to be like that
[56:03] [Applause]
[56:07] that same god
[56:08] that called you
[56:10] say work out your own salvation
[56:12] no pastor i could work that out for you
[56:14] no bishop no preacher no church people
[56:16] are hiding church
[56:18] there's hiding groups there's heidi and
[56:20] ministers and pastors they're hiding
[56:22] but the bible said work it out
[56:27] who don't work it out i took it out for
[56:28] you that is your maths problem you work
[56:31] it out
[56:32] i have minds to work out
[56:34] oh give the lord some praises
[56:36] [Applause]
[56:39] let us therefore be zealous
[56:41] and exert ourselves and strive
[56:42] diligently to enter that rest of god to
[56:46] know
[56:47] and experience it for ourselves
[56:50] that no one may fall or perish
[56:53] by the same kind of unbelief and
[56:54] disobedience unto which those in the
[56:56] wilderness fell
[57:00] philippians 2 12
[57:02] the bible talked about
[57:04] therefore

[59:01] not you're not you're not in a way of
[59:03] making no progress
[59:04] when god says every place you put your
[59:05] foot is yours
[59:07] and you're standing still
[59:09] and you're standing still get in your
[59:10] own fight you fight with this one you
[59:12] fight with that one you fight with it no
[59:13] fight for
[59:16] yourself you're giving your own self
[59:18] trouble and you're not even looking at
[59:19] yourself
[59:21] you believe in this one that will be
[59:22] like you blame this one blame this one
[59:23] you're looking for somebody to point
[59:24] your finger out
[59:26] and and when you point that one finger
[59:27] three forties fingers pointing back at
[59:28] you
[59:33] first peter 4 17
[59:35] for the time has come
[59:37] that judgment must begin at the house of
[59:40] god
[59:41] russia has certain judgment you know
[59:43] judgment started in god's house first
[59:47] i said putin could do what you want to
[59:48] do 30 bombs do this but drama had to
[59:50] start in god's house
[59:52] because where the issue of god going
[59:54] forward
[59:55] remember in god's house have more
[59:57] authority than prime
[59:59] you know
[1:00:02] a word from the lord could come to
[1:00:04] address nations
[1:00:06] kingdoms
[1:00:08] give me a scripture
[1:00:09] revelation 10 11 don't must prophesy
[1:00:12] again the nation kingdom tongues peoples
[1:00:15] god could bring prophetic utterances in
[1:00:17] this nation any nation any people
[1:00:20] anywhere that cannot fail because god
[1:00:22] cannot lie god himself come down in his
[1:00:24] last day to ensure that despite naked he
[1:00:28] has said no other angel the lord himself
[1:00:30] descended praise god with that book open
[1:00:33] to call your name
[1:00:38] you know what is tremendous
[1:00:40] calling your name is like calling the
[1:00:41] seed
[1:00:43] but the path that you have to play is to
[1:00:45] see that seed unfold
[1:00:46] [Applause]
[1:00:49] so you can say how much potential you
[1:00:51] have and we know you have potential we
[1:00:53] know you have what god given trace and
[1:00:55] ability it's still locked up but if it's
[1:00:57] laying on this table here nothing
[1:00:59] happening
[1:01:00] all we can say is i see you know like i
[1:01:02] see that god like that child
[1:01:06] but nothing hit you yet to unfold
[1:01:13] i recognize entitlements occasionally
[1:01:16] it's a curse that'll be upon our
[1:01:18] children or family or loved ones when
[1:01:20] you went to your own piece of hell and
[1:01:22] you went through what kind of hardships
[1:01:23] and you tell yourself you make it easier
[1:01:24] for your children they end up doing crap
[1:01:27] because they end up feeling untitled
[1:01:29] when you have to fight
[1:01:31] well paul fought wesley fought luther
[1:01:33] fought all them four and if you think
[1:01:35] you ain't go fight you wrong brother
[1:01:38] branham and hell fought
[1:01:40] so you guys sit there you're fighting
[1:01:42] for your healing you're fighting for
[1:01:43] deliverance you're fighting for your
[1:01:44] breakthrough you're fighting for a touch
[1:01:46] you're fighting for a refilling you're
[1:01:48] fighting for oh god a revival you're
[1:01:50] fighting you're groaning you're
[1:01:52] travailing praise god hallelujah you
[1:01:54] can't take it easy praise god you're
[1:01:56] breathing in and breathing out you're
[1:01:58] you're huffing you're puffing oh glory
[1:02:00] to god you're you're a man like a like a
[1:02:02] like a mother whoever child is sick
[1:02:04] you're worried you're piercing the floor
[1:02:06] you've got to get a breakthrough things
[1:02:07] can't continue as it going oh glory to
[1:02:10] god and the world said make your calling
[1:02:12] an election your father i want to do
[1:02:14] that oh god today is my day i want to
[1:02:16] know that i am genuinely called elected
[1:02:19] predestination for this hour oh god
[1:02:21] prepare my heart lord to face what's
[1:02:24] coming oh glory to god all kind of
[1:02:26] things coming dreadness famine plagues
[1:02:29] but adoption coming power coming rain
[1:02:31] coming fire coming and the manifestation
[1:02:34] the sons of god that is also coming
[1:02:36] [Applause]
[1:02:41] for the time has come
[1:02:43] that judgment must begin at the house of
[1:02:45] god
[1:02:46] and if it first digging at us
[1:02:48] what shall the end be of them that obey
[1:02:51] not
[1:02:52] the gospel of christ of god
[1:02:54] and if the righteous scarcely be saved
[1:02:57] scarcely
[1:02:59] where shall the ungodly and the sinner
[1:03:01] appear
[1:03:02] so that that make us work on exiles now
[1:03:05] that don't make us feel comfortable
[1:03:07] knowing that we hear that judgment have
[1:03:08] to begin in the house of god and the
[1:03:10] righteous as casey saved you can't just
[1:03:13] take things for granted you have to make
[1:03:15] a short assurance a confirmation
[1:03:18] of where god has called you at it's a
[1:03:20] push
[1:03:21] [Applause]
[1:03:28] this is one of the context scripture i
[1:03:29] quote
[1:03:30] second timothy three
[1:03:32] one
[1:03:33] we know it by way to listen it with a
[1:03:36] different ear this morning
[1:03:38] this know
[1:03:39] also that in the last days
[1:03:42] 2022 and forward perilous time shall
[1:03:44] come
[1:03:45] for men shall be
[1:03:47] lovers of their own selves
[1:03:49] that should be a whole message by itself
[1:03:52] covetous
[1:03:54] boasters
[1:03:56] proud
[1:03:57] blasphemous before i finish this is not
[1:04:00] unbelievable
[1:04:03] this is tribulation sins
[1:04:05] this is church members
[1:04:08] you don't say amen you know i know you
[1:04:09] know
[1:04:11] you talking the word here
[1:04:14] for men shall be lovers of their own
[1:04:15] selves coverages boasters proud
[1:04:17] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[1:04:19] and that disobedient brings on the curse
[1:04:23] because the bible says honor your father
[1:04:25] or mother that your days may be long
[1:04:30] honor them
[1:04:31] respect them
[1:04:33] don't disrespect them
[1:04:36] even if you don't agree with them honor
[1:04:37] them
[1:04:38] show them respect
[1:04:40] and god bless you for doing that
[1:04:42] they could be cuckoo it doesn't matter
[1:04:44] the way it said under them

[1:04:56] i was telling my wife
[1:04:58] was dreams about jacob
[1:05:00] and how
[1:05:01] the mother put the rough skin around him
[1:05:04] because he saw was if he was born and he
[1:05:06] was to get the blessing and she know
[1:05:08] what god said
[1:05:10] younger shall save the elder and so on
[1:05:11] like that
[1:05:12] and when
[1:05:14] jacob
[1:05:16] played his easter and he got the
[1:05:18] blessing and he walked out and he shall
[1:05:19] come home
[1:05:20] daddy he become a blessing
[1:05:24] we just walk all day
[1:05:27] he said that man is surely blessed
[1:05:30] because when it comes to his mouth
[1:05:33] he can't take it back
[1:05:36] [Applause]

[1:05:41] when a curse
[1:05:43] come out the mount of god
[1:05:44] you have to get back either you know
[1:05:46] what god blessed
[1:05:49] it's blessed
[1:05:50] and what god cursed
[1:05:52] is curse the weight is on both sides
[1:05:56] it's on one side only you know it's on
[1:05:58] both sides
[1:05:59] the bible said with many of them god was
[1:06:01] not pleased
[1:06:03] we talked about called out people
[1:06:05] elected people
[1:06:07] chosen people

[1:23:51] i remember when i first read the
[1:23:52] messages to concede i guess so much of
[1:23:54] light
[1:23:55] not in this believer
[1:23:56] but wondering if amazon sees

[1:24:23] i know i say but i lost my job great new
[1:24:25] one to me the joy
[1:24:27] [Music]
[1:24:29] he of it
[1:24:31] when they got him back you can't wait to
[1:24:33] come to church a joy of
[1:24:34] it was i was glad when they said unto me
[1:24:36] let us go
[1:24:38] in the house of the lord
[1:24:43] you know
[1:24:45] for permeating i was prepared and i was
[1:24:46] currently preparing this and then i
[1:24:47] recognized
[1:24:48] this can't go
[1:24:50] and then i just shifted and then i
[1:24:52] recognized this for me for today
[1:24:54] and it was striking me
[1:24:56] like this to him in philippians 3 14 i
[1:24:58] press
[1:24:59] towards the mark for the price
[1:25:02] of the high calling of god in christ
[1:25:03] jesus
[1:25:05] why is it we're not hearing i relax
[1:25:07] myself i don't know i'm a son i'm
[1:25:09] elected i'm cold i'm predestinated and
[1:25:12] i'm chilling
[1:25:14] why we don't hear that
[1:25:16] i
[1:25:18] press
[1:25:19] the words
[1:25:21] now if you're pressing and you're not
[1:25:22] mark you're in away person do you know
[1:25:24] say where are you going i press him
[1:25:26] we're going i i i know now but
[1:25:28] no no it doesn't work so you know presto
[1:25:30] was nothing
[1:25:33] that's why goals he doesn't have a goal
[1:25:36] um you know i want to save 10 000
[1:25:38] um i was going to save ten dollars by
[1:25:40] win
[1:25:44] you're not going to save it
[1:25:46] you have to say i want to save 10 000
[1:25:48] in six months time
[1:25:50] then you could know what they put
[1:25:51] supposedly each month
[1:25:53] do you want to buy a house
[1:25:56] i remember i wanted three children i
[1:25:58] wanted a house by a certain age and as
[1:26:00] my life began to unfold scenes unfold
[1:26:01] just like that
[1:26:03] i speak it i believe it i walk in it
[1:26:06] you speak it you believe it you walk in
[1:26:07] it don't leave no open gaps
[1:26:09] put time on things
[1:26:12] because time and things make it tight
[1:26:14] and give you the ambition and passion
[1:26:16] and zeal to get it done
[1:26:21] if you say you want to clean the house
[1:26:22] second one you can always one man pass
[1:26:23] to one past two years past four years
[1:26:25] yeah still looking you want to you know
[1:26:29] but the reason it is not done because
[1:26:30] you put no time on it
[1:26:33] you leave it open-ended
[1:26:35] so in your spirit there's no desperation
[1:26:37] there's no illnesses there's no time to
[1:26:38] it but if you say i want this done in
[1:26:41] one week
[1:26:42] then all goes the trash all goes this
[1:26:45] and you pelt this thing outside because
[1:26:46] if what it done in one week you put a
[1:26:48] time on it
[1:26:52] that's why when heaven when the seven
[1:26:54] seat book was was was silenced for half
[1:26:56] an hour
[1:27:00] god didn't even open the only half an
[1:27:01] hour
[1:27:02] and salmon's over
[1:27:04] oh glory to god hallelujah praise god
[1:27:07] our lives are not open
[1:27:11] time to burn a time to die
[1:27:13] and what we unfold is in between
[1:27:15] our lives are not open-ended don't live
[1:27:18] a open-ended life
[1:27:20] put some tags on your life
[1:27:22] give the lord a shout
[1:27:24] praise god praise god praise god david
[1:27:27] said the lord shall perfect that which
[1:27:29] considered me
[1:27:31] glory to god i look at what the devil
[1:27:33] say what the enemy does
[1:27:35] glory to god hallelujah
[1:27:37] [Applause]
[1:27:40] i press
[1:27:41] towards the mark for the prize of the
[1:27:44] high calling
[1:27:45] in christ jesus so you could understand
[1:27:47] now
[1:27:48] a bit of why i i do what i do how i do
[1:27:52] it
[1:27:55] people find that sometimes i'm over
[1:27:58] i'm i'm pushing too much
[1:28:00] anything like that i was always scared
[1:28:02] of
[1:28:03] the pentecostalism that i saw in the
[1:28:06] early years people just waiting i'm
[1:28:07] going in rapture and they're sitting
[1:28:08] down in any way and live in any way and
[1:28:11] whatnot but we won't get on into it
[1:28:13] about this making your election sure
[1:28:14] thing all right
[1:28:16] let's continue
[1:28:18] but abraham
[1:28:19] you see in god's law redemption
[1:28:22] as it was with boers and naomi it had to
[1:28:24] be a kinsmen
[1:28:26] and the only way that man could be
[1:28:27] redeemed god had to become a kinsman
[1:28:29] which is near
[1:28:31] all right
[1:28:32] i want you to see it
[1:28:34] he never become kinfolk altogether to
[1:28:36] the rich or to the mighty but he was
[1:28:38] born in a stable wrapped in sweden
[1:28:39] clothed
[1:28:40] not to the adult but to the child
[1:28:43] he was god over the creation
[1:28:46] he choose to do it not come in full
[1:28:48] mature man he's the part i want to get
[1:28:51] not come a full matured man he came
[1:28:55] that he might suffer the feelings of the
[1:28:57] little babies
[1:28:59] [Music]
[1:29:01] he came
[1:29:04] that he might go through teenage
[1:29:05] temptations
[1:29:08] he my goal that he could toil the
[1:29:10] toilets and the snails of the devil as a
[1:29:12] man
[1:29:14] and make a way for people of all ages
[1:29:17] of all ages of all class
[1:29:20] the poor the rich he became poor that
[1:29:23] through his poverty we might become rich
[1:29:25] and heirs with him in his kingdom
[1:29:27] a sign would be given crossing himself
[1:29:29] making himself something different than
[1:29:31] he was now a super sign crying as a baby
[1:29:34] plain as a boy
[1:29:36] tallinn as a man and his apart it was
[1:29:39] god living all stages of life like we do
[1:29:46] so you can't say he didn't understand he
[1:29:48] doesn't know he knows
[1:29:50] he understands and he cares
[1:29:53] that is why you go through what you go
[1:29:55] through he understands because he went
[1:29:57] through the challenges that you go
[1:30:03] let's go
[1:30:08] brethren i say this with reverence and
[1:30:10] respect to you as my brethren
[1:30:12] knowing that maybe before night we'll
[1:30:14] all stand at the judgment seat of christ
[1:30:15] in heaven
[1:30:16] may i say this
[1:30:18] that it's the atmosphere
[1:30:21] that always
[1:30:22] brings forth the product
[1:30:24] the hen the actual way of hand is to
[1:30:26] have chickens is with a hinterly on the
[1:30:28] egg covered with a body that makes the
[1:30:30] warmth of the hen's body hatches the egg
[1:30:33] but you could put it on the incubator
[1:30:34] it's the same want warmth and atmosphere
[1:30:37] it produced chicken just the same i
[1:30:39] don't care if it's under the methodist
[1:30:40] baptist presbyterian the atmosphere of
[1:30:42] the word if the word which is the egg on
[1:30:45] in the right atmosphere it will produce
[1:30:48] a born-again child
[1:30:50] see where it's under the pentecostal
[1:30:52] gospel where it is it's the attitude
[1:30:54] that we take towards god divine word
[1:30:56] many of you have heard of john spool
[1:30:58] he's a good friend of mine he at one
[1:31:00] time he was taken by the uh take note by
[1:31:03] the guy to a garden he saw a great
[1:31:05] statue of christ
[1:31:07] and he said he stood off and criticized
[1:31:09] it he said what was this culpa mean
[1:31:11] sculpture meaning
[1:31:12] look here there's no sufferings there's
[1:31:14] nothing just plain
[1:31:16] and while he was criticizing it to his
[1:31:18] wife
[1:31:19] the guide walked up and said mr spool
[1:31:21] perhaps
[1:31:22] you're criticizing the work of the
[1:31:24] sculpture he said yes i don't see why he
[1:31:26] hung up there like that it doesn't look
[1:31:28] anything like it to show the sufferings
[1:31:29] of christ
[1:31:30] he said sir it's the way you are looking
[1:31:33] at it
[1:31:34] he said no it's got to alter down deer
[1:31:37] if you come down here and kneel down
[1:31:40] and he kneeled down he said no look up
[1:31:42] and he said his heart could break
[1:31:45] there was features of the suffering of
[1:31:47] christ when he looked up
[1:31:48] you see
[1:31:49] it's the way you're looking at it
[1:31:53] so here it is he looked the sculpture he
[1:31:55] criticized it and the guy tell him you
[1:31:57] know what you need to go down at the
[1:31:58] altar
[1:31:59] and look up
[1:32:01] look again
[1:32:03] how you look at it
[1:32:04] and the prophet says this you know and
[1:32:07] that's the way it is with the word of
[1:32:09] god brethren it's the way you're looking
[1:32:11] at it
[1:32:12] if you stand off and look at it from an
[1:32:14] observation and a point of criticism to
[1:32:16] say this guy hasn't got it that guy
[1:32:18] hasn't got it it won't work
[1:32:20] it's got to get done and look up to and
[1:32:22] that brings the results then you have a
[1:32:25] different attitude and a different
[1:32:27] attitude towards your brethren a
[1:32:29] different attitude towards the man who
[1:32:31] is striving for the same thing that you
[1:32:33] are trying to strive for
[1:32:35] and it will break down barriers then
[1:32:38] oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:32:41] as we say the same bloodiest of me is
[1:32:42] for you also
[1:32:44] oh glory to god i say it again the same
[1:32:46] blood for me is for you and the same
[1:32:48] blood for you is for your brother and
[1:32:49] for your sister even though they don't
[1:32:51] see i agree with you
[1:32:53] oh glory to god amen
[1:32:55] do you believe that
[1:32:57] but ibrahim
[1:32:58] he said now watch
[1:33:00] we're going to talk about demons in the
[1:33:02] spiritual form in the soul
[1:33:04] then the soul the same as they in the
[1:33:07] body
[1:33:08] and we are born to admit that we see
[1:33:10] them in people's bodies such as cancers
[1:33:13] and different diseases in the human body
[1:33:15] just recently even cancer has been
[1:33:17] declared to be a fourth dimension
[1:33:19] disease
[1:33:20] it's in another dimension it is
[1:33:22] demonology
[1:33:24] every disease is a fourth dimension
[1:33:27] disease
[1:33:29] the beginning of it
[1:33:30] so that means he's saying
[1:33:32] that's where x-rays for dimension
[1:33:34] can see
[1:33:36] these cancer things for dementia disease
[1:33:39] right
[1:33:40] now what now cancer in the body
[1:33:42] or cancer in the soul
[1:33:45] the demon can come in either place
[1:33:48] and there are many times and many
[1:33:49] peoples with good thoughts good people
[1:33:51] who try many times to rest upon some
[1:33:53] little theology they have
[1:33:55] something that they have been taught
[1:33:56] since a child and still find that dung
[1:33:58] and their being dung in their soul they
[1:34:01] still have some that's not right
[1:34:03] you are many here this morning no doubt
[1:34:05] whether you find christians gathered
[1:34:06] together you find people who has those
[1:34:08] spirits in them it's undesirable they
[1:34:11] don't want them they say oh if i can
[1:34:13] only quit lying if i can liquid lusting
[1:34:15] if i'm going to equate this that that's
[1:34:17] devils
[1:34:18] and they come in the form of religion
[1:34:19] many times
[1:34:21] they come in the form of religions
[1:34:23] you see now
[1:34:24] today many people are listening
[1:34:26] so many people are listening to enticing
[1:34:28] spirits
[1:34:29] instead of taking the word of god
[1:34:32] spirits there in the world they are
[1:34:33] demons and they go out into places and
[1:34:36] they get among men
[1:34:38] ministers
[1:34:40] they get among church members
[1:34:42] they get amongst good people
[1:34:45] and they cause them to come into an
[1:34:47] illusion
[1:34:48] and they say things and do things and
[1:34:52] teach things and practice things that is
[1:34:54] contrary to the word of god
[1:34:56] so the word of god is the blueprint
[1:34:59] the word of god is the prom line
[1:35:01] the word of god is the standard you
[1:35:03] could check anything else by the word
[1:35:06] and if we begin to do that then we'll be
[1:35:07] on right we'll be on point
[1:35:10] oh glory to god are you with me now
[1:35:12] today ministers
[1:35:14] in the congregation allowing the people
[1:35:15] to play cars and the churches many of
[1:35:17] them and protestants do that too all
[1:35:18] right let's continue what is it
[1:35:21] it's enticing spirits
[1:35:23] coming down
[1:35:24] trying to substitute something for the
[1:35:26] word of god
[1:35:27] god has no substitute for his word
[1:35:31] god has nothing to substitute faith
[1:35:33] faith has no substitute
[1:35:35] hope will never take the place of faith
[1:35:37] faith is alone faith stands alone hope
[1:35:40] can never take its place
[1:35:42] hallelujah praise god one is
[1:35:45] intellectual faith and one is a direct
[1:35:47] revelation of god
[1:35:48] it will never take its place
[1:35:50] praise god we are trying to make
[1:35:52] substitute
[1:35:53] just because we can be emotional don't
[1:35:55] mean we are saved here we go
[1:35:58] because we go to church i don't mean we
[1:35:59] are saved here we go
[1:36:01] i want this to rock here
[1:36:03] people send me a message that don't mean
[1:36:04] they says
[1:36:07] you ever think about that
[1:36:08] they believe the prophet don't mean to
[1:36:10] save
[1:36:12] here we go
[1:36:15] because we can get emotional don't mean
[1:36:17] we are saved because we got a church
[1:36:19] domain we are saved don't believe those
[1:36:22] entities spirits a real spirit of god a
[1:36:25] real word of god is the truth of god
[1:36:28] which is the seed of god will produce
[1:36:30] god in your life and be godly and
[1:36:32] saintly
[1:36:34] glory to god so you're not looking for
[1:36:36] what people are confessing you know it's
[1:36:37] what people manifest in
[1:36:39] is what their spirit and heart is
[1:36:40] pulsing
[1:36:42] there we go
[1:36:43] among a lot of people we find where
[1:36:45] emotions and so forth
[1:36:47] they become tacklings
[1:36:49] back titans
[1:36:51] and all kind of ungodly things brother
[1:36:53] that sulfuric acid in the church
[1:36:56] it is demon powers
[1:36:58] spirit of men and women who get amongst
[1:37:00] one another and try to push off and say
[1:37:02] this is not right this is not right that
[1:37:04] is not right if you chase it down 19 out
[1:37:06] of 10 is the very person making this
[1:37:08] still that's not right
[1:37:10] god here we go
[1:37:12] now this is the word now what we want to
[1:37:14] read
[1:37:15] god hates
[1:37:17] discord
[1:37:19] among brethren
[1:37:22] you see our brothers like the cut off
[1:37:23] people and cutters one got one an older
[1:37:26] one this one is shocked this one is this
[1:37:27] and hold on
[1:37:29] god
[1:37:30] eats that
[1:37:34] that's why you hear me see sometimes
[1:37:35] people are not acting as christians i
[1:37:37] don't even know if they are already
[1:37:38] saved
[1:37:39] because their behavior not even basic
[1:37:41] christianity
[1:37:44] yet they go to church and yet they
[1:37:45] believe this message
[1:37:46] that's what they claim
[1:37:49] are you with me
[1:37:50] but the prophet identified the
[1:37:51] unbelieving spirit that is in his
[1:37:53] message too
[1:37:54] is unbeliever make believer untrue
[1:37:55] believer
[1:37:58] okay
[1:38:00] god hates discord among brethren
[1:38:02] be reverent be holy love god stand by
[1:38:05] him as long as you know your life is
[1:38:07] giving up with the bible with purity of
[1:38:09] heart purity of thought love towards
[1:38:12] your brother trying your best to build
[1:38:14] the kingdom of god doing those things
[1:38:16] dressing right living right talking
[1:38:17] right going right places then you can
[1:38:19] have all the emotions you want to
[1:38:21] and everybody will believe it
[1:38:24] hallelujah
[1:38:26] so all these demons activities and
[1:38:28] whatnot that's to the individual
[1:38:32] work out your salvation
[1:38:34] with fear and trembling be concerned
[1:38:36] today about you
[1:38:39] don't go and interfere anybody business
[1:38:41] this wrong that's wrong who wrong and
[1:38:43] what this one's supposed to be doing and
[1:38:44] this one not doing supposed to do it no
[1:38:46] you begin to search out you
[1:38:49] let's continue now
[1:38:51] there's sure going to be some great
[1:38:52] disappointments on the day of judgement
[1:38:54] the bootlegger in way is going after
[1:38:56] judgment so does the behong know he's
[1:38:58] going so does the prostitute know where
[1:39:00] she's stand so does the gambler know
[1:39:02] where she stands so does the drunkard
[1:39:03] know where he stand he'll not be
[1:39:05] disappointed
[1:39:06] disappointed
[1:39:07] but where the disappointment is going to
[1:39:09] be is those who thought they were right
[1:39:13] that is where the disappointment
[1:39:14] when they got up there and say sure we
[1:39:16] cast all devils in your name we are
[1:39:17] preachers we belong in certain churches
[1:39:19] we've done great things and miracles and
[1:39:20] he said he part for me you workers of
[1:39:22] iniquity i never even knew you
[1:39:24] there you are that's a disappointment
[1:39:26] the children of their children will come
[1:39:28] in and sit down on the kingdom and say
[1:39:29] we got a right to be here entitlement
[1:39:32] see now we have a right to be here
[1:39:34] that is why they tell jesus our fathers
[1:39:36] eat man in the wilderness and you say
[1:39:38] i'm to everyone dead they were at they
[1:39:41] was actually plugging into the legacy of
[1:39:43] the history and the lineage of the
[1:39:44] fathers
[1:39:46] he said we're all undead
[1:39:47] and that dead means not dying going
[1:39:49] wrong you know that means death
[1:39:50] separated from god
[1:39:51] so don't go there
[1:39:53] because your father's prophesy of me
[1:39:56] the prophet prophesied that i'll be here
[1:39:57] i know you're turning it down
[1:39:59] so god always bring the word to bring a
[1:40:01] fresh prophecy to the people god is not
[1:40:03] stale
[1:40:04] god is not backward the book is a book
[1:40:06] of prophecy not just a there's a book
[1:40:09] about good behavior it's a book of
[1:40:10] prophecy and the prophecy and unfolding
[1:40:12] all the time so you had was the be you
[1:40:15] had to come when you came
[1:40:17] because you are part of the words of the
[1:40:18] book
[1:40:20] oh glory to god we believe that
[1:40:22] so what we have a right to be here and
[1:40:24] they'll be cast out into outer darkness
[1:40:26] there'll be weeping
[1:40:27] wheeling nation of teach traitors again
[1:40:29] now there's a way that lead to life few
[1:40:31] there be that find it
[1:40:33] but the banner to you my dear people
[1:40:35] this morning
[1:40:36] listen to this
[1:40:38] i never made this up
[1:40:40] i'm responsible for telling it that's
[1:40:42] all i'm responsible for
[1:40:43] if i never preach another semen in my
[1:40:46] life
[1:40:46] that is the truth there's just going to
[1:40:48] be a few people saved
[1:40:50] just remember that just a few you'll be
[1:40:52] one of them
[1:40:54] who are they brother branham i don't
[1:40:55] know
[1:40:56] nobody else knows we work out our own
[1:40:59] salvation
[1:41:01] with fear and trembling
[1:41:04] but
[1:41:05] you'll be lined up with god
[1:41:07] if your heart don't beat just with the
[1:41:09] bible then there's something wrong there
[1:41:11] is something wrong no matter what your
[1:41:13] church says you can't go in by that
[1:41:17] so a pastor say you are the irony bride
[1:41:20] digest
[1:41:21] semantics
[1:41:23] verbal gymnastics they're just woods
[1:41:25] you have to know what's going on in your
[1:41:27] heart
[1:41:28] to know if you are part of this bright
[1:41:29] body
[1:41:32] you feel what i'm saying
[1:41:33] the bride is here everybody says it's
[1:41:35] not non-bride there's foolishness
[1:41:38] no man have the authority to pronounce
[1:41:39] that
[1:41:40] are you with me
[1:41:42] what who are they brother branham i
[1:41:44] don't know nobody else knows we work out
[1:41:47] isn't that sincere and humble
[1:41:49] that he's answering this question who it
[1:41:51] is who's the bride i don't know
[1:41:54] but you nobody else knows we woke up our
[1:41:55] own salvation trembling all right now
[1:41:58] what but you'll be lined up with god if
[1:42:00] your heart don't beat just with the
[1:42:01] bible then there's something wrong
[1:42:03] there's something wrong no matter what
[1:42:04] your church say you can't go in by that
[1:42:06] you've got to go in by what god said
[1:42:09] this is the book that you'll be judged
[1:42:11] from the bible
[1:42:13] or give the lord a shout on that
[1:42:15] not how long you wear your tie i'm
[1:42:17] almost dread long just your way and
[1:42:19] you're just done by your uncle that's
[1:42:21] not what you were judged by it's from
[1:42:22] the book
[1:42:25] who your pastor is what church you go to
[1:42:27] that is not where i'm being judged from
[1:42:29] the book
[1:42:33] here we go
[1:42:35] you say well i've been baptized in the
[1:42:36] name of the lord jesus that's correct
[1:42:38] that is bible but if that light doesn't
[1:42:41] follow it it didn't do you much good
[1:42:43] well i received the holy ghost that's
[1:42:44] good what you have done but if the life
[1:42:47] isn't there oh that's a big one he said
[1:42:49] you'll receive the baptism but to your
[1:42:51] faith you have to add the rest
[1:42:56] so you gotta start and god wants you to
[1:42:57] complete it
[1:42:59] god wanted life to unfold
[1:43:03] nobody becomes a master overnight
[1:43:07] a teacher
[1:43:08] a mechanic
[1:43:10] a doctor
[1:43:11] nobody just say i want to be a doctor
[1:43:13] you know ready exam signing papers where
[1:43:15] are you putting the operator on
[1:43:16] passport a knife
[1:43:19] if you hear somebody just pass some exam
[1:43:20] and they come in with a knife
[1:43:22] to operate on you you know you will be
[1:43:24] healed because you run out of that
[1:43:25] theater one time
[1:43:27] that person will kill you
[1:43:29] you don't become a master overnight
[1:43:33] it takes time
[1:43:38] it takes time to mature
[1:43:40] you can't have a child a child like a
[1:43:42] seed
[1:43:43] the child is growing two years four
[1:43:44] years seven years potentially they could
[1:43:46] be a doctor they could be a lawyer 20
[1:43:48] years from then
[1:43:50] but you can't put lawyer on the shoulder
[1:43:51] right now
[1:43:54] you can't crunch them no when they they
[1:43:56] have to manifest that 20 30 years
[1:43:57] something
[1:43:59] when they mature when they're ready when
[1:44:00] they're right
[1:44:02] so you can't expect god to give some
[1:44:03] little baby power to do what
[1:44:08] they make superman or something make
[1:44:09] some big toy
[1:44:12] so god have to put sons through tests
[1:44:14] and trials
[1:44:15] to get met along to them
[1:44:17] to get character out of them to get
[1:44:20] quality of out to them these are
[1:44:23] perfections perfectionist patience
[1:44:26] waiting on god
[1:44:28] and waiting for god
[1:44:30] you have need of patience
[1:44:32] after you have done the will of god
[1:44:34] oh glory to god let patience have a
[1:44:37] perfect work
[1:44:38] that you will mature entire lack of
[1:44:41] nothing
[1:44:42] oh give the lord a shout in the house
[1:44:45] oh
[1:44:46] hallelujah so hush of us
[1:44:49] and have patience with god
[1:44:51] and have patience with yourself too
[1:44:53] but let us press this morning
[1:44:55] and work out our own salvation with
[1:44:57] trembling
[1:44:58] when you leave here you must leave him
[1:44:59] in the consciousness of you as an
[1:45:01] individual in this plan and program of
[1:45:03] god
[1:45:04] not you beyonce
[1:45:06] you are the individual
[1:45:08] give the lord a shout
[1:45:10] you as an individual
[1:45:18] remember the weeds
[1:45:19] receive the same power that falls on the
[1:45:21] wheat to make it grow
[1:45:23] makes the weed shout too little old weed
[1:45:26] stand right there just as happy as the
[1:45:27] witches
[1:45:28] lives by the same life and a sinner can
[1:45:31] stay in the presence of god and shout
[1:45:32] the victory and live like a christian
[1:45:34] but if there isn't something different
[1:45:35] in the heart
[1:45:36] he could have the same power to cast out
[1:45:38] devils jesus said so he can preach the
[1:45:40] gospel and be good as any other preacher
[1:45:41] can
[1:45:42] do i have faith through mountains if i
[1:45:44] cast all difference in this name i am
[1:45:46] nothing
[1:45:47] the thing to do here we go from your
[1:45:49] heart be a christian
[1:45:51] now enter in that straight gate for
[1:45:53] broad is the way that leads to
[1:45:55] destruction and millions time millions
[1:45:57] and this generation of believers will go
[1:45:59] in their act because treating the gate
[1:46:02] now is the way just you and christ alone
[1:46:05] just who
[1:46:07] you
[1:46:08] and christ alone will give the lord some
[1:46:11] praises
[1:46:13] hallelujah
[1:46:14] [Applause]
[1:46:17] when god speaks anything god makes a
[1:46:19] comment a statement for as long as it
[1:46:21] sees it it's perfect
[1:46:23] it's got to come to pass
[1:46:25] it have no explanation why it didn't
[1:46:26] come to pass once god speak it
[1:46:29] if it didn't come to pass it wasn't god
[1:46:30] said it
[1:46:32] it's a man said
[1:46:33] and whatever man say will fail
[1:46:35] but whenever god speaks it will surely
[1:46:37] come to pass
[1:46:39] oh give the lord a shout in the house
[1:46:41] my god my god
[1:46:44] jacob do all his tricks with his mother
[1:46:46] to get the blessing but when that
[1:46:47] blessing dropped on him so nothing
[1:46:49] couldn't change that not even god
[1:46:51] himself could change that
[1:46:53] because the mount coming out
[1:46:55] isaac a son of god
[1:46:57] and what is blessed is blessed blessings
[1:46:58] coming out of the mountain you know
[1:47:00] those motes are dangerous you know don't
[1:47:02] crush them you know hallelujah don't
[1:47:04] fight with them you know because you
[1:47:05] want the blessing oh glory to god say
[1:47:08] that blessing i will bless thee and
[1:47:10] multiply and i will multiply thy seed
[1:47:12] and thy seed shall possess the gates oh

[1:47:27] scripture oh god i see the people that

[1:57:02] right
[1:57:03] what was she doing she was trying to
[1:57:05] find favor with boaz
[1:57:07] so she worked her way
[1:57:09] through the stage of legalism

[2:08:15] because you had to produce messiah
[2:08:18] and the secret is what the word is in
[2:08:20] the bride
[2:08:21] so it's a prophesied pregnancy
[2:08:23] that the word will be in you
[2:08:25] we could go down to revelation 10 8 and
[2:08:27] find john was aku representative bride
[2:08:29] he was totally go to the angel and take
[2:08:31] the book
[2:08:32] and eat the book and never eat the book
[2:08:34] the word going to be in you because you
[2:08:35] are taking in the word
[2:08:37] oh glory to god let me try to wrap up
[2:08:39] here now
[2:08:42] how they grown and cry in the liver
[2:08:43] pains but when they are born when
[2:08:45] and
[2:08:47] positionally born into the kingdom of
[2:08:49] god then the holy ghost has set in the
[2:08:51] church
[2:08:52] so see watch that open the bible read
[2:08:54] ephesians 11. when god has certainly
[2:08:56] changed apostles prophet evangelist
[2:08:58] everybody thinks this prophecy is
[2:08:59] evangelist automatically entitled to
[2:09:01] that
[2:09:03] because a day long time
[2:09:04] man believed that because the people
[2:09:06] paid 40 years
[2:09:07] they anointed pastor they adopted them
[2:09:09] all
[2:09:10] there is only wishful thinking you know
[2:09:12] that is spirit of entitlement did they
[2:09:14] long time what i have to do anything
[2:09:16] doesn't have to do anything at all
[2:09:19] he says watch when this happens
[2:09:22] then
[2:09:23] the holy ghost
[2:09:25] has said
[2:09:27] not man appoint
[2:09:29] not the people voting this man
[2:09:31] then this happened here groaning
[2:09:32] travailing placed positionally then the
[2:09:35] holy ghost said watch in the church some
[2:09:38] apostles some prophets some teachers
[2:09:40] some pastors some evangelists and into
[2:09:43] deer speaking with tongues so it's all
[2:09:45] one continuous line
[2:09:47] it's not just it's not just holy ghost
[2:09:49] ministry then you pull pit it are
[2:09:50] speaking in tongues intervention of
[2:09:52] tongues knowledge wisdom give something
[2:09:54] what he's saying all kind of americans
[2:09:55] the gifts back in the church
[2:09:57] so this this this drama this scene is to
[2:10:00] produce not only a fifo ministry but the
[2:10:03] gifts return back to the church because
[2:10:04] that is where it belongs it belongs in
[2:10:06] the body
[2:10:07] go give the lord a praise offering
[2:10:09] let me say it again all the gifts belong
[2:10:12] to christ's body which is tongues
[2:10:15] interpretations wisdom healing look at
[2:10:18] me just preaching the word and following
[2:10:19] the word of holy mysteries all of that
[2:10:21] too
[2:10:22] that comes with it
[2:10:26] okay last page
[2:10:31] strife
[2:10:35] that word striving
[2:10:37] it means make great efforts to achieve
[2:10:40] or obtain something
[2:10:42] not effort great effort
[2:10:44] when somebody's striving oh god are
[2:10:46] striving striving you're fighting you're
[2:10:49] making what
[2:10:50] great effort see if there comes some
[2:10:52] prayer in five minutes and yeah when you
[2:10:54] leave here could be in five minutes how
[2:10:56] do you see everything yesterday
[2:10:58] another great effort
[2:11:00] when they go go from five to one hour
[2:11:02] and you hit them at two hours in a
[2:11:04] corner there because you're wrestling
[2:11:05] with god you're making a great effort
[2:11:06] you're showing god you know what i need
[2:11:08] to talk with you i need to get this over
[2:11:09] with i need to get rid of my chest so
[2:11:12] instead of gossiping along with somebody
[2:11:13] in the phone telling your problems and
[2:11:14] so on you're telling god your problems
[2:11:16] and you want god to help you with your
[2:11:17] problems
[2:11:19] you have problems all of us have
[2:11:20] problems challenges situations but you
[2:11:22] want god to intervene you want a
[2:11:24] supernatural element you want something
[2:11:26] supernatural so listen strive
[2:11:29] is to make great efforts to achieve
[2:11:30] something
[2:11:32] obtain something
[2:11:34] to struggle
[2:11:35] or fight vigorously
[2:11:38] you think cancer is something
[2:11:40] the bible said there's come in a time
[2:11:41] when men will rot right in their flesh
[2:11:43] and the bosses will eat off their
[2:11:45] carcasses before they even die can't say
[2:11:47] is that true take to what's coming but
[2:11:48] remember that horrible thing was
[2:11:50] forbidden today to touch those who are
[2:11:52] the seed of god
[2:11:53] that is what we are striving for now
[2:11:56] to get in
[2:11:58] and be positionally placed into the
[2:11:59] kingdom of god before this horrible
[2:12:01] break strike
[2:12:02] so that's what they're striving for to
[2:12:04] get in oh hallelujah last quote
[2:12:08] now we see
[2:12:10] we can see why there are two vines
[2:12:13] one true
[2:12:15] one false
[2:12:16] now we can see why abram are two sons
[2:12:19] one after the flesh that puts you
[2:12:20] together isaac and after the promise
[2:12:23] now we can see how that one of the same
[2:12:26] parents two boys comfort as twins
[2:12:28] one knowing and loving the things of god
[2:12:31] the other knowing much of the same truth
[2:12:33] but not of the same spirit
[2:12:35] and hence persecuted a child
[2:12:37] that was elect
[2:12:40] god did not reprobate
[2:12:42] for the sake of reprobation
[2:12:44] he reprobated for the sake of the elect
[2:12:48] are you ready
[2:12:49] elect
[2:12:51] cannot persecute elect
[2:12:54] elect
[2:12:56] cannot harm elect
[2:12:58] it is the reprobates that persecute and
[2:13:02] destroy the elect
[2:13:04] all those reparats are religious
[2:13:06] they are smart
[2:13:08] they are of the canine discipline seed
[2:13:11] they build their peoples they build
[2:13:13] their cities they build the empires and
[2:13:15] all the wild calling on god
[2:13:17] they hate the true seed and they will do
[2:13:20] all they can even the name of the lord
[2:13:22] to destroy god's elected ones
[2:13:24] but they are needed
[2:13:27] what is the chaft of the wheat
[2:13:29] no chaff no wheat
[2:13:30] but at the end what happens to the chaff
[2:13:33] it is burned
[2:13:34] with fire unquenchable
[2:13:36] under wheat where is it it is gathered
[2:13:38] into the gunner
[2:13:40] it is where he is
[2:13:42] oh elect of god beware
[2:13:45] study closely
[2:13:47] be careful
[2:13:48] work out your own salvation with fear
[2:13:51] and trembling
[2:13:52] rely upon god
[2:13:54] be strong in his might
[2:13:56] your adversary the devil is even now
[2:13:59] going about like a roaring lion seeking
[2:14:01] woman will devour watch unto pray and be
[2:14:03] steadfast
[2:14:04] this is the end time
[2:14:06] both the true and false vine are coming
[2:14:08] into maturity
[2:14:10] but before the week matures those
[2:14:12] ripened tears must be bone for the
[2:14:14] burning they're all joining the world
[2:14:16] conquest churches that is the binding
[2:14:19] soon the gardening of the wheat will
[2:14:20] come
[2:14:21] but right now the two spirits are at
[2:14:24] work in the two vines come on from among
[2:14:26] the tears
