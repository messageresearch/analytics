Praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Oh, do you love him tonight? Happy to be in the house of the Lord. And just for a reading of the Psalms, you don't have to find it, but Psalms 46 says, "God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea, though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof, there is a river. The streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most high. God is in the midst of her. She shall not be moved. God shall help her. And that right early, the heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved. He uttered his voice, the earth melted. The Lord of hosts is with us. The God of Jacob is our refuge. Sailor, may God add blessing to the region of Israel. Let let us bow our heads. Almighty God, we are we are here to praise you tonight. Lord, we are here to worship you, Father.

May that be our heart's desire tonight. And may you hear our prayer. Bless your people. Take me out of the way and be glorified tonight in our midst. In Jesus name we ask it. Amen. And amen. It's great to be in God's presence. Thank you for coming out tonight. God bless you. Have your Bibles. I like to turn to three portion of scripture. Romans 8. Want to read from 14 to18, Ephesians 1, one verse there, verse 11, and 1 Peter 1 1:5. So Romans 8:14 to 18, it says, "For as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. For we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but we have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry above, Father, the spirit itself be witness with our spirit that we are the children of God." And listen, if children, then ears. You can't split it. You can't separate it. If children, then ears. Ears of God and joint ears with Christ. If so be that we suffer with him, that we may be glorified together. For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. Ephesians 1 and we want to read verse 11. I know uh yes we 11. Uh some of the page got stuck. All right. Verse 11 said, "In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workketh all things after the council of his will." Our last scripture from 1 Peter 1, St. Peter, an apostle of the Jesus Christ to the strangers scattered throughout Pontto, Galatia, Capidosia, Asia, and Bethnia. elect according to the fornowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the Spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ. Grace unto you and peace be multiplied. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy, had begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you. May God bless his word. Let's pray. Father, we thank you for your word tonight. May you come and make it manifest. come and reveal it, unfold it, and Lord be glorified and in our midst in Jesus name we ask it. Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. It's good to be here tonight. Feel good. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God. After Sunday, powerful message Sunday. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Don't sell your birthright. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, tonight have a title, brought into another office by character and conduct. &gt;&gt; Amen. That is the title tonight. Brought into another office by character and conduct and have an inspiration inheritance. &gt;&gt; So tonight we'll talk about about inheritance. &gt;&gt; We still hooking up to the messages past even Sunday. Inheritance the rights of the firstborn. &gt;&gt; Don't sell your birthright. &gt;&gt; That's what Esau did, right? Listen to the scripture in Deuteronomy 21:15. If a man of two wives, those times they could have that one beloved and another hated, and they have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated. If the firstborn son be hers that was hated, then it shall be when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated, &gt;&gt; which is indeed the firstborn. But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn &gt;&gt; by giving him a double portion of all that he hath for he is the beginning of his strength. The right of the firstborn is his. &gt;&gt; So inheritance is the rights of the firstborn. &gt;&gt; Don't sell your birthright. &gt;&gt; That is what Esau give up. &gt;&gt; The rights &gt;&gt; is inheritance. &gt;&gt; His portion. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; So, inheritance meaning any money or property you receive from the debt of a friend or relative or as is an inheritance. Inheritance can be defined as the passing down of property, rights, titles, responsibilities or privileges from one generation to another, &gt;&gt; usually after the death of the owner. Exodus 6:8, God said, "I will bring you into the land." &gt;&gt; Concerning the which I did swear to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, and I will give it to you as a heritage. &gt;&gt; I am the Lord. &gt;&gt; So you don't work for inheritance. You are given inheritance. &gt;&gt; It is reserved in heaven spiritually. We read that for you. &gt;&gt; It's not something you earn. I want inheritance. Women inherit. No, no, no. It's already given for you. Your own is already reserved &gt;&gt; in heaven. &gt;&gt; That mean your name on that. &gt;&gt; That mean nobody could take that. &gt;&gt; It is undefiled. It's not corrupted. God has already stored that away for you already. Do you believe that tonight &gt;&gt; that you actually have an inheritance? &gt;&gt; You don't have to earn it, work for it. God just give it &gt;&gt; and you want to know it's for you. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; All right, let's go. &gt;&gt; But man, the promise watch. The promise is the baptism of the spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Which is promised through the Old Testament and the new two. &gt;&gt; Behold, I will give send the promise of my father upon you. &gt;&gt; So now he's talking about the promised land now. &gt;&gt; That is the promise. &gt;&gt; The promised land which was given as inheritance which is the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; is to live in the land of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Not some church, not some group, not some tabernacle, not some assembly. The promise is to land a land is to live in the land of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; That is God's promise for the church. &gt;&gt; Could we get amen from that? &gt;&gt; That is who? &gt;&gt; God's promise to the church. Now, you know, man interpreted that and he that is God promise. God promised that you going to live in that land. &gt;&gt; He he told a people that they say, "I give you this land. I promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and you're going to have it &gt;&gt; as a heritage, as an inheritance. That going to be your land. And when you begin to understand that by revelation, healing is yours. Deliverance is yours. Amen. Hallelujah. Revival is yours. Breakthrough, that's yours, too. Oh, glory. Joy, that is yours. Peace of mind, that is yours. That is your land. Praise God. Glory to God. Hallelujah. [Music] So that is what this revealing of the seals is about. &gt;&gt; That is what revealing the book is all about. To reveal your inheritance to reveal what you're going back to. If a child then an heir. &gt;&gt; Oh glory. If a son then an heir. We preach that your heir have to be under tutors and governors. But if you are heir yet means you have an inheritance. &gt;&gt; Oh give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. There are people in America multi-billionaire, multi-millionaire with the dead and gone. They leave it for the children and the children is rascals now but they have money &gt;&gt; inheritance &gt;&gt; because they got it as an inheritance. &gt;&gt; You can't have sex with them. Is the mother and father work 100 years ago &gt;&gt; and they leave it for their children and them leave for their children. It doesn't matter if the children doing coke, smoking, drinking, drunk. It doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; They have an inheritance &gt;&gt; and you have &gt;&gt; an inheritance. The devil is a liar tonight. Regardless of what the devil think or what the devil feel, what this one feel and that one feel, you have an inheritance. If it's one thing you must leave here tonight, you must leave here believing that you have an inheritance. You don't have to deserve it. You don't have to earn it. God, &gt;&gt; listen. The promised land is to live in the land of the Holy Spirit. That's God promise for the church is to live in the power of the spirit. It's another world. It's another land. You have to come out of the condition you have been in to come out and live in this promised land to receive the promise. Oh, praise the name of the Lord. That's not the train that spirit. That is not putting eyes bright. I'm the eye and the bride are in Trinidad and all kind of nonsense. People are to get busted out of the train spirit, out of the human spirit, out of the religious spirits. Told my wife this message is a petri dish of religious spirits. Multiplication of that's in science term not a petri mixing up and things. Oh, inheritance. Somebody has to leave you something to inherit. Is that right? An inheritance. What do we have? What inheritance do we have? I didn't have any, but God left me an inheritance. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, this is when the word come into you and challenges you to have faith to believe what this is saying here. &gt;&gt; Is that you believe this or you don't believe this or no? &gt;&gt; I didn't say this. I repeating what the tape say. &gt;&gt; God left me an inheritance &gt;&gt; when when he put my name &gt;&gt; on the lamb's book of life &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world. This have nothing to do with who your mother is, who your father is, how much you sin, how much you fall, how much you backslide, how much you will backslide, how much you're going to sin, how much it doesn't have to do with that, you know. Before the foundation of the world, when he put your name on the lamb's book of life, he have inheritance. We read it reserved for you. &gt;&gt; Could we hear a shout in the house? &gt;&gt; Peter said that. &gt;&gt; Now you say, now wait a minute, brother. Jesus did that when he died for you? No, he never. Jesus come to purchase that for me. Read the very next line. In whom we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workketh all things after the council of his own goodwill. Look, has predestinated us unto this inheritance. Predestinated means you are predetermined &gt;&gt; to get to this journey &gt;&gt; to get to this destination. &gt;&gt; If I am right inheritance of something, if God is knocking at my heart saying, William Brandon, I called you a long time ago before the foundation of the world to preach the gospel. I have an inheritance of eternal life. Now God sent Jesus. Get the bum. &gt;&gt; To make that inheritance real to me. &gt;&gt; I know you didn't get that &gt;&gt; because a fighter even think okay sperm and egg. He say there's a million sperm. How much sperms and one sperm hit one egg and that's a baby born and whatnot. He said and we just get problems to think about before the foundation of the world. You you understand what going on there now? &gt;&gt; You have to believe this. You know, this is what faith is about. You know, &gt;&gt; he said, "Watch." He said, "Uh, okay. So, God sent Jesus to to make that inheritance real to me because there was nothing I could do to inherit it." &gt;&gt; So, you are fighting yourself, your flesh, your past, your history, your memory, your life, your father, mother, all what your fault. You're fighting all of that to come to the place to believe. Amen. &gt;&gt; That God have left that inheritance for you &gt;&gt; because there's nothing you could do to inherit it. &gt;&gt; It was blank. There was nothing I can do. But in the fullness of time, God sent his own time. Jesus the lamb from the foundation of the world. His blood was shed that I might go to my inheritance &gt;&gt; to be what? What? Inheritance? To sunship? &gt;&gt; To be a son of God. So eternal life is inheritance and sunship is inheritance. As men are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. We have to go back to inheritance which is your sunship and your sunship have godship with it. Your sunship have inheritance with it. Oh give the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; This son thing is not a Trinidad sun thing. You know that's not something we talking about. You know this son is attribute sons of his spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is not your natural birth thing we talking about. You know when he says sunship, it is going back to how Adam was &gt;&gt; before the fall &gt;&gt; because Adam was a son of God in the image of God and he was a a god of the earth. &gt;&gt; Small G. &gt;&gt; And God was God of the universe. Big G, but Adam was small G. &gt;&gt; God of the earth. That was what sunship was about. He could speak to the mountain. He had power of words. He had power of fellowship. Oh, he had power over the animals. He had power over every creeping thing. When man fell, the animal bother with him &gt;&gt; because he out of order. &gt;&gt; So the animals themselves couldn't recognize man as their master anymore. When Adam sinned by heeding to his wife reasoning instead of hold on to the words of God, Adam turned loose the word and sold out. He lost also his inheritance. When he lost his fellowship and right to life because the day you eat thereof, that day you die. Here we go. When he lost his life, he lost also his inheritance in life. &gt;&gt; So with life have an inheritance. &gt;&gt; You lose your life, you lose inheritance. &gt;&gt; He was a God of the earth. God is a God of the universe everywhere. But his son had this earth under his own control. &gt;&gt; He could Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. He could speak. He was a God of the earth. Go. Right. Go. He could speak. He could name. He could say, he could stop nature. He could do anything he wanted to. When he did that, when he fell, he lost his inheritance. Adam could say, "Let this mountain be moved here. Let this tree be planted here." He had complete control as a minor God under God our father because he was a son of God. &gt;&gt; So going back to inheritance being going back under control, under dominion, under conquering, under overcoming, under what Jesus had, just think about it to meet the challenge of the hour. All them cancer and diseases. Praise God. Them sons of God was going through them things. The Bible said Jesus healed all manner of sickness. All manner of diseases. Not some, all all manner of sickness. All manner of diseases. If Jesus come back, he will do the same thing. And when the sons of God come back to their inheritance, that same thing will be done. &gt;&gt; The same power that rested in God rest in Jesus Christ. The same power to rest in Jesus Christ will rest in placed sons in the body of Christ. Sons with inheritance, not sons with talk, sons that have the walk. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. Praise God. Hallelujah. Can we give the Lord a shout? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, Adam forfeited the book of life and knowledge of Satan, lost his inheritance, lost everything, and there was no way for redemption. Then God made the likeness of men came down and become a redeemer to redeem us. And John heard the announcement. He come to make claims. No man in heaven, no man under the earth. That's where the book come now. That's why all this thing coming here. No man in heaven. Because it it have to do with inheritance. It have to do with sunship. It have to do with possession. People say, "What about them seals?" And the seed is a mysterious thing. No, it's not a mysterious thing. You know, in that way, you know, it's about the title deed of the earth. It's what we had in the beginning. It's what was making sons in the beginning. That is what Adam lost. Satan couldn't hold that deed. So it went back in the hands of original owner waiting for redemption claims, waiting for redeemer. So Jesus didn't die just to save us. He died to get the book. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. Did you get that? Now Jesus didn't just die how the Pentecostals and the rest of the church will see it. But the reality is this. He died to get the book. &gt;&gt; Because once the book is restored and the book had to be brought down to the earth, the book went up into heaven. But Revelation 10 said, "I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven and the book was open. He come to bring it on the earth to show that the book is be restored. Sunship is be restored. Inheritance is be restored." Because when the lamb took the book, &gt;&gt; the first thing John said was what? We shall reign on the earth. We couldn't reign without the book. [Music] Do you catch &gt;&gt; that? Sickness have a beginning. &gt;&gt; Sex have an ending. &gt;&gt; Everything had a beginning. Have to have an ending. &gt;&gt; Disease and all what Satan have to do and have a be have an ending. &gt;&gt; So we not here just to kill time. &gt;&gt; The whole creation is waiting for this birth where sons of God will be born into manifestation. Do you understand that God was waiting for the capstone time, headstone time, fullness of the Godhead, fullness of time to produce the sons of God? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's continue. &gt;&gt; Watch. No chance of redemption. Everything failed. Then he had the land and tribe of Judah prevail and overcome and conquered. No one in heaven under the earth was willing to open a book because if that book was not taken out of the hand of original owner would have been lost and went back after the forfeiture right we couldn't get our promises what couldn't have forfeit the rights of the word the promises and the inheritance &gt;&gt; so getting back the book means a restoration of our promises &gt;&gt; and our inheritance &gt;&gt; oh how we have to praise God tonight listen to this it was a lamb redeemer a lamb redeemer the first redeemer was a lamb in the garden of Eden it was a lamb that God offered and he had come again plumbing in revelation. A lamb to redeem what? Redeem what? Fallen the fallen condition and the fallen inheritance of a fallen race of people. A lamb come to redeem back like ours was in the beginning to to redeem what what was he going to redeem? Why this word redemption? What he was going to redeem? Anything that has been redeemed is something that have been lost. &gt;&gt; Is something that have been lost has been brought back again. What does he bring back to us this lamb? Everything we had at the beginning. &gt;&gt; Shout out everything. &gt;&gt; Everything. &gt;&gt; So this redemption brings back everything. &gt;&gt; That is why Abraham said if this tree put forth another &gt;&gt; original branch, it will produce another day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Not message churches, another day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; This church thing is a means to an end. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Let me say it again. This church thing is a means to an end. This is not the end game. God prod have have to reproduce the original seed &gt;&gt; which was on the day of Pentecost. And that original seed produced another book of acts. What was the book of acts? The acts of the holy ghost among god's people. &gt;&gt; Not the acts that the preachers giving exhortation and preaching. Something seem to be going off. &gt;&gt; Oh praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Everything. What did we have at the beginning? Eternal life. &gt;&gt; We were hes. We had life. We never had to die. We never had to be sick. We never had to get old. We never had any worries. There was no funerals, no graves, no evil, no death, no gray hair, no stoop shoulders, no mourning, no crying. We had life eternal. We had a jurisdiction over the earth. Hallelujah. So where eternal life had dominion, &gt;&gt; had authority. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. When Jesus speak, you know what they said? Never a man spake like that man because he spoke with one having authority because he was the book itself. Okay the Lord I shout in the house. Hallelujah. With the book comes authority. I take every spirit under my control for the glory of God. You heard William Brandham say that. What did he do? He took authority. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Every demon know that the whole of heaven was behind him. Oh give the Lord some praises in the house. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And one of these days, every devil will know the whole of heaven is behind you &gt;&gt; because the angel of the Lord encamp around them that fear him. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. You're going to come into power. You're going to come into possession and you're going to come into your inheritance. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; This Bible is a beautiful book. Amen. &gt;&gt; So even though you talk about inheritance, remember what we read when I preach about two sons back that a son if he's a child though he's a heir, &gt;&gt; you can't tell the child go and take the land and take the car and take this and drive and whatn not. So a father leave back a car for the child as inheritance. 6 years old, 7 years old, he go and start the car to drive, go and kill himself. The child is under tutors and governance until &gt;&gt; until he's mature enough &gt;&gt; to deal with the responsibilities of inheritance &gt;&gt; or the business. &gt;&gt; Do you get it? So if in the natural world they have this why must God break his own law and do like if he's not I mean not even a business person will allow somebody tell me that the Syrians and and they with all these clothes some of them these children they start to learn to to the the roles are cloth from from the containers. &gt;&gt; They're not dropping them behind the cash register to the boss and CEO. No. So the children will know the work from the bottom up. Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; Nobody can say, "Oh, that's not my job. I'm not going to carry no clothes." That how they making all the money &gt;&gt; from the container. &gt;&gt; And then putting people can buy how to cut the cloth and they know every part of the job. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So when you complain, they know what what you're complaining about if if it's serious. &gt;&gt; Because that is the training. &gt;&gt; No, every son might want to take that. They always had the Rascals one, the Judas one, all kind of characters and sons. &gt;&gt; And the same thing in God's program too. And you're going to find out today the title why we call it brought into another office by character and conduct. &gt;&gt; It's not the same words. &gt;&gt; Character and conduct. Character is who you are. Conduct is how you behave. &gt;&gt; Character is internal. Conduct is external. &gt;&gt; Character is what God see. &gt;&gt; Conduct is what the people see. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Character is like the root &gt;&gt; and conduct is like the fruit. &gt;&gt; Your conduct reveals your character. &gt;&gt; Or we can say this way, your behavior reveals who you are. &gt;&gt; Oh my. So nature is groaning for the sons of God to be manifested. I skipped down because nature was cursed with his master. When his master was cursed the highest then nature fell with the master. But when this kinsman redeemer come and redeem back the man that was master over nature then all nature is waiting for the man master. &gt;&gt; Now that child here we go in the old testament he never had any inheritance. Why the father couldn't trust him with anything? What kind of fellow would he be? But he couldn't trust him. He's always a son, but he never had any inheritance. And if you don't watch Pentecostal church, there's going to be a lot of no inheritance. Notice in the Old Testament now, this boy when he is born into a family, the first thing the father did when he got old enough, he said, "We thought he born into the family, he had no inheritance yet." Here the part I want to get to. But he had to find out what kind of person that's going to be before he has an inheritance. &gt;&gt; So that's my child. You having this, you having that? No, not not not like that. I want to know &gt;&gt; what kind of person this is here. &gt;&gt; So then you put time on that. &gt;&gt; Jesus was starring age 12. Knowing not about my father's business, God put 18 years on that. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; 18 and 12. &gt;&gt; He cannot go to advance and university. You know, he was a bright guy. &gt;&gt; But God make sure he had 18 years of silence. &gt;&gt; 18 years under Joseph &gt;&gt; in the carpenter shop. &gt;&gt; 18 years listening to the scribe and Pharisees misinterpreting scripture. &gt;&gt; And he couldn't say nothing. He couldn't say liar. make havoc in the church and mash up. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; False shock. Jesus. Jesus. Good. He had to keep quiet. &gt;&gt; He had all the false interpretation, false revelation, false inspiration, no inspiration, no anointing, half dead men &gt;&gt; and he had to wait &gt;&gt; until the time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God loosed John the Baptist sign forunner. Jesus knew because the scripture talk about behold I send my messenger before my face. &gt;&gt; He knew John was coming. &gt;&gt; He still had to wait &gt;&gt; until God tell him stand up in line. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he is in line like everybody else. He saying you know you who I am supposed to be in front. &gt;&gt; What behavior is that? &gt;&gt; What what conduct is that? &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; He didn't push himself. He stand up in line and John baptizing baptizing when Jesus he said my goodness you should baptize me. You see what going on there now? &gt;&gt; He said that is so but it behooves us to fulfill all righteousness. &gt;&gt; Oh Messiah is on the earth now. Nobody knows but John. Oh give the Lord a shout. Hallelujah. Nobody know but John because God tell John the one that you see that dove rest upon &gt;&gt; and remain &gt;&gt; and remain. Don't forget that part you like that the most important part you know because dove does land and bust it you know land and take off you know cuz the dove thinking is some lamb wolf wolf wolf roof roof wolf wolf and as the dove land like that imagine God looking for a lamb preacher when he think is a lamb preacher he us say you do them so it pull like a cat &gt;&gt; he said do them the other way &gt;&gt; do them this way &gt;&gt; I want do this way that when he grow that when he grow come out &gt;&gt; dove take off. So when that dove remain on Jesus, he knew that was the lamb. &gt;&gt; Behold the lamb of God. &gt;&gt; Jesus come now and Jesus going to heal the sick, raise the dead, cast out devils on his way to Calvary, &gt;&gt; on his way to present the blood price to purchase us &gt;&gt; as a possession. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are like his inheritance. He purchased you with his own blood. &gt;&gt; He's not going to lose you. All that the father hath given me will come. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So nobody can put you out the kingdom. &gt;&gt; They could put you out with their mouth, but they can put you out the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; All right, let's go. &gt;&gt; Now watch. Now, if someone or some individual lost their inheritance that was given to them by God, there come a year called the Jubilee year. &gt;&gt; Every seven years a Sabbath. Every seven days they had a Sabbath. Every seven years they had a Sabbath. And seventh Sabbath was 49 years. And the 50th year was a jubilee. And in this jubilee, every man that had lost an inheritance by some means. He was freeborn through blood of Israelite. No matter who held the possession, it had to go back to him &gt;&gt; because God set us up this way. &gt;&gt; They could keep it for so long and no more. &gt;&gt; That devil could keep it for so long and no more. He has to loose you and let you go. He has to put his hands off of you. When you hear that Jubilee trumpet, when you hear that freedom road, hallelujah, that devil have to pack up, give up, let go. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Without this revelation, you wouldn't know you could go free. So the revealing of the seals, the revealing of the book, the real of the mystery reveals to you your inheritance that you could know what you have to go and possess. Oh, glory to God. So you wouldn't just sit and steer. You would worship and give God praise &gt;&gt; and begin to make your claims. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Note what that chat person cry who is worthy to take the book. &gt;&gt; Not as faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Note the words. &gt;&gt; But Abraham said when the lamb took the book, I like that. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He was saying, "I claim them." &gt;&gt; He was taking it to claim it. Not for himself, &gt;&gt; but for his people. &gt;&gt; Not for himself, but for you and I. I claim them. They are mines. Oh, glory to God. Give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; The lamb did that. The lamb had to claim it. What do you think you have to do? I claim my son. I claim my daughter. I claim my health. I claim restoration. I claim a revival. You have to open your mouth and make your claim. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Do I have a shout in the house tonight? &gt;&gt; You cannot claim what is not yours. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. There's enough to shout tonight. That's why the revelation reveals what is yours. You said this is mine. My father left it for me. No squatter is going to be on my land. This is my land. [Music] Watch this. In this jubilee, every man that had lost his inheritance by some means, if he was freeborn, no matter who held the possession, it had to go back to him free. &gt;&gt; He didn't have to pay a thing. &gt;&gt; He didn't have to do a thing. just stop what he was doing and go back to inheritance. &gt;&gt; And listen, &gt;&gt; this is a big one. &gt;&gt; He had a right to it. [Music] &gt;&gt; It was a Godgiven right. &gt;&gt; Write with me. &gt;&gt; Because he by grace had inherited it. &gt;&gt; Not by works, &gt;&gt; by grace. &gt;&gt; And it would have been given to his fathers, handed down year upon after year. No matter what taking place, if he lost it, it must go free. &gt;&gt; It meant grace is way provided for each individual to return to their rightful inheritance. &gt;&gt; What a picture it gives tonight of the church in this last day. You see what man can do and then you see what God does. What man does is failing and will fail has failed. Always will fail. But what God does is eternal and must forever remain. Nothing can ever take its place. God give it. It's a free gift by sovereign foresight. He saw it and placed it and there is nothing could move it. It is there eternally. And at Jubilee was God's manner of expressing grace to his people for restoring what he brought them back to their rightful position. &gt;&gt; That's why he said if the power is to come among the people, it wouldn't even be their prayers. It will be the grace of God. That don't mean you will stop praying. Oh, give the Lord some praises tonight. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Glory to God. Glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's go. &gt;&gt; But God is trying to place his church in position &gt;&gt; to manifest himself. &gt;&gt; Not to say we right others wrong. We have it. That that church will have it. And you know, everybody else kind of foolishness that come out minister's mouth. bringing division and bringing a set of nasty disrespectful attitudes among believers thinking that they're superior to other churches. Bunch of nonsense. Every church have three kinds. &gt;&gt; They're doing like they only have one kind. Oh, give the Lord some praises. He said in the church you find good, bad, and renegades. Who said that? The prophet said that. &gt;&gt; And now you're changing that. You're still on the same page. You can read it over and over and over. He said the Holy Ghost is poured out on individuals. When you see that, you could tell yourself that is for me tonight. &gt;&gt; That mean I can receive the Holy Ghost tonight. I had to I don't have to wait for sister dum dum or sister dry up or sister no praise or no praise brother. Oh praise God. I don't wait for nobody dead as a doornail. I don't have to wait for who behind me who in front of me. The Holy Ghost is poured individual and I'm an individual in good. That mean God can pour it on me tonight. [Music] &gt;&gt; If you don't want it, I'm taking it. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises tonight. certainly not this certain not the trinity gospel right all right so God is trying to place the church in position what for to boast &gt;&gt; to be proud &gt;&gt; to post on Instagram and and and social media no the church in a position to manifest himself &gt;&gt; not for ministers to parade their beef for Christ to manifest himself. &gt;&gt; Watch. Getting one that he could work through like this and say, "There is my spirit &gt;&gt; flowing freely." &gt;&gt; Not the minister's mouth ringing. There is my spirit &gt;&gt; flowing freely. &gt;&gt; I can work here. Get another one and place him. I can place him. Adoption placing manifesting. Take him in out there and put a ceremony. Visit him with an angel. Tell him something. [Music] If he making up something, it won't work. &gt;&gt; You see, there are a lot of them have that. I mean manifestation of sons of God. When God manifests himself and he sends him out or when he goes forth, what he says is truth. What he does is the truth. What he does, he manifests Christ. &gt;&gt; How do you judge him? &gt;&gt; By the way he stays with the word. But if the people not trained with the word, they judge them by the pink glasses the ministers put on their eyes before they get out the church. &gt;&gt; When they when the deacons or whoever else fit them with them glasses, everybody see pink, you know &gt;&gt; because the glasses is pink. &gt;&gt; How do you judge him? By the way, he stays &gt;&gt; with the word. &gt;&gt; All right. So let's go a little bit down to this character and conduct. Character is a person on the inside. It's a sum of one's moral qualities, values, integrity, honesty, &gt;&gt; and inner disposition. &gt;&gt; Character have to do with the heart, &gt;&gt; motives, &gt;&gt; objectives. &gt;&gt; One time some minister said, brother Brandham, he says there's oil somewhere there. I said, brother, when we get that, we'll serve the Lord. We'll pay for this and that and the other. Bra say don't use the gift for commercial thing but somebody some one of them went down there they get a little dripping of oil and afterwards they going the selfish mode and all that or what all they say with their mouth they change &gt;&gt; and they didn't realize it's a little vain they get and to confirm what the prophet saw somebody else come and get the real thing &gt;&gt; so God has watched people motive &gt;&gt; an objective &gt;&gt; isn't that right &gt;&gt; praise God Job Bible say there was a man in the land of Oz whose I don't know how to pronounce it whose name was Job and that man was perfect and upright one that feared God and isued evil. &gt;&gt; That's speaking to the character of the man. &gt;&gt; Daniel 18 but Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portions of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank. Therefore, he requested of the prince of the unox that he might not defile &gt;&gt; himself. &gt;&gt; That determines the kind of character &gt;&gt; that's in the man. In other words, character is what you are when nobody else is around. &gt;&gt; Conduct. Conduct is what somebody does outwardly. &gt;&gt; An expression of behavior, &gt;&gt; action and choices in life. Conduct is a demonstrations of one's character. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Job 1:22. In all this job sin not nor charged God foolishly. &gt;&gt; So Job character and behavior was lining up. &gt;&gt; It was in alignment. &gt;&gt; 1st Samuel 18:14 says, "And David behaved himself wisely &gt;&gt; in all his ways, &gt;&gt; and the Lord was with him. So the character is the inner man, &gt;&gt; what you really are &gt;&gt; and your conduct or behavior is what others will see what is reflected and so on. &gt;&gt; Now the Pharisees had a different thing. &gt;&gt; Jesus said you are like whited sea fulkers which indeed appear beautiful outward &gt;&gt; but within full of dead men's bone. &gt;&gt; So their conduct and their character was two different kind of things. &gt;&gt; They're saying something and living something else. Pharisee. We see it. Character shapes conduct. Conduct reveals character. &gt;&gt; Not always. The hypocrites could always put on an Oscar award in their behavior. Different character. &gt;&gt; In Colossians 3, this is both character and conduct. How Paul speaks here. In Colossians 3:12-13 says, "Put on therefore the elect of God, holy beloved, Paul speaks bubbles of mercies, &gt;&gt; that's inside, &gt;&gt; kindness, that's inside. Humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering, you don't see those things." &gt;&gt; Then he comes after and said, "Forbearing one another, that is a display to others. And forgiving one another, &gt;&gt; that is to others. If any man have a quarrel against any, as Christ forgive you, so do ye. So this thing about forgiveness and forbearing is demonstrated Christianity &gt;&gt; based upon what is on the inside. &gt;&gt; Character is who you are before God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So brother Brandham, he said this, the burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi. I have loved you say the Lord. Yet you say, wherein hast thou love us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother? sayeth the Lord. Yet I love Jacob. &gt;&gt; I hated Esau &gt;&gt; and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness. You see, they could not figure out God's love. &gt;&gt; They thought that love meant no suffering. &gt;&gt; They thought that love meant a baby with parental care. But God said his love was elective love. &gt;&gt; The proof of his love was election. And no matter what happened, his love was truly proven by the fact they were chosen under salvation. Because God had chosen you to salvation, through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth. &gt;&gt; He may commit you to death as he did Paul. He may commit you to suffering as he did Job. That is his prerogative. He is sovereign, but is all with a purpose. &gt;&gt; If he did not have a purpose, then he would be the author of frustration and not peace. His purpose is that after we have suffered a while, &gt;&gt; we would be made perfect, &gt;&gt; be established, strengthened, settled. As Job said, he put his strength in us. &gt;&gt; You see, he himself, talking about Jesus, suffered. &gt;&gt; He learned obedience by the things that he suffered. He was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered. And then he quoted Hebrews 5:8. Though he was a son, yet learning obedience by the things that he suffered. and being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are we ready? Now, &gt;&gt; in plain language, the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering. &gt;&gt; And according to Paul, he has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in God while suffering with for him would come to a place &gt;&gt; of perfection. &gt;&gt; Question, why did he want this? Answer James 1 2 and 4. My brethren, count it all joy &gt;&gt; when you fall into temptation. That is that revelation right there. Knowing this that the trying of your faith work at patience. &gt;&gt; So God has frustrated those who hurry, who anxious, who feel that they're supposed to have it right away and they want to lock God neck and pack with God. He said the try and ref work with patience and let patience have a perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing. &gt;&gt; Why does he stand by? The reason is this. Romans 8. If children then hes the scripture I read tonight. &gt;&gt; Hairs joints with Christ if so that we suffer with him that we may be glorified together. &gt;&gt; So you see how this thing I the bride and think is it does it fit in here tonight like that? like it was a carnival man just chipping down the road going to the rapture it working no not carnival anymore for I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall reveal in us &gt;&gt; unless we suffer with him &gt;&gt; we cannot reign with him &gt;&gt; you have to suffer to reign &gt;&gt; the reason for this is character which is the inner part &gt;&gt; which is the inside part which is the part people can't see with their Guys, character simply is never made without suffering. &gt;&gt; Wake up inside of here. &gt;&gt; Wake up, church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Wake up, bride of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. There's no other way. Shaking the pastor hand. Singing specials don't give character. Writing message songs don't give character. Preaching night sermons don't give character. Coming to church don't give character. Sitting on the events don't give character. Saying amen don't give character. Suffering brings character. Pain br character. Oh God, don't get me started tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are reach. We are reach. There's only 12 pages. I reach eight. So we just have four more again. &gt;&gt; I said narrow the pages when I come out Wednesday night. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Isn't this sweet tonight? &gt;&gt; This is sweet gospel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. People don't like to hear about cross, debt, death of a corner wheat, dying out, debt to self, uh, giving up their own ideas, giving they don't want to hear that. &gt;&gt; They want to say you are this, you will unveil God, you are perfect, you are all kind of thing like them like all them modern people have been speaking them new age speaking this thing. What the affirmation thing I am strong um, I'm strong, I'm good, I'm right, I'm this, I'm healthy, I'm this. that that that has nothing to do with the Bible. &gt;&gt; So watch a man without character can't reign because power apart from character is satanic. &gt;&gt; But power with character is fit to rule. And since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and is set down in his father's throne, then we have to overcome to set with him and the little temporary suffering. &gt;&gt; What you're going through is not permanent. Though God man the little temporary suffering we go through is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous glory that will be revealed in us when he comes. What treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation. Think it not strange concerning the fiery trial that comes to try you. That is what Peter said. Isn't it strange? Here we go. That God wants us to develop a Christlike character that comes through suffering. We have we all have trials. We all are tried and chasened as sons. Not one but goes through that. The church that is not suffering is not being tried hasn't isn't of God. &gt;&gt; Who and he quotes Hebrews 12:6. For though for whom the Lord loveth, he chasen it. &gt;&gt; Jacob I love licks. You know &gt;&gt; when Jacob thinking he getting one bride he had to work on XM years again. Yeah. &gt;&gt; God God gave him a run for your money. &gt;&gt; For whom the Lord loveth, he chastenth it and scorcheth every son whom he receiveth. But if ye are without chastisement whereof all are partakers, then you are bastard and not sons. Now this special condition in Smyrna must be applied to every age. There's no age free from it. There's no true believer free from it. This is of God. This is the will of God. It is needful and we need the Lord to teach us the truth that we are to suffer and be Christlike in doing it. &gt;&gt; Love suffering long and is kind. &gt;&gt; Now, this is where we get the title from. Are we going to close? All right. Notice when the child is born, he was a son. You ready? &gt;&gt; But his conduct had to do with his inheritance. Not the sermon, &gt;&gt; not his gift. &gt;&gt; Now I want to be real honest now. Don't you think that we have tried to push the inheritance just a little further than God our conduct went? What's the matter today? We should be way up down the road yonder, but we are way down here. It's been our conduct. &gt;&gt; We have no respect. &gt;&gt; And you know, brother George is here from Kaiwa. I always say want our church to know by two things. bright love and respects. &gt;&gt; My scare was this bunch of disrespectful trainard spirit God will judge it. &gt;&gt; People get killing this message for the disrespects and over the years I've seen it. And one thing I wanted to get the group to be is under bly kindness and respects not even knowing that a revision broadcast was going to break &gt;&gt; but I was concerned and I didn't want the people to be saying this and saying that that's why we don't come and talk to Banal and confusion things here because I want you to have the right attitude. say our man bad. So you are still a son and daughter but you are So you are still a son and daughter but you are living under your privilege and your conduct each day as the Holy Spirit brings it before the father gives away the things that you do. You're still a son and daughter but you never brought to the place that you should be. &gt;&gt; Great gifts that are in the church are so misused. No reverence to it. Just a bunch of carrying on. I'll skip quickly. Sometime ministers Oh, I skip that. Notice the tutor brought the message to the father and said the child is progressing right or wrong. No matter what the outside people had to say about this child, what the servants or the farmer had to say, he tried to work every way to please the father. And no matter what the world has to say about you, here we go. Come on, bride. Work to please God. &gt;&gt; Do everything to build the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Don't never separate it. Build it together. Don't never divide it by denominational barriers. Don't do those things. Watch. Don't let those little things that man put into the church ever separate brotherhood because you are Methodist. Shake hands with the Baptist because you're Presbyterian. Shake hand with the Pentecostals. We are brethren. Don't let little barb wires barriers separate you from fellowship of the saints of the living God who are brethren in precious faith. If they don't know how much watch if they don't know how just how much you feel then you pray for them &gt;&gt; and associate with them &gt;&gt; and fellowship with them &gt;&gt; and God will spread his love abroad &gt;&gt; into their hearts. Oh, praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Notice when the son had come to a place of accountability say 21 we call it today. If the tutor had brought a word to the father and told him everything was fine, almost done, and he done all he could do to improve and better the kingdom, then this boy had we called the placing of the son. The father taken him out in a public place, set him up before the public. The same son that have been born in the home years ago all the time his son, but his character &gt;&gt; and his conduct has brought him &gt;&gt; to another office. &gt;&gt; That is where I get the title from. Not just sons &gt;&gt; in the message &gt;&gt; but character &gt;&gt; and conduct. &gt;&gt; You see where the virtues come in now? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You see why Baram said this being &gt;&gt; when it's completed &gt;&gt; is the servant of God &gt;&gt; in the church of God &gt;&gt; that's going in the rapture. Amen. &gt;&gt; He never said this sermon, this message, this mystery, this revelation, this unfolding of the word. He never said that. &gt;&gt; He said this being &gt;&gt; when it's completed &gt;&gt; is the servant of God &gt;&gt; in the church of God &gt;&gt; that's going in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Then he said, I hope you see it. Music come, please. Our character should have us up into a place where we can be in an office to meet the crisis of the hour &gt;&gt; that we are in. &gt;&gt; I know I never read this before. &gt;&gt; I know this. This is fresh. This is new. But is it is the word. I'll read it again. Our characters should have us up into a place &gt;&gt; where we can be in an office &gt;&gt; to meet the crisis of this hour &gt;&gt; that we are in. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; What a shame we are. But will God answer in a time of crisis? He will not only answer but he will make manifest in the time of crisis. &gt;&gt; No matter if there's two or three. Notice the tutor brought the message and the father finally take the son to the place where he has to be manifested. &gt;&gt; It is time. There's a bomb here for the church today to be manifested. &gt;&gt; If the other fellow draw the line, you just live right along this line. &gt;&gt; You be the salt. &gt;&gt; And God will make him thirsty &gt;&gt; if you be the salt. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we see the father come and roe the son and then have a public ceremony with the rights. In other words, his name is on the check just as good as the father. &gt;&gt; And this is a closing here. Now page 11, we find in this last day in our organization of Pentecost, we have come in and organized ourselves and rejected the leadership of the Holy Spirit by the wisdom of some groups of people. instead of having fellowship one with another is divided and separate into several different groups. Skip now. Now a man and woman and his family could go back to their original inheritance if they could hear the Jubilee trumpet song. We haven't walled ourselves away from it so far as we could hear what somebody say instead of thus say the Lord is. He said come back to the original inheritance to the real Holy Ghost again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Listen, I'm close with this thing. There is no such thing as joining the church. &gt;&gt; There is no word for it in the Bible. You cannot join the church. The church is the mystical body of Jesus Christ. And you got to be born into it by the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Let's all stand and give God some praises. Father, we bless you tonight. We thank you for your truth. Another office by character and conduct. May the people see it in Jesus name I ask it. Amen and amen. God bless you. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, give him praise tonight. Give him glory. Hallelujah.
