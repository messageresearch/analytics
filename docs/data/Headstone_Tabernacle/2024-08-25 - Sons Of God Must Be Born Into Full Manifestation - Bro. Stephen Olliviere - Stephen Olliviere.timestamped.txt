[1:00:09] calleth not who was
[1:00:11] Holier but Jacob I loved Esau I hated

[1:00:38] praise give him praise yes Lord Glory
[1:00:41] yes Lord Jesus thank you
[1:00:44] Lord but the purpose of God Must
[1:00:49] Stand amen what is this purpose of
[1:00:53] God from the message SP Manan Church age
[1:00:57] but says you can't read it any other
[1:01:00] way the hard
[1:01:02] purpose the Eternal purpose of God was
[1:01:06] to take a bride of his own
[1:01:09] choosing Hallelujah and that purpose was
[1:01:13] in himself and being Eternal was decreed
[1:01:17] before the foundation of the world say
[1:01:21] Amen so the heart purpose of God was to
[1:01:25] take a bride of his own chosen
[1:01:27] hallelujah amen amen amen amen
[1:01:32] glory so from that same message he said
[1:01:34] the thoughts of God are Eternal they are
[1:01:38] real he says down through the centuries
[1:01:42] we find Moses and Jeremiah and John the
[1:01:44] Baptist notice each one of these was
[1:01:48] God's Eternal thought expressed in its
[1:01:52] season
[1:01:54] amen then we came to Jesus the logos he
[1:01:58] was the perfect and complete thought
[1:02:00] expressed and he became known as the
[1:02:03] word of God can we say amen hallelujah
[1:02:07] hallelujah he says he has chosen Us in
[1:02:10] him before the foundation of the world
[1:02:14] Amen and we were right there with him in
[1:02:17] his mind thoughts of God before the
[1:02:21] foundation of the world Amen brother
[1:02:23] brah said this gives an eternal quality
[1:02:26] to the elect Oh Glory you are the elect
[1:02:29] this morning this gives an eternal
[1:02:31] quality to the elect my my amen amen so
[1:02:36] we are not from this world we are
[1:02:38] pilgrims and strangers passing through
[1:02:40] this world we come from God and we are
[1:02:42] going back to God this world this Cosmos
[1:02:46] world this world system is not our home
[1:02:50] we don't belong here give the Lord a
[1:02:52] shout this morning we don't belong to
[1:02:54] this world Amen
[1:02:56] hallelujah hallelujah another way to say
[1:03:00] it from the Ephesians Church age the
[1:03:03] word most definitely sets forth that
[1:03:06] before the foundation of the Earth the
[1:03:09] purpose of God was to share his eternal
[1:03:12] life with man
[1:03:15] Hallelujah so man was not supposed to
[1:03:19] die man was supposed to live forever
[1:03:23] amen hallelujah praise God I want to
[1:03:26] impress upon you that we are called unto
[1:03:29] eternal life the Abundant Life don't
[1:03:33] settle for this carnal life of Le oia

[1:03:39] age a bride Age come up here this

[1:04:07] has got to get in that condition to
[1:04:10] receive the headstone then take the
[1:04:13] whole thing in the resurrection when the

[1:08:21] God Amen that thought of you so you were
[1:08:25] you were in God that thought of you and
[1:08:28] expressed you and he made an earth to
[1:08:30] take you out of and to make you a human
[1:08:33] being
[1:08:35] amen he says sin came along and
[1:08:38] perverted his way but you came anyhow
[1:08:42] but you were lost with the world
[1:08:45] my so in Genesis in the beginning now
[1:08:49] God created the Earth and all its
[1:08:51] beautiful
[1:08:52] creations and he put man in the garden
[1:08:56] as Master of the earth Hallelujah god of

[1:09:00] man he was something on the order of God

[1:09:10] man jurisdiction over the Earth amen the
[1:09:15] Earth was man's
[1:09:16] domain he could speak and it was so he
[1:09:20] could say Let There be and it was so he
[1:09:23] had spoken word power amen glory amen
[1:09:28] and great big papa God said this is my

[1:11:05] sickness and sorrow and

[1:11:12] was supposed to live forever on this
[1:11:16] earth oh yes

[2:12:59] [Music]
[2:13:01] my it up
[2:13:05] and
[2:13:08] me praise the Lord what a masterpiece
[2:13:11] this
[2:13:12] morning what a
[2:13:14] blessing rece and God bless you
[2:13:16] certainly
[2:13:17] appreciate oh being used and yal himself
[2:13:20] to the the spirit the spirit could speak
[2:13:23] to us sons of God to be born into full
[2:13:28] manifestation and you know there was
[2:13:30] something that was kind of riding me up
[2:13:31] on my heart and normally we talk about
[2:13:34] there's two Spirits God's Spirit and
[2:13:36] Holy Spirit but I wrote something down
[2:13:40] about what is in between and in between
[2:13:43] is the human
[2:13:45] spirit and that's why God talk about
[2:13:47] those false prophets that speak from
[2:13:49] their own spirit from their own inner
[2:13:53] spirit and and that there lies the
[2:13:55] problem
[2:13:57] because because as humans God give us
[2:14:02] choices and choic is a beautiful thing
[2:14:05] in the Garden of Eden God to eat
[2:14:07] everything but that tree in the mid
[2:14:08] don't touch it and man choose to touch
[2:14:11] that tree and and man
[2:14:13] fell God will not take away your
[2:14:18] choice God will not force you to be a
[2:14:20] Christian
[2:14:21] forc you to serve him force you to
[2:14:24] submit yourself you have to choose to
[2:14:27] submit you have to choose to humble
[2:14:29] yourself if you don't like but Steven
[2:14:32] was so much of so much golden nuggets
[2:14:34] this morning and I recognize now why God
[2:14:37] kept it in a mystery because a mystery
[2:14:40] has to be revealed and unfolded and for
[2:14:42] him to reveal it it has to be his Spirit
[2:14:45] given Revelation the devil can't get
[2:14:48] that so the devil could never get the
[2:14:50] mystery of God that is reserve and
[2:14:53] reveal for his
[2:14:56] sons now this Earth wasn't created for
[2:14:59] the devil this Earth was created for us
[2:15:02] because we were what made him Jehovah
[2:15:05] because he had no attributes he had no
[2:15:07] children so he wanted to have a contact
[2:15:10] so he formed man to have children that
[2:15:13] he could express his love to express his
[2:15:15] word to that's why we end up in
[2:15:17] parenting that we could actually reflect
[2:15:19] what God reflected in the beginning
[2:15:22] having Sons and Daughters now because
[2:15:24] man fell God still purpose to redeem man
[2:15:27] according to what brother Stephen say
[2:15:29] that was his intent and purpose so he
[2:15:31] purposed through Christ to come back and
[2:15:32] bring back the book bring back the deed
[2:15:34] bring back the authority bring back the
[2:15:36] blood bring back all of that because we
[2:15:38] couldn't help ourselves we couldn't pull
[2:15:40] ourselves out we couldn't deliver
[2:15:41] ourselves we couldn't redeem ourselves
[2:15:43] so he had to do
[2:15:44] everything and he do did that and say
[2:15:47] you have to choose and accept that it is
[2:15:50] always your chth choice is because thou
[2:15:52] has chosen it is still your choice this
[2:15:55] day to serve him to love him it's still
[2:15:57] your choice to love your wife it's still
[2:15:59] your choice to respect your husband it's
[2:16:01] still your
[2:16:05] choice what is parenting about parenting
[2:16:09] is to bring a child to maturity and for
[2:16:12] this cause shall a man leave his mother
[2:16:14] and father not bring his mother and
[2:16:15] father with him not bring his mother
[2:16:17] with him leave his mother and father and
[2:16:19] C unto his wife no mother is supposed to
[2:16:21] be interfer with no son business in his
[2:16:23] marriage that is foolishness God never
[2:16:25] ordained that God never set that up
[2:16:28] shall this cause a man leave his mother
[2:16:30] when he leave his mother he's supposed
[2:16:31] to be a big man he's supposed to be
[2:16:33] adult man he's supposed to be a mature
[2:16:35] man to stand on his own that's how God
[2:16:37] loves it not us as helicopter parents
[2:16:40] hovering over our children hovering
[2:16:41] hovering your
[2:16:42] [Music]
[2:16:43] helicopter God want our hands off his
[2:16:47] business God want to set up his son and
[2:16:49] say That's my boy look at him oh my he's
[2:16:51] a chip of the old block this is what God
[2:16:54] wants
[2:16:55] amen but what I want to get you is this
[2:16:57] that human spirit is what have to get
[2:16:59] subjection to the word you have to want
[2:17:03] the word to be over
[2:17:05] you that your life is governed by the
[2:17:09] word itself I'm closing with
[2:17:14] this this is uh Deuteronomy

[2:42:35] to have one service this coming Sunday
[2:42:38] and this Sunday we want it to be taken
[2:42:40] very seriously it's an important day I
[2:42:43] believe that it's going to be September
[2:42:45] the 1st it's the beginning of a week the
[2:42:47] beginning of a month Mon it's also the
[2:42:49] beginning of a new school year which
[2:42:53] marks quite a number of different things
[2:42:55] as you know our convention comes after
[2:42:57] the school year is over in July so we
[2:42:59] want to have a special service this
[2:43:01] coming Sunday just one service and we
[2:43:03] really want to encourage the entire
[2:43:05] church to be present and especially
[2:43:07] those that will be going out to school
[2:43:09] in this new school year whether it's
[2:43:11] Primary School Secondary School
[2:43:13] University whatever it might be both uh
[2:43:16] the students the teachers you want to
[2:43:19] have a special time of prayer for those
[2:43:23] that are going out to school in this new
[2:43:25] school year you don't have to
[2:43:29] be you don't have to to to to be an
[2:43:32] intellectual or somebody who is to to
[2:43:34] see how bad things are
[2:43:36] becoming and how the world is changing
[2:43:38] so we want to fortify our people with
[2:43:41] prayer we don't want them to go out
[2:43:43] there and walk as if it was a year ago
[2:43:45] or two years ago or 3 years ago or the
[2:43:48] lid of hell is on covered the level of
[2:43:50] things you're seeing now has never been
[2:43:51] seen before and we want to be able to
[2:43:54] cover our homes and our families with
[2:43:56] the blood brother B said apply the token
[2:43:59] over your home apply the token over your
[2:44:01] family so we want to apply the token on
[2:44:03] all of the students who are going out of
[2:44:05] school and certainly we know with the
[2:44:07] school term opening the traffic and
[2:44:09] everything changes there just a lot of
[2:44:10] things and I wanted to see it not just
[2:44:12] as a natural thing because we wrestle
[2:44:14] not against flesh and blood but
[2:44:16] principalities and powers and spiritual
[2:44:18] wickedness in places so I want to
[2:44:20] encourage you make every effort to be
[2:44:22] here in the house of the Lord next
[2:44:24] Sunday and make sure and bring all of
[2:44:26] the school children I said Primary
[2:44:28] School Secondary School University
[2:44:29] whatever it might be so we could spend
[2:44:31] time praying for them as we go into the
[2:44:33] new school year so once again this
[2:44:35] coming Wednesday service here at the
[2:44:37] Tabernacle at 8:00 p.m. we have our
