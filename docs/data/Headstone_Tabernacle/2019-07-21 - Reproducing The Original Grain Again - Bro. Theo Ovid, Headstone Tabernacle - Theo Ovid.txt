Jerusalem upon the up whom they slew and hung on a tree him God raised up the third day and showed him openly not to all the people but under witnesses chosen before of God even to us who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead and he commanded us to preach unto the people and to testify that it is he which as was ordained of God to be the judge of the quick and the dead to him give all the prophets witness that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins and why period speak these words the Holy Ghost fell on them which heard the word and they of

chastise and if we kind of start just iseman then it shows we're not children of God we are bastards but if we can start enticement knowing that all things work together for good and I love God then we are sons and daughters of God then he seals us with the Holy Spirit until the day our Redemption that's the chastisement the screen that's the one I want underline there the string the thing we go through we have a few mature people here today but somebody has trained I report back in comedy mode because your stream but whether you're here and you don't say Amen you still go get stream right now or not some of you on the stream strain is pressure or go in your God but sweat it out [Applause] hallelujah I am NOT a gym person I do exercise behind here whose but as far than a somebody gym

work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose or kill the Lord a show don't ask God for escape hatchet ask God for his will to be done in your life I wanna say it again don't ask God for escape touch it I squat for his will to be done in your life like how Jesus said it never less not my will but thy will be done you have your will but there's also a will of God for your life and sometime in this crash and you have to give up your will to enter into the will of God but like what a Peter said when you are unprotected then you are protected or glory that God I'd better be in a will of God hallelujah but no protection or because going to make a work out you think that Butler that Joseph interpret the dream to could we really put it too hard

didn't I am you know I want to see it by feeling bad I walk that man I walk on water but when when when I see crucifixion and licks I said not me this is Peters testimony he's a living witness of denying this is his own confession but when that Holy Ghost when that power come upon that same he was ready to break into something he never broken before because them Jews have nothing to do with the Gentiles so but as Hangul is very significant that Peter receive vision so go and eat or glory the core to this whole thing about hallelujah positionally please son here was 100 glory that God

planted for the body the rain is going to fall put his soon I mean the real rain and it got to have seed to fall on I hope I live to see it Oh glory to God then he said that gentle disposition is to be finished with the church age when this anointed messenger arrives of course he will plant the seed of the entire Bible come from serpent seed to the message I know for marine so to see the Prophet was to bring was the seed of the entire Bible and the Bible is that they're the pyramid Oh give the Lord some praises for glory of God so he was to plant the seed of the entire Bible and that pyramid is the entire Bible you see level Mexico you have to use in Mexican pesos the Caillou's it's easy dollar in Mexico they will take the time to turn up in it has no value dear you have to convert TT money into pieces if you go to Germany you have to convert your money to euro good Jacana is CDs you have to convert the money so if God want to see you sub mines if called one Church ages you seven ponies so if you have to preach you have to preach the Bible so this becomes the book but if you want life that's week of the Bible that's the pyramid you have to convert it you don't put the Bible book in you you put the pyramid in you or give the Lord a shout [Applause] no the Bible is a mysterious book so is that clear in it if you have the Bible the pyramid in you you have the mysteries in you then if that be so you have seven mysteries that they fought for to bring back [Applause] [Applause] hallelujah you carry spirit spirit is poured out but you preach the word and the will turn the spirit and the world of this brief tune the Spirit coming to you then the word is in you Oh Lori let's continue from the breach he said he that promised these things in the last day he that said these things he that is know in the time of the revelation of these things being made known so for the last fifty years we have been living in the time of the revelation of these things being made known but there comes our when it changes from the time of the revelation to the time of the manifestation or chlorine Oh God can you see it this morning do you understand all the mysteries all the revelations have to be unfolded because we have been prophesied that we be living in the time of the revelation of these things being made known but you're gonna come on we're gonna change to the manifestation or give the Lord some freezes are we going good do you get that so people still caught up in the revolution revolution revolution more revolution more revolution praise God praise God praise God because that gives the minister the power to reveal and printings may be seated when disciples when Jesus was only dead and his post resurrection ministry to the elected not the people not the feed bread and feed the hungry and what touches the elect his purpose was to bring it to the revelation of these things we made known so he went to the Old Testament and part of the prophecy of Jill probably Professor Isaiah not a little stammer in tongues but all the prophecies pertaining to what they have to fulfill so that's where will be the step out he said this is that that the Prophet Joel Zwick of he knew exactly where to identify the scripture and we have a scripture revolution 2017 the Spirit come upon the bride we have scripture Malachi 4 6 the house of the church and back to the faith we have our scripture turn back to the say to the fathers or give the Lord a shout hallelujah hallelujah so I am saying we have been through the time and coming to the end of time of the revelation of these things being made known so I'm not debating that and the revelation of these things being known with the mechanics because I brilliancy were in you as the word been unfolded by revelation an inspiration it brought the seed anew but the secret is in the wood is in the bride are just waiting for what dynamics she's rid of our charity she's waiting for what the mind of Christ to know what to do with the word okay the Lord and show hallelujah hallelujah the would have to be in you for the spirit to come upon you because you become the word itself the spirit and the bride is the spirit and the wood because the bread becomes the word you becomes a wood bride income it will it bride [Applause] therefore the spirit follows here ooh God dries up the shock and the life that was in the shop goes well into the seed he and you ever see the Lord a shock [Applause] do you see it the seed is planted it grow to processes talk and starter leaves and all that stuff but the sea traveling on somebody said we feel the Spirit of God yes it passed through you must feel it but the Spirit of God have a destination the spirit life have a destination the destiny in the seed so when the seed is not ready yet the spirit can reach that the sprayer producing leaves vision flowers if we lose anticipation that but the destination a seed so when the world come is the seed so then I get locked up inside of you then you become the seed itself then the spirit is nowhere else locked up a seat form then all awaiting for Israel to produce your manifestation or give the Lord a show it's just come to pass afterwards that I will pour my spirit [Applause] let me continue here whatever Ana based on what I what shall I do which is called the Christ he's I'm gonna say something the mechanics there are so many people trying to explain the mechanics when you don't know it the only thing you know you should know the mechanics is known what is Moses he said somebody said action or I want to explain the mechanics of Holyoke flute he couldn't do it because no I'm self niversary his revelation of ability Ark was the act rain was the promise so that was the promise but he couldn't explain to anybody how this big big big bill with three stories who all anonymous is that green and flute he couldn't make Spain he can I would he use the belly acquit was a software called battle some would because God was will give up for the revelation but if Noah's argumentative Annie Annie get him Anna Gary revelation of the wood softwood God this cabbie right this wood will sink this is good for wood while I'm holes and porous God doesn't give any whole thing he is make you sweat it out so Noah had to believe this seems softwood that will sink in normal water and he watching me sinking and God tell me the ability ordered this if God said so I doing it yet because God make him sweat it out to believe it is God concerning that word because later on a further revelation to pitch it dies why go tell him that word because the pitch gonna sit inside and outside and make it waterproof if he are use a different kind of wood it couldn't have the absorption the way the pitch was going to absorb so water no fool he's a function of intelligence he know exactly what he's doing she's gonna make the wood waterproof by taking a sort of wood that is absorbent and pitched on the inside and pitches on the outside and God taking you a sauce wood that the devil have been building up building up building up for taking you and go Vasily on the inside I'm silly OSHA nobody gonna proof team on proof get proof or glory no good you're on your way to the rapture [Applause] maybe season hallelujah Oh glory to God you don't have to know the mechanics just the dynamics of it the dynamics is what you want to know no listen to this this emphasis we put here on this quote couldn't be said in the time of the revelation of these things being made known because dynamics that come out the season you have grown you know so in the qualifier a rain rain and all them palpable and picker and all ambush within say yes and even if that rainfall is bush you got the cotton is low on grass and but in class on our machine you know yeah this isn't in yet sorry word was lost so there was no see to come back luta Wesley Pentecost Yakima prophet angels come not to gather all the scattered wood to bring the seed of the entire Bible so he came with the entire sea of the tyre Bible put it a seven seals seven thunders to it in the book hallelujah and said go and take the book eat the book let that book come inside of you then you have see-through feasts i prophesy about that rain prophesy bo dynamics we have enough for years and people laugh and mock us they think they have it already and they have no power no 190 no witness no vindication not just not only have these books and tapes and mote you know why the doors were shut to me ever anybody knows because they were afraid you see that word afraid

gone now he said wheat on the promise of my father wait in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high they were looking for it that was the Alpha what about you Omega Church what you looking for some man to come and explain your voice and a prophet some man to explain you some more mysteries no we're looking for power from on high it has to come upon the word right isn't that right so no just the dynamics of it no watch Moses Moses couldn't explain watch tell me explain to me how you made flies come upon the earth Moses couldn't explain it you don't have to know you make the east bank on blowhole to the Red Sea and we follow on dry ground explain the mechanics of that tell me in the scientific research and what but he didn't know it he didn't know the mechanic he just other than an annex and that's the way I can't explain it I don't know the mechanics it's the dynamics and then he said no you don't know you don't there we go you don't have to know the mechanics you know the dynamics the things that pulse hits it that makes it true and see it hits a target so after all these years you come to the one our Gentile worker that just come in last week or

my we are unbeliever we are in the presence of Jesus Christ see all this is any would now but it's your attitude that brings the results the mechanics is here and so is the dynamics if you can get

lega lega serie and then Mary he said no watch and then Mary was a carrier see so that was a revolution she cannot do it no he said watch he's a tree woman was the type of church's means treating emotional agents carriers which must drive up and down chat either shop and go forth and give room for the seed the seed can I get right until the shock stalk leaves all dry so when we come to see time to meet everything as a trial and it sucks every bit of the life in them out of it so it's all that was plus you say I kind of do it now it's each time or brighten the shocks are dead the shocks are dried up it's friggin wood time not touched it's a virgin virgin wood time put your hands is no mention hands on it it won't be a virgin not touch once the carrier of a true word justification it become a Kairos sonification if he can't have the bath only goes restoration of the gifts but then when he goes on and keeps going on what a genuine eagle knows the day I know it's alright she is no i dry shock here we go it is fast the Spirit of God passed through her is true and will not she will not be heir with the vindicated seed world people that win you to the Lord surrender not leave my wrong no God use them to bring you to Christ and some of them back sitting somebody I'm not even serving Lord Lord and God use them in that time life passed through them but you were seeded that's big that's big that's a big one that's a big one people let's call you and bring you to Christ I'm I never get my wrong some of them not even saved at the back seat or anything else but you are still here God will use anybody to get to the seed but once a seed Prince's come to see that you a seat and it's bright time glory degausser the seed will not be able to shock what she will not be in the rapture she will be at each member may come up in the second resurrection and be judged according to what she's heard so the church members that is what that represents but the seed is for the rapture see this for what the rapture and Baram say we live to Luther age Wesley age Pentecostal age and each age is given a promise of the world and the people of that age that manifests that word are the seed of the age the manifestation of the Holy Spirit operate and to his children is those seed of the kingdom so watch the seed of the word right when the word coming to you and become operated by the spirit because I'm manifestation of the Holy Spirit that makes you the seeded not somebody taught in a Bible or spoken word books okay the Lord a shout when court convert the seed into you and becomes the life it becomes a color so the devil here you hear in word but when that would become into a color a rainbow flashing so when you walk the streets and children are is rainbow flashes every devil in hell see light flashing from you red orange hallelujah glory of God do you see it now if you understand that you would want to know how you walk how you talk how you live how you're acting because you have to be understand your life becomes a witness Peter was saying we are witnesses of these things he was telling on us he was not here you didn't see Jesus walk you didn't see Jesus talk here we have to give a testimony of what Jesus did we are witnesses of these things and why he was speaking the Holy Spirit or glory to God cell upon them to confirm what he was saying was the truth talk about a son how to be qualified to dignify this please but if he was qualified into the father's place then all the father had was going to the son now watch he's not talking about the son born he don't matter son qualified that's not the same we're not talking about son born because I rascal sunroofs on difficult son hadn't son when he gets on or it's awesome sons but all kind but he's talking about the qualified son he said watch and watch and there is way I think many of us Pentecostal people has made a mistake we think as soon as we come sons and daughters of God that's visit we just come into a place of trial so he was saying that the birth of the Holy Ghost gives you a door to be tested and tried to come forward into spiritual maturity that court could approve your life this has nothing to do with reading books and listen to tapes this is something different you don't get test reading a book unless in some school taking some exams you look at tests listen isn't it I say listen to the tape I'll say read the books when you go outside you can't test or where you read and what you're here could you give the Lord a shout I never good some good news for you God is not a ducting administer because of his sermon did you want to see him another one I thought you might be choking on that one yeah so don't bother about him I put together holy now he said what is nice just part of it for you hear the word it still come down to the life can begin good I want to wrap up he said no talking about just one Caleb he said Joshua study and said God give it to us what we are well able to take it he said why why what was it he just won't kill them they were positionally born in Christ so he's bringing it present tense the other knowledge of the word and the word become manifested remember every one of those Israelites had the would preach to them but it only take me effect upon Caleb and Joshua to realize what it was all about so that is when you find your channel that's when you find your place when your opinion don't realize what it's all about you find your position in Christ it's effective to you then in other words it's inspired to you even inspired to you nobody at the back at the workshop and nobody abeggar keep your eyes open go down wash your face and put some some some some keep picking your ID to keep your eye open you feeling so sleepy because you know while watching last night you feeling so sleepy nobody tell her that you know if it inspire to you you will ship and go to one to worship the worship and because you know you have a part to play and create any atmosphere that supposed to hear you talking about Josh suave not knowing bye-bye inspirational letter the Holy Spirit being into the promised land give each man according to what was punished by the please just replaced and positionally in the land what a minor grown in butenes I said when I was grown in she was naming them Ephraim manna said and they have a place in the land

shout is not something to shout about the son then burn said look God has set some in the church true yeah liebe pin you have to sweat it out labor what labor what little what no good leave up pins men who sweating us out could you take a little more is that why I had preacher Isaac tell me don't make it rusty if somebody's mad this morning I don't wanna see either all glory to God then he said they get tremendous sometimes what tremendous labor pains then he said when a church like our church it is groaning under the persecution of the outside world which is the message world believe in our Lord Jesus that the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as real to us as it was the Pentecost how they grow and cry under labor pains but when they are born and positionally born into the kingdom of God then the Holy Ghost has set in the church some apostles some prophets some teachers some evangelists some pastors and he given - they're speaking in tongues interpretation of tongues gifts of healing and all kind of miracles what just has to be grown in it has to be traveling you have to warn kept some of you too comfortable whatever I'm said no this is my purpose of doing this the church is always trying to take somebody else corner but don't do that you could never raise corn and Ephraim's corner if you are man I said you have got to take your place in Christ the issue was you see

shout it will be low voice word present tense word while Peter spake these words he wasn't Courtin he was just speaking it was God speaking through him it was living word we are coming back to that that was any Alpha bride it will be Omega bride and they want to know by what authority he does that oh come on you may be seated by what authority does is that my father my father give me the authority although he spoke not like the scribes he spoke like one having authority and the bride will not speak like no scribe the bride will have the authority Authority from the throne of God there

eternal servants any earth could have strung from the earth on you're gonna see the manifestation of please son son will be placed in the body placed in Christ no they are know what the position is let's continue [Applause] my god I'm enjoying the word this morning I hope you enjoy it like me but this one is important this is from this edition shhh but mom said it this way to understand this subject even more clearly it will no have to be wise approach to so it's why I put it on the standpoint of the church to the ages up until now we have been thinking in terms of the removal of the names of individuals but now we want to consider not the individuals but the groups represented in the church to do so we were liking the church through the ages to the week plant a grain of wheat is planted to the end that a single grain of wheat will reproduce and multiply itself through a certain process during a certain period of time that single seed will die but in dying the life that was in it will come up into a plant which will in turn be the bearer or the carrier of that life which will come back to the originality in multi-platform Jesus the great royal she died the mattress one who is the life of the church stands in a myth of the church for seven two teaches given his life to the church the carrier or the bearer to the end the purpose that his very life will be represented his in the resurrection it is at the resurrection that the royal seed will see many royal seeds like unto himself and there will be even as he is for John said we shall see him like him that is what John the Baptist are referring to when he said Jesus will gather the wheat into the Ghana that was the resurrection when the redeemed who had been elected and eternal life came in now then the record of this wheat plant whose end is to reproduce the original seed in multiplied form is the book of life so Balram converted now we plant and he converted into the book of life I repeat the history or the record of this wheat planet is the book of life of which a part of the book of life is the record of eternal life a section in the book of life because the book of life reads chords all life that comes on the earth but in that book of life have a section which is the eternal section which is where you have your name all life is in the book but in that section have a eternal section which God put your name in there that section cannot be removed under no circumstance III wanted a bigger even than that in that section of that book under no circumstance those names could be removed because that section have the eternal thoughts of God which is just as real even though not yet expressed did you hear that that section have the eternal thoughts of God which is just as real even not yet expressed because the words are not expressed but the thought of God is just as real as the expression of the soul let's continue this is convincingly seen by examining the we plant a bear see the Tsun Tsun ablated seen but that is not to beat yet it grows into a stalk that is not yet written life is dear but not beaten at the end of the stalk is a spike that sends out a tassel still a wheat plant but no bit yet then the plant is pollen iced we see this just grow this looks like the wheat but is not yet seed then it forms the wheat in the husk it is no back to what it was originally no the ripened wheat is harvested Jesus Christ died he give his life that life was to come back upon the church and bring many sons like unto himself into the glory resurrection but as the wheat seed had to have a carrier to bring forth multiplied with seed even sure it had to be a church which will be a carrier of the life of Christ as the blade stalk Teslin husk where the carriers for the seed was not the seed itself so the church cooperate to the ages has been a carrier of the to seal don't not to seed itself that is why we can see that the book of life is the whole wheat plant the book of life is the whole wheat plant including the carriers including the process in which as life grows truth or glory to God let's go over it again here is the original seed that was planted it producer plead that wasn't it if it is a stalk not it either here come the husk in which the reaches the form that isn't it the tassel appears the pollen fall on those pistols part of the plant is quickened something of the original seed came to the rest of the plant turns into seed why I didn't hold not going to seed because it was created to that end that just part of the plant can't go back to being seed are you writing with me are you with me okay so let's go because it was created at end just part of the plant can go back to that being see know what just part of that plant can go back to being seed because just part of that wheat plant is eternal life wheat you have a perfect type here we go of all Israel Eve in Egypt they all came out two million strong always skip to the sacrificial blood all were baptized in the Red Sea all came out of the water into an holy spirit manifestation and blessed all it angel food would not carriers but but carriers for the children who would which should follow them and go to Canaan land but all Israel is not Israel all but a tiny minority had their names blotted out of the book of life and we are the same right today in the church names we blow the book of life no names will be blotted out of the book of eternal life for that is another record tour contained in the book of life this is the record that God had given us eternal rights and that life is in his son he that hath the son hath the life he that hath not the son hath not life and all through the Orion I feeling strong like an ox worried I do one for tomorrow I just hope you could write in this pyramid I'm not going to be tomorrow go tell you one thing but this is the record right what he that hath not the son hath not life no disappear Monica - and those who have that life were in him before the foundation of the world are you ready they were chosen in him before the foundation of the world that great royal seed Jesus Christ was planted that life that was in him came to the wheat plant and is reproducing itself in modules of wheat seeds having the same life in them and being like the original because and there's the power I wanna get to by spirit they are original not let up not word but by spirit quad converted the spirit to identify the original seed revelation 22:17 the spirit and the bride will see come or glory to God hallelujah glory to God hallelujah oh my oh my oh praise God notice there will be no more courier no more mother churches what because and they say I get the inspiration from after the shock there is no more nothing left but the green is that right it's got to be the green it's got to be the same kind that went to the ground Jesus Christ the same yesterday then forever then he said his spirit come upon the bride to do the same thing he did see is the repetition again of the cream doctors where get the title from taxes where get a title from the spirit coming upon the bride to be the same thing what is it our repetition of the green and you are green by spirit you are green by original original spirit or glory to God my god let me see the control of here oh my mission coming please oh here we go Gordy sinner he was perfect what is confusion you know he was perfect love perfect peace perfect joy perfect certification perfect satisfaction all those seven spirits as we get in revelation did make up God say said God when you flip it and converted seven spirits make up God let's continue and the camera of God okay all those seven spirits made of God was perfection and everything else outside of that has been something profited from that you said with me and the only way we could come back to the perfection is to come out that that perfection so he's saying the only way that from the perfection is to come back to seven spirits not mysteries the mystery of the convert the spirit and that is the perfection now watch tree is perfection their ministry comes his perfection when it represent a natural among human being oh my so you have got to get a connection to Christ friends and hear what he said you know he said you know he said when they come to Christ you said lord if he will receive me to your kingdom I promise there you are I would love you I'll be true to you I will serve you day and night it's too bad we forget that I was so few denied I will fast I will pray I'll be loyal to you I'll bring my Titans into the storehouse I will pray many times a day I will do anything I'll place my love to you that's what you should do that's exactly right well you promised that it should come from your heart if you promise your husband that enough of your heart you mean that it's not living correctly with him look here if you haven't got teeth and you use false teeth no that is all right it is substituting for the teeth you once had and actually those teeth are not connected with you it's not part of you if your arm is amputated and you put on a force arm the arm is actually not connected with you it's just stuck on to you it is not connected and when we give our pleasure to Christ and we don't become part of him like I won't become part of a man then we become artificial Christians that's the way the churches are too many today we are just taking the name of Christian Church pretending to be the bride when it is artificially we are not connected with Christ in any way we are like an artificial put artificial arm artificial eye we are artificially putting it on so you want to want a connection you're connected to the source go glory to God hallelujah you don't want to be connecting you want to be connected what Obama says is she become part of Christ when she does that she injects it into own life in his own life and the Bible said to Adam and Eve you are no longer two but one and when a woman a church is mighty Christ they are no longer two there one Christ in you his life has been brought into you and you become the bride Oh glory to God the whole creation is written for the manifestation what is the manifestation making known waiting for the manifestation sons of God to the speedom to the church to display them to the church Oh glory to God waiting and groaning for sons of God in the last days with the power of the Holy Ghost to the end of the age to reveal the secret things on the functionable to bring it up this is the day of the manifestation sons of God when the mysteries that have been hid from the fallen world history made known and that made known as not as my revelation is made known by manifestation because Christ is making known God Christ is the mystery of God revealed Oh hallelujah he said tell me it had to wait all this time now all thing I mean brought up come and shaping up to a headstone to the manifestation the sons of God come when when God's when the Spirit of God commented these men so perfectly until their ministry will be so close like Christ and this is what some of the ministers don't understand that is not their ministry suppose see is Christ's ministry have to come into them he said when I'm on claim something gonna drop a man into the family of God first tried out see if it's right the Bible said the Bible's had tried the spirits so we have not told you to take accept somebody claims they claim there's a clean up okay let me check it out I don't want to check it out let me don't want together that we supposed to do try the spirits somebody claimed this yeah angel either flying so and we can make a swing so witty enjoy tell you nothing you just flying say so it's a fine engine by you good good good Instagram pictures I got one time man see a pillar of fire in the briefcase so he said open the briefcase with keys this is to see these Kooks and see these characters and what oblivious account speaker immigration man out of existence characters pass through what kind of comic strip sting and claiming to be adopted my god the quarter is above all so try it see if it's right if it's right move right with it he said keep moving until every fellow takes this place then is when you wanna see the Church of God begin the tickets please then is when the Philistines will go to backing up and you will see a holy church stand together in the power positionally place sons of God adopted in the family of God all glory to God we should be so on fire for God we should be going there night nothing should be able to stop us we should be so sweet so pleasant so kind so christ-like in our lives it takes every day life God is calling his children aside by manifestation they don't have to

been to one of their plays before really really a wonderful production that they would do and it'll be held at the southern Academy of Performing Arts on September the 24th but space would be limited
