be the name of the Lord 11:00 this morning praise be to Jesus Thank You Lamb of God well I am happy to be here it's always a privilege to be in the house of God a privilege where God could speak to your heart and you could meet upon him blessed be the name of the Lord isn't he wonderful this name I wanted to read something here the book I get it from but a Sigma convention in Germany if in together I shared with you well I think it was a real blessing about what a man talking about his objective and motives to point people to Christ not to himself but a group put a point people to Christ I say you could together for me I want to get that part that quotation the objective the Convention I want to read it for you and will be a blessing to you you see the objective and motive must be right for it to happen just as you have to run the race right for you to correctly get the gold medal because they don't run the race right to be disqualified at the end of the race so this is where I come down to the purity of heart and mind and spirit you never know we're just now still waiting I'm still waitin but Obama says I'd rather be right in my spirit and wrong in my doctrine than to be right in my doctrine and wrong in my spirit that would Kooten again I rather be right in my spirit and long in my doctrine that doesn't to be right in my doctrine and wrong in my spirit you see further right spirit you could get connected to the right doctrine but if you have the wrong spirit you in trouble big time this is the inspiration for this international summer convention over 70 14th the convention aesthetically time a prayer consecration worship speaking receiving the truth in love and being filled and we filled and sealed by the Spirit of God lays and God promises since many eyewitnesses of the Ministry of Allah William Branham were known to be with the Lord is but it was Sigma the huge pastor I have in my heart to invite still living eyewitnesses of God's prophet to come and give witness personally of the presence of God and a confirmation of his word and the power of the Resurrection in Jesus Christ in this man of God and the things that personally have seen and heard you know it is our hearts desire to experience the very same presence of the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ moments I was vindicated in better balance meeting there will be what he was filled ministers and the body of Christ and minister under the holy spirit let us pray that the bright promises will be preached in such a way that the Holy Spirit may give to the hungry heart such instructions such an experience that they will know perfectly how to submit antique a whole of God's promises and how to let the world promise them through to the bone against endless nature to defeat the enemy we therefore if you gave me God said I will restore the feet again in the last days where is sending the Holy Virgin such a we upon planted wood that it will be stored there for coated invite you to this convention and please give them petitions to your brothers and sisters and especially to our young people in the church may the following quotes express the attitude and vision for this convention and this is what I want to read this is Vera Brian not for one moment do I bring a message to the people they may follow me or join my church or start some fellowship and organization I have never done that I will not do that no I have no interest in those things but I do have an interest in the things of God and people and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied the one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men wear it men become new Christians creations in Christ film at his spirit and live according to his world I would invite lead and warn all to hear his voice at this time I mean your lives completed to him even as I trust in my heart that I've given my all to him god bless you and me his command rejoice your heart this is what about I'm speaking for the to Chileans we need a conference a universal permitting for the Church of the Living God to be called together and this is the last quote I believe it's coming to a time till when the Saints will get together like this I'm just a love spirit will sweep before the audience and every person in dear all that is wrong will be taken out it will be such a presence of the Holy Spirit and I believe it's coming a time Jesus prophecy I believe it's coming a time when God Church is going to be calling out like that does he usually by the way to use call up like that where the scenes will set together and the Holy Spirit will just come in unjust room just like it was already at Pentecost and just heal the people and raise up the people and create things are begin to see it happen it's the love of God we will be standing preaching like this talkin and just love it was settled over the buildin this is from God keeps his word that was very important for you to understand and hear God's promises because God is God if you didn't understand that God said I was gonna go deep flood was coming in all day we was gonna miss the ark you have to hear what God promised not what you feel and what you think because you could feel certain these are certain scriptures but admitted apply to your age or your time or your season suppose you feel led to apply blood right now and kill a boat Cannell a man and put the blood you feel led by the spirit that is a different spirit because that was some Moses time God word for you know is not to take blood literal blood and apply it on the doorpost so you have to find out what is your word and you get a word for your life so god bless you and thank you again we want to be praying for those meetings for what a Sigma in Germany that God will bless and we expecting work to do great things amen so many gonna pray for the meetings you see this right buddy this is wife of Jesus Christ now she does the meat clicking a mix-up with Church this is not Church this is Christ's life the Bible said is right at me yourself ready so this is not one Bumpus no no it's a universal right buddy people that call to love God people that have a deep in your soul remember you didn't call yourself you are wretched miserable naked poor plain something higher than you something more powerful than you before you top a self-righteous and look come on nobody because he raised you up he's the one that raised you up do you wanna give your eyes salad you might see he did it show tunes of grace grace works works they're gonna be the grace of God and the powers I'm alone of people going to be the grace of God let's thank God and His grace and tango fellas praise and thank God for His mercy Oh hallelujah praise the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord so don't call up people to walk with God alone alone it's not right not being called by a bishop or built up by being gone by Christ it is maasai kingdom that we live in where Christ is the king an antichrist spirit tries to get call the people organization the organization to organization organize them together which was never the will of God people are fuss with me because I structure hard organization it isn't the people in the I'm striking that it's that dominating spirit that makes people think we are the people and you are not that's what it does it brings I am better than you I am higher than you I'm a revelation of you I'm a powerful of you and as foolish as a designer God [Applause] [Music] [Applause] he said you want to release use of your petition I can't accept you and break you out from what you will there is a porcelain some time ago really some please don't break out they were free temporarily you see the Lord in freedom the pre-code that's not what Jesus talking about when the Son of Man set you free so go back inside the prison not when God break you up see you let me see that I've seen on reason why anybody should be dead wrong today I believe everybody can be there free in half you can take the pass and put it behind you [Music] it appears as though we see it Moses was study in his past he never met each other because he was wanted all together to the last quiz I want to bring back to you oh praise the name of the Lord the Church of the Living God can never be any certain group it cannot be an organization it has to be a mystical body the holy spirit friends as a successor I shine the light has come and then he says gross darkness cover the earth gross darkness cover the people Sammy's
