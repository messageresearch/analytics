hands the service empty hands the word into hands in Jesus amen amen God bless you and thank you for coming out tonight for scripture reading we want to take three personal scriptures tonight in John 6. you want to read verse 63s in John 16. 12-13 and Zechariah Chapter 4 1-7. reading Saint John 6 6 3 Jesus speaks it is the spirit of quickness the flesh profited nothing the words that I speak unto you they are Spirit and their life and the next scripture is from Saint John 16 verse 12. Jesus speaks I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them no how be it when he the spirit of Truth is coming will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come on our last scripture from Zechariah Chapter 4 and the angel that talk with me came again and with me there's a man that is weak note of his sleep I said unto me what says Thou I said I've looked and behold a kind of sick all of gold and a bowl upon the top of it in his seven lamps they're on and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof and Tall of trees by it one upon the right side of the bowl on the other on the left side thereof so I answered and speak to the angel the talk with me saying what are these my Lord then the angel that talk with me answered and said unto me noise down not what these be I said no my Lord Denny answered and speaking to me saying this is the word of the Lord into zeruba saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts who are the whole great Mountain before zeruba Bell those shall become a plane and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace grease unto it me God bless his word you may be seated praise God we are grateful to be here tonight and I hope it's not boring for you to hear it over and over it's a privilege to be here tonight it's a privilege to be in House of God Amen I he made a privilege hallelujah praise God we don't have that right we don't know one day we we maybe call Over Yonder we don't know so when we get the opportunity to come to the house of God we are blessed amen so tonight I have a title the ministry of the spirit and I have an inspiration the new ministry this year is about 58 years since the prophet left 58 years being under the ministry of the wood the word revealing the word unfolding the word showing the word unveiling given us word promises and this on the breach he says he that promised these things in this last day he that said these things he that is now in the time of the revelation of these things being made known come and die so he actually identified these 50 plus years as the time of the revelation of these things being made known so God allow a slot and this slot will be a calling out time of the Bride for all these years from 65 to now some just come and went through and whatever but the bride is being called year by year day by day is that right nobody Brown from this Amanda turn the light he said the dirty rags of yesterday you say okay I'll skip that justification save its time till it become the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost served its time until the Holy Spirit which is only one God Blends into the church so there's a prophecy for the Holy Spirit itself to blend into the church because justification made a way for sanification sanctification made a way for the Battle of The Ghost and the Bible goes made a way for the Holy Ghost to come down itself imperfection and back to the word so God was always progressing and making moves isn't that right that we could come to that Perfection but he used this word a very interesting word Blends into the church and the church into Christ and it makes Jesus Christ reflected on the earth through this blending oh praise the name of the Lord isn't that right and and all the colors fade red blend into orange orange blend into yellow and yellow Blended in a green and green bended into into blue and so on it's a blending and we have to blend into Christ isn't that right he says I am only responsible for the word praise God isn't that right and Jesus said it is the spirit equipment the flesh profited nothing the words that I speak unto you their spirit and their life so words are not just words words are also Spirit the word that came out that Jesus mode is not just words it is spirit and life isn't that right we know this one we're going to read here but Obama's quote in the scripture that we read Because Aruba Bell thou shall become a plane these are messages of Grace and he said we are all acquainted with the scripture the river was a great Prince among the people laid a foundation as we read on further we find that God said the rumorable had laid a foundation with his hands he shall also bring forth The Headstone I want you to notice he never said he shall pay for the Cornerstone he shall bring forth The Headstone and we know that the scripture says that Jesus is the Chief Cornerstone and he is also the headstone now if he will think for a few minutes that the seventh Church messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers that was the prophecy that was the word that was the commission to restore the faith and then he interpreted that in other words rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit so there's a prophecy hanging over us tonight of the church being rebuilt by the power of the spirit and the church is going to be repelled by the power of the spirit when the ministry of the spirit stepped forward and there's a prophecy that there's going to be the ministry of the spirit which is the ministry to follow the ministry of the word and that Ministry of the spirit will be the new Ministry o praise the name of the Lord not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord not by organization not by denomination not by manner the hour but by all them revelators but by my spirit he said by the Holy Spirit God will bring for the church in the last day not by pressing play but by the spirit he's going to bring forth the church in the last day not by some Mighty Man from somewhere unless Mighty other man from somewhere no but by his Spirit oh praise God Amen and from Jesus keep all his appointments Tampa 18th of April 1964. he says that's the way God has brought his church from justification sanification baptism of the Holy Spirit and now the ministry of the spirit which is what quickens the word and the ministry in the church will have to be exactly like his so the prophecy is that that Ministry had to be won with Christ isn't that right at that day you shall be enough you know I'm in the father you may not in you it's not right so why don't I be written on this promised Ministry of the spirit it's a promise we are preaching here tonight who praise God praise God Romans 8 we know it verse 14 as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption not adopted yet but the spirit of adoption our father so you have a promise of your point of the spirit upon your life and that spirit is the spirit of adoption to take you all the way to hear him to take you all the way from virtue to knowledge to Temperance the patience to take you all the way all seven steps the spirit of adoption not adoption yet the spirit of it all is to come by the ministry of the spirit Hallelujah for we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby because our father the spirit itself there it witness with our spirit that we are the children of God the ministry of the word placed the seed into the bride Hallelujah the word of the son of man the son of man the promised land a land of spoken word promises spoken by this Malachi for prophet and echoed by a five-fold Ministry the secret is the word is in the bride and the son of man is the sower and the seed is the seed of the entire Bible sound inside of you oh give the Lord a shout he said he shall sow the seed of the entire Bible mean that the Bible which is the pyramid could be inside of you oh glory to God the entire seed will be a second Bible which is the pyramid inside of you isn't that right Hallelujah the secret is the word and the bride so the son of man is the sower and the seed is the seed of the entire Bible stoned to you we are not ready for the ministry of the spirit to Quicken and to make alive the seeds that in you the Caesar said me are you ready tonight oh glory to God the ministry of the spirit has to come to get the bride ready hallelujah praise God do you believe that tonight Hallelujah the knowledge of the truth becomes effective when it connects with the spirit of Truth you really have the truth when you have the spirit of Truth and Jesus promised that to be here oh glory to God hallelujah so when that Ministry of the spirit strikes and comes among us then it will be the word brought to you by the minister tree of the spirit oh blessed be the name of the Lord the minister of the spirit is the Dynamics to the mechanics it's the spirit to the word the minute of the spirit is to follow the ministry of the word the ministry of the spirit is the ministry of Jesus Christ Hallelujah glory to God that Ministry gonna turn the teachings of the Seven Seas like the cloud are you looking at the picture the right way you turn from seven into one into the headship of Christ the cloud to bring the latter in or give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah that Ministry is Promised we've got to have it it got to be here the ministry of the spirit to Quicken the word to the bride it is prophesied over us oh praise God Amen will be his voice the prophet said he said therefore friends as your brother that's that's all I am but God's gift is the spirit of God that came down in the form of an Angel he didn't have wings he looked like a man I heard him when he walked as he walked on the floor walk right over just as normal as any man talks like any man he comes time after time through the room and different places when I'm fasting and praying you know what he said yeah God's gift is the spirit of God that come down in the form of an Angel so the prophet preacher's message and he said you know what I'm waiting on Hallelujah I'm waiting on him and in the spirit of God come down in the form of an Angel then you hear into he is here Oh Glory to God what happened the spirit comes to confirm the word come in the form of the Angel and as I was with Malachi 4 so I will be with Ephesians 4 the spirit again coming back in the form of an Angel Hallelujah that angel was a Peter that angel went to the early church and that angel gonna be with the bride oh give the Lord I shout in the house do you believe that amen are you ready let's go leave the messenger the end time messenger his job will be to get the scenes ready for the bridegroom that will be his message you want to learn ABC so you can study algebra later and ABC is already Christ isn't that right now here we go bring back the church to the word what is this messenger of Malachi for to do restore back the original fate and you know it's so great to have us Prophet that could flesh out the thing we need to know then he identify what this original fate is he called it the resurrection feet Hallelujah turn your eyes back to the faith of the fathers but not just any faith Resurrection feet now these disciples had Faith with Jesus but Resurrection faith is after Jesus raised from the dead he appeared to them to anoint the faith that they had so their faith was a resurrection feat oh let's put it this way an anointed Faith to receive the promise of dynamics of power of the Holy Ghost of the reign of the quickening that they were supposed to get in the upper room their faith had to be anointed so it cannot be just the same Faith they had before Jesus died it's a resurrection fade it's not right and he explain what that faith is Resurrection faith that they seen Jesus after he was raised from the dead seen him working among them so ricardia's point to William Branham and all what Christ did through him and by him we have to see him Among Us working Among Us and seeing him among us give us Resurrection faith we see Jesus we see his Spirit Hallelujah we see the operation of his Spirit by the ministry of the spirit you're going to see Jesus do you believe that there were men of few words they went forth and preached the word they preached long Paul preached all night one time a man fell out of the building killed himself he laid his body over him brought him back to life again and he kept on preaching oh my oh praise God let's go Jesus they used to be unfailing realities of the Living God the brought God to human lives God was made human when Jesus was born God became man that he might have fellowship at man Whitman and in man to achieve one purpose that is to bring to man what God is not what a church is but what God is Jesus came that he might present God to man and Mandan wanted the Holy Spirit comes today in like manner to present God to man but man wants to go to church that's what man want to do it drums out his thinking he cannot Farm it and we must learn that God is not known by intellectual conception God is known by the new birth by the Holy Ghost not by any other way Jesus the Bible said plainly quoted no man can call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Ghost and if you never receive the Holy Ghost you don't know what he is in Christ for that's the only way he reveals himself you are not converted until you received the Holy Ghost the Bible said so and after Peter have been saved and Sanctified give power the castle unclean spirits and to preach the gospel Jesus plainly told him he was not converted until he received the Holy Ghost he said after you are converted then strengthen your brethren that was in the night of the Betrayal and he was not yet converted and no man is truly converted until he has been changed and died himself and the Holy Spirit has control of that person and they do not want to do it so it's not so much Holy Ghost they have how much Holy Ghost have you he said until the Holy Ghost have control of that person and they don't want to do it to be continue now the holy spirit will not misbehave itself in one person and behave yourself in another it will make each person come into its character because it's the spirit that leads you it brings and makes you subject to its nature you don't bring it subject to your nature it makes you subject to its nature and the Holy Spirit makes you live and love to do it how you love to give up the things of the world when the Holy Spirit comes in how it cleanses you and washes you and put a desire in you to follow him and a taste and The Hunger for More of it just pain yourself he brings realities oh give the Lord some praises so when God placed man here in the days of the Lord Jesus he gives man a true road map to his power road map to his power a road map is something that tells you where you're headed he said we live a few days I've crossed this country so much my wife and I were amazing for the last few days you could mention where you want to go I could tell you any rule that leads it within 15 minutes of the time you'll arrive from here to California I haven't missed it that time sometimes right in the dot calculating my time of what the driving time is and the average time I've been back and forth up and down back and forth till you just know it and that's the way God wants us to know his word we know it we travel it we have tested it we have tried it and you know it leads to now his roadmap is his Bible so we know when you have the Bible you have the road map the Bible is the roadmap that leads to the power of God could we say Amen see it leads you to the power and power produces the promise we need power I'm still reading Oh Glory to God Bible is a roadmap but I can't believe it's not right that leads to the power of God and faith is what leads us into the power and the power bring the produce the promise we need power isn't that right what does the route map point to is that right Jesus said you Hypocrites you can tell it's in Disguise but you cannot resume the time and so on if you have known my day did not the Bible said anything would happen did not Jeremiah Ezekiel or the Minor Prophets speak of it everything that wrote my point in right to one destination and when he come he had created their churches and things until they failed to see the reality of what he come for to bring God in man and to make God in man to unite them together again oh blessed be the name of the Lord are you with me tonight who praise God Hallelujah the church cannot run without the power of God the church cannot run without the power of God through the word and the Holy Ghost will only confirm the word of God for that what it's to do and here we go the anointing is to confirm the word Oh Glory to God do you hear tonight the anointing come down the anointing come not to confirm the word the anointing come down to confirm the word I'm reading the anointing is to confirm the word Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God praise God hallelujah when you see God bring down the anointed you know he's confirming his word my spirit is right in the word hallelujah hallelujah once word come the anointing comes behind because it's his own word is that the word of a man it's the word of God oh the prophet comes Spirit spoken word isn't that right all right now there's some testimony 1963 20 to November brother Brown you see you must never leave that word you must stay exactly with that word the way it is written don't put no private into petition to it just just the way it's written that is God's word God and His word is the same and as I said last night there is a portion of word lit for every age are you ready and there's some anointed comes down that projects that portion of word for that age and you see where we are at today Oh Glory to God so the anointing has to come down to push out that word or protect the word that you could see it let's go huh praise God watch what kind of massage is just looking for today the church cried the loudest Halloween about a messiah Revival no time back to this and back to that what are they looking for what more do you want what does the church want we already got it God give it to us it's his promise for this hour we look in the Bible here we go we see it everywhere Through the Bible anointed ones come on and make that word live again right in the hour for that hour we have got the Messiah this is him the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the word remains God is Jesus Christ the same yesterday and forever we know what is supposed to take place on this day we are wanting a messiah and God give us the Messiah his promised word for his day it is just written this is the part I want to get to for somebody with faith to anoint it and make it live again in every age the words every age and promise was a messiah and this is probably kindness is a messiah because that is promise for this age bride will display her virtue for the age it's just recall to display all it's not Paul only at Faith you know that was their display for that day we have our display because broadly kindness have to be dear for the spirit to come on top of that or give the Lord that's where God put the holy spirit in that slot that's a mystery you know Peter only say faith virtue knowledge Temperance I'm not charity you know the Prophet come and put the Holy Ghost slot and say the bride is being called aloud this year and visit where fitted in the Holy Spirit slot after the seven age we are called out of faith in that Holy Spirit so the bright supposed to connect to the ministry of the spirit in the Holy Spirit Oh Glory to God so wait a minute based upon this you mean anybody somebody could anoint any promises make it live that's what he's saying here oh glory to God let's read it again we are wanting a messiah God give us the Messiah his promised word for this day is just waiting for somebody with what shout out faith Faith anoint it and make it live again it's a real Messiah oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah so it takes Faith to anoint it and you have to anoint it to yourself that that word believe in you okay the Lord some Praises are you getting me tonight you're not anointing for the general Church you know you're anointed to you that that word will live in you and that the word will become flesh in you and that the invisible will become visible by the ministry of the spirit making manifest what's in you okay the Lord some praises glory to God glory to God before God manifests every anything at all he speaks his word let there be let there be let there be that's how God operates he always speaks his word because the word is a seed and once the seed get watered it bring forth after his kind he do have to question and wonder about it you know because the seed of the potential the seed of the ability so when God took the prophet off the scene he knew there will be a bride because the prophet saw received for the bride will give the Lord a shout that's why he could say the seed will fall in the hands of the predestinated the books will fall in the hands of the predestinated amen hallelujah hallelujah glory to God from hearing recognizing acting on the word of God but Abraham have you ever seen this you seen our churches today even in groups where we have separate ourselves and make organization we have seen all cities you see a man pick up a city in Scripture and brother that man can take that scripture and make it live live you make it live just exactly what is Promised here in the Bible and the next one will see him do it and he will come around and try to do it and fail hope you're reading me now why the scripture is not inspired to him he's only trying to impersonate he's trying to act like something well maybe he's sent by a man the Bible predict as Johnson Moses so the prophet said men will come forward and make this word manifest the same scripture the same quotes the same books and tips they listened on reading through and I come alive and they don't understand how it come alive oh glory to God the anointing coming to anoint the faith coming to anoint the very promise Oh Glory to God and make it live that's why I know you're gonna have a Revival because we have people here with faith to anoint a Revival a Revival back again he said what we see should make a church that will make a Revival we have to anoint that Oh Glory the God hallelujah hallelujah the Revival doesn't come by the preacher it come by the people in their homes in their hearts in their lives we have to anoint that you have to say the Revival have to come by me I'm responsible for my personal Revival I am responsible for bringing Revival at the church I'm responsible or give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah worried up God glory to God now watch here we go seed of this cup and see we live through looter age Wesley age all along to the ages the Pentacles of age and each age has given a promise of the word each age he said and the people of that age that have spoken books that civilian Church long longer you message long time if they say that here you know and the people of that age that manifest that promised word is the seed of that age have nothing to do with what group what Tabernacle what Fellowship they're going in who they pass is and how much Revelation you have and how much he connected internationally and how much people view him and it seems so powerful and what that has nothing to do with it the people of that manifest that promised word is the seed of that age God can't lie this is Spirit spoken word God can't lie this is nothing but the truth I will give 12 people inside there tonight it doesn't matter Oh Glory of God crowds will bring the anointing is Faith does bring the anointing okay the Lord Our Praise In The House hallelujah hallelujah it's not the numbers it's our numbers people with big churches and the and stone Dead Oh Glory to God but we can Revival yet tonight right this this place become too small for us Oh Glory to God be more room to run up and down the aisles okay the Lord some Praises stimulation and Revelation new wine new skins oh blessed be the name of the Lord are you ready each age is getting a promised word praise God what about brotherly kindness Maybe you don't hear much about that you know but we have three things before us and the messages that come with the Lord when the church Francis broadly loved one two when the church five holies and Z three when the church finds his place in Christ it will call to the other members of the body in Trinidad come and rejoice with us we have found the coin that was lost oh good I search all night attract the flaws I get rid of the cobwebs I kept on until I found the coin I was lost oh God I'm ready for the coming now let me hold on fire I have the extra oil I kept on until I found all what was lost Rejoice with me these are the three things that's before the bride ly love holy decency place in Christ and it's amazing that the book of Jude was placed just before the Book of Revelation and the Book of Jude is where he said and of some of compassion making a difference between those puppies and those who are feeling in the flesh in other words you have to manifest the breathly kindness before you break into true Book of Revelation Oh Glory to God hallelujah Give the Lord some Praises so Jude is correctly placed and in Jude have earned as he content for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints so it recover it from Faith at the bottom to probably carries at the top okay the Lord some Praises tonight and then you can open the door of the Book of Revelation say come up here I shall show these things I was Hereafter and when he the spirit to discover he's going to show you things to come he's going to lead you and guide you to all truth the spirit of Truth cannot lead you into error okay the Lord some Praises Give the Lord a shout come on now come on now the spirit of Truth cannot lead you into error because it's the spirit of Truth not just truth the spirit of it Hallelujah when you really have the truth the spirit of it oh hallelujah praise God praise God my you think when he is condemning the woman legitimate legal his right to do that I said Lord is this a place my daughter had to grow up in my daughter oh God wickedness and evil everything else and God tap on my shoulder pull him aside break a vision to him show him him sinning on his sins going before God showing the blood of that like a bumper bouncing It Off showing God writing the book pardon showing God take the book and drop itself forgetfulness and God's revelation to him was I forgive you and you condemn her because you need message let me say it again because your new message and you feel up dear you better come down from left steps and walk down and walk with everybody on they had a Google police step down you know to step down from that height of condemnation and walk to the woman and say woman I was just dear condemning you and whatnot and she dear and thing and he should begin to tell a story or she's boxing and whatnot and guess what happened right on the floor she was restored right on the floor because he got the compassion of God he got the eyes of God he got what God sees or give the Lord some praises and we have to come back to that to see what God sees to get God kindness in our hearts Khaled brought compassion Oh Glory to God God's view on the matter and the prophet said this way with brotherly kindness put yourself put your foot in your brother's shoes on the matter put yourself in his place don't just judge him from a distance put on his shoes and he might feel some Stones there or some things pricking his foot there that's why you walk in limping that's why he's walking or we walk in trouble because there are issues they're in issues put on the shoes and try it we'll give the Lord some Praises praise God another test Hallelujah if something fixing to happen you have to be tested two people carrying on in church making love and then the Holy Spirit dropped down Hallelujah Spirit dropped down anointing drop down power Joy drop down whatever you say gonna happen if we say blind go be blind you said they will die whatever you say gonna happen and here's a son God pulled the robe over him and make him let him make him choose and he answered none of the above I forgive you I forgive you could we go through these things all these ministers boasting with the Revelation both him at the church and boasting on braggadocious and arrogant and what could they go through these things slowly couldn't get that test and the car even fell asleep with Brethren and shake hands and take a meal and and whatnot everything had to be crisscross and and slamming and chopping and backstabbing and and whatnot is I'm hateful I believe some of these men not even saved serious but even convert not even see not many Behavior I have seen over the years no way that can't be right God save you and you had to behave like that are you really saved we were lost here think about it now you we were lost you know every message bride and talking by talk but we were lost and God Save Us by his Mercy God save us what did John said that was redeem us by thy blood is a cost to redeem us there's a price and the same blood for you it's for your brother was for him too and God switched him to Paul because his name was on the book not because he was bad behaved that his name is off the book shark this one finish like if them have a reason that they raise the name of the book they don't have a heaven they have a help I just laugh at them no Champions especially training modes laugh at them so hear this part now watch this and the people of that age that manifest that promised word is the seed of the age according to what Jesus said right here they are the children of the kingdom are you ready now here the sticker here now that's right the manifestation of the Holy Spirit operating through his children is those seed of the Kingdom at that age Hallelujah not handing out books and hanging out episode the manifestation of the Holy Spirit operating through his children is those seeds Hallelujah and how does the invisible God become visible word made flesh by the spirit bringing to pass the thought of the human mind Hallelujah isn't that right praise God making the invisible become visible by the spirit even the ministry of the spirit oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah glory to God the spirit was speaking something he said his Spirit want to move the spirit won't deceive the whole thing but where's the brotherly kindness that was spoken out where is the brotherly kindness in other words the spirit can't come down on godliness and all these things like that it wait the seventh step upon a revelation of Brotherly kindness and a manifestation of holy kindness the spirit of early kindness and understood so broadly kindness come like the Skylight window to break in the Holy Spirit slot glory to God give your scripture for that if you do forgive your brother neither will the heavenly father forgive you you're cool it have no charity when you stand praying for the Dynamics for the spirit for the power forgive if you are war against any okay the Lord some Praises when and we need to pray for that now we need to break into that now that's what we're heading right now the ministry of the spirit that's l-o-v-e that's love that's charity isn't that right and when you stand praying for that forgive me I look at your father-in-law mother-in-law brother-in-law sister-in no wife husband doesn't matter who it is cousin worker neighbor it doesn't matter who it is you have to forgive you have to have a clean heart Sanctified by the word isn't that right oh praise God thank you Lord Jesus no but a Brandon the spirit the spirit quickens in other words he's the powder that sends the bullet out like it was the powder when David met gulad like a slingshot with a rock he's only got a place to hit and that's the right between the eyes the rest of it was armored but God got in that Spirit he had five Stones a slingshot f-a-i-t-h-j-s-u-s someday fixing to happen cause here's the word the promise the power to sing it now what we need today is a man that will take God's word with the power of the Holy Ghost behind him so what he's saying now David had the stone David had the sling but it take the spirit Power to guide the stone so there was a power behind David and he said if we only can get started God will do the rest but we have to get started now if those other soldiers knew that key was that Faith anoint the promise not somebody could have stepped forward but nobody stepped forward but David stepped forward and with faith begin to wind up a sling and God got a hold of the wine as brother Ram says you drop a rock for something to happen drop a rock and dunk on my Whirlwind you've got to do something for something to happen it's not right oh glory to God when we eat today is a man that will take God's word with the power of the Holy Ghost to press it out there and watch it come to pass that is God's Army isn't that right Hallelujah so he's going out into the faithful Ministry now he presents his army in the form of five offices first apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists not press players Apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists that's his army that's his soldiers that's his commanded officers all with the baptism Holy Ghost with nowhere to meet the enemy on any guns he comes on this is not with the word of God each one backing one another up not stabbing one another up backing one another up a backstabbers doesn't if I fall he's a murderer or give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah are backstabber not in the faithful Ministry guaranteed each one back in one up watch here with him the chief Captain not up here in front up here above back behind but in them what is he saying he is saying he could be in front but not in he could be in back not in he came out his side not in but he's not talking about that this faithful ministry will have him in we'll give the Lord some Praises not up in front or up here above or back behind but in them that's the Army vindicating what the his resurrection by the proof of his words and then he quotes in John 14 12. he that believeth in me the work that I do shall do also what is it it is God in the church in these five predestinated offices backing up every word he said with the Holy Spirit himself in there which is the word made manifest proven his resurrection proving that he lives oh praise God praise God praise God hallelujah [Applause] let's go deeper but my name is Jesus is the word of God and he was busted open that life the life is inside the seed that is this life which is Spirit here we go life which is Spirit water flowing over you have to take it as you're bringing it the spirit over the seed of God will bring forth the life of the seed and if it brings forth something else there's some kind of seed other sea there if the spirit of God comes forth to water the seed if it is seed it's watering it will produce the life of the seed is that clear it will produce the life of the seed now Jesus is the word made manifest I like that not just the word but the word may manifest he and the word is one and the same that is why it was so made manifesting him so perfectly that's the reason God manifests himself so perfectly in Jesus because he was the seed word The Germ word itself every word waited here you know The Germ that's inside the seed that is the life in the seed and he was The Germ word of God the germ is the spirit The Germ is the water so you will understand when you talk about the faithful Ministry you'll have the gym in the body Peter had the gym so that's why Conyers had to send for him because the season changed Cornelius couldn't go in the upper room because the gym was now on the earth in flesh so God had to anoint Cornelius and for Peter because Peter had the gym and The Germ comes from the body to reproduce another son name by the spirit even the music of the spirit Peter himself didn't know that night that day that very hour everything was going to change he just walked and understood you have to give testimony and why he given testimony the Bible said while Peter speak these words the Holy Ghost fell upon them because it was from his mouth Germans Corner the Peter's mouth and he said that is the power in the last days the sons of God with the purifier veil with full germ Oh Glory to God that are faithful outside the body a faithful in the body oh give the Lord a shout in the house so Jesus was The Germ word of God the gym is the spirit the Germans the water and Jesus had to be broken open in order for that sea to let forth its life to water other sea that was coming do you see it I am sending forth spirit to water it and it will produce exactly it will produce Miracles it will produce the power of God and it will not deny anything because it's a kindred seed The Works that Jesus did if a man prophecy this is the word you know if a man has the seed of God in him one with the spirit of God watering that seed the same works that Jesus if the Same Spirit was within him is in you the same Works will be manifested that's how more word than one word if that seed is there and the watering Spirit that's what we're talking about tonight the ministry of the spirit is the watering Spirit that's supposed to anoint the faithful Ministry our glory to God to Quicken the word to the bride we'll give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah in other words God promised the watering spirit oh hallelujah hallelujah the ministry of the spirit then the works will be manifested in him are the same for it is the same seed wood God's son was his example seed and what his life was when the spirit poured upon him after his baptism and the Holy Ghost come upon him the very life he produced well that same watering Spirit of the Holy Ghost will bring forth that same kind of a life doing the same thing he did if it is the same seed son of God's seed will bring forth son of God's seed am I Branham because I was born a child Abram that makes me a Brandon because I'm their seed their two agreements they're sperm together make a seed and that made me then he said this now are you ready when God and His word becomes one when God's spirit water the seed of God the word of God it produces God the son of man is the sore and the seed is the word Oh Glory to God let's say it again the son of man is a sore and the seed is the word the secret is what the word is in the pride or the seed is in the pride what's next this water Hallelujah for 25 years Abraham had a seed of Isaac by prophecy then Elohim came down Hallelujah to confirmed by his presence and word I will return unto thee according to the time of life and man wasn't coming back Resurrection was coming back water was coming back transforming power was coming back Dynamics was coming back for that body change oh Chloe the god that Abraham could be changed to produce a promised son and Sarah to be chained to produce a promised son I will return unto thee according to the time of life and the prophet prophesied the real rain going to come oh glory to God the real rain the latter rain oh God hallelujah hallelujah glory to God what is that the water and spirit Ministry of the spirit hallelujah praise God so when God's spirit Waters the seed of God it produces God it is not the individual it is God you are dead you are not yourself no more you reckon Yourself Dead hollowed out waiting for the sea germ what is it it isn't you no more it isn't the man it is God in the man it's the Sedum like the beginning the spoken word it is God word made manifest in the man it isn't the man it's a man that died he can't be a hybrid in her son at the same time either son of that or son alive that's what he will come down to I don't care what they preaching what they're teaching is either a son of life or a son of death or give the Lord some Praises but somebody gonna die out oh glory to God and cross Jordan Hallelujah and come back with the mantle and strike the Jordan and they're going to say the spirit of Elijah not rest upon Elisha yes sir Give the Lord some Praises Oh Glory to God glory to God hallelujah hallelujah somebody gonna come back from Crossing Jordan get the Lord a shout feel good tonight Hallelujah this is the ministry that is Promised glory to God he said the spirit of Elijah rest upon Elisha hallelujah praise God hallelujah almost done you're going good tonight what was he himself a man God has made flesh and all Among Us the world was made fresh into all Among Us God spoken word through a virgin birth what a body and in that body come water and the spirit Washed by the Water of the word and then went into him dwelling him and there come a life of God manifesting himself through Christ God was in Christ the anointed one Christ is Anointed one a man that was anointed and God dwelling in him what is it the germ with the flesh so this is see June with flesh on it he said the June of the flesh the anointed one flesh being anointed with the spirit God produce the word of God made manifest and we beheld him the only begotten the father full of grace then there where he was almost done he was God word made manifest and now he died in order to pay the debt of your hybriden what is it that you could die to yourself and this is what I'm saying sometimes you know watch what ministers preacher what would pass this preacher now what to see when they bring that dead battery message and when I don't see the Dead part I will problem with that because we have to die sometime I go to the ministers they don't blast the tree in that Spirit something something is not the Holy Spirit General Hospital to get rid of just like the French spirit and American Spirit is one Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit not the national spirit and you have to get rid of your children that Spirit in order to contact the Holy Spirit you have to die to that culture politics all the things is the human element that's a bus pass that when the spirit is one spirit is one Lord It's one baptism if this Spirit fallen in Africa in India in South America is one Spirit America Canada wherever it's for is one spirit um watch this what is it that you could die to yourself until no more yourself and be filled with his word to live in his word and then then the Holy Spirit was in him comes down to water that wood to make it grow then what is it God manifesting continuing the work of his full son his only begotten to see that died for a high breeding that he might reconcile us back to be Sons and Daughters of God that what Christ might flow the same life that through the church might flow the same life by the word continuing the work being manifested as was in Christ Christ was God's women manifest he died give his life that he might send the spirit take his body up and send the spirit back to water to pay the redeeming price if we will believe it that's right isn't that right praise God the Bible has got to be in you the wood is a seed as long as it is lean here it won't do nothing but when it comes in here you know if it's coming stay in here it don't do nothing but when you come in here in the heart then it begins to manifest by the Holy Spirit The Works of God then Vision comes power comes humility comes although it all is gone you become nothing Christ becomes a life you die he lives there it is because he died I live when I die he lives again and when I die he promised me life I died out to myself so in order I can have his life how do I do it by taking his word his seed put the seed in here by faith believe it it produces exactly what it says all right stretch now you can't you see the Bible is exactly the word of God you see me yesterday to them forever we become Tabernacles of that Holy Spirit which is Christ that's the real seed then if that real Holy Spirit gets into the real seed of the word won't take part of it because the devil uses that you've got to take all of it oh my I could see why that bride will be so small because people not believe in every word they're not receiving every word and and God went with a burden with sending seven angels of Eternity to gather all these scattered wood to tithe back into the word to bring down the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost and the word is the same that's why God hate Creeds and hate the nominations Antichrist Spirits because and subtract from the word of God so God need an actual conduit of the entire world so that's why all the Loose Ends Mysteries were sorted out by that Prophet Elijah all the books all the Mysteries inside the book was finished and then they could get the thunders in the back of the book so in other words one the word was finished completely on the inside of the book you know every Spirit on the backside oh Gloria got a manifest what was inside the book oh give the Lord some Praises it wasn't saying written without you know it just says sealed on the backside with Seven Seals Oh Glory to God and seal is the finished work oh Blessed Be of the Lord is not right so you can't take part of it because the devil uses that so the devil uses part of the message Hallelujah but the bride take all of it isn't that right hallelujah praise God praise God Hallelujah from wisdom versus Faith to Zechariah 4 6 is where I'm going to close that right here the Bible said not by might nor by not by power nor by might but by my spirit said the Lord not by wisdom not by knowledge not by denomination but with my spirit I will what energize my word the disciples had it shown into them this is the detail of it I don't think I ever read this one before the disciples had it sown into them then the Spirit come to energize the word not by power not by might not by wisdom not my understanding I understand the mystery you know I understand you're waiting I won't understand it not that that's in Mississippi people with natural virtues and whatnot hearing Mysteries sit down Church there is saying that they're going back and they're coming home I believe prophet and God you're sending a prophet and whatnot but that's not what we talk about here now this is fire this is power this is the Energizer Oh Glory to God what the disciples had it shown unto them then the Spirit come to energize the word not by power not by might not by wisdom not by understanding not by this not by that but by my spirit I will energize my word by my spirit said the Lord it is the water of the word of faith that energizes the word of God that makes it work what did he say about Rebecca Rebecca was asked what are they coming right and he said he coming as a beast and he said the same camel that Rebecca watered took her to Isaac and he says how do we water the word by praises and worship that is why the churches are they so dead that is why they don't want no praises the devil know better that's why the devil buying them with no praise demons that they wouldn't water the word so they have the word but no water on it but when they begin to praise God and thank God and bless God like in the upper room they were praising and pressing God continue that is in the Bible they were worshiping praising blessing God continually whether you have you lost a job lost your car lost your pay Lord say health it doesn't matter you're still praising God continually what you're doing you are saying God I believe you and I trust you and I reject my circumstance I reject my situation I'm not looking with senses like it on Sunday evening super sense at work it begins with faith we'll give the Lord some praises Oh Glory to God and the same praises and worshiping the same power Hallelujah will take it to Isaac Oh Glory look you worshiping him now they will worship in a revelation in the upper room they had no fire yet they had no power yet they had no deal Pentecost fully come yet but they were praising God continually before that they saw Jesus taken up and they said bad guy without crying they say bye-bye without frustration they say Baba without depression okay the Lord some Praises because they had a revelation they had a rocking your soul they knew what was promised he said behold I send the promise of my father upon you they knew the Holy Ghost was promised they knew what Joel said because Peter said this is that that the prophet Joel speak of Jesus opened the word to them he opened the understanding to them they knew exactly what they had to receive and after 58 years you can't tell me you don't know what you had to receive if after 58 years you don't know what they receive something is wrong hallelujah praise God oh my by my experience said the Lord is the water of the word of faith that energizes the word of God missions come on please on the final pitch all right of the Lord 1951 he said shall we ball heads in just a moment he saw Heavenly Father we are so conflict tonight for the opportunity to be alive I'll be here on Earth at the closing of this world history and see these

the church will have to be exactly like his o praise God Hallelujah I'm finishing he's talking about um the pyramid right he said it uh let's skip right now now they rejected the Chief Cornerstone the Bible was rejected but now we're getting closer and closer the spirit of God has coming from justification sanification Holy Ghost that church will have to be so close and the spirit of God so perfect working in that church that when The Headstone comes it will cap it together and the resurrection will come on a way to go to church no that's just here say see is it perfect I am trying to show you a point that the church has got to come to a place to have the spirit of Christ in it the spirit of Christ operating in our bodies that is very detailed that is very specific and you're generally this
