[47:11] okay well greetings from Cameroon Africa
[47:15] we had such a tremendous time over deer
[47:19] and we should refer to God even for this
[47:22] privilege he meant to share the Word of
[47:24] God to the bride of Jesus Christ
[47:26] wherever she is and we know that's a
[47:29] bride buddy isn't that right praise the
[47:32] name of the Lord and you've got to be
[47:34] part of that buddy gotta be part not
[47:36] that - triumphant praise the name of the
[47:38] Lord and the Prophet said when a man
[47:40] fell he lost this when he lost the fall
[47:42] Christ come as a redeemer he said did
[47:44] you ever stop to think what Christ's
[47:46] redeem us for you give us everlasting
[47:48] life he brought us back into eternal
[47:50] fellowship and relationship to God to be
[47:53] sons of god and daughters of God watch
[47:55] back restored back all that animal lost
[47:58] in the fall all we don't want short
[48:01] enough we want all that Adam lost we
[48:04] want that back we don't want a short cut
[48:06] we don't want no robbery we want all
[48:09] what Jesus died for we wanted the same
[48:12] power
[48:12] Adam had the same dominion Adam had the
[48:15] same anointing Adam had the same spirit
[48:18] out of hat we want all the Adam had
[48:21] Melissa notice how the thing of it is
[48:24] since he has restored man back to
[48:27] displease man in the fall has lost his
[48:31] conscious of what father put him on here
[48:34] to do
[48:35] in other words all of the plumbing as it
[48:38] was in our brain and the outlets the
[48:42] feet has been plugged up with business
[48:45] affairs and whole life and domestic
[48:47] things is become clogged up with that
[48:50] until God can't operate through those
[48:53] channels that he made man for and when
[48:57] God placed the human body every little
[49:00] part had its place to play the teeth the
[49:03] tongue the eyes the nose God does
[49:05] everything in there to make it perfect
[49:07] in operation to make the man to live and
[49:11] if God so patent man the body of a man
[49:15] how much more he patent and says in
[49:17] order the body of Christ the church if
[49:20] God designed man's body
[49:22] he certainly designed the body of his
[49:24] son the church and he signed us to come
[49:26] together in heavenly places in Christ
[49:29] Jesus and have these supernatural
[49:31] workings of God oh let's who gives of
[49:35] the spirit such as prophecy and wisdom
[49:37] and knowledge and this of healing all
[49:39] these other different gifts is outlets
[49:41] that God let hold his power let all this
[49:44] revelation that our people not as an
[49:48] individual so much but as a unit we are
[49:51] all together one great body of believers
[49:53] and how do we get to this body this
[49:55] mystic body by one Spirit we are
[49:58] baptized into this body so friends we
[50:00] can join this church we can't join this
[50:03] body we have to get fire to pass
[50:05] baptized us into that body all glory to
[50:08] God only one Spreaker do that not one
[50:10] join in not one church it's not right
[50:12] freeze the name of the Lord praise God
[50:16] so when the Holy Spirit was given a few
[50:18] days forty days after the commission
[50:20] praise be to Jesus you love him
[50:23] for watch they were commanded by the
[50:25] Lord not to preach and do anything until
[50:27] they were into it par from 1 I know
[50:30] these men walk with Jesus talked with
[50:31] Jesus lived with Jesus but they needed
[50:33] power from on high
[50:37] not chicken with the pastor read a book
[50:39] they needed power from on high
[50:42] Oh glory to God not to have all the
[50:44] tapes and then listening to him and the
[50:46] message every day and they that's not
[50:48] the power for my mind or glory or the
[50:50] needed power from one hang they had
[50:53] Jesus living with him and they didn't
[50:55] have the power yet they have Jesus
[50:58] feeding them and they still have the
[51:00] power they have Jesus raised in the den
[51:02] around them and they still another power
[51:04] but this power was a promise of the
[51:06] Father
[51:07] Oh glory to God shouldn't move away from
[51:09] being anointed to be in place
[51:11] positionally to receive permanent power
[51:14] and I think that's what was the blame
[51:16] today for a confusion is because we
[51:19] haven't waited for the commission of God
[51:22] we have went to school and learned
[51:24] theology that's all well but theology
[51:27] here we go
[51:28] theology alone won't produce what Christ
[51:31] said it will produce even yes even the
[51:35] teaching of the word and rightly set in
[51:39] order will not produce these signs so no
[51:42] matter if you farmers if you ever such
[51:44] good wheat until the wheat has fallen to
[51:46] the ground and perish to itself it will
[51:49] never spring to new life and so it is
[51:52] with the believer no matter how well he
[51:53] is instructed until he can perish to his
[51:56] intellectuals he will never born again
[51:58] so this is not the use here this is
[52:01] something here where you're stripped of
[52:03] your human element and you'll get strip
[52:05] and they get broken praise gone and then
[52:07] God could do something special for you
[52:10] amen do you believe that almost done but
[52:13] I'm sitting on the blesses this morning
[52:14] with the word you appreciate my brother
[52:16] praise God
[52:17] young man on fire call of God elected of
[52:19] God gonna be used of God amen so the
[52:23] Prophet said here now what Joe when my
[52:25] inspiration because you had no Bible so
[52:27] these guys a holy man move by the spirit
[52:30] that nobody but they had to be moved
[52:32] by inspiration by divine inspiration and
[52:35] it's going to come back to that alone
[52:36] but we have the Bible and then the
[52:38] inspiration come upon you to move you by
[52:40] the spirit and it will take you back to
[52:42] the world isn't that right watch and the
[52:44] only nude by inspiration because you
[52:46] know this position that he was God's
[52:48] prophet and the only thing had to happen
[52:50] was for the inspiration to strike him
[52:52] and when he knowed what he said would
[52:55] happen because it was my inspiration and
[52:57] that's what the church if it is an order
[52:59] certain order it's got the mechanics
[53:01] ready it only needs the dynamics tonight
[53:03] and if we get the mechanics ready here
[53:06] we go get our hearts right the things
[53:09] that we can do follow him in every word
[53:11] solomon baptism follow him in every
[53:14] order he told us to do get every
[53:16] mechanic ready and stand there and we
[53:19] are ready for the dynamics to be lit off
[53:20] and only God can do that
[53:22] that's the drop into your heart that
[53:24] feeder see I am now healed then it don't
[53:27] make difference what circumstances is
[53:28] your healed
[53:29] anyhow because it's my feet you are
[53:32] healed
[53:33] o blessed be the name of the Lord you
[53:35] believe that praise God so what a time
[53:38] we had in Africa how the Holy Spirit
[53:39] moving such a mighty way praise be to
[53:42] God and we know the Prophet harvester
[53:44] God all the scattered word all was lost
[53:46] to the ages he has to bring it right
[53:48] back because God could only move through
[53:50] his word I want you to get that now the
[53:53] word is the conductor of the Spirit so
[53:56] if there is no word the Spirit can
[53:57] really work the logos have to be Bridget
[54:00] first for God to speak let there be so
[54:03] the would have to speak the would have
[54:05] to be in you the word is a conductor of
[54:08] the spirit that's why the secret is the
[54:10] word is in the bride but when the word
[54:12] yo-yo becomes fresh then you become part
[54:15] of the conductor of the Spirit itself
[54:18] because not just the word imprint but is
[54:21] another word become flesh in your flesh
[54:24] then you become the living word that God
[54:27] can work through this is good this is
[54:30] goodness is good
[54:32] how many one got in the woman living
[54:33] world because the word was invisible
[54:36] until it be was made flesh or give the
[54:39] Lord a shout at the beginning was the
[54:41] word the Word was with God the Word was
[54:44] God just like I see it but the word
[54:46] became flesh
[54:47] Pelham alas then you could see it a
[54:50] living world I live in faith I live in
[54:53] virtue
[54:54] I live in knowledge you read about it
[54:56] but those virtues gonna live and cook at
[54:58] under it's going to live in you or give
[55:02] the Lord a shout
[55:08] so the seven seas the blood that was
[55:12] sealed with seven seals that blood had
[55:14] to be broken that the life that was in
[55:16] the seven seals which is seven thunders
[55:18] which is seven voices Oh hallelujah
[55:21] could be released so the seven seas have
[55:23] been broken and all the life is hunting
[55:26] the seeds to connect with the life Oh
[55:29] glory that's who you are
[55:30] you can only be born again if your name
[55:33] was in that book they could only be born
[55:35] again if you are son the power coming
[55:38] become not to make you a son but because
[55:40] you are son because you have a seed in
[55:43] you you could be reborn if the Lord
[55:45] Oh God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[55:50] we have to have evidence that this book
[55:54] have been restored glory no that's Mike
[55:56] wasn't a prophet that's what that wasn't
[55:58] a witness of the Spirit and the power of
[56:00] God to demonstrate that Adams life has
[56:03] not been restored or glory dog or demon
[56:07] let me see that I'm gonna wrap up alone
[56:09] remember this don't ever forget this the
[56:12] same God that put this man a woman in
[56:14] the Garden of Eden
[56:14] no drink no liquor no rum no smoking no
[56:17] whiskey no kokino marijuana just man
[56:19] gana Eden tree of life and tree of good
[56:21] and evil and that man fell the same
[56:24] water put him in put him out
[56:27] Oh hallelujah I wanna say that the same
[56:32] God that put man in chimo don't play
[56:38] with him he is caught tonight he's the
[56:41] same yesterday today and forever and the
[56:43] fact that he gave - word the deal you
[56:45] eat thereof that day you die I've no ifs
[56:48] alive no buts

[56:52] God that policial out there wasn't money
[56:54] for four hundred years
[56:55] same God kill them make them perish just

[57:25] that the same God that blind those
[57:27] people he came unto his own his own
[57:29] received him not
[57:30] but as many as received him to them gave

[1:23:30] because they were one day closer one
[1:23:33] step closer to freedom to Liberty and
[1:23:36] this morning
[1:23:38] we are one step closer one day closer
[1:23:41] one hour closer

[1:27:16] while all this talking last week about
[1:27:17] that last week day about the seal of God
[1:27:20] and he said that there come a time when
[1:27:26] gotta give a message and that message
[1:27:29] would seal us in or seal us out and I
[1:27:33] thank God that through it all we learn
[1:27:37] to trust in Jesus and we learn to trust
[1:27:39] in God and we receive the true message
[1:27:43] hallelujah that has separated us from
[1:27:45] the world that shop when I'll come up
[1:27:47] from among my people and be not
[1:27:50] partakers of her plagues be not
[1:27:53] partakers of Babylon what is Babylon
[1:27:55] parallel confusion confusion in a
[1:27:58] message confusion in people's minds not
[1:28:01] knowing which way is left or which way
[1:28:03] is right but God give us a compass
[1:28:05] inside of our souls what is the secret
[1:28:09] the secret is the Word was in the bride
[1:28:11] the word is in the bride you didn't call
[1:28:15] yourself you didn't choose yourself but
[1:28:18] it was part that shows you it was called
[1:28:21] it for the seed inside your soul
[1:28:22] something to connect with the world when
[1:28:25] spoken hallelujah and the names on the
[1:28:28] book is the mystery of what the book is
[1:28:31] pilots calling those names so when that
[1:28:34] mystery is preached 27-ton others preach
[1:28:36] when seven voices are some inside your
[1:28:40] soul agrees with that word doesn't
[1:28:43] matter how you feel
[1:28:45] you know your condition before God calls
[1:28:48] you some of us are Baptists some of us
[1:28:50] are Methodists for us a good Catholics
[1:28:52] but let me hear that voice jesus said my
[1:28:57] sheep hear my voice a stranger's voice
[1:29:01] they will not follow we have not
[1:29:04] followed Connelly devised fables but I
[1:29:07] heard a cry of Jesus it went down pupae
[1:29:11] on my flesh it went past my bones it
[1:29:14] went to the marrow it went to the socket
[1:29:17] on my heart I heard a cry edita I'm
[1:29:21] coming mama
[1:29:22] I'm coming mama I'm coming out of this
[1:29:25] brown yard
[1:29:26] oh I cannot go back to the way things
[1:29:29] used to be to the way change was
[1:29:32] [Applause]
[1:29:40] when you hear that voice you can't go
[1:29:45] back
[1:29:46] scientists say when you experience a new
[1:29:49] thing your mind stretches your mind
[1:29:54] expands because you just learned
[1:29:56] something and the more you learn to
[1:29:59] expand and you get more of it and it's
[1:30:02] skill level rises it's impossible for
[1:30:05] you to go back to being ignorant
[1:30:07] it's impossible for you to go back to
[1:30:10] being what you are
[1:30:12] it's too late you already learned
[1:30:13] something you already experienced
[1:30:17] something it was too late to tell Elijah
[1:30:20] that he didn't feel nothing that that
[1:30:23] wasn't nothing hello when he fell the
[1:30:26] mantle drop upon his shoulder his heart
[1:30:29] expanded he felt something push out a
[1:30:35] desire it was laying dormant all the
[1:30:38] time
[1:30:38] for and for some of us we was laying
[1:30:40] dormant all the time oh but this more
[1:30:43] than I pray that a sweet anointing come

[1:43:26] church
[1:43:27] [Applause]
[1:43:29] and if you believe he's gone now brother
[1:43:33] you could pull him right next to you you
[1:43:36] could pull him right at a side of you
[1:43:37] let your fetch pull the pillow file
[1:43:41] right where you are this morning what I
[1:44:03] think sometimes and I heard a preacher
[1:44:06] say it one time he said a word it's got
[1:44:09] to be enough for you
[1:44:10] the problem is some people the word is
[1:44:13] not enough for them
[1:44:14] the word is not enough they think to
[1:44:16] keep their the word is not enough they
[1:44:19] think to hold them to all the reins and
[1:44:23] so they look for other interpretations
[1:44:25] or some new idea to split them on and
[1:44:28] keep them going getting some new
[1:44:31] sensation but this gospel is not about
[1:44:36] sensations prophet said you could scream
[1:44:39] you could holla the devil don't care
[1:44:42] about that you could scream sing till
[1:44:45] you're blue in the face
[1:44:47] devil don't care about that but when you
[1:44:50] see that holy consecrated life dedicated
[1:44:54] to God the thunderous speech the full of
[1:44:59] humility bravado said that's what we
[1:45:02] need today thousands of live Rises
[1:45:05] that's a thunder that shakes the devil
[1:45:09] the devil hates to see that consecrated
[1:45:12] life
[1:45:12] that's sanctified life to God say
[1:45:16] anything to him just as sweet as he can
[1:45:19] be I forgive you brother I love you
[1:45:22] brother
[1:45:23] he can love the unlovable because
[1:45:26] there's a real caught in his soul
[1:45:28] there's a real cord vibrates and inside
[1:45:31] of him Oh
[1:45:34] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:45:47] one thing I love more animals you know
[1:45:49] humans could talk we could talk and say
[1:45:51] yeah yeah no I care for you one thing a
[1:45:55] lot about animals is that the
[1:45:57] communicator an animal they can't talk
[1:45:59] you have to show an animal how you feel
[1:46:02] about it and I might be challenging for
[1:46:05] some people but I love how that breaks
[1:46:07] you down I love how that breaks down
[1:46:10] what's your custom you know you could
[1:46:12] see something and and use words casually
[1:46:15] or interesting or whatever but with
[1:46:18] animals is different because you gotta
[1:46:20] show them you love them and it just
[1:46:23] doesn't happen just one day but maybe
[1:46:26] over a period of time you feed him you
[1:46:28] feed him maybe he's not accustomed to
[1:46:29] you but after a while the more you feed
[1:46:31] him anymore you get used to you until
[1:46:34] after a while he knows this master he
[1:46:37] could smell your coming down the road
[1:46:38] you're kind even pull up yet but he's
[1:46:41] wagging his tail and he's excited
[1:46:43] because he knows his master is coming
[1:46:45] home
[1:46:49] and that's because you can vibrate in
[1:46:51] something to that animal to that
[1:46:56] unknowing creature even vibrating
[1:46:59] something more than words and it's got
[1:47:02] to be more than words in the sound it's
[1:47:04] got to be more than just what people say
[1:47:06] but it's got to be what you live it's
[1:47:10] got to be a life lived wah hallelujah
[1:47:13] it's got to be something vibrate out a
[1:47:15] genuine love a genuine concern a genuine
[1:47:19] forgiveness a genuine connection Oh
[1:47:22] hallelujah genuine feeling the Prophet
[1:47:26] before he pray he had to enter into the
[1:47:28] sufferance of that person whoever he was
[1:47:31] praying for he had to enter into that
[1:47:34] person until a sudden efficient prick
[1:47:37] nakhon show him something and he said
[1:47:40] just say it the Lord you shall be here
[1:47:42] or however he entered into their
[1:47:45] suffering one time a man came up on the
[1:47:47] pulpit didn't have no shoes he took his
[1:47:50] shoes off and gave it to the man and if
[1:47:54] that was a prophet then how much more
[1:47:56] ought we to live and vibrate such a life
[1:48:00] run out in sweetness and humility Oh
[1:48:04] Holly we can live something to people
[1:48:06] that people that see a real God a
[1:48:09] genuine Christian a genuine Christianity
[1:48:12] a genuine love when you pray it must be
[1:48:16] genuine I told myself one time I said I
[1:48:21] want my smile to be real and when I
[1:48:24] smile I don't want it to be a put-on I
[1:48:27] don't want it to just be a formality but
[1:48:30] I want my protection my smile to come
[1:48:32] from inside my soul I genuinely love you
[1:48:36] brother
[1:48:36] Oh hallelujah hallelujah your smiles got
[1:48:41] to be real your desires got to be real
[1:48:44] your burdens got to be real real down in
[1:48:47] your soul that's why when you come to
[1:48:49] church it's got to be real
[1:48:51] you got to genuinely want something from
[1:48:54] the law
[1:48:55] I desire moving inside your soul you
[1:48:58] know you're not what you ought to be and
[1:49:01] your comfort Elevens
[1:49:02] you throw your hands up at the altar and
[1:49:05] say lord I need the Holy Ghost
[1:49:08] I need deliverance I need freedom I need
[1:49:11] a breakthrough standing in need of
[1:49:15] prayer I need something more than what I
[1:49:18] got right now because I can't make it in
[1:49:22] this condition
[1:49:23] Oh God remember my children remember my
[1:49:26] family it's got to be real Oh hallelujah
[1:49:41] a man number you know food courts here
[1:49:43] my god Wow Wow well the Holy Spirit is
[1:49:59] here now amen enticing spirits now today
[1:50:06] so many people are listening
[1:50:08] he said now Sunday school oh he said I
[1:50:11] love it look so many people are
[1:50:14] listening to enticing spirits instead of
[1:50:17] taking the Word of God spirits there in
[1:50:21] the world and he started off talking
[1:50:23] about spirits demons in the natural
[1:50:26] demons and the supernatural but Abraham
[1:50:29] said every sickness every disease is a
[1:50:32] devil is a fourth dimension disease it
[1:50:36] coming from another dimension
[1:50:37] interacting with your human body making
[1:50:40] you feel symptoms making a few weakness
[1:50:43] and depression and frustration what is
[1:50:45] that he said those are demons and tyson
[1:50:49] spirits that's why this morning we come
[1:50:51] to rebuke every enticing spirit
[1:50:54] every force of darkness halle-loo and
[1:50:57] there's power in the church this morning
[1:50:59] the cast saw the works of darkness to
[1:51:02] throw out the enemy Oh hallelujah haha
[1:51:05] to proclaim light in this place light in
[1:51:08] you right now right now and you lift
[1:51:11] your hands right now any worship we're
[1:51:14] gonna pull out a anointing hallelujah
[1:51:21] cause is there a fight for us he said so
[1:51:31] many people listening to enticing spurns
[1:51:33] instead of taking a word of God they're
[1:51:36] demons they in the world he saying it go
[1:51:39] out in two places and they get amongst
[1:51:42] men ministers they get amongst church
[1:51:47] members they get amongst good people
[1:51:50] that's why good self at the time because
[1:51:54] the devil is still use good people to do
[1:51:57] all kinds of mischief oh I could it is
[1:52:00] the enemy of perfect so if you want to
[1:52:02] make it to this rapture perfection is
[1:52:05] required therefore perfect according
[1:52:09] call the good man he come to call a
[1:52:11] perfect man the statue of a perfect man
[1:52:15] Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:52:17] hallelujah he many many man hallelujah
[1:52:23] the perfect man is who goes into the
[1:52:25] rapture a many men hallelujah good we'll
[1:52:30] settle for half we couldn't settle for
[1:52:32] you know what's just enough but
[1:52:35] perfection wants all of it a many men
[1:52:38] all why today get a most good people and
[1:52:41] it caused them to come into an illusion
[1:52:44] and then they say things and do things
[1:52:47] and teach things and practice things
[1:52:50] that's contrary to the Word of God and
[1:52:54] he said today ministers of their
[1:52:57] congregation they allowing people to
[1:52:59] play cards on the front ain't said he
[1:53:01] said he said that's what he do is not
[1:53:03] right he said what did he tried to do he
[1:53:05] said it's substitutionary something
[1:53:07] he said they tried to adopt some new
[1:53:10] plan they tried to adopt education to
[1:53:13] take the place of the Holy Ghost he said
[1:53:16] but you'll never be able to do it no
[1:53:19] matter how well your man is educated I
[1:53:22] think it's a good thing to empty
[1:53:24] educated sure but if he hasn't got the
[1:53:27] Holy Spirit with that his education will
[1:53:30] do him no good and you can never take
[1:53:34] the place of the leadership of the Holy
[1:53:36] Spirit a man
[1:53:38] oh my notice they instead of this
[1:53:42] they've tried to adopt handshaking for
[1:53:44] the old time experience we used to house
[1:53:47] and he said the day the church has
[1:53:49] become modern they walk and give walk up
[1:53:53] and give their right hand of fellowship
[1:53:54] and that's about the way to do it but
[1:53:56] it'll never take the place of the old
[1:53:59] fashioned mourners bench where sinners
[1:54:02] call out I got right with God that's
[1:54:06] right but if I'm stand-in the Father he
[1:54:09] always come he said if you want to see
[1:54:10] visions you if you want to be right he
[1:54:14] said stay in the word he said porn works
[1:54:17] right in that word Oh huh nothing your
[1:54:21] interpretation not about what you think

[1:54:27] word because the word is a conductor of
[1:54:31] the Spirit Oh

[1:54:34] if you want the spiritual flow then
[1:54:37] you've got to be on the word it can't be
[1:54:39] ninety nine and nine-tenths it's got to
[1:54:42] be all the word what he said what he

[2:14:29] promises he can't meet you because you
[2:14:32] don't cut yourself off from him whoa
[2:14:35] that's why we preach the promises that's
[2:14:39] why we plead the promises look at
[2:14:42] Seymour look at the old Pentecostals
[2:14:43] they pleaded a promise of the Holy Ghost
[2:14:46] they believe that not only those which
[2:14:49] just as real as it was packed a noted
[2:14:51] apostles and they prayed and they cried
[2:14:54] out and they began to unknowing that
[2:14:57] promise to themselves until all of a
[2:14:59] sudden Malcolm the Holy Ghost among them
[2:15:02] how come the open door age down comes
[2:15:06] something from the Lord something he
[2:15:08] never seen before but what were they
[2:15:10] doing pleading the promises

[2:17:20] halfway God when God calls somebody out
[2:17:23] it's a totally Liveris but it takes a

[2:18:08] I've been a hot chance God was melting
[2:18:12] and molding his son Moses because I was
[2:18:15] a chopper in the - there was a
[2:18:17] commission here to fulfill and chorus
[2:18:20] obligated to meet his people on the
[2:18:23] basis of his promise and he found

[2:18:31] hallelujah and sometimes that's all God
[2:18:35] wants and somebody he could use but you

[2:19:38] about pizza Peter thought he was
[2:19:40] somebody he thought he was alright he
[2:19:44] walked on water he seen a sick heel he
[2:19:49] was with Jesus when this happening when
[2:19:51] that happened but when it just come
[2:19:53] people couldn't stand Peter didn't have
[2:19:57] what it took Peter than a habit was
[2:19:59] required an hour just stand for Christ
[2:20:03] he recognized it he recognized it when
[2:20:06] the trial come and that's what happens
[2:20:09] when the trial come all of your faults
[2:20:12] all of your feelings all of your
[2:20:15] happiness rises to the surface when the
[2:20:19] trials come whether he come then we see
[2:20:22] who's Christian and who's that Christian
[2:20:25] and he planned Church and we plan holy
[2:20:28] God will judge you you better come get
[2:20:34] it oh come on you better come with the
[2:20:37] Holy Ghost but in your heart
[2:20:40] [Applause]
[2:20:42] [Music]
[2:20:42] [Applause]
[2:20:50] and Jesus said there'd be many coming
[2:20:52] that day they did night castables out in
[2:20:56] your name did not have great healing
[2:20:59] campaigns and ministries Jesus had
[2:21:03] depart from me you workers of iniquity I
[2:21:05] didn't even know you but the people had
[2:21:09] bought their god Taylor ones you're
[2:21:12] gonna do great exploits you are gonna
[2:21:15] know him by a revelation and by an
[2:21:19] experience now pits a new amount of
[2:21:23] elation because he was able to point him
[2:21:25] out and said power to Christ son of the
[2:21:28] Living God that was genuine could Jesus
[2:21:31] had flesh and blood didn't reveal this
[2:21:33] to you nobody whispered this in your
[2:21:36] hair just now but my father in heaven is
[2:21:39] who spoke that to your heart my father
[2:21:42] in heaven is will reveal this to you
[2:21:44] after a while
[2:21:47] [Music]
[2:21:48] Jesus had to rebuke him talk about
[2:21:54] description we use the last person you'd
[2:21:58] expect to be rebuked but jesus said
[2:22:01] don't worry I'll pray for you that your

[2:22:10] that's your faith fail not when you're
[2:22:12] after your converted then you're going
[2:22:14] shrink the bredrin and there we see that
[2:22:17] there was a supernatural element that
[2:22:19] still remained despite a revelation
[2:22:22] even though Pizza knew who this man was
[2:22:24] he still needed the spirit the
[2:22:27] everlasting anointing that was upon this
[2:22:30] man to really give him what it took to
[2:22:32] stand the standard test to stand trial
[2:22:37] the stand of persecution just an
[2:22:40] hallelujah and when Jesus came and
[2:22:43] appeared to them he breathed upon them
[2:22:46] receive the Holy Ghost and he was with
[2:22:49] them thirty forty days teaching and
[2:22:52] unveiling the scripture to them opening
[2:22:55] the understanding to the scripture many
[2:22:58] things they didn't understand before but
[2:23:00] now they were having a word revival
[2:23:02] northern having a renewing in this
[2:23:04] spirit I renewed in their soul I
[2:23:07] renewing in their mind oh I understand
[2:23:10] what was taking place sorted by the time
[2:23:13] he left them they went into Jerusalem
[2:23:16] with great joy they were not sad they
[2:23:19] were not down and depressed they were
[2:23:21] not down in the dumps because Jesus had
[2:23:24] left them no they understood that same
[2:23:27] Jesus the same Holy Spirit that was upon
[2:23:30] this man was gonna come back upon their
[2:23:34] spirit upon their soul and break into
[2:23:36] them they understood the power what's
[2:23:39] gonna come something to be in tune from
[2:23:43] on high
[2:23:44] [Applause]

[2:23:55] intellectual show but something dong
[2:23:57] inside a heart a real Holy Ghost baptism
[2:24:00] a genuine experience the Bible said each
[2:24:05] one of them had a lick of L over their
[2:24:08] heads each one of them caught their
[2:24:11] portion brother I want to come into that
[2:24:14] kind of a service when we go to pray at
[2:24:17] that altar and all of a sudden don't

[2:24:23] portion
[2:24:24] I want my inheritance I want to be
[2:24:27] identified with Pete on the other side
[2:24:31] because they got this same Holy Ghost so
[2:24:33] we're talking about and if they got it
[2:24:35] you've got to have it Mary could me all
[2:24:38] eyes mother of Jesus no no she had to
[2:24:41] get the same experience that he's other
[2:24:44] brothers had she got to get the pride
[2:24:46] knocked out of her she had to get the
[2:24:48] lost Proctor knocked out of her all of
[2:24:51] the selfishness everything that she
[2:24:53] thought had to be burned out of her and
[2:24:55] the Holy Ghost had to come into our
[2:24:58] hearts the same Holy Spirit and take up
[2:25:01] residence
[2:25:03] [Applause]
[2:25:16] prophet ceremony building we always
[2:25:19] close at hand when you're gonna see
[2:25:20] something happen but somebody's gonna
[2:25:23] take place and he said it all this
[2:25:25] background here it's won't even laying a
[2:25:28] foundation for a short quick message
[2:25:31] that will shake up all nations
[2:25:34] oh do you believe it this morning amen
[2:25:37] amen
[2:25:38] I want to sing this speaker's here for a
[2:25:41] prophet I'm almost close any man misses
[2:25:43] you can get ready he said give me a
[2:25:45] preacher give me a Christian give me a
[2:25:49] housewife that's a Christian give me a
[2:25:52] farmer or factory worker that'll put God
[2:25:55] first and everything he said I'll show
[2:25:58] you a man that'll be successful in spite
[2:26:03] of all the devil could put on him he
[2:26:05] seeks God first he said we must have
[2:26:09] that he said what is it
[2:26:11] enticing spirits coming down trying to
[2:26:15] substitute solely for the Word of God he
[2:26:18] said but God has no substitute for his
[2:26:21] word hey man I got my inspiration from
[2:26:24] is that it's eternal and forever God has
[2:26:27] nothing to substitute fate God has no
[2:26:31] substitute god will never take the place
[2:26:33] of fate fate this alone it stands alone
[2:26:37] it'll never take roof could never take
[2:26:40] its place
[2:26:41] he said hope is a is there evidence of
[2:26:46] things not seen faith faith is the
[2:26:48] evidence of things not seen
[2:26:49] he said hope is one thing but faith is
[2:26:51] another he said hope hopes for it he
[2:26:55] said but faith has caught it you've
[2:26:58] already caught your healing faith
[2:27:00] declares it is a reality to you Ohayou
[2:27:04] could declare your own reality true
[2:27:07] faith
[2:27:09] Oh hallelujah I was thinking about I
[2:27:14] would reality and I was thinking of many
[2:27:17] people living their own version of
[2:27:18] reality and there's something called
[2:27:21] common reality shared reality all of us
[2:27:24] knew under these chairs our red teachers
[2:27:27] has taught us that red is the color and
[2:27:29] we all share that but then there's an
[2:27:31] old version of reality that people live
[2:27:33] in and people live by their own morals
[2:27:35] people live by their own value system
[2:27:38] what they think is important and what
[2:27:41] you think is important it's not what
[2:27:43] this other person think is important and
[2:27:45] then they've got different opinions
[2:27:47] because they live in different realities
[2:27:49] and when you go to work you have your
[2:27:52] own struggles to deal with and this
[2:27:54] other brothers got his own struggles to
[2:27:56] deal with and that's why I believe God
[2:27:58] deals with us as individuals because
[2:28:01] you're in your own little world and
[2:28:03] you've got your own things you're
[2:28:05] fighting up with but God's trying to
[2:28:07] call you out of hatch into his marvelous
[2:28:11] light into a shared reality that call is
[2:28:15] God
[2:28:16] whether he's in India whether he's in
[2:28:18] Egypt where he's in South Africa when
[2:28:21] he's in Trinidad wherever he is he is
[2:28:24] the same God everywhere
[2:28:30] hallelujah that's why it's so easy for
[2:28:36] people to go off on their own
[2:28:38] tangent go off on their own ideas go up
[2:28:42] on their own opinion because they love
[2:28:44] the old version of what they think this
[2:28:47] Bible said or what do you think the
[2:28:49] Prophet said or what they think the
[2:28:51] message said and core does not hear and
[2:28:53] none of that
[2:28:54] he said come out of her my people being
[2:28:57] a partakers of a pigs come on a
[2:29:00] confusion come out of Babylon coming
[2:29:03] into the reality that God is the same
[2:29:06] yesterday today and forever
[2:29:10] this is the only reality that any
[2:29:14] Christian should ever live in where
[2:29:17] faith is moving where Peters a substance
[2:29:20] of what you're open for when this is a
[2:29:23] reality to every brother to every sister
[2:29:26] to every wife to every home with every
[2:29:29] family every factory worker Oh
[2:29:32] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that's
[2:29:37] why he said give me a man I'll put God
[2:29:41] first and everything when God is your
[2:29:44] reality when God is your world when all
[2:29:48] you do when you wake up all the time you
[2:29:51] go to bed it's been gone all the time
[2:29:54] it's been caught taking you real that
[2:29:56] trial called taking you through that
[2:29:59] test God showing you how to do this how
[2:30:02] to walk how to hock how to hold your
[2:30:05] peace how to live like a Christian walk
[2:30:08] like a Christian talk like a Christian

[2:30:16] things right like a Christian died like
[2:30:18] a Christian I gonna ever like a
[2:30:21] Christian
[2:30:21] [Applause]
[2:30:26] hallelujah forget regular clothes I pray
[2:30:32] we come into the reality that God has
[2:30:34] for us another reality we've created for
[2:30:37] ourselves and people worshipping idols
[2:30:39] unto themselves and what they think is
[2:30:42] more important what they think ought to
[2:30:44] be spoken but we want to be like Mike
[2:30:46] ayah we want to speak only what God say

[2:58:03] wonderful we do have one prayer request

[2:58:40] sees the process the things we want
[2:58:43] anyone got to speed it up but he is
[2:58:46] looking at the process because he knows
[2:58:48] what happens at the end of the journey
[2:58:51] we wanted now but God takes us through
[2:58:53] experiences to get us in a certain spot
[2:58:57] and he was saying you know many people
[2:59:00] thank God for good health but he said
[2:59:02] your ability to thank God for good
[2:59:04] health is is really limited until you
[2:59:06] come from sickness because when you come
[2:59:10] through some sickness then good health
[2:59:12] has a new meaning to you
[2:59:15] we talk about being an amount on top of
[2:59:18] the mountain top is only as a
[2:59:19] perspective of when you've been down in
[2:59:21] the valley when you talk about the
[2:59:24] goodness of Jesus that's only a
[2:59:26] perspective that could come from when
[2:59:28] things were rough and things were not
[2:59:30] right and and now you can look back and
[2:59:32] see if it had not been for the Lord who
[2:59:34] was on my shiner so-called who is rich
[2:59:39] in grace and mercy allows us to go
[2:59:41] through divers temptations divert some
[2:59:44] through the water some through great try
[2:59:47] but all comes through the blood and
[2:59:49] whatever you're going through this
[2:59:51] morning be confident and assured that he
[2:59:53] is there all the time and he that has
[2:59:56] called you he that wrote your name in
[2:59:58] blood is more than able to finish that
[3:00:01] which he started that's the God we serve
