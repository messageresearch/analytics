[20:24] [music]
[20:32] [music]
[20:33] Just sing one more song. You're
[20:35] [singing]
[20:36] worthy of it all.
[20:41] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[20:42] &gt;&gt; said you're worthy of it all.

[21:52] to you are all things. [singing]
[21:56] You [music] deserve the gloryy.
[22:00] [singing]
[22:03] [music]
[22:09] &gt;&gt; [music]
[22:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord Jesus. [music]
[22:18] Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. Yes. [music] Thank
[22:22] you, Jesus. Blessed be your name, Lord.
[22:26] Lord, we worship you tonight. We praise
[22:29] you tonight, Lord. We lift you up
[22:31] tonight.
[22:33] [music]
[22:34] Blessed be his wonderful name. Let's
[22:36] just bow our heads a word of prayer. Oh
[22:39] heavenly father, at this time we just
[22:41] want to thank you and praise you, Lord,
[22:43] for being so good, Lord. Lord, for your
[22:46] loving kindness, for bringing us
[22:47] together in this way, Lord. Lord, we
[22:49] pray that you have your perfect
[22:50] [music and singing] way over this
[22:51] service, Lord. Everything that will be
[22:53] said, every song that was sung, that
[22:55] will be sung in the future, every word
[22:57] that will be spoken, every scripture
[22:59] that's read, Lord, I pray for everybody
[23:01] under the sound of my voice, everybody
[23:02] in this auditorium, Lord. Lord, those
[23:05] that might be at home or different
[23:06] places or may even see this content
[23:08] afterwards. I pray that your Holy Spirit
[23:10] will drop down wherever they are, Lord.
[23:12] May lives [music] be changed and
[23:14] transformed. [singing] May needs be met.
[23:16] May may hearts be restored, Lord. May
[23:19] minds be renewed, Lord. Lord, I pray
[23:21] that you inspire your people. I pray
[23:23] that you will lift them up, that you
[23:25] will raise them up, Lord, that you will
[23:26] heal, you will seal, baptize, deliver,
[23:29] Lord. Lord, I pray even as the service
[23:31] goes forth that mighty testimonies will
[23:34] come, God. Lord, Lord, wherever they
[23:36] are, Lord, Lord, you know the needs of
[23:37] your people, you know we are hungry,
[23:40] Lord. Lord, you know we are thirsty for
[23:42] more of you, Lord. Lord, we know we want
[23:44] a reality, Lord. We want a manifestation
[23:47] of your word in this hour, Lord. Lord,
[23:49] we didn't come here just to see each
[23:51] other, Lord, just to hear some words,
[23:53] Lord. But we came to be drawn closer to
[23:55] you, Lord. Lord, and we know you will
[23:58] meet us based on our faith, based on our
[24:00] expectation, Lord. Lord, have your way
[24:03] throughout this service in Jesus name.
[24:06] Amen. Amen. Amen. You love the Lord
[24:08] tonight.
[24:10] &gt;&gt; Blessed be his holy name. Thank you,
[24:12] musicians.
[24:14] Amen. At this time, we want to switch
[24:16] over.
[24:18] And if you have your Bibles,
[24:21] I'd like to invite you to one scripture.
[24:26] You love him tonight.
[24:35] &gt;&gt; I believe we in for a time. We've had
[24:37] some inclement weather. We had some a
[24:40] lot of rain this evening and tonight.
[24:43] But by God's grace, we're here.
[24:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. He chose us before the foundation
[24:47] of the world to be here right now.
[24:49] &gt;&gt; We predestinated to be here in this
[24:51] hour. Amen.
[24:54] &gt;&gt; So if you have your Bibles, I like you
[24:55] to turn with me to the book of Matthew,
[24:57] reading chapter 7 from verse 7 to 11.
[25:04] Amen.
[25:13] And it says, "Ask
[25:15] and it shall be given you."
[25:18] &gt;&gt; Seek and ye shall find.
[25:21] &gt;&gt; Knock and it shall be opened unto you.
[25:24] For everyone that askketh receiveth, and
[25:27] he that seeketh findeth, and to him that
[25:29] knockketh it shall be opened. Or what
[25:32] man is there of you, whom if his son
[25:34] asks bread, will he give him a stone? Or
[25:37] if he ask a fish, will he give him a
[25:40] serpent? If ye then, being evil, know
[25:44] how to give good gifts unto your
[25:45] children, how much more shall your
[25:48] father which is in heaven give good
[25:50] things to them that ask him.
[25:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just bow our heads. Oh
[25:55] heavenly father, we've read your word,
[25:56] Lord, and anybody could read the
[25:58] scriptures like this, Lord, but we pray
[25:59] that you would breathe life into it,
[26:01] Lord. That you would reveal it to our
[26:02] hearts, Lord. That you would open our
[26:04] understanding, Lord. Lord, that we would
[26:06] see just a little more what you have in
[26:07] store for us tonight. Lord, I pray that
[26:10] you take me out of the way and and
[26:12] inspire the words that will be shared.
[26:13] Lord, Lord, I pray that you put these
[26:15] thoughts together in the way you want it
[26:16] to be placed. Lord, Lord, I pray that
[26:18] it'd be edifying to your body. In Jesus
[26:21] name we pray. Amen.
[26:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:24] &gt;&gt; You may have your seats at this time.
[26:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:29] &gt;&gt; And just for a title,
[26:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:31] &gt;&gt; The heir of the king.
[26:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. the heir of the king. It's so
[26:37] important tonight that we have the heir
[26:39] of the king.
[26:40] &gt;&gt; So when you ask, he could respond.
[26:42] &gt;&gt; That when you ask that he hears a
[26:44] familiar voice, that he's accustom, and
[26:47] that you have that kind of relationship.
[26:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:50] &gt;&gt; For an inspiration, you have not because
[26:53] he asked not.
[26:56] So tonight we're going to talk a little
[26:59] bit, share a little bit, and look at
[27:02] this concept of asking and relationship
[27:05] and being in such a place that we know
[27:10] that our prayers will be answered.
[27:12] &gt;&gt; That we know we have faith that anything
[27:14] is possible for you.
[27:16] &gt;&gt; Not just for your neighbor, but as an
[27:18] individual. Amen.
[27:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[27:22] So I I I'll start by asking if you have
[27:24] the heir of the king. Do you have the
[27:26] heir of the king? And what does that
[27:27] really mean? It means when you have a
[27:30] request, it's recognizable and he could
[27:33] respond accordingly.
[27:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:35] &gt;&gt; That when you say, "Oh God, Lord, father
[27:38] Jesus," and you have a particular
[27:40] request
[27:41] &gt;&gt; that he could acknowledge that and he
[27:43] knows
[27:44] &gt;&gt; he doesn't have to go, you know, from
[27:45] time to time. In a natural sense, if
[27:47] somebody doesn't call you for a long
[27:49] time, you haven't spoken to somebody for
[27:50] two, three years, and they dial your
[27:52] phone and you answer, at some point,
[27:55] you're almost unsure of who it might be
[27:59] because they're not familiar
[28:00] &gt;&gt; and you ask, "Who who is this? I know
[28:03] you're you call me by name, but I'm not
[28:05] too sure who you're trying to identify
[28:08] as." Right?
[28:11] That's not the way we want to be with
[28:13] the king,
[28:14] &gt;&gt; with the king of kings and lord of
[28:16] lords.
[28:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:17] &gt;&gt; With the ruler, with the bright and
[28:20] morning star,
[28:22] &gt;&gt; with the lily of the valley, with the
[28:23] rose of Sharon, with the wheel in the
[28:25] middle of a wheel,
[28:27] &gt;&gt; with a shield and buckler, you don't
[28:28] want to play with that relationship. You
[28:30] want to know when you say, "Oh, God,
[28:33] &gt;&gt; he could answer."
[28:35] &gt;&gt; And he could hear your cry. He could
[28:37] hear your plea. He know you're sincere.
[28:39] He know you're called for a reason. He
[28:41] knows you have that kind of relationship
[28:43] in a natural sense. Again,
[28:45] &gt;&gt; can you just imagine? You have issues
[28:48] paying your rent. You have issues paying
[28:50] your bills. You have issues doing the
[28:52] things that you believe need to be done.
[28:54] &gt;&gt; But somewhere far off, you have a
[28:57] wealthy uncle. He has an estate. He has
[29:00] no children. He has more than he needs.
[29:03] He is looking for people that he
[29:05] associates with to bless them and help
[29:07] them. But you don't have relationship.
[29:10] &gt;&gt; You don't talk to him.
[29:12] &gt;&gt; That is uncle in the distance.
[29:15] &gt;&gt; At family get togethers. You don't talk
[29:17] to uncle.
[29:19] &gt;&gt; But uncle could assist you. Uncle could
[29:22] bless you in a spiritual sense. You know
[29:24] God wants to bless you more than you are
[29:26] even willing to receive.
[29:28] &gt;&gt; He wants to reward you. But you know
[29:29] what he says?
[29:30] &gt;&gt; He said without faith in Hebrews it's
[29:34] impossible to please God. Hallelujah.
[29:37] &gt;&gt; But they say he that cometh to God must
[29:40] know that he is
[29:43] &gt;&gt; believing that
[29:44] &gt;&gt; and that he's a rewarder of them that
[29:46] diligently seek him.
[29:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:48] &gt;&gt; So you have to have the right kind of
[29:50] attitude to have this relationship we're
[29:52] talking about.
[29:53] &gt;&gt; To be able to have the heir of the king,
[29:55] the king has to know who you are.
[29:57] &gt;&gt; The king in a natural sense is not just
[29:59] going to open his go his gates and open
[30:01] his doors to strangers.
[30:03] &gt;&gt; He has security details. He has
[30:05] ambushments. He has guards. He has in a
[30:08] spiritual sense angels,
[30:11] &gt;&gt; seraraphims and cherubims around
[30:14] &gt;&gt; making sure everything is in order.
[30:16] &gt;&gt; But when you as a son, as a born son, as
[30:18] a filled son, as a qualified son with
[30:21] character comes and calls upon him,
[30:24] &gt;&gt; you want to see a way made
[30:26] &gt;&gt; where there seem to be no way.
[30:28] &gt;&gt; YOU WANT TO SEE A HIGHWAY STRAIGHT TO to
[30:30] God himself
[30:32] &gt;&gt; without hindrances. So it means as he
[30:35] said when you stand praying
[30:38] &gt;&gt; if you have ought against any you have
[30:40] to forgive.
[30:41] &gt;&gt; So it means you need to remove the
[30:43] obstacles in real estate we call that
[30:45] encumbrances
[30:47] things that could easily beset you.
[30:49] Things that that could throw you off
[30:50] THINGS THAT COULD PRE PREVENT
[30:52] TRANSACTIONS from being completed.
[30:54] &gt;&gt; So when you pray you want to know that
[30:56] God could hear and God COULD ANSWER THAT
[30:59] GOD COULD RESPOND TO YOUR REQUEST. AMEN.
[31:01] That's the kind of an attitude we want
[31:03] to have because when we want to to to
[31:06] have the heir of this king, we need to
[31:08] consider who this king is.
[31:10] &gt;&gt; Who is this king of glory we talking
[31:12] about?
[31:13] &gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT ANY KIND OF KING. THIS IS
[31:16] THE KING OF KINGS. THAT'S MY KING.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE ONE I'M TALKING ABOUT. THE
[31:21] ONE THAT'S he's his he's his he's his
[31:22] he's his he's his he's his he's his he's
[31:22] his he's his he's his he's lord. HE IS
[31:23] STRONG AND MIGHTY.
[31:25] &gt;&gt; HE IS MIGHTY IN BATTLE LIKE DAVID SAID.
[31:28] HE SAID, "Lift up your heads, O gates.
[31:30] even lift them up, ye everlasting doors,
[31:32] and the KING OF GLORY SHALL COME IN. HE
[31:35] SAID, "WHO IS THE KING OF GLORY?" THE
[31:37] LORD OF HOSTS, he is the king of glory.
[31:40] So if you want to have the air of the
[31:41] king,
[31:43] &gt;&gt; there must be an approach to the king.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; There must be a way to approach. There
[31:49] must be a way to have the air of the
[31:51] king.
[31:52] &gt;&gt; He must have given instructions and
[31:55] examples and said, "Look, that's what I
[31:57] want you to do. If you want best
[31:59] results, I don't know if if I've seen
[32:01] that before, often times you see you're
[32:03] given medication or you're given
[32:05] something that you have to do and they
[32:06] say for best results take in the morning
[32:10] and last thing before bed.
[32:12] &gt;&gt; Now, it doesn't mean you can't take it
[32:14] at other times, you know,
[32:15] &gt;&gt; but for best results, you need to follow
[32:17] the instructions.
[32:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:21] &gt;&gt; That's the way God operates. He likes
[32:23] rules. He likes standards.
[32:25] &gt;&gt; He like things that you can follow.
[32:27] Amen.
[32:27] &gt;&gt; It's almost like an exact science. You
[32:29] do this and you get blessed. It reminds
[32:31] me of Cain and Abel when they were
[32:33] called upon to make a sacrifice.
[32:36] &gt;&gt; It's well known and well documented that
[32:38] Abel had a more excellent sacrifice.
[32:41] &gt;&gt; It didn't mean Cain didn't make a
[32:43] sacrifice, you know, but Abel had a more
[32:45] excellent sacrifice.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; So, it stands to reason that what Abel
[32:50] did was not just accepted by God, but is
[32:53] really what God wanted. Amen.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; When that happened, it was now easy for
[32:58] Cain
[32:59] &gt;&gt; because God could step back and say,
[33:00] "Listen, you see that there you have an
[33:03] example now."
[33:04] &gt;&gt; If you do that, you will get blessed.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; If you could follow my rules, follow my
[33:09] way cuz my thoughts higher than your
[33:11] thoughts and my ways higher than your
[33:13] ways. So you may not understand, but
[33:15] that is a revelation there. And if you
[33:17] could follow that, you will get blessed.
[33:20] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, you'll get the same
[33:21] blessing.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[33:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's the way God is. So if
[33:26] God said there's a particular approach
[33:28] if you want to approach me, I think it's
[33:30] it's reasonable and fair to think that
[33:32] we should be interested in knowing what
[33:34] that approach looks like.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; Because if we could do as God say,
[33:40] &gt;&gt; we will get the same results.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:44] &gt;&gt; Remember, he's the same yesterday,
[33:46] today, and forever. He can't lie. He
[33:48] can't fail. So if you do what's
[33:50] required, if you could fulfill his
[33:52] requirements, you get same pay.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; You remember those workers? Some would
[33:57] have started in the first hour. Some may
[34:00] have started in the third or fifth or
[34:01] ninth. But at the 11th hour when he
[34:04] said, "Listen, I have too much work and
[34:06] too few laborers." And he called the
[34:09] 11th hour laborers to work.
[34:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:12] &gt;&gt; It didn't matter what time they came.
[34:14] You know,
[34:14] &gt;&gt; they met the requirement which was come
[34:17] and assist. Come and work, come and
[34:19] labor, come do what it takes to get the
[34:22] results. And guess what? Same pay.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; It entitled you to the token.
[34:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; Because you had the requirement.
[34:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; Right. So to have the heir of the king,
[34:33] you need to have the right approach
[34:36] &gt;&gt; and the right approach is before us as
[34:38] examples. SO IF WE COULD ADOPT THAT,
[34:41] GUESS WHAT? We will have the heir of the
[34:43] king.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Bible says we have not
[34:46] because we ask not. But you know there's
[34:48] a wrong way to ask
[34:51] &gt;&gt; as a parent when my children walk up to
[34:54] me and they say
[34:56] I want juice. You stop them one time.
[35:00] That's not the way to ask. You had to
[35:02] ask better than that cuz a more
[35:04] excellent way to request something you
[35:06] might want. So it might be better to say
[35:09] can I have some juice please?
[35:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. So with God it's like that you
[35:15] could try your own thing you know but he
[35:18] has his way.
[35:19] &gt;&gt; He has a more excellent way that you
[35:21] want us to adopt in order to get the
[35:23] results because he wants to bless you
[35:26] but he wants to SEE THAT YOU ARE MATURE
[35:28] enough to take correction.
[35:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; That that that that he could prune you
[35:32] that he could trim you so you could
[35:34] bring forth more fruit.
[35:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz he don't want you just remain
[35:38] like children. Paul said, "When I was a
[35:40] child, I spake as a child and I
[35:42] understood as a child. But when I became
[35:44] a man, I put away childish things
[35:46] because I'm mature now and I could
[35:47] understand. I could I could assimilate
[35:49] and manipulate the information because
[35:53] I've been tutored.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; I've been trained.
[35:56] &gt;&gt; I've gone through some trials and some
[35:59] challenges and some experiences
[36:01] &gt;&gt; because my objective is to be perfect.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; My objective is to be like my father. My
[36:07] objective is when they come they will
[36:09] say your signature just like your
[36:11] father.
[36:12] &gt;&gt; You all think the same way, you talk the
[36:13] same way, you act the same same way. So
[36:15] when I see him, I see you.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; So if that's the the objective, we need
[36:21] to do the things it takes to get there.
[36:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; So brother Brandon preach a message the
[36:27] approach to God. And in it, paragraph
[36:30] seven here, here what he said. Now
[36:32] notice, blessed is the man whom thou art
[36:35] chosen to approach thee, that he, the
[36:37] chosen one to approach, may dwell in thy
[36:39] courts, and we will be satisfied in thy
[36:42] temple. Notice the approach to God. God
[36:45] has a way of approach.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; This is not my way.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; This is not a new doctrine or teaching
[36:50] here. This is God's way.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; He said, you know, if you're going to
[36:54] visit a king in the natural,
[36:56] &gt;&gt; there's a way you approach a king. Yeah.
[36:58] &gt;&gt; And I would say in Trinidad is a way you
[37:00] approach the prime minister or the
[37:01] president or the head of state. You will
[37:03] dress a particular way. You may operate
[37:05] a particular way. You may walk a
[37:07] particular way because you're going to
[37:08] approach a dignitary.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; In this sense, you say, well,
[37:14] make it more simpler than that. The boy
[37:16] that wants to approach a young lady to
[37:18] get acquainted with with her, there's a
[37:20] certain approach.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; So, we see in consistency. There is an
[37:24] approach if you want the result.
[37:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; You just can't come up there and say,
[37:30] "Hey, I like to meet you. I like you."
[37:34] &gt;&gt; No, it wouldn't work. So,
[37:36] &gt;&gt; she isn't very much of a lady. She let
[37:39] you know where to get on and off. All
[37:40] right. There's a certain way that you
[37:43] want to approach it. You want to come up
[37:44] with respects to the lady and so forth.
[37:47] And there's a way to approach all things
[37:49] and there's a way to approach God.
[37:51] That's where we started. And if we don't
[37:53] know the approach to God, we'll never be
[37:55] able to get an audience with God.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; Cuz it starts there. You want an
[37:59] audience with God
[38:01] &gt;&gt; because if you're not talking to God,
[38:02] who you talking to?
[38:04] &gt;&gt; Who you talking with?
[38:06] &gt;&gt; So you want an audience with God. See,
[38:09] you have to know in a court, you don't
[38:11] just walk up and the judges on the stand
[38:14] and say, "Hey, judge, I want to talk to
[38:16] you a little bit." Somebody will throw
[38:18] you out the court, be held in contempt.
[38:20] You might have to pay some extra fines
[38:22] in addition to why you were there.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; Because there's a way to approach a
[38:27] judge.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; Just like there's a way to approach a
[38:29] king.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; There's a way to approach a lady.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; So, we are concerned about the way to
[38:35] approach God.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; They lock you up for disorderly conduct.
[38:42] See, there's a way you have to approach
[38:44] a judge. And we must find a way to
[38:46] approach the great divine judge, God
[38:49] himself. Amen.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:53] &gt;&gt; When one time man through angelic beings
[38:55] perhaps when he came before the pre
[38:56] presence his majesty the great king of
[38:59] heaven perhaps approach in some other
[39:00] way. But since sin separated the
[39:03] relationship
[39:05] obviously the rules would have changed
[39:09] &gt;&gt; cuz there might have been a different
[39:10] approach you know
[39:11] &gt;&gt; but now I could tell you in advance
[39:14] &gt;&gt; the only way to approach God is through
[39:16] the blood.
[39:19] There's no other way.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; But there's a fundamental issue. The
[39:27] fundamental issue with which we are
[39:29] faced is often times people are
[39:32] challenged with how to approach,
[39:36] how to get that air and what they asking
[39:39] for.
[39:40] &gt;&gt; All right,
[39:40] &gt;&gt; those two two two challenges.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; All right,
[39:42] &gt;&gt; how and what. All right.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; You see, how speaks to preparation.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; If I tell you, I want to explain to you
[39:51] how to approach the king. There might be
[39:53] some steps involved.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; All right?
[39:55] &gt;&gt; It means you may have to prepare. You
[39:57] may take some notes. You may record it.
[40:00] You may try to perhaps role play to make
[40:03] sure you're doing it correctly because
[40:05] we talking about how.
[40:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. It have a level of faith involved
[40:13] &gt;&gt; because you can't approach without
[40:14] faith. Without faith, it's impossible to
[40:17] please God.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; And he want you to please him.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; So when you please him, he could now
[40:22] respond to you and say, "There is my
[40:25] spirit flowing freely."
[40:27] &gt;&gt; Because you're just like him.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; You're doing things the way he will want
[40:31] it done.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; It speaks to the desire to do what it
[40:37] takes to get the result.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; All right. Yes.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; Cuz you know there are some folks I
[40:41] wanted to know but I wanted bad enough.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; You mean I really had to go to the
[40:46] Jordan to be baptized?
[40:49] &gt;&gt; You mean I had to go grandandy? I had to
[40:52] go through this rain. You might want it
[40:55] but you don't want it bad enough.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; But you see when you look at how the
[41:00] approach goes,
[41:02] &gt;&gt; it speaks to our desire, our willingness
[41:05] to do whatever it takes to get the
[41:07] result.
[41:09] So having faith is one thing but you see
[41:11] it reminds me the woman with the issue
[41:12] of blood
[41:13] &gt;&gt; just as a as a backstory.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; This wasn't she feeling sick today so I
[41:18] feel I hear a crusade and I go in. No it
[41:21] wasn't that
[41:22] &gt;&gt; she had this issue as a continuous issue
[41:26] for 12 years.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; Bleeding for 12 years. That was a
[41:31] serious condition.
[41:32] What was worse is that she went and her
[41:36] medical issue was real long because she
[41:38] went doctor after doctor,
[41:41] &gt;&gt; physician after physician,
[41:43] &gt;&gt; clinic after clinic.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; She went private, she went public.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; She went private first.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; Until the money ran out,
[41:51] &gt;&gt; went public after.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; And then realized they still couldn't
[41:55] help her.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; All right.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; She knew the doctors by first name.
[42:00] But you see, the scripture said
[42:03] &gt;&gt; she then heard of Jesus.
[42:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; I'm not against the doctor, you know,
[42:09] &gt;&gt; but she perhaps didn't hear of Jesus
[42:12] before.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; Cuz then she might have been healed and
[42:14] wealthy.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; But the the money was already spent.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; So when she heard of him, it speaks to
[42:22] preparation.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; Yes. It speaks to faith
[42:26] &gt;&gt; and it speaks to having a desire to do
[42:28] whatever it took.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; The reason I say preparation is because
[42:33] she heard
[42:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; of Jesus
[42:36] &gt;&gt; and what he was doing
[42:37] &gt;&gt; and what he did.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; So she heard a testimony and she
[42:41] believed.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; That's where the faith come.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; She believed that and she told herself.
[42:46] Read the scripture yourself.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; It says, "If I could touch, that's
[42:50] right.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Not if the elder pray for me. If I So
[42:54] she took PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR HER
[42:56] ACTIONS. She said, "If I could only
[42:59] touch the hem of the garment,
[43:02] &gt;&gt; I don't need to to give him a big hug or
[43:04] a high five.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; IF I COULD JUST TOUCH THE HEM,
[43:07] &gt;&gt; I know,
[43:08] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[43:09] &gt;&gt; it's in order.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; The last part is
[43:13] &gt;&gt; Jesus wasn't doing independent viewings.
[43:16] He wasn't working by appointment,
[43:19] &gt;&gt; right? So there was a crowd around him
[43:23] &gt;&gt; and you could imagine the needs might
[43:25] have been diverse.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; This one foot hurting, this one have a
[43:30] headache, this one have a back pain.
[43:32] These three on this side, they have
[43:34] something going on. And she
[43:36] &gt;&gt; told herself that listen you see today
[43:39] &gt;&gt; you see this day, this Wednesday night
[43:41] here,
[43:42] &gt;&gt; I not going home unless I touch
[43:45] &gt;&gt; because I know IF I COULD TOUCH, THAT'S
[43:47] IT. It's settled. It's finished. I have
[43:51] no other question. I don't have to go
[43:53] anywhere else. I don't have to look to
[43:55] the left, to the right. I don't even
[43:56] need a second opinion.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; If I could just touch.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; So that's the motivation she had.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; So at that point,
[44:06] &gt;&gt; she went,
[44:07] &gt;&gt; you could imagine sometimes faith will
[44:08] build a level of excitement. Today are
[44:11] going are going because I hear Jesus is
[44:13] in tongue and are going and I are going
[44:15] to be delivered. Amen.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; And when she reach and she see the
[44:18] crowd. So
[44:19] &gt;&gt; yes,
[44:19] &gt;&gt; could imagine when you're about to leave
[44:21] home and you see the rain. So
[44:23] &gt;&gt; all of a sudden the excitement now
[44:25] starting to be conflicted and confused
[44:28] &gt;&gt; because I know tonight is my night. But
[44:30] &gt;&gt; I seeing some obstructions. I seeing
[44:33] some distractions. I seeing some
[44:34] incumbrances. I seeing some things
[44:36] TRYING TO HINDER ME FROM THE GOAL. But
[44:38] you see that last part, the desire to do
[44:40] what it takes.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; It means some through the water, some
[44:43] through the flood, some through the
[44:44] fire. Wherever you're going, all going
[44:46] through the blood, YOU KNOW, BUT YOU HAD
[44:48] TO JUMP OVER SOME. YOU MIGHT WALK and
[44:50] step aside a little bit, but you know
[44:52] the destination because you know that is
[44:56] what it takes to get the result.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; You can't get the air the king just
[45:00] staying home. You rock back home
[45:02] &gt;&gt; hoping to get healed.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; You just rock back home.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; No, but you see when you put it in the
[45:07] action like like this, guess what? She
[45:09] touch and go.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; She she she just touch and go. Jesus
[45:14] turned back and say, "Who touched my
[45:15] clothes?"
[45:17] &gt;&gt; And you know the story they say, "But
[45:19] everybody, everybody pushing, everybody
[45:21] is like a a Maxi Initiate right now.
[45:23] Everybody just trying to, you know,
[45:25] trying to reach
[45:26] &gt;&gt; and he said, "No, this one was a little
[45:28] different
[45:31] &gt;&gt; because I felt virtually leave me
[45:33] &gt;&gt; and he actually turned and addressed her
[45:36] and recognized that listen." He said
[45:38] listen go at peace
[45:42] and you'll be made whole. Now she
[45:44] already healed you know.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; But in essence he is saying I
[45:48] acknowledge that you're healed. But the
[45:50] kind of faith expressed and the things
[45:52] that you went through to reach here I
[45:54] want you to know that I know that you
[45:56] healed and I want you to know that you
[45:58] had my air because you receive and was
[46:00] able to pull from me right now and that
[46:03] is not going to impact you again.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; That's not going to come back. So you
[46:07] can afford to go your way in peace. You
[46:10] don't have to worry. You don't have to
[46:11] think about it. You don't have to wonder
[46:13] if you're going to be impacted anymore.
[46:15] This day, LISTEN, JUST LIKE THE
[46:16] Egyptians know, this is the last you're
[46:19] going to see at them forever.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; It not going to affect you again.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:24] Amen.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; So
[46:27] &gt;&gt; we're still talking about how
[46:31] &gt;&gt; that centurion was a similar story. If
[46:34] you could recall
[46:36] &gt;&gt; when
[46:37] he in the first instance
[46:41] he decided that I heard about this Jesus
[46:44] thing too.
[46:45] I may not be all familiar and chummy
[46:47] chum with him, you know, but you know
[46:49] what? I know he has the ability to
[46:51] fulfill a need that I have at home
[46:53] &gt;&gt; because this servant home that I love
[46:56] &gt;&gt; need to be healed.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; He cast sick
[46:59] &gt;&gt; and I believe.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; So you see the faith.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; I believe Jesus have what it takes to
[47:05] respond to that.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; So he said, "Listen,
[47:11] &gt;&gt; this is my story. Yes,
[47:13] &gt;&gt; my servant isn't well. He's back home.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; I really have a desire for him to be
[47:18] healed.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; But I don't even feel worthy for you to
[47:21] come under my roof.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; Cuz we are not of the same kind, you
[47:25] know.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; But
[47:27] I'm going to express something here
[47:29] that's a little different.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; I'm going to express a certain level of
[47:32] respects, a certain attitude, and a
[47:36] certain level of faith that is
[47:37] unprecedented.
[47:39] cuz he say listen I'm a man under
[47:41] authority and I tell one come and he
[47:43] come and tell one go and he go
[47:44] &gt;&gt; and I realize too that you are similar
[47:47] to me in that respect we may not be of
[47:49] the same tribe or the same ilk but what
[47:50] I could tell you is that I could
[47:52] recognize that you have a similar
[47:55] ability to tell the demons to go and
[47:57] they go
[48:00] &gt;&gt; and that's what I'm interested in
[48:02] &gt;&gt; so he was able to develop very quickly a
[48:06] unique relationship with Jesus
[48:08] &gt;&gt; to be able to relate to him in a way
[48:10] that Jesus could understand.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; And at that point,
[48:16] &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't only say that the servant
[48:19] was healed at that hour. You know, he
[48:21] said in whole in listening the whole
[48:24] country, whole of Israel, wherever he s
[48:26] he could search high, low, front, back,
[48:28] east, west, he had not seen that level
[48:31] of faith anywhere else.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the man had such a
[48:36] conviction, such a belief that he didn't
[48:40] care
[48:42] &gt;&gt; if Jesus was like him or not. He didn't
[48:44] care how it go look. He didn't care how
[48:47] it felt at that time. Well, what how it
[48:49] going to feel as a big centurion as a
[48:51] kind of boss where I am and I going and
[48:53] talk to Jesus about doing me a favor. He
[48:56] didn't care about that. Hallelujah.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; He was willing to do whatever it took
[49:01] &gt;&gt; to ensure
[49:03] &gt;&gt; that he had the air of the king.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; King Jesus was in front of him at that
[49:08] time.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; He could have gotten direct
[49:11] communication to the king at that time.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; So he had to have the right attitude.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; He couldn't just come and say, "Listen,
[49:17] I'm the big boss here." No, they call me
[49:19] senu cuz I a centurion.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; That wasn't his approach.
[49:25] He said, "I recognize
[49:28] &gt;&gt; that the same way I am under authority
[49:32] &gt;&gt; that you have a real unique relationship
[49:35] with the father
[49:36] &gt;&gt; that you could do the thing that I
[49:38] desire at this point."
[49:40] &gt;&gt; And as a matter of fact, you know,
[49:43] sometimes we say to to to butter it up.
[49:45] Listen, as a matter of fact, I am not
[49:47] even worthy for you to come to my home.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; I have a nice house, you know, but my
[49:52] house not even nice enough for you.
[49:54] Hallelujah.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; Now this is natural manner.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; This is not necessarily the people that
[50:04] going to church Sunday and Wednesday and
[50:06] Friday and you know who here in line
[50:08] upon line and word upon word. You know
[50:11] this is just a natural man in his
[50:13] position
[50:15] &gt;&gt; being able to communicate and connect
[50:18] &gt;&gt; with the king.
[50:22] Now, a very popular one we know is
[50:25] Queen, Queen Queen Esther, of course,
[50:28] &gt;&gt; and we know the backstory. At that
[50:30] point, there was a decree that
[50:33] essentially meant it could have been
[50:36] their death, could have been their
[50:37] demise, right? Morai got rid of it and
[50:40] he knew what was going to happen. And
[50:42] you say, Esther, here's what I don't
[50:44] want you to feel that you're protected
[50:45] and you're spared because of your
[50:47] position and your location and where you
[50:49] are.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; So, as they say, desperate times call
[50:53] for desperate measures. So, we need to
[50:55] do something different.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; Speaking still about approach,
[50:59] &gt;&gt; in this case in the book of Esther, and
[51:01] I want to read it directly from from the
[51:03] Bible,
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Esther 4:16, just two verses there. It
[51:06] says, "Go." And this was the instruction
[51:09] not to Esther, but this was her response
[51:12] to what Mordei encouraged her to do. She
[51:15] said, "Go gather together all the Jews
[51:17] that are present in Shushan, and fast ye
[51:20] for me, and neither eat nor drink three
[51:23] days, night or day.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; I also and my maidens will fast
[51:27] likewise, and so will I go in unto the
[51:30] king, which is not according to the
[51:32] law."
[51:34] &gt;&gt; So she knew.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[51:36] This wasn't the norm. This wasn't what
[51:40] the law said is is supposed to happen.
[51:43] So, she was taking risk.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; What does that speak to? Willing to do
[51:49] what it took. Having a desire to get the
[51:52] result and the desire was so strong, she
[51:56] went into preparation mode. She said,
[51:58] "Listen, all you're fasting for three
[52:00] days, day and night, don't eat or drink
[52:02] anything. We fasting together as a
[52:04] group. And at the end of the third day,
[52:07] I am going as an individual. Although I
[52:09] know this is not the law, I going and do
[52:11] it
[52:12] &gt;&gt; because I can't sit down and do nothing.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; I have a need
[52:17] &gt;&gt; and I want to have the air of the king
[52:20] &gt;&gt; cuz I know if I could only get the air
[52:21] of the king, my circumstance could
[52:23] change.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Everything around me could change
[52:26] tonight if I could only get the air of
[52:28] the king.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; So listen, she said, "If I perish, I
[52:32] perish." Amen.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; So Modi went his way and did according
[52:35] to all that Esther had commanded him.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; In Esther 5:1, here's what it says. Now
[52:40] it came to pass on the third day that
[52:43] Esther put on her royal apparel. Now,
[52:45] she didn't just wake out of bed and say,
[52:47] "Today the day I go in, you know, no,
[52:49] she put on her royal apparel and stood
[52:52] in the inner court of the king's house
[52:54] over against the king's house. And the
[52:57] king sat upon his royal throne in the
[52:59] royal house over against the gate of the
[53:01] house. God.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; So, she went into preparation.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; She went into listen, I want to make
[53:09] sure although this is not the law, I
[53:11] want to make sure things are in place.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; I want to make sure I am in position.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; I want to make sure I have on the right
[53:17] attire.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; I want to make sure my dress is the way
[53:21] it's supposed to be. I don't want to
[53:23] have any questionable thing going on
[53:25] that causes doubt that causes any kind
[53:28] of drama to take place outside of the
[53:31] objective I have because I want to make
[53:34] sure I have the king's undivided
[53:36] attention so the king could attend to my
[53:38] prayer to my cry to my plea to my need
[53:43] my condition. Amen.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; In verse two here's what it says. And it
[53:47] was so when the king saw Esther the
[53:49] queen standing in the court that she
[53:52] obtained favor in his sight. And the
[53:54] king held out to Esther the golden
[53:58] scepter that was in his hand. So Esther
[54:00] drew near and touched the top of the
[54:02] scepter. Then said the king unto her,
[54:05] "What wil thou, Queen Esther? And what
[54:07] is thy request?"
[54:10] Her objective was achieved. At that
[54:13] point, she had the heir of the king
[54:16] &gt;&gt; because she adopted the right approach.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Now granted,
[54:20] if you look on the surface, it looks
[54:22] like this is a suicide mission.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; This is not the law. This is not the way
[54:27] it's supposed to be done.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; This is not the way that is outlined for
[54:32] you to approach the king. But guess
[54:34] what? This time the need was great.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; The desperation was strong. And she had
[54:42] prepared, she had the faith. And similar
[54:45] to the Hebrew boys, she say, "Listen,
[54:47] I'm going in."
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause]
[54:50] &gt;&gt; If a perish, I perish,
[54:52] &gt;&gt; but are going to see the king.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; You know when they say, "Listen,
[54:57] &gt;&gt; we not even convinced that he will
[55:00] deliver us out of the fire.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; But guess what?
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Even if he doesn't deliver us, we are
[55:06] more convinced
[55:07] &gt;&gt; in who he is.
[55:10] We are more convinced in his word
[55:12] &gt;&gt; and being faithful to his promise
[55:15] &gt;&gt; that we willing to take that chance.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; So we still not bowing down.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Listen when I explore this you know what
[55:22] I realized faith don't really give exit
[55:24] clause you know you know when when I was
[55:27] younger in school we used to do pro
[55:29] programming and we used to have a a
[55:31] circle in programming called if then
[55:33] else. So if this happen then this is
[55:37] going to happen else this is going to
[55:39] happen. So it always had these kind of
[55:42] options. If you go right then you're
[55:46] faced with two options else you go some
[55:49] somewhere else. In God's word it don't
[55:52] have a exit clause. The way it does work
[55:54] is if I perish I perish. That's it.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; I going in.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; If I perish then I perish.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; It have no else. Well, I could use
[56:05] another approach or another way. No,
[56:07] this is it.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; It's God's way.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; That is what he he outlined.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; That what that that's what he put for
[56:14] us.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; That is the way he listen. He craft his
[56:17] word. It's so beautiful. It's so
[56:19] awesome. Just talking about Jesus, just
[56:22] talking about his word, his promises,
[56:24] and the things he lay out for us. It's
[56:26] amazing, you know.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In the book of Luke, it
[56:33] speaks about a woman who
[56:37] &gt;&gt; having 10 coins, she lost one.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[56:39] &gt;&gt; yeah, she lost one.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; And it says, either what woman having 10
[56:44] pieces of silver, if she lose one piece,
[56:47] do not light a candle and sweep the
[56:49] house and seek diligently till she find
[56:52] it.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; And when she had found it, she called it
[56:55] her friends and her neighbors together,
[56:56] saying, "Rejoice with me, for I have
[56:58] found the peace which I lost."
[57:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Jesus. You know
[57:04] in the beginning when I said you know
[57:08] those who seek will find.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; And we talk about asking a little bit
[57:15] just now. But in this woman's case
[57:20] she had a great need.
[57:23] Her need was to locate a missing piece.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Something she had lost. But you see, it
[57:30] was so meaningful to her. It was so
[57:33] valuable to her that they say she
[57:36] willing to light a candle and sweep the
[57:38] house and seek diligently. So she not
[57:41] looking halfway, you know.
[57:44] She not lifting up the counter, little
[57:47] couch or something, a pillow and say,
[57:49] "Are you tired?" You know, you see the
[57:51] sun hot these days. Are you able to
[57:53] search it? Best I go and buy a new one.
[57:55] Best I get a next one. If it lost, it
[57:58] lost. when it find it fine. No,
[58:00] &gt;&gt; her approach
[58:02] &gt;&gt; was listen you see today.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; I am finding this lost coin today.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; This missing piece will be found today.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; I am getting a testimony about this
[58:13] today.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; I'm not leaving it till next week and
[58:15] calling friends to come and help. She
[58:17] took personal responsibility
[58:20] &gt;&gt; for what was meaningful to her.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; So imagine your prayer prayer life.
[58:25] Imagine you have an excuse that well I
[58:28] accustom praying you know but you see my
[58:30] wife wasn't praying so I decide on not
[58:33] praying or my children was giving a
[58:35] little trouble so I decide I I'll take a
[58:37] little time off and spend some quality
[58:39] time with them. No, she didn't pass the
[58:42] responsibility, you know. She took
[58:44] personal responsibility for her need and
[58:46] decide listen whether you have to do it
[58:49] or not this is my reasonable service.
[58:53] This is what I choose to do myself as my
[58:57] personal responsibility and you after
[58:59] she found it cuz of course she was
[59:01] successful in finding it then she could
[59:03] call her friends.
[59:05] So she aligning and putting God after
[59:07] the fact. She aligning and putting her
[59:09] responsibilities after. She not taking
[59:12] it easy and after the fact she decide I
[59:14] go give a a little thing. No after she
[59:17] find it. She call her friends her
[59:19] neighbors together and say you could
[59:20] rejoice with me now. We can have a party
[59:22] now. We could lime now. Listen we could
[59:25] smile and we could enjoy each other at
[59:28] this point because I am whole. I am not
[59:30] missing any pieces. I had listen all the
[59:34] virtues
[59:35] &gt;&gt; all of them.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; I'm not missing any at all. I I I don't
[59:39] want to leave that because per adventure
[59:41] my husband come now.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; I want to have all
[59:45] &gt;&gt; per adventure God comes tonight AND SAY
[59:47] LISTEN MARKING papers tonight and he
[59:50] looks so and he tried to measure you up
[59:52] and you say well I had really planned to
[59:55] work on brotherly kindness tomorrow.
[59:59] I really planned that. As a matter of
[1:00:01] fact, I have it in a book. I have it
[1:00:03] written. I have it written in a notepad.
[1:00:05] I really plan to. No, no, no. Listen.
[1:00:07] You have to do what needs to be done
[1:00:09] first.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Take personal responsibility for those
[1:00:14] things first.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Why you think the Bible says seek first
[1:00:18] the kingdom of God
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; and righteousness and all other things
[1:00:22] shall be added
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; afterwards? You know,
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; it wouldn't be left undone. Amen.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; It will be added.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; So don't worry about it too much. But
[1:00:31] you have to make the main thing the main
[1:00:33] thing. You have to focus on the things
[1:00:35] that are important. You have to take
[1:00:37] responsibility, personal responsibility
[1:00:39] to the things that are meaningful to
[1:00:41] you.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; And meaningful to you should mean
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; it's meaningful to God.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Because you know what he said? He said,
[1:00:48] "Listen, if you love the world and the
[1:00:50] things of the world, you don't love me.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; You are my enemy. Because in essence,
[1:00:56] you keeping me away from my objective
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; because my goal is to serve him. My goal
[1:01:02] is to please him. My goal is to be close
[1:01:04] to him. My goal is to be like him. So if
[1:01:07] you throw me off that, then I should
[1:01:10] really walk away from you. Because how
[1:01:13] could two walk together? At least they
[1:01:15] agree.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; They can't.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; So, we move on a little bit and I want
[1:01:24] to just touch on the unjust judge
[1:01:26] because we talk about asking and seeking
[1:01:28] and and knocking and stuff and I
[1:01:31] wouldn't go into the whole story but but
[1:01:33] you know it
[1:01:36] really wanted this judge to avenge her.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; She wanted justice.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; She wanted equality. She wanted
[1:01:45] fairness. She wanted somebody
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; who was in a position to deal with her
[1:01:50] scenario.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; So she had to get his air.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; And the scripture went on to say, you
[1:01:57] know,
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; she really wear him down
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; because he was a mean guy.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; He really didn't have her to study.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; He didn't have to take her on.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Now this is not a license to harass
[1:02:08] folks.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; I'm just making it clear. It's not a
[1:02:11] license to it's not a license to harass
[1:02:13] folks. But you know this is how life is.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; You know you know everybody and the
[1:02:19] neighbor tell you the boss mean the
[1:02:22] neighbor mean that person mean they have
[1:02:25] an attitude they operate a particular
[1:02:26] way
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; but that is not a license for you to
[1:02:28] disrespect them.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; That's not a license for you to treat
[1:02:32] them unjustly. That's right.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; It actually opens the scenario to you
[1:02:37] for you to be lovely to them
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; for you to change the the perception,
[1:02:42] the status quo, the mindset, the
[1:02:44] approach
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; cuz they they may grow so accustomed to
[1:02:48] people believing that they are mean
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; and standoffish. They're arrogant. They
[1:02:53] have an attitude.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; But what if you respond in love?
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; What if you respond in humility?
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What if you respond in a way
[1:03:03] to relate to them?
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, it may elicit a
[1:03:08] different response to you.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; So this woman, she had a need
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; and she approached the unjust judge.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; And naturally, he had no time with her.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; That was his his mindset.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; That was his personality. That was the
[1:03:26] way he operated.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; He had no time with her. But you see,
[1:03:30] after a while,
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; after a while,
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; we talk about diligently seeking,
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; diligently knocking.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Listen, she was resolute. She wasn't
[1:03:40] giving up. She was like Jacob and the
[1:03:42] angel.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; She not, Listen, he not going and let
[1:03:45] the angel go unless he bless him. She
[1:03:48] wasn't going and let that unjust judge
[1:03:51] sleep.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; She was knocking. She was asking,
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; she was requesting. She was beseeching.
[1:03:58] She was begging. She was sending emails,
[1:04:00] text message, WhatsApp and and listen,
[1:04:03] she was writing on LinkedIn, Instagram.
[1:04:06] She make Tik Tok videos. Any way that
[1:04:08] she could reach him, she wanted to reach
[1:04:10] him because she had a need and she knew
[1:04:14] he was qualified to address it.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Switching quickly to what?
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; You see,
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; it could take whole night to talk about
[1:04:23] how
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; your approach. You must have faith. You
[1:04:28] must believe.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Especially when it looks impossible,
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; when it looks difficult, when it looks
[1:04:34] like it can't be done.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; That's the time to be certain of God.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; That's the time to see the faith
[1:04:40] expressed.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; And remember, listen, when Lazarus died,
[1:04:45] they said, "Lord, if you had been here,
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; he would not have died."
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; You know what he said? Well, he wept. He
[1:04:54] cried. He was saddened
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; because that was his friend.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; They say he loved Lazarus and his
[1:05:00] sisters Mary and Martha. But there came
[1:05:04] a point in which he said listen
[1:05:06] this is not
[1:05:08] the way you looking at it. You looking
[1:05:11] at it as as your brother died
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; but the reason this is so is because I
[1:05:17] really want God to be glorified.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; So it's not really about us here. All
[1:05:23] right.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; It's not even about showing that
[1:05:26] something could happen here. They just
[1:05:27] wait for me. No, it's not that.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; But we want God to get the glory because
[1:05:32] he's the king of glory. You know,
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; he's the king of kings.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; He is above.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause]
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; Everything you could ask or think, he
[1:05:41] bigger than that.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; The things you have need of tonight, he
[1:05:45] could fix it tonight, you know.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; But do do you have his air?
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Do you use the right approach?
[1:05:54] Hallelujah.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; In Chronicles 1st Chronicles 4:10, you
[1:05:59] have to find it. They said, "Jabz called
[1:06:02] on God of Israel, saying, "Oh, that thou
[1:06:05] wouldest blessed me indeed, and enlarge
[1:06:08] my coast,
[1:06:10] and that thine hand might be with me,
[1:06:12] and that thou wouldest keep me from
[1:06:14] evil, and it may not grieve me." And God
[1:06:18] granted him that which he requested.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, I read this scripture
[1:06:22] and it's a familiar scriptures scripture
[1:06:24] I I know
[1:06:26] something referred to as the prayer of
[1:06:28] Jabz that that you enlarge his
[1:06:31] territory, enlarge his coast,
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; enlarge what he could look over and be
[1:06:35] in control of.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; But you know what stood out to me? The
[1:06:38] fact that his prayer was so specific.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we have requests are so
[1:06:43] general. Bless me Lord and God asking
[1:06:47] you how but you done done you done pray
[1:06:50] and you walk off.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Lord I want more.
[1:06:58] So you look at you say more of what? But
[1:07:00] you listen you done prayer. You sleeping
[1:07:05] tomorrow again. Bless me Lord. You say
[1:07:09] how
[1:07:10] Lord I want more. He say you know what?
[1:07:12] Let me give them some harder trials.
[1:07:15] Yes. Because
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; I don't know if that is what you're
[1:07:18] asking for.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; But Jabus was very specific.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; He say enlarge my coast
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; and that thy hand might be with me.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; I don't want you just enlarge it and
[1:07:33] like a fish out of water trying to man
[1:07:35] manage above and beyond.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; But you see, every place I put my foot,
[1:07:39] I want to be able to manage it, too.
[1:07:41] Amen.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Cuz he who were faithful in little,
[1:07:43] faithful in much, but I don't think I
[1:07:44] could do it for myself. So I want your
[1:07:46] hand to protect me. I want you to form a
[1:07:49] hedge around me. So as I scale and as I
[1:07:52] expand, you could protect me.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Keep me humble. Keep me grounded. KEEP
[1:07:57] ME SIMPLE SO I could see you right
[1:07:59] through.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; I don't want to become puffed up and
[1:08:02] proud. I want to be able to walk as you
[1:08:06] shine the light by my feet because your
[1:08:08] word is a lamp unto my feet and a light
[1:08:10] onto my path. So I want you to say with
[1:08:13] me as we go and he say that thou would
[1:08:16] keep me from evil because I know as my
[1:08:19] co expand people might get jealous of
[1:08:21] me.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; People might be envious and may try to
[1:08:24] do wickedness. And I know the battle is
[1:08:26] not against flesh and blood but against
[1:08:29] principalities and power. So I want you
[1:08:31] to cover me
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; with a mighty hand. So not just walk
[1:08:35] with me, but protect ME THAT YOUR
[1:08:37] PRESENCE will surround me always
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; that it may not grieve me.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; And guess what? God granted his request.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Read the Bible. God granted that.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; David in Psalm 61 is a popular one.
[1:08:57] Say it. We sing it. Hear my cry, oh God.
[1:08:59] Attend unto my prayer.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; This is a man who God will say is a man
[1:09:04] after my own heart.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Attend unto my prayer.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; To the ends of the earth will I cry unto
[1:09:11] thee. When my heart is overwhelmed, lead
[1:09:14] me to the rock that is higher than I.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; For thou has been a shelter for me and a
[1:09:18] strong tower from the enemy. You see how
[1:09:20] specific?
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; I will abide in thy tabernacle forever.
[1:09:26] I will trust in the convert of thy
[1:09:28] wings. Silah, for thou, oh God, has
[1:09:31] heard my vows. Thou has given me the
[1:09:34] heritage of those that fear thy name.
[1:09:36] Thou will prolong the king's life and
[1:09:39] his years as many generations.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; He shall abide before God forever, or
[1:09:45] prepare mercy and truth, which may
[1:09:47] preserve him.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; So will I sing praise unto thy name
[1:09:51] forever.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; That I may daily perform my vows. You
[1:09:55] see how specific?
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; This is a man with the air of the king.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; I just want to skip down now.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; You see in Psalms 86,
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; I'm going to wind up just now. I don't
[1:10:12] want to be too long.
[1:10:15] From verse one, it says, "Bow down thine
[1:10:17] ear, O Lord. Hear me for I am poor and
[1:10:19] needy."
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; So this is speaking to what?
[1:10:24] So you meet the king.
[1:10:27] what you going to tell him
[1:10:30] if God is to sit right next to you and
[1:10:32] say what you have need of
[1:10:35] a haterite was given that opportunity
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; what you have need of tonight
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; where you go and say
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; thank you Jesus
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Lord I want to pay off my mortgage
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Lord I want to pay for my car
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Lord heal my foot
[1:10:52] you going to tell the king if you have
[1:10:54] his
[1:10:56] Have you ever considered that?
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; What you're meditating on,
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; what you're thinking about,
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; what you have on your heart, what you're
[1:11:06] sighing and crying about,
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; that praying about every day that you
[1:11:10] have a burden for, that you have a
[1:11:12] desire about.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; In verse two, he says, "Preserve my
[1:11:16] soul. I am holy, oh thou my God. Save
[1:11:19] thy servant that trusteth in thee. Be
[1:11:22] merciful unto me, oh Lord, for I cry
[1:11:25] unto thee daily, not monthly. You know,
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; daily. You see, when God used to come in
[1:11:32] the Garden of Eden, he did he didn't
[1:11:34] used to do a app a praisal every month.
[1:11:37] Every evening in the cooler evening, you
[1:11:39] would come. Adam, where where you at?
[1:11:41] Let's have a little chat. How things
[1:11:43] went? Everything all right? You're good.
[1:11:46] The animals good. The mountains looking
[1:11:48] nice. The trees still green.
[1:11:51] Hallelujah.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Daily.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; You know what I call that? Relationship.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; That's relationship.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; You're relating daily.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; When you have relationship, it's easy to
[1:12:07] get an air.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; It's easy to put in a request.
[1:12:12] [applause]
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Come on. We live Trinidad. Imagine you
[1:12:16] have to get something done. The first
[1:12:18] thing I'll ask who you are know working
[1:12:21] so so so
[1:12:24] if I know the person but I haven't
[1:12:26] spoken to the person for the year is not
[1:12:28] helpful to you.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; You really want to know who do you have
[1:12:33] relationship with that it could help to
[1:12:35] benefit me.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:12:38] So
[1:12:40] God in coming down in the cool of the
[1:12:43] evening, you know when he discovered
[1:12:45] that Adam was out of place.
[1:12:48] You you know when? Same day.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; You know why? The last time they spoke
[1:12:54] was the day before.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; So he knew something had to be wrong.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Now he knows
[1:13:04] what was going to happen. You know,
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; he always had a redemption plan,
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; but he also knew the day drama was going
[1:13:14] to start.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Because he had daily communion, daily
[1:13:24] conversation, daily relationship.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; David here said, "Be merciful unto me,
[1:13:30] oh Lord, for I cry unto thee daily."
[1:13:33] So you you know my voice by now cuz it's
[1:13:36] every day a crying unto you.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; Rejoice
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; the soul of thy servant. For unto thee,
[1:13:43] oh Lord, do I lift up my soul. For thou,
[1:13:47] Lord, are good and ready to forgive and
[1:13:49] plenteous in mercy unto all them that
[1:13:51] call upon thee. In verse six, hear what
[1:13:54] it says. Give heir, oh Lord, unto my
[1:13:58] prayer, and attend to the voice of my
[1:14:01] supplications. Hallelujah.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; In the day of my trouble, I will call
[1:14:05] upon thee for thou wil answer me.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; You see that there?
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; In the day of my trouble.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; You say, "I have no issue calling you."
[1:14:16] You know, because I know I will get an
[1:14:18] answer because of the relationship we
[1:14:20] have. I know you will respond.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Essentially, if I dial your phone, I
[1:14:23] know you'll pick up. I know for certain
[1:14:26] you will pick up because we good like
[1:14:28] that.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; We close. We have relationship.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Listen, I have your air.
[1:14:35] [applause]
[1:14:42] Just want to skip down a little bit
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; talking about Solomon
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; in the book of first kings.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; It says this is first kings 3:9 give
[1:14:57] therefore thy servant an understanding
[1:14:59] heart to judge thy people. This was the
[1:15:01] request of Solomon. But we talking about
[1:15:03] what we asking for. What we want to ask
[1:15:06] the king for that I may discern between
[1:15:09] good and bad. For who is able to judge
[1:15:12] this thy so great a people? It just
[1:15:16] speaks to specificity.
[1:15:18] How specific he was. He didn't just say
[1:15:25] I want I want to judge folks or I want
[1:15:27] to be a judge.
[1:15:30] No. Hallelujah.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; You say, "I want to have an
[1:15:34] understanding heart
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; to judge thy people."
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; That I may discern between good and bad.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Very specific.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; For who is able to judge this thy so
[1:15:46] great a people. In verse 10, and the
[1:15:49] speech pleased the Lord,
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; that Solomon had asked this thing.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God said unto him,
[1:15:55] because thou has asked this thing,
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; and has not asked for thyself long life,
[1:16:01] neither has asked riches for thyself,
[1:16:04] nor has asked the life of thine enemies.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Remember, you could ask for anything,
[1:16:09] you know.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; When you have the air of the king, that
[1:16:14] is where character becomes important.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Because you can ask for anything. Amen.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; You ask for sickness. You ask for debt.
[1:16:22] You ask for riches. Whatever you ask
[1:16:24] for.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; He said, "But has asked for thyself
[1:16:30] understanding to discern judgment."
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; He says, "Behold, I have done according
[1:16:36] to thy words. Lo, I have given thee a
[1:16:38] wise and an understanding heart." So,
[1:16:40] you get that?
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; So that there was none like thee before
[1:16:45] thee, neither after thee shall any arise
[1:16:47] like unto thee.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I have also given thee that
[1:16:51] which thou has not asked.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Remember God know the thoughts and
[1:16:56] intents of your heart to know.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; And out of the abundance of the heart
[1:16:59] the mouth speaks. So even the things you
[1:17:01] ask, the things you don't ask, he's
[1:17:03] still aware of it.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; He say both riches and honor so that
[1:17:10] there shall not be any among the kings
[1:17:12] like unto thee all thy days.
[1:17:15] And if thou will walk in my ways. So
[1:17:17] this is the caveat here. Now
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; so in addition to all that you get
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; he say if thou wil walk in my ways
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; to keep my statutes and my commandments
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; as thy father did walk that father being
[1:17:32] David as thy father David did walk then
[1:17:35] I will lengthen thy days.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; So you get a little caveat there. So
[1:17:41] beside all the blessing, beside all the
[1:17:43] wealth, beside all the wisdom, beside
[1:17:45] all the understanding, if you walk and
[1:17:48] follow my ways like father
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; David,
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; right? Like your father David did, I
[1:17:54] will lengthen your days too so you live
[1:17:56] long.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; What a mighty God we serve.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Musician can get ready.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:03] You know, as we close, I just want to
[1:18:06] say that God has a pro he has provided
[1:18:09] an approach.
[1:18:11] He's a He has a provided an approach
[1:18:13] tonight
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; to be able to have his air.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; As sons and daughters of God, as
[1:18:22] predestinated children of God, it must
[1:18:25] be important to you to have the air of
[1:18:27] the king.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; So at any point,
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; you could reach out Yes. Yes.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; At any point
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; he could respond
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; knowing that that's my son and all
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; I know he went through a rough time
[1:18:41] today but you know what I have a
[1:18:43] surprise for him tomorrow
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; because you have relationship
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; you're not a stranger
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; you see
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; he has an approach
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; that's through his bloodise
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; he gives an approach through his word.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; He gives an approach through his end
[1:19:06] time message.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; I want to encourage you play the song
[1:19:10] true through the blood.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; I want to encourage you tonight
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; to look at yourself
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; and see
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; as an individual
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; if you have the air of the king. Amen.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; If you have that kind of relationship
[1:19:26] with him,
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; that you could speak with him, converse
[1:19:31] with him, commune with him, have that
[1:19:33] type of relationship, like David said,
[1:19:36] he said, "Listen, in my day of trouble,
[1:19:38] I will call you cuz I know you will
[1:19:40] answer [music]
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; because we have that type of
[1:19:43] relationship." Glor.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; So it's one thing to have a oneoff
[1:19:47] heal my cousin, heal my neighbor, but
[1:19:51] when you
[1:19:53] have that personalized relationship with
[1:19:56] him,
[1:19:58] nothing could stop that.
[1:20:00] Friends can't stop that. Family can't
[1:20:03] stop that. [music]
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Neighbors can't stop that because that's
[1:20:07] something on the inside that they can't
[1:20:09] take away.
[1:20:11] As a matter of fact, he wants that for
[1:20:13] you more than you want it for yourself.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; He wants that so much that he said,
[1:20:18] "Listen, if love don't do it, conditions
[1:20:21] will."
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; He will turn your family against you,
[1:20:25] your friends against you. He will throw
[1:20:27] in a bed of sickness
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; because he wants to have that type of
[1:20:31] relationship with you tonight. May we
[1:20:33] stand?
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; You love him tonight.
