word amen we have a praise on July 17th I was taken to the monom hospital for a brain scan having a terrible experience the results was a bit confusing to to the doctor who concluded it could be a minor stroke but needed a second opinion from his senior after hearing of the readings Thursday 18th I had an appointment at the clinic it was also verified by the senior doctor that it could have been a minor stroke and with questionings my performance after exercise was given and my immediate recovery had been astonishing to them further examinations will be done as they cannot understand what could have triggered such a condition I want to give thanks to the Lord Jesus for this miraculous deliverance and thank you brother Isaac and the Saints who were offered praise for me at that time God bless you all sister oliv God bless you Sister Jun praise the name of the Lord amen oh Hallelujah we have so much to be grateful to God for amen uh this morning we want to welcome Monica

brother Isaac amen we appreciate him God bless you amen and uh just want to read a scripture could you just stand uh it's from 2 Peter 1 just want to read a scripture familiar scripture just a few words before he come and bless us with the word tonight second Peter 1 Simon Peter servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and Jesus our lord according as his divine power had given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness listen through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby are give unto us here we go exceeding let's say together great and precious promises together now that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world true lust and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience andto patience godliness andto godliness brotherly kindness andto brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ may God bless the reading of his word you may be seated and give the Lord a shout as you take your seat oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah praise God notice it didn't say by debate by discussion it says by these promises amen hallelujah we came from the same pile of sin and dirt as beings all fall short of his glory all have sinned and come short of his glory we come from the same filthy pools there is none righteous no not one so God had to promise a savior had to promise a deliverer had to come and playay a blood price that all of us could be blessed with that price all of us have an opportunity with that price sometime when you want somebody to pay something for you and they're cheap they don't want to pay it and you feel bad because you don't have the money to pay it but God want to make sure that that every man whosoever will have the ability to get the results of this price that he paid so he came and died for all for God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son for whosoever will there is not one person in this world could stop you from accessing your kingdom rights into the kingdom of God there was not one person that could stop you and and Peter said by these promises thank God that we have promises without promises where we will be tonight for example if you had all the money world but on a promise you are doomed you're still on your way to hell if you don't know Jesus you're still on your way to hell you need a promise of Deliverance a promise of the Rapture a promise of reconciliation a promise of redemption yes you need a promise is a promise why we are here we have a promise of God behold I will send you Elijah he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the father that's a promise of God behold I S the promise of my father upon you that's a promise of God you shall be filled with the Holy Ghost that's a promise of God you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost come upon you that's a promise of God you are going to be filled you are going to be sealed you are going to be healed all these are [Applause] promises Hallelujah the thing about promises it can only be held in the hands of faith not your mind but the Hands of Faith in other words when you catch a promise your testimony changes to God said so not your feelings feel no not your mind feel no no your God said so the sickness doesn't matter the trial doesn't matter by faith Abraham by faith Isaac by faith Jeff by faith Samson by faith you are here this morning by faith you Praise by faith you worship by faith you bless God by faith you believe that something great is going to happen this morning Hallelujah of course you have challenges you may be seated of course you have problems but you're struggling to service you stagger here by faith your flesh say stay home but your faith stay come your flesh say don't praise God but your faith want to worship because he is due your worship he is do your praise no blessing God will withhold from you the footstep of the righteous are ordered of the Lord God will make a way where there is no way God is a way maker God is a provider God is still a Healer God set the cap free God just take your fair away when the fair knock on the door let Faith open that door and fear going to disappear oh say Amen somebody when fear knocks on on your door rip that door open with a hand of faith and fear going to disappear oh we have to get somewhere this morning you may be seated just a few more just before the preacher comes and we have some young preachers Hallelujah they're not so young after all you know they're getting older they're coming on but my God I thank God for them amen hallelujah Fairless men Hallelujah God fairing men amen hallelujah they care what God says man what man thinks and man feels Moses comfortable life kill one Egyptian congratulations running doesn't look too good settle with family mortgage payment you're affording it things are good than God until Pillar of Fire God's appointed time to get his man activated anointed inspired for the task that lays ahead because once there's a task that God ordain you for do once there's a task that God ordain you to do he must equip and Empower you and activate you to perform what you have to do oh oh Hallelujah and I feel today each one of you gathered here have a purpose in God that the devil is trying to block from you and cut off from you and God want to reveal that to you and once you see it everything else just fall off because you're living for a higher cause a higher purpose hallelujah oh glory to God Amen you may be seated when mes got his commission he's on a donkey he has a wife somebody ask him where you going Moses he said I'm going down to Egypt to take over not not not going down to Egypt he is going down to Egypt to take over you see the take over is the purpose part where I'm going is that that's that's where I am going but there's a purpose that I'm going there I'm I'm going there for a purpose I'm not going to shake Pharaoh's hands no I'm going to let my people go I'm not coming here to comfort you in your pity party comfort you that you you have trouble with yourself I'm coming to tell you that the devil that hold you that the devil that thought you were his prisoner have to pack up shop leave we come to dismiss him today oh could we give the Lord some Praises people a one man invasion [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] means you lose your lazy bones you wake up in the morning you have something to strive for something to fight for you can't wait to get up in the morning no devil can hold you on your bed because you have something to live something to breathe something to [Applause] [Music] express when Abraham wake up in the morning and see Sarah what happening Sarah do you feel the make big pharah don't feel feel cook because pharah feeling all and every time Abraham seees Sarah she said you GNA have that baby amen and Fa sometimes she answer sometimes she don't answer because God didn't talk to her Hallelujah so she didn't have faith Hallelujah and she didn't have ambition but Abraham had faith and Abram had ambition and he could tell his wife even though she looking depressed and down out come on Sarah baby you're going to make it you said how I don't know but God said so I'm not hearing you this morning I don't know Hallelujah but God said so I don't I don't have all the mechanics of how God do do what he does but he just does what he does when God speaks to a man he give him ambition amen when God speaks to a man he gives him Faith to do it to accomplish to achieve what his purpose in life is what God called him to do and he called us to be the Church of godallah the Church of God not a Trinidad Church of God that's why you hear me say I don't represent Trinidad I represent the kingdom of the most high God there's only one kingdom yes sir and only one Lord and there's only one faiu and there's only one baptism and there's only one true message that God send by a messenger yes isn't that right so he said let us make it a purpose in our life to see that we are the church yes sir so if you begin to see you are the church or part of the church you have to say this is my church I belong to the church it's not all your church it's not them church and they across there it's not that it is our church even this church right here you have to see it's your church then if it's your church you'll be concerned about it you want to see things go well with it you want to be adding to it not taken away from it you want to empower it you want to strengthen it you want to support it because it's your church isn't that right okay so he said now watch let's let's have ambition not sit around and says uh because the Jon just want it what do we care about it if they don't do it let's do it anyhow Amen in other words if somebody don't want to sweep you sweep is want to clean you clean is want to do you do because it's your church it's your place you come to worship isn't that right Hallelujah now watch uh if the rest of the nation want to sink that's up to them we want God we want to achieve we want to have faith we want to have uh uh uh we want to have ambition I close with this Moses I'll skip that but from our Facebook page a powerful quote was placed there from heing receiving an acting I want to bring back this morning and if you haven't gone to

you under expectation this morning for God to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ask or think according to the power that worketh in US amen so I'd like to greet you this morning in the precious name of Jesus Christ I'd like to appreciate my pastor this morning but over the appreciate him amen and his stand for the message of Malachi 4 amen and what a message last week the unsealing of the vision and prophecy what a masterpiece last week if you haven't heard it you need to hear it and if you heard it you need to hear it again amen amen amen amen amen so as bov mentioned I

give yourself a a hand this morning amen and we really have to reach a point where we want to do all for the kingdom of God and and the enemy is fighting but we have to fight also the difference is the enemy is fighting a losing battle and we are fighting a winning battle we already know how this is going to end we already know how this book is going to end Satan if you didn't read the book I read the book I know the ending of the story and I know the ending of your story some of us are in the middle of the story where everything is upside down but wait till you reach the end of the story I got good news for you the ending is all right the ending of this story is all right let me give you a secret you're going to make it at the ending you're going to make it you might be under the weather right now but at the ending you're going to overcome things might look good right now but at the ending it's going to be all right you may not have the Holy Ghost right now but by the ending

somebody help me somebody help me this morning it's already started I don't know what's going to happen next and I love it when I don't know what's going to happen next because the the Holy Ghost is in control he is the one writing the story that's why the Bible calls him the author and the finisher of your faith he's the one writing the story can the church say Amen you may be seated this morning hallelujah hallelujah sometime this week I read something saying I don't know how my story is but you're going to never find the words I gave up in my story hallel you'll never find the words

hand of Praise this [Applause] morning amen hallelujah hallelujah glory to God are you ready for the word this morning if you have your Bibles will you turn to me the three portions of scripture we're going to read uh two in the Book of Psalms and we're going to read from 2 Kings Hallelujah reading Psalms 85 and verse 6 Psalms 85 and: 6 and the psalmist David says will thou not revive us again that thy people may rejoice in thee and reading Psalms 138 verse 7 Psalms 138 verse 7 though I walk in the midst of trouble thou will revive me Thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies and thy right hand shall save me and shall we go to the book of Second Kings CH 3 2 Kings 3: 16 and the Bible says and he said speaking about Elisha and he said thus sayeth the Lord make this Valley full of ditches for thus sayeth the Lord ye shall not see wind neither shall you see rain yet that Valley shall be filled with water that ye may drink both ye and your cattle and your beasts and this is but a light thing in the sight of the Lord he will deliver the moabites also into your handu and he shall Smite every fence City and every choice City and shall fell every good Tree in other words wipe them out and stop all we of water and Mar every good piece of land with stones may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word shall we bow our heads in a word of prayer gracious Heavenly Father we thank you this morning for the Holy Spirit that's here and Lord for the next few moments Lord I want to yield so completely to you that you would take over this service Lord for however long it's supposed to be father we are under expectation for the delivering power of God to drop into the church this morning Lord I'm not here to preach this morning Lord but oh God just to be an instrument that you could speak to your people father Lord may this be one of those five minute Services where the Holy Ghost will just pour out Lord Lord that's my expectation father we have lived under the ministry of the word for all these years Lord Lord let the ministry of the spirit drop down here this morning and bring life to the word of God this morning granted now in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church s amen you may be seated this morning Hallelujah so my title this morning making preparations for seven Thunder Revival amen making making preparations for a seven Thunder Revival and my subject the spirit of Revival and my inspiration dig a valley full of ditches making preparations for seven Thunder Revival so now we are under expectation for a seven Thunder Revival yes sir we are under expectation for a seven T Revival just like Simeon was under expectation to see the Christ and the Bible said that Simeon was just and devout the only way you can get the Holy Ghost is to be just and devout the 3,000 after the day of Pentecost were just and devout and the Holy Ghost Came Upon them Cornelius was just and devout and he prayed all the time a memorial when went up to heaven for his prayers so I ask you a question this morning are you looking for the seven Thunders are you looking for your promise are you looking for your prophecy because July 3rd July 4th July 5th we are looking for a seven on the Revival to break out in this island to move around the world so we are under expectation I don't know about you but I'm under expectation and when you are under expectation you got to make preparation for it that's why I'm saying this [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] of what you are supposed to receive and you catch that Revelation and begin to make preparation for it something is going to happen to you in the message expectation butam said talking about Noah so he was expecting it to rain so he made preparations for the rain oh I like that oh make preparation as long as you hear God's word then make preparation for it's going to happen and you wait under expectations but the Bram said oh that makes me start feeling religious it makes me feel religious to think now if God has promised a Revival are you with me this morning if God has promised a Revival we are going to have it we are going to have a Revival I'm not asking you this morning this is not a discussion this morning this is not a negotiation this morning if God said we're going to have a Revival you better be S we're going to have a Revival but the bandam said let's make ready for it I feel like making ready this morning for a 7 T Revival brother brandom said you may be seated move out everything get ready we are right in time he said it'll seem foolish now you might say well how is going to happen in a day like this and when all this I don't care what anything contrary is to that is wrong we can't see it I see no hope of it look like but if God said so let's do it anyhow because God said so and I see this morning Noah had to make preparations because the rain was coming Esther had to make preparations because she was going to see the king when God was ready to deliver the children of Israel he had to make preparations so he raised up Moses when God was ready to anoint a king he had to make preparations so Samuel had to go find David when God was ready to announce that he was going to come he had to make preparation so he say Isaiah let everybody know a virgin is going to conceive uh when God was ready to establish the faith he raised up Jesus Christ when God was ready to restore the faith he raised up William Barian branam and when God is ready to give the devil the final knockout punch he is preparing a [Applause] people hallelujah hallelujah and listen you may be seated in order for us to give the devil the knockout punch in order for us to finish this battle once and for all we have got to pass through a certain road to this destination and that road is a 7even ton Revival no Revival no Victory no Revival no Deliverance no Revival no restoration so we are here in Trinidad to declare Lord send the Revival send the Revival send the Revival we need a Revival hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God the father of the prodigal son he was under expectation for his son to come home so he made preparation for it he knew his son was going to come back at some point it doesn't matter how far you run once your genetic makeup is connected to your father you know it's only one place you could go back you don't belong to the devil so you might run around the devil's Kingdom for a long time but after a while there's an eagle to Eagle call and you sat to rate a minute the Bible says he came to his senses and I believe this morning some sons are coming to their senses to realize who God is to realize who they are to realize who the devil is and they are coming home and that prodigal son he made preparations you may be seated you may be seated he put a calf in a room but Anthony he said give that calf extra food give that calf extra food but we normally feed calves only two portions you say no give it a double portion I want that half overweight I want that calf extra fat why I don't I don't need to tell you why I do what I do just prepare it just prepare it and I can imagine when that father saw the son coming home he said now bring her the fatted calf start the oven cooking we're going to have roast calf we're going to have stew calf we're going to have calf on the grill we're going to have kyab calf but my son has come home and God is making preparations because some sons are coming home and we are making preparations for a seven toner Revival hallelujah amen how you feeling this morning everybody with me this morning I'm just building to something from a message making the valley full of ditches but the brandom said I'm the only way you're ever going to see your way out of whatever you're going through the only way you are ever going to see your way out of the mess that you have found yourself in the only way you're ever going to see your way out is an oldfashioned spiritual Revival where the Hallelujah of God is ringing from the bottom of your heart and an oldfashioned Holy Ghost send Revival hits the place then you begin to see things then God will begin to reveal things then you'll wonder why these real Christians are hanging on why they are praying for you am hallelujah what are you saying brother Isaac I'm saying the Revival means freedom the Revival means restoration the Revival means Redemption the Revival means Pentecost the Revival means a super Church the Revival means another Ephesians the Revival means the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Revival means Revival the Revival means Redemption the Revival means renewal the Revival mean victory is mine the Revival means City no the Revival means alanas the Revival mean you don't hear me this morning I don't know what you came to church for but I came for a 7 thund Revival the Revival means thousands of live voices walk in Trinidad walk in Europe walk in America walk in Africa that's what the Revival means you may be seated if you can if you want to say standing you could do that too this service is one of those kinds of services oldfashioned sky blue sin killing Holy Ghost Revival old fashion sky blue sin killing Holy Ghost Revival you may be seated oh I love this this morning I love this this morning it sounds like the shout of the king but the Jason the

Revival you may be seated Hallelujah you may be seated Hall I hope this morning all of you wake up because the brother brandom taught us in every church not some Churches in every Church there are three kinds of believers they are unbelievers they are make Believers and they are True Believers this morning I'm not preaching to the unbelievers we have some in the house today I'm not preaching to the make Believers we have some of those too but I know there are some True Believers I know there's some true believers who have been holding on for a long time saying Lord where is the Lord God of Elijah where is the Lord God of Malachi 4 where is the manifestation of seven live voices where is the same God the same signs the same wonders the same power the same miracles you may be seated you may be seated the devil is trembling this morning because the devil don't mind you come to church and sit dead but you know when you may be seated you know when somebody gets a coma or they get a heart attack sometime they Flatline and you have to rub the charges together and and the body jumps up the devil don't mind you come the church and sit still but if we could if if we could just have a Revival if we could hey if we could have a Revival oldfashioned sky blue sin killing Holy Ghost [Applause] Revival you may be seated Hallelujah by the time this service is over I want to see everybody on their feet by the time the service is over because this revival I'm talking about is a Revival that leads to the restoration of your youth all of you starting to lose hair like me if you're like me and you're losing your hair this revival is going to bring the hair back this revival is going to reverse at writers reverse diabetes reverse high blood pressure reverse female condition re you don't hear me this morning oldfashioned sky blue sin killing Holy Ghost Revival [Applause] you may be seated brother brandham said a Revival will cause five things it'll bring souls to Christ it will bring church back the church back to the original spiritual condition it will bring back close communion with God it will bring Fellowship among the churches and he will bring back praying for the sick anyway way outside of a Revival is politics but when the Revival does this it brings True Fellowship it will bring souls to Christ it will bring back the church to the church an alpha condition Hallelujah everybody feeling [Applause] fine I almost was I I I almost said you didn't expect this this morning but I'll be wrong because of your expectation is why we having this this [Applause] morning in the message making a valley full of ditches brother the random said that's what we need today or tonight is a good old fashion Backwoods sin killing sky blue religion yes sir by the time the Serv is over everybody all week all week this week when you meet people I want to challenge you oldfashioned sky blue sin killing Holy Ghost Revival that's the anthem for this week what are you looking for oldfashioned sky blue sin killing Holy Ghost Revival but the brand said you long to see a church where sin cannot stay in the church and I believe we're coming back to that old fashion sky blue sin killing Holy Ghost Revival GL hallu so we have established two things we need to make preparations for what you expect and we are under expectation for a Revival yes sir so we're making preparations amen for the Revival Hallelujah and I was sharing this with someone just yesterday I said you are always preparing for something your action or your inaction is preparing you for something if you have an exam to write your action should be to study for the exam so you can pass the exam if you do not study you are preparing for failure so no matter what you doing you are preparing for something when you are praying and you are just and devout you are preparing for the Holy Ghost when you don't pray when you are not just when you are not devout you are preparing for the tribulation amen am amen before the Lord brought this message to me like this I really wanted to speak on preparing for the tribulation but I T about over it I'm not sure how that's going to go over because a lot of people are preparing for the tribulation and I was in a conversation couple weeks ago about if you are not looking for the Holy Ghost you might as well have a very good tribulation survival plan if you are not desperate for the Holy Ghost to be all inside of you Hallelujah you better have a good plan to survive the tribulation Hallelujah because people take it for granted that just coming to church will prepare you for the Rapture up to yesterday somebody was s saying to me they just read the Bible and they say their prayer and in their mind that's all right that's all right if you want to go to the tribulation that's preparation for the tribulation but if you are in the bride and you are prepared for the rapture we require a bit more than that if you come to church when you want go home when you want you are actually preparing for the tribulation when a wife is not reverencing her husband I don't care how many quotes you read how many hours you pray you are preparing for the tribulation amen if you hold one or you hold one Grudge you are preparing for the tribulation and I challenge you if you want to prepare for the tribulation make sure you have a good plan three and a half years can't buy or sell without the mark hunted persecuted especially if you're a Remnant you in the church the enemy coming to get you because the bride already slipped out amen amen amen some people never thought about that it's meant to be thought-provoking you know you're in trouble when you come to church and you don't see certain people in church one day you might have just missed it that's hard to preach a brother called me some time ago when I preach a message rapturing condition and uh he called me he said but Isaac I had a problem with what you said in the service I said really he said you told the church that everybody's not going to the Rapture I said the prophet said that he said it's butam said only a few people going to make it he said it's so few they're not even going to notice the Rapture took place so should I tell everybody you all go into the Rapture when you come to church when you want you you want to cut your hair you want to wear what you want you want to play games you want to flirt with the world should I tell you you go into the Rapture no that's that our pray is that everybody gets prepared but your action determines your destination brother Bram said I don't care what you say it's what you live your life is a testimony husband love your wife you could read quotes from this morning to this evening study it exer the scripture read it in the Amplified if you don't love your wife you are preparing for the tribulation am because the Bible said full obedience to the word will entitle you to the token yes so it means the expectation of what we are supposed to do is different from the Pentecostal church it's different from the Methodist Church it's different from the Baptist Church but we are preparing for the rapture we are preparing for the resurrection and we are preparing for 7 T Revival let me get out of there from the message the third seed but bam said no that's the reason today the Revival that we're supposed to have we have denominational revivals we haven't had a real stirring no no no no no no no no no no no no don't think we got revivals we haven't oh we got millions and millions and millions of church members but not a Revival nowhere but the B said the bride hasn't had a Revival yet see there's been no Revival there no manifestation of God to stir the bride we are looking for it it'll take those seven unknown Thunders back there to wake her up again he will send it he promised it can the church say Amen you may be seated so what are you saying brother Isaac I'm saying that everyone in the message who rejected the seventh Thunders because that is what br's message he said the bride hasn't had a Revival yet it will take the seven Thunders yes sir so if it will take the seven Thunders and you don't preach the seven tunders you are not looking for any kind of a Revival the seven Thunder Revival is the prize Revival if there's no seventh Thunder Revival there will be no Rapture if there's no seven th Revival there will be no Resurrection because seven tunners will gather the bride seven tunners will give the bride Faith seven tunders will show the bride how to go and the manifestation of God the still the bride will be a manifestation of those seven Thunders Let the Church Say Amen it's always been about the seven Thunders way back before the foundation of the world that's why the sons of God was shouted for Joy they were in a seven T Revival amen that's why the devil knows he's finished this morning because the whole creation is groaning travailing for the manifestation of the sons of God in in other words the whole creation is grown in feeling for a seventh and a Revival the trees are looking for the Revival the birds are looking for the Revival the animals are looking for the Revival call me oldfashioned but I know what I want I want the oldfashioned sky blue sin killing Holy Ghost Revival you may be seated in the message influence but BR said what we've seen happen but Isaac why are you doing this this morning I am doing this because we are preparing for a 700 re B yes sir I cannot speak for any other church for any other group but as a minister in this Sovereign local church headstone Tabernacle it is my duty to God to get ready for a seven toner Revival am and I want to know this morning who's going to help me who's going to help me this morning who's going to help me because brother Bram said you may be seated what we've seen happen should put every soul into action it should make a church that would make a Revival here in Trinidad I claim it by faith here in Trinidad that people would fly in from Europe is that what's going to happen in in a few months flying from Europe to see what taking place they say there's a place in sangri Grandy called headstone Tabernacle a city called I'm reading a quote sangry Grandy there's something broke out there until the seven thunders of Revelation 10 that's not even wrote in the Bible is being manifested I'm not afraid to say it I'm not afraid to declare it we are under expectation for it Amen brother stepen glory to God you may be seated in the message it feels like we having church this morning this thing is so good you know I was thinking brother B said it won't last long it'll be here a short quick message shake the whole nation you know the Raptor could take place this [Applause] year do you know this year could be the year you planning brother said plan for 20 years but be ready for tomorrow could it be that right after July 4th July 3rd July 5th a couple days later the bride is gone brother if that takes place I'm going to be there I don't know about you but I'm making sure I have my ticket to board a raptor Express and I'm not packing any bags with me because I don't need to carry anything from here in my father's house are many mansions Jesus said I go to prepare a place where there's a lot of food I don't need clothes I don't need stress I don't need to worry about it he said all you got to have is the ticket all you got to have is the token and the seventh and the Revival will produce that environment for you to receive the Holy Ghost for 40 years You' have waited for 30 years You' have waited for 10 years you've waited you may have walked in here last week but you going to get it you may be [Applause] seated brother but the kangali I feel this morning we could have one of them 4our Services I was feeling kind of and tire when I got here this morning but oldfashioned sky blue sin killing Holy Ghost Revival I don't know how you could sleep in this kind of anointing I don't know how you can feel tired in this kind of anointing oldfashioned sky blue this kind of anointing will make a Baptist want to shout make a Jehovah Witness charge a Pulpit make a metad give you that old time religion you may be seated [Applause] from the message it is the rising of the sun with the Brom said now there has been churches churches Brides brides churches Brides brides but they have got to come one there has to come a real bride there must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the Dynamics of it make the church live move in the power of his resurrection Hallelujah the fourth seal page 304 God's word sharp two wedged sword slays him puts him right down wait till them seven Thunders utter their voices to that group who can really take the word of God and hand it there it'll slice and cut and it can close the heavens they can shut this or do that whatever they want to is that what we're looking for is that what you're on expectation for you may be seated Hallelujah I'm about to wrap with this part and just hit my text and we're going to leave with a shout a Revival is to revive the seed that's planted in you that's why we can't waste time when we come to the pulpit this is not entertainment this is preparation we don't have time to waste nor do we have services to waste that's why you can't afford to miss church Hallelujah because you're getting ready for a destination so a Revival is to revive the seeds that's planted in you so seeds had to be planted under the ministry of the word we were planting seeds for a sth and the Revival Now understand this the devil understands this principle so his only move you know when you're playing chess you have certain moves his only move was to try to plant seeds of error because when the rain falls it will only bring up seeds so the rain that's why but brandham said Revival always produces twins because the rainfall on the just and the unjust it's the seeds that in you will determine the outcome the problem is this when the rain falls it's too late to plant that's why but brandham said I am very zealous of the kind of seed I'm planting because the real rain is coming so that's why this morning we are bringing back these courts to receive the people in case you forgot about about it in casee you have not been focused on it to remind you that we have to be under expectation for our promise the rest of the message World they don't need this but you need it because we're going to the Rapture oh you you didn't hear me this morning you may be seated on this island there are 40 message churches sometime ago I heard a tape a brother spent his entire service preaching about ser and Seed the entire message on serpent seed serpent seed is not my promise serpent seed is not my inheritance you spend two and a half hours talking about serpent seed that's information that's not Revelation you can read that and come and that's why I always say anybody could preach you know take some CH some scriptures put it together but rightly dividing the word to prepare people for the Rapture that's a different Ministry that's a different Ministry but the bride cannot be deceived that's why when a word comes to you there's something that wait wait wait this food you know they say you have to eat for your blood type anybody ever heard that eat right for your blood type so if your blood type is AO certain food just work with you when you're eating food for somebody would be positive it don't feel right you never knew why you were sick for the last 20 years and you was eating whole wheat bread and really your blood don't handle whole whe bread well your blood type is not AO is not positive it's it's Jesus blood and this blood can only take certain good food so we are here to eat right for our blood type you may be seated so whenever you listen to a tape or you read some you hear somebody say something and and it don't digest you're not digesting you don't you you you eat chicken feel good you eat fish you feel good you eat beef you why you feeling something something wrong your blood type can't take it because your genetics your genes come from God and God love you so much he keeps his word wrapped up for you so when you cut a slice of this cake and slice of this thing it's like man when I eat this I don't have to worry when I eat this I don't gain weight I don't lose weight are we having a time this morning so God had to wait all these years but bam in condemnation by representation in 1960 he said no wonder God can send the Revival he's got nothing to build it on but then he goes on and say then speaking about the future he'll take individuals and build it on them individuals and declare them before the world conditional listen who stay with the word the court doesn't say then he will take this group and build it on that group then he'll take this church and build it on that church he said then he'll take individuals and build it on them individuals and declare them they don't have to declare themselves he will declare them to the world who stay with the word so situations had to come to see if there would be individuals who would stay with the [Applause] [Music] word you know and it's so interesting about staying with the word you know a lot of people it's it's it's really a tragedy how people take brother branham's message and twist it to their convenience so brother brandham said stay with your pastor he'll see you through amen but brother bam say if the man leaves the word leave the man run for your life so you have to know how to write the Divide of script your pastor taking it down teaching all kind of false Doctrine sometime ago we got an email from a brother in another country in the message preaching how you could have more than one wife stay with your pastor he will take it through are you kidding me what is the fastest shoe Nike has to to run with and some ministers use it to beat with fear stay with your pastor he see you true stay with your pastor he see you true and you're teaching the wrong thing stay with what that's why Paul gave the Supreme example he said follow me as I follow Christ in other words I'm giving you permission to mark my papers because if I stop following Christ please stop following me give us some more preachers who would teach the church follow me as I follow Christ because the moment I stop following Christ run for your life you may be seated I said it to the church before if brother oid preaches something off the word brother brandham told us how to deal with it go into the office bring the scriptures bring the quotes talk about it and if he is still persuaded and it's off the word brother I'm the first person I'm going straight to R clo hike through Tamina stay with your pastor you take it take me through what I'm trying to go to the Rapture I am following my pastor as he follows Christ that is correct teaching you may be SE it some pastors going to be shaken with this tape [Music] oldfashioned sky blue sin killing Holy Ghost Revival but the random love to see the church on the word and that's why you have to have a revelation and we going to touch it a bit later on you have to have a revelation you have to pray to be in this church you should not be in this church if you're not sure you're in this church that's right because we have never forced anybody to come to this church I'm not trying to drag come to church now come to no no no no you pray to God and ask him if this should be your home church and Bram said if you are in a church you identified with that church why Alla didn't put this in the bathroom why all you who is all are you in the church you're not in the church all right all right come on why nobody clean it why nobody clean is this your church or is not your church who's supposed to do this who suppos are you in this church or you're not in the church whose responsibility responsibility it is if you are in this church oldfashioned sky blue sin killing Holy Ghost Revival but the Bram said he longed to walk into a church and everything is in order in other words the culture of the church has to change to a oldfashioned sky blue in other words in other words you are Vigilant sir to fight to protect the word in the church and the Order of the church nobody should come into this church and upset things your sword is always drawn to protect the wood to protect the word and we have to encourage one another to stay with the word why because we want to have a Revival you may be seated in other words there's going to come an end to us standing up and speaking like this you know when the day of Pentecost come and the fire fell there was no more preaching and teaching Jesus already did that in his resurrection Ministry it was just time for fire Peter didn't have to preach To The Man by the gate called Beautiful it was just one statement silver and gold I don't have but such as I have I give it unto you that's it rise up and walk fire that's what we're talking about he was in his Revival come on now oh I don't know how I got over there I was reading this quote he'll take individuals and build it on them individuals and declare them before the world who stay with the word situations had to to come to see if there would be individuals who would stay with the word amen that's can we take some more this morning so we have established we are making preparations for our seventh and Revival so we spoke a bit about making preparations we spoke a bit about Revival now brother brandham said in that message making the valley full of ditches he said you can't have a b a ball game unless you get in the spirit of the ball game you have got to get in the spirit of it yes sir and we can never have a Revival in sheveport or anywhere else until the church gets in the spirit of Revival God can come and perform Miracles he can show wonders he can stretch forth his hand to heal the sick and The Afflicted the preacher can preach a gospel as hard as he can but they'll never be a Revival until the church gets in the spirit of Revival and that's why I want to sow these seeds in the church about the spirit of Revival because in a few months we looking for manifestation of that revival can the church say Amen let me get ready to wind down now but joy said it take my time so we're going to do a little bible study now from the book of second Kings chapter 3 and as I was studying it and I want to really encourage the church brother R him in the same message make a value full of dishes he was saying that a real Christian loves to read the Bible and a lot of people in the message they may know quot but they don't know the Bible all right all right and a lot of people who believe I'll use the word believe they were in the seventh under inspiration don't know brother bram's quotes they know phrases they know statements but they don't really understand what the entire picture is about and you have to be vigilant to stay on point I could pick five young people and ask them certain things and they can tell me the name of Jay-Z and Beyonce's baby but they can't tell me the name of Jeff Ty son and they might say well why I need to know that but if you are making preparations for the Rapture aren't you supposed to be interested in making sure you know what you need to know so we're going to do a little bible study this morning if that's all right so we in 2 Kings chapter 3 you can find if you want to follow with me or it's entirely up to you but for a background the year is around 850 BC 850 BC prior to this Israel had just gone through their transition God never wanted Israel to have any Kings it was always God leading his people and Israel came up with the brilliant idea we need a king like the amalekites like the Hittites like the jebusites like the Philistines and they picked the best looking guy the tallest guy broad his shoulders push-up situps everything dep pick Saul and while Saul is ruling God say I found a better man and God raises up King David so you have Saul then you have David then you had Solomon and these three kings had kept Israel United a lot of people don't realize that Israel actually had a major split in the Church of Israel as it was among the 12 tribes of Israel because when Solomon's son rabom was supposed to be king there was a split in Israel and Judah walked away Judah was the only tribe who resisted the reign of rabom that's why you have the lion of the tribe of Judah because after Judah split all the kings of Israel which would have been 10 tribes because Benjamin eventually joined Judah those 10 tribes almost every King was a disaster only in the tribe of Judah were they faithful to the House of David by this time King Ahab was king of Israel not of Judah King Ahab was king of Israel Judah was on their own at this point in time and the prophet at the day was Elijah and Elijah was the one we know Mount carel we know all about Elijah and go to Elijah pick a man to follow you and he drops the mantle on Elisha and Elisha became Prophet after Elijah is taken off the scene everybody with me a little bit Biblical history amen we could do more of that some of the time but take quite some time to get into that 2 Kings 3:1 now jehoram the son of Ahab began to Reign Over Israel in Samaria the 18th year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah and reigned 12 years so Ahab who we know was married to Jezebel Jezebel brother brandom calls her dog meat is the word cuz she painted her face painted face Jezebel she L makeup so all of you who love makeup brother bam call you dog meat because she brought a pagan Spirit into Israel and Jezebel and Jezebel's Union with Ahab produced jehoram yes jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign in Israel in Samaria Samaria was the capital of Israel and Jerusalem was the capital of Judah so jehoram takes over from Ahab to Reign Over Israel in Samaria while Jehoshaphat is reigning in Judah the seat of it being Jerusalem and jehoram the Bible said he wrote evil in the sight of the Lord but not like his father and like his mother what a testimony he was bad but not as bad as Ahab and Jezebel basically it was almost impossible the Bible said to be as bad as Ahab and Jezebel so jehoram takes over the kingship after Ahab and the Bible said for he put away the image of ba that his father had made so King Ahab was so backslidden was so messed up after all that God did all the years he builds an image of ba and tell Israel let's worship the image no wonder God was upset amen no wonder there had to be a mount carel shown we're in the Bible right jehoram takes over after Ahab is dead and destroys the image of B nevertheless the Bible said in verse three he cleaved unto the sins of Jobo the son of nebat which made Israel to sin he departed not there from in other words he gave up the idol worship but there were certain Pagan rituals he didn't want to give up there are number of ways to look at that because some people the moment you give up certain things from the world the enemy begins to push against you and so it was with him but butam said in making a valley full of ditches and when they went to select they got jehoram his son and her son you talk about Ahab and Jezebel now listen brother Bram now you wouldn't expect very much to come out of a marriage like that Lord so then we found that jeam had ascended to the throne he was a borderline believer just a halfway lukewarm believer so many in the world tonight jaram would just set his sail anywhere the wind blow that's the where jaram would go and that's what's the matter with the church today they set their sail to every form of Doctrine tossed about from Pillar To Post not knowing where to stand or what to do when the little Trials come up the little afflictions or away they go this way they are Methodist today Baptist tomorrow a Pentecostal next day a Lutheran the next day 7 Day Adventist Jehovah Witness in the message in the tunders Seven Seals six seals not sure fivefold no fivefold they don't know where to stand toss about borderline packing your church letter from one place another what good does it do anyhow so King jehoram listen don't get me wrong he's trying to correct what his father had done he's trying to be a Christian he's a good type of the make believer he is making an effort but he doesn't want to give up all of the sin but the fact that he's cutting ties with the Enemy and making the Right Moves the Bible said the moabites rebelled yes against Israel and Mesa king of Moab was a sheep master and rendered unto the king of Israel 100,000 lambs and 100,000 Rams with the wool but it came to pass when Ahab was dead that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel and King jehoram went out of Samaria at the same time and numbered all of Israel in other words after jaram makes an effort to clean up his act the enemy wages war against because the way Ahab did things jehoram started to upset it and the moabites rebelled and jaram went out goes outside and numbers Israel counts and realize you know what he cannot go to war with the moabites he doesn't have enough men and he forms what I call an Unholy Alliance an alliance that was not of God the Bible says he went to call Jehoshaphat who was the king of Judah and said Jehoshaphat the king of Moab has rebelled against me will you go up with me and fight the moabites and but Bram called Jehoshaphat a righteous man but I want you to listen carefully but the Brom said I want you to notice how easy it is sometimes on a little persuasion for a Christian to get in the wrong company trying to be pity well I tell you I will just go down to the pool room listen carefully young people I won't play any pool but I'll go down there I'll go to the dance with Susie because she's a good girl and I maybe I'll win s on something so but Bram brought this type with Jehoshaphat and said here's what Jehoshaphat who was a righteous man what he was supposed to do was say jehoram let me pray about it and see if we should go to war but when jehoram calls Jehoshaphat Jehoshaphat says all right I'm coming my horses are your horses my men are your men let us go to fight the moabites and they asked how are we going to go they said we're going to go through Edom go through Edom and the Bible says so the king of Israel went and the king of Judah and the king of Edom now you know there's a problem with the king of Edom because we know it's jehoram king of Israel Jehoshaphat king of Judah and we have no name for the king of Edom and the Bible said they fetch a compass of seven days journey and there was no water for the host and for the cattle that followed them in other words they go walk to the moabites these three men and after seven days they ran out of water they're on foreign ground out of the will of God wow and that's how some of us find ourselves out of the will of God hallelujah Edom the king of Edom is like you know there's this guy in the group and you're not sure why he's there one of these things just don't belong here one of these things you have jaram Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom Genesis 25:30 and Esau said to Jacob feed me I pray thee with that same red pottage for I am faint therefore his name was called Edom and Jacob sent Messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Sir the country of Edom now these are the generations of Esau who is Edom Genesis 36 thus dwelt Esau in Mount s Esau is Edom Genesis 369 and these are the generation of Esau the father of the in Mount s the relationship between Israel and Edom numbers 20 and Moses sent Messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom thus say thy brother Israel I want you to see the picture of this Unholy Alliance you have Judah who has a problem with Israel because they split since Solomon's son so they really not getting so they come together to fight the moabites and then on the way to Edom they pick up an unbeliever so you have Jehoshaphat a True Believer jaram a make believer and he pick up a unbeliever yes the had serious problem with both Israel and Judah numbers 20 and Moses sent Messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom do say thy brother Israel now remember Israel Jacob and Esau were brothers thus say thy brother Israel thou knowest all the travail that had befallen us and Edam said unto him in 18 Thou shalt not pass by me L I come out against thee with the sword so Esau's children were holding The Grudge that they had with Jacob when Jacob wrestled with the angel and end up with the Birch right all Esau children have this Grudge so you are going to war with Judah Israel and somebody who don't even like you numbers 2020 and he said thou shall go through and Edom came out against him with much people and with a strong hand so here it is you come together a group of people who were always fighting one another numbers 20:21 does Edom refuse to give Israel Passage through his border wherefore Israel turn away from him good relationship right by the time he read a book of Judges then Israel sent Messengers unto the king of Edom saying let me I pray thee pass through thy land but the king of Edom would not hearken and in like manner is sent unto the king of Moab but he would not consent and Israel in Kadesh by the time Saul is king So Saul took the kingdom over Israel and fought against all his enemies on every side against Moab who they go and fight now against the children of Ammon we'll deal with them at a later service and against Edom yes same Edom and the kings of zobah next service and against the Philistine and the Bible said whereever he turn himself he vexed them so Saul pick a fight with everybody including Edom jehoram called Jehoshaphat Jehoshaphat say where are we passing passing through Edom Edom coming with them so I want you to understand how the story is being built and the king of Israel back make believer said alas the Lord had called these three things together to deliver them into the hand of Moab make believer say well we come here we claiming this ground you we just claim ground see God are claiming his ground and no water water means Life Church dead no movement nothing going on the only spiritual Bunch the only spiritual one in the bunch Jehoshaphat says is there not a prophet of the Lord yeah that we may inquire of the Lord by him Hallelujah is there not somebody with the spirit of Prophecy the testimony of Jesus because we have found ourselves in a problem the king of Edom has no clue I don't know what God he worships Israel just took down Bal and they still have some bad practices so Jehoshaphat is the only one saying is there not a prophet in the land on Hallelujah and somebody in Israel say um here is Elisha the son of shaffat which poured water on the hands of Elijah and I love this because one chapter before Elisha gets the mantle and we know that Elijah told Elisha if you see me go you'll get what you ask for but this scripture defines a relationship between Elisha and Elijah because when we would normally preach if you see me go we would think the relationship of Elisha following Elijah but this puts it into perspective Elisha is pouring water on Elijah's hands but the Bram said that's a good Association am in other words Elisha just wasn't following Elijah Elisha was right up on the elyra you need water look you need coffee look he was right there so when Jehoshaphat say is there not a prophet in the land somebody with the testimony of Jesus they say we have somebody he says what the tape say he was right with Elijah he so wash Elijah's hands he was he was this close to Elijah he will only do what Elijah did because he was he was right there with Elijah and I asked a question this morning is there not somebody in the land with the testimony of Jesus who could bring a true report of how we can have a seven tunder Revival you may be [Music] seated Hallelujah and Jehoshaphat said in verse 12 the word of the Lord is with him to the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom still with no name went down to him and Elisha says to the king of Israel what I have to do with thee what brother brandham said his righteous indignation got stirred up they say they got Elisha so upset he was out the spirit listen brother brother brandom said a man with double portion of what Elijah had got so upset he told Israel why they go to your God or your father or your mother and ask them to help you why you why you involving me in this Ela look you see a make believer unbeliever and True Believer he say if it wasn't for Jehoshaphat I don't even talk to all you he say I don't even look and I wouldn't even see you if it wasn't because of him I thank God for some True Believers because if it wasn't for the True Believers we wasn't getting out of this [Applause] hole praise God hallelujah verse 13 and Elisha said unto the king of Israel hallelujah what I have to do with thee get thee to the prophets of thy father and to the prophets of thy mother and Elisha said in verse 14 as the Lord of host liveth in other words as the Lord of God is before whom I stand surely if it were not I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah I would not look to thee nor see thee in other words I can look at you and even seeing you that's right can the church say amen huj hallelujah Give the Lord a hand of [Applause] praise Hallelujah with the bandom said that they got elishah so upset he was out the spirit and that's why brother Adam said you have to be in the spirit of Revival to see God moving him and in 2 Kings 3:15 and he says but now this is Elisha bring me a Minstrel amen bring me a musician and it came to pass that when the minstrel played that the hand of the Lord came upon Him Hallelujah in other words I said let me get in the spirit because if I in the spirit then I could talk to the Lord for you this mixed up group this mixed up Bunch you you guys going be upset but if I get in the spirit I will Overlook that and because of jehoshaphat's being just and devout I I will seek the Lord on your behalf somebody say amen you can't hear from God unless you're in the spirit amen and as the musician played the Bible says the hand of the Lord came upon him and Elijah said thus sayth the Lord th say the Lord make this Valley full of ditches for thus say the Lord he shall not see wind neither shall he see rain yet that Valley shall be filled with water that he may drink both and your cattle and your Beast yes sir and know you're only one water but this is what a light thing in the sight of the Lord he will deliver the moabites also into your hands and ye shall Smite every fence City and every choice City and shall fell every good tree and stop all Wells of water and Mar every good piece of land with stones can the church say amen hallelujah I'm getting ready to close out can I get a A minra Hallelujah bring me a minra the musician will come up now because before the final word from the Lord they needed a little music to get in the spirit for dust at the Lord and when the atmosphere was right and when everything was in place and when Elisha was in the spirit he said th say the Lord make this Valley full of ditches because the water is coming Hallelujah somebody say amen and that's what we came to do in other words you may be seated elishah told them prepare yourself because a Revival is coming prepare yourself for a seven and a Revival the more you dig is the more water you going to get the more you dig is the more water you going to get it didn't say listen it didn't say dig on the mountain it said dig a valley full of ditches when you feeling and you're down in the valley that's when you're supposed to dig when things didn't work out dig a valley full of ditches when it looks as if there is no hope that's when you're supposed to start a dig your Valley full of ditches I know you haven't had water for S days but dig a valley full of ditches there's going to be water there is going to be water make no mistake about it there's going to be water can the Church Say Amen oh hallelujah hallelujah it didn't say dig a mountain it's when you're down in the valley that's when you need to dig when you're in trouble that's when you need to dig when you're in a mess that's when you need to dig when you've almost given up that's when you need to dig when you lost your joy that's when you need to dig when you lost your Victory that's when you need to dig when you have no water that's when you need to dig but theam said the water is life without water nothing Liv but if you have no life then the word of the Lord this morning does say the Lord make this Valley full of ditches you've been waiting on water you have a promise of water but dig this [Applause] morning Hallelujah glory to God when you come to church you are digging a ditch when you worship you are digging a ditch when you say Amen you are digging a ditch when you stand on your feet you are digging a ditch when you

we are digging for restoration we are digging for Revival we are digging for Deliverance we're going to have water we are going to have water Moab Moab thought they had you on the ropes listen Moab thought that without water you were just going to die where you were at Moab thought you were finish and I love I love what Elijah said you're not going to see rain you're not going to see wind but what is going to be there in other words I don't want Moab to know you getting water I don't want the enemy need to know because if the enemy only knows he could do great damage but not by might nor by power but by my spirit all you got to do is dig the ditch all you got to do is dig your ditch not by might nor by power but by my spirit hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated Hallelujah you may be seated it's not going to be easy digging the ground is dry it's always easier to dig when the ground is wet you can move mud you can but the ground is dry it's a drought in the land it's a famine in the land not for books and tapes but for hearing the true word of God the ground is dry it's going to be hard digging but the more you dig the more you can receive the more you dig the more you worship the more you fight the more you press the more you did you bring your shovels this morning did you bring your shovels this morning Hallelujah glory to God do we have any diggers this morning

for 7 days for 7 days there was no water for 7 days there was no water for seven days there was no water this is not one day this is not two days this is seven days I would like to think that throughout all the scripture but the brandom said no scripture contradicts itself it's all one Revelation it's one great mystery but the Bram said if you read the Bible and don't see Jesus in every scripture in every verse you need to read it again and I wonder God could have done it in 5 days he could have done eight days he could have done three days but he said for seven days they have no water for seven Church [Music] ages for seven Church ages they had a water problem for seven Church ages Wasa was playing with a pipe but when the word of the Lord comes after the 17 after the seven age after the seven messenger dig the valley because the water hallelujah hallelujah glory to God I'm about to close out but bom said in making a valley full of dishes he said that's what we got to do

kind of Victory you know he give them a total Victory he say cut down the good trees stop up their water yes turn the good soil into rocks yes break down the fence cities in other words you have been weak for 7even days but when you drink this water you're going to wipe out the moabites they're going to have no response they're going to have no reply for seven days to H you against the wall but in one day the Bible said that next day they destroy them that Water Works so [Music] fast one drink of that water of everlasting life and it will knock all the demons off of you all the moabites are
