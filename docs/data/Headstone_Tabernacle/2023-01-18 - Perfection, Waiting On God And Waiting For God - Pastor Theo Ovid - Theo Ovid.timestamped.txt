[28:11] 20 to 31 and Isaiah 64 we want to read

[28:21] amen amen amen praise God we're looking
[28:25] for more gifts more talents men that God
[28:28] would use and bless because it's a
[28:31] bright idea to come into that position
[28:33] in Christ Jesus
[28:35] okay so let's read Isaiah chapter 40.
[28:38] verse 28 has thou not known
[28:41] has Donald heard that the Everlasting
[28:43] God the Lord the creator of the ends of
[28:47] the Earth
[28:48] fainted not
[28:49] Anita is wary
[28:52] there is no searching of his
[28:54] understanding
[28:55] he given power to defeat unto them that
[28:59] have no mind he increases strength
[29:03] even the youths shall fiend and be weary
[29:06] and the young men shall utterly fall
[29:09] but they
[29:10] that wait upon the Lord
[29:12] shall renew their strength
[29:15] they shall Mount up with wings as equals
[29:17] they shall run and not be very
[29:20] they should walk
[29:21] and not faint
[29:23] Isaiah
[29:24] 64.
[29:26] this for
[29:35] for since the beginning of the world
[29:38] men have not heard
[29:40] nor perceived by the ear
[29:43] neither had the eye seen o God
[29:47] seisty what he had prepared
[29:51] for him
[29:52] that waited for him
[29:54] let us pray heavenly father I thank you
[29:57] Lord
[29:59] for the scriptures tonight and I pray
[30:01] you would interpret it to our heart Lord
[30:03] you know what Isaiah 40 means to me as a
[30:06] Young Man 17 18 years old and when you
[30:09] thunder that into my soul
[30:11] prayed and asked you to make me a young
[30:13] man that will beat on you
[30:15] and God is truly power in waiting on the
[30:19] Lord
[30:19] father made that power coming here
[30:21] tonight in Revelation inspiration and
[30:24] activate the desire of God in every
[30:25] heart granted Father and Jesus name I
[30:27] ask it
[30:29] oh praise the Lord blessed be the name
[30:32] of the Lord well
[30:35] I see this we um
[30:37] I
[30:38] I'll be working on a message but this
[30:40] came to me and I said I'll bring that
[30:42] this bring this tonight
[30:44] the title I have tonight is perfection
[30:47] waiting on God
[30:49] and waiting for God I have an
[30:52] inspiration the power of waiting on the
[30:55] Lord
[30:56] now Isaiah 40 is special to me um a
[31:00] young man
[31:01] so passionate about the scriptures and
[31:04] about a message and about reading and
[31:05] studying the word
[31:06] and I stumbled on that scripture thee
[31:09] that wait upon the Lord but that part
[31:11] the part that got me as a young man is
[31:13] when the scriptures say even young men
[31:15] shall faint
[31:16] and utterly fool
[31:18] now you know the Bible said I call you
[31:20] young men because you're strong
[31:21] so when I saw that that was rocking for
[31:24] me how could young men who's supposed to
[31:26] be strong fall
[31:29] even young men shall faint about before
[31:31] but they that weed so my prayer to God
[31:34] was Lord make me a young man that would
[31:37] wait on you
[31:39] that will return you I know Brothers
[31:41] wanted to get wife for me and everything
[31:43] I said don't go there don't go there
[31:46] go with and God's choosing on time
[31:49] and that's how it woke up with his
[31:51] Armory
[31:52] so I thank God for that tonight so I
[31:55] have a context scripture from James 1 I
[31:57] think about Anthony Struck it my
[31:58] brethren is verse two counted all joy
[32:01] when you fall into diverse Temptations
[32:04] knowing this that the train of your feet
[32:08] Wicked patience
[32:09] but let patients have a perfect work
[32:12] that you may be perfect an entire
[32:15] wanting nothing
[32:16] so genes give the key
[32:20] of what is about these trials and
[32:23] testings and these things we can't
[32:24] explain how we don't understand
[32:26] he call it when you fall in Dives and
[32:28] temptations knowing this the trying of
[32:30] your faith is what work patients
[32:32] nothing else
[32:33] your faith had to be tried to work
[32:35] patients the trying of your faith you
[32:38] have faith God had to try that to work
[32:41] patients what that is for for patients
[32:43] to have a perfect work what are these
[32:45] four that will be perfect
[32:47] so to come to Perfection you have to
[32:49] come to the child of your feet that
[32:51] patience can have its perfect work and
[32:53] patience when you could wait
[32:54] you could wait on God because you
[32:57] waiting on God when you trust him
[32:59] it means of uterus is timing in you you
[33:02] trust his order it means you trust is

[42:15] okay questions and answers
[42:18] on Hebrews
[42:20] talk to
[42:22] eternal life has no end
[42:23] because it had no beginning
[42:25] it never can die because it never was
[42:28] born
[42:28] it has no beginning of these it has no
[42:31] ending of time now the only way that we
[42:34] can live eternally
[42:36] is through receiving something that is
[42:39] eternal
[42:40] and God was before there was anything it
[42:42] was God God never had a beginning on end
[42:45] now God was this great spirit
[42:49] we pictured him
[42:50] the seven colors of the rainbow
[42:53] the bull would actually cover the Earth
[42:56] if it didn't strike the Earth it's just
[42:58] a water in a circle of the curvature of
[43:01] the earth that makes it no God is
[43:03] eternal and he was perfect

[43:26] was perfection
[43:28] so what is he saying he is saying Elohim
[43:32] spirit
[43:33] was perfection
[43:35] Elohim spirit that Perfection expressed
[43:38] which was the thought which was the gene
[43:41] was the mind of God Express itself as
[43:44] logos would
[43:46] in the beginning was the word but before
[43:48] the beginning was seven perfect Spirits
[43:50] Elohim spirit that is where we were in
[43:53] God's mind that's where we was in God
[43:56] thinking that's where Satan can't go
[43:58] back to because he only come in the
[44:00] beginning but we were before the
[44:02] beginning we were in God's mind as
[44:04] thoughts okay the Lord has shout so to
[44:07] go back to that Perfection we have to go
[44:09] back to seven spirits that means the
[44:12] seven spirits the Dynamics
[44:14] to the metallics or glory to God glory
[44:18] to God do you get it now
[44:20] let's say it again perfect love perfect
[44:22] please Perfect Joy perfect satisfaction
[44:24] all those seven spirits as beginning
[44:26] Revelation they come out was made up of
[44:29] perfection everything else outside of
[44:32] that has been something I've been
[44:33] provided from that everything
[44:35] that's why the brightest second Peter 1
[44:37] 4-7 and everything else is opposite that
[44:40] oh Gloria when you strip the bride it
[44:43] was his second Peter 147 you receive
[44:45] Faith virtue knowledge Temperance
[44:47] patience cogginess broadly kindness
[44:49] hallelujah what was reflected to seven
[44:51] angels gonna be rebuilt in a pride
[44:53] that's why the pride cannot be stopped
[44:56] that's why she'll be an invincible
[44:57] around me because every day every time
[44:59] the enemy come like a flood the spirit
[45:02] of God raised a standard what can the
[45:04] Lord and Shout in every age god with a
[45:07] standard the ox anointing the man
[45:09] Anointed The Eagle anointed the land
[45:11] anointed in every age God will

[45:54] now the only way
[45:56] that we could come back to Perfection
[45:58] is to come back with that perfection
[46:01] which is God which which is what the
[46:04] seven perfect spirits
[46:06] so somehow this bride by the clients
[46:08] have to come from this weird weird
[46:11] and we have to connect with the spirit
[46:13] because the argument with Lucifer is in
[46:16] the beginning
[46:18] when you go before the beginning he can
[46:20] argue
[46:21] he can't talk you have to shut up
[46:24] because you know nothing back there

[46:47] your God in the back part of his mind
[46:49] that's why he can slay the lamb and the
[46:52] back part of his mind or glory to God
[46:54] and put your name in their blood section
[46:56] the lamb section
[46:58] cannot be erased

[1:02:40] of the Harvest you pray to me that I

[1:02:48] always there that God has written today
[1:02:50] for the people to call his servants the
[1:02:52] action and the servant can't get into
[1:02:54] action till the people pray now this is
[1:02:57] powerful because he said no minutes like
[1:02:59] a bigger Revival the Republicans that
[1:03:01] come by the people so if I present
[1:03:03] myself as the man of the hour and the
[1:03:05] only man and the right man what do you
[1:03:07] get you could sit back on your laurels
[1:03:08] and you'll wait for your wafer
[1:03:12] but you have to understand
[1:03:14] he said right to vision habakkuk
[1:03:16] make it clean that he that read it could
[1:03:20] run
[1:03:21] so brother Branham came and wrote the
[1:03:22] vision and a five-fold Ministry come to
[1:03:24] make it plain that's you the people
[1:03:26] could see it read it understand it and
[1:03:30] act on it if you're not running
[1:03:32] something is wrong you better run for
[1:03:34] your life you better run into the Holy
[1:03:36] Ghost you better run for Revival Oh
[1:03:39] Glory to God you hear it you recognize
[1:03:41] it and they're gonna act on it Oh Glory
[1:03:43] to culture God is waiting today for the
[1:03:45] people to call his servants into action
[1:03:47] and the servant can't get into action
[1:03:49] until the people pray he said no watch
[1:03:51] Israel could not get into action down
[1:03:52] there with signs and wonders until they
[1:03:54] fell on their face and prayed for
[1:03:56] deliverer God had his deliverer God had
[1:03:59] a prophet hanging up their novenness
[1:04:01] Captain there for 40 years waiting for
[1:04:02] them to get right to pray
[1:04:06] so the longer they say the praise the
[1:04:08] Lord
[1:04:10] but when they got right and start
[1:04:12] praying I like that when you get it
[1:04:14] right so you see when they get a room
[1:04:15] you're not breathing
[1:04:17] when they get right just out of my brain
[1:04:19] yeah
[1:04:20] so all do not bring something wrong
[1:04:27] still silly wood
[1:04:29] he said when they got Right and started
[1:04:31] praying
[1:04:33] so anytime you're getting right they
[1:04:34] will start to pray
[1:04:37] that's a good one
[1:04:38] when you're getting right it was not to
[1:04:40] pray when you're on the wrong side
[1:04:43] you're watching Facebook and what's that
[1:04:48] then God sent the deliverer God will do
[1:04:52] the same thing today if the people will
[1:04:54] just get together
[1:04:55] and get the praying that's why we want
[1:04:56] to push for Saturday five and six power
[1:04:59] one Dynamic no exaltation no nothing
[1:05:02] being read just come and pump
[1:05:05] praise God and Christ unto God one hour
[1:05:08] Oh Glory to God hallelujah thank you
[1:05:12] Lord
[1:05:15] traditions in them days the great
[1:05:16] prophet cried and said you all
[1:05:17] Traditions are powerless they stink
[1:05:19] before me have no faith in them the
[1:05:21] people was offering this offering
[1:05:22] without even having a fit what they were
[1:05:24] doing now let's just ask yourself the
[1:05:27] question isn't that something like today
[1:05:29] as bad as we hate the seed we have got
[1:05:31] to face facts somewhere there is
[1:05:33] something wrong somewhere
[1:05:35] he said why this just ought to be a
[1:05:36] million miles up the road the way it is
[1:05:38] now
[1:05:39] Jesus is waiting on his church to get
[1:05:41] ready
[1:05:42] and he called the scripture is bright
[1:05:43] has made itself ready we got the
[1:05:45] potentials
[1:05:48] God is here
[1:05:49] the power to heal the sick the power to
[1:05:51] do all these things that Christ did I
[1:05:53] have seen it demonstrated Myself by the
[1:05:55] holy spirit so the potentials is here
[1:05:57] what God is waiting for us to get away
[1:06:00] from is our tradition and come back
[1:06:03] under the blood of his son Jesus Christ
[1:06:05] I like that you know watch your body
[1:06:08] blood you know
[1:06:09] watch and become the Church of the
[1:06:11] Living God
[1:06:12] well I put that in red here I go see it
[1:06:14] bright
[1:06:16] come under the blood
[1:06:17] and become what
[1:06:19] no the church
[1:06:21] of Hope of the Living God
[1:06:24] that means he's alive inside that church
[1:06:27] oh Chloe the god that's not about just a
[1:06:30] name we don't become in the Church of
[1:06:31] the Living God isn't that right
[1:06:34] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Lutheran
[1:06:36] whatever more whosoever will may come
[1:06:37] and take of the water freely I believe
[1:06:39] that is what is in Me God has sent down
[1:06:42] the Holy Spirit to do that oh my
[1:06:45] but what about failure to wait
[1:06:49] what happens
[1:06:51] how does that work out
[1:06:53] and I have an example here of
[1:06:55] Samuel
[1:06:59] no not Samuel sorry Soul
[1:07:02] Samuel 13 and this is this is um Saul
[1:07:07] reading one year this is Samuel verse
[1:07:09] one that's it quickly sorry in one year
[1:07:12] and when he had written two years over
[1:07:13] his arrest so there's two years into his
[1:07:14] Reign so I'll choose him three thousand
[1:07:16] men of Israel 2000 will in Seoul in
[1:07:19] mismatch and among the tel and a toast
[1:07:21] with Jonathan and gibia Benjamin and so
[1:07:24] on I'll skip that right nice verse two
[1:07:26] let's go down verse five so Saul found
[1:07:29] himself two years into his ministry into
[1:07:31] Israel as kingship in back of the
[1:07:33] Philistines five and the Philistines got
[1:07:36] themselves together to fight with Israel
[1:07:37] had six thousand words man people as the
[1:07:40] sun which is of the seashore and
[1:07:43] multitude they came up and bitching
[1:07:47] when the men of Israel saw that they
[1:07:50] were in a street for the people with
[1:07:52] distress and that means when this
[1:07:54] managers show that they're in a tight
[1:07:55] situation for the truths were oppressed
[1:07:58] they hid themselves in caves and tickets
[1:08:00] and rocks and high places Olympics
[1:08:02] Israel going into hiding when they say
[1:08:05] the amount of fellow science
[1:08:07] some of the Hebrews went over Jordan
[1:08:08] land of God and Gilead as for Saul he
[1:08:11] was written
[1:08:12] and all the people followed him
[1:08:14] trembling
[1:08:16] as well as a shaky situation yeah
[1:08:21] he tarried seven days according to the
[1:08:23] set time that son had appointed
[1:08:26] but Samuel came not to giggle and the
[1:08:29] people were scattered from him
[1:08:31] and Saul said bring hidden to me on a
[1:08:35] peace offering and he offered the point
[1:08:37] of him
[1:08:38] and it came to pass
[1:08:40] as soon as he had made an end of the
[1:08:43] offering the bullet offering behold
[1:08:46] Samuel came
[1:08:47] Saul went out to meet him that he might
[1:08:50] salute him
[1:08:51] and Samuel said what has thou done
[1:08:55] Saul said because I saw
[1:08:58] that the people were scattered from me
[1:09:00] and that thou came is not within the
[1:09:03] days appointed and that the Philistines
[1:09:05] gather themselves together admit much
[1:09:08] therefore said I
[1:09:10] the Philistines will come down now upon
[1:09:12] meter Giga and I have not made a
[1:09:13] supplication unto the Lord I forced
[1:09:16] myself therefore
[1:09:18] and offered a burnt offering
[1:09:21] no Samuel is a man to do that but Saul
[1:09:24] took things in his own hand
[1:09:26] because he finds Samuel A coming on time
[1:09:29] he couldn't wait
[1:09:33] Samuel said to Saul that was done
[1:09:35] foolishly
[1:09:37] there was not kept the Commandment of
[1:09:39] the Lord thy God which he commanded tea
[1:09:41] for now would the Lord have established
[1:09:43] their Kingdom for Israel forever
[1:09:46] but now thy kingdom shall not continue
[1:09:49] the Lord had sought him a man after his
[1:09:52] own heart and the Lord had commanded him
[1:09:55] to be Captain over his people because
[1:09:57] thou has not kept that which the Lord
[1:09:59] commanded thee Oh my
[1:10:03] Hallelujah
[1:10:06] soil Under Pressure felt he had to do
[1:10:09] something
[1:10:11] he couldn't wait any longer
[1:10:13] Hallelujah so he decided to make the
[1:10:16] offering himself
[1:10:17] Oh my he took things in his own hands
[1:10:21] and that was a disaster
[1:10:24] for sure
[1:10:26] my God
[1:10:28] Hallelujah
[1:10:29] so just maybe God take this thing about
[1:10:32] waiting more serious than we think amen
[1:10:36] and the Bible said they not wait
[1:10:39] upon the Lord
[1:10:41] shall we knew their strength
[1:10:43] we are weak and weak potato bread called
[1:10:45] a week a week a week but they don't wait
[1:10:47] shall renew their straight
[1:10:50] they shall monked up his wings as eagles
[1:10:52] they shall run and not be weary
[1:10:55] they shall
[1:10:57] walk and not faint Oh Glory to God even
[1:11:00] young men shall fall and utterly faint
[1:11:03] but Peter wait oh glory to God wait
[1:11:07] wait on the Lord
[1:11:09] how much marriages could be different if
[1:11:11] men had waited
[1:11:13] people had prayed Oh Glory they call
[1:11:15] your situations could be different if
[1:11:17] people had waited waited for God waiting
[1:11:20] on God Waiting for God oh glory to God
[1:11:23] hallelujah
[1:11:25] you see when you take things into your
[1:11:27] own hands you are saying God I don't
[1:11:28] trust you I don't trust you can handle
[1:11:31] it so I have to deal with it myself
[1:11:32] that's what you're saying you know
[1:11:34] without saying those words that is what
[1:11:36] you're expressing by you not waiting
[1:11:38] upon God you are saying I don't trust
[1:11:40] you I don't think you could handle it so
[1:11:42] I am going to handle it myself but you
[1:11:45] have to believe and know that God will
[1:11:47] fulfill his word
[1:11:48] David said I wait for the Lord my soul
[1:11:52] waits in him do I hope oh blessed be the
[1:11:56] name of the Lord we think could be very
[1:11:58] hard
[1:11:59] Hallelujah you have to wait for God to
[1:12:01] heal you wait to go to live with your
[1:12:03] children wait to go to live your spouse
[1:12:05] where to go to do this and do that and
[1:12:08] do the other you don't know when you're
[1:12:09] going to do it but he's going to do it
[1:12:10] because he promised it Oh Glory to God
[1:12:13] it is easy to take things at their own
[1:12:15] hands I'll go speech them out I'll go
[1:12:17] get them out I go tell him like it is I
[1:12:19] go do this I'll go do this but have you
[1:12:20] ask have you waited oh praise the name
[1:12:23] of the Lord almost finished Hallelujah
[1:12:28] so Saul's life
[1:12:30] is proof
[1:12:32] of the era of not waiting Hallelujah
[1:12:35] decisions made in haste made under
[1:12:38] stress then you live with regrets
[1:12:40] because we did not wait
[1:12:41] on the Lord

[1:13:30] visions that God gave him that God can't

[1:13:34] out

[1:13:43] after being pursued by Saul David Daniel
