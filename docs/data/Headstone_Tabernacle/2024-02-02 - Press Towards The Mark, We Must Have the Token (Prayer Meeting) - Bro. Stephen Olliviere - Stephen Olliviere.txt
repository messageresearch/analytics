work in and through the lives of your people tonight may your Holy Spirit minister to each and every heart here tonight in Jesus name with Thanksgiving amen and amen God bless you Saints and welcome Amen to this prayer meeting tonight let's just turn to our Bibles to Psalms so sorry to Philippians chapter 3: 13 and 14 Philippians chapter 3: 13 and 14 good to see everyone tonight amen praise the Lord so from verse 13 verse 13 it says here Brethren I count on myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth onto these things which are before I press towards the Mark or the priz of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus amen may the Lord bless bless his will tonight in Jesus name amen so just for a few minutes I just want to share on the topic the titled press towards the Mark we must have the token press towards the Mark we must have the token and I was thinking about the word requirement and how in each age there was a requirement which was needed to be met by the people of that age it is something that is compulsory a necessary condition a prerequisite for something I recall in Noah's time in order to be saved the people were required to go into the ark it was a requirement it was a necessary condition to ensure their safety and when God shut the door of the Ark anyone found outside perished I was sharing with brother Gideon two Sundays ago on on on on this and no matter how good you you were or how many times you went to church or who you might be maybe you might be a really nice person once you did not meet the requirement you perished maybe I can say this way as long as you have met the requirement then you are safe let we say Amen tonight praise God I actually had a dream and I was telling brother Gideon about it concerning you know the ark with no and so on nice people helpful people good people came knocking on Noah's door of the Ark but they too perished as they had not met the requirement of the day so God is not a respector of persons it does not matter who it is amen the children of is Israel before they left Egypt the last plague of death was going to strike the land and the Death Angel was approaching they had a requirement for safety before the wrath of God passed through the land the blood had to be applied first they had to kill a lamb in the evening time and apply the blood on the doorpost that was the requirement for that day can we say Amen tonight amen anyone any family that did not meet the requirements the firstborn of that family perished I want you to see that in every major Exodus in every major age of transitioning there was a requirement for the safety so my brother and my sister in this age we have a requirement and the requirement is the token the token applied the token displayed amen so Saints tonight this requirement is more than life and death so be reverent with Godly Fai it is very serious from the message the tokan 1963 brother Bram says I don't care you might have cast out Devils you may have healed the Sick by your prayer of faith you may have preached the gospel you might be a believer note but if that token is not there you are under the WTH of God depart from me work of iniquity I never even knew you I know it sounds rough but may God Shake us tonight and give us a drive in our spirit to press towards the mark press towards the mark somebody say press tonight press amen brandom continues but when I see the token I will pass over you yeah what he says it's God's requirement of this hour the token is God's requirement of this hour he says the evening time message is to apply the token can we say Amen tonight amen praise God so don't rely on how much you have done or how good you are or how much you know bam says when the wroth of God flashes it will only recognize the token Oh Glory to God Amen I'm not trying to bring a message of fear to scare you but at the same time I want you to see the enormous importance of this requirement and may the Holy Spirit Quicken it to you tonight and impress upon us the urgency and the seriousness of this topic amen praise God so from the message the token B is saying the token is every evidence that a price has been paid because a price was required the price that was paid was the life of Jesus Christ and he gave his life and his holy spirit comes back upon you as a token that you are received Give the Lord a hand of praise tonight Hallelujah glory to God Amen and he has received you tonight amen hallelujah you carry the token with you there night not just on Sunday it's all the time you have the token glory and this is what we need this is the requirement for this hour and we have to press towards that Mark tonight praise God again from the message the token brother Bram says when you receive the Holy Ghost you've passed from Death to life life is in you you cannot perish no more impossible Hallelujah glory amen we are no more aliens We Are No More Strangers but we are Sons and Daughters of God in Christ Jesus by his great sacrifice can we say thank you Lord tonight hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Glory thank you Jesus Sons and Daughters of God amen glory and the prophet spent a long time pleading and encouraging the brandom Tabernacle to get the token one time he said apply a church now don't fail don't let the sun set don't don't don't don't four times don't rest day or night don't take no chance it won't work children it won't work you must have the token my God and the Mark is the token come on now praise God Amen another time he said my brother and sister get under the token quickly don't don't take no substitute don't don't don't do that see don't just imagine it and say you have it you stay there until you know that the token is applied until you're whole until the mind that was in Christ is in you until all the nonsense of this world is gone Glory until the whole heart's desire is him can we say Amen tonight yes Lord that's what we want tonight our entire heart is Christ Jesus amen glory he says then you know something is happening we don't want to take any chance on it praise God so tonight we have something to press on to we have a mark to press come to there is a requirement for this age and Ezekiel 9 says go through the city go throughout the city and put a mark on the foreheads of everyone who is sighing and crying we've got to be marked we have to press towards the mark praise God Amen and from a message of blushing Prophet brother Bram says you ought to have your Bible out somewhere laying out before God on your knees praying for the sins of the country sighing and crying Glory he said put a mark on those who sigh and cry but then the prophet says he says I'm guilty with you I have made up my mind listen to this I have made up my mind by the help and grace of God I'm determined to press towards the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus Till Death Shall Set Me Free Hallelujah God be my helper to do so help me is my prayer is that our prayer tonight Hallelujah you cry out to God tonight you cry out to God help me is my prayer Glory to God help us tonight father as we pray hallelujah hallelujah brother says in the message I want an oldfashioned God sent repentance and a calling back to God that when men and women walk in that door on crotches and we say in headstone tonight praise God when when men and women walk in that door and crutches they will walk out without them praise God hallelujah when the blind is Led in the door they will go out see him Hallelujah when the death comes in they will go out hearing Hallelujah when Sinners come in black and smutty with sin they will go out washed in the blood of the Lamb hallelujah praise God can we do it somebody's got to do it some church has got to do it some people has got to do it can we do it tonight praise God amen glory he said God called Israel and made them an example but we have let down on God and it blushes Us in the presence of God Amen can we do better can we do better as a church can we do better as a family can we do better as an individual can we press towards the Mark tonight
