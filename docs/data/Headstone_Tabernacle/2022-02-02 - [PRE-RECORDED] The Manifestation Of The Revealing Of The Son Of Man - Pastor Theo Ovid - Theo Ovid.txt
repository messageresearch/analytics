direct us to lead us to anoint us to inspire us to revive us and quicken us to bring us alive unto god where the privileged people we are oh glory hallelujah oh praise god god well it's good to be here i love the songs this morning the worship unto god real blessing to me this morning so we want to stand and turn our bibles today 60 and revelation chapter 13 scripture reading this morning i would see how it goes amen i have something to share with you and we'll see how it goes is it says arise shine for the light has come and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee for behold the darkness not maybe not perhaps but shall cover the earth and gross darkness not just darkness but gross darkness the people but the lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee that's prophecy seen upon thee revelation chapter 13 wanna look at verse 8 to 12. you'll be happy to know you could worship in the house of god when we read this scripture this morning and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him the beast you're talking about now the beast all not some all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him [Music] whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world this is revelation chapter 13 verse 8. if any man here have heir let him hear he that leads it into captivity shall go into captivity he that killed with the sword must be killed with the sword here is the patience and the fate of the saints and i beheld another beast coming out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and he speak as a dragon and he exercised it all the power of the first beast before him and caused the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was healed let's pray father we thank you for your word shine light may your word this morning be a lamp onto our feet and a light onto a part that we could know where to step in this hour this treacherous reception and evil and spiritual wickedness in high places father enlighten us inspire us draw us closer to you and fill us with your love and power and presence and jason may ask it knowing your prophet prophesied that there'll be no love left except among god's elect grant your presence we are waiting on you and depending upon you in jesus name we ask it amen amen you may be seated praise god oh hallelujah just sit down give the lord a shout i sense and feel a ripple in the camp this morning oh glory yes i feel this is a very very important service important time and it couldn't be a better time for us to have a convention on a meeting where we're looking for the bright promise to be realized where we looking for the bright promise to be confirmed certainly appreciate but anthony's message last sunday press into the kingdom of god is almost as if god put that ability in the eagles to press to look beyond obstacles and circumstance to look beyond conditions and frustration and just believe that you got a press you're gonna make it oh glory to god you love him this morning if you're loving them serving if you love him then worship him because he deserves to be worshipped everybody going to be worshiping something hallelujah we know what we worship we know why we worship we have reason to worship we join john when the lamb took the book and loose the seals you have to be able to see your name in order to worship no no peace i worship at all real worship hallelujah hallelujah whether you understand it or not all that dwell upon the earth how child worship the peace and the beast system wake up people as a wake-up service this morning not just for revival for understanding to uh modern events made clear by prophecy for an understanding of what has taken miss right around you that is not a joke it's not a game god sent a real prophet a 20th century prophet not them crystal ball prophet not these bogus modern day prophet but a real 20th century prophet who went up in the sphere of god and brought the prophecy for you and i hallelujah hallelujah glory to god you will be caesar this prophet identify america scripture as revelation chapter 13 that's where america is at spoke like a lamb at first but it will always speak like a lamb because the bible prophesy that same lamb voice will speak like the beast but speak like a dragon it has already begun the titan has already begun he said it's going to be a tightening you know what a titan is slowly it's just coming you're not in this squeezing it yet no it's a tightly and they're just tightening it slowly and slowly all of a sudden wake up and recognize there's no more freedom of religion hallelujah oh yes the sodomites are free the gays are free but the christians no longer freedom of religion this is what the bible prophesied so you can just sit in church as if you are somebody wake up this morning god is able to raise up stones to shout to praise to worship god will have to take these dead bunch of church members in this message hallelujah god is able to send out the voice and the spirit and the bride shall come whosoever will come true oh glory to god we're gonna have a revival give the lord a shout oh hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated praise god so my title i'm not ready to speak it this morning but i believe i want to put the title to this thought the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man it's an odd title for the scripture to be read but you'd rather worry about that your worry is to shout and the praise god and to get to the spirit and let god speak to your heart amen revelation 3 21 he might overcome it well i granted me my throne even as i also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne now what are we to overcome this is the normal question to ask here but that is not the actual thought of this verse it is not so much what we have to overcome but how we are to overcome now this is logical for does it matter what we have to overcome as long as we know how we can overcome a quick look at the scriptures which involve the lord jesus overcoming will bring all the truth of this proposition in matthew 4 jesus tempted of the devil he overcame like this the personal temptations of satan by the word and by the word only in each of his three major trials that corresponding exactly to the temptation the gardener eden the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye the pride of life jesus overcame by the word eve fell to the personal temptation of satan by failing to use the word adam fell in direct disobedience to the word but jesus overcame by the word and right now let me say this is the only way to be an overcomer is also the only way that you can know if you are overcoming because that word can't fail that word can't feel say can't feel say that word can't fail give the lord a praise offering notice again how jesus overcame the world systems of religion when he was repeatedly battered by the theologian of his name he constantly applied the word he spake only what the father give him to speak there was not a time when the world was not utterly confused by his wisdom for it was the wisdom of god in his own personal life contending with himself he overcame by obedience to the word of god hebrews 5 7 said it says who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crime and tears unto him that was able to save him from debt and was heard in that he feared though he was a son yet learned the obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect became the order of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him what was he obedient to the word now then there will not be here we go one person who will sit in the throne of the lord jesus christ unless he has been living that word [Applause] [Music] your prayers your fastings your repentances no matter what you present to god none of that will gain you the privilege of sitting in that throne it will be granted only to the word bride as the throne of the king is shared with the queen because she is to be united to him so only they who are of that word even as he is of that word will share that room remember we have shown clearly all through the ages that even as adam and eve fell because they left the world so the ephesians is fell by turning slightly from the world until with every age continue to turn away we have a final reputation of the world of by the world church system this loudest age ends in a blackout of the world cross darkness cover the people darkness cover the world so this age end up with the blackout of the world isn't that right thereby listen thereby causing a departure of the lord from the midst [Applause] [Music] so once people depart from the word the lord depart also [Applause] because god is the word god has been his word [Applause] hallelujah and if you are with the word god is with you you don't have to feel something come on oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you'll have to feel that tingling running on your back [Applause] here we go he stands outside calling to his own who follow him by obedience to the word this is what i want to get to after a short and powerful demonstration of the spirit this little hunted and persecuted group will go to be with jesus so you have no complaints now you want to worship now you won the praise god now because i just read for you that this bride should be a haunted persecuted group you know what hunted means like if the police looking for you they're looking to find you they're looking to get you praise god hallelujah praise god all these demons hide in the closets coming out isis coming out the sodomites coming out when the bride is going to come out come on say him and somebody when are you going to declare who your father is where you come from where you're going what you're standing for what is your expectation hallelujah everybody have to come on you know why every seed have to bring forth after it's kind come on same as somebody oh you'll be seated understand this genesis is the seed revelation is the harvest so when it comes down to revelation every spirit that was seated on in genesis has to come forth it has to have the sodomites it have to have the lottites the church members and it has to have elohim standing on the backside of the desert but they elected with abraham a bunch of people looking for translation looking for another time of life looking for dynamics to the mechanics looking for outpouring of the holy ghost there's got to be a people that god come down to return to glory to god amen hallelujah hallelujah glory to god amen this message not some pentecostal message this is christ the solomon that was failed in a prophet came to call a bride out [Applause] let's continue [Applause] look away to jesus prophecy there's coming a time upon this nation to where this nation is going to exercise all the power that the beast had before it which was pagan rome this nation will do that revelation 13 plainly explains it the lamb come out of the earth and the other beast came out of the water and after a while it received power and spoke like a dragon the protestant denomination an image unto the beast making a power that will force all protesting like a union you will have to be in this council of churches or you won't be able to have fellowship it's practically that way right now you can't go and preach unless you have a fellowship card of some identification no we are going to be cut out of that all together cause you won't be able to do it it's a tightening and when that time comes when the press comes to a place where you are pressed out not just pressed but pressed out not just pressed but pressed out you see i'm pushing the buttons this morning to you who are sleeping this church i'm pushing this button this morning for you are comfortable to belong to the message because two days ago the 26 the supreme court of america they tried to redefine what marriage is they never was giving me authority to define it how dare them redefined it hallelujah that's what i'm talking about so one day the supreme court of america could redefine or attempt to redefine what god has defined then they refine the army they define god almighty praise god then [Applause] glory hallelujah hallelujah glory to god you will be seated so what they have done they have officially sanctioned the return of sodom and gomorrah officially officially oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah praise god genesis 13 13 amazing the scripture [Music] the name of the chapter and verse but the men in sodom were wicked and sinners before the lord exceedingly i wonder if these uh honorable judges of the supreme court would send a memo to god to ask god to apologize for judging sarah gomorrah for their wickedness or they will call what we are preaching a hate speech i wonder if these honorable judges will do that oh my god so now the preachers in america they now bang oh hallelujah because now they have to try to say they have a license a married man a man a woman a woman but god's going to judge the whole thing wallet holy call it america is already judged it's just waiting for the sentencing you're not hearing me oh hallelujah it's already judged you see that just said guilty and qualified come back next two months for sentencing then it said take six months take a year and two years well america's been judged already it waited for sentences and guess what the bride already judged when jesus died you died when he was buried you will bury with him that's why you should be shouting this morning and when he arose you were always with him you already mocked for the holy ghost oh hallelujah [Applause] come on hallelujah hallelujah you are sealed by the word i know you're gonna be sealed by the spirit the angel from the east coming with the seal of the living god oh hallelujah give the lord a shout our prayer [Applause] in the last days there's two marks the mark of the beast and the mark of god and the mark of god is the holy ghost that sealed you into the kingdom you are sealed inside and outside did every cat touch what god put inside of you the devil could only watch what he can't touch forget about it all glory to god understand this when the devil began to eat down god's tree he eat down the fruit he dung the leaves he eat on the back he dung everything down right down and god the voice and the stump it don't do a stump the voice in the stump say i'm going to restore i'm going to get back i'm going to get back my luck i'm going to get back to power in other words they're going to be a super church they're going to be a super race i don't care what this message is doing somebody going to prove it somebody going to manifest them somebody going to vindicate it somebody going to bring it forward hallelujah glory glory you will be seated all the time we read luke 17 i just wasn't in the days i know so shall it be in the days when the son of man will be revealed all the time by the brown coming forth talking about the time like shadow in which discipline coming forth is not the revealing of the son of man but we are phasing into the manifestation of the revealing the son of man has already been revealed but there's going to be a manifestation of the revealing of the son of man do you believe that oh hallelujah hallelujah listen to this you may be seated when the imam was an old man god spoke to him that he got my son that was divine revelation to abraham he couldn't prove it he couldn't show it he could only testify about it but when the son of man came down with two other angels and tell abraham not only i come down to reconfirm my promise to you but i came to unbring you a revelation that i will return not in this form i will return in power i will return i'll ride the trail once more the holy ghost the white horse rider i will return another time of life praise god listen abraham was still old man when he heard that revelation when the settlement revealed itself to him but one morning after 30 days one morning there was no manner wrong one morning no man lay hands upon him no money anointed one more thing the manifestation which will be the interpretation of what the son of man has revealed one morning when abram looked in the mirror he saw a young man standing there and when he taught he alone looking young he saw sarah looking just as young you talk about a dance you talk about a shout you talk about a jubilee you talk about a revival 25 years [Applause] 25 years you can't tell me i can't dance i wait for this promise all these years i've got to dance i've got to shout where was thou with a little fungus of the earth and the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy you want me to see them we're not here to tell you gosh i'm a prophet that mission is 50 years old we had to share with you the prophet's prophecy [Applause] what we got to do you have your job you have your work you have this and that and so that's fine you could be a seed tie up like the thorns cares of this life are you all twisted up yeah that's not a seed a ben up seed twisted seed bubble corn seed you pick a corn and then you see one grain in it are you same grain your plant you all that possessed to kill your one grain it waste a time there might be some 34 some 64 some not that one fall yeah brand one green because you all have processed you pick the corn and see one grain you're dead like home but i waste my time with you all the storm process [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so when god put a seed in you oh don't don't get me started this one you're wondering i miss saturday this morning you may be seated jesus just get a parable about my mind man was mean i was a businessman but you had these young men he gave one talent to one two talents three talents one who have bring three make three one or two bring two the one bury it and he could talk you know give a big mouth would the master come and say well i have there for me he said well i know he's a mean man you know and i'll save it in a hole for you how you was when i got the books 20 years ago i'm same just as i am i just just time just take a stroll upon me i have my same attitude i have my same spirit i was saving me for you said the wicked servant take with what he have for the what you have the literally hell will be taken from you given to others you better produce yes yes yes you i'm talking to you yeah you who are talking about all of it you you mean you yes you you you're not pointing up soon greetings to those connected to us god bless you and if you were talking to also you on the internet you gotta produce i'm not seeing them behind there but they still have to produce to be part of this brain [Applause] don't bother with those who here long time because jesus gave her a comfort also everything is covered yeah don't bother foreign years ago thank god you come in the eleventh hour five minutes at 11. oh you come in good you have five minutes to do you do and get your stuff become pain they coming during the labor time is that pay when season change pay time line up that's what we're looking for this week this weekend come in here same pay save holy ghost same fire same power peter hat same power pentecost so you just rejoice that you made it in that god could open your eyes to see this message of the hour where you are called to the resurrection call to perfection oh let's continue oh praise god is a tightening when that time come when the press comes to a place to where you are pressed out then watch what i'm fixing to tell you a few minutes watch it with pull down not depressed no when it pressed come to a place you're like you know what i'm kind of thinking as if i get grinding a long time the mincer you're doing so are they pressing good something like that until you're pressed out now watch spoken word journalists see he said uh watch what you did for then it will be absolutely the total loss but it will be for the bride and the church now understand this friends this gospel by prophecy have to be preached to the eternal loss the people who cannot be saved when when jesus died he ran down to hell he ran down to the lower regions and preached to those people who heard the messages and rejected it they say that they hear it again now just think about it now people are looking for see yes right right and all right and the door is shut signs wonders and miracles and they're trying to get it and they can't i'll compare to noah's ark how long do i preach for 120 years he's preaching the word gets into the ark everybody have their own opinion even our own feelings nor preaching preaching his life out it's still an all-given fight isn't that right but no one's staying with the word bill in the ark all of a sudden god said get the animals in the people supposed to see something had to be happening god not waste in time the animal is coming and something's happening as we always say our sign is not out here our side is inside of here the word isn't that right but i want to show you what is happening out there is direct connection to what happens out of here isn't that right because they have to do their thing to identify the season and time and if sodom has returned i mean the angel is on the earth to speak to abraham are you with me abraham represent the elect and when god came down his words were shall i hide from abraham these mysteries what i'm about to do god was about to release judgment the earthquake earthquakes putin russia is already displaced with the weapons and bombs they already have it they're not fixing to make it next 20 years next 30 years it's already built and we in place we have our bombs we are losing yet but we have our bumps [Applause] we like walking dynamites we are just loaded just as patched light me up oh hallelujah that's not gonna happen to the bride you know what i read for you after a short manifestation and demonstration of the spirit god will take home that haunted persecuted bride afterwards short manifestation people are looking for that they're looking for press they're looking for all kinds of things but not this power what's the use we come under this hour and there's no power then we believe and fail then we have tribulation saints we as mess we are melt we may as well sit down and relax and wait for the tribulation and suck upon food so you can buy yourself unless and all who name not written taking it like like like like a card but but so therefore the only people are not going to bow is just name written now how are people to know their names written if the book is not opened to show them their name and if it's only six years then the book is closed then all you're looking for is the outside syria watching another cevio you know yeah show your book you're opening your name behind it because you're waiting for the break you last already come break all the seals and the mystery has been revealed for you to see your name and we must know when you see your name because depression will just fly out of your life frustration will fly out your life the devils that get frustrated with you because you see your name and you begin to join the heavenly chorus and begin to worship god without studying your son backslidden or your daughter or your husband or your wife or your children you get the devil all mixed up messed up because you worship in god anyhow [Applause] you think the devil enjoys seeing you worshiping god of course not he wanted his worship in heaven and we said no we didn't give him up here we can't get them down here we got calling to bow down tonight praise god jesus told the woman at the well woman the our coming now is when the worshippers know when the true truth when the true that mean ego have false worshipers but it has some true worshipers these people the true ones they're gonna worship in spirit and in truth you may be seated therefore through the ages couldn't have the worship that god wanted because the truth was lost so god has to go and get the truth and pull it up together gather it up in the scattered word tie it back into the word to pull down the spirit all seven seas open then the spirit descended in prophecy for the pride so the spirit descended in the form of the word the lord himself came with a message put it in seed form and he walked he walked oh this is good because he knows that every seed shall bring forth after its king there was a bright seed sword there's got to be a bride to comfort oh glory to god amen are you with me you may be seated but branham he said we are the end time the seeds are sold the latter rain is fixing to comfort remember there will be a denominational gathering pretty soon it will be terrific and they will bring themselves together in this federation of churches and this kind of church will be put out of operation it's at that time that jesus will appear and he will show which is bride and which is not so we are moving into a cycle it is god's clock it's ticking remember christian friends i'm a man i can make mistakes it's oh that's wonderful it are people who believe they can make no mistakes so you know they don't need a eraser so i'm a man i can make mistakes but god being god cannot make a mistake all the words that's been written must be fulfilled jesus said so so we have come things in the scripture that must be fulfilled and that is one of the things this boycott to come but before this boycott come of the marking of the beast there has to be a seed sword for god to take his church out a seed has to be sown and they are going to bring a persecution on pretty soon and shut up all the churches and churches like this who is not a denomination they will use them as storehouses and anything else oh my the angel of the lord the word of the little lamb that wrote up in version 13 exercising all the powers before speaking like a dragon a bitter religious persecution we are nearing that time you heard what he said a bitter religious persecution although the pastor in america says he said he never thought that he would live to feel he live in a strange land where the truth is no longer accepted or respected where the rights of others is taken more precedent oh my hallelujah america the start up with freedom of religion god bless our nation they kick god straight out are now waiting for judgment it's rotten on the inside and then the country just falls last great empire and there's a prophecy brahman says that america reject this message god will send it out to another people in another land but god's word can't fail there's a bride around the world that's going to be called out by the mystery of the seventh seal oh blessed be the lord gotta go a little further he said you remember church here we go are you ready are you being edified this morning all right remember church you're living in the best days that you ever will live in right now [Applause] give the lord [Applause] let me read this again [Applause] some people don't want to shop you know what happens they don't believe in the best days [Music] [Applause] if you think think bad all right let's do it again church remember you're living the best you ever live ever live right now until jesus come it will gradually not grab gravity but rapidly get worse and worse when russia goes down there to get that oil look out that's all she needs that's what the prophet said it would do and we are ready for it then well that's late knew russia already gone down take crime here and you're all right underneath you're already in position that's what i said russia went and do their business first the supreme court do their business next what about us [Music] what do we have to do the prophet already told us what we see we should make a church that will make a revival [Applause] i'm not hearing you because you're supposed to be scripted on that because the prophet said a minister cannot bring a revival it has to come by you the people i'm not hearing you this morning glory to god hallelujah you have the key so you come with your revival from your home and you come here in the spirit and you unlock the blessings of god and the minister can't stand to minister because you come and unlock a minute lesson heaven start to come down windows of heaven open up minister have to say what god put in his mouth he could have a message and god pushed that whole thing aside he could have a thought on what push his own touch aside then your thought move on and the thoughts of god move in then the words come out of your mouth and as a word come on fire comes up power comes out healing comes up you become like a branch and he is vine and he is the charger so you have a power source and it seems like a power can go out because this power never had a beginning this power cannon there's not sunlight power this is not solar power this is not electricity this is god's power we call it dynamics we can have an inside dynamo it keeps turning and turning it can't stop that's why jesus said he that believeth on me out of his belly shall flow rivers where those waters coming from oh glory to god is a dynamo turning in your soul to bring up the waters of the holy ghost or give the lord a shout of praise you've got to see where you're going oh glory to god amen you may be seasoned husband anthony brought us a tremendous last sunday he said a vision show you where you are to go or when you look at where you're at how could you feel satisfied what you come to church for is to get inspiration of the direction away supposed to go and that could give you wings lift you out of your old stuff because you see something greater than yourself what glory to god you see greater than you you sit down and mope in your selfishness and your carnality but when you see something greater you said my god that's worth living for that's worth pressing for forgetting the thing that i pass i press or give the lord some glory oh hallelujah hallelujah oh glory my so church oh hallelujah glory to god you say the world is in the sun condition i was a dangerous time for the church and it's even time because they'll go to church and almost be like the pentecostal believers they will shout down speak with tongues everything else so close would receive the very like if possible but remember the only way where you know that you are right is to follow the conductor the word and it brings you into absolute truth oh praise god and i show us adam and eve had to be the same spirit christ and the church has to be the same spirit the same

one like somebody said already yes i go nobody calls me i said do you call anybody no go through life like a victim you can't declare who you are and that's why jesus gave us the example of declaring and declaring himself and so on until he said before abraham was i am then he tells that but you are the light of the world there was no light them back certain jealous characters that was walking with jesus with all the holy ghost what light there wasn't the light yet but he had to give them the promise because it belongs to them [Applause] if you are my son whether you are vagrant whether whatever you are you are still my son if i write a check out for you that's nothing my son friend that is from his son whether he can sign it or cash it himself is still for my son but that's jesus peter and they were however they were they were still his sons so you give them promises same works i do shall you do also what works they go and do they go on the night and run and go on fishing or counting like that [Applause] but jesus i'm waiting for them to be ready they should make everybody here um when god tells samuel going along and anoint one of my kings king among his under jesse

let's get the big print out what do you think the vision is for what is in the fifo ministry for to make the vision plain the prophet said may men come forth to make more sense not to interpret again or twist what he said to make more sense to it [Music] so i hope what we shared with you this morning had to make more sense to it [Applause] that you would realize it's not a game [Applause] ezekiel 9 god said the spoken angels go forth and slaughter slaughter all right then the inconvenience said no no way put mark upon those outside and cry come do don't come near them when they see them just keep moving [Music] utterly young and old little children so you have no time to be idle and mind other people business you are time to pray for your children seek the lord you have no time to waste because seal all those who sigh all those who cry all those who have a burden you say without a burden you can't do anything they come to church you go back home you have no burden you don't care if the church falls flat you don't care the church if they should sit down if the devil himself sit inside of here you don't even care turn around and greet somebody you'll shake the devil's hand praise god without even knowing it's the devil because you don't care but when you get a burden that's different you care about what happened inside out here you care about taking the devil out you care about pulling somebody up you care about encouraging somebody that's what you care about you care about a revival you care about what takes persons out of here it takes 400 years for those people in israel to get a burden a long time another cry pressure when you're crying no pressure pressure not good enough you put something on the fire and heat water not hot enough you have to raise the temperature then the water starts to get as you taste it then you're going to see the boil isn't that right you know when water not boiling can i look one make porridge with it make tea with it when a water come to boiling you could get steam that could pilot engines steam engines but it had to come to the boiling point well quarter to bring the buyer to a boiling point some of you just get a little bit of warm stuff lukewarm warm enough hurt what is man on fire hot like hot pepper go in your mouth right when you're hot the devils get burned because you have a testimony you have a praise i have a joy never say talk about she too happy he said they have to work something to break that joy down uh when the devil sees your happy devils get frustrated you know because his joy his joy is to see you frustrated see what the hard mean lemon face mixed with lime so you're really sour and when you never see like that actually going to church he said he's like christian and he great every sunday morning but look at him look at him look at her look at her yeah money he's still frustrated look at him look you have a car and he's still fed up look at and that have no kind of happy ending praising god gotta wait long to get a taxi by the praise and god they worship they don't have a big night so far but they worship and in the prison [Applause] on your time matching your shoes take your worship [Applause] i know you're like i'm at your shoes i'm just saying that hallelujah a little bit all matched up well and you can't worship what's the sense those pharisees were well patted

there i come to shine light in her path i come to call her name i come to find her i need splashes of mario god found you you think you drift inside of here god found you shame on you for not worshiping and praising and pressing hallelujah glory to god i'm almost done oh hallelujah in the magnitude of what is happening all around the world the wars rumors of wars a guy just into new zealand this week going to the beach playing like a limer have a on berlin on a gun kill about three something people then they kill him people are not looking for that seed of second seed of the unrighteous man going and chewed sit down for one hour when a prayer meeting bible study and then kill nine people he had to do it something nothing not the color of your skin is the seed that seed could hide in any skin color it's not the color of the skin it's the seed seed of the unrighteous oh yes the devil have a sea too but god have a seed also and the manifestation of the holy spirit operating in his children is the seed of the age so you are the press into a manifestation that's what we're here for amen hallelujah if we help everybody with a host and a car and land and money you still need to be saved from yourself still need a breakthrough in your spirit because natural things got into spiritual things [Applause] come on now natural things can fill the emptiness in your spiritual desire oh glory oh hallelujah king david said as the heart punt after the water broke my soul thirst after the living god oh glory to god and that's what make isis and these people so powerful they don't care about natural things so they are passionate about what they are about they tell us about what they're about yes they are sellers they have a seal they want to promote the cause isn't that right people living from england what kind of places to go and be wife of terrorists well they will say wife of soldier or whatever i don't know but they're doing all of that engineers educated people you recognize education really of the devil got something wrong gross darkness cover the people oh my intelligent people supreme judges cross darkness cover their mind it's a season and time it's like a blanket like a shadow just coming over the earth people who you taught was intelligent and wise and understanding all of a sudden like it messed up here it is the lamb about to speak like a dragon it's a tightening churches are worried and concerned isn't that right not just here not here so much in america because they don't know what's going to happen if somebody come to perform let them do that kind of marriage how could they define marriage that matter the man when god defined marriage as a man and a woman but that is what is not legal now oh my sodden condition has returned then if that is the case where is elohim [Applause] coming to visit a bride it can be some man some we don't intrude that it can be some man from america or europe or africa or south america it has to be the spirit because that is what came upon abraham so you know what you're looking for you're looking for the same thing peter was looking for when jesus finished with them he said receive the holy ghost wait for the promise of the father so when they read in the upper room they wasn't waiting for knock on the door and somebody can't tell him it is here it came by fedex that is not what they're waiting for they were waiting worshipping they were waiting blessing they were waiting in in the atmosphere because it's not coming on dry every dead church is finished and if you stay dead you are finished not are you saying that you're finishing if you stay dead because you have to go in the atmosphere that they will end and they were dry seas that was worshiping they were worshiping and praising god they wasn't studying this problem and that problem they had problems you know that bills to pay their things to do that cases to deal with but they were dealing with the promise of the father that's what you come for you're coming for a promise from your father which is the holy ghost to empower your life to give your strength and power to overcome power to forgive power to pray power to pray through power to stan [Applause] forward the cast devils out power to pray that the blood cover your home and demon activity don't be loosed in your home let me finish music please this word so will it be in the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed not no more as church here we go not no more the bride is called so he's prophesying in that day the son of man will reveal what to join are you ready you will see where i get the title from the solomon will reveal what to join the church to the head to unite the marriage of the bride the bridegroom call will come right through this when the sonoma will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together here we go are you ready the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unite together and to do that here we go it will take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man not a clergyman but the manifestation of the revealing so the son of man has been revealed it's on books and tips but it can be books and tapes to unite us because it has brought so much division it will not take that it will take the manifestation of watching on the books and tapes to unite the pride with the head could we give the lord a shelter pray oh hallelujah oh hallelujah to god yeah what he said yeah do you see what i mean it's son of man gideon they could come up jesus christ will come down in human flesh among us here we go and make this word so real it would unite the church of him as one then she will go home to the wedding supper she is reunited we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage the wedding supper and so forth he said not the theologian the son of man or praise the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah could we give the lord a shout i begin the lord of praise oh glory to god praise god i'm closing a minister said to me not long ago a friend of mine but abraham god will never let the united states fall because of the basis of his forefathers from the religion i said he let the jews sure carried away they had a lot of better understanding than what we had that's right go and aid the respect of some generation that passed you either walk the line or you're out of the kingdom that's pretty rough but it's good for you oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah oh glory to god now watch his disciples they met a man cast not devils he was getting the job done hallelujah so they were very jealous so he goes down now here you come disciples right now to the man here you either come join our ranks or don't do that no more and a man let them know he didn't have to join the denomination their ranks he went up there and he heard jesus saying whosoever will he just receive it and he was getting the job done well the disciples said we forbid you in other words we boycott you we will do all of this if you don't do it went back until jesus about to jesus said now don't you do that because no man can do a miracle in my name that could speak lightly of me isn't that right you see what it was petty jealousy of those disciples it was in men then it is still in men today that's right because that man was getting the job done and many times we find people who are getting the job done that don't belong to our ranks we want to flap about it it's just the same element and if it was in the church of 12 that walk with jesus is going to be in this one as the rest of them so friends let me say this now remember young people here i don't know jesus may come this afternoon he may come next year i don't know but remember if i do not live to see that day of his coming i hope that i will if i do not see it do not let this wood ever the pattern of your heart isn't that right i speak in the name of the lord i believe with all my heart that the way it will wind up is a union a boycott all such places as this will be closed down and you'll not be able to speak unless you got permission or a license from this federation of churches the holy service god bless you let us all stand and give god some praises amen amen and amen and amen praise the lord [Applause] [Music] yes
