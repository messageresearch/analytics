[22:06] notes but with such a blend of the holy
[22:09] spirit
[22:10] bringing that you're in a battle and we

[22:21] but before you have a special tip i want
[22:23] to play for you this morning before we
[22:25] do that
[22:26] i want to read something brother branham
[22:27] says
[22:28] this is from super saiyan he said let us
[22:31] work lord
[22:32] for we know we have much more time to
[22:34] work
[22:35] we see time closing in
[22:37] soon
[22:38] we are looking for the angel
[22:41] that will set his foot
[22:43] on the land
[22:49] praise the lord
[22:51] praise the lord
[23:00] we haven't we haven't much time
[23:02] much more time to work
[23:03] we see time closing in
[23:05] soon we are looking for that angel that
[23:08] will set his foot on the land and on the
[23:10] sea
[23:11] and raise up his hand and swear by him
[23:14] that lives forever
[23:15] and ever time shall be no more
[23:18] said at that time
[23:20] the mystery of god should be finished
[23:22] we understand now father that god's
[23:25] threefold mystery
[23:26] has been made known to us
[23:28] and we understand and we are looking now
[23:32] so he said god threefold mystery has
[23:34] been made known to us and we are looking
[23:37] now for those for those mysterious
[23:39] standards
[23:41] that came out of heaven in the book of
[23:43] revelation that was sealed in the back
[23:45] of the book
[23:46] revealed to us o lord the things that we
[23:50] need for the battle ahead of us
[23:53] oh praise god so he was looking for the
[23:55] seven thunders
[23:56] praise god for the battle that lays
[23:58] ahead it will take those seven thunders
[24:01] to deal with that devil that's why he
[24:03] said wait till them seven thunders utter
[24:05] the voices of that group that could take
[24:08] the wood and hand it here it will slice
[24:10] and cut isn't it isn't that right
[24:12] oh praise the name of the lost i thought
[24:14] i was shared with you
[24:16] so i i was on tuesday night i was at
[24:18] ephesians tabernacle pastorate and
[24:19] george who stood a brother
[24:21] uh about tumelo madiba from south africa
[24:25] uh first time i kind of met him and it
[24:27] was quite early fine and i thought it
[24:29] would be a blessing for you today to
[24:31] share that service and that service is
[24:33] an in a divine introduction talking
[24:36] about the introduction of jesus christ
[24:38] and you know the amazing thing about it
[24:40] sometimes you hear services and you
[24:42] don't hear about jesus you hear
[24:43] everything else about jesus christ and
[24:44] what we're supposed to be seeing is
[24:46] jesus christ and one day god going to
[24:48] introduce him in you
[24:50] he said he will let it be made known
[24:53] among men if you try to hide him he will
[24:56] say look at here look look the christ
[24:58] here in other words he would be veiled
[25:00] inside of you
[25:02] that is our promise christ in you the
[25:04] hope of glory so we want to go straight
[25:06] into the tape by the grace of god i know
[25:08] we have some real technical challenges
[25:10] this morning but we by the grace of god
[25:12] we believe that things will not work out
[25:13] by god's grace we're going straight into
[25:14] it amen god bless you praise the lord
[25:47] [Music]

[27:01] him
[27:03] and say they behold the lamb of god
[27:06] which taketh away the sin of the world
[27:11] this is the ego of whom i said
[27:14] after me cometh amen which is preferred
[27:18] before me
[27:19] for he was before me
[27:22] and i knew him not
[27:26] but that he should be made manifested to
[27:28] israel
[27:30] therefore he might come baptizing with
[27:32] water
[27:34] and john bear record saying
[27:38] i saw the spirit descending from heaven
[27:40] like a dove
[27:42] and it about upon him
[27:45] and i knew him not
[27:48] but he that sent me to baptize with
[27:51] water
[27:52] the same satan to me
[27:54] upon whom thou shalt see the spirit
[27:56] descending
[27:58] and remaining on him
[27:59] the same is he which baptizeth with the
[28:02] holy ghost
[28:04] and i sow and bear record
[28:07] that this is the son of god
[28:10] as we bow hate
[28:13] gracious even the father
[28:16] you are our god
[28:19] you loved us even before we could love
[28:22] you
[28:23] you found us before we could find you
[28:27] and heavenly father we are here to
[28:29] worship you
[28:32] we are not ashamed to call you our god
[28:36] we are not ashamed to testify of your
[28:38] greatness
[28:40] to our colleagues our friends and our
[28:43] family
[28:45] there is none like thee
[28:47] you are such a wealthy god

[29:41] as we commit everything to you
[29:43] in the name of jesus christ amen
[29:47] while you take your seats
[29:57] we are appreciating the lord
[30:01] it was
[30:03] a day before yesterday we spoke about
[30:06] a divine handover ceremony
[30:11] then last night we spoke about
[30:15] our divine origin
[30:18] and this evening we want to speak about
[30:20] a divine introduction
[30:24] hallelujah
[30:26] are you here this evening
[30:28] amen
[30:30] now
[30:32] there is a quotation
[30:34] i remember i mentioned last
[30:37] night that
[30:39] when god
[30:41] sends a message
[30:43] he already has people in his mind who
[30:46] are going to believe the message
[30:50] when jesus died on the cross
[30:53] god didn't just allow jesus to die on
[30:56] the cross
[30:57] and maybe thought people may feel pity
[30:59] for him and believe him
[31:02] before jesus could go to the cross
[31:05] god exactly knew the people that were
[31:07] going to receive jesus
[31:10] when god sent brother branham he had
[31:13] people in his mind that were going to
[31:15] believe in brother branham
[31:18] god doesn't operate on chances god
[31:21] operates on predestination
[31:25] now in this message what is the
[31:27] attraction on the mountain
[31:30] paragraph 35
[31:32] the prophet of god says but in the midst
[31:35] of all of it
[31:37] through every
[31:38] church age
[31:40] and every prophet that had been
[31:43] and would be
[31:45] there's going to be a certain amount of
[31:48] people
[31:49] that's predestined to hear that message
[31:53] and they will follow it
[31:56] those ignore the
[31:58] crowds hallelujah
[32:01] they ignore the criticism of the
[32:04] unbeliever
[32:06] what does it mean it means when god
[32:09] sends the message
[32:10] there are people that are predestinated
[32:12] to hear the message
[32:14] but there will be the crowds
[32:17] and there will be the critics
[32:20] but these people that are protested will
[32:23] not focus on the critics
[32:25] they will not focus on the crowds
[32:28] they will focus on the message
[32:31] and i say in the end time we don't focus
[32:34] on the crowds
[32:35] we don't focus on the critics we focus
[32:38] on the message
[32:40] [Applause]
[32:42] they've got one thing to do
[32:44] that's believe
[32:46] and to get every bit of it they can
[32:50] and soak it in like mary who set at the
[32:53] feet of jesus
[32:55] are those people in the building tonight
[32:58] are there people in the building that
[32:59] are ignoring the crowds
[33:01] that are ignoring the criticism of
[33:04] unbelievers
[33:05] that are following the message
[33:07] unconditionally
[33:09] i hope we are together this evening
[33:13] now in the unveiling of god i'm just
[33:15] laying my foundation here
[33:17] paragraph 22.
[33:21] there is a reason why i'm reading these
[33:22] quotations before i get into the main
[33:25] course
[33:29] the unveiling of god paragraph 22
[33:31] brother branham says
[33:33] and each time
[33:35] if you take the tapes and listen
[33:38] and i hope and trust that you have had a
[33:41] spiritual understanding
[33:44] of what that god has been trying to get
[33:46] over to the church
[33:49] without saying it right
[33:50] out so it's not brother means he doesn't
[33:54] use a plain language
[33:56] you've got to read between the lines
[34:01] see
[34:03] it's a thing
[34:05] sometimes
[34:06] we have to say things in such a way that
[34:10] it might thin
[34:11] it might thin down
[34:13] it might bring some to go out
[34:16] and some to leave
[34:18] and some to ponder over
[34:21] but that's done purposely it must be
[34:24] done that way
[34:26] so the prophet says god is not obligated
[34:28] to make things more just plain
[34:32] sometimes we're going to say certain
[34:34] things purposefully
[34:36] so that others it may thin down
[34:39] it may bring some to go out
[34:42] and some to leave
[34:44] and some to ponder but it's done
[34:47] purposefully
[34:49] so what i'm simply saying when you are
[34:51] in the message you must have revelation
[34:55] without revelation you are not going to
[34:57] stay alone
[34:58] because god is going to say certain
[35:00] things that requires not understanding
[35:03] but revelation
[35:05] most people that have left the message
[35:08] they lacked revelation
[35:10] they had the intellectual conception of
[35:12] the message but they liked revelation
[35:16] but some of us we are remaining because
[35:18] we've got to the revelation
[35:20] remember when the lord jesus christ says
[35:23] unless you eat my flesh and drink my
[35:26] blood you are worthy of me
[35:28] he was not obligated to explain what he
[35:30] meant
[35:32] mostly left
[35:34] and the 12th remained and after they
[35:36] remained you would have thought maybe he
[35:38] would make made it easier he turns
[35:41] around and say why are you remaining why
[35:44] don't you go like the rest of them
[35:47] are with me i mean logically as a
[35:49] minister if a crowd leaves you and you
[35:52] remain with you you want to encourage
[35:54] them and say at least you guys are
[35:56] remaining
[35:57] but not the lord jesus christ he turns
[36:00] around and says why are you remaining
[36:03] why don't you follow them
[36:05] because he wanted to test why are they
[36:07] remaining
[36:09] but peter said where can we go because
[36:12] peter hated the revelation
[36:15] and tonight we say where can we go
[36:18] we can go back to all the denominations
[36:22] we are not chickens
[36:24] we are not returning back to the chicken
[36:26] vineyard
[36:27] we took a flight and we are not
[36:29] retaining town
[36:33] are you here this evening
[36:35] [Applause]
[36:37] i hope we are together
[36:39] i want to speak about
[36:41] a divine introduction
[36:44] and i want to look at the commission of
[36:47] john
[36:48] and look at the commission of willem
[36:50] branham
[36:51] amen
[36:53] william branham received to the
[36:54] commission
[36:55] as john was there as john the baptist
[36:59] was the forerunner of christ
[37:02] in his first coming
[37:04] your message
[37:06] shall be a forerunner in his second
[37:08] coming
[37:10] and a lot of times and by the way
[37:13] we are not expecting another man after
[37:15] brother branham
[37:19] eight messengers and scriptures
[37:24] there was only seven stars
[37:27] so if you want to become another star
[37:30] you will treat you with suspicion
[37:34] because jesus brother branham never came
[37:37] to introduce another man he came to
[37:39] introduce christ
[37:44] eliezer never introduced another man he
[37:48] introduced isaac
[37:50] so if you think brother branham was
[37:52] introducing you you are wrong
[37:55] you have read it poorly you need to read
[37:58] again
[38:00] from brother branham is christ
[38:05] i do not believe that
[38:06] we don't want chance takers in the
[38:08] message
[38:11] now
[38:13] i want us to go and look at this
[38:19] maybe
[38:21] as i said received an angelic visitation
[38:25] gabriel told him you are favored among
[38:28] women
[38:29] and you shall conceive the thing that
[38:32] you shall conceive
[38:33] shall be of the holy ghost
[38:36] and after mary received that visitation
[38:40] she was told about the same visitation
[38:44] that elizabeth received
[38:46] then mary went to visit elizabeth
[38:50] and when they quoted there they had a
[38:52] fellowship about the angelic visitation
[38:57] now mary and elizabeth were related
[39:01] they were relatives they were first
[39:02] cases
[39:04] and g and john were six months senior to
[39:08] jesus
[39:10] then mary
[39:11] elizabeth gave birth the first
[39:14] and after mary gave birth to jesus
[39:18] and the two
[39:20] visited to each other i would imagine
[39:23] jesus and john crawled together
[39:26] i would imagine there are some clues
[39:29] that john had that were handed down to
[39:32] jesus
[39:34] because john and jesus were relatives
[39:38] [Music]
[39:39] but later on john goes into a ministry
[39:43] and he determines that i will introduce
[39:45] the messiah
[39:47] hallelujah
[39:48] and he disrupts the religious order of
[39:52] the day
[39:54] and people are coming out of their
[39:55] churches
[39:56] they say the messiah is coming and john
[39:59] is going to introduce the messiah
[40:03] and john kept on saying i don't know him
[40:06] but when i will know him i will
[40:08] introduce him
[40:10] and the time came when john introduced
[40:13] the messiah then he introduced his
[40:16] cousin
[40:17] [Music]
[40:21] there are tense of john
[40:23] where he's preaching i don't know him
[40:26] there is spoken weight of john where he
[40:29] says i don't know him
[40:31] but jordan introduces a man
[40:34] that he played with
[40:37] a man that he crawled with
[40:39] johnny introduces his own relative as
[40:42] the messiah
[40:44] tell me
[40:46] if you were in john's church where are
[40:47] you going to
[40:50] stay brothers are your ministers are you
[40:53] here
[40:54] i can imagine ministers having ministers
[40:57] meeting
[40:58] but here he said he doesn't know him
[41:01] but now he introduced the very man that
[41:03] he was playing with
[41:07] john is lying that's what they would
[41:09] have said
[41:11] if there was internet during that time
[41:13] they would have created websites
[41:15] john de la
[41:20] are you still with me
[41:23] the messiah that johnny introduced was
[41:26] his own cousin
[41:28] i want you i want that to sink in
[41:31] so that you understand that when god
[41:34] delivers his weight he is not obligated
[41:37] to any man except those that receive it
[41:41] by revelation
[41:43] [Applause]
[41:46] i hope we are together
[41:49] it was of course the split
[41:51] in the church
[41:53] some would have said he lied
[41:55] we are no longer coming to church
[41:58] here we've got it unaligned he said he
[42:01] doesn't know who the messiah will be but
[42:04] he introduced his own cousin it's a
[42:06] family business
[42:11] some would have preached we will never
[42:13] fall for that family business we came
[42:17] out of there
[42:18] not knowing that it was the very messiah
[42:22] now i want us to go and look
[42:25] why would john say
[42:27] i did not know him
[42:29] and yet he grew up with jesus
[42:32] and i want us to look at the first
[42:34] coming
[42:36] the introduction of the first coming and
[42:38] see even the introduction in the second
[42:41] coming
[42:42] if the first coming required revelation
[42:45] the second coming will require
[42:47] revelation
[42:50] i hope we are together
[42:53] now
[42:55] let's come to this
[42:58] maybe before i read this
[43:01] when you read the life of jesus
[43:05] it speaks about when he was born
[43:09] and how he was dedicated in the temple
[43:12] later how he was in the temple at the
[43:14] age of 12 years
[43:16] and later after 12 years we heard
[43:19] nothing about jesus
[43:22] the only time we hear about jesus again
[43:25] is when he is 30 years
[43:27] 18 years of jesus life is not in the
[43:30] bible
[43:32] the bible is silent
[43:34] about 18 years of jesus life
[43:39] are you with me
[43:41] i hope we are together
[43:44] now let's get
[43:45] into the business of the day
[43:48] god's gifts always find to their places
[43:50] paragraph 93.
[43:54] the prophet says
[43:57] the brothers are
[43:58] this evening i would want quotations
[44:00] because
[44:03] it's good when people see what we read
[44:05] about
[44:06] amen they say not brother money is that
[44:09] a new spoken weight no it's the very one
[44:11] that i found in trinidad
[44:15] now 93
[44:17] now notice
[44:20] and after them the wise men identifying
[44:23] him what he would be
[44:25] and we find through the scripture that's
[44:28] exactly what he was
[44:30] deity
[44:32] in savings for death
[44:35] what for dieting service to god for
[44:37] death
[44:39] jesus was deity in service for death
[44:43] to redeem the world
[44:45] but what did the world do they refused
[44:48] it
[44:49] they rejected it
[44:51] why
[44:53] some of them a big part of them
[44:56] did that because of this
[44:59] because he did die
[45:02] they said he couldn't be deity and die
[45:06] he couldn't be deity and die
[45:10] this is where even the muslims have got
[45:12] a problem
[45:14] that how can you say jesus is god but he
[45:17] died
[45:20] now the prophet says
[45:23] the man
[45:24] the man
[45:26] the body
[45:28] was not idiot
[45:40] the body the man the body
[45:44] was not a deity
[45:46] but deity
[45:48] was in the boat
[45:52] this body has to perish
[45:55] now let's pause here for a while
[45:59] that means when john played with jesus
[46:03] he took him as just a man
[46:07] he did not know that jesus was more than
[46:10] a man
[46:12] he played with him as a man
[46:16] but what made
[46:17] john
[46:18] now to recognize jesus as the messiah is
[46:22] when he saw the deity
[46:24] in the body
[46:27] william branham and i have said many
[46:29] times even here last night
[46:32] william branham's minister was the great
[46:34] test for what is the was the most
[46:37] difficult ministry
[46:40] john's ministry was easier
[46:42] because god said you will introduce the
[46:45] messiah
[46:46] but it was john and jesus two police
[46:51] but in the end time god says to william
[46:53] branham we want to introduce the messiah
[46:57] but this time he will not come in
[46:59] another body he will use your body with
[47:02] branham
[47:05] so it was easy for john to say behold
[47:09] the lamb of god
[47:10] but it was difficult for william branham
[47:12] to say
[47:14] he's here
[47:16] and he was going to ask where
[47:19] hallelujah so william had to speak in
[47:22] parables so that the bride can read
[47:25] between the lines
[47:30] william brennaman was naughty son of man
[47:33] william brennan was a son of man
[47:35] veiling this son of man revealing this
[47:39] kind of man within a son of man
[47:44] [Applause]
[47:46] we're gonna have a good time this
[47:48] evening
[47:49] no matter my voice we're going to define
[47:52] that we're going to have a good time
[47:56] now
[47:58] i want us to follow this thought i like
[48:00] it when brother george was here he says
[48:04] god
[48:05] sometimes will lead you to certain
[48:07] avenues
[48:08] and you need to go and search in those
[48:11] avenues
[48:12] now when brother abraham says
[48:15] and this is where we want to explain to
[48:18] the
[48:18] muslims to the hindus
[48:21] to everyone
[48:23] when we say jesus christ is god
[48:26] what do we mean
[48:29] because they get confused because they
[48:31] say how can you say it's god but he was
[48:33] born
[48:35] how can you say he was god but he was
[48:37] tired how can you say he was god but he
[48:40] died
[48:41] god
[48:42] can never be born
[48:47] expected a amen human than that
[48:50] god can never be a baby
[48:56] we're going to get into things here
[48:58] relax
[49:00] jesus learned how to speak as a baby
[49:04] god cannot learn how to speak as a baby
[49:09] i am glad you are coming on the edge of
[49:11] your seat and you say where is he going
[49:15] don't forget the body is not in the
[49:18] deity but the deity was in the body
[49:23] you cannot
[49:25] kill the deity
[49:26] you cannot give birth to the deity the
[49:30] deity has got no beginning and the deity
[49:33] shall ever never have an end
[49:36] but the body can have the beginning and
[49:39] the body can have an end
[49:41] are we gonna have a good time
[49:45] and this will help the catholic as well
[49:48] because they think mary was the mother
[49:51] of jesus
[49:52] god cannot have a mother
[49:55] but the body can have a mother
[50:00] do you believe brother branham
[50:03] because i'm going to read quotations
[50:05] here
[50:07] now i'm glad i'm preaching to ephesians
[50:09] tabernacle ephesians brother broom says
[50:12] it was
[50:13] a scriptural historian's church
[50:17] there are certain things that you can't
[50:18] preach to the corinthians
[50:22] but the efficient material you can
[50:24] preach to and i believe the entire right
[50:27] in the end time is the efficient
[50:29] material
[50:31] because we must have another
[50:33] efficiency
[50:35] god is perfected in three joshua's
[50:37] deficient book and paul comes with
[50:40] efficient book in the end time you must
[50:42] have the third episode
[50:45] [Applause]
[50:47] now listen here
[50:49] in the message paradox
[50:53] paragraph 279
[50:56] i'm glad i'm preaching this message
[50:58] brother james because i wanted to relax
[51:03] now
[51:05] brother branham says
[51:07] are you always in the quotation
[51:10] all right
[51:11] he says look here
[51:14] speaking of mary
[51:16] she said your father and i
[51:18] have sought you
[51:20] for day and night
[51:23] with tears
[51:25] she discredited her first testimony
[51:28] because she was saying
[51:30] joseph wasn't the father but now i say
[51:32] your father and i were looking for you
[51:35] she called to joseph his father
[51:38] and we know joseph was not the father
[51:42] now look
[51:44] at this 12 year old boy
[51:47] not knowing what he said
[51:50] he was just
[51:52] a boy
[51:54] but he was the weight
[51:56] see he said
[51:57] knowing what i must be
[52:00] about my father's business
[52:03] see the weight correcting the error
[52:07] the word will always correct the error
[52:12] see
[52:14] she was giving testimony
[52:17] after he was raised up it was all over
[52:19] now see
[52:21] your father and i have sought you
[52:24] she said she had conceived this child by
[52:27] the holy ghost
[52:29] and then calling joseph the father
[52:33] and this little boy
[52:35] 12 year old child
[52:38] no wisdom at all why
[52:41] but just a 12 year old
[52:44] 12
[52:45] 12 year old boy
[52:48] the father
[52:50] didn't trail in him
[52:53] at that time
[52:55] and we're reading quotation here
[52:58] is that to the message of the hour
[53:00] the father
[53:02] didn't dwell in him at that time
[53:06] because
[53:08] hallelujah
[53:11] because he come on the day when he
[53:14] baptized me
[53:16] [Applause]
[53:19] he saw the spirit coming down
[53:22] and went into him
[53:25] but look this little 12 year old boy
[53:28] being the weight he was born the
[53:30] anointed one see
[53:32] to be
[53:33] [Music]
[53:35] do you see
[53:37] every weight is there for a reason
[53:39] to be the anointed one
[53:44] and then he was
[53:46] knowing he knows that i must be about my
[53:49] father's business
[53:52] we said the body was not the deity but
[53:55] the deity was in the boat
[53:58] brother branham said at 12 years the
[54:00] father was not in him yet
[54:03] [Music]
[54:05] hallelujah
[54:08] john knew jesus
[54:11] john was raised with jesus
[54:14] but what john was waiting for
[54:17] was waiting for something to come into
[54:19] the body
[54:21] to identify the body
[54:25] as long as there was nothing coming into
[54:28] the body the body was ordinary
[54:32] for 18 years the bible says nothing
[54:35] about jesus but he was around
[54:40] we thank god for the prophet
[54:43] let's go and check what the prophet says
[54:45] about those 18 years
[54:49] in the message jesus christ is the same
[54:51] yesterday today and forever
[54:54] paragraph 3 0.
[54:57] the prophet says
[54:59] and with such a shifting condition as we
[55:02] are today
[55:03] how can faith rest itself you've got to
[55:06] come back to the bible
[55:09] back to the truth
[55:11] when jesus
[55:13] a carpenter's son
[55:15] physically speaking
[55:18] when he come to the fda that's all he
[55:21] was known of
[55:24] the day that when john baptized him
[55:27] god
[55:28] vindicated him
[55:31] god spoke from the heavens and john saw
[55:35] him john saw him
[55:40] john saw him
[55:42] coming
[55:44] in the form of a tower
[55:47] and certainly this is my beloved son
[55:50] in whom i'm pleased to drive
[55:53] the right translation there is in home
[55:56] and place to join in
[55:59] jesus immediately anointed with god
[56:04] he was just a man
[56:07] oh come on
[56:10] he was a man till that time
[56:14] but now he becomes
[56:16] the god man
[56:19] now his mother and trusted john's cousin
[56:23] now he's the messiah
[56:26] the boy now is anointed
[56:30] in the unveiling of god
[56:33] brother says anointing is a person
[56:37] god it's a direct quotation
[56:41] are you still with me
[56:43] now
[56:44] now
[56:47] somebody says wait a minute brother
[56:50] madiva
[56:52] but when jesus was born
[56:54] he was called emmanuel which means god
[56:57] with us so when you say the father came
[57:00] into him at the river jordan what do you
[57:02] mean
[57:05] because he was born he was immanuel
[57:08] now you've got to understand
[57:11] the language and the potential the
[57:14] potential
[57:15] i am not in south africa now
[57:18] am i correct
[57:21] but if somebody gets lost and comes into
[57:23] the street i stay in protea avenue
[57:27] if somebody comes into my street
[57:30] and maybe storms by my neighbor's house
[57:34] and say
[57:35] where is madiba
[57:39] where are they going to point
[57:42] they're not going to bring their dream
[57:43] without
[57:45] they're going to bring their what
[57:48] even though i'm not in my house
[57:50] it doesn't change the fact that it is my
[57:53] house
[57:57] even if i'm not in the house it is still
[58:00] my house
[58:02] and when i live trinidad i am returning
[58:04] back to my house
[58:15] one
[58:23] did you find it
[58:29] behold
[58:31] i will send my messenger it's joy
[58:35] and he shall prepare the way before me
[58:39] and the lord
[58:41] whom you seek
[58:44] shall suddenly
[58:46] come
[58:48] to
[58:50] the temple is not to the lord
[58:53] it's not the lord
[58:54] but the temple is of the lord
[58:57] are you here
[59:00] the lord that you
[59:02] seek whom you seek
[59:05] shall suddenly come to his temple
[59:08] even the messenger of the covenant whom
[59:11] you delight in behold you shall come
[59:14] save the lord of hosts
[59:16] jesus was the temple of god do we agree
[59:21] and the lord that is the sword suddenly
[59:23] came into his temple
[59:26] i hope we are together here
[59:29] now
[59:30] let's come to this
[59:34] there is a scripture that i want us to
[59:36] read my brother
[59:37] isaiah 9
[59:39] 6.
[59:48] if you have found it you can say amen
[59:53] isaiah 9 6
[59:59] it says
[1:00:01] for unto us a child is born
[1:00:06] unto us a son is giving
[1:00:09] and the government shall be upon his
[1:00:11] shoulder
[1:00:12] and his name shall be called wonderful
[1:00:16] counselor
[1:00:17] the mighty god
[1:00:19] the everlasting father
[1:00:21] the prince of peace
[1:00:24] now
[1:00:25] when you read this scripture like a
[1:00:27] newspaper
[1:00:29] you're going to make the body the deity
[1:00:34] when the prophet says the bible is not
[1:00:36] the deity but the deity was in the body
[1:00:40] can we read the scripture again
[1:00:43] this time not like a newspaper
[1:00:45] but by revelation
[1:00:48] for
[1:00:49] other people
[1:00:51] that understand english in the building
[1:00:55] are they going to help us with english
[1:00:58] for unto us a child is born
[1:01:02] is that a past tense
[1:01:05] present tense future tense
[1:01:10] is what
[1:01:11] present tense for unto us a child is
[1:01:15] about present tense i will do agree
[1:01:19] unto us a sign is given
[1:01:22] is that future tense or present tense
[1:01:27] then
[1:01:28] and the government shall be upon his
[1:01:31] shoulder
[1:01:33] is that present tense or future tense
[1:01:37] hallelujah
[1:01:38] why is isaiah taking a call
[1:01:45] why couldn't he keep on saying for unto
[1:01:47] us a child is born unto us a son is
[1:01:50] given the government is upon us why he
[1:01:53] says the government shall be upon his
[1:01:56] his shoulder
[1:01:59] and his name shall be called
[1:02:09] his name is called why he said he shall
[1:02:12] be called
[1:02:13] wonderful counselor the mighty god the
[1:02:16] everlasting father the prince of peace
[1:02:20] and to us a child is born jesus
[1:02:23] unto us a sign is given jesus
[1:02:26] but the government shall be upon his
[1:02:29] shoulders
[1:02:30] his name shall be called wonderful
[1:02:33] counselor the mighty god the everlasting
[1:02:36] father the prince of peace what is going
[1:02:38] to make a chance to be called this
[1:02:40] somebody must come into the church
[1:02:45] are you i hope you are here with me this
[1:02:47] evening
[1:02:49] jesus never answered the disciples who
[1:02:52] do men say i am
[1:02:54] i'm the son of man i am before jonathan
[1:02:58] after jordan he said who do men say i
[1:03:01] the son of man em
[1:03:03] and peter
[1:03:05] a mystical channel opened
[1:03:08] and a revelation dropped from eternity
[1:03:11] and it dropped into the heart of peter
[1:03:13] and peter said thou art christ
[1:03:17] the son of the living god
[1:03:20] thou art anointed
[1:03:24] somebody will be with me here
[1:03:28] jesus christ is not the same name of
[1:03:30] jesus amen
[1:03:33] when we say jesus christ it's not like
[1:03:34] when we say rattan and george
[1:03:37] no say jesus is the name of the temple
[1:03:42] christ is the anointed one
[1:03:48] are you still with me
[1:03:51] now after jonathan
[1:03:53] he was not just a man he was murdered a
[1:03:56] man he was a dual bee
[1:04:00] when he was tired he was a man
[1:04:04] but when he came to the storm he was
[1:04:06] more than a man
[1:04:08] when he went to the graveyard salazar
[1:04:11] was crying he was a man
[1:04:13] but when he said
[1:04:15] he loved the roots
[1:04:18] it was not a man
[1:04:19] it was more than a man
[1:04:22] it was the father in the temple
[1:04:28] [Applause]
[1:04:31] the jews the series the scribes they
[1:04:35] never had a problem when you called him
[1:04:36] jesus
[1:04:38] no they were fine but to call him christ
[1:04:42] to call him christ
[1:04:46] that's why he said to them before
[1:04:48] abraham i am
[1:04:51] and they said but you are not yet to 50
[1:04:53] how can you say you already know father
[1:04:56] abraham he said abraham shot my dead and
[1:05:00] he rejoiced
[1:05:03] who was speaking it was not the body
[1:05:06] that came through mary
[1:05:08] it was something that was there before
[1:05:11] that conception
[1:05:15] it was the very one that john coming
[1:05:18] into his temple
[1:05:21] i can imagine john
[1:05:23] after he preaches that sermon
[1:05:26] and he said he made history he's among
[1:05:29] you but god will identify him and when
[1:05:32] the heaven opened
[1:05:33] and he saw the father in the form of the
[1:05:35] town
[1:05:36] coming down and coming into the castle
[1:05:39] john myself said what am i going to tell
[1:05:42] the people
[1:05:43] [Music]
[1:05:44] how what someone am i going to preach
[1:05:47] that my cousin is the messiah
[1:05:53] what applies to jesus applies to you
[1:05:57] you empowered your family
[1:06:00] and they raised you
[1:06:02] and they taught you how to speak
[1:06:04] and they affect you
[1:06:06] but they did not know
[1:06:08] the word is not a deity
[1:06:10] but the two was coming into their body
[1:06:14] and today
[1:06:16] today
[1:06:27] yes you get sick
[1:06:29] yes you get tired yes you get
[1:06:31] discouraged
[1:06:37] hallelujah
[1:06:46] no wonder the problem says that yet is
[1:06:49] not in heaven
[1:06:50] but the deities in you
[1:06:53] christ the hope of glory
[1:06:56] we're not worshiping christ in a manger
[1:06:59] worshiping christ in you
[1:07:04] you look at me as a man yes i'm a man
[1:07:07] but there is something within me
[1:07:10] hallelujah
[1:07:20] [Applause]
[1:07:28] [Music]
[1:07:41] he says
[1:07:43] the greatest
[1:07:45] of all revelations
[1:07:48] the greatest of all revelations
[1:07:51] is the deity
[1:07:53] the supreme deity of our lord jesus
[1:07:56] christ
[1:07:57] you can't get your first base until you
[1:08:00] believe that
[1:08:03] you can't get anywhere until you believe
[1:08:06] that
[1:08:08] amen because that's very crucial
[1:08:13] let's follow this
[1:08:16] in the message the
[1:08:22] communion what is looking for that
[1:08:25] quotation
[1:08:27] is something that comes in my mind
[1:08:31] it is in the message
[1:08:33] spiritual fruit induces it
[1:08:36] brother branham says if jesus
[1:08:39] if christ can come this evening
[1:08:43] with his body
[1:08:45] with hands a piece
[1:08:47] and with blood oozing out of his body
[1:08:50] he says i will reject him
[1:08:54] he says because it is not the season
[1:08:56] for that body
[1:08:58] but it says if he comes
[1:09:00] in the form of my brother and my sister
[1:09:03] i will accept him
[1:09:05] this is john 14 verse 20 and that day
[1:09:08] you shall know that i am in the father
[1:09:10] the father in me and i in you
[1:09:14] it's a three form
[1:09:16] we are now in the season where it is
[1:09:30] 44
[1:09:32] the prophet says but in that great
[1:09:34] crucial hour
[1:09:36] until he suffered
[1:09:39] knowing all things
[1:09:41] until the father
[1:09:44] until the
[1:09:45] water and blood separated because of
[1:09:47] strain
[1:09:49] in his body
[1:09:51] and grated drops of sweat like blood
[1:09:54] dropped from his brow
[1:09:56] he died
[1:09:58] more death in gentleman
[1:10:00] than he did on the cross
[1:10:04] you can go anywhere in the world you
[1:10:06] will never find this phrase
[1:10:08] it's only the prophet that said it he
[1:10:10] died more death
[1:10:12] in german than on the cross
[1:10:17] what does it mean
[1:10:19] we have to follow and check what does he
[1:10:21] mean
[1:10:23] did he die in case man
[1:10:26] but the prophecy he died more death
[1:10:29] in gentleman
[1:10:31] down on the cross
[1:10:33] and your prophet comes don't forget what
[1:10:36] brother defines death to be he said
[1:10:39] death is separation
[1:10:47] [Applause]
[1:10:51] in the message it is the rising of this
[1:10:53] heart
[1:10:55] paragraph 241
[1:10:59] he says
[1:11:02] let's wait for the brother i like when
[1:11:04] you see this quotations
[1:11:07] the spirit left him
[1:11:10] the spirit left him
[1:11:13] in the garden of gazima
[1:11:17] he had to die amen
[1:11:20] remember friends
[1:11:22] he didn't have to do that
[1:11:24] that was god
[1:11:27] god anointed that flesh
[1:11:29] which was human flesh
[1:11:32] if he had went up there as god
[1:11:35] he would have never died
[1:11:37] that kind of death
[1:11:39] you can kill god
[1:11:44] you can kill god
[1:11:46] but you can kill his temper
[1:11:48] you can even handle his temper but you
[1:11:51] can never kill god
[1:11:56] if he says the spirit left him in the
[1:11:58] kind of gentleman with spirits
[1:12:02] i'm asking which
[1:12:03] spirit
[1:12:06] when did the spirit come into him your
[1:12:08] prophet told you everyone shall die
[1:12:12] the same one that came into the river
[1:12:14] jordan he left him in catamount
[1:12:17] he died more than catholic than on the
[1:12:20] cross
[1:12:21] because god left him and said you have
[1:12:24] to go and die
[1:12:26] but god cannot die
[1:12:28] but his flesh can die
[1:12:33] this place can die
[1:12:35] but what is in this place can never die
[1:12:39] you can't kill god
[1:12:44] there is a part within you that shall
[1:12:46] never be killed
[1:12:48] there is a path within you that shall
[1:12:51] never be contained by the truth
[1:12:56] yes
[1:13:17] i
[1:13:44] it's a divine introduction
[1:13:51] same spirit
[1:13:53] that came into him
[1:13:56] and remember jordan
[1:13:58] left him in german
[1:14:01] do you see
[1:14:03] if you make the body
[1:14:05] brother judge
[1:14:07] because of lack of revelation
[1:14:10] and because of laziness to study the
[1:14:12] message that's why we have ended up with
[1:14:15] people introducing trueness doctrine in
[1:14:18] the message
[1:14:20] when they say here's jesus in the in the
[1:14:22] river and here is the father coming that
[1:14:25] means when the children protest meets is
[1:14:28] the scripture
[1:14:30] we don't believe in trueness we don't
[1:14:32] believe in trilogy
[1:14:34] and please
[1:14:47] same spirit
[1:14:49] that came into him in river georgia
[1:14:52] left him yes sir in
[1:14:55] so that he can die
[1:14:57] like a man
[1:14:59] when john says i knew him not
[1:15:02] he did not refer to the body
[1:15:04] he knew the body
[1:15:06] he played with the body he learned how
[1:15:09] to talk with the body but there was
[1:15:11] something that came into the body that
[1:15:14] identified to the body
[1:15:16] they played with you
[1:15:18] they grew up with you they know your
[1:15:21] name they went to school with you they
[1:15:24] worked with you but you only know the
[1:15:26] body but the message
[1:15:29] to introduce something that is
[1:15:41] i am not in this jacket
[1:15:43] if it gets one out i take it off
[1:15:46] and i throw it away
[1:15:48] you are wearing a boot
[1:15:55] and as this go by
[1:15:57] i can see grey hairs in the building
[1:16:00] the body is getting weaker
[1:16:02] but as it gets quicker something is
[1:16:04] getting stronger
[1:16:06] as they are what can perish
[1:16:17] do you now see
[1:16:19] why it was not easy to have john's
[1:16:21] ministry
[1:16:23] johnny had to introduce his
[1:16:27] cousin
[1:16:28] as the messiah
[1:16:33] amen
[1:16:34] let's come to our time all right are we
[1:16:37] talking to you about the first
[1:16:38] introduction
[1:16:40] can we move to the second one
[1:16:44] let's come to our time
[1:16:47] i was showing you what happened today i
[1:16:49] want to bring what's happening here
[1:16:50] today
[1:16:52] [Music]
[1:16:53] will bring them
[1:16:56] came
[1:16:58] to introduce
[1:17:00] christ
[1:17:03] now
[1:17:05] i think
[1:17:07] pastor green was here
[1:17:10] tonight's
[1:17:12] brother george
[1:17:14] introduced him
[1:17:17] brother theo was not here
[1:17:19] you couldn't introduce brother phil when
[1:17:21] he's not around
[1:17:23] you can introduce somebody in absentia
[1:17:27] you introduce the person that is
[1:17:30] so brother branham had
[1:17:32] his ministry was to introduce
[1:17:36] he cannot introduce christ
[1:17:38] in christ absentia
[1:17:41] let's carry on with it
[1:17:46] [Applause]
[1:17:50] i want to show you
[1:17:54] why
[1:17:56] great men
[1:17:59] like
[1:18:00] brother baxter
[1:18:04] you know
[1:18:06] in the midst of the present stage of my
[1:18:08] ministry
[1:18:10] brother brahma says
[1:18:14] when he preaches about
[1:18:17] who's this gentleman that left paul
[1:18:23] dimas
[1:18:24] brother brennaman he says brother baxter
[1:18:28] he said to me when i came to heaven
[1:18:32] i want to look for jimas
[1:18:35] and asked him as how can you leave
[1:18:38] that great messenger
[1:18:40] of god
[1:18:43] now
[1:18:45] isn't exactly what brother baxter did
[1:18:48] when he left brother branham
[1:18:51] what i'm simply saying is don't become
[1:18:55] the spirit that you're fighting against
[1:18:58] [Music]
[1:19:00] if you fight a spirit without this
[1:19:03] spirit you can become the very thing
[1:19:06] that you're fighting
[1:19:18] now
[1:19:22] people like
[1:19:23] great men
[1:19:25] they loved the festival ministry yeah
[1:19:29] they loved the second pool
[1:19:32] but when he came to the third pool
[1:19:35] even people like
[1:19:37] child osborne
[1:19:39] said brother brennan has lost his mind
[1:19:42] but they are attracted
[1:19:44] i remember tell osborn first night
[1:19:48] it was his wife that went to the meeting
[1:19:51] and came back and told brother tell
[1:19:53] husband say
[1:19:54] it was such an annoying thing
[1:19:57] and brother taylor osborne was a
[1:19:59] chairman of a denominational
[1:20:01] organization that had arranged a
[1:20:03] convention he absconded from his own
[1:20:06] convention to come and attend brother
[1:20:08] brown's meeting
[1:20:11] and he was moved by what he saw
[1:20:14] but in the latter years he said brother
[1:20:17] brethren had lost his mind
[1:20:19] we want to follow what does it mean
[1:20:22] what made them to go away
[1:20:25] and what makes us to stay
[1:20:33] amen now
[1:20:35] in the message
[1:20:37] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:20:40] and forever
[1:20:42] paragraph 181
[1:20:44] i want you to pay attention
[1:20:47] because dates are going to be important
[1:20:51] because you are tracking
[1:20:52] what brother branham was saying remember
[1:20:55] to be a good student of the message
[1:20:58] don't take one quotation and run with it
[1:21:02] you must check community in the message
[1:21:08] now
[1:21:10] brethren says
[1:21:12] when in one jesus christ the same
[1:21:14] yesterday forever
[1:21:16] this was on the 18th
[1:21:19] of july
[1:21:21] 1962.
[1:21:24] he says
[1:21:25] he's in prayer
[1:21:28] he says heavenly father
[1:21:31] we are grateful to know that we are
[1:21:33] living in this last day
[1:21:36] just before the coming of that just one
[1:21:39] that wonderful glorious
[1:21:41] loving son of yours
[1:21:43] our lord jesus our lord and savior jesus
[1:21:47] christ
[1:21:48] who we love
[1:21:50] we know the world speaks of an appearing
[1:21:54] before
[1:21:57] we know the bible speaks of
[1:22:00] before
[1:22:03] and there is a great difference in the
[1:22:05] word appearing
[1:22:07] and then
[1:22:08] coming amen
[1:22:11] are you with me
[1:22:12] stay with the prophet messenger there is
[1:22:15] somewhere where he's going he says there
[1:22:16] is a difference between the appeal and
[1:22:19] the copy
[1:22:23] then you come
[1:22:25] in the message leading
[1:22:27] of the spirit of god
[1:22:29] paragraph 25.
[1:22:32] he says the messiah saw that
[1:22:35] and they said there will be a star rise
[1:22:37] i'll be watching for it today so it
[1:22:40] what did jesus say would take place just
[1:22:42] about this time
[1:22:44] and i will restore to the people all the
[1:22:47] glory of the farmer and i will pour out
[1:22:49] upon them the former in the lottery
[1:22:52] and the signs and wonders that was in
[1:22:54] the first church will be in the second
[1:22:57] church at the last day
[1:23:00] here is your sign
[1:23:02] he is appearing on the earth
[1:23:06] signs and wonders
[1:23:09] the same thing that he did his year
[1:23:11] again his spirit
[1:23:14] moving among the people
[1:23:17] this was on the seventh
[1:23:19] of august 1955
[1:23:22] he says he is appearing on the earth now
[1:23:26] are you still with me
[1:23:28] 25th may 1962
[1:23:32] in the message convinced to then consent
[1:23:37] paragraph 31 i want you to pay attention
[1:23:40] to dates
[1:23:42] 21st
[1:23:44] may
[1:23:45] 1962
[1:23:47] of 31 do you love the message
[1:23:51] don't sleep on me this is very critical
[1:23:59] if somebody sleeps next to you just
[1:24:01] nudge them and says you are still funny
[1:24:02] sleeping as well
[1:24:10] convince and consent

[1:24:18] now john was so sure that he was going
[1:24:20] to see the messiah until he said he is
[1:24:22] in our midst now
[1:24:25] now watch notice
[1:24:27] there is a great big difference in the
[1:24:30] sign of jesus appearing and then jesus
[1:24:34] coming
[1:24:36] there is two different words means two
[1:24:40] different things
[1:24:41] the appearing of the lord and the coming
[1:24:45] of the lord
[1:24:48] now
[1:24:49] the appearing of the lord is
[1:24:53] the appearing of the lord is
[1:24:57] when was that now 21st of may
[1:25:00] 1962

[1:25:08] when is appearing in his people his
[1:25:12] people
[1:25:13] working among them proving that it's him
[1:25:16] with them getting them ready for the
[1:25:19] rapture for the coming of the lord to
[1:25:22] catch up with the bride
[1:25:24] they are building and they're coming
[1:25:29] let's move from may
[1:25:31] and go on the 8th of june a month

[1:25:46] so the lord
[1:25:48] is now

[1:25:52] great in science great signs and oneness
[1:25:56] raising the date
[1:25:58] healing the sick
[1:26:00] doing the very same things that he did
[1:26:02] that hasn't been done for 2000 years
[1:26:06] the church is run up through that
[1:26:08] brought up till it's right at the time
[1:26:11] the headstone is coming to me to the
[1:26:14] church
[1:26:14] then it will all go together and be
[1:26:17] raptured
[1:26:19] the words fell asleep in the first watch
[1:26:21] second watch third watch onto the
[1:26:24] seventh watch the appearance of the lord
[1:26:27] last night i touch it our house would
[1:26:30] come so brother enemy is calling
[1:26:33] the healing of the sick

[1:26:38] of the lord
[1:26:41] are you with me
[1:26:46] same month
[1:26:48] few days later 11th of june
[1:26:52] 1962
[1:26:53] you're gonna love this
[1:26:56] you know there is a difference
[1:26:59] between the appearing of christ and the
[1:27:01] coming of christ
[1:27:03] that's two different rates altogether
[1:27:06] he is appearing now
[1:27:08] in his church
[1:27:10] we see him
[1:27:11] we know it's him
[1:27:13] it's the holy spirit see we know it is
[1:27:16] here again on the 11th of june he says
[1:27:20] it is the appeal of the lord
[1:27:24] the message from that time
[1:27:28] now this is on the 13th of july
[1:27:32] 1962
[1:27:34] a month later
[1:27:37] paragraph 102
[1:27:41] he says how many knows
[1:27:43] there is a difference between the
[1:27:45] appearing of christ and the coming of
[1:27:47] christ is two different ways
[1:27:50] now is the appearing
[1:27:53] the coming will soon be
[1:27:55] the coming will
[1:27:56] be
[1:27:58] this is now july on the 13th of july
[1:28:01] 1962 he tells you it is appearing now
[1:28:05] the coming week should be
[1:28:10] he is appearing in the midst of us
[1:28:12] doing the works that he once did in his
[1:28:15] church
[1:28:16] now you're part of that church by grace
[1:28:18] you believe i'm a member of that church
[1:28:22] now i'm not a preacher
[1:28:24] you know i'm not
[1:28:26] i'm not i have not the education to do
[1:28:30] it
[1:28:31] sometimes i feel reluctant standing here
[1:28:33] by men of god who's called you to that
[1:28:36] office
[1:28:37] there are apostles
[1:28:39] prophets
[1:28:40] teachers
[1:28:41] pastors and evangelists
[1:28:44] not all apostles
[1:28:46] not all our prophets
[1:28:48] not all teachers
[1:28:50] not all evangelists i'm standing here
[1:28:54] but my ministry
[1:28:57] is a different ministry
[1:29:01] from a pastor or a teacher
[1:29:04] let me pause here
[1:29:07] the five-fold i'm gonna say this
[1:29:10] the five-fold ministry
[1:29:13] must be liked by the holy ghost today
[1:29:19] i'll repeat
[1:29:20] the five-fold ministry
[1:29:23] must be led by the holy ghost today
[1:29:28] not by library distributors
[1:29:33] [Music]
[1:29:36] i'll repeat the whole the five-fold
[1:29:39] ministry must be led by the holy ghost
[1:29:43] not by led readings
[1:29:50] i'm not afraid to say that
[1:29:53] the five-fold ministry must be led by
[1:29:56] the holy ghost
[1:29:58] and the holy ghost will show you the
[1:30:00] message of the mothers of the time
[1:30:03] they must never be ranked by
[1:30:07] why am i saying that
[1:30:09] it's because people today are saying
[1:30:11] brother brother is a pastor
[1:30:14] how can a prophet of the age be a pastor
[1:30:17] the part of this church is not a brother
[1:30:19] brother he's brother george
[1:30:22] the prophet is a dispensational prophet
[1:30:26] he operates about the five point
[1:30:29] ministry
[1:30:31] and the fight foreign ministry is
[1:30:34] subject to the prophet
[1:30:38] the people said to joshua
[1:30:40] we will follow you
[1:30:42] as long as
[1:30:44] the god that was with moses
[1:30:47] is with thee
[1:30:49] we will follow you
[1:30:51] as long as the law of moses shall never
[1:30:54] depart your time
[1:30:56] and you the church in the end time
[1:30:59] must tell the faithful ministry
[1:31:27] must never depart your
[1:31:42] so even if we remain 40 years later
[1:32:10] is
[1:32:22] but you can never correct the process
[1:32:41] let me give you confidence in this
[1:32:43] message
[1:32:46] you know moses struck the road twice
[1:32:49] instead of once
[1:32:52] was wrong
[1:32:54] but in his wrongness
[1:32:56] god made it right
[1:32:58] because when he strikes the rock is tied
[1:33:01] to the crucifixion of christ
[1:33:04] but now
[1:33:05] many struggle twice and god said that
[1:33:08] you never met him with this wrong amen
[1:33:11] 96 certainly the prophet comes from the
[1:33:13] prophet
[1:33:14] he says
[1:33:44] god
[1:34:03] i
[1:34:25] stay with the prophets
[1:34:43] is
[1:34:51] is
[1:35:18] and this message is
[1:35:28] [Applause]
[1:35:40] mystery
[1:35:42] is a different ministry
[1:35:44] from a pastor or a teacher
[1:35:47] i'm not
[1:35:48] if i say things president forgive me
[1:35:52] i don't mean it
[1:35:53] but this is my ministry
[1:35:56] this is my ministry
[1:35:58] to declare him
[1:36:22] ministry to declare him that he is here
[1:36:29] [Applause]
[1:36:32] still is 1962
[1:36:35] on the 13th of july
[1:36:37] now
[1:36:40] because as i carry on somebody said wait
[1:36:41] a minute
[1:36:43] but then then what happened
[1:36:45] at ohio river
[1:36:47] when he was baptizing
[1:36:49] the 17th person
[1:36:51] whether they're appearing
[1:36:53] or they're coming
[1:36:54] if there is a message question there
[1:36:56] must be a message
[1:37:02] in the message that anointed once
[1:37:04] at the end time
[1:37:07] paragraph 2 69.
[1:37:13] he says now i want you to know
[1:37:16] this
[1:37:17] show
[1:37:18] you then listen to this tape
[1:37:21] you might have thought today that i was
[1:37:22] trying to say some to say that about
[1:37:26] myself
[1:37:27] being that i was picking this message
[1:37:30] i have no more to do with it than
[1:37:32] nothing
[1:37:33] no more than just a voice
[1:37:36] and my voice even against my better
[1:37:38] judgment
[1:37:40] i wanted to be a trapper
[1:37:42] but it's the will of my father that i
[1:37:45] declared to do and determined you
[1:37:49] i wasn't the one
[1:37:51] i wasn't the one
[1:37:54] i wasn't the one
[1:37:57] another came that up yet
[1:38:00] down on the river
[1:38:02] remember that appearing in the coming is
[1:38:04] two different things
[1:38:06] then it tells you what happened at the
[1:38:08] river ohio it was the appearing
[1:38:19] i was only standing there
[1:38:21] when he appeared
[1:38:24] i'm not the one that performs these
[1:38:26] things
[1:38:27] and for tells these things that happens
[1:38:29] as perfect as they are
[1:38:31] i'm only one that's near when he does it
[1:38:35] i was the only voice that he used to say
[1:38:37] it
[1:38:39] it wasn't what i knew is what i just
[1:38:41] surrendered myself to
[1:38:43] that he spoke through
[1:38:46] isn't me
[1:38:47] it wasn't the seventh angel
[1:38:52] oh no
[1:38:53] it was the manifestation
[1:38:55] of the son of man
[1:38:58] it wasn't the angel
[1:39:00] his message it was the mystery that god
[1:39:03] unfolded
[1:39:05] it's not a name it's god
[1:39:08] the angel was thought to this son of man
[1:39:11] he was a messenger he was the messenger
[1:39:14] from the son of man
[1:39:16] the son of man is christ
[1:39:19] he is the one that you are feeling on
[1:39:21] you are not feeling on a man
[1:39:24] his way will fail but you are feeling
[1:39:27] feeling on the unfailing
[1:39:29] body weight of the son
[1:39:31] of man
[1:39:33] the message is not just a literature the
[1:39:36] message is the revelation of the son of
[1:39:39] man
[1:39:47] the mystery of our time
[1:39:50] the mystery of our time
[1:39:52] is the revelation of
[1:39:55] this argument
[1:39:57] within
[1:39:58] a son of man
[1:40:04] remember i gave you an example about
[1:40:07] how many powers to give you a banana
[1:40:10] without pills i want to eat it
[1:40:14] what i wonder where is this banana bee
[1:40:17] is it really a banana
[1:40:19] because you identify a by banana appears
[1:40:23] and you want to be the one that will
[1:40:25] open
[1:40:26] the bills
[1:40:27] and brother pranam was the pill
[1:40:30] and the banana is the diet
[1:40:33] and you receive to the banana but you
[1:40:36] had appeared a son of man
[1:40:39] to get to this son of name
[1:40:41] as this son of man was built within the
[1:40:44] son of man you cannot receive this son
[1:40:47] of man without a son of man
[1:40:51] you can never know christ without
[1:40:53] malachi of allah
[1:40:55] you can never know christ without jesus
[1:41:04] i must read this i must say this one
[1:41:07] more time
[1:41:10] our message
[1:41:12] is greater than tg's message
[1:41:18] our message is greater than creator
[1:41:21] crypto dweller
[1:41:24] our message is greater than jewelry
[1:41:26] austin
[1:41:27] our message is greater than
[1:41:30] mine is monroe's
[1:41:34] is a great preacher but his message does
[1:41:37] not have rapture in faith
[1:41:39] only one message
[1:41:59] come and smile to the entire
[1:42:01] the only way of escape is the message of
[1:42:03] the arm
[1:42:08] [Applause]
[1:42:09] revelation 10
[1:42:12] verse 1.
[1:42:14] and i saw

[1:44:12] but it's not for the public
[1:44:15] i say it's not for the public
[1:44:18] it's a total secret
[1:44:25] let me give you a testimony of her
[1:44:26] brother
[1:44:28] this brother was at a university
[1:44:34] and they were studying about the clouds
[1:44:37] out loud
[1:44:39] because they wanted to know was it a
[1:44:41] rain cloud what was happening so they
[1:44:44] had a lot of questions that it cannot be
[1:44:46] because of the altitude so there are
[1:44:48] many questions
[1:44:50] at university that they couldn't resolve
[1:44:53] with their lecturer
[1:44:55] and this brother was done with varsity
[1:44:59] and now he was waiting to get a job a
[1:45:01] few years later
[1:45:03] then he was moving around he was now a
[1:45:06] vendor selling merchandise from house to
[1:45:08] house
[1:45:11] then he goes to another brother's house
[1:45:14] he knocks on the door
[1:45:17] and the brother opens the door
[1:45:20] as he opens the door for this man that
[1:45:22] is selling merchandise
[1:45:25] the man his gaze is just above the
[1:45:27] brother he is captivated by something
[1:45:30] above the brother
[1:45:31] another person says can i help you
[1:45:34] then that man say forget why i'm here
[1:45:38] what is this
[1:45:39] it was the picture of the cloud above
[1:45:41] the brother
[1:45:42] then he says what do you mean
[1:45:45] he says
[1:45:46] we studied about this cloud at
[1:45:48] university
[1:45:49] we looked at it we couldn't find answers
[1:45:52] but today when you open the door
[1:45:55] and i saw that picture i saw the face of
[1:45:59] a man
[1:46:01] [Applause]
[1:46:02] we couldn't see it at university but
[1:46:05] today i see it
[1:46:07] and the brother said come in my body
[1:46:11] that is our lord jesus christ
[1:46:18] the desolated seat shall come shall
[1:46:22] capture the mystery of his second coming
[1:46:30] eye with me
[1:46:34] in the message the seventh seed
[1:46:39] he says
[1:46:41] you know when i came into the message in
[1:46:44] the early years
[1:46:45] i wanted to reach the 76
[1:46:48] because
[1:46:49] it was more like a
[1:46:51] final year of university of the message
[1:46:57] when i read as a youngster
[1:47:00] must have been 13
[1:47:02] i couldn't get anything i said oh
[1:47:04] brother doesn't say anything
[1:47:06] only to realize later that brother
[1:47:08] brahma is speaking in parables
[1:47:11] he says because if the devil catch it
[1:47:13] he's going to create fanaticism
[1:47:17] he says it may be time
[1:47:20] it may be the hour
[1:47:22] that this great person that we're
[1:47:24] expecting to rise on the scene
[1:47:26] may rise
[1:47:30] maybe this ministry
[1:47:32] that i've tried
[1:47:35] brothers if they can fold it
[1:47:37] that i've tried to take people back to
[1:47:40] the weight
[1:47:41] has laid
[1:47:43] a foundation
[1:47:45] and if it has
[1:47:47] i will be
[1:47:50] he can't leave
[1:47:52] unless the mighty angel is here
[1:47:54] because that quotation says the seventh
[1:47:56] angel messenger is on the earth at the
[1:47:58] time of this coming
[1:48:00] but it says if it has i will be leaving
[1:48:03] you for good
[1:48:06] there will be
[1:48:10] we want to tell every man in the message
[1:48:14] that wants to be an ex messenger
[1:48:17] it cannot be the two of you
[1:48:22] i will repeat one more time
[1:48:24] every man must decrease
[1:48:27] i say every man must
[1:48:29] decrease the lord jesus christ
[1:48:32] must increase
[1:48:37] [Applause]
[1:48:39] there won't be two of us here
[1:48:42] at the same time
[1:48:45] if it is
[1:48:48] he will increase
[1:48:50] and i will decrease
[1:48:53] let me stop you
[1:48:56] in the message
[1:48:58] after john you know the greatest danger
[1:49:03] in the scriptures
[1:49:04] it's always around transition
[1:49:09] when the minister moved from moses to
[1:49:11] joshua
[1:49:13] and when the minister moved from elijah
[1:49:15] to elijah
[1:49:17] it's it's always a problem
[1:49:20] when the minister moved from john to
[1:49:22] jesus
[1:49:25] john says he sees jesus coming he says
[1:49:28] behold
[1:49:30] the lamb of god that takes away the sin
[1:49:32] of the world
[1:49:33] only two disciples
[1:49:35] follow jesus
[1:49:38] only
[1:49:41] followed jesus
[1:49:43] the rest
[1:49:46] revolved around john
[1:49:48] they did not see
[1:49:50] a scriptural and spiritual transition
[1:49:56] now
[1:49:58] brother is not going to return back to
[1:50:01] preach
[1:50:04] i'll repeat
[1:50:05] brother branham says he is not coming
[1:50:08] back to pray he will come
[1:50:10] in the resurrection with the rest of the
[1:50:12] saints
[1:50:14] you the fightful ministry must preach
[1:50:18] but i want to show you something here
[1:50:24] when john was in prison
[1:50:31] he sent some of his disciples
[1:50:36] i don't know whether he was tired
[1:50:38] they don't see it
[1:50:40] he said go
[1:50:42] and ask him
[1:50:44] is he the one
[1:50:49] then they came to jesus
[1:50:51] and say john is asking this question
[1:50:53] about you
[1:50:55] jesus doesn't give him the quotation
[1:50:58] doesn't give the scripture he points him
[1:51:00] at the manifestations
[1:51:03] of the ministry
[1:51:07] the damn speak
[1:51:09] the lane here
[1:51:11] the crap will walk
[1:51:13] tell him this
[1:51:14] because he knew that christ is
[1:51:16] identified
[1:51:18] by his characteristics
[1:51:24] and today
[1:51:26] a question could be asked again
[1:51:29] is he
[1:51:31] the one
[1:51:33] and i'm amen to give you an answer
[1:51:36] go and tell him
[1:51:40] the message has reached the jungles of
[1:51:44] africa
[1:51:46] go ahead and tell him
[1:51:49] people are coming and receiving the
[1:51:52] revelation of the hour in trinidad
[1:51:57] telling him
[1:51:59] community did not change their
[1:52:01] standpoint
[1:52:04] they still believe in the message of the
[1:52:07] hour
[1:52:10] telling him
[1:52:12] our young people
[1:52:14] have separated from the world
[1:52:17] they don't have boyfriends they don't
[1:52:18] have girlfriends they are far away from
[1:52:21] it
[1:52:23] [Applause]
[1:52:27] tell him
[1:52:29] about what you see
[1:52:33] you know why
[1:52:36] if john
[1:52:39] pointed at jesus
[1:52:41] and said behold the lamb of god and
[1:52:44] brother branham in our time
[1:52:46] did not point at another body
[1:52:49] but jesus christ
[1:52:51] was built in brother brother
[1:52:53] a brother branham moves off the scene
[1:52:57] christ today
[1:52:59] where is he
[1:53:04] brother say he always fails himself
[1:53:09] he always hides himself behind

[1:53:21] god revealed he says

[1:53:53] is not the deity
[1:53:55] but the deity
[1:53:57] is in the body
[1:53:59] here is the deity
[1:54:01] of jesus christ
[1:54:04] we are not worshiping christ in a
[1:54:06] measure we are worshipping christ in you
[1:54:09] the hope of glory
[1:54:11] god bless you
