[11:59] know what to
[12:03] do, I will
[12:05] cast all my
[12:07] cares upon
[12:11] you. Thank you, God. Praise the Lord.
[12:15] Amen. That is a really beautiful Quran.
[12:18] pass my cares upon you. Anytime I don't
[12:22] know what to do, I cast my cares upon.
[12:24] Let's bow our heads and pray. Heavenly
[12:26] Father, we thank you for this tremendous
[12:28] opportunity that you have given up upon
[12:30] us to call upon your name and I pray
[12:33] your presence will settle over every
[12:35] heart, over every mind, over your life
[12:37] connected here tonight. May your
[12:39] presence be with them in a special way.
[12:41] We such a needy people as we see
[12:44] troubles times, Lord. As we see things
[12:46] that are so unsettling, nerve-wracking,
[12:49] shaken, but you're all us to have
[12:51] perfect peace in you and trust in you
[12:53] and confidence in you. And may that be
[12:56] shown here tonight by your word and by
[12:58] your spirit. Granted, God in Jesus name
[13:00] I ask it. Bless them as we exhort them a
[13:03] few words and they get on in prayer. In
[13:05] Jesus mighty I ask it. Amen and amen.
[13:08] Good to have all of you here tonight.
[13:10] And as always, it's a blessing. We
[13:12] counting down about what 5 years doing
[13:15] this. And it's quite an experience.
[13:18] Quite an experience of this journey of
[13:22] life. And I was thinking about
[13:25] how
[13:27] technology going to be positioned in a
[13:30] way to enforce the B system that is
[13:33] going to come over the whole world, you
[13:36] know. And I was thinking about how the
[13:40] tree that man partake of was the tree of
[13:42] the knowledge of good and evil. When you
[13:45] ex examine it closely, everything man
[13:48] build that appears to be good have a
[13:51] evil side to it. Whether is airplane,
[13:55] whether whatever it is, it has a side
[13:57] that is negative. Why? Because man did
[14:00] it in his element in his uh genetic code
[14:05] of to be a son of God. He has this
[14:08] ability to to make
[14:11] subroducts like create if I could use
[14:14] that word there or make things that was
[14:16] never here before. And as man get more
[14:20] adept and how they reach to the point of
[14:22] this artificial intelligence it speed up
[14:26] things so much more. They say they say
[14:28] now people don't have to learn to learn
[14:30] to code because the AI could do the
[14:34] coding. So man is accelerating on a pace
[14:38] that is
[14:39] incredible. And the question we have to
[14:42] ask ourselves is what about the church?
[14:45] What pace are we moving at? What is the
[14:49] rhythm? What is the beat? Why is there
[14:52] such a lack of faith? And the question
[14:55] Jesus himself asks that question when
[14:58] the son of man cometh shall he find
[15:00] faith in the earth what will happen to
[15:02] this fate and it's kind of odd
[15:06] because Malachi 4 William Brham will
[15:10] send eternal hearts back to the face of
[15:11] the fathers and yet Jesus is saying when
[15:15] the son of man cometh shall he find
[15:18] faith in the earth man has become very
[15:21] confident in himself in his ability in
[15:26] technology in particular in science man
[15:29] is very confident they have seen you
[15:33] know in a couple of years back I don't
[15:36] know why I'm talking tonight I have
[15:37] something to share with you and I'm just
[15:38] talking right now but a couple of years
[15:40] back lifespan was about 50 something 60
[15:43] something even before that was lower
[15:45] than that but man with all the crazy
[15:49] food you know you talk about um bad food
[15:52] and and and
[15:55] this food and that food, but actually
[15:58] people are living longer than before.
[16:00] It's not like they're freaking out at 43
[16:01] or 50 or whatever it is. People are
[16:03] living long lives and they are living
[16:06] long enough to see the transition that
[16:09] man has come to in terms of science and
[16:12] achievement. Now God Ran taught us that
[16:16] horse and buggy with car, airplane,
[16:20] astronaut that it was reflective of the
[16:24] ages that was being unfolded. Luther,
[16:27] Wesley, um the Pentecostal, then Malachi
[16:30] 4. So we will have to appreciate the
[16:33] fact that if science is moving in that
[16:37] pace that gear that transformational
[16:40] gear that means somewhere along the line
[16:44] the church have to tap into this
[16:46] transformational gear. No but did say
[16:49] what we see manifested temporarily will
[16:51] be manifest in his fullness when the
[16:53] press come down. We know a press is
[16:55] coming and for that press to come
[16:57] certain things has to happen. Jesus when
[17:00] he came, we know the story. He shook up
[17:02] the religious world at that time with
[17:04] signs, wonders, miracles, with
[17:06] deliverances and everything else. His
[17:08] whole operation exposed the fraudulent
[17:12] tradition of man's spirit that was upon
[17:14] the scribing
[17:15] Pharisees. They in turn had to reject
[17:19] the manifestation of the fulfillment of
[17:21] the word. And in rejecting it, that is
[17:26] where the government made their play.
[17:28] That is where the press came down. That
[17:31] is where he was turned over to be
[17:34] crucified. And I believe it's a similar
[17:37] thing today. You have a message. We have
[17:39] a word. But the bride must be and will
[17:43] be not the word word talked or the word
[17:47] explained or the word
[17:50] discussed, but the bride must be the
[17:53] word manifested.
[17:56] Now, so it changes the picture
[18:00] of what we are to become and how God
[18:04] wants
[18:05] us. Now, when Jesus was coming down to
[18:09] the final part of his ministry, which
[18:12] was at the garden of Gethsemane, he had
[18:15] a
[18:16] choice. The choice was
[18:19] his. He made a choice and he expressed
[18:23] it clearly. If it is possible, let this
[18:27] cup pass. Nobody desires debt. Nobody
[18:30] walk after debt. Nobody walks after the
[18:32] cross. Nobody. It's a leading. It's a
[18:36] burden. It's a price. Even this thing
[18:39] called the debt of a corner wheat. We
[18:41] could live selfish lives that we live
[18:43] onto ourselves. And we can live a life
[18:46] that really is for others. This is what
[18:50] the lily is all about. pressing above
[18:52] the mock and the mer and the old oil and
[18:54] whatever come down that stream and let
[18:57] me press out to give a flower and give a
[19:00] perfume not for itself but for the bees
[19:03] or those that will come around and after
[19:06] all God crush us in whatever way process
[19:08] in whatever way we ought and should have
[19:12] some kind of perfume that comes out of
[19:15] our lives that it would serve to help
[19:17] others. Remember as I close in on this
[19:20] part here that one day that last name
[19:24] will come in that last name on the book
[19:27] and that book will be closed.
[19:31] Remember time was given to fulfilled
[19:33] purpose. Remember time itself have a cap
[19:37] is not just
[19:38] unending. It's time as a beginning time
[19:43] and the end ending. And for each one of
[19:45] our lives, we have a beginning and let's
[19:47] say an ending or the rapture. But within
[19:50] that space, we have something to do.
[19:54] Father, not my will, but your will be
[19:56] done. That done part is what each one of
[20:00] us have to come to as an individual. So
[20:03] tonight, I want to read a scripture and
[20:06] this is from Luke 18, familiar
[20:07] scripture. And he and this is from verse
[20:10] one of Luke 18. If you have Bibles, want
[20:11] to look at it. Jesus speaks and he speak
[20:14] a parable unto them unto this end that
[20:16] men ought always to pray and not to
[20:18] faint. And that's my title this this
[20:20] evening. Men ought always to pray and
[20:25] not to faint. To faint is to give up. To
[20:28] faint is to lose heart. To faint is to
[20:30] let go. To faint is to be discouraged
[20:33] and
[20:34] wear. And he spake upon them to descend
[20:37] the men to pray always to pray and not
[20:39] faint. saying, "There was in a city a
[20:41] judge, which feared not God, neither a
[20:43] regarded man." And there was a widow in
[20:45] that city. She came unto him, saying,
[20:48] "Avenge me of mine adversary, and he
[20:51] would not for a while." But afterwards
[20:53] he said within himself, "Though I fear
[20:55] not God nor regard man, yet because this
[20:58] widow troubleth me, I will avenge her,
[21:01] least by her continual coming, she wear
[21:04] me." And the Lord said, this is the Lord
[21:07] said, "Hear what the unjust judge saith.
[21:12] Shall not God avenge his own elect which
[21:15] cry day and night unto him, though he be
[21:17] alone with him? I tell you, he will
[21:20] avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when
[21:22] the Son of man cometh, shall he find
[21:24] faith on the earth." May God bless his
[21:27] word." So, there we have it. It's
[21:29] interesting how Jesus didn't give this
[21:31] woman as a married woman. He give this
[21:34] woman as a
[21:36] widow. A woman without a
[21:38] husband. A widow widow. A a woman
[21:41] without this male
[21:43] support. A wid a widow woman. A woman
[21:46] standing alone. Standing with her
[21:49] trials, a
[21:53] [Music]
[21:56] destined. And she wants
[21:59] justice. She wants a breakthrough. She
[22:02] wants a deliverance. both of our
[22:04] children or family. She wants that. And
[22:07] she goes to this judge and this judge he
[22:10] fear God no man. He don't care who you
[22:12] are, where you come from, what tie, no
[22:14] tie, what poor, widow, doesn't matter.
[22:18] He fearless. But this woman have an
[22:21] agenda to get her needs met. And
[22:24] sometimes to get to that spot, you have
[22:28] to get really stirred up in your spirit.
[22:31] Because every time we going towards
[22:33] something, there's always something to
[22:34] discourage you. There is always
[22:36] something to keep you back. Whether it's
[22:38] ambition, whether it's vision, whether
[22:41] is planning, whether it's discipline, it
[22:44] doesn't matter what it is. The devil
[22:46] want to thwart the plans that you may
[22:49] have in your heart because you have to
[22:50] have things in your heart. If you have,
[22:53] you know, like what could God guide if
[22:57] you don't have a plan? If you have a
[22:59] plan, God could say not so, not so this
[23:01] week. God put it in the heart of man to
[23:04] take leadership role. God put it in the
[23:06] heart of man to overcome, to stand, man
[23:08] conquer mountains, man conquer valleys,
[23:10] man conquer the sky, man conquer all
[23:13] kind of things. Man conquer because it
[23:14] is in the heart of man to be a
[23:16] conqueror. This what we supposed to be.
[23:18] But it said our Christians under a
[23:22] religious canopy wants to stay in that
[23:25] religious mode. And I was thinking
[23:27] something better talk about man and I
[23:31] spoke about it I think last time spirit
[23:33] man then flesh man and how God couldn't
[23:35] tell Adam in Genesis 1 of all the fruit
[23:39] you may eat Adam had no mouth to eat
[23:41] nothing. So he couldn't address eating
[23:44] in Genesis 1. He couldn't address
[23:46] certain things in Genesis 1 at all. And
[23:49] I realize now even in the our father
[23:51] prayer Isaac went down and did it. Our
[23:54] father who art in heaven start at the
[23:55] spirit level out of the zone of
[23:59] earth. Later on it have give us this day
[24:02] our daily bread. This is the physical
[24:04] man. Now in the physical realm this
[24:07] natural man offense will happen. So
[24:10] forgive us our sins. Temptations will
[24:13] happen. Keep us from temptation. So then
[24:16] you see the channel of God. First the
[24:19] kingdom and then for thine be the honor
[24:22] and glory forever and ever. Amen. It
[24:24] starts with the kingdom. It end with the
[24:25] kingdom. It start with God. It end with
[24:27] God. It's a perfect prayer. It's an
[24:29] ideal prayer. It's what Jesus have
[24:31] prayed. And it tells us we are not just
[24:35] earthly people. We are not just natural
[24:39] people. So this woman instead of getting
[24:42] threw off, turn off, discouraged, faint,
[24:45] give up. Oh god, the man wicked. He see
[24:48] no husband. He's a wicked man. You know
[24:50] how people talk already. Instead of
[24:52] going in that mode to look for sympathy
[24:55] instead of getting that mode to look for
[24:57] who will help me and nobody to help me
[25:00] and the see
[25:01] husband is the pension and and and
[25:04] wherever he remain and wherever he
[25:06] didn't leave and whatever it is she
[25:08] didn't go in that mode she went in the
[25:10] mode of this need to solve I wanted
[25:13] result is not that she don't know the
[25:16] judge is a hard man but she ignored that
[25:19] and sometimes to get where you need to
[25:22] go to get what you need to ask to get
[25:25] what you need to persist after. You have
[25:27] to go beyond what appears to be
[25:29] negative, what appears to be mountains,
[25:32] what appears to be doors closed to you
[25:37] because God is a way
[25:39] maker. God is a protector. God is a
[25:43] strength giver. And if tonight you're
[25:46] faintish, you're
[25:48] fainting, Isaiah 40:31 says, "But
[25:51] they that wait upon the Lord shall not
[25:55] maybe renew their strength. They shall
[25:58] mount up with wings as eagles. They
[26:01] shall run and not be weary. They shall
[26:03] walk and not faint." This is positive.
[26:07] This have no ambiguity ambiguity in in
[26:10] it. And they that wait will renew their
[26:13] strength, mount up, run, walk, and not
[26:19] faint. So prayer is a powerful thing.
[26:23] Waiting upon the Lord is a powerful
[26:25] thing.
[26:27] Psalms 138:3, "In the day when I cry,
[26:31] thou answerest me and strengthenest me
[26:35] with strength in my soul." How many want
[26:38] strength here tonight? Because God gives
[26:42] strength. If we listen to the
[26:44] politicians, if we listen to what
[26:45] happening in the world, right? That man
[26:47] rocking in the north and having the
[26:50] world upside down, twisted and twy and
[26:53] everything else and people worried and
[26:55] concerned and whatnot. that God could
[26:56] give strength to you here tonight who
[27:00] might be faintish, fainting, struggling
[27:03] to hold on and weary and you feel God is
[27:06] not answering your prayer because yeah
[27:09] is you are one of those who like instant
[27:13] gratification and you don't have the
[27:15] discipline to wait and if you don't have
[27:18] the discipline to wait you'll be taken.
[27:22] you get in trouble because this is where
[27:25] you want this and you want it now. You
[27:27] want this, you want to have it now and
[27:29] your fellow should work out now. And God
[27:30] said no, you have to wait. And in
[27:34] waiting is where the testing come. In
[27:37] waiting is where the strengthening come.
[27:41] If God give you all that you
[27:45] desire as you want it, you will have
[27:49] zero discipline. You would be moving
[27:52] into a spirit of entitlement and the day
[27:56] he doesn't give you like a child you
[27:58] would throw a tantrum and you would
[28:00] carry on and want to know what going on
[28:03] because and brother Brandham had a
[28:06] experience with speaking for scribes and
[28:09] he spoke and he finally was waiting long
[28:11] he said thank you Lord for two he said
[28:13] but God said but you spoke for three and
[28:15] God made him wait until that third one
[28:19] appeared Because this is part of God's
[28:23] character. My word shall not return unto
[28:26] me void but it shall accomplish. So
[28:30] God's character have to do with thought,
[28:34] words, expression and waiting for a
[28:38] manifestation. The upper room people had
[28:41] 11 days or so to wait. Wait for the
[28:45] promise for the power from on hand.
[28:48] Somebody could have created hey you know
[28:50] we had power already you know I cast out
[28:53] devils and whatn not and but he was
[28:54] talking about that power if Jesus was
[28:57] talking about that power that they had
[28:59] while they were working with him he
[29:00] could have said so but this was
[29:02] different this was permanent power not
[29:06] the temp temporary power he was putting
[29:08] them in position to be effectively used
[29:12] because it means their character would
[29:14] have been
[29:15] affected all that power and anointing
[29:18] upon on them. There was no effect upon
[29:21] their character because one want to know
[29:23] who is greater. One mother come and say
[29:25] put one of my son right hand and left
[29:27] hand. They had the jealousies and the
[29:28] envy that the issues and that's what the
[29:31] upper room was about to get that sorted
[29:32] out to get the vomit out to get the
[29:35] foolishness out to get who greater than
[29:37] who who had and who who are more
[29:38] ministry than who who and all that
[29:40] nonsense blown out. Because when that
[29:43] fire come that fire has come to burn
[29:45] that fire to come to discuss nothing.
[29:46] That fire just
[29:49] burn and that same fire to come back to
[29:52] burn again. How many want that fire
[29:54] tonight? So if you are fainting, if you
[29:59] are fearful, there's a word for you.
[30:03] There's a blessing for you. And that is
[30:05] why men want to pray and not to faint,
[30:08] not to give up. Listen to this.
[30:14] Samson Judges 16. And Samson called unto
[30:18] the Lord and said, "Oh Lord God,
[30:19] remember me, I praise thee. Strengthen
[30:21] me, I praise thee this once, oh God,
[30:23] that I may be at once avenge of the
[30:25] Philistines of my two eyes." Samson, he
[30:29] asked God to avenge him. A man
[30:33] who went into wickedness with delight.
[30:36] But you know what? He was born a son. He
[30:40] was always a son.
[30:41] He fell but that doesn't mean he is a
[30:45] failure. Did you get
[30:47] that Samson fell that does not make him
[30:51] a failure it means he fell and this
[30:54] prayer he prayed strengthen me and
[30:58] avenge me he come into a full
[31:00] recognition that even though he failed
[31:03] he could bounce
[31:04] back. Do you have the courage to bounce
[31:07] back? I see people battered and beaten.
[31:10] I'm thinking on having a seminar
[31:12] concerning broken men, a men's seminar.
[31:14] Pray for me because that inspiration
[31:16] came and I failed to have seminar on
[31:19] broken men. How we do we fix that? Men
[31:22] that are broken, broken by finances, by
[31:25] marriage, by women, by money, by
[31:27] whatever broken men. How do we fix that?
[31:30] Samson would have been a broken man. His
[31:32] eyes was out. He grinding at the mill.
[31:35] He's ordinary. He recognized the
[31:37] anointing is no longer with him. And yet
[31:40] the first opportunity he saw that there
[31:43] was a possibility because that is what
[31:45] it's about. In other words, if tonight
[31:49] there is a possibility with a simple
[31:52] prayer your whole destiny could change,
[31:55] won't you want to pray that
[31:57] prayer? If tonight there is a
[32:00] possibility of a transformational
[32:02] opportunity for you, your family, your
[32:06] life by what you ask God
[32:09] tonight, then everything is over right
[32:11] now tonight for you. A change of course,
[32:15] a change of path, a change in your
[32:18] being. And I want to note that Peter and
[32:23] Andrew and all the guys who was in the
[32:25] upper room, they were changed men when
[32:28] they came out from
[32:29] there. They were anointed before. They
[32:32] participate in ministry before. But
[32:34] Jesus told them, "Sit down. Shut up. Sit
[32:36] down. Keep quiet. Don't preach. Don't go
[32:38] out there. Sit down until they get power
[32:41] from on high. Hush them out. Keep
[32:44] quiet." Does it sound too rough? I hope
[32:47] I don't find it too rough here. But I
[32:49] want to get your message across. How
[32:51] serious it was this promise of the
[32:53] father. It wasn't Jesus saying that to
[32:55] him. He said the promise of the father.
[32:57] Before that he taught them if I don't go
[33:00] the comforter will not come. So he knew
[33:02] the comforter was coming. He knew I am
[33:05] with you but I shall be in you. He can't
[33:08] be in them physically. He's prophesying.
[33:10] He's talking about spirit. He even said
[33:12] it in words in John 3 7:37. He that
[33:15] believeth on me as the scripture said
[33:17] out his belly fat. rivers of living
[33:19] water. This spake he of the spirit that
[33:22] was not yet given because Jesus Christ
[33:25] was not yet glorified. So the spirit was
[33:28] not yet
[33:29] released to effectively change these
[33:32] men. He was with them and they got an
[33:35] anointing to work with him. But the
[33:38] spirit had to be released. So when he
[33:41] breathed on them and said, "Receive the
[33:43] Holy Ghost," he was prophesying the
[33:46] breath of God upon them that the spirit
[33:48] would surely come. Now I know you feel
[33:50] something here tonight. I know you know
[33:52] you are sons and daughters of God under
[33:54] a promise. Regardless of what you're
[33:56] going through right now, it doesn't
[33:57] change what God promised you. Let me
[33:59] repeat that. Regardless of where you are
[34:02] at, regardless of what you're going
[34:04] through, it doesn't change what God
[34:06] promised you. And yes, maybe you could
[34:09] be in that position tonight like that
[34:10] with a
[34:12] woman. Maybe you have no support. Maybe
[34:16] you have nobody to lean on and you want
[34:18] a breakthrough. You want and you know
[34:21] that you cannot just sit there and just,
[34:24] you know, well, I pray before I'm not
[34:25] going to pray that again. No, she keep
[34:27] pressing. She keep pressing. She could.
[34:29] It was a persistence. Persistent prayer.
[34:33] Persistent knock. Persistent asking. She
[34:36] was at it and that judge come to the
[34:38] conclusion if I don't if I don't answer
[34:41] this woman if I don't deal with this
[34:42] thing that go frustrate me he start to
[34:45] get a backlash from a persistence and
[34:47] this is what I want you to hit tonight a
[34:49] p a from persistent persistence in
[34:52] prayer persistence in faith persistence
[34:54] in attitude persistence in going after
[34:56] your goals persistent go that devils
[35:00] want to send everything to neg to bring
[35:02] a negative atmosphere and to bring
[35:04] something that will shoot you back.
[35:06] That's the devil job to push you back.
[35:09] And as you as they push you back with
[35:11] the boo as Gideon said on Wednesday
[35:12] night, you just have to bow him back.
[35:14] Amen. So I want to encourage you
[35:17] tonight. Oh father Thson, pray that
[35:20] prayer. David, Psalms 138. In the day
[35:24] when I cry, thou answers me and
[35:26] strengthens me with strength in my soul.
[35:30] We need strength. You know, some people
[35:34] might say, "God, but I need some
[35:36] money." Yeah, but David wasn't talking
[35:39] about money. Money could purchase things
[35:41] for the physical. But do you have
[35:43] strength in your soul? Because strength
[35:47] in your soul is independent of anything
[35:50] physical, whether money, whether
[35:52] husband, whether wife, whether children,
[35:55] family, or support. This woman didn't
[35:58] have a husband. She was a widow. But she
[36:01] had something in her strong enough to
[36:05] keep going, to keep pressing. You know
[36:09] who was similar? The woman who had the
[36:11] daughter of vex with the devil and she
[36:13] came and she woripped and and and
[36:15] disciples got so harassed. They felt so
[36:18] troubled with the woman. They tell
[36:19] Jesus, "Talk to this woman. Please
[36:20] handle her because she only terrorizing
[36:23] us." And Jesus stood there and say,
[36:26] "Uh-uh. Uh-uh. It's not fit to take the
[36:29] children's bread and give it to dogs.
[36:30] And the woman stood there. She moving.
[36:33] That is woman. Oh glory. Hallelujah.
[36:36] That is
[36:37] saint. How much saints we have in the
[36:39] building tonight. How much things we
[36:40] have in this virtual room tonight. That
[36:41] that is faith. That what that is. You
[36:44] know that is faith. She stood there and
[36:47] when she went through all the motions
[36:48] and went through all the emotions and
[36:50] motion she said even the d crumbs. What
[36:52] are you talking about? I am moving that.
[36:56] Yeah. go to Facebook, Instagram and
[36:57] complain and make comments and and and
[37:00] all kind of stuff and get much likes and
[37:02] people supporting me. Yes, boy. You see
[37:04] how she talk and the preacher talk. She
[37:06] wasn't going there. She stood around and
[37:08] said even the dogs take and Jesus said
[37:11] woman forget it about it. Your daughter
[37:13] is that devil
[37:14] gone for this saying for this what say
[37:19] it saying your daughter is made whole.
[37:23] What does that tells us? That tells us
[37:26] that we could say the right thing, we
[37:29] could say correct things, we could
[37:31] speak, we could pray, we could ask, we
[37:35] could believe and it could materialize
[37:38] itself. Oh, do you believe that tonight?
[37:41] Oh, praise the name of the Lord.
[37:43] Strength in your
[37:44] soul. Psalms 18:1-2, I will love thee,
[37:48] oh Lord, my strength.
[37:50] The Lord is my rock, my
[37:53] fortress, my
[37:55] deliverer, my God, my strength in whom I
[38:01] will trust, my buckler and the horn of
[38:05] my salvation and my high tower. And I
[38:10] think I'll close with this here this
[38:11] this part. This is Jesus now Luke 22
[38:15] saying, "Father, if thou be willing,
[38:17] move this cup. Nevertheless, not my
[38:19] will, but thy will be done. I hear this
[38:21] part. And they appeared an angel unto
[38:25] him from
[38:26] heaven strengthening him. This is Jesus
[38:30] the son of
[38:31] God going through this great
[38:35] test
[38:36] garden. And the Bible said when he said
[38:40] not my will, thy will be done, an angel
[38:43] came to strike them. That means we could
[38:47] get angelic
[38:49] support. That means because our attitude
[38:53] towards his will and will be done, we
[38:56] could get in our distress, in our
[39:00] weariness and and the battles and
[39:02] temptations, we could get angelic
[39:05] support like Jesus. And he got an angel
[39:09] to strengthen me. Let me see if I can
[39:11] wrap up here. Time is clicking over
[39:13] here.
[39:19] I have here the righteous cry. The Lord
[39:21] heareth and deliverth them of all their
[39:24] trouble.
[39:26] Jonah Junah prayed unto the Lord his God
[39:29] out of the fish belly and the Lord spake
[39:31] unto the fish and it vomited on Jonah
[39:34] and dry land. Note the Lord didn't speak
[39:36] to Jonah.
[39:39] What Junah wanted was
[39:41] out of that submarine. He wanted to put
[39:45] his foot on land because it's not easy
[39:48] to be inside that submarine of a fish.
[39:50] So God speak to Jonah. God spoke to the
[39:52] fish and said, "Get him out." And Jonah
[39:54] step out. He go and step. Let me just
[39:56] close with a few quotes from Barra that
[39:59] I think that would be so fine. And oho,
[40:02] let me give you this one about wisdom.
[40:05] If you lack wisdom, let him ask of God
[40:07] that give it to all men liberally and
[40:09] uprath not, and it shall be given him.
[40:11] And in wisdom, Solomon says, "Give
[40:15] therefore thy servant an understanding
[40:17] heart to judge thy people that I may
[40:21] discern between good and bad." Look
[40:23] specifically praying. "For who is able
[40:26] to judge this thy so great a people?"
[40:29] And verse 9 says, "Behold, I have done
[40:30] according to thy words. Hello, I have
[40:32] given thee a wise and understanding
[40:35] heart that there was none like thee
[40:37] before thee, neither after thee shall
[40:40] any arise like unto thee. This is what
[40:42] God told someone
[40:44] about. You see what prayer does? Prayer
[40:47] is not exactly bringing God down to man.
[40:51] It is bringing man up to God. You see,
[40:54] as you pray, you lose sight of these
[40:57] earthly things. You sway out into
[41:00] somewhere else way beyond and on and on
[41:02] and on and on till you become into his
[41:05] presence and then a fate that you have
[41:08] laid it out before God and said now heal
[41:11] God here it is. I want to get well for
[41:14] this cause or I want you to do this for
[41:17] me or this cause I want you to heal me
[41:20] from this cancer or this TB or this
[41:22] anemma condition or whatever it is. I
[41:25] will walk before you. I will do
[41:27] everything I can. I will give this
[41:29] testimony everywhere I go. I will be
[41:32] happy to do that, Lord. I will use my
[41:35] life not for myself. I will use it for
[41:38] your glory to help others to see you.
[41:41] From another message, knowing knoweth
[41:44] all things, he says, "Angel is a
[41:48] servant. We are sons and daughters.
[41:50] Which is the most thought of, your
[41:52] servant or your son or daughter?" Oh my.
[41:55] Prayer. Yeah, there we go. Listen. From
[41:58] a saint will go a million times higher
[42:01] than an angel. Yes, sir. Because he's a
[42:04] son. He said, "How can God move on a man
[42:08] when his wife pray for him and vice
[42:10] versa? He may be a big church in the
[42:12] city, but God knows how to make him a
[42:14] little shop. Prayer does it." Almost
[42:17] done. You see, when you go to praying
[42:19] for somebody, something goes to taking
[42:21] place. There is where we fail. Friends,
[42:24] not praying. Prayer is the key note.
[42:26] Ask, you shall receive. You have not
[42:29] because you ask not. You ask not because
[42:30] you believe not. Ask abundance that your
[42:33] joy may be full. Ask and believe that
[42:35] you receive what you ask for. Then hold
[42:37] on to it. Don't leave it. It's a promise
[42:39] of God. It be revealed to you that God's
[42:41] going to give it to you. Hold on to it.
[42:44] God's
[42:46] plan is is is to make much of the man
[42:50] far more of him than anything else.
[42:53] Praise God. Men are God's method. The
[42:57] church is looking for better methods,
[42:59] but God is looking for better men. And
[43:02] when he when he found David and Saul
[43:06] acting the way he acting, he tells
[43:09] Samuel, don't bother with that man. I
[43:11] found a better man. I believe you are
[43:14] better men, better women here tonight
[43:17] that God have found. God knew from
[43:19] before you was even born what you will
[43:21] do and you'll be here tonight. Let's bow
[43:23] our heads. Heavenly Father, I thank you
[43:24] tonight for these few chopped up words.
[43:27] But Lord, I believe the message got whom
[43:29] men ought to pray and not to faint. See
[43:33] what prayer can do, what prayer have
[43:36] brought. God, how each one of those
[43:38] saints of old, those soldiers of the
[43:40] cross, they prayed and you answered
[43:42] their prayer. Sometime the enemy want to
[43:44] bring such doubts and questions and
[43:47] fears as if our prayer will not be
[43:49] answered. But tonight we are encouraged
[43:52] by this widow woman who stood her ground
[43:56] and she pressed forward in faith
[43:57] believing you. And I pray each mother
[44:00] here, each father, each husband, each
[44:02] wife, each single sister, single
[44:04] brother, each child, each individual,
[44:07] each teenager, whoever is here, Lord
[44:08] God, that they will hold their ground as
[44:12] brother Gideon brought out stand and
[44:14] withstand, not just be defensive, but to
[44:17] take up offense. And that is why we have
[44:19] a shield that protects, but we have a
[44:21] sword that attacks. Oh God, help us
[44:23] tonight as they get along in prayer that
[44:25] we will feel confident that the God of
[44:27] Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob is alive. And
[44:30] he's here to confirm his word with
[44:31] signs, wonders, and miracles. Granted,
[44:33] Lord, in Jesus name I ask it. Amen. And
[44:35] amen. I know I spent some time here
[44:36] tonight, but I pray and trust that this
[44:38] would help you in your Christian walk
[44:41] and in your faith in trusting God and
[44:43] believing him for all things as you get
[44:45] on in prayer. God bless you. Whizzle.

[1:30:57] Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord. Thank

[1:31:03] Lord.
[1:31:06] Hallelujah. Oh blessed be the name of
[1:31:08] the Lord. Blessed be the name of the
[1:31:10] Lord. Father we praise you tonight.
[1:31:12] Father, we thank you for your presence,
[1:31:13] Lord. We thank you for your spirit. We
[1:31:15] thank you for the anointing of God. Have
[1:31:17] your way, Lord Jesus. We look away to
[1:31:19] you tonight. We look away to your
[1:31:21] presence tonight. We look into your
[1:31:22] great ability tonight. You promise to
[1:31:24] strengthen, to heal, to guide, to lead,
[1:31:27] to deliver, to restore, look out, to
[1:31:29] baptize, to fill, to adopt, to refill.
[1:31:32] You promise of miracles, signs and
[1:31:34] wonders. That's the glory of the Lord
[1:31:36] that it covers the church. The glory of
[1:31:38] the Lord. What is it? Is signs and
[1:31:40] wonders and miracles. You promise all
[1:31:41] these things. Give us great hearts,
[1:31:43] great expectation, Father. Great faith
[1:31:45] to believe you that you would come on
[1:31:47] the scene and ride the tree once more.
[1:31:48] We bless you tonight. We thank you for
[1:31:50] the uncction. Thank you for the
[1:31:51] inspiration. Thank for the anointing
[1:31:53] among your people, oh God. May they have
[1:31:55] a good rest tonight. May the quickening
[1:31:57] power be upon them, upon their minds,
[1:31:59] upon their lives. And may your peace
[1:32:01] that passes all understanding rest on
[1:32:02] them. Your assurance that you never lose
[1:32:05] a battle. You never lost a battle,
[1:32:06] Father. And you're the same yesterday,
[1:32:08] today, and forever. You are still a way
[1:32:10] maker, still a provider, still a
[1:32:11] protector, still one who pro provides
[1:32:14] guidance. As we ask Lord, you said we
[1:32:16] have not because we ask not. And we come
[1:32:18] asking, believing, trusting that you
[1:32:20] would fulfill your word and confirm it
[1:32:21] among us. God, you sent a prophet that
[1:32:24] released spoken word promises, Lord, for
[1:32:26] the bride. But here we are waiting upon
[1:32:28] you. And you said through that prophet,
[1:32:30] wait till that little group that God
[1:32:32] will give that Elijah. Wait till they go
[1:32:34] to call upon God. There'll be a national
[1:32:36] showdown. Father God, may you store our
[1:32:39] hearts in faith. Still our hearts to
[1:32:40] believe you and to expect great things.
[1:32:43] You call us to ask for big things, for
[1:32:45] great things, not just for little
[1:32:47] things. Just like Elisha said, "Oh God,
[1:32:49] I want a double portion. Father God,
[1:32:51] give us great expectations. Give us
[1:32:53] great faith to believe you for Lord what
[1:32:56] might appear to be impossible." Father
[1:32:58] God, may you strike and inspire the
[1:33:00] people's heart tonight. I commit them
[1:33:02] into your hands. I commit this service
[1:33:04] this coming Sunday into your hands that
[1:33:05] your spirit would move expressly. Your
[1:33:08] spirit would speak and you would confirm
[1:33:10] your word with signs and wonders and
[1:33:11] miracles. Father God, have your way in
[1:33:13] our midst. Touch the elders, touch the
[1:33:15] ministry, Lord Jesus, touch your
[1:33:17] believers, each one from the open to the
[1:33:19] backbench, Lord. May you touch them and
[1:33:21] quicken them and make them alive unto
[1:33:22] you. May they come in the spirit to
[1:33:24] worship and to praise your name. May
[1:33:25] they come under great expectation for
[1:33:28] for you to fulfill and honor your word.
[1:33:30] Grant to God in Jesus name I ask it.
[1:33:32] Amen. And amen. Amen. God bless you.
[1:33:34] Looking forward to see you all on
[1:33:36] Sunday. We do have a life and God miss
[1:33:40] service tomorrow at 5. God bless you and
[1:33:42] have a good night. Praise the Lord.
