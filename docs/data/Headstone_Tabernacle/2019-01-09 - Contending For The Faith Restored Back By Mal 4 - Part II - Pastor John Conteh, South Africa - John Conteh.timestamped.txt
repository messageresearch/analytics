[2:07] each other then thank you also for the
[2:10] Robledo old one as well
[2:12] the original faith that's a risk look
[2:15] back and you know Church it's so easy to
[2:22] rip the message and try to understand
[2:25] what God accomplished in for the brand
[2:29] it's so easy it's so easy to preach all
[2:35] your messages over the Brahma it's so
[2:37] easy but what is difficult is to take
[2:44] the promises that the prophet legend
[2:49] because God called you to finding kids
[2:52] with a Branham that's right and that was
[3:00] the third Pope because of this
[3:04] thoughtful misdoings
[3:06] that restore the faith did not end up be
[3:11] restored in the people there but the
[3:14] brother gave in vain somebody has to
[3:20] contend forward with a random hat and
[3:24] nothing less
[3:30] and it's a positioning somebody shoot
[3:36] tickets and Bridget and spend the late
[3:39] [Applause]
[3:44] so I am NOT going to take anything less
[3:49] than what the Prophet had the original
[3:55] son of name Jesus Christ a fake a

[4:00] told his disciples if you believe in me
[4:04] the works that I do shall you do also

[4:16] purpose of his coming to the produce
[4:18] emselves in people praise God that is
[4:21] leadership ally lawyer not to make you
[4:23] anything but to make you call it well
[4:28] with God the devil don't like these

[5:17] also a lot it's all one baptism and the
[5:20] Trinity doctrine or Cadiz years has been
[5:23] rather separate out make it three course
[5:29] making twice inferior to the father but
[5:33] it was one faith God the Father God the
[5:37] Son God the Holy Ghost and a patch of
[5:40] that faith that faith is not completely
[5:43] though you somebody should say image of
[5:49] this so we are going back to the unity
[5:58] of the faith because of faith us to be
[6:01] united to become one that was like a
[6:06] revelation but the Branham for the phone
[6:09] for other people's fault
[6:11] so proven that you can break apart into
[6:15] three it has to be the same God all the

[10:33] wrestle two nights or till I leave this
[10:36] convention change hallelujah glory the
[10:40] cordovan sews country of its quickly
[10:42] let's with the scriptures

[10:51] come behind my brothers is a sin to try
[10:54] to see the message I'm just going on
[10:56] they have some things you already have
[10:58] the title symbol is contending for the
[11:01] faith to be able to contend for that
[11:07] faith the most compact my subject you'll
[11:09] reach enough it was fought back as
[11:11] Christ in you the hope of glory and that
[11:14] is being done by a free food revelation
[11:17] of Jesus Christ
[11:20] so until the believed accomplished what
[11:23] the full foundation of this original
[11:26] faith because this faith is never
[11:30] complete without you part of this way so
[11:37] let's turn to the usual scriptures the
[11:39] book of Jude or join for that photo to
[11:42] give us picture to you Jude 1:3 I think
[11:52] body to theory that this morning also
[11:54] beloved when I gave all the legions to
[11:56] write it to you of the common salvation
[11:57] it was needful for me to write it to you
[12:01] and exhort you that ye should earnestly
[12:02] contend for the faith which was once
[12:05] delivered unto the Saints out
[12:17] if you wait to believe God hallelujah
[12:25] amen
[12:26] let me just done quickly to a revelation
[12:28] of the wine what your things you've had
[12:33] that spit from the angle the revelation
[12:36] of Jesus Christ
[12:37] since revelation 1:1 just objectivity
[12:40] kindness
[12:41] revelation of Jesus Christ with God
[12:43] given to him and then the village of
[12:46] Jesus Christ is the original faith
[12:48] actually but the revelation of Jesus
[12:54] Christ which God gave unto him so this
[12:57] faith was given to Jesus Christ himself
[13:00] which God gave unto him to shew unto his
[13:03] servants things which must shortly come
[13:05] to pass and is sent and signified it by
[13:08] his angel are going to be servant John
[13:10] hope you have record of the word of God
[13:12] and of the testimony is quite a sum of
[13:14] all the things that he saw and God is
[13:17] showing you here our Bishop comes down
[13:20] chattels but is moved on to John and
[13:23] John chapter bright forth from Elohim
[13:25] down to the gods that the eight has
[13:27] simplified it then it came down to John
[13:29] sublime
[13:31] praise God would be a record of the word
[13:33] of God and of the testimony of Jesus
[13:35] Christ and of all the things that you
[13:36] saw
[13:37] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[13:40] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[13:42] those things which are waiting they are
[13:44] waiting for the time is God blesses what
[13:48] tonight you may be seen it about
[13:52] opposite all the specials
[13:54] South Africa is really talented honestly
[13:57] speaking I mean I told father for the
[14:00] Robledo that this this this these young
[14:03] people I mean they are loaded with
[14:06] talent your voice is so blind is that
[14:10] mention
[14:12] you can really see let's clap for the
[14:14] choristers and for those ones that get
[14:17] the kitchen I am so pleased and thank
[14:20] you brother of the South African songs
[14:21] it's always good to be so optical maybe
[14:24] it's a nice place to be
[14:27] hallelujah no we will call them and have
[14:31] a look first tonight are ready to fight
[14:33] for the faith that's a good enough why
[14:39] did you come to these meetings how can
[14:41] you go back the way you came
[14:43] how many of us are ready to contend for
[14:46] the faith tonight
[14:48] this can't be a theory we have got to
[14:52] apply the conviction the touch of blade
[14:55] of light because of ten of us go back by
[15:02] Malachi 4 but we have a responsibility
[15:07] to contain for what he had to be seated
[15:12] praise God hallelujah because both the
[15:15] messenger had a message we are all signs
[15:18] of restoration so you can't understand
[15:23] the faith or till you see the way it
[15:26] operates over the RAM but until shows it
[15:30] is morning a dispensation and age of
[15:33] adoption supernatural service called the
[15:38] Holy Spirit's the angel operated in the
[15:42] mail
[15:44] so for the run of big chocolate spirit
[15:47] just after Pentecost he was laying the
[15:50] foundation there was a fourth light
[15:52] manifestation upon with the touch of his
[15:55] nature his billet the fourth line
[16:02] manifestation the fault line world just
[16:06] after Pentecost from 2006 to 94 the
[16:13] Sikhs the Pentecostal it was George
[16:16] finish then talk to the Prophet is when
[16:21] you age which is your age the age of the
[16:25] manifestation of true sons of God with a
[16:29] syllable India soul but also there was
[16:36] the last foundation for the building
[16:40] because God could not build the monument
[16:43] the masterpiece he could not build this
[16:46] mansion of a perfect man on a bunch of
[16:50] nonsense
[16:51] they cannot build this project man on
[16:54] Rafael on Wesley on Pentecost is got to
[16:58] find a perfect foundation to play this
[17:01] match off of a perfect man so he brought
[17:05] the last manifestation the fourth light
[17:09] manifestation the fourth line word of
[17:14] the 19th for the six
[17:16] [Music]
[17:20] super the bottle said all this I'm only
[17:23] building and all this background here
[17:28] well but from that time has only been
[17:32] laying a foundation a big shots message
[17:35] no set the whole nation hallelujah
[17:41] so we have to bring back the fourth part
[17:45] of the foundation which is just
[17:48] perfection
[17:50] the capstone God and God was calling
[17:54] elect Pentecostals to mix up this
[17:57] foundation to make up this capstone so
[18:01] God has a foundation of perfection to
[18:04] feel opposites man for the resurrection
[18:06] raised or so to get the Prophet
[18:13] imperfection they can guess anything God
[18:18] have to give the Prophet not just a link
[18:21] but they give you the mercy of the Holy
[18:25] Ghost
[18:26] a man of God's presence that might
[18:31] become the guide the spigot of truth a
[18:34] that was to lead the prophets to all
[18:37] truth praise God amen because this is
[18:41] the last age this text are not allowed
[18:44] it has got to be perfection
[18:51] so this angel not a feeling not
[18:58] sensation he was a boss in that will
[19:02] speak to the prophets is no Pentecostal
[19:05] insane Pentecostal by the sensations of
[19:07] the Holy Ghost and those sensations not
[19:10] some magic of error so God took the
[19:17] profit not the Holy Ghost mess of
[19:19] sensation but of crossing a man an
[19:26] angelic being to guide the Prophet that
[19:30] became the kinda hallelujah praise God
[19:33] symbolically for was Aida he was he was
[19:37] the Holy Ghost is leading some big
[20:17] mistakes that sensational because but he
[20:24] will be on since we went to the post
[20:27] office
[20:28] louia praise God there was the mystery
[20:31] at the Holocaust not easy without
[20:34] sensation for the process of the
[20:36] Holocaust
[20:37] oh you believe that sir imagine us it's
[20:44] not straight is the message so for the
[20:48] brand of my mix of this angel have to
[20:51] restore the faith the first pull was
[20:59] backed by science of healing the live
[21:02] ones what you see the hidden mist you
[21:07] behind the possible forgiveness you see
[21:11] because science of God's forgiveness
[21:16] your I should cut bait we see without
[21:20] spilling with the consequence of C so
[21:27] this forgiveness they're talking about
[21:28] is not to sit forgive your brother is an
[21:32] order he coming here and applying the
[21:34] blouse hallelujah because it is his
[21:38] forgiveness
[21:39] it is His Highness that computer
[21:42] choppers will choose a lawyer that can
[21:44] take your dream away because these are
[21:46] all the consequences of seen clever
[21:52] Burnham said you can't deal would see
[21:55] with how stealing goodness is a
[22:04] completion fee
[22:06] [Applause]
[22:10] because the challenge to faith is si si
[22:19] unfaithful exist that is why once a
[22:24] believer gets born again they say
[22:30] because it was seen that cause before it
[22:34] even and you don't see see what you see
[22:39] is the attributes of same considered
[22:41] surface unbelief so when God handles
[22:47] welcome deeds which see big deals with
[22:50] the attributes and how do you know his
[22:53] death which C is when you see God deals
[22:57] with the attributes of C or let somebody
[23:03] shout hallelujah praise God even those
[23:07] of us softly which seen tonight God
[23:11] shall give you an experience the who
[23:14] delivered seen and with the attributes
[23:17] of ceará
[23:18] hallelujah the publication is the
[23:22] adultery will stop the filthiness will
[23:25] stop all this foolishness will start to
[23:28] become a Christian say job or shall turn
[23:31] a lawyer tonight and that is my vision
[23:33] tonight before
[23:43] [Applause]
[23:48] that's the truth you see Jesus God
[23:56] forgive me you're seen by a prize the
[24:03] Prophet explains that to you about the
[24:04] cross that was a defense that happened
[24:12] but how do you get yourself connected
[24:16] how do you become a beneficial of what
[24:20] Christ did it a price of redemption is
[24:28] paid but the price is not enough there
[24:33] has to be a walk of redemption to cook
[24:35] like a price a surprise is baited thing
[24:38] that is why Jesus Christ in John started
[24:41] heroes back and came back did he come
[24:44] back to that a second time he kept a
[24:46] little a lot of the attention
[24:49] praise God hallelujah is great to do a
[24:52] walk tonight from beautiful Trump extra
[24:56] beta from place to place a rock of the
[25:00] dead shop the price cannot do that alone
[25:05] in what has to be done it was it was of
[25:12] the resurrection that is why came back
[25:18] so for several Church ages it has been a
[25:22] walk God working in the church to bring
[25:28] you back and that's what can I just take
[25:32] many tell a second you need to have an
[25:36] experience with Jesus
[25:40] an experience with the Holocaust an
[25:46] experience with the blood of Jesus the
[25:50] blood is applied for you but the
[25:53] Holocaust has to come I said talking as
[25:57] a sign that's tonight that somebody will
[27:01] live this convention tonight with an
[27:04] experience with God by way of the
[27:08] baptism of the Holy Ghost to make you a
[27:12] living reality of this message
[27:15] hallelujah then your life is such a key
[27:19] to this message your life is a testimony
[27:23] and the testimony is not your testimony
[27:26] is a testimony of the Holy Ghost inside
[27:29] of you hallelujah Jesus evil will
[27:33] produce the results somebody shout
[27:41] hallelujah God is not that is alive is
[28:16] here tonight hallelujah he loves you so
[28:20] much
[28:29] [Applause]
[29:17] that's why it's called panel man a Bible
[29:26] says his enemy check his car
[29:28] it's never subject to the will of God so
[29:33] those who work in busy Mundus declare or
[29:35] walk by the dictate of the human spirit
[29:38] can never please God because the please
[29:43] God you please God by faith but faith is
[29:46] an element this is a time make sure
[29:48] you've got to come out of the humanistic
[29:50] way and convert to the wrath of divine
[29:53] revelation then in as rain you can
[29:56] police cars and it tested all the best
[29:59] baptism to raise you up from the hip on
[30:03] Instagram which are the RAM of divine
[30:05] revelation oh praise God hallelujah the
[30:10] Holocaust let's with you then you
[30:16] recognize that even though you have a
[30:17] demon spirit but you also have another
[30:21] stated with you that's the Holy
[30:23] Spirit then God can always speak to you
[30:26] not to the human spirit but for the Holy
[30:30] Spirit or can somebody shout hallelujah
[30:33] somebody shout hallelujah without the
[30:43] Holy Spirit it's difficult from God
[30:50] [Applause]
[30:55] and because he must be with the hearing
[30:59] whether human speedy has the voice of
[31:02] God
[31:02] it's perfect it doesn't let you get it
[31:08] as God sees it it's adults lately that
[31:13] you need and make it ineffective in your
[31:16] life but if the Holy Ghost is there the
[31:19] only best fix what God says and
[31:21] magnifies you to the others so we
[31:26] brought the Holy Ghost you got to be a
[31:28] real believer so tonight's religious
[31:33] conviction as a real people are walking
[31:37] in the light of the world not just a
[31:39] church member taking books and tapes but
[31:42] a real believer because that is the
[31:45] beginning of the restoration of the
[31:47] faith we know already
[32:15] they restore back the faith of the
[32:18] Apostles by way of a divine love if it
[32:23] the thunders because they don't have the
[32:26] TARDIS back there the tallest was a
[32:31] backside mystery that was kept only for
[32:34] this day because we need the standards
[32:37] to change the body
[32:39] so did Alfred church they have the
[32:41] articles the ad science and wonders but
[32:44] as they don't get this numbers because
[32:46] those founders will seal on the back
[32:48] side hallelujah praise God and
[32:51] government predestination other
[32:53] messenger so be with them Ponder's at
[32:55] the end of the seventh judge agency also
[33:02] buddy such hallelujah that is right in
[33:06] this message windows only half when the
[33:11] Alfa Josh had we must have that plus
[33:16] seven point six because in the seventh
[33:20] Isis is your name revealed in the
[33:23] seventh Isis is the change of your body
[33:26] under the seven points this is the
[33:28] change of the evil spirits
[33:30] under the seven point six research
[33:31] transformation all of those voices to
[33:34] become just like Jesus so by the time
