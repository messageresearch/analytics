[20:41] power to strain to dominion designs the
[20:45] wonders the miracles
[20:46] the gifts and places we see it low we
[20:49] see it efrem here Judah here we see as I
[20:54] learned to be possessed we come to the
[20:56] help us tonight on speakers by a word
[20:58] they're just in my ask it amen and amen
[21:01] god bless FIFA Bibles we want to read to
[21:03] poor scriptures in John 12 one River was
[21:06] 22:24 and also sin John 15 who is one to
[21:10] eat scripture reading this evening
[21:22] we inform cynjohn 12 and there were
[21:23] certain Greeks among them that keep the
[21:25] worship at the feast the scene came
[21:27] therefore the Philip which was a
[21:29] business of Galilee and say Sodom saying
[21:31] sir we would see Jesus and Philip
[21:34] comment until it's uncommon again Andrew
[21:35] and Philip tell Jesus and jesus answered
[21:38] them saying they are is come that the
[21:40] Son of man should be glorified verily
[21:43] verily I say unto you except a corner
[21:45] wheat fall into the ground and die it
[21:46] abideth alone but if it die it bringeth
[21:50] forth much fruit all our scripture from
[21:54] Saint John chapter 15 I am The True Vine
[21:56] my father is the husbandman one every
[21:59] branch in me that beareth fruit he
[22:01] taketh away and every branch that bears
[22:03] fruit he pushes it that had made bring
[22:05] forth more fruit now you are clean to
[22:07] the world which are spoken to you abide
[22:09] in me and my Anna I in you as the branch
[22:11] cannot bear fruit of itself except it
[22:14] abide in the vine no more can ye except
[22:17] ye abide in me I am the vine ye are the
[22:19] branches he that abideth in me and I in
[22:21] him the same bringeth forth much fruit
[22:24] for without me ye can do nothing
[22:27] you stop there priest well let's pray
[22:30] father we thank you for your scriptures
[22:32] may come and interpret an altar on our
[22:34] hearts in Jesus and I ask it amen and
[22:36] amen you will be seated
[22:38] so by the skipping we read the first
[22:40] scripture and Jesus saying except a
[22:43] corner we fall into the ground and die
[22:45] it abideth alone but if it die it
[22:47] bringeth forth much fruit so to produce
[22:51] much fruit requires it it's not right
[22:55] and I'm his desire for us is to produce
[22:58] much fruit because the next scriptures
[23:01] say herein is my father glorified as it
[23:03] was eight that you bear much fruit so
[23:04] shall ye be my disciples it's not right
[23:08] so his objective is not just to be on
[23:10] the tree as a vine his objective is not
[23:12] to be in height or bill no he has to be
[23:15] a fruit it's wanting to be connected but
[23:18] she connected for purpose you're
[23:20] connected to the vine that the life of
[23:22] the vine could fall to your branch
[23:23] because God no he needs the vine to be a
[23:26] fruit every bank and their fruit of
[23:28] itself a collab a fruit of itself but
[23:30] the vine used the channel of bran
[23:32] to be a fruit so he wants you to be an
[23:35] extension to produce fruit hallelujah
[23:39] he himself was the first fruit of them
[23:42] that slept he died to prove this
[23:45] resurrection power he died to prove that
[23:48] Suns gonna stay underground they could
[23:50] come up or glory to God and because I
[23:53] live he shall live also
[23:55] this is profit now and the gospel he
[23:58] said no watch
[23:59] he said we have nice okay yes we have
[24:03] nicely nomination nice our seminaries
[24:05] it's wonderful but Christ never told us
[24:08] to build any seminary or anything like
[24:10] that he said preach the gospel period
[24:14] and the gospel here we go isn't word
[24:18] only but true power and manifesting the
[24:21] Holy Spirit that I celebration don't
[24:24] like to talk about too much because his
[24:26] problems see because that these signs
[24:28] shall follow then I believe so anytime a
[24:33] has signs and wonders yeah Pentecostal
[24:36] this is all thing that the concerns was
[24:40] just getting a taste we moving into the
[24:43] real thing then what they were in person
[24:45] it says back there but this is not
[24:47] impersonation here dies my god are these
[24:49] long as I silence to see who would take
[24:52] the word believe the word die out and
[24:55] then produce fruit so when you see men
[24:58] come on dis no it has to be dead men it
[25:02] has to be men you become channel of
[25:04] God's inspiration to produce a
[25:06] manifestation this is what gives Singha
[25:09] you know she's gone sharing all this
[25:11] this is not that this is sons coming in
[25:13] position this is sons community business
[25:17] has come out to Dominion because we
[25:19] going back to even we are going back to
[25:20] Canaan land the destination is even is
[25:24] Jeremy long copy be a garden collie them
[25:27] a place called Eden a Garden of Eden we
[25:31] going back to Eden the trefoil mystery
[25:34] of God is to take us back to even
[25:37] that's why he reveal himself number 123
[25:40] eminences number true and to get us back
[25:43] even so we have talked about the
[25:45] evenings
[25:45] condition we have to go back to evening
[25:48] dominion power because what are they
[25:51] even struggling to struggling to believe
[25:59] and you barely making it and Jesus
[26:02] talked about I came that you might have
[26:04] life and have it and have it and have it
[26:07] more abundantly
[26:08] not not not just run Tinley run they
[26:11] suddenly oh god this Christian thing oh
[26:13] yes no no I'm abundantly hallelujah
[26:17] glory of God but as I was talking about
[26:21] this man some signed by man who penny
[26:23] stores and it's not from nothing and he
[26:26] has boasts it's true Sai Baba you have
[26:28] all this blessing you're making offer to

[26:35] and he please be forgotten by inside
[26:39] Baba and we have Jesus I didn't say I

[26:56] empower you we can enrich you we can
[27:00] transfer you Solomon was born in richest
[27:02] man annuity and God bless him not

[27:31] you have each of five loaves and two
[27:33] fishes and it multiplied what it had he
[27:36] could take what little you got and
[27:37] multiply what you had is panting look

[31:10] [Applause]
[31:12] [Music]
[31:15] all right let's do a little bit now
[31:18] watch so therefore the gospel ISM will
[31:20] only but to power and manifestation of
[31:23] the Holy Spirit which which would
[31:26] produce these signs of mark 16 when he
[31:29] said go into all the world preach God's
[31:31] Word every creature these signs shall
[31:32] form them I believe the word itself is
[31:37] dead until it becomes into action and
[31:43] produce life
[31:47] no let's connect that to what Barham
[31:50] says may these men come after him and
[31:52] bring these words the light so God but
[32:01] the chemicals of the world in the world
[32:04] and leave it for spiritual inspired
[32:06] scientists to mix it together to create
[32:11] the atmosphere that the world to commit
[32:14] the action not everybody had these be
[32:16] gifts to mix to put it together to
[32:22] create the atmosphere hallelujah for the
[32:25] world to live and in every age Gautam
[32:29] anointed man that will take the same
[32:31] scriptures and as a reason and the dead
[32:35] as a doornail but when the right man
[32:37] comes along it is not dead it's alive
[32:42] because the gifts this year to bring it
[32:45] to life and you other gifts on you today
[32:48] the print is worth her life because you
[32:52] have the ability to give I got some good
[32:55] and you know this morning that you are
[32:59] pirate access to your healing to your
[33:02] breath true to your deliverance or get a
[33:06] lot of show
[33:08] Oh hallelujah let's continue I said I
[33:16] won again
[33:16] the word is surface dead until it
[33:21] becomes actionable so I'm pretty sure
[33:24] I'll concede all right as I spoke that
[33:28] way to do it when I asked for that have
[33:32] fondled me years ago do you could buy
[33:34] that which thou conceived pipe that to
[33:37] the dead it's enough for my answer so
[33:40] that would have to remain dormant when
[33:43] Mary come that was other jump up in
[33:46] because Mary on the scene when Mary
[33:50] don't know that what kind of high honor
[33:51] that we'll have to find her just as the
[33:54] word from you when Malachi say he DoCoMo
[34:02] William Branham shall turn the hearts of
[34:04] the children back to the father's that
[34:07] were children dear was speaking about a
[34:09] particular people in Malachi I make no
[34:12] mistake when he said children you know
[34:14] he was talking about a certain
[34:16] generation a certain people it to be you
[34:19] [Applause]
[34:23] Malachi prophesied at hundreds of years
[34:25] William Branham born more than fifty
[34:27] years but we still here with this
[34:30] prophecy hanging over you he shall turn
[34:34] the hearts of the children that's a
[34:40] guarantee that says he Jesus swore by
[34:44] himself but your heart will be told
[34:50] literally what people have juvenile what
[34:57] Paul had you would have we cut to have
[35:01] it there is no devil in torment
[35:03] there is no devil in yet just stop the
[35:07] church from possessing what the I am
