[12:53] Bible you don't have to find it I'll put
[12:55] it up if you could read it back over and
[12:57] meditate on it and it's something that
[12:59] struck me about Brother's Keeper
[13:02] and I'll we just want to go straight
[13:04] into the wood tonight so if you want to
[13:06] follow with me that's fine I want to
[13:08] read from Exodus chapter 20.
[13:11] reading from first one
[13:13] so I'll go and I guess go therefore just
[13:15] listen and see what the Lord will do
[13:17] tonight amen and God speak all these
[13:19] words saying I am the Lord thy God
[13:22] which I brought thee out of land of
[13:23] Egypt out of the house of bondage Thou
[13:26] shalt have no other gods before me thou
[13:28] shall not make any make on the DNA
[13:30] agreement image only likeness of
[13:33] anything that is in the heaven above
[13:34] that is an it that is in the water under
[13:38] the Earth Thou shalt not bow down
[13:40] thyself to them nor serve them for I the
[13:43] Lord thy God I'm a jealous God visiting
[13:47] the iniquity of the fathers upon the
[13:51] children
[13:52] unto the third and fourth generation of
[13:55] them that hate me note note it put a
[13:59] responsibility here upon fathers
[14:02] so it's not just that your father
[14:04] in a vacuum
[14:10] [Music]
[14:12] foreigns upon the children until the
[14:15] third fourth generation of them
[14:18] with six showing mostly under thousands
[14:21] of them that love me and keep my
[14:23] Commandments
[14:25] thou shall not take the name of the Lord
[14:26] I got in vain for the Lord will not fool
[14:29] him Guiltless that taken him in vain
[14:31] remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy
[14:34] and and so on
[14:36] first 12 under thy father and thy mother
[14:39] that thy days may be known upon the land
[14:41] which now of the Lord I love it though
[14:44] shall not kill Thou shalt not commit
[14:46] adoption Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt
[14:49] not be a force witness against thy
[14:50] neighbor Thou shalt not covered thy
[14:52] neighbor's house but shall not cover
[14:54] their neighbor's wife nor his man's
[14:56] servant nor his need servants no it's Ox
[14:59] no his ass not anything that is thy
[15:00] neighbors
[15:01] and all the people saw the thunderous
[15:04] and the Lightnings and the noise of a
[15:06] trumpet and the mountain smoking and
[15:08] when the people saw it they removed and
[15:10] stood afiled
[15:12] and they said unto Moses speak thou
[15:15] witness and we will hear but let not God
[15:18] speak with us lest we die
[15:20] and Moses said unto the people fear not
[15:22] for God has come to prove you
[15:25] and that is fear maybe among your feces
[15:28] that you send them so you see what
[15:31] happened there God himself came down on
[15:33] filtered if I could use that word on the
[15:35] mountain when they begin to rock and
[15:37] Shake us God gave his word the people
[15:39] said don't let God speak let Moses speak
[15:41] and since that time God chooses to send
[15:44] prophets the word of the Lord come to
[15:46] the prophet's man shall live by bread
[15:48] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[15:51] to the Mount of God so God sent prophets
[15:52] to bring his word to us
[15:55] I want to switch now to Matthew chapter
[15:57] 25. we're in verse 34.
[16:01] and Jesus in rip in form dealing with
[16:03] Pharisees and Sadducees and Scribe all
[16:06] the religious characters in that day all
[16:08] in Scrolls of Moses and verse 34 22 says
[16:12] but when the Pharisees had heard that he
[16:15] had put the Sadducees to silence you
[16:17] shut them up they will gather together
[16:19] then one of them which was a lawyer
[16:22] asked him a question tempted him and
[16:24] saying Master which is the great
[16:27] commandment in the law
[16:29] question now the first thing we just
[16:32] read was the Commandments okay so here
[16:34] is the New Testament uh trickster
[16:38] yeah asking for edification to argue to
[16:42] fight Master which is of the great
[16:44] commandment in the law and Jesus said
[16:46] unto them Thou shalt love the Lord thy
[16:47] God with all thy heart with all thy soul
[16:50] with all thy mind
[16:52] so Jesus himself answered this this is
[16:56] the greatest commandment though shall
[16:59] love that the Lord thy God with all thy
[17:03] heart with all thy soul with all thy
[17:06] mind you don't need money to do this you
[17:09] don't need hoes to do this you don't
[17:11] need wife husband children mother
[17:13] brother father sister this is you
[17:15] Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
[17:18] all thy heart with all thy soul with all
[17:21] thy mind
[17:22] and then he says this is the first and
[17:24] Greek commandment
[17:26] one two even verse 39 the second is like
[17:31] unto it go shall love thy neighbor as
[17:35] thyself on these two Commandments hang
[17:40] on the law and the prophets
[17:43] so Jesus is saying that these two
[17:46] Commandments laws are the summary of all
[17:50] the Commandments you have heard about
[17:52] now Leviticus chapter 19
[17:55] reading from verse 16 it reads us Thou
[17:59] shalt not go up and down as a clear
[18:01] Bearer among thy people neither shall
[18:04] thou stand against the blood of thy
[18:05] neighbor I am the Lord so God was not
[18:09] just bringing him bringing them word or
[18:11] Commandments for his law he was bringing
[18:15] to them Behavior attitude uh
[18:19] uh things pertinental life and godliness
[18:22] as they were here but Isaac say often
[18:25] thou shall not go Pandora
[18:28] stand against the blood of thy brother I
[18:30] am the Lord
[18:32] though shall not hit thy brother in thy
[18:34] heart
[18:35] aha
[18:37] see I mean where we have hit in the
[18:40] heart though shall in any wise we do thy
[18:43] neighbor and not suffer sin upon Him
[18:45] Thou shalt not avenge
[18:48] here we go no beer any Grudge
[18:52] against the children of thy people but
[18:55] though shall love thy neighbor as
[18:57] thyself I am the Lord now let's look at
[19:00] the Amplified of this Leviticus 19. you
[19:04] shall not go up and down as a dispenser
[19:06] of gossip
[19:07] and Scandal among your people
[19:10] nor shall you secure Yourself by false
[19:13] testimony or by science endanger the
[19:17] life of your neighbor
[19:19] I am the Lord
[19:21] you shall not hate your brother in your
[19:24] heart but you shall surely rebuke your
[19:27] neighbor at least you in close sin
[19:29] because of him you shall not take
[19:31] revenge
[19:33] or bear any grudge against the sons of
[19:35] your people but you shall love your
[19:38] neighbor as yourself I am the Lord so
[19:41] you could see that this Duty
[19:45] or this issue of Grudge and oats and
[19:49] holding things against your brother or
[19:51] neighbor this thing was identified or
[19:54] fleshed out since in the orgasm
[19:56] and here in Genesis chapter 4 you know
[19:59] the story with Keem
[20:02] here it is of course we know he's of the
[20:04] serpentes of the devil and his nature is
[20:07] terrible and the Bible described it
[20:09] about uh Abel and Kim and verse 3 of
[20:13] which four chapter forces and the
[20:15] process of time it came to pass the king
[20:17] brought the fruit of the ground are
[20:19] offered unto the Lord foreign
[20:46] thou shall rule over here and King
[20:48] talked with Abel's brother he in the
[20:50] past when they were in the field the
[20:51] king rose up against evil and slew him
[20:54] that's to kill him and today is not
[20:57] physically killing you can break the
[21:00] effect of someone your friend family
[21:03] Minister different one Elder Deacon by
[21:05] sins tough that breaks people confidence
[21:09] in that person that's killing them
[21:10] they're killing the influence you know
[21:12] today we have years ago that didn't even
[21:16] exist we have what are called influences
[21:18] now uh influences are people who have a
[21:21] large following whether on Tick Tock or
[21:23] or Instagram or on Facebook or whatever
[21:25] it is and and people could send products
[21:28] to them and they would influence people
[21:31] to purchase this product so they become
[21:33] Powerhouse in themselves they are called
[21:35] influences and there are people who have
[21:37] influences on others but punks uh their
[21:42] negative and punks their Vibes on others
[21:45] and influence them contrary contrary to
[21:47] the wood control God's plan
[21:49] foreign
[21:56] and the Lord Senator King where is it by
[21:58] thy brother
[22:00] oh this is interesting it's not that God
[22:03] didn't know what happened you know of
[22:04] course God knew came to kill the evil or
[22:06] he's speaking to the man
[22:08] he's asking a question
[22:10] he wants to hear from his mouth his
[22:12] response and God speaks to us many times
[22:15] he wants our response not your silence
[22:18] your response and the Lord shall not the
[22:20] king where is he by thy brother and he
[22:22] said I know no no am I My Brother's
[22:24] Keeper here it is
[22:26] am I
[22:27] My Brother's Keeper the question tonight
[22:29] is would you go on in your life in this
[22:33] selfish mode in this cave mood in this
[22:37] tunnel vision mode where you go in the
[22:39] Rapture or you think you're going to
[22:41] Rapture all alone and you don't care
[22:43] about nobody else but you you have no
[22:46] interest no burden no put into nothing
[22:48] others every church for a long flat it
[22:51] doesn't matter no burden for your
[22:53] household no burden for your wife your
[22:55] husband your children nobody for nobody
[22:58] you are living your stuff you live in
[23:01] your story God says
[23:05] am I My Brother's Keeper and he said
[23:08] what has thou done the voice of thy
[23:11] brother's blood
[23:12] cries unto me from the ground
[23:16] I hope tonight that these few things
[23:19] that we are sharing we kind of rocket on
[23:21] that
[23:22] rocking our Consciousness that in this
[23:25] battle we are in
[23:27] we have brothers we have sisters we have
[23:30] those that we can see and those that we
[23:33] cannot see and they are still Sons and
[23:36] Daughters of God they are around the
[23:38] world there's a lack around the world in
[23:41] different nations and people for his
[23:43] namesake what has called out to be bride
[23:46] of Christ in this last day
[23:52] Jesus speaks speaking to disciples a new
[23:56] commandment I have given unto you that
[23:58] you love one another as I have loved you
[24:01] that you also love one another why would
[24:03] Jesus say that
[24:05] why because these disciples know came
[24:07] from different background different one
[24:09] of the one is a lawyer one is a
[24:12] fisherman one is this one is that and
[24:14] all the backgrounds wasn't in harmony
[24:16] with each other say the taxman
[24:18] collection taxes he was unloved by the
[24:21] fisherman or men who they call it
[24:24] contacts from him but the fact is God
[24:27] called all of them so you kind of say
[24:29] God do call this one do call this one we
[24:32] are not the one to tell God who to call
[24:34] She's Too Tall She's Too Short he's too
[24:37] big he's too thin whatever you can't do
[24:39] that we leave that up to God we have to
[24:42] connect with the source that's what we
[24:44] have to connect with so Jesus knowing
[24:47] they're going through it's tough he's a
[24:49] new commandment I given to you that you
[24:50] love one another as I have loved you
[24:52] and he shall love one another
[24:55] and then he said these words
[24:57] by this
[24:59] shall all men know that you are my
[25:01] disciple
[25:03] when a competition want to talk to
[25:05] nobody
[25:06] no when you come to church and decide to
[25:08] treat who you like and so on no
[25:11] by this shall women know that you're my
[25:14] disciples if you have loved one to
[25:17] another now love is something is not
[25:19] talk love is something that could be
[25:20] expressed something can be displayed
[25:22] something that we should that we often
[25:24] say You must a dog know if you love you
[25:27] know the job is still the atmosphere or
[25:30] you tell them get and you know you're
[25:32] running the dog love is something that
[25:34] is real you can't show it as an Evidence
[25:37] the material the thing but it is
[25:40] expressed oh God so loved the world he
[25:42] gives love is active love is not passive
[25:46] love believe it all things open all
[25:48] things enjoy all things love is active
[25:52] so by this shall all men know that you
[25:55] are my disciples if you have loved one
[25:57] for another so I'm showing tonight
[26:00] the importance of understanding
[26:03] that you in your circle in your little
[26:05] family Circle in your own world you
[26:08] cannot think that is the world you
[26:10] cannot think that is God's order because
[26:12] God set up a program where his people
[26:15] will be a people not just a people to
[26:18] God but the people that will be working
[26:20] and dealing with each other
[26:22] and it come like Johan can't ask for
[26:26] Independence neither could your neck
[26:31] all the bodies all the positive bodies
[26:34] as tempered together to accomplish a
[26:36] purpose you want to get up well the foot
[26:39] gets to walking you want to get
[26:40] something your hand get to move it you
[26:43] want to speak you're more good to talk
[26:44] it you want to taste your tongue is
[26:47] responsible in that area there the smell
[26:49] eyes the sea and God tempered the whole
[26:52] body so nanka Chris one another and say
[26:55] well I'm more better than you and I'm
[26:57] more prominent and I'm in front no you
[27:00] have to work with the way that God
[27:02] ordered stuff and that is how it is one
[27:05] person could be a foot a hand a two or
[27:07] whatever it is but we are all members of
[27:10] one body let's continue now first John
[27:12] two
[27:13] reading from verse seven Brethren this
[27:16] is John no no you hear what Jesus talked
[27:18] about my new commandment and here John
[27:21] uh in John he's reiterating this
[27:23] Brethren I write no new commandment unto
[27:27] you but an old commandment which you
[27:29] have from the beginning the old
[27:31] commandment is the word which you have
[27:34] heard from the beginning again a new
[27:36] commandment I wrote unto you which thing
[27:38] is true in him and in you because the
[27:41] darkness is passed and a True Light no
[27:44] shame it he that see it he's in the
[27:46] light and he said his brother is in
[27:49] darkness even until now and I am talking
[27:51] about in this message
[27:53] if I'm unclean he's in the light and it
[27:55] is brother we know he is and no light at
[27:57] all yeah I believe that's that's just
[28:00] talk
[28:01] verse 10 he that loveth his brother
[28:04] abides in the light and there is none
[28:07] occasion of stumbling in him
[28:10] verse 11. so John come back again with
[28:13] this but he hated his brother he's in
[28:15] that place
[28:16] and walk it in darkness and know it not
[28:20] whether he grew it because Darkness
[28:23] has blinded his eyes
[28:26] so hatred
[28:28] is a powerful thing
[28:31] hatred blames
[28:33] hatred kick out your eyes hatred make
[28:37] you walk in darkness
[28:39] let's go to Romans 13 and hear what Paul
[28:42] says in verse 8.
[28:44] all don't mind anything
[28:46] but to love one another
[28:48] or he that love it another had fulfilled
[28:52] the law Paul John Jesus Oh saying the
[28:57] same thing verse 9 for this
[29:03] adultery Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt
[29:06] not steal Thou shalt not be a false
[29:07] witness Thou shalt not commit if there
[29:10] be any other commandment it is briefly
[29:12] comprehended in this Saiyan namely
[29:14] though shall Love Thy Neighbor
[29:17] as thyself question do you love your
[29:22] neighbor as yourself
[29:24] and if you want to know who is your
[29:25] neighbor go back to the parable of Jesus
[29:27] and we give the parable Jesus
[29:32] We Stand love will get no ill to his
[29:35] neighbor
[29:36] love will get no ill to his neighbor
[29:39] that's what the Bible says therefore
[29:41] love is the Fulfillment of the law
[29:45] remember whatever I'm talking about a
[29:47] sister who couldn't get a good church
[29:49] she's working hard she's feeling the
[29:52] house see more the children or whatnot
[29:53] and somebody rebuking her and telling
[29:55] about Bible and different things and
[29:57] whatnot and she said when Jesus come
[30:00] I'll show you in my hands it's a
[30:02] powerful thing she was committed to her
[30:04] responsibilities and everything else and
[30:07] you know a religious person will say
[30:08] well this that that that that but I'll
[30:10] show you in my hands what do you have to
[30:13] show God their love is
[30:15] the fulfilling of the law
[30:18] who's 11 and that knowing the time that
[30:20] no is high time to wake up out of sleep
[30:24] for now is our Salvation here whatever
[30:26] when we first believed and when we
[30:27] believe the night is Fast Man the days
[30:30] at hand let us therefore cast off the
[30:33] work of Darkness let us put on the arm
[30:35] of light let us walk honestly as in the
[30:38] day not in writing and drunkenness
[30:40] nothing chambering unwantedness doesn't
[30:43] strive for envying and put you on the
[30:45] Lord Jesus and make my Provisions for
[30:48] the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof
[30:52] Matthew 18. this is coming down where
[30:55] the ties the road Matthew 18.
[30:59] and this is Jesus speaking here in verse
[31:01] 15. moreover If thy brother shall
[31:04] trespass against thee
[31:06] and go and tell go and tell him his
[31:09] fault between thee and him alone
[31:13] so Jesus is begin practical living do
[31:16] you know big mystery you know hot sun
[31:19] brother head this is behavior and issues
[31:23] and life
[31:25] and you see if you rather do something
[31:27] against you affect you go to him alone
[31:30] don't go to the phone and courses and so
[31:33] and so on but so and so and you tell 10
[31:35] people and yeah no he didn't say do that
[31:38] he said don't do that
[31:40] you go and tell him his fault between
[31:43] thee and him alone these with a specific
[31:47] these words are guidance these words are
[31:50] written in red he says Jesus speaking if
[31:52] he shall hear thee that was getting thy
[31:54] brother business self issues done it's
[31:58] still right dear but if he will not Yeti
[32:01] then take with d one or two more that is
[32:06] an amount of two or three Witnesses
[32:08] every will be established so the person
[32:10] have some problem with you and you go to
[32:12] them they don't want to hear they all
[32:14] auto tune and they and that's kind of
[32:16] crazy mood that is when you get two or
[32:19] three persons to go with you and go back
[32:21] to that this is what the word says watch
[32:24] and if he will not hear thee take two
[32:28] three one or two more that the mode of
[32:31] two or three Witnesses everyone may be
[32:33] establish and if he shall neglect to
[32:35] hear them
[32:36] tell it to the church
[32:38] so this is where the Jewish body comes
[32:41] in and this is where of course people
[32:43] who not in church in that way do belong
[32:46] to assembly or committed to our group
[32:48] then this doesn't affect them in that
[32:50] way but this is what she is talking
[32:52] about the church functioning and
[32:55] strength and power tell it to the church
[32:57] and if you need to get to hear the
[32:58] church let him be as an hidden man or
[33:01] Publican in other words is this
[33:03] Fellowship he's on his own
[33:06] group 19. again I say unto you oh my
[33:09] this is you should praise God on this
[33:11] one here so Jesus is talking he's
[33:13] preaching he's sharing and then he's
[33:15] moving into this gate I sent you that if
[33:17] two of you
[33:19] shall agree on Earth
[33:22] as touching anything that they shall ask
[33:25] it shall be done for them of My Father
[33:27] which is heaven could you give the Lord
[33:30] some praises to them
[33:31] so he is saying not you alone
[33:34] this is specific
[33:35] if two of you
[33:38] so Jesus put something in asking
[33:42] would join in with connection with
[33:45] agreement
[33:46] touching anything anything that they
[33:49] shall ask it shall be done for them but
[33:51] my father is in them
[33:53] for
[33:55] where
[33:57] two or three are gathered together in
[34:00] mining they am I in the midst of them
[34:04] so
[34:06] the picture that you on your own and you
[34:10] don't need these connections and you're
[34:12] only two and three and you don't need
[34:14] and you don't need and you're you don't
[34:15] have to connect and relate and
[34:18] communicate and you know that is not
[34:21] what the Bible teaches
[34:23] so when Jesus dropped all of this law
[34:25] about
[34:27] uh if your brother trespass against you
[34:29] of course
[34:30] you must have somebody want to get some
[34:32] clarity and then Peter came in verse 21
[34:35] then Peter came to him and said Lord how
[34:37] shall my brother sin against me and I
[34:39] forgive him two seven times
[34:40] now this I guess would have been a big
[34:42] number in Peter's mind
[34:45] Jesus said unto him
[34:47] I say not unto thee until seven times
[34:50] but until Seventy Times Seven
[34:54] so Jesus was bringing Clarity to how
[34:57] deep
[34:57] this forgiveness this dropping bro it's
[35:01] just getting it right with your brother
[35:02] here
[35:03] Max 11. almost done sorry about this
[35:08] but this is what happened Mark 11
[35:11] familiar scripture verse 22 Jesus
[35:14] answered 70 and half feet and God for
[35:16] realizing to you that whosoever shall
[35:19] see under this mountain Beetle removed
[35:22] will be the cast into the sea and shall
[35:24] not doubt in his heart which I believe
[35:26] that those things which he said shall
[35:29] come to pass if you have whatever is
[35:31] here so that is the third full speaking
[35:33] the word right but before that let's go
[35:36] therefore I say unto you whatever you
[35:38] desire When you pray believe that you
[35:41] receive them and you shall have them
[35:43] they leave it before you get it and
[35:45] you're gonna get it verse 25 this is the
[35:47] part we come to now but when you stand
[35:50] praying like we are going to bring
[35:51] tonight forgive if you have water
[35:54] against any
[35:55] fought against who any husband wife
[35:58] children Pastor Elder vegan neighbor
[36:01] boss doesn't matter with it
[36:05] if you're born against any lacked
[36:07] purpose that your father also which is
[36:09] in heaven May forgive you your
[36:11] trespasses
[36:12] so if you do not forgive neither will
[36:14] your father which is in heaven forgive
[36:16] trespasses in other words your sin is
[36:19] still on you if you can't forgive your
[36:21] brother that's what that is
[36:24] and this is where I got this inspiration
[36:27] from
[36:28] from Job chapter 42.
[36:30] and I know but Isaac speaking the spoken
[36:33] I mean we touch it sometimes but this is
[36:36] something to reflect on again tonight
[36:38] this is job you know this story so I'm
[36:40] not going to go over that but this is
[36:41] job 42 now this is way down the line
[36:43] then job answered the Lord and said I
[36:45] know that all kinds do everything that
[36:47] no thought can be withholden from thee
[36:49] who is he that guided counsel without
[36:51] knowledge therefore I have uttered what
[36:53] I understood not things too wonderful
[36:55] for me which I knew now
[37:08] by the hearing of the ear but not my
[37:10] eyes see it
[37:13] wherefore I am all myself
[37:16] and repenting dust and Ashes it is such
[37:19] a tremendous thing to come to this spot
[37:21] where you could truly hate yourself
[37:24] and repent
[37:26] Investments take out all the Masquerade
[37:28] take all the holy pretense and the
[37:30] action and so on and it was so so job
[37:34] came to this spot this is the spot you
[37:36] know call it a place call it the Anchor
[37:38] Point call it a junction
[37:42] have you reached this spot
[37:44] you just have to get to this
[37:46] you see this part here you don't make
[37:49] excuses
[37:50] well that is why I ask so because they
[37:53] and the church and he and and if he
[37:55] didn't do it so I was gonna do it so and
[37:58] the reason all of that is
[38:00] all that is gimmick all that is just
[38:02] fluff
[38:03] uh there is nothing
[38:05] uh
[38:07] that could say yes you know like God
[38:10] will hear your reason and say oh it's so
[38:12] you know it's true oh gosh that was
[38:15] going through or or that is why that is
[38:19] why he was misbehaving because your
[38:21] father didn't give you this or your
[38:22] mother oh okay say whatever you want to
[38:25] wait and you have an excuse that excuse
[38:27] and that explanation is not acceptable
[38:31] this here verse 6 I upore
[38:35] myself
[38:37] and repent in those and Ashes
[38:40] verse 7 and it was so that after the
[38:43] Lord has spoken these words unto job the
[38:46] Lord said unto elephants and to
[38:48] determinate my rat is Kingdom against
[38:50] thee and against thy two friends for you
[38:53] have not spoken of me the thing that is
[38:57] right as my servant job had
[39:04] [Music]
[39:10] and my seven jokes I pray for you for
[39:13] him will I accept who God is accepted a
[39:17] man that has come to Jordan a man that
[39:22] has come to the place where I abhor
[39:25] myself and repentance am I even the
[39:29] streets or myself I repent and just I am
[39:33] somebody forget that I am all myself and
[39:36] repent in destinations
[39:39] watch this
[39:41] let's move it again therefore taken to
[39:43] you know seven Bullocks seven rounds go
[39:46] to myself and job and all for yourself
[39:49] support offering and my servant job
[39:51] shall pray for you for him will I accept
[39:54] at least I delivered you after your
[39:56] Folly in that ye have not spoken of me
[39:59] the thing which is right like myself and
[40:02] job
[40:03] so elephants the timonite and bildad the
[40:06] shushite and so far they're nehemite
[40:08] went and did according to the Lord
[40:10] commanded and the Lord accepted job
[40:14] this is the verse I want to get to verse
[40:16] 10. and the Lord
[40:20] turn the Captivity of job
[40:24] when he prayed for his friends
[40:28] also the Lord give job twice as much as
[40:32] he had before
[40:34] now job could have took take up on
[40:37] approach that these Rascals these
[40:39] hypocritical Christians who come and say
[40:41] like a secret sinner things I want to
[40:44] see them again I'm done that is it I
[40:46] Shake In The Hand fellowship and whatnot
[40:50] foreign the Lord
[40:53] turn the Captivity of job when
[40:57] when he prayed for his friends
[41:02] let me ask a question
[41:04] who do you pray for
[41:08] what what is the burden
[41:12] the Bible talk about love your enemies
[41:15] who do you pray for
[41:17] who you we have a burden for
[41:20] you're living for you God is just like a
[41:22] side show for some of you it has to
[41:26] change
[41:27] you have to take it more serious because
[41:29] see you and captivity some of you
[41:32] you captivity by your decisions by your
[41:34] mouth by your attitude by your pride by
[41:37] your arrogance
[41:39] I want to wrap up here but oh Lord I was
[41:41] just loading this this evening here with
[41:43] this thing
[41:45] friends there are so many things we
[41:48] could say tonight about the perfection
[41:50] we are always trying to go to the eyes
[41:53] out of somebody else
[41:55] to make ourselves just a little holier
[41:59] than they are
[42:00] but if we look at the picture
[42:02] it is only God's grace that we are what
[42:06] we are
[42:07] and but Obama don't forget this story
[42:10] and I think I'll run it through tonight
[42:11] I'm sorry I want to apologize but I feel
[42:14] that this is something that is needed to
[42:16] be spoken
[42:17] sometime here I'll go on Ohio I learn
[42:19] and listen the hard way I was having a
[42:21] meeting down in Ohio I was staying in
[42:23] our country because the masses I could
[42:24] not see in the city
[42:25] is it in a restaurant lovely little
[42:27] waitress decently dressed ladylike and I
[42:31] was a little hungry I went over to
[42:33] ordinary little common American
[42:35] restaurant
[42:37] machine going Standing There was a man
[42:40] of my age a perhaps a married man with
[42:43] his arms around a woman playing a slot
[42:45] machine on
[42:46] I tune and look towards the back of the
[42:48] building there was a bunch of teenage
[42:49] boys rock and roll music I look over to
[42:52] my right I heard someone make a big
[42:54] groan set an age woman probably 60 years
[42:57] 70 years she had those old vulgar
[42:59] clothes on sandals perpet toenails
[43:02] painted doing toenails and here was
[43:05] really short cooled up
[43:08] [Music]
[43:11] and excuse themselves and started
[43:13] walking out to the restrooms I stood
[43:16] there
[43:17] well this is what a Brand number and I
[43:19] said God why don't you destroy the whole
[43:21] thing
[43:22] why don't you just sink it needed it I
[43:25] said it's my little Sarah and Rebecca
[43:27] going to have to grow up under this
[43:28] stuff as that I said how can you God in
[43:31] your great Holiness ever stand and look
[43:33] at such a thing like that unless we can
[43:37] sink it and I was standing there
[43:39] condemning the woman as I was I stepped
[43:42] back behind the door and felt the spirit
[43:44] of God come upon me
[43:47] and I stepped behind the door and I see
[43:50] something whirling so he's breaking in a
[43:52] vision I notice around the world was a
[43:55] Scarlet streak around the world
[43:57] and as I got to the world I see myself a
[44:01] little boy so God has shown him himself
[44:03] doing things that I ought not to do
[44:06] maybe not like that but it was sin and
[44:09] every time I did anything I've seen a
[44:11] great black shadow go towards him
[44:13] which God would have killed me at that
[44:15] minute and I see standing between me and
[44:18] God
[44:19] that perfect sacrifice
[44:21] I seen him standing there with tones on
[44:24] talking with Jesus on his head and they
[44:26] spit hanging on his face and every time
[44:27] I sins would start towards God he will
[44:30] reach it and catch it like a bumper on a
[44:32] car
[44:33] he was protected me from death
[44:36] and every time I would do anything wrong
[44:38] God would have killed me certainly his
[44:41] Holiness requires it is not requires it
[44:43] every time I'll do anything you do
[44:45] anything the blood of Jesus acts like a
[44:47] bumper I seen that kind of streak meant
[44:51] that the blood still holds the earth I
[44:52] stood looking
[44:53] I got a little closer to him I noticed
[44:56] he said father forgive him he doesn't
[44:58] know what he's doing and I look down and
[45:00] they lead a book and there's a recording
[45:03] Angel there standing by side and every
[45:05] time I sinned was put down in the book
[45:07] wow
[45:08] my name was on it
[45:10] and I realized that someday that blood
[45:13] streak would be listed I have to stand
[45:15] in the presence of God with my sinful
[45:17] life but I seen his Mercy he was holding
[45:20] off my judgment
[45:22] I went in humbly I knelt on my knees I
[45:25] said oh Jesus though Son of God I'm
[45:27] unworthy to come in your presence will
[45:29] you please forgive me for what I've done
[45:31] he touched his side with his hand took
[45:34] the old book wrote pardon showed it back
[45:37] behind him and my sins were gone so all
[45:39] this is a division right then you look
[45:42] at the stone in the face and said no
[45:46] no I have forgiven you
[45:50] but you want to condemn her
[45:52] then I seen what it meant so God take
[45:57] him show him his own life and said well
[45:59] look I forgive you and you come to
[46:00] condemn that woman
[46:02] as I come out of the vision I walk over
[46:04] to her I said how do you do she was
[46:06] drinking she said oh hello I said could
[46:08] I sit down she's half company I said I
[46:10] don't mean it that way lady I just want
[46:12] to speak to you a minute she said I said
[46:15] lady just a few minutes ago
[46:17] standing under behind that door so but a
[46:20] balance is going to share the experience
[46:22] that God gave him
[46:24] I began to tell her and I begin to look
[46:26] at tears because I run on my cheeks she
[46:29] told me I said lady
[46:31] you don't mean to do these things Jesus
[46:33] died the judgments of God is held off by
[46:37] his blood you don't mean to do this she
[46:39] said no sir she said my father was a
[46:41] dignity in church I was raised in a
[46:43] Christian home my husband and I were
[46:45] chatted members and live their Christian
[46:46] Life she began to tell me after his
[46:48] death she had two young girls she went
[46:50] the street on how the girls had left her
[46:52] she threw the life away she thought
[46:54] there was no hope for her I said God be
[46:57] merciful those he has foreign
[47:03] I said I am she said I'm ashamed of
[47:06] myself to be sitting here like this do
[47:08] you think there's a chance for me I said
[47:11] Jesus had his arms stretched out waiting
[47:12] for you to come lady and the other
[47:14] people began to take up I said would you
[47:15] walk out here in this floor with me she
[47:19] said I will so I took her back and I
[47:21] said you are the age of my mother would
[47:23] you kneel here with me in the floor and
[47:25] there in the floor we broke up that
[47:27] place that afternoon in an old-fashioned
[47:29] meeting and God see that woman by his
[47:32] grace she's dressed herself come to the
[47:34] meeting my father I know live in a
[47:36] Christian Life Tonight what is it God
[47:39] requires perfection
[47:41] he requires your repentance he requires
[47:44] your loyalty to him and he's looking
[47:46] tonight no matter how much you have
[47:48] sinned how little or how much you are
[47:51] still a sinner can it come in no other
[47:53] way but by Jesus Christ God all
[47:55] sufficient sacrifice and in him you're
[47:59] perfected forever think of it it's not
[48:02] nothing you do
[48:03] it's not new pages you turn but I know
[48:06] some of you have heard this years and
[48:07] years and over and over but God helped
[48:10] me tonight help us at night now they
[48:12] strike you it is not new pages you turn
[48:15] it is not a new life you start it's a
[48:19] confession of your own and God's grace
[48:22] to you that brings you to Perfection and
[48:25] then you are perfected in Jesus Christ
[48:28] but I'm almost done
[48:31] I want to get to Hannah
[48:33] and Hannah we know this man had two
[48:36] wives one was Hannah and the name of the
[48:39] other was a penina then I have children
[48:42] had no children and they came to me I
[48:44] talk about Hannah's Prayer and this time
[48:46] I went out early to worship and
[48:49] sacrifice unto the Lord and when the
[48:51] time of elkana offered Mrs Anna's
[48:53] husband he gave Pena his wife to all her
[48:56] sons and daughters portions but under
[48:58] Hannah he gave a worthy portion for he
[49:01] loved Hannah but the Lord had shut up a
[49:03] woman now you talk about drama in your
[49:06] house you talk about challenges in your
[49:08] own homes but her adversary this other
[49:10] woman in the house provoked her soul
[49:13] to make a threat because the Lord had
[49:17] shut up so because things wasn't working
[49:20] and had a favor there's somebody a
[49:23] personal terrorist a terrorist right
[49:26] inside your house in your house
[49:29] terrorizing you because you're not
[49:31] producing what is a pretty good news and
[49:33] as he did so yeah by year
[49:37] when she went into the house of the Lord
[49:39] she poof booked her therefore she wept
[49:43] and did not eat so therefore this
[49:46] provocation was going on for a long time
[49:48] and it came to a spot a breaking point
[49:51] where Hannah just crying didn't want to
[49:54] eat and then said elkana her husband to

[52:24] came to pass when the time was come
[52:25] Hannah conceived and their son called
[52:28] his name Samuel saying because I have
[52:30] asked him of the Lord and the man elkana
[52:32] and all his folks went up to offer the
[52:34] Lord really and so on and and Hannah

[52:40] know she said oh my Lord as if I so live
[52:42] it
[52:45] to the Lord but this child I prayed and
[52:49] the Lord had given me my petition which
[52:50] I asked him therefore also I have relent
[52:53] him unto the Lord as long as he lived he
[52:55] shall be lent to the Lord and He
[52:57] worshiped the Lord there
[52:59] you know some parents read the trend for
[53:00] themselves
[53:01] they don't have the respects to have the
[53:03] children they respect the ministry or
[53:05] the church or what we stand for they are
[53:08] in control they wrap the train tie them
[53:10] up when they were small when they got
[53:13] big when they're married they still tie
[53:14] them up like helicopter parents moving
[53:17] over them like there's my child in my
[53:18] son is my daughter such a shame but this
[53:21] woman here she gave a child to the Lord
[53:24] and chapter two I'll be close to this
[53:27] one and Hannah praying and said this
[53:28] kind of prayer my heart rejoices in the
[53:30] Lord my horn is exalted in the Lord my
[53:33] mouth is enlarged over my enemies
[53:35] because I rejoice in thy salvation there
[53:37] is none holy as the Lord but there is
[53:39] none beside thee neither is there any
[53:40] Rock like under our God talk no more
[53:43] exceedingly proudly let that arrogancy
[53:46] come out of your mouth for the Lord is a
[53:48] god of knowledge and by him actions are
[53:51] weed the bows of the mighty men are
[53:53] broken and they that stumble are good
[53:56] with strength and they that will Fuller
[53:59] have hired all themselves of bread and
[54:01] did it for Hungry ceased so that the
[54:03] baron had borne seven and she didn't
[54:05] have many children as Black Fever the
[54:07] Lord kill it and make it alive you bring
[54:10] it down to the grave and bring it up the
[54:11] Lord make it poor and make it the rich
[54:13] he bring it low and lift it up Oh my he
[54:16] reasoned up the port of the dust and
[54:18] lifts up the beggar from the downhill to
[54:20] set them among the princes and to make
[54:22] them inherit the Throne of Glory for The
[54:25] Pillars of the Earth are the Lords and
[54:27] he that set upon them he shall keep the
[54:29] feet of his Saints and the wicked shall
[54:31] be silent in darkness for my strength
[54:33] shall no man Prevail the adversaries of
[54:36] the Lord shall be broken oh blessed be
[54:38] the name of the Lord
[54:40] praise God the Lord shall be broken the
[54:43] pieces Out of Heaven shall be turned
[54:45] upon them the Lord shall judge the ends
[54:47] of the Earth and he shall give strength
[54:49] unto his King and exhort the Horn of his
[54:51] anointed are we going to close
[54:54] that rich young ruler that was so
[54:56] excited about what more can I do what
[54:59] more should I do and Jesus beat him and
[55:02] dropped the Commandments keep the
[55:04] Commandments up and he said all these
[55:06] have kept from my youth but you know
[55:09] what party didn't keep
[55:10] there is something he didn't keep
[55:13] when Jesus told him Jesus see that demon
[55:15] upon Him lost for money selfishness and
[55:18] no caring for his neighbor Jesus said go
[55:20] and sell all what you have and give to
[55:21] the poor the poor was his neighbor
[55:24] he was unprepared to help people in
[55:27] distress he was unprepared or not
[55:30] willing even though he was rich to help
[55:33] people who was in need and God saw that
[55:36] so what God really wanted for him was an
[55:38] expression of Brotherly kindness love
[55:41] your neighbor as you love yourself if
[55:44] you claim to love God and the keeping
[55:47] the Commandments where is the love for
[55:49] your neighbor or where is your love for
[55:51] the Brethren or where is a love for your
[55:53] brothers and sisters so job was relieved
[55:56] of his condition and captivity when he
[55:59] could effectively pray for the rest of
[56:00] Rascals who was accusing him of all kind
[56:02] of stuff and we thank God that God put
[56:05] in this age the blood of Brotherly
[56:07] kindness that has to be displayed to be
[56:09] identified as bright material in this
