call me this moment into your hands we ask you lord to pour out your spirit upon this convention so that the bride makes it to the purpose you chose us for so be it in the name of the lord jesus christ amen let's quickly turn into the bible in revelation chapter 10 verse one and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clove with a cloud and a rainbow was up on his head and his face was as hit when the sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot up on the sea and his left foot on the earth and he cried with a loud voice as when lion roared and when he had christ some of the founders uttered their voices amen old and the ram of three years old and a turtle dove and a young pigeon and he took him unto him for these and divided them in the midst and let each peace one against another by the birds divided he not and when the flowers came down upon the carcasses abram drove them away and when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon abram low an aura of great darkness fell upon him and he said unto abraham no other charity that i see shall be a stranger in the land that is not theirs and shall serve them and they shall afflict them for and also that nation whom they shall say will i judge and after all they shall come out with great substance amen my brothers and sister there shall be a jubilee there shall be a bribe after 2000 years now god is molding this uncoming masterpiece yes hallelujah because god himself took the oath amen no government can be eradicated out of off god never does anything without trust giving a sign to the people he is now about to vindicate a cabinet made to abraham who is the believer so the title for my exaltation my greeting will be the vindication of the covenant following the theme of pastor paul for the convention the manifested life of christ in the bride is a sign that the rapture is a pain and for an inspiration the life of the revelation of jesus christ in you amen the light of the revelation of jesus christ in you when the tree of life isn't you when the spirit falls on the word of jesus christ in you oh my my brother it will not produce two tables of living stone of stone but it will bring the prisons of the living god the image of jesus christ the exact expression of jesus christ the individual god becoming visible tangible working in the church the chief ruler the supreme god had the deities the sheikah glory the same jesus then the plan is fulfilled the plan is fulfill the cup the covenant is vindicated the god that came down in the edges he that came down on the mountains brothers and sister let me tell you this it is none of the time to go playing in the woods to go climbing a mountain or to look for a mount of fountain somewhere because god has always wanted to live in human beings an anointed people a man god in your church god in the individual god has finally found his plate his position his main position in the church god's pyramid is standing the tree of life is leaving the church that is the dedication of the cabinet it is a fail to the teachers of this world it is vague to the man-made group this one group of the hero the other group here but it is only on there to those which that name are written in the book of life it is unveiled to the church putting nothing in the last days a church having no grain no dogma but just strictly holding the living word from the scriptures amen brothers and sisters this is the secret and this secret is vindicated in the world of god living in the pride hallelujah amen amen hallelujah it is a revelation of jesus upon this rock i will build my church no other rock can be accepted nothing else can be accepted not made for this iraq is accepted no protestant iraq is accepted no random worshipers iraq is accepted no government worship iraq is accepted no other rock no other rock is ascenting save the life of jesus christ his life and his life alone is life it rejects you and your whole life fades the life of jesus shows up it takes over and god must see that life the people must see the world must see the true life of jesus with works signs and wonders amen not just gifts not just prophecies not just miracles maybe with that life is demonic we are speaking of the true life of jesus we've signs and wonders the restored best person of the holy spirit the angel that kendall has finally found a body he has finally found a bride to dwell in hallelujah the angel has finally found the body to dwell in the angel has finally found a resting place the life of jesus in the church a tangible jesus walking with luffy fasting now demon healing the sea for getting seen doing great work then brothers and sister when you see the seven virtues the very seven virtues of jesus the seven spirit becoming flesh then you have the vindication for the rapture the world the world is focused on something else that we are focused on this which is the sign abraham was expecting aaron wasn't waiting for something else he was waiting for that light to pass bang because in the evening time it shall be like hallelujah christ in you the hope of glory christ is expressing himself through you he wants to bring you back to him a glorious bride he is addressing you being the same yesterday today and forever then the seven seals have fulfilled the purpose in your life the covenant is vindicated god has revealed to you this great mystery hidden sins the beginning of time amen the mystery is being revealed to you how will you know it because is leaving you his life is in you it's nature is in you is you have the vast sea of the lord that is the position of the church on the top of the pyramid in you was sons and daughters of god ready for the rapture that is why what's former the sunset mountain remission of light when the seven angel came down in the people at the meaning of it then the people that declared it said this is the resurrection power that came down to prepare you to take you to the condition for the rapture brothers and sisters will not do it by yourself but god promised an apostolic church you will make it to perfection you will reproduce jesus christ on this earth no demon no denomination no easy is able to him the heat because the seven angels are right here building this pyramid oh man oh man glory be to god it will be the going away then the mystery of god is revealed unto you you know what it is the life of the seals because christ is the seal that we're up and this line can be seen in you god sees it the unbeliever sees it the word sees it the church sees it and you see it too then brothers it is the vindication of the governing the covenant is vindicated what abraham has to do is to keep up to keep the blood out of the priest of the world keep the bad down give the demon up deep past the false and mighty god keep up the false word give up the not doing bad stay with the man say stay with them work get the word pure do not bring shame on the mercy leave the mercy until this great light the pillar of fire the holy spirit comes in you then the government will be vindicated may the lord bless you shalom amen amen oh what a blessing may god bless you thank you jesus amen amen let's sing that song one of them one of them i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them amen one of them

seven and an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ so this is addressed to them that are of light precious faith praise god same spirit same word same anointing praise god grace and peace be multiplied unto you unto only those ones that is to the bride not the church member to the bride praise god grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and jesus our lord according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and victory whereby are giving unto us exceeding and great precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature oh blessed be the name of the lord by these promises we might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust you see why you can overcome the world you can overcome the women you can overcome the money it's not you now he has given that to you that you might have power to overcome having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this hallelujah there's something deeper praise god not just overcoming but beside overcoming praise god ah beside this giving all diligence out to your faith virtue and divert your knowledge into knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godness brotherly kindness and to broadly kindness charity why for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall never be boring you can't be dead no you are alive you can't be boring praise god no unfruitful in the knowledge so we know what we are talking about pray because it's revealed ah neither shall that ye shall neither be borrowing nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that look at these things is blind blind completely can understand cannot see the precious promises that are revealed is blind and cannot see afar off and has forgotten that he was paid from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling an election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly in the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ all blessed be the name of the lord may the lord add a blessing to the reading of his word amen you may be seated so i want to take this opportunity praise the lord to greet the convention amen and to greet our salute our precious pastor master paul ornanica his wife his family the church all the officers there may the lord richly bless you for this opportunity to fellowship around the world or to brethren of light precious faith want to salute the headstone top knuckle but isaac and his team for putting the tips together and i want to greet all the ministers that have gone before and that will come after me may the lord bless you magnify your ministries your churches and you'll be a blessing to bring in the last one then the rapture will go we certainly want to salute everyone this morning in your homes may the lord richly bless you as we fellowship around the world this weekend so for a title praise god be transformed into the life of the world be transformed into the life of the world and i want to take my subject from the team of the convention the life of christ in you is the vindication of the rapture this life of christ in you is a vindication that you have escaped praise god that you are already bound for the rapture that you are in the act that you are believe the act you have hacking to the voice and you have walked into the act praise god that when that trumpet sound you are bound for safety the token is applied the token is displayed and when i see the blood i will pass over you oh glory be to the name of the living god and for an inspiration christ in you the hope of glory praise god you may be seated amen so the team of the convention is the life of christ in you is the vindication of the rapture and the inspiration is the revelation by the life of christ amen and i took my scripture from the scripture of the meeting the second peter one praise the lord there are so many other scriptures but i want to pick on this by the grace of god the other ministers will come and also get something to share so we trust that the lord will be with us this weekend as we put our shoulders to the wheel praise god now the purpose and the focus of this convention is to produce the life is to see the life of god in you praise god not just coming to church not just belonging to message but we must see the life because creation is waiting hallelujah nature is groaning the bombs are flying everywhere not because they want to come they are coming because you must come back to your manifestation oh glory be to the living god hallelujah you maybe see that so jesus said i am the vine and ye are the branches and if the brunch bring forth a vine but abraham said that vine bears grapes the next brain that brings forth will also bear the same thing hallelujah so we must produce the very life of jesus christ the very power of jesus christ the thing that jesus did we must do praise god in him was power in him was quickening power praise god hallelujah and the bride must be word of his word spirit of his spirit power of his power life of his life pray when the storms come jesus didn't tremble he stood there said peace be still why there was resident power in him he has control and authority over every principality in his life glory to god so must the bride today produce the very life produce the very power produce the very evidence that christ is in you today oh you believe that hallelujah oh problem say you say brother abraham but look we have all these churches brevard say that is grafted vines i'm not looking for grafted vines we are looking for the original vine you maybe see that the original not a czech branch not a czech vine we are looking for the original seed to produce after its kind as it was on the day of pentecost silver and gold i don't have but such as i have i give unto you in the name of jesus christ that is what the bride must produce today the same life same evidence same power oh glory be to the name of the living god hallelujah so the churches brown said look brother abraham look at all these churches but once that is grafted vines now you can graft citrus fruit you can grab citrus fruit you can take an orange tree and put a lemon onto it it will grow i get in it now my mom said that is man grafted in and these organizations is what man grafted in praise god that's why i tell the people everywhere i go time for belonging to the message is over praise god nature is not looking for those that belong to message we are looking nature is groaning creation is groaning for the manifestation oh glory to god of the sons of god praise god that's what nature is waiting for you get it now hallelujah and this organization is what minecrafted in is lemon all the time it will grow because it's stuck out in the church name praise god hallelujah but let me tell you if that tree ever put forth another branch itself glory to god if the holy ghost drops down in the church on a bunch of individuals that are called our sanctified set aside for service what will he do praise god praise god now if that tree ever put forth another branch itself it will be an orange it will not bear any other thing that is grafted praise god so if you connect back to him the word or you will produce the life of the world you produce the character of the word you produce the spirit of the word you produce the power of the word but if you are connected to church oh glory to god you will just be mocking time but it is time to rise up and produce the life of the world praise him and if the power of god ever put forth another church listen now and if the power of god not the power of the minister not the part of your group revelation if the power of god ever puts forth another church it will be another pentecost another book of us will be wrote behind it because it is the church of god oh come on church that is what the word wants to produce that is what brother abraham came for to call out a bride as it was at pentecost to bring for the power to be written epistles already known by all men glory i feel good today to know that my name is in the book praise god my name is written there with the power of god upon my life to produce another experience of pentecost where the blind will see the lame will walk the devil here the pound will be set free why because another book of us will be wrote behind the bride this is the hour this is the time this is the season for the manifestation for the bride to be transformed into the life of the world oh blessed be the name of a living god hallelujah glory glory glory glory glory problem continues and jesus said i am the vine and ye are the branches now you cannot bear fruit in yourself you cannot bear fruit in yourself it's not he that run it it's not he that will it it is god that's you with mercy you've got to be called you've got to be chosen you've got to be elected and when you are chosen called and elected you must come to your place and your place is not church your place is not warming the check bench your place is getting a revelation a true revelation of who you are praise god where were you when the sons of god shouted for joy you've got to have a revelation you just didn't stand here you just didn't start from this place you were somewhere before your glory to god and you are living today as a manifestation of the seed that you were before glory that is why you are her power you have power to overcome the deadness you get it now oh you have a revelation because we must get a revelation hallelujah of who we are a revelation of the true church and what she stands for we don't stand for warming the church we stand for being powerhouses unto god living the life of jesus christ overcoming the world overcoming the lust overcoming everything that is not the word and standing there victorious with our triumphant jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever oh glory glory glory glory so you cannot bear fruit in yourself praise god but i threw myself into the branch and what kind of a fruit it did bear these sun shall follow them that belief ah what sign what fruit did it bear these signs shall follow them

you need a refilling the holy ghost is here oh press into it today same life same spirit same power oh blessed be the name of the living god hallelujah oh i love him today the prophet said amen the second church rises up the mystical body of christ will have the same signs ah the first church that was born at pentecost when they came out of the upper room brother they were exchanged people the world took notice of them that they had something to peter to the people praise god this is that that was spoken it was spoken it was written it was spoken there was evidence that it was there recorded by the prophet joel but it was not just spoken by the prophet they had to come a manifestation and when the day of pentecost was fully come peter stood out there he said this is that this is that that was spoken this is the life that was spoken this is the word that was spoken this is the power that was spoken by the prophet joel in the last days i will perform my spirit oh glory to god it had to confirm with the word and we must say this is that that was done in the first church and if the second church comes on the scene it will produce the same life it will produce the same power it will produce the same evidence glory hallelujah the second church rises up the mystical body of christ will have the same signs yet a little while the world seared me no more but you shall see me for i will be with you even in you in every branch not just in some church though not just in ivory coast but it will be in africa you'll be in ghana you'll be in trinidad you'll be in america everywhere the branch is there will be the same life same power praise god so we must waken up to the hour we must waking up to the season to know the power of god must be in the church not just in the building not just in the group but in individuals that are called and sanctified did you hear me now called and sanctified set aside for service to produce the life of jesus christ glory hallelujah oh glory to god amen you may be seated praise god amen you shall see me for i will be with you even in you in every branch see that in every branch christ is divine i am a branch you are a branch that is why you must produce your fruit hallelujah i can't stand behind the pulpit dead i've got to come in power and you cannot see the dead you've got to respond in power every branch produce the life if you are a singer produced a life if you are a worshiper produce a lie if you are a technician produce a lie praise god every branch oh glory to the end of the world not on sunday not today and tomorrow no but every day to the end of the world oh because it's dynamic power it is not a church power it's not an organizational power it's the dynamic power of jesus christ or a man planted by the rivers of waters planted by faith planted by virtue planted by knowledge planted by temperance planted by patients godless brotherly kindness planted by charity oh glory be to the living god you shall stand there your lips will not wither and whatsoever things praise god all you do shall prosper that is the man we are looking for today evergreen praise god standing planted by the rivers of living waters oh glory be to the living god hallelujah the world is in a sudden condition but in the midst of that sudden condition there's a pride there's a bride called out of sodom a bride called out hidden in the secret meets of jesus christ oh blessed be the name of the living god you may be seated hallelujah oh and in you in every branch so that spirit ah that power is in every branch to the end of the world jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever listen now that is the church of the living god so when this power is in every branch bringing for the life that is in the vine that is the church of the living god we're not talking about revelation we're not talking about mysteries no we're not talking about speaking in tongues when the very life that is in the vine is reflected in the branch that is the church of the living god praise god hallelujah oh i feel good this morning i feel like leaving this place today oh glory to god that is the church of the living god that is who it is that is the kind of a witness he has then you become a witness of the word become a witness of christ when this life of the vine is in you producing the very life producing the very manifestation oh blessed be the name of the living god if these things be in you and abound praise god that's the life of the vine they must be in you the mother bound you believe that today oh you may be seated praise god hallelujah pray i feel good today amen in john 15 jesus said i am the vine and here are the branches the brother said he is the main vine praise god that wheat comes out of the original root from the original seed that has the life in it now the vine does not bear fruit the vine produces the life to the branch it doesn't bear fruit you want fruit you don't go digging down the root to get fruit no you look on the tree and if that tree has no leaves you'll not even have expectation for fruit so there must be leaves green fresh leaves praise god to attract you hallelujah he said this tree looks healthy let me go see if i can get some mango fruit from there but if that tree is all dried up you will not even be attracted to have the expectation to even turn aside and look are you following me now glory to god oh glory amen now the vine does not bear fruit it is the branches that do that oh come on seven thunder branches let us see the seven thunders praise god producing the power oh that is in divine come on now it is time to rise up and begin to speak and walk like a son like a daughter because these signs must follow them that belief glory hallelujah man now the vine does not bear fruit it is the branches that do that now what this you can take a sister's tree such as an orange and graft it into a grapefruit limb or a lemon limb tangerine limb and other kinds of that variety and all those will grow all those limbs will grow but those grafted limbs will not be oranges no sound ah you hear me no they can't christ is the vine huh methodist can come and graft to that name baptist can graft to that name now thunders can graft to that name every other inspiration can grab into that name praise god but we are not looking to be grafted no we want to be part of the original vine that is why is back to the world back to the original that is why we cannot take any other life except the life that comes from the vine the original word the spoken word is the original seed we cannot take any other revelation than the revelation of jesus christ upon that rock i will build my church oh and the gates of hell will come other interpretations will try to be grafted in but the true vine the true vine will produce original branches that will produce the original fruit the original life and they will stay true to who they are glory hallelujah that is why you can't fight any other branch i guarantee now that is why we try to preach it from the original vine to warn you that though you are on the same tree pray from drawing from the same vine but there are other grafted branches don't try to produce their fruit because you are not of those other branches you come from the original vine the holy ghost itself you get it now seven thunders give fate that is where you stand original fight producing branches of the original vine hallelujah so all other interpretations can be grafted to that tree you get it now i am the holy ghost no doubt grafted you get it now but the true branch comes up there and said no sir have you received the holy ghost since you believe that is the original branch from the original vine the doctrine of the apostles have you received the holy ghost you follow it now getting a revelation today why those interpretations must exist because there are grafted branches taking the outsourced from the vine but when that tree puts forth an original branch it will produce the life of the original vine oh come on now praise god hallelujah you get it now you may be seated praise god amen remember yet those limbs will be driving off the life in the tree but if that tree ever puts forth another branch of itself it will be an orange brand that bear oranges why because the life in the limb and the life in the trunk are identical identical whereas it wasn't so with the grafted limbs those grafted branches had their source in other kind of life from other trees from the other roots from the other seeds oh they will bear their fruits all right but they wouldn't bear oranges they cannot because they are not the original cannot no matter how plain you put it cannot bear it because it is not of the original eye with me now so we must get off those grafted branches don't even fellowship praise god hallelujah oh have no fellowship with darkness you get it now you can't be in and out all the time no you've got to be the original branch because your life comes from the original vine glory oh you love him today glory so the prophet said denominations which are man directed cannot be born of god for it is the spirit not man that gives life it is what the spirit not mine so when man become the holy ghost what kind of spirit is that that's man's spirit that denominational spirit and cannot be born of god do you hear it now you see that hallelujah so what does it take to produce this life nicodemus knew at a point that come on now where i belong i can't produce the life that jesus has i can't produce his life so he went to jesus what shall a man do in order to have eternal life jesus said except a man be born again how can i be born again oh revelation needed to be there nicodemus needed a revelation but he came carnally as a denominational pharisee praise god jesus said except you'll be born of water and of spirit you cannot even see the kingdom you get it now so there's got to be a born-again experience in order to see the original lie oh glory and the prophet the people that believe the message for their day they are the seas of the kingdom at that time glory you've got to believe the message for your day to produce the life of the vine at that time at this time so love must be there charity comes upon brotherly kindness right we are doing good praise god hallelujah now be seated praise the lord so this power that is in divine remember now man cannot be born man directed denominations which are man directed cannot be born of god i get in it now when we talk about denomination don't just look at the pentecostal baptist and that no talk spoken word church a lot have been denominated i belong to spoken word i am a no come on now you've got to be born again to produce a life you get it now that is why young people you've got to have a personal experience you've got to confess you've got to accept jesus christ as your personal savior not born into church not born into message but have you received the holy ghost since you were born into the message mama is in the message papa is in the message but you must accept jesus christ as your personal lord and savior then you begin the walk with christ then you are you are not grafted but as long as you follow mama and papa to church you become a grafted branch that's why people are in the message and living like the world because they take their souls from the world but grafted their praise god but when they bear their fruit they must produce the fruits of what that original seed is you get it now but you are to be transformed today praise god you are always a son but get out of them vineyards praise god that don't belong to original vine and be transformed today oh into the life of the world you get it now you may be seated alleluia so it takes a power bronzer for the spirit for it is the spirit not man that gives life so it takes the power to give this life praise call and the brother said let the fundamentalist let the people who deny the power of god say it is wrong huh but the same power does speak the world into existence is in those people that is god the holy ghost same power that's the let there be is in the bride that has got the holy ghost from the original vine same power oh come on church that's why i said man is so minipotent huh you mean to tell you you born of flesh yes when you produce the very life of the original vine you become a minipotent same power that spoke the world into existence let there be light that same power is in the bride same power is he knew it was an official man who could not sign his name but when peter stepped out of the upper room praise god same power creative power hallelujah the same power was in peter ignorant and on leonid but the same power was there glory hallelujah oh by the same power that spoke the world into existence is in those people that is god the holy ghost that's right men and women but abram said it is time we found out who you are are you getting me now ah you just didn't come here to work and get some little pay and get excited and it cannot take you to the end of the month no you are miniature creators ah you can create praise god that is the power that is resident in you that is the life you must produce today the same life ah jesus had power when it was time to pay the time say go catch that fish cut the stomach open there's a coin there good pay nothing to worry about brother we've got to know who we are we just didn't come to church believing god said the prophet and say the prophet didn't know you must do the same greater works because the same lie does in the prophet must be in you to produce the same results you get it now hallelujah that's right men and women it is time that we found out who you are the devil is trying to hide you back satan is trying to hide you back with reasoning power satan can go into the realm of revelation praise god that's why jesus came and died if satan had a revelation he would have known that the lamb was slain before the foundations of the world pray it was already done finished but satan lacks revelation so jesus brought the evidence went to the cross and said it is finished hallelujah it is feeling now you have seen because satan can only walk by sight praise god but the bride will walk by revelation yeah so don't let the devil hide you back there to tell you that these promises are for some other people no it's for you the promise is unto you and to your children and to your children's children and to them that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call that is you now pray the promises unto you adoption is yours perfection is yours dynamics is yours today praise god the devil is trying to hide you back there tell you that you are some little draw down something you are not you are sons and daughters of god oh come on now uh i'm a son of god a daughter of god satan you can't stand my way why deity resides in me oh come on now the prophet said the deity is not in heaven it is in you hallelujah i know you think i am crazy but let me tell you something brother when you realize that the almighty god lives in you the world can understand why jesus came down on the head and said he is god ah how much more when you can declare that you are having the almighty god living in you but when you realize that almighty god lives in you immortal life my life i give my i give zoe the life of god is in the human being you get it now the life of god that is why you can live above the reproach live above the well live above sin and everything why the life of god is in you not your life your life can only produce hatred and malice and jealousy and envy but when these things are in you the life of christ it lives above those things you get it now then the world don't understand you why it is not your life it is the life of god in you oh it makes you love your enemy it makes you bless them that kills you it makes you rejoice praise god it makes you pray for them that revile you those that falsely accuse you though that's use you it makes you pray for them why the life of god is in you you get it now oh the prophet you may be seated is that a brother sister that deity is in you that deity is in you a little while the world see at me no more but you shall see me for i will be with you even in you to the end of the age christ in the manga no christ in you we are not worshiping christ in a manger it's easter time huh very soon though see the catholics who carried jesus on the cross walking about every street and drumming and making noise but we have deity christ in us the hope of glory you get it now why revelation is revealed to you upon this rock i will build my church you get it now okay is it about christ in you the holy spirit the hope of life the see the holy spirit is the hope of what life so you can't have any life outside the holy spirit your good moral self cannot do it that's a grafted branch but christ he knew the holy ghost the hope of life hallelujah the creator god himself dwelling in the human being it does not appear what we shall be but we shall see him as he is for we will be made like him we will be made like what like him that's why the keys were given unto peter second peter one if these things be there you see that oh as we went down praise the lord hallelujah the prophet said today that is what is the matter with the church the hope of glory the baptism of the holy ghost has come into the people's hearts and they don't recognize what it is they think is a little church joining or something like that no but we're not here to join church we're not here to we're not here to draw congregation because remember three seeds have been planted denominational seeds pentecostal seeds and the wet cedar and these two pentecostal denomination is looking for numbers which ultimate aim is money but brother we escape the loss of the flesh we escape the pride of life we scrape the praise god the loss for money women and popularity we escape them so the word seed must be planted in you to produce a wet bride you get it now pride for who pride for jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever oh you love him praise god hallelujah so it's not a little chat joining now no it is to get the life from the original vine hallelujah so the prophet said amen you made me see that he said but that is the god the creator living in you and giving you all the power and you are in possession of anything that he had jesus had healing you are in possession of it today power over demon powers principalities you have that today over yourself you can overcome not my will but your will lord surrender it all to him that is the life of the world coming back alive glory so it is in you to abstain from evil you can't have this life and be of evil ah because in him is righteousness in him is holiness in him is purity and without holiness no man can see god he has to be in you for you to live holy i'm not hearing amen on that one ah it's still the word now is till the power is still the same thing you get it now praise god hallelujah glory be to the living god so it is in you to abstain from evil and to do good you must do good because in there is godliness to be like jesus to live his life to live his character to leave his image and character is not a victory now character is not a gift it is a what a victory you must fight to overcome in order to obtain character it's not god giving it to you as a gift you following it now praise god oh glory to god so it is in you notice that it is with you it is already inside of you to abstain from evil god alive in divine seance evil you get it now to do good to shun evil and flee to righteousness to turn away from temptation i was tempted no you have power in you to turn away the life in god in you turns away from temptation come on young people don't tell me this time is harder every time has been harder the same spirit same devil praise god but power is in you to run to escape and live the life of the vine you get it now oh to turn away from temptation all malice hatred strife envy and so forth come away from it for that will take him from your heart if you receive him embrace him and love him and hold him in your heart and love him i tell you the church together in that kind of power has the power to bind the heavens you get it now so every power is here every mystery is revealed that's a mystery to show you how to bind the devil shown evil i tell you the church together in that kind of a power has the power to bind the heavens heal the sick open the eyes of the blind the devs speak the dumb speak the dev hear the dumb speak the cripples walk the blind see why it is recognizing the power of the almighty god into your heart there he is the deity deity is not in heaven he's sitting right here in the heart of men glory oh but why don't we see this life this power in us why there's got to come forth a separation first maybe see that separation we must separate so the brother said amen these waters of separation must be kept in a clean place you can't keep this word of life the life of god in a dirty place no it's got to be clean when you go to a spring praise god it springs out clean water is even pure than any purifying machine why because it's coming from a rock rock through a rock through a rock through a rock and by the time it comes out it is pure it is clean praise god so these waters of separation must be kept in a clean place oh the prophet said the waters of separation is the word ah the waters of separation is the word paul said over in ephesians over here he said for he has washed us with the waters of the world see the waters of separation the word preaching the word separates you you got it now so don't just come to church and go no it separates you it positions you back to the original vine to be a son or daughter of god living the life of the world preaching of the word separates you you hear the word saying i am wrong i better quit this i am playing church i better quit that that is the water of separation so the word must change you the word must make you to repent the word must renew you you are always a seeder remember god is not coming to create something new but he must change you you must be transformed not your thinking transformed to the image to the life of the world but you must hear the word that brings the water of separation bringing you back to christ the word are you following today now hallelujah that's the water of separation and should be kept in a clean place not a secret smoking preacher no sir not the preacher that is running around over the country run with other women and things like that not a check that practice free love that kind of foolishness grafted branches you get it now the life praise god and all these ungodly things and goes to baseball games huh sunday you can't wait for check to close your run into football matches no forget that one you hear that now and goes to baseball games and has big entertainments and social dances in the church is to be kept the word of god is to be kept in a clean place amen a clean place that when the wayward man comes by he can come into a clean place and be sprinkled with the waters of separation the world has power to change it has power to produce it has power to transform must be kept in a clean place you get it now so we want this life right from all that we have had we now want this life how do we get the life revelation must anchor in your soul when nathaniel praise god hallelujah doubt it but can anything good come out of nazareth they come and see when he met jesus revelation dropped down when thomas doubted when jesus appeared he said my lord and my god revelation dropped down who are thou lord i am jesus whom that persecuted soul caught a revelation what would thou have me to do you get it now when revelation comes down you are ready for service saul a pharisee but when jesus responded i am jesus whom thou persecuted he said what has done for me to do he knew it was his calling uh when are you gonna get revelation to know that you have been called to this thing you have been called not to church you have been called to produce the life to be transformed from what you are into the word of the life of the living word of god you see it so how do we get this power these things must be in us you get it now not one if you wanted one you should have come in paul's day but once you are in this age all with charity must be there that is the complete life of christ the preacher can dodge it ah the musician cannot dodge it the pastor's wife cannot dodge it everybody must come through that these things must be in you and about when i see these things then i will pass over you this thing is not phd it's not phd thesis it's so difficult i cannot know every believer must come true faith all the way to charity [Music] are you following me now praise him hallelujah so the prophet said amen you may see that the statue of a perfect man say here you are seven church ages seven steps god building his church so these are god building his one his church and you know the church is the individual watching tv will not produce this in your life let me nail it well because it's not so relaxed that tv has become part of the church homes the prophet said kick that thing out of your home how many books do you read in a week but you can watch all the tv programs and run their commentary if these things be there not how much commentary of tv programs you can run ah you can wake and wake and watch tv till 1am but you cannot read the book of the world for one hour you can't read a message book for one hour if these things be in you glory hallelujah god building his church [Music] is one person into an individual it's like one person into an individual into himself the glory the power of god coming down through this i get in it the power of god coming down through this welding it together therefore the pentacles are people that let out the lutherans let out the westlands and things doesn't know what they are talking about you see hallelujah they lived in this part of the temple that is the way some people can come up that high and drop off can come up all the way maybe looter drop off god cannot perfect that god cannot cement that god cannot put his power upon that the capstone cannot come upon that you get it now there's but there's a genuine part of that keeps making that building come on there's a genuine part so in every eighth god has got a genuine people that will hold on to the faith when the son of man cometh shall he find the faith that means that shall he find a people called up by his name making up the building the body of christ paul was there with his people praise god they held out iranians was there they held out martin columba luther wesley malachi for and his people they are holy now you get it now hallelujah oh that's the way some people can come up that high and drop up but there's a genuine part of that keeps making that building come on i will restore save the lord my brother said they eat it down remember the variety they eat it down but he pruned it huh they got denominational branches he pruned them off you get it now so if you don't produce this you'll be cut off god keep pruning that bright tree because it is a bright tree and he is the vine of that tree so every other grafted brown god will cut it off why because there are some genuine parts that keep making that building go up you get it now oh you may be seated hallelujah he pruned them off they raised up another check denominational branches he pruned it off but the heart of that tree kept growing the life is there you can kill god you can't kill the move of god the promise of god is sure and true nothing can stop it hallelujah oh the heart of the tree kept growing and in the evening time it shall be light that is when christ come the holy spirit jesus comes down and sets himself at the head of the church then and he will be he said and he will resurrect this church being his own body in there is the body and the way god is expecting us as individual to grow the way he brought the church in to grow every church age it becomes one big church the way god expects you to grow is the way he brought this the church ages so we are not we are not pentecostal come and succeed and you have you have done your religion no we're not here to do religion we are here to produce the life the power the world so the prophet goes on when a man possesses these kinds of things huh we want power right we want to produce the life right when a man produces these kinds of things then the holy ghost comes upon him so the holy ghost will never come when these things are not there when a man possesses these kind of things then the holy ghost comes upon him no matter you might speak with tongues you might impersonate any gift that god had you might do that but until these virtues go into you [Music] these virtues brother abraham said so see why they fight the virtues in the message um but these virtues must go into you they say we shouldn't call them virtues because brother abraham it is touch of a perfect man but the prophet said until these virtues go into you you are still of the real true foundation of faith so until these things are in you you are not even a believer oh come on church ah these things must be there you get it now until these things are in you you are you are still of the real true foundation of faith but when these virtues grow in it must grow in ah so you have a little faith keep watering it oh keep holding on keep believing keep pushing it is gonna grow gonna grow gonna grow grow grow grow why these things must grow in and you added to that then you are a living monument you become a living temple a living top knuckle a living moving praise god temple of the living god living monument oh you believe that hallelujah you are a living moving idol see oh you get it now praise god my brother said but when we not in an imaginary way so you don't get these things in an imaginary way the bible says when you add to your faith we can't we can we can't define it in any other way the bible says when we add that's what we have to say but we know we are not adding by our human effort our revelation but we've got to say what the word says at your faith virtue so i can't come and explain it in any uh over the sky mystery and under the sea mystery no he said when you act your favorite to you but it's not you adding now is him by his spirit that's when the things together oh come on church not in an imaginary way but prostrate yourself before a living god a living virtue a living knowledge a living patience a living godliness a living power coming from a living god making a living a living image in the stature of god what is he doing the same thing that jesus did walking the same way he walked doing the same things he did because it is not imaginary thing there is a reality that proves you get it now these things are not just imaginary that's power power of the life virtue is a power huh when you can walk out of sin abstain from evil you think it is you that you power in you giving you power to escape you maybe see that hallelujah oh brother see what i mean see how these virtues these building materials type in with the messengers with the checked edges now one of these days we are going to take each of those words and step in their mouth you see and show that it proves it goes together the virtues and the messengers go together so you see the blind pharisees in the message we can't call them virtues no these virtues but we take our source from the original vine and it is revealed to us the branch come on now virtue they are veggies that builds up the individual power flowing in you to give you power to be like jesus live like jesus walk like jesus talk like jesus believe like jesus demonstrate the word like jesus vet you power glory to god you maybe see that hallelujah oh brother now that is the house that god dwells in when these things are there that is the house that god dwells in so how can god dwell in there there's malice and jealousy and unforgiveness no no i can't be you see that that is the how that god dwells in not a building not this four square building ah the victims are in our church hanging they are hanging on the wall that's paint you get it now so you enter the church you see that that's the virtue check no forget it the virtues must be in you if these things be in you and abound they make you not they make the church the world they make you now you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful so you have no excuse not to know the scriptures god if they are in you and abound you will not be unfruitful in the knowledge of jesus christ the word you get it now no you can't be ignorant of the scriptures because romans 5 romans 15 4 say for whatsoever things were written a fourth time we were written before our time whatsoever things were written before our time they were written for our landing [Music] why you code this scripture and link it to that scripture and link it that's pentecostalism come on now come on wake up wake up ah the bride must be the word the more you hear the word the more you become the word oh come on church oh they were written whatever things were written up all time we were written for our learning that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures we might have hope so how can you be there lacking the knowledge of jesus christ and want to have hope no you can't you must know by the learning of the scriptures [Music] you get it now yeah praise god john 6 63 is that it is the spirit that quickness so if the spirit is in you it will quicken you back to the world huh the flesh prophet said nothing the words that i speak unto you they are spirit so these things my our spirit and if you don't have the spirit you can design spiritual things so the life is spirit coming into you to break in that mortal body bring it under subjection of the word then you can live the life for the way that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life you get it now so we must go by the scriptures that is the house god dwells in not a building with big bell on top of it no but a body has now prepared me a body that god can dwell in god can walk in god can see in god can talk in god can work in amen living his true mentality of god you become the living instrumentality listen the material that is going in the rupture is not it's not it's not trying error god ain't going to take in trial and error i will try if it works no god is looking for men of faith rugged men of faith that can take him at his word these words are spirit and they are alive you get it now a body has not prepared me amen living is the mentality of god god walking on two feet where is god walking on two feet amen in you glory the footsteps of the righteous is ordered of god god walking in you for ye are written epistles read of all men and if the life that is in christ be in you you will bear the life that christ born [Music] christ manifested these things he hurt them you get it now praise god and the prophet's good amen we are good um as we wind down praise the lord he may be seated then said in the study of a perfect man paragraph 352 then god representing his church as a bride a woman represents his church as a bride and the way he brings each individual to being his son here now the way god brings each individual to be a son or a daughter listen and the way he brings each individual to being his son to go into to go in that bride he also brought the bride through these ages so you can't be in the bride without coming through these things so the bride impulse time are those that are here the church of ephesus the age of episodes the age of seminar pegamos tytra sardis philadelphia laudacia that is the bride outside of the bride they've been pruned out cut off praise god so you better make sure you bear the fruits of the vine in order not to be pruned off because if you say you believe without the life pray it's hard to say but it's the truth oh we cannot do nothing against the truth but for the truth we gotta preach it regardless we've got to say it regardless because pop peter said you've got to make your calling an election sure because these things has been have been revealed to you for you to know how to walk so that you redeem the time when you get time get these things into you now you redeem time by going to do unnecessary things that don't profit your soul these things must be there you get it now [Music] praise god god representing his church you see that he brings each individual to being his son to go in that bride he has brought the bride to these ages till he bring this one to the complete church into this so we must be brought completely into charity fed all the way to charity my brother my feet will become my head says so it can't move like my hand is because it's my feet luther can't do the things that we do nada can the method is because they wear something else the feet move because the head says so and the head never say now feet you become the hand ear or or ear become the eye see but each age are you with me now but what each age hallelujah can we say together but each age stay with me now but each age god has placed these things into his church and planted it and pardon it by showing that each individual has this possesses these qualities and this being when it is completed is the church of god going to the rapture this being this being this being when it is completed is the church of god going into the rapture that is what you have to come to when your being is completed with these things then you have the life of christ then you are ready for the rapture church glory to god it is not skim milk now oh the kingdom of god is not meat and drink oh glory to people we must press our way into these things praise god and this being and completed is a servant of god in the church of god that is going in the rapture see what i mean there you are that is the full thing [Music] there are no shortcuts to the life of god these things must be there they must abound we must see it it must be manifested it must be lived out then we know that deity is in you praise god oh as we get ready to close out you maybe see that when you surrender your complete being you have to surrender listen salvation is a choice you choose to believe or choose not to believe god gave you that right that free moral agency you choose to live the life or choose not to you choose to get the holy ghost or choose not to because if you to give you the you give you the prescription repent every one of you and be baptized then you will receive the gift god is not a trial error man no he knows what he's talking about when paul saw when ananias went and laid house on him and prayed over what did the holy ghost what did the bible say the holy ghost he received the holy ghost what did he do how many years did he wait in the message right there had the experience hands led on him he received the holy ghost so if you truly repent you're not going to come you know in your own self-conceited way lord fill me with the holy ghost he will do it because you have to come by his way repent repent mean that change your ways because your ways are not my ways see that so when you surrender your complete being then the holy spirit just pours through you you must surrender your being you can't bring your body to church and your heart is in the well ah you can't bring your body to church and your mind is calculating dirty things no when you surrender your complete being your eyes your reasoning your heart your body your everything must be surrendered i surrender oh all today my blood said savior i surrender just a song you've got to surrender your complete being make time for him i keep telling people that people think that god is god is somebody so he you know and what i'm doing i'm putting in so much effort god will look at my effort and just take me to heaven you'll be you'll be like that as you are here and we don't want those spirits no we want complete surrendered beings to god prayer warriors that can pray faith that can stand on the world and believe it the bible says be careful for nothing looking for rugged men and women that are not ashamed of the gospel that god can brag on you pray that that's the character that received these things the three hebrew children we will not what bow okay who you are who are you king that can destroy this flesh no no no no i fear the one that can destroy this and the soul you get it now glory when you surrender your complete being then the holy ghost just passed through you in these virtues i like that how does it pour it pause through you in these virtues then you are a living tab knuckle then people look at and say that's a man full of virtue knowledge he believed the word temperance patience golden brotherly kindness full of the love of the holy ghost see there he is walking around what is it a statue that unbelievers can look at and say there is a christian unbelievers will say it your neighbor will say it your workplace they will say it that is a christian not a church praise him hallelujah oh you've never seen a kind of sweetheart oh glory be does that is amen what is it is torture that unbelievers can look and see there is a christian there is a man or a woman who knows what they are talking about you never seen a kinder sweeter godlier person you are sealed the life of god has come then into you see it still shows on both sides you can't be sealed on the inside it doesn't reflect on the outside when you are sealed on the inside it reflects on the outside listen you are what you eat i hear remain now you are what you eat if you don't eat balance diet it will show on your body if you eat balance that it will show on your body so the seal is both ways inside but has control over the outside when you walk what is on the inside is what is walking on the outside as a man thinketh in his heart so he is praise god hallelujah oh glory be to the living god hallelujah there's a man who knows what they are talking about he still shows on both sides whether you are going or coming you see they're still just the same there you are when a man or a woman possess this then the capstone comes down then charity comes down the life the literal life of jesus comes down the power of god comes down dynamics comes down then the capstone comes down and seals them into the kingdom of god which is the holy ghost no more argument you don't need to say i am sealed no it shows on the outside oh brother when you cannot love love takes over man ah when you have a very bitter heart sweetness take over man you are transformed from what you used to be into the life of the world you get it now oh glory to god then the word coming from here manifests itself through each one of these beings and makes this complete being a top knuckle of the living god a walking living example of christianity what christ was these people are because his life is in here they are in christ and their life is dead and hid in christ through god and sealed in there by the holy ghost no longer your life your life is hid in christ and sealed in there by the holy ghost oh first corinthians 12 that's right you reckon yourself dead then you are born of faith then virtue and these other things is added to you till you are a perfect living image of god oh church don't you want this hallelujah musicians come up with abraham hallelujah so ephesians 4 30 says give not the holy ghost of god whereby you are sealed after these things are in you you may be seated then you are sealed he said grieve not that holy ghost whereby you are sealed unto the day of your redemption now some of you baptists want to go to eternal security now if you will come on to that stage i will stand with you is eternal security if you will come to that place so the only way you are eternally secure for the rapture is when charity there seals you up the preacher same way song leader same way yeah church woman same way young girl same way young brother same way marrying today same way married 40 years same way holy ghost capstone must seal your life it's not for the preacher to come to adoption adoption is for sons and daughters of god or which the preacher is the son and the daughter i mean it's the son of god too you get it now see that and god said but and god has adopted you and sealed you by the holy ghost into his kingdom then there is no getting out of it when you are sealed by the holy ghost you will not even have the taste to think of backsliding but when you are grafted in oh you can easily go back to that life that is in your branch do you get it now they will preach no revelation you can connect to the revel to the source ah you get it now and god has adopted you and sealed you by the holy ghost into his kingdom then there is no getting out of it you are eternally secure believe grieve not the holy ghost of god whereby you and all your godly virtues you and all these things your godly virtues are sealed onto the day of redemption god's life is also then in you jesus said amen i am the vine and you are the branches now look what was the first with jesus they are first with jesus because he was a man making himself god and you deity is not in heaven it's in you the world will not understand a bunch of new bodies huh but deity in you of course see he was a man making himself god he was god he was god in christ he told them he said and look don't look at me it is not me it is my father and he dwells in me see now they was looking at that little body that was born of mary see that was in god that was the son of god but god was in that body it was god he said if i do not the works of my father then condemn me but which of you can condemn me of sin and believe of the word which word has god spoken that hasn't been fulfilled in me sin is unbelief so we must believe if we don't believe then we are in sin sin is unbelievable you get it now which of you can accuse me of sin sin is unbelievable show me if i do know the ways of my father then don't believe me because if i do the works though you can't believe me believe the works that i do for they testify otherwise the father is in me testifying of himself cause god was in christ reconciling the world to himself you get it now oh brother said well the same life that is in the vine is also in the branch how are you going to join in you can't join into the church you've got to be born into the church so in closing are you enjoying it are you blessed so far praise god in closing now this messenger of malachi 4 and revelation 10 7 is going to do two things one according to malachi 4 he will tend the hearts of the children to the fathers two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals it will be this divinely divinely revealed missing truth that literally turned the heart of the children to the pentecostal fathers exactly so revealed mystery truths our heart can only be ten when these things divine revealed mystery truths are literally in us then they would turn our hearts back to the fate of the fathers you get it now so the brother said might be closer than you think it is it got me scared oh i haven't done enough my calling and election i haven't done enough these things must be there to prepare me for the rapture this being when it is complete is that being that is going into the rapture i haven't done enough where are we at time shall be no more he announces that time is over what happens what happens could that be so now brethren seriously think if it is then the pyramid is capped by the seven thunders the capstone is the seventh thunders the headstone christ is the seventh thunders seriously think if that be so then the pyramid is cupped by the seven thunders i'm a seventh under believer has the cops don't capture a pyramid of your life it's not seven thunder just saying it but he must confirm it by capping you when these things are there and abound i gotta me now but it is the capstone what did he do the holy spirit capped off the individual and sealed it when we added to our faith righteousness goodness and faith and so forth and kept adding till we get seven things and the seventh one was love which is god that is how he makes the individual and cups him and seals him with the holy spirit then if that be so he has got seven church ages that he has seven mysteries that have been sounded away and they fought for to bring back we've got to fight to bring back the faith that was restored by malachi 4. they fought to bring back praise god oh hallelujah and now the headstone comes to cap off the church does the thunders mean that my brethren says is that what we are here at is that where we we are at you get it now praise him hallelujah oh you get it now oh my everybody say there you are there is the body of christ living standing redeemed justified in his side we were we are justified we are his victory the church is his victory we comfort in this last days with this glorious gospel showing his victory he died for these purpose christ died for you and i to have these things in us he died for these peoples we are proof of his victory amen when we see him coming down the headstock and living among the church that is his victory when we see the capstone come down cement these virtues in us that is christ victory you get it now oh the word and then the word moves on down into the body from the head what is it the same word nothing can be added or taken from it nothing can be added or taken these things must be there it's not sunday cook rice and beans and everybody eat and they are happy and you have rarely kindness forget that one the muslims do ya rayara every time kill bullocks and share free meat that's not what we're talking about charity though you know all mystery knowledge to understand every mystery without charity the cup stood useless praise god oh there is the body of christ living standing redeemed praise god we are his victory when we see him coming down and living among the church that is his victory shows that he couldn't keep him in the grave neither can they keep us nothing can keep us we are already potentially a reason because we raised from the dead and believe in his word from denominational creed to eternal word of the eternal god which is him himself working through us manifesting himself that he's the same yesterday today
