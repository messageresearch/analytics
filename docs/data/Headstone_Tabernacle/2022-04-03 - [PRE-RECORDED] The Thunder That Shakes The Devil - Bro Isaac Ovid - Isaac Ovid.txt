in here this morning feels real good in here this morning thank you brother stephen thank you musicians there's a sweet spirit in this place this morning and i know it's the holy spirit i know it's the angel of the lord and if the angel is here and if you are here then what are you worried about what are you scared about fear not it's gonna be all right well i greet you this morning in the precious name of jesus christ it is certainly good to be back home in fellowship at the church i feel at home amen after the nigeria convention and then i went on to germany for a meeting that they had over there and last sunday i wasn't here physically but i was connected to the internet by the internet to the live stream so i was just as much in service as you were and i know we had a tremendous time last week how many appreciate but over his message last week [Music] amen so on behalf of brother charles akachube and the believers from enugu nigeria and the many countries and churches and pastors and ministers i greet you on their behalf also from the believers in germany and france who gathered for the special youth meeting in germany we really had a tremendous time and i could truly see that all over the world the spirit is moving you may be seated so i'm going to close off this session billy branham and the message the spoken word is the original seed he said god never placed signs ahead of his word let me say that again god never placed signs ahead of his word they were added for proof of the word but the word is fist can the church say man so i don't want to see anybody running around caught up on the signs we want to make sure that the word is first we want to make sure our lives are in order with the world because that's what god is coming to see he's not coming to find out how much you know about what time the blood moon is going to be he wants to know when i see the blood i'm going to pass over you that's the blood i want to talk about i don't want to talk about the blood moon but when i see the blood i'm going to pass over you because before the judgment before this world is destroyed all of this is going to happen but god is going to have a people he is gonna have a bride it might be a handful of people it might be five people it might be ten people listen this is not for everybody you don't hear me this morning this gospel is not for everybody god wants it to be for everybody but through his foreknowledge he knew who would be here he knew who would stand he knew who would push back the works of darkness he knew can the church say amen so you are blessed this morning because you are predestinated to be here this morning and the devil the demon the no praise demon the backsliding demon the lost demon the selfishness demon the jealousy demon the envy demon we are serving every demon notice tell the devil you look at the signs but we are the cause this morning we are here to throw the devil out because we receive a kingdom that shall not be moved shall not be shaken shall not oh you don't hear me this morning you don't hear me this morning oh hallelujah the devil is in trouble i'm selling the devil notice he picked the wrong day he picked the wrong time this is the september the 27th let the world watch this time we are gonna watch our sign we are gonna be a sign a super sign a super church as we near the headstone we are gonna cause a revival can the church say amen oh you may be seated so let the devil laugh at you let the devil mock you let the devil tell you you're wasting your time they laughed at noah they mocked at noah they told noah you're wasting your time but there came a day that god shut the door could this sign be gone about to shut the door we don't know but let the world laugh let your family laugh let your neighbors laughter but as for me and my house i'm gonna serve the lord i don't need another sign we already have our time malachi 4 he already came as a sign to us that there is a new land that is oh glory you may be seated jesus he told the disciples you could tell the days and the season and the time but i'm right here and you didn't even see that i'm among you you don't even recognize that the message you're talking about has been made flesh up has been made a reality and one of these days this message we talked about this message we preached about this message we testified about it's gonna be made flesh i'm not here to have church this morning i'm tired of church i don't want to have church this morning i come for revival i come for reality i comfort or break truth i came to give the devil a boot out of the church out of my life oh hallelujah oh glory glory hallelujah hallelujah oh we shall be changed we shall be changed you need to say it you need to speak it i'm going to be filled you need to testify it you need to speak it the devil can tell you shut up but the moment you say the devil is in trouble he is trembling this morning because brother branham taught us the moment we realize who we are the devil is finished but i believe this morning somewhere in trinidad there's a little group a group of believers hallelujah another people in another land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age this world is gonna shake this church is gonna shake this nation is gonna shake your family is gonna shake your cancer it's gonna shape your diabetes it's gonna shake your female condition it's gonna shake everything that can be shaken will be shaken oh hallelujah fire fire holy ghost fire who said we gotta have a normal service this morning who said we gotta do it the same way this morning we want to be led by the spirit directed by the spirit that's what the house of hell is afraid of because we have a revelation of who we are and if we are in god's will and if he is here then you are free already and who the son of man set free come on young brother come on young sister oh somebody preach back to me forget about your passive forget about your mistakes forget about i'm not talking to your pastor i'm not talking to your flesh i'm not talking to your mistakes but there's a seed inside of your soul you didn't put it there but god placed it there before you made a mistake before you were even born you had representation by predestination you were there where was thou when i laid the foundation of the earth and the morning star shouted i was there you were there maybe you forgot about it but god has not forgotten about it abraham has not forgotten about him david has not forgotten about it they are waiting on us to come to perfection we are going to have a perfect church we are going to have a super church hallelujah hallelujah take it easy brother isaac take it easy but isaac you can't stop me now i'm just getting started i'm just warming up i've seen the devil do too much damage but today today today the 27th of september we are going to draw our swords do you have your sword this morning did you come for battle this morning did you come to push back every demon every doubt every fear and be ready to receive the holy ghost because that is your promise of you shall receive power after the holy ghost comes upon you and it's here it's here he's all over you you shall be sealed oh glory glory glory i don't know what's going to happen and you don't know what's going to happen so don't listen you may be seated this is not like an airline i'm not going to tell you to buckle your seat belts and store your tray tables i heard enough of that flying here this morning i say unbuckle the seat belt you don't need no seat belt i don't want you too comfortable this morning because this ship is going to do all kinds of stuff this morning this plane is going to do all kinds of stuff this morning but we are covered this morning by the blood we are wrapped up in his arms it was his love preserved you you couldn't even come to church this morning unless god called you so young brother hang in there young sister hanging there you are gonna make it you are gonna overcome you are gonna hallelujah [Music] hey man so are you ready for the word this morning oh you thought we started no we didn't start yet let's turn to our feet before we read the scripture let's just sing one song whoa lord send the power right now [Music] right now and [Music] right now i'm singing i'm baptized [Music] right now singing everyone in the blood [Music] the world can't take it away can we give the lord a shout of praise oh hallelujah hallelujah glory amen thank you musicians if you have your bibles this morning would you turn with me to two portions of scripture reading from the book of hagai in the old testament about two books before the book of malachi and the book of hebrews amen he guy chapter 2 and reading from verse 6 and hebrews 12 reading from verse 25 starting with higgai 2. for thus saith the lord of hosts yet once it is a little while and i will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land and i will shake all nations and the desire of all nations shall come and i will fill this house with glory sear the lord of hosts the silver is mine and the goal is mine say the lord of hosts the glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former say the lord of hosts and in this place will i give peace saith the lord of hosts are reading from hebrews chapter 12 and reading from verse 25 hebrews 12 and verse 25 see that you refuse not him that speak it for if we escape not hurry if they escape not to refuse him that speak on earth much more shall we shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven whose voice then shook the earth but now he hath promised saying yet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more signified the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our god is a consuming fire may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word can we bow our heads once more heavenly father we thank you for your presence your love and your grace that you extended to us this morning lord now may you give unction to speak to your people lord may you use me this morning as a weapon against the works of darkness lord the enemy has attacked lord for seven church ages but as we come to the closing pages of this final chapter before this book is closed lord lord god may you move through the house may you move on the internet lord may you touch each one that's here this morning under the sound of my voice and may the holy spirit lord arrest every heart lord may you touch your people and may you walk out the pages of the bible and bring a reality to this gospel in the precious name of jesus christ and the church says amen you may be seated this morning so i have a title this morning and for quite some time i've wanted to speak in this subject and i don't believe i'll have all the time this morning to bring justice to it but i'm depending completely on god to breathe life upon it but it's taken from one time the prophet made a statement and i believe more than ever that statement is so relevant today and my title is the thunder that shakes the devil that's my title this morning the thunder that shakes the devil and my subject the unfailing realities of the living god and for inspiration the manifestation of the life of christ so as we said at the beginning we want to be very focused this morning because you come to realize as you go through life you are either getting closer to god or further from god and it is imperative that you maintain the focus on what is important in your life too often we spend times focusing on what is not important and the script to be read speak about a shaking that's coming and everything that can be shaken will be shaken but all the stuff that has no sound foundation is going to be destroyed and only what is eternal will last so it means your job is going to shake your house is going to shake your family it's going to shake your money it's going to shake your everything that is natural that is man-made that is handmade that is for the here and now it's going to be destroyed but with this shaking this final shaking only the things that are eternal that cannot be shaken is what is going to remain and that's what we want to focus on this morning the things that are eternal but before we leave this place god is going to raise up a people to give the devil the final knockout punch and by their lives their lived voices their testimony the sermons that they will preach brought in and out the pulpit will be but the branham said the thunder that shakes the devil so before you leave here your testimony is going to be one of shaking the devil shaking the devil in your house shaking the devil on your job shaking the devil on your school shaking the devil in your neighborhood you are going to have a testimony just like enoch had a testimony that before he leave this place he pleased god and you will also have a testimony before you leave this place that you please god you cannot leave this place unless you have that kind of a testimony somebody say man [Applause] oh glory glory glory glory glory so we had a wonderful time in digo martin on wednesday night and we were speaking on have you received the holy ghost since you believed and we were talking about you as an individual not the person next to you not the person behind you but have you received the holy ghost since you believe because god has a promise of something for you and without it you can go anywhere because he said you shall receive power after the holy ghost comes upon you so there's a prophecy and there's another prophecy there's a prophecy of you receiving the holy ghost and it's a prophecy of power coming with that holy ghost and that power is power to pray but the random said its power to overcome its power to speak its power to live a holy life its power to forgive its power to have a testimony and the church same am and you are going to have power oh somebody say man and that's why the devil is so afraid of the holy ghost he's not afraid of you coming to church he's not afraid of you shouting he's unafraid of you singing he's not even afraid of you praying too much but when the power comes up then the devil has a reason to be scared because the same signs and the same wonders that's your promise god never promised you to be a good church member and to have a good church seat and for people to know you in church know your promise is the same signs the same wonders the same miracles and most importantly the same life when people see you they must see jesus when they see you they must see the messiah somebody say man glory to god hallelujah i'm excited because we are coming into bride material we are getting into bride condition and we have a responsibility to make a church to make a revival that's not the pastor's responsibility that's not the minister's responsibility that's not the elder's responsibility it is our responsibility so god is going to turn the heat up in the church seven times hotter because there are some church members in here he wants to filter out there are some make believers in here that he wants to get out so that only true believers the ephesians church is only made up of true believers so god is going to begin to shake the church oh you don't hear me this morning he's going to be going to shake the church he's going to shake the church he's going to shake the world and anything that doesn't have a foundation it's finished but that's how god is going to know who are his children because those that are eternal do the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh i'll see god though ten thousand fall on one side i shall not be moved why there's an eternal gene inside of your soul that no matter what happens you're still standing you have no money you're still standing you're still sick but you're still standing knowing fully well that there's a prophecy over you that you shall be healed you're not delivered but there's a prophecy over you you shall be delivered but god has shaken this morning he is shaking everything around you glory to god somebody say man oh hallelujah hallelujah oh glory glory glory glory glory oh hallelujah oh glory glory glory hallelujah you may be seated i want to read that scripture one more time i'm going somewhere this morning hebrews 12 see that you refuse not him that speak it in other words there's somebody speaking but don't make the mistake and refusing him because what he's speaking is the word of god and paul is writing and he said for if they did not escape who refused him that speak on the earth when jesus was here they rejected him they refused him he said much more we shall not escape if we turn away from him who's speaking from heaven and there's a voice that's still speaking from heaven and there's a voice that spoke from heaven on books and tapes you don't reject that now but that voice paul is saying once shook the earth when that voice came down on the pyramid on the mountain on mount sinai the earth trembled the earth shook and god speaking and the people say listen don't let god speak let moses speak because god's voice is a thunder when god speaks the rocks begin to tremble when god speaks the sky begins to shake when god speaks the animals know who's talking because that is el ella elohim that is jehovah jireh that is the king of kings it's the lord of lords it's the priest the pins of peace is the lord god mighty in battle and when he speaks everything knows it's messed up because he is god all by himself and the brother branham taught us one day this world will hear once more from god it will be that same god speaking but it will be true of pride it's going to be through you can the church say man you may be seated i know you don't feel like it i know sometimes you wonder why am i still going why i'm still fighting why i'm still pressing on and you gotta take that word you out of it you gotta take the word i out of it because you are not even the believer but abraham taught us the word in you is the believer so you haven't been coming to church you haven't been reading books you haven't even been praying but the word inside of you that seed inside of you is fighting pressing its way out there's another life in you and there's a war going on but one of these days that life is predestinated to come forth and that's why we come to church that's why we come to church to create a right atmosphere for that word cedar to come alive so we are watering the sea this morning with our worship we are watering the sea this morning with our praises that's why when the praises go up the glory could come down so we are creating an atmosphere this morning for the miraculous to take place and make no mistake about it it's going to take place somebody's amen hallelujah oh glory hallelujah hallelujah wherefore we receiving a kingdom that cannot be moved governments will move nations will move armies will move currencies will move sickness will move but the kingdom that we are receiving will not be moved your neighbors will move earthquakes will take place some tornadoes will take place up but if you are in that kingdom you don't need to worry about it no weapon formed against you could prosper because you are from a different kingdom you don't need a passport for this kingdom it's a heavenly kingdom you are citizen of that kingdom your dna is from that kingdom nobody can kick you out of that kingdom and by one spirit up you are baptized into that body by one spirit you are made a member of that kingdom can the church say amen glory hallelujah you may be seated and below it touching this last week and i want to touch it on on it briefly so that just we keep focused because the bible tells us in ephesians that we are predestinated onto being in the message for many years we are predestinated to come to church and just be like other people in the message no my bible tells me we are predestinated unto adoption [Music] and brother branham many times he gave the illustration and he talked about how you'd be born into a family but being born into the family the father can trust you with his business he can't trust you to run it because you don't know anything about running it not because your father is a businessman means you inherit the attributes of just being a businessman it has to be tested and proven that you could in fact do a good job in the natural and i said this on wednesday night in the natural many businessmen left businesses for their children and they spent 10 15 20 40 years to build it and in two years the children destroyed it because they didn't have the character for leadership they didn't go through the sacrifice and the pain that the father went through to build the business so god is not going to trust this great kingdom to any rascal any miserable any miscreant in discipline [Applause] so in the old testament when the son is born he was placed under the care of tutors and governors and their responsibility was to teach watch and monitor and to keep giving those report cards back to the father after the first term a plus after the second term a plus after the third term a plus and the father would look down and say i'm pleased that my boy is performing every single year in school he's doing well and eventually the father can say come and he brings him to the public and he gives him a robe and he gives him a ring and he says here he him his signature is just as good as my signature if he says you are hired you are hired if you said you are fired pack your backs as fast as possible because he has my name in him he has my authority in him no wonder god could tell peter whatever you buying on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loosen it will be loosed in heaven that was speaking of a people that will come into power that will be just like him that demon of sickness has got to go there's come at a time you won't even need the minister or the elder to lay hands there's gonna be power in you he will speak to your sickness he will speak to your family and you will see power move through you that's what's prophesied to you somebody save him [Applause] oh hallelujah hallelujah listen to what the prophet said in the message everlasting life and how to receive it is there anybody here wants to receive everlasting life i don't believe you came all this way to have church to just be a church member we are here because we want to have everlasting life alive beyond the river a life beyond this existence you know i shared with them in germany it was a youth oriented meeting and i said this is for the young people and those that through their walk with christ are getting younger every day hallelujah so i always rephrase but the kangaroo how i say these things about the young people and the caleb but now as a young people and those who by virtue of their walk with christ are getting younger every day my hair might be going but i'm getting younger i might be getting gray but i'm getting younger because i'm walking with christ and my destination is not the grave my destination is a resurrection my destination is the rapture and one of these days this body is going to be changed you may be seated i know it sounds crazy i know it sounds far-fetched but that's not my problem that's not your problem how is it going to happen he is going to work it out we don't need to know the mechanics but he is the dynamics and one of these days we shall be changed one of these days we shall be healed we just gotta say it speak it believe it plead for it declare it worship god because of it can the church say amen [Applause] hallelujah my i said indigo martin we have had enough of taking the milk bottles and eating the the the juba but anthony knows eating those gerbil food for babies and stuff it's time to get some strong meat people want to come to church and let's hear nice stuff but god is saying i'm going to put some fire on you because our god is a consuming fire and that fire is for a specific reason is to burn all the parts of you that's not supposed to be there off of you and i want god to burn me this morning you need to speak for yourself but i'm here this morning and i'm preaching to myself lord cut cut everything out of me that's not supposed to be here burn burn the world burn the ambition burn it out on me why so that that life of christ could be made visible somebody say man in the message everlasting life and how to receive it brother branham said now when the pentecostal church and these people in the last days here that's beginning to find a new birth being born again they thought listen they thought that settled it and that's a problem with many people the thing that come with the church it's settled being in the message it's settled believe in a thunder it's settled and brother branham said no sir because your ups and downs and ins and outs and things like that god can't place you as a son in other words right now you have your ups and downs one day on fire so much fire they can't even sit down put them with you sit down next to you yeah you're a all by yourself you just on fire and two sun is on the road you didn't you need to put somebody next to you who have fire because you had a hard week you had a rough time you had a bad dream you wake up on the wrong side of the bed your wrong foot on the bed your foot on your wrong shoes your shoes on your own but that up and down is temporary there's coming a time when you're gonna have a permanence of character where it's not a soul it's not you putting on your christian outfit let me put on the christian outfit today this is not that anymore but this is you living something all the time it's no longer an effort because it's a habit it's a way of life because it's not on the inside it's not a pretending a lot of people pretend they don't like you but how are you doing how are you doing i feel like a boy if you only need no one it's it's not real it's not real but you know there's some people who are genuine they just love everybody they're kind to everybody i want you to be real you know if you're a veteran everybody be sex with everybody because jesus told all your hypocrites you only love your people you only love your friend and you only love your friend and everybody can do that anybody can do that this is my circle but over the top of what it might click this in my group but be real and live this thing for real and that's why brother branham preaching the message the living realities of the living god the unfeeling realities of the living god we are looking for a reality not to be in church and you're struggling and struggling there has to come a time that the struggle must become easier because you're getting stronger because you're praying more and you're reading more and you're in the spirit more you can be past writing the same exam you're still in standard one you're still understanding the one you're still in standard one and you have form five form six degree until adoption every year you're supposed to say in last year was different this year the devil i'm coming for you last year i was running for him but they say i'm running towards him because why i know who i am i know where i come from i know where i'm going and i'm gonna give the devil a run for his money a run for his time he messed up lassie and took my prayer life but this year i'm taking it back i'm praying in the morning i'm praying in the noon time i'm praying in the evening [Applause] he may be seated you know that's what makes it a thunder that shakes the devil when you do what the devil don't expect because the devil thinks he has you figured out you know because he's looking at your resume this is where you were before this is where you were before this is where you were before but the devil god isn't going to resume me he is booking the flight based on where i'm going he is god is focused on your destination the devil is only focusing your past because he can't see your future the devil can only talk about what he did he can't talk about anything else but a kangaroo because he can't see your future but he is the author and the finisher he knows the end and he knows the beginning the devil doesn't know the end of your story and that's enough of a reason to shout to worship because oh hallelujah so we were reading here in the message everlasting life and how to receive it your ups and downs and ins and outs and things like that god can't place you as a son but listen carefully but when you stay in the kingdom stay in the gospel stay right one of these days god will call you out and set you aside adopt you as his son before the people and give you something that will shake the nations with it so this shaking that's coming you mean god's gonna use a people to do the shaking that's where i'm going this morning yes the bible said there's a shaking coming but god has an instrument for the shaking god has some weapons of mass destruction and that's why i pray this morning lord use me as your weapon against the works of darkness because abraham wished he could have been here david wished he could have been here but we are here and we have the responsibility to finish the war that started in heaven is going to end here on the earth because we shall reign on the earth can the church say amen from a message expectation but the men said i'm looking for something aren't you are you looking for something this morning but the of my soul is stimulated to the highest just before the coming of the lord jesus to see something happen that's going to shake the gentile world before god leaves it in the message of hidden life in christ he says no we don't have to get some kind of a makeup some kind of emotional or mental makeup we don't have to take something the devil would hand down but every believer that comes listen carefully friends and this is where many of us miss it every believer that comes from the altar to the consecrated life to the baptism of the holy ghost can get not only a mouthful but a soulful of the original baptism of the holy ghost that fell on the day of pentecost that'll bring the same results as it did on the day of pentecost so what are you looking for but isaac i'm looking for the same results that they had on the day of pentecost that god could take a bunch of men with no education with no schooling but they could have a certain kind of result and brother benjamin if the holy ghost comes upon you you're going to have the same results that they had [Applause] for the promise is unto you and to your children and to your children's children to them that are far off even as many as our lord our god shall call bridging the same holy spirit that fell on the day of pentecost that brought them results then will bring the same results to every believer tonight that's willing to consecrate their life to enter into the holiest of holies by the blood of the lord jesus can the church say amen he said it'll break down traditions it'll change men's hearts it'll melt you into one person in christ jesus sent an old-fashioned sweeping revival across this country amen what we need today we need an old-fashioned god sent heaven bought holy ghost brought revival not just a little bitty shaken up or a little emotional workout but an old-fashioned dying out self-consecrating hallelujah backwoods sky blue sin killing religion is that how you feel this morning but the branham said it won't whitewash you it'll wash you white the devil will whitewash everything that he can but god washes white and that's what we need today is an old-fashioned god-send revival that will just break down the hearts of the people and bring all these denominations into one great big unified group of the glory of god that's what the church needs today and but ibrahim is speaking there with a consecrated condition a consecrated life and i shared this in germany and i shared it in diego martin on wednesday everybody knows what a butterfly is and i want you to imagine if a butterfly were to land right on your hand and if a butterfly lands right on your hand and you want that butterfly to stay there you have to act a certain way because if you just move too quickly the butterfly is going to do what it's going to fly away and but the branham typed the holy ghost as a dove and he said we must be lambs we must be gentle so that the dove the holy spirit could rest on the lamb now i want you to listen carefully the holy spirit is a gentleman he's not going to force you to do anything he's not going to force you to come to church he's not going to force you to pay your tithes he's not going to force you to worship he's not going to force you to be on fire he's a gentleman and you have to conduct yourself a certain way for that dove to rest on your shoulder and to stay there because many times in our lives by the nights the dove would come but we do many things and the dove would fly away that's why the bible says grieve not the holy spirit that's don't offend the holy spirit so that dove he wants to not just be with you he wants to be in you but we have to be very careful how we live so now at home i tell my wife be careful we don't want the dove to fly away and it's powerful because if you live your life that way suddenly what you see begins to change who you spend time begins to chain because that dove can't go anywhere at once too that dove could only go to certain places so if that dove you want that dove to stay there with you then you have to speak to your wife a certain way speak to your children a certain way you have to do certain things because the moment you act that dove will fly away friends that's the consecrated life that god is looking for and if you practice that presence of god that's what real christianity is about and that's where brother branham talked about the thunder that shakes the devil's kingdom because it's easy for you to lose control and get upset and argue and debate but we want that dove that presence to be with us all the time remember the brandon was facing a bull he said a love came over him he said i wish i would have it all the time and if the prophet of god would be so just because he felt something. when you come to service the holy spirit the word comes in such a way to cut things off of your life and for many of us as the closest we get to a doubt because when we go to work and we go to school and we do this we quickly get out of spirit you get up in the morning and you go to work and you don't pray the dove can't dwell on that kind of person but if you wake up in the morning and you begin to worship and you're going to thank god and you welcome the holy spirit then the dove he just sweeps down and he rests there with a shame and when you walk at your house you see how great thou art and when the woman walk in the street you turn away your eye oh the top he loves that mind and when they're talking bad in the office and you turn away from them the dove he loves that he's having a good day because you are in the presence of god and when you turn in your jaw and you pray for your food or dove he loves that and and when there's a call for a prayer meet him and you can't wait to come to the prayer meet him oh the dove he loves that and when your brother calls you names and you say i forgive you oh the dove he loves that because if you speak back against your brother the dog is going to fly away you may be cheated oh that's a real message right there by the matthew to keep that dove resting on your shoulder when you among your co-workers that's the real gospel a lot of people know scriptures there no quotes they listen to tapes but the holy ghost is not with them it's an intellectual conception of the message but we are talking about the holy ghost moving from the presence of the holy ghost to the holy ghost on the inside and to that fate you're adding virtual knowledge so we're going back to basics this morning about getting our lives consecrated because the wesleyan church was so consecrated the holy ghost wanted to pour out on them and they didn't even know what to do with it because they were consecrated but we must be gentle like the lamb so that the dove would come gently like a lamb with your children going to keep saying it because it has to register because god is coming for a perfect church you think the dog is pleased when you're not in church but the brandon said you could go ahead and miss work but don't you miss church because everything that can be shaken will be shaken what are you gonna answer god well lord i miss the rapture because i was working overtime you have to make a choice of what's important because the dove he wants to deal with you but the brandon said god wants to fill you with the holy ghost more than you even want to receive it but so many things we do every day we just push the holy ghost away from us with the magazines that we read and what we watch on the internet and how we spend our time but i could guarantee you one thing when you get on your knees brother stephen and you begin to pray and you begin to call upon god a dove he draws narrow he draws narrow as you begin to cut off the things from the world he draws nearer and in every age there was a virtue for each age as you live the virtue for the age the dove he loves that and this age is the age of what is forgiveness to the dove he is looking for forgiveness and god will make you prove it and brother branham said the devil will make you prove it so every situation every test is to see forgive forgive and the more you forgive the more the dove comes and you know deeper than that jesus said how could the father even forgive you if you don't forgive because when you hold somebody else god is saying when i'm holding you until you let them go that's the real gospel that's the thunder that shakes the devil and that is what the devil is afraid of we can have a thousand people in here shouting and jumping and saying god send a prophet and people holding oats they're holding grudges they're playing around in shady places spending time with people who are pulling you away from god men spending time with women who are not their wives spending time inappropriately doing all kind of foolishness and you want the dove to go away oh yeah we don't need the signs on the outside we are speaking about the signs in the church to have that life that lived voice but the brandon said i have to quote i don't forget to read it not everybody is called to be a preacher but he said live your sermon that's the real message when you live the sermon anybody could speak it but when you live it it's a real testimony peter got home his wife didn't cook he didn't break up the pot and bust up the house no he went upstairs and praying god spoke to him the dog just swept in oh god give us husbands who want the dove to be on their shoulder give us wives who want the dove to be in their shoulder give us children who want the dove to be in his shoulder young men you think the dog will rest on you when you're wearing those short skirts you're trying to cut your hair and put your makeup on and your eyeliner and whatever it is the moment you even touch it flies away because he can't deal with that he's looking for a sanctified life looking for a holy life looking for a default life a life that separates from the world that's why he's a lamb brother branham types it too because the bulls and the goats and the other animals they do what they want but the lamb the lamb wants to be led the lamb wants to be protected by the shepherd can the church say man is this resonating with anybody so for this week starting from this service everybody should be talking about the dove if it's one thing you take from this service and i love because i was talking about a colon brain and he said it's so difficult to keep the dove it's not easy it is so difficult brother anthony to keep that dove it is so easy to snap at somebody it is so easy to be driving on the road and you just get out the spirit it is so difficult for the kangaroo to keep that dog but that's what god wants us to do to keep the dove with us all the time when you listen to worldly music the dove cannot stay with you can't you send the dove away friends keep the dove [Applause] [Music] [Applause] god's word is unbreakable god has no respect to a person when a wife disrespects her husband the dove just puts on turbo fought gear just just speed away the dove the holy spirit by the random said only backs up the scripture husband loves your wife love your wife when the husband doesn't show that love the dove he flies away children obey your parents the dove loves to see the scripture become a living reality in your life can the church say man i'm gonna mess with a hidden life in christ but ibrahim said the reason we're not getting anywhere today is because we got too many dry eyed professions and you know why but ibrahim said dry eyed because he types it as compared to when there's a certain sincerity of your soul and the tears stream down because it really resonates down on the inside and it's a reality to you you don't care about what anybody else is doing it's you and god but we got too many dry eyed professions and church joinings lukewarm backslidden church members that's the truth we need more of the old-fashioned god-sent saint paul's revival and the bible holy ghost with power and breaking up listen to make people act different and look different walk different talk different and be different and live different in their every day lives so the battle is not this church and come with the church on sunday it's what happens on monday and what happens on tuesday and what happens on wednesday and what happens on thursday because the tutor he's monitoring your behavior can the church say amen but the brethren said we needed friends the methodists needed the baptists in the dependent course they needed they all need it we all need it can the church say amen and that's what the holy ghost is given for but they brought him in the message what the holy ghost was given for he said it's to quit making you smoke and drink and one to be a big shot that's real you know want to be somebody it'll take that out of you it'll humble you when you do that that's what the holy ghost for listen it's for a holy life that's right make you quit gossiping make you quit playing cards shooting crafts and all these other things that you do around the corner it'll make you quit you're carrying on the way you're doing living untruth to your wife that's what it'll do that's right it'll quit making you want to marry somebody else's wife that's exactly right that's what it is it's to make you live a holy life that's what the holy ghost is powerful to set your affections on things above where god stands at the mind of christ in you you can't help from seeing those things when you look at them you tell in your head that's right it's to make you do that i remember the brand i'm saying and this to me is so powerful he said you say i can do it oh just i can do it sure you can't and i love that but everybody say you can do it you can't live this life but the holy spirit come for that purpose oh my god [Music] with ibraheem say your natural ability you can live this life but that's what the holy ghost comes for to give you power to live this holy life can the church say man [Music] holy ghost comes to burn the world out you burn your old nature some people go and meditate on the mountain for five years they'll talk to anybody and they believe they have the life in control see no evil hear no evil speak no evil but that nature is still there when they come up the mountain they start to deal with these same temptations back in the city when they come back because there's been no conversion no transformation no new birth no new experience because we all born in sin shaped in iniquity nobody better than anybody else but when you experience that new birth and you are born into the kingdom your affections begin to change listen you're not where you're supposed to be yet but you're not where you used to be but now you are born into the family no you can begin to add to your faith virtue knowledge temperance you rock a bit you move a bit but seven birds seven deaths and then charity comes down and seals the whole thing and then you are new creature you walk different you talk different you don't know where you get the strength from but all of a sudden you can testify like the prophet something came over me i don't know what it was but it's the holy ghost i don't know who started it but it's the holy ghost and fire and it's keeping me alive [Applause] to god friends god wants to get the glory and he wants to get the honor and he wants to get the praises so it cannot be your strength it cannot be your ability he said not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayeth the lord brother branham said if we are ever to see the power of god manifest it will be by the grace of almighty god it wouldn't even be our efforts all we have to do is be consecrated be sanctified and god will do the rest and that's what we are crying for lord clean up the church lord shake the church lord get our hearts in order lord we want to be gentle so that that dove that the holy spirit could rest upon my life and one day move on the inside and the pillar of fire could be filled on the inside that's how i want to be total surrender total surrender total surrender not part surrender but complete surrender lord i surrender everything surrender my eyes surrender my lips surrender my ears surrender my mind surrender my feet surrender my hands i don't want my hands to do what it wants i don't want my feet to do what it wants i don't want my mind to do what it wants i don't want to hear the wrong thing i don't want to say the wrong thing oh i surrender my emotions i surrender my pride i surrender it all up i give it up to you if i need to repent i repent if i need to forgive i forgive if i need to love i love but i want to be completely surrendered up so that that dove he could dwell with me all the time is that your prayer this morning is that your desire this morning is that your prayer this morning oh hallelujah oh glory glory glory glory glory glory so but the banner said you say i can do it oh i just can't do it sure you can't but the holy spirit come for that purpose that's why the devil fights the holy ghost so much because the holy ghost comes to give you power to overcome the holy ghost gives you power to live the life that you want to live deep down in the end time but you need something more than just your strength you need something more than your ability with your ability you're up one day your tongue one day you read one day you read the other day you pray one day but when the holy ghost comes up it's a different experience it's a reconnection it's a vertical connection it's you and god and no man bring the connection and no man could cut the connection because you are part of the body and like what the prince said when he preached here some weeks ago no matter what part of the body you are you are part of the body you could be weak but you are in the body wherever the body goes you are going to go to somebody say man can we give the lord a shout of praise [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah this is not the kind of shot for joy master but it's a really sobering message hallelujah now when i on the phone i want to begin to talk to brothers and sisters are you keeping the dove are you keeping the dove do you have your dove i said to my wife the other day i say you can let your dove go i'm trying to keep mine off but it's a way of always now remembering that it's a walk with christ and that walk with christ is a walk that's on display in front of people because your neighbors are watching you your co-workers are watching you your family is watching you and that's why brother branham said it's so important to live your sermon because your life is preaching something i was doing a house education yesterday and i was saying that many times we pray for things and we look for things and god is waiting on us to get our lies in order to bring all the pieces back together we want to come back together and we try and struggle with our own abilities and all god is waiting for is to put him first put him in his place put him on the throne of our hearts put him in the control tower and say lord wherever you lead i'm going to follow and that's what this real walk is about that's what christianity is about total surrender you have your ambitions your dreams your goals but is it line up with what god wants for your life many of the desires we have that's just what they are our desires but he also has desires and you have to make sure that you are following his desires can the church say amen so friends are shaking is coming but i brought him in the message in his presence he said this is evangelism this is the time to shake people and that's what we're doing this morning with the kangaroo we are shaking the people this is the time that god said it come a time he shook mount sinai one time but it come shaking again he checked everything that could be moved but we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved everything that can be shook will be shaken the heavens will shake the earth will shake heaven and earth will pass away but that word will never pass away for upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell will never prevail against it can the church say amen so all through the old testament shakens came and shakens came and go and throw out all the time and now in the message revelation chapter four but the brand i'm saying this is the quote i got it from i just want to make sure you hear it now everybody can't be a preacher but you got a voice and if you can preach the people a sermon if you're a preacher you're called to the pulpit to preach if you're not you're still a preacher but live the people assuming let your sermon be lived and it's the voice of god that will bring reproach to them who reject it they see no one can put a finger on his or her life their sweet living if there ever was a man of god it's that man or that woman see live your sermons don't try to preach them if you're not called to be a preacher get all mixed up anyhow and messed up and you'll get people tangled up and you won't know well you'll ruin them and you'll sell to just live your sermon the preachers call to preach his and to live it too if you can't live it then stop preaching it but you're supposed to live your sermons all right here was voices oh this is a quote here how we need in jeffersonville thousands of live voices the thunder of god thundering out in sweetness and holiness purity undefiled lives walking around in the earth today without a blemish yes sir real christians that's thunder against the enemy the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't care how much he can jump how much he can do this or shout but what's hurts the devil is to see that sanctified holy life consecrated to god say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on oh my that throws him away that's the thunder that shakes the devil can the church say amen [Applause] friends the devil has a response for scripture but the brandon said the devil knows the scripture better than better than we do know the scripture he's been around for a long time so when you argue scripture with the devil the devil could allow you scripture back the devil has a response to the quotes but you see the devil has no response to the life because he can't live this life but we could live this life the devil has no answer when you present the life when all the world expects you to hold the order and you drop it the devil has no response he can't deal with that that's the thunder that shakes the devil when people do you wrong and you can let it go that's you presenting the life of christ [Applause] could you imagine jesus didn't do anybody anything but they spit on him they mocked him they laughed at him they beat him they say you call yourself a king and jesus did what he didn't answer them a word he didn't argue with them he didn't say hey it wasn't me i didn't do it no because he was standing in the gap for us that we could have that opportunity this morning so we are here on this earth to shake the devil before the final knockout punch and your life your testimony is already shaking the devil even before you have the fullness of the life you are already shaking the devil because when you're supposed to be backslidden you are here this morning and the devil is already shaken that's a thunder that's already shaking the devil you're supposed to be sad but you're shaking the devil this morning because there's still a smile on your face you're supposed to be dead defeated depressed but you are here in the house of god that's already shaking the devil shaking the devil's kingdom every time you do the unexpected it's shaking the devil and satan is mad but i'm so glad this morning he lost a sinner that he thought he had and all my sins are under the blood and i've been redeemed and i'm getting out of this place i'm leaving this world behind goodbye world good morning glory i don't want to be so tied up with the world i can't wait to leave this place i can't wait to get out of this place but before i leave here i'm taking my family back i'm taking my children back i'm taking it back because it doesn't belong to the devil it belongs to me it belongs to me and my house i'm part of the kingdom we are taking back the young people we are taking back our loved ones we are taking back our healing i'm taking back my hair my walk my talk because i'm leaving this place oh you may be seated when moses was leaving egypt pharaoh said listen take everything take your cattle take your sheep take your toys take the goats but just go because your god is too powerful and there's going to be another exodus and the devil after that knuckle punch he said take it just go just get out of here and we're gonna leave this place brother we're gonna have a meeting in the air there's gonna be a meeting in the air in the sweet sweet pie and pie i'm getting out of here you are getting out of here if you want to stay that's your choice but i want to get out of here the world can keep its tiles it can keep its fashion but i want to have that life seven live voices seven thunder was uttering out in sweetness and humility and forgiveness can the church say amen [Applause] [Music] oh hallelujah could you take some more this morning i'm almost finished but i feel we have a good audience this morning we came to church to fellowship around the world so we are fellowshipping around the world this morning all week you fellowship with your co-workers and your family and the news and ian allen and you fellowship with all these people but now we let's talk about jesus this morning the prince of peace the lord of lords but the brandon said when we talk about him he comes nearer he comes close up he loves when we talk about him let's talk about jesus oh the king of kings is he the lord of lord supreme [Applause] i hope you got time [Music] from the message the world is falling apart and by the brandon preachers in 1963 and look at the world today woodson has ever been murders crime killings but that's that's one thing but when you look at the young people and what's happening and stuff that you've never seen before in our day it was here before because the same spirit sodom is only the same spurs because brother brad i'm talking those spirits don't die but they wait for some vessels that open themselves up and now they have found these vessels and but the branham said many years ago he said when he used to blast the movies and the picture shows he said now the devil did a number and brought it into the house and the devil is looking for any weak spot and you have to fortify yourself as a christian with where your weak spot is but everybody said the devil is going to try to punch you in that weak spot he owes us everyone a punch so don't think you want to escape every single christian is going to have a punch coming to you and it's not going to come at your strong point he's going to look for the weak point and he's going to give you a good punch and you know what you're going to have to do you're going to have to close up all the weak points because when you put on the arm of the god full arm of god then no more weak points so he's going to probe and press and try but what is it it's you getting ready until one day he's going to say you know what i give up on you because you are you are already sealed away until a day your redemption he can't mess with you no more can the church say amen after jesus met the devil in the wilderness the devil went away for a season it was like time emotional he had no idea listen vicky i don't know who approved his vacation he took a vacation jesus said it is written it is written it is also written and jesus defeated the devil without power with just the word that's how powerful the word itself is it is written it is written is also and the devil went away for a season but the brandon said electric volts went to the devil and he's still recovering from that [Applause] can the church say amen what about us you may not have the holy ghost yet but you have the word don't you oh my my my my and the word will defeat the devil anytime any place under any condition so i'm not going to be too much longer with you but the brandon said friends we are not promised a system in the message the world is falling apart jesus wouldn't have nothing to do with a system we wasn't promised a system we will promise a kingdom and how do you get into it by one spirit we are all baptized into this kingdom is the kingdom of god a kingdom of eternal life with an eternal king giving forth his eternal word with an eternal people predestinated to eternal life he is the king we are baptized into it setting in heavenly glory we are dead our lives are hidden god through christ not only that but we are raised with him raise up what in a system a denomination organization no we are resurrected in the kingdom of god the kingdom of god is within you all these man-made systems must fall not once more i'll shake the world but i'll shake heaven also and those things that cannot be shook is what will remain and we receive a kingdom a kingdom that cannot be shook or moved that's the kingdom of god not a system not a political will not a denomination but a kingdom can the church say amen all these other things are falling apart america is falling apart europe is falling apart asia is falling apart all the world is falling apart but we are in a kingdom an eternal kingdom it cannot be moved amen living in the presence of the king don't have to guess about it it's the truth god's truth god's complete truth oh how i love him for this how good he is can the church say amen [Applause] oh in a message perfect strained by perfect weakness but the brown said oh god strategy god has a strategy is to take empty human vessels and shake the world with them oh like at pentecost can we have another pentecost are there some empty vessels that god could take and pour himself into it and shake the world with it can the church say amen in the message speak to this mountain but abram said i believe that the church of the living god is moving into a sphere now that is going to shake the whole world up who is god going to use he's going to use some sons and some daughters who have consecrated themselves this world is going to shake friends you don't have to be part of the sheikhan you could be part of the shaker i want to be part of the shake-up because if i'm part of him then nothing can move me but the shaking is coming oh glory glory glory glory glory glory oh he said it's gonna come to pass pretty soon i'm looking for it to happen in this meeting that was in 1959 but sirs is this the time on september 27th could it be that now is the time and it's about to happen that the bride will be an invincible marching army the sick will be healed by the word up the blind will see the death will hear the dead will be raised up we're going to have a revival sirs is this the time he said i believe it's gonna strike the church of god soon and it's gonna start a revival that'll shake the world i believe it do you believe in this morning a revival to shake the world up are you desperate for revival are you looking for a revival are you looking for your inheritance are you looking for your promise up are you under expectation then if you are under expectation let's make preparations and how do you prepare you worship god that's you getting ready you read the word you're in service you are prayed up you are devout you are consecrated because you know anything now the holy ghost itself that mighty dove will drop down in your life of sirs is this the time for that thunder to shake the devil's kingdom once more the world will hear direct from god it's going to thunder it's going to shake them everything is going to shake this island is going to shake oh hallelujah los angeles is going to shake the president is going to shake the prime minister is going to shake they're not going to have an answer they're not going to know what's going on but the pride will have an answer the pride will have a response the bride will have the word the bride will have the third poem when they say it famine and pestilence you'll be able to speak let there be let there be now when we need it the spirit will raise a standard when the press come watch the third pearl denim you'll need to speak for your needs whatever you have need of you speak it let there be let there be that's your prophecy that's your promise that's the power that's coming to the church oh glory hallelujah you may be seated but it's not for everybody many people will hear it the bible said this gospel must be preached and then the end will come so there'll be some preachers who will come dedicated consecrated and people will hear them but a few will act upon it many will go their ways noah preached for years people heard him he was like an entertainment he was like a show people would come to hear this man but you know what was about noah noah wasn't just preaching he was living his sermon because while he was preaching he was building the arkham and that was a thunder it was shaking the devil the devil didn't know what to expect noah wasn't just talking about it when noah say repent he was building and today we say repent and we are building because we are leaving this place up we are getting out of here noah in his day he could say the rain is coming we in our day can see the shaking is coming the fire is coming this world is going to be destroyed heaven is going to be changed can the church say man oh hallelujah heaven and earth will pass away i don't know if i'm going to get it but in the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly pride but apron said heaven and earth will pass away he said that past doesn't mean annihilated but the georgia doesn't mean destroyed he said that past means change it means from one form to another because this heaven and this earth it got corrupted because of the god of this evil age back in eden the devil came into god's kingdom and he caused a shake in god's kingdom he interrupted the order that god had set up and eden shook her something went out of order there was chaos in god's eden and god fouled from that day i'm gonna restore everything that was lost up man was supposed to have dominion man was supposed to have power you're not supposed to be sick you're not supposed to be depressed you're not supposed to have questions because you are supposed to be the answer you were supposed to have power but man fell and the devil came and shook the kingdom that god built but god said i'm going to raise up people through every age that will shake every age up to bring back to bring back order in the church to bring order back into the world can the church say amen oh you may be seated so in every age god had a voice because he said the voice of god is a thunder so in every age god had a thunder in every age he had a voice he had somebody who would speak but during the old testament they could only speak because they had blood of bulls and goats so their words were word of god but they were still speaking of somebody to come they were speaking of that great thunder to come they were speaking of that great voice to come oh you don't hear me this morning so abraham spoke and david spoke ezekiel spoke and isaiah spoke that a virgin would conceive and there was a thunder that went out that shook the devil the devil tried to understand it but it didn't make sense to him how a virgin could conceive but that's how god is it was a thunder that went out to shake the devil's kingdom and 400 years had to pass but one day that thunder that word became flesh and jesus he came and walked up and he was a living reality of the word that was spoken and his life was a thunder where he went he didn't have to speak up but the sick was healed and the blind saw oh you don't hear me this morning that's the kind of gospel hallelujah hallelujah i'm finished with the introduction i'm finished with the foundation now let's preach you may be seated so god in the beginning he said let there be the most powerful attribute of god is when that voice moves adam was in the eden he said i heard the voice of god walking in the garden that voice had a feet that voice had hands that voice had a party and in this age the voice of god will have feat his voice will have hands his voice will have a body that body will beat his pride buddy oh you don't hear me this morning and once more this voice will speak lazarus i know you're dead but comfortable it'll be the voice of the archangel fill in the pride [Applause] oh hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated so paul in his age he was a thunder a thunder in his age he shook his age his age trembled even peter trembled because paul was just different paul wasn't from their church paul wasn't from their group paul wasn't there when jesus was there paul didn't hear jesus himself but he had the voice of god and when paul spoke the dispensation changed from the jews to the gentiles and god unlocked something secret because there were some people in 2015 who had to come forth and god had to make a turn to pull up the gentiles and paul irenaeus martin columba luther wesley each age had its thunder each age had his voice each age had his virtue but now but now we have every thunder we have every voice every virtue has been restored by that malachi 4 elijah prophet [Applause] oh you don't hear me this morning you don't hear me this morning in paul's age he said death where's your grave where's your victory death where's your sting he said listen because the mighty conqueror had passed the devil was trembling paul spoke and challenged it challenged the grave but he still had to go down because he didn't have what it took to give the final knockout punch he could have shook the devil but there was a rail shaking that could have only happened in 2015 the first church real trouble the devil but there was a church that was to come that was to finish the devil there's a difference between a problem and there's a difference with being a solution oh hallelujah you may be seated so the devil had trouble in the first church age he had trouble in the second childhood he had trouble in the third fourth fifth sixties and in the darkest age in the age where the prophet said the moon till into darkness as a sign of no light in the evening time day in 1964 there was a super blood moon and the world was dark but he prophesied in the evening time there's going to be light in the evening time there'll be a people who will come to escape the devil the final shake and shake him out of the earth shake him out of this heaven shake him because we shall reign on the earth the devil has no right he has no power he has no authority the authority is in the church of the living god somebody say man [Music] oh hallelujah hallelujah oh somebody give god praise somebody give god a shout oh hallelujah seven living

of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride but abraham said heavens and earth will pass away many of us do that scripture but brother branham brings to light what it means he said now this word means passing from one form to another it doesn't mean annihilation as the english word would mean pass away it's annihilated but the hebrew word or the greek here doesn't mean pass away it means passing from one thing to another to pass from one condition oh god to another and that's my prayer this morning to move from the condition that i'm into another condition the state that i'm into another state the walk that i meant to another walk the talk that i meant to another talk the life amen to another life [Music] brother went on now notice paul used it if you want to read it now put it now you can read it later in titus paul is using the same word means regeneration of man that man has passed from a sinner to a saint not completely annihilated when a man is changed he isn't annihilated but he's a changed person he has been changed from what he was to what he is not annihilated oh anybody with me this morning brother branham said jesus used the same word in matthew 19 28. he said to them you'll set with me in my father's kingdom regenerate it you see change when you change use the same word he use the same word when he said to the court lose the court and let him go said the same thing at the resurrection of lazarus he said lose him listen carefully to the prophet lose him change him he's been tied let him go what does it mean the earth will be loosed from the grip of satan oh god help me this morning it will be loosed it'll be loose from politics it'll be loose from the nominational religious system to be used for the kingdom of god to be established here on the earth but the random now he's under the anointing he's speaking he said one time i was his property talking about the devil but not now one time that little woman talking to somebody in church was his property but not now see he come to loose the grip of it he'll lose the grip of sin of satan upon my life upon your life now we are not his how you often heard me say in prayer take your hands off of god's property see have faith to claim your own that's right take your hands off of him take your hands off of him this earth will change politics will change religions will change the kingdom of god shall be established can the church say man oh hallelujah oh brother branham says you're the same man in stature that you was when god called you the same woman but you see what it did it was a regeneration the whole life passed away the old desires has passed away when you used to like to drink and cuss and fuss and stew and run around and immoral that thing just died then you were satan's
