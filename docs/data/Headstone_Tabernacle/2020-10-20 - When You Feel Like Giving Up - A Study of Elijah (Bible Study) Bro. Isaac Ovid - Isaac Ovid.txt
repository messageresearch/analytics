presence and together in this way um it almost feels as if we've been doing this for a very very long time as you know we have taken his steps you know during his whole time of uncertainty to be certain of god so at this time let us just borrow our heads for word of prayer as we welcome his holy spirit and commit the study tonight into his hands gracious heavenly father we deem it a great privilege tonight lord to be able to gather in one mind and in one accord to get a word from you a word of encouragement from you to think that lord you would take your thoughts and you would put it in the form of the word law that at any time we can get a glimpse into the way you think the way you operate lord you spoke through your prophets and your apostles and your representatives through different dispensations lord about how you think and how you operate and you even went on to say for my thoughts are not your thoughts and neither are my ways your ways for the heavens i had on the earth so my thoughts are higher than your thoughts lord and father lord we are so drawn to be closer to you lord through the struggles of life and trying to make ends meet as it were trying to do what we need to do lord to lord to line up with your word for the hour lord to be ready to give an answer lord for this great message that you have placed in our hands lord it was not our desire lord that brought this to us but lord your love reached out to us lord the prophet said that the message would find its self in the hands of to be destinated and we lord we did nothing to deserve it there's there's not there's none of us that are worthy tonight but we thank you for your grace for your love for your lord your your your love that is so vast that lord you you you died and lord when you look through this blood that speaks better things for us you don't see our mistakes and our failures lord and father we are so grateful tonight that you are our healer you are our redeemer you are restorer lord you encourage us when lord we are down father and there are times when we are down there are times that we are in our valley there are times that we go through our different issues and father i don't know every issue here tonight but may tonight's teaching be lord a little different kind of teaching law that would really encourage your people lord and and and challenge them and and and help them to understand lord how you have operated true lord all of the ages we commit this study into your hands may you bless your people tonight in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen amen well we thank god uh for another time another another bible study and an opportunity for us to come together uh in this way and i was sharing with brother ovid and i had mentioned it to myself as well um this has been quite a journey uh through scripture and i trust that you have also taken this to heart and take time to reflect on what god has been doing for us and through us and um and i encourage you uh to if you have not done if you have but but but when you can you make the time to go back and listen uh to both the bible studies as well as these there's a lot of food there's a lot of things that are that are said that the holy spirit brings out that are not planned that are not scripted and when you go back and you look at it and you look at it again and you look at it again you see more and more and more you know so i want to encourage you uh let the word be your source of inspiration let the word be your guide uh let the word be your place of refuge you know so may the lord bless you tonight as we about to approach the text i uh i had originally um desired uh after last week uh to to pursue a direction in solomona proverbs and i still that will not be tonight i feel led to go back into uh the book of kings i want to kind of draw something there because i think there's so many things that are happening that i want to be able to by the grace of god get some encouragement for us um in there tonight so we're gonna find our reading very familiar scripture but i just want to take our time and uh and go through it again so we will be in first kings 18 tonight so i trust you have your bibles and uh we'll be in first kings 18 tonight you're going to touch on 18 and we're going to touch on 19 tonight is everybody here on me i don't know it looks as if my connection might be sticking at times but anthony are you hear me we hand you clearly isaiah okay all right great all right so we are in the book of uh first kings 18 and in the interest of time i'm not going to go back into 17 but uh chapter 17 of first kings is the introduction of elijah so i'm going to just quickly go through that because we really want to focus on the team but you know if you go back to the to chapter 17 it is when we see the introduction of elijah he comes out of out of nowhere there's no uh there's no history of him growing up we have new information about where he went to school we have new information about um how we lived all of a sudden elijah who was of the tishbi just comes out of nowhere and says as the lord god of israel live it before whom i stand there shall be not be there will be what you are in these years according to my word and that word of prophecy would have just hung over all of the land and we know that god would have guided him uh to the brook of cherith where he was to hide and god was going to feed him and take care of him and when the brook found the water disappeared because of the whole drought etcetera god sent him to the white officers arafat who took care of him there um her son was sick gravely died and and came back to life um and and we know at chapter 18 verse one and we're going to take our time and go to it we are really trying to to bring us to a spot here with this teaching and if i were to give this teaching a thought tonight it's it's when you feel like giving up that's it that's the title tonight when you feel like giving up a study of elijah all right so when you feel like giving up a study of elijah uh so first kings 18 and verse 1 and it came to pass after many days that the word of the lord came to elijah this is 18 verse 1 in the third year saying go show thyself unto ahab and i will send rain upon the earth and i want us to first notice here in 18 1 that the word of the lord came to elijah in the third year concerning this matter of the rin you know and uh when you read the prophet's message you will see that there's one time and i love the quote where brother branham said he hadn't seen the angel for six months and he saw the angel the angel just looked at him turned around and walked away you know because many times people create the impression and and ministers in particular are guilty of creating this this impression so to speak that god is speaking to them every day 24 7. um and the prophet never gave that he never suggested that he never presented that we find elijah here on this matter hadn't heard a direction on how to act on this for about three years so i want us to understand that there are periods of time in our christian journey when uh it will be as if you don't hear a word on a specific matter that you're going through but your fate in the word of promise is what keeps you going you know so i'm building into something here now you know so i want us to understand that god's silence does not mean his disapproval or even his approval because of god's sovereignty he could choose to speak or he could choose to be silent you know and many times it is a case of us creating expectations and a big part of this teaching tonight is about managing our expectations uh the only way you could ever be disappointed is when an expectation is not met and many times we create false expectations of situations of people around us and and and sometimes we may have the best expectations but they may just not be the right expectations and i want us to understand that distinction between what we can control and what we cannot control all right so we are building here so so and it came to the past after many days that the word of the lord came to elijah in the third year so three years have passed and he's now getting a direction from the lord on it saying go show yourself unto ahab and i will send rain upon the earth verse 2 and elijah went to show himself unto ahab and there was a sore famine in samaria now i want us to understand the context here this whole situation of famine and all this is out of god's displeasure in the rulership and leadership of ahab uh at the end of verse 16 we would see that ahab had a unique distinction of being named the worst king that israel would have ever seen that as bad as those who were before he was able to break the world record and be much worse and his choice of his wife was his decision that was counted as his worst decision because he married a wife who was a idolater idol worshipper who introduced baal and ashira and when if you recall our study of jehu and nebot the bible directly said that jezebel was directly responsible for the issues in ahab's life all right so i want us to understand as we're building this this is the backdrop as we're going here right so so verse two and elijah went to show himself unto ahab and there was a sore famine in samaria and ahab called obadiah which was the governor of his house so ahab called obadiah which was the governor of his house now obadiah feared the lord greatly so i first let let's let's let's continue verse 4 for it was so that when jezebel cut off the prophets of the lord that obadiah took 100 prophets and hid them by 50 in a cave and fed them with bread and water and i find it very interesting because many times we we brush through these scriptures and we don't really slow down to really process it here it is the worst king the very worst king of israel has ever seen that god is completely upset with that has introduced idol worshipper the idol worship his right hand man so to speak the governor of his house is actually a believer i wanted to see this for a second the governor of his house is actually a believer whose understanding of the word and scripture is such that he is like a secret agent in ahab's house we understand that god operates that way he is placed there but what i find is noble is that even though he is in ahab's house he hasn't lost his values he hasn't lost his compass he hasn't lost what he knows to be the truth because he as governor of ahab's house understand the position now understand the role he feels understand his access to what ahab would say and what jezebel would speak about understand that he may have been first to hear about the attack that would come to all of the prophets and yet he is in that position of leadership in an environment that is not ideal necessarily for a believer so to speak he makes a decision to go against what his quote-unquote master would want for the sake of his testimony his belief and of the prophetic class of that day so i want us to notice that many times we find ourselves in situations be it a job be it whatever it is where decisions will have to be made things will be taking place and it takes wisdom wisdom to know how to operate in that particular situation the most important point being here is that there's nothing to suggest that obadiah was being corrupted by what ahab was doing so i want to challenge us because i believe in practical scripture all right i believe in in the simplicity of the word to impact our day-to-day life i remember telling young people there are so many jobs that exist it is important for you to find a place that doesn't compromise what you believe it is important for you to be in a place that doesn't compromise because your blessings will not come from compromised situations you have to manage your relations you know you need to manage who you spend time with so here it was we don't know what situation led to obadiah being here but obadiah has has ended up in a position as a christian having a testimony in so much that he is operating that he has trust from ahab all right so verse 5 and ahab said unto obadiah go into the land unto all fountains of water and onto all brooks per adventure which means perhaps or or by chance we may find grass to save the horses and mules that we lose not all the peace so from this we see that the famine is so severe or so famine as the scripture said that the animals were beginning to die and ahab's concern for the animals was let us go and hunt and see if we find land let's find some place so that we could save some of the animals so verse 6 so they divided the land between them to pass throughout it ahab went one way by himself and obadiah went another way by himself that speaks of trust all right when you trust somebody you don't have to watch over their shoulder all the time so it means that ahab although obadiah was a secret agent for the lord under his care he was operating in such a way that ahab didn't have to worry what the agenda of obadiah would be because obadiah could have been left on his own i want us to just see these subtle messages here in scripture verse seven and as obadiah was in the way meaning in his journey behold elijah met him and he knew him in other words he recognized him and fell on his face and said ardou that my lord elijah so i want us to just build this because i'm going somewhere i don't want to spend too much time here because there were real places really we're trying to get to to to chapter 19 but i want i don't want to take it for granted that people have read this that people have studied this that people also understand this i rather take the time and go through it so that we could be grounded in this because when we speak of elijah friends remember we are in the days of elijah elijah as a prophet and the prophetic ministry of elijah is the only ministry that he could find repeated through scripture we have said it before elijah elisha as john the baptist as brother branham and then as elijah to the jews so the spirit of elijah the nature of elijah the operations of elijah is important for us to understand the spirit of the man because the spirit of elijah is what we are dealing with even to this day now okay so he said i doubt that my lord elijah verse 8 he answered him i am you know i am go tell thy lord behold elijah is here you know i just i just like that i i just like that statement because when you when you understand the context ahab was very aware that is elijah who has made this statement there'll be no due no rain until my word release it in other words i'm locking it up until i speak so the key to unlocking it was the word of elijah and i want to see the type true even our d the key to unlocking the rapture is the word of elijah the key to the adoption of the bride is the word of elijah the key to unlocking the the rain the lottery and the spiritual the dynamics is the word of elijah so the prophet would say rapture and faith is laying in your message so right now things are still locked up waiting for the word of elijah come on now to be handled by some sons all right because he said it's there somebody gonna pick it up all right okay so go tell thy lord behold elijah say that is i call that bad man talk because ahab has been looking for elijah and elijah's saying elijah is here all right so you have to look no more i reach all right and listen listen to obadiah's response all right verse nine and he said what have i what have i sinned in other words what have i done what did i do all right that dogwood has deliver thy servant into the hand of ahab to slay me in other words what have i done i was having a good day i was listening to my master looking for water what have i done that you come to set it up that ahab killed me and he goes on verse 10 as the lord as the lord thy god live it there is no nation or kingdom i want us to understand the level that ahab went to as the lord thy god live it there is no nation or kingdom whether my lord had not sent to seek thee in other words the known world as it were ahab had put a word to find elijah it was god's instruction that led elijah to go and hide so as the lord thy god liver there is no nation no nation no kingdom whether by lord had not sent a sigi and when they said in other words when they said he is not there he took an oath of the kingdom and nation that they found did not so he just take their word for it he make them swear put their life on the line that elijah is not here now verse 11 and now thou sayest go tell thy lord be holy elijah is here all right 12 listen to verse 12 and it shall come to pass this is obadiah's assessment of his individual and it shall come to pass as soon as i am gone from thee that the spirit of the lord shall carry thee with her i know not and so when i come and tell ahab and he cannot find thee he will slay me but i thy servant fear the lord from my youth so obadiah is petrified he's had to plead his own case because he know the lord working with elijah he know with elijah everything could happen there's enough and the interesting thing is between verse verse 17 and 18 there is no explanation so to speak of the power of the minister of elijah really outside of the world and the declaration so it's not as if they would have seen it like just zipping back and forth so it means that obadiah is a true believer and you understand if god is with this man anything is possible right verse 13 this is where obadiah had to pull out illegal documents now was it not told my lord what i did when jezebel slew the prophets of the lord how i hid a hundred men of the lord's prophets by 50 in a cave and fed them with bread and water in other words don't kill me this is why you i don't know where to kill me this is why i don't want to go and talk to ahab i don't want to deal with the situation and now thou sayest go tell thy lord behold elijah is here and he shall slay me and elijah said as the lord of hosts liveth before whom i stand i will surely show myself unto him today all right so so this put the matter to rest in obadiah's mind and heart you say listen i am it's important i'm on a commission i am operating on the instructions all right so i want and we'll see it later on in chapter 19 this journey that elijah is taking to deal with what he's about to handle is scripture i want to use the term scripted by the lord in other words elijah is following a playbook you know we really bible says the steps of the righteous are ordered by god so elijah is walking in ordered steps he is not making this up he is not operating here on his own choosing now he is operating as god told him in other words when the lord told him to go and find ahab god would have told him this is what you're going to do when you meet ahab this is how you're going to operate and we'll seek confirmation of that later on so verse 16 so obadiah went to meet ahab and told him and ahab went to meet elijah and it came to pass when ahab saw elijah that ahab said unto him ad thou he that troublet israel you see now what is the trouble that elijah doing elijah only trying to get people back to god in him that's all elijah's motive his objective his desire his burden his interest is to get people connected back to god and that's what we are doing here tonight to get people connected back to god not connected to a church not connected to a group but to a relationship with god and that is the desire that elijah's operating with friends and he answered listen to his answer to elijah's answer in verse 18 and he answered i have not troubled israel but thou and thy father's house in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the lord and thou has followed bailism now therefore send and gather to me all israel unto mount carmel and the prophets of bell 450 and the prophets of the groves and i taught on this in a prayer prayer teaching this grove is ashira ashira is the female deity so in other words israel had gotten so corrupt that it was 450 priests who were serving the mailed idol bill and and another 400 which was serving ashira the female of the growth which eat at jezebel stable so jezebel herself as a female what has been almost like a priestess of the grove all right so israel it was just horrible you have 850 priests 458 for bail and 400 for shiro verse 20 so ahab sent unto all the children of israel and gather the prophets together onto mount carmel i'm building here now and elijah came unto all the people and i would have taught this before and said how long hold ye between two opinions and i think i did a teaching just on this this issue here how long will you halt or they would have limp or move between two opinions if the lord be god follow him but if baal then follow him and the people answered him not a word and in processing it i'm wondering these people make no mistake about it they know their history it is one thing we know about the children of israel the tribe of judah the people of god they knew their history because up to even when jesus came he was able to make references to the queen of sheba he was able to make references of what would have been passed down by oral tradition what would have been passed down via scrolls so here it is they are being confronted with this one man called elijah on the one side and you have 850 people who grew up among them people who grew up hearing about moses and abraham and for some reason they have lost their compass and the people are witnesses of this thing and elijah's challenging them how long will you haul between two opinions what this means friends is that the people were actively on one day living a certain way because it is not that they were totally sold out of bailism i want us to get it this this point here it is not that they were completely convinced to follow bill the reality is that people were swinging back and forth one when it was convenient for them they would serve god the god of their fathers when it was convenient for them they would follow the old way but when it's convenient for them they would follow realism and it's a crisis today because we see it in the church we see it in homes we see it in families and it's manifested visibly and it's manifested invisibly so i want to challenge destiny as we pursue this because this is the pain i call it the opinion of elijah elijah is now expressing the inner anguish in him because he is seeing what is in front of him that these people are caught between two masters they are caught between servant god and the things of the world the court being serving righteousness and serving the chaos that is out there i want us to nail this down because if we don't see this and we just take it it is another study and are we just trying to think i want us to look at ourselves here friends and then elijah then said elijah until the people i even i only remain a prophet of the lord but bears prophets are 450 men let them therefore give us two bullocks and let them choose one block for themselves in other words elijah for this whole part that we're going through here is laying out the sequence of events because brother branham would say that this particular situation here was was one of the greatest ever in history in spiritual history let them therefore give us two bullocks let them choose in other words i don't want them to accuse me of having anything to do with this let them choose one bullet for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on wood and put no fire under and i will dress the other bullock and lay it on wood and put no fire on them i don't know who here ever caught up an animal anybody ever cut about animal a whole are you talking about no chicken here i end up going oh no cut up chicken it's easy to get them chicken i remember being young and i was staying in miara i think dad may have went to nigeria or something and i was staying in miaro and i think we're a jew or so and some somehow i end up somewhere in mafikin and they were killing pigs for christmas or something and it was about three four guys trying to do this whole operation and cutting our animal up a big animal is working on cutting a a a a call up you ever see the size of a call you know the equipment they would have had back then so i want to paint a picture of we read through this and i want to see the human side of it as well i'm not sure i haven't studied it out exactly how old elijah was at this point in time but here it is i want you to see this scenario you have 450 priests priests quotation mark please who could decide among themselves who cutting what part up and how they're cutting it because it's plenty of them many hands make light working or whatever so they for them is light work and here's this lone man of god i want you to see this scenario on the one hand they take in turns they have a roster they have a rotation who got to know the leg who's gonna decide and on the other hand there's this one man elijah i want to say fighting up with his bullock i wanted to see the picture now of how the odds are against elijah oh nobody the people not saying a word so there's nobody defending elijah i wanted to see the context no i wanted to see the burden of an elijah that he has to be committed to what he's doing he can't flick he can't fall apart he can't look at the many hands doing on the other side and say oh gosh i wish i had help anybody with me tonight if anybody wants to come and he in other words like gideon chasing the enemy the mission and the finishing of the mission and the objective of the mission is the only thing that matters and elijah has to be focused i want you just to slowly tape down and to see your real life scenario how sometimes you have things to do and is you alone you have no help the people who you hope to help you not showing up and your quote-unquote competition or what you're facing off against looks as if when one man tired is the next man to replace him is the next man to replace him and you they still saw in one leg over the bullock you have finished saw one leg yet and they're cutting up they're dividing they attacking i want to see the picture now and i will dress the other bullock and lay it on wood and put no fire under verse 24 and call thee on the name of your gods and i will call on the name of the lord and the god that answer it by fire let him be god and all the people answered and said it is well spoken story people finally find their voice in other words this thing making sense this is pure logic so the people say well this thing making sense no because if the both sides doing this and if there's fire and and all that is happening then at least whoever wins this thing we can support it so elijah wasn't picking for them as well he was saying you make a choice you're halting between two opinions i will stop that i want you to decide so they say well yes we are willing to decide so understand this elijah is not doing this because he feel in alberto would say jewish or you're feeling kurdish or you want to he is doing this because he wants to see a change in the people elijah is not doing this for attention i want us to understand it he's not doing this because he wants recognition he's not doing this because he wants us to be talking about it tonight he's doing it because he's burdened by the bailism by the sin that is infiltrating the people of god who should be operating a certain way verse 25 and elijah said unto the prophets of baal choose you one bullock for yourselves and dressed at first for ye are many in other words he's here he's plenty earlier so elijah we see elijah that he's pretty much elijah here has a level of i i want to use the word carefully a level of sarcasm elijah has a level of confidence in his operation in other words he said olivia i gave it only a head start because it's plenty earlier i love it i love it i love it and that's the confidence you have to have in your position so so it's all earlier take a head start now it's me alone i don't need the answer all right so look at the operation of elijah here right for you many and call on the name of your gods but put no fire under verse 26 and they took the bullock which was given them and they dressed it and called i want us to process this now friends are trying to get where i'm going but i have to slow down here because this here is solid solid solid solid teaching and they took the bullock which was given them and they dressed it and called on the name of bell from morning even until noon brothers and sisters in other words for six hours they pray when last you pray for six hours no are pushing a push in here they're dead wrong but you can't tell them they're not convicted enough they this is not this is not all of the word this is not the cd very elective is possible this is way off the path this is you're already bought you're in the deep you're drunken and never let's do six hours talk about commitment so so i want us to dig here it means that people can be committed for the wrong thing people could be so convinced of the wrong thing that they're willing to do six hours so you see that why i want to get this why sincerity is not a measure of of your standing in god that commitment these are qualities that need to be directed i want to make the point clear because there are people who are committed to the wrong thing they're sincere about the wrong thing they have their belief of how things should be and things should operate and they don't see themselves in it and they measure and and i see it in in in in business all the time there's a difference between activity and productivity you're working working working working working and at the end of the day all you have is activity there's no productivity you they're filing your moving fire from here to here and then from back from here whole day moving the file file fire fight that's activity what's the value to the organization of moving the fire from one cupboard to the next government if anybody tell you say well i moved the 582 million times this week this year i weighed it what did that do to the business that is activity not productivity can we go a little a little deeper trying to try to to to this thing i see this thing really this thing is this thing is is is i sing it as if i'm there right now right so call on the name of bad from morning until noon saying oh by hear us i want us to understand these people who praying this is this is serious in them but there was no voice no any that answered and they leaped upon the altar which was made in other words they escalate they went from walking around the altar to going on top the altar in other words more commitment more effort more energy if you didn't think i believed before now you see i believe you see why people are jumping up and down until impressment because nowaday now they really in the spirit can we push further and it came to pass that at noon that elijah mocked them so elijah gave them six hours and then started elijah mugged them and said cry aloud i like it elijah air tried to dissuade him no he say listen relation turn up the volume my recommendation i hear watching earlier for six hours now and i think well it should increase the volume the whoever set up the amplifier system did not do a good job it is 450 or earlier and all you need to elevate this activity i want you listen and i want you to see the picture it's not just elijah and the prophets and the priests and eminem you have the whole of israel saying i want you to read the context so this here is the biggest event in years it's like a stadium the whole of israel is there watching this look as a crazy person on the one hand and this whole activity this whole long show going on right cry aloud for he is a god either and elijah to give them the options to explain to them in other words and you ever meet people who try to justify or explain sharpness so elijah started to explain the shoppiness to them so they started to process their own trippiness he said for he's a god either he is talking so because he is talking you need to raise your voice to get his attention or he is pursuing he running on something or he is in a journey or per adventure he sleep it and must be awakened and they cried aloud and listen listen and this is why when you meet people who who committed about the wrong thing there's very little you could do to convince them because under the pressure of the situation they take it down next level listen and they cut themselves after their manner in other words them fellas start to do blood sacrifice typically priests religious order does be in some kind of white garb so i want you to see the picture 450 jokers no bleeding because in a mess is a whole this is a horrible horrible horrible sight and yet still eternal israel they're still not convinced that this thing looked insane by the time we're done here everybody will know their story very well till the blood gushed out you know what the word gosh is mean and he says i mean gushing out upon them but brother clarence them fellas was this surely the level of commitment they had to this madness in them you see that's why i say sometimes you say a word to the wise insufficient it means that when you speak to somebody who is wise just the word alone is sufficient you know but you see it to the full and we're supposed to get into people and deal with fools you could tell them what kind of words you can't stop shopping that's when people are doing nonsense you know they reach a point that blood gushing is this midday is after the sun people hot verse 29 and it came to pass when midday was passed and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that there was neither voice nor any to answer no any that regarded listen to verse 30 and this is a powerful lesson here and elijah said unto all the people come near unto me in other words if elijah didn't make the statement them fellas is elijah put an end to the foolishness because them fellas was going to continue their level of commitment to their nonsense was going to continue you know as saying it's triggered i wanted to understand that people could be committed to the wrong thing i also want you to understand how stubborn they were in their belief that they did not give up that day did not stop they didn't come to our realization that this is not working for us that's a very dangerous place to be when you're doing an action or an activity that bears no fruit and you don't realize that this course of action is not working albert einstein said the definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different result so elijah verse 30 said and elijah said unto all the people come near unto me and all the people came near unto him and he repealed the altar of the lord that was broken down and to get context jezebel would have ordered the breaking down and the destruction of the altars that were established so this is elijah i call it elijah's peen and his anguish and and and how he is processing things so the first thing you do you do it he restore the altar and that's a whole long message of himself and people misappropriate this but he restores the altar in other words if i have to do this thing it needs to be the right way it has to be done in the right approach we can't just offer sacrifice to the lord in any way we want to these altars were established for a reason the covenants between god and his church has been established for a reason the way we do certain things have been established for a reason we can't get back to where we're supposed to be if we don't establish the foundational basics and principles that god requires that's why everybody brandon preach a message approach to god there has to be an approach to god a way to reach him a way to get his attention come to church say amen 31 look how the lookout is being built and elijah took 12 stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of jacob in other words he taken them all the way back to the foundation and we are trying to go all the way back to the day of pentecost all the way back to the alpha church all the way back to the power that was there because that needs to be here for us to go where we need to go next can the church say amen and elijah took 12 stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of jacob unto whom the word of the lord came saying israel shall be thy name and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the lord and he made a trench about the altar in other words he he this is i want us to catch still friends elijah don't have help up to no we see no mention of somebody even even in jesus day they took the cross they want to take the cross over jesus and put it on somebody else elijah has no help anybody with me so he just cut about animal and now the bible says and and he made a trench about the altar in other words he dig a hole you know what has his to dig a trench no slow down when last you dig a trench i remember being a young boy helping build a church fighting up trying to dig ending i thinking how this man elijah was able to physically build do all this a body altar as great as what contained two measures of seed so the bible says it wasn't a small trench he put effort into it and he put verse 33 he put the word in order i like that in order you would in order is your prayer life in order is your bible study in order is your home in order is your work in order are your conversations in order is your behavior in order is your sacrifice in order are you living in order is there order in your life the christian walk is a walk of order it was because there was no order god said let there be light to start to bring order out of chaos the foundation of scripture is bringing order out of chaos if your life is in chaos you need to get older all right so he put the wood in order and cut the bullock in pieces and laid him under wood and said fill four barrels with water and pour it on the burn sacrifice and on the wood so he poured water on it that's the first time verse 34 and he said do it the second time and they did it the second time and he said do it the third time and they did it the third time in other words what is elijah doing elijah wants to make sure a hundred percent sure that the people realize that the odds are against this thing lighten he want to make sure that no matches if you put that matches the material out he said put water put more water this in other words the people must say listen boy i want you to see the conversation because people know under expectation elijah said lady gauran answered by fire you imagine people turn to one another but you see much water you put there there's no way that thing will light you know she put more water yes we why we here now boy because this thing can never light third water well that is it we're done let me just go yes because this whole time that whole team doesn't feel already 415 at them they're just tired no i just want to put water put water i put i was fighting for him because the other ones feel that that's the reality and if it was god help us it was true any trinidad didn't make it and the water listen ran round about the altar and he filled the trench also with water so not just the the thing soaking now the trenching all through the water in other words the the perspective here is there's so much water that fire can't survive and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice in other words here he was timing it everything is in order the bullock is in order the altar is restored the odds are against us and he's waiting he is counting down he's counting now he's counting down and it came to pass at the time in other words when the time for the evening sacrifice supposed to be what that is when he now stepping into his position you see god has got that timing all right what's your time what you see in what's the hour i hope you're being blessed tonight and you're getting some inspiration from the word tonight and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that elijah the prophet you see the emphasis here we know we're talking realizing about even the scriptures elijah the prophet don't i don't make no mistake about who we talking about here elijah the prophet came near and said and this here now is the is the prayer of elijah i want to understand the prayer and i want to see the burden and what came out of it right came and said lord god of abraham you go back to the foundation isaac and of israel let it be known this day that thou art god in israel and that i am thy servant and that i have done all these things and i would so that first state member to clarence is him confirming that every action that has been taken up to this moment is the script i introduced it by saying he's reading from a playbook he's reading from a script he didn't decide what this journey was going to play out every single thing he's working on the instructions now this is where it gets interesting for us friends because every single man woman child of god has a right to ask you could ask god for things you can plead with god for things there are times god will tell you certain things and there are times that the desires of your heart if i ask any father in this room what are the desires for your children you will want the best for your children and if you go and pray you will pray that god give them the best you will pray for whatever is important to you you will pray for what you see as the important thing to pray for so i want to make a distinction in elijah's prayer at this junction because elijah said everything i've done thus far is according to the word but i want to switch over now to i want to call it the desire of elijah's heart in other words now we're entering into who elijah is as a man what he wants to see all right he said i've done these things as i would listen to his words in verse 37 very important hear me oh lord hear me that this that that this people may know no i want to slow down again hear me o lord hear me that is him that is a plea that's a cry he is when when he's repeating the words he is he is i want you to see him reaching out hear me oh lord hear me all right in other words lord i waited i wanted to pass by here in this situation i want to get your attention on this matter here that this people listen listen to his prayer may know that dog at the lord god and listen to the prayer and that though has turned their heart back again and i've read this so many times and but albert picked it up as well the desire of elijah was to have the people's heart turned back and this here is the desire that comes within the spirit of elijah and we would have spoken about the spirit of elijah because coming to the end of this whole journey we will see again where god told elijah to anoint elisha and to anoint jehu and we would see in our study of jehu that although god told elijah he was really speaking as it was in the spirit of elijah because elijah was not the one to anoint jehu the instruction to elijah went through elijah even through a son of the prophet to unknowing jehu so i want to type now that this desire that elijah had at this point to turn back doesn't it sound like when we read malachi 4 because this is elijah's desire but then we see god in malacca i say behold i will send you elijah to turn the hearts back anybody with me tonight so elijah is connecting to the the magnitude of the great ministry of elijah he doesn't know how everything will play oh he doesn't know everything but he knows that hearts have to be turned back come on now he knows there has to be a reconciliation with god he knows that people aren't where they're supposed to be and his ministry is connected to people getting back together with god we don't know if he would understand what would unfold in years to come and that they'll be elijah in our day whose whole ministry will be about turning the hearts back oh anybody with me tonight but he has a noble desire he has a noble prayer let us read this here then the fire of the lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench what level of fire does it take hallelujah to burn the sacrifice and burn the wood and burn stones you ever see stones burn anybody with me we threw anything down you ever see a stone basically this stone actually burnt that's the level of fire talking about and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench in other words there was no question there's no question that that is supernatural because natural could not have done this anybody with me and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces which is prostrate and they said the lord he is the god the lord he is the god and elijah said unto them take the prophets of baal let not one of them escape and they took them and elijah listen again brought them down to the broketion and sued them there i've done a lot i've done research on this thing there's nothing to suggest that elijah had help this is a monumental monumental physical feat to cut up a bullock dig a trench ladies holding out and elijah now in the spirit here killed one he had killed two he had killed three he said bring all so i don't know after 100 by thompson elijah more tired after he killed 200 i don't have anybody ever step up to help him but elijah is is clean in house as it were we're getting into what i really want to get into and may the lord bless this part of it here but abraham would have called this a great victory or to quote this exact word he used he said it was a red letter d for the prophet a red letter d and brother branham said he was tired and i wanted to see how how uh how this this this gonna and elijah verse 41 i wanted to pick up these certain things here and elijah said unto ahab get thee up eat and drink for there's a sound of the abundance of rain no i don't know how you feel but if my belief system has just crushed the bail i was worshiping the bill i led my people to follow because of my bad decision with my wife the whole system just crumbled all my priests dead and elijah says to ahab get up and eat if your world crumble you just have an appetite this is like your whole the religious side because in that day church and state was the same the kingdom and the priesthood and everything was wrapped together so if it is all my if i'm the king and i sit hungry and see all my priests there all the people who follow me asking see that the god that we abandon his real god and i am sitting and the prophet tell me go and eat if it was me b person i say well what's that really high eat right now you know my i believe you're generator really go and really process i still have to process what is happening because this year was huge like this is massive verse 42 and ahab went up to eat and drink you always know when something bothering you most people when something bothering you you lose appetite it's a human response if something goes wrong you say yeah eat nobody boy about something i stress it over something some people they have an appointment some people have job interview to go to and they don't want to eat because they're not nervous what this tells us right here is ahab was not moved by that whole thing normal normal no no lord able to see this thing that there was a test that abby self feel because if i was ahab my instinct would be well let me go and pray yes because i don't know if the for all them priests get killed i wonder if you like to kill me next boy let me go and at least pray for and repent because i don't know if elijah operating if god tell them kill a mix so elijah i appreciate the invitation to eater but let me go and pray and repent so i want you to see this small thing in scripture so ahab went up to eat and to drink and elijah look what elijah do elijah went up to the top of camel and he cast himself down upon the earth and put his face between his knees elijah is doing what ahab should have been doing this and elijah is still in a state he is seeing the spiritual side of this thing anybody with me i hope this kind of resonates with you verse 43 and he said to his servants go up now with seven look toward the sea and he went up and looked and said there is nothing and he said go again seven times powerful sometimes you look for something you see go and look again right now we're looking at this scripture again we have preached this many ways many times but i'm sure somebody i'm trust is seeing something in this they never saw before but it's because we are looking again and we look at it again and again and again until this is so real to us that we will not find ourselves doing things we should not be doing anymore because we understand what this whole means how it is all connected how god operates anybody with me verse 44 and it came to pass at the seventh time that he said behold they arise it a little cloud out of the sea like a man's hand that's why we sing a song i see i call it like a manson right and he said go up say unto ahab prepare thy chariot and get thee down that the rain stopped thee not verse 45 and it came to pass in the meanwhile that the heaven was black with clouds and wind and there was a great rain and ahab rode and went to jezreel you remember in our study of of of of of jehu jezreel was here all the action took place right listen to verse 46. elijah hasn't eaten elijah is exhausted he cut down the bullock he dig the trench he killed all the pre-sequel listen to verse 46 and the hand of the lord was on elijah and he girded up his loins and ran before ahab to the entrance of jezreel so i want you to see ahab is riding a chariot racing the jezreel and the hand of the lord i don't know how many young people have seen this before the hand of the lord came on elijah and he got to jezreel this is not translation like philip you know philip was translated in the ethiopian eunuch this is not translation this is making bolt look like he was walking because elijah tired hungry elijah with the anointing upon him i i want to see the horse in his face when they realized that was elijah just passed them because he is diversity and iran he ran so if you ever want to know the fastest race ever run in the world this is it right here because elijah outrun ahab's chariots and got to the the the entrance of jezreel before he have got there verse 19. can we take some more where is where is m m mccoy and we this thing is so richer but a clock this thing's so rich that we could go all night on this singer verse 19 let's read verse 19 and ahab told jezebel all that the lord had done to show them that he was god is that what you what what what do you see in there and ahab told jezebel about the miracle that took place at camel sorry sir verse 19 verse one and ahab told jezebel that fire from god came down this is the painful part of it because and you see ahab gone home and here talking about god here talking about fire here as far as he concerned the man who trouble it israel still causing problems you see how people can see signs whatever branham and preaching this say no matter how much miracle it take place no matter what preaching you take this there are people who will never see this thing anybody with me no matter how much of this thing comes alive and signs and wonders there people will never believe this thing and look at ahab ahab went home told jezebel all that elijah had done in other words he elijah's to blame and with all how he had slain holy prophet with his sword so here the testimony like there are people get talked on the phone and sometimes you'll compare stories and when he hear his story and i say them two people was in a meeting because i get two different stories ahab version of the story is elijah gave trouble and killed the priest that's what he tell you away from verse two then jezebel sent a messenger unto elijah now and this and i wanted to catch us now because if there was ever a display of the miraculous this was it camel was a miraculous display you can't question it everything was done in such a way that there's no question but look in the face and i want you to see this in the face of manifestation there will still be people who do not believe because look at ahab who he's not a hedon he marry one but he don't believe and jezebel clearly doesn't believe then jezebel sent a message unto elijah saying so let the gods do to me in other words my gods do to me and more also if i make not thy life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time in other words jezebel will say let my god punish me worse than the punishment elijah do if by tomorrow this time elijah are looking dead like them guys you see this spirit here you see what we're dealing with here yeah yeah yeah yeah and listen and when he saw that this is elijah that he arose and went for his life and came to beersheba which belonged to judah and left his servant there but he himself went a day's journey verse 4 into the wilderness and came and sat down under a juniper tree and he requested for himself that he might die and said it is enough now oh lord take away my life for i am not better than my father's and that's why i call this teaching tonight when you feel like giving up and but i brought him in preaching about this said he came from a great victory and it is not just about being tired after a victory or but even i'm talking about preachers after preaching it they have a rough time after preaching and while we understand all of that there's a deeper message in here because elijah a man who speaks for god heard from god has reached a point of such sadness such depression such frustration and it has gone beyond beyond feeling just sad it has almost reached a point of irrationality how can you say that buddhism because you don't run for your life he is running from jezebel to save his life then tell him god take it it's easy i want to die i want to live but them two things cannot exist simultaneously because if you wanted to die just go straight to jezebel but he runs from jezebel to save his life then they'll tell god take it in normal term guys there's something here clicking but i want us to understand that when we go through situations when you reach a point where you feel like giving up logic doesn't work it is important for us to understand how situations could spiral the reason that elijah got from low to lower to lower it started with fear fear drove him to save his life but when he slowed down and processed it it moved from fear to another set of emotions that end up being depression and brother branham said that elijah almost had a nervous breakdown let me bring brother branham into this now but ivan said his nerves were all on the edge just like the people today we need a juniper tree he said i preach to tired people nervous people pray for nervous people it's a nervous neurotic upset world right now that we're living in everybody's just on the edge just any little thing so upsets them but if adam says god's people is that way the world is that way we all need a juniper tree a place to rest the insane institutions are filling up the hospitals are filling up and juvenile crime is on the rampage and we're living in a terrible time and men are trying to drink it away with whiskey or trying to play it off with cards or laugh it off with a joke i want to bring to us tonight friends that elijah was in pain elijah had went from victory to such disappointment and when you read further i don't know if i'll have time to get into all of it tonight he was he felt disappointed in himself he felt disappointed because he thought he did everything he could do to get people back to god but abraham said i want to quote him what upset him more than anything is that jezebel and her crowd had ignored the miracles i wanted to catch this so i want to go back we have a conversation i want to go back to elijah's prayer because elijah was praying for their hearts to be turned back and elijah had an expectation that the people would have responded to this he also had an expectation that god would make it happen i want to catch this in other words elijah when carmel is going on and the fire fell elijah felt like it is finished these people cannot go back to their own way can't go back to how they were before because this is what it would take to push them back online or turn their hearts back so fear is what begin to move elijah but the depression and the anguish and the unmet expectations he had of the people changing was just too much for him that's why he would say it is enough in other words at the end of my road i don't know what to do now i try i'm tired i'm tired i'm tired i'm exhausted and when the branham is preaching you say we all get that point when we get tired we feel we have tried everything we have done our best we have done the best parenting we know how we have made the best effort we know how and and somehow as it were we look at the fruits of it and it seems it seems as if this thing makes no sense and i look at the parallel with our elijah because he also tries to take his own life and we have to be careful as believers to understand how to manage expectations one and two understand the principle of god's timing because elijah's desire was to see the hearts turn back and we we us you me we are living in a day of the hearts being turned back because what was a desire for him is a command for our day it's a commission for our day behold i singular personal pronoun behold i will send you elijah to turn back that's his mission that's his objective that's his purpose that's his mandate that is his orders anybody with me tonight i trust this is being a blessing to you let's go on and as he lay and slept under juniper tree that's where it comes from behold then an angel touched him and said unto him arise and eat and he looked and behold there was a cake bacon on the coals on a cruise of water at his head and he did eat and drink and laid him down again and the age of the lord came again the second time and touched him and said arise and eat because the journey is too great for thee and friends remember the brand i'm speaking about this juniper tree one thing i love about this i was wondering what to title this tonight i was going between when you feel like giving up and i was gonna say maybe when last you took a rest because this lesson of the juniper tree is about taking a rest but a branham said that people think prophets and preachers could just keep going go and go and go in and it's not just about prophets and teachers it's about taking a rest and you see and just say arise and eat but ibrahim even talk about exercise and eating and get catching back your balance especially now more than ever and it says here you have to eat you have to rest because the journey is too great for thee in other words to take this journey you need something more you need to eat and rest but the branham says here in what here is that elijah oh how that we need in this journey that we in now to find a place of rest and that's what i see these bible studies are it's a place of rest it's to recalibrate it's the pause it's a sailor it's peace peace and a storm rest eat angel cakes may this word come to us tonight as angel cakes food for your soul food for your mind food for your spirit because when you're tired you don't make good decisions when you're tired you make illogical when you're stressed out you cannot make good decisions and the journey ahead of you has decisions that must be made some of us we just need to pause that's why by the way i'm saying we all need a juniper tree lord help us tonight i don't know if this is helping anybody tonight we all need a juniper tree but imam said what we need is a juniper tree a place we can we can get quiet before god but abandonment are reading a guinness quote how that we need in this journey that we're in now to find a place of rest and to feast on the word of god so that it will give us strength night after night go to the room and rest and come back the next morning fresh and eat more for there's a great journey and a great battle ahead for the church i believe that we have been children long enough god's going to turn his church into manhood now meaning there are greater responsibilities ahead you can't give up now you can god is is is and and i love this because it's a lesson god yes i say why are you doing there get up no god say listen listen all right all right all right you're feeling overwhelmed rest because i have a journey that greater than if you think what you went through is tough it's a there's a harder journey but before i have a conversation with you because i need to talk to you i want a secretary i want to talk to you but i can't talk to you when you're in this state right though you're all flusterated right now you're you're you're coming out of a high you're vex with the people you're vex with me you're vex with you're all over the place because of unmet expectations what how you thought it would work out didn't work out that way so you you you you just saying things it's better die you don't want to die because you're running from jezebel but here you see anyone to die make up your mind sleep relax yourself eat rest when you rest and you eat and you rest and you eat and you calm down and you relax because our junity take you because i want to have a conversation with you anybody with me tonight verse seven i want to try to find a place to close out that's trying to i'm trying to i'm trying to go as fast as i come but i can't speed up and he arose this is verse 8 and did eat and drink and went check this out in the strength of that meat 40 days and 40 nights unto hurry up the mount of god but a branham said don't these scientists wish they could figure out what elijah is he said what kind of food could a man eat that he could go for 40 days and fought a night on that food lord i want that kind of food in other words this tired man this this man who was speaking out of the character he was out of character you know you ever meet somebody and say that he's not a person no boy something had to happen to him boy he don't talk so you know he don't talk so that i don't know i'm tim now but i'm not a man i know boy that's how elijah wasn't him after a great victory you see a man of god saying i were there i wanted there god kill me god kill me i'm done i fed up i tired is enough lord that that is how the man reached because he had in his mind how things should work out and we have to trust god enough what just shows friends is that there was a misalignment in elijah's level of trust in the plan of god and his desire and that's why i say we have to be so careful because we desire things just as elijah desired things and it was not a bad desire he didn't have a wrong desire his desire was really hard to be turned back and he had an expectation that that service that day was going to change you know many times i preached and i watch young people and i pray to god let this be the day it's painful when you know what they're going through and you preach and you see something happen and you say oh god let this be the day and then you hear that and foolishness again you feel like you waste your time and i can pull any parent in a room tonight how many times you've spoken to your children how many times you've spoken to family members and you wish them the best you give them the best advice you could you pour your heart out you pour energy out and your wistings would be working and then you'll look and see them do the same nonsense again it is a frustrating position it is a hard place to be but i want to encourage you in the midst of that just pause just rest just trust god because he is in control what elijah had to understand was god is in control of his own timing god is the god of his timing and our very best expectations our very best plans our very best desires even our prayers are subject to his timing can the church say amen don't give up say the right thing don't make decisions if you're super exhausted and you're and you know you're not where it's supposed to be one of the very best advice to give parents is if you have to discipline your child don't do it at that point in time you're not thinking straight most bad decisions take place because you're having pause enough to calm down to make the right decision pause take a lesson from elijah hit the bricks get some rest eat something reevaluate this this the situation notice there was no word being communicated in this experience here god didn't tell elijah anything all he liked was doing was eating and resting eating and resting eating and resting and just eating and resting the word didn't come here the world will come later on god will give him his instructions later on but god has to and for god to talk to you some of your business has to also stop there's a lot of lessons in here you're going all over the place and you're tired you yeah you cast the opportunity your car process bible study your car pray you're just wiped out don't sleep any time for prayer no make other things stop the rest so you can come and pray whatever tonight can we try to wrap this up let me go a little bit again verse nine i wanna try to bring this uh close and he came to the under a cave so under the strength of that food he was able to go for 40 days until horeb the mount of god and he came through onto a cave and lodged there stayed there dwelt there relax there and behold know that he's come now that he had talking about giving up and throwing in the toil and enough is enough and any message all these years and and i taught by no way the rapture and and and and i thought by now i speak in mountains i was going to move my whole house hi aubry mountain know that you're calm known and behold the word of the lord came to him and he said unto him what does thou hear elijah in other words what is your story where is situation what are you doing here elijah yesterday i couldn't talk to you before i cannot see how you're going i could have but now that you're eating you're still gonna relax and you're in a position you're opening amenable to conversation i've been waiting to catch your attention all the time he was caught up in in you and how you feel and your emotions and what you going through and jezebel looking for you and the people and all no no calm down calm down calm down tell me what's going on what are you doing here verse 10 and he said i have been very jealous for the lord god of hosts in other words i have feelings about how about you lord and how people view you i'm jealous about you i find people listen for the children of israel have forsaken thy covenant this is not a bad place when i said but just he was just too caught up in it that he couldn't he couldn't even make this a coherent statement 40 days ago for each one of us forsaken thy covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it away all elijah airport here is after mount carmel they're still looking for me too and listen and he said go forth and stand upon the mount before the lord and behold the lord pass by powerful here friends and a great and strong wind rent the mountains and break in pieces the rocks before the lord but the lord was not in the wind friends you know what level of wind it takes to break a rock if you have seen hurricanes when you talk about a category 5 hurricane it speaks a certain character of speed of the wind that will uproot a tree you know what level wind it takes to break a rock but i'm tired and said listen this is the displays it could be a big revival a great move all kinds of different things that i need and and what brother branham was teaching and what god is showing here is that god sometimes doesn't want to be in the visible the grand the great display things so he said say yes god could do that but he was not in that anybody with me but the lord was not in the wind and after the women and earthquake god could do that too but the lord was not in the earthquake and after the earthquake of fire but the lord was not in the fire but after the fire are still small voice may you hear the still small voice i'm getting ready to close out just bear with me a few more minutes still small voice and it was so but about him said this was elijah and i and it's interesting to have with a brand i'm talking about elijah hallelujah talk about elijah was one of them eagles so he knew what to listen for and so when elijah heard it he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entering in of the cave so whatever i'm saying and typing this out it was camel juniper tree cave and behold there came a voice unto him and said what does thou hear elijah and he said i've been very jealous for the lord god of hosts are you jealous for the lord god of us this is the same thing like in ezekiel those who sigh and cry for the abomination the pain of seeing israel in a backslidden condition was eaten elijah up have you lost your sensitivity to the spiritual realm that you just accept any living as the new normal we threw along this phrase new normal all the time but has been a casual christian become your new normal has no prayer life become your new normal has no sincerity become your new normal no burden for the young people is that your new normal yes your child given trouble but let it not be the new normal that you don't lift them up before god and say lord i'm jealous for the lord god of hosts because the children of israel have forsaken thy covenant thrown down nine altars and slain thy prophets with us all and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it away and we read this scripture when i was teaching on jehu and the lord said unto him go return on thy way to the wilderness of damascus in other words this is your mission i've given you the continuation of your ministry all right i understand your burden i knew you were upset you're calm now now you relate to me what your concerns are now let me tell you what i'm gonna do about it and how you are part of that program anybody with me tonight hallelujah and the lord said unto him go in other words all of this talk time time for talk done time to move go return on thy way to the wilderness of damascus and when thou coments anoint israel to be king over syria and jehu who we talked about the son of nimshi shadow anoint to be king over israel and elisa the son of shafat of abel meloha shall do anoint to be prophet in thy room and it shall come to pass that him that escaped the sword of israel shall jehu sleep and him that escape it from the sword of jehu shall elijah sleep and in case you were thinking that you were the only one left yet i have left me seven thousand in israel oh god help me you're not alone elijah i think you you there wondering if you are the only one hanging in there yet i have a given a recount because i keep account i count the year on your head i know how much profits i have yet i have still i have despite the move of the enemy i have left me seven thousand in israel all the knees which have not bowed unto baal and every mount which had not kissed him hallelujah glory to god so glorious telling elijah you they're stressed out thinking you are the only one left a big part of his issue was he's the only one left in other words he said it's just me you know and i don't think i can do this on my own and god saying it's not just you just look to your left just look to your right you can't see them with your eyes hallelujah but they still have seven thousand who still believe that this gospel is real there's still seven thousand who still believe that the rapture will take place there's still seven thousand who still believe they are just like you hallelujah they may not know one another some may be in mar about some indigo mountain some in arima some in grandi some in shogonas they are all over the world but they have not bowed down they have not given up they still believe they might have their own mount carmel experiences they might have their own experiences that lead them to their juniper trees but be assured i still have a plan go go on anoint go get up into action after you take your rest after you recalibrate after you listen to these tapes after you spend time in the world after you eat after your rest after you sleep after you calm down there's still a mission to be accomplished there's still a plan to be done god is still in control and i want to encourage you to church as we bring this message tonight this teaching when you feel like giving up to still keep going on and god is giving you this here this lesson here and how god dealt with elijah and the juniper tree and the whole unfolding is a program god took elijah through therapy hallelujah god took elijah through through coming back to himself because he lost himself he lost himself and sometimes we do lose ourselves but if ever you lose yourself i want you to come back right here to first kings 19 and say okay i need to rest i need to eat i need to wait because god have a word for me it won't be in the wind it won't be in the earthquake it won't be any fire but wait wait until it's still small voice because it'll be in the still small voice i'm going to close with these quotes from the prophet but ibrahimo said what does thou hear what do you hear all these things that's been going on what have you heard in it we've heard confusions we've heard ups and downs we have organized several different organizations we've done great things but where's god in the whole thing so but at brandon was saying even after all of that god is bringing elijah to the point to listen to listen to hear god speaking to you tonight i want you to listen because there's a message in here for you it may be different from somebody else but there's a still small voice that you need to filter filter away the wind filter away the earthquake filter away the fire and get that still small voice i just have two last quotes and we're done but abraham said we can testify and jump up and down and sing and everything like that but until god makes us in such a condition till we can recognize one another as brothers until all malice envy strife and everything's gone out of us our jumping shouting praising god organizing speaking in tongues and healing the sick and performing miracles and everything else will never amount to nothing come back listen come back and wait in the cave till we hear this still small voice that calls us the service of god oh how we need it how the world needs it we need that god will provide hallelujah last quote what we need is to wait till we hear the voice of god as individuals i want us to see friends from carmel to the juniper the recovery point god was all of this was leading elijah to the cave to that still small voice to know the next step in his journey what we need for the bran said is to wait till we hear the voice of god as individuals every man and woman in this convention but iran himself and i'll say this bible study no matter if jim jones and the rest of them that with you if they don't do it you do it anyhow you pull yourself back in a cave and wait there until god speaks to you don't you move he will do it shall we bow our heads for a word of prayer oh gracious heavenly father lord is teaching tonight that i pray would be such a blessing to the hearts of your people lord to see i call it the humanness of elijah to see a man touched by god used by god lord not just in his time and in that moment of time lord with carmel but to see how lord he would lift in the word the spirit of elijah that would rest upon elisha lord that that there was something about that ministry of elijah that is so important lord to your whole plan of redemption that that spirit lord from elijah to elisha lord upon john the baptist lord upon our elijah william branham and throughout a ministry lord to the jews after the gentile dispensation is complete and lord and we look and peek into the life of the elijah of old and we look and peek into the life of our elijah and we see the frustrations we see the burden we see the cry we see what a brand i'm saying you can picture them blue in the face you can see with abandon crying out screaming up branham tabernacle you must get the token no don't don't just believe the message but you have to get the token he is crying out he is jealous for the lord just as elijah was jealous for the lord and the lord to see that prophet come to his own frustration his own trials i know he had to have his own juniper experiences where he had to rest and lord take a pause until he heard from you again to know how to turn to know how to go west to know how to move to know how to minister and lord we in this age as your bride this little lady lord under the canopy of love how you have spoken to us week after week through your word through the messages lord through the prayer meetings bring us all to that spot lord no matter what journey we take to get there lord bring us to that spot most importantly to hear that still small voice and to know that even when things don't work out and even when we are faced with disappointment don't lash out at anybody don't say things that we don't even mean but we can pause we can take a rest like we are tonight pause in your word pause in your spirit pause under the anointing and eat some angel cakes oh god to wake up to food prepared by an angel lord help us lord to see that this word has been prepared by your angel and we are being nourished tonight nourished that we can go on this journey lord that is a hard journey but you give us the food the right food to bring us to that expected end so lord may you bless your people tonight we will bless the mothers in a special way the fathers in a special way you know their burdens you know their prayers you know their desires lord give them the strength to not give up bless the young people their challenges their struggles their pains their concerns help them also to not give up
