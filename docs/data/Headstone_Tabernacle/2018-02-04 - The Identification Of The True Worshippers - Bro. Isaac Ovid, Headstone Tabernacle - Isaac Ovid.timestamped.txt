[1:00:38] go straight to the scriptures reading
[1:00:41] from st. John st. John 4 and reading
[1:00:47] from verse 19
[1:01:07] cynjohn for and reading from verse 19
[1:01:10] and this is Jesus's encounter with the
[1:01:13] woman at the well and the woman saith
[1:01:19] unto him sir I perceive that thou art a
[1:01:24] prophet our fathers worshiped in this
[1:01:27] mountain and he say that in Jerusalem is
[1:01:29] the place where men or to worship jesus
[1:01:32] said unto her woman believe me the hour
[1:01:35] cometh when he shall neither in this
[1:01:37] mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship
[1:01:40] the father he worship he know not what
[1:01:43] we know what we worship for salvation is
[1:01:47] of the Jews but the hour cometh and now
[1:01:50] is when the true worshipers shall
[1:01:52] worship the father in spirit and in
[1:01:55] truth for the father seeketh such to
[1:01:58] worship Him God is a spirit and they
[1:02:01] that worship Him must worship Him in
[1:02:03] spirit and in truth the woman saith unto
[1:02:06] him I know that Messiah has come in
[1:02:09] which is called Christ when he has come
[1:02:11] he will tell us all things jesus said
[1:02:13] unto her i 'that speak unto thee am he
[1:02:17] and upon this came his disciples and
[1:02:20] marvel that he talked with the woman yet
[1:02:23] no man said what seekers dow or white
[1:02:25] oak is dow with her
[1:02:26] the woman had left her waterpot and went
[1:02:28] her way into the city and said to the
[1:02:31] man come see a man which told me all
[1:02:33] things that ever I did is not this the
[1:02:37] Christ my Lord and a blessing to the
[1:02:40] reading of his word you may be seated
[1:02:41] this morning and I certainly want to
[1:02:45] appreciate our pastor this morning I
[1:02:46] appreciate the pastor Burt oven I was
[1:02:49] saying to him it was such a blessing for
[1:02:52] the last almost two months he preached
[1:02:54] almost every single service and we
[1:02:56] really wanted to loot you a little bit
[1:02:57] for your vision for your burden and
[1:03:00] keeping the Messiahship straight a many
[1:03:05] men so I have a title this morning the
[1:03:08] identification of the true worshipers
[1:03:11] the identification of the true
[1:03:15] worshipers and we're going to explore
[1:03:17] that worship is that
[1:03:19] original currency in the economy of God
[1:03:23] come the church salmon and from a
[1:03:26] message looking for Jesus yes for a bag
[1:03:28] on but a Branham said well now we want
[1:03:30] to speak us every meeting about Jesus
[1:03:32] Christ he is the center of our worship
[1:03:35] the center of our attraction the center
[1:03:39] of our life all that we have and want
[1:03:42] are and will be based upon him I want to
[1:03:45] see that again all that we have and want
[1:03:49] ah and will be based upon him he was the
[1:03:53] one who came down and gave his life for
[1:03:55] us come down from glory how come from
[1:03:58] God out of glory and was made flesh
[1:04:00] dwelt among us and taken upon us upon
[1:04:03] him the sin of us all the sickness of us
[1:04:06] all boy are we it's a Calvary and they
[1:04:09] appear the price he's worthy of all
[1:04:11] praise that can be given to him can the
[1:04:14] church him and he's not worthy of some
[1:04:17] praise he's worthy of all the praise
[1:04:19] that we can give to him not some of the
[1:04:22] praise not 80% of your praise not not
[1:04:25] 90% of your praise he's he's worshiped
[1:04:28] he's worthy of all the praise he's he's
[1:04:30] worthy of all the praise and that's why
[1:04:33] this morning we bring a sacrifice of
[1:04:37] praising to the house of the Lord and
[1:04:40] what makes it a sacrifice and we gonna
[1:04:42] talk about it a little bit but way back
[1:04:45] before there was a moon there was a star
[1:04:47] before there was a problem before there
[1:04:49] was a sickness before there was two more
[1:04:51] tire but season before there was
[1:04:53] governments and politics and before
[1:04:55] there was physical currency God existed
[1:04:58] by himself he wasn't even called Corey
[1:05:00] yet because the definition of God you
[1:05:03] know what it is it's the object of
[1:05:05] worship but God existed alone
[1:05:09] he was called LLA elohim this self
[1:05:13] existing one there was there was nothing
[1:05:15] before him he was he was it he was the
[1:05:18] beginning the end he was the before he
[1:05:20] is the after he is eternity wrapped up
[1:05:22] in one he existed by himself and what
[1:05:26] for him to be God he had to have
[1:05:28] somebody to worship Him so God in his
[1:05:31] mind he began to play out a plan that he
[1:05:35] saw before he even spoke and when the
[1:05:40] Branham taught us he created an order of
[1:05:42] angels not all angels are created equal
[1:05:45] he created cherubims he created Sheriff
[1:05:49] hymns he created angels he created
[1:05:51] angels who stand by your house because
[1:05:54] the angel of the lord encamps around
[1:05:56] those who fear Him there are different
[1:05:59] classes and orders of angels is yes the
[1:06:02] angel of the Lord Himself yes Michael
[1:06:04] yes Gabriel are you with me this morning
[1:06:07] and these angels these cherubims these
[1:06:12] share of hymns all night long all day
[1:06:15] long in a context that we can understand
[1:06:21] you spend all their time holy holy holy
[1:06:25] is the Lord holy is the Lord the Lord is
[1:06:29] mighty the Lord is powerful all day long
[1:06:32] the Lord is holy he is worthy he is holy
[1:06:36] they don't stop worshiping the Lord is
[1:06:39] holy he is worthy he is worthy he
[1:06:43] created the heavens he created all
[1:06:46] mighty are you Laura
[1:06:48] that's the angels that's the song this
[1:06:50] thing he could never stop
[1:06:58] halleluyah halleluyah
[1:07:01] you may be seated but it was a problem
[1:07:05] because god although now he could be
[1:07:07] conquered because he had the worship
[1:07:10] there's also different qualities of
[1:07:12] worship the Angels worshiped but he
[1:07:20] couldn't worship from a place of pain
[1:07:22] because I didn't know what pain was he
[1:07:25] could never worship from a place of
[1:07:27] sacrifice because they could never
[1:07:29] understand what sacrifice was the Angels
[1:07:32] could not worship from a place of
[1:07:34] tiredness because the Angels never got
[1:07:36] tired
[1:07:37] you see tired worship that's a different
[1:07:40] flavor to God when you're tired and you
[1:07:42] still worship it's a difference free
[1:07:47] when you sit and you worship when you
[1:07:50] have no money and you worship the
[1:07:53] smelled of fragrance of that worship is
[1:07:56] different
[1:08:05] so caught he longed to have that quality
[1:08:09] of worship that would said that comes
[1:08:12] from your belly when you worship at all
[1:08:15] that's within you when all else is wrong
[1:08:17] and God begin to unfold this and but the
[1:08:22] Branham said that when God spoke and
[1:08:26] said let there be I could imagine all
[1:08:30] the angels that were there was standing
[1:08:32] there and brother Branham said
[1:08:34] specifically there was one angel of
[1:08:37] angels because the angels had different
[1:08:39] portfolios so Michael is the minister of
[1:08:42] defense
[1:08:44] Gabriel was the minister of
[1:08:46] communication so when if you need a
[1:08:48] message to go out here bro go carry a
[1:08:51] message when there's a war to be fought
[1:08:53] Michael we have a situation to take care
[1:08:56] of but there was another angel whose
[1:08:59] name was Lucifer and we gonna talk about
[1:09:01] him a little bit but the Branham said
[1:09:03] when he stood there he watched when God
[1:09:05] spoke and when he saw that something was
[1:09:09] in him that he desired that and he went
[1:09:13] to the north of heaven that's what the
[1:09:16] Bible says in the north of heaven and
[1:09:17] deceived many angels because he wanted
[1:09:21] to worship so the war for worship
[1:09:24] actually began before man was even on
[1:09:28] the earth there was a war for worship
[1:09:30] and that war has continued for all of
[1:09:33] these years it's a war of praise it's a
[1:09:36] war of worship and brother Branham it is
[1:09:39] very simple he said there are only two
[1:09:41] influences
[1:09:42] [Applause]
[1:09:45] and the devil understands is very simple
[1:09:49] for him if you're not worshipping
[1:09:51] calling us matter what he gives to you
[1:09:53] once it's not going to God gets that
[1:09:57] worship once it's not worship to God all
[1:10:01] else is worship for the devil come the
[1:10:04] church amen but we are not gonna let the
[1:10:07] devil take our worship not my worship
[1:10:12] not your worship not my time not your
[1:10:16] time you may be seated a set of young
[1:10:19] people look at any picture of Carnival
[1:10:22] people are hands in the air
[1:10:24] look at the picture of church and
[1:10:26] worship hands in the air people singing
[1:10:31] songs
[1:10:32] it's a replication of what took place
[1:10:35] back then because Lucifer was a worship
[1:10:38] leader calling the first worship leader
[1:10:42] so we understand worship so that war
[1:10:45] that started there is still going on
[1:10:48] today listen to the prophet we're
[1:10:51] getting somewhere God requires
[1:10:53] perfection we want to be a bat in mind
[1:10:56] that there is nothing just path we can
[1:10:58] go in the presence of God it must be
[1:11:01] perfect our worship everything so there
[1:11:04] is such a thing as perfect worship so we
[1:11:08] want to talk about before the beginning
[1:11:09] in the beginning and from the beginning
[1:11:12] because that's what the great war is
[1:11:14] about God as the object of worship and
[1:11:17] brother Branham said you could only
[1:11:19] defeat the enemy when you understand his
[1:11:21] tricks when you understand his tactics
[1:11:24] and I was saying that all through the
[1:11:26] Bible it's been a war about worship
[1:11:31] [Applause]
[1:11:34] this seemed devil we're talking about he
[1:11:37] goes by different names a serpent that's
[1:11:40] the deceiver that's a subtle one he goes
[1:11:43] by the devil
[1:11:45] that's the adversary goes by Seton as
[1:11:48] the accuser here's different forms in
[1:11:50] the dragon it's the same devil but in
[1:11:53] Eden he was there and he couldn't go at
[1:11:56] Adam because Adam had the world he knew
[1:11:58] durwood so he went to e because God had
[1:12:00] never spoken directly to Eve it was
[1:12:03] Adams job to let Eve know what God said
[1:12:06] but the devil the serpent the dragon
[1:12:09] whatever for me suppurating him went to
[1:12:11] her and say what did God say he's subtle
[1:12:14] in how he operates but what he's trying
[1:12:17] to get is to get you off the word
[1:12:19] because once you're off the word your
[1:12:21] worship cannot be received
[1:12:23] [Applause]
[1:12:24] that's why Jesus can see God is spirit
[1:12:28] and he that worship Him must worship Him
[1:12:31] in spirit and in truth so true worship
[1:12:37] is too full it's in spirit you have to
[1:12:40] be in the spirit but it was also being
[1:12:42] truth that's why the Prophet had to come
[1:12:45] to bring truth because truth is a person
[1:12:50] jesus said I am the way I am the truth I
[1:12:54] am the life so the Prophet had to come
[1:12:57] to introduce mr. truth mister Jesus
[1:13:01] become oh you know hear me this morning
[1:13:05] this is why we know what we worship we
[1:13:08] don't worship a message we don't worship
[1:13:11] a prophet we worship the resurrected
[1:13:14] Lord Jesus Christ he alone these cells
[1:13:17] our worship
[1:13:18] oh my you may be seated
[1:13:25] bring back the old and Christian if I
[1:13:28] don't have voice to praise I'm gonna hit
[1:13:30] my under the chair if I lost my voice
[1:13:33] I'm not gonna let no rock I'll praise me
[1:13:35] I'm not gonna let the bench I'll praise
[1:13:37] me we will create a to worship we were
[1:13:41] born to worship
[1:13:46] true worship unlock your blessings
[1:13:54] come on now before the service is over
[1:13:58] we're gonna turn this place upside down
[1:14:00] the Deacons would have to move the
[1:14:02] chairs out because when you get a
[1:14:04] revelation that you were born to worship
[1:14:06] when you get a revelation that this is
[1:14:09] the season of the Jubilee and the devil
[1:14:12] has got to let you go
[1:14:18] Sumalee time too many time i hear sound
[1:14:23] of a trumpet ouap ouap ouap ouap ouap
[1:14:27] and you can go free if you want to go
[1:14:30] free you don't have to be in bondage
[1:14:32] listen
[1:14:40] hallelujah you may be seated friends
[1:14:44] heaven is not our jurisdiction
[1:14:53] heaven is not our jurisdiction you see
[1:14:57] this F this is our jurisdiction that's
[1:15:02] why the Bible said we shall reign on the
[1:15:08] earth our Authority is connected to
[1:15:11] heaven but our jurisdiction is here
[1:15:14] [Applause]
[1:15:17] the angels of darkness this is not their
[1:15:20] jurisdiction this is our jurisdiction so
[1:15:25] even in your weakest condition there is
[1:15:29] still more Authority and power
[1:15:31] that's why the Prophet can see in your
[1:15:34] little finger has more power than what
[1:15:37] the devil has because when it's your
[1:15:39] jurisdiction
[1:15:43] he may be seen it for a minute let me
[1:15:46] see that different way listen if it's
[1:15:49] your house is your house you could be
[1:15:56] tired it's your house you could have had
[1:16:01] a bad morning and forget your name is
[1:16:03] your host you could be stressed out it's
[1:16:06] still your host you can lose your leg
[1:16:09] and still your host you can be in a
[1:16:12] wheelchair it's still your house you
[1:16:15] don't even have to be able to speak
[1:16:17] there's a deed that says it's your house
[1:16:20] anybody can take the deed and say is his
[1:16:23] house and brother branham said the Holy
[1:16:25] Ghost is the enforcer of the claims of
[1:16:29] redemption based on your jurisdiction as
[1:16:32] a son of God as their a top of God
[1:16:42] can I get a praise in the house can I
[1:16:44] get a shout in the house so this body
[1:16:47] that you're in
[1:16:48] it's your jurisdiction the devil has got
[1:16:51] to take that cancer tumor diabetes high
[1:16:55] blood pressure up email condition this
[1:16:58] is not his jurisdiction
[1:17:00] this body is gonna be changed it's got
[1:17:03] to be changed for the rapture so before
[1:17:06] the rapture it's got to be heal to go
[1:17:08] into the rapture that's why the Prophet
[1:17:11] did say how can you have faithful
[1:17:14] rapture unless you are fit for divine
[1:17:16] healing it's coming our way it's coming
[1:17:20] our way
[1:17:27] home you may be seated
[1:17:29] let the worship us our eyes aren't any
[1:17:32] worshipers in the house and I said some
[1:17:35] time ago there's a difference between
[1:17:38] praise and worship read the Bible and
[1:17:41] the largest book in the Bible is the
[1:17:44] Book of Psalms the book of praise and
[1:17:47] wishing so much how much God loves
[1:17:49] worship when you see it even a man after
[1:17:51] my own cut David understood worship he
[1:17:55] understood praise he understood even you
[1:17:59] know I walk through the valley of the
[1:18:00] shadow of death I fear no evil because
[1:18:02] he understood that he was created to
[1:18:05] worship above all other callings worship
[1:18:09] establishes the relationship that he is
[1:18:12] your God that's the first principle upon
[1:18:15] which you can make requests let me say
[1:18:20] that again God is object of worship so
[1:18:25] the first principle of a request has to
[1:18:28] be the relationship with God because
[1:18:30] when you call upon him he wants to know
[1:18:33] is there relationship am i yogurt I can
[1:18:37] only act upon your situation if I am
[1:18:41] your body and maybe butter puff Wells
[1:18:43] gold but I haven't heard from you in a
[1:18:44] while to know that this thing is real to
[1:18:47] you so when you establish I am your God
[1:18:49] by giving me worship Nora can act on
[1:18:53] your behalf it in a way that to be
[1:18:55] called heresy
[1:18:56] [Applause]
[1:19:00] [Music]
[1:19:03] I don't know where we gonna go this
[1:19:06] morning but we having a time in the
[1:19:08] wooden range you see and the problem and
[1:19:10] many of us we never had a personal
[1:19:12] experience with God you may be seated
[1:19:23] it's impossible to really love and
[1:19:26] really express love until you in the
[1:19:29] relationship in that's a deep one I go
[1:19:34] in somewhere this morning before people
[1:19:39] get married and say I love you before
[1:19:43] marriage and they are tasty food yet
[1:19:47] really the sed was really upset yet so
[1:19:55] that statement of love still has to be
[1:19:56] tested because the situates because love
[1:20:03] is the action where it's easy to say
[1:20:04] that you love when you already have
[1:20:06] problems and the thing is people put
[1:20:10] their best foot forward before marriage
[1:20:13] but you when you're in the relationship
[1:20:16] or in the covenant as some would say
[1:20:18] it's when the love could really blossom
[1:20:21] because it now takes real love when the
[1:20:23] food didn't taste too good to say I love
[1:20:25] you
[1:20:35] that's when the love is tested and
[1:20:37] that's what we sing a song I love him
[1:20:39] because he first the love that we have
[1:20:43] for him could never be the love that he
[1:20:45] has for us it's because of his love for
[1:20:48] us in our situation when we reflect wait
[1:20:51] a minute me
[1:20:54] you know how messed up what I did he
[1:20:58] still loved me all of a sudden you start
[1:21:00] to understand what the meaning of love
[1:21:02] really is because he didn't have to do
[1:21:04] it what he did he didn't have to pick me
[1:21:07] up what he did
[1:21:13] and that's when it becomes a personal
[1:21:16] experience you may be seated
[1:21:20] I shared many young people talking about
[1:21:22] pizza if I may just from you in a few
[1:21:24] minutes when you read a Bible I believe
[1:21:27] it's Luke five where Jesus is on a
[1:21:30] mission his mission is to get Peters
[1:21:32] attention because Peter had not had a
[1:21:36] personal experience with God you could
[1:21:40] come to church and I'd have a personal
[1:21:42] experience with God he'd been the
[1:21:44] message and believed and still not have
[1:21:46] a personal experience with God people
[1:21:51] have an experience with the church all
[1:21:53] but I'm talking about experience with
[1:21:55] God and the Bible said Jesus was pressed
[1:21:59] he was pressed anyone to the share would
[1:22:02] and as he walked down by the seashore
[1:22:04] about him he saw to bow to see them acts
[1:22:06] permission he just walked into one of
[1:22:08] them I want you to see the background
[1:22:12] the Bible said the men were there
[1:22:14] washing their nets
[1:22:15] you know what washing Anitha mean you're
[1:22:19] packing up you're finished look it's
[1:22:22] early in the morning I said well and his
[1:22:23] men are washing their nets Jesus and
[1:22:25] that's permission and the Bible says he
[1:22:27] told Pizza pulled the boat off the shore
[1:22:29] and I said this was the first service
[1:22:33] that Peter was in that he didn't really
[1:22:34] want to be in because Peter was washing
[1:22:37] his nets to go back home and Jesus Paul
[1:22:40] Peter in a church service on a boat on
[1:22:42] Peters boat so Peter really couldn't go
[1:22:45] anyway Jesus is on Peters boat and he's
[1:22:48] preaching from Peters boat and Peter is
[1:22:51] tired because he has fish all night
[1:22:53] Peter is frustrated because he had
[1:22:55] caught nothing he had already washed his
[1:22:57] Nets which means he packed up he was
[1:22:59] ready to go home and he now finds
[1:23:03] himself there's a crowd of people
[1:23:05] there's Jesus and he already kind of
[1:23:06] leave because it's his boat Jesus on his
[1:23:08] boat and he really wants to go home the
[1:23:12] Bible said when Jesus finished preaching
[1:23:15] he turns to Peter and say cast your nets
[1:23:20] plural into the water
[1:23:24] now pizza is in a predicament we don't
[1:23:26] know how many people are still on the
[1:23:28] show we don't know what's going on
[1:23:30] around them but Peter now has a decision
[1:23:32] to make and Peter sad to say well Lord
[1:23:34] you know we we fished all night and we
[1:23:38] didn't catch anything but your wood now
[1:23:47] I wanna draw distinction and you can
[1:23:49] read it in time because the Bible makes
[1:23:51] very specific reference here Pizza it
[1:23:55] took a lot of faith for Peter to act
[1:23:57] because Peter was the authority so to
[1:23:59] speak on the subject he was the
[1:24:00] fisherman there was a reason they fish
[1:24:04] at night because at night you catch the
[1:24:05] fish in the daytime they see the nets so
[1:24:10] Jesus is challenging teachers position
[1:24:12] and his authority and say cast your nets
[1:24:15] plural now pizza already had an
[1:24:19] experience before the Bible says when
[1:24:22] you read from Luke 4 and you read Jesus
[1:24:24] first miracle
[1:24:25] everybody knew when Jesus turned water
[1:24:27] into wine that was everybody it was not
[1:24:31] Peter in the chapter before in Luke 4
[1:24:34] the Bible says Jesus went to Peters
[1:24:37] mother-in-law who had a fever and healed
[1:24:41] a mother-in-law so Peter knew that this
[1:24:44] God was a God of healer but Peter didn't
[1:24:48] have a personal experience himself but
[1:24:54] he was still willing to try
[1:24:57] he didn't try all the way you know
[1:24:59] because Jesus said put the nets plural
[1:25:02] into the water the back said pizza said
[1:25:04] I will put down with net singular so I'm
[1:25:08] willing to give it a shot I'm willing to
[1:25:09] give it a try I'm willing to go one more
[1:25:11] time because / adventists something
[1:25:13] happens to me and the Bible says that
[1:25:15] when pizza are put down the net it was
[1:25:18] so much fish the net Bri and he call his
[1:25:23] partners and it was so much fish to put
[1:25:25] beginning to sang the partners board
[1:25:27] begin to sign but that whole story and
[1:25:29] script is not about the fish it's not
[1:25:31] even about the net it was God saying
[1:25:33] pizza I've come to give you a personal
[1:25:34] experience that you can follow me it was
[1:25:39] so much fish that when they got back to
[1:25:43] shore the Bible says Pizza left
[1:25:45] everything included any fish and began
[1:25:47] to follow Jesus
[1:25:52] Pizza where you going
[1:25:54] I don't know Pizza how you're gonna eat
[1:25:56] I can imagine mr. if he could take water
[1:25:59] until it in the wine if he could hear my
[1:26:01] mother-in-law and if he could get fish
[1:26:03] where there was no fish I'd have to
[1:26:04] worry about we are gonna eat and I'm
[1:26:11] seeing this money still to see me
[1:26:13] yesterday he's telling us entertained
[1:26:15] he's still the same forever
[1:26:17] [Applause]
[1:26:20] [Music]
[1:26:23] [Applause]
[1:26:27] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:26:29] everybody feelin fine so we're top of
[1:26:33] worship this morning and by the brendham
[1:26:35] said listen you can make anything your
[1:26:38] God because God is the object of worship
[1:26:42] but a man cynical worship your house he
[1:26:45] gonna be a Keiko worship your business
[1:26:47] you can worship you go with me message
[1:26:49] remember the brand was here decide to
[1:26:51] the worship the Prophet and even
[1:26:54] baptized in his name and he left the
[1:26:57] fields because of that because you could
[1:27:00] worship anything but we don't want to
[1:27:03] spend time talking about that we want to
[1:27:06] talk about the true worship because when
[1:27:10] it becomes a true worship is no longer
[1:27:12] the minister telling you to worship
[1:27:14] worshiped is because of who he is not
[1:27:18] what he could do for you or did for you
[1:27:20] but it's because that He is God because
[1:27:22] he is Alpha and Omega because he's the
[1:27:25] beginning and the end because he created
[1:27:27] the heavens and the earth whether you
[1:27:29] have money or don't have money he is
[1:27:31] still worthy of worship and from your
[1:27:34] belly every day every moment worship is
[1:27:37] not just this worship is your time it's
[1:27:39] your effort
[1:27:40] it's your substance it's your meditation
[1:27:43] it's your song it's your attitude it's
[1:27:46] how you come to the house of God it's
[1:27:48] how you do your lunch it's how you do
[1:27:50] your dinner
[1:27:51] you are worship you are worshipers above
[1:27:55] all else what are you I'm a worshiper
[1:27:57] I'm a true worshiper by revelation come
[1:28:01] the church semen
[1:28:04] Oh hallelujah hallelujah so the devil
[1:28:11] Lucifer you wanted worship and for those
[1:28:14] of you who don't know the scripture in
[1:28:16] Isaiah 14 in verse 12 or how I doubt
[1:28:19] fallen from heaven o Lucifer son of the
[1:28:22] morning how I don't cut down to the
[1:28:25] ground which didst weaken the nation's
[1:28:27] but though I said in thine heart I will
[1:28:30] ascend into heaven I will exalt my
[1:28:32] throne above the stars of God I will sit
[1:28:35] also upon the Mount of the congregation
[1:28:37] in the sides of the north I will ascend
[1:28:41] above the heights of the clouds I will
[1:28:43] be like the Most High he had thou shall
[1:28:47] be brought down to hell to the size of
[1:28:49] the pit
[1:28:50] day that City shall narrowly look upon
[1:28:52] thee and consider leasing is this the
[1:28:55] man that I've made the earth to tremble
[1:28:57] that did shake kingdoms that's the
[1:29:01] resume of this Lucifer we're talking
[1:29:03] about
[1:29:03] listen to Ezekiel 28 verse 11 moreover
[1:29:07] the word of the Lord came unto me saying
[1:29:09] son of man take up a lamentation upon
[1:29:13] the king of Tyrus and say unto Him
[1:29:15] dustier the Lord God those sealless up
[1:29:18] to some full of wisdom and perfect in
[1:29:21] beauty listen to the description though
[1:29:24] has been in Eden the garden of God every
[1:29:27] precious stone was like covering you see
[1:29:33] for beautiful the sorriest topaz and the
[1:29:36] diamond the burial the Onyx and the
[1:29:39] Jasper the Sapphire the emerald and the
[1:29:42] carbuncle and gold the workmanship of
[1:29:45] die Tabrez enough that pipes was
[1:29:47] prepared in the in the day that door was
[1:29:50] created you see this adversary dealing
[1:29:55] with you see why the devil could create
[1:29:58] everything so attractive to pull your
[1:30:01] attention he was created in beauty
[1:30:04] listen to the description don't add the
[1:30:07] anointed cherub that covereth and I have
[1:30:11] set this soul though was upon the holy
[1:30:14] mountain of
[1:30:16] though has walked up and down in the
[1:30:17] midst of the stones of fire you see what
[1:30:20] how he could be spiritual though was
[1:30:22] perfect in thy ways from the day that
[1:30:25] door was created till iniquity was found
[1:30:27] in thee by the multitude of thy
[1:30:32] merchandise they have filled the midst
[1:30:34] of thee with violence and thou has
[1:30:36] sinned therefore I will pass the as
[1:30:39] profane out of the mountain of God and I
[1:30:42] will destroy thee or covering cherub
[1:30:44] from the midst of the stones of fire
[1:30:46] then how it was lifted up because of thy
[1:30:49] beauty that was corrupted thy wisdom by
[1:30:52] reason of their brightness
[1:30:54] I will cast it to the ground I will ad
[1:30:56] before kings and they may be holding
[1:30:59] thou hast defied like sanctuaries by the
[1:31:02] multitude of thine iniquities by the
[1:31:05] iniquity of thy traffic therefore will I
[1:31:07] bring for a fire from the midst of thee
[1:31:10] it shall devour thee and I will bring
[1:31:12] thee to ashes upon the earth in the
[1:31:14] sight of all them that beholding all
[1:31:18] their that know the among the people
[1:31:20] shall be astonished at thee thou shalt
[1:31:22] be a terror and never shalt thou be
[1:31:24] anymore so the devil he knows this he
[1:31:28] knows that he is running out of time he
[1:31:31] knows that is a time limit can the
[1:31:35] church say Amen but the true worshipers
[1:31:39] because the devil has coveted so much
[1:31:42] worship when you read a book of
[1:31:43] Revelation about all that dwell on the
[1:31:47] earth will worship the Beast except
[1:31:51] those names that are written so you have
[1:31:55] to know where you're standing this
[1:31:57] morning and why true worship King lamb
[1:32:00] worship is so important to differentiate
[1:32:02] yourself from those that worship the
[1:32:05] Beast can the church say man now but the
[1:32:09] man I'm in the fourth seal now as oil
[1:32:11] symbolize the Holy Spirit then we
[1:32:13] founded oil and wine is connected in
[1:32:15] worship and the wine I said which come
[1:32:18] to me the wine symbolizes that it was
[1:32:20] the power of stimulation of Rabbi
[1:32:23] revelation that's when something has
[1:32:25] been revealed
[1:32:26] it gives stimulation to the believer
[1:32:28] because it's
[1:32:29] by revelation see it's summoner court
[1:32:32] has said it's a mystery they can't
[1:32:34] understand it see and after a while God
[1:32:37] comes down and reveals it and then
[1:32:38] vindicate sent you in Revelation fire
[1:32:41] this morning the worship chapter the
[1:32:43] true worship is wine and oil together
[1:32:46] and I sent you this morning like job
[1:32:49] where was Tom when I lay the foundation
[1:32:51] of the world declare if thou has
[1:32:53] understanding it has to be real to you
[1:32:56] and you have to shed everything that
[1:32:58] keeps you from true worship and the
[1:33:00] church amen
[1:33:02] [Applause]
[1:33:05] you may be seated
[1:33:07] so we're back in Genesis after man fell
[1:33:10] keen and evil he came to bring their
[1:33:13] worship and they both worshiped they
[1:33:16] worshiped by one by revelation and the
[1:33:20] other by intellect they both understood
[1:33:24] at the sacrifice was required but Abel
[1:33:27] by revelation recognized that the blood
[1:33:29] had to be shed Cain brought the best of
[1:33:33] what he had he brought his fruits he
[1:33:35] brought his own interpretation and no
[1:33:37] other incredible things God said take in
[1:33:41] if you do like your brother you will
[1:33:43] actually get the same lesson but it was
[1:33:46] nothing his heart this thing has got to
[1:33:49] be in your heart it's got to be real to
[1:33:53] you this message has got to be inside of
[1:33:56] you not just I'm gonna tell you I
[1:33:59] believe the problem is got to be in your
[1:34:00] heart so that bottle of worship started
[1:34:04] all the way back there and it plays a
[1:34:06] true scripture Keane had his worship
[1:34:09] even had his worship but only one was
[1:34:12] accepted it's in man's nature to worship
[1:34:17] so you go along to Scripture Nimrod what
[1:34:19] did he do he built a tower
[1:34:22] because you want to go up to worship
[1:34:25] number the random said come down and
[1:34:27] live like a devil because he know he has
[1:34:30] to worship and listen they were so
[1:34:33] focused and so United that God had to
[1:34:36] confound them because when a people are
[1:34:39] united there's almost nothing could stop
[1:34:41] them
[1:34:42] so God had to actually stop them and as
[1:34:44] you go to scripture when the churn of
[1:34:46] his away in bondage what did God tell
[1:34:48] Moses when you come out of Egypt bring
[1:34:52] my people to this mountain so they could
[1:34:55] do what you see how important worship is
[1:35:00] to God and you see how everywhere God is
[1:35:03] looking for his worship the devil always
[1:35:06] try to find himself in there somewhere
[1:35:08] hmm so I'm seeing this morning before
[1:35:10] you possess your inheritance you have to
[1:35:13] do what I know that every place and you
[1:35:18] know every place that you put your foot
[1:35:21] is yours but before you can even walk
[1:35:23] you're supposed to do what before the
[1:35:26] walls of Jericho can even come down the
[1:35:28] people have to do what so this battle
[1:35:33] has been raging you know when you
[1:35:35] worship you the angels are being
[1:35:38] dispatched in your favor because he
[1:35:42] inhabits the praises of his people when
[1:35:44] you worship Him the whole walls begin to
[1:35:47] shake your situations begin to shake the
[1:35:50] devil can't even move you come on now
[1:35:53] [Applause]
[1:35:56] Oh hallelujah let's set P the name of
[1:36:01] the Lord I want to read a few scriptures
[1:36:03] for you that's okay I just want an
[1:36:05] earless down from your Testament as well
[1:36:07] reading from Exodus chapter 3 I just
[1:36:13] want to show you how many times Moses in
[1:36:17] his ministry was talking about worship
[1:36:19] in Exodus 3 and verse 12 and he said
[1:36:26] certainly I will be where this is God
[1:36:27] speaking to Moses and this shall be a
[1:36:29] token unto thee that I have sembly when
[1:36:31] thou has brought forth the people out of
[1:36:33] Egypt he shall serve God and that means
[1:36:36] worship God upon this mountain so the
[1:36:39] instruction of bringing the people out
[1:36:41] still didn't talk fully about a promise
[1:36:44] when God spoke to Moses it was about
[1:36:46] worship when you bring them out bring
[1:36:48] them to this mountain to worship by the
[1:36:51] time we read Exodus chapter 4 and verse
[1:36:53] 23 and I see Anthony let my son go that
[1:36:56] he may serve me or worship me and if
[1:36:59] thou refuse to let him go behold I will
[1:37:01] slay thy son even thy firstborn son
[1:37:04] Exodus 431 and the people believed and
[1:37:07] when they heard that the Lord had
[1:37:09] visited the children of Israel and he
[1:37:12] had looked upon the affliction they
[1:37:13] bowed their heads and worshiped Exodus 7
[1:37:19] and verse 16 and thou shalt say unto him
[1:37:22] talking to fear o the Lord God of the
[1:37:25] Hebrews has set me on to be seeing let
[1:37:29] my people go that they may serve or
[1:37:32] worship me in the wilderness and behold
[1:37:35] Tara to dawood is not here so Moses is
[1:37:39] coming to Pharaoh not Jesse let my
[1:37:41] people go to let my people go so they
[1:37:44] could worship can the church say Amen
[1:37:47] Exodus 8:1 and the Lord speak unto Moses
[1:37:51] go unto Pharaoh and see unto him does
[1:37:54] hear the Lord let my people go that he
[1:37:58] may worship me God is waiting few to
[1:38:01] comment upon ditch the cry is coming to
[1:38:05] Egypt
[1:38:06] you can worship come on to your
[1:38:08] situation so you could worship Exodus 8
[1:38:15] and verse 20 and the Lord said unto
[1:38:17] Moses rise up early in the morning and
[1:38:20] stand before fear o law he command for
[1:38:23] to the water and sea unto him does fear
[1:38:26] the Lord let my people go that demon
[1:38:29] worship me it wasn't once Moses spoke to
[1:38:33] Pharaoh
[1:38:34] it was over and over and over again God
[1:38:38] is saying this is my people and they
[1:38:40] were born to worship me let them go
[1:38:44] release them release them from their
[1:38:47] bondage release them from their chains
[1:38:49] release them from their sickness release
[1:38:52] them from their situation because they
[1:38:55] were born to worship in your bondage
[1:38:57] it's hard to worship but Pharaoh house
[1:39:01] of hell give way to the name of Jesus
[1:39:04] because you are gonna worship
[1:39:06] [Applause]
[1:39:10] can the church team in exodus 9 and
[1:39:14] verse 1 then the Lord said unto Moses
[1:39:17] it's over and over you know in other
[1:39:20] words you know we talked about Noah
[1:39:21] preached it well Rena it will ring it
[1:39:24] will ring most of that a similar message
[1:39:26] influenced 9 then the Lord said to Moses
[1:39:29] go in out of here oh I tell him to see
[1:39:32] the Lord God of the Hebrews let my
[1:39:34] people go that Timmy worship me is the
[1:39:37] same message Moses had one message not
[1:39:40] just let my people go but let my people
[1:39:42] go so that they could worship me later
[1:39:45] on in that same chapter Exodus 9 and
[1:39:48] verse 13 let's go and the Lord said unto
[1:39:51] Moses rise up early in the morning and
[1:39:53] stand before Pharaoh in other words do
[1:39:57] it how much ever times you need to do it
[1:39:59] I'm ready yesterday I made every day
[1:40:03] before but we are not staying in bondage
[1:40:06] lose them let them call so that they can
[1:40:10] worship me
[1:40:11] [Applause]
[1:40:18] Exodus 9 and verse 13 and the Lord said
[1:40:22] unto Moses rise up early in the morning
[1:40:23] don't wake up late in the morning Moses
[1:40:26] get up early in the morning make it your
[1:40:28] first order of business to let the devil
[1:40:31] know that he is glad to let you go and
[1:40:33] there's a reason for letting you go it's
[1:40:35] not just you to be free but it's free to
[1:40:37] worship free to shout free to adore free
[1:40:41] to lift him up lift him higher and the
[1:40:44] church demon and the Lord said unto
[1:40:52] Moses rise up early in the morning and
[1:40:55] stand before Pharaoh and say unto Him

[1:42:50] verse 3 and Moses and Aaron came in unto
[1:42:54] Pharaoh Moses brought back up most have
[1:43:00] been gone all along and seemed a godsend
[1:43:03] but this time he brought Aaron this time
[1:43:06] he brought his brother this time he
[1:43:08] brought another soldier in case you
[1:43:11] thought it was me alone speaking for
[1:43:14] these people
[1:43:14] I've got other men with me but we are
[1:43:17] not giving up we're not disappearing
[1:43:20] we're not going back into the wilderness

[1:43:27] Sumalee oh you may be seated
[1:43:32] I can imagine listen the two neighbors
[1:43:35] are watching this whole team play out
[1:43:37] Moses green by himself hero let my
[1:43:40] people go so they can worship Moses met
[1:43:43] once twice and Moses and Aaron are

[1:44:42] have no army they don't have no weapons
[1:44:44] they don't have no kind of great
[1:44:46] position and now it was Moses they speak
[1:44:49] in confusion but not Aaron coming how
[1:44:51] long will you not humble yourself this
[1:44:53] is same Lucifer who exalted himself but
[1:44:56] the Branham said it was the same Lucy
[1:44:57] but operating through all these kingdoms
[1:44:59] and to all these kings
[1:45:00] so it wasn't fear of the man that they
[1:45:03] were speaking to it was that's for
[1:45:04] Lucifer the king of Tyre the king of
[1:45:07] Babylon the king of Persia the king of a
[1:45:10] room it was that spirit
[1:45:19] and this is a problem with many of us we

[1:53:32] born into sin and shaved in iniquity and
[1:53:34] we found ourselves doing tasks that we
[1:53:37] did not want to do our very nature was
[1:53:40] against God and the taskmaster it's what
[1:53:43] led to you lyin and led to you stealing

[1:55:39] preacher last week he's had to push you
[1:55:41] teacher named Ezra and I tell her over

[1:55:48] cry and God say listen speak and move on
[1:55:50] why you crying how much miracles you
[1:55:52] need to see to know if I bring you out
[1:55:54] from the hand of Egypt you don't think I
[1:55:56] will finish this thing and then Moses
[1:55:58] recognized his jurisdiction
[1:56:00] he recognizes Authority and he spoke it
[1:56:03] wasn't God put words in his mouth oh no
[1:56:05] it was you speak your son you have the
[1:56:07] jurisdiction you have the authority is

[1:56:44] [Applause]
[1:56:55] you may be seated and that there was a
[1:56:58] type of Lucifer being destroyed forever
[1:57:01] it's coming his time is up we are
[1:57:06] eternal he is not he has a time limit
[1:57:08] you have no timeline because you come
[1:57:09] from eternity and it went back to
[1:57:11] eternity turning on this earth that's
[1:57:14] why robits has so many times the devil
[1:57:16] cannot get stronger but you could get
[1:57:18] stronger glory to God how are we doing
[1:57:25] amen
[1:57:26] so we told him it about worship the
[1:57:28] issue between Daniel and the king of
[1:57:36] Babylon the issue was worship those men
[1:57:42] had a problem with Daniel he was just
[1:57:44] different
[1:57:45] so they convinced the King about the
[1:57:47] Lord at know praying and this is another
[1:57:49] day and Daniel didn't let it move him
[1:57:52] Daniel still prayed it was not a natural
[1:57:55] issue these were politicians making it a
[1:57:58] spiritual issue to show how the devil
[1:58:01] operates through politics the issue was
[1:58:05] worship but Daniel didn't let that stop
[1:58:09] him he prayed anyhow
[1:58:11] [Music]
[1:58:13] and it's true Daniel in the lion's den
[1:58:16] and by the battle dramatized it he said
[1:58:22] when the lion saw Daniel he recognized
[1:58:24] that same fire was all over Daniel the
[1:58:32] same anointing was all over Tantalus him
[1:58:34] power and the lion didn't touch Daniel
[1:58:38] [Music]
[1:58:40] at that same time the Hebrew boys at
[1:58:42] their knowledge and the King is so blown
[1:58:44] away with Daniel and his good that he
[1:58:47] creates an arrow but the Brenham says
[1:58:49] that Idol was in an image of Daniel so
[1:58:57] understand this is brother Daniel we
[1:59:00] talk emotional
[1:59:03] to show you how the devil wants a pull
[1:59:06] away worship from God he takes a man of
[1:59:10] God and makes the idol of a man of God
[1:59:15] and requested the people who worship
[1:59:19] because it says a look at the testimony
[1:59:21] this man was put in the lion's den and
[1:59:25] his God delivered him bow down to this
[1:59:29] Idol the Hebrew boys could have said
[1:59:35] that's brother Daniel we serve the same
[1:59:38] God they could have said all of that but
[1:59:40] they knew that their God is not an idol
[1:59:43] it's not an image it's the court in
[1:59:46] heaven and they say we will not bow down
[1:59:49] to no image to no teaching - no idea -
[1:59:55] no interpretation and they say we will
[2:00:01] truly in the fiery furnace they had a
[2:00:04] choice there's always a choice they're
[2:00:06] gonna say ok ok ok ok here's one here's
[2:00:07] one here's where we will bow down you
[2:00:11] won't have a choice with what you
[2:00:12] worship and they were born enough to say
[2:00:15] our God will deliver us but even if he
[2:00:19] doesn't deliver us we will still not bow
[2:00:21] down God give us men and women like that
[2:00:23] [Applause]
[2:00:32] we know what we worship I was doing some
[2:00:37] studies of history Roman history and
[2:00:40] around the time of Jesus
[2:00:41] you know how they figure out who the
[2:00:43] Christians were in our day we say good
[2:00:46] morning that's a greeting and people
[2:00:47] well she's supposed to respond you know
[2:00:50] we live in a world people are just like
[2:00:51] there's no morning there's no greeting
[2:00:54] let's walk past your streets years ago
[2:00:56] normal people say good morning good
[2:00:59] morning like doing normal people no we
[2:01:02] do have normal people but in those days
[2:01:05] but a kind of a the greeting was Caesar
[2:01:08] is king and you were required to respond
[2:01:12] and the king a caesar so when you walk
[2:01:15] in the street caesar is king and the
[2:01:17] king is caesar caesar is king and the
[2:01:20] king is caesar but the followers of
[2:01:22] jesus could never give that response
[2:01:26] caesar's king and the king is jesus and
[2:01:31] [Applause]
[2:01:33] as easy as that they would say lions
[2:01:37] then chop his head off so i was
[2:01:41] listening to somebody to speak on this
[2:01:42] and he was saying it was very easy you
[2:01:44] had a choice because only this is andy
[2:01:47] king a caesar and your life was spared
[2:01:51] but if you are real believer and you
[2:01:54] recognize that he is your king you
[2:01:57] couldn't acknowledge and the king a
[2:01:58] caesar who is isa jesus is the King of
[2:02:02] Kings the Lord of lords if you chop my
[2:02:05] head off my foot off put made-up flat of
[2:02:07] oil or crucify me or even in a lion it
[2:02:10] doesn't change the fact to me that Jesus
[2:02:13] is the king you can't boil it out of me
[2:02:16] you can't convince it out of me you
[2:02:19] can't take it out of me he is my king he
[2:02:22] is my lord he is my Savior
[2:02:24] he's my Redeemer
[2:02:26] [Applause]
[2:02:30] [Music]
[2:02:31] [Applause]
[2:02:34] you still talking about worship and I
[2:02:36] want to strike something with a young
[2:02:38] people interview the issue with Mordecai
[2:02:41] and Amon was worship because when Haman
[2:02:47] is walking the people was a bow down
[2:02:50] bowing is reverence bow down and worship
[2:02:54] it's a part of that level of respect
[2:02:58] that comes a certain way and in that day
[2:03:02] everybody was bowing down to him and
[2:03:04] except Mordecai only one man and he a
[2:03:09] man got so upset but one man imagined by
[2:03:14] the Georgie war community by now and
[2:03:16] it's one man you don't if it is back I
[2:03:26] don't know him and say founded if is his
[2:03:28] back with him please because everybody
[2:03:30] suppose abomino and he was so troubled
[2:03:35] but Mordecai was the only man it seemed
[2:03:39] who had a revelation I'm not bowing down
[2:03:41] to this man I'm not doing it and that
[2:03:46] one man caused Hindman to go and tell
[2:03:50] the King to write a law to kill all the
[2:03:54] Jews because he coveted that one man's
[2:03:57] worship that one man's respect if
[2:04:01] Mordecai had ball down there would be no
[2:04:04] persecution if Mordecai had ball down
[2:04:07] Esther would not have been challenged to
[2:04:10] have received the words for such a time
[2:04:12] as this
[2:04:13] but because Mordecai rejected the
[2:04:16] opportunity to subject himself to him
[2:04:19] and it unfolded a journey for the Jews I
[2:04:25] asked young people some time ago what is
[2:04:27] worship people live their hands and but
[2:04:31] what is really what what what is worship
[2:04:33] because worship speaks to a number of
[2:04:36] things it's your time
[2:04:40] the people who lift their hands
[2:04:42] faithfully and they give God no time
[2:04:45] they don't pray they don't sing you see
[2:04:49] with in church and they hardly singing
[2:04:50] but catch them on the street now they
[2:04:52] know all these songs for all kinds of
[2:04:55] other stuff but instead it's what you
[2:05:11] reverence worship is what you respect
[2:05:16] can the church say Amen with a Branham
[2:05:22] in his days when he was here there was a
[2:05:24] man who was beating up preachers and
[2:05:27] when they came into the service where
[2:05:29] the Prophet was and the Prophet was not
[2:05:31] a big man as you know and all the
[2:05:33] ministers fled from the platform to form
[2:05:39] a not a barricade they just fled and a
[2:05:44] man is walking up and as the man is
[2:05:47] coming but a Branham says he will fall
[2:05:50] over my feet in the rain
[2:05:53] and as the man is coming to brother
[2:05:56] Branham he falls over the prophets feet
[2:05:59] and they call the police and when the
[2:06:03] police come they say person will this
[2:06:05] man be all right
[2:06:06] whatever the random person he said no
[2:06:09] he'll not be all right because he
[2:06:11] worships the spirit that's upon him so
[2:06:16] any worship the spirit as upon you you
[2:06:19] cannot even be set free
[2:06:23] that's why you have to understand what
[2:06:26] you worship and the danger today with
[2:06:30] this issue of worship and you could say
[2:06:33] it's for the young people but the devil
[2:06:35] has found these subtle ways to get into
[2:06:37] everything most importantly our time
[2:06:43] whether it's Facebook whether it's news
[2:06:46] whether it's whatever it is it could be
[2:06:51] for the best of intentions but anything
[2:06:55] that takes your time away from God
[2:06:59] that's what you worship in people spend
[2:07:07] more time on Facebook in a day than they
[2:07:11] pray in a week statistics say that the
[2:07:15] average time people spend on social
[2:07:16] media in a day is over two hours
[2:07:18] I wouldn't ask how many of you prayed
[2:07:21] for two hours per day this week but what
[2:07:26] kind of church would we have if you
[2:07:27] spend that same time crying for revival
[2:07:32] because the Prophet said the minister
[2:07:35] could never bring the revival it takes
[2:07:38] the people to call for it so even though
[2:07:43] the children of Israel had a promise
[2:07:45] upon them that they were going to be
[2:07:47] delivered it was only when they began to
[2:07:49] cry it activated the promise that's why
[2:07:53] God could say I have heard the cries of
[2:07:55] my people and I've come down to deliver
[2:07:57] he can never harm the promise but what
[2:08:00] ignited the activation of the promise
[2:08:03] was when he heard the cries of my people
[2:08:06] when last have you cried when last of
[2:08:11] you side when last have you put down the
[2:08:14] funder put on the Facebook put down when
[2:08:20] the Prophet was he says shoot the TV the
[2:08:24] devil heard that he brought the TV on
[2:08:26] iPads on phones and devices and make it
[2:08:32] happy to shoot Giavanna and the devil
[2:08:41] will try everything to get your worship
[2:08:44] to take your time to take your energy to
[2:08:47] take your resources take your joy zaps
[2:08:53] you with negative news and this and that
[2:08:55] to keep you away when you have to be
[2:08:59] practicing the presence of God it should
[2:09:03] be in our daily walk it should be not
[2:09:05] really talking about daily living part
[2:09:12] of your struggle part of my struggle
[2:09:14] part of our struggle is when we make
[2:09:17] something else or God that's not the
[2:09:20] most high good and many times it's not
[2:09:23] deliberate you know I have to work late
[2:09:26] I working an extra I'm doing this I have
[2:09:30] to do this I have to do this and half
[2:09:32] and when you look 3d Espace and you had
[2:09:34] talked to God yet spent no time to
[2:09:39] acknowledge how he is first in your life
[2:09:43] first in your marriage first in your job
[2:09:47] first in your relationship he's the
[2:09:50] reason you woke up this morning we get
[2:09:53] so busy because the devil knows how to
[2:09:56] operate he knows how to take your time
[2:10:00] up but when you're in traffic you could
[2:10:06] praise him when you're near lunchtime
[2:10:09] you could praise him when you're walking
[2:10:11] it ought to be worship can the church
[2:10:14] say Amen it was only listen when the
[2:10:19] children of Israel worshiped for God's
[2:10:21] that I ended up into captivity
[2:10:23] no wonder caught the same Exodus 20
[2:10:26] verse 2 I am THE LORD thy God which had
[2:10:29] brought thee out of the land of Egypt
[2:10:31] out of the house of bondage thou shall
[2:10:34] have no other gods before me don't start
[2:10:36] that make unto thee any graven image or
[2:10:39] any likeness of anything that is in
[2:10:42] heaven above or that is in the earth
[2:10:44] beneath or that is in the water under it
[2:10:47] thou shalt not bow down thyself to them
[2:10:50] nor serve them for I the LORD thy God am
[2:10:53] a jealous God can the church see man
[2:10:57] oh the wise men came to worship the four
[2:11:01] beasts and the twenty-four elders came
[2:11:03] to worship worship is your way of
[2:11:06] letting God know he is your God even
[2:11:09] before you pray you ought to worship
[2:11:10] that's why even when Jesus talked about
[2:11:13] the prayer he said our Father who art in
[2:11:15] heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom
[2:11:18] come thy will be done
[2:11:20] he didn't even ask for anything yet it
[2:11:23] was worship that's how real it must be
[2:11:28] to us Oh hallelujah
[2:11:31] no one that Jesus let say in viña do
[2:11:34] they worship me it just cannot be a
[2:11:36] ritual to you it cannot be a practice to
[2:11:39] you this must be a reality to you can
[2:11:41] the church say man first chronicles 16
[2:11:45] and verse 23 sing unto the Lord all you
[2:11:47] so forth from deity his salvation
[2:11:51] declare his glory among the heathen his
[2:11:54] marvelous works among all nations for
