to God oh yes he's a real God isn't he he's a real God Oh Glory Hallelujah God richly bless you amen if you have your Bibles I'd like to attention quickly to two portions of scripture Hebrews chapter 4 and 1 Corinthians 13 Glory Hebrews 4 I have one verse to read from there and um 1 Corinthians 13 I have one verse to read from there also Hebrews 4 and verse 12 reads on these wise for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two Ed sword piercing even to the dividing a s of Soul and Spirit and of the joints and Marrow and he's a deser of au thought and intents of the heart amen let me read that verse again for the word of God is quick sir that means it's strong that means it it it it's very is very incisive before you move it's got to its Target you can play around with the word you can first be fast and loose with the word the word is really precise and to the point that's what means is is quick and Powerful sharper than any to Ed so piercing even to the divid of Soul and Spirit and we're going to talk about that divid this morning amen because that's where the devil hides amen but the word of God follows and changes the devil to that divid under there so there's no hiding place for the devil not in here not in your life amen because the word of God will will find the devil wherever he's hiding can you say Amen there's no Hiding Place Satan we got news for the devil this morning he has no place to hide Hallelujah can you shout hallelujah hallelujah amen because the water God will fish him out amen and he's a h uh p even to the divid son of Soul and Spirit and of the joints and Marrow and is a designer of the thoughts and intents of the heart so whatever you're thinking of this morning whatever the problem whatever the desire the word of God knows it before you even say it and that's why people come to church on Sunday morning and the pastor say something there sure somebody told the pastor what the word of God it's quick it's sharp he knows just what's in your heart right to that Divine it can go right there and fish what your Des eyes amen what a blessing amen and 1 Corinthians 13 are you happy you get to be after last night yesterday morning you've got to be happy amen 1 Corinthians 13 this is a great chapter on the love of God like you know all the brothers have spoken about not feel your love but I Gap love verse 13 I mean verse 11 says when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child when I became a man I put away childish things now what are these childish things here childish things speak as a child understand as a child and think like a child if you notice that's in the reverse that's childish a child speaks before they understand what they're saying before they even think about it that's childish because when you do that your behavior is out of control you have no Behavior you have no life you just talk speaking is talking about Behavior your what you speak is talking about the external person your speech your life when you speak without without understanding without thinking that's childish children just do things and that's why they have so many things that they a lot of baggage but unfortunately many adults also live like that but Paul is saying here that when I became a man I put away all these childish things because God is not going to adopt children he's going to adopt men who have come to the stature of a perfect man amen can you say amen amen amen shall we bow heads word a prayer our heavenly father we thank you to be in the house this morning we thank you for the grace of God Upon Our Lives we thank you for this convention Lord we thank you for pastor oid sister Anar the great church here in Trinidad Lord we thank you Lord for the

Brother CH said brother CH has a very unique way of you know like years ago brother kman said he has a ping pong ball know when you play ping pong you have to really be on your tools because you want

that you know I'm not a preacher in the league of these brothers but different people want me to not say that so not because I believe I am but because I've been warned to stop saying that but really I'm not a preacher in the league of these brothers really I don't I don't even I don't even belong in the class you know so so I'll pretend to to preach and you pretend like you're hearing a message okay so so but you have had the word the preachers have gone ahead ahead ahead of you so let me just try and get brother over has been trying to you know upgrade me you know to know how to get away from this craps of paper that I have and you know you know do better so don't give up on me now I'm coming along go for me so this morning I hope I don't keep you too long for a few minutes I got a title um when I was a child am forgive our past and bless the future amen that direct quote from Brother Bram because brother Bram on the message um the contest 962 December 31st in praying he said Lord make us F servants forgive our past and bless our future and I just feel that we are entering a new time a new season where the blessing of God is going to overtake you amen amen and respect of that um I have a few cont scriptures but I'd like to read um one of them from Genesis 22 um if you have B can just open it I'd like to read from Genesis 22 verse 15 through Verse 18 Genesis 22 and: 15 read on these wise and the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham Out of Heaven the second time and said by myself have I sworn say the Lord for because thou Hast done this thing and has not withheld thy son th only son then in blessing I Will Bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sea which upon the seash shore and thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemies and in thy seat shall all the nation of the earth be blessed because thou has obeyed my voice amen may the Lord add his BL of your holy words amen amen amen amen can you say amen amen amen when I was a child amen well acts one it says but you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is come upon you now many times you hear Christians talk about that that that verse or that chapter because we know the Holy Spirit B what was talking about because Jesus had come he brought a brand new way of of learning a brand new way of speaking never a man speak like Jesus Christ the people testify never a man did the things on this earth like Jesus Christ did he wasn't like the scribes and fares the Sinners came they felt comfortable in his presence not because he agreed with their sin but because there was just a pres around him he was not like the scribes and the Pharisees he was sent to for that very purpose to save Sinners to win them and deliver them from their lifestyle amen little babies were comfortable with him all the ecclesiastical thing was not about him at all he was like an ordinary man people didn't even know who he was it had to take Judas to identify him to the people a man with such a great purpose on the face of the Earth God himself in human skin people didn't have a clue what he was who he was what he was there doing amen but Jesus when he died and rose again and he came back when he was going back after 40 days he gave the disciples those famous Words which was the promise he said but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you shall be witness unto me in Judea Samaria onto the uttermost parts of the earth and from that time up until now every Christian believer has that promise that promise of hanging over him the promise of the baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah but unfortunately unfortunately you don't hear the B of the Holy Ghost spoken about in our camps no more you may be seated amen you hear all this talk about brother Bram brought the Mysteries brother BR preached all the Mysteries we don't need to have one more mystery preach because brother reveal all the mystery because in the days of the voice of the seven Angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God shall be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets and malach already came and finished all the mystery if you believe that say amen hallelujah you may be seated amen amen we don't have to have one more mystery hidden Mystery un hidden Mystery whatever we don't need it because Malachi for reveal every mystery and that's good enough cor us hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah but that Prophet also tell us that once you are baptized in water in Christian baptism the promise of the Bap of the Holy Ghost hangs over you for all Time and Eternity amen hallelujah but you don't hear that spoken about again but Jesus said you are going to do that and then you're going to be my Witnesses amen hallelujah and brother bam said how men ought to be formed into the word image of Jesus Christ and of the passing of the Holy Ghost hardly anything is spoken but here we are in this meeting here and I believe today before this minut is out God is going to baptize some Souls with the baptism of fire I believe with all my heart the person of the Holy Ghost is going to pour out here today I believe that with my whole heart can you shout hallelujah amen you may be seated hallelujah amen but listen here this promise here let you understand a few things does it mean we only receive power after we are baptized the B of the Holy Ghost no no because you'll find in the Bible there are different levels of power that is talking about St John 1:12 says to as many as give them to them he give power to become the sons of God Amen you hear Romans 1:16 says amen I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ for it's the power of God unto salvation that's not the power for the B of the Holy Ghost amen so you see the different levels of power he's talking about hallelujah hallelujah and we are here this morning want to understand where our power lays because the devil is interested in knowing where your power lays the devil wants to know where your power isay because if you can find out where your power is he will cut the power off and you become like an ordinary man but you are no ordinary man you are the bread of Jesus Christ you are F of power end time holy ghost power in the form of a message on the inside of you amen you may be seated Glory Glory Glory Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah may be seated it doesn't mean that before we get the bom of the Holy Ghost we a powerless Branch it doesn't mean that is just telling you when you get B of the Holy Ghost the power raise up a little higher because Jesus said in Luke 10 his disciple he said behold I give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and overall the power of the enemy they had power already but he talking about a different kind of power a different level of power and that's what we are speaking about today hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah Glory you may be seated amen amen talking about power Jesus promised us power amen but we have power already Peter had power he cast out Devils amen he went on a missionary trip the Bible said they came back rejoicing and they said the demons were subject to us in your name and Jesus said don't Rejoice with that amen but Rejoice that your names are written in heaven amen and Peter with this great ministry casting out devils and all that this same Peter did not have enough power to stand up to a little girl this little girl said you are one of them you are a gallan said stoping young lady I don't know that man Hallelujah so he had power but his power was not enough his power could not meet every challenge that he had and I bet today this morning in this house there are believers here who have power but you feel your power is just not the challenge there are young people here who feel their power is not the challenge can I get a witness back can somebody say Amen but you shall receive power the Holy Ghost will come upon you it will baptize your soul hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated let's post a little bit here amen let's lay a little background here God like every leader every good leader every good parent amen he empowers his people for the job he has chosen them to do God brought you here to live for him God is obligated to give you what it takes to live for him because he chose you you didn't choose him he chose you so he's obligated to give you what you need to live for him Hallelujah Hallelujah I feel the holy ghost power is Hing over you Hallelujah I feel God I feel God is going to baptize some people today with the Bap of the Holy Ghost and Fire that's why we come to the Min for we want to break through every sound barrier we want to break through every sin barrier we want to possess every gate of the enemy every gate of the enemy and we will possess it we shall possess every gate we are going to possess it you are going to possess every one of your Gates can you say amen hallelujah amen you may be seated so when God talk about given power when Jesus said about I will you shall receive power he's not talking about power like we see demonstrated many place today in Christian circles he's not talking about power over another person he's not talking about power over another man amen God never gave any man the power over another man because he gave man power over the Earth not over another man no he gave man power over the Earth not man to rule over man he gave man the power over the Earth and his spirit is what rules over every man so he's not talking about controlling power he's not talking about power to control another person to control this church or that church no he's talking about power indwelling power that's going to come on the inside of you to control you and control the Earth so God like every leader every parent he gives you what you need you may be seated oh hallelujah amen so when he's talking about giving us power he's talking about empowering us amen he's not talking about power that just rides rough sh over everybody no he's not talking about power that takes over other people's rights disrespect people controls people for whatever reason he's not talking about that he's talking about holy ghost power that comes into you yourself power to control you power to control the world around you power to live in a private W Hallelujah power over the Devils power over every Spirit power over every demon power over every habit power and holy ghost power oh Hallelujah glory to God Amen when God talks about giving us power he's talking about power to do all that he has put us on the face of the Earth to do Hallelujah to fulfill our life's calling whatever it be God is talking about power to do that you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost comes upon you oh hallelujah hallelujah Glory Glory this power here that God is talking about he put this power in Adam in a seed you may be seated amen you've got to always go back to the original because like brother Roberto was someone one of Brothers about yesterday you hear a lot of lot of things spoken about today and you know from what Jesus said you ear because you don't understand the scriptures ER and coming because people do not understand the scriptures according to what Malachi forau but if you go back to the original and leave it the way the prophet said it not try to make it better it's so clear it's so plain God said let us make man in our image that's so clear there's no ambiguity about that that's very very clear can I get a witness amen hallelujah hallelujah now God he made man in the Garden of Eden in his own image Hallelujah now this power he put in Adam to operate on the face of this Earth here remember I told you when God Gave You gives you a job to do he gives you the power to do the job you might as well rest ass short on that that's right amen God call you to be a son call you to be a daughter you might as well go to rest on that you will live this Christian Life not because you have the power he promised the power Hallelujah you are not going to backslab no you are not going to go back there is not enough devils in history to make you go back on your commitment Hallelujah you are going to press your way through you are going to overcome you are going to possess every G of every devil Believers love this every young man every young woman every father every mother every brother and sister you will overcome you are going to overcome it's God's job to see to that you are going to overcome oh Hallelujah glory glory glory amen glory to God Amen so this power here that he talking about here we can running through the Bible and we see God gave this power to adamj at the very beginning to make Adam a Son of God and Adam broke every barrier there was no barrier no gate that could come before him Adam possessed it even the Bible said Adam was not deceived Adam of his own free will of his own choice went after his wife which turn out to be a type of Christ going after us but Adam was not deceived he took every gate Hallelujah and this power in Adam wasn't was in a seed God put this power in a seed now the power of a seed it all comes down to a seed amen and that's why you should be careful what seeds you listen to and we as Minister be careful seat we s because there's power in a seed hallelujah hallelujah you bring you believe a wrong seed you believe a wrong power because there's power in a seed because every seed has power within itself to reproduce itself but God in the beginning he put the power in a seed and every child is a seed every one of us began as a seed every man woman born and girl began as a seed and one thing about the seed the seed is complete every little seed is complete if it's a seed of an acor tree the acor tree is there already the stem the leaves everything is in that little seed the seity is complete the only thing that is immature and need to grow and out of that little sea will come out everything that's in the seed Hallelujah Glory Glory so the seed any seed that all is complete amen but just need to grow am it's complete even though it is immature but just needs to grow and Genesis clearly sets out for us the power of a seed Hallelujah Genesis 1 26- 28 clearly spells out the power in the seed that was in Adam Adam's seed was in his soul and your seed is in your soul but want you to see the need why you need the baptism of the Holy Ghost this morning because too many Christians are comfortable without the pass of the Holy Ghost in their lives and they think they get along just fine no you don't get along just fine have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed that was the theme of every Apostle and that is still our theme here today have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed I mean do you want to receive the Holy Ghost do you want the B of the Holy Ghost let me ask you some many how many in here want the B of the Holy Ghost let me see your hands up amen no you don't understand me raise put your hands down how many here don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost let me see your hand up and you are designed the Holy Ghost oh well you in the right place you're in the right meeting we the right season because the Holy Ghost is going to pour out upon you today by the time you leave these meetings tonight your soul is going to be fire baptized the Holy Ghost is going to come in your soul the Holy Ghost is going to step in your soul you are going to experience the mystery of the B of the Holy Ghost without sensation without sensation but person of Jesus Christ stepping into you and making you a totally brand new person Hallelujah I believe that's going to happen here today today in the name of Jesus Christ I believe it you might as well St rejoicing as well start praising God you are going to be baptized with the Holy Ghost and Fire today before this day is out you are going to receive the B of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah glory glory to God may be seated now let me ask you a question hallu where did Adam seed come from you know the story but let me just say it again and I mean you hear it from I mean from the ministers every time but let me just say it again because like second Peter 1 says even though you know them and you be established in the present truth so don't be said if I'm saying things you know as a matter of fact most of the things you hear in the message most of them you know just we bringing different perspectives to it that's why I say we don't need any one more message everything has been preed to us what we need is the power of God to make that message real in your life not just talk the message but to be a living manifestation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ Hallelujah there's a Ministry on is RO right now that's going to rock you to Perfection you are going to be perfect you are going to come to to Perfection and that's why there's a Ministry to shake you to blast your heart from the fith and the sin so you can come to Perfection we are back to the life we are back to the life and we got to preach the life and we are preaching the life we are preaching an experience you've got to have an experience you've got to have the life we are preaching that you may be see it Adam bust on the sin Genesis 1 but where was he coming from you know the story Elohim great eternal spirit well talk about that but notice the very essence of the spirit of Elohim was love l o v e agapy love not feel your love agapy love as a matter of fact feel your love is the cause of all your problems because of all my problems is why the church is sitting stunted because the church has accepted feel your love in place of a gap love Hallelujah but the holy spirit is turning that around in this hour here in this season the holy spirit is turning it around that you might run back to your first love that God Ste in the church on the day of Pentecost amen God's spirit seven per Spirits was a spirit of love and he wanted to have a man in His image but how would a spirit have an image made unto him God is a spirit and those that worship Him worship in spirit and in truth so he could not have an image of a spirit can you catch the picture of an of a spirit you can't so Elohim to be able to get his image on the earth he formed himself to what flesh in a theophany he changed his Mas for one purpose alone so he can have an image he changed his mask and became a theophany and all those seven spirits of Love put into that body called the theop it was still a spirit but now it was a body had a form and once he had a form then you could take an image of a form and it was at that spot he said let us make man in our image after our likeness what was it seven spirits in a body the spirit of love in a body is the image he's looking for Hallelujah Oh Glory Hallelujah say hallelujah somebody say hallelujah somebody huj oh you are not hearing me say hallelujah somebody hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you are going out of here free today you are going out of here free today you might as well start rejoicing might as well start dancing you are going to shake the Viper off brother OB was speaking yesterday every Viper every snake every habit before you leave this convention today you are going to shake them off Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah so seven spirits of Love con to a body called the theop and now God said we have an image now we have a body now we can for my image so God Adam B the don't believe anything else those are the new things in town don't believe it still what the prophet said amen nothing against any man but you got to be careful you got to be careful what seeds you s and what is you believe amen these not playing games this is your soul and I'm going to show you in a minute or few minutes how the devil brings all these loose ends and to get at the source of your power and weaken you and you know you have power locked in on the inside but that power cannot flow out and that power flows out you are powerless so what happened GL GL Elohim formed Adam an image of the theophany theop is the word So Adam was the word image on the face of the Earth it was an image of the theophany theop image what image on the face of the Earth and that's why we find Adam Genesis 12628 it was seven spirits it was seven spirits in a body and Adam's Body in Genesis 1228 was his soul his theophany in SE form that was Adam there a it wasn't a theophany it was a spirit man it was a theophany man not a theophany like the logos he was an image of the theophany Hallelujah he wasn't God he was an image of God my image is in my likeness but my image is not me you can never an image become me God made that so clear didn't he didn't he make that so clear let us make man in our image I'm not really worried about that amen amen so God am he put into Adam these seven spirits and what he was in Adam was the love of God put into his soul and this love of God you may be seated this love of God in Adam's Soul that's what made him in the image of God but this love of God was split up into seven spirits now I told you a seed is immature amen a seed is complete but immature but in Adam's case God dropped into his soul and Adam seed did not go through the growing process amen Adam seed bypass the maturing process and God dropped in his soul a mature seed on the spot amen So Adam came here a mature perfect seed of the seven spirits of the love of God in his soul an exact image of God on the face of the Earth he didn't have to grow into anything he bypassed that growth stage and became a perfect man on the face of the Earth with the seven spirits and the love of God in his soul projecting out a Son of God on the face of the Earth can somebody shout hallelujah Hallelujah and that was Adam Soul there was seven spirits there seven perfect Spirits not a little Buton for seven perfect Spirits the love of God in Adam Soul Hallelujah and the Bible said but God looked around there was no man to te the soil so this Lord and this power in his soul God wanted an outlet for it to do some work on the face of the Earth so God took this power this soul and put into a body in Genesis 2:7 and Man became a living soul and what was in Adam's soul in Genesis 1 126 and 28 it lived out through him through his flesh and we saw Adam walking through the garden seven spirits the love of God doing the Great Signs The Works amen a tree never died before Adam a tree was too tall Adam made it come down what was that it was the love of God speaking through those seven spirits in the Garden of Eden Hallelujah can you say amen hallelujah you cannot disconnect the love of God from the power that was operating through Adam's Body Hallelujah and Adam walked through the garden a little later Eve joined him and brother bam said Adam Spirit toward his wife Eve he anointed Eve with his what image spirit is what image Spirit the love of God R in seven perfect Spirits he anointed Eve with that say Adam was kind loving and sweet that was his spirit that was a spirit that walked through the Garden of Eden it was a loving Spirit it was a kind Spirit it was a sweet spirit can you relate think William brandham now one man that got back to Eden Hallelujah glory to God Amen but while men slept the enemy came in while men slept the enemy came in and came to the weaker vessel and walked on her over time over and over and over again until she gave away you may be seated notice when Adam became a living Soul what happened his soul Genesis 2:7 Man became a living Soul what happened immediately brother explain a spirit and a soul of this world came into Adam so Adam now had a spiritual soul with seven spirits on the inside of it and a human spirit and a flesh body yes but the object was to get what was in his soul to walk on the outside to to to to to to uh to to what he say now to walk in the garden to teal the ground so what was inside was to come out in his flesh like brotherto spoke about the vine and the branches hallelujah hallelujah Adam need to bear fruit on the outside but there was no hands no lips no legs to Bear the Fruit by the power to Bear the fruit was on the inside di so God gave him a human spirit and gave him a physical flesh body so that through his soul there be a connection with his human spirit and there'll be a connection with his flesh body and his soul will operate through the element and the operation of the human Spirit and the flesh body to do on the face of the Earth what God wants Adam soul to do can you say Amen so there was a connection there Adam soul to Adam's Spirit to Adam's flesh there was a connection there Hallelujah there was a free Channel there Adam was a Channel of communication from his soul to his Spirit to his flesh Adam's Soul was a control tower in Adam so was seven spirits in Adam so was the love of God and the love of God control his Spirit the love of God control his flesh and Adam till the soil Hallelujah and the devil was not in the picture even though he was there he was bound he was bound as bound could be because from Adam's Soul flow the love of God flow the seven spirits into his human Spirit his human Spirit was under the control of the seven spirits and from there flowed the love of God into his flesh and the love of God did the works on the face of the Earth amen of the Son of God and we saw a Son of God on the face of the Earth Genesis 126 Adam was a son Genesis 2:7 he was a manifested son Genesis 126 Adam was a born son Genesis 2:7 Adam was a positionally born son he was always a son but he had to be manifested to the world of course you are a son today you are a daughter today but the world wants to see the sons of God it's not enough to say I am a son the world want to see a manifestation of the sons of God God I want to see a manifestation you want to see a manifestation of the sons of God oh Hallelujah and that's what we are walking towards that's what we are Marching to and we are not going to rest until we see that it's not enough to make any claims you may be seated so notice what happened happen what happened there was a connection there between the soul and the spirit the flesh was just a slave just a slave to do whatever was commanded to do but there's a connection between the soul and the spirit I'll read you a few question shortly yeah and in that connection there there's a dividing as yeah in that connection there there's a spot there if the devil can get in there or or God gets in there going to determine the course of your life am so when you hear the word of God the Bible Hebrews 4 tells us when you hear the word like you're hearing this morning the word of God is quick and sharp where is going to it's not going to your head it's not going to your flesh is going to that divid that's the connection there what happens when you hear the word intellectually you hearing the message when you hear the word your intellect understands it right away what's your intellect your brain your human Spirit what is that your affection your memory your reason your imagination and conscience Hallelujah but God doesn't send the word to your conscience doesn't send the what to your human Spirit the word is headed for the soul so what happened listen here now listen now Hallelujah listen now listen listen what happens when you hear the word this morning it goes past your flesh amen but your human Spirit grabs it because you understand English language or French or or Spanish or Portuguese whatever intellectually you hear the message but your human Spirit cannot take a decis what to do with the word firstly what happens it goes into your soul because the soul is the control tower how does the word go into your soul the conscience takes that word into your soul to check up with the soul whether what you are hearing is true or not the conscience go into the soul to get an answer from the soul the control tower what he should answer back let me give you an example let me give you an example let me give you an let me give you an example young man young man you are on your you are doing your homework at night on the internet and then excuse me pornography pictures jump up it's not just a picture it's direct into your soul the devil wants to get into your soul but God didn't give the devil your soul what happens intellectually you see this this feels good but what happens immediately your conscience grabs it and goes into your soul passes that divid and asks is this right to do or not and your soul if the word of God is there says don't do it shut that thing off listen so your your conscience goes back and tells the human Spirit shut that thing off and you shut it offall hallu that's the pattern that's what happens every single time that's how the word goes to that dividing a th between Soul and Spirit can somebody shout hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God so you can see it right away you can see right away the conscience can go into the so the conscience is the sense that passes over amen that dividing line that dividing as that separating line amen and the conscience goes into the soul to check up with what's in the soul is this according to the blueprint or not is according to the word of God is according to what the message says which is in your soul amen and the Soul says no conscience goes back amen amen now your reasoning can say that's old fashion I don't believe that what happens I read from from Brother bam amen it Grieves the soul in other words your reason tell the soul to shut up and brother bam said if that happens often enough that you tell the soul to shut up you tell to shut up what happens you grieve the soul away and that's why a man becomes separated from God that's what happened in the Garden of Eden their soul was griefed away can somebody shout hallelujah hallelujah when your soul is G away you are lost out of connection with God out of contact with God but that's why Jesus came to connect us back to God hallelujah hallelujah the source of Adam's Power laid in his soul and the devil knows I got to find the source of that power I've got to disconnect them from the source of that power once he suced in disconnecting Eve from the source of the power all Eve had was a human reasoning that's correct to judge what the devil is talking about and your human reasoning doesn't have enough power in it amen to confront the devil your human reasoning only has willower human strength human energy it cannot overcome anything your human power and that's how many Christians live with their will power with their human power and that's why they sometimes up and sometimes down but Jesus said you shall receive power we will place the power right back into your soul and connect your soul and spirit back again in the name of Jesus Christ oh Hallelujah glory to God amen amen amen the word of God is sharp sharper than any so go into that div you may be seated am but what happens what happens many people even when they get saved when they get saved they don't read the Bible they don't know what the message says they just go along and leave on half tank or leave on empty and just go along and just just just tradle along like that and what happens you get your channel blocked amen because Christianity 1 Peter 3:21 says is the answer of a good conscience your conscience go into the soul and gets an answer and tells your spirit and your spirit controls the body what to do amen that happens every Split Second before you do anything that's the procedure because the soul is the control tower hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah but when Adam when Adam and his wife chose what did the devil do what did the devil do what the devil do I'm I'm just skipping ahead I'll finish shortly I shortly what the devil do let me just bring this to a close let what the devil do I I don't mean I'm closing right now watching a look at your watch I see are you taking taking taking a look at your watch get out of there I'm going to get her shortly but give me a few minutes okay I won't send I Won't Say I'm closing eight times like brother Jesse said maybe I've done it about two times already but I won't do it times just count for me when I'm close to seven just point at me so I don't hold the record but listen what was in Adam's Soul was the love of God and the devil's object was to disconnect them from the love of God the love of God is power listen when God came on the face of this Earth when the logos which was the love of God in in a in a spirit body saided doing the work of creation what what did we find we found power we found the lust spoke Let There Be and let there be he spoke and Galaxy SW and Spa into existence love spoke and created the universe love spoke and created the trees the animal life in the sea on the land love spoke and did all of that love is the creative force of God love is the creative power of God love is the power that Adam needed on the face of the Earth to live in the Garden of Eden and this love was a manifestation of seven perfect Spirits Hallelujah it wasn't human love it was God's love AAP love let me show you where human love came into the picture and almost all of us do everything but this human feel your love and we are sure we have it but the other person doesn't have it we have a gape they have F but I'm going to show you in a minute how F Your Love Came in the picture you know what F your love is but M said is the kind of love you have for your wife your husband it doesn't mean that's the kind of love you should have for them because Jesus said love one another as I have loved you did not love us with feel your love our call Christian call is a Lord but we just settle for your Lord let me show what love is when the devil came in the G of Eden to Eve this was the object was to attack the love of God because he knew that was the power and that's what the us until the when the church gets to that spot just the Divine love will drop down and all that's wrong will be taken out because that's the love of God dropping down in the Mist the love of God will drop down not love like I I have it you don't have it no the the spirit of God will drop down in your soul and all that's wrong will be taken out not one sick person will be able to stand the sick will be healed the death El will be unstopped because La drops down because Lord was the power that walked in the Garden of Eden Lord was the power that created the universe and that's why we are going back to that love that's why God sent a prophet William Bram to drive us back to the love of God not feel your love G love glory to God amen amen amen so when the devil came to Eve had God said no has said what he did he said to show Eve what she was going to get said to show Eve what was going to benefit her that God was supposedly keeping from her it was showing Eve God knows the day you eat that fruit you'll be like a god God God knows you are going to get this he doesn't want to get it this is something for you you know what's in it for me that's filo that was the problem in Eden they exchanged agape love for fil your love and brother bham said feeling love is the problem in the church that's right brother he said even lost sex adultery is a perversion of of that love the original love is a gapy love and in the Garden of Eden the devil show them feeling love what feel love was in it for me Isn't the husband and wife the husband to the wife the father to the children children to the father just think of it I don't want to get think of it just what's in it for me but Jesus said love one another as I have loved you amen look alive from the other person's perspective not from your perspective but Fe love doesn't do that Fe love is interested in his own thing love is in you treating me right if my wife treats me right then I'll treat her right Feel Love is conditional Feel Love is Performance Based if you don't perform well I won't have anything to do with you but AG Gap love is unconditional when you are good when you are bad it loves us regardless hallah hallelujah hallelujah so in the Garden of Eden the devil the serpent Lucifer exchanged by sweet words the love of God a gap love fulfill love was in it for me if you eat this fruit you are going to get this eve you're going to become like a God God's keeping this from you he said that's true just thinking it that's our life amen and from there the perion come there the man who commits adult the young man who takes what doesn't belong to him is just focus on yourself that's feeling love just focus on self and self and self alone like brother R said last night self life and brother BR said eternal life is living for others amen the only two types of life eternal life or self life and eternal life is the love of the god a gapy love and self life is f Your Love yeah so what happened so what happened God ass say this station here and said no this this doesn't look too good go so what happened was Adam and Eve had no character formation no process of going through this F development and just have Perfection dropped on their laps so to speak and they let the power drain out easy come easy go that's good so God said I will restore I'll restore this church right back I'll restore it right back to the G of Eden again but not the way I did it before no not the way I did it before because the devil succeeded in disconnecting Adam and Eve from God disconnecting their soul from the control of God Amen and that's when they became lost but Jesus I mean God came on the spot and connected them back in other words gave them salvation again not Redemption salvation they lost Redemption and God wanted them to go through a process to get back to the Redemption you are not going to get it on the spot again he was going to take a process and that process was to form character in them to make them labor to let them work hard them labor to get some character to get some behavior before they'll be gifted with this power again so God the story of the Gospel having been to get us back to this power that Adam had in the Garden of Eden to connect our souls back when Adam fell he lost that state of glory and power and became like a little child notice when God created Adam he didn't create a child he made a man in His image Adam was a man he wasn't a child wasn't a little child he was a man he bypassed that child who stage would not even know it existed until Adam fell and when Adam fell he became like a little child didn't know left from right hand anymore didn't know where he was at anymore he lost the power and God said I'll take you back there but you are going to grow through the process this time around you are going to grow from a child into adulthood and manhood again oh Hallelujah Glory that's the gospel story of redemption that's the story of redemption the growth in Grace in Jesus Christ Hallelujah and what happened there amen God he split this growth process into stages and Jesus came to make a way to connect us back to God again amen and this connecting back to God again to connect a way back for us for our soul and our spirit to remain connected when we are born in this worldall here our souls are andrain from God our souls are just doing the dictates of our minds we are doing what we want not what the word of God tells us to do we are separated from God our souls are lost not in contact with God but Jesus comes and comes to your life maybe you get saved one day and what happens just the word of God come into your soul you repent you give your heart to Jesus Christ what happens you become a baby in Jesus Christ you become like Adam and Eve when they were restored by God In the Garden of Eden right am and what happens your soul that was lost from God is connected back to God again connected back to God again you and God can have a channel now God can speak to you and you can speak back to God but that's not enough enough that's not enough that's not enough because in that channel that power that comes from that channel is not powerful enough to face all the things the devil will throw at you because your channel has been clogged up and that's why it takes you the next step of sanctification to clean up the channel day in day out dying out and clean up the channel clean up the channel to where the Holy Ghost can have a free flow between your soul and your spirit to to to free up the channel of the field and the ungodliness free it up Hallelujah glory to God Amen Hallelujah and when that child is fed up he said now you are going to receive the Holy Ghost and let me tell you why the Holy Ghost Bap is so important you can be saved I can assure you your life of Salvation saved justified by faith is not enough you experience it you know it you know yourself you know it's not enough you you you have power because there's power in your soul but this power for an outlet to control your flesh but this Outlet is still clogged up with stuff and that's why sanation com in there to to to unplug the outlet so the power in the soul can have a free flow but when you are baptized with the Holy Ghost this is what happens there the person of the Holy Ghost is the power to connect your soul and your spirit together and nothing can separate them again am nothing can separate them again the Holy Spirit comes into your soul and the Holy Spirit anoints the seed in your soul anoints the word in your soul and out of that word breaks out the power and that power flows through your channel into your spirit to control your flesh body that's why you need the Holy Ghost baptism without the Holy Ghost you are just hoping so without the B of the Holy Ghost you can you are not guaranteed of power you're not guaranteed of constant Victory Hallelujah without the prop of the Holy Ghost our young people are the control or the the Haren stance of their friends in school amen amen but with the Bas of the Holy Ghost amen the channel is cleared amen Jesus comes back in your soul in the control tower and he controls the channel the power flows from your soul into your human Spirit into your flesh body oh Hallelujah the power like Adam had in Eden Oh Glory to God amen amen amen glory to God Amen oh Hallelujah so there are many Christians today amen saved Christians but they just can't find the power amen they do things they'd rather not do amen and they going for adoption amen ministers Deacons name it fathers mothers young people because we are lacking the power of the spirit of God and when the person ghost come to your soul that becomes a man in Christ just creation makes you a baby in Christ but the holy spirit makes you a man in Christ and this man now stats to Art the statue of Jesus Christ to a perfect man to where you get back like Adam was in the Garden of Eden amen oh Hallelujah glory to God Amen oh brother brother amen my context here I've got to say that Georges 134 15 and 16 somethings Sams like a Christian believer today watch something something had a lifestyle Thea didn't just happen upon something something had a certain lifestyle somethings was a Christian like a Christian but he had a lifestyle of sin yes and didn't bother him you know the reason why because when something shakes himself the power he feels the power again something forgot that actions have consequences all the time but what happen is that many times the consequences take time that's right before you get the result of Your Action and so because of that human beings that we are we don't remember the action that got us the consequence that's correct so something for a long time was going on empty was living on empty but had a certain lifestyle and that's how many Christians are no life a m can get on the platform he speaks and you know people are all over the place there and he has no life The Mystery of the foral and ones at the end time amen amen something was there for a long time something Shake himself when the time comes he feels the power but he was disconnected from God totally disconnected from God Samson told his parents I seen a girl get her for me to marry man said no he said get her for me to marry and the parents obeyed him and got in the girl to marry and he had problem after problem with his lifestyle he killed a lion saw some horny in it and gave a riddle to the guys and they said who what's stronger than a uh uh what's stronger than than um uh um um what's sweeter than than honey and what's stronger than the than than than a lion and give them a ridle he was just it was just was just having a time of his life but just leaving as carelessly as they come and friends too much has been invested too much has been invested in this gospel for us to live like that too much I know you don't hear it anymore people don't preach about the life they're just telling you about the Mysteries you are going to be adopted and you are you know whatever you are the Holy Ghost whatever but it doesn't work like that am but b t us there's a maturing there's a character formation process there's a character formation process to where you die out of yourself amen like he told us last night about going through Jordan going through Jordan and dying to self and forming the character forming the image of Jesus Christ in your life even by a revelation while you are looking for the spirit to come down Hallelujah glory to God amen amen amen so Samson he went on like this for so long but one thing you got to understand one day one day the gas is going to run out Samson's lifestyle eventually caught up with him that's right eventually caught up with him something there to face the the fact that I need something more I can't live on borrowed strength I can't live on this this I can't keep going on empty and that's like you and I today we need power amen the holy ghost power in our lives in your life young man you don't need more Revelation on the word no you don't need more Revelation you need an experience with Jesus Christ for the power of God to fire baptize you for somebody to step into your soul oh Hallelujah glory to God Amen you need power in your life and that's why I'm telling you today something got to the point he finally cut up with him amen Delila said you don't love me if you love me you will not hide your power from me brother bam said the devil is always looking for the source of the church's power the source of your power is your seven spirits your seven lots of air and that's in your soul the devil is always looking for that and what the devil does he goes into that soul with his false teachings to mix up the power and once it does that you are disconnected from God and your soul gets away let me read you a quote from Brother bam here glory glory to God Amen hallelujah amen brother bam said here on the message the sound um he said notice the woman carries on talking about a woman who is leaving however she wants to leave she thinks she's all right after a while she leaves her husband she goes off and marries this traveling salesman because he's a handsome big fellow and after a while she finds that he's not the man that her husband was see he's not kind like her husband was and after a while she thinks oh well I've done that I'll fall in love with somebody else no this something lifestyle she goes on you may not do this here but you know maybe you don't even have a prayer life you don't no character no life and we don't hear that preach anymore amen she goes on she travels on she goes to church continually the pastor has has never took a name from from the book she goes right on to church she lives like she wants to live and the first thing you know oh and you say now look Mrs do do you believe in Jesus Christ with all my heart I believe in it but I action are fruits my brother J spoke yesterday she had no connection to the vine amen amen amen this Branch was just living on his own so he had no fruits to show a fruits showed she didn't she wasn't connected with the vine amen so she said don't uh uh but she had no fruits to show her her her fruits proed that she's not connected don't listen to an uncertain sound let it sound out from the gospel here proes that she's not for she wouldn't be doing them things if she was connected that's she wouldn't be acting that way she would have different thoughts she would be governed by a different thing in her soul amen the governing Center the control center the first time she grieved her soul back there when she started out Runing around on her husband he is her intellect here her mind her spirit here is her soul here there's a separating line there that if it ever crosses it will never cross back again that's right it will never come again think on it and she keeps on and after a while when she sins against this thing on the inside of her she keep sing against her soul that speaks to her about the word of God the first thing you'll know you'll become all involved in this intellect when you tell the soul to shut up shut up shut up you just operate from your human mind your reasoning that's all you pray not the word of God no more just your reasoning some teaching some Doctrine some some sin some sensation just reason it out with your mind not what the holy spirit in the soul is telling you amen amen amen the Bible said the soul that sinth th Soul shall die that means to separate then the Soul the conscience that once condemns you that conscience that goes from your spirit check up with your soul that once condemns you isn't there anymore and you've gone all together into intellectual you go join some old cold formal church that don't believe in those things on out to hog eat hog and the first thing you know the soul that condemns you for the first time you told a lie the first time you put on those sh clothes CL the first time you did immoral acts will become so dead to you you won't feel it anymore on and on you'll go and after a while death will catch up with you you are living out yonder your pastor will come and say all things are all right my sister you're ready to go now everything all right why with all the reasoning power she has she has gone to church she has given to charity she's done everything that's right she thinks so everything that's right in her mind she has followed the dictates of her mind amen and many people live just following the dictates of their mind just follow dict of their mind what brother bam said don't matter no more what the scripture says don't matter no more that there's no power in the church young people are like resigned to leave any kind of a life amen even adult still she has F this of her mind I know I should go to church I know I should be friendly I know I should treat my neighbor right I know I should do this and that intellect willpower amen but still what is it she has gried away the soul and then the hour of her death when she gets where to die she's laying on the bed and all at once she wake up she wakes up and holders oh my God I'm lost the pastor will say give her a hippo she's delirious and he'll shoot a hippo in in it and she'll try to speak she can't speak she'll M what is it her soul has caught up with her that's right what the is saying here when people have a lifestyle of sin and wrong and falsehood and ungodliness brother it gries the soul and you can so grieve the soul away and that's why that's is that's a Miss in Christianity Today that's right so many different groups even Among Us in the message but everybody is convinced they right somebody or some of the groups or all of us have grieved this Spirit way still We only listen to our mind the dict of our mind but the word of God cannot have everybody right and everybody is saying different things can I hear an amen Amen brother brah is showing you here the secret how you can say anything and you feel very good about it and it's all wrong your lifestyle is wrong your teaching is wrong and you feel very comfortable about it because you have gried away the Holy Spirit you have G away the soul because the soul is not going to fight with you he's going to war you and tell him shut up shut up this what the prophet said this is what the Bible said this is what the prophet said and you want to do your thing the soul goes away and you are L with your intellect your mind so you feel my group is right that one feels my group is right while we have gried away the Holy Spirit we have gried away the words of the prophet and the connection we have been disconnected from God if you preach falsehood you are disconnected from God and you got to make it right Amen to be connected back to God and when you repent repentance is the twofold thing you acknowledge your sin and you turn away from it you don't just turn away from it without acknowledging David said for I acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me if I don't acknowledge it it always stays there I can't get away from it I've got to acknowledge it before I can turn away from it can you say Amen am hallelujah hallelujah glory to God amen amen amen oh Hallelujah let me finish this quote here when she's going to die because it's a soul that's going to give account to God but bam is saying here people let the human Spirits lead them so long and when they die the human Spirit doesn't go in the presence of God Spirit disintegrates into the atmosphere but the soul that you are told to shut up that you have made a sinner out of it comes back to you and shows you your life and that's he's going to answer the God and that's what he see many people as was the kind an episode he saw where the lady was dying and she had lived a lifestyle so wrong and because she wouldn't listen her conscience got tired her conscience became weak became defiled her soul took its leave and when she was dying she saw a lifesty before her and she wasn't ready for God then and she was crying crying please I'm lost I'm lost that's what he's saying here her soul has caught up with her before death not only women men who spun the love of Jesus Christ who has Tor him down made fun of it it will catch up with you someday I stand I'm standing here this morning you gri this so far you can't feel it no more but it'll catch up sometime again it will come back to you the da things the bad things the tattling the B the Babbling the back Bing the selfishness and things that you've done that will all come back to you someday laying on the de how the hippo needle in those days has stopped the death confession of thousands what is it his soul has cut up with him there that Soul and Spirit is this thin hair that the intellectual mind is fixing is fixing to fail it's only in the mind the intellectual what you live by is going to perish but that soul that you've griefed from your intellect is going to haunt you through eternity amen don't listen to that uncertain sound you believe the gospel in its fullness amen you say I went a church I do what was right I paid my th those things are all about us in ual and look when you are trying to stop with that Hipp needle let them be numbed up so they don't know nothing and they are trying to speak their soul has caught up with them they realize that they are reasoning their mind is perishing with their brain perishing with their brain the mind yes sir your mind will perish with your with your the death I'll prove it to you amen and it goes on it goes on so your intellect will die when your brain ceas to function when the blood fails to pour through the brain and the nerve sees then your mind goes away and your soul catches up with you he's just trying to tell you here like that we live by our intellect many times and we figure out with intellect and we cut off the soul cut off the word of God but that intellect will vanish when we are living here amen amen I'm just want to make you see a picture and I'm fixing to close amen all right so this woman here that hippo needle CAU of a confession like she wants to repent mayy they put a hippo in her and she says I'm lost I'm lost I'm lost and she you came from here you came out of Eternity you st into a little space called time you go out of time into eternity and that what you are in your soul as you go out that same you will be oh my all right what are you saying here preacher what are you saying here preacher when Adam sin became like a little child disconnected from the soul disconnected from the control of God in the soul a little child when I was a child I spake as a child behavior out of control totally out of control do what you want to do a little child you can't tell each other about Behavior little child just behaves however they want to behave and when Adam sinned he was like a little child Sam sin like a little child just Liv any kind of a lifestyle amen amen but the Bible said when I became a man and I'm saying that God when he saw that he said no what we're going to do we are going to send this power back in them in stages the power of salvation for us when they receive Christ we're going to connect that soul and that Spirit together again and then by sanation we're going to try and clear that channel and when the channel has been cleared we're going to baptize them with the Holy Ghost and the person of the Holy Ghost connects Channel and keep it
