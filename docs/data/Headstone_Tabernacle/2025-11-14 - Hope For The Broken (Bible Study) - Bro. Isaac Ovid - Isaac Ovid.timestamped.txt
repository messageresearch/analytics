[0:02] Praise God. God bless you all tonight in
[0:05] a special way. Amen. We are grateful to
[0:09] be in his presence [music] tonight.
[0:11] Amen. We thank God for his grace. Amen.
[0:14] Let's just bow our heads as we want to
[0:15] start in the word of prayer tonight and
[0:18] ask God's blessing upon us and our Bible
[0:20] study tonight by the grace of God. Amen.
[0:23] Let's just bow our heads. Heavenly
[0:24] Father, we thank you Lord to be in your
[0:26] presence Lord to be gathered together
[0:29] virtually. Father, Lord, wherever your
[0:32] your word is, oh God. Father, there is
[0:34] where you are Lord. Your spirit is there
[0:35] drawing us near, teaching us, Father,
[0:38] helping us, Lord, by and by. Lord, we
[0:42] thank you for your presence tonight.
[0:43] Lord, we pray you bless each one tonight
[0:45] as they come in, Lord, to this virtual
[0:49] room.
[0:50] Lord, as they plug into this word
[0:52] session tonight, we pray that your
[0:54] presence will come down in a special
[0:56] way. Bless us and help us,
[0:58] [clears throat] Lord, Father. Lord, we
[1:01] look to you, Lord. Our eyes are upon
[1:03] you, Lord, Father, that you would help
[1:05] us, Lord, in our time of need that you
[1:07] would give us a word in due season,
[1:09] Lord, to instruct us and to show us,
[1:12] Lord, uh, instruct us in righteousness,
[1:14] Lord, and show us the path. Granted,
[1:16] Almighty God, we lean on you now, Lord.
[1:19] We pray that your presence come as we
[1:21] sing and anoint us and inspire us. Pray
[1:23] that your word would come in a mighty
[1:24] way, Lord, that would teach us and help
[1:26] us. Father, may you just have your way
[1:28] in this session tonight. We pray and ask
[1:31] it in your precious name, Jesus Christ.
[1:34] Amen. And amen. Praise God. Hallelujah.

[1:40] you, Father.

[14:31] [music]
[14:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:34] Thank you so much, brother Anthony.
[14:36] [music] God bless you, church. It's such
[14:38] a great privilege
[14:41] and an honor to be here tonight one more
[14:43] time in the presence of the Lord.
[14:46] Uh can we just bow our heads for a word
[14:49] of prayer? Our gracious heavenly father,
[14:51] we thank you tonight, Lord, on this 14th
[14:55] day of November, Lord, for this
[14:57] opportunity that you are provided by
[14:59] your grace. Lord, to be able to gather
[15:03] as a body of believers.
[15:05] Lord, we thank you for your love, for
[15:07] your mercy. Lord, we thank you for
[15:09] identifying yourself to us, Lord, so
[15:12] that there's something in us that is
[15:14] responding to the call, Lord. There are
[15:16] so many in the room tonight, Lord.
[15:18] different situations, different needs,
[15:20] different requests, different
[15:22] conditions, different struggles,
[15:24] different challenges. But we are here
[15:25] tonight, Lord, to hear a word from you.
[15:28] To hear a word in due season that would
[15:31] encourage us, would inspire us, would
[15:33] give us insight into the word that we
[15:35] may not have seen before, or maybe we
[15:37] saw it, but not quite in this light. May
[15:39] your light shine upon the word tonight.
[15:42] May you open our understanding to the
[15:44] scriptures. May you strengthen us as a
[15:46] body of believers, Lord. May you reach
[15:48] out during Lord even this prayer and the
[15:51] study that would follow Lord to touch
[15:54] those that are in the audience tonight
[15:56] this virtual audience Lord even those
[15:58] who may listen to the recording I know
[16:01] something is special is about to take
[16:03] place Lord may you touch those that are
[16:05] weary touch those that are sick touch
[16:07] those that are struggling those that had
[16:09] a very tough week those that had a tough
[16:10] day those that are facing different
[16:13] challenges different trials different
[16:15] obstacles whatever situation it might
[16:17] Lord, we want to commit, Lord, the
[16:19] church into your hands. The believers
[16:21] into your hands. Any visitors that are
[16:24] here into your hands. Anyone that would
[16:26] come into contact with this into your
[16:28] hands. Father, we pray a special
[16:30] blessing on our pastor Lord and
[16:32] ministering there Nigeria. We pray that
[16:35] you would Lord anoint him Aresh, inspire
[16:37] him, aresh. May you bless the ministry
[16:40] Lord of this church, Lord. May you bless
[16:42] the believers around the world, Lord,
[16:44] that are looking for your soon coming.
[16:46] May you touch the afflicted, touch the
[16:48] downtrodden. May you lift up your people
[16:51] tonight, Lord. May you heal the
[16:53] brokenhearted tonight. May you restore
[16:55] faith, restore confidence, restore zeal,
[16:58] restore passion to please you, to serve
[17:00] you, to understand you, Lord. We commit
[17:02] the teaching into your hands. May you
[17:03] take me out of the way, Lord. Bring my
[17:06] thoughts, my words under subjection to
[17:08] your Holy Spirit. And may only what you
[17:10] once said be said tonight, Lord. May you
[17:12] bless the reading of the word. Bless the
[17:14] hearing of the word tonight. We commit
[17:15] the service into your hands in the
[17:17] precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And
[17:19] amen and amen. It's certainly a great
[17:21] privilege to be here one more time
[17:23] tonight. Uh so happy that you're all
[17:25] here. There's still time for you to
[17:27] invite someone to the session tonight.
[17:30] And uh if you are um in a position to
[17:32] put on your cameras to join um to give
[17:36] some fire in the service as it were, we
[17:38] appreciate it. It encourages us. It
[17:40] gives us some uh immediate feedback. So
[17:42] we we understand what's happening and we
[17:44] are delighted to have the opportunity to
[17:47] be invited into your homes uh at this
[17:49] time to be able to bring a word from the
[17:52] Lord. Um the Bible is the word of God.
[17:55] We stand by the word of God and and we
[17:58] are in a very unique position because
[17:59] not only do we have the written word but
[18:01] we have spiritual insight as the Bible
[18:03] as a new book to have the revealed word
[18:06] and to have a messenger that could speak
[18:08] life to us through the word. So tonight
[18:11] I am excited uh because we are going
[18:14] into a piece of study here that I know
[18:17] many have not had time perhaps to look
[18:19] at or may have not had the opportunity
[18:21] to look at but when I stumbled upon it
[18:24] it was an encouragement to me and I
[18:26] believe it's an it will be an
[18:27] encouragement to all tonight as well. I
[18:29] want to encourage you don't take this
[18:32] lightly. Don't take it for granted.
[18:33] Don't take it casually. I want to
[18:35] encourage you to join us for a journey
[18:38] tonight in the word so that it would
[18:41] strengthen your faith. It is designed to
[18:43] encourage you, to give you hope, to
[18:45] remind you that God has not forgotten
[18:46] you, to remind you that God is in
[18:48] control. And to remind you that no
[18:50] matter what struggle, what trial, what
[18:52] situation you are going through, God has
[18:55] already made provision for it. And what
[18:57] blows me away as you look deep into
[18:59] scripture is how things are connected.
[19:01] Sometimes we underestimate the
[19:03] connections. We underestimate the prayer
[19:05] from 10 years ago or 15 years ago or or
[19:08] the person who said a prayer for you or
[19:10] said a word about you and and and we're
[19:13] going to see some of that tonight by the
[19:15] grace of God. Certainly happy to be here
[19:18] one more time and for a Bible study
[19:21] tonight. Our theme or our topic is is is
[19:25] going to be hope for the broken. A Bible
[19:27] study on hope for the broken. and you
[19:29] will understand it as it unfolds um what
[19:33] we are beginning to address here and um
[19:36] we are looking forward by the grace of
[19:38] God to have a wonderful time in the
[19:40] presence of the Lord tonight. So, hope
[19:42] for the broken and we're going to start
[19:43] as a foundation. We're going to start as
[19:46] a foundation
[19:47] um with David and Jonathan just to lay a
[19:50] bit of a background for us tonight to
[19:52] get somewhere and maybe to get to a name
[19:54] tonight that many may not have heard,
[19:56] but there's a mystery in there. There's
[19:58] some encouragement in there tonight. So,
[20:01] I want if you have your Bibles, you
[20:02] start. We're going to start in 1 Samuel
[20:05] in chapter 18 tonight. Um, again, get
[20:09] excited. Tell somebody we're in Bible
[20:11] study. We're in church tonight. And, uh,
[20:13] we're looking for God to do something
[20:15] special for us. So, for way of a
[20:17] background, we're going to start in 1st
[20:19] Samuel chapter 18 just to lay a
[20:21] foundation. And then we're going to keep
[20:23] building. We're going to move through
[20:24] quite a number of different areas. We
[20:26] have quite a bit of a structure here
[20:28] tonight by the grace of God to help us
[20:29] see a few things. So 1st Samuel
[20:34] 18 and from verse one.
[20:41] And it came to pass when he had made an
[20:44] end of speaking unto Saul
[20:48] that the soul of Jonathan which is
[20:50] Saul's son was knit connected with the
[20:54] soul of David. And Jonathan loved him as
[20:57] his own soul.
[20:59] And Saul took him that day and would not
[21:02] let him go no more
[21:05] to his father's house. Then Jonathan and
[21:08] David made a covenant. And I want us to
[21:10] look at that word covenant. Made a
[21:13] covenant because he loved him as his own
[21:16] soul.
[21:18] And Jonathan stripped himself of the
[21:20] robe that was upon him. This is very
[21:22] symbolic.
[21:24] and gave it to David and his garments,
[21:27] even to his sword. So he is taken away
[21:29] because your robe and your garment and
[21:32] your sword is everything that identifies
[21:34] who you are as a soldier. Your identity,
[21:36] your clothes. Bear in mind, Jonathan is
[21:38] the son of the king. This is the son of
[21:40] King Saul as it were. He is a king and
[21:44] he is basically stripping away what
[21:46] would be his princely garment, his
[21:49] princely apparel, his princely
[21:51] mechanisms as it were even to his sword
[21:54] and to his bow and to his girdle. And
[21:57] David went out with usoever Saul sent
[22:00] him and behaved himself wisely. And Saul
[22:04] set him over the men of war. and he was
[22:07] accepted in the sight of all the people
[22:09] and also in the sight of Saul's
[22:11] servants. So I want us to understand as
[22:14] a foundation here, this is David's
[22:16] ministry beginning to rise. This is
[22:18] David's ministry beginning to be
[22:20] recognized. This is David's ministry
[22:22] beginning to be acknowledged. And at
[22:24] this point in time, Saul doesn't yet see
[22:26] him as a threat. There is no issue. We
[22:28] would know that the message or the story
[22:30] of David is one of the most complex in
[22:33] scripture. There's David running.
[22:35] There's David hiding. There's David
[22:37] making mistakes. There's David with
[22:38] Goliath. There's David with Bath Sheba.
[22:40] There's a lot to be studied here with
[22:41] David. But at this particular point in
[22:43] his journey, his ministry is on the
[22:45] rise. He is being recognized, but not to
[22:48] the point yet that Saul considers him a
[22:51] threat until verse six. And it says,
[22:54] "And it came to pass as they came when
[22:55] David was returned from the slaughter of
[22:57] the Philistine that the woman, and I
[22:59] always say this is where this trouble
[23:00] started, came out of all cities of
[23:03] Israel, singing and dancing to meet King
[23:05] Saul with tabrets with joy and with
[23:08] instruments of music. And the women
[23:10] answered one another as they played and
[23:13] said, Saul had slain thousands and David
[23:17] his 10 thousands." Now the first line of
[23:19] the song was not the problem. When they
[23:22] started the song, Saul felt good. Saul
[23:24] had slain his thousand. You could
[23:26] imagine the small smile on King Saul's
[23:29] face. But it's when the second line of
[23:31] the verse was sung and David his 10,000,
[23:34] you could see when the smile slowly is
[23:37] is moving away from a smile into where
[23:40] is this going, right? And verse 8, and
[23:43] Saul was very wroth, and the saying
[23:46] displeased him, and he said, they have
[23:48] ascribed unto David 10 thousands, and to
[23:51] me they have ascribed but thousands.
[23:54] Now, on a certain level, we could raise
[23:56] the point they're dealing here in the
[23:57] thousands, but is the the difference in
[24:00] the thousands what the issue is, right?
[24:02] To show you what carnal comparison could
[24:04] look like. Now, our study tonight is not
[24:06] about Saul and David really, but it's to
[24:08] just lay a foundation because in the
[24:10] midst of this, we started this by
[24:12] talking about how Jonathan was knit to
[24:15] David, which meant he saw something even
[24:18] before this that Saul did not see. Are
[24:21] we together? He saw something about
[24:23] David that allowed him to symbolically,
[24:27] I want us to appreciate it, transfer his
[24:30] princely garment, his princely sword,
[24:34] his princely bow, his princely girdle.
[24:37] In other words, it was as if he was
[24:38] dressing David as if David was already
[24:41] prince. Are you with are you with me? He
[24:43] was already giving up almost
[24:45] symbolically by revelation that I'm
[24:48] giving to the rightful prince what
[24:49] should be his. Are we together? All
[24:51] right.
[24:52] So with that as our foundation, I also
[24:54] want us to remember the point in verse
[24:56] three. Then Jonathan and David made a
[24:59] covenant. All right. So this is the
[25:01] foundation. So we're going to move now
[25:03] from 1st Samuel 18 to 1st Samuel 20 just
[25:08] two chapters down. This is still in the
[25:10] foundation.
[25:12] And we are going to take it from
[25:17] verse one.
[25:19] Now, this jumps forward into the story.
[25:21] So, if we were watching this as a
[25:23] timeline, for lack of a better word, a
[25:25] movie, we have now fast forwarded to
[25:27] David now under the pressure of Saul,
[25:30] King Saul already after him. Are we
[25:33] together? All right. So, Saul is out to
[25:35] get him. He's under the pressure. And
[25:37] the Bible said, "And David fled from
[25:39] Naoth in Rama and came and said before
[25:42] Jonathan, what have I done?
[25:45] What is my iniquity?
[25:47] What is my sin before thy father that he
[25:50] seeketh my life? And he said unto him,
[25:54] God forbid that thou shalt not die.
[25:57] Behold, this is Jonathan speaking, "My
[25:59] father will do nothing either great or
[26:01] small, but that he would show it to me.
[26:03] And why should my father hide this thing
[26:06] from me? It is not so." So here it is.
[26:09] Jonathan, his friend, they already have
[26:13] a covenant established. We estab we read
[26:15] that two chapters ago. is saying it is
[26:18] not so my father don't want to kill you
[26:20] I know you're feeling a certain kind of
[26:21] way I know you think something going on
[26:23] and it's all in your head but David is
[26:25] spiritual he's understanding there's
[26:27] something that's shifting in the
[26:28] tectonic place as it were and David
[26:30] swear moreover verse three and said thy
[26:32] father certainly know it that I have
[26:35] found grace in thine eyes
[26:37] and he said let not Jonathan know this
[26:39] in other words he's saying your father
[26:41] wouldn't tell you if you coming to get
[26:42] me anybody with me so we building into
[26:45] something now
[26:46] lest he be grieved. But truly as the
[26:48] Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth,
[26:50] there is but a step between me and
[26:52] death. So David is saying the way
[26:54] looking from where I am, I am one foot
[26:56] from the grave because the king wants to
[26:59] get me. Right? Then said Jonathan unto
[27:02] David, whatsoever thy soul desireth, I
[27:04] will even do it for thee. So in other
[27:06] words, let me know how I could help you
[27:09] at this point. And David said unto
[27:11] Jonathan, "Behold, tomorrow is the new
[27:13] moon, and I should not fail to sit with
[27:16] the king at me." In other words, it is
[27:18] expected that I am at the king's meal.
[27:21] It is expected, and I'm present, but let
[27:24] me go that I may hide myself in the
[27:27] field unto the third day at even at the
[27:30] evening. If thy father at all miss me,
[27:34] then say, David earnestly asks, leave of
[27:37] me that he might go to Bethlehem as
[27:39] seately, for there's a yearly sacrifice
[27:41] there for all the family. If he say thus
[27:44] it is well, in other words, if King Saul
[27:46] say no, no problem. David has something
[27:48] to do. No problem. I don't have a
[27:50] problem with it. If he say thus it is
[27:51] well, thy servant shall have peace. I'll
[27:54] be fine. In other words, let me know how
[27:56] your father responds to me not being
[27:58] present at the dinner. But if he be very
[28:02] wroth, then be sure that evil is
[28:05] determined by him. Therefore, thou shalt
[28:08] deal kindly with thy servant. In other
[28:10] words, if you help me in this matter, I
[28:13] know you already have my back. For thou
[28:15] has brought thy servant into I want us
[28:18] to look at the word here again, a
[28:19] covenant of the Lord with thee. So David
[28:22] is acknowledging the conversation we are
[28:25] having is based on the covenant that was
[28:27] already established in chapter 18. Are
[28:30] we together? Yeah. So he's referencing
[28:34] as a foundation for this co this
[28:36] conversation. Thou has brought thy
[28:38] servant into a covenant of the Lord with
[28:41] thee. So already he is saying there's
[28:43] three parties to this covenant. The Lord
[28:46] is in the covenant. You Jonathan is in
[28:48] the covenant and I am also in the
[28:50] covenant. All right?
[28:53] Not withstanding if there be in me
[28:55] iniquity. So David is saying to
[28:57] Jonathan, Jonathan, I want you to hear
[28:59] me out. If something is wrong with me,
[29:02] David, slay me thyself. In other words,
[29:05] I prefer if something is wrong with me,
[29:07] you kill me than your father kill me.
[29:11] For why should this thou bring me to thy
[29:13] father? Everybody with me? We're
[29:15] building a foundation here. And I want
[29:16] us to see the dialogue between Jonathan,
[29:19] between David and Saul. Is there any in
[29:21] the picture? And Jonathan said, "Far be
[29:24] it from me. If I knew certainly that
[29:28] evil were determined by my father to
[29:30] come unto thee, then would not I tell it
[29:33] thee?" Then said David to Jonathan, "Who
[29:37] shall tell me? Or what if thy father
[29:39] answer thee roughly?" So David is saying
[29:42] here, "How will I know the outcome of
[29:44] this scenario that I painted? I'm not
[29:46] there at the dinner. I want to know the
[29:48] outcome. Is there a way you could let me
[29:50] know how your father responded to my
[29:52] absence? Are we together? And Jonathan
[29:55] said unto David, "Come and let us go out
[29:57] into the field." And they both went out,
[30:00] both of them into the field. And
[30:01] Jonathan said unto David, "Oh Lord, God
[30:04] of Israel, when I have sounded my father
[30:07] about tomorrow, anytime or the third
[30:09] day, and behold, if there be good toward
[30:12] David, and I send not unto thee, and
[30:14] show it thee, the Lord do so much more
[30:17] to Jonathan." So he's promising to get
[30:20] feedback back to David. But if it
[30:22] pleased my father to do the evil, then I
[30:24] will show it thee and send thee away. In
[30:26] other words, I'm promise promising you
[30:28] to give you the feedback to let you know
[30:30] the truth of the matter and to let you
[30:32] know to run for your life protect
[30:34] yourself that thou mayest go in peace
[30:36] and the Lord be with thee as he had been
[30:38] with my father. And thou shalt not only
[30:41] while yet I live show me the kindness of
[30:43] the Lord that I die not. But listen
[30:45] carefully and this is where the covenant
[30:47] is being layered here that we're going
[30:49] to get to in a bit. So basically
[30:51] Jonathan is spiritually seeing so much
[30:54] into David that in this conversation
[30:57] with David, he's beginning to protect
[30:59] his family. I want us to catch this now
[31:01] because we're going to get to something.
[31:02] So Jonathan is saying with what I'm
[31:04] doing here for you, I don't want you to
[31:06] forget this and I don't want you to
[31:08] forget my family. Any anybody with me?
[31:11] Yeah.
[31:14] But verse 15, but also thou shalt not
[31:17] cut off thy kindness for my house
[31:20] forever. So he's making David
[31:24] uh almost like a another line in the
[31:26] contract of the covenant that with what
[31:28] I'm doing here, I want you to pledge to
[31:30] me, David. No matter what happens, you
[31:32] will look out for my family.
[31:37] when the Lord had cut off the enemies of
[31:39] David, everyone from the face of the
[31:41] earth. So Jonathan is actually
[31:43] prophesying. He's saying there's coming
[31:44] a time that the Lord will cut off
[31:46] everyone of David's enemies. Are we
[31:49] seeing this? Right? [laughter] That's
[31:51] verse 15. So Jonathan made a covenant.
[31:54] So now this is another covenant. He's
[31:56] making a covenant on top of a covenant.
[31:58] So Jonathan made a covenant with the
[32:00] house of David, saying, "Let the Lord
[32:03] even require it at the hand of David's
[32:06] enemies.
[32:07] Let's go. And Jonathan caused David to
[32:10] swear again. In other words, pledge this
[32:12] thing again because he loved him. For he
[32:15] loved him as he loved his own soul. Then
[32:17] Jonathan said to David, "Tomorrow is the
[32:19] new moon and thou shalt be missed
[32:22] because thy sheets thy seat shall be
[32:24] empty. And when thou hast stayed three
[32:26] days, then shall go down, thou shalt go
[32:29] down quickly, and come to the place
[32:31] where thou didest hide thyself when the
[32:33] business was in hand, and shall remain
[32:35] by the stone eel. And I will shoot three
[32:38] arrows on the side thereof, as though I
[32:40] shot at a mark. So I'll be aiming and
[32:41] shooting the arrows. And behold, I will
[32:43] send the lad, saying, go find the
[32:45] arrows. If I say unto the lad, behold,
[32:48] the arrows are on this side, take them.
[32:51] Then come thou, for there is peace to
[32:53] thee, and no hurt. In other words, if I
[32:55] shoot the arrow and it's on that side,
[32:57] then it's okay. You could come, there's
[32:59] peace, no hurt, as the Lord liveth. But
[33:01] if I say thus unto the young man,
[33:03] behold, the arrows are beyond thee,
[33:05] meaning all the way, go thy way, for the
[33:08] Lord had sent thee away, and as touching
[33:10] the matter which thou and I have spoken,
[33:12] be behold, the Lord be between thee and
[33:14] me forever. So Jonathan is saying this
[33:18] is the code with which we will
[33:20] communicate. But I want to close off
[33:22] this conversation with the matter which
[33:24] thou and I have spoken which is about me
[33:28] and my family. Behold the Lord be
[33:30] between thee and me forever. Are we
[33:33] together?
[33:35] So David I want to wrap up this part. So
[33:37] David hid himself in the field and when
[33:39] the new moon was come the king sat down
[33:41] to eat meat and the king sat upon his
[33:43] seat as at other times even upon a seat
[33:45] by the wall. And Jonathan arose, and
[33:48] Abnner sat by Saul's side, and David's
[33:50] place was empty. Nevertheless, Paul Saul
[33:53] spake not anything that day, for he
[33:56] thought something had befallen him. He
[33:58] is not clean. Surely he's not clean.
[33:59] Maybe he's sick. Maybe he didn't bathe,
[34:01] whatever it was. But it came to pass on
[34:03] the tomorrow, which was the second day
[34:05] of the month, that David's place was
[34:07] empty. And Saul said unto Jonathan his
[34:09] son, "Wherefore cometh not," and this is
[34:12] where I had taught this before. Here say
[34:14] David, he said the son of Jesse.
[34:18] You see when people don't want to call
[34:19] you by your name and they try to call
[34:20] you like around your name, it's clacky
[34:23] son is this. They they they're not
[34:26] calling you by you. They're calling you
[34:27] by another identity. You see? So So
[34:33] wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to
[34:36] to meet Why you coming to eat? Neither
[34:39] yesterday nor today.
[34:41] So for one day when somebody have a
[34:43] problem with you, they could keep it
[34:44] under wraps. But brother CL by the
[34:47] second day said to eat them up.
[34:49] [laughter]
[34:51] And Jonathan answered, "Saul, David
[34:54] earnestly asked leave of me." So in
[34:56] other words, he checked me first to go
[34:59] to Bethlehem and he said, "Let me go. I
[35:01] pray thee, for our family had a
[35:02] sacrifice in the city, and my brother,
[35:04] he had commanded me to be there, and now
[35:06] I have found favor in their eyes. Let me
[35:07] get away. I pray thee to see my
[35:09] brethren. Therefore, he cometh not unto
[35:11] the king's table. Verse 30, then Saul's
[35:14] anger was kindled against Jonathan, not
[35:18] against David, in his own house. And he
[35:20] said unto him, thou son of the perverse,
[35:22] rebellious woman. So the pro when people
[35:25] lash out, he lash out at Jonathan. He
[35:29] lashed out at whoever is the perverse
[35:31] rebellious woman because I don't know
[35:33] how she end up in this whole
[35:35] conversation.
[35:36] Do not I know that thou has chosen the
[35:39] son of Jesse again. Nope. Mention of
[35:41] David there. The son of Jesse to thine
[35:43] own confusion. In other words, he's
[35:44] saying Jonathan, you're confused. You
[35:46] have the wrong people in your life to
[35:48] own and unto the confusion of thy
[35:50] mother's nakedness. So you can see he is
[35:53] frustrated. He's he's angry here, right?
[35:56] For as long, listen here, for as long as
[35:59] the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground,
[36:02] thou shalt not be established. Now watch
[36:04] what he's doing here now. He is making
[36:07] it not anymore an issue between him and
[36:09] David. He's trying to turn Jonathan
[36:12] against David to say, listen, once that
[36:15] boy living, you will never be king. Are
[36:18] we together? Now you see how
[36:20] manipulators and how hatred could turn
[36:22] into manipulation. How people could say
[36:24] things and the motive behind what
[36:26] they're saying because he trying to
[36:28] gaslight or gas up or whatever young
[36:30] people say now trying to turn Jonathan
[36:32] against David. Right.
[36:35] For as long as the son of Jesse liveth
[36:37] upon the ground thou shalt not be
[36:39] established nor thy kingdom. Wherefore
[36:42] now send and fetch him unto me for he
[36:45] shall surely die. And Jonathan answered
[36:48] Saul his father and said unto him,
[36:49] wherefore shall he be slain? What had he
[36:51] done? And Saul's response and Saul he
[36:54] just promised and talk about your
[36:56] kingdom and your throne. And Saul cast a
[36:59] javelin at him to smite him. In other
[37:01] words, the same one he want to go on the
[37:02] throne he tried to kill now because he
[37:04] not in alignment with him. Right?
[37:06] Whereby Jonathan knew that it was
[37:09] determined of his father to slay David.
[37:12] So Jonathan arose from the table in
[37:14] fierce anger and did eat no meat the
[37:16] second day of the month for he was
[37:18] grieved for David because his father had
[37:20] done him shame. And it came to pass in
[37:22] the morning that Jonathan went out into
[37:24] the field at the time appointed with
[37:26] David and a little lad with him. And he
[37:28] said unto the lad, "Run, find out now
[37:30] the arrows which I shoot." And as the
[37:32] lad run, he shot an arrow beyond him.
[37:35] And when the lad was come to the place
[37:36] of the arrow with Jonathan and shot,
[37:38] Jonathan cried after lad and said, "Is
[37:40] not the arrow beyond thee, which is the
[37:41] code for David, run for your life." And
[37:44] Jonathan cried after the lad. Make
[37:47] speed. Hey, stay not. He already talking
[37:50] to the boy. He's sending a message to
[37:51] David. David, here what going on? This
[37:53] thing not it looking good. You need to
[37:55] fix your business. Right.
[37:57] And Jonathan's lad gathered up the
[37:59] arrows and came to his master. But the
[38:01] lad knew not anything. Only Jonathan and
[38:04] David knew the matter. And Jonathan gave
[38:06] his artillery unto his lad and said to
[38:08] him, "Go carry them into the city. And
[38:11] as soon as the lad was gone, David arose
[38:13] out of the place towards the south." And
[38:15] fell on his face to the ground. And
[38:17] bowed himself three times. And they
[38:20] kissed one another and wept with one
[38:21] another until David exceeded. And
[38:24] Jonathan said to David, "Go in peace.
[38:26] For as much as we have sworn both of us
[38:29] in the name of the Lord, saying the Lord
[38:32] be between me and thee, and between my
[38:35] seed and thy seed forever. And he arose
[38:37] and departed, and Jonathan went into the
[38:41] city.
[38:43] Are we together?
[38:45] Now, let's move to chapter 31. We still
[38:49] in the foundation,
[38:53] but is a foundation for a quick short
[38:55] message. So the foundation is important.
[38:59] So when we get to what we want to get
[39:01] to, it'll come together.
[39:04] So in 1st Samuel 31, just a few verses
[39:07] there and then we'll switch gears a
[39:08] little bit.
[39:11] 1st Samuel 31. Now the Philistines
[39:14] fought against Israel.
[39:17] So we have now moved forward in the
[39:18] timeline
[39:20] to the war that would kill Saul and
[39:24] would kill Jonathan and will kill Saul's
[39:27] other sons. Are we together? Now the
[39:30] Philistines fought against Israel and
[39:31] the men of Israel fled from before the
[39:33] Philistines and fell down slain in Mount
[39:35] Gilboa. And the Philistines followed
[39:38] hard after Saul and upon his sons. And
[39:40] the Philistines slew Jonathan. So
[39:42] Jonathan is killed here. and Amidadab
[39:46] and Melishua Saul's sons and the battle
[39:49] went sore against Saul and the archers
[39:51] hit him and he was saw wounded of the
[39:54] archers then said Saul unto his armor
[39:56] bearer draw thy sword and thrust me
[39:59] through therewith in other words kill me
[40:00] before they kill me lest these
[40:03] uncircumcised come and thrust me through
[40:05] and abuse me but his armor bearer would
[40:08] not for he was so afraid he didn't want
[40:10] to kill his king therefore Saul took a
[40:12] sword and fell upon it And when his
[40:14] armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he
[40:17] fell likewise upon his sword and died
[40:19] with him. So Saul died and his three
[40:22] sons and his armor bearer and all his
[40:26] men that same day together.
[40:33] We move in the timeline again.
[40:37] Now we're going to jump to 2 Samuel 5.
[40:48] Chapter 1, 2 Samuel 5:1.
[40:53] Saul is already off the scene.
[40:57] David is being crowned king on Mount
[41:00] Hibbron. We had taught on this. This was
[41:02] the mountain Caleb fought for. Give me
[41:04] this mountain. This mountain. This is
[41:06] where Sarah was buried. This is what
[41:07] Abraham fought for. This is the crown in
[41:10] ceremony. Then came all the tribes of
[41:12] Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake,
[41:15] saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy
[41:19] flesh.
[41:20] Also in time passed, when Saul was king
[41:22] over us, thou was he that led us out,
[41:25] and brought us in Israel. And the Lord
[41:27] said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people
[41:29] Israel,
[41:32] and thou shalt be a captain over Israel.
[41:34] So all the elders of Israel came to the
[41:36] king to Hebron. And King David made a
[41:38] league with them in Hebron before the
[41:40] Lord. And they anointed David king over
[41:43] Israel.
[41:44] David was 30 years old when he began to
[41:47] reign. And he reigned 40 years. In
[41:50] Hebron, he reigned over Judah 7 years
[41:53] and 6 months. And in Jerusalem, he
[41:55] reigned 30 and three years over all
[41:58] Israel and Judah.
[42:01] You want to pause. The reason I want to
[42:04] pause is I want to remind the church
[42:07] that we are in 2 Samuel 5, but the Bible
[42:12] when you look at 1st Samuel and 2
[42:14] Samuel, it is not in chronological order
[42:18] in the sense that the Bible is a book of
[42:21] mysteries. So we are in 2 Samuel 5.
[42:25] We just saw King Saul dead in 1 Samuel,
[42:29] but we want to go just one chapter
[42:31] before this to 2 Samuel 4
[42:36] verse 4
[42:41] to pick up
[42:43] someone here. So 2 Samuel 4:4
[42:47] and Jonathan Saul's son
[42:51] who we have been talking about with the
[42:53] covenant with David and Jonathan Saul's
[42:55] son had a son.
[43:00] So we're talking about King Saul's
[43:02] grandson which is Jonathan's son and
[43:05] Jonathan Saul's son had a son that was
[43:07] lame of his feet.
[43:15] He was 5 years old
[43:18] when the tidings came of Saul and
[43:21] Jonathan out of Gizrael,
[43:24] and his nurse took him up and fled.
[43:30] And it came to pass as she made haste to
[43:34] flee that he fell and became lame.
[43:39] and his name was Mphibboet.
[43:43] And we're going to spend the rest of the
[43:45] time talking about Mephoshet.
[43:49] And we're going to start to see how this
[43:51] all connects
[43:54] and is why I chose the title hope for
[43:56] the broken because this young man is
[44:00] actually physically
[44:03] broken. He wasn't born that way. At age
[44:07] one, at age two, maybe by age three, by
[44:09] age four, he learns to walk. He falls
[44:11] down. He gets up. He plays with the
[44:13] other kids. He has no control of his
[44:16] environment. He doesn't understand the
[44:18] family that he's born to. He is
[44:19] privileged because he's the son of
[44:21] royalty.
[44:22] His grandfather is the king, King Saul.
[44:26] His father is the prince, Prince
[44:27] Jonathan.
[44:31] He is in the care of someone, his nurse.
[44:34] And out of panic, we just read
[44:38] the nurse in an attempt to protect, in
[44:41] an attempt to save, in an attempt to
[44:43] guide, in an attempt to do whatever was
[44:45] seen right, she made a mistake
[44:50] and she dropped him. And what was once
[44:53] whole
[44:55] was now broken.
[44:58] The young boy who could once walk was
[45:01] now lame.
[45:02] He was now crippled, lame at defeat.
[45:09] At an age when he was too young to
[45:10] defend himself,
[45:13] he was even more vulnerable.
[45:18] Psychologists today speak of childhood
[45:20] trauma,
[45:23] situations that take place many times
[45:27] when people are young
[45:29] before they are even able to defend
[45:31] themselves, protect themselves, speak
[45:33] for themselves, articulate issues,
[45:36] resolve conflict, have a voice.
[45:41] This young boy mphet
[45:47] is a type of many today
[45:51] who are broken by no fault of their own.
[45:55] There was nothing this young boy did to
[45:57] cause this. Are we together? It was not
[46:00] that he was born with this, but the
[46:02] situations of life that were beyond his
[46:04] control had left him broken.
[46:10] The people who were responsible for
[46:12] caring for him whether directly or
[46:15] indirectly were a part of what led him
[46:18] broken.
[46:21] Being broken his genealogy
[46:24] mattered and at the same time didn't
[46:26] matter
[46:27] because his reality was he was broken.
[46:32] crippled at 5 years old in a day in a
[46:36] time when medicine, science, technology,
[46:39] therapy options that we might have today
[46:43] did not exist then. So being crippled at
[46:46] age five was a lifetime of
[46:50] misery, hardship, being forsaken, being
[46:53] left back, being abandoned simply
[46:56] because you were broken.
[47:00] easily forgotten because you couldn't
[47:02] get where [clears throat] you wanted to
[47:03] go being broken. You needed people to
[47:05] help you. You needed people to advocate
[47:08] for you. You needed people to speak for
[47:09] you.
[47:11] Anybody with me? We're talking about
[47:13] hope for the broken.
[47:19] Let's now move our story forward to 2
[47:21] Samuel
[47:23] 9.
[47:26] Verse
[47:31] one.
[47:32] And David said, "Is there yet any that
[47:35] is left of the house of Saul,
[47:41] that I may show him kindness for
[47:44] Jonathan's sake?"
[47:46] What was once a covenant by words before
[47:50] God was now enforcable by a throne. Are
[47:53] we together?
[47:55] When David made the covenant with
[47:57] Jonathan, these were two friends having
[47:59] a conversation before God saying, "Don't
[48:01] worry, I have your back and I promise
[48:03] even your family, I will look after
[48:04] them." You remember that
[48:07] the layering of the covenant that
[48:09] Jonathan made David pledge even after I
[48:12] am gone
[48:14] because Jonathan in his heart knew that
[48:16] one day David would be king
[48:20] and David a type of the king because we
[48:24] know Christ is son of David.
[48:26] There is a point in time similar to the
[48:29] story of Esther when the king asks,
[48:30] "What did we ever do for the man who
[48:34] warned me?" In other words, there's this
[48:36] principle that exists and God remembered
[48:39] the promise. Anybody with me? Here is a
[48:41] type of David. We don't know if he was
[48:44] in the morning, if he was in the
[48:45] evening. Just something comes upon David
[48:48] and he asks the question, is there
[48:50] anybody left of the house of Saul that I
[48:54] might show kindness for Jonathan's sake?
[48:57] This to me is so encouraging because it
[49:00] speaks to the fact that God don't ever
[49:02] forget a promise.
[49:06] something in David,
[49:08] wake up. And the covenant that was
[49:11] bigger than him, that was before God was
[49:12] activated.
[49:16] And there was of the house of Saul a
[49:18] servant, verse two, whose name was Zeba.
[49:24] So this was a how do I describe this? He
[49:29] used to work for King Saul.
[49:33] David is in the kingdom in the palace.
[49:35] But he fire everybody.
[49:38] So the Bible said here of the house of
[49:41] Saul a servant. So he used to work for
[49:43] King Saul when Saul was king. He's still
[49:45] around.
[49:47] So David says send for one of the old
[49:49] guards so to speak.
[49:54] A servant whose name was Zeba. And when
[49:55] they had called him to David, the king
[49:57] said unto him, "Art thou Zeba?" In other
[50:00] words, "Are you the one they're talking
[50:01] about?" And he said, "Thy servant is
[50:03] he."
[50:05] And the king said, "Is there not yet any
[50:08] of the house of Saul that I might show
[50:10] the kindness of God unto him?" You hear
[50:13] how we speaking? Now, this is a paradox
[50:16] in and of itself because I want to
[50:18] remind us that David for a significant
[50:21] point of his highest stress was on the
[50:23] run from Saul. His encounter with
[50:25] Abigail was running from Saul. His
[50:27] hiding plain madman was hiding from
[50:30] Saul. And here it is. You seeing a type
[50:33] of Christ where he has no ought, no
[50:36] grudges. He not seeking retribution. He
[50:39] say, "I want to wipe out every last
[50:40] incendant of Saul for distress he
[50:42] created." He is looking to do kindness
[50:44] because of the covenant he made with
[50:46] Jonathan. Are we together? That I may
[50:48] show the kindness of God unto him. And
[50:50] Zeas said unto the king, Jonathan had
[50:52] yet a son
[50:54] which is lame on his feet. Now, now this
[50:58] here excites me because again here we
[51:02] have the servant. He hasn't even called
[51:04] the son by name. I have a real challenge
[51:07] where people characterize you by your
[51:09] weakness, by your failure, by your
[51:11] disability, by your challenge. He
[51:13] doesn't say he doesn't say Jonathan has
[51:15] a son named me. He said he has a son
[51:19] which is lame on his feet. In other
[51:20] words, that is all that he saw him as.
[51:22] Are we together?
[51:24] It is something because God don't
[51:26] identify us by our scars, by our pains,
[51:28] by our missing, by our failures. The
[51:31] Bible say he knows your name. Oh, come
[51:32] on now. Somebody help me tonight. He
[51:35] knows us by name. IT IS NOT YOUR SCARS
[51:38] IS WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF LIFE. IT'S NOT
[51:39] YOUR YOUR your your crippleness and your
[51:42] brokenness. God describing you by your
[51:43] brokenness. The mystery of who you are
[51:46] is your name. That's your identity. Are
[51:49] we together? He calls you by name.
[51:52] So this servant says he has a son which
[51:55] is lame on his feet. This is just
[51:57] mindboggling to me. How people want to
[52:00] label you by your issue, by your
[52:03] situation, by your condition, by what
[52:05] they see, not even looking at who you
[52:07] really are. Right?
[52:10] And the king said unto him, where is he?
[52:13] In other words, he even respond to the
[52:15] description. Where is he? And Zea said
[52:18] unto the king, "Behold, he is in the
[52:20] house of Machiru, the son of Amile in
[52:22] Loa." Now that word Loa means no
[52:27] pasture, no word, no communication.
[52:30] [laughter]
[52:31] He, in other words, he's in a place with
[52:33] no word, with no posture, with no
[52:35] communication, no encouragement
[52:39] because his identity has been wrapped up
[52:41] in the fact that he's lame. His identity
[52:44] has been wrapped up with look the
[52:46] reach, who carrying the
[52:48] out, who taking who go and buy stuff for
[52:50] the because the cannot
[52:52] go to the grocery. The can't go
[52:54] there. So his identity is no pasture, no
[52:57] word, no communication. Because unless
[53:00] you go to him, nobody talks to him. He
[53:01] can't go to nobody. In them days, you
[53:03] had no phone. You had no WhatsApp. If
[53:04] nobody come to you, you're by yourself.
[53:06] You're you're cut off. You're in
[53:07] solitude.
[53:09] Anybody with me?
[53:15] I want us to remember now, no matter
[53:17] what you want to say about Saul, and
[53:18] people always mix it up. We did a Bible
[53:20] study in this, the people never chose
[53:22] Saul. Saul disobeyed God, but God chose
[53:25] Saul. No matter how you look at it, this
[53:28] is still
[53:30] a son or grandson or a lineage. He is
[53:33] still royalty. I want you to catch me on
[53:36] this one.
[53:39] God found a better king, but God honors
[53:41] his word.
[53:43] And here it is, David as king still is
[53:47] giving honor and respect to touch not
[53:49] God anointed. Because when David's own
[53:51] general had told him to king Saul, David
[53:53] still had revelation to understood this
[53:55] was God's anointed. And if it's God's
[53:57] anointed, his son is anointed. His
[53:59] grandson is anointed. The lineage is
[54:01] anointed. Anybody with me?
[54:06] Behold, he's in the house of Machiru,
[54:08] the son of Amile in Loa. Then King David
[54:13] sent, I love this, and fetched him here.
[54:16] Tell him, "Come." David went and said,
[54:18] "Bring, bring him, fetch this man for
[54:20] me, out of the house of Mater, the son
[54:23] of Am from Loa." Hallelujah. Now when
[54:27] Mephoset, the son of Jonathan, the son
[54:30] of Saul, you see, I love when scripture
[54:32] gives you context. Now when Mphibbeeth,
[54:34] the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul,
[54:37] was come unto David, he fell on his face
[54:40] and did reverence.
[54:45] And David said,
[54:48] here call him Here call him
[54:50] lame. Here call him grandson of my
[54:53] enemy. He call him my name. And David
[54:56] said, Mbashet.
[54:58] And he answered, Behold thy servant. And
[55:01] David said unto him, "Fear not,
[55:04] for I will surely show thee kindness
[55:08] for Jonathan thy father's sake." Now,
[55:11] this here is is mindboggling because
[55:14] many of us have never looked at this.
[55:18] And will restore thee all a ll all do
[55:22] mean part all do mean 99 all the land of
[55:25] Saul thy father. So this crippled man, I
[55:28] want you to picture this man sitting in
[55:31] Libar, no word, no communication for his
[55:33] whole life. Nobody coming and talk to
[55:35] him. Nobody remember him. Maybe when he
[55:37] was three years old, he had songs that
[55:39] he would hear when the king's palace he
[55:41] would get the opportunity to walk the
[55:43] palace. Everything he could have
[55:44] envisioned as a 5-year-old in a royal
[55:46] family was snatched from him. Not by his
[55:49] mistake, not by his issue, but because
[55:52] the nurse who was charged with
[55:53] protecting him dropped him and from
[55:55] there his life was changed. He could
[55:56] have never see his way after that and
[55:58] for his whole life growing up for years
[56:01] he's there in solitude in isolation
[56:05] never thinking he could ever do anything
[56:07] never could work because cripples
[56:08] couldn't work and here it is you find
[56:10] yourself in front of the king and he
[56:12] bows in reverence not wondering I wonder
[56:14] if this king won't kill me and the king
[56:16] says to you all that was your
[56:18] grandfather's property your
[56:20] grandfather's wealth which was this is
[56:23] kingly wealth we're talking about this
[56:24] is not a farmer wealth this is Not a
[56:26] mechanic word. This is the wealth of a
[56:28] king.
[56:31] Restore thee all the land of Saul thy
[56:33] father.
[56:35] And listen, and thou shalt eat bread at
[56:37] my table continually. Talk about moving
[56:40] from a to a king's table
[56:42] overnight. And this is why they said his
[56:44] hope for the broken because he is a
[56:46] broken man who can do nothing for
[56:48] himself. I want you to catch that one
[56:49] tonight. He could he didn't promote
[56:52] himself. He couldn't change his
[56:53] situation. He had nothing to do with it.
[56:56] I want to He had nothing to do with it.
[57:00] The reason he was in that position was
[57:02] because of a covenant
[57:04] that was made between his father and
[57:07] David before David was even king.
[57:11] And I want to remind us tonight that
[57:12] there's a covenant about you. Because
[57:15] the covenant that would have been made
[57:17] between David and Jonathan was before
[57:18] this boy was even born. Or you don't
[57:20] hear me tonight.
[57:22] Before this boy was even born, there was
[57:25] a covenant about him. He is actually
[57:27] living proof that the covenant was
[57:29] bigger than him. The covenant was before
[57:31] him. He was a beneficiary of the
[57:32] covenant. And being broken had nothing
[57:35] to do with the power of the covenant to
[57:37] restore to him what belonged to him.
[57:41] If that doesn't excite you about your
[57:43] life being changed overnight, that have
[57:46] nothing to do with your ability to do
[57:48] it. But just because there's a covenant,
[57:51] a word about what's supposed to happen
[57:54] to you, that should give you such faith
[57:56] to realize that your healing is not
[57:58] about you. Your blessing is not about
[58:00] you. Your deliverance is not about you.
[58:02] Your transformation is not about you. It
[58:04] has all to do with the covenant, the
[58:06] unconditional covenant, the promise of
[58:08] God that existed before you even met
[58:10] your problem. Because before that boy
[58:12] fell, the covenant was theirs.
[58:16] BEFORE THE NURSE DROPPED HIM, THE
[58:18] COVENANT was older than the nurse
[58:20] dropping him. Anybody with me?
[58:24] Thou shalt eat bread
[58:26] at my table continually.
[58:29] Listen to verse eight to show you the
[58:32] challenge we have to overcome. And he
[58:35] bowed himself and said, "What is thy
[58:39] servant that thou should look upon such
[58:42] a dead dog as I am?"
[58:44] In other words, for so long, he lived in
[58:47] this crippled, broken condition that he
[58:50] saw himself as a dead dog.
[58:53] He didn't see value in himself. He
[58:56] couldn't understand the reality and the
[58:59] magnitude of what was happening to him,
[59:02] around him, about him. He said, "What is
[59:04] it you seeing? You're not seeing my
[59:06] condition." In other words, at that
[59:09] point in time, there was a conflict in
[59:11] his mind between how he saw himself and
[59:14] what was happening to him. God help us
[59:16] to see ourselves the way God sees us.
[59:19] Because David was not seeing a
[59:21] David was not seeing a broken man. David
[59:23] was seeing the recipient of a covenant.
[59:28] Listen how this thing builds. A man who
[59:30] couldn't help himself. Brother Clarence,
[59:32] a man who couldn't help himself. A man
[59:34] who couldn't work. A man who couldn't
[59:36] walk. Suddenly he said, "You're eating
[59:39] continually at the king's table." You
[59:40] know how much people wish they could sit
[59:42] at the king's table?
[59:43] Don't you have a fight? They say, "How
[59:45] he get there, boy? What he do to get
[59:47] there?" Nothing. He had do nothing to
[59:48] get there. He didn't deserve it. But
[59:50] when the king promote you, help me
[59:51] tonight. When the king promotes you and
[59:53] you had nothing to do with it, this is
[59:56] not you work and impress somebody and
[59:58] you show yourself and you earn it and
[1:00:00] you achieve it. This is covenant
[1:00:02] speaking for you better than you could
[1:00:03] do anything for yourself.
[1:00:05] When God is ready to promote you, it has
[1:00:08] nothing to do with your merit, with your
[1:00:09] work, with your contribution. It has all
[1:00:11] to do with him enforcing his word, which
[1:00:14] is his covenant.
[1:00:17] And God's word, which is his covenant,
[1:00:19] is him swore by himself. He don't need
[1:00:21] permission. He don't need another party.
[1:00:24] Oh, help us tonight.
[1:00:32] I want to read verse eight again to help
[1:00:34] somebody here. And he bowed himself and
[1:00:36] said, "What is thy servant that thou
[1:00:39] shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I
[1:00:42] am?"
[1:00:45] David didn't even respond to that
[1:00:47] statement. David continues in the vein
[1:00:49] of the covenant.
[1:00:51] Then the king called to Zeba, Saul's
[1:00:54] servant, and said unto him, I have given
[1:00:56] unto thy master son all that pertain to
[1:00:59] Saul and to all his house. In other
[1:01:02] words, David speaking, this is already
[1:01:04] done. In other words, I want you to look
[1:01:06] at this crippled man who you calling
[1:01:07] crippled because you disrespected him
[1:01:09] earlier by not even acknowledging his
[1:01:11] name. You just heard what I said, right?
[1:01:13] [laughter]
[1:01:15] David honored him by his name and to the
[1:01:17] servant who addressed him by his
[1:01:19] condition. He says to him, "I have given
[1:01:22] unto thy master son all that pertain to
[1:01:25] Saul and to his house." Now therefore,
[1:01:28] thou therefore, in other words, you
[1:01:30] zebra and thy sons and thy servants
[1:01:35] shall till the land for him.
[1:01:38] So here is a man who had no work, no
[1:01:41] workers, no throne, nothing. He was
[1:01:44] characterized as as crippled five
[1:01:47] minutes before. I want you to understand
[1:01:48] the power of transformation. When the
[1:01:49] prophet say if we get into one mind and
[1:01:51] one accord in five minutes there'll be
[1:01:52] not one sick person in the room. Five
[1:01:54] minutes before he walked in as a
[1:01:56] Five minutes later, not only
[1:01:58] has he been told he would sit at the
[1:02:00] king's table. Not only was he just given
[1:02:02] land and title, but he's now told this
[1:02:05] servant here, [laughter]
[1:02:08] hallelujah,
[1:02:09] thou therefore and thy sons and shall
[1:02:12] tell the land for him, and thou shalt
[1:02:13] bring in the fruits, [laughter]
[1:02:16] that thy master's son may have food to
[1:02:18] eat, but Mephabet thy master's son, even
[1:02:22] though he will have food to eat, listen
[1:02:24] to this, shall eat bread always at my
[1:02:26] table.
[1:02:29] So the food you're getting for him is
[1:02:30] extra.
[1:02:32] That's for when he finish eat at my
[1:02:34] table, he have fruit to go home with.
[1:02:35] Oh, you don't hear me tonight. In other
[1:02:37] words, he eats at the king table and
[1:02:39] there's fruit. There's dessert waiting
[1:02:40] for him which you and your house and
[1:02:42] your family will till the soil and
[1:02:44] gather the fruit because listen, the
[1:02:47] blessing is so good. He don't need to
[1:02:48] pick the fruit. You don't hear me
[1:02:50] tonight. You know the Bible say you will
[1:02:51] reap what you didn't even sow. In other
[1:02:53] words, the blessing of God will come to
[1:02:55] you that you didn't even work for and
[1:02:56] the blessing just roll up to your door.
[1:02:58] If there ever is a case study in
[1:03:00] scripture about this happening because
[1:03:02] God is showing the sovereignty of God,
[1:03:05] the provision of God to those who can't
[1:03:07] even help themselves. I want that to
[1:03:09] stick tonight.
[1:03:11] When you cannot help yourself, God is
[1:03:13] giving us something to encourage and
[1:03:15] show. All right, you're saying you can't
[1:03:16] help yourself. You're saying you can't
[1:03:17] do this. You can't do this. Look at an
[1:03:18] example of somebody who cannot do,
[1:03:21] couldn't do, no fault of their own, and
[1:03:23] I could still bless them because they
[1:03:24] found themselves under the covenant.
[1:03:27] The important lesson because when Jesus
[1:03:30] gave his disciples power, he said,
[1:03:32] "Don't rejoice because they have power.
[1:03:33] No, rejoice because your names have been
[1:03:34] written." The most important lesson
[1:03:36] tonight is to be under the covenant.
[1:03:39] Because if you are under the covenant,
[1:03:41] the covenant will cover you. The
[1:03:42] covenant will provide for you. The
[1:03:44] covenant will keep you. The covenant
[1:03:45] will defend you. When you can't help
[1:03:47] yourself, the covenant is bigger than
[1:03:48] what you cannot do. Anybody with me
[1:03:50] tonight?
[1:03:52] But MBeth, thy master son shall eat
[1:03:54] bread always at my table. Now Zeba had
[1:03:58] 15 sons and 20 servants. So in other
[1:04:01] words, God is telling here, this man
[1:04:03] came in with no staff. And by the time
[1:04:06] David done talking, he had 35 staff
[1:04:08] members. [laughter]
[1:04:10] Lord help us tonight.
[1:04:12] When you say you have no help, God give
[1:04:14] him one helper. He gave him 35 help.
[1:04:17] [laughter]
[1:04:18] I don't know if this is as as exciting
[1:04:20] to you as it is to me to see when God
[1:04:23] ready to bless you. He has blessed you
[1:04:25] in a way that you can't argue with it.
[1:04:27] You can't debate it. You went from being
[1:04:29] fetched to now you have 35 people need
[1:04:32] to take care of you, work for you by the
[1:04:34] king's order. This is not this is not
[1:04:36] working for you. This is the king's
[1:04:38] instructions by the king's command
[1:04:40] saying, "Listen, this is your
[1:04:41] responsibility to make sure he have
[1:04:42] food. Till the soil, reap the thing."
[1:04:44] After he eat at my king's table, make
[1:04:46] sure it have fruit waiting for him. Are
[1:04:48] we together?
[1:04:51] Then said Zeba unto the king, according
[1:04:53] to all that my lord, the king had
[1:04:55] commanded his servant, so shall thy
[1:04:57] servant do.
[1:04:59] As for Mphibicheth, said the king, he
[1:05:02] will eat, listen to this, at my table.
[1:05:05] He added now as one of the king's sons.
[1:05:09] Now I want
[1:05:11] I'm about to close short. I tell you
[1:05:12] when we get to the meat of it, it'll be
[1:05:14] a short quick message because the
[1:05:15] foundation was important here, right? I
[1:05:18] want you to picture this. And
[1:05:19] Mphibicheth had a young son whose name
[1:05:21] was Ma. And all that dwelt in the house
[1:05:24] of Zeba were servants unto Mphibicheth.
[1:05:27] So Mphibicheth dwelt in Jerusalem, for
[1:05:30] he did eat continually at the king's
[1:05:32] table, and was lame on both his feet.
[1:05:35] Now, why would the Bible repeat this
[1:05:37] line? Because it has been said before. I
[1:05:40] want you to picture what God is trying
[1:05:42] to say here in this last verse here. For
[1:05:46] he did eat continually at the king's
[1:05:48] table and was lame on both feet. We
[1:05:50] already know it. Why the repetition
[1:05:52] here?
[1:05:55] You see when you sit down on a table,
[1:05:59] when anybody sit down at a nice table,
[1:06:01] brother Clarence,
[1:06:03] a beautiful banquet, a king's table,
[1:06:06] would I see your feet?
[1:06:09] I would not see your feet. So God is
[1:06:11] saying here, when you're brought to the
[1:06:13] king's table, the fact that you are lame
[1:06:15] is not even the issue because God is
[1:06:18] covering, hiding, removing from the
[1:06:20] public view. The issue that you come in
[1:06:23] with is not even relevant anymore
[1:06:26] because on the king's table you can't
[1:06:27] see the issue. So this lame man if you
[1:06:30] walked into the room you wouldn't even
[1:06:31] know he live. Oh God help me tonight.
[1:06:35] I need to kind of wrap up here. God is
[1:06:38] saying when you sit at the king's table
[1:06:41] your lame condition is no longer
[1:06:43] visible.
[1:06:47] You might still remember your past, you
[1:06:49] know, but it's under the blood. Or you
[1:06:51] don't hear me tonight.
[1:06:53] You might have a broken situation, you
[1:06:55] know, but nobody could talk about it
[1:06:57] because they can't even see it or you
[1:06:59] don't hear me tonight. I'm about to
[1:07:00] close. This is a short teaching tonight,
[1:07:02] but I want to encourage you tonight.
[1:07:05] There's hope for the broken. That's the
[1:07:07] lesson tonight. There's hope for the
[1:07:09] broken. There's hope for what might seem
[1:07:12] hopeless. There's hope for the helpless.
[1:07:15] There is a comfort in the covenant that
[1:07:19] God is interested in every shape, form,
[1:07:23] fashion of anything that is wrapped up
[1:07:25] in the covenant. So, short quick message
[1:07:27] tonight. I trust that it is a blessing
[1:07:30] to you. There's more that we could touch
[1:07:32] on at another point in time, but I
[1:07:34] believe this is what the Lord put on my
[1:07:35] heart to encourage you on this Friday
[1:07:37] evening that no matter what situation
[1:07:39] you have gone through that you want to
[1:07:41] mask, you want to hide. God shows us
[1:07:44] clearly here through this teaching, man
[1:07:47] in hiding, away from the world, but a
[1:07:50] covenant brought him forward. Give him
[1:07:52] land. Give him title. Give him staff.
[1:07:55] Staff you don't even need. Give him food
[1:07:57] on the king's table. And on the king's
[1:07:59] table, you can't even see his feet. So
[1:08:01] if you come to talk to the king, he just
[1:08:03] is like one of the king's son.
[1:08:05] Anybody with me tonight?
[1:08:08] May the Lord richly bless you. May he
[1:08:10] encourage you. May this have your faith
[1:08:11] to rise to a new level. And if you can
[1:08:14] take anything from this, there is a
[1:08:16] promotion that could come from God that
[1:08:19] you have nothing to do with.
[1:08:23] This doesn't negate the principle of
[1:08:25] working and by your sweat your brow.
[1:08:28] That's a principle of God. But I want
[1:08:30] you to also trust God to do big things
[1:08:33] that are so big that you would be
[1:08:35] asking, "But this dog, [laughter]
[1:08:38] this broken man, this broken story, this
[1:08:41] situation that looked impossible that I
[1:08:44] can't even help myself, but look, look
[1:08:46] at the kind of help that God could
[1:08:48] send." Shall we pray?
[1:08:52] Heavenly Father, we thank you tonight
[1:08:54] that there's hope for the broken.
[1:08:56] There's hope for the weary. There's
[1:08:58] encouragement for the troubled, Lord.
[1:09:01] And sometimes when we least expect this
[1:09:04] man, Mphibashed wasn't even looking for
[1:09:06] help. He had reached a point he didn't
[1:09:09] even have hope. It was not like he was
[1:09:11] there waiting for transformation. He was
[1:09:13] in a place called Lord Debbah, which
[1:09:16] meant there was nothing nothing going
[1:09:18] on. But we thank God that David
[1:09:21] remembered the same way God remembered.
[1:09:24] The same way the king remembered Mori.
[1:09:28] We thank you Lord that you remembered
[1:09:30] us. And at the right time, the right
[1:09:32] season, the right moment, you remember
[1:09:34] the covenant, the promise that was made.
[1:09:37] Lord, may your faith, may the faith of
[1:09:38] your people tonight rise and be
[1:09:40] encouraged, Lord, that help could come
[1:09:42] from an unknown place. Lord, when Esther
[1:09:46] when when Mordei was speaking to Esther,
[1:09:48] he said if you don't act, help will come
[1:09:52] from another place. But rest assured,
[1:09:54] help is coming. So you either act or
[1:09:57] help will come. No matter what, God will
[1:09:59] never leave his people without help. And
[1:10:02] Lord, you are present help in time of
[1:10:04] trouble. Lord, we have situations among
[1:10:06] us of people who need healing. They need
[1:10:08] a word. They need an encouragement. They
[1:10:09] need a touch. They need the help of
[1:10:11] Jehovah Gyra. They need to know Jehovah
[1:10:13] Rafa. Jehovah ni Jehovah situ they need
[1:10:16] to encounter the rose of Sharon the lily
[1:10:18] of the valley El Shadai in their
[1:10:20] situation in their homes in their
[1:10:22] finances in their in their health in
[1:10:24] their marriages in their families in
[1:10:25] their walk with God tonight
[1:10:28] Lord we are here tonight to feast on
[1:10:31] this word this this this almost
[1:10:33] seemingly insignificant character as it
[1:10:36] were by virtue of what he was a
[1:10:40] at age five and here it was you could
[1:10:42] pick him from up obscurity as it was.
[1:10:45] Pick him up from hiding. Pick him up
[1:10:46] from being able to help himself to raise
[1:10:48] him to the four as it were. And to put
[1:10:50] him in a position, Lord, that you could
[1:10:53] honor your own word and anointing you
[1:10:55] placed upon Saul. He was reflecting the
[1:10:57] Saul lineage because you are a god of
[1:10:59] your word and your promises. Lord, we
[1:11:01] thank you that you don't forget anyone.
[1:11:03] We thank you that you forneew us and
[1:11:06] true fornowledge you could predestinate
[1:11:08] us. Lord, it's all past tense or who you
[1:11:10] forneew. You're called called justified.
[1:11:12] justified, already glorified. So,
[1:11:14] Father, may you strengthen your people,
[1:11:16] strengthen your church, encourage your
[1:11:17] people tonight. Lift up your people
[1:11:19] tonight. Father, may you bless your
[1:11:21] people. One more time. May you bless the
[1:11:23] services coming Sunday at 10:00 a.m. May
[1:11:25] we come charged on fire under great
[1:11:28] expectation for what you will do. We
[1:11:30] commit your people into your hands. We
[1:11:31] commit all the situations, the families
[1:11:33] into your hands in the precious,
[1:11:35] wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:11:37] Amen. And amen. May the Lord graciously
[1:11:39] bless you tonight. Looking forward by
[1:11:41] the grace of God to seeing you on church
[1:11:43] on Sunday, Lord willing, bright and
[1:11:45] early. Come prayed up. We're looking for
[1:11:47] God to do something tremendous for us.
[1:11:49] Come under expectation for God to
[1:11:51] transform, for God to change. And may
[1:11:54] the Lord be with you. Have a blessed
[1:11:56] weekend, a wonderful evening. Thank you
[1:11:58] so much for coming. God bless you. Good
[1:12:00] night.
