your word to give a non-glory and get online glory in Jesus let me ask it email me God bless you and welcome tonight and uh I finally a great privilege to be here they want to go to treatment of what we're going to share tonight no well the Brian said this in the token and Justin field every spiritual happening is a sign from God be careful notice that see what every spiritual happening everything that happens is a sign I don't know how much you have heard about this revival or spiritual weakness in this place called Ashbury in America where things February 8th University students had a service and afterwards it just didn't stop after 11 o'clock one of the guys ran out to one of the administrators at least something is happening uh apparently there was a move of the spirit of God that influenced the students to go to the altar and repent it started with some kind of conviction and repentance and that the prisoners of God move in and they they they are there up to now and um night after night is about two weeks since this so-called Revival has been going on and the city I understand is sociology as a place of about 6 000 people but they had over 50 000 and by now maybe I don't know what it is now but the time that I heard the data on it it will order over 50 000 people came in to that place to this great revive as well there was a great stream because another customer so many people but people come in the sea to watch the participate and so on like that so it's very interesting and I don't want you to be dismissal or something like this and says you know it's not of the Lord or what's that that's why I read that what I read just now there that every spiritual thing is the same it's a sign because it's a sign of what is to come they're going to work for the Bride of Jesus Christ that's what I believe and I will share with you of course if I'm all kind of cook some cranks and it will always have that around but that doesn't change the fact that there is something happening among these University students now one thing adults could play games and you know act on different endings but when it comes to like students and and young people and so on they tend to touch I've not touch base with reality they want a reality they don't want to foolishness they want something that is tangible to them this is supposed to be a Christian College uh uh and so on like that Asbury but it was brought to my attention something that balabana prayed in a message called scissors to Jesus he was saying Lord we pray it will start right here in Bloomington it's a Revival to see your great Supreme Revival he said Lord we pray it will start right in Bloomington we'll go Statewide and Nationwide Grant here in among these people that has assembled tonight in all these corporate and treaties that the power of God will be also manifested in their midst until they see and take new heart again Grant this college Lord so apparently this was in a college this is uh since we received Jesus Bloomington this is the ninth of uh April 1961 like every 1961. and he says um he said Grant this college Lord that has let us have this Auditorium that there will be a Revival breakout here like at Wheaton and Dong at Asbury and many of the other places it will be day and night prayer meeting Lord that people will come from the East to the West God give them an old-fashioned John Wesley Revival a burning Zeal of these young men's hearts that would leave the college here that they might go forth like another Asbury the granted father give us that Grace we dedicate Our Lives to thee and the services to thee and all that we have both mentally and physically speak to us father we pray in Jesus name now right now I know it's still live you know you have it on YouTube uh people have cameras there and still live people still go in they're still singing It's like a it's like a 24 hours inspiration on the singing reading scriptures and different things but this is what I want to get through I want to point out 10 things this started suddenly two it went viral overnight three people came from everywhere for all testify about the atmosphere like but this year we need Revival now and I understand it is six it is spread into other universities seven we know Revival is possible eight we know Revival is promised nine we know revivals go out and ten I have that's what Paula Brown says when the power of this church Rises so friends it's very interesting what is happening now in the world today and anytime there's a spiritual awakening it means something is about to break okay so we want to just go in scriptures this tonight I will just background that I will go forward into the woods so tonight I want to read from Revelation chapter 3 14 to 20 Revelation 2 1 to 6 and Matthew 24 11 to 14 uh we're gonna read the scriptures tonight Revelation 3 we want to create from verse 14 to 20. and thank you so much for being here tonight we certainly appreciate all of you making this effort to be here a minute praise the Lord So reading from version 3 14 under the angel of the Church of laodicea write these things here the amen the faithful true witness the beginning of the creation of God I know that works that I need a corner hot I would or that I would call the heart so then because the word lukewarm and things are cold or hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou says I'm rich increase with goods and have need of nothing I know it's not the Thou Art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I constantly divide and go try and find the doll must be rich and white women your Dome is be closed under the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anointing eyes with ice cells that down may see as many as I love I rebuke and treason desires therefore repent the whole experimental don't knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will support him and he will be version 2 1-6 want to read our version two beautiful under the angel if you find it unto the angel of the truth of Ephesus right these things that he that hold his established in his right hand walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks I Know Thy Works in that labor and thy patients and how though can't not bear them which are evil and that was tried and would see the apostles and are not and has found them Alliance and I was born and has patience and for my name asleep but has not fainted nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because I was lost by serious love remember therefore from when Star was formed and repent and do the first books or else I will come unto thee quickly and will remove their candlesticks open this priests except the return but this stuff has the door he tests the days of the nicolitans which I also heal final scripture from Matthew chapter 24 I read from 11 to 14 verse 11 reads Matthew 24. and many false prophets shall rise and deceive many and because the iniquity shall abound the love of many shall back school he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be seated and this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for witness unto all nations and then the end shall come let's pray again father we thank you for the scriptures I pray that you Enlighten us tonight by Your Word by your spirit and she said we ask it amen and amen just remind you that February 8 when they see the Revival broke out there in Ashbury spirit week and whatever they want to call it that is the same night but when the night that this message was preached verse 14 this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached praise God I was that message at that time so I want to thank God for Wednesday night very Gideon he was a real blessed and refreshing and inspiring and I really appreciate amen it was like a living testimony that he gives praise the Lord like a living testimony you know it wasn't just like you know it was like a living testimony of his experience of having this headache and he shake it off and he presses weed and he plays music exhort the word of God and came out and play and all went well and I was blessed and I trust that you were blessed and you were inspired I like to see young men that have a passion for God and love God and want to do something for God and I certainly appreciate him God bless you but again praise the Lord amen okay so tonight I want to just export you for a few moments an Advertiser the complaint of God and it's a push to return to a full slow you're gonna listen to some testimonies from the people who went to this Asbury and one of the guys was really it was a blessing to hear it see this young man outside on like lawn Graf exhorting people about have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe and this is a promise and you have to get the Holy Ghost I said let's pray and he's praying for another category because that was so that was so thrilling to see that and to hear that because you know people don't talk much about getting this Holy Ghost and they hear a young guy on the University grounds talking about have you received on people's time of day old ones people come in visiting hearing him preaching in the corner that was just exciting for me so that was always good so this year about returning to who's love brother Brahman says you lost your full smile he says you can't get him to clap the hands I'm going to tambourine or Corner they just have to act like the world they have to dress like the world look like the world and the female television star they will stay home from Prime meeting and everything else to see it now if God had that against this church he's got it against that one too because you lost your first love I've got it against you this is a complete order you know we have complaints we have complained about family friends husband white girl this company Court of complaints and God of a complaint they say I have something against you you have lost your first love I have something against you that's my complaint you once had a great time but you let the world begin to creep in and you got to act in a little former so God is not for this formality thing he's not for this cold look on Delhi kind of thing you know you're stable in my name you're still doing the things that is right you got a lot of patience you'll label like a mule you live and work he said my you love Grace and Faith and Power to swap it for labor and works well I tell you brother Branham I help everybody can well that's a good thing I commend you for that but where's the love you once had it was the joy he used to have David said unto me oh Lord reported me the joy of my salvation where is them all night primitive tears on their cheeks my goodness the Bible even Dusty God cobits on it you read love stories and news and things and things that open to be allowed to be published to put out in the trash can with Pentecostal pick them up listen to this he said to understand this you must realize that the spirit is not speaking to the original sins of Ephesus alone this message is to the entire age which lasted about 120 years its message them is to all the generations in that path Now history keeps repeating itself in the generation of Israel we see Revival in one generation only to see the fires facing the next is the third generation Embers may be blowing slightly but in the fourth generation there will be no Vestige whatsoever of the original Flame then God likes the fire again and the same process is repeated it is simply the manifestation of the truth that God has no grandchildren salvation is not passed on by natural birth any more than there is any truth to Apostolic succession it isn't in the word you start out with truly born-again Believers and when the next Generation comes along they are no longer just playing Christians but they have taken the non-national needs and are now Baptist Methodist that is exactly what they do too they are not Christians you have to be born of the will of God not the will of man to be saved but these folks are all coming together by the will of man now I don't say that some of them aren't right with God The Proven desire to please God watch these words now the fruitful desire to peace going the passion to know his word the cry for reaching out in the spirit all begins to feed and instead of that the church been on fire with the fire of God in it that's cooled off and become a bit former now the reason that we could share these things is because that God promised a reviver and let me just read this here but I'm talking about the age that started at the 20th 20th century as it was to be the age in which the true church would return to being the bride she was of Pentecost We Know listen we know that there must of necessity be a return of dynamic power now you know what's shocking with me is how fast this thing spread how fast it hit the news how fast it was being talked on the internet and on social media and stuff we speed at which this this move one of these critics I call them he said what is this interviewing somebody what is this that is happening you could see it is something that is unknown something that is foreign to the new cycle and stuff and I could see where a genuine bride move the spirit of God would be something that out of the cycle of these false prophets and false manifestations and calls and false and false because God promised something genuine so what Abraham was seen here it was to be the age in which the true church would return to being the bride she was a Pentecost we knew that there must of necessity be a return to Dynamic power the believer sent this in their spirits and begin crying out to God for a new outpouring such as wars in the full century is it this happening again people sense in what about the break what seemed to be the answer came as many begin to speak in tongues and manifest gifts of the Spirit it was then believed that this was indeed the long-awaited restoration it was not October 1906 the good Pentecostal Revival right it was not for the later in which is the power that is promise which is the power people don't want to talk about they don't want to connect with the lettering can only come after the former Reign which is the spring or teaching ring the latter in Den is the Harvest rain how could this be the real thing when the teaching ring had not come the prophet messenger who was sent to teach the people until the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers had not yet come thus here we go what was thought to be the restoration and the final quickening under the Rapture had not come it was a mixture of the unrighteous partaking of spiritual blessings and manifesting in the Holy Ghost as we have kept pointing out to you in it so it had blessings manufacturing the Holy Ghost but in it also was devil power as men were under the control of devils yet no one seemed to realize it then to prove it was not real the real these people even before the second generation had appeared organized and wrote their unscriptural doctrines and build their own fences with every other group did ahead of them now what did the prophet talk about us he said we have the normal revivals we haven't had a real story no no no no no no no sir don't think we got revivals we haven't they got millions and millions and millions of Chief members but not a Revival nowhere the bride for tomorrow has another Revival yet see there'll be no Revival there no manifestation of God instead of bride yet we are looking for it one two it will take those seven unknown Thunders back there to wake up again three he will send it four he promised it and that is why it says this or we talk about Revival we're talking about it's a promise of God so brother Branham says you know that um okay the cool one is that to please God the passion to know his word the Christ reaching out in the spirit all begin to feed and instead of that church being on fire with the fire of God it has cooled off become a bit former and that is what was happening back dear to divisions they were getting a bit former the Abundant men to God was dying out and the people want to careful about what God taught of them as they begin to be careful but what the world for thought about now he says they were drifting that's what Ephesus mean drifting relaxed the cycle of Revival and death has never failed all you have to do is recall this last move of God in the spirit when men and women dressed by Christians went to church prayed all night took to the street corners wound ashamed of the manifestation of the spirit they left their old dead churches and worshiping homes in all store buildings they had reality but it wasn't too long a time until it began to get enough money to build five new churches but choir instead of singing unto God themselves they put guns and required they organize a movement ratted by man they took they soon begin to read books that weren't fit to read they let down the bars and goats came in took over there we go The Cry Of Joy was gone the freedom of the spirit was gone they kept one with form but the fire had died on and the Blackness of the ashes above all of us of course we realized that we are on the decline as far as I can see the historical ahead of us we are continually going on so every nation has to fall brother what we need tonight and what I'll do I will post this uh what we have in my notes here for you that you could read over yourself you can find the course you can read it to what we have here brother what we need tonight over the whole nation is an old-fashioned accent Revival and repentance here we go and this here is the key to January vinyl genuine Revival start with repentance people have to recognize they are wrong accordively it's not District right and that is wrong I can tell a brother recently I say what happened your church when you have one kind of believable who said that the prophet said that every Church of three kinds so it cannot be I chose that I did right you know foolishness that's all right every church has three kinds because what he got said so he said watch you see what we need it's an old-fashioned God temporary Bible and repentance for every Church and every individual to come back to God to the true and living God not the psychology not a theology what or of the church but what we need to come back to is the true and living God yet who changes the mind's heart changes his nature changes his makeup and makes him a new creature in Christ Jesus who kills all the nature of the world and makes a person a new creature is your Christian friend that's what the world needs tonight we don't need a program we need a regular program that Christ had a territory when he was here on Earth he said except I'm only born again he shall lose enter the kingdom what we need tonight we have got work on our program and everybody's soliciting and everybody he said brother the program lives right next to your heart Christ Jesus the holy spirit is trying to get into your heart as hard as he can and yet you shut him off listen to everything else beside the writing in court let the pocket of plix Point upon the nation business he says watch according to my we are we are the end right here the end time message here we go is to get the bride ready and prepare for the Rapture what can it do according to Malachi 4 is to bring them back to the feet that was once delivered to the Saints bring them back to the feet of the fathers here we go and this is how we identified bring them back to the feet of the fathers he said the Pentecostal part in the restoration time I will restore see of the Lord that's the real event in time evangelism so here we have ministers pastors teachers evangelists and everybody pumping Mysteries and Revelation and deep thoughts and all kind of stuff and things right and here he says bring them back to the feet of the fathers the Pentecostal path so in this message there is supposed to be a Pentecostal part that is Holy Spirit that is dynamics that is the power that's the equipment that's the final Awakening that's the lettering that's the Pentecostal part in the restoration of time I want a rapper Jesus ain't going to stand outside of your door unlock all the time there's a time when he will get enough and turn away then you will do the locket but you'll never find it come while there is time come while there's a luck don't you compromise with anything else and the baptism of the Holy Ghost like they got that Pentecost with the same type of water baptism and the same things back there everything okay acting composer so watch this here and sometimes I think about it I think about you going Ukraine winter time now you're fighting there's no think about this revival they have anything now it's very dear people going day and night I don't know what's going on with the students in the college and the teachings and what that but people pour in India they're singing It's like a permanent inspirational as far as I see this singing song and sing a song of worship and then jumping and carrying on but it's atmosphere that is carrying them through and here we are oh just can't be going through here it is something is pushing understand this it is real it is something that is promised it is it's important you expected it are you good piano so he said no you talk about and I want to close I wrap up here you talk about everything always hybrid the the hybrid corn he said we don't want nothing hybrid we want the genuine thing you haven't got to see the until it comes why accept a substitute when the Pentecostal sky is full of the real nothing hybrid he said you always have to spray a hybrid plant you can't keep the Box off it and that's the way some of these hybrid Christians you can't have to Baby them pet them promise them they'll be digging something else keep them some so they keep some really bugs off of them he said God here we go when he created his church he created a Pentecostal church that was the original not this dead seeing the amen no one again dry messaging no no no the original of the Pentecostal Church of Pentecostal church not denomination okay a Pentecostal Church filled with the Holy Ghost men and women led by the spirit of God but man couldn't leave that alone he wanted a hybrid a church he bred in the world with a theology denomination to make it a prettier church but it's different from the original Church we've got big buildings educated preachers the class of people if they watch polish up their scholarships and theology all the time taking them further away from God what foods what did he do he sent him in the upper room to wait there until the Holy Ghost Came Upon them to be ordained ministers of the Lord but I breeding bring the church to Theology and instead of letting the Holy Spirit leaded the bread and Bishops John overspears when the Holy Spirit is called Original leader of the church now let's take the tree our feet almost done let's take the tree of Fate that Eve taken of this forbidden tree of unbelief and watch Satan comedology she mixed it up and give it to Adam and it caused a hybrid fee see but I didn't talk about faith I talk about different stages and maturity and whatnot but there's also something called a hybrid feet and that's what the church has got today it's full country a hybrid feet it is liquid fears dogs frustrations it is if it was genuine Feast it would move when God's limiting it would be that way you see but she mixed it and that's the way people do it today they take what the Bible say and what Minds say you see that now that whole Library makes a hybrid feed when they do it makes a beautiful church but there's no life in it it's dead because of hybrid then he said these words I wish my words was wrote with an iron pen t with what God Said a truth hybrid feed says the read hip music level just by the scene yesterday and forever and then the hybrid field comes and say well in us 15 a week that's high good for you stay with the word he said what God sees stay with don't you interpreter with nothing I don't care what the bishop what he had Bishop what any man say stay right with that word oh my I get apart I'm gonna prove it wow yep foreign here we go he came to represent us before God sons and daughters and he sent his holy spirit now that he's brewing over the place trying to bring back to birth to die to ourselves it's a part it's the party to ourselves and be reborn again to be Sons and Daughters of God I think God of this world to believe God's word this is the part that is human lateral fleshly and our Ordinary People don't want to change they don't want to change and they're not seeing what they have to be changed too because change you can't just say I want to change or change your what you have to know what you're changing to is it giant ourselves to be reborn to be what sons and daughters either your father and mother represents you with Adam and Eve that's right when you were born in the world only were blocked it was ordained of God to bring children now you're right back to the same spot as in the government like the money from the doctors you're right back to two trees one of them was a tree of knowledge and the other was the Tree of Life he said man destroyed himself at the beginning separated himself from God from the fellowship by the tree of knowledge he left a tree of life to eat the tree of knowledge come away from that hybrid tree get over here into your original Fruit it's got life in it eat of him Jesus said I am the bread of life so friends there's a tree of knowledge tonight there's a tree of life that we have knowledge take the intellectual reading you know thinking about its side the Tree of Life takes one of this word and say I believe and they look for the rain to fall upon that seed of what they believe let's buy it heavenly father thank you to be here tonight and thank you for all those who Lord have heard what has been said and I pray and bless them Lord when they get on in prayer tonight they just think of a moving of your spirit and you are influencing the lives of young people in different places all by your grace and Lord your Prophet also prophesied that if the power of God is to come Among Us it wouldn't even be the prayer it will be the grace of God nobody expected what's going to happen that night that February 8th but it did and Justice as nobody could and yet we have the prophecies laying there that we can actually come on the expectation and the angel give your Prophet that scripture and it was praying in your closet that we call a toothbrush closet it's part of God as they go to that Prophet tonight and three but I'll meet each one here father give them a Revival revive the hearts without their mind revive their love and most of all may they return to the first love may this be a call to return not steal what we are in not just to be here last Friday because we have nothing else to do are we going to be here because we don't want to look like if we're not in church or we know we miss it no we want that love to store our hearts that love for you that love for your word that we love for your people that love to lay upon the order that love for the abandonment to God that we love to wait upon you as your privacy leader with upon the Lord shove you the strength Lord we wait in line buy phone card we wait in line to get distribute in line to get that but oh God we have a promise if we just wait upon the Lord sometimes it may take more than 10 minutes more than half an hour more than an hour
