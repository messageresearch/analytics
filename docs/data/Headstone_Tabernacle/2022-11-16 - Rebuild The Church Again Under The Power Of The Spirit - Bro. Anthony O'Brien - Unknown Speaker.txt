Psalms 118 verse 22 says the stone which the builders refuse is become The Headstone of the corner this is the Lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes this is the day which the Lord hath made we will rejoice and be glad in it amen and Zechariah 4 reading from verse 6. it says then he answered and speak unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto's Aruba Bell seeing not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts who art thou o great Mountain before is Aruba Bell Thou shalt become a plane and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace

privileged to me tonight amen to be here tonight amongst you in Fellowship praise God Amen so God bless you all tonight in a special way praise God Amen so I have a title amen God bless you and just for a few moments Pastor asked me to bring a thought here tonight so my title is rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit amen that's my thought tonight rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit and we know that that's a direct quote that the prophet preached on the message of Grace and I'll jump to it one time amen so that we uh we on the ball amen birth 50 he said and we know that the scripture says that Jesus is the Chief Cornerstone and he's also the headstone amen is Narayan he said now if we think for a few minutes that the seventh Church age messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers amen that's what he was sent to do isn't that right the prophet said in other words he was sent to rebuild the church again under the power of the spirits amen he said not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord not by organization not by deny Nation but by the Holy Spirit God will bring forth the church in the last day oh can we say amen hallelujah hallelujah he said the Ruba Bell was the prince with Joshua was the one that was to bring forth this headstone and he had laid a foundation he took the people back to the foundation in type amen isn't that rhyme praise God and this inspiration is a kind of special to me praise God because I thought about it when I uh when we were thinking about naming our son praise God and that inspiration come to me rebuild the church again in the power of the spirit praise God and how Ezra praise God and Nehemiah and how they were rebuilding the temple back in those days praise God in that right and Ezra had the census of the names that was to come back from Babylon praise God back to Israel back to repopulate back to rebuild back to restore praise what was destroyed what was ravaged what was demolished God was doing or repealing and I was thinking to myself there is going to be a generation of young people on this Earth who will witness another rebuilding or rebuilding of the church under the power of the spirits God is going to rebuild again oh Hallelujah God's got a generation on the earth oh Hallelujah glory to take on a witness they're going to be Witnesses of God rebuilding his church one more time oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to God Amen I believe that with all my heart praise God for this inspiration is special to me praise God and I was thinking about it praise God a few weeks ago and how God was just quickly to me that that's what he's been doing all these years what has God been doing it wasn't just by chance Luther or by chance Wesley or by chance praise God the Pentecostals rise up but God true ages and through churches and through generations has been building something oh Hallelujah on right under the devil's nose he's been doing something right in Secrets right Hallelujah right in front of Devil's face oh he can't even see it praise God but every life every church every saint has stepped forward every testimony that stand up oh that just shall live by faith what was it God was building something oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh come to find out that what God is building in this age is a rebuilding because he's built it before or it once existed and God's gonna have it again what he had in the alpha he's going to rebuild it again in the Omega you are gonna be a building or a restoration of the bright tree oh that fruit is going to come out at the top it's going to bring forth real oranges when it prints Fort oranges again oh Hallelujah it'll be going home time it'll be a Rapture in time it'll be another Original Seed another original fruits or we press away all these years old pressure heartache we press you pain we press shoot oil we press through trials intestines oh but we're gonna come to our promise god promise to rebuild again the church under the power of the spirit oh keep the Lord a shout a praise Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah praise God Amen are you happy tonight we have a promise of our rebuilding amen amen and it gives us a joy because we know that he can do it again it's based on a pattern it's based on a plan a blueprint that once existed this pyramid Bible or Halal that once stood on the Earth is going to stand again in Sons and Daughters of God God's going to rebuild that in you he's gonna build Faith put you upon your page knowledge upon your virtue Temperance upon your knowledge rebuilding rebuilding oh Hallelujah until you come into the stature of the fullness of Christ till we henceforth be no more children just to and fro by any wind of Doctrine but we're rooted and grounded in love predestinated unto the adoption of sons oh all about Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will oh that he had purpose in himself that in the dispensation of times oh hallelujah oh the word is Coming Alive Tonight glory to God hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah my to rebuild so you say on fire tonight amen I feel good the holy spirit is here amen rebuild what is it to build something again after it had been damaged or maybe destroyed rather isn't that right isn't that right it said when somebody's being built it's usually built according to a pattern according to a plan something isn't that right God in the beginning had a plan had a pattern of what his sons would look like or what his daughters would look like when he thought of you his thought of you was perfect oh Hallelujah isn't all right oh his foot's first thought was perfect when he spoke man in the beginning when he placed that man in the Garden of Eden oh that was a perfect place and he was in Perfection oh hallelujah's man that fell from that stage but when God placed his man he did a perfect job therefore if God is to place another man he has to do it the same way if God is a place another son another daughter of God into the kingdom of God he has to do it the same way oh that's why we are going back to another Garden of Eden we're going back to Adam we're going practice before the fall before before there was a moon before there was a star before there was a molecule you are going to burn back you have been repels being restored being regenerated being redeemed back back to our fallen Fallen condition oh Hallelujah oh in or anything Christ [Music] en that we're entering into now oh we know in parts and we prophesy in part but when tapped with this perfect is calm that which in part will be done away which we are coming to Perfection brother we are coming to a perfect Church where Jesus walking in it healing us sick raising the dead casting out troubles just like he did back there he'll do the same town here tonight oh do you believe it Hallelujah glory of God hallelujah oh Hallelujah amen so when he made man in the beginning it was a perfect establishment isn't that right perfectly established he was rightfully placed everything yeah therefore if God made another man you'd have to make he'd have to be like Adam it's not right you have to be spoken into that's why Christ when he come as a second Adam he's spoken to Mary said you're going to bring forth Christ isn't our Hail Mary not highly favored isn't that right praise God she asks how can these things be he said the Holy Ghost is going to overshadow you praise God Holly you're going to produce this Messiah this promised one that was to come to ages and generations you are the one Mary that was chosen and she told oh how she told the angel be a turn unto me according to Thy word and that was it she received a spoken word into season and that took life in her she believed the testimony so much she ran to her cousin and said I know something's taking place inside of me I know I heard a testimony oh Hallelujah Christ has reinformed in me oh you won't believe what happened you won't believe what I heard and she testified isn't that right glory to God hallelu will you have a genuine experience you testify amen you tell somebody about it praise God it's not right you don't just go all but you go and tell Prophet said go and tell the people something go tell them messiah's on here now go tell them to seek our heel go tell them to tell our race go tell them the blind sea one of these days God is going to anoint our church with such a power of the holy spirit that when they go they will go telling brother go tell my son amen all my people I am I am alive I am the same yesterday I am the same today I am the same forever go tell my disciples I am not dead go tell the people in this message that are sick of being healed that the terms speak not the blinds see that the walk that the gospel is preaching is power that same anointing that was over Malachi for profit it's promise will be upon you oh oh you're gonna walk in Jesus name you're gonna talk like Jesus You're Gonna Be Like Jesus You're Gonna manifest Jesus Christ in this last day give the Lord a shot of praise tonight Hallelujah glory to God amen amen amen my Hallelujah so here's the pattern one question answers the prophet said how many women here doesn't know that when you're going to cut a piece of goods he said you later Goods out like this and you lay a pattern on it like this and you cut the goods just according to the pattern is that right and the rest of the goods is just the same kind of good that's in the pattern is that right but this is the kind you take talk about the kind in the pattern that's the kind you take he said you might lay away that away for further use talking about a Remnant you might lay that away the goods that you cut off he said isn't that right he said now who places a pattern he said God by election amen isn't that right God by election places a pattern oh so the policing is his election oh him policing is the election oh he knows who would love him he knows from before the beginning who would choose those straight and narrower oh who would leave the highways come find Christ oh honey praise God in a secret place under the Shadow the almighty he knew oh hello who was predestinated in there he knew who was going to be sealed in there he knew your name from before amen so he said who plays the pattern gone by election God by election places a pattern he said no I have chosen before the foundation of the world I placed this he said why Jesus told the disciples what that when he was with them he said he had chose them isn't that right and he knew them before the foundational world was ever laid is that right so God places the pattern praise God that's the election I said now there'll be an elect that go into the Rapture praise God and there'll be a group of people that's good upright holy living oh you heard about that Sunday right amen amen God saved people huh and that no not being a Rapture they'd have to come up in a second Resurrection right he said amen so that's about the pattern isn't that right here's the prophet's talking about talking about it amen so therefore if God building anything he has to have a plan on how to build it isn't that right and if God is rebuilding the church again like what we're talking about tonight then it has to be according to a pattern that he has established the first time amen isn't that right Hallelujah Prophet said on dedication 1962 he said now if you notice Solomon never varied one bit from the pattern that Moses saw on Mount Sinai in heaven amen he said Moses when he returned from his vision he pitched the tent and he made it just exactly like he saw in heaven and when Solomon built the temple amen he's made it just exactly the way he's seen the pattern the type oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right oh Glory so God revealed to all Prophet Malachi 4 what this pattern is praise God therefore if you build according to this your bill thing according to that prophet and that Prophet is filling according to the pattern that he saw in heaven oh Hallelujah I haven't come down and reveal what this was a message to get her out of here oh brother we are building according to this the prophet said build me up into this oh Lord let Christ be my head let living in Me Faith and virtue and knowledge and Temperance that's what we're doing here tonight we're not here to occupy his face when I've had a warmer Church Branch we had to press our way into the kingdom of God we had a fight away we had to pray through pray without ceasing until every one of these virtues are living inside of your heart of mine oh that heart of yours tonight isn't that right oh get a lot of shout out praise Hallelujah that's what they're here for hey many men hallelujah hallelujah glory glory amen so we thank God for revelation they give us a Clear Vision of how to build of what to do praise God of what to do with this word the prophet said she will have the mind of Christ the intelligence to know what to do with his word and she does it in his name oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God Amen she said now notice praise God all right he said when Solomon built the temple he made it exactly the way he's seen the pattern the type he said Moses picture tent for a Perpetual type because it was moved from place to place but Solomon he made the Tabernacle just exactly in the fashion that Moses had seen in heaven amen it was put all together set in order just exactly amen he said what a spiritual application the prophet said that we could apply here that if we are never to leave the scripture he said stay exactly with the pattern oh say what the tape say oh God is obligated to meet you on the basis of the promises and by these they finally repeal promises we are partakers of the divine nature have an escape the corruption that is in the world true loss brother I'm beside myself tonight I'm here to stay with that promise stay with that word stay with that pattern or until I look like act like Walk Like Jesus talk like Jesus let me die let me be stripped let me be cut let me be horn let me be shaped let me do like Samson and die with my Philistines until every one of these virtues are living in me tonight oh is that the way you feel is that the way you feel tonight thank you Lord a shout of Praise hallelujah praise God Amen oh I'm fully persuaded and if we do these things oh hallelujah hallelujah we'll meet in the morning praise God glory to God hallelujah many men it's according to pattern amen it's according to the word isn't it right oh wow hey many men Glory Hallelujah he said stay with the pattern so the devil's job is going to get us off the beaten truck after beating the word get us distracted praise God get us off here and men's ideas man interpretation and the devil always bring the interpretation in a way that makes you bypass that process so that you think yourself a God or being like a god having wisdom and just like you told leave it's not right yeah having information praise God hallelujah but no life no Spirit to back it up no witness of his presence like Adam had a witness of God coming down on a cooler evening or when he fell out of his position when he fell out of his place he lost that anointing or he lost that Fellowship but God come down to restore the fellowship that's what he come down for oh Hallelujah to connect us back again oh Hallelujah isn't that right oh so now you could talk to God you can have a relationship with God you can have a conversation with god and there's therefore now no condemnation to them not walk not out to the flesh but I'm not walk after the spirits but then I walk after the spirit of God they are the sons of God oh you were predestinated tonight to be Sons and Daughters of God oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to God amen and amen wow said so see we never tell you the scripture stay exactly with the pattern he said that's the reason I believe that the way the first church was patterned that's the way the next one should be patterned that's the way everyone should be patented just the way that it was at the beginning he said and I believe that God has it that way do you believe that tonight amen that's just his way you've got to come God provided away you can't come your own way you can't come in your own mind in your own knowledge or your own intellectual emotions you've got to come the way he's said to come oh you got to come through the cross you got to come to the cross and through the cross oh Hallelujah isn't that right praise God Amen oh my six and I believe that God has it that way see I believe the real Church all right amen he said now the material is cut out in their native land was brought all into one place right different parts you know but but when they were brought together he said I'm reading now from the 16th chapter or quoting from it he said now when they were brought together they were so perfectly fit that in the space of 40 years that it taken to put the construction up he said there wasn't one stone to be a resort there wasn't a buzz of a saw there wasn't a sound of a hammer oh I had it for 40 years he said talk about masonry talk about architecture isn't that right pray God in silence doing our work oh the devil doesn't know anything about it oh what about it amen God has always been doing that in silence he hit David on the silence on the back side of the desert training him with a lion training him with a bear God always knew Goliath was coming but God always had a man he always had a ram in the bushes he always make provision God always provide a way he always have a plan of Escape oh yes they are trials yes they are testins but he make it a way of Escape for us oh Hallelujah Oh Glory Glory that it would not overcome you that it would have overwhelm you oh Hallelujah but he raises a standard in the last day he'll pour out his Spirit upon All Flesh upon the same word and bring it to life and make it live inside of you and you'll be together and you'll punch the devil and you'll bless that devil wide open oh hallelujah praise God hear me now oh if every Sunday in every age knock the enemy out what would seven Thunders do in this age brother God's Gonna wrap all seven Thunders he's gonna put it in a bride oh and she's gonna speak and it will flash like lightning oh give the Lord a shout Our Praise Hallelujah oh my my my my my glory to God hallelujah oh my glory day 11 tonight amen amen we're having a Time praise God Oh Glory this is great amen oh I feel so good I said no that showed Sea Watch he said talk about Misery right he said now that showed that when we are doing anything and doing it in a pattern that God has set for us amen it comes out perfect right said now many of these Stones look very odd he said but there was a place in the temple for every odd or peculiar Stone God had a place for them oh hallelujah it's not wonderful praise praise God Amen that's why we ought never to push anybody aside or say well this brother's order this sister's order we don't understand this one or don't understand no God's got a place for them God's got a place for every member in the party God's Gonna place with a big one the small one the medium-sized one doesn't matter who you are where you come from if God called you he has a place for you oh God the economy is big enough to find a chair for you to sit in come on now God the economy is big enough to find an office for you to fulfill come on now oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Oh Glory Glory Glory if God called you to raise corn raise corn don't try to fight somebody as land say I want to raise Bali hey man couldn't find a place Professor no placing see praise God you gotta praise God stay with what God give you amen is that right oh my God he has a place for you tonight amen it's not such an encouraging thought tonight praise God hallelujah hallelujah no no human minds are quick to filter things because we all live in our own version of reality isn't that right we all live in our own version of what the world is so when you see something or someone or whatever we tend to filter it through our own experiences praise God is Not and we tend to judge it from our own place and say well we think it's that or we think it's this praise God but if we look at the true God's eyes through his eyes of love if you look at it through his eyes you'll see that there's a place for everyone who are in God's Kingdom on the Scout the brother don't discount the sister pray for one another lift each other up pay each other up praise God provoke on another unto love and good works oh Hallelujah you see someone down pick him up oh we're running this race together brother oh I pray for you you pray for me and together we make it by the grace of God oh hallelujah hallelujah that's the attitude praise God Amen of the Prime amen the bride has that attitude amen praise God can't say the same for the church member but the bride's got that amen she's got those qualities isn't that right oh praise God all right so now what she said no many of these Stones look very odd but there was a place in the temple for every art to kill your stone God had a place for them wonderful he said all Ministry now watch which is a beautiful type there or an anti-type to it it shows that in all peculiarity or way of worship yet when the temple the real Temple that will come to after a few moments come together there'll be a place for every odd acting person there's a place for them praise God we might look a little funny to somebody else that's a little funny but remember it's a place here for us God is cutting out his church oh Hallelujah so don't mind me while I praise God don't mind me while I shout and give him praise there's a place for me and there's a place for you my brother there's a place for you my sister in the promised land isn't that right praise God and every little Stone how this place fit exactly to it hey man I remember it was cut away from the place it would be put together at but when it come together oh it didn't even need honing it was already honed oh hallelujah what a condition to be in when God's getting ready to place the thing it's already horned oh you want to have your extra in other words you have to have your extra oil already when the pride boom comes will you be ready you've got to have the extra oil then you can't be now looking to go and get oil because while they went out to buy the bridegroom came and the door was shut so you got to be already own ready to just be fit into it praise the place in here place in there the placing of our sons amen holidays my spirit phone freely I can place him I can place her adoption time oh hello already home already shaped already fit to cut Amen to catch that headstone praise God Amen that's the condition we're going to be in so tonight what we come for honing no can somebody say a man fellow just got quiet honing that's what we come for shaping we come for cutting come for hard trials test cents amen rebuke up some days down the necks but we aren't going on to something we're traveling on to Jerusalem traveling on to the promised land oh Hallelujah we've got a promise up the road oh and do it get hot and wary oh Hallelujah know your feet by feet are fall oh but you got their eyes on Calvary you got your guys on the end of the road hallelujah amen and you know there's something up yonder for you praise God a place that God has for you isn't that right amen amen amen God made to fit so perfectly amen into its place what a type there we find a spiritual hope that every gift of God every God act every odd Act of born-again Christians and their peculiarity yes it's got a place it fits in the body it goes into right into his place and many of us would would try to say now that's not of God or some think the a good wholly consecrated sword at a cross and then he said now and he's and we say he said now now sit at church the other night and we heard such and such a thing that can be of God but if it's in line with the pattern if it's in line with the Scripture it may be odd but it's going to have its place see once it's in line with that scripture it'll have its place it'll fit right in he said and it won't even need honing or polishing he said it'll go right into its go into its place for the great architect Christ is preparing it now oh Hallelujah God wants another but he's preparing it now isn't that right he said now listen when they built the temple of Solomon now there he said and any of you Masons out here he said would get this pretty good he said they brought the Cedars from down Lebanon they flew to them as far as Joppa haul them by Ox cart and so forth you know he said they cut out all those stones around the world he said but when they come together they were such perfect masonry in 14 years building up the temple wasn't a buzz or Hammer right every stone cut this week cut that way amen everyone has cut this week cut back this way every one of them went together he said what's your prophet he said no he said they started laying them relaying the thing putting the building up getting along fine and then they found a funny looking Stone and he said they didn't want that thing he said that don't belong here he said and they kicked it out throw that over in the weed pile he said and then they come to find out then when they built on and on and on and on come to find out that very Stone they had rejected was the Chief Cornerstone oh mercy isn't that right Jesus said so he said and today the methodists the Baptist the Lutheran the Pentecostals everywhere around if you don't watch out friends he said the real Cornerstone he said you will be rejecting it he said on the cornerstone in the building of the spiritual house is the holy spirit oh let's nail that in tonight amen what is the Cornerstone tonight it is the holy spirit oh and somehow the builders have rejected it oh Hallelujah are the pillars and this message have rejected it but the same could stone that ugly Stone where it's torn with a bunch of people screaming and hollering and rolling on a crown and receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost that same Stone God's gonna make the chief of the corner he's going to make it The Headstone and he bring forth the head stone which shoutens crying Grace Grace unto it oh I feel tonight though you'll be rejected come on now don't you though you'd be the spies don't you be rejected a man God's gonna work his way out of you Jacob Grace Joseph Perfection Capstone word nothing against Joseph that is called working his way out in your life in this message in this church God it's working its way out tonight he's gonna call a brighter Perfection maybe you my Christian brother maybe you my Christian sister maybe you my Christian friend or that comes to Perfection to bring on the resurrection oh oh get on a shot of Praise Hallelujah oh wonderful did you get that man Oh Glory wonderful good amen well we could close out am I Glory Hallelujah my that was it The Headstone is the holy spirit same Corner soon becomes a headstone it's all the Holy Spirit see you're afraid of it he said is it the Holy Spirit Holy Spirit I'm calling out he said you're afraid of it he said you're afraid of fanaticism he said I know we got a lot of old scarecrows and mockery he said why if there wasn't that there wouldn't be a real one oh well it just goes to show that there's a real one oh all the people pretending this and doing that praise God but there's a genuine Holy Spirit he said that there was not there wouldn't be a real one but there's a genuine article of the holy spirit in the baptism oh he said that's true all right oh praise God is that what you want tonight Hallelujah a genuine article a bona fide praise God a real deal hey man not a KFC's lunch or a real deal praise God Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah glory amen real baptism of the Holy Ghost amen oh that's true he said all right amen and now they've rejected it said say oh we can't do that oh we can't have that brother around him see see they rejected dedication he said now we get to find out when it's taking place Stephen speak of it he said our fathers found a favor before God and Solomon built him a temple how be it most high dwell not in temples made with hands as the prophet said Heaven is my Throne the Earth is my footstool huh and where's our house that you could build me he said Heaven is my Throne which is my footstool how could you build me a house to dwell in he said but then now look how beautiful the prophet said Hebrews 10 5 said but our body has thou prepared me oh Hallelujah so what's God dwelling in a party he wants your party tonight Hallelujah without prepared me showing that God was going to dwell in a body oh in a body Christ the church praise God in your body praise God isn't that right is that right because it's rebuilding the part rebuilding the church again in the power of spirit right so he's rebuilding what is he rebuilding the church what is the church made of individuals that he builds himself into they are who make up the church and that is what he is rebuilding he builds his individuals the same way faithful to know several patients and he sealed the whole thing with Charity praise God him and he builds his individual and the church the same way and they're caught up to meet him in the Rapture oh Hallelujah in the wedding supper praise God Amen Hallelujah a spiritual house isn't that right amen that's what it's about amen oh praise God he said when this body had been made a sacrifice the correct lamb had been sacrificed they was coming forth then God came to his own body which was his bride he said and that had been 120 temples catch what he's saying now it's ritual thinking caps he said get 100 there had been 120 temples that God had created and was ready for dedication amen 120 on the upper room isn't that right and they had all got all their unbelief beat out of them oh Hallelujah they were already owned Hallelujah already shaped pray already got their thoughts out of it only got the emotions going all caught up kicked out praise God Amen they were ready for policing and then down come the Holy Spirit praise God they got him in your room he said they waited for 10 days for dedicational service he said and then went completely surrendered God came down again in the Shekinah Glory and fill all the house where they were setting oh he said what did God do like the ark dropping down into the proper sockets for the message of that day God dropped back into his proper channel into each one isn't that right Peter James John isn't that right Court dropped on into his proper Channel not until denomination or a building maybe it hands but Into the Heart of men oh into your hearts into my heart dropping down deity dropping down failing himself oh Hallelujah in your flesh oh that's what I want tonight who I want I want that kind of blessing that saves and seals and satisfies my soul a fire come down from God out of Heaven to seal your fate up to seal up the word in you and to make it alive by many infallible proofs that he has risen from the dead and he is alive in your hands he's alive on your feet walking to the hospital room speak the word and watch a sick here watch a dumb speak watch a gospel preaching his power oh God proving himself on the spot that's what we're coming back to that's what we're being rebuilt that's what's being restored back again in this end time do you believe it tonight oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Music] he said he dropped in this place for the last day which said the prophet Joel said it has come to pass in the last days I'll pour out my Shekinah upon All Flesh Prophet put here amen your sons and daughters shall prophesy your young men shall dream dreams your old man shall see Visions God came to his resting place where he finds rest oh not in a building but in the heart of his people he finds his rest oh Hallelujah [Music] he said but when God came to his own Temple the church the people when he came to them he spilled it the temples that were dedicated he lied just like he did in Solomon's Temple he filled it not but Creeds not denominations but with himself he filled the temple with his Shekinah Glory and so did he do on a day of Pentecost he failed them 120 temples was up there fill them with himself with the Holy Ghost itself the Shekinah Glory broke through upon them and then what Nimrod failed to do build a temple praise God stuff like that God came down with one Galilean language meet every man understand it what he was saying it is not right he revealed it again isn't that right oh my God First John 3 and verse 2 said beloved now we the sons of God and the dot not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall begin to appear we shall be like him oh are you going to be made in His image brick privick Brick by Brick he's not made in His image line up online here little there little till we all come to the unity of the faith unto the knowledge of the Son of God unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ a second Peter 1 4 7 isn't that right amen amen start your perfect man Prophet said here here you are seven Church ages seven steps God building his church like one person into an individual into himself he said the glory the power of God coming down through this I love how he describes this here let me just bring this out here he said welding it together oh my the power of God that's what it's doing the glory the power coming down through this drumming down through all this Bodywork he said and it's welding it together he said and therefore the Pentecostal people that let out the Lutheran let out the weslians and things doesn't know what they're talking about you see they live this part of the temple right he's pointing to it he said that way and some people can come up that high and drop off see some people could only come so far up to Godliness maybe at the early kindness right but then they'll fall off seeing at some point he said but there's a genuine part of that that keeps making that building come on he said another life keep coming up through processes yeah but it's a life that remains the systems don't carry the life praise God it's just for a part it's just a scaffolding but our life is coming through up to Lucha up to Wesley up to the Pentecostal pray though it was our life we come back to the life of the top of the tree and that's what we come into now a genuine oh the prophet said this is the age of personal life through the midst of God he will revive you oh Hallelujah Hallelujah to the shadow to the Sea brought to the Tempest wherever he's leading you don't worry you're safe with him no matter if the storms flow no matter if the winds blow contrary as long as I'm in his hands oh I'll walk with him he'll talk with me he'll show me things to come Hallelujah because of who you are because of who Abraham was he said shall I had from Abraham what I'm about to do the angel of God come down Hallelujah to tell Abraham what was fixing to happen and go because of who you are tonight he sent you Malachi for the prophet to let you know that there's a Rapture coming that this world is going to burn but you are promised her Rapture you are promised So Glorious wonderful baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire where there's faith and virtue and knowledge and Temperance in your soul Hallelujah oh can we give the Lord a shot of Praise hallelujah praise God in many many many many many men [Music] Oh Glory Glory Glory Glory I could preach this all night praise God until five in the morning amen I don't mean it's gay I'm getting ready hallelujah praise go but this is good amen wonderful praise God Amen hi the glory the power they live this part right oh but there's a there's a genuine part see I will restore say the Lord he said you remember the Bright Tree you remember the Silverman of the Bright Tree he said they eat it down but he pruned it they got denominational branches he pruned them off they raised up another church then optional denominational branches sorry he pruned it off but the heart of the tree kept growing growing coming up right and in the evening times had it shall be light see that's when comes Christ the Holy Spirit Jesus comes down and sets himself at the head of the church then and he will resurrect this church being in his own body in there in in his is the body isn't that right amen praise God I hope I wasn't too chopped up praise God Amen but but that's the way God is expecting us as an individual to grow the way that he's brought his church into Rome see every Church age it becomes one big church he said you see he said this fellow wasn't required it wasn't uh okay let me skip this one down here okay he said but he brought his church up to the same way he brought his church up to the same way he's bringing his people up and then Peter here says first seven things Faith virtue see coming up knowledge Temperance patience godliness pretty love adverted kindness and then the love of God the Holy Ghost amen Christ in the person of the Holy Ghost comes upon you in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost he said and you've got all these virtues sealed in you and then God lives in a tabernacle praise God called the building amen the living Tabernacle of the living God's dwelling place oh that's what you become on the earth oh you're gonna prove every one of those virtues right in the face of the temple right in the face of the darkness in this hour the darkness and the schools talked us in the workplaces darkness on the street right in the midst of everything else for all the Abominations are taking place you're gonna lift these virtues oh doesn't that give you a final Soul tonight many men God's Gonna prove his word God's Gonna rebuild this church again oh no wonder the prophet said I'm only building I'm only laying a foundation for a short quick message that'll shake the whole nation won't be many up there Prophet said it gets narrower as they get to the top he said we draw it this way to fit those words and stuff in there but it gets narrower much much narrower but he's got to get to the top many fall off but God has an elected bride to go all the way up brother Somebody's gotta catch that stone to bring on the resurrection oh maybe you my Christian brother maybe you my Christian friend to catch that stone today amen hallelujah glory to God amen amen Oh Glory you see when a man possesses these kinds of things then the Holy Ghost comes upon him no matter you might speak in tongues no matter you might implicit in every gift that God's Got You might do that but until these virtues here got into you he said you're still off the real True Foundation of Faith yeah so but when these virtues grow in and you've added to that he said then you are a living Monument he said you are a living moving Idol he said and then he explains it to you he said but you know the Heathen they prostrate themselves before an idol before an imaginary God in an imaginary way and they believe that imaginary God speaks back to them he said that's Hedonism he said that's romanism he said they bow before everything else he said it's not right he suddenly actually believe it that way he said what a type of the true and living God he said but when we he said not in an imaginary way but prostrate ourselves before a living God he said a living put you a living knowledge a living patience a living godliness a living power come from a living God makes our living man a Living Image in the stature of God oh Hallelujah he said what's he doing the same thing that Jesus did walking the same way he walked doing the same things he did because it's not an imaginary thing they there's a reality that proves it amen living in a reality amen of a resurrected Lord Jesus Christ isn't that right amen I think we've drive it home praise God hallelujah so God builds the church again under the power of the spirit I'm getting ready to wind up praise God Amen under the power of spirit not by Creed not by denomination but by the spirit of the Living God isn't that right Zechariah 4 6 what we read here not by might not by power how's he going to do it by his Spirit oh hell it won't be built on Creeds won't be built on Darkness bony built on men's ideas praise God won't be built on what we think it is but only on the on the power of God Amen under the power of the spirit that's how God's

I'll finish amen uh musician get ready to come so Revival and all day he said how can we have it when the regular Revival Giver is bound by the world he said God won't come where the world is he said you could just depend on that he said you associate with the world he said then it's all of it he said but when you let the world creep in he said you go to acting like the world he said then you're finished he said but when you cut loose of every feta from the world and you come to God he said God will use you until you go to flirting again he said but here's the only hope that I have this
