[47:47] you think I could play anointing fall on
[47:51] me we had a blessed time with the young
[47:55] people yesterday but those that were
[47:58] here and I touched on something that we
[48:04] shared with the officers last week I see
[48:07] on people what do you own what is yours
[48:10] what belongs to you because the Bible
[48:14] says in Psalms 24 the earth is the
[48:17] Lord's and the fullness thereof the
[48:21] world and they that dwell therein so
[48:24] caught into this Bible everything
[48:25] belongs to God it's not your card and
[48:29] brought you here this morning it's God's
[48:31] car he owns it he has entrusted you with
[48:35] it that you have custody over it but
[48:37] it's his it's not your house is his
[48:39] house set his grace provided for you
[48:41] that you could have a place to put your
[48:43] head at night but it is your time is not
[48:46] your time it's his time and we are
[48:48] living on his time the food that you eat
[48:51] what you have it's his all belongs to
[48:54] him the earth is the Lord's and the
[48:55] fullness thereof the trees belong to him
[48:58] the shirt that you are wearing belongs
[49:00] to him the seat that you're sitting on
[49:03] belongs to him the person was next to
[49:05] you belongs to him everything belongs to
[49:08] him and that gives us a reason to thank
[49:10] him because we have not earned anything
[49:13] we didn't work for anything he provided
[49:17] everything the earth is the Lord's and
[49:19] the fullness thereof and for this we are
[49:22] glad this morning because he has
[49:23] provided a room a space of grace in time
[49:26] for us to give Him praise with him for
[49:29] us to give him glory for us a thank him
[49:31] for what he has
[49:33] and in Stubing an is a powder to in your
[49:35] life that you didn't even realize can
[49:37] the church name and we shared with young
[49:41] people that God made an investment by
[49:47] depositing something inside of you that
[49:51] you didn't know what's there so when the
[49:55] time came for him to get his return on
[49:57] investment he went to Gideon and said
[49:59] Gideon the mighty man of Valor
[50:01] he wasn't now putting it into Gideon it
[50:03] was already there Gideon just didn't
[50:05] know what was deposited in him and God
[50:08] came to get his return on his investment
[50:11] because when he came to Gideon's house
[50:13] it was to get a return he had a purpose
[50:16] and a plan that Gideon was supposed to
[50:18] accomplish that Gideon didn't realize he
[50:20] was supposed to accomplish because the
[50:22] deposit that God made him Gideon's soul
[50:24] he didn't tell Gideon's father he didn't
[50:26] tell Kyrian's mother
[50:27] he didn't tell Tyrion schoolteacher he
[50:30] didn't tell Tyrians pastor God made the
[50:32] deposit in him and God is looking for
[50:34] his return investments and for everyone
[50:37] here who is called by his name go a
[50:39] Miller deposit into you it's a seed of
[50:42] predestination it's a seed and in that
[50:45] seed has power brother Branham said to
[50:47] reproduce itself it could only produce
[50:50] itself it could only produce what's
[50:52] inside and God is looking for a return
[50:56] on investment
[50:57] what is his return on investment the
[50:59] same work I do shall you do also and
[51:02] greater than these that shall you -
[51:04] because I go unto my father that's the
[51:07] return cord didn't put something in you
[51:09] to get nothing back he wants to get
[51:11] praise back he wants to get worship back
[51:13] he wants you to to stir things up in
[51:16] your home stir things up on your job
[51:19] stir things up you may be seated
[51:24] I several young people but the Branham
[51:27] said the bride would be a cuted
[51:29] hunted group something would have to
[51:32] happen that cause us to be hunted
[51:34] something has to happen to call us to be
[51:37] persecuted this is a meeting that's
[51:39] disruptive this morning because we are
[51:41] interrupting what the devil is doing we
[51:43] are interrupting the plans we are
[51:45] interrupted what's going on in in the
[51:47] hearts of certain people this morning
[51:49] sister Christina swung at the angiogram
[51:51] and we are interrupting the machine that
[51:54] has to get the report of what's happened
[51:56] or you don't hear me this morning
[52:01] hallelujah
[52:02] we are interrupting what's happening
[52:04] with your daughter this morning we are
[52:05] interrupting what's happening with your
[52:07] son this morning we are interrupting
[52:09] what's happening in your body this
[52:11] morning by the power of the resurrected
[52:13] Christ and the power of the Holy Ghost
[52:16] that's the commission that's given to us
[52:18] we are interrupting your old age right
[52:21] now it looks like you get it all but we
[52:24] are interrupting that you are in fact
[52:27] getting younger and even if you give up
[52:29] this body you have another body waiting
[52:31] for you you may be seated
[52:36] [Applause]
[52:40] [Music]
[52:41] everything on earth is defined by
[52:43] terrestrial law is the time by the laws
[52:46] of the earth but when we come to
[52:48] churches to get access not to the law
[52:50] but to the law makeup because the law
[52:54] maker could move things around and he
[52:56] operates on a higher law law that is
[52:59] beyond this single earth that we live in
[53:01] because he's a good not just of this it
[53:03] he's accorded the universe he's a God of
[53:05] the stars he's a God who could put the
[53:07] Sun in place and move things around all
[53:10] for his purpose is nothing out of
[53:12] control this morning in your life if
[53:14] there's a trial that's hard for you to
[53:17] handle be confident be happy that God
[53:20] designed this trial for you it's your
[53:25] trial on it it's your problem on it God
[53:30] designed it to bring out the best in you
[53:32] to bring it a character in you because
[53:34] he is confident that the scene he put in
[53:37] your soul is able to withstand greater
[53:40] is He that's in you than he that's in
[53:42] the world
[53:43] no devil could stop it no demon could
[53:45] stop it no principality no power nothing
[53:49] past
[53:49] nothing present nothing to come nothing
[53:52] under near nothing anywhere can stop the
[53:54] plan of God concerning you and the
[53:58] church amen
[54:02] hallelujah you may be seated
[54:05] I don't know what's gonna happen this
[54:07] morning but we have not been this way
[54:09] before
[54:10] but we are looking one of these days I
[54:12] said to the young people one of these
[54:14] days we'll have the last song service
[54:15] wonders even have the last service in
[54:18] the house of the last time but the Panem
[54:20] said you'll open the Bible in the pulpit
[54:21] because this Bible has for a long time
[54:24] been transferring a secret message God
[54:27] never wanted his glory to be in book
[54:30] form
[54:30] he wanted his glory to be in 16 elements
[54:33] of this book was to hold a mystery until
[54:37] certain people came along this book was
[54:40] a means to transfer a file Oh glory to
[54:44] God hallelujah you may be seated
[54:48] [Applause]
[54:51] hallelujah I feel like we're now
[54:54] starting to warm up I feel like telling
[54:56] a warm up a little bit
[54:57] testing the temperature a little bit
[55:00] before we get to the scriptures I wanna
[55:02] make sure this army is ready for plateau
[55:05] because we are going toward it's morning
[55:07] you're going to offer the young people
[55:10] we're going to war for marriages we're
[55:12] going to war because Adam because Elijah
[55:15] because Moses because Jeremiah because
[55:18] when the Planum they are waiting on us
[55:20] to bring the knockout puncher that is
[55:23] devil who has fought for all these years
[55:25] is about to come to his end he may be
[55:30] seated

[55:37] a flashdrive pendrive what do you want
[55:40] to call it
[55:41] there's nothing unless you are
[55:44] connecting it to something if you have
[55:47] files on a computer and you want to move
[55:50] it to another computer one of the ways
[55:54] to do it is to get a flash drive and you
[55:56] transfer the files to the flash drive
[55:58] and then you could go somewhere else
[56:00] another country perhaps and in another
[56:02] computer you could take that flash drive
[56:04] and put it in the other computer and
[56:05] access the files that's on the flash
[56:09] drive the job of the flash drive is to
[56:12] transport as the carry as is what was
[56:15] originally placed on the computer on
[56:17] this side so God Almighty had some file
[56:20] some and in those files had power in
[56:23] those files had certain operations in
[56:25] the past had the ability to do something
[56:28] so God had to find a way to make a
[56:30] transfer from the computers up in heaven
[56:33] but some sons and daughters who would be
[56:36] in 2019 and yet the final way to keep
[56:39] this file in order to keep this file
[56:42] safe he put an anti-virus on this flash
[56:45] drive he put the precautions on this
[56:48] flash drive the prophets carefully and
[56:51] all of this flash drive so when you come
[56:54] along you didn't know who you were you
[56:58] didn't know what you were called to do
[57:00] you didn't know what you were born to do
[57:02] but then when you come and you come into
[57:04] the house of God it's to get connected
[57:06] and cortex that flash driver and begin
[57:09] to do a download operation that's why
[57:11] the Prophet said when the Holy Ghost sub
[57:14] is downloaded into your soul it'll make
[57:16] you dance
[57:17] it'll make you jump up it'll make you
[57:20] shout up it'll make you see hallelujah
[57:22] you can't even explain it but it's a
[57:25] file tall order from your father up in
[57:27] heaven can the church Famer

[58:40] Thank You musicians if you have your
[58:43] Bibles will return it meter to portions
[58:45] of scripture reading Matthew 24 and
[58:48] reading from acts 19 Matthew 24 and from
[58:54] verse 40 Matthew 24 and verse 14 then
[59:03] shall two be in the field the one shall
[59:06] be taken and the other left two shall be
[59:11] grinding at the mill the one shall be
[59:14] taken and the other left
[59:16] what's there for for ye know not what
[59:19] hour your Lord doth come but know this
[59:23] that if the Goodman of the house had
[59:25] known in what watch the thief would come
[59:28] he would have watched and would not have
[59:30] suffered his house to be broken up
[59:33] therefore be also ready for in such an
[59:36] hour as you think not the Son of man
[59:40] cometh and reading acts 19 and verse 1
[59:43] and brother Branham said that this
[59:45] particular scripture was the theme of
[59:48] every apostle and it came to pass that
[59:51] while Apollo's was a current Paul having
[59:54] passed through the upper coast came to
[59:56] Ephesus and finding certain disciples he
[1:00:00] said unto them have ye received the Holy
[1:00:02] Ghost since he believed and they said
[1:00:05] unto Him we have known not so much as
[1:00:08] heard whether there be any Holy Ghost so
[1:00:10] the Holy Ghost was not being preached to
[1:00:13] them we have not so much as heard
[1:00:15] whether there be any Holy Ghost so they
[1:00:17] were there in Ephesus they were
[1:00:18] believers but the Holy Ghost was not
[1:00:21] being preached to them and he said unto
[1:00:22] them unto what Dan ye baptized and he
[1:00:25] said unto John's baptism and then said
[1:00:27] paul john verily baptized with the
[1:00:31] baptism of repentance seeing unto the
[1:00:33] people that they should believe on him
[1:00:35] which shall come after him that is on
[1:00:37] christ jesus when they heard this they
[1:00:39] were baptized in the name of the lord
[1:00:42] jesus and when paul had laid his hands
[1:00:44] upon them the Holy Ghost came on them
[1:00:46] and they speak with tongue
[1:00:48] and prophesied me the Lord had a
[1:00:51] blessing to the reading of his word you
[1:00:53] may be seated for a title this morning
[1:00:59] is have you received the Holy Ghost
[1:01:02] since you believed I believe it's a
[1:01:07] fitting message and it's a message that
[1:01:09] we could preach almost every service
[1:01:13] because the question is not have you
[1:01:15] received a message the question is not
[1:01:18] have you received church the questions
[1:01:20] that have you received doctor and the
[1:01:21] question is have you received our Holy
[1:01:24] Ghost since you believe so even as a
[1:01:27] believer there is something to receive
[1:01:31] believing and receiving are two
[1:01:33] different things
[1:01:34] so when you talk about the Holy Ghost
[1:01:37] you're talking about something external
[1:01:40] to yourself you know when I was
[1:01:44] reflecting on the scripture be not
[1:01:46] conformed to this world but be
[1:01:48] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:01:51] I was looking at those words conformity
[1:01:55] conforming to receive so be not shipped
[1:01:59] to this world but be transformed and
[1:02:02] transform means the properties that you
[1:02:06] are made up of is actually changed and
[1:02:09] the church say Amen so there are people
[1:02:11] who actually conformed to church you
[1:02:13] know but it's the same properties is the
[1:02:16] same person it's just like taking as the
[1:02:20] Prophet set of pig and and washing the
[1:02:22] pig and beating the pig and put in
[1:02:24] Cologne under pig and put in a bowtie
[1:02:26] and a pig that's conforming and once the
[1:02:30] pig is under enough pressure the pig
[1:02:33] will be here if you keep the pig away
[1:02:37] from all the mud the pig is on his best
[1:02:40] behavior because there's no mud lock to
[1:02:44] pick up in a beautiful clean house with
[1:02:46] no mud with no fills the pig will have
[1:02:50] to adapt to his environment
[1:02:52] but that's what legalism is so people
[1:02:57] try in the message to legalize this
[1:02:59] thing and keep pigs locked up in cages
[1:03:02] and see well look they're behaving but
[1:03:05] the moment the kids have a little hole
[1:03:08] this big finds a way to push himself out
[1:03:11] because he hasn't been transformed he
[1:03:14] has just confirmed but when you are
[1:03:16] transformed you're no longer a pig when
[1:03:20] you transform you become a lamb when you
[1:03:23] transform your desires change and your
[1:03:26] appetite changes your first genes or
[1:03:29] what attracts you changes what motivates
[1:03:33] you changes what inspires you changes
[1:03:36] because you have been transformed when
[1:03:38] you look into the mirror the way you're
[1:03:40] used to look you can't even recognize
[1:03:42] yourself you want to know who is that
[1:03:44] looking back at you because something is
[1:03:47] different you you're here cut different
[1:03:49] you you walk different you talk
[1:03:50] different you're different you live in
[1:03:53] your family I recognize you
[1:03:55] your wife want to know what happened to
[1:03:57] you your husband want to know what
[1:03:59] happened because you have been
[1:04:00] transformed by the word transformed by
[1:04:04] the spirit transform I'm gonna better
[1:04:06] preach a message the transforming power
[1:04:08] of God and he said the Holy Ghost of
[1:04:11] spirit is what is the transforming power
[1:04:16] hallelujah hallelujah now the world has
[1:04:20] its place the mechanics have its place
[1:04:23] of the mechanics is the network the
[1:04:26] neural network that connects all the
[1:04:28] pieces but when the dynamics comes it
[1:04:31] comes to activate this network up so
[1:04:33] every service you come the mechanics
[1:04:35] comes to you as word in other words like
[1:04:37] recipes it comes as instructions it
[1:04:41] comes as inspiration
[1:04:43] it comes as revelation but spirit and
[1:04:46] revelation is two different things
[1:04:47] pizza had a revelation tower the
[1:04:50] Chrysler pizza had word God open their
[1:04:53] understanding to the scriptures but when
[1:04:55] he cooked to the day of Pentecost up and
[1:04:57] he were in one place up in one mind
[1:05:00] in one Accord er under one expectation
[1:05:03] with one burden with one desire up with
[1:05:06] one expectation the holy ghost up which
[1:05:10] was what was promised him I made the
[1:05:15] word lived him and made all the
[1:05:18] experiences come alive now all of a
[1:05:21] sudden they had to take note that these
[1:05:23] disciples had been with Jesus they had
[1:05:25] to take note that Peters walk was
[1:05:27] different people are new Pizza say that
[1:05:30] is not the same man
[1:05:31] people who knew Andrew and James knew
[1:05:33] that is not the same man and one of
[1:05:35] these days people will look at you and
[1:05:37] say that's not the same man that's not
[1:05:39] the same woman and God loves to get
[1:05:43] glory for it
[1:05:44] because you go to your mess and your
[1:05:46] mistakes and you can't even help
[1:05:48] yourself but the Holy Ghost comes a
[1:05:51] change shooter Holy Ghost comes a chance
[1:05:53] for you the Holy Ghost comes to turn
[1:05:55] things around and the church say man I'm
[1:06:10] gonna take my time this morning the
[1:06:14] purpose of the endtime message the whole
[1:06:17] purpose of the endtime message was to
[1:06:19] lose the Holy Ghost because given T
[1:06:26] power for us to make it to the rapture
[1:06:29] but the Brandon said this bride will
[1:06:31] stop cancer this bride will stop
[1:06:35] diseases this bride will stop all kinds
[1:06:38] of powers all kinds of sicknesses it is
[1:06:41] that talk that will doing that it'll
[1:06:43] have to be power to do that it'll have
[1:06:45] to be the spirit to do that so the whole
[1:06:48] purpose of all these ages and
[1:06:50] generations was record the Great
[1:06:52] Architect the great scientist great
[1:06:55] designer who wanted a finer way to
[1:06:58] replicate himself to find vessels in
[1:07:01] this day and this age that he could use
[1:07:03] can the church say Amen now the Holy
[1:07:06] Ghost but a random total was bound at
[1:07:08] the river Euphrates for almost 2,000
[1:07:10] years
[1:07:11] but Christ the Son of man feel in the
[1:07:14] Prophet loose the Holy Ghost
[1:07:16] loose your inheritance loose your
[1:07:18] promise not the Holy Ghost as a but but
[1:07:21] the life itself because the Pentecostals
[1:07:24] had had movement and feelings and had
[1:07:26] the spirit upon their flesh but this is
[1:07:28] different this is sustainable power this
[1:07:30] is not live under the anointing and go
[1:07:32] back home and do foolishness but it says
[1:07:34] God on the inside him in control he is
[1:07:38] directing he is meeting can the church
[1:07:41] say Amen I want to read a quote and then
[1:07:47] touch something are you with me this
[1:07:49] morning everybody on expectation in the
[1:07:53] message Cyrus that's the matter it is to
[1:07:56] deal with the people that's the matter
[1:07:58] with America tonight we can say tuning
[1:08:00] out of where our tonight the only thing
[1:08:02] I conceive America from a total
[1:08:04] annihilation
[1:08:05] is to return to God with the baptism of
[1:08:08] the Holy Ghost
[1:08:10] that's the only thing return to God with
[1:08:13] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's
[1:08:15] exactly right that's right and they're
[1:08:17] scared of it who is scared of it scared
[1:08:23] of this thing you know why it has make
[1:08:25] it change
[1:08:30] [Music]
[1:08:34] but people some people don't want to
[1:08:36] change them you see me this is how I am
[1:08:39] this is you love it or I don't like it
[1:08:42] take it you could take a break and leave
[1:08:44] it this is me this is and people have
[1:08:48] your dassies but this is how god make me
[1:08:49] not for that bad attitude you might say
[1:08:54] Beach and somebody renewing of your mind
[1:08:56] to renew the world renew means to bring
[1:08:58] it back to how it was when it was new in
[1:09:06] order to reboot your mind because over
[1:09:07] time all of the principalities and
[1:09:10] powers and it devil is he is the Prince
[1:09:12] of the power the air in mess up minds
[1:09:14] and that mind mess of a people
[1:09:18] conformance or the in church but they
[1:09:20] conformed into the world they come into
[1:09:21] children reading books but but there's
[1:09:23] no prayer life that's a conformance in
[1:09:25] the world no desire it they're not
[1:09:29] singing the songs of Zion first thing in
[1:09:30] the morning they're not going to do I
[1:09:33] need to drive down that road or I can
[1:09:35] make a u-turn and come back out because
[1:09:37] cause if we keep driving down that road
[1:09:44] because the world comes to change our
[1:09:46] behavior because we are leaving this
[1:09:51] place and the rapture so the external
[1:09:53] thing is an internal thing the wrapped
[1:09:58] is on our outside in thing is an inside
[1:10:00] out thing you have to be walking around
[1:10:01] with the rapture where's the rapture is
[1:10:05] inside of me just waiting for the time
[1:10:07] waiting for the time for kotas already
[1:10:09] come and all of a sudden the power
[1:10:11] that's working in you transforms itself
[1:10:15] can the church say men everybody feeling
[1:10:19] fine
[1:10:20] now from the message Jehovah Jireh but
[1:10:25] the band said and no that's the way that
[1:10:27] Christianity is and I want you to get
[1:10:28] this when a man is or a woman or a child
[1:10:31] is born of the Spirit of God listen
[1:10:35] carefully and this is what we're talking
[1:10:37] about now born of the Spirit of God then
[1:10:40] everything you have made off in this
[1:10:42] world
[1:10:43] listen and the world to come is given to
[1:10:46] you when you receive the Holy Spirit you
[1:10:50] see how important this thing is that I'm
[1:10:51] talking about let me read this one more
[1:10:52] time young people listen carefully now
[1:10:54] that's the way that Christianity is when
[1:10:57] a man is or a woman or a child is born
[1:11:00] of the Spirit of God then everything you
[1:11:03] have need of in this world and the world
[1:11:05] to come is given to you when you receive
[1:11:08] the Holy Spirit and you are planted in
[1:11:11] Christ and to my estimation of Christ or
[1:11:14] the Prophet is trying to create an
[1:11:17] estimation of Christ he said he is the
[1:11:19] inexhaustible function of life when you
[1:11:23] start to drink from this function in
[1:11:24] Orono an exhaustible inexhaustible mean
[1:11:28] there's no limit there's no enliven you
[1:11:31] can outdrink it you can the drink is you
[1:11:33] will hold up all of your drinking too
[1:11:34] much that will happen
[1:11:35] he's inexhaustible and you just are
[1:11:38] planted in him and drink and drink and
[1:11:41] push out and drink and push out and
[1:11:44] drink and push out everything you have
[1:11:47] need of is in him the only thing you
[1:11:50] have to do is get thirsty and go to
[1:11:53] drink him and it'll produce yet exactly
[1:11:56] what the seed is and if it's a promise
[1:11:59] God promised to do it God's obligated to
[1:12:02] do it and he will do it and the church
[1:12:05] say man I hope this thing's in the
[1:12:08] somebody this morning and the Prophet
[1:12:11] goes on he said pushing shoving
[1:12:13] something comes in as we move in a
[1:12:15] tabernacle this morning that means
[1:12:17] spring ever heard of the mainspring that
[1:12:19] means spring in the middle of the watch
[1:12:22] that makes every movement click the
[1:12:24] perfect timing now he's talking about
[1:12:26] not easy to tell not the iWatch and
[1:12:29] these digital watches these watches is
[1:12:32] to make us forget about the mainspring
[1:12:37] where there are so may you all time
[1:12:39] watches with the mean spring it is
[1:12:40] moving everything connection these
[1:12:43] desert watches young people Kevin
[1:12:45] reference it means for anymore
[1:12:47] but those watches it's a way you connect
[1:12:50] the next wheel on a spring and Ito buddy
[1:12:52] mainspring in the middle of the watch
[1:12:54] that makes every
[1:12:56] movement click the perfect aim now if
[1:12:58] all he pieces of the watch the end
[1:13:00] something wrong with him in spring then
[1:13:03] you watch wouldn't click to the perfect
[1:13:04] time so the profit goes on and when the
[1:13:08] Holy Spirit comes in there's something
[1:13:10] that moves and listen him you can't
[1:13:13] understand what it is it's a
[1:13:16] supernatural being inside you moving
[1:13:19] controlling your emotions making you
[1:13:22] scream when actually you feel like
[1:13:25] running but you will shout when you
[1:13:27] don't know what you're doing you just
[1:13:29] praise God automatically then something
[1:13:32] happens it's that mean spring the spring
[1:13:35] of God's grace in the middle of your
[1:13:37] heart controlling you making you shun
[1:13:41] from evil
[1:13:42] accept life get away from tote have me
[1:13:46] that means spring can we talk about the
[1:13:48] mean spring this morning that means
[1:13:55] spring will make you cast down reasoning
[1:13:59] it'll make you stop trying to figure
[1:14:01] things out and accept courts would it's
[1:14:04] a moving ticking going around and around
[1:14:07] and making your whole emotions come
[1:14:10] right in a control with God what a
[1:14:12] marvelous thing but if Adam goes on the
[1:14:15] Holy Spirit brooding over you as he did
[1:14:17] a bleak at one time and the fruits come
[1:14:20] up out of the bleak and when the Holy
[1:14:23] Spirit drove together the calcium and
[1:14:25] port ash and moisture and whatever
[1:14:27] texture it taken to make flowers and
[1:14:29] fruits and peace and animals and mankind
[1:14:32] the Holy Spirit brooding in connection
[1:14:34] with God and these things come to pass
[1:14:36] what more will he do over a born-again
[1:14:39] man now for his health or whatever he
[1:14:42] has need of of God's eternal prophets
[1:14:45] and of course eternal promised and the
[1:14:47] church say Amen from the message
[1:14:51] impersonation of Christianity but I said
[1:14:54] God's new heart that he put in you
[1:14:55] that's right in the center of you
[1:14:58] that's your impulse where your emotions
[1:15:01] goes out and the new spirit says right
[1:15:03] in the son
[1:15:04] of the newhart see them on a new heart a
[1:15:06] new spirit and quartz spirit the holy
[1:15:09] spirit
[1:15:10] sets right in the center of your new
[1:15:12] spirit and peer it controls your
[1:15:14] emotions it's just like the mean spring
[1:15:17] in a famous watch and it's self-winding
[1:15:21] you don't have to wind it every day God
[1:15:24] won't it once and for all and it's set
[1:15:27] right in the middle of your life of your
[1:15:29] new life
[1:15:30] and as the mean spring as it relieves
[1:15:33] and takes away the watch it controls
[1:15:35] every little organism of that watch the
[1:15:37] perfect time and when the Holy Spirit
[1:15:40] can the church the Holy Spirit when the
[1:15:42] Holy Spirit not the new degree not the
[1:15:45] new church this is a prophet hey man
[1:15:54] when the Holy Spirit not the new decree
[1:15:56] not the new church not the new thought
[1:15:58] not the new emotion not the new oil not
[1:16:02] the new dance not the new lips not the
[1:16:05] new tongue not the new this not the new
[1:16:07] that but when God places his spirit in
[1:16:10] the middle of your new spirit then you
[1:16:13] don't have to act meek you don't have to
[1:16:16] act like a Christian it controls
[1:16:18] everything that's within you it puts you
[1:16:21] decent
[1:16:22] makes a church act orderly makes the
[1:16:25] gifts work perfectly if you have to be
[1:16:28] taken from a place where you think you
[1:16:30] should be and put down something else it
[1:16:32] controls you can the church say man what
[1:16:38] are we talking about whereas if we're
[1:16:39] talking about the Holy Ghost not
[1:16:41] swapping I'll never come back again no
[1:16:43] sir that shows that the mainspring is
[1:16:46] not in there when you blow up at every
[1:16:48] little thing that happens poisons that
[1:16:52] disposition and when the pastor happens
[1:16:55] to hit something that in the wood and
[1:16:57] you say well I don't believe that
[1:17:00] watch out the mainspring hasn't been set
[1:17:03] in there right so when you fly off the
[1:17:06] handle and they get all upset and get
[1:17:09] all emotional on you you you can't even
[1:17:11] take correction what does it mean the
[1:17:13] mainspring has immense
[1:17:14] that's right but when the mean spring is
[1:17:16] set right when the Holy Ghost is in the
[1:17:19] control tower off your heart then you
[1:17:22] don't fly off the handle it controls it
[1:17:24] makes you believe so the Holy Ghost will
[1:17:27] make you believe it makes you act in
[1:17:29] such a way till you become salty the
[1:17:32] whole world turns to be like you can the
[1:17:34] church say man that's the Holy Spirit
[1:17:37] sitting in the middle of your spirit
[1:17:40] it's the mean spring oh I just hate to
[1:17:49] go to church tonight and that preacher
[1:17:51] if he wasn't so long-winded I'd like to
[1:17:54] hear him a few minutes but I tell you
[1:17:56] what the last time I went when I went
[1:17:58] down to the car party Susie said to me
[1:18:00] do you mean to tell me the very audacity
[1:18:03] that you belittle yourself to take your
[1:18:05] hair down you mean to tell me that
[1:18:07] you're not going to wear those shorts
[1:18:08] anymore well you see the thing of it is
[1:18:10] if you've just got a new spirit it'll
[1:18:13] just kill you that's right
[1:18:14] but when you got his spirit it makes
[1:18:16] every emotion tick just write to the
[1:18:19] word of God
[1:18:20] it'll tick right with the word you see
[1:18:22] well no Susie just a moment the Bible
[1:18:24] said it's an abomination before him to
[1:18:26] do that and the love of Christ has come
[1:18:28] into my heart and I love him too much to
[1:18:30] do it see I love him that's what the
[1:18:33] mainspring does it makes you love him it
[1:18:35] makes you serve him it makes you worship
[1:18:38] Him it makes you act different and if
[1:18:42] you don't have that mean spring we ought
[1:18:43] to be desperate to get that mean spring
[1:18:46] if you don't have the Holy Ghost we
[1:18:48] ought to be desperate to get the Holy
[1:18:50] Ghost because once the Holy Ghost is
[1:18:52] operating in you it's a new Walker it's
[1:18:54] a new talker it's a new life it's a new
[1:18:57] way it's a new kind of church semen
[1:19:00] [Applause]
[1:19:02] hallelujah
[1:19:03] let's sit be the name of the Lord
[1:19:06] hallelujah are we gonna see on that
[1:19:09] until that comes to pass because there
[1:19:12] are too many people who are coming to
[1:19:13] church because they want to be better
[1:19:15] but that's not what this is talking
[1:19:16] about we're not trying to be better
[1:19:18] we're trying to be the way God wants us
[1:19:21] to be because our understanding of
[1:19:23] better doesn't have to line up with
[1:19:25] God's expectation of us can
[1:19:27] chatzi mm we want to meet God standard
[1:19:29] not our standard we don't want the
[1:19:31] improvement we want perfection we don't
[1:19:34] want to be better we want perfection we
[1:19:37] want adoption we want to see in science
[1:19:39] not let a piece of a Sam you want the
[1:19:41] same wonders we want the same spirit we
[1:19:44] want to stand there God set for holiness
[1:19:46] the standard is set for righteousness
[1:19:49] the standard is set for how Christians
[1:19:51] are supposed to be not conformed to this
[1:19:54] world but the fire of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:57] taking a permanent residence in our
[1:20:00] souls controlling our movements of you
[1:20:03] driving down the road and something
[1:20:05] tells you no you can't go there you are
[1:20:07] both to tell somebody something that's
[1:20:09] how I see don't see nothing what is it
[1:20:11] it's a Holy Ghost it's controlling you
[1:20:13] you are being controlled by a high
[1:20:16] opinion let's sit be the name of the
[1:20:24] Lord hallelujah hallelujah Oh blessed be
[1:20:32] the name of the Lord glory glory glory
[1:20:35] glory hallelujah hallelujah oh we are
[1:20:39] going somewhere we are going somewhere
[1:20:42] your flesh is in trouble this morning
[1:20:44] your spirit is in trouble and sworn in
[1:20:47] because when the word comes like this it
[1:20:49] goes into violation of what your body
[1:20:51] wants and what your spirit one's and
[1:20:53] what your memory tells you and your own
[1:20:55] reasoning of what things are supposed to
[1:20:57] be like God is speaking the receipt in
[1:21:00] your soul for the ceiling of so to begin
[1:21:02] to grow and to take control of
[1:21:04] everything around you take control of
[1:21:06] your heart your mind your body
[1:21:09] everything kinda church amen
[1:21:11] Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:21:19] can the church cement hallelujah
[1:21:22] hallelujah
[1:21:23] lujah oh I'm waiting on something right
[1:21:26] now I'm waiting on something right now
[1:21:28] Oh blessed be the name of the Lord God
[1:21:31] did not want the Holy Ghost to fall on
[1:21:33] your flesh he didn't wonder what he goes
[1:21:35] to fall on your ideas he didn't want the
[1:21:37] Holy Ghost to fall on your emotions he
[1:21:39] didn't want the Holy Ghost to fall so
[1:21:43] the Prophet had to come to bring the
[1:21:44] word hallelujah so the Prophet had to
[1:21:54] come to bring the wood so that the wood
[1:22:00] will change you and the word would
[1:22:03] prepare you and the wood would instruct
[1:22:05] you on what your expectation is supposed
[1:22:08] to be and the wood will be your anchor
[1:22:10] point the world would be your a point of
[1:22:13] understanding of what you are supposed
[1:22:15] to live up to so when the Spirit comes
[1:22:17] you will know how to recognize it
[1:22:19] because when the rain falls it brings up
[1:22:21] every seed it brings up every spirit but
[1:22:24] the way to discern if the spirit is
[1:22:26] moving in the right way is like I'm here
[1:22:28] with a winner
[1:22:29] that's why the word has to be spoken a
[1:22:31] certain way the wood has to be presented
[1:22:34] a certain way the word has to be focused
[1:22:36] a certain way so that when you see the
[1:22:38] movement of the Spirit you can see that
[1:22:40] is it this is that which was spoken by
[1:22:43] the Prophet Malachi for not a work up
[1:22:46] that I eat borscht and not a mystery not
[1:22:48] something that you have to try to figure
[1:22:50] it out but it will speak for itself and
[1:22:54] the church shame and without that we are
[1:22:56] like any other Pentecostal church
[1:22:58] without - be like any other Church up
[1:23:00] but when it's line upon line precept
[1:23:03] upon precept God has always water the
[1:23:06] spirit up on the
[1:23:08] instructions of the word not under way
[1:23:10] you wanted
[1:23:11] he told him Terry in the city of

[1:23:36] the church and all these years god this
[1:23:47] guy's the Holy Ghost as the word deceive

[1:23:51] Pentecostal had signs and wonders and
[1:23:53] they couldn't handle it of the Pentecost
[1:23:55] had spirit and they couldn't handle it
[1:23:57] up because the Spirit is so powerful but
[1:24:00] God wants support power on character God
[1:24:04] won support power and sons and daughters
[1:24:06] whose DNA have been changed of the
[1:24:09] appetite has been changed
[1:24:11] no more luster no more sonication no
[1:24:15] more lying no more evil surmising no

[1:28:10] one man one Accord I'm trying to see one
[1:28:12] expectation the Prophet self if we could
[1:28:14] get in one minor one Accord he said in
[1:28:17] five minutes
[1:28:18] there'd be not a feeble person in the
[1:28:20] building all it takes is five minutes
[1:28:23] I'm looking for a five minute service a
[1:28:25] five minute service but to get that five
[1:28:29] minute service we need to be in one mind
[1:28:31] of one Accord we need to have one
[1:28:34] expectation we need to know it's one
[1:28:36] Lord it's one pitch it's one baptism
[1:28:39] it's one Holy Ghost it's one mock of
[1:28:43] adoption it's one token it's one
[1:28:45] absolute it's one spirit it's one party
[1:28:49] by one spirit we are baptized into the
[1:28:52] body your sickness is defeated today
[1:28:55] because you are part of the body and you
[1:28:58] kind of make a rapture in your sick
[1:29:00] condition that's why we're the Branham
[1:29:02] said how can you have peace for the
[1:29:04] rapture if you can't even ask for divine
[1:29:06] healing
[1:29:08] you must be healed you have to be healed
[1:29:12] the devil cannot stop it your healing is
[1:29:15] on its way it's already paid for it's
[1:29:18] already sent from heaven it's on its
[1:29:20] wave your deliverance on its wave your
[1:29:23] family be restored on its sweep
[1:29:26] hallelujah and no devil can stop it no

[1:29:33] coming to pass not many days hence let
[1:29:37] me prophesy you will see your children
[1:29:39] restoring the house of God not many days
[1:29:42] hence up you will see the pins in your
[1:29:44] body disappear not many days hence how
[1:29:48] could you say that because the testimony
[1:29:50] of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy and
[1:29:53] we are commissioned we are commanded to
[1:29:56] prophesy again after we take the book
[1:29:59] and eat the book and we are speaking
[1:30:01] from the book this morning we are
[1:30:03] speaking from the hidden manna under the
[1:30:06] seventh seal this morning we are
[1:30:08] speaking because we know who we are what
[1:30:11] we are called to do what we are called
[1:30:13] to achieve what's about to happen and
[1:30:17] the devil could do nothing about it
[1:30:19] but I say I don't have no money forget
[1:30:22] about it he could provide your financing
[1:30:24] but Isaac you know what's happening in
[1:30:26] my marriage forget about it he is the
[1:30:28] first one instituted marriage he can fix
[1:30:32] it around it's not your job to fix it
[1:30:34] trust him he'll fix it he'll change
[1:30:37] things around because that's what he
[1:30:39] does
[1:30:40] allow God to do what he does allow God
[1:30:43] to be a healer allow God to be a great
[1:30:46] position
[1:30:49] [Applause]
[1:30:55] [Music]
[1:30:57] [Applause]

[1:31:09] spirit comes together Healing actually
[1:31:11] happens people were healed while the
[1:31:14] preaching is going on people were healed
[1:31:16] because they caught feet you don't even
[1:31:18] need lead to be laid hands on this
[1:31:20] morning because the wood is going forth
[1:31:22] wood and spirit together you can answer
[1:31:24] each other and grab it and say Lord I'm
[1:31:26] ready I'm tired of this condition you
[1:31:28] promise you'll heal me I'm gonna clean

[1:31:55] [Applause]
[1:31:55] [Music]
[1:31:58] hallelujah
[1:32:01] it's an uphill battle that in our human
[1:32:05] strain we cannot win it's an uphill
[1:32:11] battle friends that in your human
[1:32:13] strength you cannot win our track record
[1:32:25] will always be failure our track record
[1:32:33] will have the only thing that could
[1:32:36] change from failure to success event go
[1:32:38] exception and he starts to drive the car
[1:32:40] of your life and you tired of trying
[1:32:44] things you're weak and you tried of your
[1:32:47] approach and you try to be here today
[1:32:49] had any wall and teasin work only waited
[1:32:52] and you have been doing you have been
[1:32:54] doing it and chorus in the battle is not
[1:32:56] yours it's my battle listen is not you
[1:33:00] listen you may be seated
[1:33:01] listen it's not you have this score to
[1:33:04] settle on oh is that your score to
[1:33:09] settle is good score to settle
[1:33:13] we happen to be the instruments that he
[1:33:17] will use to settle his score the devil
[1:33:21] rose up with war in heaven and he war
[1:33:24] became the war of men not it was nothing
[1:33:27] to do with us but we were represented
[1:33:30] there in the battle when Michael thought
[1:33:34] we were represented there and because
[1:33:36] you overcame their God chose us for this
[1:33:39] age because we had experience of
[1:33:42] fighting alongside Michael we were there
[1:33:46] represented but God wiped your memory
[1:33:50] because when a Terran spoke in a couple
[1:33:52] of weeks ago because God wants of good
[1:33:55] battle you want a good fight you don't
[1:33:59] want no opponent that losing up front so
[1:34:02] you want to get it ever a play a game
[1:34:05] he wiped your memory that you could
[1:34:07] remember so Angela's in his condition
[1:34:09] God unlocked his memory and said job let
[1:34:13] me remind you where was though when I
[1:34:15] lay the foundation of the earth and the
[1:34:18] morning stop oh you were there and when
[1:34:20] you remember he got a confidence he felt
[1:34:24] different he said I know my redeemer
[1:34:26] Levitt brother Branham preached it
[1:34:30] spiritual amnesia and the spiritual
[1:34:33] amnesia is what has you sick in your
[1:34:35] body you don't even remember that test
[1:34:38] body is temporary and your theophany oh
[1:34:41] come on somebody help me please
[1:34:43] this warning but me the word come down
[1:34:46] upon you black white spirit to remind
[1:34:49] you you are just like your father
[1:34:54] [Music]
[1:34:57] poor halleluja halleluja
[1:35:01] he may be seated
[1:35:03] [Applause]
[1:35:11] [Music]
[1:35:14] you may be seen in where the random
[1:35:17] taught us the devil is jealous of you
[1:35:19] because he could never access this
[1:35:21] inheritance because for him to access
[1:35:25] inheritance he has to come under the
[1:35:27] blood and if he come under the blood
[1:35:29] he'll be your brother but because he had
[1:35:31] come under the blood he could oh god
[1:35:34] somebody help me this morning he cannot
[1:35:36] come under the blood because underneath
[1:35:39] the blood the devil do you no harm
[1:35:41] so you are here to prove that call to
[1:35:43] take away everything from you and you
[1:35:45] still span not on your own knowledge but
[1:35:48] on your representation by predestination
[1:35:52] [Applause]
[1:35:56] you may be seated in other words what
[1:35:58] are you saying preacher you are winner
[1:36:00] before you even born before you took up
[1:36:05] residence on the earth you are winner if
[1:36:12] we can remind rewind you may be sitting
[1:36:14] for a minute
[1:36:14] rewind back to that war when Michael
[1:36:18] threw his sword returns and there was
[1:36:21] some sons of God represented with him
[1:36:22] but a Terrence I was there you were
[1:36:26] there oh listen we were the ones who
[1:36:29] take the devil out you know so the devil
[1:36:31] knows who you are he knows who I am and
[1:36:36] his job is to keep us from reconnecting
[1:36:40] to who we I am God because the devil
[1:36:42] knows that if this Holy Ghost thing
[1:36:44] because the Holy Ghost is the connector
[1:36:47] the Holy Ghost is God in spirit it's
[1:36:49] caught in his sons it's caught in power
[1:36:53] [Applause]
[1:37:00] you may be seated
[1:37:03] [Applause]
[1:37:04] [Music]
[1:37:05] [Applause]
[1:37:12] you may be seen it for a minute but
[1:37:14] feels good in here
[1:37:15] feel somebody catching something but a
[1:37:17] random cell and the Bible says it
[1:37:19] everything that we see today the things
[1:37:24] that appear are meeting the things that
[1:37:26] did not what we see is made from things
[1:37:29] that did not exist you ever seen it for
[1:37:32] a minute and then he said everything
[1:37:34] that's on the earth know all your raw
[1:37:35] materials was here all along
[1:37:38] so when Adam was on the earth the raw
[1:37:42] materials were here to make the airplane
[1:37:43] it says that Adam didn't know how to
[1:37:47] make a airplane and in fact when Adam
[1:37:49] was in his position he didn't need a
[1:37:51] airplane because as a son in position he
[1:37:54] could just move from wherever he wanted
[1:37:56] to he had to go but it doesn't deny the
[1:37:59] fact that the raw materials were here
[1:38:01] all along you receive for a minute so
[1:38:07] God who could think levels above us can
[1:38:10] we talk about Gore for a little bit
[1:38:11] buckle your seatbelts and go here for a
[1:38:14] ride this morning God is a scientist can
[1:38:23] we trouble go to scientist early doctors
[1:38:27] to this deal no trying to understand
[1:38:30] basic biology after call it basic
[1:38:34] because it kind of reached cause
[1:38:35] understanding how Gore cat-friendly
[1:38:37] right cells to put together and the way
[1:38:40] birth takes place on the way there your
[1:38:42] body heals itself anyway that when you
[1:38:45] have a fever the fever is your body's
[1:38:46] defense mechanism God built in a defense
[1:38:49] mechanism to raise your temperature
[1:38:51] because certain certain viruses or
[1:38:53] bacteria cannot exist a certain
[1:38:55] temperature God in designing man sat
[1:38:58] down and mapped out all this biology all
[1:39:01] the chemistry for how your brain would
[1:39:03] work because it's electronic different
[1:39:05] synapses that transfer your brain to
[1:39:08] move and calculate and that's electric
[1:39:11] so girls an electrical engineer he's a
[1:39:13] biological engineer he's a chemical
[1:39:15] engineer he's an architect if the earth
[1:39:19] tell too much the water were melty I
[1:39:22] capsule meant so quad nose can we
[1:39:26] preserve it before the flood but a brand
[1:39:30] said the earth was in its stable
[1:39:31] condition but when the flood came caught
[1:39:33] tilted on the axis just a little bit he
[1:39:35] knew exactly how much until today
[1:39:37] oh come on somebody help me he's uh he's
[1:39:39] uh he's ah he's architect he knows how
[1:39:42] to design he's a mechanical engineer
[1:39:45] when they wanted to get from Egypt to
[1:39:47] the promised land
[1:39:48] he's the only man he's the only God
[1:39:50] could open the Red Sea they still don't
[1:39:52] know how to open up I see somebody
[1:39:59] bleeds back to me you may be seated
[1:40:02] [Applause]
[1:40:04] this God were talking about this
[1:40:07] scientist was able to take a man that
[1:40:09] looked just like you and me because he
[1:40:11] was not big man he was a looking
[1:40:13] majestic tattoo on me named Samson and
[1:40:15] with the same bone structure the same
[1:40:18] muscle structure in fact where the
[1:40:19] Branum she didn't look strong he look
[1:40:22] like a but Korra's able to finally
[1:40:25] use that same body that same mechanics
[1:40:28] that same height that seems to Anne's
[1:40:30] Five Fingers five fingers and make that
[1:40:34] man so strong he can lift up a gate or
[1:40:36] somebody please back to me you may be
[1:40:41] seated
[1:40:43] can I talk about his resume listen for a
[1:40:47] minute
[1:40:49] [Applause]
[1:40:53] [Music]
[1:40:54] [Applause]
[1:41:03] [Applause]
[1:41:16] Alijah without a whole egos tapped into
[1:41:21] the science and I babble say he may be
[1:41:25] axe flute because he tapped into the
[1:41:28] intelligence I know a better man I'm
[1:41:31] taught us there's no moving faculty
[1:41:32] after the eyes it's just the
[1:41:33] intelligence so this bride and I'm
[1:41:36] getting something now because but over
[1:41:38] the last weeks at the touches I called
[1:41:40] spiritual scientist and I'm sure better
[1:41:42] at in my notes I have some notes and
[1:41:43] spiritual scientists Muhammad said
[1:41:45] Luthor was a scientist he went to the
[1:41:48] wood and he found what was needed for
[1:41:50] that oh it was here all along you know
[1:41:51] it was a new things he thought it was
[1:41:53] day all along but as a spiritual
[1:41:55] scientist said it a mix of ingredients
[1:41:57] together mechanics and dynamics and when
[1:42:00] McKenna then is a reaction I'm an Wesley
[1:42:07] Kim he is a scientist went to look for
[1:42:09] all your raw materials and they say in a
[1:42:11] chemistry lab if you ever would a lab
[1:42:13] when your mix chemicals he's had to add
[1:42:14] another element most time is fire your
[1:42:18] mixer men together and we put it any
[1:42:21] ponds in Berlin are your presence in
[1:42:22] Romania to put a external element I was
[1:42:25] a little lighter on fire and many things
[1:42:27] begin a bubble and mix and create what
[1:42:29] it's supposed to be so this word is
[1:42:34] mechanics and true this mess another
[1:42:37] prophet we have all the mechanics
[1:42:40] because s ratcheting is a listen but if
[1:42:44] I said this you know long dr. tscheiner
[1:42:46] stop cancer but he said this purchase
[1:42:49] and
[1:42:51] this bread will stop cancer in this
[1:42:55] bride is a formula to stop diseases it's
[1:42:58] here but it takes to the right people to
[1:43:00] mix it together and then fire with a
[1:43:08] Branham Center rapture and faith is
[1:43:10] laying in a message it's already here
[1:43:13] you know in other people looking for the
[1:43:15] formality formula is here but God is
[1:43:17] waiting for some scientist to say okay
[1:43:19] we need to take this and but if I said
[1:43:21] one of you right word will be spoken and
[1:43:24] will - into the presence so it's here
[1:43:28] already so what are you worried about
[1:43:30] what are you stressing about what are
[1:43:33] you letting your emotions getting away
[1:43:35] about can the church same and everybody
[1:43:39] feeling fine
[1:43:42] [Applause]
[1:43:54] [Music]
[1:43:56] so the full word has to be in us as see
[1:44:06] so that when the spirit comes it could
[1:44:09] bring up what's inside of the CD that's
[1:44:14] why the prophet could say the secret is
[1:44:16] the wood is in the pride not the word is
[1:44:22] in the church the word is in the bride
[1:44:24] and how do you know bride how do you
[1:44:27] know she is bride she could take the
[1:44:30] wood I went the wood is in the bright
[1:44:35] and your womb is sealed it means that
[1:44:37] anything that is not Christ you
[1:44:39] recognize listen you can't let you go
[1:44:45] when you have a genuine experience with
[1:44:47] God you guide you but a brand said when
[1:44:53] you have that experience that all you
[1:44:55] need with this wool and it would to come
[1:44:57] already tell you he will guide you into
[1:45:00] all truth
[1:45:00] that's the comforter all the way from
[1:45:03] fear to charity we go better Baron said
[1:45:05] after you receive the Holy Ghost you
[1:45:07] make yourself a Christian that is the
[1:45:10] process of climbing would feed virtue
[1:45:12] knowledge temperance patient goal it but
[1:45:13] it can charity and when you up chatting
[1:45:15] you seal with love know you reach a
[1:45:18] stature that you are now looking like
[1:45:20] the formula to make it because there's
[1:45:22] being when completed is the being that
[1:45:25] appear there hallelujah hallelujah
[1:45:36] hallelujah
[1:45:40] so I'm contending this morning for us to
[1:45:44] come back on speaking terms with God
[1:45:49] back into a relationship with God a
[1:45:52] genuine relationship with God not a
[1:45:56] sometimes relationship but a
[1:45:58] relationship with God that he
[1:46:00] every decision that you actually think
[1:46:04] before you act
[1:46:05] what will God want and you will find
[1:46:09] many such a do that everything around
[1:46:12] you begins to change because if he
[1:46:14] walking in his will and when you
[1:46:16] embodied in that walk and in your
[1:46:18] calling and in his will then the only
[1:46:20] thing that could come your way it's what
[1:46:22] God allows to come here whether you can
[1:46:23] handle outside of that you are creating
[1:46:25] your own problems and it's right below
[1:46:28] it always said we are yet to be led by
[1:46:31] the spirit into the wilderness to be
[1:46:33] tested how we test you and as you create
[1:46:36] your test you create your trial you
[1:46:38] create about you look and you walk into
[1:46:40] trouble and it's a malgor take mountain
[1:46:42] you see by never leave you there because
[1:46:47] I give you grace to do what I lead you
[1:46:48] into but now you find yourself in their
[1:46:51] mother Branham said if you ever find
[1:46:53] yourself away from gold retreat systems
[1:46:56] and go right back to where you left them
[1:46:59] because he be right here because it but
[1:47:01] everyone said God never leaves us
[1:47:03] he said we walk away from God and if you
[1:47:06] ever want to get back into fellowship
[1:47:08] with God go right back to where you left
[1:47:11] him come to church say Amen or
[1:47:15] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:47:19] Oh hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:47:23] Lord everybody feelin fine in the end
[1:47:37] time sign see but ever I said Jesus said
[1:47:39] the scriptures has to be fulfilled every
[1:47:42] word has to come to pass today we have
[1:47:44] gotten so far away from it we have just
[1:47:46] mixed ourselves up with creed and so
[1:47:49] forth until we have just gone out on a
[1:47:51] wild tantrum just as the Bible said we
[1:47:54] would do but in but he goes on but in
[1:47:57] the face of all that there's a real
[1:47:59] bride that God's bringing forth each
[1:48:02] time has been a Reformation has been so
[1:48:04] much for the word spread forth and each
[1:48:06] generation gets his time did he notice
[1:48:08] there'll be a manor come along and it'll
[1:48:10] strike the fire with God and there'll be
[1:48:12] a great revival that shook the land but
[1:48:14] what happens immediately after that they
[1:48:17] take out man's idea and it nominated and
[1:48:20] bring in Crete and mixes and she dies
[1:48:22] and never rises again but in the face of
[1:48:25] all that there's a real pride that God
[1:48:28] is bringing forth and we are going back
[1:48:31] to the Bible to produce a wood bride
[1:48:34] because I'll never be a bride like this
[1:48:37] bride there has never been and they will
[1:48:39] never be because it's the last bride
[1:48:41] what's about to happen has never
[1:48:43] happened before and will not happen
[1:48:45] again in the black part of God's mind
[1:48:48] it's the final showdown the final point
[1:48:51] that God has been waiting on from a
[1:48:57] message either was it Moses so I'll be
[1:48:59] with thee and that's a trouble today we
[1:49:00] tried to get ahead of the wood and
[1:49:02] bypass and make the wood to fit this the
[1:49:05] wood to fit that God bless your hearts
[1:49:08] what we need to do is follow the wood
[1:49:10] what we need to do is get rid of a lot
[1:49:14] of our fancy fandango's and get back to
[1:49:18] the Bible and back to the old-fashioned
[1:49:21] Holy Ghost and back to a place where man
[1:49:24] and woman look and act and walk like
[1:49:26] Christians you might think I'm a little
[1:49:28] excited I'm just a little crazy but I
[1:49:30] tell you I love
[1:49:31] to be this way what we need today
[1:49:33] ministers what we need today brothers
[1:49:35] and sisters is this one thing the devil
[1:49:38] has got into our church and got us all
[1:49:40] formal indifferent what he needs are
[1:49:42] calling back what mean these are all
[1:49:44] fashion gathering together again the
[1:49:47] sounding of the jubilee the pouring
[1:49:49] forth of the Holy Ghost the all coming
[1:49:52] of the Spirit sure there's cause to come
[1:49:54] back to the prayer meeting it's true we
[1:50:00] have just begin to fashion off just like
[1:50:02] the world do just the same things the
[1:50:05] world does and how it happens a lot of
[1:50:08] Hollywood evangelism and a lot of
[1:50:09] television staying home at night
[1:50:11] watching television instead of going to
[1:50:13] prayer meeting watching who loves Lucy
[1:50:17] and all I kind of stop and stay away
[1:50:19] from the Word of God and away from the
[1:50:21] church and I tell you brother that's the
[1:50:24] reason you know that's the truth god
[1:50:26] help us today to come back to the old
[1:50:29] fashioned Pentecostal experience of the
[1:50:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost the Holy
[1:50:38] Spirit today but a parent said the
[1:50:40] manifestation of the Holy Spirit is that
[1:50:42] angel trying to get the people back to
[1:50:46] the word because the holy sprit alone
[1:50:48] leaf indicator would that's my
[1:50:53] expectation
[1:50:53] that's my hope I don't know what your
[1:50:55] desires this morning but I know they
[1:50:59] always lead I know that time is fast
[1:51:03] spent and I know that judgment is
[1:51:05] hanging over here and I know chorus
[1:51:07] about to call all these people home to
[1:51:09] the rapture and I know that this economy
[1:51:12] cannot be fixed the crime situation
[1:51:14] cannot be fixed this world cannot be
[1:51:16] fixed there's no way out but up there's
[1:51:19] no solution that man can figure out some
[1:51:22] God has the same fire to purify this
[1:51:25] earth fire to purify lives lives who are
[1:51:29] willing to give up everything to make it
[1:51:31] in this green call a new heart a new
[1:51:34] spirit his spirit that's the only
[1:51:38] formula that God is looking for a noun a
[1:51:41] new
[1:51:42] heart a new spirit his spirit and the
[1:51:45] church semen Oh hallelujah Oh hallelujah
[1:51:52] Oh blessed be the name of the Lord so we
[1:51:56] want to create the right atmosphere in
[1:51:57] every service you wanna create a right
[1:51:59] atmosphere every day in our homes in our
[1:52:02] lives is here Lord I need a new heart if
[1:52:04] you have not even had a heart transplant
[1:52:06] then me you pray today for new heart
[1:52:09] tough and he said I've to get in new
[1:52:10] heart because he said it hard you have
[1:52:12] can't even live with your brother can
[1:52:14] live with his sister you know the things
[1:52:16] you like you don't like that's not God's
[1:52:17] heart he promised to give you a new
[1:52:19] heart I hided with tears after him a
[1:52:21] high that would love him I had it would
[1:52:23] seek him come on church speak he
[1:52:25] preached back to me Oh hallelujah
[1:52:28] hallelujah hallelujah Oh hallelujah a
[1:52:37] new heart and he puts a new spirit he
[1:52:41] says God has to give you a new spirit
[1:52:42] because you couldn't get along with him
[1:52:44] God has to put something between your
[1:52:46] heart and his spirit and as a new spirit
[1:52:49] to bring compatibility between God
[1:52:51] because his thoughts are higher than our
[1:52:53] thoughts he is holy and we are not by
[1:52:55] nature holy so something has to come to
[1:52:57] us to allow us to communicate on his
[1:52:59] level because he is righteous and our
[1:53:01] nature is unrighteous we are born in sin
[1:53:04] sheep in iniquity our best efforts are
[1:53:07] abomination to God all the books you
[1:53:10] read all that you do is still filthy
[1:53:12] rags unto God but when the Holy Ghost
[1:53:14] steps in then you are perfectly
[1:53:16] compatible with him because he can say
[1:53:18] that spirit of my spirit flesh of my
[1:53:21] flesh bone of my bone
[1:53:24] [Applause]
[1:53:26] [Music]
[1:53:32] [Applause]
[1:53:33] let me just drop this in here you put a
[1:53:38] new spirit corn as they give you a new
[1:53:40] spirit or you couldn't even get along
[1:53:43] with him and that new spirit is not the
[1:53:48] Holy Spirit he said a new heart a new
[1:53:51] spirit and his spirit three different
[1:53:55] things there's no heart is to take away
[1:53:59] the stone he has and it comes to this
[1:54:02] world with you all need to or behavior
[1:54:05] and then he crossing your new spirit you
[1:54:10] can get along with yourselves he said
[1:54:11] with only news where you can get load
[1:54:12] yourself
[1:54:13] Yesi people can't live with a oneself
[1:54:17] people in the house by this self and a
[1:54:19] frustrated whoever who who has just know
[1:54:23] this just on your own self people having
[1:54:30] overcome same with all that stress on
[1:54:32] your own self you miss a man who gave
[1:54:34] action nobody so who talk to you
[1:54:36] nobody so why have ax whenever just
[1:54:40] telling myself that whole argument who
[1:54:48] will come visit with yourself the new
[1:54:52] spirit sorts on your own being with your
[1:54:54] own self
[1:54:59] you kinda know with yourself that all
[1:55:02] devil spurred you had in you
[1:55:04] that's not my words oh she's caught up
[1:55:09] with a new spirit in you so you can get
[1:55:11] along with his spirit I will put a new
[1:55:14] spirit in them remember what our team is
[1:55:17] this morning how he received the Holy
[1:55:18] Ghost since you believed it that people
[1:55:22] who believe and have no news personal
[1:55:27] and I believe him I didn't love the
[1:55:29] message but our being Christian is being
[1:55:36] christ-like in him I was saying somebody
[1:55:41] speaking recently but years ago in the
[1:55:43] message before people had wisdom the
[1:55:47] prophet said that only the only woman
[1:55:49] who had makeup was Jezebel any Bible you
[1:55:52] remember that I said Jezebel got fed to
[1:55:54] the dog she's dog meat he probably said
[1:55:57] that be car walk on the street driving
[1:56:00] on highway screaming dog meat people did
[1:56:03] that know you intend to win somebody to
[1:56:11] Christ like that and half of these
[1:56:16] people doing that not even anywhere near
[1:56:18] any message no because they had
[1:56:20] knowledge but no new hat no new spirit
[1:56:24] and they didn't have his spirit because
[1:56:27] his spirit knows how to get to somebody
[1:56:31] he went to the woman at the well and he
[1:56:34] said cocora husband he didn't have said
[1:56:36] a yes five money I have yet they said
[1:56:41] Coco her husband he knows about the
[1:56:42] probe and she was he one say well here's
[1:56:47] what I have no husband and then Jesus
[1:56:51] began a talk to her he said you speak
[1:56:53] your truth because you you had five
[1:56:56] honey one the Buddha is not yours and he
[1:56:57] tried to make her feel like Oh cause she
[1:56:59] said well I had a speaking to you are he
[1:57:01] biting he finished with her she feel
[1:57:04] good enough to run and tell people come
[1:57:07] see a man who tell me all about me and
[1:57:09] show me that I could find a way
[1:57:11] out of my mess she didn't leave a
[1:57:18] feeling so messed up she was a
[1:57:20] diagonally well and commit suicide and
[1:57:26] that process that Jean because
[1:57:29] everything in this world is a processing
[1:57:30] and our Christian walk God takes us
[1:57:34] through a journey you coming to the Lord
[1:57:36] and it you get to know and then and then
[1:57:38] you realize you're such a hit your full
[1:57:39] center child guru trial and then you're
[1:57:41] like good lord toward this Christian
[1:57:44] thing was changing my walk my talk my
[1:57:45] life and then now your hands a battle
[1:57:47] and bullets flying around your through
[1:57:50] your leg your clothes get shut because
[1:57:55] they entered a war didn't realize the
[1:57:56] way it was in a war listen when is any
[1:57:58] warrior was a no warrior because you was
[1:58:02] in friendly zone because the Arab and
[1:58:05] Bishop is it gonna see village so when
[1:58:08] you serve the devil you walking wrong
[1:58:09] normal normal normal it's like but the
[1:58:12] moment you such a display behaviors that
[1:58:15] look like you from above you have a
[1:58:18] bull's eye starter go on your head
[1:58:21] all of a sudden again speeding tickets
[1:58:24] well you shouldn't be spilling that's
[1:58:25] wrong example bad example but all of a
[1:58:32] sudden situation you have problems for
[1:58:35] flat tires on your way to church and
[1:58:40] ever choice what if it is
[1:58:44] but his situations that try to frustrate
[1:58:47] you because the enemy is also fighting
[1:58:50] but true this process God is doing
[1:58:53] something in your soul to bring you
[1:58:55] closer to him and to his plan to give
[1:58:58] you a new heart to give you a new spirit
[1:59:00] and to put his Holy Spirit inside of you
[1:59:03] can the church say Amen
[1:59:07] [Applause]
[1:59:09] but I said I'd listen to the Prophet
[1:59:11] again so he's got about a new spoon in
[1:59:12] you so you can get along with his spirit
[1:59:14] I was put a new spirit in them I would
[1:59:17] put my spoon in them he said he's giving
[1:59:19] you a news pert that's you don't get it
[1:59:21] confused with God's Spirit it's not it's
[1:59:25] your new spirit so you can get along
[1:59:28] with the Holy Spirit if he ever gives it
[1:59:32] to you because you in your condition
[1:59:36] never gets along you can't get along
[1:59:38] with your wife you can't is along with
[1:59:40] your husband can't even get along the
[1:59:41] neighbor how are you ever going to get
[1:59:44] along with God the prophets would so you
[1:59:48] have to give you a new spirit so you can
[1:59:51] get along with him so he puts a new
[1:59:53] spirit in you then he puts his spirit in
[1:59:56] you gives you a new skirt a new outlook
[1:59:58] a new Fiat then he puts his Holy Spirit
[2:00:00] in you and the church glory so after the
[2:00:17] new heart after a new spirit now you can
[2:00:20] look forward for his spirit the baptism
[2:00:24] of the Holy Ghost
[2:00:27] brother Branham said in the future home
[2:00:30] to heavenly bridegroom and the bride if
[2:00:32] he ever healed a person he has to do it
[2:00:35] again when the same conditions is met he
[2:00:38] ever ever saved a man he's got to do it
[2:00:41] on the same grounds he did it the first
[2:00:43] time if he ever failed a man with the
[2:00:45] Holy Ghost listen now he's got to do it
[2:00:48] on the same grounds he did the first
[2:00:50] time if he ever raised a man up from the
[2:00:53] grave he's got to do it the second time
[2:00:55] and every other time on the same
[2:00:57] principle so what do you say brother I
[2:00:58] said once you meet the condition God is
[2:01:01] obligated to honor his word and he said
[2:01:04] full obedience and the entire Word of
[2:01:06] God entitles you that would entitle
[2:01:09] meanness no you're right it entitles you
[2:01:12] to the token it entitles you to the Holy
[2:01:15] Ghost so you have every
[2:01:16] the company Lord I'm coming for
[2:01:19] something that belongs to me because you
[2:01:20] told me when I fully OB the entire Word
[2:01:23] of God you will do something for me
[2:01:25] and that's the position you want to be
[2:01:28] as a church where we can lay down any
[2:01:30] altar cry and lead on say Lord we have
[2:01:33] done all that we can no it's up to you
[2:01:35] father what is the Holy Ghost given for
[2:01:43] the Holy Ghost comes to give you power
[2:01:45] the Holy Ghost comes to give you power
[2:01:47] in prayer we've read as many times you
[2:01:49] take a person has lived a good life but
[2:01:52] they always defeated oh I tell you I
[2:01:53] sure love the Lord brother Branham
[2:01:55] always defeated you never get a prayer
[2:01:57] answer you feel that little woman with
[2:01:59] the Holy Ghost one time watch what takes
[2:02:01] place when she calls before God she's
[2:02:03] not defeated she comes ball into the
[2:02:06] throne of God believing she has a right
[2:02:08] because she's a daughter of God by but
[2:02:11] take that little man so cowardly the
[2:02:13] boss kick him all over the place say
[2:02:15] wait a minute here now something chintzy
[2:02:17] he caught the Holy Ghost he gives you
[2:02:19] power in your life is full of power
[2:02:22] he gives you power in speech those
[2:02:25] people were afraid standing there Peter
[2:02:27] James John Luke and all the rest of them
[2:02:29] they done gone any upper room or we
[2:02:31] can't see no more there's dr. so-and-so
[2:02:33] and rabbis so and so he got four degrees
[2:02:36] Peter said I remember selling that man
[2:02:38] fish one day oh I could never stand them
[2:02:41] what time we do Brechin wait what we've
[2:02:44] been doing it for four days just keep on
[2:02:46] waiting
[2:02:46] how long until well did he see it would
[2:02:50] be in the fifty he never said how long
[2:02:52] he said until so they just kept waiting
[2:02:55] how long until it is pass until 90s
[2:02:59] that's a profit until and finally when
[2:03:02] the day of Pentecost had fully come they
[2:03:04] were all in one place in one Accord God
[2:03:07] had been above them in a fiery cloud go
[2:03:09] ahead walk with them alert now something
[2:03:12] else is going to take place something's
[2:03:14] fixin to happen they were all in one
[2:03:16] place in one Accord and suddenly there
[2:03:20] came a sound from heaven as
[2:03:22] rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all

[2:04:05] and they were worshiping and they were
[2:04:07] waiting and they were praying and they
[2:04:09] were worshiping didn't change doctrine
[2:04:12] they didn't change a message didn't

[2:07:14] were afraid they knew that what they had
[2:07:20] there was not enough to meet the

[2:08:34] and the west north understand what are
[2:08:37] we doing getting ready for that rapture
[2:08:40] the whole purpose of the Holy Ghost is
[2:08:42] to get us ready for that rap job getting
[2:08:44] ready for hauling ourselves steady for a
[2:08:47] few minutes till every fiber is filled
[2:08:50] with the Holy Ghost that's what a
[2:08:52] prophet is saying so God wants us to
[2:08:54] slow down a little bit and hold steady
[2:08:58] for a few minutes
[2:08:59] stop running all here and everywhere
[2:09:01] unsteady from human until every fiber

[2:09:53] Ghost marching with it that's what God
[2:09:56] gives the Holy Ghost for intellectuals
[2:09:59] will rise always half but God's got a
[2:10:02] minority somewhere friends I could spend
[2:10:05] time talking about all kind of different
[2:10:06] things all kind of nice information and
[2:10:09] you leave here he could he could have no
[2:10:11] I learn a lot and no I didn't know this
[2:10:13] critter was connected a scripture but if
[2:10:15] all of that hasn't turned into you
[2:10:17] haven't power in your life you wastin
[2:10:18] time
[2:10:20] there are many fine choices this morning
[2:10:22] into all kinds of different things I'm
[2:10:24] not against what they preach or what
[2:10:26] anybody goes into that's not the point
[2:10:28] but if the equal sign of all of this
[2:10:31] doesn't equal the holy goes in your soul
[2:10:34] Lewisohn time because the rapture only
[2:10:41] recognizes the token when the dead angel
[2:10:45] passes by is that when I see the blood
[2:10:48] how pass but a man I'm in the token II
[2:10:56] preacher angel and asking how long he
[2:10:59] been a Jew how long in the message what
[2:11:03] try we belong to what church should go
[2:11:05] to east looking for one thing he's not
[2:11:07] he's not even asking he's not talking to
[2:11:08] people he's just watching as a token
[2:11:10] there he doesn't need to have a
[2:11:13] conversation with you because you see
[2:11:15] the token implied on your house if you
[2:11:20] were to pass by this morning and this
[2:11:23] house would he see the token applied in
[2:11:27] your life have you received it since you
[2:11:30] believed it should make all of us look
[2:11:34] at ourselves this morning these are the
[2:11:37] kind of messages that are hard to preach
[2:11:39] that some preachers don't like the
[2:11:40] preacher people don't like to hear
[2:11:41] because it comes back to every man
[2:11:43] examining himself and your walk with God
[2:11:48] have you you have people to answer that
[2:11:50] question have you received the Holy
[2:11:52] Ghost since you believed and if they
[2:11:55] answer that a question is no then what
[2:11:57] are you doing about it
[2:11:59] are you getting desperate are you hungry
[2:12:02] I use thirsty because blessed are they
[2:12:05] that hunger and thirst after
[2:12:07] righteousness the Bible says for they
[2:12:09] are the ones that shall be filled it
[2:12:11] says nothing to do with a person next to
[2:12:13] you this has to do with you and God have
[2:12:15] you received a gift from God since you
[2:12:18] believe if you don't believe then at the
[2:12:20] end this question is not for you I'm
[2:12:22] talking for those who have believed you
[2:12:25] call yourself a believer have you
[2:12:30] received the gifts because he said
[2:12:32] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:12:34] Christ for the remission of sins and you
[2:12:35] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[2:12:37] so that promises on you upon baptism but
[2:12:41] what are you doing to see that promise
[2:12:44] come to life in your life promise come
[2:12:46] to reality in your life till this court
[2:12:49] be read there's something is a new being
[2:12:51] a spiritual being moving inside of your
[2:12:54] soul he wants to take control he wants
[2:12:57] to take leadership leadership over your
[2:13:01] life and when he leaves the life when he
[2:13:03] leaves your life the father's in here
[2:13:05] when the Holy Ghost is leading your life
[2:13:06] now he's leading your house because when
[2:13:10] he is controlling you know you could
[2:13:11] have proper control as a father of the
[2:13:13] house and when the mothers have the Holy
[2:13:15] Ghost now you can properly guide your
[2:13:17] children because you're not leading on
[2:13:19] your own understanding on your own
[2:13:20] ability but the Holy Ghost is directing
[2:13:23] you spiritual leadership that's a
[2:13:28] property we are depending on our own
[2:13:30] strength our own knowledge our own
[2:13:32] inspiration of our own ambitions of our
[2:13:35] own advice we are telling Sharon what we
[2:13:37] want to tell him we didn't even talk to
[2:13:39] God about it but when the Holy Ghost is
[2:13:41] dear it will lead you in how to speak to
[2:13:43] your children the Holy Ghost will have
[2:13:48] husbands speak to their wives the right
[2:13:50] way demonstrate love the right will have
[2:13:54] wives to reference it husbands the right
[2:13:56] way not how you were taught but how the
[2:13:59] Holy Ghost leads you to do it because he
[2:14:01] knows how to do it this is not legalism
[2:14:03] this is the Holy Ghost but but I
[2:14:05] problems and people afraid of it because
[2:14:07] disrupt away we do things it will
[2:14:10] disruptive to the tradition because we
[2:14:13] have all kind of plans where the holy
[2:14:14] ghost doesn't respect our path he is the
[2:14:16] Holy Ghost he is quad and spirit moving
[2:14:19] direct and changing things around in
[2:14:21] perfect order put the comedy brooding
[2:14:27] over your life brooding over the church
[2:14:29] as he brood over the earth in Genesis
[2:14:31] and created order out of chaos he wants
[2:14:34] to create order in your life out of the
[2:14:36] chaos in your life together Holy Ghost
[2:14:51] it must be total surrender total
[2:14:54] surrender complete surrender you have to
[2:14:57] let go of your emotions let go of your
[2:15:00] feelings let go of your desires and the
[2:15:02] other side become for wanting Lord I
[2:15:04] need you because he is spirit he was
[2:15:08] above them he walked with them now the
[2:15:10] whole gospel the whole mission was
[2:15:12] hidden for ages and generation is Christ
[2:15:15] in you the hope of glory it's not Christ
[2:15:17] in flesh in you is the spirit in you
[2:15:19] that's what this world gospel is above
[2:15:21] that's what the message is about to
[2:15:23] bring Jesus Christ on the scene again
[2:15:25] that's what it's all about
[2:15:28] [Applause]
[2:15:32] oh my my my my all of your struggles
[2:15:38] your struggling to do this and it's
[2:15:40] struggling to do that and it's
[2:15:42] struggling to live the life and it's
[2:15:44] struggling to make it may your struggle
[2:15:46] to the beat just to get the Holy Ghost
[2:15:48] because when you get the Holy Ghost the
[2:15:49] struggles become different Oh me labor
[2:15:52] this morning me you have the birth pains
[2:15:55] of the Holy Ghost
[2:15:56] it'll be a messy thing but that's what
[2:15:59] we need baptized a little body get the
[2:16:05] Holy Ghost and everything else fall into

[2:16:21] you get the Holy Ghost have you received
[2:16:26] the Holy Ghost since you believed shake
[2:16:36] your world this morning but I think I
[2:16:39] had experience how do you not know that
[2:16:41] was just your spirit your new spirit who
[2:16:44] you know you're still gossiping Cody
[2:16:45] hole he goes doesn't gossip a lot of
[2:16:49] people got a new spirit and they believe
[2:16:52] that is the Holy Ghost new heart new
[2:16:56] spiritual you have a new outlook you
[2:16:58] love the Lord a new spirit things jeans
[2:17:00] yes but get stopped and many people get
[2:17:03] mixed up when they get a new spirit
[2:17:05] the thing that's it but look at your
[2:17:09] life what are the fruits of it because
[2:17:11] the Holy Ghost has a certain fruit their
[2:17:13] fruits of the spirit and if these fruits
[2:17:18] in a manner Philip Watson and I'm
[2:17:21] turning down Sydney because you're just
[2:17:23] video or some of you people walking
[2:17:31] along this is the Prophet saying well I
[2:17:33] just can't quit drinking I just can't
[2:17:35] quit this the Holy Ghost comes to live
[2:17:38] in you to make all these cans get away
[2:17:40] from you so all that you see rhymes and
[2:17:43] when you hear you don't cut you hear and
[2:17:45] it all is no worldly music and what you
[2:17:47] do with that boy in a world when you're
[2:17:48] not girl in the world
[2:17:49] what did you anticipate any premise all
[2:17:51] these things that that your finest have
[2:17:52] doing that's what the Holy Ghost comes
[2:17:55] for the change your makeup the change
[2:17:59] your attitude
[2:18:05] and when that change takes place no you
[2:18:07] are candidate for the rapture outside of
[2:18:13] that you are doing it by information and
[2:18:16] not by genuine revelation make woman
[2:18:26] stop cutting they're here that's what
[2:18:29] the Holy Ghost is given for make them
[2:18:31] quit wearing shorts and slacks no
[2:18:34] excuses that's the profit that's his
[2:18:37] words I'm reading his words make them
[2:18:39] quit tattling all the gossiping and
[2:18:41] talking about people that's where the
[2:18:42] Holy Ghost comes to make you change so
[2:18:46] when a Branham makes it very clear what
[2:18:48] is wood it goes ting is supposed to
[2:18:49] produce it's alive it's about alive what
[2:18:57] good is it being in the methodologies
[2:18:58] and it can produce a life the books are
[2:19:02] not alive the life with a spirit walking
[2:19:04] in you you want to see something but the
[2:19:07] spirit shuts you up and kills the desire
[2:19:10] to see it your love could only go so
[2:19:15] much when the Holy Ghost comes your love
[2:19:17] goes beyond yourself because it's now
[2:19:19] his love through you the person you can
[2:19:22] talk to that your blood couldn't take
[2:19:24] when the Holy Ghost comes it makes you
[2:19:27] see them totally different because it's
[2:19:28] God he has no hands but your hands
[2:19:31] he has no feet but your feet he has no
[2:19:33] eyes but your eyes
[2:19:35] [Applause]
[2:19:36] [Music]
[2:19:42] [Applause]
[2:19:45] that's what it's for to make you a holy
[2:19:48] life it'll follow the instruction of the
[2:19:52] Bible every time so if you find yourself
[2:19:56] and I'm you tell me you have the Holy
[2:19:57] Ghost balloony some things you like and
[2:19:59] yeah like holy preachers say this and
[2:20:01] then you already agree with this then
[2:20:03] it's not the Holy Ghost
[2:20:05] because we're the Branham said it will
[2:20:07] follow the instructions of the Bible
[2:20:09] every time every time it copy
[2:20:16] something's apply and some things don't
[2:20:17] apply no you can't pick and choose it's
[2:20:20] not the Buffy and I eat in the snow and
[2:20:22] eating this no that's not it it's all of
[2:20:24] the wood flesh of my flesh bone of my
[2:20:29] body spirit of my spirit everything that
[2:20:33] is in court reported the Christ
[2:20:34] everything in Christ ported to the
[2:20:35] church and you are that church you are
[2:20:37] that people so you have to manifest
[2:20:39] everything that God has locked up in him
[2:20:41] that's what has to be manifested and
[2:20:43] every hindrance every obstacle in your
[2:20:46] life get rid of it that is stopping you
[2:20:49] living this life get rid of it let's
[2:20:56] today be the last day that you are
[2:20:58] putting on by the things of the world
[2:20:59] let today be the last day you have to
[2:21:02] know what's keeping you back I don't
[2:21:04] know what's keeping you back but you
[2:21:06] have to know what it is destroy it today
[2:21:08] every Amalekite every headlight every
[2:21:12] champion sight anything that's keeping
[2:21:14] you from God today I command you in the
[2:21:17] name of the Lord Jesus to get rid of it
[2:21:20] [Applause]
[2:21:24] today today today we're not leaving this
[2:21:27] place until we see the chains break off
[2:21:30] we're not trying to have a church spirit
[2:21:32] without trying to be good church members
[2:21:34] we want to be holy ghost field sons and
[2:21:36] daughters of God that'll be part of the
[2:21:39] manifestation of the sons of God that
[2:21:42] when they speak in a flash like
[2:21:44] lightning the seven thunders will utter
[2:21:46] their voices only to that group who
[2:21:49] could take
[2:21:50] and I hand it there you know the place
[2:21:52] the wood is the position I'm tired
[2:22:03] friends I'm tired of seeing people
[2:22:07] walking around in circles people have
[2:22:10] time to watch movie marathons watch TV
[2:22:13] series for hours and hours have time to
[2:22:15] do all kinds of stuff people study for
[2:22:17] university and for school and do this
[2:22:19] and when at the end of the road they
[2:22:22] cannot stand in the judgment and speak
[2:22:24] anything good and quadra see I don't
[2:22:26] even know you fighting for things that
[2:22:35] would be destroyed and when they come to
[2:22:39] their crossroads
[2:22:40] some of the wealthiest people Steve Jobs
[2:22:44] who created the Apple company he died
[2:22:47] worth about seven billion dollars he
[2:22:50] spent all that money could buy to get
[2:22:52] the best doctors to solve his medical
[2:22:54] condition and I see lead in his bed the
[2:22:57] last treat is he said I wish I had lived
[2:22:59] better he wish he could have lived
[2:23:06] better because at the end of it is money
[2:23:08] all the money he had could not change
[2:23:10] the situation I don't know if he gave
[2:23:13] His life to Christ or not but where does
[2:23:18] your soul stand today young people spend
[2:23:27] hours playing video games
[2:23:33] Winston time it was been hours on the
[2:23:37] phone talking about all kind of nonsense
[2:23:39] wastin time can't even succeed in the
[2:23:43] spirit or in the natural wasting time
[2:23:48] when time has to come to an end time
[2:23:51] with a lasts forever and as time runs
[2:23:53] out you have time to waste
[2:24:01] people have forgotten our priority what
[2:24:04] is most important because you cannot
[2:24:07] sacrifice something that's secondary the
[2:24:10] something that's primary you kind of
[2:24:13] make something that's fourth in the
[2:24:15] level of importance more important at
[2:24:17] what's worse your number one goal on
[2:24:21] this earth is deliver good
[2:24:25] everything else is sacrifice for that
[2:24:28] one but the Branham settlement is
[2:24:30] whether I meant in my family
[2:24:32] let me meant in Christ the Bible says
[2:24:40] seek first the kingdom of God first
[2:24:43] first first then His righteousness and
[2:24:46] everything else will be added young
[2:24:48] people one boyfriend/girlfriend is
[2:24:50] that'll kind of nonsense and God is
[2:24:54] nowhere in the picture
[2:24:55] and you are guaranteed for failure
[2:24:57] without the Holy Ghost guaranteed
[2:25:00] failure preachers who wanna preach that
[2:25:04] but that's the truth
[2:25:12] everything you are cheap in life without
[2:25:16] the Holy Ghost God will keep
[2:25:18] interrupting you because you are under a
[2:25:20] different covenant David asks Lord is
[2:25:24] their Lord when I look at the people

[2:25:35] people in the world they have a
[2:25:36] different end your end we sell it all
[2:25:44] sleep some of us don't have an end
[2:25:46] because will change from water to

[2:25:53] have you considered your destination
[2:25:56] where concorda to do have a bird in my
[2:26:07] heart this morning because people are
[2:26:09] too casual about this thing will it
[2:26:12] become ordinary become too normal
[2:26:14] we have got to so used to it that now we
[2:26:16] want to come and sing and shout in here
[2:26:18] because I go home and then Monday
[2:26:19] Tuesday Wednesday Thursday is a whole
[2:26:21] different story
[2:26:23] no hunger nor thirst no sigh no crying
[2:26:28] for your pollination that's in this city
[2:26:31] you pull your hat mighty heavy for your
[2:26:32] children you have not heavy for the
[2:26:38] young people I can have your Dirt Devil
[2:26:40] of China snatch them into the world it
[2:26:43] lost and pornography and fornication
[2:26:46] drugs and alcohol some of you don't even
[2:26:48] know what's going on with your children
[2:26:51] father's abandon their roles of
[2:26:53] leadership because the Holy Ghost is not
[2:26:55] in their lives mothers abandon their
[2:26:58] role the Bible says let the older woman
[2:27:00] teach the younger woman but the older
[2:27:02] woman spending time gossiping not
[2:27:07] seeking counsel not seeking advice not
[2:27:10] getting this very young man wasting time
[2:27:12] when they are called to be leaders but
[2:27:17] the Holy Ghost broods over us this
[2:27:20] morning to put things in order we read
[2:27:23] the scripture when the Holy Ghost is
[2:27:24] operating in the church all the Deacons
[2:27:26] are in their place the elders are in
[2:27:28] their place the officers are in their
[2:27:30] place all of the gifts will operate in
[2:27:32] the church the right way
[2:27:37] because we make the holy spirit a
[2:27:40] priority no this will feel prophecies
[2:27:43] will feel do I give my body to be put do
[2:27:45] I give to the poor all these things
[2:27:47] would have no charity which is love the
[2:27:50] bond of perfectness that charity l.o.v.e
[2:27:52] the holy ghost and self god is love if
[2:27:55] you don't have him operating on the
[2:27:56] inside we are nothing
[2:28:00] may this resonate in your soul city that
[2:28:03] you realize that you don't have the time
[2:28:05] to play games anymore you're not the
[2:28:07] time you cannot go back home city the
[2:28:09] same way that you came it is up to you

[2:28:34] headache if I let my hair grow but
[2:28:37] there's no executors with the Holy Ghost
[2:28:39] that's what the Prophet says it's there
[2:28:41] to make it so it'll follow the word just
[2:28:44] exactly that's what the Holy Ghost is to
[2:28:47] do it's to make you man turn your head
