any person unsaved may they be saved any person a Deliverance may you deliver them tonight take me out of the way in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen God bless you and a pleasant night to you and we are glad to be here tonight we want to go straight uh to what we want to share tonight and um you know Joshua 14:12 and Caleb says now therefore give me this mountain where of the Lord speak in that day for thou heardest as in the day that the anakim OFA that the cities were great and fenced so so if so be the Lord will be with me I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord said and tonight I want you to re relax free yourself tonight and believe in your heart whatever God requires of us require of you because of me we can fulfill it it can be done so don't see it as Giants don't see it as impossible say Lord if this is what you require of me there must be a provision need need for me to to attain it or to get to it so it's not a matter of um you want God to come down to your standard you want to get up to God's standard to God's requirement so I would just share something and then we would um uh go into what we want to say tonight now what I want to share tonight is what I believe called The Vision is of the church as being Church Without spot or wrinkle washed in his blood a church a people made pure this church is female in designation called to be the bride Jesus himself after asking who R man say I the son of man I am he told Peter Upon This Rock I will build my church we know in Colossians it describes he Jesus being the head of the body and his body is called the church that in all things he might have the pinenes note there is no man there there is no Prophet Apostle teacher evangelist he is the head and the body is called The Church Christ being her head not a man not a pastor not def fful Ministry is he is identified as the head of the body called The Church Revelation 219 says There came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talk with me saying come hither I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife I will show the the bride the Lamb's wife we not talking about Baptist Church Methodist Church Pentecost church I'm I'm in the message we not talking about that speaking about the bride who is she the Lamb's wife not some Pastor wife the Lamb's wife Revelation 19:7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife had made herself ready made herself ready now the very fact that there's a prophecy over the lasty church that sin would not be able to stay in it means that the pendulum of the church if I could use that analogy would be moving towards Holiness and my title of tonight's uh Bible study is a glorious Church Without spot or wrinkle holy without blemish that's the title tonight a glorious Church Without spot or wrinkle holy without blemish now God's holiness kept the church Pure or we can say it this way God was not going to allow his church to be defiled and the example of that was when a and Safa Believers let's call them baptized Believers came to church they offer to sell things and bring the money to the church and when uh Peter asked is this all he said yes and they kept backs it wasn't all he say didn't lie to a man you lie to the Holy Ghost and he fell dead here comes his wife his wife was she didn't know her husband died she came in and they ask the question was that all and she instead of staying with truth as we said the the unleavened bread of sincerity of Truth she chose to lie just like her husband she fell down and die and of course great fear fell among the Believers and the Bible went on to say no man joined themselves to that church but God added to the church such as would be saved question are we going to go back to that we have the answer already Yes because he said I'm Alpha and Omega so I want you to to look at it closely tonight that is the question there is not that the God wanted to judge anas Zar the question here was how in the early church the church was kept clean and brother brandham had a great desire in his heart he longed to walk into a church that's sin couldn't stay in it and he prophesied that there will be a church that sin cannot stay in it I want you to think about that so in other words the way people walk in in a laser feir attitude um Like Anything Goes naked before God naked before the Holy Ghost now that word defile means damage uh are you hearing me clearly anybody are you hearing me anybody could give a wave you hearing me clearly okay I trust I see a message came up about a unsteady internet connection so I trust in that you hear me Clint so that word defile means uh to damage the Purity or appearance of to M or spoil or desecrate to make unclean or impure to corrupt the Purity or Perfection of just spoil something or someone so that a thing or person is less beautiful or pure let's turn our Bibles tonight our first scripture reading will be from Jeremiah chapter 2 we want to read from 1 to 13 and I want to go down after that to 3132 we take it from there let's look at Jeremiah your Bibles to Jeremiah chapter 2 and let's read moreover the word of the Lord came to me saying go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem saying thus sayth the Lord I remember Thee the kindness of thy youth the the love of thine espousal when thou wentest after me in the wilderness in the land that was not soon Israel or his Holiness unto the Lord and the first fruit of his increase all that devour him shall offend evil shall come upon them seeth the Lord he he the word of the Lord oh House of Jacob and all the families of the House of Israel thus sayth the Lord what iniquity have your fathers found in me that they have gone far from me and have walked after vanity and and become vain neither said they where is the Lord that brought us out of the land of Egypt that led us through the Wilderness to a land of deserts and of pits to a land of drought and of shadow of death to a land that no man passed through and where no man dwelt and I brought you into a plentiful country to eat the fruits thereof and the goodness thereof but when he entered he defiled my land and made my inheritage and Abomination the priest said not where is the Lord and they that handled the law knew me not the pastors also transgressed against me and the prophets prophesied by Baal and walk after the things that do not profit wherefore I will yet plead with you Saye the Lord and with your children's children will I plead for Passover the Isles of CH and see send them to Kea consider diligently and see if there be such a thing had a nation change their gods which are yet no Gods but my people have changed their glory for that which do not profit be astonished oh ye Heavens at this be horribly afraid be very desolate sayth the Lord for my people committed two evils they have forsaken me the Fountain of Living Waters and hewed them out system broken system that could hold no water Jeremiah we go down to 31 and 32 of that same chapter 31 and 32 and this one is an astonishing one to me in vers to the one who say oh generation see the word of the Lord have I been a Wilderness unto Israel a land of Darkness wherefore say my people we are Lords we will come no more unto thee in other words you your own God you don't need God you don't need to seek the Lord but this is the word I want to get can a maid forget her ornament or a bride her attire yet my people have forgotten me days without number and it's powerful how God could describe can a bride forget her garments you're getting married and and you forget all about your garments he said my people have forgotten me days without number so I want you to see how God sees this relationship between himself and his people his people as a bride his people as a church his people as called by him to be separated unto him I want you to see that and I would like to go into jeriah chapter 3 and I want to I think I'll read it from the yeah Jeremiah chapter 3 reading ver verse one and I want you to see God thoughts of the behaviors and attitudes and so on just look at look at this Jeremiah chapter 3 and read in verse one they say if a man put away his wife and she go from him and become another's man shall he return unto her again shall not the land be greatly polluted so you see how the scriptures put in relationship adultery bad behavior with God's people so let's go again they say if a man put away his wife she go from him and become another's man shall he return unto her again shall not that land be greatly polluted but thou played the hot with many lovers yet return again to me sayth the Lord lift up thine eyes unto the high places and see where thou H has been lying with in the ways thou sat for them as the Arabian in the wilderness and thou has polluted land with thy hams and thy wickedness so then in the amplifi that that chapter that verse two says lift up your eyes to Bear Heights and see where have you not been adulterous laid with by the wayside you have sat waiting for lovers eager eager for adult idolatry like the Arabian Desert tries man who wait to plunder in the wilderness and you have polluted the land with your vile hot Tre and your wickedness unfaithfulness and Disobedience to God this is big so they said you you you pollute the land with vile hot Tre your wickedness and that wickedness is unfaithfulness and Disobedience to god let's continue verse three therefore the showers have been withholden and there have been no lattering so God is saying because of the behavior no showers no lattering for thou Hast a hor forehead and refuses to be ashamed and it's it says therefore the showers have been withheld Amplified there has been no spring rain yet you have the brow of a prostitute you refuse to be ashamed who four will thou not from this time cry unto me my father the what the guide of my youth will he reserve his anger forever will he keep to the end behold th I spoken and done evil things as thou couldest the Lord said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king as thou seen that which backsliding Israel had done she had gone up from every high mountain and under every tree and had played the hot and I said after she done all these things turn down to me but she returned not and a treacherous sister Judah saw it and I saw when all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away I had given my bill of divorce yet a treacherous sister Judah feared not but went and played the hot also and it came to pass the likeness of aom that she defiled the land and committed adultery with stones and with stops Hallelujah and yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah had not turned unto me with her whole heart but fakely say but fakely say the Lord so so so this this this one here that that not but the whole heart the Amplified said but in spite of all of this a faithless and treacherous sister Judah did not return to me in sincerity and with a whole heart but only in share hypocrisy verse 11 and the Lord said unto me the backsliding Israel had Justified herself more than treacherous Judah go and Proclaim these words towards the North and say return thou back th Israel said the Lord and I will cause my anger to fall upon you and I will not cause my anger to fall upon you for I am merciful sayth the Lord I will not keep anger forever only acknowledge thine iniquity that thou has transgressed against the Lord thy God and has scattered thy ways to The Strangers under every Green Tree and he have not obeyed my voice sayth the Lord that verse 13 says only know and understand and acknowledge your iniquity and guilt that you have rebelled and transgressed against the Lord your God and have scattered your favors among strangers under every Green Tree and you have not obeyed my voice sayith the Lord turn oh backsliding children say the Lord for I am married unto you I will take you one of a city and two of a family and I will bring bring you to Zion Oh I feel like praising God right here hallelujah hallelujah go give God some Praises oh you could see uh God's passion and God's heart and God is describing it as a woman and and and this this this verse here is is so beautiful and he says uh verse 14 and the Amplified says return oh faithless Children of the whole 12 tribes says the Lord for I Am Lord and Master and husband to you I will take you not as a nation but individually one from a city and two from a tribal family and I will bring you to Zion verse 15 and I will give you pastors according to my heart which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding and the scriptures in amplifi for that says and I will give you spiritual Shepherds after my own heart in the final time would feed you with knowledge and understanding and judgment may God bless his word oh give the Lord some Praises right now oh thank you Lord Jesus and here it is we go to our core text and is a familiar text it's from Ephesians 5 we want to read from verse 22 to 27 Ephesians 5 if you have have it B Ephesians 5 we want to read from verse 22 to 27 wise submit yourself unto own husbands as unto the Lord so now we just left the Old Testament and showing god making comparisons to woman wife and your husband and so on like that and he seen them Harting theel parading theel prostituting theel he still want them to return here we in the New Testament now Ephesians 5 wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands and unto the Lord for the husband is head of the wife comparison even as Christ is the head of the church and he's a savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let your wives be to their own husbands in everything so he's given the clean comparison of the operation of a wife to a husband as Christ and the church husbands verse 25 love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and give himself for it reason purpose that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word so I hope tonight that this scripture brings a new meaning to you in the context of what we are presented that he might sanctify and cleanse it with a washing of the Water by the word reason that he might present it to himself so in other words he's not going to leave you as you are he's not going to pick you up from the world and leave you as you are worldly filthy whatever that he might present it to himself what kind of a church this is the vision here now a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle and in between here or any such thing but that it should be holy without blemish that that blemish is without fault so this here is the great vision of God and I know that you might remember we continue to read this in marriages and in ceremonies and we talking about but this is a great mystery he's speaking about Christ and the church yet he talking about husband and wife or could we give the Lord some Praises so I want you to see clearly that there's an objective of this glorious church that God promised in the last days this church must be presented to himself this church have to be Sanctified and cleansed by the washing of the Water by the word now let's continue and and this is where I want to get to an indictment over Ministry and a life of Holiness but Brandon I said I don't think I am he said I want to be a holy if the Lord ever told me to roll I guess I would roll I want to be holy anyhow to live a life of Holiness means cleanness before God and he said I condemn the thing I accuse it this is indictment now this is not brother over inditing anybody okay because this indictment over me over all the minister over Ministry Elders deacons is it's over because brother bam said I stand as Jesus Christ attorney okay listen care I accuse it of crucifying the word of God before the people B woman short wearing standing up in the choir somebody said to me the other day some woman asked me said well where do you think you'd find I said if the Lord asked me to pick a dozen out over the world I'll be scared to death when by discernment of the spirit stand there and watch them stand like that and see them things over there the dirty filthy loow down cigarette suckers out there car on like that and standing rqu and sing in that condition and let the audience see them they will say well if she can do it I can too and here it is a Christian Life is a life of Holiness and Purity I do I'm not talking about message life so this is where I want you to think what Caleb said if the Lord be with me I shall be able to a Christian Life is a life of Holiness and Purity say it after me a Christian Life is a life of Holiness and Purity let's say one more time a Christian Life is a life of Holiness and Purity Give the Lord some praise oh blessed be the name of the Lord this is Brother Bram I indict them in the name of Jesus Christ for their fil and built they have brought the gospel to a disgrace and those who try to hold it are called Fanatics and say that's oldfashioned I indict them in the name of Jesus Christ he said the Bible said that when the spirit and the enemy comes in like a flood God will raise up a standard against it and when in this day with a lot of impersonation men acting like Christians pretending to be it is and in their heart as black as the smutty walls of Hell there's many pastoring today that should be out Cutting Corner or something be better off there is men with their theologies and great degrees and things like that and knows no more about God than a hot that knows about Egyptian KN you talk to them about the power of God and the resurrection it's a fanatical preacher that was in the days gone by it show knows where they are they don't realize where what day they living in oh praise God and this is closing up this part here and as my brethren stand here this morning he's praying I pray talk what ministers each of these ministers here these ministering Spirits God hear my prayer I pray that you will Purge that gift that is in them if they are preachers make them better preachers if they evangelists make them them better evangelists if they are teachers make them better teachers if they are Pastors make them better pastors God grant that they may be filled with the spirit of God and will be energized with the great super vine that will give them life eternal and power to minister with and to not touch the needy world as it needs today oh give go give the Lord some Praises tonight so I trust this would kind of help you tonight to see it is not a put on it is not this is not the Pentecostal age where it had gifted men signs ons and miracles gifted men and they had no life that is why God in a prophet to bring us the word okay the Pentecostal had a great age 1906 out Point Dynamic Spirit but it couldn't bring them to adoption it couldn't bring them to Perfection it couldn't bring them into raping fate because they didn't have the word to take them dear here come the prophet now with the word the full word all the word and and tonight this is what we have to grasp we have to say I don't want to be churchy I don't want to be a church member I want to be part of this body called The Bride to get in you need to get in by the spirit okay not by water baptism but by the baptism of the spirit Spirit is by one Spirit you see you can't break the word by one Spirit we are baptized into the body and when God put you into that bright body nobody could take take you out okay so let's continue praise the Lord St John 17 verse 16 to 19 this is Jesus and Jesus is speaking and speaking about his disciples now these men are men just like you and I born in sin shape iniquity they following Christ they are hearing about this kingdom of God they hearing about um not of this world and so and Jesus in St John 1716 saying they are not of the world even as I am not of the world sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is true now I want you to see the importance of they being Sanctified in order to go forward because you see it come like we born nasty and filth we it's muddy it's dirty for God to begin to use us he has to take us and clean us up and then Jesus went further in verse 18 as thou sent me into the world even so I sent them into the world and for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified to the truth now this here is mindblowing because Jesus was saying I sanctify myself I am making that sacrifice that they also may be Sanctified now Jesus came Sanctified because the father Sanctified Jesus and that scripture is found in St John 10 if you want to find it you could turn to it in John 10 verse 30 to 38 and this is when Jesus dropped the big one in them in verse 13 he say and my father are one that's what Jesus said in John 10 vers 30 I'm my father one then Jesus Took up Stones against again again to Stone him the Jews sorry then the Jews took up stones again to Stone and Jesus answered them say many good works have I showed you from my father from which of those Works do you Stone me the Jews answered him saying for a good work we Stone thee not but for blasphemy and because thou being a man maketh thyself God Jesus answered them is it not written in your law I said ye are Gods if he called them Gods unto whom the word of the Lord came to came and the scripture cannot be broken say ye of him listen Jus words say ye of him whom the father had Sanctified and sent him into the world th Blasphemous because I said I am the Son of God if I do not the works of my father believe me not but if I do though you believe not me believe the works that he may know and believe that the father is in me and I in so Jesus said clearly here in this scriptures verse 36 whom the father had Sanctified and sent him into the world so Jesus was Sanctified came to the Earth and he said I sanctify myself for your sake that you also may be Sanctified and he went on further and said as my father send me so send I you and this brings us now to Romans 12 there's a familiar one Romans 121 and2 I beseech you therefore Brethren this is not Sinners this is not rum Drinkers and this is not paror this is Brethren I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice Okay so from the Jewish tradition they know what sacrifice is you take a lamb you take a bulock you take a goat you put on the altar it fill the sacrifice it's an offering unto God and we know that that was being done until that perfect lamb came right and here is Paul say we not talking about no de sacrifice we are talking about a Living Sacrifice and we're talking about your body your body present your body a Living Sacrifice in other words words your entire being on the altar of God as a Living Sacrifice how holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and maybe I just take a quick look at this in the Amplified and see what it says here praise the Lord in the meantime you just give God a praise offering blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah okay so I want to read this in amplifi I appeal to you therefore Brethren and beg of you in view of all the mercies of God to make listen a decisive dedication of your bodes pre presenting all your members and faculties as a Living Sacrifice holy devoted consecrated and well pleased to God which is your reasonable rational intelligent service and spiritual worship so we go back to uh the regular scripture verse two and being not conformed to this world but be transformed by renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God the Amplified says do not be conformed to this world this age Fashion After and adapted to the external superficial Customs but be transformed Changed by the entire renewal of your mind by its new ideals and its new attitude so that you may prove for your yourself what is the good and acceptable perfect will of God even the thing which is good and acceptable perfect in his sight for you so tonight by sharing these thoughts by sharing these things this bring a fresh infusion into your mind as to what God how God wants us to live how God wants us to treat each other how God want us to come into His presence how God and and we said uh one of the things that separate the God we serve from everything else is his Holiness and and we cannot say wear white clothes and and and and up everything to the neck and to the the arms and and say that is Holiness or we don't do and don't do and keeping laws that's not Holiness Holiness is when God's presence could be revealed to you it is his Holiness not our Holiness we don't have Holiness I think the last lesson that we shared with you about the beauty of Holiness uh the key scripture de was Isaiah coming into presence and God let Uzziah fall and Ministry crash as king and Isaiah shooked up went into the temple and began to cry out unto God he's a prophet because I'm speaking the word speaking for God Isaiah put out 66 books Isaiah and here it is when he come into presence he saw the seraps he saw the burners he said wo is me when you come into presence is not whoo is you and you and blaming this one and accusing this one no who is me I am undone I am a man of unclean lips it brings you so conscious of your littleness it makes you so conscious of how small you are in presence when you see somebody in arrogance and nobody can talk to them and tell them anything you know they come into presence yet because when this presence hit but Bron he was in a corner somewhere he said for days he was numb he say you know the blessings of God I should only Paul God when John fell he fell as one dead he knew Jesus in the flesh but that presence that Daniel fell all these brothers one reaction One Behavior Moses take off your shoes the place you stand is Holy Ground so God reveal himself from a level of Holiness and I don't if anybody think we sanctification Holiness and like you know this is not mess what they are ignorant let them be ignorant intellectual stupidity just leave them in stupidity this is what God going to have a glorious Church Without spot or rer as I said if the church is moving towards no sin or where sin cannot stay in the church it is only because of his Holiness you know what he did by judging as n Fire he kept the church holy could somebody say amen he kept the church pure because if that is allowed the church will come corrupt what was the message a couple of Sundays about the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth because you see a little leaven will leaven the whole lump and if rotness start to come in it will rotten the whole group it will rot the whole church it will rot the right body so God have to get the L out so God will drop some bums to rock off and blow out the rocks that do offend off of his holy mountain go going move out ministers God G move out Elders God will move out deacons ushers people individuals go going to shift things are WR so that this will come to pass his Holiness his presence his power will prev you see it in deep to deep brother preach you come say you know what I'm waiting on I don't know if you come I don't know if you'll be here I'm waiting on the angel of the Lord he's waiting he's waiting and when the angel enter into the room he said he is here now I think his brother Billy Paul give a testimony and of brother Braham says Billy you know something about wanting to see the angel he want bil told to see the angel or whatnot and he put a pillow I may not get this story all together in detail that way he put a pillow over Billy Paul's head and said you know where the sink is at or the Bas that or something that I want you to look there he's standing there and then he he moves the the pillow and when brother Billy Paul look you see a man standing there he describ him and that presence and brother Billy Paul give a testimony that since that experience he always knew when the angel came so it appears as if because brother Billy Paul had to work with brother brandham in the ministry of the spirit I'll say that way he had us to be aware of and be conscious of when this being or this angel came into the room so he said before even bam said it he will know the angel is there and when the angel came among the people you would hear brah say I take every Spirit under my control for the glory of God because he knew William brandham knew that the full authority of heaven was behind him then so there's not a demon could challenge that not when Michael is there not when the angel is there not when that power is there and that same thing will be applied to the lasty church that same thing will be applied to the adopted sons that same thing will be applied to the apostolic church because believe you me there is going to be an Apostolic Church in The Last Days Apostolic church and and and that is why you will get Apostolic conditions that is why you could hear about when the Press come down there was no press if there's no Apostolic church that doesn't make any sense what they going to press us for for books and tapes absolutely not the only way press could come is because Jesus Christ the original grain is being reproduced and a big B he says the ministry has come to Perfection when when Christ is reproduced in the natural it's a direct quote I say it again the ministry we talk about Ministry and this brother Ministry and that brother Ministry preach a good message and he preaching Mysteries preaching this and preaching that fine but there's a word concerning coming to Perfection coming to Perfection is not more Mysteries and more talk the ministry has coming into Perfection when Christ is reproduced in natural not verbal in natural that is Christ back on the Earth again in human flesh in other words the word made flesh okay so we talk about presenting your bodies a Living Sacrifice being on the altar which is your reasonable service and and then your mind being transformed now when Israel came out out something I always refer back to when Israel came out of Egypt they don't know who this God is and we when we come out of the world we get convicted we want to serve Jesus we don't know who God is yet we know God is alive Jesus saved me I got baptized in Jesus name and if you have not get baptized in Jesus name you should if you haven't given your heart to the Lord you should okay and you shall receive the cancellation of your sins remission of your sins and you shall receive his holy ghost but listen to this I want to share this with you and this have to do with setting your mind in order for Holiness you can't repent for what Adam done you never done it Adam did it you just get forgiveness what you have done the old nature is still there and then talk about here's a human heart and watch now this one here have a snake in it that is sin and he has his life this one here has a dove in it which is the Holy Spirit and he has a life now one here with the snake in it has malice hatred envy and what's causing it well and the other one have joy love longsuffering and there's a dove that is causing that one and the other Behavior hatred Envy snake wasn't right now when you ask and you are forgiven of your sins you only done this taking that away but the thing that make you do it is still there which is the old root of E evil it is still there notice when you repent and get baptized in the name of Jesus Christ he forgive you of your sins then and this is the part we want to get to then secondly comes sanctification and listen to this which sets our mind in order for Holiness now if this is not presented Church could just be like a club churches that could be a place where you look for a boyfriend or you look for a girlfriend or you look for you know some help or some blessing or you look for some like some holy water if if in other words you have to begin to see God's mind and God's thoughts what he wants the people to understand so that is why God didn't just send Moses to deliver the people he sent Moses to deliver the people to bring them to the Mountain of God that they could hear from God and get instructions to know God how he lives what he loves what he what what pleases him you see so it's not so we don't want to come down this far and have the god of our own creation people have that you God is a good God all the time like a phrase and they're doing their own thing you know and I am God so and they have you know like if he's a man just like them we're not talking about that I'm not talking about your gods or The God that you create or I say this way the god of your imagination we're not talking about that you see the scriptures we are reading we talking about the God of the Bible not the god of your interpretation the god of the scriptures okay so so this is the same thing so next come secondly comes sanctification which sets our mind in order for Holiness to think right sanctification is a Greek word which means clean and set aside for service next after sanctification comes the baptism of fire and holy ghost that God might dwell in us and the fire of God cleanses our hearts from sin and puts the Holy Ghost Inside in the natural when a woman gives birth to a baby first is blood water then blood then the spirit the life and then when a baby is born into the kingdom of God it comes the same way water blood spirit sanctification the second stage cleanses the mind and sets the heart in order of Holiness a man can repent of his sin and immoral woman he finds a drunker every time he smell the drink it is still dear but when he gets Sanctified it cleanses the desire out of him it takes the want of it away so if you're a smoker it takes the want of smoking away if you're lusting after woman it take that thing away it can still be tempted but it takes the war of it away he's still not right yet then he is baptized with the Holy Ghost and Fire cleansed burnt out and then put into service for God oh my Hallelujah and we want to look at uh I think we look at the scripture before 1 Thessalonians 3 and Paul was talking about night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face and that might per what is lacking in your faith now God himself Our Father our Lord Jesus Christ direct our way unto you and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one towards another and towards all men even as we do towards you and this is this is something else in genuine Christianity you cannot be Sanctified close to God walking the spirit and cannot treat your brethren right something is wrong in other words The Life of Christ upon you will cause you to deal right with your fellow man and I'm not even talking about church folks I'm talking about all man how the Bible say live peaceably as much as possible with all man that is the life of God you're not trying to uh R up the government and R up bring on the press and want to challenge the system that is foolishness that is not the life of Christ because see we don't know what extension and time God has given for the last one to come in the scripture we read where God talking about harot and how prostitute themselves and what not and yet you're looking for that to return and and and to love I'm your husband you could see the compassion God deals with the mercy God deals with you could see it now why when they caught a woman in adultery and they quot the law and said Moses said to Stone this woman and Jesus could could write on the ground say which one of you without him cast the first stone woman no more you could see how he came to amend the book you could see how he came to heal H Hearts now I know there are people and ministers that manipulate when people fall and sin to control them hold them under grip God never did that when God free you he say who the son of man set free is free indeed I don't care what you have done in your past I don't care what you have been through when God free you you are free even the woman at the well when God freed her she could tell everybody come see a man there's no shame in your past your past is your past your past will determine your future is your choices and decision will determine your future your choice to repent your choice to get it right your choice to do the right thing because thou has chosen your decision and your decision tonight in receiving what is being spoken here tonight will affect your future as a Christian because this is something you accept or reject not as a thought but as something to apply oh blessed be the name of the Lord so Paul says and the Lord make to increase and ab in love towards one another and towards all men even as we do towards you to the end that he may establish your hearts one unblameable in Holiness before God even our father at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his Saints Hallelujah and and this is um chapter one furthermore okay all right yes chapter 4 this is this istion of I don't think we had read this one 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 and this is verse one furthermore then we beseech you Brethren and exalt you by the Lord Jesus that as you have received of us how you ought to walk and to please God so that you are bound more and more for you know what Commandments we give you by the Lord Jesus for this is the will of God now this is Holy Ghost people talking to you this is the will of God even your sanctification that you should abstain from fornication and this is the verse I want to get to that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and in honor in other words you have a choice of how you deal with your body how you manage the issues in your body The Desires in your flesh desires of your spirit he's saying that everyone supposed to know their system what will affect you what will bother you remember the girl lady who she used to drink and smoke and in the bar and so on she came to the Lord she the Lord and what not she's walking on the road one day and something tell her why why you go inside there and testify and was the devil setting her up so she going back there next minute she on the floor she messed up next minute is demons upon her life because she actually leave her environment and went into the enemy camp so to speak so so in other words she if she was aware of her response in going that atmosphere she never go near there I guess when you see sin you run when you see drama coming and you can't deal with it run that what Joseph did ptif wife make a big move on Joseph and Joseph just run for his life I guess other brother say running sound like a man and you fall Like a Man Too Adam fell without one woman extra woman Inside the G and he fell he fell because he dis belief okay so so we want to stay straight with that word so Bible says here now that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor not in the lust of concus spicant even as the Gentiles which know not God so Paul keep comp he he's comparing listen you cannot operate presently as if you were living as in the past that no man go beyond and the his brother in any matter because that the Lord is the Avenger of all such that we have for warn you and testify for God has not called us under uncleanness but under Holiness God has not called us to uncleanness but under Holiness in the Amplified verse three says this is the will of God that you should be consecrated separated set apart for pure and holy living that you should abstain and Shrink from all sexual vice that each one of you should know how to possess control manage his own body in consecration Purity separated from things profane and and to be used in The Passion of lust like the Heathen who are ignorant of the true God and have no knowledge of his will oh blessed be the name of the Lord W keep along again we on the home stretch here now so the Bible says about Christ and this is in uh skip down chapter 5 of Hebrews 5 Hebrews and verse six says and he also in another place said thou a priest Forever After the order of MDC ver 7even who in the days of his flesh when he offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was hden that he feared here we go ver eight though he was son yet learned he obedience by the things he suffered and being made perfect he became author of Eternal salvation unto all them that obey him called of God a high priest after the order of MDC of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing ye are dull of hearing for when the time you ought to be teachers you have need of one to teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and I become such as need of milk not strong meat I know we read this before but everyone that useth milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness or he's a babe but strong meat belong it to them that are full age even those who by reason of use of their senses exercised to discern both good of evil oh praise God so solid food is for grown men for those whose senses and mental faculties are trained by practice to discriminate and distinguish between what is morally good and Noble and what is evil and contrary either to Divine or human law now the life that God wants of us is a life of growth a life of increase a life of addition a life of fruitfulness a life of multiplication a thing that we saying again tonight your life our life the life that God want for us is a life of growth a life of increase a life of addition a life of fruitfulness and multiplication and this we could draw from second Peter 1 it's a scripture we are familiar with but I want you to look again and I'm going to read it more mostly from the Amplified but I'm read this by grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of our Lord Jesus Christ Jesus our lord according as his divine power had given unto us all things all things remember we are well able to take this land all things we are well able to possess this number all things that pertain to life and godliness and the channel is through the knowledge of him that had called us to glory and virtue whereby a given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of his divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in this world through lust and this this here and we take off here now in the Amplified by means of these he has bestowed on us his precious and exceeding great promises so that through them you might Escape by flight from the moral Decay rotness and Corruption that is in the world because of cesses lust and greed and become sharers and partakers of his divine nature so I'm going to go forward in the Amplified five verse five for this reason adding your diligence to the Divine promise employ every effort exercising your faith to develop virtue so in the King James it have an to Faith at virtue and virtue knowledge and song but listen to how it is placed here employ every effort which is giving all diligence exercising your Fai to develop virtue Excellence resolution Christian energy and in exercising virtue develop knowledge intelligence and in exercising knowledge develop self-control and in exercising self-control develop stead steadfastness patience endurance and in exercising steadfastness develop godliness piety and exercising godliness develop brotherly affection and in exercising brotherly affection develop Christian love I like how this is phrased because it shows that you are actually doing something in in other words you are applying what you're hearing giving all diligence add add you're not just sitting down like a lump on a log waiting for things to happen to you no you are acting on what God promised and verse seven says and in exercising godliness develop brotherly affection in exercising brotherly affection develop Christian love so how come somebody could claim to have brotherly kindness and there's no exercise no display when issues come you still have a you still have a grudge you don't ex can you're just a caral natural normal you Vex your Vex you're angry angry somebody give you this and you can't love somebody who treat you badly you don't know they had a bad day they get upset and they treat you badly yes they're wrong they treat you badly but you are called to develop to exercise brly love how much times are they did somebody say 7 Time s they ask you that question how much time shall I forgive my brother 70 * 7 yes 797 a day and when you could exercise in that kind of a way then it's anchored you have it brotherly kindness you test it you you experience it oh praise the name of the Lord blessed be name of the Lord all right for for as these qualities are yours and increasing among you they will keep you from being idle or unfruitful into the personal knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ the Messiah whoever lacked these qualities is BL spiritually shortsighted seeing only what is near to him and become oblivious to the fact he was cleansed from his old sin Hebrews 10:14 you have to find this one now read it one verse there for by one offering he has perfected forever them that are Sanctified the Amplified for by one single offering he has completely forever forever completely cleansed and perfected those who are consecrated and made all right we 1 Corinthians 6 911 find this one 1 Corinthians 6 9 to1 Paul speaks know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators no idolators no adulterers no effeminate no abusers of themselves with mankind no thieves no Covetous no drunkards no revilers no extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God but such were some of you but you were washed read it again such were some of you but he are washed but he are Sanctified but he are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God be Amplified let's read do you know that the unrighteous and the doers will not inherit or have any share in the kingdom of God do not be deceived misled neither the impure or the immoral no Idols no adulterers nor those who participate in homosexuality nor cheats swindlers and thieves no greedy graspers nor drunkards no F mou revilers and slanderers or extortioners and rubbers will inherit or have any share in the kingdom of God but some of you were once but you were washed clean purified by a complete atonement for sin and made free from the guilt of sin you were consecrated set apart hallowed and you were Justified pronounced righteous by trusting in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ okay first Peter so you R some scriptures first Peter one verse there 1 Peter 1 verse2 Peter speaks elect according to the for knowledge of God the Father true sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ Grace unto you and peace be mother I want to pause the a minute and you know there's a familiar scripture in Romans 8 talk about who he found he called who he call Justified and who he justified he already glorified note in that scripture it never said anything about sanctify now justification is of God and sanctification and and and glorification is of god that is God's job we can't justify ourselves we can't glorify our glorify ourselves but you see that sanctification that sanctification in that slot is where we are at is is what we could work out is what we could attain or achieve or get to so let me read this First Peter 1 to be Amplified who were chosen and forn of God that's a big deal chosen forn and the father and consecrated Sanctified made Holy by the spirit to be obedient to Jesus Christ so we want to bring the sanctification as it connects to obedience let me say it again we want to share with you sanctification as it connects to obedience so consecrated Sanctified made Holy by the spirit to be obedient and 1 Peter 1:22 says seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfake love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fently oh my I could shout here right now because this is genuine Christianity this is not no game there's not no going down in church and you come in and you go you talk to nobody and yeah mixing with nobody and you're on your own and you you have your own problems no there not that they Amplified since by your obedience to the truth through the Holy Spirit you have purified your hearts for the sincere affection of the Brethren see that you love one another fervently from a pure heart and I am almost dear oh praise the Lord almost dear it's just 14 pages I have and this is now on page 13 so you know we almost there Hebrews 13:4 and I want you to find that scripture as we want to wrap up here know Hebrews 134 that scripture is marriage is Honorable in all and the bed is undefiled but hongas and adulterers God will judge now that word undefiled means pure spotless unblemished unspotted unsed Immaculate or this this is synonyms untan without aain undefiled means not made corrupt impure or unclean not made morally impure now there has to be a reason that the word will said marriage is unble in all and the bed UND defile but does UND defile mean anything goes I don't think so I don't think so at all now the reason I'm bringing this because first Peter 3 1 to7 the Bible speak about likewise he wives being subjection to your own husbands own husband not every man that if any obey not the word which is your husband they also May without the word be won by the conversation of their wives while they behold your chaste conversation or behavior or life coupled with fear whose adorning let it not be with outward adoring and platin of here or wearing of gold or putting on apparel but let it be the hidden man man of the heart in that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God a great price note sisters this is the goal this is the target not your clothes not your shoes not your hairstyle but the type of spirit who fight and after this man in Old Time the holy woman also who trusted in God adorned themselves being in subject unto their own husbands even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters he are as long as you do well and not be afraid with any amazement likewise he husbands there's the part I want to get to dwell with them according to knowledge give honor unto the wife as the weaker vessel and being ears together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered now we are not talking about party going people we not talking about uh Carnival people or or going to fet we talking about Christians and here it is you could see the scriptures identify that things could happen within a relationship and a marriage that prayers are hindered so so I am hoping that what we are sharing here would even clear that up that you as a husband you as a wife a Believer you would operate in such a way because this is not just for marriage now because you as a single person you could do things and act in a way that your prayer is hindered what you want is when you pray God answers what you want is when you pray God honors this is what you want you don't want your prayer to be uh hindered so when the Bible says marriage is Honorable and the bed is undefiled it doesn't mean anything goes because in this age where Hollywood and pornography and everything else want to Define what people should do or should not do God expect us to behave right and the question brother BR says if there's a question don't do it then you're right so anytime there come a question in how we supposed to behave and act in a relationship once there's a question don't do it then you're right God want a Sanctified life in the truest sense oh blessed be the name of the Lord so Acts 26 and this is about the final we get into it acts acts so don't be swayed there's a lot of things out there that are contrary to God's plan and program and I'm seeing this you know people have an attitude if the husband and wife agree then it's okay well if it's not breaking God's law and God's word suppose your husband and wife agree to the wrong thing is it right no it's not right so God doesn't give a free blanket bed is on the file therefore we could do what we want no make sure Hollywood and the people out there not directing the show inside your house make sure it's not people outside and what people doing outside influencing your life Acts 26 vers 14 to 18 and when we were fall into the Earth I heard a voice speaking unto me saying in Hebrew tongue Saul Saul why persecute thou me it is hard for thee to kick against bricks and I said who are thou Lord he said I am Jesus whom th persecutest but rise stand upon thy feet blessed be the name of the Lord stand up on thy feet for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou seen and of those things in which I will appear unto thee here we go delivering thee from the people and from the Gentiles unto whom now I send thee and this verse I want to get to now to open their eyes and to turn them from Darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God that they might receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are Sanctified by faith that is in me let me repeat let me read it again that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are Sanctified by what by faith that is in me and we close with this tonight 2 Corinthians 7:1 and this captures the part that we have to play to be in this glorious Church Without spot a wrinkle this is not the pastor p and you love your pastor and and you know you you stay with your pastor you see you're true this is not that okay this is not that this is Paul 2 Corinthians 7 verse1 and maybe we could read this together 34 if you find it 34 having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the Flesh and spirit perfecting Holiness in the fear of God amen and he Amplified it says therefore since these great promises are ours beloved let us cleanse ourselves from everything that contaminates and defiles body and spirit and bring our consecration to completeness in the reverential fear of God oh blessed be the name of the Lord friends I trust tonight that you get an infusion of how God sees this bride how God sees his wife and why the scripture says his wife had made herself ready there are things that we are called to do you know brother saying make yourself a Christian he also say many people say God could take this Spirit from me and that Spirit from me said but there's something you have to do so when they were coming to the Wilderness as we close they were fed Mana they were fed meat they were given water on the Rock but when they come into the land Mana ceased nothing fallen from Heaven anymore have to plant have to toil have to fight have to cut them the ground he said them little by literally possessed the land I want you tonight to take this ground of was presented tonight little by little see what God requires of the church he's going to have a glorious Church Without spot without wrinkle not because I say so but because he said so nothing will stop that church just as an anas and saf perished because he was going to keep that church clean it's come another church that people will die just like today people don't want to apply what is applied to them concerning the Corona virus they will die some will die some will get sick you have a choice you either be on the size of the virus or the side of the vaccine there's in between I told someone I said you could make Style by saying you're not taking any vaccine or you chase the you have a choice and you have a choice big deal you could keep your choice but guess what you have no choice in getting Corona virus you got tell the virus don't come here you I'm not taking here you get it to deal with we have a choice tonight to cleanse ourselves that is your choice because do has chosen though if you need Deliverance you find yourself driven and you find yourself needing a helping hand you could see us you could talk with us we could pray with you we can believe God for you and and pray it through and and so on but but but please don't stay as you are God a Christian Life is a life of Holiness and Purity let us bow our heads oh blessed be the name of the Lord heavenly father I thank you tonight this has been a challenging uh uh uh teaching to present I am in no way worthy to even present this I stand before you in that scripture of Corinthians cleansing ourselves I Look to be cleansed to be purified to be made pure by your fire but this this is your truth Lord and this is your truth that must be given to your people God as you made me aware of it and Quicken it to me I share it with them Father you know every heart goded here tonight Lord May there be a change Lord there are people who are tough who are difficult who are hard-hearted who have been coming to CH for years and it seems like there's no change and sometimes is a difficult for us to look and see that it is tough to see them in their Rebellion to see them in their bad attitude not just in church but towards their husbands towards wives towards things in general and to see a struggle in the human Spirit unsanctified natural but tonight we are confronted with your word with the mirror of your word with the truth of it this has nothing to do with group and church and my Revelation and this one Revelation this have to do with the purity of your truth one of the angels having the V say come I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife and his wife had made herself ready by putting on the clothes of the promised word help us tonight dear God Peter identify it's by these promises we become partakers of his divine nature and here Paul says having therefore these precious promises let us cleanse ourselves but this be a target a goal for the ministry the ministers the elders the deacons the ushers the trustees every member in the church every person here under the song of my voice we this be a Target and goal in their hearts in their minds in their spirits to cleanse themselves something that God can't do something that they have to do because you couldn't say it in your word and we can't do it having therefore these precious promises let us cleanse ourselves there is a Clean and Clear Vision Lord that this bride will not be brought and presented anyhow this bride will present it as a glorious Church a church a people that you be proud of without spun without wrinkle holy without blemish bless your people tonight bless the service tomorrow that will be streamed bless the pray meeting on Friday bless the service this coming Sunday in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen God bless you Saints I thank you tonight for being such a audience I I I felt you out there and I pray that God would would bless you and I would be sending out the text and the scriptures that I read and what I placed there that uh that you could reflect on it there's a lot of scriptures that was read and um as many of you will be aware I have not really been an Old Testament preacher um but now I'm being attracted to scriptures in the Old Testament that will help guide us here in the New Testament so God bless you have a good night God be with you
