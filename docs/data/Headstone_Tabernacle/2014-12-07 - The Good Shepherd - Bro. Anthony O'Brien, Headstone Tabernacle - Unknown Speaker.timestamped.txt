[13:54] and they don't have much
[13:56] went way in the country area four was
[13:59] dirt road and so on
[14:02] and so on real
[14:04] we call real country africa
[14:07] and to see
[14:09] this brother who passed on to be with

[14:13] and you know he got on victory he went
[14:15] and saw the picture in somebody's home

[14:19] books
[14:20] and he converted from a muslim to
[14:22] christianity and his whole family got
[14:25] converted and so on and liver
[14:27] transformed life
[14:28] but people in university to be converted
[14:31] there was a professor that was there to
[14:32] testify
[14:34] of when he came to her and
[14:36] asked her you want to make an
[14:37] appointment to see her and she thought

[16:04] isaac
[16:06] tremendous message it's a message
[16:09] that came with a burden it brought back
[16:11] to the scriptural god to god which the
[16:13] people people people don't know the god
[16:14] of the bible they have other gods
[16:17] see like
[16:18] the poor peace of god the how much
[16:20] millions catholic church he dreamed
[16:22] about the preaching bible he just have
[16:23] to do another sign like that
[16:25] and where they had the way they had the
[16:27] sword and he said papa and he that's
[16:29] fine
[16:30] you see that you know everybody have
[16:32] their own thing
[16:33] you know i mean but we our god is the
[16:35] word
[16:36] that's right our god is not you know a
[16:39] kind of being that does operate when we
[16:41] feel like operating him you know i mean
[16:43] we don't get him to do things he's a god
[16:46] that brings a word
[16:47] and his word can't return void he's a
[16:50] goddess confirm his word and vindicate
[16:53] his word that's the god we serve we save
[16:55] a living god and it appears as if things
[16:58] are silent god loves it that way to see
[17:00] how we're going to behave to see how
[17:02] we're going to react only just that he
[17:03] keeps silent no signs no wonders no
[17:07] miracles no power no display of anything
[17:10] just raw word you say you're a believer
[17:12] i'm giving you my word
[17:14] praise god the word is god i've given
[17:17] you my word
[17:18] i'm gonna test you to see if you will
[17:20] stay with the world and as you finish
[17:22] the test i'm gonna vindicate you
[17:24] and positionally place you by your stand
[17:27] on the word how the word is god and if
[17:29] the devil couldn't move us all these
[17:31] years off the word the devil is finished
[17:35] the devil is a liar the devil can't do
[17:37] anything he is paralyzed by chains of
[17:40] circumstance because he can't get us off
[17:44] of the word all give the lord some
[17:46] praises

[17:54] you may be seated and when god finally
[17:56] gets sons and daughters that gonna come
[17:58] mature enough
[18:00] to take the word
[18:02] the devil is finished
[18:03] because every time the devil get away is
[18:06] somebody going off the word
[18:07] that's the only way the devil could move
[18:09] in you see a lie have to be enabled
[18:12] when the deep when the devil came to
[18:14] even said you shall not surely die eve
[18:16] gonna tell the devil go and smoke

[20:32] moses kept the flock of jesus
[20:34] father-in-law the priest of million he
[20:36] led the flock to the backside of the
[20:37] desert and came to the mountain of god
[20:39] even to horeb and the angel of the lord
[20:41] appeared unto him in a flame of fire out
[20:44] of the midst of a bush and he looked and
[20:45] behold the bush burned with fire and the
[20:47] bush was not consumed and moses said i
[20:50] will now turn aside and see this great
[20:52] sight why the bush is not burnt and when
[20:55] the lord saw that he turned aside to see
[20:59] and you got to turn aside to see you
[21:01] you've got you can't just be going going
[21:03] going you got to take a pause to turn
[21:05] aside to see what god is doing to see
[21:08] what god is unfolding when the lord saw
[21:10] he turned aside to see isn't that right
[21:13] that the bush was not consumed seized
[21:15] right why there was a and the lord saw
[21:17] it and said god called unto him out of
[21:19] the midst of the bush and said moses
[21:20] moses he said here am i and he said draw
[21:23] not tether
[21:24] put off your shoes from off your feet
[21:26] for the place wherein those standards is
[21:28] holy ground moreover he said i am hear
[21:30] the introduction i am the god of thy
[21:33] father the god of abraham the god of god
[21:36] calling names
[21:37] god calling historical references to
[21:40] give him pointers this is no other god
[21:42] this is the god of abraham
[21:44] of isaac praise god and god had to break
[21:46] it down for him isn't that right
[21:48] hallelujah and of god of jacob and moses
[21:51] hid his face and he was afraid to look
[21:54] upon god and the lord said i have surely
[21:57] seen the affliction of my people which
[21:59] are in egypt and i've heard they cry by
[22:02] reason of their task masters and i and i
[22:04] like that word task masters that is
[22:06] masters who come to give a task task
[22:08] masters like that word there and he hear
[22:10] the cry of your taskmasters you don't
[22:12] want to do it but the taskmasters beat
[22:14] you to do it and force you to do it and
[22:17] push you to do it you're under
[22:18] taskmasters you're being driven to do
[22:20] this and driven god here when you cry
[22:22] you have to have a cry because god wants
[22:24] to break the whip of the taskmaster god
[22:26] want to deal with the task master heard
[22:29] the cries of the task master and i know
[22:31] their sorrows and i come down to deliver
[22:33] them out of the hand of the egyptians
[22:35] and to bring them up out of that land
[22:38] listen he didn't just come down to
[22:39] deliver them he said i'm coming down to
[22:41] deliver to bring you to a position that
[22:44] you could be positionally placed
[22:46] hallelujah what land what lane are you
[22:48] talking about watch watch and i come to
[22:50] deliver them out of the land of the
[22:52] egyptians and to bring them up out of
[22:54] that land onto a good land a land
[22:56] flowing milk and honey unto the place of
[22:59] the king and i see that i tell them
[23:00] where they're going the canaanites they
[23:02] are there the hittites they are they
[23:03] also the amorites they are also there
[23:05] the parasites and heterosites they are
[23:07] all there but that's your land
[23:10] i'm not hearing you this morning
[23:12] either came with demons or dear god said
[23:15] he called you out not to just come out
[23:17] but to go on to a possession
[23:21] glory to god how many believe that this
[23:22] morning
[23:24] all right you're gonna be seated
[23:26] it's not much so here we go now so
[23:29] therefore your profession of what god
[23:32] says is not your possession

[23:57] asked a question if the first exodus had
[24:00] a crime and signed and growing and
[24:01] travailing and the second exodus had
[24:03] grown in a travail in the upper room for
[24:05] so many days what about the tweet exit
[24:07] us but abandoned prophesied he said wait
[24:09] till a little group go to calling on god
[24:12] there'll be a national showdown so in
[24:14] other words there's got to come
[24:16] something to drag the church into
[24:17] desperation then he said love supposed
[24:19] to get you desperate but if love doesn't
[24:21] get you desperate conditions will so god
[24:24] have flipped the burger anyhow you're
[24:26] going to get the same result in other
[24:28] words they've got to have a condition or
[24:30] love to get the people desperate if love
[24:33] is not doing it then conditions will
[24:35] come around your life that will get you
[24:37] desperate that you have no other way to
[24:39] go but to look up and cry out and cry
[24:42] alone and cry unto god that god can say
[24:46] that i have heard the cries of my people
[24:48] because as an angel have a vial full of
[24:50] old oars which are the prayers of the
[24:52] saints so as you pray your vow is being
[24:54] filled up as you pray the vile is being
[24:57] filled up and one of these days god will
[24:59] take all your prayers all your tears all
[25:01] your weeping all your groaning all your
[25:04] travailing are you gonna take it and put
[25:06] it on the altar and they're gonna be
[25:07] lightning thunders and voices angels
[25:09] will be dispatched to deliver your loved
[25:11] ones angels will be dispatched to
[25:14] deliver your family angels will be
[25:15] dispatched because of the prayers of the
[25:18] saints listen your prayer is not in vain
[25:24] oh
[25:26] hallelujah
[25:28] you're not any and anybody you are his
[25:30] people
[25:32] i have heard the cries of my people
[25:36] you may be seated praise god the child
[25:39] is sick you pray and the child says say
[25:41] keep on praying
[25:42] hallelujah keep on believing son is
[25:45] backstabbing keep on believing praise
[25:47] god the devil could keep them so much
[25:49] and no longer
[25:50] the only option so much he could keep
[25:52] them only after so much he can find them
[25:55] but when they all come to be free he
[25:57] said i have come down to deliver
[25:59] go and tell pharaoh let my people go
[26:08] hallelujah glory to god amen
[26:12] so one more thing one of the one makota
[26:14] and i'm gonna close here
[26:15] but abandon from god identifying himself
[26:17] by his characteristics
[26:19] he said we find that this prophet run
[26:21] away was in the wilderness for 40 years
[26:24] it taken pharaoh 40 years to drill an
[26:26] education under him
[26:28] it took god 40 years to drill it out of
[26:29] him
[26:30] drilling
[26:32] andrew
[26:34] so we find one day he was in the backs
[26:36] of the desert meet the lord god in a
[26:39] burning bush
[26:40] in the form of a pillar of fire laying
[26:42] in the bush
[26:43] he was asked to take off his shoes the
[26:45] ground he was standing was holy now look
[26:46] at this fine
[26:48] cultured educated man
[26:51] that watched the changing of his
[26:53] characteristics
[26:54] when he met god
[26:56] sometimes god does things in such a
[26:58] simple way such a foolish way to the
[27:01] canal thinking here we go
[27:04] notice a man who has been a total
[27:08] failure here you guys are
[27:10] hallelujah speaking about moses a man
[27:13] who had been a total failure and all the
[27:16] egyptian armies everything around to do
[27:17] the will of god with all the education
[27:19] at the age of 40 years old in his prime
[27:21] and yeah he is eight years old the next
[27:23] morning with his wife sitting straight
[27:25] on the mule and young one on the hip
[27:26] stick in hand going up to egypt to take
[27:28] over you talk about a ridiculous sight
[27:31] but that was displaying the
[27:33] characteristics of god
[27:35] so you mean god can take a total failure
[27:37] and still use him
[27:38] and still send them
[27:40] of course
[27:42] that's the god we serve you mean that
[27:44] same man that killed a man yes that same
[27:47] man wanted in egypt yes that becomes
[27:50] god's man because fire fell on him
[27:53] go down and tell pharaoh i am not
[27:56] telling anybody else
[27:57] i'm sending you
[27:59] who he yes he no i don't believe that
[28:03] you don't have to but if god sent it god
[28:05] will vindicate it god's going to prove
[28:08] it what a mighty god we serve let's turn

[59:24] what is a shepherd a shepherd is someone
[59:26] who knows the prophet said how to take
[59:28] care of sheep
[59:30] isn't that right all he knows is sheep
[59:33] he said that's all his concern the
[59:35] prophet even going to say he looked like
[59:36] she sometimes smelled like she sometimes
[59:39] he talked like the sheep but he knows
[59:41] his sheep he's not concerned with
[59:43] mathematics he's not concerned with
[59:44] arithmetic he's not concerned with
[59:46] science he's not concerned how to
[59:48] explain it all he knows is the sheep of
[59:51] god
[59:51] hallelujah isn't that right and all god
[59:54] is concerned about this morning is his
[59:56] sheep
[59:57] he knows his sheep
[59:59] ever since man fell
[1:00:00] in the beginning isn't that right god
[1:00:03] has made a plan and the entire plan is
[1:00:06] to bring man back into his position to
[1:00:09] bring the sheep back into the sheep full
[1:00:12] that's been the plan all along
[1:00:14] to get man back into the place where he
[1:00:17] had for him to be
[1:00:18] isn't that right
[1:00:20] isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah
[1:00:22] because then adam and eve was in the
[1:00:24] garden of eden he created an eden a
[1:00:26] garden called leader amen isn't that
[1:00:27] right amen and there they dwelt in green
[1:00:30] pastures they ate to the fruits of the
[1:00:32] trees they enjoyed the splendor they
[1:00:34] spoke and this happened they enjoy the
[1:00:36] animals they enjoy the birds they enjoy
[1:00:38] the bees they enjoy the cool crystal
[1:00:40] streams of water they enjoyed all the
[1:00:42] goodness and the blessings of god but
[1:00:44] when they were smitten amen hallelujah
[1:00:46] when sin come into the picture it drove
[1:00:48] them out from the sheep full isn't that
[1:00:50] right they ended up in the wilderness
[1:00:52] they ended up in affliction in pain
[1:00:55] eve brought four children just as god
[1:00:57] had said from his mouth isn't that right
[1:00:58] hallelujah but god's promise was always
[1:01:01] to bring them back to eden back to the
[1:01:04] sheepfold back to the place where all
[1:01:06] the blessings are back to the holy ghost
[1:01:09] back to goodness back to love back to
[1:01:11] peace back to joy back to the holy ghost
[1:01:14] back to heavenly places in christ
[1:01:16] heavenly places is a believer's position
[1:01:18] in christ that's where the heavenly
[1:01:20] places are and the only way to get to
[1:01:22] heavenly places it's for you to get back
[1:01:24] into your position
[1:01:26] same as somebody same as somebody god
[1:01:29] doesn't want for you to be in wanting
[1:01:32] to be in need to be hungry jesus said
[1:01:35] blessed are they that hunger and this
[1:01:37] for they shall be fair this is god's
[1:01:40] desire god would not want for you to be
[1:01:42] go to go unwanted holiday to go empty to
[1:01:45] go empty-handed no no no god loves you
[1:01:47] too much

[1:23:56] 1964. why it had to be shepherd he said
[1:23:59] notice angels coming
[1:24:01] angels coming and giving their message
[1:24:04] to a man of such low estate
[1:24:06] when there were men much more earthly
[1:24:08] thought of
[1:24:09] qualified than these poor illiterate
[1:24:11] shepherds the shepherd was the most
[1:24:13] illiterate of anybody
[1:24:15] he didn't know anything he didn't know
[1:24:17] nothing but just about his sheep he
[1:24:19] didn't need to know mathematics he
[1:24:21] didn't know how to split an atom
[1:24:23] he didn't need no scholarship come on
[1:24:25] now he just needed to know his sheep
[1:24:29] hallelujah isn't that right praise god
[1:24:32] amen he said that's all that he needed
[1:24:33] to know
[1:24:35] and the god of great wisdom the fountain
[1:24:37] and resource of all wisdom who would
[1:24:40] choose such a person as that person amen
[1:24:43] and bypass all the well-trained scholars
[1:24:45] that's trained to know that trained to
[1:24:48] know that it speaks one thing he said
[1:24:51] that they were trained in the wrong
[1:24:52] field
[1:24:53] he said they passed passing up all the
[1:24:55] importance of the land
[1:24:57] there were the important people great
[1:24:58] teachers
[1:24:59] cyphers the high priest many other great

[1:25:05] denominations and all the boasting
[1:25:07] theologians he said god bypass every one
[1:25:10] of them he said no that's god's wisdom
[1:25:14] isn't that right the wisdom of god is
[1:25:16] foolishness to man
[1:25:17] amen and the wisdom of man is god's
[1:25:19] foolishness isn't that right and it was
[1:25:21] god's wisdom to bypass all the greats to
[1:25:24] bypass all the high and mighty he said i
[1:25:26] am the lofty one that dwelleth with him
[1:25:29] that have a contrite heart and a broken
[1:25:31] spirit is nourished that's who he's
[1:25:33] looking for this morning contrite hearts
[1:25:36] broken spirits humble only you don't
[1:25:40] want to know nothing else but the word
[1:25:42] of god you're not concerned with nothing

[1:26:09] what's going to take me to the rapture
[1:26:12] amen amen
[1:26:15] to know christ so simple
[1:26:18] he said notice the highest heavens
[1:26:20] hastening to the on to honor earth's
[1:26:23] most humble and unlinked
[1:26:25] the highest of heaven come down to make
[1:26:28] himself known to the lowest of the earth
[1:26:31] bypassing all between
[1:26:33] to make himself known to common herdsmen
[1:26:37] isn't that right
[1:26:38] coming to give these common herdsmen the
[1:26:41] greatest message of all time
[1:26:44] isn't that right
[1:26:45] that the god that the sadducees believe
[1:26:48] that the fantasy pharisees was talking
[1:26:49] about that same god was made flesh
[1:26:52] and dwelt among them or they beheld his
[1:26:54] glory oh i can imagine those shepherds
[1:26:56] when they heard a message when they
[1:26:58] heard those angels singing they had an
[1:27:00] experience they said we've seen
[1:27:02] something we've experienced something
[1:27:04] all these angels came with a message
[1:27:06] they told us to go to bethlehem they
[1:27:08] told us to go to a certain certain place
[1:27:10] and that we'd find a messiah in our
[1:27:13] right and these shepherds took up their
[1:27:15] staffs they took up their script bags
[1:27:17] and they got to walk in and they got to
[1:27:19] walk in praise god didn't know what they
[1:27:21] were looking for they received the
[1:27:23] message the pharisees didn't know what
[1:27:24] they were looking for
[1:27:26] they were 40 years old 50 years in the
[1:27:28] message and didn't know what they were
[1:27:30] looking for they were preaching about
[1:27:32] the sick seal preaching about the beasts
[1:27:34] preaching about the antichrist they
[1:27:35] didn't know what they were looking for
[1:27:37] but some simple little shepherds some
[1:27:39] smelly little herdsmen who didn't know
[1:27:41] nothing very scott who didn't know
[1:27:43] nothing from gossip god revealed
[1:27:46] his love
[1:27:47] his power his message to them
[1:27:52] isn't that right
[1:27:53] oh here they come walking
[1:27:55] what it was what a thing to behold a
[1:27:57] messiah
[1:27:59] in a manger
[1:28:00] isn't that right
[1:28:01] hallelujah
[1:28:03] hallelujah
[1:28:07] yeah all right
[1:28:09] amen
[1:28:12] let me bring this out here now he said
[1:28:13] hey man let me bring this out
[1:28:15] paragraph 28 center notice not only that
[1:28:17] but the most unlikely place
[1:28:19] for such an event the shepherds now was
[1:28:22] the one who received the message
[1:28:23] and now notice where the message was in
[1:28:26] the most unlikely place that anyone
[1:28:28] would expect it to come
[1:28:30] he said and i wonder tonight
[1:28:32] if we were looking for the true message
[1:28:34] of the lord jesus
[1:28:35] he said i wonder if it would be in an
[1:28:37] unlikely group oh my a place that was
[1:28:40] that the great high cultured world
[1:28:43] and the church today would think was a
[1:28:45] bunch of of all heretics
[1:28:47] i wonder if that wouldn't be where we'd
[1:28:49] find him
[1:28:50] the most unlikely place and to the most
[1:28:52] unqualified speakers
[1:28:55] shepherds who know nothing about
[1:28:57] speaking only calling sheep
[1:28:59] oh hallelujah calling sheep hallelujah
[1:29:02] calling the names from out of the book
[1:29:04] preaching the word of god staying with
[1:29:06] that word staying with that word that's
[1:29:08] all the shepherds know how to do praise
[1:29:11] god they didn't know high intellectuals
[1:29:13] they don't know how to preach a mighty
[1:29:14] message amen they're right all he knows
[1:29:17] about the sheep all they're concerned
[1:29:19] about is the names that are on the book
[1:29:21] of life they have to come forth in their
[1:29:23] time and their hour in their season
[1:29:26] and god give them our heart to go after
[1:29:28] no sheep

[1:29:41] god and he'll fill you with the holy
[1:29:43] ghost he'll give you a house desire

[1:29:48] the desire of every living thing for he

[1:30:03] well maybe that's why i come
[1:30:04] he said but there was a promised word
[1:30:06] notice yes it could do that again
[1:30:08] it bypassed all the nobles of the land
[1:30:10] it bypassed all the nobles it was
[1:30:12] revealed to the nobodies

[1:31:42] god did it to make known to them the
[1:31:45] greatest message it ever was
[1:31:47] messiah is now on the earth he said what
[1:31:50] a wisdom could only come from god
[1:31:53] the pharisees didn't know it the
[1:31:55] sadducees didn't know it christ became a
[1:31:57] man 33 and a half years they still
[1:31:59] didn't know who he was and yet shepherds
[1:32:02] before he even come into his own
[1:32:03] ministry we had a revelation of who that
[1:32:06] little baby was of who that two-year-old
[1:32:09] child was they knew who he was
[1:32:11] praise god they had a revelation from
[1:32:13] god it was hidden from the pharisees and
[1:32:16] it was revealed to the meek to the lowly
[1:32:18] that's who he come to isn't that right
[1:32:21] the bible said he came unto his own and
[1:32:23] his own receive him not but if manny has
[1:32:25] received him to them give he power
[1:32:28] to become the sons of god

[1:32:33] receive power this morning
[1:32:35] same as somebody say man somebody you
[1:32:38] are predestinated to receive power
[1:32:41] if you have received christ in his
[1:32:42] fullness you shall receive power
[1:32:45] to become the sons of god
[1:32:47] amen to change even your nature we'll

[1:32:58] god who knows wisdom the bible said if
[1:33:00] not in my lack of wisdom let him ask god
[1:33:03] isn't that right all the wisdom and all
[1:33:05] the schooling and everything was now
[1:33:06] laid to waste
[1:33:08] and bypassed by great wisdom of by the
[1:33:12] great wisdom of god he said i keep
[1:33:13] repeating that because i want it to go
[1:33:16] down deep oh i love the prophet
[1:33:18] hallelujah hallelujah he won't let it
[1:33:20] rest he's driving it into you now

[1:33:35] isn't our right to the wisdom and the
[1:33:37] knowledge of god
[1:33:38] but my man david said the knowledge to
[1:33:40] me is too high i cannot attain it but he
[1:33:43] make it himself to the lowly holla isn't
[1:33:46] that right he repeated himself to babes
[1:33:48] such as would learn isn't that right is
[1:33:51] that the word
[1:33:52] oh hallelujah that's right he said i
[1:33:55] wanted to go down deep
[1:33:58] down deep all later waste no good
[1:34:01] it bypassed it all to let god's wisdom
[1:34:04] have the right way that god takes
[1:34:06] nothings to make some things
[1:34:09] oh hallelujah are you nothing in here
[1:34:10] this morning then he can make something

[1:34:40] never changes his posture he never
[1:34:42] changes his ways much he said i'm
[1:34:44] talking of the man of the world
[1:34:46] man is always praising god religious man
[1:34:49] for what he's done and always pointing
[1:34:51] the people to what he's going to do
[1:34:53] and then ignoring what he's doing

[1:35:05] according to the word right he said
[1:35:06] they're always praising god for what
[1:35:08] he's done saying what he will do and
[1:35:10] ignoring what he is doing that's just
[1:35:12] the habit of man oh don't you feel to
[1:35:14] see what god's doing today

[1:35:52] it's not a group thing
[1:35:54] i'm not talking about a group this
[1:35:55] morning
[1:35:56] i'm talking about these sheep a sheep
[1:35:58] one over here
[1:35:59] one over here the court could use come
[1:36:01] on now here's my spirit flowing freely
[1:36:03] here's my spirit phone freely every one
[1:36:06] of them god will find
[1:36:07] and bring them into the fold
[1:36:12] hallelujah isn't that right isn't that
[1:36:14] right isn't that right
[1:36:16] isn't that right
[1:36:17] but isaac brought him up beautifully
[1:36:19] last week talking about noah and the ark
[1:36:22] and he said when the call of god went
[1:36:23] out to the animals
[1:36:25] brother there was thousands of animals
[1:36:27] in that day
[1:36:28] thousands of elephants thousands of
[1:36:31] giraffes and lions and zebras and tigers
[1:36:33] and bears
[1:36:34] but that voice only went two of each
[1:36:37] kind
[1:36:40] there won't be much go in there
[1:36:43] it was only two of each kind
[1:36:45] might have been a thousand bears but
[1:36:46] only two bears made it
[1:36:48] only two g ross made it only two lions
[1:36:51] made it hallelujah is that a reflection
[1:36:53] of what's going on today
[1:36:55] hallelujah hallelujah brought bypass to
[1:36:57] multitudes and revealed to our little
[1:36:59] group
[1:37:00] our little people praise god individuals
[1:37:03] coming out
[1:37:04] coming out of the world pressing their
[1:37:06] way
[1:37:07] getting their inheritance getting their
[1:37:10] promise getting their holy ghost
[1:37:13] in that right
[1:37:14] your mother can't get the holy ghost for
[1:37:16] you you have got to get it for yourself
[1:37:19] your father can't get it for you
[1:37:22] your brother can't get it for you your
[1:37:23] wife nobody can get it for you you've
[1:37:26] got to go and get it yourself
[1:37:31] amen
[1:37:33] the onus is on you
[1:37:34] the responsibility is on you to make
[1:37:37] yourself ready
[1:37:38] for when the bridegroom comes isn't that
[1:37:40] right
[1:37:41] holla isn't that right
[1:37:43] jesus give a prophet parable it's not
[1:37:44] right about the ten versions five or
[1:37:46] wise fiber foolish the five wise virgins
[1:37:49] made themselves ready they took it upon
[1:37:51] themselves with a revelation that they
[1:37:53] receive to make themselves ready for his
[1:37:56] comment
[1:37:58] but sad to say there were five virgins
[1:37:59] who didn't make themselves ready
[1:38:03] and when the call was going out
[1:38:06] when the call went out
[1:38:08] those virgins realized their condition
[1:38:11] then
[1:38:13] but five were already prepared by doing
[1:38:15] what they had to do
[1:38:17] he said behold i come quickly my reward
[1:38:20] is with me to give every man according
[1:38:21] to his work
[1:38:23] and when that call went out
[1:38:26] come into the marriage of the lamb isn't
[1:38:28] that right
[1:38:29] jesus said five were caught with their
[1:38:31] work undone
[1:38:33] they went unto the ones that were wise
[1:38:35] and said give us of your oil
[1:38:37] we don't have any we don't have the holy
[1:38:39] ghost we don't have the signs we don't
[1:38:41] have the wonders we don't have what
[1:38:43] malachi 4 required
[1:38:45] is not right and the five wise said go
[1:38:48] unto them that
[1:38:49] the bible said while they went out to
[1:38:52] buy the pride pool came
[1:38:54] it was too late to go get it it was too
[1:38:57] late to apply the token it was too late
[1:38:59] to get the holy ghost it was too late to
[1:39:01] have the virtues it was too late to
[1:39:03] press their way
[1:39:05] they missed that call
[1:39:08] i'm sad to say
[1:39:10] there's gonna be a group that'll miss
[1:39:11] that call
[1:39:13] i'm afraid i have to say it it's the
[1:39:15] truth i hate to say it i wouldn't
[1:39:17] everyone be saved even the prophet said
[1:39:20] so but we don't know who's on the book
[1:39:21] god knows his sheep
[1:39:23] god knows who they are god knows who
[1:39:25] will press their way but there's a group
[1:39:27] that'll make it and there's a group that
[1:39:28] will not make it
[1:39:30] so you make up your mind this morning
[1:39:32] which group you want to be in
[1:39:35] shame and somebody
[1:39:36] there's a group that's supposed to go
[1:39:38] into the weeping and the wailing and the
[1:39:39] national teach isn't that right but
[1:39:42] there's also a group that's going to go
[1:39:44] into that place where they'll be
[1:39:45] shouting whether we praising whether
[1:39:47] they'll be glorifying god they'll be

[1:46:55] without a requirement for the sound for
[1:46:57] this day we're helpless
[1:46:59] hallelujah isn't that right that's just
[1:47:01] the nature of a sheep a sheep doesn't
[1:47:03] have sharp teeth
[1:47:05] isn't that right
[1:47:06] to attack people with it doesn't have a
[1:47:08] bad attitude
[1:47:09] it's the nature of the sheep
[1:47:11] they can take a sheep and put it in the
[1:47:13] house and pet it it'll just ban ban
[1:47:15] bleat on that's just the nature of a
[1:47:17] sheep he can't help himself he goes and
[1:47:19] he grazes where he grazes he goes
[1:47:21] wherever the shepherd tells him to go
[1:47:23] that's just the nature of the sheep the
[1:47:25] sheep is just built that way
[1:47:28] they're vulnerable
[1:47:29] they're pliable you could use them you
[1:47:31] could carry them you could place them
[1:47:33] you could put them you could get them to
[1:47:34] walk you can get them to sit down you
[1:47:36] can get them to lie down you can get
[1:47:38] them to do whatever they want that's
[1:47:39] just the nature of the sheep hallelujah
[1:47:42] but goats are different the goats want
[1:47:44] to do their own thing the ghosts want to
[1:47:46] kick up and get on wild and get on all
[1:47:48] wassy praise god they don't want to obey
[1:47:50] orders they want to obey instructions
[1:47:52] they don't want to obey leaders they
[1:47:53] want to be amen that's not right they
[1:47:54] don't want to do the things of god but
[1:47:56] the sheep oh they know his voice
[1:47:58] the sheep have a kind heart the sheep
[1:48:00] have a good and honest heart oh the
[1:48:02] sheep love the lord the sheep love the
[1:48:05] word the sheep love to wake up on a
[1:48:07] sunday morning and to give a smile on
[1:48:10] their face
[1:48:11] this sheep go through testing and hard
[1:48:13] trial and after all of that the sheep
[1:48:16] get happy the sheep get the smile and
[1:48:18] the sheep get the praise in god when
[1:48:20] they think of the goodness of jesus and
[1:48:22] all that he's done for them only the
[1:48:25] sheep can forgive only the sheep can
[1:48:27] repent only the sheep can make things
[1:48:29] right that's the nature of a sheep
[1:48:33] hallelujah oh thank god for the sheep
[1:48:36] this morning
[1:48:37] oh hallelujah praise god
[1:48:41] amen amen hallelujah
[1:48:44] amen
[1:48:45] praise god
[1:48:47] my sheep is perfectly helpless
[1:48:50] he cannot go by himself
[1:48:52] that's the reason that god likened his
[1:48:55] believing children onto she
[1:48:57] they have got to be guided
[1:48:59] but watch what's guiding you here's a
[1:49:00] prophet it was a warning he said watch
[1:49:02] what's guiding you he said don't get a
[1:49:04] goat
[1:49:05] he'll walk you to the slaughter pen
[1:49:08] god never gave us a goat he gave us his
[1:49:10] son the holy spirit to guide us oh who's
[1:49:13] the good shepherd the holy spirit amen
[1:49:16] he is our god not some man-made hurts
[1:49:18] man but god's given god-given herdsmen
[1:49:21] oh filler the baptism already goes isn't
[1:49:23] that right who feed the sheep upon shifu
[1:49:26] amen hallelujah he said now you take a
[1:49:28] pig
[1:49:29] and you say to this pig yes he brings it
[1:49:31] out here i love this story he said you
[1:49:33] take a pig and you say to this pig i'm
[1:49:35] going to make you a lamb
[1:49:37] and you wash him
[1:49:39] you paint his toenails and so forth give
[1:49:41] him food like a sheep
[1:49:44] give him some kind of a diet
[1:49:46] put him out on the floor where the sheep
[1:49:48] heard
[1:49:49] in the alfalfa fields or something
[1:49:51] and if there's a mud hole anywhere that
[1:49:54] hog will just go straight into the
[1:49:55] murder
[1:49:56] as soon as he can go see why
[1:50:00] because his nature is still a hug
[1:50:02] isn't that right
[1:50:04] oh hallelujah hallelujah it can't be
[1:50:06] painted up
[1:50:07] it can be put on it's got to be real
[1:50:11] say amen somebody
[1:50:12] your nature has got to be changed
[1:50:16] hallelujah
[1:50:18] the people of israel came out of egypt
[1:50:20] but egypt was still in there
[1:50:22] the whole desire of god to go through
[1:50:24] the wilderness for all those years was
[1:50:26] to get the willingness um to get egypt
[1:50:29] out of the people
[1:50:31] isn't that right to try them and test
[1:50:33] them and to purge egypt out to them
[1:50:35] until they could forget what the files
[1:50:37] styles and the fashion look like until
[1:50:39] he could forget what the sphinx and his
[1:50:40] pyramids look like until he could forget
[1:50:42] all of that
[1:50:44] and still
[1:50:45] they had a goat-like attitude we cannot
[1:50:47] cross over and they chose to believe or
[1:50:49] even report amen but caleb and joshua
[1:50:52] had another spirit with them
[1:50:53] they had another nature with them
[1:50:55] they could do nothing but believe the
[1:50:57] world they could do nothing but believe
[1:50:59] the promise they could do nothing but be
[1:51:01] sheep in god's pastures
[1:51:04] oh hallelujah when they tasted those
[1:51:06] grapes when they started drinking milk
[1:51:08] and honey brother they began to jump
[1:51:10] they began to bleed they began to bow
[1:51:12] all over the place praise god they were
[1:51:14] like sheep jumping up and down oh
[1:51:17] hallelujah this is the promised land
[1:51:19] this is the promised land
[1:51:22] hallelujah
[1:51:24] when they came back to the camp they
[1:51:26] meet a bunch of goats putting one
[1:51:28] another quarreling with one another
[1:51:30] confusing one another this game is
[1:51:31] interpretation that interpretation this
[1:51:34] is a giant that is a giant all in here
[1:51:36] in this giant bunch of good revelations
[1:51:38] but these two brothers come out like
[1:51:40] sheep of his pasture saying we are well
[1:51:42] able to go into the land and possess the
[1:51:45] land
[1:51:46] it's our land it's a green pasture
[1:51:49] there are still waters
[1:51:51] oh hallelujah praise god
[1:51:55] oh hallelujah
[1:51:59] so god
[1:52:01] had to kill out all the goats
[1:52:04] two and a half million of them come out
[1:52:06] oh hallelujah but somehow they just
[1:52:08] didn't receive that that that
[1:52:10] uh trying and testing time amen isn't
[1:52:12] that right
[1:52:14] 40 days in the wilderness it's not right
[1:52:15] oh my
[1:52:17] something else here okay so now
[1:52:20] uh
[1:52:21] where am i at here amen so they got to
[1:52:23] be guided see god never gives us a good
[1:52:24] all right see
[1:52:26] okay we're talking about the hog isn't
[1:52:28] that right amen said if there's a mud
[1:52:29] hole anywhere that hog will just go
[1:52:31] straight to that mud hole as he can go
[1:52:33] see why because his nature is still a
[1:52:36] hog and he said that's the reason that
[1:52:38] church members today
[1:52:40] indulge in the things of the world see
[1:52:43] it's because their nature hasn't been
[1:52:45] changed
[1:52:47] say man somebody
[1:52:48] they'll eat any kind of ecclesiastical
[1:52:52] theological slop
[1:52:55] that's not skim milk brother
[1:52:57] but the word of god they can't stand it
[1:53:00] they'll go in and listen to the world
[1:53:02] isn't that right they'll eat any kind of
[1:53:04] a thing isn't that right but the sheep
[1:53:06] of god they know his voice the sheep of
[1:53:08] god have a different nature hallelujah
[1:53:10] isn't that right he said you know the
[1:53:12] biggest hypocrite in the world is an old
[1:53:13] crow
[1:53:14] he said in the bible there were two that
[1:53:15] were left out of the ark oh come back to
[1:53:17] the alberta isaac amen the old crow went
[1:53:19] out and he never did return but because
[1:53:22] he's a vulture and a scavenger
[1:53:24] he sat on the bodies of dead carcasses
[1:53:26] fill his belly with dead carcasses but
[1:53:28] when he turned the dove out talking
[1:53:30] about noah the dove could not stand that
[1:53:33] stench
[1:53:34] so he returned back to the father's
[1:53:35] house i know and beat at the door until
[1:53:38] noah let him back in
[1:53:40] oh my see different nature
[1:53:43] different behavior praise god
[1:53:45] isn't that right
[1:53:47] he said now a crow can sit out there and
[1:53:50] eat on a dead horse all day and fly out
[1:53:53] there in the field and eat grain with
[1:53:55] the dove
[1:53:57] he's kind of too full
[1:53:58] he said but the seed but the dove
[1:54:00] doesn't have any gall
[1:54:02] he can't digest it and when any dove of
[1:54:05] god
[1:54:06] here is any word eating dove or sheep i
[1:54:09] love that terminology amen a word eating
[1:54:11] dove amen a clean beast when you go to
[1:54:14] give them the things of the world they
[1:54:16] know their master said he that loved the
[1:54:17] world of the things of the world the
[1:54:18] love of god is not even in him he said
[1:54:20] you give him something contrary to that
[1:54:22] word of god he cannot stand it he said
[1:54:25] but the devil can take that and the
[1:54:26] world too and call it all god but you
[1:54:29] can't mix oil and water he said it just
[1:54:31] won't mix
[1:54:32] hallelujah praise god hallelujah there's
[1:54:34] something in you that responds to the
[1:54:36] word of god oh you can't respond to the
[1:54:38] things out there something inside of you

[2:08:59] ezekiel was a prophet and he said a new
[2:09:01] heart i'll give you hey like i like it
[2:09:03] he said always god speaks of something
[2:09:05] new that he's going to do
[2:09:06] he didn't say that he'll just patch up
[2:09:08] an old condition
[2:09:10] no he said a new heart i'll give you
[2:09:12] i'll take away the stony heart that you
[2:09:14] have and a new spirit i'll give you he
[2:09:17] never said i'll give you a facelift call

[2:09:22] gonna have a new thing
[2:09:24] a brand new in doing this in you
[2:09:27] hallelujah pray amen isn't that right he
[2:09:29] said you can't mix the old intellectual
[2:09:31] church with some new pentecostal
[2:09:33] experience hallelujah he said jesus
[2:09:35] taught the same thing he said you can't
[2:09:37] put new wine in old bottles
[2:09:39] he said that was hard for me to
[2:09:40] understand before became a missionary
[2:09:43] but i saw what bottles was and they
[2:09:44] began to explain that the bottles were
[2:09:46] wine skits isn't that right that was
[2:09:48] sewn together hallelujah and they had to
[2:09:50] put oil in them wine skins and make it
[2:09:53] soft isn't that right then you could put
[2:09:55] the new wine into that old bottle he
[2:09:58] said he could put water into an old
[2:10:00] bottle he said that's all right but he
[2:10:02] said wine has a life in it
[2:10:05] wine moves
[2:10:07] wine jumps
[2:10:09] wine bubbles
[2:10:11] wine ferments
[2:10:12] wine gets to twisting and jumping
[2:10:15] wine has a life in it
[2:10:17] wine tumbles while grind grows inside of
[2:10:21] you
[2:10:22] wine changes from one thing
[2:10:24] entirely to another
[2:10:29] and god is not gonna take his wine his
[2:10:31] new wife and pour it into those old
[2:10:33] bottles no no no he's got to give you a
[2:10:35] new bottle
[2:10:36] how many want a new bottle this morning
[2:10:41] you can begin this time
[2:10:43] let it rain let it rain go into it
[2:10:44] please
[2:10:46] oh hallelujah
[2:10:48] how many won new bottles this morning
[2:10:50] how many want new bottles this morning
[2:10:53] the holy spirit is here to give you a
[2:10:55] new bottle
[2:10:56] of an oil and that old wine skin
[2:10:59] and to get it all softened up
[2:11:01] oh hallelujah to get it pliable so that
[2:11:04] it can take the form of that new eye so
[2:11:07] they can stretch to fit that new wine
[2:11:11] hallelujah
[2:11:13] hallelujah
[2:11:14] hallelujah
[2:11:32] isn't that right
[2:11:34] it's not right but a stupid get ready to
[2:11:36] come
[2:11:41] he said now you may be able to put water
[2:11:42] in an old bottle keep humming now keep
[2:11:44] worshiping now
[2:11:46] he said but you can't put wine into an
[2:11:48] old bottle
[2:11:49] he said because water is the ashes of
[2:11:51] hydrogen and oxygen and oxygen remains
[2:11:54] if anything dwindles away it shrinks it
[2:11:56] has its substance but it has no life
[2:11:58] isn't that right he said but wine has a
[2:12:00] life in it
[2:12:01] a new wine new wine especially it's
[2:12:03] fermenting and it might spread out a
[2:12:05] little
[2:12:06] if it pushes that old bottle in the old
[2:12:08] hide will burst and fly open
[2:12:10] he said now he said then that hide is
[2:12:12] ruined and the bottle's ruined he said a
[2:12:14] bottle is ruined and a wine is spilled
[2:12:16] now that's about the picture we have
[2:12:17] before us today
[2:12:18] you can come to an old former bunch of
[2:12:20] intellectuals with your ideas and try to
[2:12:23] adopt god's program in your intellectual
[2:12:25] program it just won't work
[2:12:27] he said that old dry cowhide will just
[2:12:30] blow up he said it can't take it he said
[2:12:32] but now a new bottle
[2:12:34] he said a new bottle is a tanned high a
[2:12:37] new tan high and a new tan high has
[2:12:40] still the animal oil in that high and
[2:12:42] when a new wine goes into that new
[2:12:44] bottle then when the new iron goes in it
[2:12:46] begins to swell the new bottle begins to
[2:12:49] give
[2:12:50] it pushes out because it's got oil in it
[2:12:53] and if there ever was a time the prophet
[2:12:55] said that the church needs an oiling
[2:12:57] today he said it is today
[2:13:00] he said the holy spirit
[2:13:02] is the oil he said it is the new wine
[2:13:07] oh get a lot of shot of praise
[2:13:10] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:13:13] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh

[2:13:44] revamp something he's going to remake
[2:13:46] something he takes a bulldozer and he
[2:13:48] just plows the whole thing out
[2:13:49] he turns the whole thing over he said
[2:13:51] when the devil come to see what he could
[2:13:53] find in there he said there's nothing
[2:13:55] say there's a new house
[2:13:56] and the greatest thing is that he moves
[2:13:58] in to that new house and he lives in
[2:14:00] there and he dwells in there and he
[2:14:02] shows you how to walk and he shows you
[2:14:04] how to talk and he shows you how to live
[2:14:07] is that the kind of life you want this
