[13:37] lord that we could gather in this way
[13:40] lord at the beginning of this new year
[13:43] 2021
[13:45] law we thank you for your love for your
[13:47] grace for your mercy to us
[13:50] lord we did not know a year ago
[13:53] that this is what have been how our our
[13:57] lives
[13:57] would have unfolded lord for 2020 and to
[14:01] see
[14:01] 20 21 lord is just unfolding
[14:04] and unfolding and unfolding and to see
[14:06] scripture being fulfilled and
[14:09] lord there's very little that could come
[14:11] to as a surprise
[14:12] us lord because father all of what is
[14:15] unfolding has been
[14:16] prophesied it's been spoken lord and we
[14:19] thank you
[14:19] lord that we have had the foresight
[14:22] through your word the insight
[14:23] through your word the understanding
[14:25] through your word lord to stand in such
[14:27] a time as this so lord as we
[14:30] lord start back these bible studies and
[14:32] these conversations
[14:33] around scripture and around your word
[14:36] lord we commit to these sessions and
[14:38] lord this one in particular as we start
[14:40] into your hands lord and
[14:42] we pray your bless us in a special way
[14:44] may you bless everyone that
[14:46] made the effort to be here tonight
[14:48] against
[14:49] all kinds of odds and challenges and
[14:51] responsibilities and different
[14:53] commitments and
[14:54] different stresses and struggles lord we
[14:57] are reporting the duty tonight so we
[14:59] commit this session into your hands we
[15:01] pray a special blessing on your people
[15:03] father there are so many situations i'm
[15:05] sure
[15:06] different ones are going through that
[15:08] they may not even share they may not
[15:09] even express
[15:11] they may not have the opportunity to
[15:12] confide in anyone and they bear
[15:15] lord the the weight of these burdens
[15:17] lord but you said in your word you'd
[15:19] never give us
[15:20] more than we could bear so lord we pray
[15:22] that god that you would strengthen our
[15:24] shoulders strengthen our minds
[15:26] strengthen our hearts lord as you said
[15:28] to peter father i prayed for you that
[15:30] your faith would feel not so father we
[15:32] come tonight
[15:33] for a strengthening of our faith for our
[15:36] lord our commitment and our zeal for
[15:38] your word and the things of god to be
[15:40] renewed lord and
[15:41] lord to shake lord shake away everything
[15:45] lord that is not of youth that would
[15:46] distract us that would take away our
[15:48] focus lord there's so much just
[15:50] happening around us that it's so easy to
[15:52] get distracted so father
[15:54] we want to take this space for the next
[15:56] few minutes
[15:57] lord to lord to remind ourselves of your
[16:00] goodness of your mercy
[16:01] lord of your presence of your power of
[16:03] your grace lord and
[16:04] also of your judgment lord and what's
[16:07] coming to this world
[16:08] that we want to look at our own lives to
[16:10] see how we line up with the world we
[16:12] want to
[16:13] look at our own lives and compare it
[16:15] lord because it's there the word is
[16:16] clear
[16:17] of how we should live how we should act
[16:19] how we should behave ourselves lord it's
[16:21] it's all
[16:22] through the scriptures from genesis to
[16:24] revelation it's all about producing a
[16:26] life lord
[16:27] father the same signs the same wonders
[16:30] the same
[16:31] attitude the law to replicate the same
[16:33] conditions that the promise
[16:35] of the holy ghost is just as real lord
[16:37] and lord this may be a bible study
[16:39] tonight but lord may
[16:40] conviction grip the hearts of those that
[16:43] need to be convicted
[16:44] lord for those that need to be more
[16:46] sincere may the word
[16:47] lord be shared in such a way that they
[16:49] would be more sincere those that have
[16:51] lost their
[16:52] zeal to hunger and to this after
[16:54] righteousness lord made the hunger and
[16:55] the this be built up tonight
[16:57] those that maybe desire in the holy
[16:59] ghost father lord may they be filled and
[17:01] may the desire
[17:03] be stronger than ever if there's a
[17:04] backslider in our midst tonight father
[17:07] lord may it be completely restored if
[17:09] there's someone who doesn't know you
[17:10] tonight may they come to know you by
[17:12] revelation and by experience father
[17:15] lord may you remind us all that you are
[17:17] the same yesterday
[17:18] today and forever so may you bless our
[17:20] efforts tonight and
[17:21] we commit the service over to you in the
[17:23] precious name of jesus christ
[17:24] amen and amen and amen well it's
[17:27] certainly
[17:28] a great privilege and an honor to be
[17:30] back in school
[17:32] uh again in these little bible study
[17:34] sessions
[17:35] uh to see how god has been so good to us
[17:38] to unfold his word
[17:40] uh and to show us through the scriptures
[17:42] and
[17:43] it is it is the inexhaustible fountain
[17:46] it it there's so much in there that that
[17:48] there's always something that you could
[17:50] find in scripture
[17:51] to encourage you to to keep you focused
[17:54] to lift your spirits to to help you to
[17:58] stay
[17:58] pointed at the right direction to lift
[18:00] your head up even though you might feel
[18:02] down at times and to
[18:03] see 20 21 so quickly come and you know
[18:07] i i you know the pastor allows me to
[18:09] preach
[18:10] uh the two sundays of this year thus far
[18:13] and uh you know the burden
[18:14] that i would have had and to see how all
[18:17] these things are unfolding before us
[18:19] in the natural and in the spiritual
[18:22] and to see that god is good you know we
[18:25] started this year talking about
[18:26] giving thanks and and being thankful uh
[18:30] for the trials thankful for the
[18:31] blessings thankful for everything
[18:33] because in everything
[18:34] the bible tells us to give thanks so we
[18:36] are thankful tonight
[18:37] that we could have another opportunity
[18:39] to have a conversation around the word
[18:41] of god
[18:42] and like i've always said bible studies
[18:44] is not really
[18:45] us preaching but it's really taking
[18:47] scripture and by the grace of god
[18:50] you know and by the leadership of the
[18:51] holy spirit rightly dividing the word
[18:54] that we could know how to live better
[18:56] how to act better and that we wouldn't
[18:58] be caught surprised because we would be
[18:59] prepared
[19:00] because the scripture comes for us to be
[19:02] prepared you know that we wouldn't be
[19:04] caught unawares
[19:05] you know and and the the challenge of
[19:08] today for us
[19:09] is the fact that if it's in the word and
[19:11] it's written and it's revealed
[19:12] so catch that here written and revealed
[19:15] then we have no excuses
[19:17] then then these these things that are
[19:19] written and revealed
[19:20] that are for us because the bible tells
[19:22] us those things which are revealed
[19:24] they belong to us you know and and when
[19:26] you talk about what belongs to you
[19:28] sometimes you don't
[19:29] see it as the word actually belongs to
[19:31] you but it really is yours and if you
[19:33] understand it is yours the same way
[19:35] you see well your car is yours or or
[19:37] something is yours and
[19:38] and because it's yours you use it a
[19:40] certain way when you
[19:42] catch in your heart that the promises of
[19:44] god
[19:45] are yours and what is revealed to us are
[19:47] yours and it is
[19:49] yours not for it to be declared that it
[19:51] is yours but it's yours to put to use
[19:54] it is yours to be effective in your life
[19:56] it is yours
[19:58] for your benefit i want us to catch that
[20:00] it is for our benefit
[20:01] because god did what he did for our
[20:04] benefit
[20:04] healing is for our benefit deliverance
[20:07] is for our benefit
[20:08] you know being having a good night's
[20:10] sleep is for our benefit
[20:12] you know the trials are for our benefit
[20:15] the testings are for our benefit
[20:17] so we want to see it as an and it is
[20:20] somewhat of a paradigm shift
[20:22] you know and i always say i i look for
[20:24] the practical
[20:25] side of this thing because i've seen so
[20:27] many people
[20:28] no scripture no quotes no mysteries but
[20:31] the practical application of
[20:33] life and seeing when you're reading
[20:35] newspaper you know putting on your
[20:37] spiritual glasses
[20:38] and now reading behind the headline
[20:40] reading behind the article
[20:42] and seeing that there's a spiritual
[20:44] world that is trying to
[20:45] to take control of everything that's
[20:47] around and has taken control in
[20:49] in this world led by the god of this
[20:51] evil age but we also understand that
[20:53] what where our role is and what our part
[20:56] to play is
[20:57] as a resistance to the enemy knowing
[20:59] that we have a work we have a ministry
[21:02] and our families are depending on us our
[21:04] loved ones are depending on us
[21:06] people are looking at us and they are
[21:08] perplexed they are confused they are
[21:10] wondering
[21:10] how in the midst of what is happening
[21:12] you could still stay positive
[21:14] i'm not saying you don't have days when
[21:16] you're you feel the true any towel and
[21:17] you don't have days when you're like oh
[21:19] gosh i don't know how much more can take
[21:20] and i have days where you feel
[21:22] frustrated
[21:23] we all have those days they all have
[21:25] experiences
[21:26] where oh boy it it feels like too much
[21:29] but something keeps holding us something
[21:32] keeps
[21:32] guiding us something keeps pushing us
[21:34] into our destiny
[21:36] and that is what the power of
[21:37] predestination is your destination is
[21:40] determined before
[21:41] you even knew you were gonna get there
[21:43] so we are here tonight one more time
[21:45] and god already knew we would be in this
[21:46] room tonight and that is something to be
[21:48] thankful for
[21:50] because he orchestrated this to be this
[21:52] way so we thank god
[21:54] for this and and before i go any further
[21:56] um last night or so
[21:58] um but i'm moving would have notified
[22:00] the ministry
[22:01] elders and deacons and the church
[22:03] leadership that brother rupert wasn't
[22:05] feeling too well
[22:06] and um getting some pains in his head
[22:08] and and some stroke-like symptoms
[22:11] and um throughout the leadership we we
[22:13] went into prayer
[22:14] and we have a note of praise tonight
[22:17] from brother rupert nigeria i'm thankful
[22:18] to god for his healing touch
[22:20] last night after being prayed for i had
[22:22] great relief from the pain i was
[22:24] experiencing on the left side of my
[22:26] head i'm also thankful to the brothers
[22:28] for lifting me up in prayer
[22:30] so before i go even further i just want
[22:32] to pray for him
[22:34] one more time also and pray for any
[22:36] person who
[22:37] is not feeling well tonight you may be
[22:39] going through some pain in your body
[22:41] uh some sickness whatever it is this is
[22:43] this is a call to prayer for healing
[22:45] because the enemy will try to attack
[22:48] your body

[25:31] young people
[25:32] our burden for the younger in fate
[25:35] uh who um you know may not have the
[25:38] length of time
[25:40] that some of us may do in the message
[25:42] and then also i was sharing with baru
[25:43] with some time ago
[25:44] you know sometimes you know i remember
[25:47] when i think i was about 12 years old
[25:49] or so when i read the church ages
[25:52] and i think now to 12 year olds
[25:56] and i'm not sure how many 12 year olds
[25:58] you know
[25:59] are motivated to read
[26:02] the church ages you know so i don't want
[26:05] to take it for granted
[26:07] and um so i want to you know i told you
[26:10] whatever i was i was heading into the
[26:11] book of revelation because i believe i
[26:12] want to
[26:13] spend some time there with the church um
[26:16] with the young with the old with those
[26:18] who have heard it before
[26:19] as a reminder as an encouragement and
[26:21] for those who may not have spent the
[26:23] time that you should spend
[26:25] you know in studying and reading um
[26:27] because it is there for a purpose
[26:29] all scripture has a purpose you know and
[26:32] very random taught us so many things you
[26:34] know read from genesis to revelation
[26:36] if you don't see jesus through the bible
[26:37] go read it again because it's all about
[26:39] him it's all about his his nature his
[26:41] being his attributes
[26:42] and how he's trying to get that life to
[26:45] reflected in us
[26:46] and also deal with the works of darkness
[26:48] you know and i've had a burden
[26:50] to identify that that that that that
[26:53] that force of darkness and
[26:54] principalities and powers and these
[26:56] things so that we could be prepared so
[26:59] when it comes to us we would not be
[27:00] surprised and we know how to treat it
[27:02] and how to deal with it you know
[27:03] so by the grace of god if i were to have
[27:06] a title for this study tonight and i
[27:09] don't intend to be too long
[27:11] because i will call this the
[27:12] introductory class um because for
[27:14] students of scripture and the word
[27:16] there's no way we could take the book of
[27:18] revelation in one session
[27:20] and i am not going to make um
[27:23] statements like i made last year last
[27:25] year i you know i said i was going to
[27:27] continue certain things and it's on my
[27:29] heart to continue but
[27:30] the lord has a way he does take us down
[27:32] different roads so i don't want to see
[27:34] when part two will be or when part three
[27:36] will be it will be when the lord wants
[27:37] it to be
[27:38] but i do know it will be impossible for
[27:40] us to get into all that we want to get
[27:42] to do tonight
[27:43] but this by the grace of god tonight i
[27:46] want to call it
[27:47] a study of the book of revelation part
[27:50] one
[27:51] you know and we will see by the grace of
[27:53] god how many parts we get into
[27:55] um by the grace of god so if you have
[27:57] your bibles
[27:59] you could join me in the last book of
[28:02] the bible the book of revelation it's a
[28:04] powerful book it's a book
[28:06] of symbols it's a book of symbology
[28:09] some people love it some people run from
[28:10] it some people because it appears to be
[28:13] a lot of different things they don't
[28:15] know what it means and they just kind of
[28:16] leave it there
[28:17] but india is our story in the story of
[28:20] redemption and there's the story of the
[28:22] devil
[28:23] getting destroyed and there's a lot of
[28:24] things and brother branham
[28:26] you know what i've said there are two
[28:27] books in the bible that the devil hates
[28:30] you know hate is a strong word he hates
[28:32] the book of genesis
[28:34] and he hates the book of revelation so i
[28:36] believe as believers it is important for
[28:39] us
[28:39] to be fully rooted and grounded in the
[28:41] book of revelation
[28:43] and buddha branham would have
[28:44] extensively covered so many of these
[28:46] things
[28:47] that i cannot do justice to what the
[28:49] prophet would have done
[28:51] but by the grace of god in one humble
[28:53] way we're going to try to just take a
[28:55] few points here and there
[28:57] and keep digging and digging and digging
[28:59] until something breaks because something
[29:00] has to break friends
[29:02] you know all of this whole message and
[29:03] this whole this whole plan of god
[29:06] and the prophet and the reason he came
[29:08] is for someone to break up on us for us
[29:09] to leave here
[29:10] we have to leave here with power we have
[29:11] to leave here victorious we have to
[29:12] leave here as overcomers
[29:14] i think i preached it two sundays ago
[29:16] we're not leaving here barely making it
[29:18] we are leaving here as overcomers the
[29:19] bible says and it's repeated in the book
[29:21] of revelations many times to him that
[29:23] overcome it
[29:24] overcoming is a it's a powerful place to
[29:26] be as a believer
[29:27] as a believer your position is as
[29:29] overcomer you know so so we're not
[29:31] talking about halfway making it we're
[29:33] gonna talk about wondering if you're
[29:34] going to make it
[29:35] you have to get the tools to make it you
[29:38] have to get the
[29:38] training to make it if you're
[29:40] approaching a job and you want to be
[29:42] successful at a job it is extremely
[29:44] frustrating
[29:46] when you don't know what to do you don't
[29:48] have the guidance you have the equipment
[29:49] you know the people who at the job and
[29:51] the computer are working and they say
[29:52] working on that they're working
[29:54] and it's impossible for you to perform
[29:55] at your best if your computer is not
[29:57] working
[29:58] and the the lights are working and you
[30:00] know where they tell you where you're
[30:00] really supposed to be doing and you're
[30:02] not sure
[30:03] what your your role is and they're
[30:04] trying to make the best of it
[30:06] and for the most part i was sharing with
[30:08] somebody recently most people in their
[30:10] jobs
[30:11] people are going to work to feel enough
[30:14] people don't go to work to be a failure
[30:16] in the work
[30:18] people go to work trying their very best
[30:20] even if you're a halfway worker and you
[30:23] just want to get your paycheck you still
[30:24] want at least
[30:25] people to say well you you okay
[30:29] but you are severely crippled if your
[30:31] computer car boot up
[30:33] if your calculator not working and your
[30:34] job is to calculate things
[30:36] no matter how good you might be if your
[30:38] tools not in position for you to succeed
[30:41] you're not going to succeed and the
[30:43] reality is the word of god
[30:45] is is to equip us so we read in
[30:47] ephesians put on the old armor of god
[30:49] this is this is equipping this is tools
[30:51] this is this is the gear you need to
[30:53] fight
[30:54] you know this is this is what you need
[30:55] to take the battle to the enemy
[30:57] and to take a family from the enemy and
[30:59] to get your joy back and to go
[31:01] and into the enemy's camp and take back
[31:03] what the devil stole from
[31:05] you and to stool and sold from your
[31:07] family amen
[31:09] so the book of revelation you're going
[31:10] to start in revelation 1
[31:13] from verse 1 and
[31:17] but the banner made it clear that this
[31:19] is not the revelation
[31:21] of of john but it is it is a revelation
[31:24] of jesus christ and that
[31:25] this is the only book if you read in the
[31:28] revelation of jesus christ any church
[31:30] jesus brother branham said this is
[31:31] this is the only book in the entire
[31:34] bible
[31:35] that is written by jesus himself
[31:38] appearing personally through a scribe
[31:41] so john is writing on behalf of jesus
[31:44] so this is the only book this is so this
[31:46] is a really really special book
[31:48] and because it is is that kind of a
[31:51] special book it is written in symbols
[31:53] and by the branham told us why it is
[31:54] written in symbols he said so that it
[31:56] would bypass the eyes of the wise and
[31:58] the prudent
[31:59] so so you have theologians for years you
[32:01] know how many documentaries
[32:03] and books that have on the book of
[32:04] revelation that way way way off
[32:06] for centuries people try to figure this
[32:07] thing out and that's why we have to be
[32:09] so thankful
[32:10] for the ministry of malachi 4 the
[32:12] ministry of
[32:13] of of revelation 10 7 the ministry of
[32:16] saint luke 17 30 the ministry
[32:18] of this great elijah messenger of
[32:20] malachi 4 william branham
[32:22] who could shine light and give us real
[32:24] clarity
[32:25] on what everything means so we are not
[32:27] guessing we're not wondering we're not
[32:28] trying to put pieces together
[32:30] but we understand what it is so by the
[32:31] grace of the god we want to take
[32:33] some verses in here and we'll see how
[32:35] far we we we're going to go and if the
[32:37] lord wills
[32:38] we'll continue in future sessions so
[32:42] the book of revelation 1 1 starts with
[32:44] the revelation of jesus christ and right
[32:47] there alone
[32:48] is is pause right there because brother
[32:51] branham
[32:51] spend length talking about the power of
[32:53] revelation and the
[32:54] revelation of jesus christ and the
[32:57] church is
[32:57] built on revelation and you would have
[32:59] referenced matthew 16 who do men say
[33:02] that i am
[33:02] these things we know or we should know
[33:05] but by the brandon was making a
[33:06] statement of we cannot underestimate
[33:08] the importance of revelation you know he
[33:11] said
[33:12] and and i want to kind of quote a couple
[33:14] of things from the prophet he said
[33:15] the importance of a revelation by the
[33:18] spirit
[33:18] to a true believer can never be over
[33:21] emphasized
[33:22] so but abandoned was also typed in that
[33:24] when this book of revelation
[33:26] was being written that john was in the
[33:30] spirit
[33:30] and the only way you could process this
[33:33] book of revelation
[33:34] is you also have to be in the spirit so
[33:36] while we could read and we could pull
[33:38] verses and we can understand what things
[33:40] mean
[33:40] i want us to be very careful because
[33:42] this book is not like other books of the
[33:44] bible
[33:45] so when we're approaching this this is a
[33:48] whole different thing here right
[33:49] so the revelation of jesus christ which
[33:52] god gave
[33:52] unto him to show unto his servants
[33:57] things which must shortly come to pass
[34:00] and he sent and signify it by his angel
[34:04] unto his servant john that's the first
[34:06] verse powerful verse
[34:08] now in the amplified i want to read it
[34:10] in the amplified because the amplified
[34:12] picks up a few things
[34:13] it highlights a few things that i want
[34:15] us to catch because
[34:17] the book of revelation as you know goes
[34:19] all the way to
[34:20] uh to to the spirit and he brides it
[34:22] come and it goes all the way and deal
[34:24] with the beast
[34:25] and he vials and he plagues and he wars
[34:27] and the bottomless pit and
[34:29] there's a lot and we're going to touch
[34:30] on many of these things as we help the
[34:32] in particularly younger believers and
[34:34] the young people understand these things
[34:36] right
[34:36] so in the father said this is the
[34:39] revelation of jesus christ
[34:41] and the amplified said his unveiling of
[34:44] the divine mysteries
[34:46] so i think this is significant because
[34:49] this is the unveiling
[34:51] of the divine mysteries and by the
[34:53] branham use the same reference
[34:55] of the unveiling or the uncovering or
[34:58] the revealing
[34:59] of what was previously hidden he said
[35:01] now the uncovering is not only the
[35:03] revelation
[35:04] of the person of christ but it is the
[35:06] revelation
[35:07] of his future works in the oncoming
[35:10] seven church ages so in other words as
[35:13] jesus is bringing this message through
[35:16] john
[35:17] this book of revelation is really the
[35:19] whole story of what is to unfold
[35:21] so this is why when we preach in the
[35:23] pulpit of these things unfolding now
[35:26] have already been prophesied they have
[35:27] only already been written
[35:29] if you don't have one spiritual eyes and
[35:31] understand where we're getting it from
[35:33] you will look and you're living in this
[35:34] world thinking it's normal but the
[35:36] reality is there's nothing new under the
[35:38] sun
[35:38] and everything that is happening has a
[35:40] place in scripture
[35:42] so when you can identify it in scripture
[35:44] and now have a
[35:45] true revelation of the ground you're
[35:47] standing on then nobody could confuse
[35:49] you
[35:49] nobody could deceive you nobody could
[35:51] say something to you that throw you off
[35:53] and you can't believe anymore and you're
[35:55] feeling to backslide and they don't know
[35:56] where you're standing and these things
[35:58] now become
[35:59] become it's foolishness to you because
[36:01] you are grounded by
[36:03] revelation not just any revelation but
[36:05] the revelation of jesus christ
[36:07] so i just want to continue with here
[36:08] this is your revelation i'm in the
[36:10] amplified still on
[36:11] on verse one of jesus christ his
[36:14] unveiling
[36:15] so he is the one doing the unveiling his
[36:17] unveiling
[36:18] of the divine mysteries which god the
[36:20] father gave to him
[36:22] to show to his bond servants which is
[36:25] what the believers
[36:26] are the things which must soon take
[36:29] place
[36:30] in their entirety and he sent
[36:33] and communicated it by his angel divine
[36:36] messenger
[36:37] to his bond servant john all right now
[36:40] let's go into verse two king james
[36:43] vision who bear record of the word of
[36:46] god
[36:46] and of the testimony of jesus christ of
[36:49] all
[36:50] things that he saw so john
[36:53] is communicating in this book everything
[36:56] that he saw
[36:57] all right so this is foundational
[36:59] everybody should have an understanding
[37:00] of this
[37:01] now let's start a bill and see how god
[37:03] even layers promises
[37:05] in this thing blessed verse three
[37:08] blessed
[37:10] now hold on before i go to victory i
[37:12] want to touch
[37:13] and i like touching the amplified
[37:14] because the amplified give some body to
[37:16] this thing right
[37:18] speaking about john who testified and
[37:20] gave supporting evidence
[37:22] this is how the amplifier says
[37:23] supporting evidence to the word of god
[37:26] and to the testimony of jesus christ
[37:28] even to everything that he saw in his
[37:30] visions
[37:31] and now verse 3 blessed is he and read
[37:34] it
[37:35] so the fact tonight that you read in
[37:37] this has a blessing
[37:39] tied to reading it blessed is he that
[37:42] read it
[37:43] so there's a blessing just by reading it
[37:45] there's a comma so it goes on
[37:47] and there that hear the words of this
[37:49] prophecy
[37:50] so there's a blessing for those that
[37:52] read it there's a blessing for those
[37:54] that hear it
[37:55] and it goes on and keep those things
[37:57] that are written therein
[37:58] so it is a blessing for those that keep
[38:00] it now you you
[38:02] you would realize that this is building
[38:05] to the level of
[38:06] involvement because you can read it and
[38:08] you already possess it
[38:09] you can hear it so there's still a
[38:11] blessing there but most importantly and
[38:13] keep
[38:14] those things which are written therein
[38:16] for the time is at hand
[38:18] all right so i want to i want to read
[38:20] this now with the amplified it said
[38:22] blessed happy prosperous to be admired
[38:26] i like that happy prosperous to be
[38:30] admired
[38:31] is he who reads and those that hear the
[38:34] words of the prophecy
[38:35] and who keep the things which are
[38:37] written in it
[38:38] healing them and taking them to heart
[38:41] for the time of fulfillment is near
[38:43] now friends if you don't know and don't
[38:47] understand
[38:48] and you don't hear and you don't read
[38:50] and you don't keep them into
[38:52] heart and keep those things how can you
[38:54] keep what you don't know
[38:57] think about it how can you keep in your
[38:59] heart what you haven't spent time trying
[39:01] to understand
[39:02] because if god is unfolding his whole
[39:04] plan his whole divine mystery
[39:06] his whole program in this thing isn't it
[39:09] important for us to be really clear on
[39:11] what these symbols mean
[39:12] and what this thing mean and how it
[39:14] relates to you how it relates to me how
[39:16] it relates to the
[39:17] enemy can the church say amen
[39:21] all right so let's let's begin to build
[39:25] so i just want to take a point here from
[39:27] the prophet in that
[39:29] section on on on on verses one to three
[39:32] that i just read but ibraham is saying
[39:33] it is a revelation
[39:34] because the disciples themselves didn't
[39:36] know these recorded truths
[39:39] it had not been previously reviewed to
[39:41] them so he's saying but
[39:43] now after his death after jesus death
[39:45] and resurrection
[39:46] and at this particular time in his
[39:49] mediatorial ministry he is able to set
[39:52] forth
[39:53] in this revelation of himself to john
[39:55] what his glory
[39:57] and presence in the church would mean
[39:58] and do and
[40:00] and we keep preaching it it have
[40:02] churches have all kind of churches in
[40:03] them
[40:04] but if there's no presence of god in the
[40:06] church
[40:08] then what is that this is not we're not
[40:10] trying to have a membership
[40:11] we're not trying to have a social
[40:12] gathering we're trying to have a group
[40:14] you know what other things people could
[40:15] be doing this evening
[40:17] but we really want to understand how god
[40:19] is moving in this hour
[40:21] what is he doing what is he trying to
[40:23] achieve what is god trying to achieve
[40:25] in every service what is god trying to
[40:27] achieve in this study tonight
[40:28] what does god want us to know what are
[40:30] we preparing for
[40:32] what stones have been uncovered that we
[40:35] need to know get into our hearts so we
[40:37] can guard these things with our hearts
[40:39] anybody with me all right but ibrahim
[40:42] goes on in this revelation
[40:43] we're still building here and this is
[40:45] the prophet was also teaching this as
[40:46] well
[40:47] he tells us what the end of the devil is
[40:50] so the end of the devil we preach all
[40:52] the time satan finished he devils over
[40:54] but the
[40:55] end of the devil is in this book he
[40:57] tells us how he's going to deal
[40:58] with the devil cast him into the lake of
[41:01] fire
[41:02] he reveals the end of the wicked ones
[41:04] who follow satan
[41:05] and satan hates that i'm quoting the
[41:07] prophet
[41:08] have you ever noticed how satan hates
[41:10] two books of the bible
[41:11] more than all others through liberal
[41:15] theologians
[41:16] and pseudo-scientists he's always
[41:18] attacking the book of genesis
[41:20] and the book of revelation in both of
[41:23] these books
[41:24] we find satan's origin his awful ways
[41:27] and his destruction that is why he
[41:29] attacks them he hates to be exposed
[41:32] and in those books he's exposed for
[41:34] exactly what he is
[41:36] so the book of revelation exposes it and
[41:39] covers satan and when we begin to
[41:42] pull out of this and begin to identify
[41:45] where he is at
[41:45] and identify where the power of the
[41:47] church lies then satan is finished
[41:49] but ibraham said the moment the bride
[41:51] gets to know who she is then the rapture
[41:52] will take place
[41:53] so all of this is for us having a clear
[41:55] picture of who we are
[41:57] where we come from where we're going
[41:59] what we supposed to know what we
[42:00] supposed to have
[42:01] the power that is in us and what we're
[42:03] supposed to achieve
[42:04] listen to this when the church
[42:07] disbelieves satan listen carefully this
[42:10] is the prophet
[42:11] when the church disbelieves satan and
[42:14] believes the spirit's revelation of the
[42:17] word
[42:17] the gates of hell cannot prevail against
[42:20] us
[42:21] that is so powerful because the reality
[42:24] is satan is preaching you know
[42:27] let me say it one more time satan is
[42:29] preaching satan preaches his ideas
[42:32] his form of worship satan preaches how
[42:35] you should behave
[42:36] how he should act he do it in pulpits
[42:38] you do it outside the pulpits he use all
[42:40] kind of different influences
[42:42] to try to get his message so it's a war
[42:45] of a communication of messages
[42:49] there are many messages but i'm typing
[42:51] there are many influences there are many
[42:53] voices but branham said
[42:54] but there's one true voice satan will
[42:57] not stop talking he will not stop trying
[42:59] to influence you
[43:00] he will not stop trying to pull your
[43:01] attention
[43:03] but you have to keep focus on that still
[43:05] small voice everybody with me
[43:07] all right so let's go on verse 4
[43:10] we're not going to be too long tonight
[43:12] just laying a foundation for us to get
[43:13] into the deeper things
[43:15] john to the seven churches which are in
[43:18] asia
[43:19] grace be unto you and peace from him
[43:22] which is
[43:23] and which was and which is to come and
[43:26] from the seven spirits
[43:27] which are before his throne i love that
[43:30] john
[43:31] to the seven churches which are in asia
[43:33] grace
[43:34] be unto you and peace from him which is
[43:38] and which was and which is to come and
[43:41] from these seven spirits
[43:42] which are before his soon and the
[43:44] prophet said it so beautifully he said
[43:46] now all these expressions
[43:48] him which is which was which is to come
[43:51] and fearful witness
[43:52] and first born and i'm gonna read among
[43:54] and all
[43:55] it's the same one it's the lord jesus
[43:57] christ
[43:59] isn't that so powerful all right
[44:02] and from jesus christ who is the
[44:04] faithful witness
[44:06] and the first begotten of the dead first
[44:08] begotten of the dead
[44:11] that is the first one who come back from
[44:12] the dead meaning it had more
[44:15] who would come from the dead it had more
[44:18] who would experience
[44:19] resurrection hallelujah and the prince
[44:22] of the kings of the earth
[44:23] unto him that loved us and washed us
[44:26] from
[44:26] our sins in his blood this verse alone
[44:30] is a verse
[44:31] to show because this this speaks
[44:34] jesus is describing himself through john
[44:36] to make it clear that he's the authority
[44:39] hallelujah from him which is present
[44:41] tense which
[44:42] was always was which is to come
[44:44] hallelujah brother branham said what is
[44:46] time to him
[44:47] time is nothing he's eternal and if you
[44:49] understand that he's eternal and you are
[44:51] an attribute of him
[44:52] that you are also eternal that you also
[44:54] had no beginning
[44:55] that you also have no ending hallelujah
[44:58] that you just passing through
[44:59] to have a testimony while you're here
[45:01] that you are not going to be deceived
[45:03] and you're going to recognize
[45:04] who you are and find a secret message
[45:06] with your name on it
[45:09] what a reason to shout what a reason to
[45:11] shout
[45:12] can you truth say man
[45:16] all right so we going we're building
[45:18] we're building we're building
[45:19] and we're going somewhere all right
[45:24] verse six and have made us
[45:28] and and and just and just to really say
[45:30] i want to i want to pull this from the
[45:31] amplified as well and to pull something
[45:33] a few things that the prophet said as
[45:34] well
[45:37] still looking at four on five right so
[45:39] john
[45:40] to the seven churches that are in the
[45:42] province of asia and better branham
[45:43] typed out
[45:44] that these were this was asia minor
[45:47] and that these seven physical churches
[45:50] were matching the
[45:52] characteristics or the nature or the
[45:55] attributes of seven church ages that
[45:57] would also be dispensational meaning
[45:59] over time
[46:00] so the physical churches that were there
[46:02] at that time
[46:03] were reflections of or mirror images
[46:07] of the similar and not to me the
[46:10] behavior the characteristics the
[46:11] qualities
[46:12] of the people who would exist over a
[46:14] certain period of time which we know the
[46:16] seven church ages all right
[46:17] so i i want to highlight here now grace
[46:20] be granted to you
[46:21] and peace listen to the amplified inner
[46:24] calm and spiritual well-being
[46:26] we talked in one of the bible saying
[46:28] about having good sleep and rest and in
[46:30] a calm
[46:31] but i ran a pitch why are we so tossed
[46:32] about he said
[46:34] well letting all the pressure but this
[46:36] whole thing is about bringing
[46:38] peace in a calm and spiritual well-being
[46:41] we're not supposed to be shaken
[46:42] by every news and everything that
[46:44] happened you get a fat tire naturally
[46:46] off your food born and that troy off
[46:48] and all simple things just you that but
[46:51] but peace and inner calm
[46:53] god give us some peace and some inner
[46:55] calm in this neurotic world that we live
[46:57] in
[46:57] from him the peace coming from him who
[47:00] is existing forever
[47:01] and who was continually existing in the
[47:04] past and who is to come
[47:05] and from the seven spirits that are
[47:07] before his throne
[47:09] we're going to talk about those seven
[47:10] spirits
[47:13] before the truth and from jesus christ
[47:14] the faithful and trustworthy witness
[47:17] the first born of the dead and ruler of
[47:19] the kings of the ut
[47:21] to him who always loves us and who has
[47:24] once
[47:24] and for all and this is where they want
[47:26] to get at freed us or
[47:28] washed us so it said wash us but ibrahim
[47:30] said that washed us actually means
[47:32] loosed
[47:33] so it's not just like i don't see that's
[47:35] washing but he said he
[47:36] loosed us from our sins broke us free
[47:40] from our sins
[47:41] freed us from our sins by his own blood
[47:46] and formed us into our kingdom
[47:49] hallelujah is that the reason to be
[47:52] excited it's not a reason to be excited
[47:54] to know that his blood
[47:55] is not just washed but loosed a
[47:58] separation
[47:59] a separation from your sin a separation
[48:01] from your mistakes
[48:02] a separation from your past
[48:05] from the seven spirits which are
[48:08] before his throne and by the branham
[48:11] went in to
[48:12] explain that and brought out all these
[48:13] seven spirits
[48:15] he said those seven spirits that same
[48:18] phrase you can find it four times
[48:20] in the book of revelation revelation 1 4
[48:23] from the seven spirits which are before
[48:25] his throne
[48:26] it's in revelation 3 1 these things say
[48:29] that he
[48:30] that had the seven spirits revelation 4
[48:32] 5 and out of the throne
[48:34] proceeded lightnings and thunderings and
[48:36] voices and there were seven lamps of
[48:38] fire burning before the throne
[48:40] which are the seven spirits of god
[48:42] revelation 5
[48:43] 6 and i beheld and lo in the midst of
[48:45] the throne
[48:46] and of the four beasts and in the midst
[48:48] of the elders instead of
[48:50] as it had been slain having seven horns
[48:52] and seven eyes
[48:53] which are the seven spirits of god sent
[48:55] forth into holy ut
[48:58] so but abraham say these seven spirits
[49:01] is not to teach a doctrine against the
[49:03] one holy spirit
[49:05] but these seven spirits which are also
[49:07] called the lamps
[49:08] of fire burning before the lord since
[49:12] john always used old testament symbols
[49:15] in writing his book of revelation he
[49:17] said
[49:18] that the seven spirits are found to be
[49:20] associated with man
[49:22] john the baptist was called a burning
[49:24] light which should actually
[49:25] translate into burning lamp in
[49:28] revelation 5
[49:29] 6 the seventh spirit identifies as seven
[49:32] eyes
[49:33] from zechariah for who are despised the
[49:35] day of small things
[49:37] for they shall rejoice and shall see the
[49:39] plummet and he handles the rover well
[49:40] with those
[49:42] those seven they are the eyes of the
[49:43] lord it is very evident
[49:45] that the word there refers to men thus
[49:48] we see and i'm reading the prophet here
[49:50] that the eyes of the lord in this
[49:52] incident are men
[49:53] of course they will be anointed men full
[49:55] of the holy ghost
[49:56] for god's ministries and not in the
[49:58] power of men
[49:59] but of the holy ghost putting our
[50:02] spiritual discoveries together
[50:04] so whatever i'm saying is listen is we
[50:06] we we we hunt in here
[50:08] to connect the pieces to see what these
[50:09] symbols mean it is
[50:11] evident that the seven spirits of god
[50:14] refer to the continuous ministry of the
[50:17] same
[50:18] holy spirit in the lives of seven men
[50:21] with whom god identifies himself
[50:24] very closely they are his eyes
[50:28] they are his lamps and who these seven
[50:32] men
[50:32] are can easily be seen because the next
[50:35] phrase calls them the seven stars we'll
[50:37] see
[50:37] later on so we see that these seven
[50:40] spirits
[50:40] actually refer to the one spirit of god
[50:43] working out the will
[50:44] and word of god in different generations
[50:47] so what are we talking about paul
[50:49] irenaeus
[50:50] martin columba luther wesley
[50:54] and our own prophet so when you
[50:57] understand
[50:57] in scripture the way these things are
[50:59] placed how could somebody throw you off
[51:01] and how somebody could displace where
[51:03] the prophet is placed
[51:04] in your heart and and how important it
[51:07] is
[51:08] so it's not just simple as see what he
[51:10] tfc
[51:11] this is the spirits of god and the stars
[51:14] of god
[51:15] the eyes of god the lambs of this thing
[51:18] am i the only one as excited about how
[51:20] powerful this thing is
[51:22] i want us to realize that god put this
[51:25] thing
[51:26] so beautifully that that is why satan is
[51:28] so mad there's no room for the devil to
[51:30] move between this
[51:31] this thing you know because you cannot
[51:33] impersonate this
[51:34] you can't want to be this you can't try
[51:36] to be this you have to be called to this
[51:38] thing anybody with me
[51:40] all right and verse six i love verse six
[51:44] verse six and he said and half made us
[51:47] kings and priests
[51:49] in the amplified it said formed us
[51:52] formed us
[51:53] so it means that if this is not you
[51:54] doing this thing no
[51:56] anybody with me this is not you
[51:59] trying to be a king this is not you
[52:01] trying to be a priest this is not me
[52:03] trying to be a king this is not me
[52:05] trying to be a priest but he
[52:06] formed us he taken control of his
[52:09] destiny
[52:10] he is forming us he's shaping us he's
[52:13] transforming us
[52:14] hallelujah but ibrahim said he
[52:18] hath made us he's the one doing it he
[52:21] said
[52:21] salvation of the lord he redeemed us for
[52:23] purpose he bought us for purpose
[52:25] we are kings spiritual kings we are
[52:28] going to be kings upon the earth with
[52:30] him
[52:30] when he sits on this throne but now we
[52:33] are spiritual kings and we reign over
[52:36] spiritual kingdoms
[52:37] that is no you hear that no you are
[52:40] spiritual kings
[52:44] hallelujah there's an earthly kingship
[52:47] coming when we read an earth but even
[52:48] now you're a spiritual king
[52:50] do you realize you're spiritual king
[52:54] i don't think many of you realize that
[52:55] you're a spiritual king you know
[52:57] because as a spiritual king ever a
[52:59] certain authority
[53:01] as a spiritual king you have a dominion
[53:04] as a spiritual king you have a domain
[53:06] as a spiritual thing you have authority
[53:08] there's an earthly kingship of reigning
[53:10] on the earth but even now you are
[53:12] recognized because he ha
[53:14] that's past tense made us he has done it
[53:18] without consulting anybody without
[53:20] asking for permission
[53:22] without seeing if you're good you're bad
[53:24] this is this here he already did it
[53:26] so whether you like it or not he had
[53:28] already made you into a king and a
[53:30] priest
[53:31] something that in the older days was
[53:32] never possible and we preached on this
[53:34] before
[53:35] because the line of the kings was
[53:36] different from the line of the priests
[53:38] the priests came out of the line of
[53:39] levites kings came out of the regal line
[53:41] of the outer line of judah
[53:43] it was very unlikely almost impossible
[53:46] to find a priest and a king but when
[53:47] jesus came
[53:49] hallelujah he merged the lines and in
[53:52] him was priests
[53:53] in him was king and because of him he
[53:56] now has the authority to create more
[53:58] like him
[54:00] and true john he's saying he already did
[54:02] it so when the devil thought jesus was
[54:04] the only one
[54:05] here it is we're seeing that god already
[54:07] did it and that i'm speaking tonight to
[54:10] kings and priests
[54:11] together kings and priests do you accept
[54:14] your
[54:14] kingship do you accept your priesthood
[54:17] do you accept and realize
[54:18] that as priests you're offering brother
[54:21] say spiritual praise of sanctified lips
[54:24] spending our lives as a sweet offering
[54:28] unto him i'm quoting the prophet your
[54:30] life become an offering
[54:33] do you live your life as an offering
[54:35] could you offer all you are to god
[54:37] as a sweet offering
[54:40] sweet offering i know that means
[54:44] animosity you can't offer your jealousy
[54:47] and your envy and your bad
[54:49] behavior your cow for that but your
[54:51] life's sweet your life itself is a
[54:53] fragrance hallelujah
[54:55] well i said i could i could close up
[54:56] right here right now
[54:58] worship him worshipping him in spirit
[55:01] and in truth
[55:02] listen to the prophet this is just the
[55:04] unmade us pre-spot
[55:05] we still in verse six have made us kings
[55:07] and priests and by the random going in
[55:09] on this free spot
[55:10] he said i made us priests yes whatever
[55:13] i'm saying
[55:14] priests unto him offering the spiritual
[55:17] praise of sanctified lips
[55:21] you only want to dig deeper into that
[55:23] let me are your lips sanctified
[55:25] what have you been talking about this
[55:27] week oh help us lord what have you been
[55:29] what have you been talking about what
[55:30] what what what coming out your mouth are
[55:32] you all lip sync do you find that
[55:34] when people when people pull the
[55:36] recorder of your life
[55:38] huh and play back oh help us jesus
[55:43] they're feeling good in here tonight you
[55:45] know feel like we haven't
[55:47] having bible study pre-offering
[55:50] the spiritual praise of sanctified lips
[55:53] spending our lives as a sweet offering
[55:57] lord help me to live that spending our
[56:00] lives as a sweet offering
[56:03] you see the magnitude we still in verse
[56:05] six in them spending
[56:07] our lives that is our everyday thing you
[56:10] know
[56:10] spending your life as a sweet offering
[56:13] i'm reading the prophet unto him
[56:15] worshiping him in spirit and in truth
[56:18] interceding interceding means you're
[56:21] standing in a gap
[56:23] you have a burden for somebody so
[56:25] somebody not well but but
[56:27] you have a burden you're interceding
[56:28] you're standing here god for your
[56:30] children
[56:30] they don't even know you're praying for
[56:31] them you see somebody looking at it on
[56:34] you you're interceding for them
[56:35] you see somebody come out in a while you
[56:37] intercede you have a burden with them
[56:39] and petitioning
[56:40] you sending requests requests that
[56:43] people see and requested will not even
[56:44] see it but that is the priestly part of
[56:46] your ministry
[56:47] and that's all of us that is not the
[56:51] pastor that is not the elder that is
[56:52] all of us priests and
[56:56] kings unto our god no wonder the prophet
[56:59] said
[56:59] the world doesn't appeal to us and we
[57:01] are a peculiar people
[57:03] zealous unto good words works we have
[57:06] been recreated
[57:07] that's the forming part we have been
[57:08] recreated in him
[57:10] to be children like unto our father
[57:13] hallelujah help us tonight lord
[57:18] so we stood in verse six and had made us
[57:20] kings and priests unto god
[57:22] and his father to him be glory and
[57:24] dominion
[57:25] forever and ever amen everybody with me
[57:29] so far
[57:31] we're going to verse 7 behold he cometh
[57:34] with clouds
[57:37] and every eye shall see him
[57:41] and we'll realize that in the book of
[57:42] revelation everything has meaning
[57:44] there's no word
[57:45] in the book of revelation i don't have a
[57:46] specific meaning behold he come in with
[57:48] a clouds and every eye
[57:50] shall see him and they also which
[57:53] pierced him and all kindreds of the
[57:56] earth
[57:56] shall wail because of him even so amen
[58:03] but abraham said in speaking about this
[58:05] specific verse
[58:06] he said he is coming jesus is coming
[58:09] god is coming the prophet is coming the
[58:12] priest and king is coming
[58:14] the all and all is coming even so lord
[58:17] jesus
[58:17] come quickly amen he is coming he is
[58:20] coming in clouds clouds of glory
[58:23] as when he was seen upon the mount of
[58:26] transfiguration
[58:28] and his garments were shining as the
[58:30] power of god unfolded him
[58:32] and every eye shall he see him that
[58:35] means this is not the rapture that we're
[58:37] talking about here
[58:38] this is when he comes to take over his
[58:40] rightful place as world
[58:42] ruler so we look at the first
[58:46] chapter of revelation already places and
[58:50] speaks of the rulership of jesus and
[58:52] coming back in power
[58:54] this is when listen to the prophet those
[58:57] who have pierced him with their creeds
[58:59] and denominational doctrine shall mourn
[59:02] and all the people shall wail in terror
[59:05] because of him
[59:06] who is the wood
[59:10] anybody with me so far amen
[59:16] glory
[59:22] let's go on to verse eight
[59:25] just just before that sorry let me just
[59:28] read it from the amplified to pull out
[59:29] another point here
[59:30] the holy is coming with the clouds and
[59:32] every eye will see him even those
[59:34] who pierced him and all the tribes of
[59:37] the earth will mourn
[59:38] over him listen to carefulness realizing
[59:41] their sin
[59:42] and guilt because at that point they
[59:45] will realize that they had rejected
[59:49] the truth realizing their sin again and
[59:52] anticipating listen this the coming
[59:54] round
[59:56] so they finally realized but wait a
[59:58] minute i had a chance at opportunity i
[1:00:00] didn't do anything about it no i have to
[1:00:01] give an account
[1:00:03] and this happens to everybody every i
[1:00:04] will see so it shall be
[1:00:06] all right verse 8 i am the alpha
[1:00:10] and omega the beginning and the ending
[1:00:13] sea of the lord
[1:00:14] which is and which was and which is to
[1:00:17] come the almighty
[1:00:19] now let's go i john
[1:00:22] so john's i think they testify now who
[1:00:25] also
[1:00:26] am your brother one
[1:00:29] and companion in tribulation two
[1:00:33] and in the kingdom and patience
[1:00:37] of jesus christ was in the isle that is
[1:00:40] called patmos
[1:00:43] for the word of god and for the
[1:00:45] testimony of jesus christ
[1:00:47] i want to pause here for a minute
[1:00:50] so
[1:00:54] but iran was saying
[1:00:57] and you know sometimes people are saying
[1:00:58] they're having a hard time and and
[1:01:00] having a tough time and i get it we have
[1:01:02] tough times
[1:01:03] but this is not actual
[1:01:06] this man john was in the isle of patmos
[1:01:10] which is a prison colony
[1:01:14] for a specific reason
[1:01:18] for the word of god and for the
[1:01:20] testimony of jesus christ
[1:01:22] anybody come to your house and carry you
[1:01:24] and put you in prison because you
[1:01:25] believed you would
[1:01:34] listen to the prophet on this this
[1:01:35] series of visions of the revelation
[1:01:37] of the person of jesus christ was given
[1:01:39] to john while he was banished to the
[1:01:41] isle of patmos
[1:01:42] it have some people they get a little
[1:01:45] trial they kind of sing a song
[1:01:50] something go wrong and the song they
[1:01:54] even turn over music
[1:01:56] something go wrong and you can get a
[1:01:58] squeaker praise
[1:02:01] but while he was banished to the isle of
[1:02:03] patmos
[1:02:05] this small island is 30 miles this is a
[1:02:07] profit off the coast of asia minor in
[1:02:09] the aegean sea
[1:02:11] listen being rocky and infested with
[1:02:14] snakes
[1:02:14] lizards and scorpions
[1:02:18] it had little commercial value so it was
[1:02:21] used by the roman
[1:02:22] empire for a penal colony or prison
[1:02:24] colony
[1:02:25] where will house the more desperate
[1:02:28] criminals
[1:02:29] political prisoners etc
[1:02:34] you will notice that john has addressed
[1:02:36] himself to the christians
[1:02:37] as a brother in tribulation
[1:02:41] it was at this time that the early
[1:02:43] church was going through great
[1:02:45] persecutions their religion was not only
[1:02:48] everywhere spoken against so this is not
[1:02:51] just people talking
[1:02:52] that you believe something that that
[1:02:54] that but the people themselves were
[1:02:56] imprisoned and killed
[1:03:00] you see how much how different it is for
[1:03:02] us
[1:03:05] now you think tonight if
[1:03:08] if they were to come tonight to your
[1:03:09] house and actually if you believe you're
[1:03:11] going to prison
[1:03:12] anybody want to argue an activist should
[1:03:15] raise their hands
[1:03:16] but i wonder how many people tonight
[1:03:20] would say are you ready to go you know
[1:03:23] i'm hoping that everybody would say
[1:03:24] they're already ready because they
[1:03:25] believe
[1:03:29] but you have people because listen look
[1:03:31] how this thing is there
[1:03:33] peter's denial denial of christ was when
[1:03:36] they accused him of being with jesus you
[1:03:38] know
[1:03:39] and peter before he was committed
[1:03:42] sinners so
[1:03:45] denial you know sometimes people don't
[1:03:48] know they always say
[1:03:49] you don't know under whatever pressure
[1:03:51] what people can already do yeah
[1:03:52] yeah that kind of thing under what
[1:03:54] pressure under what situation
[1:03:56] you know it and it really takes pressure
[1:03:58] to show who you really are
[1:04:00] peter didn't anticipate that he would
[1:04:02] have been i want to be very careful
[1:04:04] saying he's so weak
[1:04:05] when confronted with his testimony you
[1:04:08] know
[1:04:09] because after because the lord told
[1:04:11] peter
[1:04:12] you're going to deny me and peter did
[1:04:14] not believe him
[1:04:18] i'll wait again it is so it should not
[1:04:20] have come to
[1:04:21] a surprise to peter so peter actually
[1:04:23] shocked his own self
[1:04:25] i want you to catch something here
[1:04:27] because the lord told peter
[1:04:28] you will deny me and peter say never
[1:04:31] happen
[1:04:34] so this is why after he denied and here
[1:04:37] he caught crew
[1:04:38] he wept bitterly because he came
[1:04:41] and into a confrontation with something
[1:04:44] in him
[1:04:45] a certain level of weakness in him that
[1:04:48] he didn't realize
[1:04:49] that he had anybody anybody with me
[1:04:53] so i want us to understand that you
[1:04:56] haven't seen
[1:04:57] pressure for the cause of your testimony
[1:05:02] you haven't seen it
[1:05:05] you haven't seen the kind of persecution
[1:05:07] that that philosophy would have gone
[1:05:08] through
[1:05:11] nobody come and say because they believe
[1:05:12] the bible
[1:05:14] look recently i saw somebody a church in
[1:05:16] the u.s put up an announcement they say
[1:05:18] very soon
[1:05:19] our preaching will be called hate speech
[1:05:24] so we will not be able to broadcast the
[1:05:26] way we did before
[1:05:28] when that time comes because if you read
[1:05:30] the scripture
[1:05:32] about certain issues no it is called
[1:05:35] call hate speech
[1:05:37] can you stand to defend what you believe
[1:05:40] so i want to escalate us now to john's
[1:05:43] condition
[1:05:44] his situation his challenge what he is
[1:05:47] dealing with
[1:05:48] and yet still he can find himself in the
[1:05:51] spirit
[1:05:53] so listen to the prophet continuing john
[1:05:55] like multitudes of
[1:05:56] others was now suffering imprisonment
[1:06:01] for the word of god and the testimony of
[1:06:03] jesus christ
[1:06:05] when arrested they tried in vain to kill
[1:06:09] him
[1:06:10] by boiling him in oil for 24 hours
[1:06:15] [Music]
[1:06:17] hey nice nice nice brother pop well i
[1:06:20] was driving
[1:06:21] in the car today thinking about this
[1:06:23] thing right and i said boiling in oil
[1:06:26] my picture of boiling in oil is like
[1:06:27] saying fry
[1:06:29] go when something boiling you see
[1:06:31] bubbling
[1:06:32] so i said them trying to fry jon boy
[1:06:37] i said but i just said but it's friday
[1:06:39] try to fry john and when they
[1:06:40] try to scoop john i reckon i joined a
[1:06:42] friend it's boiling
[1:06:44] boiling oil and recognized but this
[1:06:46] money boiling
[1:06:48] whatever this man into could you imagine
[1:06:50] in the midst of that
[1:06:52] god still preserved what a mighty god we
[1:06:55] serve
[1:06:56] that had to be one of the most confusing
[1:06:58] experiences
[1:07:00] in that day you know but we put a man in
[1:07:02] there we lied eating
[1:07:03] the oil boiling we put john inside and
[1:07:06] john still come outside smiling
[1:07:09] say a prisoner of the lord fellow
[1:07:12] servant
[1:07:12] and listen you don't think god will
[1:07:15] defend you when you need to be defended
[1:07:16] you don't think god will protect you
[1:07:18] when if you stand for him he promises
[1:07:20] stand for you
[1:07:22] have some guts have some courage have
[1:07:24] some strength
[1:07:25] to have a testimony it doesn't matter
[1:07:28] what the opposition is
[1:07:29] have a testimony hallelujah
[1:07:34] listen when arrested they tried i'm
[1:07:37] reading from the prophet
[1:07:38] when arrested the child and veeam to
[1:07:40] kill him by boiling him in oil for 24
[1:07:42] hours
[1:07:43] the enraged and powerless officials then
[1:07:46] sentence him
[1:07:47] to patmos as a witch
[1:07:50] so this is how john even end up in
[1:07:53] patmos
[1:07:54] but god was with him could somebody say
[1:07:56] the lord has been with you
[1:07:59] with you through your trials with you
[1:08:01] through your testing with you every
[1:08:03] situation
[1:08:04] all of us most people i know who who who
[1:08:07] believe this thing
[1:08:09] could tell you how much time the devil
[1:08:10] tried to kill them they were trying to
[1:08:11] think all kind of situation you could
[1:08:13] look back and see how did they
[1:08:14] take you out and i see there was
[1:08:16] approach when moses was born
[1:08:17] he tried to kill when jesus was born
[1:08:19] that says nature through your life you
[1:08:21] have all kind of situations all kind of
[1:08:23] things
[1:08:23] nearly happen you're almost getting an
[1:08:25] accident you're almost thinking the
[1:08:26] thing you're
[1:08:26] all connecting happen and you see but it
[1:08:29] was the lord keeping you all the time
[1:08:30] because there's a purpose for your life
[1:08:31] and you have to believe that
[1:08:32] and walk in now can you church say amen
[1:08:34] but god was with him
[1:08:36] and he was spared to leave the island
[1:08:37] and return to ephesus
[1:08:39] where he gave where he continued as
[1:08:40] pastor until the time of his death
[1:08:42] so the visions were ibrahim said that
[1:08:44] john received covered a period of two
[1:08:46] years
[1:08:47] 1895 to 96 and they are the most
[1:08:51] remarkable
[1:08:52] of all visions in the world so what
[1:08:54] we're reading here in the book of
[1:08:55] revelation is the
[1:08:56] most remarkable of all visions in all of
[1:08:59] the world
[1:09:00] the entire book is set forth in symbols
[1:09:03] and therefore is the target of much
[1:09:05] criticism and dispute however
[1:09:07] it does have the seal of god upon it i'm
[1:09:09] reading the prophet's word right
[1:09:11] so i john who also am your brother and
[1:09:15] companion and tribulation
[1:09:18] and in the kingdom and patience of jesus
[1:09:20] christ was in the aisle
[1:09:22] that is called pacmus for the word of
[1:09:24] god and for the testimony of jesus
[1:09:26] christ
[1:09:27] verse 10 i was in a spirit
[1:09:30] on the lord's day and heard behind me a
[1:09:33] great voice
[1:09:34] as of our trumpet and but abraham said
[1:09:37] i was in the spirit isn't this that just
[1:09:40] beautiful
[1:09:41] my i love that you could just call those
[1:09:43] words
[1:09:44] the whole of the christian life if we
[1:09:47] are going to live as christians
[1:09:48] we have to be in his spirit john was not
[1:09:51] talking about being in his own spirit
[1:09:53] that would not have brought these
[1:09:54] visions it had to be the spirit of god
[1:09:58] it has to be the spirit of god with us
[1:10:00] too for all
[1:10:01] our efforts are in vain paul said i will
[1:10:04] pray in the spirit
[1:10:05] i will sing in the spirit i will live in
[1:10:08] the spirit
[1:10:08] if there is anything good that will come
[1:10:10] to be it has to be revealed by the
[1:10:13] spirit
[1:10:13] confirmed by the word and made manifest
[1:10:16] by the results it bears
[1:10:18] as surely as john needed to be in the
[1:10:21] spirit
[1:10:22] to receive these tremendous revelations
[1:10:25] fresh from jesus
[1:10:26] we need to be in the spirit to
[1:10:29] understand the revelations
[1:10:31] that god has given to us to live by in
[1:10:34] his word
[1:10:34] for it is the same spirit and that is
[1:10:36] why so many times
[1:10:38] you see us emphasizing being spirit
[1:10:40] worship
[1:10:41] create an atmosphere and this is why we
[1:10:44] say it
[1:10:45] i can't understand how you could be in
[1:10:47] this message and read the same quote and
[1:10:48] be dead
[1:10:50] it it your match don't add up this thing
[1:10:53] is too good when you see the context of
[1:10:55] this
[1:10:55] you have to be in the spirit whether you
[1:10:57] understand everything or not you have to
[1:10:59] be in the spirit because
[1:11:01] only when in the spirit and by the
[1:11:02] brandon went on in this same message
[1:11:04] talking about if you spirit
[1:11:06] the ball game and spiritually dance and
[1:11:08] whatever it is if you're not in the
[1:11:10] spirit of something you can't get into
[1:11:12] it
[1:11:12] and friends now more than ever we have
[1:11:15] to be the spirit of the coming of the
[1:11:16] lord
[1:11:17] we have to be the spirit of where we are
[1:11:19] going we are leaving this place
[1:11:21] we have to be the spirit of heavenly
[1:11:23] places we have to be the spirit
[1:11:25] and come up hither as john was called to
[1:11:26] come up hither because we live in this
[1:11:28] world behind
[1:11:29] we cannot be in the spirit of the things
[1:11:30] of the world we cannot be the spirit of
[1:11:32] of trying to do this and trying to do
[1:11:34] that we have to be in the spirit of the
[1:11:36] lord
[1:11:37] john said i was in the spirit we're
[1:11:39] still on verse 10 on the lord's day
[1:11:42] and heard behind me a great voice as of
[1:11:44] a trumpet
[1:11:46] and brother branham said that as of a
[1:11:47] trumpet is not it wasn't a trumpet it
[1:11:49] was as of a trumpet
[1:11:51] and he was typing it as when a trumpet
[1:11:54] is blown
[1:11:55] it is blown with urgency it is blown to
[1:11:58] call your attention
[1:11:59] it is blown for it to be something that
[1:12:01] is urgent for you to pay attention
[1:12:04] wait to realize that that is a that is a
[1:12:06] serious a serious time here
[1:12:08] all right everybody with me all right so
[1:12:12] saying so this is the voice as of what
[1:12:14] trump is saying
[1:12:15] verse 11 i am alpha and omega
[1:12:19] the first and the last and what thou
[1:12:22] seest
[1:12:23] write in a book and send it unto these
[1:12:26] seven churches
[1:12:27] which are in asia unto ephesus and unto
[1:12:30] smyrna
[1:12:31] and unto pergamos and onto tyre tyra and
[1:12:35] onto sardis
[1:12:36] and unto philadelphia and until laodicea
[1:12:39] and i turned to see the voice
[1:12:43] that speak with me and but ibrahim said
[1:12:45] he didn't seem to see the person who had
[1:12:46] a voice he said because he voices the
[1:12:48] person he's like tend to see the voice
[1:12:50] that speak with me and being turned i
[1:12:53] saw seven
[1:12:54] golden candlesticks everybody with me
[1:12:57] tonight
[1:12:58] students of the world will know what the
[1:13:00] candidates represent
[1:13:01] it is said low down in scripture but the
[1:13:03] golden candlesticks
[1:13:04] are the church ages are the churches the
[1:13:07] seven
[1:13:07] are the actual churches and in the midst
[1:13:10] verse 13 in the midst
[1:13:11] of the seven candlesticks one like unto
[1:13:14] the son of man like unto the son of man
[1:13:18] and i want to kind of kind of hone in on
[1:13:20] this path and we get ready to close out
[1:13:21] for tonight i trust the young people
[1:13:24] being blessed
[1:13:25] i trust that those who know this being
[1:13:29] reminded and
[1:13:30] is a refresher for you and i trust again
[1:13:32] some inspiration from this tonight
[1:13:35] we're looking at verse 13 here and in
[1:13:38] the midst
[1:13:38] of the seven candlesticks one like
[1:13:42] unto the son of man so it's a likeness
[1:13:44] of the son of man
[1:13:46] but he is clothed with a garment down to
[1:13:49] the foot
[1:13:53] and good about the pups with a golden
[1:13:56] girdle
[1:13:57] verse 14 his head and his ears
[1:14:00] were white like wool
[1:14:05] as white as snow and his eyes were as
[1:14:09] flames
[1:14:09] of fire and his feet
[1:14:13] like unto fine brass as if they burned
[1:14:16] in a fullness
[1:14:17] and his voice as the sound of many
[1:14:19] waters
[1:14:20] i want to read this one more time and
[1:14:22] then we're going to take our time and go
[1:14:23] through the symbology
[1:14:24] so we are clear on what it is all right
[1:14:27] we're going to take it from verse 12
[1:14:28] again
[1:14:29] and we're going to go down to verse 15.
[1:14:30] and i turned to see the voice that speak
[1:14:32] with me
[1:14:33] and being turned i saw seven golden
[1:14:36] candle six
[1:14:38] and in the midst of the seven
[1:14:40] candlesticks one like under the son of
[1:14:42] man
[1:14:43] clothed with a garment down to the foot
[1:14:46] and good about the pups with a golden
[1:14:48] girdle
[1:14:49] his head and his ears were white like
[1:14:52] wool
[1:14:52] as white as snow and his eyes were as a
[1:14:56] flame of fire
[1:14:57] and his feet like under fine brass as if
[1:15:00] they burned in a furnace
[1:15:02] and his voice as a sound of many waters
[1:15:05] and by the branham taught us that every
[1:15:07] single one of these things
[1:15:08] means something so we want to make sure
[1:15:11] we all understand what these things mean
[1:15:12] tonight
[1:15:14] but abraham said how deeply moving and
[1:15:17] inspiring
[1:15:18] was the appearing of jesus to john
[1:15:21] who was in exile for the cause of the
[1:15:24] wood
[1:15:24] and behold the living word now stands
[1:15:28] before him
[1:15:29] what an illuminating vision for
[1:15:32] every descriptive attribute has a
[1:15:35] significance
[1:15:36] what a revelation of his glorious being
[1:15:39] john first notices and mentions the
[1:15:42] whiteness of his hair
[1:15:43] it was white as bright as snow this was
[1:15:47] not because of his age
[1:15:49] oh no the brilliantly white here does
[1:15:52] not signify age
[1:15:53] but experience maturity and wisdom
[1:15:57] the eternal one does not age what is
[1:15:59] time to god
[1:16:00] time means little to god but wisdom
[1:16:03] means much
[1:16:04] remember we had teachings on with on
[1:16:07] wisdom last year right it is as when
[1:16:10] solomon called to god
[1:16:11] for wisdom to judge the people of israel
[1:16:15] now he is coming the judge of hollywood
[1:16:18] he will be crowned with
[1:16:20] wisdom and that is what the white here
[1:16:23] signifies but the brandon said even the
[1:16:26] world
[1:16:27] understands this symbology for in
[1:16:30] ancient times
[1:16:31] the judge would appear and convene court
[1:16:34] dressed in a white wig
[1:16:36] and a long robe that signified his
[1:16:38] complete
[1:16:39] authority head-to-foot robe to meet our
[1:16:42] justice
[1:16:43] so but ibanez type in here that this is
[1:16:45] no longer
[1:16:46] the the priestly role that he's in here
[1:16:50] now
[1:16:51] he said he said this is the role of
[1:16:53] judgment
[1:16:54] and not just the here white as well but
[1:16:56] he said think of it
[1:16:57] those eyes we just read it here his eyes
[1:17:01] were as a flame of fire
[1:17:03] think of it and young people i want to
[1:17:04] catch this because this is important
[1:17:06] because this is the season this is the
[1:17:08] time this is
[1:17:10] all of the pieces coming together here
[1:17:11] now think of it those eyes that were
[1:17:13] once dimmed
[1:17:14] this isn't the holy prophet breaking it
[1:17:16] out tears of sorrow and pity
[1:17:19] those eyes that wept with compassion at
[1:17:21] the grave of lazarus
[1:17:23] so brother branham now is breaking out
[1:17:26] what john is also seeing here
[1:17:28] the eyes that wept at the grave of
[1:17:30] lazarus
[1:17:31] in pity and sorrow those eyes that saw
[1:17:35] not the evil of the murderers who hanged
[1:17:38] on the cross
[1:17:40] but in sorrow cried father forgive them
[1:17:43] now those eyes are a flame of fire the
[1:17:46] eyes of the judge
[1:17:48] who will recompense those who rejected
[1:17:51] him
[1:17:52] now understand this this issue of
[1:17:54] judgment
[1:17:56] and this issue of the eyes of fire look
[1:17:58] how the prophet placed it
[1:18:00] for those who rejected him
[1:18:05] of all the human emotions he manifested
[1:18:08] the most when he appeared
[1:18:09] as the son of man was this one he wept
[1:18:12] often
[1:18:13] yet behind that weeping and that sorrow
[1:18:16] there was still god
[1:18:17] those same eyes saw visions they looked
[1:18:20] deep within the hearts of men
[1:18:22] and read their very thoughts and knew
[1:18:24] all their various ways
[1:18:26] blazing out of mortal eyes was god
[1:18:29] who cried to those who knew him not for
[1:18:32] what he was
[1:18:34] like jeremiah of old so but the branham
[1:18:36] is painting this picture now
[1:18:38] of this one like unto the son of man who
[1:18:41] we know is christ he's talking about
[1:18:43] but his role has changed his
[1:18:45] responsibility has changed
[1:18:46] what he's about to do has changed is not
[1:18:49] like when he was here in ut
[1:18:51] this is him in his office of a judge he
[1:18:53] said like jeremiah of
[1:18:55] old he was the weeping prophet for men
[1:18:58] receive not the word of god and that's
[1:19:01] why we are preaching about going all the
[1:19:03] way
[1:19:04] taking all the word living the entire
[1:19:06] life stopping the foolishness
[1:19:08] because he was the weeping prophet for
[1:19:10] men receive not the word of god and
[1:19:12] thrust aside in revelation
[1:19:14] those fiery flaming eyes of the judge
[1:19:18] are even now listen carefully recording
[1:19:21] the lives of all flesh
[1:19:23] we preached about it two weeks ago about
[1:19:26] your life being recorded
[1:19:28] so you see in those eyes is what is
[1:19:30] seeing you seeing eyes
[1:19:32] of god you're seeing eyes of jesus is
[1:19:35] recording all
[1:19:36] all the activity running to and fro
[1:19:39] throughout the earth there is nothing he
[1:19:41] does not know
[1:19:43] god help us tonight in whatever
[1:19:46] condition we are in to see
[1:19:48] the seriousness of the hour to
[1:19:50] understand
[1:19:51] the context we haven't even we're still
[1:19:53] in chapter one you know
[1:19:54] of this great unfolding mystery but here
[1:19:57] it will be taking time to see
[1:19:59] how this thing unfolds and what each
[1:20:01] thing means what it signifies
[1:20:03] the impact on our lives how it should
[1:20:05] make us live differently
[1:20:06] that those fiery flaming eyes but about
[1:20:09] him said there's nothing
[1:20:10] he doesn't know he knows the desires of
[1:20:13] the heart
[1:20:14] and what each one intends to do there's
[1:20:18] nothing hidden
[1:20:19] that shall not be revealed for all
[1:20:21] things are naked before him
[1:20:22] with whom we have to do think of it he
[1:20:24] knows even now what you're thinking
[1:20:27] anybody with me tonight yes but ibanum
[1:20:30] said
[1:20:30] there he stands as judge with flaming
[1:20:34] eyes
[1:20:34] to meet our judgment the day of mercy is
[1:20:38] over
[1:20:38] oh but abraham said that men would
[1:20:40] repent and seek his face in
[1:20:43] righteousness
[1:20:44] while there is yet time that they might
[1:20:46] make
[1:20:47] his bosom their pillow here the world
[1:20:49] dissolves
[1:20:50] in fire everybody with me so we touch on
[1:20:54] the here white as wool
[1:20:56] we touch on the eyes as a flame of fire
[1:20:58] and only last one
[1:21:00] in verse 15 and his feet like undefined
[1:21:03] brass as if they burned
[1:21:07] in a fullness what does that mean amber
[1:21:09] branham goes into it
[1:21:11] he said on his feet like on defined
[1:21:13] brass
[1:21:14] as if they burned in a furnace he said
[1:21:17] brass is
[1:21:18] noted for its remarkable hardness
[1:21:22] there's nothing that is known that you
[1:21:23] can put with it to temper it
[1:21:26] but this brass that is describing his
[1:21:28] feet is more remarkable yet
[1:21:31] in that it has stood the test of the
[1:21:33] fiery furnace
[1:21:34] a test that no other one has gone
[1:21:37] through
[1:21:38] and that is exactly right for this brass
[1:21:40] signifies
[1:21:41] divine judgment a judgment that god
[1:21:44] decreed
[1:21:45] and brought to pass so let's get closer
[1:21:48] to what it means now
[1:21:49] he said but someday those feet of brass
[1:21:51] will stand upon the earth
[1:21:54] and the judge of holy earth he shall be
[1:21:56] with equity and perfection he will judge
[1:21:59] mankind
[1:22:00] and listen to what the brass signifies
[1:22:02] now so we know he's judged be right here
[1:22:05] we know the clothes we understand the
[1:22:07] eyes the flaming eyes the eyes of fire
[1:22:09] that's seeing everything so he's not
[1:22:11] judging from a position of not knowing
[1:22:12] he knows all even the very thoughts even
[1:22:15] very intense
[1:22:16] but this this this this brass feet
[1:22:19] fine brass he said and there will be no
[1:22:23] evading that judgment
[1:22:24] no turning of that justice there will be
[1:22:27] no tempering of it
[1:22:30] so in other words what this signifies is
[1:22:32] you know there are situations where a
[1:22:34] judge could be lenient
[1:22:36] in law there are situations where if
[1:22:40] it's a first offense
[1:22:41] you could get off a little bit easier if
[1:22:43] it's a second offense the judge had the
[1:22:44] discretion
[1:22:45] to be a little firmer with it
[1:22:49] the judge has the latitude of which to
[1:22:50] operate
[1:22:52] but in this context here this judge
[1:22:56] this brass what it means is there's no
[1:22:59] turning of that justice
[1:23:00] so there's no letting off the hook
[1:23:04] there's no well because it's you you're
[1:23:06] not gonna die
[1:23:07] i'm gonna let you live out your time
[1:23:10] this is
[1:23:11] full justice being dispensed this is
[1:23:13] this is what we're talking about here
[1:23:14] no turning of that justice there will be
[1:23:16] no tempering of it no
[1:23:17] softening of it anybody with me
[1:23:23] and look how better abandon places it he
[1:23:25] rather than just will be unjust still
[1:23:28] it's set here that is filthy filthy
[1:23:31] still
[1:23:33] yuka sweet talk the judge
[1:23:37] you can't bribe the judge you can't
[1:23:39] nobody could bring a good word for you
[1:23:40] well you're used to helping church
[1:23:42] plenty
[1:23:46] you had nice ways you never really you
[1:23:49] you really wasn't generally speaking as
[1:23:51] a good person you always believe
[1:23:52] do good unto them and the golden rule
[1:23:55] this is not that
[1:23:57] the judge has to operate
[1:24:01] under a certain approach and this
[1:24:03] approach is one where there's no
[1:24:05] tempering
[1:24:06] it's filthy filthy still righteous you
[1:24:08] go over there
[1:24:09] filthy you go over there you have no
[1:24:11] small talk
[1:24:12] to explain why they do what you're doing
[1:24:14] and why i went into adultery and why you
[1:24:17] cheat
[1:24:17] and why a lie and why and there's no
[1:24:20] explanation here now
[1:24:22] it's fine brass temple and fire
[1:24:26] judgment being dispatched
[1:24:31] he that is unjust unjust still he let
[1:24:33] his filthy filthy self
[1:24:34] the unchanging one will not change then
[1:24:37] for he never has and ever will those
[1:24:39] feet of brass will crush the enemy
[1:24:41] they will destroy the antichrist the
[1:24:43] beast and the image
[1:24:44] and all that is vile in his sight he
[1:24:46] will destroy the church systems
[1:24:48] this is this feat of brazil destroy the
[1:24:51] church system that has taken his name
[1:24:53] only to corrupt its brilliance
[1:24:56] and cross them along with the antichrist
[1:24:59] all the wicked
[1:25:00] the atheists the agnostics the
[1:25:03] modernists
[1:25:04] the liberals will all be there look how
[1:25:07] look how the significance of what iran
[1:25:09] are bringing out there
[1:25:12] death hell and the grave will be there
[1:25:13] yes they will for when he comes the
[1:25:15] books will be opened
[1:25:17] this is when even the lukewarm church
[1:25:20] and the five foolish virgins will appear
[1:25:23] he will separate the sheep from the goat
[1:25:25] when he comes he will take over the
[1:25:27] kingdom for it is his
[1:25:28] and with him will be thousand times ten
[1:25:30] thousand his bride will come to minister
[1:25:32] to him
[1:25:33] anybody with me so far and the last part
[1:25:36] of that
[1:25:37] and his voice as the sound of many
[1:25:39] waters
[1:25:43] his voice was as a sound of multitude
[1:25:46] speaking
[1:25:47] young people you with me and i want to
[1:25:49] encourage
[1:25:50] you young people parents encourage
[1:25:53] your children to be part of these bible
[1:25:55] studies don't take it for granted
[1:25:58] they feed in their minds with all kinds
[1:26:00] of let them settle down
[1:26:02] sit down and pay attention because this
[1:26:04] is eternal life we talking about
[1:26:08] the last attribute here that we read in
[1:26:09] verse 15
[1:26:11] his feet like onto fine brass as if they
[1:26:13] burn in her fullness
[1:26:14] and his voice at the sound of many
[1:26:16] waters
[1:26:18] his voice was a son of a multitude
[1:26:20] speaking
[1:26:21] what is it it is the judgment for these
[1:26:23] listen
[1:26:24] are the voices of the multitudes of
[1:26:27] witnesses who by the holy spirit all
[1:26:30] through the ages
[1:26:32] have testified to christ and preaches
[1:26:34] gospel
[1:26:35] it will be the voice of every man rising
[1:26:38] in judgment against the sinner who would
[1:26:41] not take warning
[1:26:42] we building here the voices of the seven
[1:26:45] messengers
[1:26:46] will be heard loud and clear those
[1:26:49] faithful preachers who preached the
[1:26:52] saving power of jesus
[1:26:54] who preached water baptism in jesus name
[1:26:57] who preached the infilling and power of
[1:26:59] the holy ghost
[1:27:00] who stood with the word more than they
[1:27:03] stood with their own lives
[1:27:04] all of them were the voice of jesus
[1:27:06] christ by the holy ghost
[1:27:08] down through the ages so this voice of
[1:27:12] many waters that he's speaking with
[1:27:13] is all combined is there it's all the
[1:27:16] preachers
[1:27:17] song leaders testimonies prophets
[1:27:20] apostles all to the ages who had
[1:27:23] something to say
[1:27:24] to lift the name jesus higher and to
[1:27:26] speak against sin
[1:27:31] but ibn said have you ever thought how
[1:27:33] terrifying it is to a man drifting
[1:27:35] helplessly towards a cataract
[1:27:37] think now of that roar as he approaches
[1:27:40] his shore and sit in doom
[1:27:43] just exactly like that is coming the day
[1:27:45] of judgment when the roar
[1:27:47] of the multitude of voices
[1:27:50] condemns you for not having paid heed
[1:27:54] before it was too late take heed this
[1:27:57] very hour
[1:27:58] for at this moment your thoughts are
[1:28:00] being recorded in heaven
[1:28:02] in other words this bible study the
[1:28:05] voice of this study
[1:28:06] is part of that is part of that sound of
[1:28:10] many waters
[1:28:12] every service you go to where the truth
[1:28:15] is preach
[1:28:16] is part of that voice as the song of
[1:28:18] many waters
[1:28:21] all of the opportunities so when
[1:28:23] somebody comes and
[1:28:24] and is in the presence and you see the
[1:28:27] judge you
[1:28:28] you actually hearing all of the voices
[1:28:30] that would have actually told you turn
[1:28:31] your life around
[1:28:34] stop doing what you're doing get right
[1:28:36] with god
[1:28:39] as a voice are you saying of a cataract
[1:28:42] or this is like a waterfall
[1:28:43] are you and you're getting closer to the
[1:28:45] judgment
[1:28:47] but you're understanding why why are
[1:28:49] being judged because you were given the
[1:28:50] opportunity
[1:28:52] to get your life right with god you were
[1:28:55] given the opportunity to tell your life
[1:28:57] around
[1:28:58] every service friend don't take it for
[1:29:02] granted
[1:29:03] don't make it a light thing don't make
[1:29:05] it a a a
[1:29:06] simple thing and verse 16.
[1:29:10] let's try the final place to close up my
[1:29:12] time is already up and he had in his
[1:29:13] right hand seven stars
[1:29:15] he has preached it all the time he's
[1:29:17] seven stars he's seven
[1:29:18] the seven messengers i would talk about
[1:29:21] brother branham was a star in the right
[1:29:23] hand of god
[1:29:24] and i'm type of that that that that that
[1:29:27] right hand
[1:29:29] is is authority that right hand is power
[1:29:33] so the stanley right hand of god is very
[1:29:35] authority the very authority of god the
[1:29:37] very
[1:29:37] power of god anybody with me
[1:29:41] hallelujah
[1:29:44] there he is with these seven stars in it
[1:29:46] right then the right hand or arm
[1:29:48] signifies the power and authority of god
[1:29:53] they go forth this signifies that the
[1:29:55] very power and authority of god
[1:29:57] are behind his messengers to every age
[1:30:01] people who want to speak against the
[1:30:02] prophet they have to be very careful
[1:30:04] dangerous wrong because they go forth in
[1:30:06] the fire and power of the holy ghost
[1:30:08] with the word
[1:30:08] they are stars because they reflect
[1:30:11] light
[1:30:12] the light they reflect is his light they
[1:30:14] have no light of their own
[1:30:16] they kindle not their own fires that men
[1:30:18] may walk in the light of their sparks
[1:30:21] hallelujah these seven messengers are
[1:30:24] making god known to the people
[1:30:28] amen we're sick and he had in his right
[1:30:30] hand seven stars
[1:30:32] and out of his mouth went a sharp to red
[1:30:34] sword which you know he's a word
[1:30:36] and his countenance as the sunshine in
[1:30:38] his strength
[1:30:39] i'm going to just kind of close this off
[1:30:40] here and then we could continue some of
[1:30:42] the time
[1:30:42] and when i saw him i fell at his feet as
[1:30:45] dead
[1:30:46] and he laid his hand his right hand upon
[1:30:48] me saying unto me fear not
[1:30:50] i am the first and the last i am he that
[1:30:53] liveth and was dead and behold
[1:30:54] i am alive forevermore amen and have the
[1:30:57] keys
[1:30:58] of death and hell write the things which
[1:31:01] thou has seen
[1:31:04] and the things which are and the things
[1:31:06] which shall be hereafter
[1:31:09] the mystery of the seven stars which
[1:31:11] thou saw is in my right hand
[1:31:14] and the seven goal on candlesticks the
[1:31:16] seven stars are the angels
[1:31:18] we know as messengers of the seven
[1:31:20] churches and the seven candlesticks
[1:31:23] which thousands are the seven
[1:31:28] churches
[1:31:30] may the lord had a blessing to the
[1:31:31] reading of his word
[1:31:33] in this little introduction of the book
[1:31:36] of revelation
[1:31:38] i trust that it has been a blessing to
[1:31:41] you
[1:31:42] and for those who are studying it for
[1:31:44] the first time
[1:31:45] that you will go deep point it because
[1:31:47] you need to understand these things you
[1:31:48] need to
[1:31:49] know these things you need to understand
[1:31:50] what god is trying to do in this season
[1:31:52] so a simple teaching some symbology in
[1:31:56] there
[1:31:57] but i praise a blessing to you and uh if
[1:31:59] i could leave you with
[1:32:00] with this what really struck me
[1:32:04] is the attributes of this judge
[1:32:07] the wisdom the white hair the clothes
[1:32:10] the eyes of fire the fact that that
[1:32:13] brass feet means
[1:32:14] whatever the sentence is prescribed is
[1:32:17] what the centers will be given
