[43:27] if the word of God is not inspired to us

[44:59] to you the
[45:01] individual and that's when we hear it
[45:04] that's when we recognize it and that's
[45:07] when we're ready to act upon it isn't
[45:10] that right and then when we become
[45:13] convinced and then concerned about the
[45:15] time and the season and the day that
[45:18] we're living in Hallelujah isn't that
[45:21] right so the Holy Ghost wants to come in
[45:23] more than ever before amen and place the
[45:26] church positionally isn't that right but
[45:29] it's been bound by Creeds Bound by
[45:32] dogmas but in the evening time there
[45:35] shall be lights that's a promise this
[45:37] morning I don't care how bound you feel
[45:40] I don't care how messed up you feel in
[45:43] the evening time in the dark time in the
[45:46] shadows of the Dying World there shall
[45:49] be
[45:50] light oh you're not hearing me this
[45:54] morning oh Hallelujah if you heard me
[45:56] this morning we'd have to fix the roof
[45:59] cuz you be on your feet oh hallelujah
[46:02] hallelujah
[46:05] hallelujah don't
[46:07] worry we're going to get to
[46:09] it well what is the
[46:12] L well in order for us to understand
[46:14] what the light is we'll have to go back
[46:17] to
[46:18] Genesis isn't that right amen we have to
[46:20] go back to that original light amen that
[46:24] God spoke in the beginning amen so let's
[46:26] go back now Genesis 1 says that when God
[46:30] made the heavens and the Earth that the
[46:32] Earth was without form and was was void
[46:37] and there was Darkness amen so here was
[46:41] three problems that we
[46:43] have the first problem is it without it
[46:45] was without form which means the Earth
[46:48] was uh in chaos it lay in ruin it lay
[46:53] confused it was messed up
[46:57] there was also another problem the Earth
[47:00] was void it was void of Life there was
[47:03] nothing in it try and imagine a world
[47:07] with no animal life no human life no
[47:11] living creature nothing in it just the
[47:14] deadness of Silence it was void of Life
[47:19] void of action void of movement oh
[47:22] hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right
[47:26] furthermore there was another
[47:28] problem there was also Darkness sir you
[47:32] couldn't see anything because there was
[47:35] nothing to see there was no light at all
[47:39] there was nothing anywhere oh hallelujah
[47:42] what a condition sounds like the
[47:45] condition that some people find
[47:46] themselves in void of life without form
[47:51] talk is all over can't find a space
[47:55] can't find nothing nothing P trying hard
[47:57] to pray feel like you can't find your
[48:00] way I feel that God is here this morning
[48:04] to do something different to speak a
[48:06] word in due season a spoken word in due
[48:12] season how good it
[48:14] is oh
[48:17] [Applause]
[48:23] hallelujah hallelujah
[48:27] hallelujah
[48:29] hallelujah so it's without form yes it
[48:33] was void
[48:34] empty and it was
[48:37] dark there was no light in there at
[48:40] all so then the only way God decided to
[48:43] move
[48:45] forward because even if he wanted to
[48:47] give the earth form we still have to see
[48:50] what we were
[48:52] doing and in order to deal with the
[48:55] voidness
[48:56] in order to deal with the emptiness we
[48:58] still have to see what we doing so there
[49:01] was a problem that he had to deal with
[49:04] this problem of Darkness Hallelujah
[49:06] stood in God's way of doing something
[49:09] about the Earth Hallelujah that he had
[49:11] created and in the earth he had created
[49:14] yes sir were seeds yes sir and those
[49:17] seeds were predestinated to bring forth
[49:19] life to bring forth herb yielding fruit
[49:23] to bring forth trees but they were over
[49:26] by this Darkness oh Hallelujah there was
[49:29] a void there was emptiness there was
[49:31] nothing oh hallelujah hallelujah and God
[49:35] looked at the darkness and he didn't
[49:37] argue with the darkness he didn't
[49:39] complain with the darkness he didn't
[49:41] have a meeting with the darkness he
[49:43] didn't issue a warrant to the darkness
[49:45] he didn't get sexs with the darkness he
[49:47] didn't get upset with the darkness he
[49:49] didn't get out of the atmosphere when he
[49:52] approached the darkness no no no no no
[49:54] oh God had to do was speak a
[49:59] word and God
[50:01] said let there be
[50:04] light God is not worried about the
[50:07] darkness this morning God just has to
[50:10] speak a word hallelujah his thoughts are
[50:14] not your thoughts his ways are not your
[50:17] ways his ways are higher his ways are
[50:21] thoughts but before it could become a
[50:23] word it had to be a thought so when God
[50:27] thought about it then he spoke it and
[50:30] said let there be
[50:33] light oh give the Lord a
[50:37] [Applause]
[50:43] shout huh let there be light let there
[50:47] be light this morning I don't care how

[1:00:12] you're going to get it praise God amen
[1:00:15] amen I believe it all my heart oh
[1:00:18] hallelujah
[1:00:20] amen amen oh
[1:00:22] hallelujah oh now
[1:00:25] he didn't argue with the darkness he
[1:00:27] simply spoke a word to the darkness and
[1:00:30] he said to the darkness let there be
[1:00:32] light Hallelujah and there was light
[1:00:35] isn't that right Hallelujah there was no
[1:00:38] more argument there was no more fuss
[1:00:41] there was no more debate all of the
[1:00:43] chaos all of the ruin was dealt with
[1:00:46] Hallelujah in the first F when he spoke
[1:00:49] let there be light isn't that right amen
[1:00:53] hallelujah G now what is
[1:00:56] Darkness Darkness is defined as the
[1:00:59] absence of
[1:01:01] light so when there is no light then
[1:01:05] ultimately we get Darkness isn't that
[1:01:07] right amen when there's no presence of
[1:01:09] light when there's no other positive
[1:01:12] influence the only other default
[1:01:14] position is Darkness isn't that right
[1:01:18] Hallelujah it means and it was such an
[1:01:21] encouragement to me as I studied this
[1:01:23] here it means that if darkness is the
[1:01:26] absence of light then that means
[1:01:28] darkness is not really an actual
[1:01:30] Force Hallelujah darkness is not really
[1:01:34] an
[1:01:35] energy light has the energy the prophet
[1:01:38] said from light comes life but out of
[1:01:42] Darkness nothing can
[1:01:46] come it means that when we turn on a
[1:01:49] light Darkness has to find its
[1:01:53] place
[1:01:56] it means that the devil this morning
[1:01:59] doesn't really have any
[1:02:02] power he has no
[1:02:05] power over the Blood Washed ones because
[1:02:09] where there is
[1:02:10] light Darkness got to fly on
[1:02:14] back death must know its Master because
[1:02:18] the kings of the Earth have come back to
[1:02:21] take back from the enemy what he took
[1:02:24] from us he took our children we're going
[1:02:27] to take it back if he took your joy
[1:02:30] we're going to take it right back and if
[1:02:33] there's darkness in your life if there's
[1:02:35] darkness in your home this morning let
[1:02:39] there be
[1:02:40] light oh
[1:02:42] hallelujah
[1:02:44] hallelujah oh yes oh yes Satan is
[1:02:49] powerless this
[1:02:50] morning the devil is confused this
[1:02:53] morning there's nothing he can do
[1:02:55] because when a light comes forth the
[1:02:58] darkness has to find its place the
[1:03:01] darkness has to be pushed back the maker
[1:03:03] of the earth is here to let you know
[1:03:07] that he is here to begin his Reign he is
[1:03:09] here to take control of your situation
[1:03:13] maybe it's too hard maybe it's too
[1:03:15] powerful but there's no power like our
[1:03:18] God he is the original Power he is the
[1:03:22] original
[1:03:23] life
[1:03:28] [Applause]
[1:03:31] Hallelujah that's why the Bible says
[1:03:34] resist the devil and he'll flee from you
[1:03:38] we'll split him seven ways praise God
[1:03:41] because a light of God scatters the
[1:03:44] Cockroaches scatters the Devils left and
[1:03:48] right Hallelujah and the light produces
[1:03:52] a
[1:03:53] life
[1:03:55] oh and our life is Jesus Christ and our
[1:03:59] life is seven Thunders that holds the
[1:04:03] mystery of the coming of the Lord and if
[1:04:06] these things be new and abound you shall
[1:04:08] neither be buried nor unfruitful in the
[1:04:12] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04:14] escaping the world that is corruption
[1:04:18] through
[1:04:19] lust
[1:04:21] hallelujah oh my
[1:04:26] Glory my God
[1:04:29] hallelujah
[1:04:31] oh I don't
[1:04:34] know my holy spirit is here you just
[1:04:37] ride the anointing amen he just dropped
[1:04:40] down already The Devil Is On The Run the
[1:04:43] devil is running praise God probably
[1:04:46] reach Bo's tongue by now I see him on
[1:04:49] the way out praise God you have the
[1:04:51] victory this morning you have the
[1:04:53] victory right now oh hallelujah praise
[1:04:56] God Amen
[1:05:01] Hallelujah
[1:05:05] my huh so the power of that light is
[1:05:09] more powerful than the power of
[1:05:12] Darkness it's not really a
[1:05:15] power but where there's no light the
[1:05:17] defa position is Darkness so where
[1:05:20] there's no positive influence in the
[1:05:22] community young boys well you know what
[1:05:24] they get up to amen get up to trouble
[1:05:27] stealing robbing weed whatever that's
[1:05:31] default that's a natural position that's
[1:05:33] a normal position when there's no
[1:05:35] positive influence because we were born
[1:05:38] in sin shaped in iniquity and come into
[1:05:41] the world speaking lies so therefore
[1:05:43] some higher power some higher influence
[1:05:48] has to influence
[1:05:49] us not from here but from above
[1:05:54] not on the ground level but something
[1:05:57] from up there a vision we got to be
[1:06:00] caught up in to catch a higher realm to
[1:06:04] be in a higher place to see what's
[1:06:06] coming to see what God is trying to show
[1:06:09] us oh Hallelujah glory to God Amen young
[1:06:14] people it makes you walk different when
[1:06:17] you see it from a different perspective
[1:06:19] cuz all the time you're seeing it from
[1:06:22] your eyes how you feel how you are going
[1:06:26] through and what what's going in your
[1:06:27] mind but when you raise up into the mind
[1:06:31] of God into his purpose into his program
[1:06:35] and what he wants for your life then it
[1:06:38] changes the way you walk changes the way
[1:06:41] you talk changes the way you see things
[1:06:44] changes the way you approach this gospel
[1:06:47] this word praise God because you're
[1:06:49] operating by God's divine
[1:06:53] revelation Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah
[1:06:57] up in that second round amen thank you
[1:06:59] Lord glory god speaking to you God Amen
[1:07:02] now watch now watch he said now let
[1:07:06] there be light okay so God is the
[1:07:08] original
[1:07:10] Power God is the original light that
[1:07:12] came forth and darkness had to find its
[1:07:15] place so when God said let it be light
[1:07:18] God saw it was light amen isn't that
[1:07:20] right now this light is not a natural
[1:07:23] light remember the Nick Genesis
[1:07:26] 1:12 to 24 this light is not a natural
[1:07:30] light that we're talking about but this
[1:07:32] is a supernatural light am remember he
[1:07:34] spoke it in the beginning am but when we
[1:07:36] go down to uh Genesis 1 12 uh to 14 amen
[1:07:41] can you find it amen we put it up amen
[1:07:43] so you'll see it and God said let there
[1:07:46] be lights in the firmaments of the
[1:07:47] heaven to divide the day for the night
[1:07:50] and let them be for signs and for
[1:07:52] seasons and for days days and years and
[1:07:55] let them be for light in the firment of
[1:07:57] the heaven to give light upon the Earth
[1:08:00] and it was so and God made two great
[1:08:02] lights the greater light to Rule the Day
[1:08:05] and the Lesser light to rule the night
[1:08:07] and he made the Stars also amen thank
[1:08:10] you so that what we're talking about is
[1:08:13] the sun that's the moon that's the Stars
[1:08:17] that's the light he give for times
[1:08:19] that's a light he give for season that's
[1:08:21] a light he give for years but in order
[1:08:23] for was to do his work in the beginning
[1:08:26] there was a light that came before all
[1:08:27] those
[1:08:28] lights that's the light we're talking
[1:08:30] about this morning I'm not talking about
[1:08:32] a natural light but I'm talking about
[1:08:35] the light he spoke in the beginning that
[1:08:38] is the original light not the s n light
[1:08:42] but the s o n light that is a light you
[1:08:45] feel this morning in this Tabernacle
[1:08:49] That's What trapped down this
[1:08:51] morning
[1:08:52] Hallelujah the original light glory to
[1:08:56] God now
[1:08:58] watch that was the Sun the moon the
[1:09:00] stars but he said let there be light and
[1:09:03] then he said he let that light be
[1:09:05] separated from all other lights because
[1:09:08] after he saw that light he said this
[1:09:11] light is good and after that the Bible
[1:09:14] said he separated the light from the
[1:09:18] darkness so anything outside of the and
[1:09:22] light is Darkness
[1:09:24] but Bram said let every man's word be a
[1:09:27] lie and let God's word be
[1:09:30] true and if God spoke it it's got to
[1:09:33] happen because that is the original
[1:09:36] light he was that light he was the light
[1:09:39] of all men and the word became flesh and
[1:09:43] that flesh dwell among us and we beheld
[1:09:46] his glory the same Glory that spoke the
[1:09:49] Earth in the beginning that same Glory
[1:09:52] dwelt Among Us and he said when you see
[1:09:55] me you see that
[1:09:58] light when you see me you see the Father
[1:10:03] the father in me and on that day you
[1:10:05] shall know I am in my father the father
[1:10:09] will be in me and I will be in you and
[1:10:12] you in me what day this
[1:10:17] [Applause]
[1:10:18] day oh
[1:10:20] [Music]
[1:10:21] Hallelujah that was the original l
[1:10:24] now ride with me now we're going
[1:10:26] somewhere that was the original light it
[1:10:29] took the light to declare the day
[1:10:31] because when God saw the light he said
[1:10:33] that that light was good amen he was
[1:10:36] pleased with that light he rejoiced with
[1:10:38] that light he was uh he was happy about
[1:10:41] that light and he called that light day
[1:10:45] and he called The Darkness night so
[1:10:48] anything that is outside of the dark
[1:10:50] outside of the light that's in the
[1:10:51] darkness that's in the night time
[1:10:54] Hallelujah that's out there but God
[1:10:56] separated it light from Darkness day
[1:10:59] from night isn't that right hallelujah
[1:11:02] hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right
[1:11:05] glory and the the morning and the
[1:11:07] evening was the first day isn't that
[1:11:08] right evening and the morning rather
[1:11:11] amen so here it
[1:11:13] was amen you love him this morning amen
[1:11:16] the prophet said now he said the son is
[1:11:19] the king of all the lights on this Earth
[1:11:21] in a natural light no matter how much
[1:11:23] artificial light that we can have and
[1:11:25] how many great electric Rays we can
[1:11:27] produce he said but when that sun rises
[1:11:31] all the rest of them dim out that's the
[1:11:34] same thing with the word of God he said
[1:11:36] when the word of God Rises all of the
[1:11:40] superstitions all of the denominational
[1:11:42] fanaticisms and things spread away and
[1:11:46] it shows just exactly what it is God in
[1:11:49] the beginning said let there be light
[1:11:53] and the light light only comes the True
[1:11:55] Light the king light only comes by the
[1:11:58] word of God he had to speak it then a
[1:12:02] manifestation can take place afterwards
[1:12:05] isn't that right the light of God only
[1:12:07] comes by the word of God isn't that
[1:12:12] right Hallelujah isn't that right God
[1:12:14] separated the light from the darkness in
[1:12:17] the beginning and the word of God was
[1:12:20] made manifest and always separates the
[1:12:23] light from the darkness I'll say that
[1:12:25] again the word of God made manifest
[1:12:30] always separates the light from the
[1:12:33] darkness hallelujah hallelujah the word
[1:12:36] of God when made manifest always
[1:12:40] separates the light from the darkness
[1:12:44] when the word of God produces a life
[1:12:46] when the word of God produces another
[1:12:48] Ephesians when the word of God produces
[1:12:51] another original Church another the
[1:12:53] original Branch then it separates
[1:12:56] everything else from itself praise God
[1:13:00] then it comes back to the original that
[1:13:03] I don't care what
[1:13:04] fanaticism what they preach what they
[1:13:06] say God will always point you back to
[1:13:10] the word back to the original the
[1:13:13] original light the original life the
[1:13:17] original Holy Fire that fell on the day
[1:13:19] of Pentecost that's what we going back
[1:13:22] to
[1:13:24] that is the day that we are living in
[1:13:27] right
[1:13:27] now it's got to come back to the
[1:13:30] original

[1:13:57] watchall he said now separate the light
[1:14:00] from the darkness right so the word of
[1:14:02] God made manifest I want to drive this
[1:14:05] down the word of God made
[1:14:08] manifest always separates the light from
[1:14:10] the darkness so we've got to have a
[1:14:12] burden this morning Amen to become a
[1:14:15] manifestation amen because God is
[1:14:17] longing to reproduce himself in Sons and
[1:14:21] Daughters of God so God is Not happy God
[1:14:24] is not satisfied until we become a
[1:14:27] manifestation of this then when we
[1:14:30] Manifest this when we manifest St John

[1:25:17] oh
[1:25:19] wonderful now he says
[1:25:23] just like in each age God has foretold
[1:25:25] us what would take place in each age the
[1:25:27] only thing he needs is a manifestation
[1:25:29] of the light upon that
[1:25:31] scripture isn't that right the
[1:25:34] manifestation of the light needs to come
[1:25:36] upon second Peter 1 14-7 to come upon
[1:25:39] Revelation
[1:25:40] 22:17 the manifestation of the light
[1:25:43] isn't that right to make it live for
[1:25:46] that age and it would do it as long as a
[1:25:49] light can get to the word as long as a
[1:25:53] light can get to that seed in your soul
[1:25:56] then it then something happens something
[1:25:59] reacts because it's a Lord that's put
[1:26:01] into
[1:26:03] motion isn't that right remember in the
[1:26:06] days of
[1:26:07] Wesley they were so Sanctified yes that
[1:26:10] the Holy Ghost would want to fall upon
[1:26:12] the people that they would want to
[1:26:14] baptize them but it wasn't the days yet
[1:26:17] for that to happen so they would throw
[1:26:19] buckets on the people I think it was
[1:26:21] isn't that right to get him out of the
[1:26:23] spirit before that take place because if
[1:26:25] it did it would change a season but what
[1:26:28] that showed us is that there's a Lord
[1:26:30] that's put into motion Hallelujah that
[1:26:32] every time you meet God's requirements
[1:26:35] every time you meet God's conditions you
[1:26:38] in the right conditions then certain
[1:26:41] things will take place and if you are
[1:26:44] Sanctified If You Are Holy then the holy
[1:26:47] spirit is very attracted it's very
[1:26:51] excited about a person like that it
[1:26:54] wants to fall upon him oh Hallelujah
[1:26:58] because it's a
[1:26:59] law that's put into motion if my people
[1:27:04] shall humble themselves and pray and
[1:27:07] seek my face and turn from their Wicked
[1:27:10] Ways then I will hear from Heaven I will
[1:27:13] he forgive their sin I will heal their
[1:27:16] land that's God's word and he will
[1:27:20] manifest it amen
[1:27:22] [Applause]
[1:27:23] [Music]
[1:27:25] oh when God's people begin to pray for
[1:27:29] the Lord to have his way then the spirit
[1:27:32] of the Lord is coming down when you
[1:27:35] begin to get into obedience to the whole
[1:27:38] word of God to everything that God told
[1:27:41] you to do Hallelujah your ABCs always
[1:27:45] believe Christ Sanctified holy
[1:27:48] separating yourself from all unbelief
[1:27:52] when you begin to do that the Holy Ghost
[1:27:55] the same holy spirit that fell on the
[1:27:57] day of Pentecost is obligated to meet
[1:28:00] you on the basis of his promised
[1:28:04] [Applause]
[1:28:05] word
[1:28:08] [Applause]

[1:28:21] morning
[1:28:22] oh my time is just
[1:28:26] going but the holy spirit is here and
[1:28:29] that's all right and that's okay because
[1:28:32] if somebody's delivered then the work of
[1:28:34] God is finished doesn't matter what I
[1:28:36] have written here but the work of God
[1:28:38] must be accomplished this morning
[1:28:40] somebody's going to go free somebody's
[1:28:42] going to be inspired somebody this week
[1:28:45] is going to called on fire glory to God
[1:28:48] hallelujah somebody this week is going
[1:28:51] to break back past the natural going to
[1:28:53] go into the holies of holies they're
[1:28:55] going to go into their PR closet oh
[1:28:58] Hallelujah you the devil's going to see
[1:29:01] something then
[1:29:02] brother the devil's got another thing
[1:29:05] coming when you begin to get into your
[1:29:07] place when you begin to get into the
[1:29:08] right atmosphere in the right condition
[1:29:11] God will speak from heaven and this
[1:29:14] world will hear direct from
[1:29:17] God amen amen and there is another
[1:29:21] people in the land
[1:29:22] who under the Messenger will be the
[1:29:25] final voice to the final age and the
[1:29:28] final Junction of time right down in the
[1:29:31] evening time there shall be
[1:29:34] light oh
[1:29:36] Hallelujah glory glory to
[1:29:40] God
[1:29:42] amen
[1:29:44] amen oh let me hurry along here
[1:29:47] now he said you might plant wheat you
[1:29:49] might plant wheat at one time or grain
[1:29:52] at another time some come slower than
[1:29:55] others because it depends on the season
[1:29:57] but God's word comes in a season amen
[1:30:01] isn't that right the law and the grace
[1:30:03] and so forth as we went on Through the
[1:30:05] Ages and each time it is lit up by the
[1:30:09] manifestation of the light spreading
[1:30:11] forth the life that is in the seed amen
[1:30:15] the life comes from the light isn't that
[1:30:16] right and we realize that God's light of
[1:30:19] the day is his son the one was s n but
[1:30:23] this one was s o n s o n is the Bible
[1:30:28] isn't that right he was in the beginning
[1:30:31] was a word and the Word was with God and
[1:30:34] the Word was God Hebrews 138 he's the
[1:30:37] same yesterday today and forever it's
[1:30:40] the word of God always it was Christ
[1:30:43] that was in Noah it was Christ that was
[1:30:46] in Moses it was Christ in David that
[1:30:49] looked up as a rejected King upon the
[1:30:51] city where 800 years later Christ sat
[1:30:54] there weeping over a city being himself
[1:30:57] a rejected King just like David was
[1:31:00] isn't that right it was always the
[1:31:02] spirit of Christ and the full
[1:31:05] manifestation of God's word made known
[1:31:09] through Jesus Christ is the spirit of
[1:31:12] God and that's what they were doing
[1:31:15] that's the reason they did that because
[1:31:16] they were living now watch he's talking
[1:31:18] about something else now he's talking
[1:31:20] about amen people got qu of
[1:31:22] interpretation he said they're living in
[1:31:24] the glare of another light amen or
[1:31:26] they're living in the glare of a past
[1:31:28] light isn't that right they're living in
[1:31:30] the glare of the light of another day
[1:31:33] and that's what I believe he said is a
[1:31:35] matter with the world today friends is
[1:31:38] because we're trying to live in the
[1:31:39] glare of a light that shined in another
[1:31:42] day a glare is a false light just like a
[1:31:46] mirage on the road he said we go down
[1:31:48] the road and we see a mirage it's a
[1:31:51] false conception of the Sun and when you
[1:31:55] get there it hasn't produced a thing but
[1:31:57] something false because you cannot walk
[1:32:00] in the glare of the sun because it's a
[1:32:02] mirage always showing you something that
[1:32:04] there's nothing to and when people try
[1:32:07] to tell you that Jesus Christ isn't the
[1:32:09] same yesterday today and forever they're
[1:32:12] leading you to a
[1:32:14] mirage anytime someone preaches
[1:32:16] something that is outside of this gospel
[1:32:20] outside of this Bible outside of the
[1:32:23] correct interpretation they are leading
[1:32:25] you into a
[1:32:26] mirage that's all and when you get into
[1:32:30] church and then you join maybe a church
[1:32:33] or some cold Creed or something like
[1:32:34] that there's nothing there no more than
[1:32:37] what you had in the world from
[1:32:39] separation from unbelief the Bible says
[1:32:42] oh we believe that God is a great God
[1:32:45] yes and we read back there where he was
[1:32:47] with the people back 2,000 years ago the
[1:32:50] prophet said that's intellectual
[1:32:52] that's something that God did that's
[1:32:54] like a man he said freezing to death and
[1:32:57] a paint him and we paint him a big fire
[1:33:00] on the wall and say look what a
[1:33:03] beautiful fire that was see this picture
[1:33:06] here well he had a fire to come look how
[1:33:09] everybody was getting warm but everybody
[1:33:11] was getting warm then but what about you
[1:33:14] you can't get warmed by a painted fire
[1:33:18] you've got to have the fire itself
[1:33:22] oh Hallelujah so we are not here this
[1:33:25] morning to preach painted fires we not
[1:33:29] here this morning what we are here is to

[1:33:35] now Faith is for your deliverance right
[1:33:39] now for your healing right now for your
[1:33:43] salvation right now the people need God
[1:33:47] today not a god of yesterday not a god
[1:33:50] of tomorrow we need God right now right
[1:33:54] now in this place not a painted fire but
[1:33:58] the fire of God itself the fire of God
[1:34:01] to burn in your heart burn in your soul

[1:45:17] the day that we are living in and this
[1:45:19] day Omega Pride Day means back to the
[1:45:23] word back to the Bible back to the
[1:45:26] original back to the foundation that was
[1:45:28] laid on the day of Pentecost oh when the
[1:45:32] day of Pentecost was fully come there
[1:45:34] wasn't one mind there wasn't one Accord
[1:45:38] why because the word of God was open to
[1:45:40] them they were with Jesus 30 40 days and
[1:45:44] he unlocked their thinking he unlocked
[1:45:46] their minds as to who they were who God
[1:45:49] was who the devil was and they knew by
[1:45:53] Revelation what they had to receive and
[1:45:56] they were there praying continually in
[1:45:59] the spirit and in those days Peter stood
[1:46:02] up among them and said this Jesus of
[1:46:06] whom we were Witnesses who were slain on
[1:46:08] a cross and hung on a tree to die is now
[1:46:12] exalted at the right hand of God and he
[1:46:14] told us to T in Jerusalem and pray
[1:46:17] without ceasing and stay under
[1:46:19] expectation
[1:46:21] and Peter and them by inspiration begin
[1:46:24] to put the church in order and they cast
[1:46:27] lots and Maas was counted with them
[1:46:29] isn't that right but the Bible said that
[1:46:32] when the day of Pentecost was fully come
[1:46:35] they were in one mind they would want
[1:46:37] Accord and all of a sudden all of a
[1:46:41] sudden they heard a sound come from
[1:46:44] Heaven sound of a Russian Mighty Wind
[1:46:47] that sound swept into the house and we
[1:46:50] get to baptize individuals into the
[1:46:53] kingdom of God everyone receive their
[1:46:57] lick of fire this morning we come to
[1:47:01] receive our own lick of fire we are not

[1:54:33] the very one that they thought they were
[1:54:35] worshiping they were crucified they were
[1:54:37] making fun of the very God and making

[1:55:11] Jesus said and we're living later than
[1:55:13] we think many honest people follow that
[1:55:17] not even knowing what they're doing but
[1:55:19] the hour is at hand now the prophet said
[1:55:22] oh here what going to strike when the

[1:55:46] things that he promised for this day
[1:55:48] must happen in this day if the church
[1:55:52] won't accept it then God is able of
[1:55:54] these stones to raise up children unto
[1:55:58] Abraham so if you don't want it God will

[2:00:53] but then here he come Wesley with a
[2:00:55] message of sanctification yes sir not
[2:00:57] only must it be justification but
[2:00:59] sanctification also Hallelujah sanctify
[2:01:01] yourselves set yourself for service
[2:01:04] praise God amen amen isn't that right
[2:01:07] and when that rose up it was a greater
[2:01:09] light Hallelujah and the Gospel Light
[2:01:11] kept moving on but then they organize
[2:01:14] and then down come the Pentecostals in
[2:01:17] the open door age and introduce the
[2:01:19] birth and the gifts and that was an even
[2:01:22] greater light receive the Holy Ghost oh
[2:01:25] H you must be born again born of the
[2:01:29] spirit Hallelujah isn't that right
[2:01:32] Hallelujah but when the prophet Malachi
[2:01:34] 4 came he introduced the fullness of the
[2:01:37] word so brother what day are we living
[2:01:39] in if we are living in a day when the
[2:01:43] son of man is being revealed and the
[2:01:45] fullness of the word is here am then
[2:01:47] that means we have what it takes
[2:01:49] we have all the revealing of the seals
[2:01:52] to unlock the fullness of the spirit
[2:01:55] upon a bride once more this world will
[2:01:58] hear direct from
[2:02:00] God there'll be a people in the land
[2:02:03] another people who will do just what
[2:02:06] that first church did it'll be another
[2:02:09] Pentecost there'll be another Revival
[2:02:12] there'll be another Spiritual Awakening
[2:02:14] and it will happen right in the evening
[2:02:16] time right when the devil thinks he's
[2:02:18] got everything on the Earth right when
[2:02:21] the devil thinks he's got him Bound in
[2:02:23] Creeds and in dogmas right in the middle
[2:02:26] of all of that God will raise up a bride
[2:02:30] with power and
[2:02:32] demonstration backing up the Devils
[2:02:35] hallelujah praise
[2:02:38] God hallelujah say to this mountain be
[2:02:42] moved and don't doubt in your heart you
[2:02:45] can have whatever you ask for ask you

[2:03:16] what's going to take place these same
[2:03:18] young people people who you thought was
[2:03:20] all broken up and all twisted up God the
[2:03:23] prophet said we'll do in one year what
[2:03:25] all theologians fail to do in 2,000
[2:03:29] years because it won't be a work of man
[2:03:32] it won't be an intellectual workup but
[2:03:34] it'll be the ministry of the spirit
[2:03:36] quickening the word to the bride making
[2:03:40] you ready for the
[2:03:42] Rapture
[2:03:44] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:03:46] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:03:49] so I say this morning the time has come
[2:03:52] for the word to be made flesh the time
[2:03:55] has come for the light of God the
[2:03:58] manifestation of the Holy Spirit am to
[2:04:00] shine for the light of God isn't that
[2:04:01] right amen oh praise God hallelujah
[2:04:05] praise God
[2:04:06] hallelujah praise God
[2:04:09] hallelujah oh
[2:04:13] my the prophet said but if that tree
[2:04:16] keep praising him now but if that tree
[2:04:18] ever puts forth another original Branch
[2:04:22] it will bear its original Fruit the same
[2:04:25] fruit that was on Pentecost healings
[2:04:27] sealings deliverances baptism of the
[2:04:30] Holy Ghost it will bear the original
[2:04:33] Fruit and there's got to be a
[2:04:35] restoration of all these
[2:04:38] things right at the end of the
[2:04:41] vine the prophet said here's prophecy
[2:04:43] prophecy he said there is to come forth
[2:04:47] or restoration
[2:04:49] and evening light to light it up and
[2:04:52] make it right but it will come out of
[2:04:56] the
[2:04:57] vine not a denomination that's crafted
[2:04:59] into it but the original production of
[2:05:02] the word it is to comfort for the
[2:05:05] evening time there will be a light in
[2:05:08] the evening time it takes light to ripen
[2:05:11] it see how perfect the scripture is a
[2:05:14] day that won't be called day or night
[2:05:16] fruit cannot ripen here it is until the
[2:05:19] sun ripens it no matter how much you
[2:05:22] preach whatever you do it cannot be
[2:05:25] ripened it cannot be manifested it
[2:05:28] cannot be Vindicated only by him who
[2:05:31] said I am the light of the world the
[2:05:34] word isn't that right am so there it is
[2:05:37] it come forth as a
[2:05:43] power the prophet said therefore it has
[2:05:47] to come forth as a power the Holy Spirit
[2:05:52] himself not the work of man not men
[2:05:55] adopting one another nonsense but the
[2:05:58] Holy Spirit himself must ripen to
[2:06:02] vindicate and prove and manifest that
[2:06:05] what he said would
[2:06:07] happen oh glory to God the Holy Ghost is
[2:06:13] going to come forth in your heart in
[2:06:16] your life in your soul in this church as
[2:06:19] a power and anoint your soul the same

[2:06:44] Ephesians the prophet said on a paradox
[2:06:49] there must come another Ephesians to
[2:06:51] this another original church will have
[2:06:55] the same signs that Jesus had in the
[2:06:58] beginning we have the same signs that
[2:07:01] the apostles had in the beginning it was
[2:07:03] not the work of the Apostles but it was
