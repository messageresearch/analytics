[35:18] your Bibles I like listen into Matthew
[35:20] 25 want to read from verse 13 to 30
[35:28] Matthew
[35:30] 25 I know we have been here but again
[35:33] instructed and Andrew shares things on
[35:35] it but here we are again tonight watch
[35:38] therefore for you know neither the day
[35:40] nor the hour wherein the son of man
[35:42] cometh for the Kingdom of Heaven is as a
[35:45] man traveling into a far country who
[35:48] called his own servants and delivered
[35:50] unto them his
[35:52] goods and unto one he give five talents
[35:54] to another two to another one to to
[35:57] every man according to his several
[36:00] ability and straightway took his journey
[36:03] then he that received the 5 talents went
[36:06] and traded with the same and made them
[36:08] other five talents likewise he that had
[36:11] received two he also gained another two
[36:15] and he that had received one went and
[36:17] died in the earth and hid the Lord's
[36:19] money after a long time the Lord of
[36:22] whose servants cometh and reckon it with
[36:25] them so he came he that had received
[36:28] five talents came brought other five
[36:30] talents in Lord thou deliver unto me
[36:33] five talents behold I've gained besze
[36:35] them five ttimes more his lord said unto
[36:38] him well done thou good and faithful
[36:40] servant thou has a few thou has been
[36:43] Faithful over a few things I will make
[36:45] the ruler over many things enter into
[36:48] the joy of the Lord he also that had
[36:51] received two talents came and said Lord
[36:53] thou deliver unto me two talents behold
[36:56] I have gained two other talents besides
[36:58] them his lord said unto him well done
[37:01] thou good and faithful servant thou has
[37:03] been Faithful over a few things I will
[37:05] make the ruler over many things enter
[37:07] into the joy of the Lord and that then
[37:10] he which had received one Talent came
[37:13] and said Lord I knew that thee that thou
[37:15] art a hard man reaping where thou has
[37:16] not shown and Gathering where thou has
[37:19] not stred and I was afraid and went and
[37:22] hid thy talent in the earth Lo here thou
[37:25] Hast that is dine his Lord answer answer
[37:27] said and said unto him thou Wicked and
[37:29] full servant thou knewest that I
[37:32] reap where I SED not gathered where I
[37:34] have not sted thou oughtest therefore to
[37:37] have put my money into the exchanges and
[37:40] then at my coming I should have received
[37:42] my own with Usery take therefore the
[37:46] talent from him and give it unto him
[37:49] which had 10 talents for every one that
[37:52] ha shall be given and he shall have
[37:54] abundance but from him that hath not
[37:57] shall be taken away even that which he
[38:00] had and cast ye the unprofitable servant
[38:04] into outer Darkness there shall be
[38:06] weeping and nashing of teeth may God
[38:07] bless his word you may be seated praise
[38:10] God thanks for coming out tonight we not
[38:12] gathered together in vain we're not
[38:13] preaching the word in vain we're not
[38:15] speaking these things in vain and the
[38:17] title have tonight is watch therefore
[38:19] for you know not neither the day nor the
[38:23] hour and uh I believe this is a very
[38:26] important session tonight so just listen
[38:29] closely to what we we'll see what the
[38:31] Lord will says now in the Amplified
[38:34] verse 13 says watch
[38:36] therefore give strict attention and be
[38:39] cautious and active for you know nether
[38:43] the day nor the are when the son of man
[38:46] will come and in verse 23 see MiFi his
[38:51] master said to him well done you upright
[38:55] honorable admirable and faithful servant
[38:58] you have been faithful and trustworthy
[39:01] over a little I will put you in charge
[39:04] of much enter into the share and share
[39:08] the joy the Delight the blessedness
[39:12] which your master enjoys and Matthew
[39:16] 2529 it says for everyone who has will
[39:20] more be given and he will be furnished
[39:23] richly so that he will have an abundance
[39:27] but from the one who does not have even
[39:31] what he does have will be taken away
[39:34] verse 30 and throw the good forn nothing
[39:37] servant into outer Darkness there'll be
[39:40] weeping and grinding of teeth I have a
[39:44] question tonight why should God give
[39:48] more than you can
[39:51] manage
[39:53] why why should God give you more than
[39:57] you can manage because in the scripture
[40:01] we read unto one he give five talents to
[40:04] another to another one to every another
[40:08] two and another one to every man
[40:11] according to his several ability and
[40:14] straight where he took his
[40:16] journey and the thing about it the gift
[40:19] is
[40:20] there the talent is there but what it is
[40:24] what you do with it the talent
[40:28] the gift that God has given because God
[40:31] by discernment didn't give them more
[40:33] than they have the ability to manage
[40:35] because what was happening there is a
[40:37] test what was happening there is
[40:39] faithful test faithfulness what was
[40:42] happening there is God was giving them
[40:44] the little to see how they manag what he
[40:46] give them because based upon how you
[40:50] manage what God give you or what God
[40:53] give you as a talent or whatever
[40:55] blessing God could promote you and give
[40:57] you more am to
[41:00] manage now this scripture about the read
[41:02] here Ephesians 4 is a familiar scripture
[41:04] Paul speak I therefore the prison of the
[41:06] Lord beseech you you walk worthy of the
[41:08] vocation where you are called with all
[41:10] loneliness and meekness with
[41:11] longsuffering forbearing in love
[41:14] enduring endeavoring to keep the unity
[41:16] of the spirit in the bond of peace
[41:18] there's one body one Spirit your calling
[41:22] one hope of your calling one Lord One
[41:24] Faith one baptism one
[41:28] God and Father of us all who is above
[41:30] all through all in you all but this part
[41:31] I want to get to but unto every one of
[41:34] us is given Grace according to the
[41:37] measure of the gift of Christ so
[41:40] everyone according to Paul's scripture
[41:42] here have Grace according to the measure
[41:45] of the gift of Christ and that scripture
[41:48] in yet Grace God's unmerited favor was
[41:53] given to each of us individually not
[41:56] indiscriminately but but in different
[41:57] ways in proportion to the measure of
[42:00] Christ rich and bounous gift here we go
[42:04] are you with me this tonight so
[42:07] therefore these gifts and these talents
[42:09] and these several abilities that God
[42:11] give us is like a starting
[42:14] point and I calling it a temporary
[42:19] position note these words now a
[42:22] temporary position the gift or Talent
[42:27] gives you a temporary position that is
[42:32] connected to a time
[42:35] element so it's not you have a gift and
[42:37] you have a talent and 10 years 20 years
[42:39] 30 years 40 years pass 100 years pass
[42:41] it's not like that because when these
[42:44] guys was given the gifts and talents the
[42:46] man went away on a long journey they
[42:48] don't they know NE not the hour he would
[42:51] come whenever the master come he come
[42:54] for a reconing or come to account
[42:57] what was given you what was gifted to
[43:00] you what was talented to you that time
[43:04] period I like to use this word call this
[43:07] time a time of
[43:10] probation probation to see what you will
[43:15] do not to see the excuses you
[43:19] make I'm
[43:21] stuck not my job there's a problem
[43:24] someone else to fix I'm not good at this
[43:28] I'll get it eventually
[43:30] excuses the asking is what was done with
[43:36] what was given to you amen the
[43:40] talent the gift the measure are you with
[43:44] me
[43:46] tonight your testimony God give me or
[43:51] God give you or God revealed to me or
[43:54] God blessed you and God's not with you
[43:57] and 20 years God heal you that is not
[44:00] the issue at
[44:01] hand you know you have a gift you know
[44:05] it's from God but the gift is not the
[44:09] issue you know without a doubt that God
[44:12] has forgiven you but what have you done
[44:14] with the
[44:15] Forgiveness that God
[44:17] has given you and the reason I bring out
[44:20] this one is because it's a story in the
[44:22] Bible that addresses this not because
[44:25] somebody is Forgiven and they get
[44:27] blessed and they uh forgiveness they use
[44:30] it correctly listen to this here though
[44:33] Jesus speaks Matthew 18 therefore is the
[44:35] Kingdom of Heaven lik un to a certain
[44:36] King which would take account of his
[44:46] servants uh one was brought unto him
[44:48] which owed him 10,000 talents but for as
[44:51] much as he had not to pay his Lord
[44:53] commanded to be sold his wife children
[44:56] all that he had had payment to be made
[44:58] the servant fell down and worshiped him
[45:00] saying Lord have patience with me I will
[45:02] pay thee all then the Lord of that
[45:04] servant was moved with
[45:07] compassion loosed him and forgive him of
[45:10] the
[45:11] debt the same servant not another one
[45:16] same man same servant went out and found
[45:19] one of his fellow servants which owed
[45:22] him 100 P now bear in mind he was owing
[45:26] 10 ,000 Talent well I had the conversion
[45:29] of that there a lot of
[45:31] money and his friend or fellow servant
[45:34] owed him a 100 P he laid hands upon Him
[45:39] took him by the throat man the man gone
[45:43] under V he under violence now took him
[45:46] at the said pay me what the O is and his
[45:49] fellow servant fell down at his feet and
[45:51] besought him saying have patience with
[45:53] me I will pay thee all but and he would
[45:56] not and went and cast him into prison
[45:58] till he should pay the debt so when this
[46:01] fellow servants saw what was done they
[46:04] were very sorry and came and told the
[46:05] Lord all what was done then his Lord
[46:09] after that he had called him said oh
[46:12] thou Wicked servant I forgive thee all
[46:14] that debt because thou desirest me
[46:17] shouldest not thou have compassion on
[46:20] thy fellow servant even as I had pity on
[46:22] thee his Lord was wrought and delivered
[46:25] him to the tormentors till he should pay
[46:27] all that will you unto him so likewise
[46:30] this is Jesus talking
[46:32] now shall my heavenly father do also
[46:36] unto
[46:37] you if ye from your heart forgive not
[46:41] everyone his brother their
[46:44] trespasses well give the Lord some
[46:46] Praises
[46:48] tonight so having a testimony God called
[46:52] me I know I'm a seed I'm a child I'm a
[46:56] gift when God call me somebody take a
[46:58] picture it have a light it have a
[46:59] rainbow a RB on my head a on my foot all
[47:02] that is fine but that's not the
[47:06] issue it comes back to what you do and
[47:10] how you do with what is given to you so
[47:15] I believe this temporary place that God
[47:17] gives is
[47:18] misunderstood this temporary place
[47:20] remember the disciples how much he had
[47:22] A2 of them and 70 of them walk away and
[47:25] all of them were given the anointing to
[47:27] share in the ministry of Jesus Christ
[47:29] they were not yet converted they had
[47:32] temporary power but they could testify
[47:34] oh I cast out a devil and they can
[47:37] testify to their friends all what
[47:38] they're doing and they working with
[47:39] Jesus and what it sounds good it sounds
[47:42] great and we jacket like Jesus a tie
[47:44] like Jesus a shoes like Jesus a sandle
[47:46] like Jesus all that is good but that's
[47:48] not the
[47:50] issue so disciples were given power
[47:53] to over the devils and cast
[47:57] diseases so it comes down now to our
[48:01] behavior and people find themselves
[48:04] Christians church members Believers with
[48:06] more
[48:06] arrogance more
[48:09] Pride the Bible teaches us how to manage
[48:12] self- thoughts I got this by inspiration
[48:13] so I'm just saying what I got that's why
[48:17] I presented tonight and I feel it's very
[48:19] important the Bible teaches us how to
[48:21] manage selft thoughts manage how you are
[48:25] to see your
[48:27] yourself and when you overvalue yourself
[48:30] you're heading into
[48:33] trouble as we see in the stock market
[48:35] when you see it overvalued it is due for
[48:40] correction Philippians 2 3 and 4
[48:43] Philippians let nothing be done through
[48:46] Strife or vain Glory but in here we go
[48:50] liness of Mind Let each esteem the other
[48:56] better
[48:57] than
[48:59] themselves look not every man on his own
[49:01] things but every man on the things of
[49:04] others in the Amplified it says here do
[49:07] nothing from factional motives true
[49:11] contentiousness
[49:12] Strife selfishness or for unworthy ends
[49:16] or prompted by conceit and empty
[49:19] arrogance instead in the true Spirit of
[49:22] humility I like that true Spirit of
[49:25] humility loneliness of mind so this here
[49:29] is Gospel this here is scripture telling
[49:32] you about you telling about you how you
[49:35] supposed to think about you how you
[49:37] supposed to see others and treat others
[49:39] in loneliness of Mind Let each regard
[49:43] the other as better than and Superior to
[49:47] himself thinking more highly of one
[49:50] another than you do of yourself not
[49:52] bringing down somebody not pulling down
[49:55] your brother not be latting and be
[49:57] litting your brother trying to embarrass
[49:59] your brother it didn't say do that it
[50:01] say make them Superior esteem them
[50:05] higher show them that respect that is
[50:08] the word so when you operate with that
[50:11] understanding and thinking you can't
[50:13] overvalue yourself because you are
[50:14] operating in the spirit of the word to
[50:17] esteem your brother better than yourself
[50:19] because God promotion doesn't come from
[50:21] the east or the West promotion comes
[50:23] from the Lord so not to pull on your
[50:27] brother but to esteem
[50:29] highly so we see now it's not your
[50:33] gift or
[50:36] Talent or position that takes you onto
[50:40] adoption but your behavior amen these
[50:44] servants were told well done not well
[50:48] talked or well
[50:51] spoken it was action that was taken that
[50:55] could be confirmed
[50:57] by the coming Lord that he says well
[51:00] done because you are
[51:03] faithful well done not because you
[51:06] preach well you are faithful here we go
[51:10] in the temporary position I put you in
[51:14] with what you have let me repeat that
[51:17] you are faithful in the temporary
[51:20] position I put you in with what you have
[51:24] I will see what you will produce
[51:27] according to your several
[51:29] abilities Give the Lord some Praises I
[51:31] feel his presence here
[51:33] tonight
[51:34] Hallelujah I will see what you will
[51:37] produce according to your several
[51:39] abilities because you can manage well
[51:41] and be faithful to the little I give you
[51:43] I will promote you to be over bigger
[51:46] things or many things so it come back to
[51:50] the question why should God give you
[51:53] more than you can manage
[51:57] I see how I could manage
[51:59] $1,000 I could give you
[52:01] $10,000 I see I could manine
[52:04] $10,000 I could give you a
[52:06] 100,000 I see we can man 100,000 I give
[52:09] you a
[52:10] million but you can't man $100 you want
[52:13] a, you want $10,000 you can't manage a
[52:15] penny a
[52:16] good you spending
[52:19] all because you refuse to get the
[52:22] discipline to say you know what I have
[52:23] to
[52:24] manage you cannot manage man $1,000 and
[52:27] you're pray call give me 20 what you
[52:28] going to do with it you going to mash it
[52:31] up you're going to wreck it because you
[52:34] have to be faithful in little before you
[52:37] could be faithful in
[52:38] much Oh Glory to God I want to go back
[52:41] to a scripture we had read and I
[52:43] preaching it and judges s spoken about
[52:45] Gideon then zubel okay want to drop this
[52:49] here I want to bring some observation
[52:52] here that Gideon did not choose the 300
[52:58] am the pastor didn't choose the 300 the
[53:02] Apostle didn't choose the 300 the
[53:04] prophet didn't choose the 300 the
[53:06] teacher didn't choose the 300 God
[53:10] did then jobel who was Gideon the Judges
[53:13] chapter 7 and all the people that with
[53:15] him rose up early pitched besides The
[53:17] Well of harod so the host of the
[53:19] midianites were the north side of them
[53:21] by the hill of Mor in the valley and the
[53:23] Lord said to
[53:24] Gideon the people people that are with
[53:27] thee are too many for me to give the
[53:30] midianites into their
[53:32] hands and the reason is least Israel
[53:36] vaun themselves against me saying my own
[53:39] hand had saved me so God know the heart
[53:42] of man he know the even the wickedness
[53:45] of man and he knew if he let that number
[53:48] loose they going say we win we lick them
[53:51] up we beat them we strong we had the
[53:54] church and tongue we had the might
[53:56] Mighty ones we the mighty gentle
[54:00] Warriors and the whole
[54:03] drama so God says I don't want them
[54:07] Pride the self and say my own hand had
[54:10] saved me see that's human you know you
[54:12] and your flesh you and yourself now
[54:15] therefore go and Proclaim to the head of
[54:16] the people saying whosoever is fearful
[54:19] and Afraid let him return and depart
[54:21] early you're frightened go home
[54:28] now
[54:29] listen the test come
[54:31] yet this is just checking the
[54:33] temperature of who
[54:34] afraid the test is down to the water you
[54:36] know that where the message is at
[54:39] everybody go in and drink but the test
[54:41] come yet you know this is who is
[54:44] afraid he telling Gideon this one the
[54:47] real test he will give this is Gideon
[54:51] telling the people under God's guidance
[54:55] say to them whoever is afraid fearful
[54:58] let him return and depart early from M
[55:00] gillad and they return 20 and 2,000
[55:04] people and there remain
[55:07] 10,000 32,000 number start of
[55:10] it Brad the bottom soon as God say who
[55:13] fearful go back 20,000 walk I said God
[55:16] bless you they take the Bible and they
[55:18] go
[55:19] home and the Lord s unto Gideon the
[55:23] people yet are too many bring them down
[55:27] into the water and I will I will who
[55:32] will try them the I will try them for
[55:36] the
[55:38] dear and it shall be that whom I say
[55:41] unto thee this shall go with thee he
[55:44] tell
[55:45] test
[55:48] he watch it shall be whom i s to thee
[55:52] this shall go with thee the same shall
[55:53] go with thee whosoever shall s to thee
[55:55] this shall not go with the the go with
[55:57] let them go to the waters all man going
[55:59] and drink all man have books and tapes
[56:03] all man hearing message and services and
[56:05] sermons and Mysteries and Revelations so
[56:07] he brought down the people unto the
[56:09] water and the Lord said unto
[56:13] Gideon he tell him what is the
[56:15] separation Point yet Gideon doesn't know
[56:18] the Lord said unto
[56:20] Gideon everyone that lath up the water
[56:23] like with his tongue as a dog lap him
[56:25] shall thou set by
[56:27] himself likewise everyone that bowed
[56:30] down to his knees to drink so Gideon's
[56:32] job was to observe two things who
[56:35] lapping like a dog and who bowing the
[56:37] knees as they lap he said you go here as
[56:40] they bow he said you go there so Gideon
[56:42] that all Gideon doing you know he don't
[56:44] know what God going to choose yet you
[56:46] know God only tell him this is
[56:48] instructions now who Laing put them on
[56:50] this side who who B the knees put them
[56:52] on that side and 9,700
[56:57] bow their knees and on the laping side
[56:59] had 300 let's
[57:01] continue so he brought on the people to
[57:03] the water the Lord said everyone right
[57:06] like but the number of them that La
[57:09] putting their hand to the mouth were 300
[57:11] men but all the rest of the people bow
[57:13] down their knees to drink water and the
[57:16] Lord said unto Gideon this is where God
[57:18] dropping down now buy the 300 men that
[57:21] La will I save you and deliver the
[57:24] midianites into thine hand and and let
[57:27] all the other people go every man into
[57:29] his place go
[57:31] home go back home in other words so
[57:34] let's say this way it was a water
[57:38] test not
[57:39] drinking but
[57:43] how oh give the Lord some Praises
[57:45] tonight everybody was in the pool you
[57:48] know everybody was in the water you know
[57:50] but God watching was
[57:54] how how
[57:57] people have books and tapes and what how
[58:00] what is the measuring line all right
[58:01] we'll get back to this let me skip down
[58:03] here
[58:04] but he's talking about this evil age he
[58:07] said it may seem strange a very strange
[58:09] thing in this grace of in this age of
[58:11] Grace God is taken the people for his
[58:13] name's sake that is his bride in this
[58:15] evil age that should be called the age
[58:18] of evil the very age that God is calling
[58:22] the people for his name's sake by Grace
[58:24] out and is calling and evil age now
[58:27] we'll prove by the Bible that this is
[58:29] the age we are speaking of very strange
[58:32] thing to think that in a evil age like
[58:35] this that God then will be calling his
[58:37] bride you notice he said a people not a
[58:41] church why it is called the church but
[58:44] he would call a people now a church is a
[58:48] gathering of many people of all
[58:49] different makeups but God is saying he
[58:51] he didn't say I'll call the Methodist
[58:53] Baptist Pentecostal he said he will call
[58:56] a people am so in other words he would
[58:58] say he call this Tabernacle and this
[59:00] assembly and this local Christian
[59:02] Fellowship no he didn't say that a
[59:06] people one from the
[59:09] Methodist one from the
[59:12] Baptist one from the Lutheran one from
[59:16] the Catholic do they preach at the
[59:17] message no they preach their Church
[59:19] their Revelation they have it and and
[59:22] all kind of drama that is false that's a
[59:24] lie from the pit of Hell you know
[59:27] God don't have no tribes you know God
[59:29] don't have no organization or no group
[59:31] you know it's individuals we are
[59:34] Gentiles we are called as individuals to
[59:37] catch Revelation in this in this hour
[59:39] here oh glory to God we gather together
[59:41] as a church but in the church itself
[59:43] have three kinds of Believers Hallelujah
[59:46] bring them down to the water and see how
[59:48] they la oh give the Lord some Praises
[59:51] Hallelujah he is calling not a church
[59:53] group here we go but a people for his
[59:57] name that receives his name engag in his
[1:00:00] name going to a wedding to be married to
[1:00:02] him to become part of him by
[1:00:04] predestination just as a man that
[1:00:06] chooses the right wife in life and
[1:00:09] ordained to be part of his body that is
[1:00:10] the bride of Christ will be and is now
[1:00:12] from God ordained of God to be part of
[1:00:15] that body notice not when someone has
[1:00:18] said what someone's called but what God
[1:00:20] choose before the foundation of the
[1:00:22] world and in and is calling let say
[1:00:26] pause you a minute what if Gideon knew
[1:00:30] what the test really was and who was the
[1:00:31] go then he could tell La laap lap lap
[1:00:35] laap laap call cin Bo la la la you see
[1:00:39] what God did there he a tell him how
[1:00:41] they going to UNF fall know just put
[1:00:42] them lapers so and put the one who B so
[1:00:45] and then say these
[1:00:47] 300 that is how God has work it have no
[1:00:50] as as you pass pass side pass none of
[1:00:54] that God has no respect of persons but
[1:00:58] Bram he said watch last week in Matthew
[1:01:01] 24 it was the most even age all the age
[1:01:03] of Deceit for shall arise now a cold
[1:01:06] formal sa church and so forth M theology
[1:01:09] the elect will never pay no attention to
[1:01:11] that but it's up te almost like the real
[1:01:15] thing just leaving one word is all you
[1:01:19] have to
[1:01:20] do promise of the age very great time so
[1:01:24] when I was dry dead Church
[1:01:27] with that the Temptation is the two
[1:01:29] Spirits so close it would receive the
[1:01:32] very elect if it was
[1:01:33] possible what would God call a people
[1:01:36] out of the E
[1:01:39] for for his name and he answers it the
[1:01:43] reason is to try
[1:01:45] her his
[1:01:48] bride I'm the eye and the bride and
[1:01:50] going in Rapture is that right this is
[1:01:52] the word here this a no Carnival thing
[1:01:55] you're dancing and going
[1:01:56] put on a mask band and a masquerad and
[1:01:58] then dance on the band and going not
[1:02:00] know the reason he call out in his evil
[1:02:03] age is to try her is this the gospel is
[1:02:08] this the message we preaching here now
[1:02:10] it's to try her his
[1:02:11] bride when she is made
[1:02:14] manifest been tried been proven proved
[1:02:18] to Satan as the seed starts in the
[1:02:21] ground it come to carriers the life of
[1:02:24] it but it ends up the same seed like
[1:02:26] when they went in the ground and just as
[1:02:28] the gospel when it fell in the
[1:02:29] denomination ner Rome it ends up a super
[1:02:32] organization just as the seed of the
[1:02:34] church fell back there here we go with
[1:02:36] signs wonders and the living Christ
[1:02:38] among them it ends up in the last days
[1:02:41] under the ministry of Malachi 4 and
[1:02:43] restores back again the original faith
[1:02:45] that was once given Oh Glory to God he
[1:02:48] is prophesying he is saying that the
[1:02:50] last day Church would come under the
[1:02:52] ministry of Malachi 4 and it will be
[1:02:55] restored back to the original faith that
[1:02:56] was once given it going to be the same
[1:02:58] life same signs same wonders same
[1:03:01] Miracles same pay Alpha and Omega is the
[1:03:04] same oh give the Lord some Praises
[1:03:07] Hallelujah we find now this evil age is
[1:03:10] to prove to Satan she is not like
[1:03:13] eveall Give the Lord a shout on that one
[1:03:16] this bride is not like Eve she is not
[1:03:19] that type of a woman she will be Tried
[1:03:21] by his word the bride as Adam bride was
[1:03:24] Tried by the word Adam bride believe
[1:03:26] every bit of the word all but confused
[1:03:28] on One Promise he's the same yesterday
[1:03:30] today and forever but fail on One
[1:03:32] Promise under the temptation of the
[1:03:33] enemy face to face and the people has
[1:03:36] called for his name of course is his
[1:03:37] bride she is to come in contact Again by
[1:03:40] the same thing not by denominational
[1:03:42] Truth for in the beginning of the Bible
[1:03:44] man was given the word to live by one
[1:03:47] word misinterpreted a man called Satan
[1:03:49] in the person of an animal called The
[1:03:51] Serpent Satan in this person would talk
[1:03:53] to Eve and misinterpret the word and
[1:03:55] that's how everything fell Oh Glory to
[1:03:58] God and the seed in Genesis is what we
[1:04:00] see in here manifest the sodomite the
[1:04:03] lgbqt whatever L and those alphabet
[1:04:06] people and so on like that all that was
[1:04:07] seated down in Genesis and now it's
[1:04:09] being manifest in the open Oh Glory to
[1:04:12] God hallelujah and that Royal seed fate
[1:04:15] that was in Abraham that was in Genesis
[1:04:17] is going to be manifested in the open AB
[1:04:20] waed 25 years to produce Isaac
[1:04:22] Hallelujah this bride waiting all these
[1:04:24] years will produce the Messiah M on the
[1:04:26] earth one more time this last day bride
[1:04:28] will be Messiah oh give the Lord some
[1:04:31] Praises hallelujah praise God Amen
[1:04:34] Hallelujah so the minister is not to try
[1:04:36] the people God will try them gon didn't
[1:04:39] try the people God tried them he tried
[1:04:41] them by the water isn't that right
[1:04:44] praise the Lord again hallelujah praise
[1:04:46] God praise God so all the groups in the
[1:04:48] message coming out to the water but God
[1:04:50] is the one who see them how they
[1:04:52] drinking H let's pull it straight now
[1:04:56] how the drinking Gideon was told to
[1:04:58] watch him watch that's right he watched
[1:05:01] them and he obeyed what God Said isn't
[1:05:04] that right so the separation came by God
[1:05:07] himself noting how they drank and and
[1:05:11] and today is what kind of life you're
[1:05:13] living it's not putting a book on your
[1:05:15] head it's not wearing walking with a
[1:05:18] Bible but that measurement on that
[1:05:20] quality is going to be the life praise
[1:05:22] God I've heard it said ministers outside
[1:05:24] the pulpit their behavior is
[1:05:26] questionable when they come in the
[1:05:28] Pulpit it's God is the word but they
[1:05:30] have issue with the man and his life
[1:05:32] something wrong there something is wrong
[1:05:35] there because he's supposed to be one in
[1:05:37] the pulpit and outside it's one life
[1:05:40] it's one Lord It's one spirit it's one
[1:05:43] baptism it can't be one man outside and
[1:05:45] one man inside of here because under the
[1:05:47] anointing I think brother BR talk about
[1:05:49] it some woman kind used to be drunk
[1:05:52] orever it is but when hit she be pit so
[1:05:54] is his word coming out and P they were
[1:05:57] gifted people gift and talent that God
[1:06:00] could use and we gone past that age now
[1:06:03] it is a more than a gift a gift to speak
[1:06:06] a gift to preach is more than giftedness
[1:06:08] gift and calling is without repentance
[1:06:11] people born with these things they have
[1:06:13] these things inside of them it just need
[1:06:15] anointing to come upon them and out it
[1:06:17] comes but that is not what we talking
[1:06:19] about it has to have a measuring line
[1:06:22] and that measuring line will be the life
[1:06:24] oh give the Lord some Praises not
[1:06:27] because you're in a message church not
[1:06:29] because you have books and tapes but
[1:06:31] what kind of life is being measured up
[1:06:33] with the
[1:06:34] word hallelujah glory to God glory to
[1:06:38] God we believe that thank you Lord Jesus
[1:06:41] let's go wow brother Bram said we got
[1:06:46] more unbelief than we ever had ministers
[1:06:48] have organized themselves great
[1:06:50] denomination like incubated chicken
[1:06:52] hatch out by the grinder brings them out
[1:06:53] like that what we need in our churches
[1:06:58] is a man that got an absolute what we
[1:07:01] need in Methodist Church the Baptist
[1:07:03] Church the Pentecostal church the presan
[1:07:05] church is a man of God that will stand
[1:07:07] tied to the word of God and to Christ
[1:07:10] here we go I've read read this many
[1:07:12] times and bring that congregation under
[1:07:15] the condition where each member walks in
[1:07:20] the condition of his word of this word
[1:07:23] so it can't be my daughter
[1:07:26] or my son he going through stress so
[1:07:29] therefore she could wear Min skirt she
[1:07:30] could wear this and wear that if the
[1:07:32] parents compromise with the children
[1:07:35] then where is that word condition that
[1:07:37] going to hone them and hold them they
[1:07:40] have to know this is God requirement God
[1:07:42] not cting to flesh God not cting because
[1:07:45] they young devil has take young people
[1:07:47] to hell too do you get what I'm saying
[1:07:49] people has get killed and perish
[1:07:53] now age doesn't matter you know and in
[1:07:56] Ezekiel 9 it say slay utterly young old
[1:07:58] male female little children but come not
[1:08:01] near any man with that
[1:08:03] Mark so we cannot do like we are sorry
[1:08:06] because we are in the flesh or in
[1:08:08] carnality or in natural we have to leave
[1:08:11] it to God bringing the test I tell
[1:08:14] brother Gideon beautifully brought it
[1:08:15] out like in the exam room they say one
[1:08:17] and 1al 2 2 andal 4 4 and four equal
[1:08:20] eight but in the exam room they gave one
[1:08:22] and
[1:08:22] two and if you're dumb Dum and you say
[1:08:25] teacher never give me one and two before
[1:08:26] but get two and two he give you one and
[1:08:28] one you have to deduct what what is
[1:08:31] there he never said 2 + 1 equal Tre but
[1:08:34] you have to figure it out and God does
[1:08:36] that Hallelujah he is you are here to be
[1:08:40] tested so he talk about a man of God
[1:08:42] that will stand tied with the Christ and
[1:08:44] bring that congregation under the
[1:08:45] condition where each member walks in the
[1:08:48] condition of this word seeing that word
[1:08:51] manifested these shine shall follow them
[1:08:54] not believe when when the fire fell when
[1:08:57] Peter spoke to Conor's house what did
[1:08:58] Peter said then Peter opened his mouth
[1:09:00] and said of a truth I perceive that God
[1:09:02] is no respected persons it was this
[1:09:04] experience that shocked Peter that that
[1:09:07] shake Peter because they were elected
[1:09:09] Jews these were stinking Gentiles if I
[1:09:12] could use that word filthy Gentiles
[1:09:14] Gentiles out of the Covenant of God and
[1:09:16] he went there with a testimony and when
[1:09:18] he dropped the testimony he see them
[1:09:19] filled with the same Holy Ghost they got
[1:09:21] not a different Holy Ghost not a lesser
[1:09:24] Holy Ghost not a small Holy Ghost not a
[1:09:26] tiny Holy Ghost not a gentile Holy Ghost
[1:09:28] and a Jewish holy ghost is the same Holy
[1:09:31] Ghost Oh Glory to God tonight it's the
[1:09:33] same Holy Ghost Hallelujah a truth God
[1:09:37] is no respect of persons but in every
[1:09:39] nation he that fav with him and work at
[1:09:42] righteousness is accepted with him
[1:09:45] hallelujah hallelujah and the Amplified
[1:09:48] it says Peter opened his mouth and said
[1:09:50] most certainly and thoroughly I now
[1:09:52] perceive and understand that God shows
[1:09:54] no pass ity and is no respect of
[1:09:58] persons but in every nation he who
[1:10:00] venerates and has the reverential fear
[1:10:03] of God treating him with worshipful
[1:10:05] obedience living uprightly is acceptable
[1:10:08] to him and sure of being received and
[1:10:11] welcomed by him oh Blessed Be you love
[1:10:15] him tonight oh glory to God so this was
[1:10:18] the burden that I get to share with you
[1:10:20] tonight Hallelujah glory to God in the
[1:10:24] beginning Genesis which is the SE
[1:10:26] chapter of the Bible we find when God
[1:10:28] made man he made him in the way he knew
[1:10:31] that he was to be he could never be any
[1:10:33] greater design than what he was when he
[1:10:36] made he begin to make life he made it
[1:10:38] from the lowest life and he went to the
[1:10:41] highest life is man within the image of
[1:10:43] God now here we go in this life listen
[1:10:48] closely man begin to achieve
[1:10:52] things but when he did he he begin to
[1:10:55] leave God out of the picture because he
[1:10:58] begin to have selfish motives this have
[1:11:00] to De with ambition and your achievement
[1:11:03] and I have seen it over the years people
[1:11:05] struggling and they and they're
[1:11:07] suffering and when God blessed them
[1:11:08] Pride take over arrogance that's why
[1:11:10] brother said this way he's looking for
[1:11:13] somebody that the more He blesses the
[1:11:16] more humble he becomes that is a
[1:11:19] rarity because when people get blessed
[1:11:23] they go into Pride mode they go into
[1:11:26] arrogant mode they go into nobody can
[1:11:28] tell them anything because they have
[1:11:29] money they have car they have house they
[1:11:31] have wealth they have plane they have
[1:11:32] jet they have whatever it is and they
[1:11:34] going to the do care mode they care
[1:11:36] about doctor they no nobody at
[1:11:39] all when he did that he begin to think
[1:11:43] of something for himself we find out it
[1:11:45] isn't long until he had corrupted the
[1:11:47] very planet that God put him on he had
[1:11:49] got in such a condition till even his
[1:11:51] creator grieved him at his heart that he
[1:11:53] ever make man and you you can imagine
[1:11:55] how God felt when he seen the very
[1:11:58] creature that he made in His image and
[1:12:00] give him dominion and how he made him to
[1:12:02] do something for him and yet he turned
[1:12:04] all his strength and his power over to
[1:12:06] selfish desires and achievements like
[1:12:09] have the computer with artificial
[1:12:10] intelligence now and they talking and
[1:12:12] talking back I say I tell tell somebody
[1:12:14] just s sit right that when they talking
[1:12:17] devil talking to you what I'm saying
[1:12:19] then when God put man and loose man man
[1:12:23] on the own you know and that is why man
[1:12:26] could achieve cars house current plane
[1:12:29] whatever it is it's man you know it's
[1:12:31] not it's not a spiritual man you know
[1:12:32] it's not a godly man you know is man in
[1:12:34] his intellect man in his mind man that
[1:12:37] was made in the image of God has the
[1:12:38] ability to achieve and he has we've seen
[1:12:40] it we are using man's achievement this
[1:12:43] microphone this technology this
[1:12:45] streaming all of this is
[1:12:47] man man in his
[1:12:50] element you think Elijah need
[1:12:53] techology when the I'm saying it have
[1:12:55] somebody hearing everything we
[1:12:57] saying Elijah don't need a wireless
[1:12:59] communication
[1:13:01] system Elijah hearing them talking
[1:13:03] privately don't tell
[1:13:06] nobody they making sure nobody looking
[1:13:08] and like hear everything normal normal
[1:13:09] normal because you see the
[1:13:11] dimensions is that's right
[1:13:14] there Dimensions is right there it have
[1:13:18] no space and time with God hallelujah
[1:13:21] but God Up Is Down Down is up Hallelujah
[1:13:23] Hal distance is nothing
[1:13:25] that's why he could give you a miracle
[1:13:27] tonight he could transform you tonight
[1:13:29] he could heal you tonight he could
[1:13:31] deliver you tonight he could free you
[1:13:33] tonight he could break the bands off of
[1:13:35] you tonight he could bless you tonight
[1:13:37] I'll say it again he could give you a
[1:13:39] miracle tonight he could give you new
[1:13:41] kidneys tonight H new heart
[1:13:48] tonight all right let's continue it
[1:13:51] seemed like man can't learn only through
[1:13:52] the hard way we find that even our
[1:13:55] children we have to punish them many
[1:13:57] times
[1:13:57] severely you can't see that now you
[1:14:00] know you're sining now to go there to
[1:14:03] make them understand it just seemed like
[1:14:06] a man is just in himself a total failure
[1:14:08] to begin with when he lost here we go
[1:14:10] his relationship with God he become a
[1:14:12] unit on his own and that's why people
[1:14:15] love the independence and as my own man
[1:14:17] as my own woman and whatnot like what
[1:14:19] people say it's my body and all kind
[1:14:21] foolishness like if they make it
[1:14:22] yourself they had to go to the
[1:14:23] manufacturer and who make your body
[1:14:26] who give you you who give you your eyes
[1:14:27] your nose your ears whatever it is you
[1:14:29] think you have and you
[1:14:31] own it just seemed like just a total
[1:14:35] failure when he lost his relationship
[1:14:36] with God he become a unit of his own
[1:14:38] here we go he didn't depend on God no
[1:14:41] more and that is why sometimes God has
[1:14:43] have us on a short leech that why some
[1:14:46] people can't get very far because he
[1:14:48] knew he know if you give them too much
[1:14:49] right now they destroy their own self so
[1:14:52] you have to hold them on a strong leave
[1:14:53] always Under Pressure that they could
[1:14:55] pray Under Pressure they could crou onto
[1:14:58] God If he if he give them too much right
[1:15:00] now forget it they they walk up they
[1:15:01] stop coming to
[1:15:04] church I know a brother praying for a
[1:15:06] car God he he want to come to church he
[1:15:08] want to get Transportation he want to
[1:15:09] get a car when you get a car he to
[1:15:11] church he going the beach you see why
[1:15:13] didn't all the
[1:15:16] time go trying to save him from himself
[1:15:19] because the car end up licking he going
[1:15:21] he stop going he L he going places
[1:15:28] he had become a unit of his own he
[1:15:30] didn't depend upon God no more and when
[1:15:32] God taught him the lesson of what it was
[1:15:35] to try to do something within himself
[1:15:36] and his Works will all come to nor
[1:15:38] immediately we find him going again to
[1:15:40] achieve again the Bible said they built
[1:15:42] them a tower they were going to climb
[1:15:44] into Heavens to get up into heaven
[1:15:46] without coming the way God planned for
[1:15:48] them so instead of repenting and getting
[1:15:50] right with God they say know something
[1:15:51] we so good we can build a tower and go
[1:15:53] right up and come we want go up we want
[1:15:56] Heen be far from us we going up to
[1:15:58] heaven and then start to build a tower
[1:16:00] listen I would say God get frighten you
[1:16:02] know but God said because the man is one
[1:16:05] they will achieve what the purpose in
[1:16:08] their heart that's how powerful Oneness
[1:16:10] is that's how powerful Unity is the only
[1:16:13] solution to answer that is to confuse
[1:16:15] them and God Dro different languages on
[1:16:18] them when they say Pastor brick somebody
[1:16:20] looking for the
[1:16:21] hammer the language different when they
[1:16:23] say put the gravel there somebody give a
[1:16:25] different language what he meant and the
[1:16:28] whole thing went nuts God had to stop
[1:16:30] man in his Track by sending different
[1:16:31] languages to confuse them and that's
[1:16:33] where the word Babylon come from
[1:16:35] confusion that's why we have mystery
[1:16:37] Babylon Madame confusion in this last
[1:16:40] day all right let's go and all the time
[1:16:44] these things are going on here we go the
[1:16:46] spirit of the Living God is traveling
[1:16:48] with flesh trying to get man away from
[1:16:51] his own achievement trying to get man
[1:16:53] away from his own selfish motives and
[1:16:55] objectives to a plan which God has laid
[1:16:58] down as long as man Works in his own
[1:17:00] plan he will be a failure a man can only
[1:17:04] achieve right when he comes back with
[1:17:06] the right objective and the right motive
[1:17:08] that is according to God's plan for him
[1:17:10] any other Foundation is sinking sand you
[1:17:13] see Satan uses man's head he chooses in
[1:17:16] the garden even takes Man head he's
[1:17:17] thinking and he has brought that down
[1:17:19] even to the church the devil taken man's
[1:17:22] head because he can use his eye you
[1:17:25] notice if the man isn't generally Born
[1:17:27] Again spiritual he will take what he can
[1:17:29] see with his eyes the pride of life many
[1:17:32] men going to achieve something he wants
[1:17:33] to join a church he wants to be
[1:17:35] religious he look around till he find
[1:17:37] the biggest he can find because man
[1:17:39] wants to do something big he wants to
[1:17:41] make a big name for himself that's what
[1:17:43] the carnal foolish thinking man think oh
[1:17:45] if I could have my organization if I can
[1:17:47] only add so much thousands to my
[1:17:48] denomination it'll be the largest in the
[1:17:51] land what good does it do but he thinks
[1:17:53] he's achieving something because he's
[1:17:54] added and more those so-called meetings
[1:17:57] today they are great meetings but it
[1:17:59] only works on the intellectual part of
[1:18:02] man that's what happen in message right
[1:18:03] now people only intellectual getting the
[1:18:06] message they haven't got in contact with
[1:18:08] the real spirit yet and the brother
[1:18:09] Brandon prophesy When the Spirit Fall
[1:18:11] the elect will run to it the Spirit come
[1:18:13] in you know it Go and fall you know and
[1:18:16] the elect all the church members they
[1:18:18] will stay where they are but the elect
[1:18:19] they will follow that Spirit Hallelujah
[1:18:21] the spirit is what they're going to
[1:18:22] follow because that is where we come
[1:18:24] from
[1:18:25] before the beginning Satan only came in
[1:18:27] the beginning but the elect was before
[1:18:29] the beginning and in the beginning was
[1:18:30] the word but before the beginning was
[1:18:32] Spirit oh give the Lord some praises and
[1:18:34] we're going right back to before the
[1:18:36] beginning that's where our calling lies
[1:18:38] that's is where our election lies in the
[1:18:40] gene thought of God I was before the
[1:18:42] beginning here we go so
[1:18:45] watch the the So-Cal meetings the only
[1:18:48] reach in the works on the intellectual
[1:18:49] part of man a man gets under the spell
[1:18:52] of Revival yes I accept Christ but he
[1:18:54] does it intellectually because he in a
[1:18:56] great crowd he does it because there are
[1:18:57] great ministers before him it's only an
[1:18:59] intellectual conception that man can
[1:19:02] never go on he has got to come here we
[1:19:04] go listen he has got to come from the
[1:19:06] mind to his heart and be born again or
[1:19:09] he will never be able to stand the test
[1:19:12] because the test is coming as butan
[1:19:14] preach ready or not it's coming whether
[1:19:17] you are ready or not it's coming and all
[1:19:20] those people in Primary School know the
[1:19:21] test
[1:19:22] coming and the GC people know the test
[1:19:25] come in whether they ready or not you
[1:19:27] had 5 years to prepare 5 years to get
[1:19:30] enough sense in your head to do the exam
[1:19:32] and if you don't buckle down and settle
[1:19:34] down yourself to study you would fail
[1:19:37] who's to blame the question will be
[1:19:39] asked what have you done with your
[1:19:43] time it might have no cell phone had no
[1:19:47] thing you could scroll and WhatsApp and

[1:20:43] manage yourself you know you know the
[1:20:45] first trial come they say let us go back
[1:20:47] to
[1:20:48] Egypt h no Graves out here all your
[1:20:51] following Moses take us back we miss
[1:20:54] them G they was
[1:20:55] roasting and onion and
[1:21:00] leaks brother
[1:21:02] bam almost
[1:21:04] finished you remember when the eye looks
[1:21:06] upon it the devil uses your eye in the
[1:21:08] Garden of Eden it Prov that the devil
[1:21:10] choose a head of man to work in but God
[1:21:12] chooses the heart when God comes to a
[1:21:15] man he comes to his heart let him
[1:21:19] believe and and let he let him believe
[1:21:21] things by his heart through faith that
[1:21:23] the eye does not see and that's why you
[1:21:25] know I'm going to get a breakthrough I
[1:21:27] know I'm going to get a victory I can't
[1:21:28] explain it but I just know it it's
[1:21:29] something inside my heart Hallelujah now
[1:21:32] when man has never had that experience
[1:21:36] he is still a Son of God in creation a
[1:21:38] fallen Son of God that's the reason he
[1:21:41] can take wood and make buildings he can
[1:21:43] take iron and make Machinery that's the
[1:21:44] reason that Elon Musk could do what he
[1:21:46] do because he's a man a fallen man
[1:21:49] Fallen son and because he have all his
[1:21:51] intellect and get all these ideas he
[1:21:53] could do something that other stist
[1:21:54] would only dream of and if time permits
[1:21:58] more people will come forward and do
[1:21:59] other things too because they actually
[1:22:02] have broken into God's laboratory these
[1:22:03] people are totally
[1:22:07] insane I read one of the AI thing they
[1:22:09] have right now they said it will take
[1:22:11] how much how much million years to be
[1:22:13] able to calculate what is calculating
[1:22:14] right
[1:22:16] now they hope the a start up on own do
[1:22:26] he can tell jewels and make watches what
[1:22:28] can he do he can take something out of
[1:22:30] the original creation and pervert it
[1:22:31] from his original to make something
[1:22:34] great but he cannot create only God can
[1:22:37] create we notice then Satan choosing the
[1:22:40] man's head he took his intellectual part
[1:22:42] oh now the church has begin to move into
[1:22:44] intellectual parts of man it's a great
[1:22:46] church we have a great denomination with
[1:22:48] the old in the country look at the
[1:22:49] history and we go to the history in the
[1:22:51] message and in 1970 and 19 this one and
[1:22:54] I all kind of
[1:22:55] History yeah God was in that history but
[1:22:58] where is God
[1:22:59] now we got to be careful you know
[1:23:02] because Saul was gifted Saul was
[1:23:05] anointed Saul was inspired one time Saul
[1:23:08] was
[1:23:09] even put with a line up with the
[1:23:11] prophets but afterwards Saul
[1:23:14] backslid and God rejected him so if he
[1:23:18] say God called me I could tell you the
[1:23:20] date the minute the hour he called me
[1:23:22] woo and I felt the anointing when that
[1:23:24] Prophet put all upon me yeah but that
[1:23:27] was 30 years ago what happening now what
[1:23:30] you feeling now you see what I'm saying
[1:23:33] now all
[1:23:36] right let that same man take his little
[1:23:39] knowledge he has in his head and give it
[1:23:41] to over to God let the spirit of the
[1:23:43] Living God come down into the heart of
[1:23:46] his he will call every word of God truth
[1:23:49] L watch there's a compartment in man's
[1:23:51] heart God made that in dear for him
[1:23:54] himself that is his control room he sits
[1:23:58] there to control you okay we on home
[1:24:00] shet right now that's his place that's
[1:24:03] where he sends his messages from the
[1:24:05] control room how can he work with you
[1:24:07] when your nature of the spirit of the
[1:24:08] devil is inside of there every man on
[1:24:12] Earth is born in sin shape and iniquity
[1:24:14] coming the world speaking lies so in the
[1:24:17] carnal adamic nature how can a man
[1:24:20] achieve anything only through his
[1:24:22] intellectuals so outside spirit of God
[1:24:25] bringing an operation in your heart is
[1:24:26] intellectuals at
[1:24:28] work when he comes to be a new creature
[1:24:31] and the old man passes out the new man
[1:24:34] Christ takes his throne in the human
[1:24:36] heart then life looks different then he
[1:24:39] starts on a new road from his own
[1:24:41] selfish motives till the big ideas to
[1:24:43] make himself something big he start
[1:24:45] right towards Calvary to recognize god
[1:24:48] listen to this then his all his
[1:24:51] objective his motive his ACH achievement
[1:24:55] all that he is lays at the glory of the
[1:24:57] Cross where Christ paid the price for
[1:25:00] human life Christ is our life now watch
[1:25:04] except a man be born again he can't even
[1:25:07] understand the kingdom of God you can't
[1:25:08] do it it's not in you to do it why did
[1:25:11] God make that little place he made it so
[1:25:14] you can be filled in there and the devil
[1:25:17] job now is to offer basketball football
[1:25:19] Cricket music hip hop whatever it is Tik
[1:25:22] Tok offer a set of stuff that to fill
[1:25:24] you instead of being filled with the
[1:25:26] Holy Ghost God put a compartment inside
[1:25:29] your heart not your head your heart that
[1:25:31] why the I see Styles I want that I want
[1:25:33] that kind of dress I want that kind of
[1:25:34] shoes I want that kind of life I want
[1:25:36] that kind of car I want that kind of
[1:25:37] plane I want want I want I want I want I
[1:25:39] want I want because the I seeing what
[1:25:40] you want but the heart want to believe
[1:25:43] what God said that's why God anoint the
[1:25:45] heart to believe what he said can I
[1:25:48] continue watch this part I've heard
[1:25:51] ministers get up with charts try to
[1:25:52] explain what the mark of the Beast was
[1:25:54] by some chart it doesn't take a chart
[1:25:57] the scripture say all that didn't
[1:25:59] receive the seed of God had the mark of
[1:26:00] the beast there are only two classes on
[1:26:02] the earth one's got the mark of God and
[1:26:04] the other one got the mark of the devil
[1:26:07] oh give the Lord some Praises all that
[1:26:09] didn't receive the mark of God had the
[1:26:11] mark of the devil that is what the
[1:26:13] scriptures said you are forced to make a
[1:26:16] decision let me grind it into you not to
[1:26:19] be rude or mean but to tell you the
[1:26:20] truth and warn you man's got to do
[1:26:23] something about it it is forced into you
[1:26:25] you must make your decision if I could
[1:26:28] show you by the word of God what the
[1:26:29] seed of the Living God is then you will
[1:26:31] know Ephesians 4:30 says that then
[1:26:33] without the Holy Spirit you are marked
[1:26:35] off the other side no matter how
[1:26:37] intellectual how many denominations that
[1:26:39] you belong to how much Pious religious
[1:26:41] you are Satan was the same thing Cain
[1:26:44] was religious as Abel did not Cain offer
[1:26:46] an offering just the same as Abel did
[1:26:48] not Cain build a church and Asel did did
[1:26:51] not Cain Get Down and Worship Asel did
[1:26:53] did not Cain sacrifice as same as Abel
[1:26:54] did but one come by intellectual
[1:26:56] conception brought flowers and fruits
[1:26:58] and they make it beautiful but Abel by
[1:27:00] faith choose a lamb it was blood and
[1:27:02] life that taken it and God confirmed
[1:27:05] Abel's Revelation oh give the Lord some
[1:27:07] Praises tonight let's go you are filled
[1:27:09] with something yes sir you might be
[1:27:11] filled with doubt mus please your poor
[1:27:13] heart may be running over with doubt I
[1:27:15] hope not your heart may be full of frats
[1:27:17] and worry it might be that your heart is
[1:27:19] full of trouble might be that you full
[1:27:20] of religion intellectual fine perfume
[1:27:23] theology belonging to a great churches
[1:27:25] be existence for years settling back
[1:27:27] just as confident you can be brother let
[1:27:29] me say it to you you might bring members
[1:27:31] to that church till you're old and die
[1:27:33] you will never do nothing but build
[1:27:34] another Tower of Babel
[1:27:37] certainly you can be full of foolishness
[1:27:39] people don't even know
[1:27:41] that full of it you can be full of
[1:27:44] nonsense I'm still reading they are my
[1:27:45] own thoughts you can be full of anything
[1:27:48] but you can't stay empty the Bible say
[1:27:51] you can't the Bible said when an unclean
[1:27:53] Spirit has gone of a man he walks in dry
[1:27:55] places searching rest and when he comes
[1:27:57] back with seven other Devils worse than
[1:27:59] he was the last state of the man is
[1:28:02] eight times worse than he was in the
[1:28:03] beginning that's what happened to these
[1:28:05] meetings when people go for in revivals
[1:28:07] and men are just led to an intellectual
[1:28:10] conception he goes off and joins some
[1:28:12] church and Let It Go as that satisfied
[1:28:14] there's nothing to all this nonsense we
[1:28:16] we shouldn't have it the pastor say oh
[1:28:18] that's well way back for another age and
[1:28:20] the first thing you know the devil
[1:28:21] return back with seven of devils and he
[1:28:23] become a religious devil then he's
[1:28:26] really filled he have pride and jealousy
[1:28:29] we are not like them we we are on the
[1:28:31] word we we are the message
[1:28:34] principle set a foolishness dead as a
[1:28:40] daill they up there don't sing message
[1:28:42] songs because I sing them just
[1:28:45] now the ones that are inspiring or what
[1:28:47] we will sing them don't
[1:28:49] worry he said now he's very angry and
[1:28:52] it's so cucko how people does take
[1:28:54] things to judge um the dress is not long
[1:28:57] enough our dress longer than their own
[1:28:59] that make them
[1:29:00] bright I don't put no grease in my hair
[1:29:03] that make them bright my hair dry for
[1:29:05] years that's bride oh my goodness we
[1:29:09] have Mysteries you all have nut that
[1:29:11] make them bride we play tapes and and
[1:29:13] press play that make them bride all
[1:29:15] these are lies am nice executive perfume
[1:29:19] theology lies the word have a
[1:29:22] requirement he said National Force put
[1:29:25] the people in work and churches but the
[1:29:27] power of God will put the people in The
[1:29:28] Bride not hearing books not hearing
[1:29:31] tapes not going to the this church and
[1:29:32] that church the power of God have to put
[1:29:34] you in the
[1:29:35] bride God make sure he tell Gideon just
[1:29:38] watch them both sides but I will tell
[1:29:40] you who going to be with you oh give the
[1:29:43] Lord some Praises
[1:29:48] Hallelujah these s for believe not
[1:29:50] negative thinkers not intellectual
[1:29:52] church members but born again believer
[1:29:54] Bel who come from the intellectual to
[1:29:55] the heart where God takes control throne
[1:29:59] in his control room here this part to
[1:30:01] control your
[1:30:03] emotions to control your Fai to control
[1:30:07] your character let me read it again to
[1:30:10] control your emotions so how come the
[1:30:12] pastor or the minister or the man of God
[1:30:15] he is one way in the Pulpit but
[1:30:16] different way
[1:30:17] outside so you have big questions on his
[1:30:20] life on the outside but you have no
[1:30:21] question when he the preach cuz you're
[1:30:22] wory you got challenge that
[1:30:25] but then you have no Behavior outside
[1:30:27] but yet we are seen here that when God
[1:30:29] fills a man he controls your emotions he
[1:30:33] control your faith control your
[1:30:35] character God wants to fill you why does
[1:30:38] he want to fill you what does he want to
[1:30:40] fill you with he wants to fill you with
[1:30:42] himself the holy spirit filled with the
[1:30:45] Holy Ghost Jus said in Luke 24:49 you
[1:30:47] shall receive power after the Holy Ghost
[1:30:49] come upon you and you shall be Witnesses
[1:30:51] unto me oh my I'm
[1:30:54] closing in prayer
[1:30:57] tonight our heavenly father Master pray
[1:31:01] to the father that we be one and if and
[1:31:03] God is one how close were they God was
[1:31:06] the life and spirit in him and if we are
[1:31:09] one with him we will be life and spirit
[1:31:12] of him will be in us then Earthly carnal
[1:31:17] intellectual conception and Creeds and
[1:31:19] dogmas will fade out and a new generated
[1:31:24] born again virgin experience of the
[1:31:27] baptism of the holy spirit will take
[1:31:30] place in the human heart then you'll be
[1:31:32] one then brother will be really be
[1:31:35] brother sister will be sister your
[1:31:38] objectives your motives all that you are
[1:31:42] all that you ever want to be or try to
[1:31:45] be will be for the kingdom of God no
[1:31:48] matter what church you represent where
[1:31:50] you go or what you do oh prise when God
[1:31:55] sets in the Throne of your heart in his
[1:31:56] control room controlling your emotions
[1:32:00] controlling your powers controlling your
[1:32:02] conceptions making you one with him in
[1:32:04] fellowship and in love and God fill you
[1:32:07] with love he fills you with power he
[1:32:09] fills you with his Spirit he fills you
[1:32:11] with his own divine nature he changes
[1:32:14] your carnal nature into his nature then
[1:32:17] you become a new creation in Christ then
[1:32:19] the love you go out and seemly the bird
[1:32:22] sing different when Christ comes come in
[1:32:24] and you look back and say how did I ever
[1:32:26] stay away from it everything is
[1:32:28] different you have no enemies they all
[1:32:30] look sweet you can forgive everything
[1:32:33] that en been done the bitterest of enemy
[1:32:36] you could pray for him on the street you
[1:32:38] could put armor around him and lift him
[1:32:39] up no matter what Creed what
[1:32:41] denomination belongs to he's a creature
[1:32:43] who Christ died for that is what God
[1:32:46] wants you to be filled with that's the
[1:32:48] filling that's the kingdom that is when
[1:32:51] we are one why because Abraham staggered
[1:32:54] not of the promise of God true unbelief
[1:32:56] but was strong giving praise to God why
[1:32:59] it wasn't in his mind it was in his
[1:33:01] heart God's Throne is in a human heart
[1:33:05] there we become one one in purpose one
[1:33:08] in achievement if a Methodist brother
[1:33:10] wins 100 Soul amen and amen because that
[1:33:12] is what we achieving the kingdom of God
[1:33:15] as long as you say well they are not
[1:33:18] Methodist they are not Baptist they are
[1:33:19] not this they are not the other your
[1:33:20] whole motive is wrong your objective all
[1:33:23] you achieve is wrong when you are trying
[1:33:25] to do something within yourself to make
[1:33:27] it look big when you are little oh give
[1:33:30] the Lord a praise in the house
[1:33:32] Hallelujah so all this thing I'm better
[1:33:34] than you and who is better and who is
[1:33:36] best and what that's just foolishness
[1:33:38] Jesus prayed we might be one just as God
[1:33:41] and him were one and God was in him
[1:33:43] begin to play and we are one with Christ
[1:33:46] if we let Christ come in but it's the
[1:33:49] only way we can do is to let him take
[1:33:52] the control in our hearts
[1:33:54] riches is not measured out by dollars
[1:33:57] riches is not measured by big names and
[1:33:58] popularity riches is connected with the
[1:34:01] kingdom of God father God I thank you
