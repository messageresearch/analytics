broader deal of it from Trinidad Tobago to have this meeting and I would love to greet the International ministers specially those that will minister the word in power to all a premie was giving the proper of God said that there will be ministry that will be exactly like the military subscribe here in Turkey we are on the greatest potential to be able to hear this meeting from China a ministry that will be preaching in the right season like the inspiration that gap plate and the heart of brother of it in time of life how important my brethren it is to have a revelation of the life knowing beloved that with Adam and Eve because of unbelief let the garden even but the branch said that they was separated from the written their dominion and the life when they left the garden Adam and Eve they were determined to die they were determined to die boga promised that in the end time he were going to restore again an allow men to be connected again to life we know that through time and century the book was sealed inside the book what the mistress seal of how man was going to return to his inheritance to his Dominion and how men was going to be connected a game to life to never die again 1963 the Lord Himself descended from heaven with the sharp the voice and the trumpet this 7 Thunder revealed the mystery of the book by which the lamb out of this seal the lamb opened the seal and the angel brought this book with one foot on the sea and on the earth roar as a lion roar the Bible say when he wrote seven Thunder ordered a voice John was about to write but he was not allowed to read the minister the mystery that was preserved for this time what what the mystery is talking about how man was going back to life how he was gonna be connected to life how he was going to be connected to eternity so beloved I believe that these ministers will be indeed with the Holy Ghost but a perfect season of the seven seals to bring forth an open the proper of God say if this man not cheap to catch this in Abrahamson if this man catch this they will bring the people to a place I have brought the world in seed for that will put a better sense they will put the right sense beloved I
