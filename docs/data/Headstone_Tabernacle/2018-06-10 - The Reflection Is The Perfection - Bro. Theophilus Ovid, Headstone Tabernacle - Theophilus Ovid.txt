father we thank you for your word any man could read scriptures and text and context and whatever but it take the Holy Spirit to really bring a revelation inspiration and transformation to the lives of the people and we invite you the Living Word to come forth this morning and speak to our hearts and make your would manifest make your with alive and quickly to your people may your grace drop down Lord and see the needs of the people and minister to the needs father granted Lord we wait on you in Jesus and we ask it amen and amen you will be seated oh praise the Lord is good to be in the house of God it's great to be in his presence Oh blessed be the name of the Lord our title this morning the reflection is the perfection that's the title of this morning the reflection is the perfection and I want to say I was pleased here on this it to be perfect we were pleased here on this earth to be perfect not to feel not to fall that's what our fathers did that's what Adam did that's what Eve did they fell and because they fell we born in a fallen condition but Christ came and he came now to replace what a change or the transformed that whole scenario of what happened back there do you believe that so I believe in a sifting time at time to see who will to stand the test under the trial by the word it has been a word time a reproach of the word time a wilderness time a trying time a time of teaching a time of prophecy because when the time of manifestation comes in over all glory does God have to have a see time and have to have a harvest time it have to have a see time and after the rain time it after at the time of Revelation have to have the time of manifestation we have been living in the time of Revelation and know about the transition into the time of manifestation we have been living under the ministry of the word but we are about to transition into the ministry of the spirit or glory to God because to go back to perfection you have to go before the beginning because it beginning is the creation of time and every team have a beginning have an end then I'm gonna go into perfection it had no beginning it had no ending well glory to God so before the word before the beginning there was spirit because in the beginning was the word but before I was where there was spirit in the beginning was the word before there was a winner was assort and you were in those thoughts you were in God thoughts that is the reason you were here this morning Oh glory to God because you're part of the thoughts of God all glory does gautham because they bypass the word you have to fight in the test but that is what you were placed here for or blow it up because you buy trash away buddy because you might pass your Co for me you were pleased to be tried stop complaining you a place to be tested stop complaining you replaced to be home to be pleased to be shaped you'd be placed to be confirmed after this battle is over after this time is over we go back to where we came from we go back to the original state back in that atomic condition back to the Garden of Eden [Applause] you see a spring of Prayer here and he saved you from the world saying let us lay aside Lord every toil of the day every care of this life all the way from the janitor to the pasta that there will be nothing in our minds now but be waiting listening reverently for the Holy Spirit to speak to us that we might accomplish something good to know more of d by our gathering together for Lord truly that's why we come on this hot day speak to us should I live in word let the Living Word dwell in us abide in us that we might be shaped and formed not to the world but to be transformed by the renewing of our spirit into the form of the Son of God o our hearts tremble when we think and the joy floods our soul to know that we can be called sons and daughters of God and we stand on the very brim of his second coming on all nations and kingdoms quivering under our feet all things of the world is vanishing but knowing that someday he shall come and take us to a kingdom they shall never be an end and it'll never be moved and to think that we are now the subjects of that Kingdom Oh God circumcise our heart and ears today by the holy spirit to the washing of the water by the word for we ask it in his name for his glory amen what could we give the Lord amen I'm not prayer the Prophet three okay let's get down now quickly from fundamental foundation of feet for the manner when he was here in it I see this may be out of repetition I don't mean it that way I've said it before but let's look at his life a few moments and see what type of person he was then you can have an idea of what he should be today when he was here on earth he was a perfect example of everything of the Godhead he was the fullness of the Godhead bodily in Christ was God the body of Jesus was only the tabernacle of God it's where Almighty God Himself lived and dwelt in a human being you believe that don't you you have to be saved you have to believe that he was Daisy himself made flesh here on earth to manifest here we go his love to the people and to take away the sin of the earth he came here in order or here we go that he could anchor debt in his own body because once you're born of a woman you wanna die so he came to take this thing of that and hold it to himself because once he take it they don't have to have set you know more so the songwriter said death hath no power over the blood wash ones all that matters is not the myth this is not to get too real Pentecostal this is enough to get to dancing death hath no power over the blood wash once no one deposit debt where is your sting grave where is your victory [Applause] as the first time that felt ashamed first time man could talk back to death first romantic challenge yet because of what Jesus did Calvary he came to take that and anchor it and because he live [Applause] do you get it he took that he died but he rose and when he rose we rose with him that's my port to see your death where is your sting Jesus took the sting of the death yet still moving along but you don't have the sting or give the Lord a shout the wages of sin is death and because man sinned he was subject to death but now this morning we are subject to the resurrection power of Jesus Christ we'll give the Lord our show this very day [Applause] he came on it - anchor debt in his own body he can anchor sickness his own body that is why the Bible say by His stripes you were healed because he handled your sickness he handle your diabetes the high blood pressure your female condition your heartache your cancer your humor your also we handle all of that Oh give the Lord a shout that's right is healing in the name of Jesus there is power in the name of Jesus [Applause] he is here wherever the word as years because he underworld is the same do you have the word with you he is with you do you have the word in you he's in you he's in his own words he moves with his word he moves by his word he has to confirm his word oh he loves to vindicate his word he loves to reveal himself or give the Lord a shout or one of these days you know get on who you are and it will come out your nonsense you will get to new you are and it will come out your lack of confidence you will captain who we are and you have your blessed assurance of faith that wherever you put your foot is yours even have the assurance of faith that no weapon former can't you bring the prosper even have the assurance of faith but nothing present ought to come to stop you from connecting to your regional and state that you hadn't God [Applause] because because of how we were born you need to come to church I got a reconfiguration a new operation they got the clogs and getting wheels moving because all that the teeth at the gears have been rusted in your heart and mine and l'espérance ate the Chris that ought to be on you he took upon it himself everybody should be Shelton nobody should not be watching mascara because that should be on you he took himself so you can't walk in here like a curse like your blight like your on the darkness like hell and you living together you can't walk in here like that shame on you you walk in here like that [Applause] he became sin that Myka become righteousness he took your place that we could take his place Paul in the spirit John in the spirit what manner of love is this that we can be called the sons of God smokers drinkers adulterers phony get as liars prostitute mongers junkets what manner of love is this he talked about love that we could be called [Applause] he maybe season that we could be just called the sons of God just be called the sons of God we until we enjoy the perfection when there is nothing against you we struck that not that powerhouse when you come to the realization there is not one thing against you when the a huge rock using goes in nothing nothing I check the record nothing it look like this get blood on it it looked at like only notes kept blood it look like I can read what the accusation is I only seen blood on this page next page is blood next page is still blood Satan you want to continue because only blood this is a blood message we are redeemed by blood not just forgiving but redeemed redeemed mr. Pena back reading mr. catcher back into position greedy mister bring it back in the place where else was supposed to be originally [Applause] and the original man was a perfect man the original man was a man in God's image and likeness so if we have to go back here we have to go back to add the reflection of what Adam had of what Jesus had we have to go back to that reflection which gonna be a living fate a living virtual a living knowledge not something bigger than aboard those are letters and colors on a board we're not talking about that [Applause] we're talking about the Thunder that shakes the devil devil know in that tunnel devil no one is more than talk or give the Lord a shout the reflection will be the perfection not the explanation is the perfection or sale again not how to explain it [Applause] live in knowledge live in temperance live in patients live in godliness live in brotherly kindness how you know them live in how you know it living it has to be tested suppose the dead a man lying on a bed he's supposed to be alive be not sure you look at your Harry breathing you touch him so he movie coal mine stone that he was human he was alive but he's dead I'm X about looking that but he in some kind of coma I'm touching your Excellencies breathing still something going wrong that's many pop up normal normal well how do we know these things is alive doctor pocket and look it look like they don't want to see him [Applause] that is not talk but about selling this way sittin denarii personal this not L done did you know these are Geneva know sittin will make you prove everyone a virtues so say it I'm not even taking for granted you say you have that okay I come in no no no no no no no no no no no not now double back now don't pull back on me now because he coming he coming still coming why you think you're selling a fool to let you know you how more that to get is that to embarrass you is that a shame you is to make you understand it has more power where you come from and I'm more power to coming to you because jesus said if ye abide in me and my words abide in you on Osama chance you should be sotin because you don't have the authority to act what whatever you will [Applause] so you may be seated now let's take that scripture and let's play back rewind the tape of Jesus I haven't 5,000 people to feed because they here is so man he know they hungry they come from fat distances they have no Maxine no taxi no bus to take them back home laughter walk where they come from and five loaves to fish is presented to Jesus one in cyber say what are these among many think about what we just read in the scriptures if he abide in me my words abide in you ask whatever you will take the bread blessed it as this year as far as i concerned the story end as far as the company finish pray it's finished five laws two fishes and it's done he could turn his back and walk away I didn't know five potion people gonna be fed with bread and fish because if you bother me my words are bad and you could ask whatever you will you could tell the debt to be raised up because the Lazarus come forth or glory no God you could heal this if you can raise the dead you get faster dollars because you are Noah defeated generated son of God now the word has become flesh inside of you and you're reflecting the Messiah life every devil he'll know the same reflection because a reflection or glory of God that's the perfection Oh hallelujah praise God hallelujah [Music] [Applause] the morning star reflects the light of the uncommon Sun it's something hitting that morning star so for you can reflect something to be hitting you something I'll be striking you you can reflect but not inside of you so when you figure if every devil know listen that power knock me out in Irina's day it's not Matt and Paul they look they're coming to come and run praise God and devil start to run all I know this I know I'm that reflection I'm seeing I know that also the world went rock and shake under the reflection of Jesus Christ in the Omega bride and Noida with the capstone [Applause] they haven't they haven't ceases an action yet the only hereness and prophesy and laugh and and scuffin because we are not afraid to prophesied the word another caught bombs a reason people love Chris because my magic reason the reason love leads it because man make it I went man make it that's it you do not have stretch fit you gotta press fit browser the Kimura was preached and when present it you see man preaching the kingdom say that the press that so then people relaxed as far as the do they reach already because man make the creed see it to off aren't really married and your business fix fitted a sprinkle to holy water on you on your business fix just go to the priests lmj Tooting overhead and then take that and they believe that then they walk away there's no pressing this have no overcoming it has no make yourself a Christian doesn't have that it does not much prevailing and groaning and sighing and crying and believing and striving and struggling it doesn't have that that's not my press towards the math of the high quality it doesn't have Manmeet Creed but Aban says the cliffs that ought to have been you he took it upon himself after died as a man in order to redeem you back to this full fellowship with the father again what a marvelous thing our heart our hearts can't conceive what I think that was what he did we are too slow listen our minds are sluggish the vows have been stopped up they are being paralyzed by unbelief and free and doubt and it can't flow free like it should do it unless we let the Holy Spirit so dominate our lives till it pushes those files to life begin to start operating you don't need new values and you need the Holy Spirit to get them values working then pistons inside early so let me go let's go you could go some more then here we go this is big this is big then unconsciously your faith is there [Applause] I know you didn't get that but the fit is there you don't have to worry about where they got feet enough to do this or face enough to do that it's tne how you do it because the father said so and it's the living wood in you that is why to apply the blood the token the Prophet said they got common weeds that he could find anywhere and take it dip it in but apply it they were planning for anything happen before there were signs wonders power manifestation old pouring you apply it lord i applying this to my life i'm pinus to my home I'm tying this to my heart I'm applying feet I'm applying virtue that's that's the blood I'm applying knowledge I'm applying temperance that's the blood I'm buying patience I'm applying botany kindness I'm trying that's the blood you see in there and some devil tell you that tell even you that they were lying to you it's Cantler than him I could guarantee you that I can guarantee that is not going to live in him but not going to live in our bride there is going to be seven live voices or glory to God hallelujah there's gonna be seven living voices the wife good to see it your husband good to see it your family gonna see it no excuses you'll be reflecting it I could to come on inside of you or glory to God listen our sheep don't distress himself out and so God when I get wool this year take a deep breath hmm breathe out breathe in notice she taught to breathe out and breathe in because the Sheep is a sheep and eaten grass and whatever it be as wool it comes out because of the impact I was on the inside of the commodity outside so the devil I want a car don't want to rub you with Christianity on the outside [Applause] when you're hungry you don't rub your chicken on your belly she went you went this is little you're hungry you have to eat it but they go on the inside glory another white thing all those prophets as I either would why didn't God said take the book and in the book because when they eat that you become it you become what you eat so they have to become the word to speak the word because they represented God himself [Applause] the word itself is God you are not defeated the word is your victory the word is your strength the words you anointed [Applause] listen listen don't let dry wood fool you because they dry it is still God a virgin shall conceive that was God wrapped up in a prophecy from Isaiah it float along a little 400 years but it was still God it's a come to pass this year but still God is last year but [Applause] still God but one day when Mary comes forward that word connected to Mary and when that word committed to Mary's fresh [Applause] or give the Lord a shout you may be seated come on some point in time you will not be coming to hear words that be pasta expanding and preaching some point you have to connect your flesh your feet have to connect with you would and when you begin to hear you be seeing your name hearing your name seeing your inheritance seeing your promises no man to take that from you away from you the Spirit is upon me the Spirit is upon you the word coming to you the word is revealing to you true you value you yourself becomes close revelation sitting down here and if you becomes cross revelation then you begin my channel to worship God no one that John's at all in heaven all under the head i john praise god because you got a revelation that we shall reign here he didn't ever understand them of how to come back because when man dive is going in that back dimension but we were born to be on the earth John was in the spirit but when John saw it he's a we shot rain on it that's a guarantee [Applause] guaranteed and if you are we gonna reel in the earth we have to stand and we know we have to have reign over ourselves and that's what them virtues come to accomplish to give you authority over this self man authority over your desires [Applause] authority over your ambition authority over your will that's what Jesus did not my will but I will be done before he got to that script revs engine 57 Jesus shared with disciples this would I am The True Vine and my father is the husbandman Yahoo my father is not an onlooker he's active in dealing with the plant life the husband - Amanda's prune and cut and deal with the trees is the husband man here we watch a man Jesus teaching them every branch in me that beareth NOT fruit he taketh

have a revelation that you're going through your season your trial your tribulation your testing but one day they're gonna come true come on now cast not away your confidence one day you wanna come true hold the God's unchanging hand one day you're gonna come true joy your show to knows [Applause] jesus said now you are clean to the word which I have spoken unto you he didn't say you're a clean cut Ichabod you clean Trudy would know I didn't say that's a nice gesture that's a question do you believe that the word has make you clean how shall a young man cleanse his way by taking heed on

the word is God making you clean [Applause] and brought Justin his sons to see if they will stay with that word because when you receive the word you become the word then the spirit makes you the living would that is why Jesus saw no need to use Godhead power on the devil in the wilderness he just said it is written it is written it is also written take that and see you next and met wrongs and walked away and he was God's example son what about us for me is 12 the titter he was in the word knowing the promises harmon revelation no manifestation 8 years are silenced 18 years and no signs no wonders no miracles no declaration of who hears and who sent him nothing at all just silence 18 years written to commented ministry 18 years instead to wait because John has come on the scene yet 18 years and wait until John come another blasts and boss and rip open same as one standing among you he's gonna baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire John I'm a direct message from the kingdom I am sent to make away Oh Clawd horrid King is coming Oh blowing Oh God John already on the same llaves witness the one upon whom that does come and remain that's the one John John seat John see Dublin and this one I take off Dublin and that one on take off even hoodia he's just watching for same but when that Dublin on Jesus does not moving because he is the lamb lamb and does moving together wherever Jesus going doc going to John see the latter develop on Jesus he knew that was Messiah he said behold the lamb of God Oh hallelujah Jesus under the anointing of that lamb say you yes you I could baptize you but behooves us to fulfill all righteousness gee I got baptized and then John solemn disciple is lazy man guess what he can force them someone with Jesus some say but John they love brother John and they forever remain John's disciples but those who were looking at it prophecy know that John came to introduce Messiah and when you capture the introduction you forget the introducer didn't get that when you're kept this is that you follow that [Applause] so Jesus speaking to his disciples naughty church members his disciples abide in me and I in you here is mystery as the branch

food for me through the bride and by the bride will be fulfilled all so that bride has to be connected to define itself not some church not some denomination not some Sahagun comes in local or foreign but the divine itself [Applause] not some headquarters divine I am divine who's talking Jesus talking you are the branch let's continue what I am the vine you are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and caused him to be born Danny when don't you see if he abide in me and my words abide in you or praise the name of the Lord so the same Holy Spirit that see if the Lutheran's sign Phi the Methodist Baptist Pentecostal is now
