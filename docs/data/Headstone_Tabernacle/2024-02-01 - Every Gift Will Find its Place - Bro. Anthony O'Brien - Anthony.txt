brother Steven oliv and the song service was just tremendous amen so we in this amen praise God praise God so we're in the spirit tonight so let's just turn to our Bibles and I just have one reading and um hopefully that shouldn't keep us too long um but there's a few verses there in Matthew Chapter 2 I want to read from 1 to 12 strange place tonight for me and uh well we just came out of Christmas but this scripture reading talks about the three wise men and um well we'll get into it tonight amen this is what God uh has give me tonight now Matthew Chapter 2 and verse 1 says now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king behold there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem saying where is he that is born King of the Jews for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him when Herod King heard had heard these things he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together he demanded of them where Christ should be born and they said unto him in Bethlehem of Judea for thus it is written by the prophet and thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah art not the least among the princes of Judah for out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule My People Israel Isel and then Herod when he had priv called the wise men inquired of them diligently what time did the star appear he sent them to Bethlehem and said go and search diligently for the young child and when ye have found him bring me word again that I may come and worship him also and he uh verse 9 says when they had heard the king they departed and lo the star which they saw in the east went before them until it came and stood over where the young child was amen so the supernatural star LED them right to the child uh and it says now when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy and when they were come into the house they saw the young child with Mary his mother and fell down and worshiped him and they had open their Treasures they presented unto him gifts gold and frankincense and uh and and myr and being warned of God in a dream that they should not returned to Herod they departed into their own country another way may God have blessing to the reading of his word let's just pray one more time Heavenly Father Lord we've read your word tonight we pray all that you would come in your own sweet way and minister to your hearts of your people father you know the thoughts that you have placed upon me Lord father I pray that you give me the what it takes Lord to Lord uh uh uh P PRACK this word Lord and to just uh get out of the way father so that Lord your presence could come and Minister and speak to our hearts Lord whatever you want to say tonight you take control father we just give ourselves to you now for service so father we have your way tonight Lord and Bless the people Lord as they as they as they worship you may the word be a edification to us tonight in Jesus name amen and amen okay you may be seated praise God amen praise God so God bless you tonight certainly privileged to be here in his presence amen amen glory so I have a title tonight amen so without further delay um praise God every gift will find its place that's my title tonight amen and my inspiration is that Ministry when positionally place will identify Jesus Christ amen that's my uh inspiration amen praise God and uh of course well you know I was studying the scriptures and uh I think it was not last Wednesday but Wednesday before last um something just came to me um that every gift would find his place right and so I went back into the message that brother Bram preached on that God's Gift always finds their places and I went back into it and then God started to show me some things in there um about the 5o ministry praise God and stuff like that so that's that's what I have tonight amen praise God that's what that's what that's what came to me amen so so in studying this book out here these three wise men come from the East isn't that right three wise men and the prophet said on that same message he said it took wise men to pick up what God was doing to pick up what was taking place because there was a great prophecy laying in the in in the Zodiac which was God's first Bible and these men were astrologers and so they were studying this this zodiac until all of a sudden they picked up a sign in the stars that something was supposed to happen something was supposed to take place isn't that right and so they began to pack with them their revelation of what they saw this sign to be amen isn't that right Hallelujah and I don't know if they all started off together the Bible doesn't quite describe it but when they met up they all had gifts praise God they didn't come empty-handed Hallelujah but when they saw the sign they brought their Revelation praise God they brought their gifts with them oh Hallelujah and tonight we see a sign we see something happening in the word praise God it causes us to come out from where we are we step out from where we are we leave our country we left our churches we left where our communities we left our family to follow after this sign that we see happening in the world today oh Hallelujah isn't that right praise God when God shows you something you cannot stay where you are when God reveals himself to you you cannot remain where you are you have to come out oh Hallelujah God spoke to Abraham and he said walk before me and be therefore perfect oh Hallelujah you can't stay where you are if you want Perfection come on now you can't stay where you are if you want the Holy Ghost you can't stay where you are if you want to be healed if you want to be delivered but come come to the Fountain come to the waters Come to the River there is a River of Life tonight which you can't stay where you are if you want healing from that River you can't stay where you are if you want strength from that River there is a fountain filled with blood that's drawn from Emmanuel's veins and sinners plunged beneath that flood lose all their guilty stains oh how many want to plunge in tonight how many want to dive in tonight oh somebody say amen hallelujah somebody say praise the Lord oh hallelujah hallelujah amen amen hallelujah so the prophet said it took wise men praise God hallelujah amen there's something about these men they had the ability to see and understand things that normal people couldn't really see that's the ability to see and interpret things that normal people couldn't interpret oh understand it's a sign now all these things are symbols these Tre Magi isn't that right one come from Arabia one from Persia from different places in the world they were not Jews they didn't grow up in the temple they didn't know about the scriptures concerning Isaiah they didn't know about that all they saw was a sign and that was enough for them all they saw was a sign in the sky that was declaring something they had been alive for many years but they never seen anything like this this drew them out from their country out from their priesthood out from their comfort zone something about this sign drew them out from where they were drew them to a new place drew them out to a new country drew them out to a new people oh hallelujah hallelujah they had the correct interpret ation and it was proven because when they went in Jerusalem they said where is the king of the Jews because that's what the sign told us oh Hallelujah isn't that right and our sign tells us that our Revival is coming our sign tells us that a Holy Ghost is coming a sign told us oh Malachi 4:5 and 6 God sent a sign behold I sent unto you Elijah the prophet oh Hallelujah he sent to you you the individual God loved you so much that he raised up a prophet and sent him to you oh Hallelujah to turn your hearts back to the faith of the fathers oh Hallelujah and it is these Divine mystery truths that literally turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers back to the faith that has laid down on the day of Pentecost when men were born again by the spirit of the living God when this pyramid was born in the hearts of men by the Holy Ghost and Fire God come in there and he'll do it one more time he's going to do it tonight do you believe it same and somebody woo sh hallelujah oh I feel inspired tonight Glory Glory Hallelujah oh Hallelujah so it's not so much about the sign and the Magi you can trace the Magi back somewhat in scripture amen isn't that right and it's connected to Magic and that whole root word and astrology and Zar asianism and stuff like that but it's a it's a symbol God was using you see so it's symbols isn't that right and you have to be able to see what God is pointing you to is a truth isn't that right that God is pointing you to now God's Gift all find always finds their places here's a prophet here now on uh 76 he said now look uh what how beautiful those gifts see they pack gifts with them is that right he said those gifts fit into Jesus Christ see gold speaks of his deity he said now there wasn't heathens they were inspired by God can we say Amen y we're not heathens tonight we're inspired by God hallelujah is not they wasn't imagining something he said that proves it right there oh even the mega they that they did see the supernatural because their own gift that they offered identified and spoke well of their testimony that they did see the supernatural light why because it speaks perfectly he said they brought gold which means deity they brought frankincense which means service and they brought mer for his death and when he was a baby showing that deity would be put to death in In the Flesh amen he says isn't that right that it might redeem Fallen man he said now how can people turn that down he said when you realize what are we doing out here Prophet said where did we come from where did we come from tonight he said what's our business being here he said we was not put here by chance we were put here for a purpose oh tonight we were put here for a purpose all of you here tonight was put here by a purpose you weren't drawn here by a natural but it was a supernatural light oh that shed light on the world for you to walk in your hour for you to walk in your day for you to walk in your season you are not just anybody but you have a purpose in God God knows your purpose and the devil's job has going to get you away from your purpose oh Hallelujah to distract you to keep you off the beaten patch but God dispatches Ang Angel he said behold I sent my angel before thee to keep you in the way L you dash your foot against a stone that angel is on the earth that angel come on now has been doing battle for you while you didn't even know he was fighting for you he was fighting for your wife fighting for your husband fighting for your children while you were on your knees that angel was fighting oh and as long as T kept praying that angel kept fighting you've got to pray tonight until you pray through and when you pray through that angel will break through oh it's connected to prayer the Angel's Victory it's connected to your prayer so keep on praying brother keep on praying keep on praying don't let the devil steal your joy don't let the devil tell you not to pray tell him sit down shut up Satan watch me pray you sit there and watch me praise God you sit there and watch me worship God in your face Hallelujah give Lord a shout of Praise sh oh Hallelujah defy the armies of Lucifer defy the armies of Satan you are raised up for such a time as this oh Hal Give the Lord a shout of Praise hallelujah hallelujah woo amen so he wasn't put here by chance we were put here for our purpose and we must serve that purpose amen that's what the prophet says amen and I believe it but still he said we're on the back on the basis of free moral agency where we can serve it or reject it just like Adam did in the beginning he said but we find out fur down he said we find out that they accepted these gifts from these wise men he said no wonder they were called wise men he said they were wise they really had wisdom he said if men today would just be that wise just as wise it takes a wise man to come to Christ oh Hallelujah I see wise men here tonight I see Wise Women here tonight because you made it to Christ you made it to church here tonight you made it into the sanctuary you made it in the atmosphere of God and God's going to bless you God's going to reward you your faith God's going to reward your perseverance God's going to reward your prayer your prayer can't fall to the ground no it's being stored up in a V trip by trip Prayer by prayer word by word sanation being stored up for such a time as this and when God's ready he's going to pour out the vials whatever in your vials is going to come down as blessings hey so store our praise tonight oh in your VES oh store up groanings and crying store up signs oh hallelujah it's going to return our blessing for you tonight amen do you believe it tonight okay wow he said a man that takes a wise man to come to Christ a man that turns away from him mean Jesus is an unwise man see but it takes a wise man to come to Christ he said now God guided the my guy because they had the right gifts right oh they had the right gifts the right gifts if they didn't have the right gifts God might have turned them away but because they had the right gifts God said I'm going to lead you all the way brother I'm going to make a path straight for you praise God no Bandits are going to come in your way no evil is going to befall you no plague will come now thy dwelling why because you had the right gifts you had the right thing to identify Jesus Christ oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Glory oh my amen so God guided his wise men because they had the right identified gift to identify his son oh God loves his son he's concerned about his son so if you're going to bring a gift make sure it's the right gift oh if you're going to come into the presence of God better come holy come right present your body a Living Sacrifice unto God holy and acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you might prove what is that acceptable and perfect will of God oh Hallelujah God demands respects oh and he want honor for his son Jesus oh so come with your Praises come with your worship come with your hands raised come with your shouting Hallelujah blessing and honor glory and power don't come dead God don't want to call formal worship after 50 years in this message we don't want no call formal worship get on fire for God on a Wednesday night yes get on fire for God oh Hallelujah fire don't have no date on it getting on fire is not for Sunday only it's not for Wednesday only it's for every day of the week get on fire for God oh be zealous therefore he the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand amen oh my serve your purpose frankincense serve God Jesus was Jehovah's servant Propet brought that out in the message here I don't have a b have time to read it but uh frankincense isn't that right it represents God in service God in service therefore God became his his own creation to serve himself mindblowing isn't that right but that's what the commission of Christ come to fulfill and boy did he fulfill it oh and the devil did try to come against it oh but he can't stand against that word that word told him in the wilderness it is written it is written it is also written and defeated the devil just by the word alone oh Hallelujah do you believe it amen my and that's what the bride will have today to face that same devil she's got to have that same word to beat him with Amen to conquer him with to overcome him with amen oh thank God for his word tonight amen my he give us the one of the greatest weapons he could ever give was the word of God all of the authority of God is laying in his word oh Hallelujah sickness has to roll back doubt has to roll back depression has to roll back when the word of God comes down into the picture oh hallelujah hallelujah watch your demons fly watch your Devils fly when you stand on that word oh Hallelujah devil is no match for you brother Glory because the word is God oh Hallelujah Hall isn't that right oh Hallelujah and the divine revelation will show you hallelujah what to do with that word amen how to place it there praise God what to say how to say it God told his disciples don't you worry don't take any thought what you shall say on that day but I'll give you a mouth to speak I'll put my words in your mouth to confide to confound the wise to confound the rulers oh Hallelujah when the Holy Ghost came down there at Pentecost God put words in Peter's mouth oh and he said be baptized oh in the name of your the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost oh hallelujah hallelujah and this promis is unto you andto your children and as many as are far off and to many as God shall call oh this promise of the Holy ghost is for us here tonight God put it in Peter's mouth and that word is still the same today yesterday forever oh do you want it do you want that same holy ghost that same portion that may receive Supernatural light oh Hallelujah that light that let over three wise man let there be light the Bible says in him was light and he was a light of men and that light uh that word became flesh and dwelt Among Us and his life was a light amen if we walk in his life then we walk in the light walk in in the light of God Amen isn't that right okay let me move on Amen praise God all right so he said wise men today rise in the name of the Lord he says I believe that's me that's you tonight amen rise in the name of the Lord not with some fictitious something but with a gift that God promised for this day by identification you see so it wasn't a MAG interpretation of what the star was they just came according to what they saw oh and it Dove tail with the scripture because when they shake up Jerusalem so Herod say search the scriptures and they went and they found it praise God H the prophecy concerning the uh the Messiah that was to come for they found the scripture they sign T tail with the scripture oh and whatever God show you have to tie into that word oh have to point back to this Bible oh whatever spoken whatever is said whatever is revealed once it tie with this Bible then it come from God oh then stay with that word stay with that word oh stay with it the prophet said Keep On Moving brother just keep moving God send us some more he says send us some more but just keep moving God give you something stay with it oh if it's not the word kick it out but if it's up the word stay with that word and keep moving oh Hallelujah until every fell takes his place oh H until every gift Finds Its place until every Ministry Finds Its place then the Philistines will go to backing up oh Hallelujah that's a promise in the word amen oh my let me hurry on praise God okay and God will guide you see to identify Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever there you are wise man God guided those gifts because they were the gifts to identify him and he said wise men today who can look away from church anity and all the things of the world or do you see it wise men do you see the type now to identify Christ took wise men to do it to identify him so wise men who could look away from churchianity look away from Creeds look away from dogmas look away from Community leaders and what they say and the group think if you could look away from that oh to The Living Word of God the prophet said he said and God will identify his son by his word because that is what he is oh he is the word and he will identify his son by the word therefore you have to come on the word in order to identify the word and be lined up with the word and when you do that God will show you a continuation of that word oh The Creation The Creator will step into his creation and fulfill the word in your life oh you're going to heal the sick you're going to raise the dead you're going to cast out Devils God will continue the works in you Greater Works than the shall you do because I go unto my father God's getting ready to Avail himself in you tonight somebody say Amen oh Hallelujah Oh Glory Glory oh my and he said and God will identify his son by the word as that's what he is and my father are one he said in the beginning was a word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and the same word today he's the same yesterday today and forever and and as a wise man follows that and a wise man follows that he says because that's what God takes care of to identify himself by it oh Hallelujah he takes care of his word so that he can identify himself by the word not your feelings not your intellect not what you came in here with tonight but by his word and if his word says you're going to be delivered then you're going to be delivered he can only honor his word he is obligated to meet you on the basis of his promised word oh he's going to meet you yeah so if he promise to heal you he's going to heal you if he promise to deliver you you're going to be delivered because you're standing on the word of God oh the devil cannot move us tonight if we're standing on that word amen do you believe it oh my oh my and the same way today the same yesterday forever all right now watch for these gifts these men brought they couldn't have brought to the prophet it would have uh it wouldn't have been right see them giftss couldn't not gone to

through everything it's broke up into sects here and the denominations and stuff he said these are my last words on this and I've tried real hard oh Hallelujah okay the prophet said on adoption 1960 he said how that God set some in the church through their labor pains oh they get tremendous sometimes but when a church is growing ring under the persecution of the outside world but believing on the Lord Jesus that he is the same today oh the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as real to us as it was to Pentecost he said oh how they cry they groan and cry under labor pains but when they are born and positionally Born Into the kingdom of God then the Holy Ghost has set in the church some Apostles some prophets some some teachers some pastors some evangelists then the prophet said he's giv to

heavens on Earth was to be born and they come with an expectation they come oh my knowing that deity excuse me would be enclosed in our house in a human being cause and to show their testimony your life speaks louder than your words do he says till no matter what you say people know you by what you are oh your life speaks louder oh you can say something with your mouth oh but when your life speaks oh that's how people judge you by the way you stay with that word you've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything that's how we've got to judge a thing by the way we stay with the word oh now where we say with our mouths but we could live without of our hearts isn't that right I watch these people these my guys they brought him watch the gifts they brought him identified what they thought he was they brought him gold frankincense M he said watch these symbols he said now I've got some scripture here I'll read in a moment gold frankincense M he said now in the Bible gold is
