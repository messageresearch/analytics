[17:46] as we would have announced this is the
[17:48] last uh bible study before
[17:50] our virtual convention which is coming
[17:52] up in just over two weeks
[17:54] just as a reminder to the church july
[17:57] 8th
[17:58] 9th 10th and 11th uh will be our annual
[18:02] virtual july convention uh there'll be
[18:05] two services
[18:06] on each of those days 8 9 10
[18:10] um 8 9 10 11 of july so be under great
[18:13] expectation
[18:14] be in prayer be in faith be in
[18:16] preparation
[18:18] you only get out of anything what you
[18:21] expect and what you put
[18:22] into it so i don't want you to take it
[18:23] for granted uh
[18:25] so we are still in the preparation mode
[18:28] and uh we thank god for his grace and
[18:30] his love and his mercy to allow us to
[18:32] have another virtual convention
[18:34] um this year um we are still in in new
[18:37] territory we we have not
[18:39] been this way before and each time we
[18:40] venture into this
[18:42] uh we realize that that it's a spiritual
[18:44] warfare
[18:45] and we have a spiritual responsibility
[18:48] we have spiritual battles and we have
[18:50] promised a spiritual victory and we know
[18:52] that what we see in the physical
[18:54] and in a natural exist only because
[18:56] there's a spiritual world
[18:58] what we see what we touch what we
[19:00] interact with
[19:01] you know are here because of what we
[19:03] cannot see so we want to be conscious
[19:05] in all our doings in all of our actions
[19:08] that we are creatures of eternity
[19:10] trapped in time
[19:11] and we have a responsibility to fulfill
[19:13] our higher calling so
[19:15] it is never a strain or stress on us
[19:18] to report for duty to be reminded of who
[19:21] we are
[19:22] and what we are called to do in such a
[19:24] time as
[19:25] this so i encourage you tonight uh by
[19:28] the grace of god i
[19:29] don't intend to be too long with you um
[19:32] this is supposed to be
[19:33] uh sort of a close-off class as it were
[19:36] um we'll have a two-week sabbatical
[19:38] two-week pause uh the 29th and the sixth
[19:41] and after the
[19:42] convention we will resume our classes so
[19:45] and um there's no written exam um
[19:48] i i i don't know if we'll have a written
[19:50] exam ever but
[19:52] there's a more important exam and the
[19:54] exam is an exam of our character
[19:56] you know and the exam is the exam of the
[19:58] token
[19:59] you know and i'm not qualified to
[20:01] administer that exam
[20:03] that exam is administered by the holy
[20:05] spirit himself
[20:07] at the end of the day all of our efforts
[20:09] all of our activities
[20:10] and our motives and objectives is to
[20:12] serve him to please him
[20:14] the lord and to ensure that we could be
[20:17] counted worthy
[20:18] of taking this word that has been given
[20:20] to us
[20:21] and putting it into action it is about
[20:24] that life you know but
[20:25] it speaks about that equation that at
[20:27] the end of the day the equal sign
[20:29] is not mystery the equal sign is not
[20:31] moving the mountain the equal sign
[20:33] is our life and our character being
[20:36] changed and being transformed
[20:38] you know so by the grace of god tonight
[20:42] um i would like um to just talk to you a
[20:45] little bit
[20:46] um i do have a little kind of thought
[20:48] but
[20:49] i love these sessions because you know
[20:52] we have to just lean on the lord to give
[20:54] us the right words to say the right
[20:56] things to help somebody to break past
[20:58] their limitations we place limitations
[21:01] on ourselves you know it's one thing for
[21:02] somebody to limit you and say you cannot
[21:05] do something or you cannot achieve
[21:06] something or you cannot have something
[21:09] but the most dangerous place to be is
[21:11] when you limit yourself
[21:12] and by your own thinking by your own
[21:15] actions
[21:16] by your own self-limiting beliefs you
[21:18] hinder your own
[21:19] progress and what we want to do is
[21:23] understand that as we get deeper in the
[21:25] word god wants us to become so
[21:27] light you know but i'm preaching about
[21:29] breaking past his sound barrier
[21:31] you know and he talks about when you
[21:32] come into contact with that song barrier
[21:34] there's
[21:35] there's some vibrations there's there's
[21:36] some resistance that you meet
[21:38] once you break past that sound barrier
[21:40] you begin to fly
[21:42] a different kind of fly you begin to
[21:43] worship a different kind of worship you
[21:45] know and um
[21:46] you know i really appreciate the the
[21:48] services that i've been going for
[21:50] and one thing i appreciate you know a
[21:53] lot of people may not understand
[21:55] how we operate and why we operate the
[21:57] way we do you know but when you
[21:59] look at how the profit operated the
[22:00] profit as much as you would teach
[22:03] the message you know he really you know
[22:06] brought a lot of focus on the right
[22:08] atmosphere you know the atmosphere is
[22:10] what
[22:10] is what bring the results you know and i
[22:12] was you know as i was watching you know
[22:14] so many of the services and i trust
[22:16] that as you experience the services
[22:21] a second time you know and in some cases
[22:23] maybe a third time
[22:24] you know and in some cases it might be
[22:26] like like like you say go look seven
[22:28] times
[22:28] because there was a service or two that
[22:30] i heard recently and i told by the way
[22:32] um i feel like i never heard those
[22:34] things before and i knew i was in the
[22:36] service
[22:37] you know um the the almost like i said
[22:40] the scarier one for me is when
[22:42] you know we played a message that i
[22:44] preach and i was like i can't remember
[22:45] preaching the message so i say
[22:47] that is that is when you know it's not
[22:50] no plan
[22:51] the thought as such but the reality is
[22:53] it is not just
[22:55] what is being said but the atmosphere
[22:57] and the anointing
[22:59] and the worship you know yes we could go
[23:02] and and and put a table and a microphone
[23:05] and speak
[23:06] you know and and that has its place but
[23:08] you cannot just
[23:09] replicate the anointing and and
[23:11] inspiration
[23:12] when the church comes together you know
[23:14] and i'm sitting there sometimes
[23:15] watching these services and i don't know
[23:17] what your experience is like
[23:19] but i miss being able to be in the house
[23:21] of god
[23:22] and and and run and shout and and
[23:25] jump and and get that what happens like
[23:28] in a day of pentecost when it was they
[23:31] were all
[23:31] they were all in the in the in the upper
[23:34] room and they were praising
[23:35] and they were worshiping and they were
[23:37] they were on fire and that kind of stuff
[23:39] so i trust that
[23:40] in your homes you are also feeding over
[23:43] that atmosphere
[23:44] and that you are not having the service
[23:46] as a as a
[23:48] as a multi-tasking event you know we
[23:51] have we have we have we we are in a
[23:52] society in a world now where people like
[23:54] to multitask
[23:55] you know they like to do two things at
[23:57] the same time treating at the same time
[23:59] so
[24:00] so so we're doing something and
[24:01] listening to a table or doing this or
[24:03] either
[24:04] i want to encourage you to to give god
[24:07] his due
[24:08] give god his respect put god first
[24:11] you know now we are being challenged
[24:13] more than ever as individuals to be
[24:15] priests in our own homes
[24:17] we are being challenged more than ever
[24:19] to take up the mantle of responsibility
[24:22] as christians when nobody is watching so
[24:25] i want to
[24:26] challenge you going forward even in this
[24:27] bible study here
[24:29] don't let this be a casual experience
[24:31] for you but if you put effort into it
[24:33] you're gonna get
[24:34] more out of it you know you're watching
[24:36] a tape
[24:37] do this as your as part of your worship
[24:39] part of your sacrifice
[24:41] part of your effort because the value
[24:43] you place into anything
[24:45] is what you get out of it so i want to
[24:46] encourage you tonight with that
[24:48] um so by the grace of god tonight
[24:51] um i want to continue a little bit from
[24:55] last week i was very cautious
[24:57] last week to call it a part one to
[25:00] venture into
[25:01] a part two um you know i have
[25:04] gotten in trouble quite a few times um
[25:06] announcing a part one and then the part
[25:09] two has not
[25:10] arrived um a sister actually wrote
[25:14] and asked about part two and three of
[25:16] daniel
[25:17] and basically said she don't know if
[25:20] it's an oversight that we didn't upload
[25:21] it
[25:22] um you know but i didn't get to really
[25:25] respond yet to say we never did it
[25:27] you know but god knows the burden in in
[25:31] my heart
[25:32] you know to dig and find these things to
[25:34] encourage a church
[25:36] but i do have to move as the lord leads
[25:38] and um
[25:39] you know sometimes situations come and
[25:41] the lord just show you something else
[25:42] and you want to go somewhere else and
[25:43] you know
[25:44] so by the grace of god tonight i i do
[25:46] want to take
[25:47] uh the same theme from last week
[25:50] and call it lost pain and betrayal part
[25:53] two
[25:53] and continue on the study of job because
[25:56] there are few things in there
[25:57] that i want to look at that we didn't
[25:59] get to touch a bit
[26:00] and maybe revisit some things but also
[26:04] look at a few things from a different
[26:05] perspective
[26:07] to make sure we capture it because like
[26:08] we said last week there are 42 chapters
[26:11] in job
[26:12] that's a lot that's a lot i don't know
[26:15] if any of the advanced students
[26:17] were able to spend some time between
[26:19] last week and this week reading
[26:21] job and going through the various
[26:22] chapters um
[26:24] so for those of you who are in the
[26:26] advanced class certainly i appreciate
[26:28] that
[26:28] and for those of you who are aspiring to
[26:31] be in the advanced class
[26:32] we will spend a little time tonight kind
[26:34] of digging a little deep in a few things
[26:37] to kind of cut some some elements in
[26:38] here you know so i don't want to revisit
[26:41] a lot of what we did last week i
[26:43] encourage you if you want to get the
[26:45] first class it is there on the youtube
[26:47] channel
[26:48] so i want to kind of pick up a few
[26:49] things and move by degrees of god
[26:51] tonight
[26:52] so last week we we we identified
[26:56] um from the book of job looking at job
[26:59] one
[27:00] uh there was a man in the land of us
[27:02] whose name was job and that man was
[27:04] perfect and upright powerful powerful
[27:06] powerful words it is it is only when you
[27:09] look at the entire book
[27:11] you could realize that one in chapter
[27:14] one
[27:16] the author who is god is speaking so
[27:18] this is not job
[27:20] speaking about himself in chapter one
[27:22] verse one this is not him describing
[27:25] himself this is not him
[27:26] speaking about himself this is god
[27:29] expressing something about this man job
[27:31] and god calls him perfect and upright
[27:33] one that feared god and stewed evil
[27:36] but by the time we get to job 42 we see
[27:39] a repentant job
[27:41] we see a job who is apologizing we see a
[27:44] job
[27:44] who is making things right we see a
[27:46] change job so i want to make a
[27:48] distinction now
[27:50] you know from top level as you see in
[27:51] business from a 50 000 foot view
[27:53] going way above the book you look at
[27:55] chapter one verse one we have god's
[27:57] thoughts on this man
[27:58] that he is perfect he is upright that's
[28:01] a
[28:02] testimony a powerful testimony this is
[28:04] not the church saying he is upright this
[28:06] is not
[28:06] his neighbors his friends his family
[28:08] this is god speaking about him
[28:11] on a top level perspective but but but
[28:13] by chapter 42
[28:15] we see it as if god has raised the bar
[28:19] on job without telling him the bow was
[28:20] raised and what does it catch that
[28:22] it is as if what was perfect and upright
[28:26] in chapter one is being reviewed by
[28:29] chapter 42.
[28:31] i don't know if you've seen that so god
[28:33] is speaking and speaking about a man or
[28:35] for
[28:36] somebody to describe you like this and
[28:38] more so for god to describe you like
[28:40] this
[28:41] yet still by the time we read chapter 42
[28:43] which we touched on last week
[28:45] we have a repentant job and if i could
[28:47] say it a
[28:48] changed job so automatically
[28:52] we see a progression in god
[28:56] that is really something else it shows
[28:58] then that
[28:59] no matter where you are walking because
[29:01] perfect and upright
[29:03] this was not a wicked man this was not a
[29:05] man who is actively pursuing sin
[29:07] this is not a man who is actively doing
[29:09] evil this is a man who has a testimony
[29:12] and god is requiring more from him
[29:16] and that there is is what i want us to
[29:18] catch on our first level
[29:20] god is requiring more from him at the
[29:23] end of the day
[29:25] if there is one major teaching we can
[29:28] take from this
[29:29] is this book is about call it an
[29:32] approximation to god
[29:34] because job out of all of the books is
[29:36] really a book of
[29:38] of speaking about perfection because it
[29:40] starts off speaking about
[29:42] a man who is perfect and upright and by
[29:45] job 42
[29:46] he is he is even more perfect he is even
[29:49] more upright
[29:50] it is not the same man in job 42 as iman
[29:53] in job 41
[29:55] and by every description the man in job
[29:58] 1-1
[29:59] we have a lot of work to do to be that
[30:01] kind of a man
[30:05] isn't that something else most of us may
[30:08] struggle to have the kind of testimony
[30:10] like the job one one man
[30:12] far less to be able to stand up to the
[30:14] scrutiny to be qualified as the job 42
[30:17] man
[30:18] the man who would have vindicated
[30:20] himself
[30:21] through many chapters in the book of job
[30:24] and yet still come to a crucial truth
[30:27] about the issues that he still had in
[30:29] his life which
[30:30] were not issues available to the public
[30:33] this was not the issue of lust
[30:35] and desire in his heart or greed or envy
[30:39] or jealousy this was not that can the
[30:41] church say man
[30:43] someone to challenge us now because one
[30:46] of the
[30:46] dangers of people coming to know the
[30:49] lord and coming to church
[30:50] is a level of comfort a level of feeling
[30:53] you have arrived and if it's anything
[30:55] that the book of job teaches us is
[30:57] there's no such thing as having arrived
[31:00] because there's so much to god and if
[31:02] there's one thing we learn in the book
[31:03] of job
[31:04] is god speaking a job saying how much
[31:06] job still
[31:07] was yet to know still was yet to
[31:10] understand
[31:11] still was yet to appreciate and that's
[31:13] why we can reference in scripture
[31:15] deuteronomy 29 29 the secret things
[31:18] belong on to god
[31:20] but those things which are revealed
[31:22] belonging to us
[31:23] and the reality as you look through the
[31:25] prophet's message and you look from
[31:27] genesis to revelation
[31:28] the bible is a book of progressive
[31:30] revelation it
[31:32] unfolds it unfolds it unfolds and as it
[31:35] unfolds
[31:37] you have to grow with what is unfolding
[31:39] is that helping anybody tonight
[31:41] so this gospel can never become boring
[31:45] this journey can never become boring
[31:48] because you could never cover the whole
[31:49] subject matter
[31:51] oh you don't hear me tonight oh i don't
[31:54] know if you
[31:55] i don't know if you're with me you know
[31:58] it is not as we have a set curriculum
[32:00] and will have finished the curriculum in
[32:01] the past it is not that
[32:03] because who in this room can know all of
[32:05] god oh my you don't hear me tonight
[32:07] when you read job it is one thing about
[32:10] about job
[32:11] is when job in the book and we see it
[32:13] referencing wisdom
[32:14] and how god is and what god so when god
[32:17] asks job the question in job 38 where
[32:19] was thou
[32:20] who measure it and all these things
[32:22] questions that job could have never
[32:24] answered in its entirety shows how much
[32:26] of god
[32:27] that we have to still know and discover
[32:29] anybody with me
[32:31] wonderful wonderful wonderful so i want
[32:33] to encourage us tonight
[32:35] that life is a life of pressing
[32:38] it's a life of overcoming it's a life of
[32:41] adding it's a life of increase
[32:43] so when i read job it becomes almost
[32:46] impossible
[32:48] for somebody to tell me they already
[32:50] know how they feel about the lord right
[32:52] now and these kind of things because
[32:54] that kind of suggests that you have
[32:56] exhausted all you can experience in god
[32:59] anybody with me so if you appreciate
[33:03] tonight
[33:04] that there's more of god that you have
[33:06] not tasted
[33:07] there's more blessings that you have not
[33:09] experienced there are more gifts that
[33:11] have to come that have not been accessed
[33:13] yet then it puts you on the
[33:15] expectation could it be that this is the
[33:19] kind of expectation
[33:20] they had in the upper room because they
[33:21] were expecting something they couldn't
[33:23] describe
[33:24] they were expecting something that
[33:25] didn't happen before
[33:27] but they were under expectation for
[33:29] something can the church say man
[33:31] all right so let's kind of get into the
[33:33] teaching i don't want to be too long
[33:35] with you so
[33:37] in looking at this you know the bible
[33:40] says with all thy getting
[33:41] get understanding i'm gonna be having a
[33:44] conversation we're not preaching we're
[33:46] just
[33:46] sharing we having a fireside chat um
[33:49] i wish you could kind of respond and but
[33:52] but
[33:53] it's too many people here tonight for us
[33:55] all to all speak so
[33:57] but i want us to have a conversation
[33:58] tonight you know and in
[34:00] preparing this i was writing down some
[34:02] questions
[34:04] you know and some kind of team some
[34:05] topics looking at this
[34:07] so i wrote down the conversations of job
[34:09] it's one of the phrases there are the
[34:10] conversations because
[34:12] a lot of the book of job is
[34:13] conversations i wrote another line
[34:16] the responses of job so this is me by
[34:19] the grace of god looking through the
[34:21] scripture
[34:21] so i want to kind of understand these
[34:23] conversations of job
[34:25] the responses of job ask the question
[34:28] can you speak like job
[34:31] because there were many things that job
[34:32] said
[34:34] that when i look at it i asked myself
[34:36] can i speak like job
[34:38] in other words job was defending himself
[34:41] and some of us cannot defend ourselves
[34:43] the way job defended himself
[34:45] i don't know if i'll get into all of it
[34:46] tonight but job was confident enough
[34:49] to defend certain things about his
[34:50] testimony
[34:52] anybody with me there were certain
[34:54] defenses
[34:56] that job could have made about his
[34:57] testimony that blows me away
[35:01] job was confident about certain things
[35:03] with the way he lived
[35:06] and we're going to touch it a little bit
[35:08] and then as i went oh and i said
[35:09] lessons from the life of joe and then i
[35:12] cannot end up on the seven conversations
[35:14] of job
[35:16] so ride with me a little bit the seven
[35:18] conversations of job so
[35:20] we established in last week's class that
[35:22] we had like four
[35:23] modules in the book of job there was
[35:26] chapter one
[35:28] there was where his wealth
[35:31] was attacked his family was attacked
[35:33] that was module one in chapter one
[35:35] in chapter two his health was a ch was
[35:38] was attacked
[35:39] then from chapter three to
[35:42] 37 there was this interaction
[35:45] with his friends so to speak and then
[35:47] from 38
[35:48] god got into the picture but now i want
[35:50] to look a little deeper than that
[35:52] and speak about call it the seven
[35:53] conversations of job
[35:55] to identify that job kind of had seven
[35:58] kinds of different types of
[35:59] conversations going on
[36:01] through these 42 chapters the first
[36:04] conversation that job had
[36:07] is kind of with himself and we're going
[36:08] to talk about that a little bit
[36:11] so there's the conversation joe will
[36:13] have with himself
[36:15] there's a conversation job had with his
[36:17] wife
[36:18] that's true there's a conversation that
[36:21] job had with his three friends
[36:24] you remember those three friends all
[36:26] right so the conversation you would have
[36:27] had with
[36:28] eliphaz bilder and zofa
[36:31] then the conversation with elohu
[36:35] and then the conversation with the lord
[36:37] so these are the seven
[36:38] types of conversations that job would
[36:41] have had
[36:43] looking at job one versus looking at job
[36:45] chapter one
[36:47] we see a situation as we did last week
[36:49] that job in chapter one
[36:51] is when he lost his house his family his
[36:53] wealth his animals all like that kind of
[36:55] stuff
[36:56] and by the end of job one job isn't
[36:58] really talking to anybody
[37:01] but job is sort of having a quality
[37:03] conversation with himself because it's
[37:04] not directed at a specific person
[37:07] this is when job arose and rent his
[37:09] mantle and shaved his head this is the
[37:10] end of job one
[37:12] and fell on upon the grunge and
[37:14] worshiped and said naked came i out of
[37:16] my mother's womb
[37:17] and naked shall i return to the lord
[37:19] gave
[37:20] and the lord had taken away blessed be
[37:22] the name of the lord
[37:23] and in all this job sinned not not
[37:25] charged foolishly
[37:27] so this is not directed at anybody this
[37:30] is
[37:30] the bible said worship this is almost
[37:32] like prayer it's almost like a
[37:33] conversation
[37:34] this is job sharing his heart this is
[37:36] him expressing how he felt
[37:38] in the middle of this suffering in the
[37:40] middle of your loss
[37:41] in the middle of the pain this is job
[37:46] all of us have to have the right type of
[37:48] conversation with ourselves
[37:50] we're going to touch it out a bit here
[37:51] and there i want to kind of move on a
[37:53] little bit to job 2.
[37:54] in job 2 we see a different conversation
[37:57] now bear in mind in job 1
[37:59] god is not speaking to job the
[38:01] conversations in job 1 and job
[38:04] 2 is above job's realm
[38:08] job is not aware of these conversations
[38:10] with god and the devil and these things
[38:11] neither in chapter 2 but in job
[38:14] chapter 2 we see the second main
[38:18] conversation
[38:19] this is the community with his wife we
[38:22] don't know a lot about
[38:24] job's wife but we do know a few things
[38:28] what do we know we know one
[38:32] that joe being an upright man being a
[38:35] perfect man
[38:36] being a man who lives a certain kind of
[38:37] life his wife would be a reflection of
[38:39] him
[38:43] so the way job live would have an impact
[38:45] on his relationship
[38:48] his testimony would have an impact on
[38:50] his wife
[38:51] everybody with me so it's not as his
[38:53] wife would be foreign to how he operated
[38:56] so we know that job and his wife
[39:00] we know for sure that she struggled
[39:02] under pressure
[39:04] because while job didn't feel like
[39:06] giving up
[39:07] we have his wife suggesting that
[39:11] he curse god and die and we read it last
[39:14] week
[39:15] job made very clear that when he said
[39:18] his wife speak like a foolish woman
[39:20] he said you speak as one who spiritually
[39:23] foolish
[39:24] ignorant and oblivious of god's will
[39:27] so at this point in time we have a
[39:28] conversation with job and his wife
[39:31] and at that point in time it is not as
[39:33] if job is falling apart
[39:36] it is not as if i guess the reality of
[39:38] it hits him of what is going on
[39:40] and we sort of end that conversation
[39:42] there and then we go
[39:44] just after that we have a situation now
[39:46] where all of the friends
[39:48] come to visit job and job is silent
[39:51] the bible said for how long remember for
[39:54] seven days
[39:55] and seven nights no one spoke a word
[39:59] and job is there alone with his thoughts
[40:04] saying nothing there's no there's no
[40:08] external conversation recorded
[40:11] but i don't know who could sit down for
[40:13] seven days and not have thoughts in
[40:14] their minds
[40:16] because here it was job is trying to
[40:18] figure out what is going on
[40:20] and the bible said his friend said
[40:22] nothing because they're respecting his
[40:24] solitude
[40:25] the quietness and the bible said most of
[40:27] all he saw that his speed
[40:29] was very great so job having his
[40:33] internal conversation because his
[40:36] internal conversation became his
[40:38] external conversation
[40:40] as reflected through the scriptures so
[40:42] we identified as well
[40:44] that from job chapter 3 when joe begins
[40:47] to speak
[40:48] and begins to express himself that it
[40:50] became a dialogue
[40:52] between job and his friends and it's one
[40:54] would speak
[40:55] and job would respond and it would sort
[40:58] of go like that
[40:59] and if he were to analyze it eliphaz
[41:02] would speak three times and job would
[41:05] respond
[41:06] three times bill dad would speak three
[41:09] times
[41:10] and job would respond to bilal three
[41:14] times
[41:14] zofa would speak twice as you begin to
[41:18] look at how it unfolds you will realize
[41:21] that the arguments
[41:23] of these brothers start off large and
[41:26] begin to get smaller
[41:28] so for example this is some
[41:31] top level teacher approach right so
[41:33] eliphaz
[41:34] his whole argument against job was the
[41:37] whole of chapter four
[41:39] and the whole of chapter five two entire
[41:42] chapters
[41:43] is eliphaz trying to speak to job
[41:46] and as eliphaz speaks he's increasing in
[41:49] his severity
[41:50] trying to reconcile job to god
[41:53] now i want to identify here that these
[41:55] three friends
[41:57] they share certain beliefs they share
[41:59] certain values
[42:00] they shared certain elements of doctrine
[42:03] job
[42:04] because of the nature of the man
[42:06] wouldn't be hanging around people who he
[42:08] didn't share some value with
[42:09] i want us to catch that for a minute so
[42:11] it is not on believers
[42:14] that job was hanging around with
[42:17] so we taught we touched this last week
[42:19] but it's not as if job was hanging
[42:21] around with people who ain't no god and
[42:23] who doing any word
[42:24] every single one of these people had
[42:27] the word to their understanding doctrine
[42:31] to their understanding belief to their
[42:33] understanding
[42:34] and they were using their understanding
[42:37] and their knowledge of the word
[42:39] in what would have been a very well
[42:42] intentioned attempt to help job
[42:45] there is nothing suggesting in scripture
[42:48] that these brothers have malicious
[42:50] intent
[42:51] i want us to catch that although when
[42:53] you understand what happened in
[42:54] chapter 42 where god rebuked them and
[42:57] god sent them to
[42:58] big sacrifice and one get prayed for it
[43:00] doesn't speak to the fact
[43:02] or suggest that these brothers had ill
[43:04] intent
[43:05] they were not trying to hurt job they
[43:07] were trying to help
[43:09] job so it teaches us a real powerful
[43:12] lesson
[43:13] somebody could have every intention of
[43:16] trying to help you and really hurt you
[43:20] big teaching so it allows us to
[43:24] re-evaluate
[43:26] this is not a matter of them not being
[43:28] job's friends
[43:29] there was a lot in common job wasn't
[43:31] hanging wrong with the village
[43:33] the village bajon this was people who
[43:37] he was comfortable with to call friends
[43:40] who shared certain beliefs but however
[43:44] they didn't have all of the pieces to
[43:46] really help you
[43:48] why because it did not understand what
[43:51] was happening so it challenges us
[43:55] because god in dealing with them
[43:57] and in speaking the job question how can
[44:00] you
[44:00] speak on these matters without having
[44:03] the right knowledge
[44:05] so automatically we are being challenged
[44:09] to where how we address situations
[44:12] when you don't have the right knowledge
[44:15] because that's a direct statement that
[44:17] god would make who darkened counsel with
[44:19] a lack of knowledge
[44:21] so the reason all of this is in
[44:24] scripture
[44:24] is for us to grow in knowledge in
[44:27] understanding
[44:28] and to see examples because god could
[44:30] have had this
[44:31] story of job a very simple story you
[44:33] know job had
[44:34] he lost he suffered and he was restored
[44:37] but it's not that simple
[44:39] i want us to catch through these
[44:41] scriptures it's not that simple god
[44:43] could have had it
[44:44] that it was one friend came and talked
[44:46] to him
[44:47] but god had three different individuals
[44:51] interact with job all trying
[44:55] i want you to catch this to help job
[44:58] anybody with me all right so we're
[45:00] billing a little bit
[45:03] they share beliefs they share values
[45:06] they share the elements of doctrine
[45:09] they demonstrated their friendship by
[45:11] their effort
[45:12] their time and what they saw as they
[45:15] attempt
[45:16] to help job
[45:19] eliphaz would try to reconcile job to
[45:22] god and induce him
[45:23] to repent we see that all through job
[45:27] four and five
[45:30] elephants would reference the fact that
[45:32] there's a universal principle
[45:36] that sin is a product
[45:40] and or or rather that suffering is a
[45:42] product of sin so job hatterson by the
[45:46] time eliphaz speaks again
[45:48] he belittles job self self justification
[45:51] and by the third time eliphaz
[45:53] speaks he goes back to the all hebrew
[45:56] idea
[45:57] that suffering always implies sin
[46:00] so he was given no room for god being
[46:03] involved in this matter at all
[46:05] and i want us to catch this could be
[46:06] going somewhere with it
[46:10] build that build that argument
[46:14] looks to the authority of tradition
[46:18] so he is saying all my experience
[46:22] all the history all the tradition we
[46:24] ever believe
[46:26] he asked job how long will he make
[46:28] speeches full of wind
[46:30] i want to go with me to job eat
[46:34] if you would
[46:38] we can't get to all of it so i'm just
[46:40] picking out a few of them
[46:42] and listen to the approach and listen to
[46:45] what is being addressed here right build
[46:48] that speech
[46:49] this is job eight and verse one
[46:53] then build that the shoe height then
[46:56] answered builder the shute and said how
[46:58] long will thou
[46:59] speak these things how long
[47:02] will the the words of thy mouth be like
[47:05] a strong wind
[47:06] in other words he said job talking and
[47:09] it's just
[47:09] noise does that god pervert judgment
[47:15] or does the almighty pervert justice
[47:19] listen to this and look how dangerous
[47:21] this this statement is here
[47:23] if thy children have sinned against him
[47:26] and you have cast them away for their
[47:28] transgression
[47:30] so bill that is set telling job the
[47:32] reason
[47:33] your children end up dying is because
[47:36] they sin
[47:37] and he cast them away for their
[47:39] transgression you understand
[47:41] why job would get affected by this
[47:44] and this was these brothers attempt to
[47:46] help jobs i want us
[47:47] to see is not just job suffered in
[47:50] chapter one
[47:52] and chapter two you know but how painful
[47:54] are these words to job in his ashy
[47:59] you know what it is to be going through
[48:01] grief and in the midst of your grief
[48:04] your brother telling you well it's
[48:06] because your children sin is why you're
[48:08] going through that so this here
[48:12] is actually more painful than the
[48:14] lawsuit
[48:16] it's as if you're rubbing salt in your
[48:17] wound anybody with me
[48:22] verse 5 if thou witness seek unto god
[48:25] be times and make thy supplication to
[48:27] the almighty
[48:29] if thou were pure and upright surely no
[48:32] he would awake for thee
[48:34] and make the habitation of thy
[48:35] righteousness prosperous
[48:38] though thy beginning but small yet thy
[48:41] latter end should greatly increase
[48:44] now this song is very encouraging this
[48:47] is
[48:48] encouraging yet scary because this
[48:50] sounds like something to encourage
[48:52] somebody
[48:53] if you repent though your beginning was
[48:56] small
[48:57] yet thy latter end should greatly
[48:59] increase
[49:01] although this is a positive powerful
[49:03] statement it is misappropriation of
[49:05] scripture
[49:06] because this is not job situation so
[49:09] what we are seeing here as well in the
[49:10] book of job
[49:11] is people can use scripture and words
[49:15] with the intention of it being right
[49:18] but with a lack of knowledge of what god
[49:20] is doing
[49:21] it actually becomes destructive this is
[49:24] not something easy to teach but this is
[49:26] the reality
[49:26] of the situation here all right so we're
[49:28] building a little bit i'm not going to
[49:29] be too long
[49:30] with you right
[49:35] now by the time we reach the to
[49:39] let's jump to job nine
[49:42] then job answered so this is job
[49:44] response and said i know
[49:46] it is so of a truth but how should man
[49:49] be
[49:49] just with god if he will
[49:53] contend with him he cannot answer him
[49:55] one of a thousand
[49:58] he is wise and hot and mighty in
[50:00] strength
[50:01] who had hardened himself against him and
[50:03] had prospered
[50:06] which removed the mountains and they
[50:08] know not
[50:09] which overturned them in his anger which
[50:12] shaken the earth out of a place
[50:14] and the pillars thereof tremble which
[50:17] commanded the sun and it rise it knot
[50:19] and seal it up the stars which alone
[50:22] spreaded out the heavens and treaded
[50:24] upon the waves of the sea which make it
[50:27] actual
[50:28] orion and pleiades and the chambers of
[50:30] the south
[50:31] which do it great things past finding
[50:33] out yeah and
[50:34] wonders without number no he goes by me
[50:37] and i see him not
[50:40] he pass it on also but i perceive him
[50:42] not so
[50:43] job is responding say listen i can't
[50:46] fight god
[50:47] when i look at what god is what he does
[50:51] and then but job does not beginning to
[50:53] see certain things it's
[50:55] which you say he goes by me and i see
[50:57] him not he pass it on also but i
[50:58] perceive him not
[51:00] below behold he take it away verse 12
[51:02] who can hinder him
[51:04] who shall say unto him what does thou
[51:08] so job is saying and and this part is
[51:10] right so
[51:11] what i find when you read in job is
[51:13] there are many things that are said
[51:15] that are correctly said but you see the
[51:18] emotion and the grief
[51:19] of job's condition coming out
[51:22] verse 13 if god will not withdraw his
[51:25] anger the proud helpers do stoop under
[51:27] him
[51:28] how much less shall i answer him and
[51:30] choose out of my words
[51:32] to reason with him whom
[51:35] though i were righteous yet would i not
[51:38] answer
[51:39] but i would make supplication to my
[51:41] judge
[51:42] if i had called and he had answered me
[51:44] yet would i not believe that he had
[51:46] happened
[51:47] unto my voice for he breaked me with a
[51:49] tempest
[51:51] listen to this verse here and multiply
[51:54] it
[51:54] my wounds without cause
[51:58] so what is very careful and i want us to
[52:01] catch this because most people don't
[52:02] take any time here
[52:04] job is starting to mix what is truth
[52:07] with his own personal perspective so
[52:09] he's accusing god of
[52:11] multiplying his wounds for no reason
[52:16] if it's one thing i want just to catch
[52:18] out of the teaching here
[52:19] is be very careful what you see
[52:24] in a trial in a situation
[52:27] in a conflict when you're going through
[52:29] a challenge
[52:31] when you don't understand what they're
[52:32] going through do not
[52:34] speak negative
[52:39] do not speak negative because what we
[52:42] see is jobs
[52:43] starting to defend himself but he's
[52:46] dropping certain things
[52:47] in his defense that is disturbing god
[52:52] anybody with me and we'll pick it up
[52:54] later on it's very subtle
[52:56] so if you don't spend any time and go
[52:58] through this to see okay
[52:59] what was he because how could god place
[53:01] a man as upright and perfect
[53:03] in job one one and
[53:06] his uprightness and his perfection is
[53:09] now being
[53:10] i want to be careful saying this being
[53:11] challenged through suffering
[53:13] in other words god was requiring from
[53:16] job a greater uprightness
[53:20] and a greater level of perfection in his
[53:22] life that could have
[53:23] only been arrived at true suffering i
[53:26] wonder if i catch this
[53:28] so when we talk about suffering as a
[53:30] believer
[53:31] god takes us through experiences
[53:34] to fine-tune things in us
[53:38] because job never had the opportunity to
[53:42] go through this kind of a test in fact
[53:44] job was so upright and perfect it took
[53:47] a great massive amount of
[53:50] trial intestines plus his friends
[53:53] accusing him
[53:54] for him to come to any point to begin to
[53:56] speak away he had never spoken in his
[53:58] whole life
[53:59] i wanted to catch this if i
[54:02] come and throw down your cup of water
[54:06] you wouldn't hold that against me it's a
[54:09] cup of water
[54:12] but if i come and break your your your
[54:14] your microwave
[54:16] if i said i feel a little kind of way
[54:18] but i said break my microwave you know i
[54:20] love him i know you know he has
[54:21] encouraged us and bible studying here
[54:22] but
[54:24] my microwaving uh and you know that
[54:26] place is closed where's my
[54:28] microwave so for the rest of this
[54:29] pandemic i don't know how
[54:31] he's gonna be food now if
[54:34] i dammit something more important so but
[54:36] isa come and mash up your fridge
[54:39] now your car call anything in the fridge
[54:43] the increase in pressure at what point i
[54:45] want i want you to bring it to like
[54:47] at what point would i have to match up
[54:49] your fridge and your microwave for you
[54:51] to say you know brother isaac really is
[54:52] something else you know
[54:56] now this is this is the teaching here
[54:58] with job
[55:00] god wants to push job to the limit
[55:06] to see at what point will the real job
[55:10] come out
[55:11] oh lord help us tonight in other words
[55:15] all of us under a little pressure we can
[55:18] handle ourselves in situations you know
[55:20] but if i keep tearing up the volume of
[55:23] your trials
[55:24] turning up the volume of your testing
[55:26] turn up the volume so
[55:28] at volume three you start to act up a
[55:30] little bit
[55:31] at volume four you're thinking about
[55:34] cursing
[55:36] at volume five you start to curse
[55:39] certain things
[55:40] by volume six your full-blown customer
[55:42] now you place by volume seven
[55:44] you reach a polling station by volume
[55:47] eight you're not you're not in church
[55:48] anymore
[55:49] by volume nine you don't want nothing to
[55:51] do with the gospel
[55:52] you you see the issue here
[55:55] so i want us to catch this now because a
[55:58] lot of us
[55:58] no but if i don't say the bride will be
[56:00] a haunted person you take groupon
[56:03] so there is also a promise
[56:06] of persecution and pressure so this
[56:08] teaching is to prepare us
[56:10] for all kind of situations that we have
[56:12] to deal with and handle it correctly
[56:16] this is to help us put into perspective
[56:20] the greatness of god for him achieving
[56:22] his purpose and we'll read some things
[56:25] in this book of job here so if i wanted
[56:27] to catch this lesson
[56:28] it is not as simple as job had and it
[56:31] was a test
[56:32] is what god was doing through the test
[56:35] is the deeper message of job which he
[56:37] was trying to figure out as well as his
[56:40] friends
[56:40] trying to put their finger because is it
[56:43] a secret sin
[56:44] or what is it
[56:51] let's go on so we we we we're moving on
[56:56] so by job 10 we we're walking through a
[56:59] little bit
[56:59] we're touching here just a little here
[57:01] by job 10 verse 1
[57:05] job is still speaking he is saying my
[57:08] soul is wary of my life
[57:13] i will leave my complaint upon myself
[57:16] i will speak in the bitterness of my
[57:19] soul i will say unto god do not condemn
[57:21] me
[57:23] show me wherefore thou contend this with
[57:26] me
[57:27] so job reach a point upon mercedes
[57:29] challenge god
[57:32] no the heat is there this is him
[57:35] defending so i wanted to see
[57:37] it's like a fireside chat three friends
[57:39] on job
[57:40] and job is trying to respond to these
[57:43] brothers who are trying to help
[57:44] they are accusing him but he is not
[57:47] directly
[57:48] only responding to what they are saying
[57:51] he certainly have issue with god as well
[57:53] huh
[57:54] i want this to understand this because
[57:56] the lesson of
[57:57] this is be very careful who you're
[58:00] trying to believe
[58:01] this blame thing sat in genesis sir
[58:04] adam says the woman they give me it is
[58:06] in our human nature
[58:08] once you increase pressure you blame
[58:10] somebody
[58:12] so here it is show me where for now
[58:14] content
[58:15] is with me
[58:20] in the amplified that that job 10 verse
[58:24] 2 says i will say to god listen listen
[58:26] amplified version here
[58:28] listen to job job i will say to god do
[58:30] not con
[58:31] condemn me and declare me guilty show me
[58:35] why you contend and argue and struggle
[58:37] with me you imagine telling that to god
[58:41] we read in the same bible right so
[58:44] you will see it by the time we get to
[58:46] elohu
[58:48] job was so confident in his uprightness
[58:51] and his being perfect that job developed
[58:54] a
[58:54] subtle sense of arrogance and pride that
[58:56] he didn't even know he had
[58:59] about his standing
[59:02] so job had a level of self-righteousness
[59:05] that he
[59:06] did not even know he had i wanted to get
[59:09] this
[59:10] it was not so this is not a man dealing
[59:13] with
[59:14] lust and fornication this is dealing
[59:16] with now
[59:17] your uprightness create a level of pride
[59:20] that is now sin
[59:22] oh come on now your testimony
[59:25] create a birth you say but lord wait now
[59:27] i want you to show me lord i want you to
[59:28] show me
[59:29] what my issue is
[59:33] listen to what job is saying listen this
[59:36] is powerful
[59:37] jose i will say to god this is he
[59:40] ignoring the brothers
[59:41] and he said in their hearing i would say
[59:44] to god
[59:45] do not condemn me i really really
[59:47] amplified and declare my
[59:49] be guilty show me why you contend and
[59:52] argue and struggle with me
[59:53] so he's accusing god now of contending
[59:56] and arguing and struggling with him so
[1:00:00] job
[1:00:00] in his whole conversation in his
[1:00:02] analysis of the situation
[1:00:04] he is now blaming god for his situation
[1:00:08] so you see why why
[1:00:11] chapter 42 repentance is required now
[1:00:14] and now we have to check ourselves and
[1:00:16] why it takes pressure
[1:00:18] to now show how we will respond even to
[1:00:26] god
[1:00:28] verse three i want to read it from the
[1:00:31] amplified because it says listen to me
[1:00:32] does it indeed seem right to you to
[1:00:35] oppress
[1:00:37] to despise and reject the work of your
[1:00:40] hands
[1:00:42] and to look at favor on the schemes of
[1:00:43] the wicked so job is
[1:00:45] accusing god does it indeed seem
[1:00:49] right to you lord to oppress to despise
[1:00:51] and to reject
[1:00:52] the work of your hands i am the work of
[1:00:54] your hands
[1:00:57] now what i realize here now it is it is
[1:01:01] a subtle you know we did not teaching on
[1:01:03] on the spirit of entitlement because of
[1:01:05] entitlement
[1:01:07] it is as if job had reached a point
[1:01:09] where he felt that his standing
[1:01:12] didn't warrant a certain level of
[1:01:14] pressure
[1:01:16] oh come on now the way job is now
[1:01:19] dealing with his situation comes across
[1:01:22] as if job felt listen i've served you so
[1:01:25] well
[1:01:26] how could you oppress and reject
[1:01:30] the work of your hands in other words
[1:01:33] i don't think this punishment should be
[1:01:35] coming to me
[1:01:36] and job goes on and to look with favor
[1:01:39] on these schemes of the wicked
[1:01:41] so job is saying to god you're coming at
[1:01:44] me
[1:01:44] and you're looking at favor with fear by
[1:01:46] these schemes that you're awakened
[1:01:47] in other words why your body me i'm not
[1:01:50] going after the wicked
[1:01:55] verse four do you have the eyes of flesh
[1:01:59] do you see as a man sees are your days
[1:02:02] as the days of immortal
[1:02:04] are your years as a man's years do you
[1:02:07] seek my guilt and search for my
[1:02:09] sin listen to verse seven
[1:02:13] although you know that i am not guilty
[1:02:15] or wicked
[1:02:18] so you see now god see my written i need
[1:02:20] to teach job job
[1:02:21] show me a little lesson because job is
[1:02:25] willing to tell the lord
[1:02:27] in his uprightness and his perfection
[1:02:29] that you know i'm not guilty or wicked
[1:02:36] now this is where i say it's very
[1:02:37] interesting and this is why
[1:02:39] knowingly would mis apply to be
[1:02:42] dangerous
[1:02:44] verse 8 your hands have formed and made
[1:02:46] me all together
[1:02:48] that's a powerful that is the truth we
[1:02:50] we everybody can say that
[1:02:52] your hands lord
[1:02:56] have formed and made me all together
[1:02:58] would you turn around and destroy me i'm
[1:03:00] reading any amplified
[1:03:04] so job is saying lord if you make me how
[1:03:06] do you get to wrong and destroy me
[1:03:10] verse nine remember now that you have
[1:03:12] made me as clay
[1:03:13] so will you turn me into dust again
[1:03:18] so job is is is speaking stuff
[1:03:21] through scripture but at the end of the
[1:03:24] day
[1:03:25] he is actually having an issue with
[1:03:27] god's administration
[1:03:31] anybody with me i know most people never
[1:03:35] never hear this one before but i want
[1:03:36] you to understand
[1:03:38] because these situations arrive in all
[1:03:41] of our lives you know
[1:03:43] i can't understand why god do that i do
[1:03:45] understand why god
[1:03:46] allowed that i don't understand how he
[1:03:48] could preach or he could do this or god
[1:03:50] allowed that to raise that
[1:03:51] allowed that to fall and god made me and
[1:03:54] and god put me in
[1:03:55] and then
[1:03:58] listen to job this is
[1:04:01] i'm trying to keep it short but there's
[1:04:04] some meeting here boy
[1:04:06] listen to jobs job is like a job is
[1:04:08] expressing
[1:04:10] things that some of us may feel and
[1:04:12] think and never even see
[1:04:16] job said in verse 10 and job 10 10 are
[1:04:19] really amplified
[1:04:20] he said you have not poured me out like
[1:04:23] milk
[1:04:24] and curdled me like cheese you know have
[1:04:26] you not poured me out like milk and curd
[1:04:28] of me like geez
[1:04:30] you have clothed me with skin and flesh
[1:04:33] and knit me together with bones and
[1:04:34] sinews
[1:04:35] you have granted me life and loving
[1:04:38] kindness
[1:04:40] and your providence divine care
[1:04:42] supervision
[1:04:43] has preserved my spirit so job is mixing
[1:04:47] some positive things with his issues and
[1:04:49] his questions
[1:04:50] and his questioning of god yet
[1:04:54] verse 13 these present evils
[1:04:57] i'm really amplified you have hidden in
[1:05:00] your heart
[1:05:02] since my creation in other words job
[1:05:05] saying
[1:05:06] all the blessings you give me what are
[1:05:08] going to right now
[1:05:09] since i'm born you have this in your
[1:05:11] heart to do this to me
[1:05:17] listen it goes on he said i know that
[1:05:20] this was within you
[1:05:21] in your purpose and your thought so job
[1:05:23] is acknowledging
[1:05:24] that the activity is going through is
[1:05:28] because god planned it to be so so it is
[1:05:30] not as if job is ignorant this is why he
[1:05:32] can speak his wife and say you speak
[1:05:34] like
[1:05:34] a spiritually lacking spiritual
[1:05:38] knowledge of the defining plan of god
[1:05:40] job is not
[1:05:41] ignorant that is god operating it makes
[1:05:43] it clear here he is asking god why you
[1:05:46] are
[1:05:46] operating so you anybody catching this
[1:05:50] i wanted to see and look to the lens of
[1:05:53] what we have been through in our lives
[1:05:55] or what will be going to right now
[1:05:58] because job is expressing what most of
[1:06:00] us feel
[1:06:02] boy why boy why boy why
[1:06:05] why why the pressure
[1:06:09] why it can't be easier
[1:06:12] oh gosh if there's not one thing it's
[1:06:14] our next thing everyone next thing is
[1:06:15] the next thing on top of the next thing
[1:06:17] that he's diced job and job able
[1:06:20] because of his spiritual knowledge and
[1:06:22] his work to say but lord
[1:06:24] i want to read it again i like all that
[1:06:26] song you
[1:06:27] have you not poured me out like milk and
[1:06:29] curd of me like cheese
[1:06:31] clued me with skin and flesh knit me
[1:06:33] together with bones and sinews
[1:06:35] granted me life and loving kindness and
[1:06:38] your providence i really amplified
[1:06:39] divine care supervision has preserved my
[1:06:42] spirit he put it all upon god
[1:06:46] yet in verse 13
[1:06:49] these present evils you have hidden in
[1:06:52] your heart since my creation
[1:06:54] i know that this was within you in your
[1:06:57] purpose and thought
[1:07:02] listen to verse 14 and it's important
[1:07:05] friends
[1:07:06] i'm moving between the king james and
[1:07:07] the amplified and if you're studying
[1:07:08] you're doing baptism it's really great
[1:07:10] to see the amplifier verse 40 said if i
[1:07:13] sin
[1:07:14] then you will take note and observe me
[1:07:16] so he knows i'm going to tell god but
[1:07:18] like is that some things you're really
[1:07:19] watching
[1:07:21] you're taking notes
[1:07:24] and you would not acquit me of my guilt
[1:07:27] if i am wicked
[1:07:29] water me and if i am righteous i dare
[1:07:32] not lift my head
[1:07:38] verse 16 should i lift my head up you
[1:07:41] would hunt me like a lion
[1:07:43] and again you would show your marvelous
[1:07:45] power against me
[1:07:50] some of this they'll have to do on their
[1:07:51] own because i want to keep on moving
[1:07:52] we're only in
[1:07:53] chapter 10 and i want to i want to kind
[1:07:55] of jump a little bit right
[1:07:58] so bear in mind all of this that job is
[1:08:01] expressing
[1:08:03] in his response to these brothers and
[1:08:05] his analysis of his current predicament
[1:08:08] and his belief his opinion his
[1:08:11] understanding
[1:08:12] his assumptions of what is going on
[1:08:14] these brothers are hearing it
[1:08:17] and they are responding to him so so far
[1:08:19] response
[1:08:21] then answered zofa the number tight
[1:08:25] shall not the multitude of words we
[1:08:27] answered in other words should we not
[1:08:29] respond to all them thing you're saying
[1:08:31] only you're talking talking talking
[1:08:33] talking and
[1:08:34] should a man full of talk be justified
[1:08:38] so thy lies make men hold their peace
[1:08:42] so these brothers saying you're talking
[1:08:43] too positive
[1:08:46] but at the end of the day there are
[1:08:48] certain things in what job is saying
[1:08:50] that they would have issue it
[1:08:51] and you could see how it will almost
[1:08:53] become a doctrinal debate
[1:08:56] because these brothers should be
[1:08:58] spiritually enough to reason
[1:09:00] he thinks that job might be saying that
[1:09:03] it's his emotion and his pain and his
[1:09:06] and his and his stress getting them to
[1:09:08] say these things
[1:09:10] verse 4 11 was for for dao has said my
[1:09:15] doctrine is pure
[1:09:16] and i am clean and dying eyes but all
[1:09:19] that god would speak and open his lips
[1:09:22] against thee
[1:09:24] that he would surely the secrets of
[1:09:26] wisdom
[1:09:27] that they are double to that which is no
[1:09:31] therefore and we read this last week
[1:09:33] that god exacted of the
[1:09:35] less than that iniquity deserve it so
[1:09:38] these brothers
[1:09:39] not discerning the reality they don't
[1:09:41] believe what joe believes
[1:09:44] job is acknowledging that god has
[1:09:45] something to do with it they are saying
[1:09:47] is not god do anything like that
[1:09:48] god acting yes but it's not because he's
[1:09:50] trying to do something else
[1:09:51] it's because of your sin and they're
[1:09:54] going after that road
[1:09:56] anybody with me right let's just go a
[1:09:59] little further i'm trying to close out
[1:10:00] here and are trying to
[1:10:06] all right so let me just skip now
[1:10:11] i read that last week i'm going to skip
[1:10:14] that
[1:10:16] skip that okay
[1:10:20] sorry i have three different things i'm
[1:10:22] reading from here okay
[1:10:31] i want to jump to job 16. so this is
[1:10:35] another of job's responses now so this
[1:10:37] is job's response to elle versus
[1:10:39] second you know presentation
[1:10:44] so job is saying and i want to read out
[1:10:46] of the amplified
[1:10:48] then job answered and said i have heard
[1:10:51] many such things
[1:10:52] worrisome and miserable comforters are
[1:10:55] you all
[1:10:57] is there no end to your futile words of
[1:10:59] wind
[1:11:01] or what plagues you so much that you so
[1:11:04] boldly answer me like this
[1:11:07] i also could speak like you if you were
[1:11:11] in my place
[1:11:12] i could compose and join words together
[1:11:15] against you and shake my head at you
[1:11:17] but instead i could encourage i could
[1:11:20] strengthen and encourage you
[1:11:21] with the words of my mouth so job is
[1:11:24] saying all
[1:11:25] accusing me all you're pressuring me now
[1:11:27] bear in mind friends
[1:11:29] that these three friends are also
[1:11:32] part of god's willing what this doesn't
[1:11:34] understand is it
[1:11:36] so god is allowing this as part of job's
[1:11:38] whole experience
[1:11:41] because if these brothers hadn't said
[1:11:44] what they said about job's situation
[1:11:46] the responsive and and i want you to
[1:11:48] take care of yourself job is the one
[1:11:49] under the examination here
[1:11:53] this is the deeper lesson because i
[1:11:56] don't want to come across
[1:11:57] although these brothers were dealt with
[1:11:59] the red exam here in job is job
[1:12:02] we know these brothers are off but the
[1:12:04] real exam don't let don't let miss the
[1:12:06] picture
[1:12:07] i don't want you to leave here looking
[1:12:08] for your three friends who telling you
[1:12:10] the wrong thing
[1:12:12] that is not the objective the objectives
[1:12:15] are defined
[1:12:16] i suspect you you are elie farzino you
[1:12:19] are you like a builder i don't know
[1:12:20] i don't know when people said they tag
[1:12:22] all the builders in the elephants in the
[1:12:23] zoo first in their life that is not the
[1:12:25] objective of this teaching
[1:12:26] i want you to catch that job is the one
[1:12:28] on the testing block
[1:12:31] and the test was a progressive test from
[1:12:33] his wealth
[1:12:34] from his family from his health and now
[1:12:37] to dealing with the issues because
[1:12:39] listen
[1:12:39] life and death is in the power of the
[1:12:41] tongue if there was ever
[1:12:43] a message on you could say the right
[1:12:45] thing
[1:12:46] and you should say the right thing and
[1:12:48] be careful what you see
[1:12:49] is the book of job because from
[1:12:53] chapter 2 all the way to chapter
[1:12:56] 31 is all about
[1:12:59] seeing things and what is said and god
[1:13:03] judged based on the activities between
[1:13:06] chapter
[1:13:06] 3 and chapter 31.
[1:13:11] anybody with me tonight
[1:13:16] we still in job 16 verse 6.
[1:13:20] if i speak to you my miserable
[1:13:22] comforters
[1:13:24] my pain is not relieved and if i refrain
[1:13:28] from speaking
[1:13:29] what pain or anguish leaves me
[1:13:32] listen to job in verse seven but now god
[1:13:36] has exhausted me
[1:13:38] that is he amplified in seven in the
[1:13:41] kingdom but now he has made me
[1:13:43] weary he's talking about the lord
[1:13:47] so job reached a point where he hit say
[1:13:49] listen to the lord the lord has tied me
[1:13:52] listen to verse seven it goes on
[1:13:56] king james said dawaz made desolate all
[1:13:58] my company
[1:13:59] in verse 17 amplified i said oh lord you
[1:14:02] oh lord have destroyed all my family and
[1:14:04] my household
[1:14:08] verse eight you have taken a firm hole
[1:14:10] on me and have shoveled me up
[1:14:12] it has become a witness against me
[1:14:16] and my leanness and infirmity rises up
[1:14:19] as
[1:14:19] evidence against me
[1:14:22] it testifies to my face about my guilt
[1:14:26] his wrath has torn me and hunted me down
[1:14:29] he has gnashed at me with his teeth
[1:14:33] my adversary sharpens his gaze and
[1:14:35] glares
[1:14:36] with piercing eyes at me
[1:14:39] so job is now processing his experience
[1:14:43] most people have not read and looked at
[1:14:46] what transpired in the hardship now
[1:14:48] listen i don't want you to even judge
[1:14:50] joven
[1:14:52] because you don't know how you will
[1:14:54] handle your sheep
[1:14:57] we are fortunate to be able to get
[1:14:59] insight into jobs our sheep
[1:15:01] but all of us have our ash heap to go
[1:15:04] through
[1:15:05] and we are being cautioned by the word
[1:15:07] with how
[1:15:08] you manage your personal predetermined
[1:15:12] assigned ash heap that god will put you
[1:15:15] to sit down
[1:15:15] on for your character to be developed
[1:15:19] anybody with me listen you're not
[1:15:22] missing it you're not avoiding it it
[1:15:23] come in you know
[1:15:25] if you're not in it already it come in
[1:15:27] you know
[1:15:29] because god wants this thing like you
[1:15:31] know buy me gold tried any fire
[1:15:36] so i want to highlight it is easy to
[1:15:39] speak nobody job
[1:15:40] who had and lost and got doubled for his
[1:15:42] trouble that is wonderful
[1:15:45] but i want to focus deeper or above the
[1:15:48] double for his trouble
[1:15:49] and focus on the change in the man
[1:15:55] it is easy everybody want to double for
[1:15:57] each other partner
[1:16:00] so i had one house now i have two house
[1:16:02] i had one can i have two cars
[1:16:04] easy that is an easy teaching what i
[1:16:07] want to deal with
[1:16:08] is the change in the man from
[1:16:12] how he spoke his issues in his life
[1:16:16] because at the end of the day the job 42
[1:16:19] man was a different man
[1:16:21] he couldn't talk the same way because
[1:16:24] this experience
[1:16:25] took him to his core you know what it is
[1:16:28] when a man has no money
[1:16:30] no family and you're sick and you feel
[1:16:33] like you're dying there
[1:16:34] and you begin to speak and you begin to
[1:16:37] go to your struggle this is
[1:16:38] this is the real pain of life let's move
[1:16:40] on
[1:16:42] i'm running all the time i can't believe
[1:16:43] i'm running all the time this will be a
[1:16:44] short teaching tonight
[1:16:47] so i want to touch now verse uh job 17.
[1:16:50] he's still speaking here
[1:16:55] my breath is corrupt my days are extinct
[1:16:57] the graves are ready for me
[1:17:00] in the amplified my spirit is broken my
[1:17:02] days are extinguished the grave is ready
[1:17:05] for me
[1:17:07] this is a man who has reached a point
[1:17:09] where he's ready to give up you know
[1:17:14] he is ready to truly toe well as it will
[1:17:17] and it goes on by verse 15 of that same
[1:17:21] chapter 17 you see where
[1:17:23] now is my hope
[1:17:26] i don't want to highlight
[1:17:31] no bear in mind these brothers
[1:17:34] are being inspired to see things in
[1:17:37] their mind to help
[1:17:38] some of it is some level of comfort poor
[1:17:42] comfort joke cause it or or weak comfort
[1:17:44] but at the end of the day they are also
[1:17:46] challenging him
[1:17:51] bill that in job 18 then
[1:17:54] answered build that issue white and said
[1:17:56] how long will it be air you
[1:17:58] make an end of words mark and afterwards
[1:18:01] we will speak
[1:18:02] in other words in the amplified how long
[1:18:04] will you hunt for words and continue
[1:18:06] these speeches
[1:18:07] do some clear thinking and show
[1:18:09] understanding and then we can talk
[1:18:13] so then fellas challenge is it's almost
[1:18:14] like a trial going on in them
[1:18:16] there's a contest going on i know so i
[1:18:18] wonder i want to skip there
[1:18:20] because job 19 is powerful
[1:18:24] jobs reply job 19 verse 1.
[1:18:27] then job answered and said how long will
[1:18:28] you vex my soul
[1:18:30] and break me in pieces with words these
[1:18:33] 10 times you have reproached me
[1:18:36] you have you are not ashamed that you
[1:18:38] make yourself strange to me
[1:18:40] in other words you wanted to seem to
[1:18:41] wrong me and had any hearts against me
[1:18:44] so now he's accusing his friends of of
[1:18:46] of being haters then right
[1:18:48] and be it indeed that i have heard my
[1:18:51] error
[1:18:52] remain with myself
[1:18:55] in other words in the amplified if it
[1:18:57] were true that i have heard
[1:18:59] my error would remain with me and i
[1:19:01] would be conscious of it
[1:19:05] all right no again i want you to see the
[1:19:08] danger in job now mixing and matching
[1:19:11] his knowledge of god and god's grace and
[1:19:13] god blessing god's power
[1:19:14] with his own perception of god by the
[1:19:17] time we reach
[1:19:18] to job 19 verse 6 and john 19 is
[1:19:21] interesting we'll see why
[1:19:22] but john 19 6 says know that god had
[1:19:25] overthrown me
[1:19:26] and had compassed me with his net so job
[1:19:29] is saying
[1:19:30] know then that god has wronged me in the
[1:19:32] amplified and overthrown me
[1:19:34] and has closed as net around me
[1:19:37] behold i cry out wrong but i'm not hood
[1:19:40] so
[1:19:40] job is basically saying in the reference
[1:19:43] says behold i cry out violence and i'm
[1:19:44] not good
[1:19:45] i shot for help but there's no justice
[1:19:48] he has walked up my way so that i cannot
[1:19:50] pass
[1:19:51] and he has set darkness upon my parts he
[1:19:54] has stripped me of my honor
[1:19:56] and removed the crown from my head
[1:19:59] he breaks me down on every side and i am
[1:20:02] gone he has uprooted my hope like a tree
[1:20:05] he has also kindled his rat like a fire
[1:20:08] against me
[1:20:09] and he considers and count me as one of
[1:20:11] his adversaries
[1:20:14] so job reached a critical point by job
[1:20:16] 19
[1:20:17] saying listen it's as if god and i are
[1:20:20] our enemies
[1:20:23] you you see this here you see how
[1:20:26] pressure can make people
[1:20:28] say and even believe things that are not
[1:20:30] true
[1:20:31] because we know the top of the story we
[1:20:33] know what god really doing
[1:20:35] but look at the man in his situation oh
[1:20:38] we could think but had to be
[1:20:39] not i have been right all this time it
[1:20:41] had to be i don't know what it is but
[1:20:42] god do something to me i really don't
[1:20:44] know what it is go ahead is my enemy
[1:20:48] verse 13 i'm reading from the amplifier
[1:20:50] and you can you could you could check it
[1:20:52] he has put my brothers far from me and
[1:20:54] my acquaintances are completely
[1:20:56] strange from me my relatives have
[1:21:00] failed me this is everywhere and my
[1:21:03] intimate friends have forgotten me
[1:21:06] those who live temporarily in my house
[1:21:08] and my maids
[1:21:09] consider me a stranger i am a foreigner
[1:21:13] in their sight
[1:21:14] i call to my servant but he doesn't
[1:21:17] answer
[1:21:18] you see he is he drove jerry's a point
[1:21:20] where he said he called him how come
[1:21:22] he's servant he even come
[1:21:25] i have to employ him with words in other
[1:21:27] words when i give command to my servant
[1:21:30] here come after use words to get myself
[1:21:32] until respond when servant do everyone
[1:21:33] to come
[1:21:34] you see job how god stripped and
[1:21:36] stripped and stripped
[1:21:38] so that what remains is just what god
[1:21:40] wants to shape and mold
[1:21:42] verse 18 even the young children despise
[1:21:46] me
[1:21:46] when i get up they speak against me now
[1:21:48] we talk about job
[1:21:50] but this is the real story this is what
[1:21:52] a man going through you know
[1:21:54] this is not well you know job isn't a
[1:21:55] sheep and god take it away and go
[1:21:56] restore him
[1:21:58] job is telling you that listen when i
[1:22:01] get up these children they speak against
[1:22:03] me
[1:22:03] all the men of my counsel hate me those
[1:22:06] i love have turned against me
[1:22:08] my bone clings to my skin and to my
[1:22:10] flesh
[1:22:12] i have escaped death by the skin of my
[1:22:14] teeth
[1:22:15] i'm reading from the amplified here have
[1:22:17] pity on me have pity on me or you my
[1:22:20] friends
[1:22:21] for the hand of god has touched me why
[1:22:24] listen to this statement do you
[1:22:26] persecute me as god does
[1:22:30] so job reach a point he's actually
[1:22:32] convinced that god is persecuting him
[1:22:35] he's not seeking as god trying to shape
[1:22:37] him mold him
[1:22:39] bring character build character you see
[1:22:41] why perspective is important
[1:22:43] and why job had to repent
[1:22:47] these statements are the cause for job
[1:22:50] repentance in chapter 42.
[1:22:56] and then by the time we reach and this
[1:22:57] is the same chapter
[1:22:59] from verse 23 oh that my words were not
[1:23:02] written
[1:23:03] all that they were printed in a book
[1:23:05] that they were graven with an
[1:23:07] iron pen and lead in the rock forever
[1:23:11] so job this is the the the
[1:23:14] the mix of the man now after you say all
[1:23:17] of that
[1:23:18] he said for i know that my redeemer
[1:23:20] lived
[1:23:22] he is still at war in himself for i know
[1:23:26] that my redeemer lived and that he shall
[1:23:27] stand
[1:23:28] at the latter day upon the earth and
[1:23:31] though
[1:23:31] after my skin worms destroyed his body
[1:23:34] yet in my flesh
[1:23:35] shall i see god whom i shall see for
[1:23:38] myself
[1:23:39] can the church say amen so let's try to
[1:23:42] try to kind of bring this and you can
[1:23:43] see how i know reach 19 out of 42. i
[1:23:45] i really get anywhere but i want to kind
[1:23:48] of jump a little bit because we're kind
[1:23:49] of talking
[1:23:50] about job and his friends and his
[1:23:51] response and
[1:23:54] at the end of this at around job this is
[1:23:56] job let's go to job
[1:23:57] job 26 quickly by the time we reached
[1:24:01] job 26
[1:24:03] this is like like i would have said i
[1:24:06] want to be
[1:24:06] the the three brothers uh
[1:24:10] elephant spoke three times job would
[1:24:13] have responded each time
[1:24:14] bill that spoke three times job
[1:24:16] responded each time
[1:24:18] well zofa these brothers when you spend
[1:24:21] another time
[1:24:21] each time they spoke was less and less
[1:24:23] until that like really wasn't even
[1:24:24] saying anything
[1:24:25] afterwards i felt like i just wrote the
[1:24:27] argument because they recognized there
[1:24:28] wasn't a nowhere with you
[1:24:29] nothing they told job was shaken job job
[1:24:33] was not accepting
[1:24:34] that it was something in his past it was
[1:24:36] nothing and he was right
[1:24:37] it wasn't an issue of secret sinner that
[1:24:40] was not the issue
[1:24:41] it was the issue of something in his
[1:24:42] past the sin that job had to be
[1:24:45] repenting oh was what he was committing
[1:24:46] any present you know
[1:24:51] that's that that's that's that's that's
[1:24:53] that's huge right there
[1:24:54] the issue with job and his sin because
[1:24:57] what caused this child was not sin
[1:25:00] it was god approval it was god saying
[1:25:02] have you considered myself on job
[1:25:04] but job in his response to the situation
[1:25:08] for the first time quote it is almost
[1:25:10] his testimony
[1:25:11] his responses was creating a situation
[1:25:13] that god said well no i have you where i
[1:25:15] want you
[1:25:16] because now i can root this out of you
[1:25:18] anybody with me
[1:25:19] so for five it's almost like you know in
[1:25:22] a court case
[1:25:23] you take the stand then you take the
[1:25:24] stand and take this time so
[1:25:26] so here it is from let me get my notes
[1:25:30] it's a lot of voices here to back then
[1:25:32] whatever you have to forgive me so
[1:25:33] from from job 26 to 31 which is
[1:25:36] 26 27 28 29
[1:25:40] 30 31 so 26 27 20 29 31. five
[1:25:45] chapters is job uninterrupted his
[1:25:49] closing arguments
[1:25:50] so to speak it's the last his last his
[1:25:53] is
[1:25:54] where he poured out everything he wanted
[1:25:55] to see against them three brothers who
[1:25:58] spoke
[1:25:58] and we don't hear from them brothers
[1:26:00] anymore
[1:26:01] every single time these brothers spoke
[1:26:04] he rebutted them
[1:26:05] he had a response with them he argued
[1:26:07] with them and then by the time
[1:26:09] we get to chapter 32
[1:26:13] is the entrance of elohu so let's just
[1:26:15] go to elohu i promise to get to this
[1:26:16] last week
[1:26:17] and we're going to try to kind of wrap
[1:26:18] up with with ella who
[1:26:21] ella who steps into the picture in job
[1:26:23] 32
[1:26:25] seemingly coming out of nowhere and
[1:26:27] brother branham typed him as a type of
[1:26:28] christ
[1:26:30] so in the king james they would actually
[1:26:33] call it elohu's
[1:26:35] intrusion meaning he just steps into the
[1:26:37] picture
[1:26:38] all right so reading job 32 verse one
[1:26:42] yeah you have some time we need a few
[1:26:44] more minutes just to kind of
[1:26:45] kind of pull this thing together right
[1:26:48] so these three men cease to answer job
[1:26:50] so
[1:26:51] they give up they say listen we we ain't
[1:26:54] talking no more we're done
[1:26:55] all right so they stopped talking right
[1:26:58] and now it creates this window for this
[1:27:01] fourth character
[1:27:03] almost like the fourth man in the fire
[1:27:04] this is this is the fourth entrant
[1:27:06] all right there's nothing to really
[1:27:08] suggest that he had no big relationship
[1:27:10] to job like the tree
[1:27:11] so look at the approach so these three
[1:27:13] men ceased to answer job
[1:27:14] because he was righteous in his own eyes
[1:27:17] right so job was writing in their own
[1:27:19] eyes he had a legitimate reason to be
[1:27:21] righteous and he also failed to see the
[1:27:23] current issues
[1:27:24] then was kind of the wrath of elohu
[1:27:28] the son of barachel the buzaite of the
[1:27:30] kindred of
[1:27:31] ram against job was his wrath kindled
[1:27:34] because he
[1:27:35] justified himself rather than god
[1:27:39] in other words he justified his
[1:27:41] situation instead of justifying god in
[1:27:43] other words
[1:27:44] he take the right and putting god in me
[1:27:46] wrong
[1:27:48] and we read the examples of the verses
[1:27:50] where he talked about god being his
[1:27:51] enemy
[1:27:52] and he uses these different references
[1:27:54] challenging god
[1:27:55] also elohu listen also against his three
[1:27:59] friends was his rat kindle so elohu is
[1:28:01] upset with job
[1:28:02] and he's accepted the three men
[1:28:06] because they had found no answer and yet
[1:28:09] had condemned the job
[1:28:12] so he had with the three men who they
[1:28:14] had no answer but yet they're coming
[1:28:15] against job
[1:28:17] now elohu had waited until job had
[1:28:19] spoken we talked about the last
[1:28:21] five chapters job spoke because they
[1:28:23] were
[1:28:24] elder than he so elohim is coming now as
[1:28:26] a young man
[1:28:28] when elohim saw that there was no answer
[1:28:30] in the mouth
[1:28:31] of these three men then his wrath was
[1:28:33] kindled in other words
[1:28:34] if ominous of elohu was hoping that it
[1:28:36] would come to a right answer
[1:28:38] a right statement to help joe get back
[1:28:40] on track
[1:28:42] verse six and ella who the son of barack
[1:28:43] child the buddha answered and said
[1:28:45] i am young and you are very old
[1:28:48] wherefore i was afraid
[1:28:50] and does not show you my opinion in
[1:28:52] other words i didn't know if i could
[1:28:53] speak i didn't want to get into the
[1:28:55] conversation
[1:28:56] i said days should speak in other words
[1:28:59] let let age speak let wisdom speak let
[1:29:02] me let the elders speak
[1:29:03] dears should speak people who have days
[1:29:05] of youth right
[1:29:06] and multitude of years should teach
[1:29:08] wisdom in other words i'm the young man
[1:29:10] here
[1:29:11] i heard only talking i assume that the
[1:29:14] elders here
[1:29:15] should have some answer and saw joke out
[1:29:17] job yourself i don't know what's going
[1:29:18] on
[1:29:20] but there is a spirit in a man there is
[1:29:22] a there is a spirit in man
[1:29:24] and the inspiration of you almighty
[1:29:26] given him understanding so
[1:29:28] so elohu is saying
[1:29:32] i don't have the age i'm not an elder
[1:29:35] like holy
[1:29:36] but there is a spirit in man and the
[1:29:38] inspiration of you almighty
[1:29:40] giving him understanding great men are
[1:29:43] not always wise
[1:29:44] we're going to some night teaching here
[1:29:46] neither do the age
[1:29:48] understand judgment so you see i'm
[1:29:50] sitting down here and i expect the age
[1:29:52] and
[1:29:52] the old people to give good advice here
[1:29:54] but i realized that that that this is
[1:29:56] not always the case
[1:29:58] therefore i said hearken to me i also
[1:30:00] will show my opinion
[1:30:02] so in one sweeping introduction
[1:30:05] who is saying age not always right
[1:30:08] there's something called inspiration
[1:30:09] and i'm gonna quickly speak under
[1:30:12] inspiration
[1:30:13] behold i waited for your words i give
[1:30:16] heir to your reasons
[1:30:18] while you search out what to say ye i
[1:30:20] attended unto you meaning
[1:30:22] why are you trying to find you want to
[1:30:23] look at paying attention and behold
[1:30:25] there was
[1:30:26] none of you that convinced job or that
[1:30:28] answered his words
[1:30:29] meaning job had questions only i helped
[1:30:32] him and what all you see oh they are
[1:30:33] giving him answers
[1:30:35] or you're wasting time less you should
[1:30:37] say we have found out wisdom god trusted
[1:30:39] him down
[1:30:40] not man so elohim settle it with this
[1:30:42] operative he said god
[1:30:44] is who did that not man now he have not
[1:30:47] directed his words against me
[1:30:50] neither will i answer him with your
[1:30:52] speeches in other words he's saying
[1:30:54] i am bringing a different perspective to
[1:30:56] the situation
[1:30:57] all right i'm trying to close out here
[1:30:59] you have to forgive me
[1:31:00] all right so and here it is i want to go
[1:31:03] to
[1:31:04] job 33 verse 8.
[1:31:10] and here it is why i made a statement
[1:31:13] and ello who says it
[1:31:14] the issue with job so so so so elohim
[1:31:17] makes clear that the issue with job
[1:31:19] is is god but job's sin he put his thing
[1:31:24] on one terminate in john 23 verse 8 he
[1:31:26] say
[1:31:26] surely thou has spoken
[1:31:30] in my hearing so he's saying you said
[1:31:33] these things and i heard you say it
[1:31:34] you said it for me to hear it so he
[1:31:36] going straight to the heart of the issue
[1:31:38] with job here now
[1:31:40] surely that was spoken in my hearing and
[1:31:43] i have heard the
[1:31:44] voice of thy word saying i am clean
[1:31:46] without transgression
[1:31:47] like what was saying right i am innocent
[1:31:51] and neither is the iniquity in me behold
[1:31:54] he find it occasions against me
[1:31:56] so he is quoting what job was saying all
[1:31:58] along he counted me for his enemy you
[1:32:00] remember we read those words
[1:32:01] we took it out my readers would write he
[1:32:03] put in my feet in the stocks he market
[1:32:05] all my parts he mentioned he's taking
[1:32:07] notes on his sins and
[1:32:08] all these things right verse 12 behold
[1:32:12] in this thou art not just in other words
[1:32:15] you will not
[1:32:15] write job in making those statements i
[1:32:19] will answer thee
[1:32:20] that god is greater than man why
[1:32:23] does thou strive against him so elohu is
[1:32:26] calling out job
[1:32:28] both on the statements he made and his
[1:32:31] belief that he could fight god
[1:32:34] why does thou strive against him
[1:32:37] for he giveth not account of any of his
[1:32:40] matters oh that is powerful eh
[1:32:45] in other words he does not answer you
[1:32:47] with his doings he's not held to your
[1:32:49] standard
[1:32:50] he's not required to explain himself
[1:32:52] anybody with me we're touching this last
[1:32:54] week
[1:32:54] right for god speak it once
[1:32:58] year twice yet man perceive it it not
[1:33:02] this here is i'm trying to close out
[1:33:03] this is powerful in other words
[1:33:06] god speaks he speaks one way he speaks
[1:33:09] another way
[1:33:10] but man don't even perceive when god is
[1:33:12] speaking so elohim is saying god is
[1:33:14] speaking on this matter this whole
[1:33:15] situation is god speaking
[1:33:16] and an elder who right here is
[1:33:18] explaining the whole situation all right
[1:33:23] in a dream in a vision of the night
[1:33:27] when deep sleep fallen upon man in
[1:33:30] slumbering
[1:33:31] upon the bed then he opened the ears of
[1:33:35] man and sealed their instruction
[1:33:37] so elohim is saying god speaks in
[1:33:39] different ways
[1:33:40] he could speak when you're in your sleep
[1:33:43] he could speak
[1:33:44] in the night he could speak in dreams
[1:33:48] and seal at his instructions so god
[1:33:50] could minister in any way he wants to
[1:33:52] all right listen and this is the
[1:33:56] objective
[1:33:56] that he may withdraw man from his
[1:33:59] purpose
[1:33:59] this is not his as in god's purpose
[1:34:03] man from his own man's purpose and high
[1:34:06] pride from man so right here
[1:34:10] elohu went after this sin of pride which
[1:34:13] we know the sin of pride was the first
[1:34:15] great sin right
[1:34:16] that's the sin that lucifer lifted up
[1:34:18] himself and said i will i will i will i
[1:34:19] will right
[1:34:20] so he is in his watching job
[1:34:24] he seeing joe became uh proud of his
[1:34:27] uprightness
[1:34:28] proud of his testimony proud that nobody
[1:34:30] could put a thing on him
[1:34:32] proud that that he's a certain kind of
[1:34:34] man and his pride created a level of
[1:34:36] entitlement
[1:34:37] because he he he raises entitlement god
[1:34:39] do this to me
[1:34:40] so based on how you treated with me
[1:34:42] before how can you do this thing to me
[1:34:44] now
[1:34:46] high priest man he keeping back his soul
[1:34:48] from the pit
[1:34:49] and his life from perishing by the sword
[1:34:52] and listen to verse 19.
[1:34:54] and this really most people don't read
[1:34:56] this but this is powerful listen
[1:34:57] he chasing it also with pain upon his
[1:35:00] bed
[1:35:01] in other words god put you on a bed of
[1:35:04] sickness for a purpose
[1:35:06] it's written right here he is chastened
[1:35:09] also with pain upon his bed
[1:35:10] and the multitude of his bones with
[1:35:13] strong pain
[1:35:16] so that his life abhorred bread and his
[1:35:18] soul deity meat
[1:35:20] his flesh is consumed the way that it
[1:35:22] cannot be seen
[1:35:23] and his bones that were not seen stick
[1:35:25] out yeah
[1:35:27] his soul draw it near onto the grave
[1:35:30] and his life to the destroyers
[1:35:35] powerful stuff right let's go let's try
[1:35:38] to close out here
[1:35:44] so we know that elohu was picking up
[1:35:47] something because these same things is
[1:35:49] what god picked up
[1:35:50] in 42 in chapter 42 with what job's
[1:35:53] statements were
[1:35:55] and basically this is the lesson to
[1:35:57] close this out
[1:35:58] job's suffering had driven
[1:36:02] job to see things about himself
[1:36:06] and about god that were not right
[1:36:10] even though job was a righteous man as
[1:36:12] we said at the beginning
[1:36:13] he had a transition to go through
[1:36:17] to move from this upright man to a
[1:36:19] greater testimony in a greater walk
[1:36:22] that could have only been proven try
[1:36:24] tested
[1:36:25] and come to life through his suffering
[1:36:27] i'm getting ready to close out
[1:36:32] now elohu was bringing out
[1:36:36] and we read it there in in in that
[1:36:38] scripture then in job 33
[1:36:41] about god speaking one way and in two
[1:36:43] and joe and elohim tied
[1:36:46] the pain of sickness and god speaking
[1:36:49] true vision of these things
[1:36:50] as two ways that god speaks to man for
[1:36:53] his good
[1:36:54] that as we said in verse 17 he may turn
[1:36:58] aside from his way turn aside from his
[1:37:00] plan
[1:37:01] and his purpose and turn away from pride
[1:37:03] in other words god's purpose
[1:37:06] is to save man deliver man
[1:37:09] through all of these experiences in
[1:37:11] other words elohu was not painting god
[1:37:14] as job did or even as he treatmented
[1:37:17] as just a god as an angry judge but
[1:37:20] elohim was showing
[1:37:21] that god as a redeemer a savior and
[1:37:25] it was a surgeon knife being operated
[1:37:28] not a whip upon job's life so it was not
[1:37:32] god punishing job with a whip but it was
[1:37:35] a
[1:37:35] very clinical surgical operation
[1:37:38] to cut pride out of job to gut the
[1:37:41] super-self-righteousness of the job
[1:37:43] to cut the things out of job's life that
[1:37:45] job didn't even know was there
[1:37:47] until as we said before the heat was
[1:37:50] turned up
[1:37:51] until there was so much pressure that
[1:37:53] job saw things about himself
[1:37:55] that he never knew he had i'm getting
[1:37:58] ready to close out here now
[1:38:00] all right so let me just find a point i
[1:38:03] still have some more stuff
[1:38:05] but i will close with this
[1:38:09] there's perfection that comes through
[1:38:12] suffering nobody likes to suffer
[1:38:14] but there's perfection that comes
[1:38:16] through suffering
[1:38:18] the psalmist david said in psalms 119
[1:38:22] 71 it is good for me
[1:38:26] that i have been afflicted that i might
[1:38:29] learn
[1:38:30] thy statutes so
[1:38:33] david realized that it was only through
[1:38:36] his affliction
[1:38:37] there were certain teachings and
[1:38:38] learnings you learn a lot out of
[1:38:41] blessings friends
[1:38:42] but you learn more out of suffering
[1:38:46] we know how the story of job ends you
[1:38:47] know
[1:38:49] but i want to challenge us all above all
[1:38:52] else to have the right attitude through
[1:38:55] our trials
[1:38:57] that god in his wisdom sends
[1:39:00] our way whatever the trial may be
[1:39:03] whatever the test may be and if it is
[1:39:07] and especially when and most importantly
[1:39:10] when you don't
[1:39:11] understand it is better to say
[1:39:15] nothing that they say the wrong thing
[1:39:18] i'll say it one more time it's better to
[1:39:20] say nothing
[1:39:22] i have to say the wrong thing and as
[1:39:24] brother branham said if you have nothing
[1:39:25] good to say
[1:39:26] about somebody sometimes you just just
[1:39:27] stay quiet
[1:39:30] because life and death is in the power
[1:39:32] of the tongue
[1:39:34] trials will come testings will come
[1:39:37] situations will come conflicts will come
[1:39:40] people who you trust who you love who
[1:39:43] you admire
[1:39:45] who you respect who you hold dear it is
[1:39:47] evident when you look through the
[1:39:48] conversations
[1:39:49] i'm wrapping up that job had a level of
[1:39:52] respect for these men you know
[1:39:53] he had an expectation of how this should
[1:39:56] help him
[1:39:57] it is just that they didn't help in the
[1:39:58] way he thought they would
[1:40:01] and he didn't realize that all of that
[1:40:03] was part of his exam
[1:40:06] the thing about it is friends god
[1:40:07] doesn't tell us what is
[1:40:09] you know in exam yeah the the first
[1:40:12] paper or the second paper or the ap
[1:40:14] or paper b or paper one or the first
[1:40:16] exam and second so so
[1:40:18] so you have different papers in the exam
[1:40:19] then god will tell you now
[1:40:21] which how much papers you have what is
[1:40:23] part of the test
[1:40:25] because in in in god's word even the
[1:40:27] invigilator is part of the test
[1:40:29] you don't know who god can use so when
[1:40:32] job taught the test was chapter one
[1:40:34] chapter two here it is his test
[1:40:37] went all the way up to elohu now coming
[1:40:39] to say listen
[1:40:40] you didn't realize it on a job but all
[1:40:42] of the conversation was also in the exam
[1:40:44] too you know
[1:40:46] you might feel your past chapter one
[1:40:47] when he said the lord gave the lord take
[1:40:49] it away
[1:40:49] you passed up to two when you say you
[1:40:51] speak like a foolish
[1:40:52] woman and i say nothing negative in fact
[1:40:54] chapter two end with job saying nothing
[1:40:56] at all
[1:40:57] if it didn't go beyond chapter two joe
[1:41:00] passed the exam
[1:41:02] but you real exam that caused the
[1:41:04] repentance
[1:41:05] started in chapter three when jobs had
[1:41:07] to say i wish i was never born
[1:41:09] we read it last week we cursed the day
[1:41:10] because the night because the night i
[1:41:12] was conceived
[1:41:13] that's all jokes happened in chapter
[1:41:15] three that's when after seven days of
[1:41:17] silence
[1:41:17] it really hit him what happened he said
[1:41:19] no no no no no no because the day
[1:41:21] i was born no no no no crazy day i was
[1:41:24] conceived
[1:41:24] let the sun door shine let me cloud over
[1:41:26] here and that open a tidal wave
[1:41:29] of his friends saying job what's wrong
[1:41:32] and job starting to defend and then
[1:41:33] recognize the witness if i saw righteous
[1:41:35] why god doing this at me i saw them all
[1:41:38] these years
[1:41:39] why he take my children why he checked
[1:41:40] my house well either enemy of god
[1:41:42] how could god bless on one hand and why
[1:41:44] god don't look at the enemy
[1:41:46] that's how joe became he watching the
[1:41:47] evil no you know i wasn't evil he
[1:41:50] coming at me and job began to get riled
[1:41:53] up and god's saying
[1:41:54] but look look at the exam
[1:41:57] chapter one and two was the was the the
[1:42:00] the pre-exam
[1:42:02] the real exam and you're acting up in
[1:42:04] the real exam
[1:42:06] so i want to encourage us you don't have
[1:42:09] to
[1:42:10] get ready if you stay ready i want to
[1:42:12] challenge you church
[1:42:14] operate as if you're always in the exam
[1:42:18] and we are because the prophet taught us
[1:42:20] the tutor the holy spirit
[1:42:22] is watching your conduct it is your
[1:42:24] behavior
[1:42:26] brother i'm true adoption he said i
[1:42:28] stomped him i turned the church against
[1:42:30] him
[1:42:30] i turned his wife against him i stomped
[1:42:33] him and
[1:42:34] and he still have a good behavior that
[1:42:36] is this is the message you know
[1:42:39] and we said it last week and i'll close
[1:42:41] with this
[1:42:42] it ends now with the virtue of the age
[1:42:45] because
[1:42:45] for job to be fully released he had to
[1:42:48] forgive these same brothers
[1:42:49] although he had his own issues he had to
[1:42:52] forgive them
[1:42:53] to pray for them which is broadly
[1:42:54] kindness on display
[1:42:56] so this book of job is about character
[1:43:00] suffering testing and trial because
[1:43:03] power without character is satanic
[1:43:06] anybody with me but if you go through
[1:43:08] the test
[1:43:09] and say the right thing act the right
[1:43:11] thing then god could confirm you with
[1:43:13] power can we bow our head so we're
[1:43:14] praying
[1:43:16] our heavenly father we thank you tonight
[1:43:18] for this closing
[1:43:20] lesson of this story of job there's so
[1:43:22] much more in
[1:43:23] this and lord it is your will we'll get
[1:43:25] back to it but i pray that god that you
[1:43:27] help your people
[1:43:28] as we go through so many different
[1:43:30] trials and tests and
[1:43:32] situations where it could almost create
[1:43:34] situations where we
[1:43:36] come to question you or question what we
[1:43:38] believe or what we know to be true we
[1:43:40] see a man job with a testimony lord and
[1:43:44] under pressure
[1:43:45] he showed certain things that lord you
[1:43:48] were pleased to be
[1:43:49] up to operate on and to cut out and to
[1:43:51] shape so that at the end of it
[1:43:53] if he'll be a different man it was not
[1:43:55] the same job one man that was in job 42.
[1:43:58] he was a different man he had went
[1:44:00] through some stuff
[1:44:02] lord and you brought him to that point
[1:44:04] of reconciliation
[1:44:06] repentance forgiveness you brought
[1:44:09] closure to his life and you blessed him
[1:44:12] because
[1:44:12] he was willing to admit where he went
[1:44:15] wrong
[1:44:16] he was willing to acknowledge that he
[1:44:18] said the wrong things and he made it
[1:44:20] right with you
[1:44:21] god help us tonight lord to be so
[1:44:24] cautious to not say
[1:44:25] the wrong things lord and if we do fall
[1:44:28] and fail lord as we
[1:44:30] sometimes inevitably do further give us
[1:44:32] the grace to repent
[1:44:34] and to look back at this as an
[1:44:36] encouragement to us
[1:44:38] that you are not doing anything to
[1:44:40] punish and to hurt
[1:44:42] your children father but lord all of
[1:44:44] your actions
[1:44:46] all of your movements all of your
[1:44:48] decisions
[1:44:49] is to bring us to a greater closer walk
[1:44:52] with you
[1:44:53] and to manifest your life through us
[1:44:55] help us to see it
[1:44:56] help us to understand it lord that you
[1:44:59] have a plan for each of us in this room
[1:45:01] tonight
[1:45:02] and for those who may listen to this
[1:45:03] tape that your plan
[1:45:05] would always come to pass lord your plan
[1:45:08] would always bring us to the state that
[1:45:09] we should be in
[1:45:10] and lord by your grace and your love you
[1:45:13] want us to have the right attitude not
[1:45:15] even jesus
[1:45:16] lord on his road to calvary said lord if
[1:45:19] it's possible
[1:45:20] let this cup pass he looked at the
[1:45:23] suffering he had to go through
[1:45:25] and it felt looked seemed like he was
[1:45:28] going to be too much but he was willing
[1:45:30] to say lord
[1:45:31] nevertheless not my will but thy will be
[1:45:35] done
[1:45:35] help us lord to walk into the suffering
[1:45:38] that you have for us
[1:45:39] what we can see and what we may never
[1:45:41] see with the right attitude
[1:45:43] to say lord not my will but thy will be
[1:45:46] done
[1:45:47] may you bless your church may you bless
[1:45:49] your sons and daughters
[1:45:50] may you minister to the years of
[1:45:52] salvation lord may you bless the service

[1:46:20] pre pandemic versions of us and the post
[1:46:24] pandemic versions of us
