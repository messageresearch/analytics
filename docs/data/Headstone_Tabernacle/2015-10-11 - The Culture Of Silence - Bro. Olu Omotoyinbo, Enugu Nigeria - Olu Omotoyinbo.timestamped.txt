[4:39] scripture Acts chapter
[4:41] 4 Revelation
[4:44] 8 St
[4:46] Luke amen
[4:57] amen Acts chapter 4 I read from verse
[5:01] one and as I spake unto the people the
[5:05] priests and the captain of the temple
[5:07] and the SES Came Upon
[5:11] them okay uh being griev that they
[5:14] taught the people and preached through
[5:17] Jesus the resurrection from the dead and
[5:19] they laid hands on them and put them in
[5:21] whole unto the next day for it was now
[5:23] even TI how be many of them which heard
[5:26] the word believed and the number of the
[5:28] men was
[5:30] 5,000 and it came to pass in the
[5:32] tomorrow that their are rulers and
[5:33] elders and scribes and anas the high
[5:36] priest and cers and JN and Alexander And
[5:39] as many as of the Kindred of the high
[5:41] priest were gathered together at
[5:43] Jerusalem and when they had set them in
[5:45] the M they asked them they asked by what
[5:48] power or by what name have you done
[5:51] this then Peter FW the Holy Ghost said
[5:54] unto them you realiz of the people and
[5:56] Elders of Israel if with this there be
[5:59] examine of the good deed done to the
[6:01] impotent Man by what means he is made
[6:03] whole be known unto you all and to all
[6:07] the people of Israel that by the name of
[6:09] Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom ye
[6:12] crucified whom God raised from the dead
[6:15] even by him this man stand before you
[6:19] whole this is the stone which was set at
[6:22] not of you Builders which is become the
[6:24] head of the corner neither is there
[6:27] salvation in any other for there is not
[6:29] the name of the heaven given among men
[6:31] whereby we must be
[6:33] saved now when they saw the boldness of
[6:36] Peter and John and perceived that they
[6:39] were un unlearned unlearned and ignorant
[6:42] men they marveled and they took
[6:45] knowledge of them that they had been
[6:47] with Jesus and beholding the man which
[6:49] was healed standing with them they could
[6:52] say nothing against it but when they had
[6:54] commanded them to go aside out of the
[6:57] council they confered among themselves
[7:00] saying what shall we do to these men for
[7:04] that indeed a notable Miracle hath been
[7:07] done by them is Manifest to all them
[7:10] that dwell in Jerusalem and we cannot
[7:12] deny it but that it spread no further
[7:15] among the people let us strictly
[7:17] threaten them that they speak hence
[7:20] forth no more uh that they speak hence
[7:22] forth to no man in this name and they
[7:26] called them and commanded them not to
[7:28] speak a all not teach in the name of
[7:31] Jesus but Peter and John answered and
[7:34] said unto them whether it be right in
[7:37] the S of God to Heen unto you more than
[7:40] unto God judge ye for we cannot but
[7:45] speak the things which we have seen and
[7:48] heard so when they had further
[7:51] threatened them they let them go finding
[7:53] nothing how they might punish them
[7:55] because of the people for all men
[7:57] glorified God for thou which was done
[8:01] for the man was about 40 years old on
[8:03] whom this miracle of healing was
[8:07] showed Revelation
[8:11] 8 chapter one I mean verse one I'm
[8:19] sorry and when he had opened the seventh
[8:22] seal there was silence in heaven about
[8:24] the space of half an
[8:27] hour amen and Fin
[8:29] St Luke
[8:33] 4 verse
[8:37] 16 and he came to Nazareth where he had
[8:40] been brought up and as his custom was he
[8:42] went into the synagogue on the Sabbath
[8:44] day and stood up for to read and there
[8:47] was delivered unto him the book of the
[8:49] prophet Isaiah and when he had opened
[8:51] the book he found the place where it was
[8:53] written the spirit of the Lord is upon
[8:56] me because he had anointed me to preach
[8:58] the gospel to to the poor he has sent me
[9:00] to heal the brokenhearted to preach
[9:02] Deliverance to the captives and
[9:04] recovering of sight to the blind to set
[9:07] at Liberty them that are bruised to
[9:09] preach the accept of the Lord and he
[9:11] closed the book and he gave it again to
[9:13] the minister and sat down and the eyes
[9:16] of all them that were in the synagogue
[9:18] were fasting on him and he began to say

[11:38] inos we thank you for making us feel so
[11:41] welcome and for the
[11:44] speciality and it's such a blessing to
[11:46] see our brothers and sisters
[11:49] again and it's a special blessing to
[11:51] brother zigma in Niger
[11:53] for amen amen amen and brother also
[12:01] um Johnny Was Here
[12:04] 2013 and it's so good to see all of
[12:07] you to see all of you and brother martin
[12:11] an who spoke last
[12:13] night we grew up together in
[12:15] Pentecost when we were much younger
[12:18] man and when I heard him last night I
[12:21] said brother the m still has the
[12:24] fire what a bless God bless Martin thank
[12:28] you for
[12:30] bless you so this
[12:32] morning I want to uh um speak um I hope
[12:40] briefly well it's realtive depends on
[12:43] what you mean by brief what I
[12:46] brief right lunch is with anyway so um
[12:49] you know when you leave here for lunch I
[12:53] want to speak on the
[12:55] title the culture of
[12:57] Silence
[13:03] and I must say up
[13:05] front I must say up front I'm sorry
[13:07] about you're not hearing
[13:09] me is not walking oh okay okay so I got
[13:13] to I got to look at you all right all
[13:17] right um um the culture of
[13:21] silence and this is a very difficult
[13:24] message for me to
[13:27] speak because brother Charles told
[13:31] you I'm actually taking brother joh
[13:36] space Johnny the
[13:40] serian he found a way to trick me into
[13:46] this because I was
[13:48] relaxed I was sure I had
[13:50] escaped I was sure I had
[13:54] escaped and brother Johnny calls me
[13:57] Bishop Bop brother oid calls him
[14:00] Bishop I said no you didn't get it all
[14:02] right you miss the
[14:04] ACT it's act
[14:07] Bishop just in case you've forgotten AR
[14:11] Bishop so if I'm Bishop so if I'm Bishop
[14:15] why brother listen and just come to
[14:20] preach so they can defy the words of
[14:23] this bishop every once in a
[14:25] while so this is this is tough for me
[14:28] really
[14:30] and when I preach in
[14:33] Nigeria it's
[14:35] different for the simple reason
[14:38] that I feel a
[14:40] [Music]
[14:41] responsibility in
[14:43] Nigeria because I am one of the people
[14:46] and I say that very
[14:48] humbly with all sense of
[14:51] Consciousness that the Bible
[14:53] said Let each one of you not think
[14:57] highly of himself than he ought to
[15:00] think and I'm
[15:02] conscious that he can talk and speak so
[15:04] much about what you have
[15:07] done and brother bam taught us not to
[15:10] live like
[15:11] that as a matter of fact brother bam
[15:13] taught
[15:14] us if you want God to bless
[15:17] you brag on somebody
[15:20] else put yourself on the
[15:23] ground where God can put his hand upon
[15:26] you because God resist the
[15:30] proud but gives grace to the
[15:32] humble and when you raise your shoulders
[15:35] up God is not going to struggle with you
[15:39] because Jesus said I am meek and lowly
[15:43] of heart he's lowly when you raise your
[15:47] shoulders up he's not going to raise up
[15:50] to try and put his hand on
[15:52] you if you want God to put his hand on
[15:54] you you got to stay low on the
[15:57] ground he can put his hand upon you
[16:01] you so I'm very
[16:03] conscious of my
[16:07] words but just so I don't make anybody
[16:09] feel
[16:11] [Music]
[16:12] nervous brother is Niger is a wild
[16:16] man he's not the same person
[16:20] again why didn't he just
[16:22] preach why do going do all this
[16:25] trouble for the simple reason that that
[16:29] I feel a
[16:31] responsibility
[16:33] obligation to the people in
[16:36] Nigeria in
[16:38] particular because as well as anybody
[16:41] else
[16:44] did I pushed out the
[16:47] Revelation and the
[16:49] inspiration of the seven thunders in
[16:53] this
[16:53] country a young man I was a young man in
[16:57] my 20s
[17:00] in medical
[17:03] school I gave up I I CAU a revelation by
[17:07] the grace of
[17:08] God of the seven
[17:10] Thunders brother colan wasn't
[17:14] there but when I got a
[17:17] revelation I knew that's what that man
[17:19] has been
[17:21] speaking
[17:24] words and I saw what he was
[17:27] saying brother
[17:29] words I was not good
[17:33] anymore my medical school career ended
[17:35] at that
[17:37] spot I lost all interest in everything
[17:42] else I had my final year
[17:45] exams in medical
[17:47] school haris was coming I sneaked out on
[17:52] my
[17:53] mother to go for the
[17:57] convention
[17:59] of course of course you know the
[18:01] result when I came back I had to receive
[18:04] the exam but the point making here is
[18:07] this I give my life for this and I'm
[18:11] sure you can
[18:12] relate because you did the same thing
[18:15] not just me because brother said when
[18:18] you catch this
[18:20] Revelation all your Ambitions of the
[18:22] worldall is
[18:23] gone you only
[18:26] one that's Christ
[18:29] amen amen so I push the inspiration out
[18:32] in this
[18:34] country anybody
[18:37] else the brothers today who are tagging
[18:41] me all kinds of
[18:44] names they they called me Coleman's
[18:48] boy they didn't even have the
[18:53] decency to put a brother to
[18:56] it they call mean
[18:59] Bo for giving out the
[19:02] tapes which I didn't ask to to
[19:05] do but I was asked to do
[19:08] that and I gave that
[19:10] out I went
[19:13] everywhere in school I mean from
[19:17] school we tried to push this
[19:20] out not so that you will follow a
[19:24] man but we found a prophet
[19:29] who revealed the entire mystery of
[19:31] God back side of the
[19:39] Bible and I
[19:41] felt it was worth given your life
[19:46] for it was what the
[19:49] cost of the oil in your Alabaster
[19:52] Box I thought this was worth
[19:56] everything forgive me for getting
[19:59] personal but just so you won't feel
[20:03] nervous about what I'm
[20:07] saying because I always all my
[20:10] life I wanted to be a
[20:13] doctor but once I cut a 700
[20:16] Revelation that was
[20:18] it all my ambitions
[20:21] changed and I influenced with other
[20:23] people not me alone with other
[20:27] people
[20:30] believe the seven
[20:32] Thunders as the real
[20:36] Revelation
[20:40] message raled
[20:42] revelation of prophet message the back
[20:45] of the
[20:46] Bible seven thundering
[20:49] Angels open up the entire
[20:53] word seven
[20:56] angels open the book of life to
[20:59] you seven thundering
[21:03] Angels you a
[21:05] revelation of the personal life of Jesus
[21:08] Christ so that Jesus Christ might be
[21:11] born in
[21:12] youth in you so that you can grow Grace
[21:17] to Grace glory to glory and become like
[21:21] Jesus Christ because brother said this

[21:34] chemicals of his

[24:49] [Applause]
[24:55] testimony amen amen
[24:58] so anyway you
[25:00] may so I just want to be
[25:03] clear with a recent
[25:05] history when I go out of the
[25:08] country I
[25:10] preach but
[25:12] Nigeria
[25:14] 2013 zma had a convention in
[25:19] Germany and in that
[25:21] convention spoke
[25:24] on
[25:25] 304 because lies that g
[25:29] out that we don't believe page
[25:32] 304 it's brother brenham's promise to
[25:34] the
[25:35] bride nobody has a
[25:40] franch amen amen no
[25:44] [Applause]
[25:51] man so anyway see the man
[25:55] here in that convention
[25:58] the first
[25:59] chice I don't think I ever said this
[26:01] before I don't think I ever said this
[26:03] before but zigma
[26:09] spoke sister zigma Daughter s a
[26:14] special and I still
[26:17] remember when this uh the intro was
[26:20] going for the
[26:22] special turn around like
[26:25] this and B her head
[26:28] and bow
[26:29] ahead at that point I felt for me
[26:34] something Ste into that
[26:36] meeting beside
[26:39] me and I knew it was going to begin to
[26:42] heal my hurt and my
[26:46] disappointment of what had happened
[26:48] Among
[26:49] Us you may like to fool
[26:52] yourself but I don't like to deceive
[26:54] myself I don't like to deceive myself
[26:57] the toughest thing to
[26:59] be is to be around
[27:01] people who will not take
[27:04] responsibility for their
[27:07] [Music]
[27:08] actions
[27:10] anointing you should not just be

[36:55] witness
[37:03] she along the
[37:05] way God give me another
[37:07] message
[37:10] Lo when I saw Mal first message was to
[37:15] tie up the Los
[37:16] end and I began to see the Los that he
[37:20] tied
[37:22] up before the Thunders will come to the
[37:25] prophet
[37:27] even the prophet Malachi
[37:29] 4 could never come to the seven
[37:33] Thunders
[37:35] until until until he went in the world
[37:40] and searched for all Los end and TI them
[37:45] up when he did
[37:47] that then and only then and only then
[37:52] could he come to the
[37:54] Thunders and here I saw
[37:57] as well as you saw if you want to
[38:00] believe in reality and be
[38:02] realistic all kinds of loose end are
[38:05] coming into the
[38:07] message at the same time we having a
[38:09] seven found
[38:11] manifestation totally against the word
[38:14] so God gave me another message
[38:16] Los I you T your losing as an
[38:20] individual or a church you are going
[38:24] nowhere you can preach for you want you
[38:27] have got to T those Lo end because even
[38:30] the prophet of Malachi Paul could not
[38:33] get away TI up the losers in the
[38:36] world Hallelujah so here it is friends
[38:39] here my third message to

[40:05] front it upset
[40:07] you but because my intent my purpose is
[40:12] not to offend or
[40:13] upset because friends when Israel was
[40:17] coming out of Egypt and those guys Moses
[40:20] went to the into the mountain to bring
[40:23] down the Ten
[40:25] Commandments they could wait for the
[40:27] promise they began to say where is this
[40:31] man Moses now wait a minute Moses the
[40:35] great
[40:36] prophet they could refer to him as this
[40:39] manes in the
[40:42] person it was so
[40:44] rude it was so
[40:47] ungodly it was so
[40:50] unchristian it was so against the spirit
[40:52] of God where is this man
[40:55] Moses of the land of
[40:58] Egypt thank God they
[41:00] admitted he brought them
[41:03] out but they told
[41:05] Aon make us
[41:08] gods and Aon said a wish
[41:11] was made them he said go bring your
[41:15] earrings Aon not know it was wrong of
[41:18] course was
[41:20] wrong and said bring your
[41:23] earrings and he made them a cal
[41:27] and Israel
[41:28] said behold
[41:31] Israel your God that brought you out of
[41:34] Egypt oh come on now no you can't be
[41:38] serious you may be seated Israel you
[41:40] cannot be serious you mean this C here
[41:44] brought you out of
[41:49] Egypt you know what it was they were
[41:52] fashioning a God in their own image a
[41:56] God that will suit them a God that would
[41:59] obey them a God that they will serve
[42:03] when it was
[42:05] convenient a god they will
[42:08] disobey it's
[42:10] convenient a god they will put what in
[42:11] his
[42:13] mouth and you can't say
[42:16] no a god they will defy his
[42:19] words and nothing will happen to them
[42:22] they'll feel no
[42:25] condemnation own
[42:27] image they said these be your Gods oh
[42:31] Israel and God told Moses God hears
[42:34] everything you say everything I say God
[42:38] told Moses go down quickly your people
[42:42] have corrupted
[42:43] themselves making this God in their
[42:46] image
[42:48] corruption finding a
[42:50] God that would obey you rather than you
[42:53] obeying him a what in his
[42:57] mouth you
[43:00] anything and the word of God whether
[43:03] it's in the Bible whether the prophet
[43:05] said it or not it's God's word it's some
[43:10] heting stuff that brought that's a God
[43:13] in your own image not the god of not the
[43:17] god of the Bible and I'm telling you
[43:18] your face on theet
[43:25] everywhere

[44:29] image Hallelujah we do what he wants we
[44:34] his word where the word of God says yes

[45:14] I'm talking like this I don't have love
[45:18] I have hatred in my heart God in heaven
[45:20] is my witness I hate nobody I don't have
[45:24] any shes with anybody
[45:26] but I'll show you from the Bible we are
[45:29] fooling ourselves thinking that nothing
[45:31] has gone away oh yes everything
[45:33] everything has
[45:34] happened only that it has not gone
[45:39] away Julian Brunell is riding another
[45:43] horse riding another horse see the white
[45:46] horse
[45:47] rider change that horse different
[45:50] color but one thing you got to know he's
[45:53] got a ball he's got no Arrow
[45:56] all action and no movement all backing

[46:09] telling you to your
[46:11] [Applause]
[46:17] face
[46:22] you the
[46:24] message the
[46:29] seated
[46:31] Jesus three times in the Bible be
[46:35] seated I I just preach three times the
[46:38] Bible be seated three times in the Bible
[46:41] Jesus came across Blind
[46:46] Men Matthew Mark and
[46:48] Luke recorded this the the um the the in
[46:54] incident and one of them said was two
[46:58] men another one said was blind
[47:01] BOS another one
[47:05] said but it was two men really if you
[47:08] put all
[47:10] together just happened to be the one who
[47:12] was most
[47:13] aggressive because the Kingdom of Heaven
[47:16] suffers
[47:19] violence told us and the violent taken
[47:22] by force if God said it let me tell you
[47:27] Church there's a faith moving into the
[47:30] Church of the Living

[47:43] now is been clouding what's really going
[47:48] on the heart of the tree the heart of

[47:54] growing make no mistake in the matter
[47:58] it's fing
[47:59] down it's been H down but the heart of
[48:02] the tree is still
[48:05] growing amen so anyway Jesus he saw
[48:10] those Blind Men and they cried out Jesus
[48:14] was passing and when Jesus is passing
[48:17] you want to cry
[48:19] out because what a
[48:21] difference it makes in your life makes
[48:25] your home it makes between the husband
[48:28] and the wife it makes between the
[48:30] children and the parents what a
[48:33] difference it makes when Jesus passes by
[48:37] nothing ever Remains the Same when Jesus
[48:40] passes by Hallelujah where there is
[48:44] where there is anger he'll turn into Joy
[48:48] where there is war he turn to peace he

[48:56] not as the scribes and the
[48:59] Pharisees even his
[49:01] enemies

[49:06] man never a man did the Miracles on this
[49:11] Earth that this man did he was different
[49:13] he was in a different class he was
[49:16] separate he was special because he was
[49:19] God and this blind man knew Jesus is
[49:23] passing by they were not like
[49:26] who are sleeping who are hungry looking
[49:30] at our watches they cried out in
[49:33] desperation son
[49:35] David have mercy on
[49:37] us you may be
[49:41] [Applause]

[49:58] do they already asked for
[50:01] Mercy come on Lord Heal them it's

[50:44] lot this is
[50:46] dumb stupid why should he say that

[50:51] smart and that's what they all
[50:54] felt Jesus said regardless of what they
[50:58] F what will thou I do for you they said
[51:03] receive our
[51:04] sight what's the lesson Jesus was trying
[51:07] to teach a

[52:58] anything else to
[52:59] say let's move into the
[53:02] future full of
[53:04] love prove that to me from the Bible
[53:07] show me from the Bible where you're
[53:09] coming I want you to show me from the
[53:12] Bible I will back off because God the
[53:17] only way we relate to God Is by
[53:21] faith now Faith is the substance
[53:25] of things hoped for the evidence of
[53:29] things not seen through faith we
[53:32] understand that the worlds were
[53:34] fashioned by the word of God out of
[53:37] nothing look into the
[53:40] Unseen from The
[53:42] Unseen God fashion this great
[53:44] world Hallelujah and said without faith
[53:49] it's
[53:50] impossible to please God the only way we
[53:53] relate to God by faith and every man has
[53:58] Faith you came here because you belied
[54:01] you are going to come here you come here
[54:05] you believe you going to go through the
[54:06] road and you won't have an accident you
[54:09] come here because you believe you'll be
[54:12] here you sleep in your hotel room you
[54:15] wake up the next morning if you are not
[54:18] so sure you will not sleep all
[54:22] night thought you will die but you just
[54:25] know you will wake up the next morning
[54:27] even though he's not promised to you
[54:30] that's how great a faith we
[54:32] have even when it's not
[54:34] promised tomorrow is not promised to us
[54:37] but we have faith to pull down tomorrow
[54:40] and wake up the next day how much more
[54:43] the promises of God how much more the
[54:45] promis of God that have been given to us
[54:48] how much more with fith we can pull
[54:50] those promes to ourselves and say that
[54:52] is mine mine mine mine and you children
[54:56] like Isaac you are children of promise
[55:00] we live by the promises that's what we
[55:02] live by that's what you live
[55:09] hallelu
[55:13] [Applause]
[55:16] Glory so I get accused and CJ people
[55:19] like me get
[55:21] accused of living in the
[55:24] past leave
[55:27] alone but faith is go
[55:30] by and yes Faith looks
[55:34] forward faith is long range
[55:37] Vision but notice notice some
[55:41] men spend their lives looking back to
[55:46] what was and they are so bued down what
[55:50] happened
[55:51] yesterday they sacrific their present
[55:54] and their future
[55:56] and some men live only for the now they
[55:59] don't care where they're coming from
[56:01] they don't care about
[56:02] tomorrow like the Rich Young
[56:05] Ruler he said eat that F eat drink and
[56:09] be
[56:10] married and God said you
[56:14] fool
[56:16] tomorrow so some men are like that and
[56:19] some men are so focused on tomorrow they
[56:21] don't care about the
[56:23] present they don't care about the future
[56:25] theast and that's what we're talking
[56:27] about when you say
[56:30] jul all
[56:32] alone you're only focusing on the
[56:35] fure but that's not Faith Hebrews
[56:39] 111 is the best definition of
[56:41] faith that we have anywhere in recorded
[56:45] history let you know faith is
[56:49] present
[56:53] now
[56:55] faith is present hands talking about the
[56:59] now the evidence of things hoped
[57:04] for so faith is both present tense and
[57:09] future doesn't just look at
[57:13] tomorrow tomor but it's not done yet
[57:18] subance amen amen of things hoped for
[57:22] the evidence of things not
[57:25] sinen when you talk about not sin we are
[57:29] talking about the past and the future
[57:32] because the Bible say we understand that
[57:36] the walls were made from things that
[57:38] were not
[57:40] seen so that's talking about the
[57:43] past the Bible also
[57:45] say I had not
[57:49] seen the things God has
[57:51] prepared those that love him all of that
[57:55] is in Hebrews
[57:57] 11 taking care of the now Tak care of
[58:01] tomorrow Tak care of the
[58:03] past faith is right in the middle of the
[58:06] road CH there it gathers

[1:00:30] why we have a faith that helps us to
[1:00:35] understand to walk with God you can't
[1:00:38] just say Lord I'm ready now I'm ready
[1:00:40] now to serve you now he wants you to
[1:00:43] look at your life where you are coming
[1:00:46] from it's you got to repent of that past

[1:00:52] you anymore but your respons ability
[1:00:55] like Mal for said to repent and follow
[1:00:59] him baptism and your repentance it's all
[1:01:03] about your past
[1:01:04] sins God hold you

[1:01:09] sins when you repent and you confess it
[1:01:13] it drops it in the of

[1:01:17] more and if anybody's remembering them
[1:01:21] you can look them in the ey and sing to
[1:01:24] them
[1:01:25] you may remember and remember and
[1:01:28] remember all that I have done but Jesus
[1:01:32] with a special Lord forg me of every one

[1:02:05] future a better Resurrection so you
[1:02:09] might inherit etal life that's
[1:02:12] Christianity that's Christian fa that's
[1:02:15] why Mal first message is so
[1:02:18] different from every message out there

[1:02:25] that had the revelation of Jesus
[1:02:26] Christ the things which were which are
[1:02:30] the things that are to

[1:33:26] here everybody will go after this
[1:33:30] men and it will
[1:33:34] threaten their position of

[2:23:38] announcement actually I realized and I
[2:23:40] want to remind
[2:23:42] us we need to study the word of
[2:23:45] God we need to read the Bible I found
[2:23:49] that the major problem we have is that
[2:23:51] we don't
[2:23:53] study study the Bible study the
[2:23:56] message when you get these things you
[2:23:58] cannot be
[2:24:00] deceived
[2:24:03] amen now I just want to put this down is
[2:24:07] something you know but for those who do
[2:24:09] not
[2:24:10] know
[2:24:13] amen I guess it was brother to that sent
[2:24:16] this message across I've read this
[2:24:19] message earlier sometimes last year and
[2:24:22] the brother Braham in all these things
[2:24:24] that are going around the churches and
[2:24:26] so you
[2:24:28] know there was a time we have to sign
[2:24:31] documents never to go to speak the
[2:24:34] things that were preached to us in
[2:24:36] church that's right amen I
[2:24:41] signed because I have to
[2:24:43] stay you know in respect to church order
[2:24:49] I will not be hold held responsible for
[2:24:52] that I knew it was
[2:24:54] wrong and I still know it's wrong I mean
[2:24:58] in this city that's why when you see me
[2:25:00] shouting I'm free I'm free and free you
[2:25:03] don't know why I'm singing that if you
[2:25:06] are not
[2:25:07] free you may not understand what freedom
[2:25:10] is so I'm
[2:25:12] free
[2:25:14] amen but the gospel the commission that
[2:25:18] Christ gave to every believer is go e
[2:25:22] all the whole world and preach the
[2:25:25] gospel and the gospel is being preached
[2:25:27] to you in church and you are being asked
[2:25:29] to sign a bond never to go to propagate
[2:25:32] that
[2:25:34] gospel that's
[2:25:36] witchcraft that's occultism that's
[2:25:39] Antichrist
[2:25:42] spirit amen it did
[2:25:45] happen and uh why I want to read this
[2:25:49] thing again is that I believe thought of
[2:25:52] the Lord can never
[2:25:54] fail all these wrong doctrines are going
[2:25:56] on and if you let your child in into the
[2:25:58] midst of these wrong doctrines the
[2:26:00] spirit guesss on
[2:26:01] them one brother in my church he he
[2:26:04] traveled and the little boy had to be
[2:26:06] left behind and the wife had been also
[2:26:08] in these churches that are preaching all
[2:26:10] these wrong false doctrines and this boy
[2:26:13] for one Sunday alone he spent in that
[2:26:15] place he came back again to church and
[2:26:17] in the cry room this boy was shouting I
[2:26:20] am the Holy Ghost I am the Holy Ghost I
[2:26:21] am the Holy Ghost I am the Holy
[2:26:26] Ghost very poor young innocent
[2:26:30] child why because that is the dogma and
[2:26:33] the doctrine and the shouting that this
[2:26:36] group are having are you following what
[2:26:38] I'm saying but what I want to just do
[2:26:41] here is that I want to say that I called
[2:26:43] a young man and told him I said you are
[2:26:45] not the Holy Ghost I lay my hands upon
[2:26:48] him and cast out that
[2:26:49] demon that's what we should be doing
[2:26:52] When You See It cast out the demon
[2:26:54] because you have the authority to do
[2:26:56] that and since that time he never did
[2:26:59] that anymore praise God why did I do
[2:27:02] that because I know that I know and your
[2:27:05] Prophet say this in Divine
[2:27:10] Healing Divine Healing is a message that
[2:27:14] the prophet preached in 195
[2:27:17] 54 in the month of
[2:27:20] December
[2:27:22] 19th
[2:27:24] amen listen to your
[2:27:29] Prophet I'm reading from paragraph
[2:27:31] paragraph 144 but the main Center Point
[2:27:34] is
[2:27:37] 116 Thomas looked at him or Phillip
[2:27:41] rather and said Lord show us the father
[2:27:45] who who is this father
[2:27:47] you are going to he said why I have been
[2:27:50] so long with you you don't know me he
[2:27:54] said when you see
[2:27:56] me you've seen the Father the father is
[2:28:00] in me believe that I and the father are
[2:28:05] one or believe me for the very work's
[2:28:09] sake that the father is in
[2:28:12] me it is not
[2:28:15] me that doeth the works it is the father
[2:28:20] that is in me doeth the works now this
[2:28:24] is the point now and brother AB Braham
[2:28:26] now now spoke and said I am not the Holy
[2:28:30] Spirit full
[2:28:33] stop
[2:28:35] amen William Braham said I am not the
[2:28:38] Holy Spirit and then I believe I wasn't
[2:28:42] there but I want to read to you the next
[2:28:45] thing he said he said
[2:28:47] you are not the holy
[2:28:54] spirit
[2:28:56] amen but if there is
[2:28:59] anything
[2:29:01] amen he is not the Holy Spirit but those
[2:29:06] message he
[2:29:09] preaches was not of him why because of
[2:29:13] the father that dwelleth in him
[2:29:18] so let th say the Lord settle the
[2:29:21] case I am not the Holy Spirit Malachi 4
[2:29:26] is not the Holy
[2:29:28] Spirit you are not the Holy
[2:29:30] Spirit but the holy spirit is that
[2:29:34] Spirit of the Lord
[2:29:36] Jesus that spirit that was in the Lord
[2:29:39] Jesus Christ that made him to do the
[2:29:41] works he did here on
