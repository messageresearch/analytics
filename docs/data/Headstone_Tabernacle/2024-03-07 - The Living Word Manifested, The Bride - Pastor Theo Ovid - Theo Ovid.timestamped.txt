[15:00] right
[15:01] back Amen in the beginning was the word
[15:04] the word was with God and the Word was
[15:07] God and we want to go down to verse 11
[15:09] he came unto his own his own receive him
[15:11] not but as many as receive him to them
[15:14] he that them gave he power to become the
[15:17] sons of God even to them that believe on
[15:20] his name which were born not of blood
[15:22] nor of the will of the flesh nor of the
[15:24] will of man but of God and the word has
[15:27] made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[15:29] beheld his glory the glory of the only
[15:31] begotten of the father full of grace and
[15:33] truth and we want to go to Matthew 24
[15:37] and verse one Jesus went out and
[15:39] departed from the temple and the
[15:41] disciples came to him to show him the
[15:43] buildings of the temple so this Temple
[15:44] was very impressing the disciples and
[15:46] Jesus said unto them see not all these
[15:49] things ver I unto you they shall not be
[15:52] left their one stone upon another that
[15:54] shall not be thrown down and as he sat
[15:57] upon the Mount of Olives the disciples
[15:59] came unto him privately saying tell us
[16:01] when shall these things be what shall be
[16:03] the sign of thy coming and of the end of
[16:05] the world three things they ask and
[16:07] Jesus answered said unto them first
[16:09] thing Jesus said to them take heed that
[16:11] no man deceive you number one
[16:14] deception before you get seals re all
[16:17] kind of mysteries and stuff take he no
[16:19] man deceive you let's talk about them
[16:21] guys for many shall come in my name
[16:24] saying I am Christ shall receive many
[16:26] you shall hear of Wars rumors of wars he
[16:28] shall AED that he be not troubled for
[16:31] all these things
[16:33] must come to pass amen but the end is
[16:36] not here for nation shall rise against
[16:38] Nation Kingdom against Kingdom there
[16:40] shall be famines and pestilences and
[16:42] earthquakes in diverse places all these
[16:45] are the beginning of Sorrows then shall
[16:49] he deliver you up to be afflicted shall
[16:51] kill you and he shall be hated of all
[16:54] Nations for my name's sake we talking
[16:56] about
[16:57] believers in case you didn't know then
[17:00] shall many be offended shall betray one
[17:02] another shall hate one another many
[17:04] false prophets shall arise and shall
[17:06] deceive many and because iniquity shall
[17:08] abound the love of many shall wax cold
[17:12] and he that endure unto the end the same
[17:14] shall be saved let's pray father we
[17:15] thank you for your word and I pray you
[17:17] would come and confirm it and make it
[17:19] alive make it real to your people in
[17:21] Jesus name I ask it amen and amen you
[17:22] may be seated thanks again for coming
[17:24] out tonight it's a blessing to have you
[17:26] to be here oh praise is
[17:29] God I have a context scripture uh from 1
[17:32] Corinthians
[17:33] 2 uh it says here in verse three I was
[17:37] with you in weakness Paul speaks and in
[17:39] fear in much trembling and my speech and
[17:42] my preaching was not with enticing words
[17:43] of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of
[17:46] the spirit and of power reason reason
[17:48] what's the purpose of this that your
[17:50] faith should not stand in the wisdom of
[17:52] men but in the power of God so that
[17:55] other words that your faith don't get
[17:57] excited about information that men is
[17:59] bringing but in the power of God because
[18:02] men could bring talk and information and
[18:04] think they never hear it so and see it
[18:05] so but you see the power that can come
[18:08] from man the spirit that can come from
[18:11] man the spirit and the unction and the
[18:13] power you have to see that and know that
[18:15] comes from God okay now verse 11 Paul
[18:19] said for what man knowe the things of a
[18:21] man save the spirit of a
[18:22] man which is in him so the spirit of man
[18:26] know the things of man talk about the
[18:28] things of man or could explain the
[18:30] things of man he went to say even so the
[18:33] things of God knoweth no man the things
[18:36] of God knoweth no man but the spirit of
[18:39] God the spirit of God brings forth the
[18:42] things of God now this is the part I
[18:45] want to get to now we have received not
[18:47] the spirit of the world but the spirit
[18:50] which is of god that we might know the
[18:52] things that are freely given to us of
[18:55] God now I want you to have an attentive
[18:58] here tonight yes sir there's an attitude
[19:00] to want to hear and to want to learn and
[19:04] to want to know to keep your attention
[19:06] that your mind will be strain here and
[19:07] everywhere I want you to be focused now
[19:10] that this word that we are speaking to
[19:11] you is God we have received not the
[19:14] spirit of the world but the spirit which
[19:15] is of god that we might know the things
[19:17] that are freely given to us of God which
[19:20] things also we speak this is the part I
[19:22] want to get to not in The Words which
[19:25] man's Wisdom
[19:27] teacheth amen so the speaking itself is
[19:31] not in Words which man's Wisdom teacheth
[19:34] but which the Holy Ghost teacheth amen
[19:36] comparing spiritual things with
[19:38] spiritual so there's a holy ghost
[19:40] teaching and there's a man's teaching
[19:41] it's not the same thing so God brings
[19:44] words God is not a
[19:46] Trinidadian God is the word Oh Glory to
[19:50] God do you see it now all right let's go
[19:52] so tonight I have a title The Living
[19:54] Word manifested the
[19:56] bride that's who she is years she be the
[19:59] Living Word manifested just think about
[20:02] it now friends oh God this is exciting
[20:04] me not you coming to church know you
[20:07] becoming the word The Living Word you
[20:10] will be the Living Word manifested you
[20:12] have to believe that you cannot remain
[20:15] you as you oh glory to God I want this
[20:18] service to be the most Uno service if
[20:20] Teo could get out of the way completely
[20:23] you'll see God you will see the word so
[20:25] therefore we have to get out of our own
[20:27] selves we have to become like Jesus we
[20:31] have to become the word manifested we
[20:33] have to come the prophet's prophecy
[20:35] fulfilled Oh Glory to God do you believe
[20:37] that tonight so you're not ordinary you

[45:30] the members of our body into discipline
[45:33] to the word that we might know how to
[45:35] live in this present day at the
[45:37] approaching Lord Jesus Christ this has
[45:40] nothing to with church membership this
[45:42] have to do with life that how we might
[45:45] be disciplined what for to bring your
[45:49] members in discipline to the word you
[45:53] have to do that you can't be saying Lord
[45:56] lustin alustin Lord help me no no no you
[45:58] have to bring your members the Bible
[46:00] even talk about mortified your members
[46:03] mortify the members of your body in
[46:05] other words bring your body in
[46:07] subjection understand how the laws of
[46:09] God work and bring your mind focus into
[46:13] the subjection it come like somebody
[46:14] have to study for doctor or whatnot you
[46:16] can't be a idle brain and study for
[46:18] medical school and stuff like that it's
[46:20] a lot of stuff lot of detail work
[46:23] whether you going eye or nose or
[46:25] whatever speci and whatnot is a lot
[46:27] intense study to be a specialist you
[46:29] can't um um wing
[46:33] it you Wing the knowledge and whatnot
[46:36] and then you put in operating
[46:38] theater pass the
[46:43] knife and you do all kind of crazy stuff
[46:46] like you know I hear story about a man
[46:49] who never want to be a dentist the
[46:50] parents want a dentist for him he he he
[46:53] go on and pull out some wrong man Teach
[46:54] something some kind of wrong things get
[46:56] Sue and end up in jail and set of
[46:58] trouble and what not because he
[46:59] following the parents parents want to do
[47:00] he hated Dentistry but that what they
[47:02] wanted he end pull out some kind of WR
[47:04] thing and do some crazy stuff God don't
[47:06] want that put some B Kingdom and he come
[47:09] Havoc no that why God be filtering
[47:12] filtering filtering filtering until he
[47:14] get the right kind right kind of son oh
[47:18] give the Lord some Praises go have
[47:20] plenty son you know but he filtering
[47:22] filtering filtering because he have to
[47:23] get the right kind of son that he could
[47:26] trust that he could honor Oh Glory to
[47:28] God hallelujah so do you see the purpose
[47:30] of the Mysteries the Mysteries bring the
[47:33] pess of God in other words let's say the
[47:35] Sip and Seed if we didn't have a clarity
[47:37] about what happened in G of Eden we then
[47:39] then the clarity of the Revelation bring
[47:42] her understanding this is God unveiling
[47:44] the mystery of what happened back there
[47:47] amen and all the Mysteries come to bring
[47:49] Clarity on God because God was too
[47:52] mysterious he himself was mysterious and
[47:55] he he had a burden how do I reveal
[47:58] myself now remember he's not a
[48:02] human we think a certain way we have a
[48:04] certain mind and that why God said in
[48:06] Isaiah your thoughts is not my thoughts
[48:08] your ways is not my ways your thoughts
[48:10] are not my you not thinking my thoughts
[48:13] you are your own thing because you are
[48:14] the image of Fallen man you thinking
[48:16] plenty things because I put all them
[48:18] neurons and all them in your brains and
[48:20] give you all your intelligence and you
[48:21] feel real
[48:24] bright
[48:26] but your thoughts and the expression of
[48:29] your thoughts come from the spirit that
[48:30] is in man but only the spirit of God
[48:33] could bring the things of God so when
[48:36] you hold the Book of Revelation you hear
[48:38] John say I was in the spirit on the
[48:39] Lord's day and suddenly a door open
[48:41] Heaven that's not man thing that's God
[48:44] thing I Heard a Voice say come up here I
[48:46] will show you things which must happen
[48:48] Hereafter I was in the spirit oh give
[48:51] the Lord What Spirit he was in
[48:53] Hallelujah pray it was in the holy
[48:54] spirit it's God Spirit on the Lord's day
[48:56] and God take him up and begin to reveal
[48:58] things to him and show him Revelations
[49:00] by
[49:03] Vision Oh Glory to God so he wasn't in
[49:05] the manifestation of it he was in the
[49:07] vision and the revelation of it so it
[49:09] have vision and revelation of it and it
[49:11] have manifestation of it oh glory to God
[49:13] what we see should make a church that
[49:15] will make a Revival that they will say
[49:17] that the seven thunders of Revelation 10
[49:19] is being manifested oh give the Lord a
[49:22] shout there's a revelation part and
[49:24] there's a manifestation part the lamb
[49:26] was slain before the found of the world
[49:27] that was Revelation part but he came now
[49:29] and died at Calvary oh give the Lord I
[49:32] shout in the house that was the
[49:34] manifestation
[49:36] [Applause]
[49:38] part do you see it now Revelation part
[49:42] manifestation part how many Believers
[49:45] get caught up in the Revelation part or
[49:46] the mystery part or the Talking part or
[49:48] the explaining part or the revealing
[49:50] part and they caught up and they find
[49:51] that that's the man of the there the
[49:53] only man you have hear that man which is
[49:54] a lie that's on P of hell you have to
[49:57] hear from God the voice said go to the
[50:00] angel who is Brother Bram boss go to the
[50:03] angel who had the book open not go to

[51:04] life a lie all that is deception and
[51:08] foolishness I no tkey have no key for
[51:10] nobody like God had the key for your
[51:12] life the kingdom of God is preached from
[51:14] here and every man Every Man Press their
[51:18] way into a get the Lord some Praises you

[51:22] your life I Ain loocking nothing I just
[51:25] preaching the word of God preach the
[51:27] kingdom and you press your way into it
[51:29] you have to say this is mine you have to
[51:30] talk like Joshua every place you put
[51:32] your foot is yours no tongue no key
[51:35] Cross Jordan and take what is yours
[51:38] Hallelujah they could only claim and
[51:40] possess What You Know by Revelation is
[51:43] your own hey glory to God what you know
[51:46] is your own you could fight for it you
[51:48] could press for it you could amen glory
[51:51] to God
[51:53] hallelujah oh this is so strange tonight
[51:56] hallah just pass page two now
[51:58] approaching page three so you know we
[52:00] can't finish this
[52:02] tonight prop speaks no one can doubt
[52:06] that the Scribe and Pharisees and the
[52:08] great Scholars of the Year 33 ad knew
[52:11] the exact laws of grammar and the exact
[52:14] meaning of words in which the Old
[52:17] Testament was written and for all their
[52:19] superb knowledge they missed the
[52:22] revelation of God's promised word man
[52:25] ested in the sun there he was set forth
[52:29] from Genesis to Malachi with whole
[52:32] chapters devoted to him and his ministry
[52:34] and yet except for a few who were
[52:37] illuminated by the spirit they miss him
[52:39] entirely amen we now come to a
[52:42] conclusion such conclusion as we have
[52:45] already found in the word as much as we
[52:48] believe in trying to find the oldest and
[52:50] best manuscripts to get the best record
[52:52] of the word possible we will never get
[52:55] get the true meaning of it by study and
[52:59] by comparison of scripture sincere as we
[53:02] may be it will take a revelation from
[53:06] God to bring it out and that is exactly
[53:09] what Paul said which things we also
[53:12] speak not in Words which man's Wisdom
[53:15] teacheth but which the Holy Ghost
[53:18] teacheth the true Revelation is God
[53:22] interpreting his own word by vindicating
[53:25] what is promised I believe this Bible is
[53:28] accurate Jesus completely authenticated
[53:31] the Old Testament when he was here on
[53:33] Earth and it was compiled exactly as our
[53:35] new testament make no mistake about it
[53:38] we have the infallible word of God today
[53:41] and no man dares take from it or at it
[53:43] but we need the same spirit that give it
[53:46] to teach it to us am Same Spirit is the
[53:51] part I want to get to
[53:52] [Music]
[53:53] now how we
[53:55] need
[53:57] Revelation by the spirit amen we don't
[54:00] need a new Bible we don't need a new
[54:03] translation though some are very good
[54:05] I'm not against them but we need the
[54:09] revelation of the
[54:11] spirit may God
[54:13] Begin by his Spirit to give us
[54:18] continuous lifegiving and prevailing
[54:21] Revelation then he said oh if the church
[54:24] could only get a fresh Revelation and
[54:27] become by it the Living Word
[54:32] manifested and that is where I get the
[54:34] core inspiration from the bride she
[54:37] going to be the Living Word
[54:40] manifested that's the bride who is she
[54:42] going to be the Living Word manifested
[54:45] so when people have their head down and
[54:47] he spoken with books The Living wordss
[54:50] from those books going be walking and
[54:52] saying God bless you amen and some of
[54:54] them might put the hand behind their
[54:56] back Hallelujah and don't even want to
[54:57] shake their hand they will turn down and
[55:00] reject the Living Word manifested GL
[55:03] we're going to get to it if not today
[55:06] Sunday I can't preach everything here
[55:08] tonight on page three I have 16 pages
[55:11] but here it is but brandham said they
[55:13] find fault with the man who was the word
[55:15] now they find fault with the word
[55:18] working through the man the word what
[55:22] working through the man they going to
[55:24] find fa with that
[55:25] so if you think people going to say oh
[55:27] you're the bride oh beautiful no no no
[55:30] the bride will be rejected do you
[55:32] understand that as Christ was rejected
[55:35] this bride going to be rejected she will
[55:38] be the rejected Stone yes sir the stone
[55:40] that the bills refuse and God going to
[55:43] make her The Headstone of the corner and
[55:45] it will be the Lord's doing oh glory to
[55:48] God so don't believe that people go
[55:50] party and rejoice and Shout with you
[55:51] because you are God's chosen or God's
[55:53] anointed or God called call in and and
[55:55] put no no no they're going to be
[55:57] rejected oh Hallelujah pray so if the
[56:00] church can only get what a fresh
[56:03] Revelation and become by it the Living
[56:06] Word manifested so that takes you out
[56:09] the class of church membership it take
[56:11] you of class of foolish Vision out of
[56:12] the class of foolish Vision it takes out
[56:14] you of the class of trying to impress
[56:15] other people and you trying to please
[56:18] God a fresh Revelation that you come to
[56:21] the place of becoming the word
[56:23] manifested I always do that which
[56:27] pleases my father oh give the Lord some
[56:31] Praises at age 12 Jesus could tell
[56:34] Joseph and Mary I must be about my
[56:36] father's business God have a business

[56:41] business the business of Sons and
[56:43] Daughters of God being restored Back to
[56:45] Eden the business of sons of God the
[56:47] daughter of God becoming to be
[56:49] manifested Sons according to what the
[56:51] whole creation is grown in for oh praise
[56:53] God Hal Hallelujah so listen this this
[56:57] so the Pentecostal with the restoration
[56:59] of the gifts and you spoke with tongues
[57:02] make a Doctrine out of that your light
[57:03] is gone out what's the matter is because
[57:05] you failed to stay with the word God's
[57:07] word were unfolding so we must unfold
[57:10] God's word god words unfold As Time

[57:31] same intelligence he's the same man with
[57:34] five senses he was a thousand years ago
[57:36] but look what progress he has made in
[57:38] the last 50 years and we could say look
[57:41] what progress he made in the last five
[57:42] years not 15 just five

[58:07] aside and thing pass nobody standing
[58:10] inside them things
[58:14] you yeah this look how Fallen sons of
[58:17] God what they have invented but we are
[58:20] trying to linger back on some old church
[58:23] Creed and stand there when God wants us
[58:26] to unfold the word amen we are living in
[58:29] the last days we are living in the time
[58:32] that God's Great beautiful Church ought
[58:34] to be standing on its feet shining like
[58:35] L Valley we but we are back well I
[58:39] belong to the Presbyterian method this
[58:41] Pentecostal arm this that he said what a
[58:42] disgrace we should be
[58:44] unfolding then he start to say what's
[58:46] supposed to be unfolding God's spirit
[58:48] pouring out sir go Spirit what people
[58:52] don't even talk about that no more is
[58:54] men only talking
[58:57] out but not Spirit pour men talking out
[59:02] watch we should be unfolding God's
[59:03] spirit pouring out not just one little
[59:05] gusher not one little baptism but
[59:08] baptism after baptism not a revelation
[59:11] just by faith or sanctification or the
[59:13] gift of the spirit but revelation after
[59:15] Revelation power after power glory after
[59:19] Glory we should be way up the road ready
[59:22] for the translation oh give the Lord a
[59:26] shout in the house power after power
[59:28] revelation after Revelation glory after
[59:31] Glory waiting for translation Oh Glory
[59:34] to God hallelujah praise God do you
[59:36] believe that tonight okay let's hit some
[59:40] something here
[59:41] now when God spoke he separate the light
[59:44] from the darkness God's word separate
[59:47] the water from the
[59:48] land God never speaks a word unless he's
[59:52] got a reason for speaking that word he
[59:54] is is not like you and I and myself that
[59:56] speak so much foolish things God speaks
[59:58] a word with a meaning and something that
[1:00:00] he's trying to achieve and will achieve
[1:00:03] by his word now when God said let there
[1:00:05] be light and there was no light that
[1:00:06] wasn't God that said
[1:00:09] that when God said let let there be
[1:00:11] light and there was no light after that
[1:00:13] it wasn't God that said that when God
[1:00:15] says anything he must back up what he
[1:00:18] says Church could you say Amen on this
[1:00:22] because many men saying God say and God
[1:00:23] I say at all you
[1:00:25] because God have it up and God have
[1:00:26] indicate what they saying so whenever
[1:00:29] God say anything he must back up what he
[1:00:30] says and when the word of God has been
[1:00:32] Vindicated when the word have been
[1:00:35] Vindicated that is
[1:00:38] light so so let's call the unindicated
[1:00:40] word the
[1:00:43] candle you can't see with that candle
[1:00:46] take off the light with that candle you
[1:00:47] can't see with the candle the candle is
[1:00:49] to be
[1:00:50] lit then the light is what make you see
[1:00:54] so so God's Vindicated word is light oh
[1:00:57] give the Lord some Praises do you see it
[1:01:00] tonight give me a scripture the letter
[1:01:03] kill
[1:01:04] it but the spirit give it life or light
[1:01:09] so the letter alone could
[1:01:12] kill it could sound good but it killing
[1:01:15] it could be well crafted but it killing
[1:01:18] because his letter there is no Spirit
[1:01:20] behind it there is no unction behind it
[1:01:22] there was no Vindication with it so it's
[1:01:25] killing the people in the church so
[1:01:26] instead of people come alive they're
[1:01:28] stilling dead and then they F death is
[1:01:30] the thing it's supposed to be oh no
[1:01:32] Praises no worship no atmosphere and
[1:01:34] they figure that is the message of the
[1:01:36] hour
[1:01:39] Hallelujah that's true you know no fire
[1:01:42] no
[1:01:43] Fai and when people preach they say
[1:01:46] you're excited you know the teacher the
[1:01:49] teacher he he only reach minds but the
[1:01:52] teacher position Place believers they so
[1:01:54] position place so much in
[1:01:58] CS like they place them position in CS
[1:02:00] in the message that why they so dead if
[1:02:03] you preach reation 5 now say you know
[1:02:05] that scripture and John heard the book
[1:02:07] he take the book lamps see and John say
[1:02:08] hallelujah glory
[1:02:12] amen how could you see your name and not
[1:02:16] praise and worship
[1:02:18] God I am showing I am showing you before
[1:02:22] the receive the Holy Ghost the Bible say
[1:02:24] said they return to Jerusalem with great
[1:02:27] joy not with a smile on the face you
[1:02:29] know smile God said so no no not with a
[1:02:32] smile with great great joy that bills
[1:02:35] they was afraid to they was afraid that
[1:02:37] why they closed the door they was afraid
[1:02:38] of the people out there to put pressure
[1:02:40] upon them because they no power yet
[1:02:41] without power you frighten without power
[1:02:43] you put give on tracks they beat you up
[1:02:45] with the tracks out there with kind of
[1:02:47] like that Jesus dead already you know
[1:02:50] Jesus not around you know I people
[1:02:52] looking for Jesus disciples you know
[1:02:54] Peter den and run pet when pet lick
[1:02:56] sharing on Jesus he said the master lick
[1:02:58] I don't I for
[1:03:01] that but Peter believe the promise so
[1:03:04] he's in the upper room with what Joy God
[1:03:06] you promise oh good you mean of all the
[1:03:09] people in Jerusalem God give me a

[1:11:05] fortified behind the word the whole
[1:11:07] armor of God and this believe it hallelu
[1:11:10] so
[1:11:11] Jesus has constantly told us that
[1:11:15] there's a separation and we find the
[1:11:17] last thing that's predicted to the human
[1:11:19] race before the great final day when we
[1:11:21] Ascend into the presence of God there'll
[1:11:23] a final separation we will separate the
[1:11:26] sheep from the goats amen God will
[1:11:29] continually and has been separating
[1:11:31] separating that's what he's doing
[1:11:33] tonight that's what he always does you
[1:11:36] can see it in every meeting he separates
[1:11:38] Faith from unbelief he speaks out he
[1:11:41] declares himself to those who will
[1:11:42] believe him and have feet in him Paul
[1:11:45] was a nazarit of the Lord he was
[1:11:47] separated Aon was a Nazareth and the
[1:11:49] Lord he was separated from his Brethren
[1:11:51] it's a total separation come please
[1:11:53] close with this
[1:11:54] here now reach page
[1:11:57] five it was a total separation we are
[1:12:00] not to go back into the world no more or
[1:12:03] have anything to do with the world but
[1:12:05] cleave only to God Jesus is coming after
[1:12:09] a bride a woman a church that is
[1:12:13] separate from the things of the world or
[1:12:15] the cares of the world she's separate
[1:12:17] from the Fashions of this Modern Age
[1:12:18] that we liveing she's separated from the
[1:12:20] cares and the traditions of churches
[1:12:22] she's separated only to God God and God
[1:12:23] is the word and as husband and wife is
[1:12:26] one so does the bride and the word
[1:12:28] become one here we go why why for the
[1:12:31] word is living through the bride that's
[1:12:35] her
[1:12:36] credentials that's her identification
[1:12:39] your identification not you go

[1:12:42] not
[1:12:43] the no it doesn't matter what church you
[1:12:45] go to your identification is the word
[1:12:47] living that's supposed to be your
[1:12:51] identification the only
[1:12:54] credential that a Believer has is the
[1:12:57] word of God living in him declaring that
[1:13:02] Jesus Christ is in that person yes sir
[1:13:05] it's so sad that the only way people
[1:13:07] could judge others is what church is
[1:13:09] going do who's your pastor depend upon
[1:13:12] what your who your pastor is then
[1:13:14] [Music]

[1:14:28] Streak and broke the
[1:14:30] anointing since after that he's very
[1:14:32] careful who he carry go people speak
[1:14:35] things and Chans have loose mouths
[1:14:38] disrespectful like to say this and say

[1:15:11] colored by my idea or feelings or
[1:15:13] emotions or my hindrances or whatever it
[1:15:15] is but you see these virtues here is
[1:15:18] what God has placed for that we could
[1:15:21] get out of the way amen dying to our El
[1:15:23] is what we yield ourselves to he said
[1:15:25] when you get the Holy Ghost a light
[1:15:26] comes into you and as you surrender the
[1:15:29] light
[1:15:30] expands what if you don't
[1:15:32] surrender what if you don't heal the
[1:15:35] light stay as is but if you begin to
[1:15:37] expand in all areas of your life
