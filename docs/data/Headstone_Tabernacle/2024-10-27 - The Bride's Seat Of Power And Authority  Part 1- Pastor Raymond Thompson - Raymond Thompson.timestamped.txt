[17:49] it soak right real good cuz it will do
[17:52] good it might be go Plum into the bones
[17:56] hallelujah oh brother sisters so I trust
[17:58] it will will go right into the bones
[18:00] this
[18:01] morning now the Bible says that uh let
[18:04] me just get it quickly just to there's
[18:07] so much scriptures on that I had to
[18:08] almost choose like which uh ones to use
[18:12] which ones to leave but Matthew 28 now
[18:15] remember Christ was risen and he went to
[18:17] the mountain and he spoke to disciples
[18:19] and just before he left watch what he
[18:23] said then when this uh and the 11
[18:27] disciples this is Matthew 28 16 amen he
[18:30] says and the 11 disciples went away into
[18:33] Galilee into a mountain where Jesus had
[18:35] appointed them and when he saw him they
[18:39] worshiped him but some doubted and Jesus
[18:41] came and spake and said unto them saying
[18:45] all power is given unto me in heaven and
[18:50] earth now this man is rising he's Arisen
[18:53] from the dead he's going now he's
[18:55] ascending but he tell them listen you
[18:57] Hallelujah I'm going but all power has
[18:59] been given to me where in heaven and on
[19:04] earth now if we SE it with him in
[19:07] Heavenly places then what power does the
[19:10] body of Christ
[19:11] possess now you must answer the question
[19:14] you must see yourself in it young people
[19:17] you need to see yourself in this you
[19:19] can't see your mother or your father or
[19:21] the deacons you must see I'm part of
[19:23] that body so where are you seated not on
[19:26] the seat here brother but we seated to
[19:29] that brother Daniel in Heavenly places
[19:31] in Christ
[19:32] Jesus so we have to be in Christ and
[19:36] when you in Christ then you in Heavenly
[19:38] places brother Raymond how do I get into
[19:41] Christ
[19:43] Hallelujah First
[19:46] Corinthians my my my so we're just
[19:49] nailing it down so that you can see what
[19:52] we saying here is not uh from he says
[19:54] here 1 Corinthians 12 133 for by one
[19:58] spirit we are all baptized into one body
[20:01] whether we be jew or Gentile whether we
[20:04] Bond or free and have been all made to
[20:07] drink into one spirit so how do I get
[20:11] into Christ by one Spirit brother not by
[20:14] one church not by one membership not by
[20:17] one group but by one Spirit we are
[20:20] baptized into the body of Christ and
[20:23] become one with
[20:24] him not United with him we become one
[20:28] with Hallelujah so when you speak of a
[20:31] man and his wife they become one
[20:33] Hallelujah so Christ and his bride is
[20:36] one Hallelujah so where are they seated
[20:38] today Hallelujah come on brother you're
[20:40] going to see your position you're not J
[20:43] on the earth man these things are going
[20:45] to perish and we focus too much on it
[20:48] but God is calling you up he told John
[20:50] come up John come up higher I want to
[20:53] speak to you John Hallelujah but as long
[20:55] as you yeah I can't reveal it to you you
[20:58] must come away from the family come away
[21:01] from your friends come away from the
[21:03] world and when he came up higher then he
[21:06] showed him what's going to
[21:14] happen my my my
[21:17] my so the Bible says now Christ is
[21:20] seated at the right
[21:22] hand of the father amen now brother says
[21:26] here in Hebrews chapter 1 what does the
[21:28] right hand mean he says now God has got
[21:32] the right hand that's that somebody is
[21:35] setting on on on it right hand means the
[21:39] power and
[21:41] authority amen it says God the authority
[21:45] of everything in Heaven and Earth and
[21:48] all heavens and earth is made by him
[21:51] amen then he says in expectation now
[21:53] watch as we go along you must listen to
[21:55] the quotes positionally they don't know
[21:57] what they are yes and that's what I'm
[22:00] trying to emphasize we know who God is
[22:02] we know who the enem is but there's a
[22:04] lack we don't know who we are we come
[22:07] when we drag our feet the enemy trips up
[22:09] around every corner but when you know
[22:11] who you are brother then you will become
[22:14] you become a Force you become a
[22:16] challenge he's afraid of you you afraid
[22:19] of him but you you'll be shocked to
[22:21] think how afraid the enemies of you
[22:24] every time he sees you because he knows
[22:26] you seated with Christ where in Heavenly
[22:29] Places come on brother and sister
[22:33] Hallelujah positionally they don't know
[22:35] what they are you Sons and Daughters of
[22:37] God and a lot of times you're looking
[22:39] for something great to come but you
[22:42] already got that the greatest can be
[22:45] given to you now we are the sons of God
[22:47] not we will be and we are now and we
[22:51] seated together in Heavenly places in
[22:53] Christ Jesus right now oh my what faith
[22:57] he says that that gets in the church he
[23:00] says if that gets in the church the
[23:02] devil moves away from that place come on
[23:05] now man a come on you better get a
[23:08] revelation to know who you are he says
[23:11] and if the church gets that Revelation
[23:13] he says the Devils run out brother they
[23:16] move out why the church has got a
[23:18] revelation of who she is brother

[23:39] going out a son I came in your daughter
[23:43] and I'm going out a daughter I don't
[23:45] care what happened last night I don't
[23:47] care I care what happened in the week
[23:49] but I'm a Son of God Satan might have
[23:52] made you fall he might have made you
[23:54] make mistakes but you still a Son of God
[23:57] your predes ination overrides your
[24:00] faults you are predestinated to be in
[24:03] the body of
[24:04] Christ
[24:06] Hallelujah and brother once you in
[24:08] Heavenly places no one can pull you down
[24:11] the enemy will try everything but he
[24:14] cannot get you
[24:15] [Applause]

[25:13] then he took your judgment your sin he
[25:15] took it upon him he become a sinner so
[25:18] that we can become righteousness of
[25:21] God hallelujah now here was the process
[25:24] in Christ Jesus free from judgment

[25:30] how can you be judged
[25:33] twice are you ready God judged Jesus
[25:37] Christ and he put our judgment upon
[25:40] Christ Christ paid for our Judgment at
[25:43] Calvary and if we in Christ we secured
[25:47] in Christ how do we get into Christ by
[25:50] one Holy Ghost baptism so how can God
[25:54] judge you again bras he judged Christ
[25:57] Christ took the penalty of our sin he
[26:00] became a sinner brother he he became a
[26:03] the the the you remember the the the
[26:07] serpent praison serpent that took the
[26:10] Judgment that's what he became and he
[26:13] took your my judgment so we judged

[37:30] among the people of the world and I'm
[37:32] sure we all want to live in that
[37:35] atmosphere how many want to live in that
[37:37] atmosphere so you see it comes to every
[37:40] son and daughter of God now you young

[38:48] atmosphere he says the supernatural
[38:50] there's many people today that doesn't
[38:52] know that Jesus Christ is still alive

[44:03] atmosphere then when I come in here I
[44:06] don't s still I want my children saved
[44:08] so I create an
[44:11] atmosphere you know what brother man
[44:13] says we little Gods he said he came home
[44:16] one day and his wife was upset the phone
