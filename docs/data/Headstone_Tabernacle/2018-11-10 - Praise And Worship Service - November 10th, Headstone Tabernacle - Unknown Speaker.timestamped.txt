[38:48] toilets I can't forget the Lord and
[38:56] shout of praise maybe see a man well god
[39:08] bless you friends it is certainly a
[39:11] privilege a great privilege should be in
[39:13] the house of the Lord Jesus Christ this
[39:14] evening among the levers of like
[39:17] precious faith both who I hear
[39:20] physically in the room and those that
[39:22] are connected live on the internet we
[39:24] certainly greet you tonight in the
[39:26] precious name of our Lord and Savior
[39:28] Jesus Christ
[39:29] I'd like to greet you on behalf of our
[39:32] pastor brother over tonight we say
[39:34] welcome to a fellowship in the name of
[39:37] the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[39:39] special welcome to all the churches and
[39:42] believers here special blessings to
[39:44] believers from Ephesians Tabernacle
[39:47] Bethlem tabernacle reveal with
[39:49] tabernacle little flock Tabernacle boat
[39:52] Tabernacle Eagles gathering and any
[39:55] other group fellowship this evening
[39:58] instead he went to acknowledge by the
[40:01] gorge go blessed you with a rotten gorge
[40:03] in the back of bless you
[40:04] welcome brother Guerrero god bless you
[40:07] for the Norris god bless you amen so I'm
[40:12] gonna get out of the way because tonight
[40:13] is a night to worship you man tonight is
[40:16] not a concert it's not entertainment
[40:19] it's not a show it's a gathering of
[40:21] worshipers because we were born to
[40:23] worship we were created to worship the
[40:27] devil wanted worship that's why he tried
[40:30] to have a pool up in heaven but we
[40:33] rejected that kook and our worship
[40:35] reserved we reserved Almighty God even
[40:39] when we are tired we worship even when
[40:41] we don't feel well we worship even if
[40:44] we're sick and body we worship because
[40:46] worship receives the blessing and the
[40:49] church
[40:49] a man he may be seated I always say
[40:53] there's a difference between praise and
[40:55] worship we praise God because he blesses
[40:57] we praise God because he does things for
[40:59] us we praise God for there are many
[41:01] reasons to praise God but worship has
[41:03] nothing to do with what God does for you
[41:05] it has to do with who he is
[41:07] worship is because He is God and he is
[41:10] worthy of the praise whether you have
[41:12] money or don't have money whether you
[41:13] were sick or you are well he is still
[41:15] caught by himself and he deserves our
[41:18] worship he deserves worship because he's
[41:20] a hobbit IRA he deserves worship because
[41:23] he's a homage , he deserves worship
[41:26] because he's a healer
[41:27] he's a restorer he's a deliverer he's a
[41:30] black Taizo he's a way makeup he's a
[41:33] planner
[41:33] he's a fortress He is God all by himself
[41:36] and
[41:38] ain't no rock all gonna praise me
[41:41] ain't no devil gonna take my joy
[41:44] hallelujah before I call back the
[41:47] worship leaders when God bless you
[41:50] sister Pam so good to see you in the
[41:52] house of the Lord today to give God
[41:55] things and for those who you don't know
[41:58] last night
[41:59] bandits went into their house and at
[42:03] gunpoint tied him up and robbed them and
[42:05] when I was book speaking about the Andy
[42:07] this morning she said she wants to come
[42:08] in the house of God because she has a
[42:10] reason to tell God that she's alive
[42:12] [Applause]
[42:13] [Music]
[42:15] so we've thank God that she is here
[42:18] tonight you may be seated
[42:21] and I heard somebody say something
[42:24] recently you know that song we sing in
[42:28] everything mmm thanks sometimes it's
[42:31] hard to give thanks for everything
[42:33] because when things come away that's
[42:35] hard it's hard to thank for it but in it
[42:39] we can find a reason to thank God he
[42:42] carries us through experiences and we
[42:44] can understand and it's hard to seek God
[42:46] thank you for this trial but we can see
[42:49] in this trial in everything we could get
[42:52] called thanks so I don't know what
[42:54] condition you came here tonight in but
[42:56] in everything we could kill the King of
[42:59] Kings all the hands so tonight is not
[43:03] about doctrine is not about fellowship
[43:05] is not about group it's about the shed
[43:07] blood that was shed on Calvary that when
[43:09] God sees shoot up blood he sees you
[43:12] perfect he sees you separate he sees you
[43:15] as a royal priesthood a peculiar people
[43:18] and to the young people that I hear the
[43:21] devil could have somebody cannot have
[43:23] all there will be some young people will
[43:26] reject the devil's offer we will reject
[43:29] as tires the fashions everything and
[43:32] we'll give God one hundred percent so
[43:35] may the Lord bless you be at home if you
[43:39] understand you can stand if you want to
[43:41] dance iike tents if you want to show he
[43:43] could shout if you want a run outside
[43:45] and run around the building you could do
[43:47] that because when John saw his name he
[43:51] said all in heaven all on the earth or
[43:54] under the earth he couldn't contain
[43:56] himself so this is not the place to be
[43:59] here tonight
[44:02] because when the Prophet spoke he said
[44:04] he felt to be him unseemly there's an
[44:06] unseemly kind of behavior that comes
[44:08] upon you and the Holy Ghost comes upon
[44:10] you you forget who's next to you you
[44:12] forget who's behind you you forget who's
[44:14] in front of you because it's a
[44:16] relationship that's not horizontal but
[44:19] it's vertical your relationship is not
[44:21] with man it's with coddled by himself
[44:24] made a lot less you we shall have a
[44:27] grand time in the holy ghost tonight
[44:29] Mira lo richly bless you
[44:33] [Music]
[44:37] are you happy tonight or you're
[44:40] appreciated reading from brother Isaac
[44:42] over this evening hallelujah hallelujah

[44:47] sister Pam tonight or let's up my hands
[44:50] oh oh we want to give you all the thanks
[44:53] all the praise let's can we keep it at

[57:42] this is a message of do's and don'ts and
[57:44] there are doors that just won't won't
[57:47] partake of this heavenly mana it's just
[57:50] enough to wonder can't they see the
[57:52] power come to think of it sometimes the
[57:56] tour don't - well sit of the realities
[57:59] of this insane age tell me why shape of
[58:03] your eyebrows and then draw it back with
[58:05] a pencil is it just the fits in a circle
[58:08] why cuts off you're here then stick on a
[58:11] piece it makes no sense to me
[58:14] it's bone I've gotten desensitized
[58:17] yes it's insane but they cannot see that
[58:21] they worship Him in vain offering up
[58:24] strange fire can only cause death and
[58:27] yet they are already captured by that
[58:30] Nets Nimrod pipes Lucifer yes he's
[58:34] huntin he's prowling still capturing
[58:37] those who unsealed with the seven seals
[58:39] the church wall seems to think that they
[58:42] are worshiping God when the scripture
[58:44] clearly says that they are of their
[58:46] father
[58:47] the temple there seems to think that
[58:49] this is about signs wonders and miracles
[58:52] well it's about a life worthy of the
[58:56] gospel of Jesus Christ the scriptable
[58:59] sake that it would be so deceiving it
[59:03] would deceive the very elect if possible
[59:06] if possible I say because now they are
[59:09] quoting and saying just what the
[59:11] prophets say as mrs. Jesus Christ a
[59:14] people who believe in the message of
[59:16] Malachi 4:5 a mighty marching army we
[59:21] are to have a personal experience with
[59:24] our Lord apply force that even at its
[59:27] worse nothing can move us from where we
[59:30] stand even if some may say that there is
[59:34] a it man
[59:35] there is no more a one-man ministry that
[59:39] is history now it's about you and me God
[59:43] revealed in simplicity revelations 10 X
[59:47] 11 is awesome we are Christ is the
[59:51] mystery of God revealed already married
[59:54] and have on display that wedding band of
[59:56] predestination it's pregnant Liautaud
[59:59] with his word so therefore no other man
[1:00:02] have access to my room so praise God for
[1:00:06] sending a prophet come on now let's pan
