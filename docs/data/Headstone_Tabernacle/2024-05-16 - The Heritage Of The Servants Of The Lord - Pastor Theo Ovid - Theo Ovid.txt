the let's pray father we thank you for the night we thank you for your presence Lord are we such a needy people we come looking to the Cross we come connecting to the Cross Lord where our whole dependencies upon you we are yielding ourselves to you tonight that you might have the pinenes take our eyes take our lips take our ears take our hands our feet our heart our Spirits our body our soul may we be a living Tabernacle of the living God's Dwelling Place granted father speak to us we need to hear from you granted God in Jesus name we ask it amen amen God bless you and welcome and if you have your Bibles i' like to turn to Matthew chapter 3 we want to read from 13-1 17 and Isaiah 54 want to read two verses there verse 15 and 17 Reading from Matthew 3 verse 13-1 17 then commed Jesus From Galilee to Jordan unto John to be baptized of him but John forbat him saying I have need to be baptized of Thee Come Thou to me and Jesus answering said unto him suffer to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness then he suffered him and Jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and low the heavens were open unto him and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove and lighten upon him and low a voice from Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased Isaiah 54 reading verse 15 and verse 17 verse 15 behold they shall surely gather together but not by me whosoever Shall Gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake verse 17 no weapon that is form against the shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against the in judgment Thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord and their righteousness is of me sayeth the Lord may God bless his word you may be seated and this scripture um Matthew chapter 3 and the Amplified it says here and Jesus replied to him when he says when John said I should be baptized by you okay and but Jesus replied to him permit it just now for this is he Amplified for this is the fitting way for both of us to fulfill all righteousness that is to perform completely whatever is right then he permitted him so it means that because Jesus was Jesus he didn't take a shortcut he didn't say you know this is above me this is I don't have to do this no Jesus submitted himself to the Fulfillment of the word which is the Fulfillment of righteousness do you see it now so in other words there must be no excuse in fulfilling God's word there must be no excuse in our desire and passion to fulfill what God promising us are amen praise the Lord so tonight I have a title the heritage of the Servants of the Lord very strange but this is what I have to share share with you tonight the heritage of the Servants of the Lord and it's from the scripture No Weapon that is formed against he shall prosper every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord now note it didn't just say servants um you know this is the true servants we talking about now true Servants of the Lord this is the Heritage and their righteousness is of me and that and the Amplified righteousness is to perform completely whatever is right amen isn't that right amen so then this in the Amplified says no weapon that is form against you shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against you in judgment you shall show to be in the wrong this peace righteousness security triumph over opposition is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord those in whom the IDE servant of the Lord is reproduced this is the righteousness or the Vindication which they obtain from me this is that which I impart to them as their justification says the Lord you know we we spoke about uh the the righteousness of faith and that's a very important message you have to listen you have to study it you have to partake of it because this is the eyes of God what God sees so we want to strike something on that fivefold Ministry so that fivefold Ministry is connected to us connected to God's people and you have to see it clearly from God's perspective because they have to be proclaimed in that sense or attributed to be righteous not in their own righteousness but God said here that this is what I impart to them as their just ific ation isn't that right Heritage of the Lord so this fivefold ministry as we know and which we teach here will be the ministry of Jesus Christ it will not be man's Ministry and this fold Ministry have seven parts to fulfill one it will be for the Perfection of the Saints two it will be for the work of the ministry three is for the edifying of the body of Christ four till be all come to Unity of the faith five unto the knowledge of the Son of God six unto a perfect man seven unto the measure of the fullness of the stature of Christ so that is the purpose and the objective of God having a Ministry called the fiful ministry these gifts that God plac in the body not out of the body have out of the body but this is in the body for the Perfection of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come to Unity of the faith not Son of God perfect man to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ so no man Ministry could accomplish these seven things Oh Glory it will take the ministry of Jesus Christ no human could accomplish this it will take the Holy Ghost itself isn't that right now he said he presents his army in the form of five officers first apostles and Prophets and teachers and pastors and evangelists that is his army he didn't put a tape to reprove the fightful ministry he didn't put press play to reproduce the fful ministry he have an army because we in a war we in a battle we have to have men that God could use that men have chosen that men that God have elected and selected and predestinated under this hour Oh Glory to God so he not not not a man he present his army in the form of five offices first apostles then prophets then teachers then pastors then evangelist that is his army that is his soldiers that is his commanded officers his commanded officers to give instructions to give directions oh give the Lord a shout to to to produce leadership Divine leadership Oh Glory to God led by God because as men as are led by God they are the sons of God oh give the Lord some Praises tonight hallelujah hallelujah glory to God glory to God all with the baptism of Holy Ghost waiting out there to meet the enemy on any grounds he comes upon to meet the enemy with the word of God each one backing one another up not each one cutting one another up sa if a man cutting somebody up that's not no 5 ministry that's not one of his commanded officer they have to be backing one another up this is part of God's amen glue this is part of God's condition this is part of God requirement not just a man in a circle somewhere no each one backing one another up how could God and a man fight God and an next man oh give the Lord a shout the Holy Ghost can't behaving one man and misbehave another man something is wrong somewhere the Holy Ghost amen behave the the same way because he's the same yesterday today and forever oh glory to God so do you understand that God is under the match God is on the move and he cannot break the law of his word you may be seated he brings his he presents his army five officers commanded officers all with the baptism of the Holy Ghost waiting out there to meet the enemy any GS they come on to meet the enemy with the word of God Amen each one backing one another up with him the chief Captain not out in front up here not back behind them but in them so somebody take a a light and and and Rainbow in front them that what I supposed to mean that's the Instagram picture pillar fire above pillar fire inside p no pillar fire to be inside because Jesus told them I will not leave you comfortless he was the comforter he was the word with them but he wasn't in them yet he said I have to go that the comforter might come if I don't go this spirit this comforter this power will not come into you you oh glory to God so the promise is God coming into you not God around you above you no all that is fine but you want God inside of you because that's the purpose of God God above us God With Us and now God in us Oh Glory to God God in us smoking drinking and run woman God in us can't go and commit adultery God in us can't go and fornicate God in us can't go and lie go oh give the Lord some shout in the house that is God in [Applause] us God in is his righteousness each one backing one another up don't don't ever forget that not each one cut on politics and whatnot and that's human that's polit it as ministers as politicians these guys as ministers you know they really supposed to be in Parliament in some kind of conference and thing you know they not they really not supposed to be any Pulpit you know that's where they really belong you know God is not a politician because God don't manipulate God don't speak things that how they they tell you what you want to hear but they're not telling the truth because only the truth could set you free if we tell you what you want to hear then you get stimulated in the gray matter up here but I hear the truth the truth is cut the truth is a sword the truth have a probe of the spirit the sword of the spirit to go between the bone and the mar to see what going on inside of you oh give the Lord some Praises each one backing one another up with him the chief Captain not out here in front up here above back behind them but in them that's the Army vindicating what his resurrection not vindicating this church orating a group or a move or a camp no his resurrection not vindicating some man some man of the Hour his shouting out his his resurrection Oh Glory to God so we are here to vindicate his resurrection he was resurrected in a prophet he's going to be resurrected in a bride oh give the I shou in the house Oh Glory to God we not yet to vindicate no church or no man or no group here to vindicate his resurrection to prove to the world he's not dead but he is raised from the dead oh give the Lord a shout Oh Glory to God glory to God this is beyond God s a Prophet this is a prophet's prophecy oh give the Lord a shout he came to introduce Jesus Christ to the world and to the Bride of Jesus Christ Behold the Lamb of God oh hallelujah hallelujah Give the Lord some Praises tonight glory to God oh I love him I love him I love him this ministry of Jesus Christ is to bring us together not to CH us apart not to have divisions isn't that right that is what the ministry is for Unity of the faith Hallelujah and what the prophet came to do to turn Hearts back to the faith so once the faith come afterward the faith is manifested then there could be a Unity of that Faith because there's only one Lord there's only one Faith there's only one baptism it don't have all kind of message Faith you know it have One Faith that's in Ephesians isn't that right Hallelujah that's the Bible Faith that's the faith that Abraham had that's the faith that the early church had that's the faith that has to be restored we have to go back to that faith we can't talk about Rapture until we get back that Faith because we need Rapture in faith Oh Glory to God and before we hit Raptor in faith we have to get deep F that was once delivered to the Saints oh give the Lord a shout in the house you can't break this message if you try Oh Glory to God this locked in this tied in Hallelujah let's go you know in old time when they used to make gold before they had to smel it to burn it out they used to beat the gold out beat the sludge out the iron the copper and stuff keep beating and turn it over and beating it the Indians do that now beating gold they beat it you know how they could tell all the animals out of it all the dirt and stuff and the dress out of it when one that was beaten could see his own reflection like a mirror it was clean and clear enough till it reflected the beater are you ready that's the way God does he takes the gold that he has found in the Earth that is you you didn't hear that if if you hear that you have a bigger amen than that he take the gold that he found in the earth that is you and he beats it by the holy spirit so you come here to get licks you come here to get beat to beat out your sludge to beat out your to beat out your laziness to beat out your unbelief to beat up your fornication your lies your sin whatever it is to beat that out yeah come here to argue and fight you come here to get the word to come and cut it out and beat it out until what until he could see his reflection Oh Glory to God and the reflection is the Perfection oh give the Lord some Praises Give the Lord a shout in the house glory to God hallelujah hallelujah so God pick us up as his goal but we dirty we have mud we have iron you all kind of false thing around you a born righteous you're born in sin you're born in a condition you grow up in that condition you come to church in that condition but God will not let you remain come on now preach back to me somebody he's not going to let you remain in that condition you are here to be beaten you are here to be corrected you are here to be instructed that's the way God does he takes the gold he has found in the earth he beats it by the Holy Spirit turn it over and over and over beaten it until he receives he can see his reflection isn't that right Hallelujah so Jesus said the same works I do shall you do also so many of us try to do the works of Christ before the reflection of Christ is in us there's the trouble we find look at that he's saying get the reflection first and then do the works after people believe a testimony know people have so much of works and afterwards their life rotten as hell Hallelujah you see what I'm talking about now they they near in church but they further from God so many of us try to do the works of Christ before the reflection of Christ is in us there's the trouble we find those things happening you know I know it we see these tumbles along the road we find this crap heap of ministers and they still want to preach but they like iron P you know have um um buying iron and old bottle how you say old bottle buying um what you say old battery battery and iron scrap any scrap iron them scrap coming around anybody have old battery bottle byon and and Battery buying old old iron scrap iron Scrappy for ministers have a truck coming for them just now scrap people of Ministers of Christians not just Ministers of Christian Christians piled along the road that why they going collect them on sale is because they didn't get into it right and that is why I'm here this morning try to teach this little church and myself and myself how that we can become the dwelling place of the Living God how many would like that would like that the dwelling place of the Living God lust for money lust for big things Lust For popularity these things are debt to the believer we don't care a tent or a cottage why should I care live or die sink or drun this is the thing I'm interested in the kingdom of God whether I maintain my home whether I maintain my family whether I maintain whatever it is let me maintain Christ and then for the ministry he says Build Me Up Oh Lord into this let Christ be my head that working through me on my Foundation my faith that's in him let virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness work in me not me work let these things work in me we have to see the working of God of the working of the Holy Spirit of the working of these virtues in us we it have to work it have to be operative it can't be a text we preach on it has to be tested and they say faith that can't be tested can't be trusted God can only trust you when he could test you oh glory to God so you have to bring your true stuff that not just say Lord take me out but take me through because when you come through something happens to you that's where you get character formation from oh give the Lord a praise in the house when you're a child you want to come out when you're growing and you're in growth mode you want to go through because you'll understand the process Jesus learn obedience oh God don't get me started tonight by the thing that he suffered there are stuff we have to learn Oh Glory Give the Lord our shout Give the Lord our shout and know I hope this fire tonight and help you tonight I don't care how young you how old you are you are still more things to learn we don't know everything we can't know everything every days is a learning time you have to learn to be old and all oh give the Lord some Praises only the old people can understand that hallelujah praise God so let Christ virtue his knowledge Temperance patience godliness brother can is working me oh lord is my prayer I don't care live or die sink or drunk denomination or no denomination friend or no friend let that work in me let Christ's virtue his knowledge flow out watch these words now flow out not my mou know flow out watch thisall that I might be able to teach those for God has set who has set God has set in the church Apostles prophets teachers Pastor evangelist all for the perfecting and bringing all these virtues into it we cannot give what we don't have a lot of talk and Mysteries going out and going out and talking out 2 three 4 hours and whatnot that's talk but this virtue is not talk this virtue not talk when the two people come making love in church and the baron says stop it stop it stop it stop it and the spirit drop down and if they say dead they die if they say blind they blind you know how people going to fail that test they will say blind show them power disrespectful Spirit you and they get Vindicated because somebody Dr Cho to speak the word death they will die blind they would blind he had options that was given him by God and he went outside of that and say I forgive you he said that because he knew he would have done things wrong too and by him forgiven them God was so pleased because he demonstrated what it is to be like God for God so loved the world this wicked world he gave his only begotten oh oh give the Lord some [Applause] Praises how could we be like God and we can't forgive how could we be in his reflection and we cannot forgive forgive us as we forgive those who trespass against us you being forgiven is based upon how you forgive others God will allow people to wrong you oh give the Lord a shout in the house God will allow people to do things you that's not right that's unfair to see what you will do oh give the Lord some praises and when you ready to forgive you're ready to be healed when you're ready to forgive you're ready to be delivered when you're ready to to forgive you're ready to be filled with the Holy Ghost look where brotherly kindnesses and look where the holy spirit slutter is right on top of Brotherly kindness when you stand praying for the spirit for charity for Dynamics for the power for the anointing for l oh glory to God forgive oh give the Lord some Praises do you have somebody to forgive forgive them in the heart right now say Lord I forgive that person I release them Oh Glory there's so many people like to hold on to their Arts hold on to the The Grudges and so on they renew it like they renewing the call every year they're going for renewing renewal every year nothing happening nothing changing but they not don't want to let go even Jesus on the cross said father forgive them yes who's them crucify him forgive them for they know not what they do they're clueless they Bing crucifying after feed them with bread and fish after Healing The Sick after raising the dead after casting all Devils after do treating them so good they B crucify him and give us Barabas give Barabbas take Barabas same coming back again you know hallu for God has set in the church apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists all for the perfecting and bringing all these virtues into it for that Perfection of this coming of the Son of God hallu from absolute he's the Dynamics of the mechanics are you ready yes the mechanics of the church what is it Apostles prophets teachers so forth and he is the Dynamics that works that and it's the worked by a certain dynamic in other words you can't put a 9vt battery to start this V8 engine that could start motorbike engine you could that could start some little toy bicycle but this engine this this thing to charge up and to and to start and to leave this world you need the right battery you can't put a Pentecostal battery inside of there or metodist battery you have to get the Dynamics for this day to start this engine amen amen when you turn the keyo all you seen is light because any battery for it oh give the Lord a shout we can't go with lights Oh Glory to God we can't go with fancy lights and they clicking and taking pictures of how your dashboard lighting up the engine have to start we you see the engine have to Tumble okay the Lord I shou in the house go going to raise up some engine tumblers oh Hallelujah to get this thing moving he is the Dynamics that works that what that the mean of the F Ministry so we have to begin to see the Dynamics working that if that man belong to that isn't that right he is the fire that fire off the gas amen now watch mechanics ain't what run the automobile it's the Dynamics that runs it the mechanics don't run the church so we could we could pray we could preach mystery still tell you write books and Mysteries till they could explain it to everybody the mechanics don't run the church it's the Dynamics the holy ghost that gets into this word so I greatly teacher is teaching his place position place you and they place and they place they place you if Dynamics will come into that they still placing you remember long time in a church I was in man was a foundation every three weeks Foundation I said good Lord when this building will come every time the l a foundation and that Foundation me a three hour service l a foundation and I sitting down as a believer but when he build going up how long how long how long how long you L this Foundation the mechanics don't run the church it's the Dynamics the holy ghost that gets into this word it is not a seminary that teaches you all the Theology and the Greek interpretation but it is the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost in there to set that a fire to bring it to pass and to make it live exactly what his promised word for this hour not mechanics the Dynamics it take mechanics and Dynamics the word and the spirit they are the one that gives life oh give the Lord a shout in the house Glory perseverance now he's setting the church objective what he setting the church he set in the church to keep the church in line with the word what question ask Apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists offers of the church I a't seen nowhere where he said that in the church to be popes to be dictators to be man of the hour no he have a purpose behind that to keep the church in line with the word these offic of the church God sent not man called I'm reading yes God sent it have man called you that man p in this message God didn't send for them God didn't send them God didn't put them there I don't even know how to get there but I not my role that my function and I'm not into that God sent not man call God sent listen inspired man to keep the church Lin up not dead intellectual mystery speaking word speaking no inspired men to keep the chch line up what is it question gifts of the Spirit in the church not a bunch of fanaticism but truly gifts of the Spirit in the church that's right keeping the church if a real church was ordained of God really filled with the Holy Spirit if sin would appear in the church it will be another like anas ofall that's the goal that's a template that's the early church that's the original church and we have to get back to that and there's a prophecy we will get back to that make no mistake about it we will get back to that they will know this is not a message church this is a Bible Church oh give the Lord a shout in the house we going back to the book of Acts going back to another Pentecost there must have another Pentecost before there's a book of Acts how can we have a book of Acts and talk about acts we going here going there going there and there's no Pentecost identified it wasn't the acts of the men it was Acts of the Holy Ghost working through these men it wasn't the acts of men it was Acts of the Holy Ghost in Peter in Paul in all these brothers It Go be the acts of the Holy Ghost in you oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah glory to God Amen Hallelujah you know when Jesus preached it wasn't 1% of one million of the people on Earth ever heard him it's the elected that hears it wow and he said no man can come except my father draws him first and all that the father has given me will come that's right now I believe here we go that there's a church coming into that Perfection that Ministry of perfection that's what he call itall not just Ministry Hallelujah that Ministry of perfection where the offices where Pro Apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelist for the Perfection of the church them pastors and teachers will be so with the word until the whole thing will work right up to the coming of the Lord and I believe we are nearing that time now men that not deviating from the word remember the story probably give about two men riding the bike and one man riding close to the mountain and the other fell making sty at the edge he lost the race the other one holding and the man going no arm and thing right he showing his skills they showing the skills they could get Revelation that not in the message and this one holding two hands Old Testament and New Testament he holding the handlebars anding close close this one by the edge see how fall no hand free hand when does God set this 54 Ministry we know it but see it again so this 5-4 ministry is destined for the church is ordained for the body of Christ this this five4 ministry is International Ministry it's not just for a local church it's for the body of Christ and the body of Christ is universal the body of Christ is international now he said when God has set some of the church through their labor pains only not through conventions not through shaking hands through labor pains oh how they get tremendous sometime labor pains who said that God said that not the Min Association pains and argument no labor pains when a church is growing under persecution from the outside world Believing on the Lord Jesus that the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as real to us as it was to Pentecost not no modern Holy Ghost not no you gave by the word and when you believe the word you have the Holy Ghost not that they not what they had in their Pentecost where the Holy Ghost is just as real to us as it was to Pentecost how they grown and cry what they gr for the same Holy Ghost the same pay the same power what Peter had what Paul had what Andrew had that is what you want you're grow in for that yeah gr to be Message Church you're grow for the Bible had in it hang a picture of the cloud and hang a picture of of brother with the light and on message church just hang them two pictures put pictures here that's delber all I have perfect man the picture I want you see yes that is what the Prophet come to introduce he I did not come to build a denomination I came to introduce people what to the Statue of perfect man that they could be a Powerhouse that by these virtues by these promises you become partakers of his divine nature not your soup to yourself his divine nature that to much of religious people in this message they think the spirit but the religious I know what you're talking about you know I just seen that by guess you know I have encountered these people and met these people already you know when a church is grown in under the proecu of world believe in the Lord Jesus that the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as real to us as it was to Pentecost how they grown and cry under labor pins but when they are born Unos born amen into the kingdom of God then the Holy Ghost when then when then a man claimed to be adopted he's a liar this is the word here let him break that first when they are born into the kingdom of God then the Holy Ghost has set in the church some Apostles some prophets some teachers some pastors some evangelists these men are not set by votes they are set by the holy ghost in the church oh give the Lord some Praises then he give to there speaking with tongues interpretation of tongues knowledge wisdom Gifts of healing all kind of Miracles praise God 1 Timothy 519 says against an elder receive not an acquisition but before two or three Witnesses and people loose in the m and see all kind of things the Bible have safeguards the Bible have guard rails for people to told the tongue and the mouth this scripture here is based upon Deuteronomy 19:15 where the Bible says one witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity or for any sin in any sin that he sin it as the mou of two witnesses or at the mou of three Witnesses shall the matter be established and these witness had to be tried because it have a bias against it they would lie without even blinking their eyes so be honorable people somebody say I see him come the bar with a big can like like look like he's drinking next minute man come the car drinking next minute the man break down the get some water to put in the radiator because need some a leak the whole train see he wasn't take a picture not to verify anything so two or three Witnesses did you see him drinking no do you have another witness no did did you check the B man if you went for Booze you see things get loose just like that so here what 1 Timothy 5:19 he amplifi it listen to No acquisition presented before a judge against an elder unless it is confirmed by the testimony of two or three Witnesses what what everybody do that anytime you he somebody raise up and see them against the pastor against elders and whatnot you challenge them and say shut your mou hold the peace I don't want to hear it hey you know what I hear you have two witnesses you before you speak you could confirm that because speaking is seeds in her words are seeds in not just the word of God is a seed you know people M that be are seed you know that's why you don't let the wrong person speak into your life amen somebody could speak a black streak into you know speak negativity and you hold that and you're carrying a baby you know by a word somebody spoken that why people say my mother tell me and my grandmother tell me go grandmother tell you what does God say hallu hallelujah people still not catching in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God not your dream was in the beginning and the dream is God sometimes sat like sometime I wake up in the morning half fall back to sleep and every time I fall back to sleep it's some crazy dream I wake up me I me the craziest dream ever I get I would like to tell you some of them up to this morning I got one some convention and and like they have I'm in one room and I going in the Next Room I said I want my wife to be with me and then next she like she checking on a CER and I don't know have no communication some dreams all I do is to come out just just wake up fall off a cliff I think just almost I listen some come dream and you're huffing and puffing you you think that God I can't bring an experience and say it mean this and it mean this and Lord show me Lord show me nothing the Lord word here is what showing me not my dreams not my feelings not my emotions men shall man sing my bread alone but by every word that proceed out the mouth of God don't live by your dreams don't live by your your feeling and your feeling feeling kill your feeling and take the word of God give the Lord a shout in the house the word is godall I know I know somebody come and tell somebody a dream missing your shoes and that means that and I I have your shoes I have a SHO the p and what not and put all kind of thing on next that person back and go you know they go with the shoes they go on with the dream and the shoes all they want to do is to get a hole upon your life somebody tell it somebody tell somebody do wickedness some something and you're looking and some neighbor and you looking your neighbor and them just doing that for me to come back and get some more money to see some more and God said don't go by don't see a person lying Spirit they see nothing V imagination no weapon [Music] form from tonight forward no weapon form against you shall prosper this is the heritage of the servant of the Lord they Shall Gather but not by me hallah Oh Glory to God and when they gather it going to fail oh Hallelujah Give the Lord a shout I feel the anointing on that no weapon home oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah glory to God this is ministering to me Hallelujah I said my God I want to leave it for Sunday I said Lord Jesus God know what's going to come Sunday I just taken it one day at the time and this was something when I get I said Lord have mercy title where do I go with this but prayed our heavenly father I want to express if I can this morning what my heart I feel towards one the holiest of holy coming down on Earth to redeem a sinner like myself and I'm sure that these ministers that's present now can feel the same way that it was by your grace that we have been made Ministers of this Covenant that thou has given with Adam's Fallen race and we're here this morning Father gathered for no other purpose but to know and to study to know rather the will of God and what we must do to make Christ real to the people of this generation not to parade our beef and ourselves but what we must do to make Christ real to the people of this generation knowing surely that in the day of judgment we will be brought face to face with this generation and being ministers we will be judges so Church upfront this is the position as a Heritage of the Servants of the Lord that they will be judges whether you see me right or you see me K it doesn't matter how you see me that is irrelevant I'm not concerned how you see me you know I'm concerned what God see in me being ministers we will be judges and the people to which we have spoken to and their attitude towards the word that we bring them will determine their Eternal destination this is what God Said an as a fire that came to church and they thought that brother Peter they know who who denied Christ and Peter fell and Peter this and Peter that when they come lying in church they drop down dead because they failed to see the pillar of fire Seated on Peter's heart they fail to understand that that was a different man the outward man was the same but the Inside Man was different and they were dealing with God in a man Hallelujah so Peter didn't say you're light to me you know he say you're light to the Holy Ghost when Paul rebuked the spirit he didn't rebuke the woman you know who follow him with man of God you know he rebuked the spirit he understood it was not the woman Hallelujah he understood he was talking to a demon so when he rebuked the spirit that for fortune telling thing came off of her so the gift of fortune telling was a spirit behind that person that giving them the ability to tell Fortune making the man who hire her a fortune so when Paul get the spirit off of her all the fortune anointing left so them them end up brokes because they Supply get cut and that's how they end up holding Paul and arresting Paul and these men causing trouble in the camp trouble know them money running short the girl can't do what she accustom doing oh give the Lord some PR tonight Hallelujah so do you get it now this Heritage of the Servants of the Lord that God plac them re Sons now re servants to be judges listen to this we know that Paul had the Holy Spirit do you believe that when he was 14 days and nights upon the sea without moon stars it was all dark and he went down into the gallery to pray he came back and told the men be of good courage for the angel of God whose servant I am came to me last night and said fear not Paul is that right not the Holy Spirit the angel of God an angel of God sent from God then he said this here now therefore Angelic beings Hallelujah is ordained ministers of God to come to the Earth to Bear record of God and they work through mortal being so when we talk about ministering Spirit yes God has actually sent ministering Spirit to minister to those who are is of Salvation Hallelujah God has sent a ministering Spirit to minister you so it's not just the man speaking words it's a ministering Spirit Angelic being present to speak to give unction to give inspiration to release the anointing because of who you are it's not about the man it's about you it's for the Perfection of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God see where we at many times people would ask me why would a man like Jesus have to be baptized why would this person be baptized as an act of repentance and confession when he was holy spotless unadulterated son of the Living God why would this person have to be baptized baptism is after confession he had no confession to make because he was God why would he have to be baptized like that unto repentance because he needed no repentance he was infallible God he was in the world the world was made by him the world knew him not why would he have to be baptized and he said before that he said thus it Beth us to fulfill all righteousness in other words it must be fulfilled all the word of God spoken must be fulfill God never speaks until it's ready for it to be and when he speaks it's just as well as already happened the truth of it he was the antitype he was the high priest and before the high priest was could be anointed he had to be washed and in Exodus 29th chapter 4th verse Aaron and his sons Thou shalt bring to the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation and shall wash them with water Thou shalt take the garments and put upon Aaron the coat the robe the ephod the breastplate G him with the Curious G of the ephod and thou shalt put the MIT of upon his head and upon the crown upon the miter thou shall take the anointing oil and pour it upon the head and anoint him Aon the high priest before he could ever be anointed he had to be washed with water therefore when Jesus before he could be anointed as our high priest he was washed with water he was anointed with the Holy Ghost for John bear record seeing the spirit of God descending like a dove upon him saying this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell in so the Bible said Jesus was a Anointed with the Holy Ghost and went about doing good the bride have to be anointed you have to be anointed you have to be wored with the washing of the Water by the word then you get anointed oh give the Lord some Praises tonight hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah let's go before he was anointed he had to fulfill all righteousness he had to be washed with water before the anointing come upon Him Jesus couldn't bypass water baptism oh give the Lord a shout and God had given no shortcuts to this bride God had given the shortcuts to this church you have to come to the way of righteousness you have to come to the way of the word you have to come to the way of Holiness oh give the Lord a shout in the house Hallelujah Highway and a way and the way shall be called the way of Holiness a beautiful type we baptized in Jesus name washing away our sins and then you shall receive the anointing the gift of the Holy Ghost wash first then anointed for service if we are the lights of the day he's telling John this if we are the lights of the day we must fulfill all righteousness all God's word must be fulfilled for us for it becoming of us it's behooving to becoming like us if we are true Witnesses of the day and it's up to us B say hallelujah it's up to us to see that all God's righteousness is fulfilled it's up to us to see that we should make a church that will make a Revival a seven Thunder Revival that people will fly in and say the seven thunders of ran 10 is being manifested oh it's up to us to fulfill all righteousness it's up to us to do signs and wonders and miracles and cast all Devils a short quick message to shake the whole nation is up to us to create a seven Thunder bride Revival oh go expecting it looking for it anointing it claiming it is up to us to fulfill all righteousness if nobody has in a message believe it that is their business I have nothing to do with that there's a sovereign Church oh G we going to have a Revival inside of here oh GL if it's 10 people we going to still have a Revival if it's five if it's one if it's just me a oneman Revival we going to have a Revival inside of here oh give the Lord I shout I feel good tonight Hallelujah glory to God we know what is to be fulfilled you who are spiritual and know the word of God you see what God promis now the word will not come just easy you've got to press your way into it this is the curse that's in the message the meage the spirit of entitlement the feel go sitting on the bottom and everything will just fall upon on the lap and they go home Oh Glory that happening he say you got to press your way into it how

long dress in the bride oh give the Lord some Praises you're having a good time but that intellectual Pastor feeding the word of God feing your own ideas and sprinkle Prophet message and on and and you like the man and you like it so and you like it so said my people like it so you can't feel sorry for them you know what they saw go reap you know they like it so because they're reading the same books you're reading they're hearing the same tips you're hearing something is wrong somewhere the Bible said all of them hear the word from Moses but with many of them it wasn't mixed with fith Oh Glory to God all of them hear from Moses all of them hear from the prophet but there are bride are people who going to have faith to take the word Oh Glory no wonder the prophet say wait till them seven Thunders utter their voices to that group that could take the word and hand it there oh give the Lord a shout hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah well we are taking the word tonight hallelujah praise God hallelujah thank you Jesus [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God the heritage of the Servants of the Lord all right let's continue here now when let was packed away Abraham heart went for him he gathered his own servants and they took their swords and chopped those things down there till not one of them left and that's the type of the Gospel preacher when he see that sin has caught his church and caught the people he take the Blessed old gospel the sword of the spirit and he chops it and chops it until he cuts out Sin from his church if he's a true servant of God but over do know to talk to people you're you teach me how to talk to people we don't know how to talk to people how we supposed to talk to people God bless you is that right yeah that's what I'm saying people free to go to these nice churches and think this is just not one of that you come here for the word not for KFC not for buns after service you come here to get truth to set you free we not lying to you we not dishonest with you we giving you as God give it to us we give it to you I had no idea I we preaching thisday you know but this come to me and I want know what is this about and I understand clearly now no weapon form against a true Son of God born son Phil son going forward no weapon form going to prosper let them come against the church let them come against the ministry Let them fight it you will see what God will do with them glory to God what kind of servant we talking about Hallelujah not just those who went to know but who God sent it have sent and went you know some just went it have some that God sent oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah take the old blessed gospel the sword of the spirit he chops it and chops it until he cuts sin out of the church if he's a true servant of God he removes all the nonsense the tattling the backbiting and brother I go declare war inside of here I long standing church member they go smoke out that shape up or they really shape out in truth cuz we ain't trying to hold nobody inside of here we have never done it we have done it for 40 years we wouldn't do it now you want to go go bye-bye oh praise the name of the Lord you come we say welcome oh praise the name of the Lord and as they go God will send some people back inside here to take the seat long time I used to warn people you know hold on to your seat you know because somebody coming for it oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Give the Lord some Praises God is able to rise up Stones God is able to send prostitutes and drunkers and all kind of people inside of here to make up this bride body going to have but he's going to have a glorious Church in the last days a church without spot without wrinkle we are not preaching in vain we not blasting in vain we not pressing in vain we not pumping in vain it will have fruit may be seated David did not the training Saul had but he know a God that Saul knew nothing about so Saul's position didn't give him access to God David knew God and he was even qualified to be in the Army this young man he said I will go and fight him why he could have took one finger and wrapped it around his waist but he had courage for guess what he knew he was right and when a man knows you're right nothing can move you listen to this a man don't look like Moses did this way and that way a true servant of God never has to look this way or that way he don't care the thr of the enemy or the pleasing applaud of some man he enjoys the Fellowship of the Lord God who sent him if he knows where he is standing he don't care whether his enemies like it or whether his friends smile on him that doesn't make a bit of difference to a true servant of Christ he's got a job to do and you don't have to look and see what do you think about it is this pleasing to you that's a true servant of God are you ready Jesus said he that receives them that I send receives me amen now them that he sent and them that receives me receive him that sent me he says I wish we could have time to linger on that and then he make this statement you can only serve God as you do and believe the servants that God sends you can only serve God on Earth see as God's servants that is sent on Earth by divine inspiration interpret the word to you nothing but the truth Psalms 105 said oh give thanks unto the Lord call upon his name make known his deeds among the People Sing unto him sing Psalms unto him S Talk of his wondrous Works glory be to His holy name let the heart of them rejoice and seek the Lord seek the Lord in his strength seek his face forever more remember His Marvelous work that he has done his wonders and the judgments of his mouth oh you Seed of Abraham his servant each CH of Jacob his chosen he is the Lord Our God his judgments are in all the Earth he had remembered his Covenant forever the word which he commanded to a thousand Generations which Covenant he made with Abraham his oath unto Isaac and confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law and to Israel for an Everlasting Covenant saying unto thee will I give the land of Canaan the lot for inheritance when there were but few men in number yeah very few and strangers in it when they went from one nation to another one Kingdom to another people he suffered no man to do them wrong he reproved Kings for their sake saying touch not my anointed and do my prophets no harm Oh Glory you we come back to all of that yes we come back to all of that God's anointed will be upon the Earth isn't that right eastes 12 said fear God keep his commandment for this is the full duty of man the conclusion of the whole matter is to fear God and you cannot have respects until you have fear you got to have the fear of God Solomon said the fear of the god is the beginning of wisdom that don't mean you're afraid of him but it means that you're given respects and reverence and when you respect God you fear God you fear that he would disle him in some way you fear at least you would do something wrong I fear my mother I fear my wife I fear my church I fear all of God's servants unless I should put a stumbling block somewhere in the way I fear the people I fear the people of the city unless I will do something wrong I would cause them to think that I wasn't a Christian before you can have a respect you've got to have fear and God demands it he demands respect God does he demands it and fear brings it let a man farmer shop worker and nobody pay attention to him let him a job as a police officer police force come down the street he has badge and uniform on watch hello there John how are you see is is a kind of awe a fear a respect because maybe he get elected to the mayor of the city who would President Kennedy be tonight if he wasn't President Kennedy but being he's the president of the United States he deserves respect you see and because God is God he deserves respect that's right you got to respect him and give fear to him and that brings respect God has demanded that for himself and for all of his servants God demands respect for his servants his servants here we go how we know that they are his servants because he vindicates these servants by his word he takes these servants and make them Servants of God and proves that they are servants note I like that word servant as opposed to minister you see anybody can Minister anybody could go could be pulpit and pontificate but to serve is different hallelujah praise God you can't be a message Pope and be a servant you need a throne for that and a crown on your head and and some of them I'm not trying to take off the crown of their head I to fix it but that is what they enjoy they enjoy this crown on their head I'm not trying and my call is not to get crowns over people head I leaving them with a crown on the head he said what watch he takes these servants and make them Servants of God and proves that they are servants by making his word work through them servants he make his word work through them servants then as you respect that servant you respect God so when I respect you and you respect me and we respect each other then respecting God hallelujah so somebody I'm coming somebody say you're coming some say so what so what so Noah he preached B AR God brought judgment upon the them suffers because they would not listen to the message of God come under the Ark of his preaching they wouldn't take God's preparation of Escape watch these words and there's only one thing left Divine judgment you can only do two things either Mercy or judgment you have to accept one or the other and there's where we stand tonight we takes God's mercy or we stand his judgment there's no way getting around it God always makes a way of Escape for those who desire to escape what's left over is to stand the judgment if you can't respect a man respect the office he holds in God respect him if a minister comes up your pastor always respect him not sometimes always respect him I've heard congregations talk about their Pastor just just talk about him run him down ridicule him how is that Pastor ever going to do anything for you he can't do it I don't say this church but I mean churches have seen it you've got to love your pastor you've got to know he's a human being but yet God made him his past his Pastor the Holy Ghost has made him overseer then you've got to respect him in that manner and no matter what the pastor done if you respect him in your heart as God's servant God will respect you for doing it so that's why you have to do what is right and that connects to righteousness Hallelujah you know some people respect bosses respect upper people they wouldn't respect everybody you weos have respect for everybody yes respect this one because it's one money you respect this one because you have two cars or four cars or four houses respect that you respecting class and levels that's how God do things God respect God send his love and he pick us up in our condition he was look at where we State status in life all right this is very strange tonight I forget to put page numbers so I don't know what page let me see all right so now see well 11 or 14 for more pie musicians get ready they bring you to church you see an organization but Christ brought them to the Cross remember the Greek say so we see Jesus and what did Christ do he point them to the Cross that's why I suang that song in the cross Christ will bring you to the Cross where you are crucified with him and his eternal life and your life meet together and your life dies and you take on his eternal life where at the cross so at the cross is where you meet with him your life dies and you take on his eternal life oh my his eternal life and your life meets together your life dies you take on his eternal life and then you are Son of God my he said what a difference from the disciple of old and disciple of today if you mentioned the disciple I would love to know the Lord Jesus well now look we belong to certain Church come down and join us see that's what you hear but Christ himself self pointed the people to his debt and said except a corner weat falls in the Dr and die it abides alone but your life and his life find each other not at the church not in a building not in a Creed not in good works but in the cross where you are crucify with him that is where you find Christ you don't find him by doing better you don't find him by turning a new page you don't find him by starting a new life you don't find Christ you find Christ only in debt not in a Manger not in a confession to believe in certain in Creeds I believe Thunders I believe new name I believe patrio 4 I believe what you can believe whatever you want to believe you're not finding Christ in Creeds you don't find Christ there a true servant takes it to him and he is the word and if Christ is there today a real servant would take you to him Christ and Christ is here in the form of the word and the word brings life because he's the word Christ is the word and he's the word himself a true servant always takes you to the word all right we're almost done Romans 1013 to1 17 say for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved but then how shall they call on whom they have not believed how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard how shall they hear without a preacher how shall they preach except he be sent as it is written how beautiful at the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good things but they have not all obeyed the gospel for Isaiah said Lord who ha relieve our report so then Faith come by hearing and hearing by the word of God so the branches is the one that bear fruit not the vine so we the church is left as branches so your eyes and my eyes here we go is the only eyes that God has on the earth that's big your lips and my lips is his branch and he energizes it to bring forth fruit and our ears is his ears our hands to do good is his hands our feet are his feet to carry us to church and to do good blessed are the feet that bring be in good tidings we as as his Vine he pours his energy into us now there are five gifts that set in the church Apostles prophets teachers evangelist that's the branches that God poures energy into that some of them to preach some of them to evangelize some of them to Pastor teach and here Apostle missionary and so forth isn't that right almost done page 12 almost done we head to 14 you ready Paul said all men left me every one of them left him I say this when a man stands true to the word not just in one meeting but in every meeting when a man stands true to the word the time will come when they will leave him they did it to our Lord they will leave him when he stands for truth all men has forsaken me what do you think that Deus and some of them thought when we all know the scripture Luke was a doctor Paul whenever he went took this doctor with him preaching Divine Healing and leaving his friend sick so poor he had one quat let a man man running out of tongue he could Smite the man blind and they thought he was washed up but he wasn't he was exactly in the bloody Footprints he said old man has forsaken me how I think of that how a servant that to stand true to the word sooner or later just remember people are going to forsake Him always when God's servant stands true to the word all forsake Him when a man stay true no matter how popular he is when he said true to the word the time come when the religious World forsaken him and cut him off every man every saint every Prophet every true servant of God that stayed with the word was forsaken by the ecclesiastical thing and cast down and Paul was one of them almost done musician it is usually at such a time as this when men have stayed true to the word and all men have forsaken him until God steps in his defense of that person and crowns his ministry what a consolation our consolation is built in the promis of God's word how many Christians are in the way tonight in here that are happy that you started a long time ago you done made your start way down along the road still coming down towards the end I pray that God will Crown your ministry whatever it is it may be a housewife I pray that grown will Crown your ministry it may be a preacher it may be a deacon it may be a lay member it may be a farmer I don't know what it is whatever it is may God Crown Your Life with the glory of his word and a second coming Rapture Rapture you and take your away into another land where you'll feel like that little fish I talked about out of the Blackness down there you couldn't go up there with this kind of body neither could you go there like astronauts you have to have be on a pressurized tank pressurized you're going to the Rapture oh my begin going to play something I made it m I made it God I'm finished with this last go is trying to place his church in position to manifest himself getting one that he could work through and say there's my spirit flowing freely there it is I can work here get another one and place him I can place him adoption placing manifesting take him out and put a ceremony in him visit him with an angel tell him something if he told the truth if he's making up something it won't work no no that won't work we had a lot of that I mean manifestation of the sons of God when God manifests himself and he sends him out listen to that when God manifests himself and he sends him out and then he goes forth what he says is the truth what he does is the truth what he does he manifests Christ that's what he what man does how do you judge him by the way he stays with the word let's all [Music] stand here's my heart here my soul He restored my soul make me whole make me whole make me whole please restore my soul make [Music] me Lord yes my [Music] heart
