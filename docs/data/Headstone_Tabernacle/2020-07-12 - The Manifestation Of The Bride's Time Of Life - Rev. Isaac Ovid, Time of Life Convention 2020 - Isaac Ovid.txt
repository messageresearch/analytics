appreciate the season we're living in you appreciate that time we're living in may the Lord which you bless you in the precious name of Jesus Christ so I would hold my greetings after the scripture so if you have your Bibles woody tuned with me to two portions of scripture reading Genesis 1 and verse 1 and reading from Genesis 18 Genesis 1 and for this one and Genesis 18 from verse 10 Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth I will stop right there and reading 18 from this 10 and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the 10 door which was behind him now Abraham and Sarah were all and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of woman therefore Sarah laughed within herself saying after I am waxed all shall I have pleasure my lord being old also and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I of a surety be a child which I'm old is anything too hard for the Lord at time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son my lord a blessing to the reading of his word can we just bow our heads for of Prayer Oh gracious Heavenly Father we thank you Lord to be in a presence we thank you for Lord this virtual convention that you have allowed us to be able to Lord by your grease come together in a unusual way and unprecedented we and Lord - think how you work so perfectly Lord when we father would see what's happening around the world to see yet still you could find a way to connect with your people so Lord may you bless those that are Lord here as bless those that are connected Lord bless those that will hear the tape father may you bless the believers around the world and may you be with us in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen and amen and amen you may be seated in the presence of the Lord so amen we are we are in the convention and I certainly want to greet everyone who is connecting to the meeting and salute all the ministers who are speaking in the virtual convention in this unprecedented time when the enemy thought that he could disrupt the program of God God has a way of putting things around and moving things around and the same way he did it before he's able to do that again amen and one asset needs to loot all the ministers who would speak and those who would bring their greetings and all the specials that would be sung throughout the meeting and have been sung and the technical team and all of the churches and believers around the world the translators who would have made it possible for French and Spanish translation as well and what a time that we are living in that the bride could be united remember the Prophet said one day that God will could move this thing overnight overnight you can move around the world and I believe that's the season that we are living in and we know the theme of this convention is time of life and it's a theme that you would hear through that scripture in Genesis 18 throughout many of the different services so my degrees of God we are looking to see how God would open to us in this service amen so jesus said that I must be about my father's business and when you are running a business you come to understand that you have to separate working in the business and on the business for years there were teachers in business school you have to work in the business and you have to work on the business but now they say that they work is expanded from in the business and on the business to above the business in other words the higher you go the more you see but more than that it takes great skill to be able to work in the business on the business and above the business at the same time but when you look at the economy of God he is able to work in the business on the business and above the business at the same time you'll see where I'm going in a minute so look at Jonah Jonah he is in the business at Jonah's level he is dealing with his personal issues of the consequences of not going to Nineveh he's going through his mind battles he is going through his experience he is going through how he feels and he says throw me off the boat he is looking at it from his eyes only but just above Jonah's experience he doesn't even realize that the Nineveh he is running from their worship of his garden so a bit higher than his understanding is the fact that God already knows what it will take to deliver the people in Nineveh and Jonah doesn't understand that he is part of a bigger plan can the church say man he doesn't realize that his mistakes was counted as part of a bigger plan he is looking at it just for himself but he is part of a bigger picture can the church say man and when you go even higher we see Jesus in Matthew said for as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whales belly so shall the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth so in other words why Chula is in his pity party threw me off the boat in the economy of cord chorus eNOS part of his own story come to church see mmm so I want you to see tonight that you are part of a bigger story you are part of a bigger plan we are part of a bigger plan can the church say Amen so at the same time we could see the same situation addressing different issues so from this evening I want to look at the time of life from another angle this morning I you with me this morning are you ready to ride with me this morning can we go way way way back way back before Abraham can we go there this morning can we go there this evening so in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth we read the scripture that is the entire of Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth that is all it says in Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth he created two realms can the church say man he created two jurisdictions he created two seats of power there's a power over heaven and there's a power over the earth can the church say Amen and in God's plan the power over heaven and the power over the earth are designed to be connected anybody beats with you anybody with me today the power over heaven and the power over the earth are designed to be connected to government in heaven and the government on the earth are designed to be connected everything works when the government in heaven and the government on earth are in order when the government in heaven and the government on the earth are in alignment that is the way court always saw it that is how it unfolded in his plan that's how it unfolded in his mind Kenneth CMM so we know that la la Elohim was a self-existing one we know that he made heaven first we know that he then made angels can the church he mana and after that is when he may be earth with me this morning so we know from job 38 called axe job where was that when I laid the foundation of yet when the morning stars sang together so there was singing going on when the foundations of the earth was being laid anybody with me this morning and the church say man but at some point there was war in heaven we're going somewhere there was war in heaven Satan Lucifer an anointed cherub a beautiful cherub and inspired a cherub a captain among the cherubs he attempted to ascend into heaven Lucifer was lifted up with pride he was pleased with himself he exalted himself above his station he exalted himself larger than he was and his pride led him to say I will be like the Most High can the church say Amen and pride interrupted worship in heaven all along there was worship in heaven and suddenly something began to interrupt this worship because corn is the object of worship are you with me we're building to something pride was the first attack on God the first threat on God because the first doctrine that pride taught was you don't have to worship God you have another option Satan's pride and his lust for power is what led to the war in heaven and sit on Lucifer the devil was kicked out of heaven and we were represented there when we keep the Lucifer out of heaven we were represented there from the church mmm and his fall is captured in Luke 10:18 and he said unto them talk about Jesus I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven no but the Branham said that Satan hits two books in the Bible he hits the book of Genesis and he hits the book of Revelation he hits the book of Revelation because it tells of what's going to happen to him so the book of Revelation is where Satan is finished we know this the church say mmm but the book of Genesis he doesn't like the book of Genesis because there are things in Genesis that bothers the devil can the church say man we're gonna find out what that is this meeting hallelujah so Genesis finds the devil I wanted to see it in perspective now he's a defeated devil he was recently kicked out he's not the devil who's walking around feeling good he is a devil who is walking around after being kicked out of heaven he is not in a good state of mind he is not feeling good about himself he just lost a war that was in heaven he is nothing his wounds he's trying to find himself anybody with me this morning his attempted coup in heaven had just filled anybody with me this morning his grab for power in heaven have failed now I said God made heaven and earth there are two seats of power power in heaven and power on earth so he has grab for power in heaven field there's no attempt he can make to power in heaven there's no way he could get back there the challenge the power of heaven or you don't know you know with me yet I don't think you hear what I'm saying the power in heaven he tried to get it and he filled there's no second chance at his attempt at a coup because he was kicked out he can't just get back there he had oh come on now he's dead welcome there his boxes his clothes everything he had was thrown up with him and those who followed him went with him oh you don't hear me there was no room found for him that's what the Bible said there was no place for him there are you with me we building somewhere so the power in heaven was unchallenged the power in heaven was formalised the angels that remained they stood in solidarity with Michael yes no break in their rank there's no dissension in the camp there's no enemy in heaven the enemy was pushed out of heaven unquote created heaven and the earth so Satan's attempted coup in heaven filled his grab for power in heaven field we are going deeper into why he hates this book of Genesis anybody with me this evening with no access to power in heaven the only power that remained was power nerd anybody with me this morning with no access to the power in heaven the only power that remained was the power on earth can we keep on a little bit we don't know at what point Satan realize it but at some point Satan realize that power authority inheritance of this earth have been given to a being to a being who had been created a little lower than the Angels God was deliberately punishing the devil he taught as a cherub as an archangel who was on the earth now at least the power to be his but he realized that the power that I've been given to a being a little lower than the Angels oh come on now this was adding insult to injury a being called man a being called Adam a perfect man a holy man a sinless man a son of God in his position not an angel somebody please flatter me and I read the chat ascription for this power one more time a perfect man a holy man a sinless man a son of God in his possession not an angel anybody with me this evening come on now get in the spirit see if it has no access to power in heaven and he's trying to make a crap for the only other seat of power this isn't a word now Satan is angry but Satan couldn't get to this man so there was war in heaven then the war stopped because it's only a war if there's a fight going on but he couldn't fight Adam this being was protected this being is anointed this being has dominion this being this authority when this being said Mountain moves the devil couldn't touch it he couldn't interrupt it he could not direct it because this son was in his position somebody preached back to me somebody helped me Satan had no power over this man Seaton could do nothing to this man you know better Branham said you could reason you could live such a life that the devil can't do nothing with you he can't reach you he can't touch you that's the kind of life I'm looking for you may be seated Adam did not have to fight I want you to catch it Adam didn't have to fight Satan was no match for Adam the fight he could have put up in heaven he couldn't bring to the earth when other one is in his position it was not a fight when this man is being little lower than the Angels that blow Lucy for mine that calls it even lower than the Angels and give the book give the book that's from this book he could speak oh come on now when this man's walk mountains have to move when this man spoke he could do whatever you want Satan could not penetrate the world that protected Adam because Adam always stood behind a wood [Applause] Satan was no match for a son in his position and I fear to you test evening Satan is no match for when you get into your position when you're in your position that ever has to back up demons have to back up the devil has to back up when you are in your position Oh hallelujah give the Lord a shout of praise I'm warming up warming up a little bit I'm not gonna be too much longer with you but ride with me but when Eve him he deceived Eve and God allowed this to happen to fulfill his plans of being a redeemer but I've realized that there's a pattern there's a cycle it seems that God was so disturbed by how the devil operated that he keeps repeating this cycle of punishment on the devil on the enemy every time that everything he gets one up core just crush him again we'll talk about it a little bit so when Eve can he deceive Eve whether Branham said Eve stepped out from behind the wood and that mistake led to the fall of man can the church a man and man lost his power man lost his authority man lost the book man lost his life and he lost his inheritance in life man had only known Dominion but now he had the Deaver getting older he had to deal with sickness he had to deal with depression and ultimately he has to deal with death but just when Satan thought he could get the power get the book get the authority that Adam had it slipped temporarily into his hands that's not where Abraham presented it but he was not qualified for the power so he could not hold on to it you see this power could only be held by someone who had the right qualifications this book of power could only be held by somebody who fit the job description it had to be a perfect man a holy man a sinless man a son of God in his position not a knee so can the church say man so the power the book the authority went back into the hands of the original owner the one who wrote the Job Description the one who created the vacancy can the church say man the one who created heaven on the earth because he created a role he created a vacancy he created a job description and all of a sudden there was nobody qualified to fit the seat so the seat became empty and the church say Amen and only then the war broke out again because know that Adam was outside the wood he had a shuttered atom can the church say Amen and the war broke out again can we build a little bit could he take some more so God began to put things in place for the sons of God to kick Satan now out of it there was no need to kick him out of heaven that was already done but the kick him out of earth jurisdiction was given to son's Dominion was given to sons can the church say Amen so he needed to find somebody who would fit the qualifications to reestablish power on it can the church say man there are some things God will do and there's some things he telling its people to do come the church amen so as we read Genesis we see quad mapping out a journey something here something there but he's on a mission remember what I said in the business on the business above the business so he's doing smokescreens they'd never think he figured out what's going on but the devil is totally confused in Genesis 4 mystery of Cain and Abel with India is a mixture of redemption also sacrifice the blood all of that is tied up in there and sit-ins she went Cain killed Abel and he think that's an achievement but God is weaving something through Balotelli read Genesis 5 into 6 he speaks about Enoch a type of the bride go into the rapture just in the midst of what was taking place go out slip in up out right from under the devil hands when the devil thing keep making progress yeah have somebody who is so please God that one day he was not phone and the devil say oh gosh I just lost one can the church say ma'am God is just doing things he's moving here he's touching here he's doing this but he on a journey he's not doing anything by chance he's not doing anything by accident you are not here by chance you are not here by accident you are not in the house you are in by chance you were not in the job you are in by chance you are not in your church by chance you are not in your country by chance you don't speak the language you speak by chance God is putting things around to achieve his purpose can the church say man by Genesis 5 into 6 we know there's no Sun on the earth in a position of power and authority so Satan begins to establish himself until God repented he made man but if all know he found one man who found favor in his sight because quad will always have a witness and just when the devil thought he was establishing his kingdom go up brought the flood and destroyed it all it's a war it's a war going on it's a war to fight for the power it's a war to fight for control it's a for water fight Penda church same in Genesis 17 9 we see Noah and his family there's war but every time the enemy thinks he has the upper hand God is unfolding his plan by the Genesis 10 and look the spirits at work because understand the issue they Wednesdays a connection between the power on earth and heaven that's where the power shatter that connection look at Genesis 10 11 that's with Nimrod and what were they trying to do with the tower they were trying to connect it to heaven anybody with me and God had to confuse their language because he couldn't allow that kind of connection between heaven I can the church say Amen and it is at the end of Genesis 11 we find this man called Abram and his wife Sarai finally what he couldn't do it no or anybody she finds a foundation he could use and he begins to have conversations with Abraham whose name will be changed to Abraham you know it he begin to tell Abraham I'm your shield I'm your reward I'm your defense he beget to encourage Abram aneema gonna talk back to God and see well well if I am I am all this thing how how am I not not not have a child and they begin to go back and forth and God wanted to use a seed of this man Abraham to ease war on the devil Abraham don't understand that he is a piece in a bigger story that God is dealing with this world war that started in heaven that's playing not only kind of should say man so he began to lay all the promises upon Abraham and he begin to place all our promises upon Abram and by Genesis 17 he visits Abraham and the first time he Ramallah it abraham laughs - and God say I'm gonna give you a son and he given the name of his son his name will be called Isaac and then by the time I reach Genesis 18 we know it here come these three men coming up the dust your army to order profit dramatize it it was the hot Sun and Abraham step out and said my lord and lay out the food and he's hospitable and everything we know this but Abraham has a problem we know this sarah has a bigger problem Abraham is all this is as a result of Adams fault well stricken in age abraham is tired he is weary the word stricken means damaged afflicted so when the Bible says well stricken this wasn't chicken dinner properly stricken brought Abraham and Sarah well stricken in age the effects of age had them well damaged well afflicted not just tired and weary and Amidon afflicted but we know it it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of woman so what was being presented to Abraham and Sarah was a kind of impossibility the same where sometimes you think it's impossible for you to make it the CMAs sometime you look at yourself and say listen by feeling so tired I feel so weary and it's but in a long time and you take your car go on so God is speaking to Abraham and Sarah over here in the tent and Sarah couldn't understand how what she was hearing was possible Sarah is operating by the limitations she plays on herself she was operating by the limitation of her thinking because clearly God's thinking on the matter and hers were different and God's thinking on the matter was more truth than Sarah's thinking on the matter Sarah had accepted her condition and I would say there many people who come to church and they accept their condition Sarah accepted this is how I am with today she accepted this is how my story will end she accepted this is my legacy my legacy this is it what you see is what you get she had resigned to accept her position as permanent she did not understand so she laughed within herself now laughing it in yourself is not laughing quietly the issue was not she laughed soft within yourself is deep unbelief is when nobody else know you're ready laughing this is the laughs anything is just too much this is well after hearing worry about this it's just it's an unreasonable kind of laughs that was Sarah there wasn't a laugh based on a joke outside this is her expressing herself and you know what and this is the real reason why Sarah's laugh didn't move god it was not about Sarah it wasn't even about Abraham it was a buddy seed oh you don't hear me tonight it had nothing to do with Abraham it had nothing to do with Sarah it was a body seed God already bypassed serious condition ha thinking I believe he was all about his seed let's look at a last dance show cry weep had nothing to do with it because God wasn't choosing in deceiving that's why Sarah's unbelief couldn't stop the promise because the plan of Cora's bigger than Sarah's doubt and the plan of God in this hour is bigger than your doubt it's bigger than your condition it's bigger than your situation it's bigger than your unbelief God hasn't even moved by how you feeling right now he's interested in the seed that's all he's interested in the seed because there's enmity between the woman seed and that serpent it's the seed and the church heal him and so when Elohim came down himself if he did not come down we couldn't be talking about time--as life this see that he was talking about was too important to leave the chance listen God could do anything he wants to do he is sovereign he gonna let Abraham and Sarah fuguro on me and have a child and his letter unfold but this was too important it was not about their feeling it was not about them he wanted to protect the purpose and plan of the seed if he did not come down there could be no time of life if he did not come down there would be no seed if he did not come down there'll be no more sire if he did not come down there'll be no generation after generation after generation if he did not come down there'll be no bride if he didn't come down there will be no final disruption of the plans of the devil that started in heaven that fell onto the earth so that mission in Genesis 18 was little about Abraham it was little about Sarah but it was a lot of people coming into power it was a people coming into position can the church Oh hallelujah I forgot to give my title it's the manifestation of the bride's time of life can the church see man and my subject the Ministry of the royal seed of Abraham and an inspiration is anything too hard for the Lord man I know you've heard it and I know you will hear it and you'll hear it again and I'm gonna keep hearing it until you catch the revelation because when God had to deal with Sarah he just asked one question is anything too hard for the Lord I'm the one who made heaven I'm the one who made the earth I'm the one who gave life Satan cannot give life Adam was in a position to impart life you know that you can call names from the book so God is say listen I don't care what the situation is there's nothing I cannot solve there's no problem I cannot deal with can the church say man Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah if he did not come down no one would ever be qualified to take the book that visitation and Genesis II team was critical to the entire plan of God the seed of Abraham was too important in the plan of God can the church say man now listen got to do whatever he wants to he could have let them just have a baby but he didn't want what was about to happen to be a surprise to them God came to let them know all things and already and God does things so the devil here sinner I don't think you understand how this war in heaven this God was parted by it you know so when God said it is good it is good it is good back in Genesis 1 he noted every and all of that and still see don't know what happening and in that same time of Genesis 18 we see the introduction of going ante with Sodom and Gomorrah in the same chapter so Satan me a nervous no because he seemed God who dealt with the flood and dealt with the Tower of Babel is coming now to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah but in the midst of that God is dealing with his promise and his promise coming to pass he is dealing with his plan of redemption he is dealing with his whole program of God and he says it's anything too hard for the Lord leave Sarah to hold that and all truly each his times life and appointed time he said at the appointed time I'm gonna return to you so there's time and there's an appointed time and when the appointed time comes nothing could stop it you see when I say is anything to eat so at the appointed time I'm gonna return you gonna have that child nothing gonna stop it your age can't stop it all your feel can't stop it you just keep on walking and watch it unfold one of these days you're gonna meet your appointed time and when you meet your point then there's nothing you can do about it one near your healing there's an appointed time the baptism the Holy Ghost is an appointed time your son has an appointed time your daughter has an appointed time your wife has an appointed time can the church say Amen Oh hallelujah and go to the left that scripture is anything too hard for the Lord you know how many people don't hold on to that Scripture I don't care what the doctor says is anything too hard for the Lord I don't care what your company says it's anything too hard for the Lord I don't care what the situation is in your home is anything too hard for the Lord I could imagine truly Ages when David feeling all low and if you didn't honor maybe just remember to how caught him and visit Abraham and Sarah and how impossible the situation was because the situation was impossible and in that impossible situation that was the comfort that God gave them is anything too hard for the Lord and I can imagine David shaking his head he said well if they could they could make it with that would I make it two how can the Chertsey ran throughout every age people holding on is anything too hard for the Lord we got to do this but is anything too hard for the Lord maybe that wasn't just was hot when he was looking at Jericho is anything too hard for the Lord if that impossible situation that could never be recovered could be recovered is anything too hard for the Lord Oh hallelujah even known to Jeremiah many years later I said our Lord called behold to admit heaven on the earth by great power and stretch out arm and there is nothing too hard for thee can the church say man I say today there's nothing too hard for you there's nothing too hard for God your healing not had your breakthrough not too hard oh come on now that's why the prophesy missing limbs will be restored not too hard for God nothing is too hard for God God say what you think is hard what you think is too hard it's not a problem your gray hair going black that's not too hard for God my in that visitation God in front of the devil try to turn Abraham's age back in front of the devil because the turn see Rose is but you know the thing you think this was a conversation you did the people say by Abraham you looking different you working on what going on everybody's gonna see him again he looking completely young body change you don't think that was talked about you didn't people say what happened to Abram and Sarah can the church say man Oh hallelujah hallelujah and from that time on when God walked away from there and spoke about a time of life the countdown was on to a time of life that would come the cone on his own throat all the ages for a time of life because his cycles in seasons every time there was a move of God it was like it was the spirit was a power of God that was moving I was a cone own can the church say Amen all leading up to what leading up to Jesus Christ coming on the face of the earth every prophet every message every messenger was pointing to a seed Paula says that seats plural is that one seat returned with a royal seed of Abraham we talking about Jesus Christ because he was the one who was the come to re-establish the connection between heaven and earth with a connection between the power candid shirts a man and when Jesus came he slowly began to delegate power you know what I'm saying do you know there's nowhere in the Old Testament you can find a demon being cast out nowhere in the Old Testament you can find a demon being cast on the closest you have is the evil spirit on soul and when David play the harp veterans this food would leave but after a season it would come back again and David had to go on pretty hot again it reminds you of how dare to go and make this sacrifice and after why'd it have to gonna make another sacrifice and another sacrifice because they were just covering up but when Jesus came he started delegate pour he sat up undo everything the devil had tried to do so in so many Luke 10 the Bible said and his 70 returned again with joy seeing Lord even the Devils are subject unto us through thy name and he said unto them I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven look at he contacts away please sir he tied it straight back to Genesis behold I give unto you power because that's what they lost I give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you not withstanding in this which was not so don't just rejoice because of this power because it's a bigger plan than the power rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven in other words you're part of a bigger plan your names are written in heaven and the church amen amen amen amen and Jesus began to rejoice he was so excited about what was unfolding and the Holy Ghost hadn't poured out yet he was so excited by what he was saying and what he was seeing he said in that hour listening the Bible Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said I thank thee O Father Lord of Heaven and it that thou has hid these things from the wise and the prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father for it seemed good in thy sight all things are delivered to me of my father and no man knoweth who the son is but the father and who the father is but the Son and he to whom the son will reveal him and he turned him into heat and he turned him on to his disciples and said privately blessed other eyes which see the things that you see for I tell you that many prophets and Kings have desired to see those things which he see and I've not seen them to hear those things which he hear and have not heard them can the church say man what was Jesus doing he was rebuilding he was reestablishing power and authority that Adam had lost that city was trying to grab so this is why I went in Matthew Jesus asked them who do men say I am and the revelation broke upon who he was and what his ministry was by Matthew 16:19 listen to what Jesus says he said I will give unto thee will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven and the church say man what is Jesus doing he is reestablished in that connection for the first time he was finding people he can have that conversation with oh come on now somebody preached back to me or you don't hear me this evening the keys signify authority I always wonder you know they get people keys to the city the mayor have the key to the city he can open the city but it's symbolic it represents trust it represents Authority so Karma's saying when he saw what you were seeing unfolding you say I'm gonna give you this key because I could see somebody I could trust I can see some like a place Authority - I'm seeing signs of what I wanted to have when I place atom they're kind of chancy man I listen by Matthew 28:18 Jesus came and said unto them saying all power is given unto me this is his resurrection now anybody with me now he said all power is given unto me in heaven and in it so walking among them was one man who was sitting on two seats of power all power in heaven all power in it was in this wrapped up in this royal seat or you don't hear me [Applause] this is what the prophets were waitin for this is what the kings was waiting for this is what Daniel was waitin for oh come on now Oh hallelujah hallelujah and here it was sittin can't figure out what's going on cuz he had never seen anything like this and the Bible said that Jesus himself was made a little lower than the Angels because it had to be a kinsman it had to be somebody like Adam who could go and take a power it couldn't be an angel now go and take the power oh come on now come on now we preach about the secret mission of Jesus that God had to leave glory take on wrap himself in flesh but he had to die as a mere mortal Lord and the angels to allow him to go down in the realm of the devil and take the keys from Satan he did everything Satan had he never had the book but the little power that Satan had over death and hell he took that from the devil he took it from him open the church hey man and what did he do with it he said bride I'm gonna give you this flower because your place is not a rule heaven your place is to rain on the no wonder the Bible says we shall reign on the earth that's a testimony that is what makes Genesis 18 so powerful without the time of life there's no power without the time of life we cannot reign but we can go but that time sin and we thank God because as it wasn't that day so it will be on this day I believe we are at another time of life I believe Messiah is on the earth now I believe he's fixing things around and the power the power that he had he said all I was in God he poured into Christ and all that's in Christ he poured in too fast to do what have nice services for us to shout no for us to finish what was started in heaven oh come on now somebody reach back to me or you don't hear me tonight we have been given a responsibility but it turns off finishing what was started in heaven when Lucifer was kicked out of heaven he fell on to our jurisdiction you don't hear me tonight he didn't fall into the jurisdiction of the Angels he fell into our jurisdiction we have every right to pick a fight we have every right to pick a fight we're not running away we are picking a fight this meeting we are picking a fight this convention because we shall reign on it we can let the devil know we are gonna rain on it every demon every principality every power is on our feet hallelujah not by our might not by our power but not by our strength but by the resurrected presence of the Lord the Son of man was veiled in a son of man for repeat of Genesis 18 in this very hour son of man walk the earth the letter stored is another time coming timer life's another seed coming this time you see like Sarah it'll be in the pride but this bride will not even be like Sarah she will believe every word the world will be in this pride you will have to tell her it's anything too hard for the Lord she knows all things are possible she knows the power that locked up in the Church of the Living God gives a lot of show to praise [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you have to recognize who you are you have to recognize who you are you have to know who you are hallelujah hallelujah have to reckon I better Branham said what he said he said the moment the brackets and all she is then the wrap is gonna go so the problem is not who the devil is who the world is the problem is the pride is the only one who doesn't know who she is but one day she's gonna know who she is she gonna wake up one day like Abraham woke up one day and he was used to looking in the mirror maybe you were to shave and he said wait a minute when he gray hair gone with Sarah Sarah come see this but witness Sarah oh you're looking so oh come on now come on now what what was it what was it dynamics dynamics listen Sarah was trying to understand the mechanics how this thing how this thing buddy buddy prophets say you don't need to know the mechanics yes in know the dynamics the changes coming the power is coming you're gonna walk you're gonna speak you're gonna talk you're gonna live and you're gonna see the Spirit of God yes what did offer you kind of church salmon could you take some more the manifestation of the bride's time of life what for not for more church but for us to destroy the works of the enemy and we're gonna really hood and leave this place just like enough it's all in Genesis that seed book the devil hits it because it's in the other Raptors in their power is in their body changes in their resurrection power is in their transformation of young to alter young it's all in there hallelujah glory to God hallelujah and that seed world is alive in our hearts today oh my my my my mind Galatians 3:16 he has poured now to Abraham and his seed were the promises meet he saith not and to seeds plural as of many but as of one to thy seed which is Christ can the church say Amen I'm almost finished in the message crisis she'll go review but Iran said no court had a purpose and a hidden mystery and that's what I want to speak unto the church this morning the hidden mystery of God that he had in his mind before the will ever began and how would that it's unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living in then you will understand clearly then I believe what is being done and here the Prophet in question answers before there was a world so but a banner goes before there was even a world you were in courts thoughts to give you the Holy Ghost so Abraham was living out a plan that he didn't even know when he was leaving his house what he was going to do but God already saw it all so brother Branham could say now before there was a world you were in court starts to give you the Holy Ghost because he know you've been wanting it he chose you himself because you desired he chose you in Christ before you or Jesus any of us on the earth and he sent Jesus to die to prepare a way to send the Holy Ghost to bring you to himself oh this is the church so I'm at home now see oh this is so rich to me to think it's not what I wanted so it's not what Sarah wanted it wasn't my desires it wasn't my will it wasn't my choosing I had not one thing to do with it but before the world ever started God's sauce and put our name in the Lamb's Book of Life before there ever was a world can the church see a man in a message this day the Scriptures fulfill now but in this day there is to come a super royal seed of Abraham he's from what Noah cannot read semen this is 1965 are you ready we're almost done but now in this day there is to come a super royal seed of Abraham that's exactly what I'd be what it'd be would be a royal bride to the royal promised son who is he talking about and I spoke last night it wouldn't be a natural seed it'll be a spiritual seed there is to be a spiritual bride raised up which will be the royal seed of the royal feet of abraham's royal son can I say that one more time it'll be the royal seed of the royal feet of Abraham royal son so he's in this bride wouldn't be by her own feet it will be the royal seed adulting you catchiness will be the royal seed of the royal feet of abraham's royal son let me see it another way it means the feet of this royal son who is what were produced his bride so it's not even your this is y zero colossal get a blessing because it was not based on Sierra's feet the fear that was required to move this power was not trusted at Sara's level so he feared to produce this bride is not a bride having fear to be bride alone is Jesus having faith that he chose you right lady it's Jesus having faith that he chose the best people for such a time as this he has so much faith in his foreknowledge he has so much faith in his election he has so much sweet and predestination he knows his bride will never fail you know this bride will comfort you know this bridal come to maturity listen to the Prophet there is to be a spiritual bride raised up which will be the royal seed of the royal feet of abraham's royal seed she is to come on the scene in the last days and the time and the place is a promise that's given to her so there's a time and a place there's a time and a season this hour there's a location this is already mapped out but the Branham is speaking he's seeing it and he's telling you what he's seeing that your appointment had already been written when Santa man left and walked away from Abraham and Sarah he said I will return unto you and the calm down started and nothing could stop the condom and when this prophet left all these promises to us he hid the countdown he left the scene knowing fully well that every word he spoke was gonna find good ground that every word he spoke that's why the Prophet said you don't find this message this message found you can the church say Amen but the Branham goes on according to Malachi for a scripture there is to rise a message that will shake the hearts of the people right back to the apostolate fathers again hallelujah so friends but aberrant income for us to have books and tips and CDs and mp3s and tablets and have it on software these books and tips was a means to hold a life until you came along a bridge has to be me the connection have to be made this word is not gonna remain in the form of books and tears forever this message is a life this gospel we preach is not in word only but it is in power and demonstration this message is a manifestation and that is why we could have a manifestation of the bright time of life because in that season every seed has to come to life in that season every promise has to come to pass in that season every word spoken about the bride has to be fulfilled in fact God Jesus would say heaven and earth will pass away this wood is actually higher than heaven on earth so you have more confidence in this Word of God not even in heaven on earth God is willing to see heaven and earth will pass away but not this wood not this promise not the prophecy over your life somebody somewhere someday is gonna manifest Malachi fours message the word like the mystery can only remain in Word form force even for Caesar but just wait I'm going to visit you just wait I'm gonna return them to you hallelu it's not manageable over there it's not man but the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost the dynamics the presence of God the power gorgeous wait I'm gonna visit you just wait until those seven thunders uttered their voices just wait I'm gonna return unto you I singular personal pronoun I'm not sending somebody else just wait he promised a revival he promised there'll be a visitation and we are gonna have it hallelujah that's why L owe him a son of man revealed in the profit that seemed missing limbs will be restored why because out of nothing he could create anything and we saw signs of it before the doctors hand touches my wife the tumor will go down let there be squirrels he said when Jesus even was here he made took bread from bread fish from fish but this profit let there be scars since I had your eye what what are you looking for you want to tell me some of your boys you have it and we read the quote those boys fell under the power of the Holy Ghost what was it a reconnection of the power on earth on power in heaven whatever you bind on earth is bound in heaven whatever you loose on earth is loosed in heaven hallelujah so if you are loosed this morning loose this evening from your sickness is loosed in heaven if you are loosed this morning of your doubt is loosed in heaven if your child is loosed this morning they are loosed in heaven the devil cannot hold him any more come the church simmer what are you looking for preacher a mighty visitation hallelujah any time God has to do something he has to find somebody any time he wants to reveal himself his nature his being his attributes he must find somebody I tangle he found you I tangora found us i tangora we are called for such a time as this and our names are written in the book brides time my life I'm getting ready to close out now now notice in that day on Calvary but Abraham said now notice the greater woods was to have the power in the church the CFE now not only to heal the sick by prayer cast out Devils by prayer but to impart eternal life to believers that is what we are fighting for this life eternal night in this season this is what we're looking for the Holy Ghost was coming and given into the hands of the church to impact life oh that's what Calvary meant it took stooped the greater men and women and lifted them it up please to be sons and daughters of God to heal the sick and to impart eternal life by giving the Holy Ghost to obedient believers men who were once unbelievers be made believers and impart spiritual eternal life how much greater is it this sick woman lay in here but around us we can I could pray a prayer of faith and she'll be healed that's a great thing that's what he was doing then but said greater than this shall you do I'm gonna give you power this is your prophecy I'm gonna give you power not only to raise him up for a while but to give him eternal life which will be eternal forever you hear this friends the power has come and his bride is not just up here sick he said I'm going to give you power not all the reason off for a while but to get eternal life which will be eternal forever poor blind wretched people how do you miss that don't you see what a greater thing is that's the greatest thing could ever happen was to impart internal life to people what is he turn alive deny that he lived the lighter was in him impart that to others kind of man do that a son of God can Jesus said whosoever since you admit to them they are emitted who serve a century teen to them they are 18 no that's what the reason the day but Abraham said we're looking for that season are you looking for that season now the bride has not a revival yet there's been no revival there no manifestation of God that stood a bride yet see we're looking for it it will take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up again he was send it he promised it it is a rising of the Sun he sit has been churches churches Brides bright churches Brides rise but it's got to come one hallelujah there has to come a real bride there must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the dynamics of it makes that church live move in the power of his resurrection and in the fourth seal you know it we tell them seven thunders uttered their voices to that group who could really take the Word of God and hand it here in a slice and cut and they can close the heavens they can shut this or do that whatever they want what is it it's power back into adopted sons power back into play sons Sons once again in their position of power in the time of life before the fullness of time when time is finished the musician can get ready friends we know we are blending from time into eternity so this time of life has to be for to be before the fullness of time because when the fullness of time has come then time is no more you call that right one of these days time will be finished no time left no time to do anything left so we are talking about a season a time of life before the fullness of time but a Branham in the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and earthy bride said and when the fullness of time has come that's when time has been fulfilled when there's no more time then you go into eternity after the seven eight is over and it is looters it is over Methodist ages over Pentecostal it is over and now you go into what eternity no more sevens no more threes no more other there in eternity where there is no such thing as numbers and things Amen after time has been fulfilled all sin is gone taken away at the Millennium at the great white throne judgment a type at Holy Ghost after the world and fire and baptize its baptism of the holy fire for heaven all sin is gone all germs is gone all devils is gone all temptations is gone or evil is gone then what does go do we can sit upon the earth see because all sin is gone and that's the same thing he does when he gives you the Holy Ghost baptism and fire he can come and dwell with you and we can sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus because we are already in him not we will be we are now sitting in Christ Jesus how do we get into it by one Holy Ghost baptism by one Spirit we were all baptized into Christ which we are now won't be in Christ we are he is the great spiritual king over the spirit that's in us because we were in him after beginning can the church say Amen give the Lord a shout of praise the fullness of time has come after time has been fulfilled sin is gone after the world's baptism after the world's baptism makes it a fit please no sickness no germs no thorns no thistles no death no sorrow no heartaches no old age nothing to represent death nothing wrong alright nothing natural eternal friends you can be gonna play something softly before the fullness of time before time is complete and we blend into eternity there has to be a time of life and in that time of life it's a space of grace friends in that time of life is a season of restoration a season of deliverance I'm closing out and I'll see this I look back at Sampson because I believe that we're looking for another time in other words once more Lord you did it before you can do it again you heal before you can heal again you deliver before you can deliver again [Music] listen to Samson he knew that his present back slit condition could never meet the challenge of an hour yet he was just as much man as he ever was in his muscles his frame was as big as it ever was he was just as big a muscle and ever could raise up an army but had we got better churches better buildings and everything but where's our strength spiritually speaking he said Samson knew that his back sitting condition could not meet the challenge of that hour and soon as a church nowhere now we can't do it under this condition can the church say man Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and Samson saw a possibility we know it and I want you to see a possibility that in this season in this time of life season there's a possibility that you can be delivered there's a possibility that your son could be restored there's a real possibility because there's nothing too hard for God and what you know hold on to that promise and while he thought the Philistines have not noticed him while his little boy Lee had untied his hands walk back he said lay my hands upon the post here's a possibility I wish the church could see that there's a possibility of a real revival what did he do he raised up his sockets he had no eyes towards God you never noticed the moving of his lips as he was sincerely confessing we don't just need a little Lord forgive me we need a sincere cleaning up they never noticed the tears running down from them sockets where he once had eyes they never noticed the moving of his lips his eyes briny tears streaming down from the sockets he wanted God to make his word once more vindicated to prove Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever once more he thought it would happen not a new denomination not a new sectarian but a vindicated word from you God I know you are still I am blind I've got off the track I'm not world to live let me die with this enemy you raised me up to destroy it and I failed you Lord but there's a possibility you'd hear me once more Lord once more in debt illness he prayed he knowed what was coming Lord Justice once more once more let me see Jesus Christ as he was yesterday when he prayed that prayer and the tears rolling from his cheeks with deep sincerity of confession that's what the church needs in this season of grace friends friends many will miss it many will miss it because in this team message is judgment judgment over Sodom judgment in tennis is eating the same thing shall I hide from Abraham what am I posed to do the same time he's hanging on our child is the same time I'm gonna judge this world [Music] hallelujah that's what the church needs confess your own don't care what dr. Jones says or what anybody else says if you're out of the word of God confess it that you're on once more Lord once more once more Lord once more avenge my blindness upon these denominations and give me strength Lord to shake these denominational world with your vindication give me strength Lord once more prove it he knew what was gonna happen if his prayer was answered do you know this evening what will happen if your prayer gets Hansard he knew dead in his crying once more Lord and while he was praying making his honest confession every fiber in his body began to vibrate Oh God if the body of Jesus Christ could stand as one and every fiber you send to your feet and every member begin to vibrate with a literal baptism of the Holy Ghost again not with new members and shaking hands and some creed and as a strength begin to move into those big muscles every fiber began to twist he began to feel himself again and twisted and when he did the big wall fell all we need today is to see those denominational walls fall is to get real deep sincere or Pentecost and to oppose repent and cry O Lord God once more you had better destroy your enemy before your enemy destroy you that's right bring back the old fashioned primitives the real godly repentance the all-night altar service or Pentecost hear me leave this corruption that Jezebel has worked among you leave it leave it quickly
