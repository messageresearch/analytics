principle that recovers human existence ego in genesis with the ocean nor seek god it's a lot of the habits to see that principle everywhere he lost a principle to a call a son into action seriously let's happy light yellow and that was like a joke in Nigeria yeah that's it would be your Widow we don't have light in Nigeria no Paula community via some of my funny talk to believe it if you see like one ball we were so blessed and there's a job that says that any black even God members you how do you want development here come on my gosh that anyone said so how does Nigeria Manu do you have anything is no light love with a party ba-gawk-oh do nothing hardly juniper here fairly said Justin still ends there be like anyway so anyway the to transfer so God did you when it came down don't let this because she's a lot of the harvest you were limited to no more honey planted a synthesis let the earth be cooler brings forth to reproach so the seed who can world who is the original see in a civil suit planted desires in the trust of the ground the papal share into season Alice's into 1000 every see super sort of its kind slipper to distress is wrought for fruit every fruit seed very simple same and I can be planted against the most a man so you see right there super useful a great husband man good a lot of a hybrid riding Genesis the principles that coffin Lee have hallelujah hallelujah glory to God you are as usual because a lot of average only need to go to him fully understand the paper is Harris as you see the number see some origins [Music] so fully honest and we understand their origin is in the harvest dude up once we have got to go to the Lord of the harvest Holly to let us honest anybody origin what it represents it Kelly please don't worry me see you don't think I look because jesus said species diversity I'm one since the end of the world in our faith wounds amen I mean now this means many things so that people of amen a spiritual eye to look at the Word of God they can be a parolee length the breath DUSU flu they'll they hide loose oof now what the depth of a life to get a bird's-eye view of Wow a few of the word of God holiday to to another word Penelope like a Seventh Seal except sue that shoots I won't stab more from that one stab goes on another factor computer 12 from each that goes and the five pieces it is split seconds time is she was said you have covered all my stairs ooh that's the power of a single passenger silly to you that's a power set up whistle or the scripture the liquid to when Jesus said here since you're the harvest is the end of one so setup of the world how people that means many things sum total of it is this to the harvest is the end of one so cellophane of course Jesus was speaking she super lay about the great average to pilot the end of the age but how you can or even know mokuba's cook with so dope listen that is the principle completely Polly thanks about people from Genesis all the way to Revelation from way back in eternity Jesus was speaking she pilot the harvest is the end of the world wasn't enough anymore but here's the point here Memphis to the point was principal the principal of the high branch do no more so is that the harvest is the end one song along from the coin it has an end to this automatically follows Masuda it has a beginning much cuba solution so the principle here see the prints it isn't as the beginning like como Sumer and an end so everything in this wall here below such shows she said prepare in other words put the harvest number says the end of the world in a fateful they can also be translated to mean so that poses the harvest to Nebojsa is the end elephant of everything in this world the touch so she she Saturday they harvest the most so represents the present end feel anything you beginning this is the average that's how they harvest but super passes influence is say in every single area of your life to position that's why they have a swell up what does it say in every single day of your life suta parties whether you realize it or not hopefully really do and you are writing your story if you are writing your harvest stories they keep it but this working on what's one little action Oh hallelujah amen and is this very simple principle is a principle that there's a beginning you know come on Sue got an end to everything in this wall shows no subbu is this principal the princ amix the harvest he preaches origins goodies concepts or constraints practice that's what makes it the story of us what is the key because every single day but still shut Jewish that's something to do physical in something it's not and the shoes is the big one is coming the final harvest is coming off you are super rotten you have a story to call it Oh every single one of you every man every woman every boy so every girl so as you get to that age of accountability right is your have a story whose one at a time so to sum one little step at a time every single day such as you are writing your stories 108 for every day such is one little step for a man one giant leap for your for your whole life story put these two are the end of the day at the end of the age fellas we're gonna find out loser on how you wrote your story hope I wrote your have a story put this poor hallelujah hallelujah they have a story this simply means every time Chuck form anything such shows any process position is a such many activities any system such as anything at all who is this water that has a beginning has an end because they have as an end slow see your results see your reward growth when I'm or takes away from growth what I excellence you know what the creases you know hallelujah so anything has a beginning has an end it represents to you means so keep your mind don't you keep your mind clear now what the police were keeping a mind to everyday because the story of released these lovely stories of the gospel of Jesus Chris this greatest story ever told this workshop is not just for the end of the road that's what Jesus told and of course it's legit yourself don't say some those healthy habits on the road don't see a touchdown in here so this right now is going on right you have a story single minute of every single day shoo shoo Oh hallelujah I feel like hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and this principle is simply C and this principle is many governs our lives your natural life spiritual life because remember all your existence on this Israel couch is my god help your neighbor as yourself that's your whole life are you gonna work put the bow you go to these that you marry your children Puscifer go to the best schools business there's sum total of your whole existence suits but this is the love God love your neighbor as yourself because on these two Commandments the law and the prophets Allah proof every law circle the law of Moses the law of Abraham know what the law business law of gravity every law hangs upon this to love God so to Suseela make sure your neighbor before as your self but because there's no way the world if I pull of gravity lets you look in your heart away you're tired you can move Amazo yours no that's a long superior of gravity even when you're tired because the love of God is in your hands raise up your hands I've been fighting more gravity on these two Commandments the law the prophets in a proof or hallelujah whoo hurry Oh hallelujah hallelujah I went somebody else what you're so bad you can't kill cases you can show the wounds Paul say are hot that they have cost you because you love God has to be said me too as they're not walking in there in love vengeance one a lot to retaliate to earlier to a lot to keep your distance you a lot to watch another law be able to uh that controls every other tutors long God in your soul to the system of God the second is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbor the second law that the law vengeance of yours the same brotherly kindness so these two laws that's another one love God your neighbor he but for the supersede every all the law Oh hallelujah glory and when these principles of the - our lives naturalize spiritually speedy ready to God work with grad school in business everywhere whatever your profession coca-cola is taking care of how we apply these laws to do so because from the habit of the club was a man like Isaac spoke last night not to say coma is complete in determining how and where we are going to end up home at the final harvest but what's that Jesus spoke about rose and the Reaper three people my receipt of God such simple scooters you know gather them to is banner don't submit non the tears it's gonna be so don't be prong it's a little dash of the weeping hallelujah hallelujah glory you are
