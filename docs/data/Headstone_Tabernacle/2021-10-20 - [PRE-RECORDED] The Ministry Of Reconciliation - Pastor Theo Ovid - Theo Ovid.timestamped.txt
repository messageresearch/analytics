[16:27] you musician uh
[16:30] we want to go into the word
[16:32] and one two two portion scripture from
[16:36] ephesians two
[16:38] and second corinthians chapter five
[16:41] i think i'll do something a little
[16:42] different this morning we will read it
[16:44] together
[16:46] which is uh ephesians two and i will
[16:48] read second corinthians chapter 5. let's
[16:51] read ephesians 2 we're going to read the
[16:53] whole chapter
[16:55] ephesians 2 reading from verse 1.
[17:01] and then we'll turn over to second
[17:02] corinthians 5 was 14
[17:05] to 21.
[17:06] ephesians 2.
[17:09] you have it
[17:10] amen together 3 4 and you
[17:14] had he quickened
[17:15] who were dead in trespasses and sins
[17:19] wherein in time paths he walked
[17:21] according to the course of this world
[17:24] according to the prince of the power of
[17:26] the air
[17:27] the spirit that now worketh in the
[17:30] children of disobedience
[17:32] among whom also
[17:34] we all had our conversation in times
[17:36] past
[17:37] in the lusts of our flesh
[17:40] fulfilling the desires of the flesh and
[17:43] of the mind and were by nature the
[17:46] children of wrath even as others
[17:49] but god
[17:50] who is rich in mercy
[17:52] for his great love where it he had loved
[17:56] us
[17:56] even when we were dead in sins had
[18:00] quickened us together with christ by
[18:03] grace he has saved
[18:05] and had raised us up together
[18:08] and made us sit together in heavenly
[18:11] places
[18:12] in christ jesus
[18:14] that in the ages to come
[18:16] he might show
[18:18] the exceeding riches of his grace
[18:21] in his kindness towards us through
[18:23] christ jesus
[18:24] for by grace are ye saved through faith
[18:27] and not of yourselves
[18:29] it is a gift of god
[18:32] not of works
[18:33] least any man should boast
[18:36] for we are his workmanship
[18:38] created in christ jesus unto good works
[18:41] which god had before or deen
[18:44] that we should walk in them
[18:47] wherefore remember
[18:48] that he been in times past gentiles in
[18:51] the flesh
[18:52] who were called uncircumcision
[18:55] by ditch that which is called the
[18:57] circumcision in the flesh made by hands
[19:00] that at that time you were without
[19:03] christ
[19:04] being aliens from the commonwealth of
[19:06] israel
[19:07] and strangers from the covenants of
[19:09] promise
[19:10] having no hope and without god in the
[19:13] world
[19:14] but now in christ jesus
[19:17] you who sometimes were far off
[19:21] are made nigh
[19:22] by the blood of christ
[19:24] for he is our peace
[19:26] who had made both one
[19:29] and had broken down the middle wall of
[19:31] partition between us
[19:33] having abolished in his flesh the enmity
[19:36] even the law of commandments contained
[19:39] in the ordinances
[19:41] for to make in himself of twain one new
[19:44] man so making peace
[19:47] and that he might reconcile both unto
[19:50] god
[19:51] in one body by the cross
[19:53] having slain the enmity thereby
[19:56] and came and preached peace to you which
[19:59] were far off unto them which were nigh
[20:02] for through him we both have access by
[20:05] one spirit unto the father
[20:08] now therefore you are no more strangers
[20:12] and foreigners but fellow citizens with
[20:16] the saints and of the household of god
[20:19] and are built upon the foundation of the
[20:22] apostles and prophets
[20:24] jesus christ himself being the chief
[20:28] cornerstone
[20:29] in whom
[20:30] all the building
[20:32] fitly framed together
[20:34] grow it unto unholy temple in the lord
[20:37] in whom he also build it together for an
[20:41] habitation of god
[20:43] through the spirit and i will read the
[20:46] next scripture from second corinthians 5
[20:49] 14 to 21
[20:50] and it reads thus
[20:52] now he that had wrought us for the
[20:54] self-same thing
[20:56] is god
[20:57] who had given us the earnest of the
[21:00] spirit
[21:01] therefore
[21:20] okay we just stop right there let's bow
[21:22] our heads for prayer almighty god we
[21:24] thank you for divine love and presence
[21:27] may you send on your spirit upon your
[21:29] people tonight and confirm a word with
[21:31] signs one is and miracles we ask in
[21:33] jesus name amen you may be seated oh
[21:36] praise the name of the lord
[21:38] hallelujah
[21:40] hallelujah oh hallelujah
[21:43] hallelujah praise god
[21:46] blessed be the name of the lord
[21:49] hallelujah just give him some praises
[21:51] here
[21:58] precious
[22:27] yes
[22:41] [Applause]
[22:45] yes
[22:53] [Applause]
[22:56] turn your bibles to
[22:58] second corinthians chapter five
[23:03] i know what happened something was
[23:04] strange
[23:05] i was reading from verse four something
[23:07] there but it's four fourteen
[23:10] so that's the goat of the first fourteen
[23:11] of of you could choose obviously
[23:14] ii corinthians five verse fourteen for
[23:16] the love of christ constrained us
[23:18] because we just judged that if one died
[23:20] for all then were all dead
[23:24] and that he died for all that they which
[23:26] live should henceforth here we go live
[23:29] unto themselves not live unto themselves
[23:32] but unto him that died for them
[23:34] and rose again
[23:36] wherefore henceforth know we know man
[23:39] after the flesh ye
[23:41] though we have known christ after the
[23:43] flesh yet now henceforth know him no
[23:45] more
[23:47] therefore if any man be in christ he's a
[23:50] new creature
[23:51] all things are passed away behold all
[23:54] things have become new and all things
[23:56] are of god who would reconcile us to
[23:58] himself by jesus christ and had given to
[24:01] us
[24:02] the ministry
[24:04] of reconciliation
[24:07] to wit
[24:08] that god was in christ
[24:10] reconciling the world unto himself
[24:13] not imputing their trespasses unto them
[24:17] and have committed unto us the word
[24:21] of reconciliation
[24:23] now then we are ambassadors for christ
[24:26] as though god did beseech you by us we
[24:30] pray you in christ's head
[24:32] be reconciled to god
[24:34] for he have made him to be sin for us
[24:37] who knew no sin that we might be made
[24:40] the righteousness of god in him now we
[24:43] can give god a shout of praise
[24:48] [Applause]
[24:52] hallelujah
[24:53] blessed be the name
[24:56] of the lord oh it's so good to be here
[24:59] have a title
[25:00] the ministry of reconciliation
[25:04] of a subject
[25:06] fitly framed together
[25:08] for the habitation of god
[25:11] by the
[25:13] have spirit
[25:13] inspiration
[25:15] it's a big one
[25:16] to broadly kindness
[25:18] at charity
[25:21] glory that's a huge one
[25:25] oh praise
[25:26] god first peter 4 8 says above all

[25:44] that is charity that you could feel it
[25:46] you could see it
[25:47] you could touch it you could know it
[25:50] there's not a smile like you're trying
[25:52] to force a smile this is charity
[25:55] five and charity
[25:57] this is the love of god express
[25:59] this is the love of god manifest this is

[26:11] hallelujah what kind of sin is going to
[26:12] be wrong but with the only charity
[26:15] will be covering the sins
[26:17] oh do you believe that
[26:19] hallelujah

[36:28] colossians 1
[36:29] you see the people in the message don't
[36:30] know the bible
[36:34] they know a lot more about them
[36:38] but god told daniel
[36:41] to seal division and prophecy
[36:46] that's two different things
[36:48] because you have the message
[36:51] they have topics
[36:53] and seed
[36:54] pope
[36:55] rome what that's topics
[36:57] that's a prophecy to unveil and so on
[37:00] but there has to have a vision
[37:02] a vision put it all together that you
[37:04] could see
[37:06] where you come from
[37:07] you could see
[37:09] where you are
[37:10] and you can see where you're going
[37:12] and when you know where you come from

[37:31] when elisha got the taste of that mantle
[37:34] he felt something
[37:36] he caught a vision
[37:38] he's a young man
[37:39] elijah was an old man he's going home
[37:42] god told him to pull out that young man
[37:45] drop the mantle and pull it off and this
[37:48] is what god does he put the anointing
[37:50] upon you and pull it off for you to go
[37:54] through the process for you to go
[37:56] through the wilderness
[37:58] foreign because character
[38:01] is not a gift character is a victory
[38:05] and god wanted that victory that he
[38:08] could shout this morning
[38:10] [Applause]
[38:16] are you with me you see when you slap up

[59:46] [Applause]
[59:56] and you that was sometimes alienated
[59:58] enemies in your mind by wicked works yet
[1:00:00] now had he reconciled in the body of
[1:00:02] flesh to death to present you holy
[1:00:04] and unblameable and unreprovable in his
[1:00:07] sight
[1:00:08] if
[1:00:09] you continue wounded and settled and be
[1:00:12] not moved away from the hope of the
[1:00:14] gospel which you have heard
[1:00:16] and we just preached to every creature
[1:00:17] which is under heaven or of i paul i
[1:00:19] mean a minister
[1:00:21] and this
[1:00:22] he will do providing that you continue
[1:00:24] to stay with and in the faith in christ
[1:00:26] well grounded and so on
[1:00:29] oh hallelujah
[1:00:31] from paradox
[1:00:33] he said abraham election isaac calling
[1:00:35] jacob grace
[1:00:36] to the perfection
[1:00:38] nothing against him
[1:00:41] that was god
[1:00:43] working its way
[1:00:44] out
[1:00:47] so god put a seed in you
[1:00:49] [Music]
[1:00:51] his seed
[1:00:53] in you
[1:00:55] and he began to work his way out
[1:00:58] he put a seed in your soul
[1:01:00] the devil can't go there
[1:01:02] he could mess with the spirit
[1:01:05] send you mad
[1:01:06] but he can't mess with the soul
[1:01:09] did you hear that
[1:01:13] so somebody could be mental or whatever
[1:01:14] you saw that in the spiritual the mind
[1:01:16] and all kind of thing go and have nuts
[1:01:18] but he can't touch what's in your soul
[1:01:21] but once that seed inside that soul
[1:01:23] begin to press push
[1:01:24] when you come to church you get to feed
[1:01:26] that seed
[1:01:27] that's he's crying for more water
[1:01:30] that's he's crying for the world you see
[1:01:32] you're going somewhere you need to be
[1:01:34] empowered you need to be equipped and he
[1:01:37] know what his wife have need of
[1:01:39] come on say amen somebody
[1:01:42] so when jesus come on the scene he come
[1:01:43] to minister to meet your needs start to

[1:01:48] minister and meet your needs
[1:01:55] holy hallelujah
[1:01:57] nobody burn them
[1:01:59] four death messengers
[1:02:01] kill the tree
[1:02:03] isn't that right palmer
[1:02:05] lucas conqueror and caterpillar
[1:02:08] four
[1:02:09] messengers of roman devils kill that
[1:02:11] tree
[1:02:12] but god promised to restore
[1:02:15] one of those guys took the fruit
[1:02:17] one took the leaves
[1:02:19] one took the back
[1:02:21] the last one took the life
[1:02:25] kill the tree
[1:02:26] but he couldn't kill the roots
[1:02:29] [Applause]
[1:02:32] god put some hidden stuff
[1:02:35] in the roots
[1:02:36] and god said i will restore
[1:02:39] because when god put something in you
[1:02:42] deep down
[1:02:43] in the roots you see you see a big
[1:02:45] strong tree that big strong tree have
[1:02:47] some deep roots
[1:02:49] that you can't see
[1:02:50] what you can see is what make that tree
[1:02:52] what it is
[1:02:54] oh hallelujah when you see somebody
[1:02:56] standing in god it has some deep roots
[1:02:59] that the child's gonna
[1:03:01] but it can't shake you off
[1:03:04] your tree on the rock
[1:03:05] your boat going to rock but we have an
[1:03:08] anchor
[1:03:09] my god the storm may be raging the sea
[1:03:12] may be turning
[1:03:14] the boat could be rocking in your life
[1:03:17] but you have an anchor
[1:03:19] and the anchor holes
[1:03:21] in spite of the storm
[1:03:23] oh glory to god the anchor holes
[1:03:27] in spite of the stone oh glory to god
[1:03:32] oh give the lord a shout
[1:03:35] let this be a special service to you
[1:03:38] do you want that
[1:03:40] you can have that
[1:03:41] the pill on fire could come directly to
[1:03:45] you
[1:03:46] oh hallelujah
[1:03:48] have faith
[1:03:51] in god
[1:03:52] hallelujah
[1:03:54] four messengers of death killed the tree
[1:03:57] therefore god had to send for messengers
[1:03:59] of life
[1:04:01] to restore the tree
[1:04:03] luther brought justification wesley
[1:04:05] sanification pentecostals the
[1:04:08] restoration of the gifts and the holy
[1:04:09] ghost what was the thought the thought
[1:04:11] was the word
[1:04:13] therefore if we stay with the word we
[1:04:15] stay with the life
[1:04:17] because the word has the life
[1:04:20] so all these years god was getting the
[1:04:22] life in
[1:04:23] because he disguised the life as the
[1:04:25] word
[1:04:26] and the secret is the word
[1:04:29] is in the bride
[1:04:31] and what she's waiting for she's waiting
[1:04:33] for dynamics
[1:04:34] the anointing the glory

[1:05:07] that's what the trials is to do you know
[1:05:09] not about
[1:05:10] a week or quarter week
[1:05:13] that's a choice
[1:05:17] that's a choice
[1:05:19] there's some people like the loaf
[1:05:23] they don't want to walk
[1:05:25] they didn't have a lady

[1:06:15] hallelujah are people like that
[1:06:17] they intend to get by by any means
[1:06:21] necessary
[1:06:22] it doesn't matter is this principle is
[1:06:24] as right as wrong just to get the the
[1:06:26] mighty dollar
[1:06:29] that can't bring no joy and peace and
[1:06:32] assurance and whatnot
[1:06:34] and god has something without money
[1:06:36] without price
[1:06:38] what's the
[1:06:39] purpose of gaining the whole world
[1:06:43] losing your own soul so many people
[1:06:45] don't even understand how temporary
[1:06:47] you are
[1:06:49] your little child already replacing you
[1:06:51] you don't even know that
[1:06:53] hallelujah praise god
[1:06:55] and we just see them as little children
[1:06:57] and don't see them 20 years from now 30
[1:06:58] years from now we're not seeing that
[1:07:00] like it's veal from our eyes
[1:07:02] that's his life
[1:07:04] oh hallelujah
[1:07:06] get serious folks
[1:07:08] i like to say it this way we are only
[1:07:09] here from point a to point z to do
[1:07:12] something for god for god
[1:07:14] not for yourself or your family for god
[1:07:17] for god
[1:07:18] if god come down now and say what have
[1:07:20] you done for the kingdom
[1:07:22] in the last 20 years where's your answer
[1:07:23] where i went to church is that right
[1:07:28] for the kingdom
[1:07:34] what do you do to contribute to what's
[1:07:35] the kingdom
[1:07:37] of god because all what you have in life
[1:07:38] doesn't conquer
[1:07:40] you
[1:07:42] your car your house your fridge your
[1:07:44] stove
[1:07:45] you're saying i like your stove you like
[1:07:47] it your room set you said i'm on
[1:07:49] there's a nice bed head you have
[1:07:52] that bed not going into
[1:07:54] sorry that limousine is not going
[1:07:56] we're staying right back
[1:07:59] are you with me
[1:08:00] so for the short time we have let's do
[1:08:02] our best
[1:08:04] for his glory
[1:08:06] for his kingdom that's why canada
[1:08:08] understand the parade of ministers and
[1:08:10] men trying to present themselves
[1:08:12] instead of presenting god because that's
[1:08:14] how we have mr pope
[1:08:17] because men came forward and shift the
[1:08:19] holy ghost out
[1:08:21] men overpowered the laity and it was no
[1:08:23] longer god of the audience was god the
[1:08:25] man man man pastor pastor pastor bishop
[1:08:28] bishop bishop
[1:08:31] nobody make it easy you remember the
[1:08:33] prayer you have none spraying for you
[1:08:36] you could sin and make it easy you sin
[1:08:38] you do a little hand like that shake a
[1:08:40] little water on you and you're good
[1:08:42] if that is god's program you're fine
[1:08:45] but that is not god's problem
[1:08:47] so you need the blood
[1:08:49] you need to repent you need to have a
[1:08:51] desire to get right with god
[1:08:53] isn't that right so the fourth one was
[1:08:54] the word isn't that right in the last
[1:08:56] day malachi for elijah has to come with
[1:08:58] the very word the word of god came to
[1:09:00] the prophet to bring the fourth light
[1:09:03] what was the thought was the word itself
[1:09:06] the word made flesh
[1:09:08] fruits of the proof of the resurrection
[1:09:11] sign that christ here we go
[1:09:13] finally after justification being
[1:09:16] planted
[1:09:16] suffocation being planted the
[1:09:19] baptismally goes organization died out
[1:09:22] and christ here we go has again centered
[1:09:25] himself like the cap of the pyramid
[1:09:28] first line justification
[1:09:30] certification
[1:09:31] then hope button holy ghost then the
[1:09:34] coming of the care
[1:09:36] what did he say abraham
[1:09:38] fate
[1:09:39] jacob love isn't that right jacob grace
[1:09:42] jose perfection
[1:09:44] isn't that right jose perfection is the
[1:09:46] last line
[1:09:47] which is the word
[1:09:48] which is the light which is the fourth
[1:09:51] light
[1:09:52] is joseph
[1:09:53] isn't that right
[1:09:55] joseph perfection means there's nothing
[1:09:57] against you
[1:09:58] that's god
[1:09:59] working his way out
[1:10:01] what is that that is you being justified
[1:10:05] and i could read that for you justified
[1:10:07] doesn't mean forgive him
[1:10:09] justified means as if you never did it
[1:10:11] [Music]
[1:10:22] you remember when it went long the green
[1:10:24] began to ripen and watch
[1:10:26] before that green can ripen
[1:10:29] everything in that talk has to be dead
[1:10:31] can't you see where we are standing
[1:10:34] life
[1:10:35] is in the grain again
[1:10:37] what is it just exactly the same grain
[1:10:40] that went on the ground the same jesus
[1:10:42] in bright form
[1:10:45] same
[1:10:46] jesus
[1:10:48] in bright form
[1:10:50] same power
[1:10:52] same church
[1:10:53] same thing

[1:28:11] [Applause]
[1:28:13] conquerors
[1:28:15] [Applause]

[1:28:20] uh adores redeemers by their blood and
[1:28:22] we
[1:28:24] shall reign
[1:28:26] on the earth terrain is to rule
[1:28:30] to conquer
[1:28:31] to overcome to dominate
[1:28:33] that is what it is

[1:28:41] oh give the lord some praises

[1:28:55] i want to hear a bigger aiming than that
[1:28:58] take back
[1:28:59] [Applause]
[1:29:01] take back your land
[1:29:15] revelation freedom of religion that's
[1:29:17] the lamb
[1:29:18] then the lambs speak like a dragon
[1:29:20] no more freedom
[1:29:21] they enact in laws what they couldn't do
[1:29:24] by force by by other means they're
[1:29:26] bringing it as a law
[1:29:29] this is now the law
[1:29:33] but ram saw it
[1:29:34] he said they will close down the
[1:29:36] churches
[1:29:37] because the act of the law is contrary
[1:29:39] to what god say in his word
[1:29:42] so the churches will have a choice
[1:29:44] hear what man say or hear what god say
[1:29:47] and they're going to close along the
[1:29:48] churches and he said the churches will
[1:29:50] become store houses they don't care
[1:29:53] citizens have an agenda
[1:29:55] look how foolish they come with this
[1:29:56] bathroom thing now
[1:29:58] male female they want everybody to use
[1:29:59] the same bathroom
[1:30:01] some people don't know if they're he or
[1:30:02] she call it him or she
[1:30:07] will have male female and fashion
[1:30:09] whoever else in the go there
[1:30:12] but they want to force everybody because
[1:30:14] there's an agenda
[1:30:15] agenda to corrupt the world
[1:30:18] that's lucifer again
[1:30:21] but we see him
[1:30:23] in action
[1:30:24] the prophet tell us it will come a
[1:30:26] tightening
[1:30:27] but when they start to press ourselves
[1:30:29] watch for the turtle then
[1:30:32] because god has to release a power to
[1:30:34] face beast power
[1:30:35] that's not just a beast
[1:30:38] it's a beast's power
[1:30:40] you can't feel the beast ball with a
[1:30:41] scripture
[1:30:43] or some daily word
[1:30:49] i'll show you what i'm talking about
[1:30:50] when the people got the holy ghost in
[1:30:52] the upper room bahram said those demons
[1:30:54] say
[1:30:55] they're just excited
[1:30:58] leave them alone
[1:30:59] they feel their own
[1:31:01] the dancing and shouting and have a lot
[1:31:02] of noise in the upper room that is this
[1:31:04] noise
[1:31:05] when peter make that man walk
[1:31:08] but only the devil got up and said no
[1:31:10] this is serious now
[1:31:12] this we can't let continue
[1:31:14] this we have to stop dynamic books and
[1:31:16] tapes and hand no tracks
[1:31:18] that is the same jesus
[1:31:22] you you you're not hearing what i'm
[1:31:24] saying
[1:31:25] that jesus troubled that devil you know
[1:31:28] [Applause]
[1:31:29] [Music]
[1:31:31] oh
[1:31:32] hallelujah
[1:31:34] when when when when satan and them saw
[1:31:36] the same power flowing through jesus to
[1:31:38] peter which is disciples now because
[1:31:41] because jesus was representing son of
[1:31:43] man
[1:31:45] the holy ghost is son of god
[1:31:47] son of god always follow son of man
[1:31:51] son of man is word
[1:31:53] sower bringing seed
[1:31:56] son of god is holy spirit
[1:31:58] bringing water bringing fire bringing
[1:32:02] green
[1:32:03] so son of man brought seed
[1:32:05] openly understand to the scriptures
[1:32:07] give them the full word that they have
[1:32:09] divine revelation of what to expect
[1:32:12] then they created atmosphere of worship
[1:32:15] in the upper room and then son of god
[1:32:17] came down
[1:32:18] pillar of fire giving each one their
[1:32:21] portion
[1:32:22] so now they are anointed with god
[1:32:25] the seed in them is now alive
[1:32:28] the anointing is with them
[1:32:30] fire is with them
[1:32:32] power is with them
[1:32:34] not yet expressed
[1:32:37] until the need arises so when peter was
[1:32:40] going to the gate called beautiful that
[1:32:42] man everybody knew that man even peter
[1:32:45] custom giving a man another coin or
[1:32:47] something but that day peter was broke

[1:44:19] where jesus told his disciples he needs
[1:44:22] patrick samaria

[1:44:34] jesus came to reveal
[1:44:36] her name
[1:44:37] on the book

[1:45:21] worship is not because god gives you
[1:45:22] something what you have to do with who
[1:45:24] he is
[1:45:25] he is god

[1:46:27] perfection we have to wait and
[1:46:29] resurrection it takes perfection to
[1:46:31] bring on resurrection therefore we got
[1:46:33] to come into the perfection oh give the
[1:46:35] lord some praise his people
[1:46:37] hallelujah
[1:46:39] hallelujah
[1:46:40] glory to god
[1:46:43] watch
[1:46:44] watch
[1:46:45] this church is coming smaller in a
[1:46:47] minority and he's looking at the pyramid
[1:46:49] just as you see he's brought at the
[1:46:50] bottom feet virtue and i go to near to
[1:46:52] the top it's getting narrower narrower
[1:46:54] narrower less and less
[1:46:57] so as we get further up it's less and
[1:46:58] less you know
[1:47:00] going up that pyramid people slide over
[1:47:03] you know
[1:47:04] fit off
[1:47:06] keep on climbing
[1:47:08] come on now you're cast up at godliness
[1:47:09] or patience we have to say add add add
[1:47:13] until we can add to orderly kindness
[1:47:15] charity
[1:47:16] the message is in trouble
[1:47:19] because brotherly kindness is an issue
[1:47:23] big issue
[1:47:24] people have problems forgiven
[1:47:29] then how could they have the ministry of
[1:47:30] reconciliation
[1:47:32] without the spirit of
[1:47:35] you don't hear what forgiveness saying
[1:47:37] how
[1:47:38] how could the voice of the ministry of
[1:47:41] reconciliation
[1:47:42] be preeminent
[1:47:44] if there isn't the spirit of forgiveness
[1:47:47] but thank god
[1:47:48] for eagle prophet
[1:47:50] that said when the church
[1:47:53] finds
[1:47:54] [Applause]
[1:47:56] it's probably lord
[1:47:59] he prophesied
[1:48:01] that we're gonna find it now
[1:48:05] 2016
[1:48:06] to probably live
[1:48:08] at
[1:48:10] the love of god
[1:48:12] oh give the lord praises
[1:48:14] oh hallelujah
[1:48:17] do i speak with the tongues of men and
[1:48:18] angels and have that charity
[1:48:21] it profited me nothing do i give my
[1:48:24] bodies to be burned and have not this
[1:48:26] love it is nothing
[1:48:28] [Applause]
[1:48:33] remember he sees it
[1:48:35] until the church
[1:48:37] gets to a place here we go
[1:48:39] till it's the same kind of ministry that
[1:48:42] this left
[1:48:43] [Music]
[1:48:45] that is a little more than plain tips
[1:48:48] and reading books
[1:48:49] it's a little more than that
[1:48:51] it's the same ministry
[1:48:53] hallelujah that was here has come back
[1:48:56] watch then when it comes
[1:48:58] this church has got to be honed
[1:49:01] he introduced a different word now
[1:49:03] you see you are stone that has to be cut
[1:49:06] and there's ministries that come to cut
[1:49:08] your stone
[1:49:09] because you are to be fitted in
[1:49:13] god not cutting the stone to fit you you
[1:49:16] cutting the fit into this capstone
[1:49:18] or this love stone or this headstone
[1:49:22] [Music]
[1:49:25] when the cap comes the pyramid itself
[1:49:29] the body of christ
[1:49:31] will have to be honed
[1:49:33] not only just some creed or doctrine or
[1:49:36] some other thing become true it have to
[1:49:38] be so so he is saying it clearly
[1:49:41] not doctrine
[1:49:42] not creed he said but it has to be so
[1:49:45] perfectly like christ
[1:49:48] till when he comes he and that ministry
[1:49:50] will spit smack together
[1:49:53] so he is saying the ministry of christ
[1:49:57] have to be reproduced again
[1:50:00] among god's people
[1:50:01] [Music]
[1:50:03] can we go a little further
[1:50:05] are you enjoying the word
[1:50:07] oh hallelujah
[1:50:09] question and answers i know what was the
[1:50:11] other question was i the son of man here
[1:50:13] it is i believe the son of man or was
[1:50:15] the pillar for the son of man no
[1:50:17] the pillar of fire is the anointing
[1:50:20] now that pillar of fire is the logos
[1:50:22] that went out of god
[1:50:24] which is actually the attribute of the
[1:50:26] fullness of god
[1:50:28] when man was made in the image of god
[1:50:31] then god came down
[1:50:33] in the image of man to redeem man
[1:50:36] and that brought man and god together
[1:50:38] heaven and earth hug and kiss each other
[1:50:40] god and man embrace each other
[1:50:41] fatherhood and sonship then the logos
[1:50:44] became flesh and dwelt among us now
[1:50:46] the logos that was in him
[1:50:48] which was the spirit of god the
[1:50:51] anointing amen
[1:50:53] through the sanctifying grace of the
[1:50:55] blood
[1:50:57] brought
[1:50:58] [Music]
[1:50:59] many sons to god
[1:51:02] which is anointed with the same logos
[1:51:08] on the day of pentecost it came down the
[1:51:10] pillar of fire broke apart and tongues
[1:51:13] of fire set up on each of them
[1:51:15] and
[1:51:16] an elected selected group
[1:51:18] identified by this pillar of fire
[1:51:21] showing that god had separated himself
[1:51:23] into man do you get it
[1:51:25] god the logos
[1:51:27] separating himself into men
[1:51:31] not in one person
[1:51:34] this is barbara marie
[1:51:35] he is in his church
[1:51:37] universal
[1:51:39] god was bottled and confined in one man
[1:51:43] jesus christ but now
[1:51:45] he is battled and confined in the whole
[1:51:48] universal church of the living god
[1:51:51] right now while god is speaking to us in
[1:51:54] our hearts he's in africa
[1:51:56] he's in asia
[1:51:58] he's in europe he's in england wherever
[1:52:00] believers i got it together he's in the
[1:52:02] midst of them could we give the lord
[1:52:04] praises
[1:52:04] [Applause]
[1:52:09] so anybody trying to lock god down in a
[1:52:12] group or a church they have a certain
[1:52:13] kind of deficiency in their mind
[1:52:18] [Music]
[1:52:19] they have mental problems
[1:52:22] because god is not battling himself up
[1:52:25] in no one man
[1:52:27] one man's show is over
[1:52:30] god going to use any man
[1:52:33] or woman
[1:52:34] he could put his hands on
[1:52:36] oh let god put his hands on you this
[1:52:38] morning
[1:52:40] oh hallelujah praise god
[1:52:43] then watch the works of it among us
[1:52:46] proves the same jesus that once lived in
[1:52:48] palestine the same spirit that was upon
[1:52:50] him has come to a body until it come
[1:52:53] back to headship again which he's
[1:52:54] becoming soon to claim the body the head
[1:52:57] is coming to the body you get it that
[1:53:00] will be here we go the son of god
[1:53:02] the son of man
[1:53:04] the son of david
[1:53:05] the i am
[1:53:07] the rose and sharon the leader of the
[1:53:09] valley the morning
[1:53:10] star i am not he
[1:53:14] this is bob brown the question was are
[1:53:16] you the son of man i
[1:53:18] am not he
[1:53:20] i am his servant
[1:53:23] and the pillar of fire
[1:53:25] is not he
[1:53:27] it's in spirit form
[1:53:29] which was upon the son of man has now
[1:53:32] come to anoint
[1:53:34] sons of men to bring back a ministry
[1:53:38] [Music]
[1:53:39] do you get that
[1:53:40] the same pillar of fire that was back
[1:53:43] there in the upper room has to come back
[1:53:45] and anoint men
[1:53:47] to bring back
[1:53:48] that same ministry
[1:53:50] we find out that the pyramid they never
[1:53:53] get the headstone on it why the
[1:53:54] headstone is yet to come
[1:53:57] now christ come into his body christ is
[1:54:00] the word we all know here we go the
[1:54:02] anointing is christ i love that
[1:54:05] christ is the word
[1:54:06] and christ is the anointing
[1:54:08] christ is the anointing that comes on
[1:54:10] the word that makes the word live
[1:54:14] that is the anointing
[1:54:16] christ is the anointing the spirit that
[1:54:19] comes upon the word to quicken the word
[1:54:22] and to make it live
[1:54:24] now the church
[1:54:25] has got to get to the ministry
[1:54:29] the church has to get to it
[1:54:31] the church
[1:54:32] can't stay where it is
[1:54:35] it has to get into position
[1:54:37] which is placed in christ
[1:54:39] oh give the lord a shout in the house
[1:54:42] we under something we're under something
[1:54:43] we under something now the church has
[1:54:45] got to get to the ministry until the
[1:54:48] church and christ become one
[1:54:50] get his bum he can anoint you for every
[1:54:53] blessing that's in the bible
[1:54:55] all is yours
[1:54:57] every promise of this age is yours
[1:55:00] when you get to that ministry
[1:55:02] oh hallelujah praise god praise god or
[1:55:05] give the lord some praises
[1:55:07] he said oh brother
[1:55:09] give me a church
[1:55:11] full of the holy ghost
[1:55:12] god will do in one year
[1:55:14] what all the theologians couldn't do and
[1:55:16] fought
[1:55:17] in 2000 years
[1:55:19] what the books and tapes could not do
[1:55:21] for the last 50 years
[1:55:23] god will win one year
[1:55:25] with the church
[1:55:27] full of the holy ghost
[1:55:33] oh give the lord
[1:55:34] some praises
[1:55:36] you wait till the anointing of church
[1:55:38] really strikes home
[1:55:39] then the door after the daughter of the
[1:55:41] gentile is closed god will anoint your
[1:55:43] church then
[1:55:44] he does fail to be filthy still
[1:55:46] oh my oh my
[1:55:49] oh my oh my
[1:55:51] oh my i tried to wrap up here
[1:55:53] oh glory to god
[1:55:55] for a message
[1:55:56] dedication and i wanted to get to this
[1:56:04] book of acts
[1:56:05] 7 chapter 44 verse he's reading the
[1:56:07] scripture
[1:56:08] our fathers had a tamil act of witness
[1:56:10] in the wilderness
[1:56:12] he had appointed speaking unto moses
[1:56:13] that he should make it according to
[1:56:14] fashion he had seen
[1:56:17] and which also our fathers that came
[1:56:19] after brought in with jesus
[1:56:21] into the possession of the gentiles whom
[1:56:23] god dravel before the face of our
[1:56:25] fathers unto the days of david
[1:56:27] who found favor before god and was
[1:56:30] desires to find a tabernacle of god of
[1:56:32] jacob
[1:56:34] solomon built him on the house
[1:56:36] how be it the most high dwelleth nothing
[1:56:38] temples made with hands
[1:56:39] i said the prophet
[1:56:41] have missed my throne
[1:56:42] where is my footstool
[1:56:44] what house will you build me see the
[1:56:46] lord
[1:56:47] what is the place
[1:56:48] of my rest
[1:56:50] hath not my hands made these things
[1:56:53] and the book of hebrews 10 chapter 5
[1:56:55] verse wherefore he cometh into the world
[1:56:56] and said sacrifices though an offering
[1:56:58] is not what it's not but a body has dope
[1:57:01] prepared me
[1:57:03] listen carefully
[1:57:05] if you notice
[1:57:06] the material wasn't found only in
[1:57:08] palestine this temple
[1:57:10] because it just wasn't there
[1:57:14] he had to go to the rest of the world
[1:57:16] the known world to find these paths that
[1:57:19] were going to the temple
[1:57:21] what a beautiful application that is
[1:57:23] that god don't just cut his material out
[1:57:26] of jews only
[1:57:27] out of the white only
[1:57:29] out of the brown or red or black or
[1:57:32] whatever colors they may be
[1:57:33] just out of united states only just over
[1:57:36] canada only he cuts his materials from
[1:57:39] all the world
[1:57:42] could we say amen to that
[1:57:43] [Applause]
[1:57:49] so no nation could claim we have
[1:57:52] all the materials
[1:57:55] no
[1:57:56] god arranged it for it to be around the
[1:57:58] world
[1:57:59] and if while they were cutting the stone
[1:58:02] a certain kind was found in such a part
[1:58:04] of the country maybe cutting a stone
[1:58:05] over another nation to fit to that stone
[1:58:07] was cut another nation it may seem to be
[1:58:10] very strange to the people
[1:58:12] the pastor i see odd looking stones
[1:58:14] being cut
[1:58:15] but god has his own way of doing
[1:58:18] something
[1:58:20] and i think he's doing the same thing
[1:58:21] today
[1:58:23] now we find out the materials being cut
[1:58:25] in their own
[1:58:27] native land
[1:58:31] was peculiar
[1:58:33] from a material cut
[1:58:35] in another native land
[1:58:38] we find out that they all transported it
[1:58:40] from oxcart and so forth some of them
[1:58:42] come by sea some by oxcar somebody
[1:58:44] floated down the dropper by raf so forth
[1:58:46] they all haul together all together they
[1:58:48] were coming to one place
[1:58:50] to one purpose
[1:58:53] to fulfill
[1:58:54] the command of god
[1:58:57] the cedars was not cut in lebanon
[1:59:00] lebanon cedars was the most noted season
[1:59:02] of the world
[1:59:03] there was one that redwood is found in
[1:59:05] california
[1:59:06] there is one they call in africa mosul
[1:59:08] bend
[1:59:10] and and cedars now the warmer country
[1:59:12] have higher timber becomes and the
[1:59:13] colder countries software becomes it
[1:59:15] have its spiritual application too
[1:59:17] cold and indifferent soft and fluted
[1:59:20] when it's warm it's spirit-filled it
[1:59:22] clings together becomes useful in the
[1:59:24] master's hand
[1:59:25] the material cut out in a native land
[1:59:27] brought into one place
[1:59:29] and when they were brought together
[1:59:31] they was perfectly fit
[1:59:35] in the space of 40 years it taken
[1:59:37] construction not one saw to be stoned to
[1:59:40] be restored
[1:59:43] these stones in different paths that
[1:59:45] were cut was so perfect
[1:59:47] they only had to assemble it
[1:59:53] oh hallelujah
[1:59:56] and many of those stones look very odd
[1:59:59] but there was a place
[2:00:01] in the temple
[2:00:03] for every odd
[2:00:05] peculiar stone
[2:00:07] god had a place for them
[2:00:10] so theowing may be very odd
[2:00:13] but god
[2:00:14] have a place for him
[2:00:16] in the capstone
[2:00:18] in the headstone
[2:00:20] in the temple
[2:00:21] and god is building a habitation
[2:00:25] with us together
[2:00:27] because one man can't make up the
[2:00:29] habitation of god
[2:00:31] or you're not hearing what i'm saying
[2:00:33] he is building a habitation for
[2:00:35] permanent dwelling
[2:00:37] oh give the lord some praises people oh
[2:00:40] hallelujah
[2:00:42] he's calling other people
[2:00:44] to make up the headstone
[2:00:45] to come into it
[2:00:49] [Applause]
[2:00:52] hallelujah
[2:00:53] oh i'm taking on the wrap-up listen to
[2:00:54] this
[2:00:56] watch when the temple the real temple we
[2:00:58] will come to a few minutes come together
[2:01:00] there will be a place for every odd
[2:01:01] acting person
[2:01:05] he moved from
[2:01:06] acting stone it's an odd acting person
[2:01:09] so you can write out all the different
[2:01:11] ones
[2:01:12] who have left hand who have right hand
[2:01:14] who tall who's short
[2:01:16] leave them alone
[2:01:17] you will make them and you cannot make
[2:01:19] them
[2:01:20] let god deal with him
[2:01:21] go heart pray for them
[2:01:23] encourage them god of all types

[2:01:48] and and he used to be president of the
[2:01:49] paid taxes you know
[2:01:52] and that is shake his hands go go god
[2:01:53] bless you but attack collector
[2:01:56] no no they might be enjoying shaking

[2:02:26] oh hallelujah let's be reconciled back
[2:02:29] to god
[2:02:30] let's get in the spirit of unity
[2:02:32] [Applause]
[2:02:38] watch we may look a little funny to
[2:02:39] someone else
[2:02:40] and act a little funny but remember it's
[2:02:43] a place there for us
[2:02:44] god is cutting out his church
[2:02:46] oh hallelujah
[2:02:48] notice the builders
[2:02:50] there was one stone there was actually
[2:02:51] two at the full hit
[2:02:54] so the builders rejected it
[2:02:56] and they pitched it over to the corner
[2:02:58] that stone is too out to be used there's
[2:02:59] no other place remember it's the
[2:03:01] builders who should have known the front
[2:03:03] we find out they built the building so
[2:03:05] high till they missed the stone
[2:03:07] they didn't know where that stone was
[2:03:09] the situation ships they might have run
[2:03:11] through every ox cart did you lose one
[2:03:12] on the road there's something wrong
[2:03:14] and they couldn't find it nowhere else
[2:03:16] and come to find out it was right on the
[2:03:18] ground
[2:03:19] it was the chief cornerstone
[2:03:21] that the builders rejected
[2:03:23] jesus spoke of it and said have you not
[2:03:25] read of the stone that the bible
[2:03:26] rejected was the chief cornerstone the
[2:03:28] head of all of it where is the rest of
[2:03:30] the building rested on and think
[2:03:33] the building today
[2:03:35] of the spiritual house that god worships
[2:03:37] in i think is a great big failure today
[2:03:40] among the builders
[2:03:41] we have come with our denominations we
[2:03:43] have laid them in sincerity we have sent
[2:03:45] our boys to school to educate them learn
[2:03:47] psychology by the history beautiful
[2:03:49] music and so forth of your built we find
[2:03:51] out there's something wrong we have
[2:03:53] built it out of man-made material what
[2:03:56] scholarship all these things will not
[2:03:58] work as long as we have not accepted the
[2:04:00] odd stone
[2:04:01] the peculiar stone
[2:04:03] and as the building began to materialize
[2:04:05] they realized that the hole that was
[2:04:06] left that odd stone fitted to the dirt
[2:04:10] and that is where the spiritual bill is
[2:04:11] today and that's why listen this is
[2:04:14] important that's why the bride
[2:04:17] building
[2:04:18] of christ is not
[2:04:20] ready for the bridegroom
[2:04:23] here's why
[2:04:25] is because the builders
[2:04:27] have rejected the chief cornerstone that
[2:04:30] was laid on the day of pentecost
[2:04:33] which is the baptism of the holy spirit
[2:04:37] it's been odd people act funny they
[2:04:40] don't fit in there they kicked it out it
[2:04:42] was too hard
[2:04:47] oh hallelujah
[2:04:49] brother branham said no we already have
[2:04:51] the stones the stones go for ordained we
[2:04:53] have got them all on the way from
[2:04:55] ephesus to laodicea we are only waiting
[2:04:57] for the headstone that the bill has
[2:04:59] rejected waiting for his coming
[2:05:02] and balaam said if that be so then the
[2:05:04] thunder's kept the pyramid so the seven
[2:05:06] thunders is the headstone
[2:05:08] that the penis refused but you have
[2:05:10] received it
