[13:00] this time of prayer and calling upon

[13:18] pray in their homes in Jesus name I ask
[13:20] it amen and amen praise God Amen God
[13:22] bless you and welcome I believe that you
[13:27] in the right spot tonight you're in the
[13:28] right place where God has ordained for
[13:31] you and even now tonight in this uh
[13:35] virtual room this virtual prayer room
[13:39] you know it's a nice touch point where
[13:40] we could call upon God and it also give
[13:44] us this space though we not in the same
[13:46] physical place we have an opportunity to
[13:49] have our own closet or to have our own
[13:51] altar right in your home just think this
[13:55] time aside is like having an alter time
[13:58] with God
[13:59] it wouldn't be so much the volume of
[14:01] prayer and you as you will see tonight
[14:03] what you're going to share and read but
[14:06] what is the quality or the condition of
[14:09] your heart in praying to God so tonight
[14:12] I want to get a scripture for you here
[14:14] and this scripture is from 1 Peter 5 5-7
[14:19] it says likewise the younger submit
[14:21] yourselves unto the Elder ye all of you
[14:25] be subject one to another and be clothed
[14:30] with humility for God resisted the proud
[14:34] and giveth grace to the humble humble
[14:36] yourselves therefore under the mighty
[14:39] hand of God that he may exalt you in due
[14:42] time casting all your care upon him for
[14:46] he carth for you and I have a little
[14:49] thought here tonight humble yourselves
[14:51] under the mighty hand of God now this
[14:55] scripture in the Amplified reads this
[14:58] way likewise you who are younger and
[15:02] lesser of a lesser rank be subject to
[15:05] the elders the ministers and the
[15:07] spiritual Guides of the church giving
[15:11] them due respect and yielding to the
[15:15] counil clothe or apron yourselves all of
[15:19] you with
[15:21] humility as the G of a servant so that
[15:26] it is covering and cannot
[15:29] possibly be stripped from you with
[15:32] freedom from pride and arrogance towards
[15:36] one another for God sets himself against
[15:40] the proud the insolent the overbearing
[15:43] the disdainful the presumptuous the
[15:47] boastful and he
[15:49] opposes frustrates and defeats them but
[15:53] give Grace favor blessing to the humble
[15:57] therefore hum
[15:59] yourselves demote lower yourselves in
[16:03] your own
[16:05] estimation under the mighty hand of God
[16:09] and in due time he may exalt you casting
[16:12] the whole of your care all your
[16:15] anxieties all your worries all your
[16:18] concerns once and for all on him for he
[16:22] cares for you affectionately and cares
[16:25] about you watchfully I just love how
[16:28] this is phrase
[16:29] he cares for you affectionately and
[16:32] cares for you watchfully what a blessing
[16:36] this word this word of God so we see
[16:39] here that God actually opposes and
[16:43] frustrates and defeats the boastful the
[16:46] presumptuous the proud so it's a real
[16:50] quality to have an attitude of
[16:53] humility and brother bam said this
[16:56] Israel had those experiences Israel come
[16:59] out of Egypt Israel seen signs Miracles
[17:01] wonders all along their Road they had
[17:04] passed through the Red Sea as on dry
[17:05] land they seen Mana full out of Heaven
[17:07] every night they were Witnesses the
[17:09] blessings of God upon their life but
[17:12] then they failed to disobey one of God's
[17:15] Commandments and what happened the
[17:17] blessing cut off from them and they
[17:20] presumed that because God had been so
[17:23] good he's just go on be good but God
[17:27] can't do that
[17:29] and I think we have come to that spot
[17:32] here we go we have come to Kish Bia when
[17:35] God has given the issue of the church to
[17:38] call a halt and back to a prayer life
[17:43] back to
[17:44] consecration back to the spot that we
[17:48] consecrate ourselves away from the
[17:50] things of the world away from our little
[17:54] petty differences among us and get back
[17:56] to God and brotherly love
[17:59] and humility back to the power of God
[18:04] again now we are just presuming that we
[18:08] are running all right because God is
[18:10] blessing note how this is phrased
[18:13] because God is blessing he was blessing
[18:17] Israel probably the same day that they
[18:20] refused to go up there to take the
[18:22] promised land the same day that they
[18:25] disbelieved the spies the Mana fell just
[18:28] the same that night but they were all
[18:31] together out of the will of God they
[18:34] could not win another battle they they
[18:37] come back and make things another battle
[18:40] until they come back and make things
[18:41] right with God and I think it is time
[18:45] for the church to get back to God again
[18:48] get back and get started like it should
[18:51] be going so we can continue our journey
[18:55] listen yet they know God was a good God
[19:00] he was full of Mercy this is a song
[19:02] People start to say God is a good God
[19:03] every time God is a good god right watch
[19:06] he was full of Mercy he had give them
[19:09] Mercy he had shown them his glory even
[19:13] their shoes wasn't wearing out their
[19:15] clothes wasn't getting tread bear Mana
[19:18] was falling from Heaven every night they
[19:20] seen miracles signs and and all along of
[19:23] the presence of God with them yet they
[19:27] presumed that because God had did that
[19:31] that they could go up there and take
[19:32] that mountain here it is when if we want
[19:36] spiritual gifts in the church if we want
[19:39] the power of God the real power of God I
[19:42] tell you brother sister it's so easy for
[19:45] someone to be deceived on that sensation
[19:47] and things the devil can impersonate
[19:50] nearly any Sensation that God has got
[19:53] but you see our church is not moving the
[19:56] way it should move we know there is
[19:58] something wrong and we know then that
[20:01] God here we go will not be with us until
[20:05] we get whatever it is straighten out so
[20:10] it is time to check up see the things
[20:13] that we should do and what things we
[20:15] should not do and then get ready and go
[20:19] ahead praise the Lord amen so I have a
[20:22] couple of scriptures I like to share
[20:23] with you um this one speaks about how to
[20:27] walk humbly with God this is from Mah
[20:29] Micah 68 he had showed the oh man what
[20:33] is good and what that the Lord require
[20:37] of thee but to do justly to love mercy
[20:42] and to walk humbly with thy God so this
[20:45] is a
[20:47] requirement this is what God is
[20:49] instructed that we do just we love mercy
[20:52] and we walk humbling Proverbs 22:4 by
[20:56] humility and the faith of the Lord are
[21:00] riches honor and
[21:03] Life by
[21:05] what humility connected with the fear of
[21:09] the
[21:11] Lord by that there are riches honor and
[21:17] life James 4:10 humble yourselves in the
[21:20] sight of God and he shall lift you
[21:24] up
[21:26] so humbling also means a promotion if
[21:30] you have the ability to humble yourself
[21:35] God going to give you a
[21:37] special a a raise you up in a special
[21:40] way Philippians 2:3 which is a familiar
[21:43] one let nothing be done through Strife
[21:46] or vain Glory but in loneliness of Mind
[21:50] Let each esteem one another better than
[21:53] themselves for to the selfish
[21:56] individuals this is a tough one
[21:59] because you see you burdened about you
[22:02] you concerned about you and in life you
[22:07] can't as a Christian just be caught up
[22:10] in you and and yourself and your own
[22:13] family you have to be concerned about
[22:15] others because even though you think
[22:18] their problems does not affect you and
[22:22] their problems have nothing to do with
[22:24] you you have to be careful you could
[22:26] come back and put some blows on
[22:29] so therefore this word here show that
[22:33] God is encouraging us to consider
[22:37] others more important than
[22:41] ourselves and this is a a real how to
[22:45] say it a real expression of humility
[22:48] because you are valuing others better
[22:51] than yourself praise God 1 Peter
[22:55] 56 humble yourselves therefore under the
[22:59] mighty hand of God that's we read that
[23:01] he may exalt you in due time now we know
[23:05] the scripture we have touched on this
[23:07] many times in prayer meeting if my
[23:09] people that second chonicles 7:14 which
[23:11] I call by my name shall humble
[23:12] themselves and pray and I think I struck
[23:15] this before that before you could really
[23:18] pray you have to get in this posture of
[23:21] humility that is what neing does that is
[23:24] what Bo before the Lord does we are not
[23:27] on the same table with him he is God we
[23:31] bow before him we kneel before him we
[23:35] show our dependance upon him and James
[23:38] expressed that in James 46 says he
[23:41] giveth more grace wherever he see God
[23:44] resisted the proud but give it more
[23:46] grace unto the humble submit yourselves
[23:49] therefore to God resist the devil and he
[23:52] will flee from you so humility is you
[23:56] recognizing your need
[23:58] and you are dependent upon God that's
[24:02] that that's humility you know and um
[24:05] Jesus he was the Bible in Philippians
[24:08] said and being found as a fashion as a
[24:10] man he humbled himself so we are not
[24:13] born humble we're not trained to be
[24:16] humble on the contrary we are trained to
[24:19] be confident to be how they say it um uh
[24:24] uh um uh you know like reflected before
[24:28] you commit there's a statement can't
[24:29] remember the statement right now but
[24:31] there's something like you know you
[24:33] pretend it then until you get it you
[24:35] know you fled until you you become that
[24:38] but here the Bible exal us to have a
[24:41] different kind of mind so Jesus himself
[24:44] he humble himself and become obedient is
[24:47] it that people that are rebellious they
[24:49] don't want to listen they don't want to
[24:50] Humble themselves they don't want nobody
[24:52] talk to them and every time I talk to
[24:54] them I like how you talk to me and all
[24:56] that kind of nonsense is it that is a
[24:58] lack of humility because you as a person
[25:02] and we all there are things that God
[25:05] will rebuke us and straighten us I
[25:07] remember in the early years I used to
[25:10] call the Believers by their Pastor that
[25:13] is this one people so they P him X like
[25:15] ex people this one and this is y people
[25:17] and and and I remember the Lord rebuked
[25:19] me on that rebuked me on that and said
[25:22] do not say that he said these are my
[25:24] people under these men and I changed and
[25:27] I adjusted thinking towards Believers
[25:30] and people from other churches that I
[25:31] see because at that time in the early
[25:34] years was a lot of legalism a lot of
[25:36] walls being built and everything else I
[25:39] couldn't understand the attitudes that
[25:42] these pastors have like if these people
[25:44] are their possession in other words they
[25:46] to me they wasn't seeing themselves as
[25:48] stewards I see that way that we are
[25:51] stewards just like we have our children
[25:53] the children are not ours like if they
[25:55] are designated to us they are St in
[25:58] other words they are place in our hands
[26:01] that we could stay long enough to bring
[26:03] them to that place of maturity so is the
[26:05] church so are the Believers we are
[26:07] stewards of God's people so Jesus he
[26:11] became obedient and his humility is even
[26:14] reflected in his prayer when he says um
[26:18] father if it is possible could you take
[26:20] this cup in other words he not saying I
[26:23] am Jesus are going through I am the word
[26:25] made flesh and I'm pressing on no no no
[26:28] no he wasn't on that beat he genuinely
[26:31] sought to see if this thing could shift
[26:35] somewhat but he acknowledged not my will
[26:38] but thy will be done he didn't pray this
[26:41] once he prayed this three times he
[26:43] submitted to the father's will and he's
[26:47] teaching us how we too must submit to
[26:50] the will of God as opposed to our own
[26:53] will this have nothing to do with
[26:54] brother now because I believe God will
[26:56] speak to you I believe God will deal
[26:57] with you by the scriptures by the word
[26:59] and there are things that God will tell
[27:01] you that you have to come through to
[27:04] obey so therefore you have to be able to
[27:07] humble yourself so I believe that
[27:10] humility is part and parcel of the
[27:14] Cornerstone of a Christian prayer life
[27:17] that you have to be able to humble
[27:19] yourself under the mighty hand of God I
[27:22] believe that the humility is what brings
[27:25] us into a receptive atmosphere and and
[27:29] and and and open us to God's guidance
[27:31] and God's will you know when I came to
[27:35] the Lord as a young Christian I used to
[27:37] believe that God could use anybody so I
[27:41] had an attitude and an ear it doesn't
[27:45] matter if it's a stranger if it's an
[27:47] unbeliever it's somebody wearing
[27:48] earrings pants it doesn't matter
[27:50] sometime I just listen to what they will
[27:52] tell me or say to me and see if it is
[27:55] God using someone to get a message to me
[27:58] and so often it was real it was true and
[28:03] God could use anyone God could use a
[28:06] donkey God could use your neighbor God
[28:09] could use your boss God could use
[28:12] anybody now if you are arrogant and you
[28:15] think that this one can't tell you
[28:17] anything because they are Catholic this
[28:19] one can't tell you because they are this
[28:21] or whatever it is then you are closed in
[28:25] you're not open enough because sometimes
[28:28] we could entertain strangers sometimes
[28:30] God play somebody to walk into your life
[28:32] sometime we so attached to this network
[28:35] of family we keep every keeping
[28:37] everything secret secret secret God
[28:39] can't come into your secrets you could
[28:42] keep your secret and your secret and
[28:43] your secret and you have your own
[28:44] secretive thing God can't work in that
[28:47] because sometime your blessing is not
[28:49] from your own family sometime God
[28:51] ordained your blessing to be out of your
[28:53] familiar Circle that is why some
[28:55] sometimes you have to step out so
[28:57] therefore true humility brings us to a
[29:01] place where we become dependent upon God
[29:04] our attitude of prayer shows we need him
[29:07] and we have to be dependent upon him so
[29:10] I believe that in recognizing where we
[29:13] are limited in recognizing that we don't
[29:15] have all the answers so in other words
[29:17] you can't go and tell God I am the word
[29:19] the spirit and the bright say come the
[29:20] word and I the father one who you
[29:23] talking to who you telling to not not
[29:25] the father because if you come into
[29:28] presence it shows you your condition and
[29:31] that is why isah say w is me so humility
[29:35] is God's way of getting is God's way of
[29:39] us getting the favor of God when we
[29:41] could humble ourselves the Bible said he
[29:44] resist the proud but he give grace to
[29:47] the humble isn't that something there so
[29:51] God Delights in a broken heart Psalms
[29:55] 51:17 the sacrifices of God are broken
[29:58] Spirit a broken and contrite heart oh
[30:01] God thou will not despise is it that
[30:04] because we have been called out a loud
[30:06] thisa is it that we have received a
[30:08] message an end time message that we
[30:11] could go around with a level of
[30:13] arrogance that we are the bride in the
[30:16] absolute sense I think that is something
[30:18] wrong there I think we could have the
[30:21] confidence and the assurance that we are
[30:23] becoming the word and the word will be
[30:25] manifested but we cannot go in the
[30:28] arrogance and and expect God's favor we
[30:31] have to Humble ourselves and this is
[30:34] where this gospel the gospel come to
[30:37] show our unworthiness our sinfulness and
[30:41] um you know our awareness that we need
[30:44] God and that's why conditions come to
[30:46] drive us to the cross and anytime we
[30:49] feel assured that everything is all
[30:52] right and everything is taken care of we
[30:55] could come slack and loose because it
[30:58] come like we are entitled to God
[30:59] blessing we are entitled we not and we
[31:02] don't see we entitled to fight so
[31:04] sometime God is do something to to upset
[31:07] the apple cat to upset your cart to
[31:09] upset your life to drive you into a
[31:12] different direction so if we want to
[31:15] move
[31:16] God it is not the length of our prayer
[31:20] it's not the eloquence of our words it's
[31:24] what's in that heart and I think it
[31:28] could be mistaken but this is an example
[31:31] of that and this is Luke 18 he speak a
[31:36] parable verse
[31:38] 9 watch this is very clear and specific
[31:42] he spake this Parable unto certain which
[31:46] trusted in themselves that they were
[31:48] righteous and despite others is very
[31:52] unfortunate that there are people today
[31:54] that think they the bride and they
[31:56] despise others
[31:58] they have no burden no concern they
[32:00] figure they it maybe one extra grain of
[32:03] rice one extra grain of peas one extra
[32:05] car one extra house one extra whatever
[32:07] it is they have extra one piece of stuff
[32:10] things and they figure they're better
[32:12] than somebody else they go further than
[32:14] that they actually despise others and
[32:16] Jesus himself give this Parable and
[32:18] we're going to kind of wrap up Jesus
[32:20] give his Parable and he SP this Parable
[32:22] unto certain with trust in themselves
[32:24] that they were righteous and desp two
[32:26] men went up the temple to pray one was a
[32:29] Pharisee the other was a Publican the
[32:31] Pharisees stood and prayed thus with
[32:33] himself God I thank thee that I am not
[32:37] as the other men are and equal of their
[32:39] sins extortioners unjust adulterers and
[32:42] even as this dude behind you this
[32:45] Publican I fast twice in the week I give
[32:49] Tis of all that I possess and the
[32:51] Publican standing a fou would not lift
[32:55] up as much as his eyes onto heaven so he
[32:58] has a
[32:59] posture he has a
[33:02] attitude he is not you know I don't want
[33:05] people feel a poor I don't want the
[33:07] people feel I don't have
[33:08] nothing um you know um I want to be
[33:12] below I want to be on top he's not in
[33:14] that mode he's not boastful he's not
[33:17] waiting to get the best shoes best pants
[33:20] best whatever to come to church he just
[33:22] stood there head bowed and he smoked
[33:26] upon his breast saying God be merciful
[33:29] to me a sinner this pray is very short
[33:32] that's all you know he pray the Myster
[33:35] of the book and going down there and the
[33:36] trumpets and the vales and and make a
[33:38] swing here with the plagues and and make
[33:40] a dance here and dance he wasn't going
[33:41] all there he said God this is a prayer
[33:45] this here these words here are
[33:48] recognized as a prayer God be merciful
[33:51] to me a sinner Jesus speaks I tell you
[33:57] this man
[33:58] went down to his house justify rather
[34:01] than the other for everyone that exalted
[34:05] himself shall be abased and he that
[34:07] humbleth himself shall be exalted so
[34:11] humility is evidence that a heart is
[34:14] aligned to God and that's why brother
[34:17] Brandon says arrogant spirit is not of
[34:19] God want you see arrogance run once you
[34:22] see arrogance you
[34:24] known some problems behind there humil
[34:28] is the channel that God going to use in
[34:31] this last day Humble Hearts true
[34:35] Revelation would make you humble if that
[34:38] is the case why are people still walking
[34:41] around with the with that level of
[34:43] arrogance and pride is only because they
[34:45] lack Revelation because Revelation comes
[34:48] from God and because God has been so
[34:50] good to you and his grace reveal himself
[34:54] to you you want more is not your study
[34:57] your is not your you know is not your
[35:00] effort is is flesh and blood have not
[35:03] revealed it unto you so if in the
[35:05] Supernatural God come and reveal his
[35:08] word to
[35:09] you where you're going with that
[35:11] attitude where you're going with that
[35:13] way so but brandom talk about I'm
[35:17] closing but brandom talk
[35:21] about how a great
[35:23] man make you feel
[35:26] great so a great man don't show off a
[35:32] great man don't uh raise his muscles and
[35:36] say I am great he said when you talk to
[35:38] a great
[35:39] man that man make you feel great there
[35:42] are some people don't make you feel good
[35:44] and actually they want you to feel bad
[35:47] they want to strip you they want to put
[35:49] you in your place they want to put you
[35:51] in your pit they want to put their neck
[35:53] on you but once you stay humble before
[35:56] God God going to bless you and God going
[36:00] to exalt you because Pride listen
[36:03] carefully s always go before fall pride
[36:07] in a heart pride in an individual pride
[36:11] in a church pride in a
[36:13] nation pride in a country always go
[36:17] before a fall Rome had their time Greece
[36:21] had their time Babylon had their time
[36:24] Pharaoh had their time all of them they
[36:26] got proud and puffed up and God cut them
[36:28] down to sides he's the one that bring
[36:30] them through to show who the boss so
[36:33] Pride always go before a in
[36:39] closing
[36:40] humility has to be
[36:44] cultivated the Bible talk about this
[36:48] m humility is not a chance thing it's
[36:50] not like you're get a gift of humility
[36:52] and the brother just go humble you know
[36:54] what the prophet
[36:56] says usually when people get blessed
[36:58] they get proud you say after church get
[37:01] fused and a condition different kind of
[37:03] things next minute the church get staty
[37:05] all time they pray on place they cry
[37:07] outto God they pressing their way but
[37:10] they get Comfort now all the time they
[37:11] fan in it Hur they fan in they get air
[37:13] condition and the air condition cool
[37:15] them down cool them down not physically
[37:16] you know cool them down in spirit they
[37:19] get
[37:21] proud humility has to be cultivated to
[37:25] prayer
[37:27] practicing putting others before
[37:30] yourself look at Abraham God bless
[37:33] Abraham lot come along lot men fighting
[37:36] up with Abraham men wasn't lot on
[37:38] Abraham men fighting up church members
[37:40] caring with the foolishness and Abraham
[37:43] is the one that said L
[37:46] pick choose and let pites T
[37:50] TOS so I want to challenge you

[37:55] seraphin two Wings cover face two wi
[37:58] cover the feet two wings that fly he
[38:00] said the feet part was
[38:03] humility the head part the wings was
[38:06] reverence and two other Wings was in

[1:33:13] ask it amen and amen God bless you and
[1:33:16] Thanksgiving thanks again for being here
[1:33:18] I want to share something with you
[1:33:21] before we leave
[1:33:24] I want to share with you how we end up
[1:33:26] leaving
[1:33:27] kwall we had built a wooden
[1:33:30] church and we had real powerful worship
[1:33:33] times there and we were seeking to
[1:33:37] expand it so because we were at the
[1:33:40] bottom of a hill we to dig mud dig area
[1:33:44] to sort of get the mud out to kind of
[1:33:47] expand this wooden building the small
[1:33:49] building we look to expand and the few
[1:33:52] of us that were there that doing the
[1:33:54] we were laboring digging out this m and
[1:33:57] everything else and all of a sudden when
[1:34:01] the rains come all the labor that we dig
[1:34:04] and and so on it just caved in now
[1:34:07] what's something we have an objective we
[1:34:10] want to do something for the Lord we
[1:34:11] want to expand we want to add to but
[1:34:14] when I saw it caved in I said no let's
[1:34:18] stop right here I felt led to say let's
[1:34:22] stop it and I want you to take note
[1:34:25] sometime you be doing something and you
[1:34:26] feel blessed with it and you want to do
[1:34:29] something else but if there are certain
[1:34:32] hindrances we have to be sensitive
[1:34:34] enough to know if there's a green light
[1:34:36] or a red light and I took that caveen in
[1:34:40] as a red light and I said stop we are
[1:34:43] not going any further with this we not
[1:34:45] adding to this we are stopping right
[1:34:48] here and I did that and right after
[1:34:51] doing that then the voice of God spoke
[1:34:54] that I'll been sand Grande and the rest
[1:34:57] is history so sometimes in
[1:35:00] our sincerity to do things for God or
[1:35:04] add or do this or whatever you want to
[1:35:06] do we still have to be careful that when
[1:35:09] you see opposition or hindrances come it
[1:35:13] doesn't be like the devil the devil the
[1:35:15] devil we have to be able to be
[1:35:16] Discerning to know if it's God given a
[1:35:19] red light and say stop because I have
[1:35:21] something else for you stop because I
[1:35:23] want to promote you or guide you or
[1:35:25] direct you or is to go on so let's bow
[1:35:28] our heads as we want to close in prayer
[1:35:30] again father God I thank you for this
[1:35:32] time with your people and I pray that
[1:35:35] you would deal with their hearts but
[1:35:37] that's what you're looking at no not
[1:35:39] much your words with your mouths but
[1:35:42] what what beats in their heart God may
[1:35:45] we be filled with the right motive and
[1:35:46] objective with your own desire father
[1:35:50] tonight we spoke about humility you
[1:35:52] resist the proud but give grace to the
[1:35:54] humble may we be known for that give us
[1:35:58] a humble heart a humble Spirit may we
