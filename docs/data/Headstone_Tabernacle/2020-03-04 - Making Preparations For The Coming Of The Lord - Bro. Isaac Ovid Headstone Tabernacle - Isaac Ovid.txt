see AVO say won't you go cry while another so we're calling tonight father know this now calling boy whoa do not pass me man tonight if you have your Bibles would you turn me to one portion of scripture really comes in Matthew 25 and reading from verse 1 thank you the Gideon Matthew 25 and verse 1 then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said to the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are going out but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterward came also the other virgins saying Lord Lord open to us but he answered and said verily I say unto you I know you not watch therefore for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh middle-order the blessing to the reading of his word he may be seated tonight in the presence of the Lord is such a great privilege to be back in the house of the Lord tonight and I really was blessed on Sunday how many were blessed on Sunday the double service the pillar of fire by the Anthony in the morning and brother over it in the evening your thoughts your testimony your life really really really a tremendous tremendous time and we looking for God to continue to do something for us in a special way tonight and I have a little thought tonight making preparation for the coming of the Lord making preparations for the coming of the Lord and in the message looking for Jesus but Abraham said now we want to speak us every meeting so this is my desire tonight about Jesus Christ he's a center for worship the center of our attraction the center of all of our life all that we have and want are and will be is based upon him he was the one who came and gave his life for us scheme down from God out of glory and was made flesh dwelt among us and taken upon him the sin of us all the sickness of us all boy awaits at Calvary and they appeared the price he's worthy of all the praise that can be given him do you feel that way this evening that he is worthy of all the praise that can be given to him and in God had a provided way I'm gonna is gonna touch in a few quotes God likes to show his power not that he has to but he loves to do it that's really powerful so he loves to do it it pleases him in his omnipotence to let his subjects know who he is and and he lets his subjects know who he is by his power but everyone said I'm so happy of it because he showed me his power so we talking tonight about preparations and Mary banner said before God before you want more of God there's got to be more of God to respond to that crave so before God could have a desire in your heart that needs to be filled the the thing that is supposed to fill the desire how to exist before the desire could be there so there had to be some preparations mean before there could be a desire to have what has been prepared can the church say mmm so we're building to something but Abraham said the people in the spirit of the latter days the nations are in the spirit of the end time they got atomic weapons hydrogen weapons all kinds of things because it's a spirit of the deal the people are in the spirit of the endtime the church is moving together under the power and the impact of the Holy Spirit the world is running out yonder and making fun scoffing laughing and they living like the devil every day it's in the spirit of the thing God's getting ready to take his and the devil is getting ready to take his so it's a preparation thing that's going on God is getting ready the devil is getting ready the world is getting ready the church is getting ready the bride is getting ready this preparation that's happening all the time you may not think something is going on but you are getting ready the student who is going to school when you are not studying you are getting ready you're getting ready to fail because if you're not studying you're actually preparing yourself for failure but the person who is studying you're preparing yourself to overcome you're preparing yourself to pass the exam because you're putting things in place because you're getting ready so even when you think you're doing nothing you actually still making preparation because separation is always going on can the church mmm nobody brand himself before God does anything he always prepares for it so God is not now deciding to do something he already prepared for it before he could do anything there has been a preparation made can the church amen but if I said before we go over to fight a wall first we have to prepare for the war you don't go to war without having some type of preparation some type of plan what am I going to do if you want to travel somewhere you got to make preparation you can't travel without a passport you can travel without a ticket so you need to think about the passport before you could travel you have to think about the ticket before you could travel if you need clothes for the environment and you're going to you have to have clothes packed in your bag to meet the conditions that you're about to meet and with a random set to get over there you have to have divine love packed in your bag before you can get over there so you got to make preparations here so that you can meet the condition that exists over there can the church same and so for our title tonight making preparations for the coming of the Lord before you could fight you got to make preparation before you can run a marathon you can't just wake up if you wake up in the morning and you have not been working out there's no marathon that you could run before you go 10 15 20 minutes you don't burn out if you want to run a marathon if you want to run a sprint a long-distance runner those people practice if it's every team every other team they watch what they eat they watch how they rest they do their push-ups they do their setups they do everything because they know what they are preparing to and if we are prepared for if we are prepared for a resurrection if we are preparing for wedding supper if you're prepared for a healing if you're prepared for deliverance there's got to be some preparation that we are making before we leave this place come the church say man or whatever I said before you can come to church you have to make preparations for me to be here this evening I had to make preparations because I didn't get to go back home after I went to work so I had to think this morning before I went to work I had to make preparations because I have to be in church can the church say man Oh what are you getting ready for what are you preparing for do you know what you're preparing for do you know what you're supposed to expect do you know the conditions that must be met when you meet the conditions you got to know it before you meet the conditions you got to know it David didn't even realize what he was preparing for somebody preach back to me David didn't even realize that when he met a lion it was preparation when he met the bear it was preparation so when he meet Goliath he was already prepared he wasn't no warming up in front of Goliath the beer was his preparation the lion was his preparation your trials are your preparation your testings are your preparation your ups and your downs that's your preparation when you read the word that's your preparation when you pray in the night that's your preparation when you come to church that's your preparation when you all come on now oh you're getting it tonight every day is preparation and that's why Satan is mad because today you are more ready than yesterday Oh hallelujah somebody say man Oh glory glory glory glory hallelujah you got to understand that God prepared this thing the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world so God prepared for redemption before that was even here there was a preparation mirror for you to get back over there before you even made a mistake God prepared a way for you to get back to him before you tellenson he prepared a way for you to reconnect to him before you hung up your phone and Jesus he made a way to reconnect your life he paid your bill because you couldn't letter bill yourself so you could be reconnected tonight and the church seemeth and before caucus in revival he's got to have men prepare to take it and put a random speak of there must be a place prepared for the world to be made manifest I'm excited tonight because I feel me already I feel you're ready to see the lame walk I feel you're ready to see the dumb talk I feel we are ready for the opening of the word for every spirit that God predestinated to comfort let me prophesy tonight we have not been getting ready in vain we have not been warming up in the backside of the desert in vain we have been getting ready for seventh on the revival we have been getting ready for resurrection for a restoration can the church Shaymin you may be seated hallelujah glory glory glory glory I'm getting ready what are you doing but I think I'm getting ready why are you here this evening I'm getting ready what are you doing today I'm not going to church I'm getting ready when you wake up in the morning I'm getting ready what did you I'm leaving here some morning when this life is over I'm gonna fly away my bags already packed my bag is already packed if your stare elia to have to get ready we come to theaters tea ready to get the reminder to leave home without your passport don't leave home without your ticket don't leave home without your backpack because anything now we can believe in here we just waited for the call it's time to leave it's time to leave but before we get that call there's got to be a power put into the church so pull your family to pull your loved ones because we're the panem said all that you love all I never loved you we'll be fair jesus said the promise is unto you and to your children so you are getting prepared to prepare them by fire by power by marriage so we can leave this place and the church say man Oh glory he may be seated the children of Israel went out the chilling abyssal would hear the cheering events our world living in pondage didn't know their head from their foot he didn't know how they were gonna make it out they had been in bondage for so long didn't even thought it was a distant memory that a deliverer was gonna come but when Court is ready to have a deliverance he puts a man in there who can handle it and God flipped it so smooth he slipped Moses to be fed clothed and trained in Egypt so that he had the best food he had the best clothes he had the best education and when Cora's more prepared for him you see no common going to the desert and toe-out a little bit what is going to hit already he's making sure the conditions are right he's making sure everything is in place God loves he's a chess player he loves to put this piece here and put this piece here he said not yet not yet not yet but when he's ready here comes Moses coming down into Egypt what Kingdom do you represent the kingdom of the Most High what God do you represent I don't know if you know his name but he said I am that I am sent me come on somebody preach back to me you know what I love the children of Israel dearly have feet but Moses is feed for them was bigger than the tow taker of even oh come on somebody preach back to me the faith in the experience that Moses had was bigger than the tote the collective tote could not destroy Moses feet come the church say Amen because when hero increase the work that was under people they had to have feet in something and they had to trust that Moses knew what he was talking about because it's not a damn mama they see you talking deliverance and the child's got heavier you're talking breakthrough and the pressure increase and Moses has extremos other people hang in there just keep watching God is getting ready he's getting ready to break Pharaoh he's getting ready to set you free he's getting ready to restore your children what your grandfather went through that your children don't have to go through because the deliverer has come I had to wait all these years I was waiting for you to get here I was waiting for children to get here because somebody have to go over to the promised land somebody say man you may be seated hallelujah dear collective doubt let me say it again the collective doubt of the people was not enough to the minister faith Moses had Sarah's feeling about her woman our condition was not big enough the doubt she had could not open the feet that Abraham had come on now somebody speak to me so tonight I'm not talking about the faith of your family the night I'm not talking about the feet of your children I'm talking about your feet being prepared to come to perfect fate because public sale is based on the position that you're standing in and all these the escort has been preparing you for your position as a son and daughter in the economy of God somebody's Amen tonight Oh hallelujah can the church say man David didn't know you may be seated that when he came to play Lee hop timber Ovid preached it that he was being prepared for the throne but you don't just get to the throne you got to understand how the throne room operates you got to understand who has the influence over where the ice bucket is you have to know which fan man is the man who controls the fans you have to understand which security guard but keep certain people out so I'm giving us here playing the harp he is watching what's moving he knows who he gotta talk to he knows who has what influence what is God doing preparing David because one day this little boy is going to be a king he didn't even understand what he was walking into but Cora's making preparations and God has been preparing you in your job in your school all these years every action every action is course preparation from the church say men but Abraham said God hidden sundry times he wanted his children to have the best do you believe that God wants you to have the best yes here's something nice in him he has here something good enough he ain't wanna have now said he said what he what he have the best so if you're not the best yet it means you're still Airy so what God's plan is for your life because he wanted us to have the best so he made preparations so his preparation is for you to have what the best and the church same and so he foreshadowed it through with prophets he had revealed it in Christ and the table is set today and every man and woman that's inviting us all welcome to come to this table for he was wounded for our transgressions and with His stripes we were healed it's all foreseen it's provided and prepared the meal is ready the call is given he foresaw it he made preparations it's God's provided way for you when your soul is hungry can the church Haman and Betty one said call always prepares the people for the events that's just about to happen so everything that's happening right now God has prepared his people for what's about to happen and I know in recent times at all these coronavirus understand that you have a lot of people people living in Salem people making all kind of memes and jokes and comments and thing and it's a real thing it's a real people living in fear I mean one thing that Jesus said a lot was for fear not fear not till about 63 times you see a fear not fear not whenever is fear not you see for God hath not given us a spirit of fear so it is not in the vocabulary of Christians you see I'm afraid er what I mean fact where the branch said be reckless and fearless anybody with me tonight I'm very balanced and some of God's preparation has been so ridiculous to the people who depend on a tree of knowledge because God's preparation has been absolutely ridiculous to the natural mind because a natural mind can conceive the things that are of God because they are foolishness to him and he just think the thing is horrible to say why would God do something can the church say Amen so the whole world is preparing for funeral service but there are some people who are preparing for the resurrection they are preparing for the rapture they are preparing for the wedding supper listen if you want to take part in you Olympics I saw some training years ago for one of these swimmers in the Olympic race and listen it was not just women you know it's every kind of hard exercise and I said for three years you have a routine because you want to win and it lasted me he was this far from it a little bit and the amount of work what is it it's preparation that needs to be made can the church same and so there are people who are preparing because Jesus is coming for bride and by faith and declaring tonight the final call is one behold the bridegroom cometh I'm on the expectation because we have a purpose we have a destination but before we leave here god has got to give us something kind of church shame and now God but everyone said cannot make a decision today and tomorrow come back and make a better decision because his first decision is perfect he never has to change it so we can rest upon whatever God says can the church say Amen it's not something we can rest upon whatever he says because he cannot come and make a better decision so when God called you there's no better plan he could put in place you already call you that's the best plan in place he picked the best out of everybody to give them this great gospel this great message and they're true many churches many groups many countries but they're all called on the one Lord on the one feet under one baptism can the church say man and it's always been God's Way to let his people know what's gonna happen before it happens he doesn't let everybody know he doesn't let though the wool itself no but he lets his children or predestinated people or call out people so we are not surprised can the church see mmm by what's happening in the political around we're not surprised by what's happening in the economic realm we're not surprised by was happening with wars and plagues and rumors of wars before the rain could fall in the days of Noah God had to let nor know what's going to happen he couldn't even judge Sodom and Gomorrah without elected Abraham know what is gonna happen he said how can I hide from Abraham what I'm about to do hallelujah and the relationship God had with Abraham was different than the one he has with you because you are pride you are wife he will have to let you know what he's about to do before he does anything he's gonna make sure that you are in the place you're supposed to be in before anything could happen to you and the church say man his love for you that's how love is love wants to reach out to you to let you know what's gonna happen can the church say Amen so no I was not surprised by when the rain began to fall no one knew how the story would end because God showed him the end because God is the beginning and the end he could show the end of the story before the turn of Israel when pundits quote already told the end before the pondage he said with a mighty hand I'll bring them out he spoke of deliverance before they even went hit abundant come on now somebody preached back to me oh come on now so you don't think God knows all the struggles and the trials you went through and already nobody and looking like and he already kicked that end and true foreknowledge wrote your name in the book that's no devil career is it no situation I can move it no child could destroy it in fact he said what shall separate us from the love and cup pass person pestilence fear nothing so tonight we know how the story's gonna end oh we know our end and we know the devil's end I know my end because I don't have an ending come on somebody preach back to me oh the devil things you know so you gonna end but I have no in there because I always was in corner Oh everything that had a beginning has an end name we never had a beginning because we were always a part of God but the devil had a beginning and he has to have an ending can the church say man this is what you've been preparing for Oh hallelujah Oh blessed be the name of the Lord Oh right now your story might be filled up and looking on the ups and down but God already knows how your story is gonna end Oh at the end of your story I see the rapture at the end of your story I see your family at the end of the story I see a smile on your face at the end know your story us here your gray hair tune back back hurry and know your story when this world wants to close a chapter of your life God is seen is not just a clothes for you it's a shift of your of your location come and go with me to my father's house is that I go to prepare please look for where I am there you will be also can the church Oh hallelujah I don't care many demons you have to fight to be here tonight you are gonna make it I don't care how many Devils you have to fight to see you standing you are gonna make it you're gonna make it anyhow you're gonna make it through the trials you're gonna make it shoot attesa you're gonna make it true the opposition I don't care how much they heat the fiery furnace where there is one time hotter or seven times hot tub we still not gonna bow down because we are being prepared for something go pick the best agents for this last age and put us through the hardest preparation the hottest child the hottest testing Oh glory to God that be who have gone before without us could never be made perfect they are wondering how we could make it because this age is the age of deception this age is the age of false doctrine and false teaching this age is so slippery it's so easy to fall on one side and fall on the next side it was easy in those days you know you believe you don't believe now its doctrine is creted Dogma it's just it's sad and they're over there rooting for us seeing come on Brian come on come to perfection come to your position dear without us cannot be made perfect they are rooting for us oh they did their part in the preparing God did his part in the preparing he sent His Prophet Oh hallelujah to prepare a way for a bride to meet the bridegroom come on now no we have to get ready his wife has made herself ready oh you may be seated so the devil only has a short time to try to stop you every day you make it up in the morning the devil see another day I'm now another day because he knows the countdown is on he knows he listen when the devil knows something is about to change he tries everything in a win when the deliverer was born he's had to kill everybody when Jesus Bush had to kill everybody so when he see the intensity of the attack is him trying to wipe out you heard what the pastor said the boss tried to lick him down did they try to drown him to try to kill him and that's the devil trying everything he could and we all of our testimonies what we have seen on what he have not seen because core dispatch angels to prepare our way for you hallelujah when you don't even see the angels they are at your left they are right in front of you big why because you are son of the king you testin know you a royalty you walk in the school thinking you that's another school boy you think another school girl but you didn't even see the angels who are marching in front of you you sitting in your class and see good morning sir good morning miss and all around that room because of you angels just dispatched around you you kind of fly down a taxi and the interesting not this one not this one not this one and all of a sudden a couple of you don't know why it stopped for you but it was angels of state formation because they have to go where you go you walk and Istanbul you know how you're made at home you don't know what kept you alive but there was something over you what is it God calling from the ladies from the west from the north from the south Lix of fire he already seen the liquor fire hanging over your head one body made up of different members and we are not leaving this place until every man take its place Oh hallelujah you don't hear me tonight can the church say Amen we're not leaving here until every man is in his place when this body is ready to move when every man is in position but a bouncer won't end the last steam could be in Africa somewhere but one day the last name will be called and that last thing will take its place and that last name will meet the pillar of fire and the pillar of fire will move from God above us accord with us to court in US and then when that last one is in its place when we have all come into the unity of the faith into the knowledge of the Son of God it's an a measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ till there's no more you and me but we are one calling us i sha glory to God you may be seated where he is ahead of the body wherever he moves the body moves where he looks the body looks no more man in the middle of the relationship that's why I say the fivefold ministry is unlimited people don't like to hear that boy is a limited ministry because God always wanted a personal connection with you personal connection with me he want no secretary between you and him you don't want nobody else to represent you before him it was Christ was the only water to even relate to you before him can the church amen making preparations for the resurrection for the rapture for the wedding supper for you to receive the Holy Ghost preparations for you to be adopted that's why this persecutor to make sure to watch are you ready yet are you mature enough yet have you died out enough yet have the trials that have come your way position you enough that you are ready to take your position because if you're not ready yet you need some more time of preparation until there's no more of you honors only him hallelujah choral extending is a preparation class you know you never always say there's no finish in school there's no school of marriage it's a school of mature people and all and not get material but God economy there's a school of preparation called trials and testings it's a good classroom it's a very good class you know you know the structure the exam when you think you study for it he did the examiner heavy paper so you say look good I never see this one before see this question before this this is a real problem it's a real situation and unquote we'll have to go over class after class after class until it could pass every exam but right now stomped him I turned his wife against him that's only church against him when they could pass that test hire a lawyer yeah but he could take and strip from you and movie to swim after a while you'll lose your feelings yeah you're you're you're no longer get in different people that lie on your and it is a beater you're dead to yourself hidden Christ the moment you could talk about in and still yeah it should to respond you're itching to respond yeah there yet you're too much alive but when people to talk about you and then it is like you're not here no more before you hit in Christ people lie about you and you're not rated if nu don't need no lawyer you have nothing to defend let them say what they want to see because the person they're talking about is not you you are not a person is seein come

pleases the father you want the father's compliment that's you only compliment our mothers let all of man's would be a lie let whatever they do be alive can the church say man hid in Christ when people looking for you they only seen Jesus so heavy in Christ as I kept playing hide and seek I'm gonna look for you they're not seeing you no more your hidden Christ always see this Jesus they'll look for your any rum shop they can't find your typical you're hidden Christ somebody preached back to me they'll look for you you always used to be here but I can't find you because you're hitting it you're hiding inside of Jesus Christ and the church say man or no more you were only attached the preparation until it's not you it's not me and the more you are like Christ and the more hip you are in Christ is you're shaking off this humanistic realm and this humanistic thinking and you begin to reverse the effects of aging well the thing you're talking crazier because the closer you get to God and the more you get like him anymore your behavior your nature your being your attribute you're thinking be gonna change you walk be gonna change your talk begin a change Oh somebody say man I heard recently they did an experiment with some things some people who like over like 70 80 years old and the sat with him and he started to talk with him and decided to take them back memory lean to when they were younger back tuck me in and in the situation and existed when they were like in their 20s and I found something very interesting before they did the experiment they put some visual things for them to read and stuff and when they started the same no the yen always nineteen whatever take them back after why the city people like I said the see better because their brains had to tell them they're ready back in nineteen twenty and they started to believe that they were no longer in 2000 or whatever so and the experiment showing how powerful the mind is about your state of behavior so that if you think you're young you're is very true when you have a think you're feeling young I said I move a certain way your body actually respond so you're thinking so when you say I'm defeated your body actually is response to that call' of you being defeated when you say I am tired you know you actually reinforce in sadness you signing it you are proving it you you that's why I let you week see and when you begin to speak a certain way all of a sudden so where he's gonna say I'm getting ready I'm getting ready to leave this place I'm getting ready for my healing I'm getting ready for my deliverance I'm getting ready to welcome my son who's back sitting home all of a sudden things begin to move in please because you are walking in this thing you are prophesying in this thing

table that's why butter brown suggests a boob ooh I'll be boys nah no complicated phrase a BB can say boo so you see when you say boo but everything okay because the devil has no power the devil lost his power whatever power he had when Jesus died on the cross he went I'll take the keys of death take the keys of hell you never walk around saying stevia stevia stevia and have no keys to keep anybody locked up anybody can walk out anytime anytime anytime you could walk it up your sickness anytime you can walk out of being depressed anytime you can walk out your frustration anytime you could walk out of whatever's holding you because a devil has no power to keep you locked up hallelujah you may be seated that's what he does we spill over that woman who welcome to the Prophet with the crutches and before the Prophet and pray for her she just took the crutches and handed to him what it is she walked out of that situation her feet rose to such a level did she realize that there was nothing stopping her there was nothing holding her back from climbing what was rightfully hers and when you could see that there's nothing holding you back from your deliverance from your revival from your pouring from your family from your pretty truth oh it's a choice a piece of the satisfaction Oh hallelujah hallelujah making preparations because you are going to be perfect so there has to

I have that brotherly kindness bring the trial and come and watch poorly kind of school for its prepared not a short an actus preparation come to church say man Oh hallelujah hallelujah but the random said God bring in his turn out to the chaos of Egypt from the tactus of Egypt he brought him out to take them to his promised land and on the road he was making preparations for everything they had need of when they had need of something called had a preparation for it no I had to make preparations God said it's gonna rain know what consider and say well in garena know however no he had to make preparations and his preparations sure he actually believed because if he didn't believe he wouldn't do anything but because he believed he started to prepare Esther had to make preparations to go and see the king they had to get ready to go in front the King David had to make preparations the father of the prodigal son his son was lost his son had walked away but he didn't just sit back there he was always looking on for his son because he knew that there was something about his son that would bring him back home my father knows her son he knows that when things get really bad that boy is gonna come back home so that father was looking for his son every day and the moment he claims him he said walk a little different but that still my boy he didn't call you not coming back the way he left but that still my boy he looks like he's been through something but that's still my boy he said go go kill the fatted calf go put on some music go up in the room he had to make preparations hallelujah preparations for what we expect him can the church say man and we are an expectation for a seventh on the revival we are an expectation for the coming of the Lord Simeon was an expectation to see the Christ the Bible said Simeon was just under vote and the only way you can get the Holy Ghost is to be just under vote just like the 3,000 souls who were just under vote on the Holy Ghost fell upon him Cornelius was just a new vote and prayed all the time a memorial went up to heaven for his prayers are you building a memorial for your prayers that you could be recognized as a prayer warrior are you looking for something I you default are you running around in another world are you not sure where you're standing you don't know where you're at what are you looking for but Simeon was just and devout waiting for the consolation of Israel and we are waiting for the consolation of the bride a power of God what dynamics to the mechanics and the Holy Ghost was upon Simeon and the Holy Ghost is upon you tonight hallelujah it was revealed to him by the Holy Ghost that he could not see depth and it is revealed to us by the Holy Ghost Ruth a word that we shall not seek that we shall not all sleep it was revealed to us that we are gonna be made perfect it was revealed to us that we are going to be adopted is revealed to us that it's gonna be a power come into your life not just to the church but into your life into your home into your bedroom on your job there be a power that you are gonna have not just the church but you are gonna have your individual inheritance you will have power you will have authority if you shall see this is not the preacher but maybe you if you shall sake and the church say man Simeon was old Simeon was tired Simeon's friends maybe they stopped coming to church but not Simeon because he was under expectation to see the Lord's Christ could you imagine the critics simians critics the Sadducees the Pharisees though whoever it was in church a long time since Simeon who do you think you are you that you wanna see the Christ you take all these years you think you are important see me another high priest you know Eliot a deacon you know to you what do you think this hand the church semen but nothing could stop Simeon from getting up every day and being way supposed to be adventure today is the day so he was making preparations because he didn't know what day would come that the Lord's Christ will come walking into the temple and we don't know what they will come that'll be your deal for the Holy Ghost your day for your breakthrough so every day not just services but every day we make preparation hallelujah because we are under expectation but they Branham an expectation so he sent here Noah he was expecting a terrine so he made preparations for the rain he said Oh make preparations as long as you hear God's would then make preparation for it to happen and wait under expectation or that makes me start feeling religious the thing that God said will be expecting it and if God has promised a revival here we're gonna have it let's make ready for it if God promised to heal let's make ready fit you don't have to make preparation for your healing kind of Church say man but if I said Abram and he started to make preparations for this child because if you're really expecting a child where do US attorney and would you have to make the preparation so whenever I'm bored crib and buy your toy or whatever see by he's sure in that decision is he he he really crazy yes that what he were said Iran already believe this thing you know people could do one levy brambly because his life testified he believed it wrong way go this morning to the baby store where we're sitting again after the groceries are going to the baby store I have to make up something your dear in here our child comment oh yeah see here I've already lost it now you know or if I'm going through way I mean when he was young for years he and CH on average have no ear on all of us and you know working when he rung a rail and Sarah who couldn't have a child rail all they bolted him walking around the mall happy happy happy buying baby this baby this baby this baby this yeah after year every city baby room because Abraham don't know what he egg on coming no think about it go ahead and tell him is 25 years so when he brought me here at Iran study car one time went straight to the baby store because feet without works is dead and Abraham is the father of feet and he staggered not at the promise of God but was strong even Prince to God so when Abram I feel a feeling great you have a grab a child and be critics I will hear what you you know know after a few months Abraham could a satyr it was some of us after a few months you say oh gosh I wonder if I might ask you know but Abraham the next year because you don't have this is a year and year after tonight this is the and yeah after year Abraham going you know which here and and I don't know how this is it's a serious thing you know because it's against human nature to maintain hope against hope because it's not as if getting younger every year and getting worse I want to think about it every year getting worse every hit harder to what he believed twenty years ago and yet 21 reach Syria you ready see we're moving a little slower she did 20 years ago yeah already let me go on my next story because God said we gonna have a child why didn't make him preparation fit but in all of a sudden when at 25 years come you see the unveiling of the manifestation of the feet and they realize it was worth it for all hallelujah was worth it all and God didn't tell us what year he was gonna fill us he didn't tell us what he is gonna call he didn't tell us what year he's gonna keep you to break through what he egg when I get your new house what a yeah you're gonna bless you abundantly he didn't tell you that but he wanted a walking don't trust them and keep on living and fit it's gonna be well all is well remember that that lady whose child died and she was heading to the Prophet and they asked her what is going on the area recognized that there the breaking his speed limit and they're gonna have demerits of your license you say all as well all is well can the church say man so if God has promised a revival let's make ready for it if God has promised a here let's make ready for it Oh hallelujah if Jesus said the work that I do shall you do also let's make ready for it move out everything get ready we're right in time it'll seem foolish well you not know you say well how it's gonna happen in a deal like this and when all this I don't care what anything contrary is to that it's wrong we can't see it I see no hope of it look like but if God said so let's do it anyhow because God said so it'll happen anyhow I'm expecting it can the church say ma'am so I'm on the expectation for revival so I'm making preparation for revival that's what my expectation is I'm looking for revival I'm looking for something to move I'm looking for the spirit to move in the face of what is happening everywhere I'm under expectation for God to do something because we have had a miniature the word for all these years and the letter killeth but the Spirit is what gives life so we're looking for life to come into my life into your life life to come into your family life to come into the church a revival disturb the season but I bands had already planted and nurtured same an old-fashioned singing old-fashioned dancing old-fashioned shelton old-fashioned plain old-fashioned praising give me old-fashioned week and the church amen Oh what but I've answered every five will causes five things do you remember is a verifiable bring souls to Christ bring the church back to us the spiritual condition it should be in it brings back close communion with God it brings back fellowship among the churches it brings back praying for the sick these are the five things that revival brings are you looking for a revival in the church in your life kind of church say ma'am but if I said that's what we need to know in making a valley full of ditches that's what really tonight is a good old-fashioned backwoods sin killin sky-blue religion bleach under the power of the Holy Ghost can the church say man Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I'm not gonna be too much long with you oh whatever if I were to revive the seeds are planted in you sow the seeds had to be planted you know the devil has no power so he can't attack with power I can't attack the power so the devil's only weapon is to try to come against the wood to try to plant seeds of error but the pride cannot be deceived go out to it all easiest situation had to come so that we'd have the right individuals who would steal we do it friends if you're not making plans with a rapture start making plan to the tribulation if you do have a plan clear up to you need of tribulations of ever because this whole gospel is on a plan for us to stay in church then I plan for to become the best churchgoer Abbess to it it's not to be the best believer you know it's a plan to leave here you don't want to be a good graduate of astronaut school what are you I am I graduate top of the class you need to be on the astronaut you need to be in the in the in the rocket you know outside the rocket taking pictures with your rocket all these years he closes you come to the rocket is a picture you're past the class where you're not any Rockets the goal is to leave here can the church say man Oh hallelujah hallelujah let me get ready to wind down touch the scripture that I read on a familiar scripture but it's really a scripture of preparation of getting ready blessed be the name of the Lord then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took the alarms and went forth to meet the bridegroom five wise and five foolish all virgins all holy all go into church all in the message all have the books all have the tapes all nor the expectation all nor the requirement all understand that the token is a life and a token supposed to be displayed and they have all these things but some were wise and some foolish all have the inspiration some inspiration some type of inspiration but some wise and some foolish all have access to the prophetic message all of access to Scripture but some wise and some foolish Jesus himself settled the debate about who is wise and who is foolish he said deal of her foolish took their lamps and it took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps in other words the wise made preparation there was something more that they did they were already they did something more they put something else in please if you're going on a trip you have to make preparation I put them gas in your car you have a car we have no gas we're going doors that were foolish took their lamps with no oil it's like it start up your car and you have no gas but those that were wise have a car but they fill it up with gas and they a lot of people sit along in message churches and they think they're wise virgin we couldn't understand this mystery of the oil and this is the key of the matters but always said let's keep the main thing the main thing how books have tips have revelation have understanding of the scripture didn't know what the expectation didn't know about Rome didn't know about the plagues then normal defiles first will second but simple they have all these great knowledge and mysteries and revelations but you know what there are many Bible scholars who know all this stuff too but oil in the lamp oil in the lamp but a Branham taught us the oil represents the Holy Spirit the oil is in the church he always had a movement he always had a belief the oil isn't under a pastor that's turn the oil the oil is the Holy Ghost and it has to be in something can the church say Amen so they're different between the wise and the foolish was not what church you go into not who your pasta is not what teams you play in church and if you're playing tapes in the children and who is preaching and who is not preaching and if it's live or if it's not live or how long in the message or how long in church and what do you believe in it you really love God that's the toil how many quotes you read there's only one difference the wise had oil and the foolish had no oil every Sunday people sit in church and in that church is wise and foolish because what separates our wives from the foolish is the wise are putting things in place by ensuring that they have oil in their lamps they do a little more they did a little extra they're getting ready they get them prepared they don't know when they don't know how they don't know why but they get already somebody say man but I ran to the extra oil is the difference he said the difference is too token the token is a life it's a virtue sits at unless it's voices it's charity because only the life could be received by the groom can the church hymn and making preparations for the coming of the Lord it's not reading books that's on the preparations he's adding oil hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I said it some time ago I said go auto just for Mary teeth on the wood day and night to meditate on something you have to know it before I can meditate on it so reading the wood it will really Bradley Bible like is it newspaper you know but after you read it you meditate on it you read the prophet message and you know your meditate on what you read how is this helping me how is this applied to my life what do I need to change Lord I want to be more like you you're going to pray a DM naked thinking you're here sermon tonight Lord I want the extra oil I want to have too much I would have eat I want to have so much island I don't risk I don't want to be at risk and it's doing a convent I want to have everything I don't want to believe somebody would I want to believe only what so open no I have my unbelief take away the top perform surgery tonight in my heart I don't want to measure it by my ruler I want your ruler Lord can the church say manases is this helping anybody tonight it's a reality in your workplace it's a reality in your house is a reality if nobody else wants it you want the extra oil can the church say man but a Branham in the token he said the differently life and death was a token which are my life and death now you know because with all these plagues come he said touch not my anointed touch that anyway the seal of God it ever was a time to make sure you have oil it's know if there ever was a time to make sure that your walk is right with God it's know if there ever was a time to put the skills of life and where your life against the word is know and see if you come up wanting hallelujah hallelujah and so will it be at the coming of the Son of God when he brings the bride out of the church heard what he said bride out of the church people believe that sitting in a message church means you are bride there's nothing to support that don't let any minister confuse you attendance in church doesn't equal pride people have put their faith in men faith and systems fit in Church have hid in court have faith in coat you must have the token personally displayed hallelujah but a bad sense now listen close this evening and see that isn't a token would be the difference there has got to be a difference so the only difference between the bride between the wise and the foolish would be the token you can have all the knowledge that's not the difference God is not comparing knowledge against knowledge your understanding of the sixth seal and the seventh seal endure the wars and the plays and the vials and the woman when God says the day I'm looking for the difference he said where's the oil somebody could come into the message for a war month and have oil somebody for 30 years and have look at the century and he didn't grow up under the church even grew up in the temple but when he came with a knee to Jesus in all of Israel I haven't seen Fiat like this under semi Cayenne Obadiah and you sat on the temple for forty years and he have no fear this Centurion has more feet in Luther's day the extra oil the difference the token of his day was the just shall live by feet those who broke out of what they were in and accepted that message apply the token for the ID they did the extra for deity they invested what it took that needed to be invested to reflect what was required for that day they will prepare to meet the challenge of the oil for that day they had the extraordinary seeming but Abraham thought it was the same hole he goes in every age so Luther had enough of the Holy Ghost for justification then Wesley had word luta had passed some more there was a new difference because the season change so you couldn't go over to measure that you had from looters D into a CD you have to have more can the church say man the Lutheran's Wesley's message became the extra Wesley's message required more preparation more revelation a greater experience you have to know get the oil to meet the requirement because we're at brendham talk--i there was a blending in justice when John was there and Jesus was there there was a shift John is still preaching but those who saw Jesus started to follow Jesus and they were those who were still under John's ministry not realizing that the season had changed in so much so when Paul in acts 19 goes about he says unto what were you baptized hunter John's baptism because John didn't stop baptizing when Jesus came on the scene Jesus was baptized and he went on in his ministry was coming into view and and John said I must decrease so that his ministry could increase and so it was Luther is fading away and then Wesley's message slipping in and extra oil there were those who had whole long to looters teaching but this is all we know this is all we have this is how it's been this is what Luther told us but there was oil that have to be put into lamps to meet the requirements of the age are you with me as we was one watch but around you as one watch feed into the next watch those that were all right in Luther's age had to make a choice to accept or reject the extra that Wesley brought it required a new level of preparation a new level of dedication it required a new level of sanctification because his message was one of sanctification the believers who will Luther search and understand the sanctification thing but know you have to be more ready more prepared more dedicated more consecrated more so loud you have to give up more things because there was no oil required can the church same and anybody with me tonight I'm almost finished then the Pentecostal scheme and the gifts were restored and tongues and these things it was more extra another level another requirement another level of preparation another level of dedication and it's a blending in and in the height of the Pentecostals as their eye exploding here comes a little profit brings the food the full light every mystery revealed and in the fullness of the world now requires a fullness of dedication a fullness of surrender a fullness of the spirit of match the fullness of the word because when a Branham taught that from that first age until the prophetic age told the conductor the wood had been lost and the power that should have been floor into the church couldn't Florida way it was supposed to but when it's little 20th century Kentucky prophet began to preach here see the discrepancy serpent see the citizen ear with the shocker adoption begin to pull these little things together and slowly slowly under the devil's eyes and everything else how much is going on he was gathering here from Genesis from Revelation pulling the pieces together trying to catch the attention of four people catch the attention of virgins as it were but within their wise and foolish there were those who see the man who see the gifts who see what he performed and those who are listen to the words because I recognize is not even by the Branham he's pointing to Jesus it's about Jesus Malachi 4 and she used to talk on the life of Jesus Christ once to 25 others five musicians no get ready while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept while God has been preparing because the bridegroom went to prepare with Alma making preparations for the coming of the Lord while quarters preparing they all slumbered and slept two different words slumber and slept and not the same wherever I'm type it out SEP fall asleep slumber waiting almost dozing as it were different sleepin already did but abandoned brother tapped the bride from the Seven Cities are sleeping but slumber means dormant inactive not moving waiting for something so it must mean the living bride is slumbering slumbering in the message with books and tips slumbering in the message with the power because the word is power no wonder that prophecy it takes something to to give the bride seat sorry to wake up someone is still into action can the church say man o the telling Christ suppose arise we who are alive we who are slumbering that's why but it Branham said and people fight this cord the bride has done had a revival yet she has been no revival there no manifestation of God stir the bride we are looking for it it'll take those seven unknown turn this back there to wake her up again he will send it he promised it I'm under expectation for it I'm making preparations for it I'm almost finished in other words a manifestation of behold the bridegroom cometh will be seven thunders uttering their voices I'm trimming time because at the midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him Oh hallelujah seven angels come now from eternity the bridegroom is coming interview surrounded by his entourage along the journey in their just screamed out in every age it was one message behold the bridegroom cometh but the last messenger screaming out his soft message coming closer not seeing the the prophet coming the prophet has already come but tonight behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him behold the bridegroom cometh signals the end of preparation because after preparation you either ready or you're not ready when the examination comes after form five you are five years to prepare when the exam hits the front of your table you have no more time to prepare you could only put down a pair for what you know is here you're ready or you're not ready behold the bridegroom comment message screaming out signals the end of preparation signals it time to go signals it's time to show so what you have to prove so what you have earned sure your approval that God himself has identified with you now do you identify with him but now he has put his seal his stamp of approval to say I am identified with him identified with her yes my spirit flowing freely I'm in control of this one I'm in control of that one come to church seaman proving your preparation has been right proving your efforts have been right proving your Labour's have not been in vain proving your sacrifice and your coming to church has that built for nothing by giving you a seal a sign given you a stamp seeing well done my good and faithful servant you have fought a good fight you have kept defeat can the church see man the clock is ticking the scream is going out behold the bridegroom cometh there's only seconds left friends these plagues are not something that is a once in a time thing it's it's coming the world is men's hats feeling for fear in that deal look up your Redemption draweth nigh not look to the doctor not look to the mask not look to that is this and this world is finished they could cry save the planet how much sieve they want see the environment how much you want this enzyme is gonna burn because there was a purifier for his sons and daughters to move through the land can the church say men then all the virgins arose and trimmed their lamps trim the excess trim the excess tonight trim the lamps has cut everything out tonight that will cause your life to not burn as bright as it should lamb trimming time I know it's a message you know but it's a shaking time as a reminder tonight that he always leaked anything no because core will not allow his righteous to perish with the wicked that's why he's having rapture to pull them out before he brings judgment because he has warned and warned and warned and warned because he could never bring judgment without first bringing warning this message is a message of warning and judgment to see what you do with this word because her you handless what is a measure of your character and your understanding of the need to be prepared can the church say Amen trim the excess all the virgins so listen carefully wise and foolish trim an accessor it's coming up to a close race I'm almost finished Oh all the footage in the road but occurence all trim their lamps all cut off things from the world all trim the excess oil making an effort it's a real effort in not playing Church they want to be right and look around the land and their people who love God they love the message and love the word doing the best he could but that's not the question is there oil in your lamp and it's after the trimming it's only after the trimming the question comes the foolish said to the wise give us of your oil because in the act of trimming in the act of cutting away what should not be there it allows you to look back at your life and reconsider have I done all I should do to make this rupture have I done everything I should do to make this cut and in cotton you realize there's only then when you take time to look in the mirror of the word and inside to realize I'm short of something I'm Maria I'm missing something after 30 years in a message I have knowledge but have no oil of information but no oils I have revelation but no oil and no mysteries and I don't have oil and no history and I have no oil I know where God brought us from but I have no oil and no bride history but I have no oil I'm living right but I've trimmed and I have no oil I have a desire to serve God but I have no oil but the band said he shakes at the D way young people come to the altar and they pray but across the line in other words it's too late no salvation left for them because the cry has gone out there's no more time to prepare the foolish said to the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are worn out what little they had listen carefully they had something but it didn't have enough because what they had went out so it's not that they didn't have or they never had something you know they didn't have enough have you done enough but the PanAm scream that have I done enough have you done enough have we done enough but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough the issue becomes enough for us and for you but going rather to them that sell and buy for yourself and why they want to buy what is painful because this shows friends the desire to do right this is not these people want to go into the world they're not trying to go and drink and smoke and party they're looking now for oil but it's actually too late they no catch a revelation of what they should have been doing all along except that they caught the revelation to lead because they were comfortable being virgins comfortable having what they thought was enough and not realizing that there was more preparation that was required and that this preparation should have been happening but was not happening maybe they were too busy maybe they were too busy I'm challenging us I'm challenging me I'm telling you tonight well they went to buy the bridegroom came and V the already went in are you ready tonight went with him to the marriage and the door was shut did that already be that already and afterward came all to the other virgins in Lord Lord open to us but he answered and said verily I say unto you I know you not all your years in the message and the peer you get for it is I know you not because you did not pass the exam that was required what's there for watch therefore is a this is a warning now about being vigilant about being on point about being ready about not ever getting slack about not ever getting comfortable watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh foolish virgin those that truly believe that they have what it takes they believe that they're going to make it but when the call goes out they realize they don't have enough they had all they had
