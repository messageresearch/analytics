from the Lord that's th say the Lord oh hallelujah praise God Amen Hallelujah you may be seated so we're not here to make up numbers we here just to gather just to gather together we're here because we have a promise to fulfill we have a word to confirm we have a god that is alive hallelujah oh glory to God waiting for individuals to prove that God to bring forth that God and he will come forth he will do so right early oh blessed be the name of the Lord see we're here because we identified with every promise that brother brandham brought with the seven seal with the seven tunders with the bright Revival every promise you could speak we are identified with it we are The Last Remnant upon the face of the earth the earth is populated by Blackness and and seeds and church members but God promised the last day bride to come forth and I believe we are part of that Bunch we not going to be sitting here warming Church bench for the next 20 years there's going to be a resurrection there is going to be a Rapture there is going to be a wedding supper and I believe that I'm going to fight for that amen praise God Amen Hallelujah glory to God Amen just before before the speaker comes this morning this is tur upon me to read to you from second-handed robe he's talking about Elijah on Earth God's prophet of the hour God has never left himself on Earth without a witness God always have somebody somewhere a person get his hands on somewhere God has a man that he can lay his hands on now watch that was a Prophet Elijah he got a man to lay his hands on but watch this now but he's got more than one man now he has many men that he can lay his hands on because we are coming onto the Gathering time or the Harvest time so when come to the Harvest and Gathering time one man show is over could to hear a bigger Amen in the house when come to Gathering time it have too much a harvest for one man to reap if we wait on one man they har rotten on the tree but we need many men and I believe one of those many men is going to come forth this morning to minister to you this morning oh hallelujah praise God Amen for he has got more than one man now he has many men he can lay his hands on because we are coming down to the Gathering time the Harvest Time Genesis was the plant of the seed and has been maturing and and 6,000 years have been the maturing of the Harvest Time and it's Gathering time now all great things that started to the greatest time that anyone ever aged lived is this time it's a shaken time it's a troubling time for Sinners but it's a marvelous time for Christians because we know we are packing up we are gathering the last efforts together to go home and meet the Lord and the last one he said now watch he said whenever you get licked and realize you are licked and when you come back to humble yourself and get weak and find out you're human and this is the problem people feel they're not human so they can't get licked but he said when you come and recognize you're human and there's none of your intellectuals can do it human weaknesses will never be used of God God by the human weaknesses pours himself into you then he uses himself you just become an instrument you get yourself out of the way so welcome brother Jan and we going to welcome all the ministers brother Jesse and his wife praise God brother Paul brother Ean my Lord welcome

uh this great honor I've got to meet a few of the uh Brethren the ministers had a good time with brother Con in fact on the flight can you imagine out of the whole airplane he found his seat next to me can you imagine that right next to me brother over so we had a Time amen just talking and and praising God and people must have wondered what was going on but but we know amen amen it's under those seals amen praise the Lord and uh a great time with brother Raymond last night talking and got to meet a few of the the Brethren this morning and so very good to to be with you the Bible says iron sharpeneth iron and I want to bring greetings to everybody without exception uh from my dear wife sister Monica she couldn't make it with me but doubt she'll catch up with the meeting and uh want to say very big blessings from LCA in London brother Gerard as well he he would have loved to be back in Trinidad but so many of the Brethren sending greetings to you and uh on behalf of them all receive them in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you amen hallelujah very very happy to uh to to know the season to know the time to know the day we're living in and I think the pastor has summarized it beautifully when he when he gave those comments the sons of God have to step out there and and to overcome all the the the stuff and to just whatever happens it's it's not going to fail God is going to be with us now I've I've chosen a title today which I believe will provide us with a sort of a keynote and it's called Adam where are you and I hope it will supply the ministry with some uh that they can pick something from it and be a blessing shall we stand to our feet as we go to the uh the Blessed scripture and um I pray that you would be greatly greatly uh uplifted in this great convention here amen Genesis 3:8 is where we're starting and uh that is the first scripture the second one over in the Book of Revelation Revelation 108 so if you can get a marker in those two places uh we'll uh we'll go forward amen Genesis 38 and uh Revelation chapter 10 and verse 8 which will dovetail with the in pration of these meetings and they heard in verse 8 the voice of the Lord God Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day now and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the Trees of the garden now and the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him him where art thou there's my title and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself that's the the reading out of Genesis we now go to the Book of Revelation 108 amen and uh the and the voice which which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hands of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth verse N I went to the angel I said unto him give me the little book and he said to me take it eat it up it shall make your belly B but it shall be in your mouth sweet as honey amen let us pray gracious and almighty God we take these two scriptures Genesis and Revelation Satan hates them because it shows how he started and how he finishes dear God we thank you for this Alpha and Omega and dear God may we be uplifted and strengthened as we approach this sacred word we give you the glory glory and the honor now in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen God bless you you can be seated praise be to God hallelujah what a what a great uh responsibility has fallen on our shoulders Adam had it you know he he wasn't carrying a Bible uh there wasn't a King James under Adam's arm but he had something called the title deed of redemption it was in the man he wasn't you know packing a book you know this is my little I use this on the streets when I preach amen my little preaching Bible amen and uh Adam had no book there was no written book but it was just in him it was just part of him now he lost that it was too big too important too consequential for it to go into the hands of Satan amen so it went straight from Adam to God on the throne stayed there a long time this title deed now the only person worthy of taking that back was our precious Lord Jesus Christ amen and he came took that book and opened all Seven Seals amen the lamb opened that amen next thing we find the same book in the hands of a mighty Angel hallu and he's coming down to where all this belongs which is back down on the earth so he he comes down with this little book open and then he comes to this spot we've just read and then the last segment the last portion The Last Action has got to be where John takes that book am type of the bride and he's going to eat that book bitter as it may be Hallelujah he's got to eat it now this is a huge step yes as we go back not just to a blessing not just to the gifts of the Spirit but to the authority that was back in Eden praise be to God and accordingly we find ourselves predictably understandably in a great battle in fact it's the greatest battle that was ever fought is what we are fighting right now the enemy is loosing everything he can because if this ever gets manifested brother we are going straight back to Eden again amen hallelujah if this works then Satan is completely finished it means that the original takes over and the squatter goes praise be to God hallelujah now when the stakes are high the weapons are big you look at these guys in Mexico and these what they call drug cartels the stakes are high if they get arrested they they could die the stakes their weapons aren't small amen they use machine guns Bazookas bombs whatever they need to do to defend themselves because the stakes are high so you find that we are living in a time now where the stakes are high we should not be surprised when the enemy tries everything in his Arsenal everything to stop you everything to hinder you everything to bind you praise be to God he will use if necessary bazooka he will use machine guns he will use demonic Powers but none of these things shall separate us from the love of God which is in christes Jesus charity never fails glory to God thank you Jesus if this works he's using weapons of mass deception amen if this gets through the enemy is finished it's that reminds me of the days of Moses if Moses got through that River Israel would be delivered amen every crocodile came to stop him yeah but the crocodiles were Bound by predestination Hallelujah they came to that Ark they couldn't touch him they came with a big old don't fear crocodiles crocodile got a small brain only one megabyte amen so you don't have to worry about a crocodile amen and they are bound by predestination they came to bite they came to kill they couldn't do it Moses got through praise be to God so Church bride brother sister don't let any devil stop you make up your mind I'm going through I don't care what barrier that the enemy puts in front of you that barrier cannot defeat predestination praise the Lord I feel like saying Satan be careful amen praise the Lord can we clap those hands as we say Amen praise be to God glory to God be seated as we approach you look at our Lord Jesus Christ as he went to Legion full of full of demonic Powers he never had a a smooth ride he had a rough ride that's right and the sea was full of demon demonic Powers but he had to go through that roaring sea to get to Legion and what I want to say to you uh brothers and sisters is that there's one enemy that we all have to watch and that's your worst enemy that's yourself we have to watch ourselves and say Lord amen I don't even trust my understanding I just believe your word if the prophet said it I believe it and that settles it there should be no disputes the prophet was Vindicated amen I've got a couple of quotes as we approach this great subject of Adam where are you and I pray that it will inspire you out of the message of Israel and the church what I quote here of course if you're interested in these quotes you'll be taking key phrases anyway so I won't go laboring with paragraph and Pages you'll take the key phrases amen and we just want to read from this which says my out of Israel and the church look at the nature of a sinner amen hiding hiding is a nature it's a nature that a sinner has in fact as soon as something goes bang people go they keep still because that is the first camouflage is to keep still and people go to church and they still hide young people go to church and they still hide it is the nature did you catch that word nature to hide we can boldly talk like this thank God we know about another nature amen which is not interested in hiding it is the nature called the divine nature praise be to God and so it should have been Adam calling God but it was Adam hiding there was some barrier there amen that Adam had to hide behind God was calling Adam amen it was Adam hiding God calling Adam you see that's the nature of a sinner to hide and to run away you see it that's the nature hide get behind something amen that's always that Amazing Grace calling God always seeks manall man never seeks God it's always God seeks you aren't you glad that God found you amen aren't you glad amen praise be to God so we have a different nature amen that is not interested in hiding it is interested in projecting amen come on now amen not hiding amen amen but what it was in Jehovah Jare he goes on to say Adam Adam where are you and Adam was hiding that's his nature today amen man's nature is not to come out and just confess his sins but to hide behind something and just watch him sit in a convention or a meeting just hiding young people just go to church and they sit there can I ask you a question if I were to give you a tree a tree and say where is the best place to hide it I wonder which young person would have the solution to that shall I tell you the answer unless somebody has the answer the best place to hide a tree is in a forest how many C it if you have a forest you won't know where the tree is and that's where people hide in church they come to church and they do all the right things and they do this but they're still hiding maybe during this convention we'll come out differently say Lord no more hiding no more hiding Lord I'm different from today glory to God thank you Lord he says man's nature is not to come he says to hide behind something he says no man comes to me except my father first called him now this nature he says is still there future home he said this nature he says you can't even repent for it he said it takes the fire to burn out of you you can't repent for what Adam did it takes the fire to get that out amen it's like the old uh I don't know if you say torus or tortoise amen water won't move him knocking won't move him but the fire will bring the taught us out of his shell is that right praise be to God you can't you can't repent for what Adam did it's only the fire that can cleanse you from that original sin Adam Adam where are you this is a message called lord having a shadow praise be to God it goes on to say Adam Adam where are you that strain still lies in man instead of coming out you know getting to the altar go calling to the pastor talking truthfully not not speaking in in uh code in a way this brother said but speak the truth in love amen just just be honest and open and and forthright amen and that strain still lays in man instead of coming out he will try everything in the world and if the church gets too strict he will change churches instead of making things right that strain still lays in man we are fighting a great battle here we have to fight the enemy on the outside and ourselves on the inside and we have to be truthful and say Lord change me change me now Hallelujah change me even now Lord even in this convention change me Lord is my prayer you're fighting the inside you're fighting the outside amen what's happening in a message called the deity of Jesus Christ amen men and women it's time you found out who you are amen hujjah hallelujah are you ready for this one the devil is trying to hide you back Hallelujah to tell you that you are some little downtrodden something you are not you are Sons and Daughters of God praise the Lord can we shout Amen to that deity deity is not in heaven it's in you Hallelujah I know you think I'm crazy but let me tell you something brother when you realize that almighty God Lives in You amen Immortal Life the life of God in the human being there's no more hiding brother then you can come out of your hiding and then you can say ohmighty God I praise you if you're wrong just say you're wrong amen just just be open no hiding no no covering no fig leaves but just coming out in the open saying Lord fill me with the Holy Ghost Hallelujah give me the Holy Ghost Lord even in this convention Fill Me Lord nothing to hide praise be to God St John 3:21 he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in God but Adam and Eve together this is the law continue it's called law Amen in there he says uh the Holy Spirit God's Great Holy Spirit is moving in the hearts of the people bringing that Eve and that Adam together again in their perfection God's holiness God's Perfection something had to substitute the guilty man's place and that was the lamb amen that he was was killed that was Jesus Christ speaking in a figure and there he brought lamb skins that's the only way you could have a lamb skin is if the lamb died that is God's provided way Hallelujah and no devil can stop that that is God's provided planu he says uh he he he he brought the lambskins he throw them into the bush and Adam and Eve put them on and here they come out to stand before father God praise be to God that's God's provided way Hallelujah that's my Foundation there Hallelujah aren't you glad that he has provided a way for you hiding won't help because it's all going to come out any way hiding won't help amen we've got to come clean if we make something if we make a mistake say so am and then God can put some skins on you Hall amen if you did something wrong yesterday today say so say Lord I'm sorry and just walk in the light as he is in the light Hall we walk in the light such a beatiful light oh comes where the d drop of Mercy shines bright a little bit louder now shine [Music] oh Jesus the light of we have to break through that barrier we have to get through that barrier am and I believe in this convention we're going to get through amen and I'm preaching to myself as well I'm going to get through this convention Hallelujah to meet the pillar of fire hallelujah amen amen no more hiding amen come out in the open amen no more just sitting in warming the seat but worshippers worshippers amen hallelujah coming out in the open Lord put those skins on me clothe me Lord praise the Lord you can be seated let's look at a businessman his name was zakus amen he there was a barrier amen he had a he wanted to see Jesus amen but he wanted to kind of do do it secretly amen so zakus climbed up into a tree amen you'll find the Propet called him the business man zakus and he was up there he thought good nobody can see me nobody would know I'm here the prophet talked about him several tapes he came the Lord came was zakus he was hiding up there amen but you cannot hide from the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ amen when the Lord came by zakus he never said hm somebody's around here oh I wonder if somebody is up the tree our Lord Jesus Christ never even said hey you he called him by his name he said zakus come down I must come to your house today Hallelujah zakus no more hiding no more hiding come and meet me in the house praise the Lord who can shout hallelujah amen make haste come down amen I'm coming to your house today praise the Lord zakus had to go past that barrier to meet the Lord's provided way amen my mind goes on to the great Apostle Peter he said to the Lord he said to the Lord I will never deny you Lord you see enthusiasm enthusiasm doesn't always have power you need the Holy Ghost to give you the power he said Lord I will never deny you and the Lord said listen let's get one thing straight I have prayed for you am before you even crows you will deny that you know me three times amen Peter he went during that faithful night when the Lord was arrested and he warmed himself by the fire people start to say we know you what was Peter doing he said what are you talking aboutall they start to say yeah we know look your accent betrays you hallelujah what was Peter doing and then and then they the woman said look we know you we know and he start to XY Z amen amen because he was so Under Pressure because his hiding place was being exposed Peter realize there's no time for hiding and then what happens later on Peter understand he wept bitterly that's because the hiding doesn't work amen amen The Hiding doesn't we have to come in the open hallelujah amen if somebody's in this meeting and you feel bound break that barrier just say Lord I can't just sit here anymore oh I've got to praise you I've got to worship you today amen my brother Glory Hallelujah hallah and that's why when our Lord met up with Peter later soon after he said Peter let's get one thing straight lovest thou me lovest thou me and he said a third time lovest thou me because he had to check him out he had to make sure this hiding thing was finished Hallelujah but brother after that when Peter got the Holy Ghost there was no more hiding Peter stood on the day of Pentecost said this is that that the prophet spoke of this is that hallelujah amen amen praise the Lord The Hiding Place talking of that beeded when I preached this to my church about a month ago I said I could see the funny side of this do you know what they were doing in the upper room they were hiding correct I'll read the quote to you the quot Adam led by the spirit they were in an upper room to hide from the Jews I think the Bible says for fear of the Jews isn't that something that's what the upper room was for amen the prophet said Peter would open the door make sure nobody was there go out here it was a hiding place yes Hallelujah to me this is wonderful amen amen that hiding place was where God chose to come down Hallelujah Hallelujah by the time the holy ghost comes no more hiding they broke out of there Hallelujah they broke out of there oh like drunk man praising God lifting up his name Hallelujah glory to his wonderful name my they they they climbed up here's the quote for you they climbed up in the upper room they stayed there cowardly the door was locked that's right have you locked the door that's right and locked the windows and they praying low to themselves and hiding from the Jews until the Holy Ghost fell Hallelujah where are you Hallelujah where are you amen he came down to call them to fill them to give them power amen amen to come down with tongues of fire we can never get rid of this God has got a great plan for us hallelujah you are going to be the manifested sons of God standing on the earth praise the Lord amen oh God is going to say this is my beloved people in whom I'm well pleased amen you can't be seated my mind goes to another biblical example and that is this great person called Jonah he actually hid he ran from the presence of the Lord similar to Adam cuz Adam was getting out of the he thought but the presence of God found him amen amen amen and the Messiah gift will always find you amen hallelujah what happened Jonah Rose in verse uh three of chapter 1 to flee to tashes from the presence of the Lord so Jonah was in fact running from the presence of the Lord amen he was hiding in the ship he was fast asleep till somebody came down and said hey sleeper what are you doing down here where are you from where's your passport what's going on here amen then Jonah had to come and admit he was hiding and they had to throw him out God was saying Jonah Jonah where are you where are you Jonah he was hiding but the time came to take his position time came to to get back to where he was running from and to never mind his Comforts and his his umbrella you know but to do the work of the Lord amen that was the important thingu and he went from tashes from the presence of the Lord he went down to jopa and he found a ship going to tares and he paid the fair and he says uh he went from the presence of the Lord amen he was running from the presence of the Lord but God came down said Jonah Jonah where you're going I've got a job for you and there's nobody can do it but you I've got I've got no Reserve team amen no plan B amen you are the one that's going to do this job amen hallelujah and the same applies to you as well praise be to God church right through the Bible we find these people Moses is another good example Moses had to hide he was a fugitive because in Anger he had killed two Egyptians but Moses ran out of Egypt and the prophet said he says can you imagine God appeared to Moses he was saying Moses Moses where are you come out Moses I've got a plan for your life you can't just sit like that come out of your hiding place it's time for you to go back to Egypt me go to Egypt look I'm in trouble there but something happened to Moses the same pillow fire that came in the upper room Hallelujah came in the burning bush Hallelujah the same fire and by the time it was finished Moses was a Onan Army Hallelujah the power he had was more than anybody amen he went back and said let my people go can you imagine God quote out of a mical Divine love he says God had appeared to Moses who was hiding from the Egyptians that's right right Moses where are you going where are you Moses I'm bringing these examples because we are next we are next we are coming Center Stage God has got a plan for us more than we can ask or even think Hallelujah may this message strengthen us for that day amen said Moses where are you going he said I'm I'm going down to Egypt to take over he says that will be a one man in Invasion and he did it praise be to God hallelujah thank you Jesus Hallelujah I thank God the nature we are preaching about is not a hiding nature that it is a nature of display hallelujah praise be to God he said brother bam speaking in the token message you cannot be a secret boy no sir you've got to have it amen you've got to have it on display amen that was the purpose of putting it on the door praise be to God so that he could see on the lint and doorpost it's something that you're not ashamed of you want the whole world to know that you are dead and your life is hid in Christ that's the power your life is hid in Christ praise be to God church that's what we're speaking about amen this nature that is in us already somebody might might say well I don't see it yet but it's coming it is in embryonic form but everything that you need is in that embryo all the value you need is sitting there yes I say again be careful Satan this is the secret the word is in the bride praise be to God Amen you've got to have it on display see that is the purpose of putting it on the doors and he could see on the lentil to know you're dead your your life is hid in Christ praise be to God like Daniel he wasn't interested in secret prayer Daniel had something in him when he prayed brother he said open those windows open those windows somebody could say Daniel are you crazy man you know you are finished now Daniel said well if I'm finished then I'm finished but the same God that was with Daniel went with him to the Lion's Den amen and Daniel went down to that Lion's with power amen and those Lon mouths were shut amen praise be to God Church bride brothers sisters that's where we're at today it's not a hiding thing no this this message that we have in our hearts is a message of display we are proud of the lord

the in in the bush that had plenty of reason to hide and that was the mother deer and when that Hunter what was his name Bert I think something he was a cruel hearted man and he blew a whistle yes that mother dear had lots of reason to hide and they were good at hiding but that mother dear said no she came out in the open that's right amen what happened her love for her baby took over the prophet said when love projects Grace takes over amen hallelujah brother Brandon was speaking to bir he said you you wouldn't do that would you he said you chicken-hearted preachers watch me but when you project not hide but when love projects brother something takes over amen it's called Grace it takes the place Hallelujah it took the place and Bert is there with his big Magnum ready to pull the trigger but some Grace took over amen that beautiful mother deer came out of hiding praise be to God and B Bert was just doing this he couldn't even hold the gun amen said Billy lead me to that Jesus

back in his life again and he killed more Philistines with his death than with his life praise be to God the prop goes on to say I wonder if the church is ready Amen to to pay the price and put away popularity and all these things praise be to God amen you see where I'm going today amen we are surrounded by Witnesses God is going to come down fundamental Foundation he said everything obeyed Adam everything obeyed Adam until that went wrong and that title deed was taken away then he says then the hiding business started he says now that's the beginning of man what God did he says through through that fall Adam lost power fundamental Foundation of Faith you know the message amen he said uh then then he became unconscious of the fact that he was losing his relationship and his friendship fellowship with the father then he lost that see and all of his great channels became clogged up now and he couldn't get through he couldn't get through what Adam was in God Christ redeemed us back and now is to bring it back to its origin again brother we're going to fight a battle brother we're going to fight a big big battle amen nothing's going to stop us though because this cannot fail something in you cannot fail right now praise be to God Amen what the Holy Ghost was given for he said God is coming back Amen to live in and dwell with and commune to his people as he did at the beginning he's coming back all that was in God he poured into Christ all that was in Christ he poured into the right amen and Back to Eden as hard as we can go so we're going back to no hiding but fellowship with the Lord hallelujah amen amen amen now as soon as he gets this is what the Holy Ghost was given for continued as soon as he gets his church in speaking conditions he gets his church to a place he can flow himself through and love and persuade and fellowship ship there will come an Eden he'll take his church back to where it left him back to an Eden again where it fell that's where it made its first fall Say it'll be taken right back again praise be to God friends that's what's going on now you know the greatest battle is Raging the devil is nervous because he knows and he's bringing out the Bazooka and the the the the the the AK-47 and the weapons to scare you but the greatest weapon we have amen the greatest weapon is prayer amen the greatest weapon is love the greatest weapon is the word of God hallelujah amen amen say in a message called way to have Fellowship I won't keep you along believe me amen Chicago he said that's where it's at tonight God has to give it am just come to him say Lord put those skins on me because he doesn't change his way what he did for Adam and Eve he'll do for you the same leop doesn't change his spots God doesn't change at all love produces that Fellowship am that's why love is what we preach love is the end of our conversation say when God when the day that sin separated that Divine love amen that's what happened in Eden amen Adam was separated from love but I'm so glad love is coming back hallelujah it's coming back on you it's coming back on me it's coming down down down hallelujah amen he says God said they separated from love God told Adam don't eat these fruits and their sin brought separation and sin by separation brought hatred malice Strife envy and is that right what happened they separated from Divine love they separated from Divine love hallelujah oh praise God we're on the traveling on the right Road praise be to God hallelujah When Love projects Grace is going to take over again amen Amen in another couple more quotes amen he says God he says who is God he says we in Fellowship we we we in Fellowship what Adam lost in the fall Christ restored amen do you believe that he says now the church has move has moved up into that fellowship with God communion like Adam had in the beginning In the Garden of Eden the church has moved up not will moves up but has moved up praise be to God free from condemnation the Holy Spirit cleansing us from all sin now you're free to exercise the next step of God praise be to God church when I preached this to my church back home they said my we see it now amen they saw it amen fourth seal wait to those seven Thunders out their voices to that group who can really take the word of God and hand it there it will cut it will slice they can close the heavens

what just overcome by love just overcome by love praise be to God it's a great great great weapon Here Comes Malachi for God's Prophet amen you couldn't hide your life now because it was the Messiah gift amen amen and he said wherever the presence of Christ is that gift Works yes it could be in Genesis 18 it could be in Malachi 4 it was the same gift it's the Messiah gift and he said you couldn't
