[42:22] [Applause]
[42:27] um
[42:29] you know there's Division and the labor
[42:31] to put the convention together
[42:33] um just really really
[42:36] um Priceless I think you know you could
[42:38] put a price on this and price on that
[42:40] and what this costs and whatever
[42:42] but uh the real gift that he yielded I
[42:45] think uh God gave the increase amen so
[42:49] um
[42:50] so that's really tremendous for me just
[42:52] thank God for God's leadership
[42:55] well praise the lord we have a mass hour
[42:58] message upon my heart to bring to the
[43:00] church this morning amen you know their
[43:02] Pastor asked me to take the service this
[43:04] morning so
[43:06] God Richie bless you thank you so much
[43:07] so much musicians amen
[43:11] praise God
[43:12] basically want to total for now to the
[43:14] scriptures
[43:16] um
[43:17] and I have two scriptures we'd like to
[43:19] read from here that's Ezekiel 34.
[43:23] and we want to read from Saint John
[43:25] chapter 10.
[43:27] amen
[43:29] and um
[43:30] preschool
[43:33] Ezekiel 34
[43:36] Saint John
[43:37] chapter 10.
[43:40] Ezekiel 34 says oh sorry from verse one
[43:45] if you have it say man
[43:47] okay good nice
[43:49] so Ezekiel 34 and verse 1 says and the
[43:52] word of the Lord came unto me saying
[43:55] son of man
[43:56] prophesy
[43:58] against the Shepherds of Israel
[44:01] prophesy and say unto them thus saith
[44:05] the Lord God unto the Shepherds
[44:08] will be to the Shepherds of Israel that
[44:12] do feed themselves
[44:14] should not the Shepherds feed the flocks
[44:17] so it seems in this scripture that God
[44:20] the Father
[44:22] got a report
[44:24] about the Shepherds in Israel
[44:27] that Disturbed him very much
[44:30] so he touches
[44:31] his anointed Ezekiel
[44:34] and he speaks the following
[44:36] he says he eat the fat
[44:38] and he clothed with you the world
[44:41] ye kill them that are fed
[44:44] but you feed not the flock
[44:47] the disease they have not strengthened
[44:49] neither have ye healed the uh that which
[44:53] was sick
[44:55] neither have he bound up that which was
[44:58] broken
[44:59] neither have he brought again that which
[45:02] was driven away neither have he sought
[45:05] that which was lost
[45:07] but with force and with cruelty have you
[45:11] ruled them
[45:13] 11.
[45:14] and there's a lot in there but we just
[45:16] want to get the context this morning
[45:18] so from verse 11
[45:20] says but for thus saith the Lord God
[45:23] behold I
[45:25] even I will both search my sheep
[45:28] and seek them out
[45:31] as a Shepherd she get out of his flock
[45:33] in the day that he is among his sheep
[45:36] that are scattered so will I seek out my
[45:39] sheep
[45:40] and we deliver them out of all the
[45:43] places where they have been scattered in
[45:46] the Cloudy and dark day I will bring
[45:49] them out from the people and gather them
[45:52] from the countries
[45:54] and will bring them into their own land
[45:57] and feed them upon the mountains of
[46:00] Israel by the rivers and in all the
[46:03] inhabited places of the country
[46:05] I will feed them it could posture and
[46:10] upon the high mountains of Israel shall
[46:12] they be their fold be
[46:14] bear shall they lie in a good food
[46:17] and in a fat pasture shall we feed upon
[46:21] the mountains of Israel
[46:23] I will feed my flock and I will cause
[46:27] them to lie down save the Lord amen
[46:31] is going to give you rest amen do you
[46:34] believe in
[46:35] Saint John 10 you know I want to read
[46:37] from verse 11 in there
[46:41] and this is Jesus
[46:43] in the New Testament
[46:45] amen let's look at the reflection here
[46:47] now
[46:49] Saint John 10 and chapter chapter 10 and
[46:51] verse 11.
[46:53] says for thus said the Lord God behold
[46:57] oh no sorry
[46:59] um
[47:01] I'm the Good Shepherd oh sorry let me
[47:03] just get that quick
[47:05] made a mistake here
[47:07] praise God
[47:09] the scripture repeated amen
[47:12] amen so let's just get it Saint John
[47:14] chapter 10.
[47:15] and verse 11 right he said for I am the
[47:19] Good Shepherd
[47:21] the Good Shepherd giveth his life for
[47:24] the Sheep
[47:25] he that is unhealing
[47:28] and not the shepherd
[47:31] whose own sheep are not see it the wolf
[47:34] coming
[47:35] and leave at the Sheep
[47:37] and flee it and Runway and the Wolf
[47:41] catches them and Scattered the Sheep so
[47:43] you see we're seeing the the the the the
[47:46] the the comparison in here between
[47:48] Ezekiel and what we just read right the
[47:50] heiling flee it because he is unhired
[47:54] and careth not for the Sheep
[47:57] I am the Good Shepherd I know my sheep
[48:02] and I'm known of mine
[48:05] as the father knoweth me even so no I
[48:08] the father and I lay down my life
[48:12] for the Sheep another sheep I have which
[48:15] are not of this fool them also I must
[48:18] bring
[48:19] and they shall hear my voice
[48:21] there shall be one fold and one Shepherd
[48:25] amen is not any man one Lord one feet
[48:29] one baptism amen where does my father
[48:33] therefore does my father love me because
[48:36] I lay down my life
[48:37] that I might take it again amen and God
[48:40] had a blessing to ring of his word let's
[48:42] just pray one more time Heavenly Father
[48:44] Lord we thank you Lord to be in your
[48:46] presence this morning in your presence

[48:56] your spirit teaching us and showing us
[49:00] the way father
[49:01] may you show us the way this morning but
[49:03] we don't know him and we acknowledge our
[49:05] own insufficiencies Lord father we look
[49:08] to you now Lord our eyes upon you father
[49:11] my eyes are upon you Lord
[49:12] May anointing come may your presence
[49:15] come and help us this morning as we look
[49:18] to your word father for guidance and for
[49:21] leadership Lord we thank you Lord that
[49:25] you are the Good Shepherd this morning
[49:26] and Lord we just pray that your spirit
[49:28] will come down into these scriptures and
[49:30] help bring it to life in in a way that
[49:32] would that would help us give us
[49:35] strength for the journey Lord and
[49:36] encourage our hearts Lord father
[49:39] raise up the downtrodden Lord father
[49:41] bring the needy up out of the downhill o

[49:54] time of the word and sharing Lord father
[49:57] into your hands Lord and we pray that
[50:00] you take control of the preacher now
[50:01] have your own way fathers we hide
[50:03] ourselves behind your cross Lord in
[50:06] Jesus name amen and amen you may be
[50:10] seated now praise God God rich and bless
[50:24] amen so do you love him this morning
[50:27] amen are you happy to be in his presence
[50:31] amen
[50:33] well I have a title this morning
[50:36] title of my message is true Shepherds
[50:42] true Shepherds that's the title I have
[50:46] this morning
[50:48] and through the unfolding of the lives
[50:50] of
[50:51] God's people in Scripture
[50:54] we could see the purpose of God
[50:57] coming more plainly and more plainly
[50:59] interviewed
[51:01] it's not right
[51:02] God uses the lives of his people
[51:06] his believing children
[51:08] His prophets
[51:10] his servants he uses their lives
[51:13] to tell a story
[51:15] to tell a story of his goodness
[51:19] to tell a story of his love
[51:22] to tell a story of his of his provisions
[51:26] to tell a story of his grace towards us
[51:29] that's why we ought to live every day
[51:32] in the thankfulness of God
[51:34] because through sunshine and through
[51:37] shadow
[51:38] he cares for us
[51:41] and we get to see that every single day
[51:44] what a privilege it is
[51:46] to be called the sons of God
[51:49] just for that alone we ought to be able
[51:51] to give God a shout of praise
[51:54] because there's not a day in my life
[51:56] that I have not seen
[51:57] the hand of God
[51:59] in every situation
[52:02] doesn't matter if you can't see him or
[52:04] not just know this morning that he is on
[52:07] your on the throne
[52:09] he is on the throne this morning and he
[52:11] is very much in control of the situation
[52:15] even though you can't see your foot or
[52:18] where to put your foot in front of you
[52:19] just know that God knows everything
[52:22] about you this morning and he's here to
[52:25] take you by the hand and lead you to his
[52:29] Promised Land pray and make you a
[52:31] witness of his presence and a testimony
[52:34] that God is good that his Mercy is
[52:38] Everlasting and that his truth endureth
[52:42] forever
[52:43] the devil didn't win the battle but
[52:46] Jesus got the victory oh he didn't let
[52:50] the devil win this morning oh he won't
[52:53] let the devil win this morning oh honey
[52:55] he's going to give you the victory
[52:57] because he loved you and because he
[53:00] called you from the beginning
[53:06] we are his people and we are a sheep of
[53:09] his pasture and we are here to give him
[53:12] all the praise give him all the honor
[53:14] and give him all the glory this morning
[53:17] oh can somebody help me Praise Him
[53:20] I don't know about you and I come to
[53:23] praise my God this morning because he
[53:25] woke me up this morning he he put life
[53:28] in my body he put breath in my lungs he
[53:31] provided for me when I couldn't find a
[53:34] way out he made a way for me oh how he
[53:37] opened doors from me he shut doors for
[53:40] me because it wasn't good for me he was
[53:43] looking out for my good he was looking
[53:46] out for my betterment and he shut doors
[53:49] he closed things away he opened all the
[53:52] doors because he knew what was best for
[53:55] me I'm just a sheep in his pasture but
[53:59] he is the Good Shepherd this morning and
[54:03] he is here to meet your need he is here
[54:07] to set you free he's here to fill you
[54:10] with the Holy Ghost and Fire he's here
[54:13] to give you strength if you need
[54:15] strength this morning lift up your hands
[54:18] and begin to ask God for strength if you
[54:21] need presents lift up your hands and ask
[54:24] God for his presence this morning if you
[54:27] need Grace if you need favor if you need
[54:30] something from the Lord he
[54:32] had this morning to meet your need to
[54:35] set the captain Freer or he loves to
[54:39] shed the captain Freer he proves himself
[54:42] to be the Mighty God when he sets his
[54:45] people free
[54:47] oh can somebody
[54:50] give my God some praise this morning is
[54:53] he your God this morning oh I was he
[54:57] good to you this morning
[55:00] my eyes have seen the glory of the Lord
[55:04] how can we help but speak of the things
[55:08] that we have seen and of the things that
[55:11] we have heard oh Hallelujah fool to say
[55:15] that there is no God no no no when I
[55:18] step out my door on a morning with the
[55:21] prayer of the morning the Holy Spirit is
[55:25] going with me to make sure that the
[55:28] enemy doesn't entrap me doesn't enslare
[55:32] me my strength is not in Princess it's
[55:36] not a horse man but my strength my hope
[55:39] is in the Lord in his word I am hoping
[55:43] this morning I am reaching into his work
[55:47] this morning to find strength for
[55:50] tomorrow Monday morning is coming but
[55:53] God is already here he promised a whole
[55:56] my hand and take me here no Hallelujah
[56:01] all the way
[56:03] oh can somebody say man can somebody
[56:06] give him praise lift up your hand right
[56:09] now and just Praise Him and thank him oh
[56:12] Hallelujah
[56:14] Hallelujah
[56:17] oh glory
[56:19] amen just a little praise offering right
[56:22] okay so let's get into it so God calls
[56:25] us
[56:26] amen we see the purpose of God
[56:29] in our lives God calls us
[56:32] then we when we respond to the call of
[56:34] God in our lives
[56:36] God Saves us
[56:38] and he cleans us up
[56:41] he changes us
[56:43] trains us
[56:44] and then sets us out
[56:47] to go and do
[56:49] his work
[56:50] to go and fulfill his purpose
[56:53] so this morning it's kind of like a
[56:54] journey because
[56:57] you know we we we talk about
[57:00] coming to the Lord and coming into
[57:02] Christianity
[57:04] but what is adoption
[57:07] uh age is about
[57:09] really it's about God empowering his
[57:13] people
[57:15] so
[57:17] sooner or later you're gonna move from
[57:20] one level
[57:22] to another
[57:23] can we say Amen
[57:25] that's what it's about
[57:28] and that's what I think brother Branham
[57:30] always lamented
[57:32] at the Pentecostals didn't do
[57:35] they didn't come into their place
[57:38] see they had the gifts and they had the
[57:41] anointings and the presence and the
[57:43] singing and the atmosphere and so on but
[57:46] they never got into that place in Christ
[57:49] adoption
[57:51] coming into the word for their season
[57:54] and time
[57:55] so that it could fulfill their Duty
[57:58] or so that they can fulfill God's
[58:00] purpose or continue his work on the
[58:02] Earth
[58:03] because when God made man in the
[58:05] beginning
[58:06] he gave that man Dominion
[58:08] over the fowl of the air and over the
[58:11] fish of the sea and over every creeping
[58:14] thing that creeped upon the Earth
[58:17] that man was given dominion over that
[58:19] but that man fell from that state
[58:23] so God has always been longing and we
[58:26] say it but I hope it falls fresh upon
[58:29] you this morning that God has always
[58:31] been longing to get a people that will
[58:35] come back to that kind of a condition
[58:38] where they have dominion
[58:40] where they have authority where they can
[58:43] do as the father does
[58:45] when God placed that man in the garden
[58:48] in the beginning he turned his back
[58:51] he turned his back because it showed a
[58:54] confidence that God had in what he had
[58:57] created that man for that man knew who
[59:01] he was and that man knew who God was
[59:05] he was in Authority but he was also
[59:08] under Authority oh Hallelujah and he was
[59:11] aware of it and he was conscious of it
[59:14] and not only that he had the spirit and
[59:16] the likeness of God
[59:18] isn't that right because God said let us
[59:21] make man in our image and after our
[59:24] likeness and let that man have dominion
[59:27] so that man was in God's spirit and in
[59:30] God's likeness therefore God could have
[59:32] confidence in that man's ability to rule
[59:36] in that man's ability to lead in that
[59:39] man's ability to speak he had confidence
[59:42] in that man's work because of the work
[59:45] of the Craftsman is always a reflection
[59:48] of the Craftsman himself oh hallelujah
[59:51] hallelujah isn't that right oh the sea
[59:54] that is Reap is a reflection under seed
[59:56] that was planted in the beginning
[59:59] so God had to have the right man on the
[1:00:02] earth in order for things to work right
[1:00:05] and you have to be right in order for
[1:00:09] things to work right God wants to fix
[1:00:12] you
[1:00:13] from what you was to what he wants you
[1:00:16] to be so that you could come out right
[1:00:19] can somebody say Amen because if you're
[1:00:22] not right are you gonna help others to
[1:00:24] be right if you are misaligned are you
[1:00:28] gonna help align others if you are
[1:00:31] misconstrued how are you gonna help pull
[1:00:33] others up if you are torn up and messed
[1:00:36] up are you gonna help other people who
[1:00:39] are torn and messed up you gotta be
[1:00:41] fixed first God Gotta Straighten you out
[1:00:44] first God's Gonna fix your life first
[1:00:47] then you can be a positive influence to
[1:00:51] other people and other things because
[1:00:54] that's what the adoption is all about
[1:00:56] it's about growing you up
[1:01:00] from a babe in Christ
[1:01:04] into an adult in Christ
[1:01:06] can we say Amen
[1:01:09] oh Hallelujah
[1:01:12] so we have to make this transition
[1:01:16] transition we have to make it's a
[1:01:18] journey we have to be
[1:01:19] it's not an overnight transition
[1:01:22] process
[1:01:24] it takes time
[1:01:27] one thing I learned is that
[1:01:28] perfection
[1:01:30] takes time
[1:01:32] if you're aiming for perfection
[1:01:36] takes time you gotta blend it I love
[1:01:38] that
[1:01:39] blending tixture
[1:01:41] isn't that right
[1:01:42] I was talking to her just up your alley
[1:01:45] by the punch our Auto Body Works again
[1:01:48] you know he's talking about how you know
[1:01:50] if you have to paint something
[1:01:52] sometimes you have to blend in the paint
[1:01:54] make it work
[1:01:56] but that takes time
[1:01:57] you can't sit and wait for it gotta
[1:02:00] leave the car
[1:02:01] and then work on it then when you come
[1:02:04] back
[1:02:04] you see the work is done
[1:02:06] and you say wow that's amazing it looks
[1:02:09] good
[1:02:10] I mean you don't know it
[1:02:12] stress
[1:02:13] and the effort that took
[1:02:16] and the process that that took you
[1:02:18] weren't pretty to all of that
[1:02:19] but you see the result in the end
[1:02:22] and you thank God for it
[1:02:24] and you're willing to even pay for it
[1:02:26] because it's something of value
[1:02:29] somebody gave their time
[1:02:31] their effort their sacrifice and there's
[1:02:35] a value for that Exchange
[1:02:38] of effort
[1:02:39] and labor and sacrifice some people
[1:02:42] don't like to value those things
[1:02:44] sometimes experience is a value
[1:02:48] isn't that
[1:02:49] I think there was a story one time but a
[1:02:51] guy was building a ship oh sorry the
[1:02:53] ship had broken down I think my eyes
[1:02:54] like my knew this story
[1:02:56] and uh the ship had broken down and
[1:02:58] they didn't know how to fix the ship
[1:03:01] so they asked the best people and so on
[1:03:03] and they couldn't find anybody to fix a
[1:03:04] ship so there was somebody just on the
[1:03:06] shore somewhere that they knew was a
[1:03:08] specialist or something in this ship
[1:03:09] thing so they called him in
[1:03:11] something wrong with the ship we don't
[1:03:13] know how to fix it he called me look
[1:03:15] around the ship you walk around walk
[1:03:17] around so what the problem was
[1:03:20] took a little hammer or something
[1:03:22] hit it pow pow
[1:03:24] [Music]
[1:03:26] ship stop
[1:03:29] you know and uh they asked him wow
[1:03:31] that's that's brilliant thanks so much
[1:03:33] you know you saved us so much time as
[1:03:34] well
[1:03:35] how much is that gonna cost
[1:03:38] really charge them a pretty loud sum of
[1:03:40] money
[1:03:42] and I think the story goes to the point
[1:03:44] that
[1:03:45] what they were paying for wasn't for the
[1:03:47] hammer
[1:03:48] they were not pay in for the fact that
[1:03:50] he hit uh something with the hammer but
[1:03:53] they were paying for the fact that he
[1:03:55] hit the right spot
[1:03:56] they were paying for the fact that he
[1:03:58] knew where to hit
[1:04:00] to get it to work
[1:04:02] and knowing where to hit
[1:04:04] took years of experience
[1:04:07] that they were not privy to
[1:04:09] when he was down in the trenches getting
[1:04:11] dirty like a grease monkey dung in there
[1:04:14] with his overalls learning the ship they
[1:04:17] weren't around for that
[1:04:19] they weren't around for when he was
[1:04:20] sacrificed and spent the hours trying to
[1:04:23] fix things and learning water wrenches
[1:04:25] and learning where the oil was and
[1:04:27] learning how the things work they went
[1:04:29] around for all of that and there's a
[1:04:31] value that comes with that oh Hallelujah
[1:04:33] there's a value that comes with
[1:04:35] experiences and God wants to take you
[1:04:38] through experiences in your Christian
[1:04:41] Journey because there is a value to that
[1:04:44] there's a value in your everyday up one
[1:04:48] day town the next sometimes you don't
[1:04:50] know what's going on sometimes you feel
[1:04:53] like your prayers not been answered
[1:04:55] sometimes you feel like your prayer just
[1:04:57] hit in a wall and the Accord watching
[1:04:59] you just in your faith testing your
[1:05:02] faith see if you really want to be a
[1:05:05] Christian you really want to be a
[1:05:07] Christian leave you in a better sickness
[1:05:09] lose your job lose your house lose your
[1:05:13] car do you still want to be a Christian
[1:05:15] or Hallelujah better sickness took this
[1:05:19] from you took that from you oh Hollow
[1:05:22] that's not right do you still want to be
[1:05:25] a Christian
[1:05:26] you gotta answer it from your heart you
[1:05:29] can't answer that from your wallet you
[1:05:31] can't answer that from your material
[1:05:32] possessions you gotta answer you're
[1:05:35] gonna keep God an answer cut up your
[1:05:38] lines and answer me like a man where was
[1:05:43] thou when I lay the foundations of the
[1:05:46] Earth when the morning star sign
[1:05:48] together and when the sons of God
[1:05:50] shouted for Joy do you know who you are
[1:05:54] this morning
[1:05:56] oh your name is in the Lamb's Book of
[1:05:59] Life it cannot be raised God took his
[1:06:03] own blood and wrote your name in it and
[1:06:06] no devil could take it up this morning I
[1:06:09] don't care how many demon powers 200
[1:06:11] million demons cannot stop you this
[1:06:14] morning from being delivered from being
[1:06:17] filled with the holy ghost from being
[1:06:20] set free the Good Shepherd is here this
[1:06:23] morning

[1:06:37] oh Hallelujah
[1:06:40] Hallelujah
[1:06:42] so we make a transition
[1:06:43] [Applause]
[1:06:45] move from being saved
[1:06:48] thank the Lord I'm saved his grace Jacob
[1:06:50] Grace
[1:06:51] move into Joseph perfection
[1:06:53] cap store
[1:06:55] the fault line
[1:06:57] we come into that
[1:06:58] that kind of elevation
[1:07:02] it takes God to do that
[1:07:05] promotion doesn't come from the East
[1:07:08] promotion doesn't come from the West
[1:07:11] comes from above
[1:07:13] comes from God
[1:07:15] will raise you
[1:07:18] doesn't matter what man sees
[1:07:20] men are imperfect
[1:07:22] they miss a lot of things
[1:07:25] you know and God help us
[1:07:28] you know we're not good
[1:07:29] we need God as much as the next guy
[1:07:33] but God
[1:07:34] doesn't miss a Beat
[1:07:37] foreign
[1:07:38] he knows every tear that came out your
[1:07:40] eye
[1:07:42] knows every pain that you went through
[1:07:45] knows the time when you was alone
[1:07:49] he knows when people forgot about you he
[1:07:52] knows about all of it this morning
[1:08:00] knows about the pain of your existence
[1:08:03] [Applause]
[1:08:05] he knows about how lonely you feel
[1:08:07] sometimes
[1:08:10] I've forgotten you feel sometimes
[1:08:13] he's behind all of that
[1:08:16] because he wants to bring something out
[1:08:17] of you
[1:08:19] he wants you to learn how to trust him
[1:08:23] and in order to trust him
[1:08:26] a lot of the things that you call
[1:08:28] valuable
[1:08:30] he has to take it away from you
[1:08:33] a lot of the things you build your
[1:08:35] kingdom upon
[1:08:37] he has to crack it up
[1:08:39] break it up
[1:08:40] Bust It Up remove it
[1:08:44] sometimes it's forceful
[1:08:46] but it's necessary for growth
[1:08:48] [Applause]
[1:08:49] if you have no more props holding you up
[1:08:53] it's necessary for growth
[1:08:55] God removes it hindrances in your life
[1:09:00] they're nice things they might be good
[1:09:01] things you know legitimate things
[1:09:05] but God is seeing a bigger picture
[1:09:08] place he wants you to be at
[1:09:10] sometimes those things
[1:09:13] will hold you back
[1:09:15] because where your heart is
[1:09:17] that's where your treasure will be
[1:09:21] I'm smiling because the word is just
[1:09:23] unfoldings when I have nothing that's
[1:09:24] written
[1:09:26] foreign
[1:09:29] there was a story I think a preacher
[1:09:30] gave one time I think I told the
[1:09:32] dinosaur
[1:09:32] but you get one time that he had a tree
[1:09:35] on the front yard a nice little young
[1:09:36] tree was coming up nicely but it come to
[1:09:39] a point where the tree was just kind of
[1:09:40] weak and
[1:09:42] no no not performing us
[1:09:44] he would have hoped
[1:09:45] not a strong and see what I've hoped
[1:09:48] so he called a landscaper guy I guess
[1:09:50] you know some one of those
[1:09:51] uh people who are really good in
[1:09:54] horticulture
[1:09:55] and he said come on take a look at my
[1:09:56] tree because
[1:09:58] it's not you know it doesn't look like
[1:10:00] how it looked in the picture
[1:10:02] how it's supposed to look
[1:10:04] and as soon as the horticulturist took
[1:10:06] one look at it he said
[1:10:09] you got too many props on this tree man
[1:10:12] you got stuff wire you know like
[1:10:14] sometimes they put four Stokes and then
[1:10:16] they tie a string on it and they hold
[1:10:17] another
[1:10:19] bark of it they did this the stem of it
[1:10:21] so this tree has too much supports
[1:10:24] he said you have you have to remove it
[1:10:26] he said right now you baby anything man
[1:10:29] the thing is got potential what's your
[1:10:31] baby anything
[1:10:32] remove the supports he said let the wind
[1:10:35] blow on it a little bit let's let rain
[1:10:38] fall a little bit let it get some hot
[1:10:40] sun a little bit oh Hallelujah little
[1:10:43] bugs come and take some leaves that's
[1:10:44] all right all that's good for the tree
[1:10:47] because he learned how to grow the
[1:10:49] leaves back again he'll learn how to
[1:10:51] push his roots out more again because if
[1:10:53] he's gonna get higher then he's got to
[1:10:55] get deeper first if he's gonna get
[1:10:58] higher then he's got to get deeper
[1:11:01] deeper in the love of Jesus Oh
[1:11:05] Hallelujah Paul said I would at you be
[1:11:08] deeply rooted and grounded in the love
[1:11:11] of Jesus Christ because if you know that
[1:11:14] he loves you then you can come up a
[1:11:16] little bit and though the winds block
[1:11:18] contrary you're anchored in the love of
[1:11:20] God though things blow this way and that
[1:11:23] way you're anchored in the love of God
[1:11:25] though the Trials come though the storms
[1:11:28] come lord the devil may come and give
[1:11:31] you three wild attacks velocity eyes
[1:11:33] lust of the flesh pride of life though
[1:11:37] these things may happen look up for your
[1:11:40] Redemption joy and now you know upon
[1:11:43] which Foundation you are standing on you
[1:11:47] are standing on the love of God oh
[1:11:50] Hallelujah Paul said what can separate
[1:11:53] us from the love of God that is in
[1:11:56] Christ Jesus no Heights come on now no
[1:11:59] depth oh Hallelujah no tire no Peril no
[1:12:04] persecution oh I need somebody to help
[1:12:06] me this morning
[1:12:10] oh Hallelujah
[1:12:18] wow
[1:12:21] so it's a journey
[1:12:25] it's mountains
[1:12:26] and there's valleys
[1:12:29] no we need the valleys
[1:12:31] just as much as we need
[1:12:34] the mountains
[1:12:35] and God likes to give us mountains
[1:12:38] because that's good
[1:12:39] you know you need a you need us you need
[1:12:41] you need victory in your life
[1:12:44] it helps boost morale you know it helps
[1:12:48] boost your confidence
[1:12:49] you know you have a testimony that you
[1:12:51] can stand on
[1:12:53] it becomes an anchor point for you
[1:12:55] you know that God can you can rest on
[1:12:58] and say I was on the mountain once
[1:13:00] and even though I'm in the Valley now
[1:13:02] there's another mountain to climb
[1:13:05] and I can't wait to get on the top of
[1:13:07] that mountain because that mountain was
[1:13:10] even taller than the last oh and but
[1:13:12] nothing good comes without a fight oh so
[1:13:15] I'm willing to fight because I've tasted
[1:13:17] victory once and I know that a God that
[1:13:20] was with me then is a god that is with
[1:13:22] me now the mountains help prove the
[1:13:26] testimony of God in our lives that he is
[1:13:28] faithful to perform his promises and if
[1:13:32] he was faithful to put food on your
[1:13:34] table if he was faithful to give you a
[1:13:36] home or to take care of your children if
[1:13:39] he was faithful to come through for you
[1:13:41] before I know he can do it again because
[1:13:45] he is a god that is faithful to his
[1:13:49] promise faithful to his word he loves
[1:13:52] you this morning oh whatever you have
[1:13:55] prayed for keep on praying God will
[1:13:58] answer don't you worry he knows your
[1:14:02] every need he knows what you have need
[1:14:04] of and he is here this morning to
[1:14:07] provide for your every need according
[1:14:12] to his riches and Glory oh hallelujah
[1:14:16] hallelujah
[1:14:19] Oh Glory to God
[1:14:22] amen
[1:14:25] do you love the Lord this morning amen
[1:14:27] that's taking my time now just uh
[1:14:31] trying to get this word over to you man
[1:14:34] I have wow
[1:14:36] had I had 19 Pages this morning
[1:14:40] but you know
[1:14:47] we just healed a lot to do here man
[1:14:51] all right
[1:14:52] so we have to move from
[1:14:55] from being saved to doing God's work we
[1:14:56] have to move from being followers of
[1:14:58] Christ
[1:14:59] to Leading the People to Christ
[1:15:02] Jesus met Peter and them and so on he
[1:15:04] said from follow me
[1:15:06] I'll make you Fishers of me
[1:15:09] that's a little different from being a
[1:15:11] follower
[1:15:13] it's different from beautiful he asked
[1:15:14] him to follow him first
[1:15:16] no one can lead unless they're first
[1:15:18] willing to follow
[1:15:20] can't lead until your first
[1:15:23] go through the
[1:15:24] rough times
[1:15:27] that's why you gotta hang around people
[1:15:29] who've been through
[1:15:30] the rough times
[1:15:32] gotta hang a wrong folk who know how to
[1:15:34] change their spare tire
[1:15:38] it's one thing to read it in a book
[1:15:40] it's another thing to be on the highway
[1:15:42] in the night
[1:15:44] changing the tire that's different
[1:15:47] from being you know
[1:15:49] uh comfortable at home with a book
[1:15:52] on changing spare tires it's much
[1:15:54] different
[1:15:55] you can take control of your atmosphere
[1:15:57] internet reading lamp on and your
[1:15:59] glasses how to change your time
[1:16:03] but when you're on the road
[1:16:05] and it starts to rain
[1:16:07] and the cars are whizzing by
[1:16:10] and it's getting a little dark
[1:16:12] you need to know where Espana is you
[1:16:13] need to know where where the tire is you
[1:16:16] need to know how to get access to that
[1:16:17] you need to know
[1:16:19] to undo the nuts first before you raise
[1:16:22] it the car up because if you raise the
[1:16:24] car up on you undo the nuts
[1:16:27] the title spin
[1:16:29] because there's no weight the whole
[1:16:30] entire
[1:16:37] I saw an experience right
[1:16:40] everybody had to learn everybody started
[1:16:43] somewhere I'm not ashamed to admit I was
[1:16:45] kind of a dance excuse the expression
[1:16:48] amen but we live and you learn amen
[1:16:51] mine
[1:16:52] I don't know how to do that see
[1:16:54] there's so many experiences like that
[1:16:55] you know they can't base new experience
[1:16:59] new things in life on your sometimes
[1:17:01] your old experiences
[1:17:03] you have to learn new things
[1:17:05] to encounter those things that you're
[1:17:07] going to
[1:17:08] meet up
[1:17:10] you know people have a way of like to
[1:17:11] copy paste their experiences
[1:17:14] like well I know about this so I'll do
[1:17:16] that I know how to do that so I'll do
[1:17:18] that um
[1:17:19] does it work like that
[1:17:21] every day
[1:17:22] you learn something new
[1:17:24] it's different
[1:17:25] it's a new challenge
[1:17:27] and as God escalates you as God builds
[1:17:29] you up
[1:17:30] into your Christian journey in your life
[1:17:33] you're gonna always encounter new things
[1:17:37] everything we know today
[1:17:40] because of something that someone taught
[1:17:42] us
[1:17:42] isn't that right
[1:17:44] body of science that they call science
[1:17:47] is something that has been accumulated
[1:17:49] knowledge over a period of years
[1:17:52] isn't that right over a period of time
[1:17:55] is when they're looking at icebergs and
[1:17:56] slopes and geography and stuff like that
[1:17:58] all of that is a collection of data a
[1:18:02] collection of tests and research that
[1:18:03] have been done over time to show the
[1:18:06] progress of things or the degrading of
[1:18:08] things or whatever you can only see that
[1:18:10] over time and that's how God likes to do
[1:18:13] us he likes to stretch us out over time
[1:18:17] to see what we're really made of it's
[1:18:20] one thing to say In the Heat of the
[1:18:22] Moment I'll Follow You Lord I love you
[1:18:24] Lord I'll do your works and your
[1:18:25] Commandments but blessed is he that
[1:18:27] actually keep it my Commandments he it
[1:18:30] is that loveth me many people seen with
[1:18:32] their mouths but they're not actually
[1:18:34] doing it and then there are people who
[1:18:36] may not even say it but they're doing it
[1:18:39] and God will bless them for what they
[1:18:41] have done
[1:18:46] these are great in the Kingdom isn't
[1:18:48] that right oh Hallelujah so we must keep
[1:18:50] going to it all right
[1:18:52] so Christ so we must move to Leading the
[1:18:55] People to Christ
[1:18:56] God is looking for true Shepherds he
[1:18:58] believed that this morning
[1:19:00] ones who are willing to go into the
[1:19:02] fiery fullness if they have to
[1:19:04] as he said on God called man isn't that
[1:19:05] right I've appointed people to Christ
[1:19:07] God call man point the people to Christ
[1:19:09] point the people back to the faith
[1:19:12] that was once delivered unto the Saints
[1:19:15] that's what the adoption is all about
[1:19:16] it's not right the adopted son must
[1:19:18] first learn to have power over himself
[1:19:20] before he can have power over others and
[1:19:24] other things
[1:19:25] and if you cannot have power over
[1:19:27] yourself then you become a tyrant isn't
[1:19:30] that right power without character is
[1:19:33] satanic
[1:19:34] it's not fair to rule it's not right if
[1:19:36] you can have power over yourself
[1:19:38] then you can be Faithfully much amen no
[1:19:40] he's faithful and little we'll be
[1:19:42] faithful in much
[1:19:43] [Applause]
[1:19:45] so one must follow before he can leave
[1:19:46] isn't that right
[1:19:48] you can't lead anyone until you yourself
[1:19:50] know who you are
[1:19:52] and who is leading you
[1:19:55] okay
[1:19:57] dealership is about who you are as an
[1:20:00] individual
[1:20:01] because what you do your actions you
[1:20:04] take the decisions you make every day is
[1:20:08] a reflection of who you really are
[1:20:12] the actions you take
[1:20:14] the decisions you make
[1:20:16] the choices you take every day shows who
[1:20:20] you are truly
[1:20:22] as an individual doesn't matter what you
[1:20:24] say with your mouth
[1:20:26] but as if you could back that up with
[1:20:28] your with your works that do truly
[1:20:30] follow to show that you have faith in
[1:20:33] God
[1:20:34] and that you truly believe because faded
[1:20:36] out works
[1:20:38] is dead so you can't say you have faith
[1:20:40] and then who knows your car and then a
[1:20:43] corner you're afraid to trust God you're
[1:20:46] afraid to pray you're afraid to ah do
[1:20:49] the right thing even when nobody is
[1:20:51] watching that's not faith faith is when
[1:20:54] you believe
[1:20:55] you as an individual are willing to step
[1:20:58] out
[1:20:59] regardless of the circumstance
[1:21:02] regardless of what you are faced with
[1:21:04] you as an individual see something
[1:21:08] see something a vision that is greater
[1:21:11] than you
[1:21:12] and it does something in your heart it
[1:21:15] lifts you up and inspires you into
[1:21:18] action it inspires you into a movement
[1:21:21] it inspires you to do something for the
[1:21:25] Lord and as you become inspired you
[1:21:28] inspire others by your actions and by
[1:21:30] your words if you could be inspired this
[1:21:33] morning if we could have inspired
[1:21:35] fathers then we could have inspired
[1:21:37] mothers and if we could have inspired
[1:21:39] mothers we love inspired children and if
[1:21:42] we have inspired children we love
[1:21:44] inspired households then when you come
[1:21:46] into the house of God it's a whole bunch
[1:21:49] of inspired people coming to meet the
[1:21:52] Lord coming with fridge to move
[1:21:55] mountains come in with feet to know that
[1:21:58] God is and that he is a rewarder of them
[1:22:01] that diligently seek him oh it starts
[1:22:05] with you
[1:22:06] stops with us it starts with us as
[1:22:08] individuals in our homes in our lives in
[1:22:12] our workplaces how we treat people how
[1:22:15] we respect people how we forgive people
[1:22:18] how we put away gossiping back biting
[1:22:21] evils amazing it starts with you and
[1:22:25] then you bring the Revival
[1:22:27] [Music]
[1:22:28] the onus is on you somebody say man
[1:22:34] Hallelujah
[1:22:35] Lori the car
[1:22:37] adults in Christ
[1:22:43] adults in Christ
[1:22:46] that's what God wants
[1:22:47] [Applause]
[1:22:50] not this baby stuff
[1:22:52] Paul said when I was a child I taught as
[1:22:54] a child I understood as a child
[1:22:56] when I became a man
[1:22:58] put away
[1:23:00] childish things
[1:23:02] Jesus told Simon Peter he said when
[1:23:04] they're young
[1:23:05] you're good yourself on your own
[1:23:07] you go where you want and do what you
[1:23:09] want
[1:23:10] but when you get older
[1:23:12] someone will gird you
[1:23:13] they will carry you to a place
[1:23:16] where you don't want to go
[1:23:18] you have to be willing this morning to
[1:23:20] be leadable
[1:23:21] for God to be able to lead you
[1:23:24] the Bible said he leaded me beside the
[1:23:27] Still Waters He restored my soul he
[1:23:31] leaded me in the paths of righteousness
[1:23:33] for his namesake oh Holly but yeah
[1:23:36] sometimes I walk through the valley of
[1:23:39] the shadow of death but even there he is
[1:23:42] with me oh hallelujah hallelujah I wrote
[1:23:45] a nice half they Comfort Me Now pass a
[1:23:50] table for me
[1:23:51] in the presence of mine enemies people
[1:23:55] who don't like me but Jesus loved me it
[1:23:58] don't matter what they think it don't
[1:24:00] matter how they feel do good to them
[1:24:03] that use you and despitefully criticize
[1:24:07] you for on their part these evil spoken
[1:24:10] of but on your past he is glorified oh
[1:24:15] what shall we say to these things if God
[1:24:18] before us who can be against us this
[1:24:22] morning God is for you this morning God
[1:24:25] knows your every need and he can and he
[1:24:29] will save you help you restore you or
[1:24:35] strengthen to you
[1:24:39] Hallelujah
[1:24:44] you will
[1:24:45] if he doesn't do it
[1:24:47] and he's not gone
[1:24:49] because his word says
[1:24:51] he gives Beauty for Ashes
[1:24:53] is what it says he gives strength for
[1:24:56] fear
[1:24:57] his word says weeping endures but for a
[1:25:01] night but joy cometh in the morning you
[1:25:05] know what Joy is joy is when you're
[1:25:07] smiling in the middle of the madness Joy
[1:25:11] is when you could crack a smile when the
[1:25:13] whole wall coming down Joy is when you
[1:25:15] could be happy coming into the house of
[1:25:18] God this morning and you may not have a
[1:25:20] scent in your pocket but the God that
[1:25:23] was with you on the mountain is the same
[1:25:25] God in the valley he doesn't change his
[1:25:29] goodness when he's on the ballot then
[1:25:32] when he's in the manono he's the same
[1:25:34] God and he will and he can help you or
[1:25:39] he'll deliver you he'll restore you he
[1:25:43] knows
[1:25:44] what's good for you
[1:25:45] [Applause]
[1:25:49] and he's looking out for your good
[1:25:53] so don't get all nervous and frustrated
[1:25:56] but we do that sometimes though I do I
[1:25:58] do it
[1:26:00] get all nervous
[1:26:02] especially as the responsibility of
[1:26:04] father and so on you feel that weight on
[1:26:06] you
[1:26:07] that your decisions
[1:26:10] could destroy things It Could Make It or
[1:26:12] Break It
[1:26:14] but I love what David used to do
[1:26:16] Bible said he he said he would inquire
[1:26:18] again
[1:26:19] that's amazing
[1:26:21] remember this one time David one day
[1:26:23] they wanted to help us City out because
[1:26:25] they were out of the outskirts of Israel
[1:26:26] I think the kingdom domain and there was
[1:26:29] a city that was under siege and so on
[1:26:31] and they were considering whether to go
[1:26:33] and help
[1:26:34] the city
[1:26:35] so David said I will inquire the Lord
[1:26:38] see what he will want us to do
[1:26:41] he went and inquired
[1:26:43] God told him go you have my blessing
[1:26:46] so David came up to the men he said well
[1:26:49] God told us we could go to the city
[1:26:51] the men were perplexed because they were
[1:26:55] like are you sure we could go I mean are
[1:26:58] you sure this is what we should do
[1:27:00] because right now we're off the radar
[1:27:02] if we go and do this thing
[1:27:04] we will end up back on your radar you
[1:27:06] know so you sure you want us to go and
[1:27:09] do this because I mean I get the people
[1:27:12] who need help
[1:27:13] but but we under pressure too right now
[1:27:16] we're in hiding you sure this is what
[1:27:19] God wants us to do David said I
[1:27:21] understand I understand your concerns
[1:27:24] and the Bible said he went and inquired
[1:27:26] again
[1:27:27] unto the Lord to find out what they
[1:27:30] should do concern in this matter he had
[1:27:32] inquired already
[1:27:33] but I love how he wanted to inquire
[1:27:36] again
[1:27:37] ask of God again and God told him you
[1:27:40] are my blessing go right ahead and you
[1:27:42] know what that did it was a real lesson
[1:27:45] in humility
[1:27:46] because David as a leader he could have
[1:27:48] said go tell me to go
[1:27:50] you're telling me
[1:27:53] why is He Man In Charge here you owe me
[1:27:57] go talk to me
[1:27:58] tell me there we go
[1:28:00] without a problem no no he said no he
[1:28:04] humbled himself because he realized that
[1:28:05] man had concerns
[1:28:07] and even though he had prayed on his
[1:28:09] behalf
[1:28:10] when he inquired again he was preying on
[1:28:13] their behalf
[1:28:14] see what the Lord will say
[1:28:16] to see if there is a Good Shepherd
[1:28:19] behavior isn't that right to see if God
[1:28:21] really was had his mind on this matter
[1:28:24] if this was what God's leading was on
[1:28:26] this matter in this situation and when
[1:28:28] God gave him the second answer it
[1:28:30] satisfy the man and that's what David
[1:28:32] wanted because David couldn't go and do
[1:28:35] this thing alone he needed a man to go
[1:28:38] up with him and if the men are faint of
[1:28:41] Hearts how can they prepare for the
[1:28:43] battle how can they have victory in the
[1:28:45] battle but because he inquired again now
[1:28:48] the men feel confident that if the Lord
[1:28:51] be with us then we shall be able to
[1:28:54] overcome the enemy because this is the
[1:28:56] Lord's will David knew and the man knew
[1:29:00] that this was the Lord's will and
[1:29:02] sometimes brother sister you have to do
[1:29:05] things not just in the interest of
[1:29:07] yourself but in the inches of the people
[1:29:09] that honor your charge that honor your
[1:29:12] influence the people that you have
[1:29:14] rulership over they have concerns my
[1:29:18] brother my sister inquire again inquire
[1:29:21] again go on ask God if this is his will
[1:29:24] concerning this situation ask again and
[1:29:28] make sure
[1:29:30] this is what God wants
[1:29:36] nothing wrong
[1:29:38] asking the Lord
[1:29:41] ask him again
[1:29:43] ask him that's it
[1:29:45] something wrong with that
[1:29:46] if it's the same answer
[1:29:49] and God will uh confirm it
[1:29:52] but wait for his confirmation
[1:29:54] before you ride out into the sunset
[1:29:58] going off on your own mission
[1:30:00] having not yet sought Goods
[1:30:03] advice
[1:30:05] counsel
[1:30:06] some people don't even do it for
[1:30:08] themselves
[1:30:09] how much much far less for other people
[1:30:12] they have not considered
[1:30:14] in the equation of things
[1:30:16] because all affections or our our
[1:30:19] choices don't just affect us
[1:30:23] they affect other people
[1:30:25] you don't talk about second and third
[1:30:26] consequence and so forth
[1:30:29] to a choice
[1:30:30] later down the road something you don't
[1:30:32] see that far along
[1:30:34] you may not think that far along that
[1:30:35] something like that could happen
[1:30:38] but it does
[1:30:39] the fruits you eat today are the trees
[1:30:41] that were planted
[1:30:43] 20 years ago
[1:30:45] now
[1:30:49] plant a tree today
[1:30:50] because you don't know what fruits it
[1:30:52] will bear
[1:30:54] it may not be for you
[1:30:55] but it would be for somebody else
[1:30:58] it's not all for our prayer today
[1:31:01] give a sacrifice today
[1:31:03] do something today for the Lord and see
[1:31:06] if he don't reward you
[1:31:07] you don't if you don't reward your
[1:31:09] family your children there's much to
[1:31:11] benefit when we work for the Lord oh any
[1:31:14] work for ourselves we get our own reward
[1:31:17] women work for God he rewards us
[1:31:20] according to his riches and he is very
[1:31:23] rich in Mercy hallelujah oh Hallelujah
[1:31:28] he can bless you naturally bless you
[1:31:30] spiritually bless you in ways that you
[1:31:33] are not even prepared for David said my
[1:31:35] cup
[1:31:36] runneth over surely goodness and mercy
[1:31:40] shall follow me all the days of my life
[1:31:43] and I shall dwell in the house of the
[1:31:45] Lord
[1:31:46] forever and ever
[1:31:48] amen and amen
[1:31:51] are you enjoying him today
[1:31:53] well this is a
[1:31:55] this is a house of
[1:31:57] God's bread amen please
[1:31:59] we thank God to be here
[1:32:01] to hear his word
[1:32:03] you cannot lead it so you cannot lead
[1:32:05] yourself unless you know who you are
[1:32:06] who's leading you that's why Paul said
[1:32:08] follow me as I follow Christ
[1:32:11] he was he knew he was conscious and he
[1:32:13] is in a position of leadership
[1:32:15] but he also knew that he was under
[1:32:17] Authority that he had to answer to
[1:32:19] somebody
[1:32:20] that's accountability there so he told
[1:32:22] the people if you want to follow me
[1:32:23] that's fine
[1:32:25] but make sure it's within the brackets
[1:32:26] or it's within the context of how I
[1:32:29] follow Christ isn't that right make sure
[1:32:32] I'm on that page because if I ever get
[1:32:34] off that pitch run for your lives
[1:32:38] Run to the Hills run to these run
[1:32:40] through this but don't stay where I am
[1:32:42] because I'll lead you wrong I lead it
[1:32:44] the way I think
[1:32:45] another way God says it's two different
[1:32:47] things because the way there's a way
[1:32:50] that seemed right onto a man
[1:32:53] but the end thereof is dead
[1:32:55] a lot of things look right
[1:32:57] a lot of things seem right in our own
[1:32:59] eyes but I asked this morning have you
[1:33:02] inquired again
[1:33:04] to find out if this is really what the
[1:33:06] Lord wants you to do
[1:33:08] because if you haven't you might find
[1:33:10] yourself going two degrees north
[1:33:13] and it won't be long until you find
[1:33:14] yourself lost somewhere and then you'll
[1:33:17] have to come all the way back where you
[1:33:19] was
[1:33:20] and pick up God where you left him
[1:33:22] because he doesn't leave us
[1:33:24] we leave him can we say Amen
[1:33:28] you have to go back all the way and make
[1:33:29] all our treks
[1:33:31] all the things they lay down yeah
[1:33:34] all the things they said
[1:33:36] in your fixation
[1:33:39] you have to go and fix it
[1:33:42] all enthusia said
[1:33:44] did
[1:33:46] all that damage you caused
[1:33:48] to go back now
[1:33:50] fix it
[1:33:51] so one thing I learned in my job
[1:33:54] in graphic design is that if you do it
[1:33:57] once right
[1:33:59] you don't have to do it again
[1:34:01] ever
[1:34:02] like it's finished
[1:34:04] do it right the first time and they
[1:34:07] don't ever have to go back and take that
[1:34:09] up again
[1:34:10] matter of fact when you go back and you
[1:34:12] look at it you'll be so pleased be like
[1:34:14] that was some good work that is some
[1:34:16] good stuff because it was done right oh
[1:34:19] Hallelujah and God wants your life to
[1:34:21] come out right he wants to spend time on
[1:34:24] you this morning or to beat out the
[1:34:26] dross beat out the impurities beat out
[1:34:29] the things that are not of him beat out
[1:34:32] the contrary desires beat out the
[1:34:35] strange Gods from among you so that you
[1:34:38] could be clean and holy and presented
[1:34:41] blameless before him in love that's the
[1:34:45] purpose of the Gospel not for ourselves
[1:34:47] but to serve the people to help them to
[1:34:51] lift them up higher to let them realize
[1:34:54] that there is a God out there somewhere
[1:34:57] who loves them and wants what's best for
[1:35:00] them oh Hallelujah Jesus said the son of
[1:35:03] man came not to be ministered to
[1:35:07] to minister to others
[1:35:12] okay let me read something here
[1:35:14] it's about the atmosphere you create
[1:35:19] that's what it is I'm talking about
[1:35:20] leadership you mentioned you notice I
[1:35:22] talk about leadership a lot and that's
[1:35:24] because I believe in this message here
[1:35:25] true Shepherds and how God showed it to
[1:35:27] me
[1:35:27] was that when God always talks about
[1:35:29] leadership he always brings it within
[1:35:31] the context of a Shepherd caring for his
[1:35:34] flock
[1:35:35] okay so I hope that connects the dots
[1:35:36] this morning for you and I keep talking
[1:35:39] about this leadership thing but really
[1:35:40] what it is it's God's idea of how he
[1:35:43] takes care of us and how he expects us
[1:35:46] to take care of others because that's
[1:35:49] what adoption is about God's Gonna
[1:35:51] Elevate you to opposition where you are
[1:35:53] in charge of many things and you have to
[1:35:56] be able to account for that you have to
[1:35:58] be able to have God's spirit God's will
[1:36:00] God's character God's Behavior
[1:36:02] to know how to treat with the things
[1:36:04] that come your way
[1:36:06] the challenges are coming
[1:36:09] the situations that comes your way
[1:36:11] and that comes at a certain level of
[1:36:13] maturity
[1:36:15] comes at a level of understanding
[1:36:18] that it's not about you
[1:36:20] but it's actually all about you at the
[1:36:22] same time
[1:36:25] it's not about you it's not about what
[1:36:27] you know what great thing you can do God
[1:36:29] is great you're here to elevate God
[1:36:31] but then it's all about how you can
[1:36:34] surrender
[1:36:35] it's all about how you can let go it's
[1:36:38] all about how you can trust in the Lord
[1:36:41] trust in his power trust in his promises
[1:36:43] it's all about how you can be a better
[1:36:46] parent how you can be a better father
[1:36:49] mother how you can be a better son a
[1:36:52] better daughter
[1:36:53] because the truth is all of us are
[1:36:55] leaders
[1:36:57] all of us are influencers in some way
[1:36:59] and more we go up in life is a more
[1:37:02] people and lives and and and things that
[1:37:04] we are going to have influence over in
[1:37:07] the question will now rest upon Who You
[1:37:09] Are
[1:37:11] as an individual because who you are
[1:37:13] will reflect in the things that you do
[1:37:15] in a way that you treat with the
[1:37:17] decisions and the challenges that he and
[1:37:20] his wisdom put in your way
[1:37:22] to see what you're made out of and it
[1:37:25] always exposes the weakness
[1:37:28] it's not right that's what testing is
[1:37:31] about
[1:37:32] when they build I think when they're
[1:37:33] doing house electricals I think uh
[1:37:35] heard this before
[1:37:37] only working on house electricals they
[1:37:38] have to test the electricals let's see
[1:37:40] if it works turn the switch on and see
[1:37:41] if it actually comes on
[1:37:43] inspect it make sure it passes because
[1:37:45] if they run a wire and then they turn
[1:37:48] the switch and nothing happens then
[1:37:51] wrong one something went wrong Somebody
[1:37:54] went wrong something went wrong
[1:37:55] somewhere because it's supposed to work
[1:37:58] and in order to test the system to see
[1:38:00] if it works God has to test the system
[1:38:02] in order to see through it today yeah
[1:38:04] you must receive it works it has to be
[1:38:06] tested praise God and you can't just
[1:38:09] come true life like you know praise God
[1:38:12] just as God as as brother Branham said
[1:38:14] take you to one end of a pipe and then
[1:38:17] pull you through to the other end and
[1:38:19] then say blessed is he that overcome it
[1:38:21] you did nothing you just got pulled
[1:38:23] through with a rope that's not how it
[1:38:25] works no no no as long as you have
[1:38:28] breath in this body you are going to be
[1:38:30] tested you are going to be tried you are
[1:38:33] going to be proven to be the right kind
[1:38:36] of a son to be the right kind of a
[1:38:39] daughter to be the right kind of an
[1:38:41] individual that God could be pleased
[1:38:44] about because God wants to say oh here
[1:38:47] is my beloved Son in who I'm well
[1:38:50] pleased hear ye him yeah he is my
[1:38:54] daughter in whom I'm well pleased here's
[1:38:57] my servant in whom I'm well pleased God
[1:38:59] wants to speak this over you
[1:39:01] he's longing to do it
[1:39:03] bring you out to a ceremony somewhere
[1:39:06] adoption
[1:39:08] place you in there he wants to do that
[1:39:10] but you've got to come through the
[1:39:11] process
[1:39:12] so God is just
[1:39:14] he's like the father from The Prodigal
[1:39:16] Son he's looking out for you
[1:39:18] to come into the fold and with every
[1:39:21] step you take you're getting closer to
[1:39:23] the goal closer to home he wants to
[1:39:25] pronounce it over he wants to give it
[1:39:27] his robe he wants to give you his ring
[1:39:29] he wants to kill the fatted calf and all
[1:39:31] that but you've got to come in
[1:39:33] for him to give it to you you can't get
[1:39:35] it over there you have to walk towards
[1:39:37] the kingdom keep walking towards the
[1:39:39] gore keep walking towards a victory how
[1:39:43] do you do it when you pray every day how
[1:39:45] do you do it when you praise God how do
[1:39:48] you do it when you wake up this morning
[1:39:49] and put your clothes on and said I'm
[1:39:52] going to the house of the Lord doesn't
[1:39:54] matter how I feel doesn't matter what's
[1:39:56] going on the holy spirit is watching
[1:39:59] your attitude and he is pleased when you
[1:40:02] walk in here despite the challenges that
[1:40:04] the Holy Spirit tutor knows you have
[1:40:06] every day you still choose to walk in
[1:40:08] here and God will give you the victory
[1:40:11] today he'll give you the victory
[1:40:13] tomorrow just keep having a right
[1:40:15] attitude and God will bless you this
[1:40:18] morning somebody give him a shot of
[1:40:20] praise

[1:40:27] [Applause]
[1:40:33] God
[1:40:38] oh my time is going
[1:40:41] but uh I always get a few things in here
[1:40:42] and then let's wrap up amen
[1:40:44] so praise the Lord you're feeling fine
[1:40:47] all right leadership is about the
[1:40:49] atmosphere you create I want to read
[1:40:50] this quote here from the prophet I love
[1:40:51] this expectation 1954. he said see
[1:40:55] you are a Creator in yourself
[1:40:58] he said if you he said uh how many born
[1:41:00] again again how many is born again say
[1:41:02] Amen congregation says amen he said do
[1:41:04] you know each one of you as a Creator
[1:41:06] you are a part of God
[1:41:08] you're a Son of God an offspring of God
[1:41:11] a daughter of God is that right he said
[1:41:13] then you're a creator
[1:41:16] he said now did you ever see people
[1:41:18] they were nice people I ain't saying
[1:41:21] this for anybody now he said but nice
[1:41:23] people but but you just couldn't hardly
[1:41:25] stand to be around him you know that he
[1:41:28] said they're nice people he said but
[1:41:30] it's their atmosphere they're in
[1:41:33] he said now then you've seen other
[1:41:34] people that you just long to be with
[1:41:36] them is that right he said it's that
[1:41:39] atmosphere that's around them all the
[1:41:42] time
[1:41:42] he said no my wife sat back here she
[1:41:45] didn't know this but she's supposed to
[1:41:47] be here somewhere
[1:41:48] and you can imagine in our home about
[1:41:50] what's take place in a run of a day
[1:41:51] people coming in going out like that
[1:41:54] Senator the prophet said I go in
[1:41:56] sometimes oh and the poor little fellow
[1:41:58] is in there in the kitchen crying
[1:42:00] talking about his wife
[1:42:02] not even a chance to cook
[1:42:04] the children anything to eat you today
[1:42:06] to the day and there it is
[1:42:09] and a little kitty little girl about two
[1:42:11] years old Sarah and Rebecca and then
[1:42:14] there they're crying and going on
[1:42:17] and my wife she's crying she's in the
[1:42:19] kitchen she'd look up and she'd say oh
[1:42:20] bill
[1:42:21] I'm just about to go crazy I don't know
[1:42:24] what I'm gonna do
[1:42:26] this is what dizzy atmosphere he means
[1:42:27] right
[1:42:28] right is that it she said I she said I
[1:42:32] I'm gray-headed at 34 years old and so
[1:42:35] I said well I said no that's that's
[1:42:37] right honey
[1:42:39] and the prophet said I never don't fuss
[1:42:42] at her
[1:42:43] see no no that that's right honey see he
[1:42:46] answers
[1:42:47] it's very bad but you see it's very bad
[1:42:50] so this is he's telling his wife now
[1:42:52] it's very bad but you see we're serving
[1:42:54] the lord you know so we we we sort of
[1:42:57] we're serving the lord and he says he
[1:42:58] said see what I'm doing in my heart all
[1:43:00] the time
[1:43:01] when I'm all uh I'm doing all the time
[1:43:04] in my heart I'm trying to create a
[1:43:06] different atmosphere
[1:43:08] they're all nervous
[1:43:10] they're tore up see now I was thinking
[1:43:13] in my heart he said oh Lord now
[1:43:15] this is in his heart now he's not saying
[1:43:17] this audibly he's in his heart he's
[1:43:19] saying oh Lord now send your presence
[1:43:21] and your love to my poor little tour of
[1:43:24] life
[1:43:25] and I say Yes dear now he's talking to
[1:43:27] his mouth he said yes there yes there
[1:43:29] that's right I said oh I said what's
[1:43:31] this here
[1:43:32] his wife says oh we haven't got anything
[1:43:34] to eat
[1:43:35] I say well there probably won't be
[1:43:38] anybody else for probably next couple of
[1:43:39] hours to visit the house she said well
[1:43:41] let's get something to eat and I'll help
[1:43:44] you
[1:43:44] he said and I'll start getting up my
[1:43:46] sleeves he said I start getting up my
[1:43:48] sleeves rolling them up
[1:43:50] and she'd say now look here young man
[1:43:52] you might be able to help me wash dishes
[1:43:54] but you can't cook and I'll say who
[1:43:56] can't cook he said like that you know I
[1:43:58] said what's going on you know he said
[1:44:00] what you haven't seen my fried potatoes
[1:44:02] yet I was raised on them you know like
[1:44:05] that like something like that you know
[1:44:06] he said I'll see this little itty bitty
[1:44:09] smile trickle on one side
[1:44:11] he said you know is it the first thing
[1:44:12] you know I come over I put my hand on
[1:44:15] her she don't know what I'm doing yet
[1:44:17] and I say bless your heart honey I'll
[1:44:19] tell you what I'll I'll help you with
[1:44:20] this
[1:44:21] and then down in my heart I'm saying
[1:44:24] Lord send your peace
[1:44:26] send your peace that is in me amen send
[1:44:29] your peace that is in me into her now oh
[1:44:32] God quiet my family now I am your
[1:44:36] servant father send your peace and so
[1:44:38] and then the next thing you know she'd
[1:44:40] say Bill you know a certain thing and
[1:44:42] then them all black eyes are snapping
[1:44:44] again you know he said you know oh yeah
[1:44:45] he said I said yeah he said oh I said
[1:44:47] and I looked at the baby she's in there
[1:44:50] she's got her blocks and the babies are
[1:44:52] playing together what is it it's created
[1:44:55] an atmosphere oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:44:59] kind answer
[1:45:01] turn it away around oh Hallelujah God
[1:45:03] given his Prophet wisdom how to deal
[1:45:06] with daily situations everybody's all
[1:45:09] nervous and frustrated
[1:45:11] but if you are a leader you can't get
[1:45:13] all nervous and frustrator too it
[1:45:14] doesn't help
[1:45:16] we need somebody to hold the reins
[1:45:19] to be level-headed to be in the spirit
[1:45:22] to be in the atmosphere
[1:45:24] because if you flying off the island
[1:45:26] everywhere
[1:45:27] they handle every final battle
[1:45:29] everything will sell the handle
[1:45:32] that makes no sense
[1:45:34] there'll be more wreckage
[1:45:36] so what God wants is for someone to be
[1:45:38] in the spirit
[1:45:39] because he can't use you if you're not
[1:45:42] in the spirit
[1:45:43] and once you're in the spirits now you
[1:45:45] can be used of God to create something
[1:45:47] new to create a new atmosphere isn't
[1:45:50] that right or to do something different
[1:45:51] I can't answer turn away around you use
[1:45:54] wisdom in your situation you use
[1:45:56] knowledge oh the prophet said knowing
[1:45:58] what is in the brother's heart going the
[1:46:00] extra mile with them having Temperance
[1:46:03] with them having brotherly kindness with
[1:46:05] them having godliness with them having
[1:46:08] knowledge oh Hallelujah that's why we
[1:46:10] have to have these things
[1:46:13] that's why it's imperative we have these
[1:46:15] things
[1:46:16] because it's these virtues
[1:46:18] these spiritual virtues that's gonna
[1:46:21] help us to deal with the challenges as
[1:46:24] they come
[1:46:25] and more and more what we ought to see
[1:46:27] is more of God in our lives it's more
[1:46:30] positive change Hallelujah because you
[1:46:32] can create an atmosphere you can create
[1:46:34] an atmosphere this morning doesn't
[1:46:36] matter what doubt is in your mind if you
[1:46:38] lift your hand up this morning and you
[1:46:40] choose to have the right attitude and
[1:46:42] surrender God can bless you this morning
[1:46:45] more than you are prepared to be blessed
[1:46:47] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh
[1:46:52] God could do something for you God can
[1:46:54] change the situation that you left this
[1:46:56] morning when you come back to it it'll
[1:46:58] be a whole different situation just
[1:47:00] because of the attitude that you had
[1:47:03] Right In This Moment oh somebody help me
[1:47:07] Praise Him
[1:47:08] Hallelujah I'm here to create an
[1:47:10] atmosphere I'm here to prayer I'm here
[1:47:12] to praise I'm here to give him all the
[1:47:15] glory I'm here to give him all the honor
[1:47:17] because he's worthy of this he brought
[1:47:19] me through a mighty long way it would be
[1:47:23] remiss of me not to give God praise is
[1:47:26] for the blessings that I didn't deserve
[1:47:29] or he'll raise me up oh so that I could
[1:47:33] stand on mountains he raised me up above
[1:47:36] stormy seas I am stronger when I'm upon
[1:47:40] his shoulder because he is my Jesus I am
[1:47:44] his son he is my father oh and he loved
[1:47:48] me and he the Good Shepherd is looking
[1:47:51] for his sheep he's looking for you this
[1:47:53] morning he's looking for his
[1:47:55] predestinated ones he's elected once who
[1:47:58] he found you from since the beginning
[1:47:59] he's gonna find you he's gonna bring you
[1:48:02] back into the fall can we say Amen this
[1:48:06] morning
[1:48:08] oh my
[1:48:10] my God okay so I think I got that over
[1:48:13] wonderful support said follow me as I
[1:48:15] follow Christ he sets a condition he
[1:48:18] knew he was a leader he held a
[1:48:19] leadership position but deeper than that
[1:48:21] he charges the people to see to to watch
[1:48:24] his walk
[1:48:26] and to follow as he follows Christ
[1:48:28] isn't that right I am Divine here the
[1:48:31] branches the branches cannot bear fruit
[1:48:33] of itself so our job is really between
[1:48:36] this source of life
[1:48:39] and the fruit that's supposed to come
[1:48:40] out on the end
[1:48:42] our role and function as a bride of
[1:48:44] Christ is to be connected to that vine
[1:48:47] so that we can bring forth the fruit at
[1:48:50] the top of the tree that's our rule
[1:48:53] if we save ourselves I am a Vine I'll do
[1:48:55] it myself it won't work because you're
[1:48:58] not a Vine you're a branch you are not
[1:49:00] the Holy Spirit the holy is he the holy
[1:49:03] spirit will come upon you and take the
[1:49:06] word that is in you and bring it to life
[1:49:08] the spirit is the life Giver to the word
[1:49:11] you Just Surrender yourself and he the
[1:49:14] Holy Spirit Will Mount Your Hallelujah
[1:49:16] you the word and write you oh Olive
[1:49:19] isn't that right oh hallelujah
[1:49:21] hallelujah hallelujah write you to your
[1:49:23] destination
[1:49:25] it's nine so we have to understand what
[1:49:28] our role is what our function is
[1:49:31] because when we mess that picture up
[1:49:34] that's when on the strange Revelations
[1:49:36] that are coming out some people think
[1:49:38] they're fruit some people think they're
[1:49:39] Vine some people think they're both
[1:49:42] some people are trying to do it all
[1:49:45] one band Charlie
[1:49:48] you know
[1:49:49] and that's not your role and function
[1:49:51] it's like Prophet said you know you God
[1:49:53] call it raise corn
[1:49:55] but you watching someone else's barley
[1:49:57] or someone else's wheat and you're
[1:49:59] jealous for that because
[1:50:01] wheat is nice I like wheat let's try
[1:50:03] wheat let's do that no God didn't raise
[1:50:06] you up for that he gave you corn stay
[1:50:08] with what he gave you oh and God will
[1:50:11] bless you
[1:50:12] bless you oh hello this other man's
[1:50:14] supposed to rain sweet let him raise his
[1:50:16] weak leave the man alone God is
[1:50:18] inspiring him to do that every church is
[1:50:20] Sovereign under god oh Hallelujah we
[1:50:23] don't have to answer praise God to any
[1:50:25] other church or any other group we
[1:50:27] answer to the Holy Spirit whatever the
[1:50:29] past is inspired to do that he does only
[1:50:32] the inspiration of the Holy Spirit oh
[1:50:35] and God will show us where to go where
[1:50:37] to put our foot what to say how to do
[1:50:40] how to say it or and if it's truly God
[1:50:42] he'll burn the candle on both ends and
[1:50:45] he will show that he is the one who is
[1:50:48] coordinating it all together oh it's a
[1:50:51] holy spirit that was sent to lead the
[1:50:53] church not man sent to lead a church but
[1:50:56] the holy spirit is what God gave to lead
[1:50:58] the church in the end time the Holy
[1:51:01] Spirit Joshua the holy spirit is God and
[1:51:04] time leader in the church to lead you to
[1:51:07] your top channel to lead you to your
[1:51:09] Perfection to lead you to possess your
[1:51:13] individual inheritance to lead you to
[1:51:15] possess what you know is your own
[1:51:17] because we know this morning that there
[1:51:20] is much more land to be possessed there
[1:51:23] is much more miracles in store greater
[1:51:25] things are yet to come greater things
[1:51:28] are still to be done in Trinidad and
[1:51:31] Tobago they haven't seen the bride yet
[1:51:33] but here comes the bride she's marching
[1:51:36] she's marching on towards Holiness
[1:51:38] marching on towards Purity marching on
[1:51:41] towards adoption marching on towards
[1:51:43] Perfection God has called us church for
[1:51:46] glorious wonderful baptism of the Holy
[1:51:50] Spirit God has called you Church to a
[1:51:53] mighty Revival where the sick will be
[1:51:55] healed when the plan will see where the
[1:51:58] will walk with a gospel we
[1:52:01] preacherous
[1:52:02] somebody give us out
[1:52:05] whoa
[1:52:06] God is calling you this morning get me
[1:52:09] up let's get on fire let's get the
[1:52:12] prison let's get to worshiping let's
[1:52:14] pray without ceasing pray without season
[1:52:16] pray without season pray without cease
[1:52:19] in until every one of these virtues are
[1:52:22] living in us that we're gonna have a
[1:52:24] seven seal seven tunnel refiler as
[1:52:27] restored by malachite 4.
[1:52:30] [Music]
[1:52:32] oh
[1:52:34] [Music]
[1:52:35] him
[1:52:36] do you believe it
[1:52:39] that's what they raised up for
[1:52:42] so all of this is not bringing us into
[1:52:44] maturity
[1:52:45] so that we can handle that because a lot
[1:52:47] of people like to talk about power
[1:52:48] really sick where is he dead good exact
[1:52:50] man boy speak the word flashlight yeah
[1:52:53] yeah somewhere good they're real cool I
[1:52:55] want to be that I want to be back man I
[1:52:56] want to be Superman
[1:53:02] that's not it
[1:53:05] that's not it at all
[1:53:07] these things aren't toys that you just
[1:53:09] play with
[1:53:11] you don't give a child a knife
[1:53:13] you cut themselves don't get them a
[1:53:15] sword
[1:53:16] you don't know how to handle it yet
[1:53:18] I've been experience in battle
[1:53:21] sometimes little children they give them
[1:53:22] wooden swords
[1:53:23] yeah let them jump just a little bit get
[1:53:25] used to it
[1:53:26] sometimes the king
[1:53:27] Joseph's Sons little wooden swords
[1:53:29] they're playing with
[1:53:31] sometimes you feel like you're winning
[1:53:33] and then you can do so hit the money
[1:53:35] girl and you realize
[1:53:37] still have plenty to learn
[1:53:39] pick him up he said don't worry
[1:53:41] dragon
[1:53:45] and the leaders are showing I'm showing
[1:53:47] him giving him a little Victory let him
[1:53:49] feel good
[1:53:51] give him something
[1:53:53] All Eyes jumps in
[1:53:55] all that is training
[1:53:57] well as getting used to the real thing
[1:53:59] you're not ready for the shop sword yet
[1:54:01] just give you something wooden to just
[1:54:04] learn how to do it
[1:54:06] the real thing come in
[1:54:08] the real test coming
[1:54:10] I remember talking about training amen
[1:54:13] for the battle
[1:54:15] that is the other head you need training
[1:54:18] first
[1:54:18] you can't run into this battle and you
[1:54:20] don't know what to do most I could give
[1:54:22] you is a messenger boy post
[1:54:24] carry messages across the battlefield
[1:54:25] and even with that
[1:54:27] you still need another run you need to
[1:54:29] know what a land might look like because
[1:54:31] you can run on top of one on bow end of
[1:54:33] messenger next
[1:54:38] so everything needs training you can't
[1:54:41] just run into something
[1:54:42] I know what it is terrible attitude you
[1:54:44] get blown up
[1:54:45] see afternoon you have to be familiar
[1:54:47] with the original dollar
[1:54:49] the genuine article so that if the fake
[1:54:51] thing comes by you
[1:54:53] can do it you pick it up one time say
[1:54:55] something wrong with that pass it to the
[1:54:58] UV light dismissing something we can't
[1:55:00] accept this because I know what the
[1:55:02] genuine thing is and we got to be
[1:55:04] trained by the Holy Spirit to know what
[1:55:07] the holy spirit is what the Holy Spirit
[1:55:09] wants because even the Holy Spirit
[1:55:11] himself subjects himself to the word the
[1:55:14] Holy Spirit only recognizes the word he
[1:55:17] can't recognize Creeds he can't
[1:55:18] recognize dogmas he can't recognize
[1:55:20] Ben's ideas men's opinions he can only
[1:55:24] recognize the word
[1:55:26] when you obey the word and you do all
[1:55:29] that he asks you to do then comes his
[1:55:32] Spirit to confirm the word and make it
[1:55:34] alive oh Hallelujah
[1:55:38] Hallelujah and then when that happens
[1:55:39] we'll see him moving In and Out Among Us
[1:55:42] confirming his word confirming the thing
[1:55:44] he said praise God confirming the king's
[1:55:47] decree isn't that right amen that's what
[1:55:49] the spirit is here to do
[1:55:51] it's not right
[1:55:53] so the problem we have today is that
[1:55:55] people pay the attention and they
[1:55:56] respect so much to the words of men
[1:55:59] that the word of God gets lost to the
[1:56:01] people the leaders today are pointing
[1:56:02] the people to themselves not to God and
[1:56:04] that's what God points out here in the
[1:56:08] scripture Ezekiel Ezekiel 34.
[1:56:10] that we read
[1:56:12] the leaders are pointing the people to
[1:56:14] themselves
[1:56:16] they have their own agenda and I kind of
[1:56:17] label them as tyrants
[1:56:19] you know
[1:56:21] uh
[1:56:22] the prophet said there's too many voices
[1:56:24] it comes harder to hear the voice of God
[1:56:25] it's not right
[1:56:27] that's right
[1:56:28] there was a book written called the
[1:56:30] prince by a guy called Nicolo
[1:56:32] Machiavelli
[1:56:34] uh some may know of it
[1:56:36] who studied early Advanced literature
[1:56:39] and stuff like that political science
[1:56:41] would this book have some stuff in it
[1:56:43] that's really deceptive
[1:56:45] it's really narcissistic it's really
[1:56:47] self-centered
[1:56:49] it's actually it's kind of a poisonous
[1:56:51] text to be honest and a lot of the ideas
[1:56:53] that are in the book
[1:56:54] I think this book was published an idea
[1:56:56] 1500 and something oh
[1:56:59] but it amazed me because I was studying
[1:57:01] the life of different tyrants in history
[1:57:03] because I was going into this subject
[1:57:05] really deeply and I don't think I could
[1:57:06] get all of it today but I prayed a lot
[1:57:08] of bless you somehow amen by what we've
[1:57:10] been able to share here this morning
[1:57:12] but I went into kind of this study of
[1:57:15] tyranny and tyrants and to see how
[1:57:17] throughout the ages these rulers and
[1:57:19] these overloads throughout the history
[1:57:21] have wrecked and caused damage and harm
[1:57:25] to the lives of innocent people
[1:57:28] who themselves were in a vulnerable
[1:57:32] place
[1:57:33] you know so a lot of times there are
[1:57:35] poor economic situations in a country
[1:57:37] and this is becomes like a petri dish a
[1:57:40] petri dish
[1:57:41] for tyrants to begin to move inside of
[1:57:44] that
[1:57:45] because the spirit
[1:57:46] so it's an anointing that comes upon
[1:57:48] them that makes them behave and act in a
[1:57:51] way and when it's just like you want to
[1:57:54] see what's in a man give him power
[1:57:56] see what's inside of him give him power
[1:57:59] give him money give him something that
[1:58:00] that empowers him that gives him the
[1:58:02] ability to do things and watch what he
[1:58:04] does with it his choices after a while
[1:58:07] are going to expose who he is
[1:58:11] not right
[1:58:12] that's like when Samuel uh and I was
[1:58:14] hoping to get it but we'll touch on it
[1:58:16] maybe I won't get it we'll touch it now
[1:58:18] Samuel when he uh was in order to came
[1:58:21] to him told him said we don't have any
[1:58:22] confidence in your ministry anymore
[1:58:24] because your son's not walking your way
[1:58:26] so we want a king
[1:58:29] Samuel was on the word but they judged
[1:58:31] him based on what his sons were doing
[1:58:33] you see but he was on the word see but
[1:58:36] they wanted a king they said we reject
[1:58:37] your leadership we want a king make us a
[1:58:39] king and Samuel is disturbed by the same
[1:58:43] by their request why would they desire
[1:58:45] this why would they want this when he
[1:58:47] went to the Lord God told him he said
[1:58:49] you they haven't rejected you
[1:58:53] after all and he went back and he caught
[1:58:55] Egypt he said after all I did for them I
[1:58:58] brought them out of Egypt brought them
[1:59:00] out of the Honda host of bondage I
[1:59:03] brought them out from a tyrant out from
[1:59:05] a pharaoh who knew not Joseph who was
[1:59:09] not acquainted with my ways and my
[1:59:10] principles a tyrant rose up among them
[1:59:13] and burdened them with sorrows and beat
[1:59:16] them mercilessly and made them make
[1:59:18] bricks without straw after I brought
[1:59:20] them up out of that entire land of their
[1:59:23] own possession into their own way
[1:59:26] they now want another time
[1:59:33] God was God was always like what
[1:59:37] you know
[1:59:38] but he said you know what if they want
[1:59:40] if that's what they want
[1:59:41] tell them everyone but they hear what
[1:59:43] God tell them he said let them know
[1:59:46] what will happen if you ask for a king I
[1:59:51] want to read it I I know time is going
[1:59:53] but I want to get to get through all
[1:59:55] right first time I'll eat let me just
[1:59:57] run real quick if you want to pick it up
[1:59:59] too that's fine
[2:00:00] um you don't have to but I'll read it
[2:00:02] all
[2:00:02] amen just to you and um
[2:00:05] uh yeah so okay
[2:00:09] Samuel warns Israel this is boosted
[2:00:11] right I love this Bible that's good
[2:00:13] because they mark this off okay verse 10
[2:00:16] I said and Samuel told all the words of
[2:00:17] the Lord unto the people that asked of
[2:00:20] him a king
[2:00:21] and he said this will be the manner of
[2:00:23] the king that shall reign over you
[2:00:27] actually give them a Manifesto
[2:00:30] you know he said he will take your sons
[2:00:32] and appoint them for himself
[2:00:34] for his chariots and to his Horsemen and
[2:00:37] to some shall run before his chariots
[2:00:39] and he will appoint him captains over
[2:00:41] thousands and captains over 50s and will
[2:00:44] set them to air his ground and to reap
[2:00:47] his Harvest notice all about him there's
[2:00:50] a lot about him going on not about God
[2:00:52] see he said and to make his instruments
[2:00:54] of war and instruments of his chariots
[2:00:56] he will take your daughters to be
[2:00:59] confectionaries sweetie makers and to be
[2:01:02] cooks and to be Bakers and he will take
[2:01:04] your fields and your Vineyards and your
[2:01:07] oilier Olive yards and even the best of
[2:01:09] them and give them to his servants and
[2:01:12] he will take the tent of your seed and
[2:01:14] of your Vineyards and give to his
[2:01:16] officers and to his servants and he will
[2:01:18] take your immense servants and your maid
[2:01:20] servants and your goodliest young men
[2:01:23] and your asses and so forth and put them
[2:01:25] to his work
[2:01:31] this is this is cool like I wish
[2:01:33] somebody could tell me this you know

[2:06:02] [Applause]
[2:06:03] God
[2:06:04] I was making appointment with this book
[2:06:06] right the prince yeah so this book is
[2:06:09] written in 1500 and there's a guy named
[2:06:11] uh by the name of Francois duvalier
[2:06:13] somebody know him he's a Great Dictator
[2:06:16] in Haiti
[2:06:17] he was a really evil guy
[2:06:20] like really crazy
[2:06:22] today is still suffering under the
[2:06:25] severity of his leadership and of the
[2:06:27] seeds that he planted Haiti has now
[2:06:28] eaten food from that still eating food
[2:06:31] from that repercussions
[2:06:33] from the choices that he made as a
[2:06:35] leader and had affected entire country
[2:06:37] of people
[2:06:38] and uh
[2:06:40] please so soon and it said that he
[2:06:43] actually Drew inspiration from this very
[2:06:44] book the prince
[2:06:46] where he talked about you know being
[2:06:48] feared it's better to be fair than to be
[2:06:49] loved if you can't be both and he
[2:06:51] indoctrinated that into himself and
[2:06:54] practiced that and use violence and
[2:06:57] force just like um what we read and if
[2:06:59] you kill 34 ruling the people tyranny
[2:07:01] and the fist of iron yeah driving the
[2:07:05] machine of War yeah it's not right i'm
[2:07:08] subjecting the people to fear subjected
[2:07:10] people the condemnation subjecting the
[2:07:12] people to all sorts of manipulation and
[2:07:14] Powers
[2:07:16] man who ruled
[2:07:17] the rule of this world oh what comes up
[2:07:20] when you give a man power because as
[2:07:22] nature is corrupt is corrupt to begin
[2:07:24] with so all of the fantasies all of the
[2:07:27] lusts and the desires of Hearts men
[2:07:28] men's Hearts begin to rise to the
[2:07:30] surface anytime power comes into play
[2:07:33] but God wants a people that we are so
[2:07:36] blessed that when he blesses them they
[2:07:38] become more humble or because the only
[2:07:41] way up is down and the only way to
[2:07:43] heaven is on your knees oh cat on your
[2:07:46] knees and see how humble you can become
[2:07:48] and then God can raise you up and God
[2:07:51] could Elevate you learn to control
[2:07:53] yourself
[2:07:56] before you control others
[2:07:58] another thing seek ye first
[2:08:01] kingdom of God and then all the other
[2:08:04] things
[2:08:05] God will give to you
[2:08:07] he will give to you
[2:08:09] if you have your your your your motive
[2:08:11] right
[2:08:12] objective right
[2:08:14] how do you judge a man by the way he
[2:08:15] says it his word
[2:08:17] it's not to see what motive and
[2:08:18] objective he has
[2:08:19] if he's trying to draw people himself
[2:08:21] or is he trying to do something for the
[2:08:23] truly for the kingdom of God
[2:08:25] voice people
[2:08:26] watch how he treats this different
[2:08:28] different things and different ones
[2:08:31] then you'll see what a man's made of
[2:08:33] it's like that's and it stretches over
[2:08:35] time
[2:08:37] because it's good to come in church oh I
[2:08:39] love your brother yeah God bless you
[2:08:41] that's nice everybody in Church's nice
[2:08:44] everybody just dressed nice look nice
[2:08:50] but when the pressure hit
[2:08:52] when the bottom falls out
[2:08:56] of church now
[2:08:58] different thing see
[2:09:00] that's the real you
[2:09:02] yeah that's the one that goes to sleep
[2:09:04] at night
[2:09:05] that's the one that has to pray to the
[2:09:06] Lord and ask God for wisdom for tomorrow
[2:09:09] because you honestly don't know the way
[2:09:12] you know we try to kill ourselves and
[2:09:14] think we do
[2:09:15] the truth is
[2:09:16] really don't
[2:09:18] we try to plan for it
[2:09:20] but the Bible said take God to establish
[2:09:22] your plan
[2:09:23] you do you make a plan
[2:09:25] you've gone to establish that
[2:09:27] forget about it
[2:09:29] seek to find God's will
[2:09:31] for yourself
[2:09:33] for everything else
[2:09:34] seek the fine as well amen
[2:09:36] oh my
[2:09:38] God but it's so interesting to me that
[2:09:39] this book The Prince by Nicole Nicole
[2:09:41] Machiavelli was preserved for so much
[2:09:45] years
[2:09:46] and then this guy uh in the early 1900s
[2:09:49] picked up this book and and and was able
[2:09:52] to manifest the words that was written
[2:09:53] in that book and I told myself that if
[2:09:56] that man could read the words of a man
[2:10:00] and be anointed and inspired by that to
[2:10:03] do the works of a man then how much more
[2:10:07] is the Bible this morning
[2:10:09] an inspired book of words that we could
[2:10:13] pick up in 2023 it's been written years
[2:10:17] and thousands of years ago but it still
[2:10:20] holds true oh Hallelujah there's
[2:10:23] knowledge in here there's wisdom in here
[2:10:25] there's power in here oh there's key to
[2:10:29] God's presence in here there's keys to
[2:10:32] leadership he's the guidance keys to
[2:10:35] your life he's the how to deal with your
[2:10:39] husband how to deal with your wife how
[2:10:41] to deal with your family how to deal
[2:10:43] with your Affairs if we could only
[2:10:46] pick up the words in this book I think
[2:10:48] God is looking for people this morning
[2:10:50] who are inspired enough to pick up these
[2:10:54] ancient words ever true
[2:11:03] it did something for Joshua it'll do
[2:11:06] something for you this morning it did
[2:11:08] something for Paul he changed his name
[2:11:10] and puts all the poor God changed it all
[2:11:14] because of the words in this book oh
[2:11:16] because of the words of this life oh I
[2:11:19] did something for Peter it'll do
[2:11:21] something for you this morning oh he did
[2:11:23] something for the future of the ages oh
[2:11:26] Hallelujah
[2:11:28] [Music]
[2:11:29] we can pick these same words up
[2:11:32] these are not the words of a man
[2:11:34] this was not written with deceit
[2:11:37] this was not written in contempt
[2:11:40] this was not written with the objective
[2:11:41] to destroy or to manipulate this was not
[2:11:44] written to drive fear Into the Heart of
[2:11:46] people it's a driven to build their
[2:11:48] confidence to put a fear of God in them
[2:11:51] that they could begin to grow in God and
[2:11:53] learn God and understand God to put his
[2:11:55] love in them he is Godly fear not the
[2:11:59] fear of man
[2:12:00] fear of God
[2:12:03] hallelujah hallelujah it's written to
[2:12:06] give us guidance and instruction is
[2:12:08] written to give us wisdom and
[2:12:10] understanding and God knew that even in
[2:12:13] this age these words were still hold
[2:12:16] true heaven on Earth will pass away but
[2:12:19] my words will never pass away oh
[2:12:23] hallelujah hallelujah do you believe it
[2:12:26] amen
[2:12:32] amen so let me find out find a way to
[2:12:35] kind of wind down now and so on
[2:12:41] so this whole tyranny thing it's a rule
[2:12:43] of fear
[2:12:44] there's certain things that pop up in
[2:12:46] tyrannical ruler ships or regimes one is
[2:12:48] fear one is manipulation
[2:12:51] where leaders
[2:12:53] manipulate people they pit people
[2:12:55] against each other
[2:12:56] purposefully
[2:12:58] uh with an intention
[2:13:00] most of the times in their head they
[2:13:02] have a secret plan
[2:13:04] but they don't tell you the plan
[2:13:06] they tell you the part that you want to
[2:13:08] hear
[2:13:09] so that you can buy into the plan
[2:13:11] and then when they hook you it's already
[2:13:14] too late
[2:13:15] and you've joined the regime
[2:13:18] and a lot of things are happening that
[2:13:19] audio control
[2:13:22] look damage has already been done
[2:13:26] four Shepherds is that right who feed
[2:13:29] not the flock
[2:13:30] the desire is truly to feed themselves
[2:13:32] they might get the flock some
[2:13:34] make it look like this is all that there
[2:13:36] was but behind that is 90 percent
[2:13:39] they only give you 10.
[2:13:41] I said this is all their worries
[2:13:43] so while they say so I think I was uh uh
[2:13:46] Kim Kim Jong-il who's the son of Kim
[2:13:49] il-sung leader of North Korea who is the
[2:13:52] Eternal president mind you
[2:13:55] he's there a long time ago and they
[2:13:57] actually have this two-day ceremony in
[2:13:59] North Korea where everyone from all
[2:14:00] across the country coming to Pyongyang
[2:14:02] capital
[2:14:03] and they worship before him
[2:14:06] this eternal president
[2:14:07] they bring flowers we don't know about
[2:14:09] that because we live in a free country
[2:14:12] please praise the Lord but if you were
[2:14:14] born in North Korea you would know it is
[2:14:16] a day and a calendar or two days on a
[2:14:17] calendar where they come from all around
[2:14:19] the region round about to pay homage to
[2:14:22] this eternal president
[2:14:23] Kim il-sung who died how much of a years
[2:14:26] ago and they bring flowers and they have
[2:14:28] to bow and sit with me if you're bowing
[2:14:29] they all have to bow together
[2:14:31] if you don't do it end up in jail
[2:14:33] like is that serious
[2:14:35] and they put on wood between your legs
[2:14:37] like this and then they sit down on it
[2:14:40] the poppy knee capsule
[2:14:43] foreign
[2:14:51] going on it was really bad I think in
[2:14:54] the 90s or something like that and um
[2:14:55] you know he was going around the Village
[2:14:57] from places to places and he was
[2:14:59] visiting people and so forth this is how
[2:15:01] histories tells us and he was telling
[2:15:03] the people that you know he was in this
[2:15:04] long march and he was along this long
[2:15:06] journey and uh he was only eating from a
[2:15:09] sump of water and a handful of rice and
[2:15:12] he was coming to every village
[2:15:13] everywhere you know when he was visiting
[2:15:15] him telling them oh he'd use their
[2:15:16] troubles and he knows their sorrows and
[2:15:18] we're gonna fix everything and make it
[2:15:19] better
[2:15:20] history reports that he was one of the
[2:15:23] biggest buyers of Hennessy
[2:15:26] and lobster
[2:15:28] and find food a matter of fact they sent
[2:15:31] somebody to Italy to learn how to make
[2:15:33] pizza come back to make pizza for Kim
[2:15:36] Jong-un
[2:15:40] that's how crazy they get with power all
[2:15:42] right so just give an example here
[2:15:45] and here it is in the Bible God it gives
[2:15:47] them an account tells them this is what
[2:15:48] the king will do when he comes and they
[2:15:50] still wanted it because they didn't want
[2:15:52] God's benevolence
[2:15:54] didn't want God's grace they didn't
[2:15:56] appreciate
[2:15:57] God's favor they didn't understand it
[2:16:00] they didn't think things could get bad
[2:16:06] did
[2:16:07] and God allowed it to happen God said
[2:16:11] you choose our King then you will live
[2:16:13] with him until I'm ready to give you the
[2:16:16] king I wanted to give you
[2:16:18] all time but because you choose your own
[2:16:21] way
[2:16:22] you want your own stuff you want to
[2:16:24] learn your own lessons all right
[2:16:27] be okay
[2:16:28] you start off good Samuel anointed
[2:16:31] and so forth and everything looked like
[2:16:33] it was predestinated
[2:16:35] you start off good oh you deadly man
[2:16:38] it's great among the people it's tall
[2:16:40] handsome looking
[2:16:42] he was a nice looking fella he was not
[2:16:44] it wasn't terrible you know a nice guy
[2:16:46] nice behavior and so forth start off
[2:16:48] right see but over time
[2:16:51] his choices showed him up over time
[2:16:55] little things started to pop up until it
[2:16:58] come to the act of Disobedience where
[2:17:00] Samuel had to confront him on it and say
[2:17:02] that obedience
[2:17:03] president sacrifice I don't want the
[2:17:06] sacrifice I want your opinions do what I
[2:17:08] told you to do oh Hallelujah because of
[2:17:11] this you're fired
[2:17:14] thank you
[2:17:15] Samuel had to read out the riot back to
[2:17:17] him yes you know and um
[2:17:20] and anything there see then God spoke to
[2:17:23] Samia I told him go down to the house of
[2:17:25] Jesse Hallelujah and anoint one of my
[2:17:27] own to be king never told him who it was
[2:17:30] so I said you go down there
[2:17:32] and I'll give you a witness
[2:17:34] I'll tell you who it was now that's
[2:17:36] interesting because the day before when
[2:17:39] he went met anointed Saul
[2:17:42] um he God spoke to his Heir and told him
[2:17:44] who it was going to be so when Saul
[2:17:46] showed up he was like what's going on

[2:26:04] ah God came to empower said that we
[2:26:06] could live and reflect God's leading
[2:26:07] isn't that right
[2:26:08] so that we may point the people to
[2:26:10] Christ
[2:26:11] that's the objective that's a rule and
[2:26:13] function of the true Shepherds
[2:26:15] there's a point the people to Jesus
[2:26:18] Christ
[2:26:19] not to themselves not to their own
[2:26:21] agendas not their own opinions in order
[2:26:24] to do that the man has to die and be
[2:26:26] dead
[2:26:27] dead too everything else
[2:26:29] but to what God wants and to what God
[2:26:32] desires I thank God this morning that we
[2:26:35] have I think we have great leaders Among
[2:26:37] Us in our church here
[2:26:38] and I certainly appreciate them
[2:26:43] Ministries
[2:26:49] put their shoulder to the wheel
[2:26:52] because we believe in something
[2:26:54] and we believe it together
[2:26:55] we're Believing on the Lord Jesus
[2:26:58] not church when she comes into our
[2:27:00] persecution they are Believing on the
[2:27:01] Lord Jesus the same holy spirit that was
[2:27:04] with them in the day of Pentecost he's
[2:27:06] the same Holy Spirit today that does the
[2:27:08] same things that if you believe on him
[2:27:11] and if you put your trust in his name
[2:27:12] that same Holy Spirit if you do the
[2:27:14] things that they did back there he'll
[2:27:16] give you the same Penny he'll give you
[2:27:18] the same prize he'll give you the same
[2:27:20] reward the same baptism same Holy Spirit
[2:27:23] one Lord One Faith because they are one
[2:27:27] sheep one sheep poor they will have one
[2:27:29] Shepherd one Lord one God one father who
[2:27:33] is a purpose or an in you all and
[2:27:36] through you all will fulfill all things
[2:27:39] according to his riches and mercy man
[2:27:43] Matthew 4 says from that time Jesus
[2:27:45] began to preach and say repent for the
[2:27:47] Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and Jesus
[2:27:48] walking by the Sea of Galilee saw two
[2:27:50] Brethren Simon Peter and Andrew brother
[2:27:52] casting anything to the Sea for they
[2:27:54] were fishes and he said unto them follow
[2:27:55] me and I will make you Fishers of Men
[2:27:59] this is what God wants from us amen just
[2:28:02] a few scriptures just want to highlight
[2:28:04] God's desire for us he always kept
[2:28:07] echoing it and mentioning it in small
[2:28:08] ways to his disciples and they didn't
[2:28:10] understand it of course he knew he
[2:28:11] didn't understand it but he had to speak
[2:28:13] it over there so that when he come back
[2:28:16] and there's a in his ministry when he's
[2:28:19] raised with then he come back in
[2:28:20] Resurrection Ministry he echoed back to
[2:28:22] them the same things that he told them
[2:28:23] while he was yet with them in Galilee
[2:28:25] and Samaria and Jerusalem support isn't
[2:28:27] that right so that they became more real
[2:28:29] to them after they've gone through the
[2:28:31] crucifician experience watched him die
[2:28:34] watch him scream watch the Quran and
[2:28:36] give up the ghosts watch the sun black
[2:28:38] out watch the the temple run into watch
[2:28:41] the Earth shake oh praise God and the
[2:28:43] Holy and the Saints came up and appeared
[2:28:45] to many after all of that took place and
[2:28:47] they went hiding for about three days
[2:28:48] until he reappeared to them now these
[2:28:51] would became more real to them then but
[2:28:54] he was always telling them these things
[2:28:56] isn't that right and here it was this
[2:28:58] was after this ministry now this is
[2:28:59] after the resurrection he'll come back
[2:29:00] now uh Saint John 20.
[2:29:03] um
[2:29:04] and he said Jesus said to them peace be
[2:29:06] unto you as my father sent me even so
[2:29:08] send out you and when he had said this
[2:29:11] he breathed on them and he said unto
[2:29:13] them receive ye the Holy Ghost so I love
[2:29:17] it because he pronounces Holy Ghost upon
[2:29:19] him almost as a confirmation of what he
[2:29:22] has said before that as his father had
[2:29:24] sent him
[2:29:25] not the Holy Ghost is coming to empower
[2:29:28] you as sons of the Kingdom as Daughters
[2:29:31] of the Kingdom to be sent out as a
[2:29:33] witness that Jesus is Alive that he is
[2:29:36] the same yesterday today and forever he
[2:29:39] said receiving the Holy Ghost In other
[2:29:42] words the Holy Ghost will take care of
[2:29:44] this word even so send are you receive
[2:29:47] it a holy ghost receive ye power oh
[2:29:50] hallelu to form me into the word image
[2:29:52] so that you can be sent
[2:29:54] to do God's work
[2:29:55] he said whoever sends you remit you're
[2:29:57] remitted unto them and whosoever sins
[2:29:59] you retain our routine wow
[2:30:02] that's amazing they come into such a in
[2:30:04] other words they're going to come into
[2:30:05] such a level of the Christian work that
[2:30:08] they are gonna actually remit sins and
[2:30:10] retain it's not right he Echoes these
[2:30:12] things Luke 22 lord said to Simon Simon
[2:30:16] behold this is after you rebuke Simon
[2:30:18] totally get it behind me
[2:30:22] that he may sift you as wheat but I've
[2:30:25] prayed for thee amen that I Faith failed
[2:30:27] not what should he says here and he says
[2:30:29] and when thou art converted

[2:30:34] work to do amen and don't stop at the
[2:30:36] Holy Ghost oh it starts with the Holy

[2:31:07] charity friends charity never feel it
[2:31:10] the love of God that takes away the sins
[2:31:13] of the world he wants to pour that love
[2:31:15] into you
[2:31:16] so that you could love not only the ones
[2:31:19] that closer to you but you could love
[2:31:21] the unlovable

[2:31:33] time that Jesus showed himself to the
[2:31:35] disciples after that he was risen from

[2:32:45] love thee Jesus said unto him feed my
[2:32:48] sheep three times
[2:32:53] hmm God is very concerned this morning
[2:32:56] about his sheep
[2:32:58] and he wants he wants his men who are
[2:33:01] fit the prophet said God called man
[2:33:04] were trained in the Supernatural
[2:33:06] to handle God's word
[2:33:09] this bride will not be manhandled
[2:33:12] she has to be card handled and it takes
[2:33:15] god-called man to do that
[2:33:17] we're not here to
[2:33:19] fix anybody
[2:33:20] we just said to present a word to you
[2:33:23] and then the word does the job and in
[2:33:25] the world fixes the problems
[2:33:28] but Prophet said the word corrects the
[2:33:29] church
[2:33:30] hey amen amen is that right glory to God

[2:33:42] he will fix a broken heart he will bind
[2:33:44] it up their wounds he tell it the number
[2:33:46] of stars
[2:33:47] call it them by their names he knows
[2:33:49] your name this morning
[2:33:51] he knows who you are he knows your
[2:33:53] journey in life
[2:33:54] your journey may not be brother so until
[2:33:56] his journey
[2:33:57] your journey may not be success Journey
[2:34:00] your journey is your own Journey
[2:34:02] and your journey was meant to shape you
[2:34:05] a certain way
[2:34:07] to create a certain result
[2:34:09] Jesus got many trainings and on
[2:34:12] obedience he learned obedience and the
[2:34:14] things that he suffered the Bible said
[2:34:15] it took obedience to go on the cross it
[2:34:18] took obedience to pay the price his
[2:34:21] training was was tantamount to the to
[2:34:23] the thing that he had to face in the end
[2:34:26] he had to see
[2:34:28] not my Willow
[2:34:30] that will be done you have to come to
[2:34:31] that point his training was to prepare
[2:34:33] him for this and as an example son he
[2:34:36] did it though it was hard though it was
[2:34:38] painful and the Bible shows that it was
[2:34:40] sweat was as drops of blood he was
[2:34:43] intense he was filming in his prayer
[2:34:45] because he knew that he faced death
[2:34:46] itself
[2:34:47] but yet he said not my will
[2:34:50] but I will be done
[2:34:51] Young Brother young sister doesn't
[2:34:53] matter what you have to face as long as
[2:34:55] you face it with God you come out on the
[2:34:58] other side but make sure you face it
[2:35:01] with God don't face it alone you're not
[2:35:03] big enough for that you're not great
[2:35:05] enough for that you're not strong enough
[2:35:07] for that but oh Jesus if you would just
[2:35:10] hold my hand I know I'll be all right
[2:35:12] and I'll be okay oh hallelujah
[2:35:15] hallelujah hallelujah precious Lord
[2:35:19] and
[2:35:21] me on Lord let me stand oh Hallelujah if

[2:35:33] time is
[2:35:34] far gone but uh I just want to finish up
[2:35:37] with a few things maybe musicians can
[2:35:38] get ready to start coming on uh very
[2:35:40] very listen to you when I was young how
[2:35:42] good is myself you tell Peter he said
[2:35:43] here walk us with her now with us but
[2:35:46] when thou shall be old thou shall
[2:35:47] stretch for thy hands on another shout
[2:35:49] gritty and carry thee without witness
[2:35:51] not
[2:35:52] amen and amen Matthew 20 Jesus calls to
[2:35:56] them and said you know the princess of
[2:35:57] the Gentiles exercise dominion over them
[2:35:58] now they are great exercise great
[2:36:01] Authority upon them so forth they that
[2:36:03] are great exercise great Authority
[2:36:05] he said but it shall not be so among you
[2:36:08] but whosoever will be great among you
[2:36:10] let him be your minister and whoever
[2:36:13] will be Chief among you let him be your
[2:36:16] servant
[2:36:17] God taught servanthood
[2:36:19] he did this over to him he washed their
[2:36:22] feet
[2:36:22] dried over the towel he presented
[2:36:24] himself as a flunky to them and he told
[2:36:26] him didn't you know what I have done for
[2:36:28] you he said a servant is no greater than
[2:36:30] his Lord if I have washed your feet then
[2:36:32] I expect the same of you that you wash
[2:36:35] one another's feet and therefore will
[2:36:37] you be my disciples when you have love
[2:36:40] one for another and if you want to love
[2:36:42] God love his children treat his children
[2:36:45] right in whatever context it doesn't
[2:36:48] matter wherever you go wherever you do
[2:36:50] whatever you say be the right kind of a
[2:36:53] son
[2:36:54] whether you're in church or whether
[2:36:56] you're standing in a trench
[2:36:58] with boots on and a shovel
[2:37:00] still be a Christian even if you're
[2:37:02] wearing the finest of clothing even if
[2:37:04] you're standing on a podium
[2:37:06] speaking of thousands of people be a
[2:37:08] Christian there be a Christian in the
[2:37:10] boardroom be a Christian in a staff room
[2:37:12] be a Christian in the garage be a
[2:37:15] Christian outside wherever wherever
[2:37:19] follow where he leads you
[2:37:21] and in that way you can lead others to
[2:37:23] Christ isn't that right okay wow even
[2:37:27] the son of man came not to be ministered
[2:37:28] but a minister and to give his life for
[2:37:31] many all right read a quick quote here
[2:37:33] from God called man we know this and he
[2:37:34] said I saw tonight I want to think on
[2:37:35] that remember that in the midst of all
[2:37:36] this cry God cannot
[2:37:39] until he's got men in sheep
[2:37:42] we cannot have a Revival until we get
[2:37:44] men God call man God trained men
[2:37:48] that's not trained up in the schools of
[2:37:50] Theology and education but rugged men
[2:37:53] faith that God has brought up in the
[2:37:55] school of his rugged training
[2:37:58] not just training but rugged training
[2:38:01] character building amen isn't that right
[2:38:03] men who are not afraid to face the fire
[2:38:06] man was coming the presence of God knows
[2:38:10] his power and knows his omnipotence and
[2:38:13] knows his healing power some men that's
[2:38:16] trained to know the Living God it's all
[2:38:19] right to train them by the word but let
[2:38:21] them kill it the spirit given life he
[2:38:24] said and before we can have this revival
[2:38:25] God has a call out and trained man oh
[2:38:27] that's what we're doing this morning
[2:38:29] we're being trained train for a great
[2:38:31] job
[2:38:32] we have to do it's very important amen
[2:38:34] God trained man to carry this message
[2:38:36] remember God's burden he says feed my
[2:38:38] sheep feed my Lambs they carry this
[2:38:40] message and they don't care what the
[2:38:42] opposition is they're willing to go to
[2:38:45] the fiery furnace and defeat or to the
[2:38:47] Lions then or wherever it may be they're
[2:38:49] ready to go because they've been in the
[2:38:51] presence of God
[2:38:52] and they know that he is whether it's
[2:38:55] the victory or defeat they still stand
[2:38:57] the same that's the kind of training
[2:38:59] that God does the man and it's very
[2:39:02] strange to think that God would do that
[2:39:03] that God trains his men like that the
[2:39:06] prophet said but he does you know we
[2:39:08] have an old song We Sing
[2:39:10] some through the waters some through the
[2:39:13] floods some through deep trials but all
[2:39:17] through the blood
[2:39:20] God leads his people through great
[2:39:23] trials to purge them oh I don't want God
[2:39:26] to purge me this morning and sometimes
[2:39:29] he says it takes years to do it
[2:39:33] it's not an overnight job
[2:39:35] Perfection takes time
[2:39:38] and as for myself tonight he said I
[2:39:40] believe that right now
[2:39:42] God is training such men
[2:39:44] to meet the front line men who are going
[2:39:47] through and time shook from their feet
[2:39:50] sometimes something I look like the
[2:39:51] whole thing is falling apart but yet in
[2:39:53] the midst of it all they know that
[2:39:55] Living God
[2:39:57] keep their face forward and they keep
[2:39:59] moving on Amen and amen and amen glory
[2:40:03] to God you believe that oh hallelujah
