tonight Oh hallelujah we thank God for his presence tonight he man he is a great I am praise God hallelujah well tonight a man just want to switch over now to the good portion of service tonight and if you have your Bibles you just turn quickly to a few portion of Scripture I have three readings tonight and we want to read from amen amen but the shame if I could get more on the monitors going amen so turning over with me if you would please Genesis chapter 1 and all Genesis chapter 1 and verse 11 a man and also we want to read from Matthew 13 and Matthew 7 first scripture reading tonight Genesis one and reading from verse 11 it says and God said let the earth bring forth grass and the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so and the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after his kind and a tree yielding after his kind cattle and creeping and creeper from 12 and the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit after whose seed was in itself after his kind and God saw that it was good amen please go on now turn it over to Matthew Buca Matthew in chapter 2 tee want to read from verse 24 they and just down to 30 men so Matthew to Tina was 24 which says another parable put he forth unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field but while men slept his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way and when he and when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tares also so the servants and the house holder came and said unto Him sooth is not those are so good seed and I feel from Wednesday and hadatha taters he sent unto them an enemy had done this and a servant said unto Him wilt thou then that we go and gather them up but he's an e-blast while he got him up gather up the tares ye root up also the wheat with them let both grow together until the harvest and in a time of the harvest I will say to the Reapers gather ye together first the tares and bind them it bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my amen and so now machi chapter seven last reading tonight before you take your seats he-man briefly March to chapter 7 and we read a few verses they were also from verse 16 and it says he shall know them by their fruits do men gather grapes or phones of grapes of thorns or figs of thistles even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the final wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them a man they got a blessing - lets just bound hands one more time or have any father Lord we read your will tonight though we pray for a few moments Lord knows we have a share of the wood tonight as we talk on the word father we lord I pray tonight at your blesses little thought I have upon my heart Lord that you've given me to speak to your people tonight Lord for a few moments Lord before we pray Lord me anointed lon yes / come upon it father may speak lip tear tear people tonight Lord take me out of the way Lord you know what you once said you know what you want done tonight so Lord we give ourselves over to you now for service long as willing servants tonight Lord as willing Labor's for your harvest tonight we pray that you are anointing and we come down upon your wood and blessed blessed their hearts

name we ask amen and amen praise God you may have his seats tonight may God richly bless you tonight man thank you amen hallelujah well pre is gone Amen the soldiers so the soldiers are here tonight event rain is pouring outside and you know where the conditions right now but we don't want to thank you for coming out tonight amen and amen God is here among us a man to do what he said he would do priests gone a man just for a few moments we just talk on the wood tonight just be a little while before we get into our time of prayer tonight and just go to calling on God prophet said if the people go to call in on God there'll be a national showdown a man where the twos entry's I got it there he is an immense amen amen and in time it can happen Godwin it to break forth upon his people he many many time you get into that channel and praise God and shut everything else on the outside and get alone with God just like cheek I've got alone with God to wrassle all night a man priests gone until the breaking of the day amen hallelujah he had a personal conviction there's something he needed to do tonight and it's something we need to do tonight in order to break into the supernatural Bri is going in order to break into the spiritual realm hallelujah we've got to get into that channel we got to line up with the word of God the line up with God's purpose the line up with God's program is now Ryan harlequin line up with God's intention and what he wants of us tonight hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah is now right to catch the mind of God for heart hearts to be in tune with the Word of God and to know what he wants done I like what he once done with his word in this our praise corny man Moses had a word for his day Noah harder wood for their day and we have a wood for our days now we have to live this perfection word that the Prophet fought to bring to produce is now halle-loo that the Prophet labor to sew those seeds in there praise God we believe by faith tonight and we're coming at a time of harvest a time of reap in a holiday - when tears shall reap enjoying a Merry Men hallelujah oh my god promises him one man saw another man water but quad will get the increase its car that gives the increase it caught it gives of fruit are we looking for fruit to comfort in this season Galatians 5 love joy peace longsuffering gentleness hallelujah it'll come out of this genuine seed of God a man it'll produce more of itself a man it's not right so for title I have tonight is every seed after its own kind amen every seed after its own kind praise gone whenever we come out to the convention just a little while ago and what an inspiration it was a man and the minister's that spoken we're still chewing and undercut of it amen praise God but it's it's been a real blessing and I think there's a lot of testimonies both local and abroad and people might be blessed by the services amen so a man we saw I'm just kind of gleaning on it tonight a little bit a man is so much can be said about it but praise God I was really inspired by it all you know when our God really spoke to my heart and I was sitting there listening to brother whose service who is preaching he's talking about a story of us a man really inspired message and while he was sitting there while I was sitting there he was speaking and something spoke to my heart and said is Allah is the labourer a preacher was just a question you know I said with labor preacher you know just caught me by surprise him and priests gone someone just a question has come to my heart is the labor of the preacher and my heart I said well no it can't be a man please God it's not just for the preachers and it was so something because the evening service brother Eamonn Thompson came up priests Gordon while he was ministering he actually answered a question that was being spoke a man he sees not just for the preacher he said it was for you and for you here man isn't that right praise God is really something supernatural so God was speaking praise going and moving in different ways Amen hallelujah breeze going it's not just for the preacher Amen this third phase thoughtful is not just for the foot of ministry but it's for them that overcome to he that overcometh will I keep the minister three of the Morningstar hallelujah to him that overcometh I'll keep the Holy Ghost to him not over comments I'll give you your portion your inheritance to him that can go all the way go all the way from hate to charity all the way up the pyramid their praise gone get all the way up to the top praise gone it takes God to please you up in there isn't that right one time I think a brother brother had a vision or dream or either brother branham and he was seen brother pronto up in a pyramid put about him how did you get up there you man isn't all right but I never spoke fathom say the teks gone to place you up in there praise God takes call to take you up that pyramid many start any man but they fall off along the way because it gets narrower as it gets to the top prays gone don't kind of walk up there but the pure in heart it's a highway to heaven a man Oh many are call friends but few are chosen to walk in Christ bloody footprints few are chosen to walk this narrow way straight is the gate narrow is a way tonight and few there be that find it or whether we're the chosen ones to nine Oh hallelujah bout luck praise God is about predestination it's about election hallelujah he's already glorified already justifying Amen it makes you feel good tonight to know that you are one in a million Oh hallelujah millions were lost when we were saved when we were down at the altar when we were crying and seeing a blood of God portion of our souls millions were lost about single moments when you recognize him when you recognize deity in your life Oh holla when you were called to this glorious gospel oh he said you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you to bring forth fruit oh you're gonna bring forth fruit in your harvest time cease oh the harvest time harvest season is here now back to the Bible back to the word back to the original it's back to what the original church that was lead our penny costs it went into the ground and went to processes ojala but quad promised to restore that church again God promised you'd bring it back to original fruit again God promised you'd bring miracles that can heal policy bring back healing signs wonders missing limbs be restored think it not strange God is able to do it again if he did it in the prophets he is about to do it in you tonight court is not finished he's just about to get started the angel in the prophet said I'll ride this trail one more time that is not by chance that is not there is a bride earlier tonight who under her messenger would be the final voice to the final final junction of time when the devil thinks he's got everything on the edge look up your attention to a nine the mighty hand of God will bring a pure bride out of a satanic world would be a paradox but it'll be incredible it was on its way tonight hallelujah get a lot of shut up ray Oh blowing angel said behold I come quickly a man I was thinking in my heart while I was washing the dishes one time I said it's a short quick work it's a short quick work amen amen holidays all right so my god take a man out and call call man you saw it properly talk about it call him an out for about 30 years a man just give him a short space of a ministry isn't that right trying in the desert yes he's there oh a man out there - Oh hallelujah just caught trying him and pulling out only all the dross out of him taking out all his stuff out of him what just four short ministry prays got to shake your hallelujah hallelujah Amen is now right the Prophet said if we could get get our hearts in tune get that certain thing fixed in another five minutes there won't be a feeble person in omits there won't be one person in sign the Holy Spirit but what would receive it if we could get it fixed in five minutes it'll all be over hallelujah a short quick work and the Prophet said I don't know it let not he said I'm only I'm only building holiday hours close at hand where you're gonna see something with all this background all this preaching all the lives years of wood all these years are coming to church hallelujah I'm going back home but it'd be a short quick message the whole nation Oh Oh God give a message and that message to eat a seal you in or it'll seal you out I saw thank God tonight's that God planted some seeds from before the foundation of the world what would receive him God knew you would receive him in 2019 he knew it hallelujah he put it in sorry you praise God my listen it's just coming now the earth rolling around a man in Boyd and darkness and God a man caught he created heaven in the earth there was no light yet isn't that right nothing was formed everything was in chaos yet notice if we go down to Genesis God never said let there be seed when the earth was created the seed was laying in me he just spoke to the law that was in the sea Genesis 111 and he said let every see bring for after his kind but his seed was always lean and there the earth always had the potential to bring forth fruits and herb and he see healing fruit and tree and everything it was all inside of him so what are we seeing tonight when God have made us in his mind he already put inside of us what it was supposed to come out Oh [Applause] you don't hear me tonight when courts poke you in the beginning when he saw you in his mind he already predestinated he put the seeds inside of you in there in itself already in itself the word in you is a believer oh it's a wooden you that made you come to this church tonight it's so good and you remain you shout it's so good and you that makes you lift your hands even honey don't feel like it Oh hallelujah well I see caught the wooden you cries house I know my limits Oh glory glory glory glory yeah he put up faith in you to receive his promised word amen amen hallelujah it wasn't Abraham it was a feat that was in Abraham that was always being tried that was always being tested for 25 years on believin isn't that right you're gonna have a son you're gonna have a son where did that come from from flesh no flesh and blood didn't reveal it it's now right we know the story Jesus took his disciples out and say who do men say I am some say this they didn't know see it were caught walk with Him two about three and a half years didn't know who he was praise God they were just following a man praise God he was doing great signs and wonders sure he was saying things to them that was a green in their heart but he didn't have a revelation of who that man was they were standing there praise God they were believing the stories of others they were believin on the testimonies of others brother song who said this brother so-and-so said that's a man isn't that right but it didn't have their own personal vindication of who that man there was really a man But Here Come pizza now and he stood up amongst them and he said how are Christ full of the Living God anyway he said that flesh and blood really show that to you because these guys didn't know nobody whispered it to you so then what did it it was my father in heaven letter revealing to you who I am praise God and that's what the church will be built upon this revelation of who Jesus Christ is this revelation in other words it's gonna comfort a bride and this last thing she's gonna walk not by the testimonies of others but by a personal revelation she knows who she is she knows who spoke to her she knows her word for her season she knows her word for oh hallelujah no man call her she knows no man is able to please say in that party she's got to go in there by one spirit she's baptized into that party one feet one Lord one baptism the true pride the true church hallelujah we'll come for Thalia by the true spirit true anointing upon the true seed of God bring in sons of God back in again a man in a last day that's what God promised hallelujah a man so we walk by he tonight I'm not by sight not by feelings it has nothing to do it feelings this seed we're talking about is not feelings it is not intelligent election but you are yet to lay in the presence of the Sun and to get paid couch and to get the greenest paint out of you let a supernatural son comes upon your heart and burns out the human flesh burns out the loss not all that you are all that you think you're gonna pee Pernell ouch Oh Harley are rotten Italian and what's taking place the seed inside of you the beginning to take on life the seed inside of you is finally opportunity to bring 1490 man to put you Jesus Christ because that's the purpose of the seed anyway is that right every seed after its kind so you see God's poopy earth and he knew what was laying in it so Genesis one coming all the way up to ten quarters only making a way for the sea to come forth because he had to separate a waters from another land there was water everywhere so he separated waters from the mountain he made a speech for the land he made a space for the mountain The Book of Proverbs head he gave his City decree that it would not pass from hence and so forth and God are setting everything up lights enough of the heavens and so on what was God doing called us getting ready for the sea to comfort and all these years God has been moving things around in your life in your home in your family in your community what was he doing he was getting ready for that seed in you to come forth and stop with juice and Jesus Christ on the earth one more time Oh Holly yet a little while and the world will see me no more but Jesus said you shall see me and because I live you shall live also Oh sprays gone the woods gonna look around and not gonna see any sad hallelujah of the Messiah except in the Brian topless everywhere but God promising that bride Oh Hollis she'll have the mind of Christ she'll have the intelligence to know what to do with that word she'll have to see the Lord or she'll keep still she'll have the right spirit all right attitude she'll be flesh of his flesh bone of his bone spirit of his spirit Oh Hollis you have forgiveness she love pearly kindness she'll have genuine love just like the Prophet had when he spoke to the bull not love that charity spirits is promised to come upon you my Christian brother it's promised to come upon you my Christian sister hold on your change is going to come oh not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of Hosts Oh this monkey shall be removes oh we'll rebuild his church again in the power of his spirit spirit spirit spirit oh he rebuild individual you pop the individual with charity and she be seal away prease going hallelujah and that's the whole thing amen amen breeze going hallelujah do you believe it tonight every seat after its kind and so now here I just want to touch on here the book I've seen Matthew it's not right hallelujah I now watch an enemy had done this thing remember the power bill here he talked about but Jesus said that you know the husband man went forth so scenes and then here come the enemy night so tears it's not right in those in the field isn't all right and we see down in Genesis where God establishes man in the beginning isn't that right Adam and Eve were then called with his family a man holiday and they had a prophecy now they were supposed to MultiPlan replenish he's now right and they were there just waiting on their word it's not right to come to show them how these things would be all right wasn't supposed to come my intellect like what did the serpent did he used reasoning and he deceived Eve a man is now right please go over the prophet said if that didn't happen we're a comfort by the spoken word it's now all right praise God we wouldn't have known sin and I've always fallen condition and things demonize now right remember God had it to be that way so that we could understand the grace of God it's now right hallelujah knows going through Genesis just recently and down in Genesis there when you look at the beginning it comes up and he says go on pre to the heavens God created the earth God created the lights isn't that right but when it start to come into talking about man and the generations of man and the generations are gone had spoken into the existence it turns from gone into the Lord God isn't arrived his title suddenly changed all the time he was God the creature but now he became the Lord God meaning he had subjects meaning he had sons he had a family hallelujah his title now change from just being God alone to be in the Lord caught caught with his family that's what he wanted all the time he wanted to beat you over holily is now right and now we see when a serpent come in and sin come into the picture God could now become so many more things he moved for me in the Lord God to being God the Savior to being God the Redeemer to being caught a restorer to being caught the Potter to being called a Baptizer to be in court the lights the pillar of fire the holy one the wheel in the middle of louie the rock we need to rock hallelujah he could be all these things to you oh because you have known in front beginning Oh hallelujah because we bypass our theophany and drop down into the time here to be tested and to be proven even isn't that right the Prophet said why would God do that hallelujah praise God he wanted to prove a bride a man and she was not like Eve and she would not be deceived and she would not take the devil's lie so in order to do that what he did you he put a seat in there and then sent you out as a mystery hallelujah out into the world out into your workplace out into your family some of you look a little different from somebody else that's okay we all have the same father we all have the same God we all serve the same Lord and his name is Jesus already on the same God I brought you out the same gonna take you through all through different journeys but there's one destination oh how are we're going to get to heaven we're going to that resurrection hallelujah nothing can stop that pride she'll be closing linen she'll be clothed in white hallelujah which is a righteousness of the saints Oh hallelujah and I shall wave and cry holy holy I'll sing a new song unto the Lord isn't that right Oh yeah Johnson look at saw these out of Maine many nations many people are many tongues with branches in their hands singing Hosanna Hosanna Oh singing praises unto a god we don't belong on this hurts we belong in heaven you come from God you going back to God we just passing through here Oh mystery hallelujah of what the book is is what is lean inside of you tonight mysterious preach unless something inside of you that recognizes that mystery oh it's Christ in you the mystery of quality about tonight there's something to give Him glory about tonight where was you and I laid a foundation of the urge when the morning stars sang together i when the sons of God shouted for joy brother sister you were there in God's mind God put a seed in your soul and see hallelujah knows no defeats that she knows no surrender Oh Cedars like the lily she is present pass the darkness present pass a mile she's gonna get the Holy Ghost she's gotta be filled she's gotta meet her maker nothing can stop her no sin no death no height no tap hallelujah she knows nothing can ever separate her from the love of God come on bride hallelujah you can make it tonight there is a man in here I could turn on a light in your heart and in your soul and give you a baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire that make you walk in Jesus name and activate the seed that is in your soul hallelujah [Music] [Music] [Music] little shake shake shake everything that can be shaken will be shaken and the only thing that will not be shaken it's the wood of corn have another pass away my words shall never pass away I promise the world was framed by the Word of God that's why the Bible says no weapon formed against me will prosper no man may think no intention of man no evil thoughts against you and your life and your family will ever strand if God has something to do about it if God predestinated you the work of the enemy is finished tonight in your life hallelujah Oh same as Ramallah if God has Selena to it tonight if God has hand in your life there's no work of the enemy there's nothing that he could cross there's nothing and he can build no there's no new super power that the enemy can build no like a never substantiate to the power of the word of God that is already hallelujah Oh brother God put his weight inside of you absolute holiday is nice I know Holy Ghost is only to come upon that seed I make that she lives I make that she produce itself Oh holiday it is nice it's nice the true keep there he's a seed inside because the Holy Ghost just a temporal gift but if you fall upon your flesh it won't do any good but if it ever connects to that seed Oh dead shot a man praise God their life will spring out of it oh it cannot be too late for the devil already caught in there oh I want lights gets in there a process we can it takes place a chain of events begin to take place that the devil cannot stop oh he could look at it he could watch ahead of it but he can't do nothing about it praise caught holler because it's already finished it's a finished work it's not right honey there's a law inside that see speaking about it in the convention it's not right there's a law in that seat there's a law for everything upon the heaven upon the earth there's no right and there's a law here now upon the see that life's supposed to come out of it is not right it's not right a law of life and once the conditions are right hallelujah then that seed hallelujah there's a process that starts to kick in hallelujah all of a sudden isn't that right it's like conception is now right once the gene meets the egg it starts a process has it spoken what cannot be undone oh it goes on it goes on it goes on hallelujah oh I went God spoke you and he exist we'd begin the beginning before the beginning is not right he already conceived you in his mind wrote your name in blood sealed it away under the Seventh Seal hallelujah praise God he knew he would come back holidays Christ the Redeemer and restore ha I'm talking the seals and reveal your name that was hidden under there he's not now calling you he has already called you he is not now glorifying you you were already glorified he is not now gonna give you the Holy Ghost but before the foundation of the world God swore by himself now he was gonna save you and he was gonna redeem you that he was gonna give you to practice about the Holy Ghost that decision is already made in Cosmo oh you don't hear me tonight you don't hear me tonight the devil is finished before he even got started hallelujah hallelujah whoa we are fighting a defeated enemy tonight the victory is won the battle is over it's already done praise God I have overcome you have already overcome tonight why what does that mean it's gonna be sons and daughters of God they're gonna walk the earth they are going to be living dynamo swelling places for God gotta

quickening and teller giving it life making it live making you Walker sitting away talk a certain way oh and that's what we come for tonight that's what we want to dance oh that's what you need tonight what the church needs it's an outpouring of the Holy Spirit's shun sin killing outpouring of the Holy Ghost with a holy fire of card oh there were try seats in the upper room they were up there they had their pine bottles of course they had their struggles they had their trials just like you do Peter James and John they were human just like you and I but one thing they were convinced of they did see Jesus resurrected Alleluia came and spoke back to them and open their understanding to the scriptures that they might understand the things that were written about him and who he was and what he came to do and Jesus pre de pon them receiving a Holy Ghost sorry in the city of Jerusalem Konya Peru wait for me there and I will into you you know you don't have to do nothing you open an understanding and now they knew who they were and they knew that they had to wait for the power hallelujah in order for these signs to follow them hallelujah have to wait for the power to come down because they couldn't do it in themselves they know they couldn't heal the sick they know they couldn't raise the dead cast out devils or do any of these things that Jesus said they would go into all
