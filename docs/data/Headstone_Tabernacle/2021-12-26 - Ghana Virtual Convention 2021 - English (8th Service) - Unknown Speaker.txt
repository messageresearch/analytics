praise the name of god well praise god let's just have a seat one more time amen we want to ask praise god at this time one of our ministering brethren for overseas to greet the convention so as he comes may god bless you amen go bless his heart as he shares with us today amen praise the name of the lord so it's a privilege and an honor to create brother solomon archina and thank you for the invitation to be part of this wonderful virtual gathering that we have hallelujah the bride is gathered together around the word of god hallelujah in one place in jesus christ amen hallelujah praise the lord and want to greet your wife and the church a local church in ghana and it's your privilege to know you and to be with you together connected this time in this way praise the lord so i want to greet all the ministers that have gathered around this inspiration for these meetings may god bless you i believe he did already and he will continue to bless you and a special greeting to the body of christ around the world amen the body of christ a chosen body hallelujah and you are a part of that body hallelujah and he has called you he has predestinated you to be the body of christ to make up the headstone he has called you for that purpose so just for a short encouragement hallelujah this morning this will encourage me we're going to find out hallelujah that the body of christ is identified in the parables of the five virgins hallelujah the body of christ will be identified hallelujah praise the lord so by god's grace and election we are one of them amen he has chosen us to be one of the wise virgins he has chosen you not to be a foolish virgin but to be part of the wise virgin so in matthew 24 taken from the inspiration the jesus compares the kingdom of god to the 10 virgins which took their lambs and went forced to meet a cry bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were ruled foolish and they that were foolish took their lambs and took no oil with them and verse matthew 25 verse 4 but the wise took oil in their vessel with the lambs and so we find out amen there's a difference between the vice version and the foolish version the foolish virgin they had a lamb by the wise virgin they not only had the lamb but they had a vessel with them and the vessel was filled with oil hallelujah praise the lord so it made a difference between the five wise virgin and the five foolish version amen so the oil praise the lord brother branham says he says the oil is the holy spirit amen that's the oil and the oil needs a specific kind of vessel where it ca a vessel that has the ability to hold that oil amen and that vessel hallelujah will be connected to the lamb amen the foolish virgin didn't had a connection they didn't had a vessel praise the lord by the wise virgin they had a vessel with them and it was connected to the lamb to give a light to their lamb hallelujah and to fool what jesus says in matthew 5 14 ye are the light of the world amen and when you are the light of the world it takes a vessel for that it takes a holy spirit for that to be the light of the world hallelujah and the light is coming from an extra vessel the light is coming forth from a living being from a new life and it's connected to your life amen praise the lord and the message answers questions and answers on hebrews chapter 2. brother branham makes a difference and i want to just bring it out and maybe a blessing to you amen paragraph 363 he says but just trying to make it just a briefly claim as i know how to make it he says when you believe on the lord jesus christ then you have the new birth when you believe on the lord you receive a new thought a new life but it isn't the baptism of the holy ghost you got a new birth when you believe you've got eternal life he that hears my word and believes on him that has sent me has everlasting life he has everlasting life that's the new birth you're converted it means you are turned around so brother branham is starting to make a difference between the new births and to the baptism of the holy spirit hallelujah and he says you have eternal life amen and the ten virgins they had a new birth hallelujah they were turned around they were justified as brother branham said he says they were sanctified but still something was missing and the in matthew we read that's what what's missing was an extra vessel an extra vessel filled with the oil hallelujah praise the lord and brother branham continues and he says but the baptism of the holy spirit puts you into the body of christ and subject to the gifts for service praise the lord so the baptism of the holy ghost hallelujah it puts you in the body of christ amen and the body of christ is a vessel the body of christ is a vessel that is filled with the holy spirit where christ is living in that vessel hallelujah and the baptism of the holy ghost is connecting us to this vessel praise the lord praise the lord in the message face once delivered to the saints brother branham says he says the body of christ is a new creature it's a new creature and it's a new creature a new being it's a living being in your life it's a living new being in your soul hallelujah that's what the body of christ is it turns out to be a new bottle in your life amen for the new wine it's an extra vessel the body of christ amen and the wise virgin they have the extra vessel within them the vessel it contains oil amen as brother branhammy said he says one feeling refillings first of all it puts you in the body of christ and then he fills you and he fills you more and he fills you up in a message patmos vision and it has struck me brother branham he says how thrilling it is to think of those seven lamps drawing life and light from the resources of the main bowel because they had their wicks dipped in it hallelujah each church each church's messenger is the pious depicted here his life is on fire with the holy ghost his wick has been immersed in christ through that week he is drawing the very life of christ and by it it gives the outlie to the church he says and not only can we speak thus of the messenger he says but every true believer is dramatically depicted described here he says they are all drawing from the same source and every true believer every vice virgin is taking their their weakened into this vessel and they're starting to pulling from this vessel they're starting to pulling the life of christ hallelujah they have been dipped in the same boat and the messengers did they are dead to themselves and their lives are hit with christ in god praise the lord now brother branham he brings it down and he says the whisper life what is the visible life it's your outside it's your appearing it's the way you act it's the way people will see you it's the way you you you have your reaction your life it's a visible life and there's an invisible life and brother branham says he says the visible life is burning and is shining and is giving light and manifestations of the holy ghost hallelujah the wise virgin they could manifest the holy ghost the wise virgin they could give out light the wise virgin could show a manifestation of the holy ghost hallelujah let me tell you you're gonna show a manifestation of the holy ghost it will not be in word but he said it's gonna be in spirit and in word hallelujah praise the lord and it's it's visible life and brother branham continues he says but the inner invisible life is hidden in god and fed by the lord's word there's your there's your vessel there's your vessel a true believer a true pride the wise virgin they have an extra vessel hallelujah their weakest into the life of christ and they're pulling from it and they're giving out manifestations of the holy spirit on the outside hallelujah their vessel is connected to the lamb and it's seen in the message the beginning and ending of gentile dispensation brother branham he said what is it the mystery of god what is the mystery of god he says god in you the hope of glory its shining force the baptism of the holy spirit that's the wise virgin it's shining force what you have received on the inside so the baptism of the holy ghost identifies the vessel identifies the body of christ in the believer praise the lord praise the lord so let me encourage you amen to coming to a closure to make it short now watch reihab now rahab she received the messenger that were sent off god to the city of jericho they were called ten they were called two spies to spy out jericho and she received them because she heard a good report amen and we heard a good report of the messenger we heard a good report that jesus christ is back on the scene we heard the report that jesus christ is the same yesterday and today forever we heard a call we heard something going on there's a true pride there's a true believer hallelujah there is a pride that will stand we have heard a call hello and rayham hallelujah she let them go by a robe down down to jericho's wall and they went away but they gave her a promise he said when we come back to the city he said put the rope on the outside so the rope is a visible sign the rope is something that is gonna be seen on the outside so rahab was in expectation but one day one day the pressure was coming judgment was coming to jericho a judgment for destruction was coming to her neighbors a judgment was coming to the mayor a judgement was coming to the sin in the city but rahab she got a promise hallelujah praise the lord and rahab she showed the robe hallelujah and there was a protection with the rope because she has showed it hallelujah so she showed the token hallelujah so what is lamp dreaming time about it lamp trimming time is get ready show the token the pressure is here the time is here to show the token to present the token and to present the light to the world hallelujah and it comes forth by a vessel hallelujah by a holy spirit in the vessel hallelujah and it's gonna be shining through your life it's going to be shining through every every minute and every hour hallelujah praise the lord and it's going to shine out to others hallelujah praise the lord for jericho it meant destruction but for rahab a sign of a wise virgin hallelujah it didn't matter her life it didn't matter what happened in her life but her face was accounted to her for her righteousness hallelujah praise the lord hallelujah and your face hallelujah it brings you to justification it brings you to sanctification and it brings you to your baptism of the holy spirit and then your light can be shown because on the inside there's a holy spirit and you can let it shine on the outside may god bless you on this coming meeting amen may you be ready for the minister to

time but here we are the end of 2021 on the verge of a new day on the verge of a new season on a verge of a new hour father may you bless your people may you bless the reading of the word may you

if there's someone after these services who is still on the edge father lord may this be their day may this be their moment may this be their opportunity to respond to the call of behold a bridegroom comet father may you take complete control in the precious theme of jesus christ and the church says amen and amen i'd like to read my scripture before i go into the greetings so it's a familiar scripture for this convention but uh i want to stay there so see matthew 25 just one portion of scripture thank you musicians thank you brother anthony in matthew 25 and reading from verse one then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins so it's an example it's a likening it's a comparison which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom so in that first verse there's no separation of who makes up that ten is just ten virgins it is only in verse two we begin to separate wise from foolish and i want us to not see it as five wise on one side and five foolish on the other side it was just ten they mixed up five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps so they did something right they took their lambs and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a crime made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all those virgins arose all i want you to watch that word all then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps all and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are going out but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go e rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterward came also the other virgin saying lord lord open to us but he answered and said verily i see unto you i know you not watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh may the lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this evening in the presence of the lord it's certainly a great privilege to be gathered one more time in the presence of the lord and in this virtual convention i'd like to take this opportunity to greet the virtual convention ghana 2021 on behalf of my wife sister karen and my daughter and the local church here at hezbollah tabernacle and my pastor brought ovid special greetings to the host pastor by the solomon nucina his wife sister jane the family the church helps on governments officers there i'd like to greet all the ministers who have supported are connected who will watch and play the tapes special greetings to the ministers who ministered the word i'm identified with these men of god who are yielded to respond to the call at such a time as this greetings as well to the ministers who would have extended their greetings from around the world and the specials and all the singing and the worship certainly want to thank all to the local church here and the technical team and the musicians and all the helps and governments truly we are blessed we are being blessed and god will continue to bless no matter what happens god will make a way even when there seems to be no way who would have thought that after two years we'd still be going through these pandemic conditions pandemic situations it's a new thing for us but with god there's nothing that he cannot understand nothing he cannot manage and he has made provision one more time through this virtual convention to reach us in our homes in our situations in our countries and to bring relief to us at such a time as this how good is it a word in due season to remind us of who we are in the mind of god and in the plan and purpose of god that everything is well all is well do you believe that all is well it is well with my soul it is well with my heart it is well with my mind it is well it is well there's nothing that's out of cater today there's nothing that's out of order today god has put all things in place as they should be there is no accident in god everything is put in place for us to get ready to leave this place come the church say amen so i truly appreciate the inspiration and the burden of this meeting this convention uh behold the bridegroom comment lamp trimming time what uh inspiration and how timely it is because that has been the message behold the bridegroom comment it's the all this message that has ever been preached behold a bridegroom comment and lamb trimming time and i know we have been blessed and as is often the case when many ministers preach on the same theme or topic or inspiration there'll be a lot of different overlaps as each man of god approaches the mountain from a different angle so i trust you'll be blessed today and if what i say has been said before well is god wants it to be repeated but we are trusting god to help us in this service and by the grace of god we are under great expectations so at this time i want to give my title and the title i have is they that were already went in with him they that were ready went in with him one more time they that were ready went in with him a subject behold a bridegroom comet and an inspiration a call to the resurrection the rapture and the winning supper hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord are you excited i owned a great expectation to leave this place more than ever i want to leave this place there's so much happening around the world it puts a desire in your soul to say lord even so lord come quickly hallelujah the world is groaning and travailing the medical situation the the economic situation the political situation everywhere you turn is a cry it's a despair it's a plea but we have a promise that others don't have which is we are going to leave this place we are preparing for a resurrection we are preparing for a rapture we are preparing for a wedding supper when the world is preparing for the funeral and they are preparing for the world coming to an end we are preparing for rejoicing we are preparing to have a grand time shouting on the hills of glory and no devil could stop it no demon could stop it no pandemic could stop it no sickness could stop it no mind battle could stop it no doubt could stop it depression cannot stop it frustration cannot stop it tiredness cannot stop it we are leaving this place if it's one thing you take away from this service is we are leaving this place up nothing's gonna hold me down nothing's gonna keep me back nothing's gonna take my joy i may have ups and may have downs but at this point in my journey my foot is on a rock i'm on a solid foundation and i'm gonna be ready i'm going to be ready are you going to be ready i know there are individuals here who are going to be ready because they that were ready went in with him oh in every age god had a people that were ready in every age god had a people who were prepared to respond to the call and i know that this age is no different this age is no different there are people under this land who under their message will be the final voice to the final age it's many years of preparation but we are here we are here we have arrived oh blessed be the name of the lord [Music] you may be seated hallelujah so i know a lot would have been preached i just want to touch a few points but i really want to hit on the day that were really went in with him it's important to be ready this cry behold the bridegroom comment should put us on the expectation because we have a destination hallelujah god didn't call us from the world to put us in church god didn't call us from the world to put us in the message god didn't call us to just be good church believers and to just be believers know that is just a part of the process to the destination oh hallelujah jesus didn't come to break five loaves and two fishes and that was part of the journey he had a destination can the church say amen it was good for him to walk on the water but that was on the journey that was not the destination it was good for jesus to visit the grave of lazarus that was on the journey that was the that was on the journey he still had a destination so don't mix up your journey with your destination don't mix up what the lord is taking you through to where you're going to end up because your destination is based on pre-destiny oh come on now somebody help me this morning somebody help me this evening your destination is based on predestination jesus was predestinated that's why nothing could stop him when they came he said my hour has not yet come go read the scripture again if you know what i come for you will know i have a bigger purpose don't try to get me before my time don't try to stop me before i finish what god called me to do we shall not all sleep oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh my son will sleep and over the last two years many went to sleep but they are those that are going to be calling those who went to sleep well wake them up again come on sons of god come on taught us of god bright time see time lamp trimming time you may be seated we have a destination don't get bogged down with the negative news sometimes you got to turn the negative news off you got to forget what the doctor's saying forget what the government's saying forget all the notices because they could put you in a state of fear and uncertainty why should we be afraid when we have faith and confidence in the god who called us he has kept us he is keeping us up he will keep us up the law that we serve he will not slumber he will not sleep slumbering and sleeping he do not belong to god oh hallelujah somebody help me oh hallelujah just a little encouragement the preachers have already preached i'm just a little spare tire to encourage you in this service here that we are leaving this place up your boss cannot go where you gonna go your neighbor may not be going where you gonna go so don't get upset with your neighbor don't get upset with your boss your inheritance there's not a natural inheritance your house that you live in is nothing to compare with the house your father your husband has gone to prepare for you he said i go to prepare a place that where i am you may be also behold the bridegroom cometh [Music] [Applause] hallelujah shake yourself shake yourself shake yourself i am bride i've been elected i've been predestinated hallelujah and all the skin worms destroyed this body yet in my flesh i will see god it doesn't matter what triumph doesn't matter what situation i know i'm in the arms of the lord if he chooses to put me to sleep god bless god i'm depending on my brothers and my sisters to wake me up but if we who are alive and who remain we have a responsibility to make a church that would make a revival we have a responsibility to be ready to wake up the sleeping sins they are counting on you they are counting on me they are counting on us the prophet is waiting the prophets are waiting the apostles are awaiting the sleep and saints in every age they are waiting on us hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord you may be seated so we have a destination hallelujah and nothing is out of order there's nothing that's out of order everything is in order because god is a god of order it was chaos he stepped in and said let there be light to establish order he's a god of purpose he's a god of plans dear god is not surprised so lift up your head whatever has happened in your life god allowed it to bring you to this spot to bring you to this service to bring you to this convention [Music] you may be seated i don't know how i end up there it's not part of my notes but too many of us claim to be believers and we want to blame this one and blame that one and blame this situation and blame that situation and because of so and so it's why so and so we have become great students and explainers have caused an effect and we miss the point that god allows things to happen and if he doesn't want something to happen it could never happen man is out of the picture because god has the power to move man anywhere he wants to he raised up pharaoh he bring pharaoh down he raised up babylon he brought babylon down you don't tell me my god is not mighty don't tell me my god is that powerful [Music] he said my thoughts are not your thoughts my ways are not your ways of this whole pandemic you don't think god saw this and saw who would make it and so who would stand up and so who would still go give god praise even when we don't have church service you're in your home but you're trimming your lamp you're in your home but you're doing what you're supposed to do lamb trimming time if they lock us down you don't stop trimming oh my my mind when they get to come to church you're still trimming when you're on your jaw lamp trimming time you're always trimming every day you're trimming you wake up in the morning you're trimming this is not about your wife it's not about your children but it's about you you're trimming you're making ready you're getting embraced because you heard the cry behold the bridegroom comment get ready to meet him we have got to meet him i want to meet him i need to meet him that's why i was born i was born to meet him [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah so let blaming people be a thing that dies in 2021 if she had done this if he had done this if he did not do this if she did not do this then my life would have been different if he had done it this way if he didn't do it that way then maybe i'd be in a different place is that so you have no power over what anybody else does it there's no value there's no benefit spending time addressing things you cannot control you have no ability to control anything else out of your situation no no you have to take responsibility for what you could control and right now you have the controlling of a scissors to cut to cut from your life what should not be there so that you can shine brighter because the devil can only operate in darkness or you don't hear me this morning hallelujah the devil could only operate in darkness and you would have heard it over the services that over time and many people they out on fire but the random type of the perfect picture of the believer is the wick one end you're on fire next and you're in oil and that's a wonderful picture every believer know what that feels like to be on fire if you don't know what it feels like to be on fire you gotta check your experience again hallelujah you don't hear me this morning you've got to be on fire if you're not on fire you're not in this thing you're you're a spectator we are on the playing field this morning we are in position fighting demons left right and center and i've got to be on fire sometime the fire is brighter sometimes the fire gets a little dimmer but i'm on fire i've got to stay on fire i don't want to lose this fire i don't want to give up this fire this fire is for my soul it's it's all over me it's keeping me alive anybody feel that way i'm all over the place forgive me but i get excited so there's fire on the one hand and that wick it you can't use anything to be awake you know the wick cannot be paper because it will burn down too easily the people if it was paper paper can't draw the oil from in the lamp but it has to be a special material so at a starting point even before we address oil and fire we have to address this special material called a wick that but the branham said is the picture of the true believer this wick is a special material hallelujah not any and any kind of material or somebody help me this morning somebody help me this evening so just to be a wick is a blessing oh god help me just to be a wick puts you ahead of the park just to be a wick puts you in a special category [Applause] [Music] you may be seeing it i don't know how much effort they put into coming up with the concept of a lamp what they may have tried before to see what could work to bridge the gap between the oil and the fire hallelujah will like most things in life it takes trial and error and trying and experimentation to get something that works but when they figure out what makes a good wick then that wick was able to do something very well it was able to reach into the oil pull the oil up and once you light fire it could keep the fire burning hallelujah and that wick took its time it was not a quick burning thing it will take its time once there's oil and it could pull into the wick it will keep on burning but there's something powerful about this and this is why this inspiration is so powerful once it's in use once the lamp is lit and it's drawing oil and it's on fire there's a side effect when we are in this existence that carbon is created some darkness is created there because you have to go to your job you have to go to school you have situation in your family and you're being tossed to and fro but it is not just that there's a problem there's a solution to the problem because god will ever give you something that there's no way of escape so there's a way of escape from the trials of this life that brings cab on and by the branham says it just interferes with the flow it interferes so carbon you might say brother isaac i'm not in sin is anything interfering with your prayer life interfering with your forgiveness interfering with your worship interfering with you being in the house of god interfering with your testimony interfering with your purpose you're on the right track you know but you're not going as fast as you could go because something is interfering you're on the right road we sing the song we're traveling on the right road but you are driving slowly because something is interfering too much carbon too much interference that's why party let us lay aside every weight that so easily besets us for some people it's every day to check in the pandemic there's no sin in looking at the numbers but is it interfering with your fate is it interfering with your confidence in god is it interfering with your faith in god to preserve you because if god predestinated that you make it through this i don't care what the numbers say i don't care what the doctors say i don't care how much variants come out those barriers have to respect the names that are in the book oh you don't you don't hear me when those variants come by you they say no not this one not this one not this one i'm not saying you may not get sick but they know they can't take your life and if god allows you to go it's because he allowed it so you can be part of the sleepers who those that are alive could wake up so it all is well all is well all is well all is well all is well [Applause] i've said it before mr branham said missing limbs will be restored nobody wants to volunteer to lose a limb if i ask for volunteers people look around and say maybe brother so and so he has more faith than i do maybe sister so and so she's a prayer warrior maybe she could maybe she could volunteer to fulfill that prophecy that missing limbs will be restored there are no volunteers because it's built in us by nature by god himself to survive [Applause] it's built in us to overcome it is not a willing thing for us to chop off an arm or foot or no it's not that easy for us even jesus didn't want to die [Music] that's why the god of gethsemane say lord if it's possible if it's possible i enjoy life too much because we were born to live and because he lives we can live so life is something to cherish it's something to preserve it's something to protect we have a reason to live for but there are also scriptures and prophecies that need be fulfilled and because god knows there are no volunteers god by election god by predestination would pick in the classroom who he chooses to take down a certain road or don't you love god that is not our choice in all these things he could choose knowing that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are be called according to his purpose [Applause] [Music] everybody feeling fine hallelujah what a mighty god we saved so we trust him in this response of behold the bridegroom commit just a few thoughts i want to share with you and know like i said you have been preached to so just to encourage you in this last service of the convention in the message putting on the whole armor of god now god cannot make a decision today and tomorrow come back and make a better decision that's us we we find a better way to do something we make a better decision but not god god cannot make a decision today and tomorrow come back and make a better decision because his first decision is perfect he never has to change it so therefore we can rest upon whatever god says and if god made a decision to put your name down in the book he already made a perfect decision he knows you're gonna make it he knows you're gonna overcome he knows you're going to receive the holy ghost he knows you're going to come to perfection he knows your name when the word is spoken you can't help but respond you can't help but say amen i see my name not the literal name but the mystery of who you are the mystery of your purpose the mystery of your destination the mystery of your lineage the mystery of your bloodline the mystery of your immunity the mystery of who you are [Music] blessed be the name of the lord it's always been god's way in modern events are made clear by prophecy it's always been god's way to let his people know what's going to happen before it happens he doesn't let everybody know but god lets his people know a predestinated people are called out people are chosen people so god's people are never surprised for years we talk about wars and rumors of wars and all these things and and we are living in it it should come to no surprise to us we knew we knew all these years that there were dark forces at work and all these things would lead up into a world system and a world order and a monetary system and all these things unfolding and we could spend hours and hours preaching on that but that is not getting me ready we just got to know we've got to understand it's good to see the signs of the time but i'm more interested in being ready because only they that are ready are the ones will go in so it's about the focus now that we are at this point about being ready we know how the story is going to end and i can imagine those virgins knew enough to know what was expected of them some underestimated the preparation and some were more prepared than required because they have extra means you have more than you need at the point in time i want to make that distinction one more time the foolish underestimated the cost underestimated the requirement underestimated what was needed but the wise they were more prepared i remember in school and i'm sure in different situations you've all went through this way you had an exam to take and there comes a point as you walk into the exam room there's nothing else you could do at that point in time you cannot have any books any recordings any class notes anything you you are going into that exam room with what you have and many people go into the exam room under underprepared and there are those who go in the exam room over prepared and it blew my mind years ago because they are students in every classroom we know them that you know they're underprepared you have to wonder about it everything about them speaks of a lack of a desire to be prepared they think they take things casually maybe they come from a privileged environment maybe they came from an underprivileged environment it doesn't really matter what environment it came from the issue is prepared or not prepared and you could see the discomfort in the exam room after a few minutes with those who are unprepared because in a few minutes time they're almost close to finish and it makes you wonder am i doing something wrong if you don't know their state you will wonder if something wrong with you not realizing that they just don't know the answer and they cannot give an account for all of the time the money the sacrifice whatever it is to put them into that room many times school teachers tell their students in preparing for an exam there are 10 modules in this course but i'm only testing you on six of these modules and i remember there was one student i know who no matter what the teacher said he studied alton even though the teacher said you're going to get tested on six he was just that kind of a student that what was taught he wanted to know it and it made me looking at this to give an example to maybe help the young people with what you could relate to you could choose to do the bare minimum in that scenario where the teacher said i'm testing you out of six out of ten models that six modules is really the minimum there are those who would say i'm studying all 10 because i'm not here just to pass an exam i really want to learn it's rare to hear it's rare to see but they still do exist and there are those who say i study in one module two modules because maybe it's just not that important to them but in that exam room how prepared you are puts you in a position of strength or weakness those foolish virgins they were prepared just not prepared enough how horrible is it to sit in the message for years and just be prepared and dismiss it because you're just not prepared enough versus the wise virgin who say you know what i'm not taking any chances is there anybody in the house who doesn't want to take a chance so we know how the story is going to end now let me just touch a few things this scripture that we read the kingdom of heaven through many parables and examples the lord left clues to us for us to look at this kingdom of heaven and i want us to understand that this bridegroom that we are typing out here is not any kind of bridegroom he's a bridegroom who is also a king because the reference is this is like the kingdom of heaven so it's not a bridegroom like this into any kind of bridegroom it's a king is about to be married and in many examples jesus said the kingdom of heaven is like a net cast in the sea that god does every kind and he's trying to use different examples to get the people to see what he's trying for them to see so the kingdom of heaven is like a net cast in the sea and it gathers every kind by every kind it means there's god there's bad there's ugly being called but there's always a time of separation he said the kingdom of heaven is like a man who had a wedding for his son and said come all things are ready and people had excuses you you remember the kingdom is having like a merchant seeking pearls to sell but sells all when he finds a pearl of great price speaking of the great sacrifice we need to make about this thing called the kingdom are you willing to sell all you have to get this pool of great price is this world of great price more important to you than everything else then we come to matthew 25 our text tonight the kingdom of heaven is like and jesus gives a parable a story an example filled with so much truths that is on the one hand there's rejoicing and on the other hand there's pain and there's despair but typically with the wedding there's there's a moment of excitement weddings are exciting it's it's an exciting occasion it's a joyous thing especially now more than ever where people have lost their values and their morals and these things and they play games even in the church even in the message people are playing games so it's an honorable thing when we have a wedding god is excited about this wedding it's been spoken throughout scripture so if you are excited i can assure you god is more excited about this wedding that he's taken about here he has waited a long time for this even when adam stood there in the garden of eden god looked at him looked at himself and he said i know what adam is feeling it's not good for that man to be alone and he brought a bride for his son adam oh hallelujah and every age he's looking at husband and wife and looking at marriage on field until one time he god himself saying i'm gonna have a bride oh hallelujah i'm gonna have a bride and his wife had made herself ready can the church say man god waited throughout history there had been many many weddings even jesus his first miracle was at a wedding anybody with me this morning many beautiful brides many bridegrooms but this wedding we're talking about that's in this parable that jesus has given is different because this bridegroom is different this is the wedding of weddings it's not the wedding of the century it's the wedding of eternity it's a wedding of time blending into eternity as god himself is about to take his wife it is not any bridegroom i don't know how many people have to speak at this wedding because this bridegroom goes by many names you know at a wedding people say things about the bride and they say things about the bridegroom can we talk about the bridegroom a little bit before we talk about the pride i can imagine people beginning to speak at the wedding of this pride and this bridegroom to describe this groom because he goes by many names he is king of kings he is lord of lords he is mighty in battle he's a wheel in the middle of the wheel he's a rock we need to rock his el shaddai he is jehovah jireh i can imagine how long it will take to give words about this bridegroom when in a wedding somebody talks about the groom they say well he is this he is that where this groom we're talking about i don't know when we'll finish talking about him because he is everything to me he is my joy he is my peace he is my rocker he is my salvation david said the lord is my shepherd anybody with me hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah and this bride i don't know how we're going to describe this bride because there's been churches churches brides brides churches churches rights but there must come one who has got mechanics and dynamics i can imagine how the lord himself because i don't think anybody else could speak about his pride like the bridegroom because that's flesh of his flesh it's only adam but a punch could have addressed even look and say this is flesh of my flesh this is born of my bone you are you came out of me he could have described who she was hallelujah but i could see god with the bridegroom looking at his bride and saying after all these years after all these dispensations after all these people after all this journey after all the sacrifice after calvary after the persecution i've sent kings i've seen priests i've sent prophets but finally mrs jesus christ there's no lady like this lady there's no queen like this queen there's no body on the earth you made me see that just think of how god talked about job have you considered my silver job and that's what's talking about joe this is his wife you're talking about have you looked at this lady have you looked at this bride who could sign like me who could finish what i oh come on now somebody help me preach this morning i'm not going to be too much longer with you but just very quickly the same way the lamp we don't have it anymore certainly in most of the world the technology has evolved and people are not used to these lamps and wicks and you know you still see them in certain places and in certain situations but a lot has changed in the way we do things and here in the western world the way weddings take place have also changed but this scripture in matthew 25 is of a specific pattern because it is based on the way weddings take place in that day in that time and in that location and a wedding is not like it is today there were multiple steps to a wedding so i want to quickly address those before i bring this message home to bring the type out you obviously cannot get married unless you have someone to marry so for god to get married he has to firstly find somebody to get married not just anybody but somebody you could talk to somebody who could relate to you somebody you can make plans with somebody who understands you you have to be careful because you want to make not a choice not a kind of choice but you want to make the best choice so for god to choose a pride if you are bride then you are his best choice you you you receiving that this morning you have to take your time in making that choice because that person represents you and that's why brother branham will say remember the bride will be a called out separated and different filled holy ghost born washed in the blood of the lamb she'll abstain from everything that's filthy she's a chaste virgin pure by the word the word and her are the same as a man and his wife become one in union so does the real genuine church of god when he becomes in christ the bible is punctuated with an amen every promise don't make any difference what the denomination says the soul that's in the believer punctuates it because it's a word in him speaking out so that first part is the selection of a pride or the choosing of a bride anybody with me after that bride is selected then there's a period called the contract where the groom draws up a marriage contract it's a covenant or it's a contract promise and a document is usually used for the purpose listen of assuring the bride assuring sorry that the bride will be provided for in some tradition it's called a bridal payment it's a guarantee that this bride don't have to worry about where she's gonna sleep worry about where she's gonna live worry about how she's gonna get food isn't that right and that contract changes the bride's status because it's not just it is not just a kind of thing there's another contract or it's it's it's what we call an engagement in the old days it was formalized now we just call it an engagement but in the old days it's not just engaged you have you have something seen what's going to happen next so you can rest your feet on this contract that says there's going to be a house provided for you and there's going to be food provided for you when you walk when you wake up in the morning some days you're going to get breakfast in bed anybody with me you're going to be well taken care of because this groom is more unable and he is making a commitment he's making a promise not just a verbal promise but in the old days it was a written promise so it's i'm coming for you but look i'm also writing down what i am putting in place to give your comfort so because you're not going to see me for a while whenever you're wondering what's going on pull the contract pull the document because the document says i am going to make sure there's food on your table i'm gonna make sure that you are taken care of i'm gonna make sure you smile i'm gonna make sure there's laughter in the house anybody anybody help me this morning once agreed that contract it became binding on both parties and they were regarded as husband and wife the bride was declared sanctified and set apart for her bridegroom so from that contract you set aside you nobody branham said god slipped the wedding ring on you before the foundation of the world do you realize that you're set aside sat aside you were born and you didn't even know you were set aside oh come on somebody preached back to me do you know who you are do you know what you're called to do do you know what your promise is [Applause] so because in that contract that young lady was no longer available she is taken she is off the market she is spoken for do not approach [Music] and she is to not let anybody approach come on young people don't you know you're paid for don't you know there's a contract don't you know there's agreement about your life you need to stop letting people approach anybody with me this morning so after that contract the next phase was a public announcement they call it a baptism or public announcement and it was common for the bride and groom to be separately taken a ritual immersion called a mikvah in the jewish tombs a representation of like a new birth the person emerged from the womb as a new person separated that does this song familiar we don't have it here in the west but but that was the process that's how serious this wedding thing is the couple would then make public so the contract part was in secret but now after the ritual baptism there's a public declaration of their intention to be betrothed and they were not they were considered married but not yet entered into a physical relationship so now it's getting deeper and deeper now after that there is a separation by design the groom then prepares to leave promising to return for the bride after a place is prepared [Applause] so now he knows that this thing is in place now it's preparation now he has to put things in place for the new couple at the father's home the bride listen doesn't know the time or the day but it's expected to be prepared and ready and separated until the return of the groom to claim her so she is on the expectation and it's bacon preparation because you don't know the day she don't know the hour but he's going to prepare meanwhile the groom returned to his father's home where he begins preparing for the eventual bringing home of his bride i go to prepare a place in my father's house and many anybody know what i'm talking about [Applause] you know this and listen the groom returns his father's home where he begins preparing for the eventual bringing home of his bride this was overseen by the father so it's not just the bridegroom doing what he wants the father has a vested interest in the way this is happening it's not happening any any kind of a way there's a way so it is overseen by the father who determines when it is finished so it is not even but equals up to the groom to say already you know you know some people don't say already and when they check but you didn't you didn't put the light here this switch need to fix this bed need to move here there has to be an approval an approval process to make sure it's really ready this was overseen by the father who determines when it is finished so that the son can return to bring his bride home in the meantime the bride is preparing for the eventual return of the groom and lives in anticipation is there anybody living in anticipation oh my my my my mind preparation and anticipation and the last stage is the groom returns at the end of the betrayal period to claim his bride the bride is aware of a general time but not the exact day or the hour this makes the arrival time somewhat of a surprise so the pride is always to be ready and this usually takes place at night and someone would go ahead to make the announcement of the groom's arrival usually shouting behold the bridegroom comment this would be followed by the sounding of a trumpet and the celebration to leave for the wedding can the church say amen so jesus was describing in matthew 25 what he was about to do it was more than just a parable it was more than a story jesus was seeing this unfolding and he was the first one to preach the message behold the bride will commit at some point in time every true disciple of christ would have preached that message behold a bride come cometh paul preach it hallelujah behold the bridegroom comment even paul paul thought the rapture was coming then you know paul put himself he said we who are alive but he claimed paul saw himself in rapture you know he said we who are alive and paul didn't know that he would join those who would sleep so real was it to him he thought he had come any day now because he knew jesus said i go to prepare a place hallelujah but man had to wait for every age for every season for every age to unfold paul put himself but he fell asleep irenaeus would have preached this message behold the bridegroom comment you cannot not preach this message because this is jesus message he preached in matthew 25 and every single preacher has to preach the same message announcing behold the bridegroom cometh irenaeus preach that message but he fell asleep martin he preached a message but he fell asleep columba he preached a message but he fell asleep luther preached a message but he fell asleep wesley preached a message but he fell asleep brother branham preached a message and he fell asleep but now here we are in 2021 we are preaching this message we are preaching the message because this is the last people of the last age there's no more ages to come no more messengers to come they all thought it wasn't their day but here we are it's our day we shall not all sleep we shall not all sleep behold the bridegroom cometh this message friends god bless you with a solomon for this inspiration will not be preached by another generation oh hallelujah this message will not be preached by another generation this is it this is it this generation shall not pass until all is fulfilled last age last season seventh watch this is our day this is it this is it this is it this is what we've been waiting for this is what we've been holding on for [Music] oh hallelujah hallelujah i'm not going to be too much longer with you but let's go we have heard this but matthew 25 verse 1 then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto 10 virgins [Applause] which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom so i want to identify here there are many things here but this is not people who don't want to make it this is not people who want to live in the world because they took their lambs they all tend took their lamps so taking up the lamp is not a separator they all went for to meet him so going forth to meet him all 10 did that dad also was not even a separator [Music] the bible goes on in verse two and five of them were wise five were foolish all virgins all holy all sanctified all going to church all reading their bible all in the message just somewhere wise some were foolish one taken one left all have the books all have the tapes all in the inspiration or believe the prophet all know the prophecies at hand all know the time is at hand because they all took their lambs and they all went fought to meet the bridegroom so the issue was not an awareness of time is short the issue is that an awareness that the season has come some were wise and some were foolish took their lamps and take no oil in the amplified it says no extra oil so they had oil but they had no extra but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps but they ran on taught us the oil represents the holy spirit so the difference between the wise and the foolish is not what church you go to the difference between the wise and the foolish is not which convention you listen to the difference between the wise and the foolish is not what inspiration you belong in the difference in the wise and the foolish is not who your pastor is the difference between the wise and the foolish was that if he was with the prophet or you was in the prophet the devil between the wise and the foolish is that if you're in branham tabernacle you're in headstone tabernacle or you're in any tabernacle [Applause] the difference between the rise and the foolish is that how long you're in the message the difference between the wise and the foolish is not even how long you pray the difference between the wise and the foolish is that how much quotes you read how you can explain the mysteries how you could interpret the word hallelujah the difference between the wise and the foolish was not if they had lamps the difference between the wise and the foolish was not if they even were on fire because they were all lit there's only one difference not two not three not five not seven there's only one difference the wise have lamps and oil and extra oil [Music] and that extra oil signified preparation admit you were ready [Music] people are happy to say i'm in this church i'm in that church i'm in the message all of that has no value when the bridegroom comes and you want to meet him the extra oil is the difference when the branham said the difference is the token but in branson after you receive the holy ghost here make yourself a christian so we're just talking about the birth on our experience we're talking about because people have experiences and the oil over time burns because the oil keeps you alive [Music] that's why when the disciples they were already filled with the holy ghost after they beat them they were all refilled with the holy ghost they were topping up their lamp because the process of life that oil is burning that oil is sustaining you and if you don't top it up you're going to run out if you don't keep putting oil you're going to run out of oil i'm not saying you never had oil i'm not saying you never had an experience i'm not saying you were never filled i'm not seeing you we're not packed out i'm not seeing you when a day in 1983. i was saying it wasn't there in this year and that year but but when last have you topped when last have you filled back because you've been burning on the same oil for some time aren't you concerned you're going to run out aren't you concerned that that that that that that that you're not going to have enough are you sitting down in church living on your experience some years ago and you don't realize you don't have enough because the foolish they did not realize until it was too late they were holding on thinking god was going to come earlier and because they tarried he tarried he tarried and they laid it there complacent with the layada sea on spirit didn't realize it was running out [Applause] oh help us help us i'm not going to be too much longer friends [Music] you're driving your car and they give you a gauge to show how much gas you have left if only it was so easy to know what oil we had left because when you're driving after a while when you drop below certain level a warning light comes on in case you didn't notice to let you know listen if you don't put more gas in this car you are going to shut down but the problem is there's no gauge for this holy ghost oil thing and the only gauge we could trust is to get extra [Applause] the only way to be sure brother anthony is to have extra [Music] [Applause] if it had a gauge you would know the condition you came into church with you would know if you're 90 70 50 40 30 and they say pray for me or but it's not like that you come to church knowing it is not well and situations they are blocking you carbon in your life it's two things i want to make a distinction friends he may be seated extra oil the difference brother branham said the difference is the token the token is the life the virtues the thunders the voices charity only the life perfect love can be received by the groom not a show not a performance not these are the books that i've collected this is my ipad with all of the prophet's messages that that doesn't cut it [Music] friends we'll get to it the lambs burning out is a scary concept because it meant that the darkness that they were in they couldn't make it to the bright room they needed light to make it out i don't know at what point the fool is realized wait a minute because the bible said they're all trim did that so even the foolish trim their lambs oh oh ho oh so it's not just the wild shrimp and the lamb sir the foolish treatment the alarms too but if you study this thing when there's carbon it slows down the burning and it slows down the lighting because it's only so much oil could come up a week that is damaged there's no free flow so when you cut and you cut that wick and you trim the lamp the floor starts back the light gets bright it begins to burn the oil faster than when there was carbon there so a small fire and carbon uses a little bit of reserve of oil but when you trim the lamp all of a sudden the flow accelerates to truly light up your situation and at that point you're ready but wait a minute if this thing keeps burning the rate it's going i'm not gonna have enough oil i'm gonna be walking down this road and i'm gonna lose light before i make it on the other side [Applause] in the messenger token the musician get ready the difference between life and death was the token and so will it be at the coming of the son of god when he brings the bride out of the church bride out of the church wise out of foolish wise and foolish to both in church and they're coming close to the end and uh now you listen close this afternoon and see if it isn't true the token will be the difference there has got to be a difference so they all have lamps they all responded they all trimmed their lamps there's got to be a difference after all these years and notice the difference is not doctrine the difference is not who he associated with who who who come in who who is he brother who's his sister who who you're connecting to if it was that easy then tell me i want to connect to but my bible doesn't tell me that people want the safety of groups the safety of knowing that so many people doing this activity it must be right and that has never worked because it's an individual affair [Music] i cannot afford to take the risk of basing my walk on anybody nobody the extra oil the token listen carefully in luther's day in luther's day the extra oil the token was to live out justification the just shall live by feet so if you were in that revelation understanding and not walk of the joshua lived by feet that was the extra oil of that day that was the token of that day but i branham taught us it was the same holy ghost in every age so the revelation of the joshua led by fate was the holy ghost of that day luther had enough of the holy ghost for a message and a revelation of justification when wesley came luther's message was not enough it is not that that message was an oil or a portion of the spirit but more was needed extra was needed so when wesley came wesley message became the extra there were believers who were still saying i'm following luther and i'm not with this thing that wesley brought those who cross over got the extra wesley's message became the extra as one watch faded into another those that were all right in luther's age had to make a choice to accept or reject the extra that wesley brought [Music] then the pentecostal scheme hallelujah then malakai 4 came the token the life of jesus christ and as each watch was blending into the next watch there was a choice to be made am i going to live with what i know and heard and preached because there's a new requirement and in our day it's the holy ghost itself it's the person of jesus christ it's the life of jesus christ it's a living fate a living virtue a living knowledge living temperance living patience living godliness living broadly kindness sealed by charity that god himself can declare there is my spirit flowing freely adoption time sons and daughters placed into positions when they are born and positionally born [Applause] i'm almost done matthew 25 is five and while the bridegroom tarried he's tarried many many many many taught that he would have come already i remember as a young preacher years ago still young but i was very young thinking that by now the rapture was going to come i remember being in school thinking surely i'm not going to make it to university i thought that that there's no way i'm going to make the university i left university how many years ago at the sea while the bridegroom carried they all all slumbered and slept those words are different slumber and slept they're two words i'm almost done while god has been preparing during his time of lingering this time of sifting during these two years of the pandemic in particular with people having a choice of their prayer life and their walk and the activities and the things we would have done that normally would have people a certain way now you've got to be more intentional about your walk and that's all over the world many churches some can't open some lock down some this and and and it really now is a test of do you really want this were you in it because your friends were in it were you in it because everybody came together on a sunday and and that jolt was enough because the requirement in this age is extra and to whom much is given much is required so the exam we are going through no other age had to go to this kind of an exam in this kind of a way in this season when knowledge has increased information has increased doubt has increased science has increased ideas and voices have increased never there was an age with so many competing voices telling you to do this don't do this listen to this person listen to that person this is right this is wrong this is not right this is the and everywhere if you don't listen to the voice of god you will go insane but yet still there's a bride yet still there are people who will keep to the word of god and they will do all that they can do to be ready so that when he shows up they are ready to go away [Applause] i'm almost done two words somebody and slept sleeping means dead but abandoned brought the type that the bride from the seven church ages are sleeping apart from those that are sleeping so those who have gone on before they are all asleep but there are those that are slumbering they are here now slumber means dormant inactive like you're dozing so you're not a sleeper you're not you're not you're not asleep you're just there dormant inactive the living bride slumbering in the message with all the books on the tapes slumbering in the message taking church for granted slumbering in the message taking conventions for granted this is another another meeting another service no one but abandoned would say the bride has not a revival yet there's been no revival there no manifestation i've got to stir the bride yet it'll take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up that'll wake up it's not wake up out of sleep as in the sleeping sins but to wake her up out of the slumber of inactivity the slumber of waiting the slumber of the time of lingering all these years it looked as if nothing is happening all these years you ever heard us say the same wake up sleeping giant all these years the bright slumbering some taking in the words i'm just there but there's gonna come something waiting for that something wait until those seven thunders out of their voices to that group who could take the word and hand it there it'll slice and cut it will gather apply together it'll show how to go it'll take those seven thunders to wake her up into action in other words the manifestation or the closing of the gap of behold the bridegroom comet will be those seven thunders uttering their voices to wake this bride up to get ready to leave this place and before we leave this place we will shut kel down on this earth because it will slice and cut you will claim your family you claim your children you claim your health you claim your joy you'll claim your peace hallelujah and there'll be a time you'll see those sleeping saints again before we leave this place oh yes you will see those sleeping saints again we go leaving this place together hallelujah i'm so excited oh hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] matthew 25 verse 6 and at midnight there was a crime made behold the bridegroom comment go ye out to meet him in other words at this time friends it's not it's not what the pastor is going to do it's not what the church is doing it's not what the convention is doing you go out [Music] to meet him you go out to meet the bridegroom but just know when you're going out to meet him you need your own light you can't use my light i need my light to meet him i need my lamp i need my oil i need my fire it's to help me get to him it's what he will recognize and it'll help me to recognize him [Applause] i've not been this way before so i need light so i can see where i'm going because he's here and i want to meet him anybody with me [Applause] that cry the bridegroom comment would not take place in front of the house it'll be before the house so the bridegroom is passing down the road and you're there in the back of the house and and there there are no street lamps there are no lights it's just your light to meet him if you can find him if you can't see where he's passing you're going to miss him oh hallelujah hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord verse seven we just go in too quickly then all those virgins arose and trim their lamps you've heard it preach throughout the convention cutting that carbon anything extra anything slowing you down you have to know what slows you down what may slow you down may not slow brother someone slow down or says the swords are down you need to know what's slowing you down for some people it's not sin it's it's sports it's playing games on the computer for some it is in all kinds of different situations but for some it's simple things you saw caught him in the news you will spend an hour watching cnn but you won't spend an hour to pray carb on it carbon it's interfering with your flow it's interfering with your state you're not worshiping like it should because there's carbon you have to cut it cut it clean don't leave some cut at all cut change for numbers of people who who affect your flow hallelujah there's a flow of the spirit don't let nothing affect your flow you want nothing to cut it this morning cut it today cut it today cut it today purpose in your heart is better you have no phone than for your flu to be interrupted cut family cut friends cut neighbors and okay what has to be separated trim your lamps trim your lamps church trim your lamps pride because you need all the light you can get what does that carbon do it makes your light not shine bright enough you need all the light you could get because there's cross darkness over here gross darkness over the people people can't see their way without light but there's a promise there shall be light in the evening time the pastor glory we will surely find oh hallelujah trim the excess but i want to make that distinction again both the wise and the foolish trim their lamps then all the virgin rose and trim the alarms read it their people in the message they wouldn't spit on the sidewalk but the man spoke about it but there's no fire but there's no oil perfectly trimmed they have mastered the art of trimming sit in church dead no fire no oil having a form of godliness but denying the power oh god don't let me get like that because that creates a self-righteous spirit of what you're not doing and what you don't do and what is she doing sister so and so nobody can look at anybody because there are three things that make this work you need the fire you need it trim and you need the oil if those three things are not operating effectively you don't know if you're going to make it you need to be on fire you need to be trimmed and you need to have extra oil mat 225 25 was it i'm whining now and the foolish senator wise give us of your oil for our lambs are gone out so after the trimming and the burning accelerated all of a sudden the foolish recognized wait a minute wait a minute my light just went out are waiting all this time for this wedding are waiting all this time to go to the rapture and i'm out of light my light has gone out what a position to be in in the message 40 years 30 years 25 years [Music] one taken one left that's what this is you know because god is not the respecter of tenure how long you in church how long in the message light going out and the fool is said to have give us of your oil for our lambs are going out but the wise answer saying not so i can't do it it is not that i don't love you it is not that i don't want to see you succeed it is not that i don't i want to see your feel it is not because i have a problem with you and the wise give a reason the only reason i can't give you is because i'm concerned that i forgive you i'm also not going to make it lest there be not enough for us and you but go he rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves in other words go check and see if there's still if you can still get i don't know go try to get what i have is enough of me for me and my house we want to serve the lord i've been doing all my best to make sure so me and my house we could serve the lord [Music] i want to help you i really want to help you but you have to go for yourself to get yours friends there's grace today to still go because the call the call is here but there's still a little time to go get it before it's too late oh god you could be gonna pay something softly very very softly friends the painful thing here it is not that these foolish didn't want to make it they had the best of intentions [Music] the bible said in first 10 while they went to buy friends they went to fix the problem they went to pray when they should have prayed they went to make things right when they should have meetings right they went to cry out for god [Music] at a different time a different place that is perfectly all right but in this case in verse 10 it was just a little too late [Music] friends in life there is such a thing as a little too late [Music] it affects your life it affects your business it affects your health it affects every area of your life if you don't take action fast enough you could reach that point where the very best effort is just too late there are people who take chances with their health and when they decide to make a choice to change so much damage was done unless there's a miracle it's a little too late because it takes a process to reach that way [Music] clearly during the time that is not recorded here in scripture the wise was doing something differently because they were all aware about getting ready so i don't know what the foolish was doing all the years when they were coming to church but i do know the wise was doing something different the wise was doing something more [Music] are you willing to do more are you willing to do extra to get extra are you willing to give more to get more are you willing to pay the sacrifice because the bible says go to them that sell in other words you have to pay the price it's going to cost you something you can't give all your time to the world and expect god to give you extra oil [Music] you can't live any way you want to and expect god to bless you are you willing to pay the price are you willing to sacrifice are you willing to break friendships for this great pool this perl of great price are you able to sell all you have to buy this extra oil are you willing to sigh and cry are you willing to give it up i want to throw away that worldly clothes that worldly music are you willing to give up your social media nonsense are you willing to give up the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh the pride of life are you willing to give up your self-righteousness i want to give up the odds and the grudges and the blame games there's a price it costs to keep these things it costs to give it up go to them that sell and buy pay the price pay the price pay the price and while they went to buy friends it's scary because they had it in their heart they wanted to make things right they wanted to make things right and while they are doing it it reminds me of the message do not cross the line but abraham said he saw them at the altar crying out for salvation but they had already crossed the line it was too late no matter what they cried it was too late no matter what they asked for it was too late and here it was while they went to buy the bridegroom kim [Music] and this is my title and they that were ready went in with him oh god help me i want to be ready i need to be ready i need to be ready lord i need to be ready lord i love my brother i love my sister but lord i don't want to take chances with me i don't want to take chances with me lord oh hallelujah i don't care about the doctrine i don't care i just want to be ready because that's the only thing that matters day that we're ready went in lord i don't want nothing hold me back from going in i don't want to be wondering if i'm if i could go in lord i want to be ready i don't want to wonder if i'm ready i want to know that i know that i know that i'm ready i've done everything i could do my tank is full my house is full my vessel is full my life is full i've emptied out myself i've checked myself i've examined myself i've searched myself oh god i don't want to take chances i'm locked up in my room but lord i want to be ready and wild they went to buy the bridegroom came he arrived and he's not waiting he's not waiting he is not waiting it's either you're ready or you're not ready you've got to be ready or you're not ready he is not waiting they that were ready went with him to the marriage and the door was shut the door was shut no more mercy no more grace the time for grace over just like noah's day the door is shut [Music] god shut the door friends if i could open it back i will but i can't god shut the door in noah's day when the door was shut no i couldn't do nothing about it friends [Music] where are you at where are you at church where are you at husband where are you at wife where are you at deacon elder minister brother sister [Music] don't be caught outside don't be caught outside verse 11 even more painful afterward came also the other virgins saying lord lord open to us friends this is scary to knock and the door is not going to be opened lord lord open up to us the bible says knock and the door will be opened seek and you shall find the bible says in isaiah 55 seek ye the lord while while he might be found for years we have known that there'll be a time limit on your ability to find god because judgment is set the arrow has been released and nothing can stop it you have to outrun the arrow you have to outrun the arrow you have to outrun the hounds of judgment that god has loosed he has held back the four winds good nights judgment that will begin in the sanctuary at the ancient men who have sat in the house for years but the door is being shut only those that are ready this puts the foolishness to the ground this puts issues to the ground this puts playing games to the ground this puts oats and grudges under your feet kill it today so we could enter in [Music] afterward came also the other emergency and lord lord opened to us but the lord himself answered they hadn't heard from it for a long time but he answered it said verily i say unto you i know you not i don't recognize you i don't know who you are hallelujah because i could only recognize the token i could only recognize the blood i could only recognize my person i could only eyes [Music] and the last verse i'm finished watch therefore watch therefore we are watching we are watching for you know neither the day nor the hour where the son of man coming in other words you got to get ready and you got to stay ready you got to get ready and you got to stay ready you gotta clean it up today clean it up this convention clean it up clean up your house get ready get ready stay ready

feast if any man thirst is there somebody thirsty oh hallelujah the foolish ended up crying ended up sighing but it was too late well there's time you sigh and you cry you make your altar in your home in your church where you at you make your altar you make your altar and pay the price to get that extra oil oh god it's me today standing in need of a touch it's me standing in a need of prayer lord

bridegroom comet and i want to be ready i need to be ready lord i need to be ready oh god don't forget my children don't forget my house don't forget my family once more lord you did it before you
