[24:50] children then as a children are
[24:53] partakers of Flesh and Blood he also
[24:55] himself likewise took part of the same
[24:58] that through death he might destroy him
[25:02] that had the power of death that is the
[25:04] devil and deliver them who through fear
[25:07] of death were all their lifetimes
[25:10] subject to bondage for verily he took
[25:13] not on him the nature of angels but he
[25:16] took on him the Seed of
[25:18] Abraham wherefore in all things it
[25:21] behoove him to be made like unto his
[25:24] Brethren that he might be a merciful and
[25:28] a a faithful high priest in things
[25:31] pertaining to God to make reconciliation
[25:34] for the sins of the people for in that
[25:37] he himself had suffered being tempted is
[25:41] he is able to sucur them that attempted
[25:45] and we continue over to chapter 3 verse

[26:08] 10 for by one
[26:13] offering he had perfected forever them
[26:16] that are
[26:17] Sanctified whereof the Holy Ghost also
[26:20] is a witness to us for after that he had
[26:23] said before this is the Covenant that I
[26:26] will make with them in those these sayth
[26:29] the Lord I will put my laws into their
[26:31] hearts and in their minds will I write
[26:34] them and their sins and iniquities will
[26:36] I remember no more for where remission
[26:40] of sin for for now where remission of
[26:42] these is there is no more offering for
[26:45] sin having therefore Brethren boldness
[26:48] to enter into the holiest by the blood
[26:51] of Jesus by a New and Living Way which
[26:54] he had consecrated for us through the
[26:56] veil that is to say his flesh

[1:14:16] seed is watered it Springs forth into
[1:14:18] life and you know what what is the word
[1:14:20] worship what what is the word praise let
[1:14:23] the pastors don't know that because the
[1:14:25] the church with Morpheus and the arms of
[1:14:27] Morpheus they call out dead sleeping and
[1:14:30] man saying he would going in
[1:14:31] subconscious men hitting big snow in the
[1:14:33] church but the would go on subconscious
[1:14:36] praise God but the praise is the
[1:14:38] Thanksgiving that brings the water upon
[1:14:41] the seed in your heart that's when you
[1:14:43] know you have Revelation he staggered
[1:14:45] not at the promise of God true unbelief
[1:14:48] but was strong in faith giving praise
[1:14:51] giving glory to God because he was fully
[1:14:54] persuaded that what God promised he was
[1:14:56] able to perform that's a revelation when
[1:14:59] a Rel comes to you you know God said
[1:15:01] that you know God can't lie God is not a
[1:15:03] man that would lie he's not like them
[1:15:05] lying prophets and lying pastors and
[1:15:06] preachers in the tongue no he's not that
[1:15:08] kind of man if God say he will heal you
[1:15:10] he would heal you if God say he will
[1:15:12] baptize you he'll baptize you God say s
[1:15:14] fire upon you he fire upon you God said
[1:15:17] give you a breakthrough you'll get a
[1:15:18] breakthrough oh give the Lord a shout
[1:15:21] believe God for your business believe
[1:15:23] God for your health believe God for your
[1:15:25] family believe God for in your SP of
[1:15:27] your struggles come on come on come
[1:15:33] on
[1:15:35] listen you can put me on record after 30
[1:15:39] years of preaching I can say this that I
[1:15:42] have never one time sincerely asked God
[1:15:46] for anything and committed it to him he
[1:15:50] either give it to me or told me why I
[1:15:52] couldn't do it why he couldn't do it
[1:15:55] we talking about
[1:15:57] committing you committed you committed
[1:16:00] where you committing and bringing it
[1:16:01] back up for why you committed and R back
[1:16:03] up for you committed committed let God
[1:16:05] Work It
[1:16:11] [Music]
[1:16:12] Out you simply say it's God's word it's
[1:16:16] not for me to try to figure it out that
[1:16:18] is God's business he spoke it and all
[1:16:22] necessary something will take place then
[1:16:24] he he said then watch what would you do
[1:16:26] he said what always remember church God
[1:16:28] word is true and he said Divine what if
[1:16:31] you can look at this right way remember
[1:16:34] here has been my standard in my life I
[1:16:37] have tried to do this the first thing I
[1:16:40] want to find out if it is the will of
[1:16:41] God or not then I know it's God's will
[1:16:43] the next thing is my objective to it and
[1:16:46] my motive in doing that so it's not just
[1:16:49] the will but why do I want
[1:16:52] it what is my motive amen
[1:16:55] what is my objective motive and
[1:16:58] objective that brings you to an internal
[1:17:01] audit of your own
[1:17:03] desires of your heart's intent of your
[1:17:07] heart's motive and objective that's a
[1:17:09] personal audit that you're not just
[1:17:11] jamming god with I want this I want that
[1:17:14] I want that I need this no
[1:17:20] why so next thing I found out is the
[1:17:22] will of God then I know it's God's will
[1:17:24] next thing is my objective to it motive
[1:17:26] in doing it then if it's the will of God
[1:17:28] and my objective is right and my motive
[1:17:31] is right I have faith that it will be
[1:17:34] done because first is the will of God
[1:17:37] then my objective is to glorify him my
[1:17:40] motive is to give him all the glory so
[1:17:42] there's no selfish motive about it at
[1:17:44] all and if you have selfish motive it
[1:17:47] won't
[1:17:49] work so selfishness have to get boots I
[1:17:53] mean boots you have to boot it out you
[1:17:57] have to get out of you get out of
[1:18:00] self-interest get out of what you feel
[1:18:02] that why say eternal life is living for
[1:18:06] others if you're more objective is to
[1:18:08] make money for yourself or something
[1:18:10] you'll never succeed when you try to
[1:18:13] something outside the will of God it
[1:18:14] won't work to begin with so there's a
[1:18:16] genuine Faith but you must come into a
[1:18:20] real channel of God to have that genuine
[1:18:23] Faith there is human faith and there's
[1:18:26] the faith of God and you must have a
[1:18:28] Godly Faith to believe and to have this
[1:18:31] Godly Faith you must have the mind of
[1:18:32] Christ in you all right let's go cast up
[1:18:36] now be about to take
[1:18:38] off now he says now healing is not
[1:18:42] something that you just say well I
[1:18:43] believe I believe if that's the best you
[1:18:46] can do just mentally I believe I believe
[1:18:48] I accept it then if you accept it on
[1:18:50] those basis watch if you accept it on
[1:18:53] those basis keep saying it over and over
[1:18:58] say it out
[1:19:00] loud did you ever hear that he say say
[1:19:04] it out loud you know say it over and
[1:19:07] over just keep saying I'm Healed I'm
[1:19:08] Healed say it until you actually believe
[1:19:13] it and when you believe it it's going to
[1:19:16] take
[1:19:19] [Applause]
[1:19:20] place there's a special teaching tonight
[1:19:23] you know there's something that I love
[1:19:24] he said about Abraham he said when
[1:19:26] Abraham come to the fullness of
[1:19:29] believing that mean ABR had his trouble
[1:19:32] in but he came to a place where I say
[1:19:35] this way his faith got
[1:19:36] ripe so let's say this way your faith
[1:19:39] could be
[1:19:41] green so it's not fully anchored yet but
[1:19:45] when your faith get right no devil can
[1:19:47] move
[1:19:49] you because you are anchored down by the
[1:19:53] word by it it is anchored inside of you
[1:19:58] oh give the Lord a shout so s frustrate

[1:21:27] is baptized with the holy spirit that
[1:21:29] would start your confession I believe I

[1:23:06] in sickness and sin has already been
[1:23:07] appropriated in Calvary the only thing

[1:23:29] sinner because Jesus is the high priest
[1:23:33] of our
[1:23:34] confession he can't do nothing for us
[1:23:37] until first we confess what he has done

[1:29:27] is he he's the high priest of our
[1:29:28] confession is that right Hebrews 3 he's
[1:29:32] the high priest of our confession then
[1:29:34] he cannot do things for you until and
[1:29:36] you cannot make intercession until first
[1:29:38] to confess what he has done then he can
[1:29:41] only act as we confess no confession no
[1:29:45] action oh give the Lord Praise In The
[1:29:48] House Hallelujah and remember nothing
[1:29:52] can be done without faith it first must
[1:29:54] be confessed and he's the author of
[1:29:57] faith and your faith brings God it's the
[1:30:01] thing that brings the prayer and God
[1:30:02] together in the scene Faith changes it
[1:30:05] and brings it together all Christianity
[1:30:08] right with me tonight all you are all
[1:30:11] you ever will be is based upon faith in
[1:30:14] the word that's the reason I believe the
[1:30:16] word Oh Glory to God I'm going to close
[1:30:18] with this testimony Hallelujah but say
[1:30:22] this Bible is the word and if a man
[1:30:24] woman whoever speaks anything to be the
[1:30:25] truth that's contrary to the contents of
[1:30:27] the Bible it is wrong and I have tried
[1:30:30] by God's help to make my Ministry that
[1:30:32] the Lord Jesus to presented to the
[1:30:34] people upon a solid basic Foundation
[1:30:37] God's Eternal Word if I come and told
[1:30:39] you that God give me power to go and
[1:30:41] make the blind to see and the deatha to
[1:30:43] hear that would be contrary to his word
[1:30:45] I told you and that that that touch the
[1:30:48] poll and you'll get well that's contrary
[1:30:50] to his word but when I come preaching
[1:30:52] the gospel the gospel is the good news
[1:30:55] that Jesus has come and has redeemed us
[1:30:58] and died in our stead isn't that right
[1:31:00] so no matter how weak here we go how
[1:31:03] sick how far in sin whatever the
[1:31:05] condition is he is there to make
[1:31:07] intercession upon what we confess that
[1:31:10] he had did for us and anything including
[1:31:13] the atonement he was wounded for
[1:31:15] transgressions he was bruised for
[1:31:17] iniquities the time of Peace was upon
[1:31:19] him when the will heal any of those
[1:31:22] things those attributes of his debt that
[1:31:24] we take into our hearts and believe to
[1:31:26] be the truth and confess what he has
[1:31:28] done he said he we feel anything about
[1:31:31] it he's before God to make it right if I
[1:31:34] was paralyzed and in my heart I believe
[1:31:37] he healed me I would confess that I was
[1:31:39] healed if I couldn't move a muscle I
[1:31:42] will believe I'll confess I was healed
[1:31:44] and I meal from my heart not mentally
[1:31:46] upset but from my heart praise God by
[1:31:50] his stripes I am healed no matter how I
[1:31:52] feel well look you say your heal and
[1:31:55] look right look at the body that don't
[1:31:56] have nothing to do with it God don't
[1:31:58] said so it ain't what I see it is what I
[1:32:01] believe Hallelujah he G his testimony
[1:32:03] now when I was so sick I couldn't hold a
[1:32:07] mouthful of food in my stomach the best
[1:32:09] doctors in the nation examined me said
[1:32:11] it's impossible for him to get well I
[1:32:13] read God's word I asked God to help me I
[1:32:16] eat cornbread beans onions I took a big
[1:32:20] mouthful my mother got scared and called
[1:32:23] the doctor I swallow them and when I
[1:32:25] swallow they come right back up again I
[1:32:27] held my hand over my mouth I can't do it
[1:32:30] God done said so I swallowed it back it
