rain in the first month and the floor shall be full of wheat the fats shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the locusts had eaten the cankerworm the caterpillar and the Palmer will migrate an army which I sent among you and you shall eaten plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that a dead one justly with you and my people shall never be

will I pour out my spirit and I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth blood and fire plus of smoke the the Sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and terrible day of the Lord shall come I'll be that next verse and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered for in Mount Zion and Jerusalem shall be deliverance as the Lord had said in the remnant whom the Lord shall call or praise for all a scripture reading tonight is on 2nd Timothy 3 it says this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come we talked about 2024 men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection trucebreakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady highminded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god having a form of godliness this is church folks friends but denying the power thereof from such turn away or praise the name of the Lord hallelujah you love him tonight oh praise God don't think I've finished here oh yeah no I'm not finished what taurah was hallelujah okay six for this of the short at the witch creeper the houses and leave captive city woman a church woman leading with sins let our divers lusts Evelyn never able to come into the knowledge of the truth no as Janice and Jambres withstood Moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt mainland reprobate concerning disease Oh hallelujah let's pray father we thank you for your word tonight bless it we feel you anointed me feel a presence here come among us in a special way and minister to your people in Jesus name we ask it amen amen you might be a seats and give the Lord a shout as you sit down Oh glory to God these men a reprobate consider one thing defeat Oh glory to God that's the problem the faith defeat is the problem Oh hallelujah we believe that hallelujah so we are promised to be born again right oh you mean born again by the word and the spirit so gore sent his word and wasn't a spirit for you to be born again that's the first message you must be born again so what put all the world together to present it to you to give you a book a fresh foot not the message but the original bit that's why the faith is a team back to heart the feet the messages turn our hearts back to the feet of the fathers isn't that right and God wanted atmosphere for this bird isn't that right that Monsieur of what default sanctification clean worshipping or praising God a constant expectation or glory to God or when you come here with that kind of expectation I know faith is working in you because faith is ever an expression works is always fear to express you can't talk this wait you have to show this faith you have to express this way I know but the message thing I'm talking about the word thing I know what people have here I'm talking more what the Bible expect of us or Godfrey revelation bring expectation hallelujah understanding and knowledge and information have no expectation and that you could read a lot in newspapers you could read it in a magazine but when God give you revelation it brings expectation for a manifestation God doesn't give you a fit for nothing he tell Abram you have a son that's a promise and that give him the faith to believe Isaac was coming and he was an old man what in his whole life I had to believe her because coordinates speak to her she didn't have a revelation but he had to fit and you have to live that out for 25 years everyone believed God you can't stop now you can't pack up shop though you can't pull back now nosey our [Applause] [Music] or forget the title the title have tonight is he shall come to us as rain that's from whose gs6 he shall come to us a dream I'll have an inspiration and this is from this from Luke 18 when the son of man commits shall we find feet on the it hallelujah when the son of man commits shall define feet in here maybe I'll take a quick look at that scripture oh praise the name of the Lord if we consider tonight Luke chapter 18 but before that was Luke chapter 17 okay and Luke 17 says likewise 28 as it wasn't is a lot to eat drank they bought they sold they planted they builded the same day that lot went out of Sodom it reinforced on from heaven and destroy them all notice the simplicity and the the normal livin that was an operation when this was happening you see under the normal circumstance the sunrise sunset everything normal to eat the build go to work pay the bills but something is up then in the realm of the spirit because in the supernatural realm because Abram is elected the angel is with Abraham given him a revelation of the judgment that is fixed and set that God not put the canceled it's already set or glory that God God's not gonna cancel it already set that's why Berman said we are striving to enter into the kingdom of God before these horrible plague strike so you see where the virus come in the coronavirus and people getting scared and and what not it what's gonna come he said they're all gonna come and cancer will be to take to what's coming men will rot in their flesh and they're dead yet Oh glory to God and say we are waitin for the manifestation the sons of God Abba stop cancer stop these plagues so that the plagues coming this way and the sons of God comin this way so inflates coming in missiles about coming I'll go tell them plates recommend any sons the one that come in alone the only reason vodka same place the because sons of God coming nicest ones I've got to challenge that poor glory of God God raised up from the challenge that they not doctor for us in to hide in the hidin mode this is the bring us of the manifestation mode if you want apostle explains you have apostolate conditions do a shelf in the house if you want an apostolate Church you have to have a personal condition or glory to God hallelujah so when Jesus you may be seated so when she was talking about Sodom days and and Gomorrah days and so on he was saying those spirits that was back there could be returned again but if there's an elected was back to re-elected in this time if angels coming back take a they'll come this thing Oh glory to God if they're sodomites go back a hot sodomized this time I don't care what was racism they have it have them judgment is fit sunset but they've got to be a people that court have separated that God has to anoint that could have to inspire or glory recorder people at this battered and bruised but under promise I will restore I don't care what you have been through I look at what Haley I've been true God said I'm gonna restore God is not a man that would life there's God steady gonna restore he is going to do it or give the Lord a shout we don't have to manufacture anything Oh glory to God I believe what God said you may be seated please God hallelujah and as well it is a lot lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even dust shall be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed hallelujah then he went on then does he remember Lot's wife and we know luke 1730 is a manifestation and k-pot in this day to a profit of one a fight for freedom Aryan Branham and through him the Salomon was revealed Jesus Christ step into that 16 element and reveal all the world is not right and opened up the book is not right that you could see your name you are not Pentecostal you're not Baptist you're not you're witnessed a nun Methodist or glory to God your name is in the world so what other quality' Baptist Methodist that's not your name that's blasphemous names all their name is blasphemous names but God call your to give you a new name Oh glory to God hallelujah praise God right after death right after the scripture is that I tell you in that night there'll be two men in one bed one shall be taken and the other shall be left true men shall be crying together one shall be taken and the other left two men shall be in the field one taking on your left they say where are you say wheresoever the body is dead Eagles gonna be

come on brothers you're gonna drop down dead in this hour God raise you up to restore God raise you up to anoint you God raise you up to inspire don't give up now [Music] maybe season there will come another year of Jubilee we have had just about this time if you're noticed Pentacles has been fallen in America for 50 years somewhere in that time just about 50 years ago Pentecost began the fall now what's happening the church is receiving the 17th book of the revelation of Jesus Christ and not one tenth of them can receive it but when you begin to see the year of Jubilee where we don't have to fuss and stream and pull we already secured in Christ Oh glory to God you mean the Jubilee you lost the fuss and pull the anointing will be upon you when you're in bondage you have to wait and labor but when the Jubilee trumpets so it's only something for them who don't and not behind Wallace then who behind walls can hear the trumpet all glory to God but you and all who had a trumpet have the opportunity to both free from their slave masters that's what the Jubilee is about and every word is a trumpet or glory to God in the last days there come a famine Simon Barrett angrily not for books and tapes not for Bibles but for the hearing of the true Word of God bigger entities if I run to the west they're gonna run to the north they're gonna run to the shout but that truth of God or glory to God who we know is the voice of God it will be a manifestation of the prophets word I'm speaker but he'll shake without profits me I have my message a comment not a man's message or give the Lord a shout Oh hallelujah may be seated amen it's astonishing but with 17:33 Solomon's revealed and the next scripture actually we didn't get it chapter 18 Jesus gave a parable about in the city a judge a fear not God no man so this jaw Jack ain't nothin and there was a widow in that city she came unto him Zin avenge me of my adversary so this woman here are no husband to help her so she on she own and she called the judge for justice yet because this woman troubling me I will adventure what and he said what and I was a widow and she came unto him saying avenge me of my niversary he would not for a while what if I wear and afterwards he said within himself though - her good nor we got man yet because this Widow troubling me I will Avenger least by her continual coming she weary me and this is how I want you to come before God where you mature praise where immature prayer where immature bleedin wherever the askin stop sub-sub complaining about this and complaining about that go to God and say God I'm still here written on the healin with the middle of errands and are coming tomorrow I expected it today that's making it tomorrow but if I ain't get it today I come in tomorrow you will hear me on the lane got a darling here up I ain't givin up the pre-shot I stopped here they didn't can't stop here Noel that I stopped here the who sees in secret will reward you openly if you peepee at the pray in secret if when you warm you brush your knees nobody could stop the anointing raining down upon your life nobody has stopped the Holy Ghost from coming into your house okay the Lord a shout Oh glory to God remember boredom the grandchildren brought over young sons and daughters my god I will tell you he will avenge them speedily never s when the son of man commits shall he find faith on the earth what he's asking for what is he asking for shall I find the faith that the Prophet restored not if a general don't forget look if you do for if it forget everything else tonight to forget this path it is not a feet it is defeat that was once restored but if I turn four shall we find that fate he didn't ask for groups he has some message - sure but nice church names he acts in four shall I find that feet back in the people the feet have restored that was in the profit the profit is gone but he brought to reveal would and I would be in breach what or what about bring the feet inside your heart isn't that right hallelujah because D faith is to connect with the Holy Spirit but our d face you can pull down the camp which is watching me to get out of here Oh glory to God come like what you have the car and you'll need a gasoline if you're already gasoline you cannot go to where you can try to tumble any but you can't go nowhere that I need a gasoline so to pull down the power you need to feed so before you're gonna rupture you're gonna pick up with him guys had you can't go forward and deliver back what you had to go back and pick up the feet that they had because they had buffet to Bernie rapture it justice I was not yet they were anointed they were adopted equipment powers all over them but that the following in the grown now we have to get the same power unknowing tent adopted and then we could leave or glory that God leave back smoke in the devil's face and when the devil mr. bride you can make war with the woman the remnant of woman seed that never gonna miss that Brides oh gosh I miss them and looking for them foolish virgins or glory to God nice people but foolish stupid moxie hallelujah hallelujah have no burden not 20 extra to get the extra oil foolish they recently passed out bringing bad luck he's a priest hallelujah foolish hallelujah rise my man like my man foolish or glory to God depend upon the children hiding in a church foolish to understand if the individual affair is I did not come to build another denomination I comfortable individuals of a perfect man or glory they brought foolish Laurita golly man oh let me see it good God is knotted up in the sermon God is not adopting the message he's adopting the man he is more interested in a man than the sermon he said you can limit and stop preaching it not so important the man is or chlorine accord because there's sermon at the world to the man or glory to God he said this bein when is completed is the servant of God in the church of god that's cool in rapture in all ways that have to become a being not a picture a backboard a living hate come on give a lot of shout and knowledge I live in temperance live in patients given coordinates live in brotherly can live in not talking not explaining living how could you know it living even attested how could you know it even if gotta put something to show and bigger past the proof if living when the condition come let's see of faith let this ambition come let's see a virtual when the condition come let's see a patient's Honore when the collision come let me see the minister have the we call intrapersonal skills that is that is the ability to control your emotions and your issues on the inside and don't allow that to rule you and rule your judgment because if they don't have that internal skills on the inside that internal check and balances the inside your emotions gonna rule you and you will judge things by your feelings and by your emotions and you kind of do that or nothing leadership or glory they've got to be a call to a higher order or glory to God forgive for Christ's sake or glory to God even if you're getting pressure for Christ's sake drop it let go you got to get up cause faith is based upon forgiveness I don't care what anybody do you you have to let it go in a little flower see this piece up unforgiveness the faith to pull you on charity when you stand praying for charity forgive if you have ought against honey there's got to come with a real revelation of brotherly kindness so this spirit is a bright spirit that desert break as Christ's spirit that is to be in you that is prophesied to come become the past I report my spirit that's my spirit that consists of seven parts it's spirit to come upon your life do you believe that do you expect that okay now his spirit couldn't have been released to the ages in that way in that measure because the world was lost in seven ages but he sent seven angels from eternity to get it back together he calleth discovered wood to tie it back in the world to bring don't know where he goes so the holy verse will only come where the holy was with his act because the word and the spirit are one so to the ages because the word was lost bought at a burning good reveal impact pad pad pad pad pad so when he sent a prophet he was I'm a prophet the God of all hallelujah so he said the fullness of the Holy Ghost has visited the church to make loop 17:30 hallelujah so that was Christ himself the mighty angel of revelation 10 one coming on to the prophet revelation 10 7 that word give it to the bride revelation 10 8 to 11 or glory the court so in that scripture version 10 you see the angel mighty in generation 10 1 you see the thunder squirrel to catch surprise relish and country and for you see the seven angel messenger revelation 10 7 stamina yet and then you see a bride that is promised to go to the angel and get the book and eat the book and prophesied or get the Lord I show it shall come to pass afterwards I will pull out my spirit and your sons and daughters shall prophesy give the Lord a breath [Applause] so revelation 1080 let me know one man miss a good one representin 8:11 I saw and the voice said go to the engine and say give me that book and John represented the bride so in revelation can have the mighty angel have the messenger and as of the bride the bride of the prophesy again before tongues before nations before countries you know read Mia tonight we are prophesied right in the devil's face we are prophesied there is sickness coming disease coming to be a prophesy there's no can has shaken Church conditions but we are prophesied we are prophesied what will become of us we are prophesying our promise our manifestation we are prophesy what what do you say my

hallelujah don't you know before we leave here we have had earlier when the astronauts of the vaulted space that have a rehearsal after going the cabins and Getti and getting light and throw things so to get a custom with the atmosphere that across there so before we leave here you have to have the atmosphere across here to get that custom that what we go in with that was the caveat oku never see

come to seek God yes we put see Jesus Oh glory of God hallelujah hallelujah my lord my lord all right okay so we read a scripture 2nd Timothy and perilous dish Tom come men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters people hace unbelievers and sinners but we I know that this is judge Fuchs cuz I'm having a form of godliness and then we have them to giants them to intellectual guys Jerris and Jambres withstood movses so will these resists the truth men of corrupt minds concerning the feet the Caprice everything but defeat because if it if there is not a token if it is a manifestation that's why Paul's told and he said I didn't come with you with enticing words of man's wisdom because I see if you if I bring that know your fate chorus on that because I could bring it real Nance I teaching you this thing you said but I bring the power of God that you're fit my rest and access power because you're no man can tap into that when you see power begin to issue forth you know no matter working or engine be working that up if I'm an expert listen you can explain why not on cam a man could teach without the Holy Spirit it happened in Nice Bible teachers he's in a real good word but it have no it has no she came the glory upon the manner that is being spoken no unction no no inspiration and this is what you need but once a good priest and all the hair fall out it has to be inspired to you so the first never have to fight is worship the first thing ever right is singing very informational but no not inspirational let me say that again that's one good very informational but not inspirational so the place dry after the song service it dry it's still dry people come dry go home dry the home dry it's really dry it must be a Fallon but you need rain and he promised to come to us as we form an ocarina you have to come looking for real well cut the sky the place dry but serenely with time I ring for Khloe to go be puffy signed is that the rain is on its way God said so or glory to God amen so know the script to be read I read at the night on purpose think I wanted to identify that the Scriptures the two spirits work in the framework of the church so this is one spirit here which is fungus the computer one four to seven which is faith and virtue and knowledge and temperance all this here and this other one here is in X period which is traitors heady highminded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God trucebreakers without natural affection fast Feliz distributor parents and tongue for holy and any message it was I see him and Estella toot I'm not begging vmm I push in true Hollywood cut these guys these guys with this truth and god his attitude from where the in one path that way caught one treat from not your mode from your heart waiting boy called David a man after my own heart if it was will be a sucker be able to do all kind of stuff but God see what is new man huh you can't beat that letter somebody there things we can control and they are things God alone can control there's certain things you cannot control Paul that's God's business but your business you could see about that or glory to God and we are confident and responsible to see what God put in our hands let's continue he said no watch remember Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts and the book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist spirit will come enter the church and defile it mechanic lukewarm formalin powerless so so that's what he'd ever come to squeeze the holy spirit out of the church and once the whole spread common a church you have to take up a man come on explain God and explain in words so you know what spirit you know many all kind of Revelation some cuckoo some crazy some plumb of the wood but whoo yeah because spirit okay you know is I enjoy talking is somebody talking somebody tellin things and that is why the Prophet said the spirit and the bride and the Prophet will see the same thing and what they see will already be set in the world so we can save new things as he same all things freshly inspired everything I appreciate the night you know already everything I'm saying is and as you have heard before but in the season and time but officially inspire and transform you from where you are the way you're supposed to me or glory to God because every service you need revelation and revelation is the operation of the Holy Ghost that translate and interpret the word as the word is spoken to you so you have Harriet intellectually you're hearing in my revelation so you could get it wrong in here and the man next we don't even know it's up down inside of here everybody here in the word as in Israel but unto a few was it hot fit apply it all glory to God hallelujah praise God o all Israel is not Israel Oh hallelujah you believe that may be seated so the devil job is a sneak in the church making it lukewarm and formal and powerless a minister I see you know I hope these words you know we are blessing to you because because there's no power there was no glory there was one Norrington there was no expectation you see because you see could I tell see me on your old man stay warm we can give Simeon a rocking chair for his retirement but because Simeon had revelation and he will not see death unto the Lord Christ he got rockin rockin chair whom Christ that come in dear you know Christ I become a new temple so he rocking chair when is there no service but once his her service Simeon find himself in the house of God because you know he's no whitsunday that baby coming in he know Jesus had a comment some day poor Chloe that what every Sunday senior in church because Simeon expect that manifestation to walk in some big or glory he expecting every night every service hallelujah see men know because it's revealed to him and win something reveal to your mother can take it out your father can take it out the past I can take it out no bishop no man to take it out what's revealed to you Oh glory to God and don't tell me you could only get revelation by me or to me or with me that's not true he revealed himself to whomsoever he will give the Lord a shout you

with that that was not a governmental issue that was Church issue that was a trumpet sounded calling a scriptural war because Jesus was one the summary our prophesied as Messiah hallelujah he came unto his own his own received him not they rejected him the Messiah he raised the dead he cast out devils heal a sick the church will reject him describe who could not agree with the Pharisees and the
