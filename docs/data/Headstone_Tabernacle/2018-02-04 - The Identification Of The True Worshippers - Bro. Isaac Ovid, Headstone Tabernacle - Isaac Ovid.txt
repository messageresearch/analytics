may you speak to us have you never done before we commit the service into your hands may you bless the reading of the word and the opening of our understanding to your scriptures father we wait on you this morning in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says and the church says Amen Eman if you have your Bibles and let it go straight to the scriptures reading from st. John st. John 4 and reading from verse 19 cynjohn for and reading from verse 19 and this is Jesus's encounter with the woman at the well and the woman saith unto him sir I perceive that thou art a prophet our fathers worshiped in this mountain and he say that in Jerusalem is the place where men or to worship jesus said unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when he shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father he worship he know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth the woman saith unto him I know that Messiah has come in which is called Christ when he has come he will tell us all things jesus said unto her i 'that speak unto thee am he and upon this came his disciples and marvel that he talked with the woman yet no man said what seekers dow or white oak is dow with her the woman had left her waterpot and went her way into the city and said to the man come see a man which told me all things that ever I did is not this the Christ my Lord and a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning and I certainly want to appreciate our pastor this morning I appreciate the pastor Burt oven I was saying to him it was such a blessing for the last almost two months he preached almost every single service and we really wanted to loot you a little bit for your vision for your burden and keeping the Messiahship straight a many men so I have a title this morning the identification of the true worshipers the identification of the true worshipers and we're going to explore that worship is that original currency in the economy of God come the church salmon and from a message looking for Jesus yes for a bag on but a Branham said well now we want to speak us every meeting about Jesus Christ he is the center of our worship the center of our attraction the center of our life all that we have and want are and will be based upon him I want to see that again all that we have and want ah and will be based upon him he was the one who came down and gave his life for us come down from glory how come from God out of glory and was made flesh dwelt among us and taken upon us upon him the sin of us all the sickness of us all boy are we it's a Calvary and they appear the price he's worthy of all praise that can be given to him can the church him and he's not worthy of some praise he's worthy of all the praise that we can give to him not some of the praise not 80% of your praise not not 90% of your praise he's he's worshiped he's worthy of all the praise he's he's worthy of all the praise and that's why this morning we bring a sacrifice of praising to the house of the Lord and what makes it a sacrifice and we gonna talk about it a little bit but way back before there was a moon there was a star before there was a problem before there was a sickness before there was two more tire but season before there was governments and politics and before there was physical currency God existed by himself he wasn't even called Corey yet because the definition of God you know what it is it's the object of worship but God existed alone he was called LLA elohim this self existing one there was there was nothing before him he was he was it he was the beginning the end he was the before he is the after he is eternity wrapped up in one he existed by himself and what for him to be God he had to have somebody to worship Him so God in his mind he began to play out a plan that he saw before he even spoke and when the Branham taught us he created an order of angels not all angels are created equal he created cherubims he created Sheriff hymns he created angels he created angels who stand by your house because the angel of the lord encamps around those who fear Him there are different classes and orders of angels is yes the angel of the Lord Himself yes Michael yes Gabriel are you with me this morning and these angels these cherubims these share of hymns all night long all day long in a context that we can understand you spend all their time holy holy holy is the Lord holy is the Lord the Lord is mighty the Lord is powerful all day long the Lord is holy he is worthy he is holy they don't stop worshiping the Lord is holy he is worthy he is worthy he created the heavens he created all mighty are you Laura that's the angels that's the song this thing he could never stop halleluyah halleluyah you may be seated but it was a problem because god although now he could be conquered because he had the worship there's also different qualities of worship the Angels worshiped but he couldn't worship from a place of pain because I didn't know what pain was he could never worship from a place of sacrifice because they could never understand what sacrifice was the Angels could not worship from a place of tiredness because the Angels never got tired you see tired worship that's a different flavor to God when you're tired and you still worship it's a difference free when you sit and you worship when you have no money and you worship the smelled of fragrance of that worship is different so caught he longed to have that quality of worship that would said that comes from your belly when you worship at all that's within you when all else is wrong and God begin to unfold this and but the Branham said that when God spoke and said let there be I could imagine all the angels that were there was standing there and brother Branham said specifically there was one angel of angels because the angels had different portfolios so Michael is the minister of defense Gabriel was the minister of communication so when if you need a message to go out here bro go carry a message when there's a war to be fought Michael we have a situation to take care of but there was another angel whose name was Lucifer and we gonna talk about him a little bit but the Branham said when he stood there he watched when God spoke and when he saw that something was in him that he desired that and he went to the north of heaven that's what the Bible says in the north of heaven and deceived many angels because he wanted to worship so the war for worship actually began before man was even on the earth there was a war for worship and that war has continued for all of these years it's a war of praise it's a war of worship and brother Branham it is very simple he said there are only two influences [Applause] and the devil understands is very simple for him if you're not worshipping calling us matter what he gives to you once it's not going to God gets that worship once it's not worship to God all else is worship for the devil come the church amen but we are not gonna let the devil take our worship not my worship not your worship not my time not your time you may be seated a set of young people look at any picture of Carnival people are hands in the air look at the picture of church and worship hands in the air people singing songs it's a replication of what took place back then because Lucifer was a worship leader calling the first worship leader so we understand worship so that war that started there is still going on today listen to the prophet we're getting somewhere God requires perfection we want to be a bat in mind that there is nothing just path we can go in the presence of God it must be perfect our worship everything so there is such a thing as perfect worship so we want to talk about before the beginning in the beginning and from the beginning because that's what the great war is about God as the object of worship and brother Branham said you could only defeat the enemy when you understand his tricks when you understand his tactics and I was saying that all through the Bible it's been a war about worship [Applause] this seemed devil we're talking about he goes by different names a serpent that's the deceiver that's a subtle one he goes by the devil that's the adversary goes by Seton as the accuser here's different forms in the dragon it's the same devil but in Eden he was there and he couldn't go at Adam because Adam had the world he knew durwood so he went to e because God had never spoken directly to Eve it was Adams job to let Eve know what God said but the devil the serpent the dragon whatever for me suppurating him went to her and say what did God say he's subtle in how he operates but what he's trying to get is to get you off the word because once you're off the word your worship cannot be received [Applause] that's why Jesus can see God is spirit and he that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth so true worship is too full it's in spirit you have to be in the spirit but it was also being truth that's why the Prophet had to come to bring truth because truth is a person jesus said I am the way I am the truth I am the life so the Prophet had to come to introduce mr. truth mister Jesus become oh you know hear me this morning this is why we know what we worship we don't worship a message we don't worship a prophet we worship the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ he alone these cells our worship oh my you may be seated bring back the old and Christian if I don't have voice to praise I'm gonna hit my under the chair if I lost my voice I'm not gonna let no rock I'll praise me I'm not gonna let the bench I'll praise me we will create a to worship we were born to worship true worship unlock your blessings come on now before the service is over we're gonna turn this place upside down the Deacons would have to move the chairs out because when you get a revelation that you were born to worship when you get a revelation that this is the season of the Jubilee and the devil has got to let you go Sumalee time too many time i hear sound of a trumpet ouap ouap ouap ouap ouap and you can go free if you want to go free you don't have to be in bondage listen hallelujah you may be seated friends heaven is not our jurisdiction heaven is not our jurisdiction you see this F this is our jurisdiction that's why the Bible said we shall reign on the earth our Authority is connected to heaven but our jurisdiction is here [Applause] the angels of darkness this is not their jurisdiction this is our jurisdiction so even in your weakest condition there is still more Authority and power that's why the Prophet can see in your little finger has more power than what the devil has because when it's your jurisdiction he may be seen it for a minute let me see that different way listen if it's your house is your house you could be tired it's your house you could have had a bad morning and forget your name is your host you could be stressed out it's still your host you can lose your leg and still your host you can be in a wheelchair it's still your house you don't even have to be able to speak there's a deed that says it's your house anybody can take the deed and say is his house and brother branham said the Holy Ghost is the enforcer of the claims of redemption based on your jurisdiction as a son of God as their a top of God can I get a praise in the house can I get a shout in the house so this body that you're in it's your jurisdiction the devil has got to take that cancer tumor diabetes high blood pressure up email condition this is not his jurisdiction this body is gonna be changed it's got to be changed for the rapture so before the rapture it's got to be heal to go into the rapture that's why the Prophet did say how can you have faithful rapture unless you are fit for divine healing it's coming our way it's coming our way home you may be seated let the worship us our eyes aren't any worshipers in the house and I said some time ago there's a difference between praise and worship read the Bible and the largest book in the Bible is the Book of Psalms the book of praise and wishing so much how much God loves worship when you see it even a man after my own cut David understood worship he understood praise he understood even you know I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I fear no evil because he understood that he was created to worship above all other callings worship establishes the relationship that he is your God that's the first principle upon which you can make requests let me say that again God is object of worship so the first principle of a request has to be the relationship with God because when you call upon him he wants to know is there relationship am i yogurt I can only act upon your situation if I am your body and maybe butter puff Wells gold but I haven't heard from you in a while to know that this thing is real to you so when you establish I am your God by giving me worship Nora can act on your behalf it in a way that to be called heresy [Applause] [Music] I don't know where we gonna go this morning but we having a time in the wooden range you see and the problem and many of us we never had a personal experience with God you may be seated it's impossible to really love and really express love until you in the relationship in that's a deep one I go in somewhere this morning before people get married and say I love you before marriage and they are tasty food yet really the sed was really upset yet so that statement of love still has to be tested because the situates because love is the action where it's easy to say that you love when you already have problems and the thing is people put their best foot forward before marriage but you when you're in the relationship or in the covenant as some would say it's when the love could really blossom because it now takes real love when the food didn't taste too good to say I love you that's when the love is tested and that's what we sing a song I love him because he first the love that we have for him could never be the love that he has for us it's because of his love for us in our situation when we reflect wait a minute me you know how messed up what I did he still loved me all of a sudden you start to understand what the meaning of love really is because he didn't have to do it what he did he didn't have to pick me up what he did and that's when it becomes a personal experience you may be seated I shared many young people talking about pizza if I may just from you in a few minutes when you read a Bible I believe it's Luke five where Jesus is on a mission his mission is to get Peters attention because Peter had not had a personal experience with God you could come to church and I'd have a personal experience with God he'd been the message and believed and still not have a personal experience with God people have an experience with the church all but I'm talking about experience with God and the Bible said Jesus was pressed he was pressed anyone to the share would and as he walked down by the seashore about him he saw to bow to see them acts permission he just walked into one of them I want you to see the background the Bible said the men were there washing their nets you know what washing Anitha mean you're packing up you're finished look it's early in the morning I said well and his men are washing their nets Jesus and that's permission and the Bible says he told Pizza pulled the boat off the shore and I said this was the first service that Peter was in that he didn't really want to be in because Peter was washing his nets to go back home and Jesus Paul Peter in a church service on a boat on Peters boat so Peter really couldn't go anyway Jesus is on Peters boat and he's preaching from Peters boat and Peter is tired because he has fish all night Peter is frustrated because he had caught nothing he had already washed his Nets which means he packed up he was ready to go home and he now finds himself there's a crowd of people there's Jesus and he already kind of leave because it's his boat Jesus on his boat and he really wants to go home the Bible said when Jesus finished preaching he turns to Peter and say cast your nets plural into the water now pizza is in a predicament we don't know how many people are still on the show we don't know what's going on around them but Peter now has a decision to make and Peter sad to say well Lord you know we we fished all night and we didn't catch anything but your wood now I wanna draw distinction and you can read it in time because the Bible makes very specific reference here Pizza it took a lot of faith for Peter to act because Peter was the authority so to speak on the subject he was the fisherman there was a reason they fish at night because at night you catch the fish in the daytime they see the nets so Jesus is challenging teachers position and his authority and say cast your nets plural now pizza already had an experience before the Bible says when you read from Luke 4 and you read Jesus first miracle everybody knew when Jesus turned water into wine that was everybody it was not Peter in the chapter before in Luke 4 the Bible says Jesus went to Peters mother-in-law who had a fever and healed a mother-in-law so Peter knew that this God was a God of healer but Peter didn't have a personal experience himself but he was still willing to try he didn't try all the way you know because Jesus said put the nets plural into the water the back said pizza said I will put down with net singular so I'm willing to give it a shot I'm willing to give it a try I'm willing to go one more time because / adventists something happens to me and the Bible says that when pizza are put down the net it was so much fish the net Bri and he call his partners and it was so much fish to put beginning to sang the partners board begin to sign but that whole story and script is not about the fish it's not even about the net it was God saying pizza I've come to give you a personal experience that you can follow me it was so much fish that when they got back to shore the Bible says Pizza left everything included any fish and began to follow Jesus Pizza where you going I don't know Pizza how you're gonna eat I can imagine mr. if he could take water until it in the wine if he could hear my mother-in-law and if he could get fish where there was no fish I'd have to worry about we are gonna eat and I'm seeing this money still to see me yesterday he's telling us entertained he's still the same forever [Applause] [Music] [Applause] blessed be the name of the Lord everybody feelin fine so we're top of worship this morning and by the brendham said listen you can make anything your God because God is the object of worship but a man cynical worship your house he gonna be a Keiko worship your business you can worship you go with me message remember the brand was here decide to the worship the Prophet and even baptized in his name and he left the fields because of that because you could worship anything but we don't want to spend time talking about that we want to talk about the true worship because when it becomes a true worship is no longer the minister telling you to worship worshiped is because of who he is not what he could do for you or did for you but it's because that He is God because he is Alpha and Omega because he's the beginning and the end because he created the heavens and the earth whether you have money or don't have money he is still worthy of worship and from your belly every day every moment worship is not just this worship is your time it's your effort it's your substance it's your meditation it's your song it's your attitude it's how you come to the house of God it's how you do your lunch it's how you do your dinner you are worship you are worshipers above all else what are you I'm a worshiper I'm a true worshiper by revelation come the church semen Oh hallelujah hallelujah so the devil Lucifer you wanted worship and for those of you who don't know the scripture in Isaiah 14 in verse 12 or how I doubt fallen from heaven o Lucifer son of the morning how I don't cut down to the ground which didst weaken the nation's but though I said in thine heart I will ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the Most High he had thou shall be brought down to hell to the size of the pit day that City shall narrowly look upon thee and consider leasing is this the man that I've made the earth to tremble that did shake kingdoms that's the resume of this Lucifer we're talking about listen to Ezekiel 28 verse 11 moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus and say unto Him dustier the Lord God those sealless up to some full of wisdom and perfect in beauty listen to the description though has been in Eden the garden of God every precious stone was like covering you see for beautiful the sorriest topaz and the diamond the burial the Onyx and the Jasper the Sapphire the emerald and the carbuncle and gold the workmanship of die Tabrez enough that pipes was prepared in the in the day that door was created you see this adversary dealing with you see why the devil could create everything so attractive to pull your attention he was created in beauty listen to the description don't add the anointed cherub that covereth and I have set this soul though was upon the holy mountain of though has walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire you see what how he could be spiritual though was perfect in thy ways from the day that door was created till iniquity was found in thee by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence and thou has sinned therefore I will pass the as profane out of the mountain of God and I will destroy thee or covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire then how it was lifted up because of thy beauty that was corrupted thy wisdom by reason of their brightness I will cast it to the ground I will ad before kings and they may be holding thou hast defied like sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities by the iniquity of thy traffic therefore will I bring for a fire from the midst of thee it shall devour thee and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that beholding all their that know the among the people shall be astonished at thee thou shalt be a terror and never shalt thou be anymore so the devil he knows this he knows that he is running out of time he knows that is a time limit can the church say Amen but the true worshipers because the devil has coveted so much worship when you read a book of Revelation about all that dwell on the earth will worship the Beast except those names that are written so you have to know where you're standing this morning and why true worship King lamb worship is so important to differentiate yourself from those that worship the Beast can the church say man now but the man I'm in the fourth seal now as oil symbolize the Holy Spirit then we founded oil and wine is connected in worship and the wine I said which come to me the wine symbolizes that it was the power of stimulation of Rabbi revelation that's when something has been revealed it gives stimulation to the believer because it's by revelation see it's summoner court has said it's a mystery they can't understand it see and after a while God comes down and reveals it and then vindicate sent you in Revelation fire this morning the worship chapter the true worship is wine and oil together and I sent you this morning like job where was Tom when I lay the foundation of the world declare if thou has understanding it has to be real to you and you have to shed everything that keeps you from true worship and the church amen [Applause] you may be seated so we're back in Genesis after man fell keen and evil he came to bring their worship and they both worshiped they worshiped by one by revelation and the other by intellect they both understood at the sacrifice was required but Abel by revelation recognized that the blood had to be shed Cain brought the best of what he had he brought his fruits he brought his own interpretation and no other incredible things God said take in if you do like your brother you will actually get the same lesson but it was nothing his heart this thing has got to be in your heart it's got to be real to you this message has got to be inside of you not just I'm gonna tell you I believe the problem is got to be in your heart so that bottle of worship started all the way back there and it plays a true scripture Keane had his worship even had his worship but only one was accepted it's in man's nature to worship so you go along to Scripture Nimrod what did he do he built a tower because you want to go up to worship number the random said come down and live like a devil because he know he has to worship and listen they were so focused and so United that God had to confound them because when a people are united there's almost nothing could stop them so God had to actually stop them and as you go to scripture when the churn of his away in bondage what did God tell Moses when you come out of Egypt bring my people to this mountain so they could do what you see how important worship is to God and you see how everywhere God is looking for his worship the devil always try to find himself in there somewhere hmm so I'm seeing this morning before you possess your inheritance you have to do what I know that every place and you know every place that you put your foot is yours but before you can even walk you're supposed to do what before the walls of Jericho can even come down the people have to do what so this battle has been raging you know when you worship you the angels are being dispatched in your favor because he inhabits the praises of his people when you worship Him the whole walls begin to shake your situations begin to shake the devil can't even move you come on now [Applause] Oh hallelujah let's set P the name of the Lord I want to read a few scriptures for you that's okay I just want an earless down from your Testament as well reading from Exodus chapter 3 I just want to show you how many times Moses in his ministry was talking about worship in Exodus 3 and verse 12 and he said certainly I will be where this is God speaking to Moses and this shall be a token unto thee that I have sembly when thou has brought forth the people out of Egypt he shall serve God and that means worship God upon this mountain so the instruction of bringing the people out still didn't talk fully about a promise when God spoke to Moses it was about worship when you bring them out bring them to this mountain to worship by the time we read Exodus chapter 4 and verse 23 and I see Anthony let my son go that he may serve me or worship me and if thou refuse to let him go behold I will slay thy son even thy firstborn son Exodus 431 and the people believed and when they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel and he had looked upon the affliction they bowed their heads and worshiped Exodus 7 and verse 16 and thou shalt say unto him talking to fear o the Lord God of the Hebrews has set me on to be seeing let my people go that they may serve or worship me in the wilderness and behold Tara to dawood is not here so Moses is coming to Pharaoh not Jesse let my people go to let my people go so they could worship can the church say Amen Exodus 8:1 and the Lord speak unto Moses go unto Pharaoh and see unto him does hear the Lord let my people go that he may worship me God is waiting few to comment upon ditch the cry is coming to Egypt you can worship come on to your situation so you could worship Exodus 8 and verse 20 and the Lord said unto Moses rise up early in the morning and stand before fear o law he command for to the water and sea unto him does fear the Lord let my people go that demon worship me it wasn't once Moses spoke to Pharaoh it was over and over and over again God is saying this is my people and they were born to worship me let them go release them release them from their bondage release them from their chains release them from their sickness release them from their situation because they were born to worship in your bondage it's hard to worship but Pharaoh house of hell give way to the name of Jesus because you are gonna worship [Applause] can the church team in exodus 9 and verse 1 then the Lord said unto Moses it's over and over you know in other words you know we talked about Noah preached it well Rena it will ring it will ring most of that a similar message influenced 9 then the Lord said to Moses go in out of here oh I tell him to see the Lord God of the Hebrews let my people go that Timmy worship me is the same message Moses had one message not just let my people go but let my people go so that they could worship me later on in that same chapter Exodus 9 and verse 13 let's go and the Lord said unto Moses rise up early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh in other words do it how much ever times you need to do it I'm ready yesterday I made every day before but we are not staying in bondage lose them let them call so that they can worship me [Applause] Exodus 9 and verse 13 and the Lord said unto Moses rise up early in the morning don't wake up late in the morning Moses get up early in the morning make it your first order of business to let the devil know that he is glad to let you go and there's a reason for letting you go it's not just you to be free but it's free to worship free to shout free to adore free to lift him up lift him higher and the church demon and the Lord said unto Moses rise up early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh and say unto Him plus here the Lord God of the Hebrews let my people go that they may worship me I ready for some more listen this is an encouragement to you because all the time that Moses is doing this God is releasing a plague he's releasing judgment every time Moses says that it's a plague follows it I don't think you get away I'm going here it's a frogs it's the Flies it's the locusts what is going to him he's attacking the system he's attacking the kingdom he's attacking the Empire he's attacking those bands of bondage that was hauling them God knew that it wasn't gonna be one statement who's gonna let Pharaoh let go [Applause] it wasn't gonna take one encounter for fira to let them go so God said I'm gonna knock I'm gonna knock I'm gonna knock I'm gonna knock I'm gonna strike I'm gonna strike frogs sighs look us I'm not gonna stop because my people will be free to worship Me they're not gonna be dead they're not gonna be in bondage for 400 years stepping tied up in bondage but let my people go [Applause] my listen we reach Exodus 10 are you with me ratty anointed Exodus 10 and verse 3 no before this time it was Moses coming alone Moses is by himself but by Exodus 10 verse 3 and Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh Moses brought back up most have been gone all along and seemed a godsend but this time he brought Aaron this time he brought his brother this time he brought another soldier in case you thought it was me alone speaking for these people I've got other men with me but we are not giving up we're not disappearing we're not going back into the wilderness we are not going back to slavery Sumalee oh you may be seated I can imagine listen the two neighbors are watching this whole team play out Moses green by himself hero let my people go so they can worship Moses met once twice and Moses and Aaron are coming the most years and ever before because the time is at hand your daughter has got to go free your son has got to go free we'll call the elders will call the Deacons appeal talk or you know hear me this morning you may be seen as he listened to Moses and Aaron and Moses and Aaron's came into Pharaoh and said unto him does see the Lord God of the Hebrews how long will no refuse to humble myself before me let my people go that they will worship me I wonder how Pharaoh felt here's these two men they don't have no army they don't have no weapons they don't have no kind of great position and now it was Moses they speak in confusion but not Aaron coming how long will you not humble yourself this is same Lucifer who exalted himself but the Branham said it was the same Lucy but operating through all these kingdoms and to all these kings so it wasn't fear of the man that they were speaking to it was that's for Lucifer the king of Tyre the king of Babylon the king of Persia the king of a room it was that spirit and this is a problem with many of us we don't attack the devil enough but the Brennan said when the devil says boo you ought to do what every one of those scriptures most is weak and of God waking up in the morning say let get up early be the Iron Man at heart but ladies deep-ass were telling the devil we got to go free that demon of lust can't even a fool occasion that demon of lying that T whatever it is tell that devil you have got to let me go you're not gonna take my worship no more you've ever seen it now were the Stephen when you of that persistent the devil begins to get frustrated can be frustrated that with this woman can we frustrate the devil this morning fear didn't let him go willingly you know he let them go frustrated he was fed up he was fed up he had them locked up and he wasn't fed up listen exodus ten number seven and pharaoh's servants said unto him no this is Pharaoh's advisors speaking him how long shall this man be a snare unto us let the men go that they may serve the Lord their God know is doubt not yet that Egypt is destroyed so those men tell Pharaoh Pharaoh has will give up let a man go let these men go on worship whatever God that they are talking about PSEG falling apart listen to the next verse and Moses and Aaron who were brought again at the Pharaoh now this is not them going out they were being brought now interfere because the men are on Pharaoh recognize that too much is happening after plea attack after attack they couldn't understand they had never seen this kind of attack before can the church say man and Moses and Aaron were brought again on the Pharaoh and he said unto them go serve the Lord your God I mean I said but who are they that shall cool and Moses said we will go to a younger with our all with our sons and with our daughters with our flocks with our herds will be go for we must hold a feast unto the Lord and he said unto them let the Lord be with you as I will let you go and your little ones look to it for evil is before you and he said to them let the law verse 11 not so go now he that our men and serve the Lord in other words he asked in Moses who would not go and Moses read out everybody go in and Pharaoh say no no no no no not everybody not so go now here a time in so he said here's what only take me men and go I keep any children I keep any animals this was his first position first position not so good now here at a men and serve the Lord for that he desire and they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence I want you to see the great drama you know we told Moses but this is now going to the scriptures now so they bring Moses in france' listen who we want to go Moses a one-man woman teacher any animals you say here's what just take the men and go I'll get out get out drag them all the presents and the Lord said unto Moses in case Adela understand that I want everybody he said stretch out and hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts that may come upon the land of Egypt man eat every hope of the land and even all that he'll had left and Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt and the Lord brought is wind upon the land altar deal and all that night and when it was morning the east wind brought the locusts and the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt and still in all the course of Egypt very grievious worthy before them there were no such Lukas neither after them shall be such so for that operation concreted Lucas that there never was before or after these will look as an assignment to drive the point home to the devil that he has got to let [Applause] now listen listen listen II backlit when you read down and owner you love it but we could all to verse 24 so after this locus in vision they get summoned again in front of Pharaoh and Pharisee okay here's what I'm very : the most I say GUI serve the Lord only let your flocks and your herds be steed take all the humans leave all the animals with me beastie let your little ones go with you listen to Moses don't must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings that we may sacrificed under the Lord our God our cattle also shall go with us there shall not be a hoof be left behind listen listen to Moses listen why listen listen why he fightin listen to what the issue is put the era of meaning from out of these animals for there've must we take to serve the Lord our God and listen and we know not what we must serve the Lord with until we come thither so in other words we take in all the animals because we don't know what we need to offer so we want to have everything so when he says offer we have everything we're taking our children we're taking our young ones we're taking everything [Applause] daddy template came dr. Schrag the Phyllis born and then it's a fear of the city everything take your cattle take everything just go just go and listen right now you fighting the enemy but there's a power coming into the church that is no coming in the Prophet spoke about it when you speak the word and it'll be created just like we haven't seen not yet wanna wait I'll tell those seven thunders after their voices to talk to who could take the wooden handle [Applause] Oh hallelujah you may be seated that's how much God wants your worship how much he wants your deliverance how much he wants you to be free from your past free from your failures free from your mistakes free from your condemnation the two rivers were crying by reason of their taskmasters the taskmasters were giving them tasks that they were forced to do that they did not want to do and in this flesh we were born into sin and shaved in iniquity and we found ourselves doing tasks that we did not want to do our very nature was against God and the taskmaster it's what led to you lyin and led to you stealing and led to you too many all kinda evil but but God said one day I'm gonna happen a great deliverance we know great deliverance and what I love about God when God doesn't work he does a complete work so when the turn of his I walked out of Egypt God hardened Pharaoh's heart and ferrocene now I gave up too easy after all that he went through he said you have to easy and he called his army to pursue them and the tune of Israel was singing and shouting and jumping and praising and worshiping because they had been in bondage for 400 years you know what it is to be in bondage for so long you know what is it be sick for years and all of a sudden that sickness gets removed you gonna sit in church normal all your life is struggling with identity crisis all your life is struggling with this and is struggling with that and then all of a sudden not to anything that you did because God send the deliverer and you get an instructor you could put down your fork he could put down your hole he could put down his cigarettes he could put down the alcohol he could walk away from that woman you can walk away from that man you can walk away from that job the taskmaster cannot hold you anymore you can walk away from the music you can walk away from pornography you can walk away no more pass master [Applause] no more taskmaster freedom freedom free to worship and the devil you maybe she didn't understand his limits Alberto wait preacher last week he's had to push you teacher named Ezra and I tell her over dramatize it last week Moses was this follow the spirit he gonna cause her to cry and God say listen speak and move on why you crying how much miracles you need to see to know if I bring you out from the hand of Egypt you don't think I will finish this thing and then Moses recognized his jurisdiction he recognizes Authority and he spoke it wasn't God put words in his mouth oh no it was you speak your son you have the jurisdiction you have the authority is your house is your family is your people speak speak and move forward and Moses said stand still don't rile up yourself stand still stop the complainin stand still don't fidget don't get excited just stand still and see the salvation of God not just salvation but the Egyptians you see today you will see them no more forever [Applause] you may be seated and that there was a type of Lucifer being destroyed forever it's coming his time is up we are eternal he is not he has a time limit you have no timeline because you come from eternity and it went back to eternity turning on this earth that's why robits has so many times the devil cannot get stronger but you could get stronger glory to God how are we doing amen so we told him it about worship the issue between Daniel and the king of Babylon the issue was worship those men had a problem with Daniel he was just different so they convinced the King about the Lord at know praying and this is another day and Daniel didn't let it move him Daniel still prayed it was not a natural issue these were politicians making it a spiritual issue to show how the devil operates through politics the issue was worship but Daniel didn't let that stop him he prayed anyhow [Music] and it's true Daniel in the lion's den and by the battle dramatized it he said when the lion saw Daniel he recognized that same fire was all over Daniel the same anointing was all over Tantalus him power and the lion didn't touch Daniel [Music] at that same time the Hebrew boys at their knowledge and the King is so blown away with Daniel and his good that he creates an arrow but the Brenham says that Idol was in an image of Daniel so understand this is brother Daniel we talk emotional to show you how the devil wants a pull away worship from God he takes a man of God and makes the idol of a man of God and requested the people who worship because it says a look at the testimony this man was put in the lion's den and his God delivered him bow down to this Idol the Hebrew boys could have said that's brother Daniel we serve the same God they could have said all of that but they knew that their God is not an idol it's not an image it's the court in heaven and they say we will not bow down to no image to no teaching - no idea - no interpretation and they say we will truly in the fiery furnace they had a choice there's always a choice they're gonna say ok ok ok ok here's one here's one here's where we will bow down you won't have a choice with what you worship and they were born enough to say our God will deliver us but even if he doesn't deliver us we will still not bow down God give us men and women like that [Applause] we know what we worship I was doing some studies of history Roman history and around the time of Jesus you know how they figure out who the Christians were in our day we say good morning that's a greeting and people well she's supposed to respond you know we live in a world people are just like there's no morning there's no greeting let's walk past your streets years ago normal people say good morning good morning like doing normal people no we do have normal people but in those days but a kind of a the greeting was Caesar is king and you were required to respond and the king a caesar so when you walk in the street caesar is king and the king is caesar caesar is king and the king is caesar but the followers of jesus could never give that response caesar's king and the king is jesus and [Applause] as easy as that they would say lions then chop his head off so i was listening to somebody to speak on this and he was saying it was very easy you had a choice because only this is andy king a caesar and your life was spared but if you are real believer and you recognize that he is your king you couldn't acknowledge and the king a caesar who is isa jesus is the King of Kings the Lord of lords if you chop my head off my foot off put made-up flat of oil or crucify me or even in a lion it doesn't change the fact to me that Jesus is the king you can't boil it out of me you can't convince it out of me you can't take it out of me he is my king he is my lord he is my Savior he's my Redeemer [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you still talking about worship and I want to strike something with a young people interview the issue with Mordecai and Amon was worship because when Haman is walking the people was a bow down bowing is reverence bow down and worship it's a part of that level of respect that comes a certain way and in that day everybody was bowing down to him and except Mordecai only one man and he a man got so upset but one man imagined by the Georgie war community by now and it's one man you don't if it is back I don't know him and say founded if is his back with him please because everybody suppose abomino and he was so troubled but Mordecai was the only man it seemed who had a revelation I'm not bowing down to this man I'm not doing it and that one man caused Hindman to go and tell the King to write a law to kill all the Jews because he coveted that one man's worship that one man's respect if Mordecai had ball down there would be no persecution if Mordecai had ball down Esther would not have been challenged to have received the words for such a time as this but because Mordecai rejected the opportunity to subject himself to him and it unfolded a journey for the Jews I asked young people some time ago what is worship people live their hands and but what is really what what what is worship because worship speaks to a number of things it's your time the people who lift their hands faithfully and they give God no time they don't pray they don't sing you see with in church and they hardly singing but catch them on the street now they know all these songs for all kinds of other stuff but instead it's what you reverence worship is what you respect can the church say Amen with a Branham in his days when he was here there was a man who was beating up preachers and when they came into the service where the Prophet was and the Prophet was not a big man as you know and all the ministers fled from the platform to form a not a barricade they just fled and a man is walking up and as the man is coming but a Branham says he will fall over my feet in the rain and as the man is coming to brother Branham he falls over the prophets feet and they call the police and when the police come they say person will this man be all right whatever the random person he said no he'll not be all right because he worships the spirit that's upon him so any worship the spirit as upon you you cannot even be set free that's why you have to understand what you worship and the danger today with this issue of worship and you could say it's for the young people but the devil has found these subtle ways to get into everything most importantly our time whether it's Facebook whether it's news whether it's whatever it is it could be for the best of intentions but anything that takes your time away from God that's what you worship in people spend more time on Facebook in a day than they pray in a week statistics say that the average time people spend on social media in a day is over two hours I wouldn't ask how many of you prayed for two hours per day this week but what kind of church would we have if you spend that same time crying for revival because the Prophet said the minister could never bring the revival it takes the people to call for it so even though the children of Israel had a promise upon them that they were going to be delivered it was only when they began to cry it activated the promise that's why God could say I have heard the cries of my people and I've come down to deliver he can never harm the promise but what ignited the activation of the promise was when he heard the cries of my people when last have you cried when last of you side when last have you put down the funder put on the Facebook put down when the Prophet was he says shoot the TV the devil heard that he brought the TV on iPads on phones and devices and make it happy to shoot Giavanna and the devil will try everything to get your worship to take your time to take your energy to take your resources take your joy zaps you with negative news and this and that to keep you away when you have to be practicing the presence of God it should be in our daily walk it should be not really talking about daily living part of your struggle part of my struggle part of our struggle is when we make something else or God that's not the most high good and many times it's not deliberate you know I have to work late I working an extra I'm doing this I have to do this I have to do this and half and when you look 3d Espace and you had talked to God yet spent no time to acknowledge how he is first in your life first in your marriage first in your job first in your relationship he's the reason you woke up this morning we get so busy because the devil knows how to operate he knows how to take your time up but when you're in traffic you could praise him when you're near lunchtime you could praise him when you're walking it ought to be worship can the church say Amen it was only listen when the children of Israel worshiped for God's that I ended up into captivity no wonder caught the same Exodus 20 verse 2 I am THE LORD thy God which had brought thee out of the land of Egypt out of the house of bondage thou shall have no other gods before me don't start that make unto thee any graven image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under it thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God can the church see man oh the wise men came to worship the four beasts and the twenty-four elders came to worship worship is your way of letting God know he is your God even before you pray you ought to worship that's why even when Jesus talked about the prayer he said our Father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done he didn't even ask for anything yet it was worship that's how real it must be to us Oh hallelujah no one that Jesus let say in viña do they worship me it just cannot be a ritual to you it cannot be a practice to you this must be a reality to you can the church say man first chronicles 16 and verse 23 sing unto the Lord all you so forth from deity his salvation declare his glory among the heathen his marvelous works among all nations for great is the Lord and greatly to be praised he also is to be feared above all gods for all the gods of the people are idols but the Lord he made the heavens glory and honor are in his presence

beep oh that day is coming where every knee will bow and every tongue will confess er the Prophet came to introduce in lamb worship the Prophet came to introduce of our attentive writer knowing fully well that there be a people in the land who a messenger would be the final voice up to the final church age this would not be a ritual to them but we will worship in spirit and in truth [Applause] Oh hallelujah hallelujah let cauterize let his enemies be scattered let cauterize let his enemies be scattered friends begin to annoying the promises begin to worship it was worship that took them into the upper room ah it was worship that created the environment that create a atmosphere that the Holy Ghost could drop down when you are looking for God to do something for you get into an atmosphere like Mary appeared unto me according that I would you think it takes a atmosphere of worship it takes an anointing of worship it takes a spirit of Prayer it is a attitude of worship hallelujah I'm not done yet I'm not done yet we're gonna have a breakthrough we're gonna break pass ourselves we're gonna break pass a sound barrier that's what the Prophet spoke about he said when you cut to that speeder the whole things begin to shake until you break past the sound barrier he said when you break passes sin barrier when you break past the toll barrier when you break past the fear barrier when you break past the barrier then all things are possible all things are possible we don't shout enough we don't pray enough we don't worship enough we don't sigh enough we don't cry enough all that you have need of you could access this morning if you're in the atmosphere all that you have need of if you get in five minutes the Prophet said you get in one minor and one Accord in the upper room they were in one minor and they were in wanna call worshiping God for the promise that he gave to them you know the promise he shall receive power after the Holy Ghost comes upon you that is your promise you shall be healer that is your promise you shall be perfected that is your promise you shall be adopted that is your promise you shall receive charity that is your promises lead with you knowledge
