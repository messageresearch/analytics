[31:59] towards the north and every man a
[32:01] slaughter weapon in his hand and one man
[32:03] among them
[32:04] was clewed with linen with the writer's

[32:11] the brazen altar the glory
[32:13] of the god of israel was going on from
[32:15] the cherub whereupon he was to the
[32:17] threshold of the house and he called to

[32:20] clothed with linen which had the
[32:22] righteous income by his side and the
[32:24] lord said unto him go
[32:26] through the midst of the city through
[32:28] the midst of jerusalem and set a mark
[32:30] upon the foreheads of the men that sigh
[32:33] and that cry for all the abominations
[32:36] that be then done in the midst thereof

[33:09] reported the matter
[33:10] seeing i have done as god has
[33:13] commanded me
[33:15] so in john chapter 14
[33:17] verse 15 if you love me keep my
[33:19] commandments and i will pray the father
[33:22] he'll give you another comforter that he
[33:23] may abide with you forever even the
[33:25] spirit of truth whom the world
[33:27] cannot receive because
[33:29] it sees him not need to know him but you
[33:31] know him for he dwelleth with you and
[33:34] shall be in you i will not leave you
[33:36] comfortless i will come to you yet a
[33:39] little while and the world sees me no
[33:40] more but you see me because i live
[33:44] you shall live also and that day you
[33:45] shall know that i am in my father and
[33:48] you and me
[33:49] and i knew he that had my commandments
[33:52] and keepeth them he it is that love at
[33:54] me and he that loveth me shall be loved
[33:57] of my father and i would love him
[34:00] i will manifest
[34:02] myself to him in revelation chapter 7
[34:05] in verse 1 and after these things i saw
[34:07] four angels standing
[34:08] on the four corners of the earth hole in
[34:10] the four winds of the earth that the
[34:12] wind should not blow on the earth no on
[34:14] the sea nor any tree
[34:16] and i saw another angel
[34:18] ascending from the east having the seal
[34:20] of the living god and he cried with a
[34:22] loud voice to the four angels to whom it
[34:25] was given to her the earth and the sea
[34:27] saying hurt not the earth neither the
[34:30] sea nor the trees till we have sealed
[34:33] the servants of our god and their
[34:35] foreheads
[34:36] and i heard a number of them which were
[34:37] sealed
[34:38] and they were sealed 144 000
[34:42] of all the tribes of the children of
[34:43] israel father god we pray that you would
[34:45] bless this word interpret our hearts in
[34:47] jesus name i ask it amen you may be
[34:49] seated
[34:52] wow
[34:54] uh
[34:59] i've tried this morning the ceiling
[35:02] angel
[35:04] was a title this morning
[35:06] the ceiling angel
[35:10] and uh
[35:11] if you note
[35:13] that the scripture
[35:15] that we read in ezekiel 9
[35:17] where god started to begin
[35:19] he said begin
[35:21] at my sanctuary
[35:23] begin at my sanctuary
[35:26] is not something
[35:28] and to think
[35:29] that the scripture
[35:31] speak about
[35:32] uh
[35:34] the
[35:34] the the the lord voice saying caused him
[35:37] to have charged over the city to draw
[35:38] near every man with his destroying
[35:41] weapon in his hand
[35:42] but before they hit the city
[35:45] it hit the sanctuary hit the church
[35:48] it's not something
[35:49] i wonder if people
[35:51] have considered that
[35:54] first peter 4 17 18 says for the time
[35:57] has come
[35:58] that judgment must begin at the house of
[36:01] god
[36:02] and if it be first begin with at us
[36:05] what shall the end be of them
[36:07] that will be not the gospel of god
[36:11] and if the righteous
[36:13] scarcely be saved
[36:15] where shall the ungodly and the sinner
[36:18] appear
[36:19] so this is something worth noting that
[36:22] there was is come a time the judgment
[36:25] and the bible will use this term must
[36:28] begin
[36:29] at the house of god
[36:31] that is before the city before
[36:33] instructions before other places you see
[36:37] so
[36:38] i know uh people may be concerned about
[36:40] the mark of the beast and the council of
[36:42] churches and the churches closing down
[36:44] but that is not the emphasis this
[36:46] morning
[36:48] uh we want to look at this a ceiling
[36:49] angel this
[36:51] silly ninja because destruction is on
[36:53] its way and
[36:55] and it's troubling
[36:57] to see people have a casual attitude
[36:59] about god
[37:01] a casual attitude about a message
[37:04] a casual attitude about god's wrath very
[37:08] casual
[37:09] you know you come like you see preachers
[37:11] and
[37:12] and people speak in the word without
[37:14] fear of god
[37:15] they see what they want to see
[37:17] how they want to see it
[37:19] as if they don't understand that we are
[37:22] all in the palm of his hands and
[37:25] if he
[37:26] move his hands then we all
[37:28] would fall
[37:30] and god already spoke that that terrible
[37:32] is coming
[37:33] and he talked about behold
[37:35] i send you elijah the prophet before and
[37:37] great
[37:38] and terrible day of the lord and we find
[37:40] out that elias has already come and god
[37:43] sent elijah the prophet
[37:45] in this last day for us to escape
[37:47] to become
[37:48] the escape ones
[37:50] isn't that right and ezekiel
[37:53] the slaughtering angel was
[37:55] not not mercy angels the bible called
[37:58] them
[37:59] the slaughtering angels and if
[38:01] you have not listened to that bible
[38:03] study the story of jehu you should
[38:04] listen to it
[38:06] because it describes
[38:08] when the anointing of judgment
[38:10] is upon a man or upon a city upon a
[38:13] world
[38:14] nothing stops it
[38:16] it's it's cruel it's it's destructive
[38:19] it's nothing stopping it
[38:21] and this scripture we read it says slay
[38:23] utterly male female
[38:26] young old
[38:28] little children
[38:29] have no pity
[38:31] but come not near
[38:33] those with that mark
[38:36] hallelujah
[38:37] so when that time breaks
[38:39] when the announcement when it is
[38:41] announced
[38:43] then the question is that who is your
[38:45] pastor the question is not where you go
[38:47] to church
[38:48] the question is not how long in the
[38:50] message
[38:51] the question is not how much knowledge
[38:53] you have
[38:54] the question is not how much mysteries
[38:56] that you have or how much revelation of
[38:58] mysteries that they have the question
[38:59] becomes do you have the mark
[39:02] not a mac
[39:04] but d mark the mark that god expect and
[39:07] god require
[39:08] the seal of god
[39:11] hallelujah
[39:12] praise the name of the lord they have to
[39:15] have
[39:16] a seal in time
[39:17] because that angel from the east we read
[39:20] read about that angel of power and
[39:22] authority to tell the other four angels
[39:25] that are already in position they ain't
[39:28] coming you know they're already in
[39:30] position they've taken instructions from
[39:33] the angel from the east say hurt not the
[39:35] sea
[39:36] hurt not the earth don't hurt anything
[39:38] until
[39:40] hallelujah the jews be sealed this
[39:43] seated angel this angel from the east
[39:46] have a commission to make sure that 144
[39:51] 000 elected jews are sealed but before
[39:54] they are sealed there's elected bride to
[39:57] be sealed it's one seal it's the seal of
[40:00] god oh hallelujah is one holy ghost
[40:03] baptism even as there's one lord even as
[40:06] there's one fate oh hallelujah praise
[40:09] god so the sealing angel has the power
[40:11] and authority to speak and instruct the
[40:14] angels of destruction that is already on
[40:17] the earth hallelujah that is already on
[40:20] the earth in position
[40:23] oh hallelujah
[40:26] when you talk about that destruction
[40:28] isaiah 13
[40:30] 16 11 talk about holy for the day of the
[40:33] lord is at hand it shall come as a
[40:34] destruction from the almighty
[40:38] therefore shall all hands be faint
[40:41] and every man's heart shall melt
[40:44] and they shall be afraid pangs and souls
[40:46] shall take a hold of them they shall be
[40:48] as pain as a woman in travail they shall
[40:51] be amazed one at another their faces
[40:53] shall be as flames behold the day of the
[40:56] lord cometh cruel both with rat and
[40:59] fierce anger to lead the land desolate
[41:01] he shall destroy the sinners thereof out
[41:04] of it for the stars of the heaven and
[41:06] this constellations thereof shall not
[41:08] give their light the sun shall be
[41:10] darkened it is going forth on the moon
[41:12] shall not cause the light to shine and i
[41:14] will punish the world for the evil
[41:17] and the wicked for the iniquity and i
[41:20] will cause the arrogancy of the power to
[41:22] cease and will lay low the haughtiness
[41:25] of the terrible
[41:26] o glory to god
[41:28] this angel of god
[41:30] hallelujah
[41:32] i hear the prophet says
[41:34] to see whether this message that we got
[41:37] is connected with it or not
[41:39] the very hour that israel was signed to
[41:42] be a nation the very hour
[41:45] the very hour that israel was signed to
[41:47] be a nation it was the very same hour
[41:50] the very same day the very same month
[41:53] everything else i was at greenville
[41:54] indiana when the angel appeared to me
[41:58] and sent me out on the field with this
[42:00] after he met me down in the river and

[42:04] commissioned me 11 years later at the
[42:06] same hour that israel was signing the
[42:08] nation

[46:37] supernatural power that really lays
[46:39] dormant in the church
[46:41] what the great supernatural power that
[46:44] lays dormant in the church you really

[47:32] she had no she had started move out of
[47:34] sodom but the heart
[47:36] is what kept her there and make her turn
[47:38] back and turn into pillars so but
[47:40] abraham but sarah was different she was
[47:43] up there with her husband she was called
[47:45] out and sealed away by a promise that
[47:47] she was going to have a visitation from
[47:49] a son that was coming all glory for our
[47:51] son that was coming sarah was different
[47:54] she was with her husband

[48:01] tell syria what god promised promise us
[48:04] a son abram can make no child have to
[48:06] come to syria so he have to prophesy for
[48:09] himself and prophesy for his woman
[48:11] prophesy for his wife and he had to
[48:13] believe god for her and really go for
[48:15] himself he couldn't divorce sarah he
[48:17] couldn't put on sarah the house you have
[48:19] to stay right there because god tell him
[48:21] to sarah you're going to have this son
[48:23] or give the lord a shout and this
[48:25] morning and he said i will return unto d
[48:28] and before the prophet left he gave us a

[48:51] what i'm called to do oh hallelujah not

[49:01] partaker of his divine nature oh give
[49:03] the lord some praises hallelujah and so
[49:06] sarah type church today called out
[49:08] hallelujah letting the world do anything

[49:28] what's going to happen next every day is
[49:30] uncertain it's a certain uncertain song
[49:32] every single day but when we hear the
[49:35] scripture when we hear these promises
[49:37] it's a certain song oh glory to god i
[49:40] will return unto thee according to the
[49:42] time of life john didn't make no mistake
[49:45] he said i saw an angel arise from the
[49:47] east having the sea of the living god
[49:50] not no fightful not no pastor not no
[49:53] bishop it was an angel it was the seal
[49:55] of angel that angel is here to seal you
[49:58] into the kingdom of god or give the lord
[50:01] a shout i trust you feel the anointing
[50:03] where you are that's how we are feelings
[50:05] inside of here oh glory to god
[50:07] hallelujah so sarah she was keeping her
[50:10] mind
[50:11] on the promise
[50:13] oh god
[50:14] help me jesus
[50:17] back in the old testament there was a
[50:19] year called the jubilee it was the year
[50:21] that all the captive scopes be set free
[50:24] every man that had been in captivity
[50:25] could go free it must have been a great
[50:27] meaning to this day or what is stood for
[50:30] in time
[50:31] oh hallelujah many hundred years has
[50:33] passed god have sent the jubilee in them
[50:35] days is the same god who sends jubilee
[50:37] today
[50:38] all the people have been captured so are
[50:40] you in captivity this morning you could
[50:42] go free some pastor kept you some church
[50:45] creed are you born praise god because
[50:47] you made a long dress you figure you're
[50:49] in the kingdom of god because you have a
[50:50] long dress and you have a book and you
[50:52] believe a prophet that is a lie you know
[50:54] hallelujah you better get the holy ghost
[50:56] he said mary the reason mary had was to
[50:59] go in the upper room to get the holy
[51:00] ghost is because mary was born a mortal
[51:03] and she had to be born again to go up
[51:04] into heaven so mary didn't have a bligh
[51:07] or her excuse because i said be it done
[51:10] unto me according to that word and that
[51:12] makes you eliminate or excuse her from
[51:14] the upper room she had to go and style
[51:15] with them like the rest of them she had
[51:17] to die out like the rest of them she had
[51:19] to fall along like the rest of them she
[51:21] had to scream like the rest of them try
[51:23] to get pack out like the rest of them
[51:24] and so would you oh give the lord some
[51:27] praises hallelujah chica came to be
[51:29] mother of god and mother jesus she still
[51:31] had to hit the upper room we'll give the
[51:33] lord some praises if god is pear mary
[51:35] god is sparing you sitting on with your
[51:37] longest and your church hallelujah glory
[51:40] to god amen
[51:42] thank you lord
[51:44] all the ones that were in captivity
[51:46] didn't have to pay any price
[51:48] they could absolutely go free
[51:50] they could drop their whole if they were
[51:52] going whatever they were instrument they
[51:54] were working with and they could go and
[51:56] be free
[51:57] that was by choice
[51:59] if they did not want to go free then
[52:01] they would call to the temple and their
[52:04] master would bore their air
[52:06] and they would have to save this master
[52:08] forever
[52:09] then this person that did not want to go
[52:12] free had to be sealed
[52:14] aha
[52:16] if you don't want to get go free you're
[52:17] going to get sealed here
[52:19] you'll be sealed out
[52:22] a beautiful type of the day of the seal
[52:24] of god or the marking of the beast which
[52:27] has been so much disputed what it was
[52:30] now fake on my hearing
[52:33] hearing the word of god right
[52:35] then when we hear
[52:36] that we are free here we go
[52:38] and refuse to act upon our freedom
[52:43] then we will be sealed
[52:45] to my opinion to be sealed away from god
[52:49] is to receive the mark of the beast
[52:53] so you see how you bring it now
[52:55] they go close we don't or you care buy
[52:56] and sell
[52:58] is that right
[53:00] people don't understand the ceiling
[53:01] going on now
[53:04] you're being marked to be filled with
[53:06] the holy ghost or mark to be judged
[53:09] oh glory to god remember cain went off
[53:11] the presence of god and was marked
[53:14] that was the first mark come from
[53:16] but before you as matthew went out of
[53:18] presence
[53:20] the bride will be coming into presence
[53:24] oh glory to god know that when the hero
[53:27] of the heard the jubilee song
[53:30] if you if he didn't want to be free then
[53:32] he had to be sealed
[53:34] and it is today that when men and women
[53:36] hear this marvelous gospel of the lord
[53:39] jesus christ and of the baptism of the
[53:41] holy ghost you are the same place where
[53:44] you have to make a choice you can never
[53:45] hear and be the same you accept it and
[53:48] receive christ if you refuse it you are
[53:50] seated away from christ oh glory it's
[53:53] your attitude towards the hearing of the
[53:56] word of god
[53:57] hallelujah praise god in acts 19 when
[54:00] they drop above the holy ghost then
[54:02] people say we even know we have that
[54:05] they say don't make jokes it have that
[54:09] said but how will he baptize he's under
[54:10] john baptism he said that yet again but
[54:12] it's over again it has something called
[54:14] holy spirit we have been here but no
[54:16] holy ghost
[54:18] there are people in the message they
[54:19] didn't hear about the holy ghost because
[54:20] they have been taught once you receive
[54:21] the message of the holy ghost which is a
[54:24] lie but a man was addressing that to the
[54:26] pentecostal who claimed to have an
[54:28] experience of the holy ghost he said if
[54:29] you have the holy ghost you will receive
[54:31] this word
[54:33] so people come in the message read when
[54:35] you believe the word you have the holy
[54:36] ghost and they believe the old self is
[54:39] holy ghost
[54:40] some some even believe they are the holy
[54:41] ghost
[54:43] demons lying to them doctrines of devils
[54:45] some even believe they are the holy
[54:46] ghost
[54:48] oh my god
[54:50] hallelujah
[54:52] when the seal and angel
[54:54] for the brown
[54:55] message fellowship by redemption
[54:57] crossed through the country
[54:59] he was commanded to put a mark upon
[55:02] those who sigh and cry
[55:05] oh

[55:19] angel from the east
[55:21] but here the prophecy when they see an
[55:22] angel

[1:20:05] and sees him in deer
[1:20:07] by
[1:20:08] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:20:10] and it lasts until jesus comes
[1:20:13] not from one revival to another but
[1:20:15] until the day
[1:20:16] of your redemption when that boxcar the
[1:20:19] door is closed and they go and put the
[1:20:21] seal up on it you cannot open it no more
[1:20:23] until it's reached the final destination
[1:20:25] and every man that's born again
[1:20:27] and sealed into the kingdom of god has
[1:20:29] no more desire of the world
[1:20:31] until the day that jesus christ take him
[1:20:32] into the kingdom so if you are having
[1:20:34] trouble and seeing you've got the holy
[1:20:36] ghost where they belong you have to take
[1:20:37] all the loose way oh my and get it out
[1:20:40] hallelujah
[1:20:42] mary magdalene
[1:20:45] didn't realize the spirits that was on
[1:20:47] her
[1:20:49] and when you get that kind of spirit on
[1:20:51] you men
[1:20:52] you get out of there and start lusting
[1:20:54] for women you say well it's human nature
[1:20:56] not like that
[1:20:58] no it's a spirit the bible said it was a
[1:21:01] spirit
[1:21:02] that's right and the thing to do then
[1:21:05] the blood of jesus christ
[1:21:07] cleanses you from lust and passion
[1:21:10] called sanctification
[1:21:13] now the word sanctification means to be
[1:21:15] clean
[1:21:16] and set aside
[1:21:17] for service
[1:21:19] now that lust spirit leaves you
[1:21:22] under
[1:21:23] sanctification
[1:21:26] let our little lady nice goes to church
[1:21:28] she sings in the choir she has to move
[1:21:30] her grass a little bit of shorts on let
[1:21:32] her get sanctified one time
[1:21:34] and let her put on appear
[1:21:36] you said that almost have a wreck
[1:21:38] looking at the woman in the yard i let
[1:21:39] him get simplified one time and go down
[1:21:41] the street he will keep his mind on what
[1:21:43] he's doing that's right
[1:21:44] oh my
[1:21:46] that is signification
[1:21:48] you are not sealed by sanification
[1:21:52] you are sealed by the baptism of the
[1:21:55] holy spirit
[1:21:56] a ceiling is the completion of the work
[1:22:00] and that's the reason it couldn't be
[1:22:02] seen on the luther wesley either one
[1:22:04] so it's the holy spirit all along and
[1:22:07] that's the portion of the holy spirit
[1:22:09] this is a greater portion of the holy
[1:22:11] spirit then when you receive the baptism
[1:22:13] of the holy ghost that's the completion
[1:22:15] of the holy spirit taking this abode in
[1:22:17] you to manifest gifts speaking in
[1:22:19] tongues and interpretation of tongues
[1:22:21] and gifts of power wisdom knowledge
[1:22:23] understanding oh praise god hallelujah
[1:22:27] oh my

[1:22:30] will be made out of thousands times
[1:22:31] thousands of people but it will be the
[1:22:33] elect
[1:22:34] out of every age
[1:22:36] every time a message went fought and the
[1:22:38] people believed it and accepted it and
[1:22:41] the light it was they were sealed away
[1:22:44] until the day
[1:22:46] of redemption so the lutheran was sealed
[1:22:48] away by justification they experienced
[1:22:51] give the lord a shout hallelujah
[1:22:54] the wesleyan was sealed away by
[1:22:56] sanctification it was an experience oh
[1:22:59] my hallelujah he said they were so
[1:23:02] sanctified hallelujah that the holy
[1:23:04] ghost you come upon them and they had
[1:23:06] buckets of water because when they get
[1:23:08] packed out on the floor they used to
[1:23:09] throw water to revive them because they
[1:23:11] couldn't get it because it wasn't it yet
[1:23:13] but they were so sanctified that it
[1:23:15] attracted the holy ghost could you
[1:23:16] imagine a stunning right but praising
[1:23:18] and worshiping god and i just sit in the
[1:23:20] church bam holy ghost come upon you but

[1:23:37] into hell and he rose and god picked up
[1:23:40] his body and gave him life took the body
[1:23:42] of jesus set to the right hand of glory
[1:23:43] and sent back the holy ghost as a
[1:23:46] covenant there you are don't fall short
[1:23:48] of that brother without the battle of
[1:23:50] the holy ghost you are lost but if the
[1:23:52] spirit of god is in there the spirit can
[1:23:55] back up a little bit that's the only you

[1:23:57] heaven

[1:24:01] supernatural
[1:24:02] the doors can't unlock you could walk in
[1:24:04] there and bump your head against it but
[1:24:06] if the spirit of god is in deer the
[1:24:09] spirit of god inside it unhinged the
[1:24:11] doors oh my so jesus was tore apart
[1:24:14] right his soul went to god god blessed

[1:32:36] covenant that god has made through
[1:32:37] abraham to isa to christ through the
[1:32:40] church by the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:32:43] the robe of seven colors that was upon
[1:32:46] joseph that was upon jesus is upon the
[1:32:48] church today
[1:32:50] you mean joseph rope was upon jesus
[1:32:53] yes he was filled with the holy ghost
[1:32:55] without measure
[1:32:56] hallelujah that robe have to come upon
[1:32:58] the bride if he is the example seat son
[1:33:01] and he had an experience at the jordan
[1:33:03] where you get your experience not be it
[1:33:05] done under me according to your word
[1:33:07] people like to talk about general that
[1:33:08] sounds good mary said that be it done
[1:33:10] unto me according to the world america
[1:33:11] conceivably your son yeah that's the
[1:33:13] same way you have to hit up a room
[1:33:17] say something nice
[1:33:18] be it done under me according to that
[1:33:20] word and something quick
[1:33:21] mary didn't feel nothing
[1:33:24] burram said she didn't feel nothing
[1:33:26] she just ruined liza better said grab a
[1:33:27] baby he made me call jesus and john's
[1:33:30] had to jump inside her bedroom
[1:33:32] she had feeling nothing
[1:33:33] and that's what we had to become
[1:33:35] we just received the word what's the
[1:33:37] secret the word
[1:33:38] is in the brain hallelujah then come
[1:33:40] what the spirit to activate the word
[1:33:43] that's in the bride why because the word
[1:33:45] is a seed who shows the seed sun a man
[1:33:48] so sonam had to come back again to sow
[1:33:50] seed what seed the original seed is a
[1:33:52] bible seed because the word was lost to
[1:33:54] the ages so you have to gather all the
[1:33:55] word to bring it into a seed what the
[1:33:58] seed must produce the son of god again
[1:34:00] oh glory to god because after son of man
[1:34:02] is son of god after son of god will be
[1:34:04] son of david oh give the lord a shout
[1:34:06] did you get what i'm saying son of man
[1:34:09] then the holy ghost fell in the upper
[1:34:10] room son of god
[1:34:11] spirit
[1:34:13] coming upon the sons in the upper room
[1:34:16] the produced son of god seven church
[1:34:17] ages son of god
[1:34:19] then come back a prophecy and even thus
[1:34:21] challenge being the day when the son of
[1:34:22] man is revealed luke 17 30 son and come
[1:34:25] back again to bring seed
[1:34:27] hallelujah after he saw seed what
[1:34:29] happened the enemy
[1:34:31] hallelujah the enemy come and see
[1:34:34] so this is logical this is accepted this
[1:34:36] is the word we are worried about that
[1:34:38] who preach and false which are all kind
[1:34:40] of crazy stuff that is the seed of the
[1:34:41] devil i have nothing to do with that
[1:34:43] they are their own hallelujah i am
[1:34:45] interested in the solomon seed sown for
[1:34:48] the bride a question was asked when the
[1:34:50] solomon cometh shall we find faith on
[1:34:52] the earth oh glory to god not talk faith
[1:34:56] faith have works that goes with it
[1:34:58] oh glory to god man can fool me
[1:35:00] hallelujah could talk you talk talk and
[1:35:02] talk but shall we find faith on the
[1:35:04] earth let's finally find churches
[1:35:05] massachusetts and tabernacle and this
[1:35:07] tabernacle and this prayer no no shall
[1:35:09] we find faith on youth and that figure
[1:35:11] be expressed because he was sent a
[1:35:12] prophet to turn our hearts back to the
[1:35:14] feet of the fathers oh glory to god and
[1:35:16] peter didn't have no education to pump
[1:35:18] new set of mysteries and all kind of
[1:35:19] thing but they have to take note you've
[1:35:20] been with jesus oh glory to god and this
[1:35:22] bride hallelujah they had to take note
[1:35:25] that she had been with jesus
[1:35:27] all glory to god because the works of
[1:35:29] jesus will be manifested through her he
[1:35:31] said by and through the bride will be
[1:35:33] fulfilled all so don't worry the bribe
[1:35:35] will fulfill all whether she educated or
[1:35:37] not whether she informed or not whether
[1:35:39] she know mysteries or not because christ
[1:35:41] in her is the mystery of all what are
[1:35:42] they talking about oh glory to god amen
[1:35:45] hallelujah and i'm saying tonight my
[1:35:47] christian friend no matter what church
[1:35:50] you belong to wherever you are if you
[1:35:51] are not into the kingdom of god by the
[1:35:54] baptism of the holy spirit bringing you
[1:35:56] into the body of christ you press him
[1:35:58] now for you don't know what all he's
[1:35:59] coming
[1:36:00] he said okay what you should and i don't
[1:36:02] care what group you belong to
[1:36:03] what church who's your pastor is
[1:36:05] you have to press on
[1:36:07] he said cain realized what he had did he
[1:36:10] went off from the presence of god and
[1:36:12] was sealed away from god by a mark
[1:36:15] that was placed upon him
[1:36:16] so the seal going both ways sealed into
[1:36:18] god and seal away from god the seal away
[1:36:21] from god is the mark of the beast but
[1:36:23] every man getting a seal
[1:36:25] oh hallelujah all that well on the earth
[1:36:27] shall worship the beast except
[1:36:30] those whose names are written in the
[1:36:33] lamb spoke of
[1:36:34] oh blessed be the name of the lord oh
[1:36:36] glory to god so he saw
[1:36:39] revelation 7 chapter are we going good
[1:36:42] hallelujah praise the name of the lord
[1:36:44] he said watch revelation the seventh
[1:36:46] chapter there where we'll end up the
[1:36:48] gentile dispensation watch his timing
[1:36:51] watch
[1:36:52] revelation the seventh chapter and he's
[1:36:54] turning into ezekiel 9. he said
[1:36:56] revelation the seventh chapter where we
[1:36:58] will end up the gentile dispensation see
[1:37:02] if it's right or not that was where the
[1:37:04] prophet of ezekiel 9
[1:37:06] prophesied the ending of that age
[1:37:09] now here the holy spirit is prophesying
[1:37:13] the end of this age so he is connecting
[1:37:16] ezekiel 9 with revelation chapter seven
[1:37:20] what is ezekiel 9
[1:37:22] go
[1:37:23] and put a mark
[1:37:25] upon those that sigh and cry
[1:37:27] and after that be slaughtering angels
[1:37:29] what is revelation 7 hold back the four
[1:37:32] angels of destruction until the jews be
[1:37:35] sealed
[1:37:36] all glorious the gentiles have to be
[1:37:38] sealed and jews have to be sealed the
[1:37:40] closing of the gentile age is a sealant
[1:37:46] god seals off the gentiles
[1:37:49] and then goes to the jews to steal 144
[1:37:51] 000.

[1:38:02] up on the earth upon the sea no watch
[1:38:04] the vision he first saw i saw four
[1:38:06] angels standing at the four corners
[1:38:08] places around the eighth angel hole in
[1:38:11] the four winds and i saw another angel
[1:38:14] from the east having the s-e-a-l he
[1:38:16] spelled us out seal the finished work in
[1:38:19] other words having the seal of the
[1:38:21] living god and he cried loud voicing the
[1:38:23] angels he was given the hurt hurt not

[1:38:28] the servants of god in the forehead then
[1:38:30] he talked about so much from the tribe
[1:38:31] of benjamin and and babylon and so on
[1:38:33] like that and after this after this
[1:38:36] i saw a great multitude that no man
[1:38:39] could number
[1:38:40] all kindred nation he said where did
[1:38:42] they come up from you seen the ceiling
[1:38:44] away of those jews at the end but when
[1:38:46] the angel was given forth to go and
[1:38:47] destroy he said i seen them where these
[1:38:50] come from all kindred and the prophet
[1:38:52] said they were clothed with white robes
[1:38:54] and palms in the hand that's the bride
[1:38:56] the gentile bride had been sealed away
[1:38:59] here oh give the lord a shout oh glory
[1:39:02] to god your meanings are sealed with a
[1:39:04] gentile right yes that's why here comes
[1:39:07] the angel from the east it's the
[1:39:08] stealing angel oh glory to god and the
[1:39:11] angels wrong about the throne elders
[1:39:13] four beasts fell on the throne on their
[1:39:14] faces and worshiped god saying listen if
[1:39:17] this don't sound like a holy ghost
[1:39:19] meeting blessing and wisdom and

[1:39:23] god forever and ever
[1:39:25] oh blessed be the name of the lord

[1:39:33] morning lesson these virtues has to be
[1:39:36] in there
[1:39:38] before the capstone can even come on it
[1:39:41] you might shout you might sing you might
[1:39:44] speak with tongues and dance that has
[1:39:46] nothing at all to do with it
[1:39:48] until these things are scripturally
[1:39:52] proven
[1:39:52] and sealed into you
[1:39:54] the holy spirit seals you as an
[1:39:57] individual
[1:39:59] then you are sons and daughters
[1:40:00] i love that so there's no church ceiling
[1:40:04] there's no group sealing that why he
[1:40:06] said no church can hold the holy ghost
[1:40:07] it will leak right out nobody could say
[1:40:09] i have it you don't have it that's
[1:40:11] foolishness you don't have no scripture
[1:40:13] for that hallelujah they can have their
[1:40:15] teachings and doctrines and revelation
[1:40:16] that is their own but you see the holy
[1:40:18] ghost no man are controlling that oh

[1:40:29] you could you have something else
[1:40:31] you're on your own with that like
[1:40:32] foolishness oh that's why he's telling
[1:40:34] them those when they say the kingdom
[1:40:35] here he said whatever with them the
[1:40:37] kingdom is within you bully them fool
[1:40:39] you that are coming from the kingdom

[1:40:42] kingdom is within you the kingdom is the
[1:40:43] word turn spirit and power in your life
[1:40:45] that's the kingdom inside of you or give
[1:40:47] the lord a shout hallelujah give the
[1:40:49] lord some praises glory to god
[1:40:52] hallelujah so the income rider our glory
[1:40:54] the god is a sealed angel and the

[1:40:59] the holy spirit is the white horse rider
[1:41:01] isn't that right thank you lord jesus
[1:41:03] hallelujah so but i brought her in
[1:41:04] oneness he says the bible says in the
[1:41:06] last days there's going to be churches
[1:41:08] another power babel they'll have a form
[1:41:11] of godliness to deny god's word and
[1:41:13] power the power of his word what is the
[1:41:15] word what is the kingdom of god we've
[1:41:17] got to belong to the kingdom before we
[1:41:20] can be subjects of the king
[1:41:22] i love that
[1:41:24] did you hear that
[1:41:25] the king not in charge of nobody not
[1:41:27] belonging to the kingdom
[1:41:29] the king
[1:41:30] and that is where they get the kingdom
[1:41:32] from it's the domain of the king
[1:41:34] because the king is the boss the king is
[1:41:36] in charge so when you belong to the
[1:41:38] kingdom the king protects you the king
[1:41:40] had to feed you
[1:41:41] hal the king had to help you
[1:41:43] hallelujah the king covering you because
[1:41:45] that is his domain
[1:41:47] so you cannot be subject to the king if
[1:41:48] they're not in the kingdom
[1:41:50] oh glory to god hallelujah thank you
[1:41:53] lord
[1:41:53] he said what is the kingdom we belong to
[1:41:55] our kingdom before we can never be
[1:41:57] subject of the king how many knows that
[1:41:58] he see amen well how do you get into the
[1:42:00] kingdom
[1:42:02] how
[1:42:03] here we go
[1:42:04] the kingdom of god is the word of god
[1:42:08] made back in power
[1:42:13] so we appreciate mysteries let the
[1:42:15] machine turn into power
[1:42:16] let me see where that message really is
[1:42:19] you're preaching word let it work on the
[1:42:20] power that's the kingdom
[1:42:22] oh hallelujah
[1:42:24] here we are the end time
[1:42:26] coming from the east west north south
[1:42:28] what are we doing
[1:42:29] getting ready for that rapture getting
[1:42:32] ready holding ourselves steady for a few
[1:42:34] minutes till every fiber is filled with
[1:42:36] the holy ghost
[1:42:38] oh you mean after all this teaching and
[1:42:39] preaching for 50 plus years we had to
[1:42:41] hold steady for a few minutes to be
[1:42:44] filled every fiber yes how do you expect
[1:42:46] this motor to put on immortality this
[1:42:48] transformation had to come from inside
[1:42:50] out
[1:42:50] hallelujah can't put a two-volt battery
[1:42:53] and you have a big engine a big engine
[1:42:55] is you have to start that thomas engine
[1:42:57] you cannot tumble an engine with a
[1:42:59] torch like that tree
[1:43:01] you have to get the power on the inside
[1:43:02] the tomilac engine so to move on to the
[1:43:05] rapture you have to get rapturing power
[1:43:07] otherwise known as rapture and faith
[1:43:09] not norman said no rapture in faith
[1:43:12] that you could believe that you'll be
[1:43:14] changed in a moment and a twinkle of an
[1:43:15] eye hallelujah he's calling people
[1:43:18] together in true oneness with himself
[1:43:20] by his holy spirit isn't that right
[1:43:23] hallelujah by one spirit we are all
[1:43:25] individually baptized into one body
[1:43:27] collectively the body of jesus christ
[1:43:30] and is jesus living with his spirit in
[1:43:32] your flesh
[1:43:33] serving the church and doing the same
[1:43:35] things
[1:43:36] signs and then sign that you love him
[1:43:39] you're ready for the rapture and the
[1:43:40] word of god is a sword here we go and it
[1:43:43] takes a hand to hold the sword it takes
[1:43:46] that hand of fate and that hand of fate
[1:43:48] it depends upon how strong it is this
[1:43:50] hand of feet might just be strong enough
[1:43:52] to cut out a little hole and say by fate
[1:43:54] i'm saved that's a great cut but then if
[1:43:57] a stronger hand the whole that sword of
[1:44:00] a strong hand it will cut plump to
[1:44:01] everything the devil can put out there
[1:44:03] and make every promise shine through in
[1:44:05] the power of his resurrection strong on
[1:44:07] our feet you could cut up what you want
[1:44:09] you could go down lord that give you a
[1:44:10] blessing they cut the blessing out and
[1:44:12] you could cut out to be filled with the
[1:44:14] holy ghost and he being the groom and
[1:44:16] the bride has to come forth because it's
[1:44:18] part of him and it can only be the
[1:44:20] manifestation of the fulfilling of all
[1:44:23] the revelations and others that spoke of
[1:44:25] the bride let me read it again this
[1:44:27] thing worthy of reading again
[1:44:29] he being the groom the bride has to come
[1:44:31] forward cause it's part of him and it
[1:44:34] can only be
[1:44:36] the manifestation
[1:44:38] of the fulfillment of all the
[1:44:41] revelations that spoke of the bride
[1:44:45] it can only manifest if it does
[1:44:47] something different from the groom it
[1:44:48] isn't the bride because he is flesh of
[1:44:50] his flesh bone of his bone life of his
[1:44:52] life power is power oh glory to god so
[1:44:55] the bride will be the manifestation of
[1:44:58] the promised word
[1:45:01] not talkation
[1:45:03] it has to come into our manifestation
[1:45:06] hallelujah
[1:45:08] oh my dynamics to the mechanics the
[1:45:11] world will not be able to withstand it
[1:45:14] i'll reason up again last day that's the
[1:45:15] easter message the dynamics and
[1:45:17] mechanics together mechanics without
[1:45:20] dynamics no good neither is dynamics
[1:45:22] without mechanics you can scream shout
[1:45:25] jump up and down all you want it won't
[1:45:27] do no good it'll only work as they come
[1:45:29] together so will one set still and the
[1:45:31] other one will go up the only thing of
[1:45:33] it has got to be you have you might look
[1:45:35] alike here we go
[1:45:37] both claim to be churches
[1:45:40] both claim to be bright but one has
[1:45:42] mechanics and dynamics it brings to pass
[1:45:45] of what he said is the truth it just
[1:45:47] won't move no matter how good the
[1:45:48] mechanics is until the dynamics are
[1:45:51] so the mysteries and revelations and
[1:45:53] doctrines and teachings can be laid well
[1:45:55] out in well in order until dynamics come
[1:45:58] oh praise god it can't move
[1:46:00] and then he says you know in the church
[1:46:02] of the living god this morning lays the
[1:46:04] power oh hallelujah to heal all sickness
[1:46:07] in the church of the living god lays
[1:46:08] power to overcome all temptation in the
[1:46:11] possession of the church of the living
[1:46:13] god this morning lays the power to
[1:46:15] change sin and throw it away and receive
[1:46:18] the baptism
[1:46:19] of the holy ghost
[1:46:21] museum come up please
[1:46:23] hallelujah praise god oh blessed be the
[1:46:26] name of the lord

[1:46:37] beloved i can't believe you're finished
[1:46:40] yeah
[1:46:42] one day
[1:46:44] it'd be one last summon
[1:46:47] one day
[1:46:48] it will be breaking into dynamics
[1:46:50] to the mechanics
[1:46:52] oh my maybe today's that day
[1:46:55] this is brother branham
[1:46:57] wesley had a revival
