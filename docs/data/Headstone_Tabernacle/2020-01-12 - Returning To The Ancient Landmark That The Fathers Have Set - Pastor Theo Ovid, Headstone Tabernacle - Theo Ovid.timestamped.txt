[1:00:21] creamy honey pulpit and he just pulled
[1:00:24] an old bread to and given her bread and
[1:00:25] bread it's an i precision
[1:00:31] let me say it again I do have a message
[1:00:34] on God said behold I send you the entire
[1:00:39] world Elijah the prophet and he will do
[1:00:46] something I like what he said that this
[1:00:49] you have to translate that when they say
[1:00:51] he he gone but he is his message as he
[1:00:58] conversion the people dismiss like we
[1:01:01] read something things Wednesday night
[1:01:02] about Ezekiel bone God brought Ezekiel
[1:01:05] to the valley a dry bone and such and
[1:01:06] these bones live question
[1:01:08] that's a scary thing you bring a man a
[1:01:10] bunch of bones the bones a team
[1:01:11] connected together only bones like bones
[1:01:14] little bones country and say can these
[1:01:16] bones live well in Ezekiel smart he
[1:01:21] didn't fresh and just run his mouth to
[1:01:23] say however live he said don't know it
[1:01:26] [Music]
[1:01:31] but but do you know then then because he
[1:01:35] can relax himself and say you know God
[1:01:37] tell them prophesy say unto these bones
[1:01:40] that you shall live I will cause breath
[1:01:44] to come into you watch breath commanded
[1:01:47] to be bones the de final product but it
[1:01:50] have a process to get the breath so when
[1:01:54] God say he shall turn the house of the
[1:01:56] churun back to the faith of the father's
[1:01:57] there's the process and how he will be
[1:01:59] back
[1:02:01] [Applause]
[1:02:04] so when God pronounced something over
[1:02:07] your life is the process to get to what
[1:02:09] is pronounced it doesn't change what he
[1:02:18] has pronounced let me give an example
[1:02:20] God pulled Samuel go to the house of
[1:02:24] Jesse and anoint me a king he didn't say
[1:02:30] boy he said King God seeing David mature
[1:02:34] on the throne God saw David King ship
[1:02:38] David is still a boy he had qualified to
[1:02:41] settle not shown yet but cause anoint
[1:02:43] him know he's anointed you have to go to
[1:02:51] the process to reach ready anointing us
[1:02:54] pleased him so going to pronounce things
[1:03:02] over you but then there's a process to
[1:03:04] get there in between where you are and
[1:03:07] where you are to be help me somebody
[1:03:17] where you are and where you're gonna be
[1:03:19] yes I'm the devil talking to you because
[1:03:22] you ready yet yep you're Irish dead yet
[1:03:27] but you're on your way
[1:03:30] [Applause]
[1:03:37] maybe seasoned guys I do whatever with
[1:03:41] one man saying because man didn't give
[1:03:43] the prophecy and I wouldn't let a man
[1:03:46] speak into my life who not authorized to
[1:03:48] speak in my life don't let nobody speak
[1:03:51] into your life what don't authorize to

[1:03:54] wrong thing into your life and they may
[1:03:55] happen to believe that person and that
[1:03:57] person could be a liar or God on a liar
[1:04:00] speak at their life and mess up you're
[1:04:01] like you don't want that you want the
[1:04:03] right person to speak into your life and

[1:12:56] people who own more intuitive news
[1:12:58] number the Bible and the promises of God
[1:13:00] see and things that Orton the evening
[1:13:03] allowed to be published put out for the
[1:13:05] trash can and we Pentecostal people
[1:13:07] picked them up and just left over them
[1:13:08] like a bunch of flies and a garbage can
[1:13:10] he said what we need is back to our
[1:13:12] first love back to Pentecost and after
[1:13:16] FSS racy they lost the first love the
[1:13:18] next is a smiler
[1:13:19] and they were just gonna come from I'm
[1:13:22] built money bitterness root of
[1:13:25] bitterness coming into them this church
[1:13:28] the main church the big pat the majority
[1:13:30] name was hammering against the Holy
[1:13:31] Ghost ruling any church and they wanted
[1:13:34] to rule themselves they wanted to set up
[1:13:36] a priesthood they wanted to act by the
[1:13:38] Old Testament they wanted priests and
[1:13:41] how we classify ourselves we got our
[1:13:43] organization denomination standing class
[1:13:45] and we got grandchildren it's that then
[1:13:48] took in by adoption so forth we don't
[1:13:51] have business bad we don't have the old
[1:13:54] line of Pentecostals that used to die
[1:13:59] out and really come true with God that
[1:14:02] genuine feet
[1:14:07] so in those old days it wasn't
[1:14:10] complicated baptized and as a saint
[1:14:12] ain't a saint yet until that same
[1:14:16] preacher one prick true I'm window talk
[1:14:21] Amon don't casual prayer where you're
[1:14:22] listening to your own pray and listen to
[1:14:24] how your printer God not that you pray
[1:14:26] coming from your heart sign talk my name
[1:14:29] polish pray know and you know a clue you
[1:14:31] cutting or eating is going on to here
[1:14:32] and do you want water here you know but
[1:14:35] I had talking a mock win
[1:14:40] today God can come down on skipper you
[1:14:44] know he say you had too much teaching
[1:14:46] looking for new light like the problem
[1:14:51] in ethnicity people are too much at
[1:14:53] teaching and more teachers you know the
[1:14:56] Bible said they would be having itching
[1:14:58] ears because he prayers had died not
[1:15:02] just hard yes get them in the spirit
[1:15:05] that's hard listening to teachers and
[1:15:07] teaching like easy as long as you have a
[1:15:15] manatee our bringing some teaching how
[1:15:16] are they easy listen to him before God
[1:15:23] help you but when you understand this
[1:15:29] word is to become activated in your life
[1:15:33] call it wallet and the man or the
[1:15:36] teacher can activate it to you then your
[1:15:40] faith comes a little different because
[1:15:42] you recommend just to hear man you
[1:15:44] coming for the spirit to activate the
[1:15:47] way that the man is preaching you want
[1:15:50] that to come alive in your spirit in
[1:15:52] your heart in your soul so you reckon
[1:15:58] for later you come for a reality so I'm
[1:16:08] gonna skip skip a lot of stuff so it had
[1:16:15] left his first love leaving his first
[1:16:17] love of the word of God will reveal to
[1:16:19] us as haven't fallen from his own region
[1:16:21] which was Pentecost in plain English
[1:16:24] that means this church was in danger of
[1:16:26] being taken away from the religion of
[1:16:28] the Holy Spirit be control of the Spirit
[1:16:30] this was exactly what took place after
[1:16:32] Moses led Israel out of Egypt the way of
[1:16:34] God is to lead them by the cloud of fire
[1:16:37] prophetic utterance Merkel's and signs
[1:16:40] god-given wonders this was to be
[1:16:42] accomplished by God selected Gordon and
[1:16:45] Gord equipped
[1:16:46] sent men with the whole camp being
[1:16:48] dominated by a holy ghost move they
[1:16:54] rebelled they wanted a set of rules and
[1:16:57] creeps to go by and come like these
[1:16:59] people who don't have self-discipline to
[1:17:02] have in a discipline they like the
[1:17:04] pastors who could beat you whip on them
[1:17:06] because they need licks the comment
[1:17:10] Alain so the really kind of man that
[1:17:13] could put licks on them
[1:17:18] and then that the combative wallets it's
[1:17:24] almost like they're looking for abuse
[1:17:26] there's some people somehow they have a
[1:17:28] kind of sadistic
[1:17:30] thing about being abused but when you're
[1:17:36] motivated by love you care we have to
[1:17:41] come to church you can't wait to put you
[1:17:43] in other words because of the love for
[1:17:45] God you're serving God not because your
[1:17:48] father dragged inside here you're
[1:17:49] serving God because you love God if your
[1:17:52] father backside you are not gonna
[1:17:53] backslide if you're white backside you
[1:17:55] don't gonna backslide if your husband
[1:17:57] backs like you're not gonna backslide
[1:17:58] because of your love for God is not a
[1:18:05] man call you miss God call you is that
[1:18:07] man you serving as God your servant
[1:18:09] [Applause]
[1:18:12] did not serve in court because of the
[1:18:14] preacher because of God because of what
[1:18:16] he has done for you I believe in
[1:18:32] leadership but it's not watch watch
[1:18:34] watch
[1:18:34] but isn't but it's not the leadership of
[1:18:36] men I believe in I believe in the
[1:18:38] leadership of the Holy Ghost coming
[1:18:40] through the word I believe also that God
[1:18:43] has set men in the church who men who
[1:18:45] are gifted by the Spirit and they will
[1:18:47] keep the church in order I believe also
[1:18:50] that the church is ruled by men that God
[1:18:52] sends to take charge but that rule is by
[1:18:55] the world so that is not men really
[1:18:57] ruling but it's the Spirit of God for
[1:19:00] the word and spirit is one that is why I
[1:19:03] bring the coat coat and top coat on this
[1:19:06] is how you know I could press play and
[1:19:09] play a tape for you you know those
[1:19:14] judges will be presently the pawn Baram
[1:19:17] tape and presently call empress amply on
[1:19:24] one message what am i started to do I
[1:19:27] must stick up how many different
[1:19:28] messages the hell - way I get this good
[1:19:31] show because not one message not one
[1:19:33] book so I have to hunt for these things
[1:19:35] I can tell nobody hunt for me I am
[1:19:39] looking like them cruel sale any post
[1:19:41] with the facts that happened to a dead
[1:19:43] bird you know it have them just written
[1:19:45] a report looking this even accident
[1:19:47] gonna happen in some church to come pick
[1:19:48] up some dead bird I nothing that they
[1:19:50] know we fly in a long time trying to get
[1:19:53] we own meat or glory to God but Isaac
[1:19:57] was the preach this morning he fell ill
[1:19:59] he had the flu and so on that's Hawaiian
[1:20:01] a preacher but he was the preach this
[1:20:02] morning so I was who put the press play
[1:20:08] after fine meat fresh-killed caucus but
[1:20:12] clipping blood hasn't beat rippen when
[1:20:17] you put your beak in you gotta rip that
[1:20:18] meat there and I don't feed your spirit
[1:20:21] have to feed your soul has to do
[1:20:24] something for your life I fresh speaker
[1:20:26] toughies Oh glory that God you love him
[1:20:30] remember them we shall rule over you who
[1:20:33] have spoken unto you the Word of God
[1:20:34] whose faith follow considering the end
[1:20:37] of their conversation and not his life
[1:20:39] but see what is happening back here that
[1:20:42] falls Ryan was getting a hold and I was
[1:20:44] teaching that rulership my man was right
[1:20:46] so they could quote that scripture right
[1:20:48] it taught the beat that chills had to be
[1:20:51] governed it taught a control over the
[1:20:53] people but instead of doing it God's Way
[1:20:55] this simply took authority invested all
[1:20:58] the spiritual power in their own hands
[1:20:59] and came out with a holy priesthood
[1:21:02] standing between God and the people and
[1:21:05] they went right back to the old ironic
[1:21:08] system and I cor say you have one thing
[1:21:12] that I hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans
[1:21:15] every time you put a man like Mary or
[1:21:18] put a man between you and God a trouble
[1:21:20] it has to be you seeing that you have
[1:21:23] direct access it has to be you seeing
[1:21:26] now when you come to service every
[1:21:28] service that gets in a password and I
[1:21:29] use a name username as new the password
[1:21:32] is the word and it's given you the
[1:21:34] authority which is faith to approach God
[1:21:37] and pull down any blessing
[1:21:41] [Applause]
[1:21:43] so you kind of get on authorised Andrew
[1:21:47] you are authorized by the blood of Jesus
[1:21:51] by a new and living way to enter into
[1:21:54] the holiest of Holies no illness that ll
[1:21:57] stop you can go younger son he died once
[1:22:00] or glory the caught and perfected
[1:22:03] forever them that are sanctified so his
[1:22:05] blood made away hallelujah little Cody
[1:22:08] is not about news about him it's not
[1:22:11] your sacrifices this sacrifice or get a
[1:22:14] lot some praises but you see it do you
[1:22:17] see how that gives you access to every
[1:22:21] redemptive blessing or glory to God

[1:34:48] gospel is real this cosplay is original
[1:34:51] we're not preaching fairytale maybe see
[1:34:54] that glory to God let's continue
[1:34:56] Moses born what notice the seal India
[1:35:00] with an intellectual conception this is
[1:35:04] the message right now see with all
[1:35:07] faiths he was born to delivers people
[1:35:09] it's inside no fear is the victory that
[1:35:12] overcomes the world and that citizen new
[1:35:15] to overcome everything that you have the
[1:35:17] overcoming yet
[1:35:21] I'm saying again the faith is already in
[1:35:24] you to overcome everything you have not
[1:35:27] overcome yet what has to happen in a
[1:35:38] watch so noses
[1:35:42] the Seelye india and when you when I'm
[1:35:44] preaching this you see you ever see
[1:35:45] yourself all right with an intellectual
[1:35:49] conception we'll all fit all with all
[1:35:51] the feet he was born to deliver his
[1:35:55] people and yet there we go it never come
[1:35:58] to life until that light from the Boonen
[1:36:02] bush flashed across it until he's seen
[1:36:06] not something he read about aha so they
[1:36:11] not read in a book no there's not
[1:36:12] readings for hold books now this is
[1:36:14] beyond readin know this is coming into a
[1:36:17] a reality that you know is God no man
[1:36:21] can't give you that no man can preach
[1:36:24] you that you got to encounter that okay
[1:36:28] the Lord a shout hallelujah what not
[1:36:34] something you read about but something
[1:36:36] is seen with his eyes something that
[1:36:38] spoke to him and he spoke back to it and
[1:36:41] that bring the thing to life and I think
[1:36:44] a woman boy or girl I think in an
[1:36:46] intellectual conception of what they
[1:36:48] think the word is and so forth can never
[1:36:51] have a false foundation stand until they
[1:36:55] have met that light that brings that
[1:36:58] would to a reality
[1:37:01] I warned that to be a burden upon your
[1:37:04] heart that you want that would to become
[1:37:07] a reality you know it is right you know
[1:37:10] it is true you know it is called speak
[1:37:13] it you know my button about the Prophet
[1:37:15] spoke it but you want beyond that you
[1:37:18] want the reality of it hallelujah so
[1:37:21] Thoth reality amen praise God
[1:37:25] so Moses know it intellectually the
[1:37:28] cedar was born in him was leaning his
[1:37:30] heart watch
[1:37:33] and he tried she was intellectual
[1:37:35] experience with the word like that but
[1:37:37] his intellectual today as an
[1:37:41] intellectual experience you could have
[1:37:43] with the word this is big to bring them
[1:37:48] all to deliver them knowing he was born
[1:37:50] for that purpose
[1:37:51] he note that time the scripture said on
[1:37:53] and so on and here the Prophet breaking
[1:37:55] you know we are coming to the rapture we
[1:37:58] have lived a time out at a time of the
[1:38:00] rapture is at hand
[1:38:01] we are looking for rapture and feet that
[1:38:03] can pull the church together and give it
[1:38:05] some supernatural strength that can
[1:38:08] change these bodies that we live in and
[1:38:10] we see a chord that can raise the dead
[1:38:13] off the floor or out of the yard and
[1:38:15] bring him back to life again and present
[1:38:17] him before us when we see a God that can
[1:38:20] take a cancer that it Amanda shadow and
[1:38:23] raise him up and strong healthy man that
[1:38:25] ought to give rafter in feet T the
[1:38:27] people drop a bomb on you
[1:38:32] he said rapture and fate is leading a
[1:38:34] message but when you're translating that
[1:38:39] it has to have a manifestation of the
[1:38:41] deadly wisdom of a cancer case being
[1:38:44] corrected and that will give reference a
[1:38:47] to the people because the rapture is a
[1:38:49] glorified divine healing the rapture is
[1:38:52] your body being changed in a moment or
[1:38:54] twig of an eye and you have interfered
[1:38:56] that your body could be changed and when
[1:38:58] you see court to take a man from cancer
[1:39:00] debt and pull him back to life
[1:39:02] you could not go to change your body
[1:39:04] when you can see court to change humor
[1:39:06] and kidney trouble and diabetes and
[1:39:09] reverse back high blood pressure
[1:39:10] whatever it is
[1:39:11] you couldn't know about the change you
[1:39:13] transform you
[1:39:15] [Applause]
[1:39:22] so watch rough genfit leading the
[1:39:25] message but that's not just an
[1:39:26] intellectual quote to preach like not
[1:39:28] let the word let's continue
[1:39:30] oh my hallelujah so it's not just
[1:39:33] wrapped in feet missing so wrapped in
[1:39:35] faith Lane the message says the good
[1:39:37] part of it you would pass as a letter
[1:39:39] pad the man being raised on the floor
[1:39:42] dead man
[1:39:43] that's the manifestation pad the need
[1:39:45] boot good and spirit come on give the
[1:39:48] Lord a show some people have the
[1:39:53] knowledge of the world but they have no
[1:39:55] manifestation that brings the water life
[1:39:57] you have to want it you have to thirst
[1:40:01] for it you're not tasting from my word
[1:40:03] this is in for life let's continue
[1:40:08] could we take some more watch here Moses
[1:40:12] based on his great call upon the wood it
[1:40:15] was great this is big
[1:40:18] Moses base is called upon the wood until
[1:40:23] one day he met this light and the very
[1:40:25] word itself spoke back to him then he
[1:40:29] got his anointed that anointed what he
[1:40:34] had in him that was on the inside I'm
[1:40:37] still reading so all this faith was on
[1:40:40] the inside
[1:40:41] what's the secret the word is in the
[1:40:45] bride and that's the secret is that
[1:40:47] outside the right is in the brain well
[1:40:49] that word in you has to be anointed
[1:40:53] [Applause]
[1:40:54] [Music]
[1:40:59] how could it be anointed when dynamics
[1:41:02] is the anointing for the word and the
[1:41:05] bride
[1:41:05] he said no other life could work in her
[1:41:08] so some Pentecostal anointed cannot you
[1:41:11] it will take dynamics itself that is not
[1:41:14] refreshing for you shall receive power
[1:41:16] when after the holy loss if I don't
[1:41:31] preach this how you will expect it how
[1:41:34] do I look for it if I don't preach this

[1:49:45] I'll ever thinking we got a rise
[1:49:46] ourselves to his level of thinking and
[1:49:48] meet him on the grounds that he provided
[1:49:50] for us or glory to God so the scribes
[1:49:54] and Pharisees the Hutt's they had their
[1:49:56] Creed's they had their dogmas that their
[1:49:58] robes the long beard the long gong and
[1:50:00] the tall hats and there were the
[1:50:03] representative of Christianity or the
[1:50:05] law of that day because of the looks and
[1:50:09] the appearance and their dressing and so
[1:50:10] on people respected them Jesus had no
[1:50:13] long hacked had not look at nothing like
[1:50:15] them he was outside the system
[1:50:17] altogether and he busted them no
[1:50:20] listeners but about he said they had
[1:50:23] their Creed's Pharisees Sadducees
[1:50:24] Herodians what more all different forms
[1:50:26] and sexy religion each one had this his
[1:50:29] that he didn't believe in resurrection
[1:50:31] no angel or spirit the other one
[1:50:33] believed in boot resurrection angel and
[1:50:34] spirit one believe a certain way of
[1:50:36] washing hands the other way do it sucks
[1:50:38] in the day Christ could comment on sort
[1:50:41] of a thing like that but when he comes
[1:50:42] in his power of his resurrection Christ
[1:50:45] that is to make this this apart to make
[1:50:49] people live an act
[1:50:52] and behave themselves and to change the
[1:50:55] attitudes and to change their ways and
[1:50:58] to change their living
[1:51:00] they don't want nothing to do with that
[1:51:04] they want teachings they want doctrines
[1:51:07] they don't want something to influence
[1:51:09] their behavior and their life I am here
[1:51:14] not even on that and this is still the
[1:51:17] world where they say a man or not this
[1:51:19] is still the truth that's why people are
[1:51:21] comfortable to confess what they believe
[1:51:26] they feel proud so what they want to
[1:51:34] live just like they want to live they
[1:51:36] want to continue right on living the way
[1:51:38] they lived and yet be very religious and
[1:51:41] put the church and be a member there of
[1:51:42] they can go on a Sunday morning whatever
[1:51:45] time it is a 50 minute sermon walk with
[1:51:47] a pasta and walk away from there kind of
[1:51:50] half settles and go back to drift to be
[1:51:52] personally like Church okay I choose
[1:51:56] natural in this church II have this
[1:51:58] natural and cute spiritual so you can't
[1:52:00] believe every body is the body is
[1:52:02] actually naturally dr. spiritual you
[1:52:05] want to be Church spiritual Jacob was
[1:52:07] Church spiritual he was a scholar is a
[1:52:10] trickster but he was church spiritual
[1:52:12] Esau was a better man but he was just
[1:52:15] natural Oh glory to God since that
[1:52:18] battle man is what your hunger in for
[1:52:21] Jacob wanted he built right hallelujah
[1:52:25] and God said Jacob I loved Esau he alone
[1:52:29] let's continue Jesus brought caught the
[1:52:32] human lives
[1:52:33] Oh glory to God are you yelling at me no
[1:52:36] Jesus did what he brought God to human
[1:52:39] lives quad was made human when Jesus was
[1:52:42] born God became man that he might become
[1:52:45] fellowship with man and in men to do
[1:52:48] what to achieve one purpose to bring to
[1:52:52] man what God is not what a church is
[1:52:56] [Applause]
[1:52:59] so when somebody talking about more
[1:53:01] water church than a body would about
[1:53:03] Gordon are they off because Jesus had
[1:53:05] come to bring what church is he kind of
[1:53:07] resent what God is not what church is
[1:53:10] for what God is Jesus came that he might
[1:53:13] present God to man and man didn't want
[1:53:16] it and the Holy Spirit today like the
[1:53:19] manner to present God to man but the man
[1:53:22] wants to go to church it Jones his
[1:53:25] stinking he cannot fathom it we must
[1:53:29] learn that God is not known by
[1:53:31] intellectual conception this is not that
[1:53:34] you have a witness kingdom all we

[2:00:40] a lot of trouble and confusion they
[2:00:41] would nickel in a bunch of myths that's
[2:00:44] what he have to with the character here
[2:00:46] it is brother Branham had power and got
[2:00:48] her to test him with the power I don't
[2:00:53] want to get far away room because God
[2:00:55] want to give him further
[2:00:56] so the people's are making love in
[2:00:57] church and he said go drop door and see

[2:01:01] whatever you see you'll be done
[2:01:03] I said I forgive you
[2:01:04] with power to do that power to say what
[2:01:08] a brain he said I forgive you because he
[2:01:11] knew himself he saw himself he was
[2:01:16] authentic he was real
[2:01:17] he wasn't mechanical he was an
[2:01:19] intellectual he was for real and we have
[2:01:22] to become authentic real not mechanical
[2:01:25] original this is me I forgive you and
[2:01:30] the Holy Spirit pour out because husband
[2:01:32] was pleased he said the right thing Oh
[2:01:37] later on God told him my voice tongues
[2:01:42] and interpretation because thou has
[2:01:44] chosen this narrow path you have walked
[2:01:48] in your own chosen you have picked the
[2:01:51] precise and color decision it is mighty
[2:01:55] it's the hard way but he picked it he
[2:02:00] say you walked in your own chosen I
[2:02:02] didn't force you you choose to walk this
[2:02:06] Christian path where you choose the
[2:02:07] bloody footprints under sons of time you
[2:02:10] choose that hallelujah so watch it will
[2:02:14] bring you into its nature you don't
[2:02:16] bring it subject to your nature it makes
[2:02:18] you subject its nature the Holy Spirit
[2:02:20] makes you live and love to do it how you
[2:02:22] love to give up the things of the world
[2:02:24] when the Holy Spirit comes in how it
[2:02:26] cleanses you and washes you and put a
[2:02:29] desire in you to follow him a thirst and
[2:02:33] a hunger for more of it just being
[2:02:36] yourself he brings realities who does
[2:02:39] that the Holy Spirit brings realities
[2:02:42] but a random said though in the early
[2:02:44] church they they have so much of the
[2:02:47] Holy Ghost and every opportunity they
[2:02:48] asking us for more more more when they
[2:02:52] beat them they come and say O God
[2:02:53] strictness and send give us more and
[2:02:55] they get that double portion they were
[2:02:56] filled with the Holy Ghost he said this
[2:02:58] age hardly have it and did not even
[2:03:00] asking for it but at early church the
[2:03:02] fathers and them or do only asking for
[2:03:03] more more Holy Ghost more Holy Ghost
[2:03:06] more power more love more witness and
[2:03:08] power Oh glory to God hallelujah praise
[2:03:12] God we believe it
[2:03:14] hallelujah
[2:03:16] when God place men here in the days of
[2:03:18] the Lord Jesus he give men a true
[2:03:21] roadmap to power to his power a roadmap
[2:03:26] is something that tells you where you
[2:03:29] were headed if you want to go and that's
[2:03:32] the way God wanted us to know he talked
[2:03:34] about he from California I've missed the
[2:03:36] time he could know where to go
[2:03:37] California I'm only driving time back
[2:03:39] and forth he said that's the way God
[2:03:40] want us to know his word we know it we
[2:03:44] have traveled it we have tested it we
[2:03:47] have tried it you know it leads to know
[2:03:50] his roadmap is his Bible the map is what
[2:03:54] there's not Google map or Apple map this
[2:03:57] is the Bible's a map this is a map to
[2:03:59] lead you to power or glory to God the
[2:04:03] Bible is the road map that leads to the
[2:04:05] power of God see it leads you to the
[2:04:09] power so seven thunders give faith to do
[2:04:14] what to lead you to the power and power
[2:04:17] produces the promise he said we need
[2:04:21] power so what's the word gets faith
[2:04:24] right unfit look the bottom there and
[2:04:27] right on top of it is one virtue and
[2:04:30] virtue is power that is what left Jesus
[2:04:33] right so the first thing God give you
[2:04:35] the revelation they give you faith and
[2:04:37] you expect with your feet know you move
[2:04:39] to put power hallelujah and willpower
[2:04:43] you could add the rest of the life
[2:04:44] because all these things are
[2:04:46] supernatural
[2:04:47] how many knows this is not natural you
[2:04:50] can make by a rainbow color clot
[2:04:52] undressing it does not it permitted
[2:04:54] inside of you that's a dress you're

[2:05:01] seven color clothes and makeup a rainbow
[2:05:03] dress that's not working what you need
[2:05:06] is this inside of you it starts with
[2:05:11] feet feet is a revelation but you have
[2:05:14] to get power
[2:05:15] isn't that right power needs promise so

[2:05:47] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[2:05:50] you oh this is a word the new birth is
[2:05:55] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:05:56] personally to you but that's not all
[2:06:04] next quote the new birth is an
[2:06:07] experience it's a gift of God it's the
[2:06:11] seal of your feet so if I preach new
[2:06:14] what is a revelation is a revelation is
[2:06:15] a revelation and don't tell you is also
[2:06:17] an experience you stock with revelation
[2:06:21] and you have no expectation for the
[2:06:23] experience the right question must be
[2:06:25] asked if you say in Revelation and
[2:06:28] experience the question is which one
[2:06:30] comes first then revelation comes first
[2:06:36] and experienced after boot is the truth
[2:06:39] the new boot is a revelation and the new
[2:06:43] virgin experience and you come right
[2:06:45] down the middle and you take both of
[2:06:46] them all glory to God you don't let
[2:06:49] nobody talk you out of experience
[2:06:51] hallelujah glory to God what you want is
[2:06:55] the revelation and the experience
[2:06:58] because faith is the substance of what
[2:07:01] you're hoping for you have to get
[2:07:03] experiences in reality but you have it
[2:07:05] by faith or give the Lord a shout
[2:07:08] Abraham at a revolution Isaac but he
[2:07:10] never saw Isaac for 25 years he hung in
[2:07:12] there with his revelation he could even
[2:07:14] show his wife the revelation he could
[2:07:16] talk it but he can show it it was inside
[2:07:19] of him and when it reveals to you it is
[2:07:21] yours or give the Lord a shout but is
[2:07:23] revealed to you it is yours
[2:07:24] Isaac was an Abraham Abraham knew it by
[2:07:28] revelation because Claude spoke to him
[2:07:31] or glory to God and that's what happened
[2:07:34] with Peter when Jesus the who do men say
[2:07:36] I am some say your distance to you that
[2:07:38] is who do you say I am
[2:07:39] he said Oh what the Christ then jesus
[2:07:41] said flesh and blood hath not revealed
[2:07:42] it unto you but my father or chlorine
[2:07:45] Accord that come from heaven that I come
[2:07:47] from text editors of Minister doctor

[2:08:58] rim with a specie he had intellectual
[2:09:01] feet he didn't have divine feet there's
[2:09:03] a quite a difference in me having an

[2:09:07] Baptist friends feel to go on he said

[2:38:28] Freddy's this will be loosed by the
[2:38:31] evening time message to bring back God
[2:38:33] among the people because the world was

[2:39:43] get into our church one time I was
[2:39:47] wondering if they think anybody
[2:39:48] initiation a material testimony in the
[2:39:53] early years I had no interest whatsoever
[2:39:56] in anybody from any church and equipping
[2:39:59] this message because the behaviors was
[2:40:01] so horrible the ministers was teaching
