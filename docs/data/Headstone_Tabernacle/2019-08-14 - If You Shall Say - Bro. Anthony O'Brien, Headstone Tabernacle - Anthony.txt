cockroaches fly away Holly because they can't stand in the presence of that light all the demons are running because Jesus is here there's no need to fear brother if he was so powerful then what do you think what happened when Jesus comes back again now oh and Jesus comes back on the earth in this time the Bible said gross darkness cover the earth it never had so much darkness ever was since

now right when Moses was in the process Melanie encoders using them to deliver the children of people children of Israel from out of the hand of Pharaoh Pharaoh was trying to make a bargain with Moses

he will break the back of the enemy to restore his children out of the hands of darkness [Applause] amen so this is no negotiation tonight we get ready to pray in a few minutes no negotiations tonight if you want the deliverance claim it hallelujah claim 100% holiday all right zeros after the number let's keep writing zeroes God's bank account is being off tonight oh I'll make an extraction make a withdrawal ask for big things tonight many men glory to go come on I could have a big grocery you man walk miles and miles of things people big big build big gross you don't hear it bill extra foods and a bank bill put basket honey they have forklift to pick up stuff none of the bales of toilet paper build up this field of that mounting they know what plenty is but they a seek audience then see God factory yet when caught ready to bless job got twice more than he had before and before us bless holla holla and that still is not a shadow of what was sort of for him in heaven Oh Solomon oh that's so much there's never mananitas blessing as much as Solomon the king and yet cause blessings coach treasures have more than that in heaven hallelujah more than that where I come from what about whole city of coal but our streets may be cold hallelujah hallelujah as crystal sapphire Chaves sapphire stone holy stones cut over the hands of man that's what God have laid up in store for you amen oh I see no ears heard what God has in store for his children hallelujah Oh a city coming down from God out of heaven if what God have prepared for you tonight Holly so don't you settle for nothing less than what God promised you if God promised the Holy Ghost don't settle for nothing less don't settle for some preachers interpretation of it don't settle for no man's idea whatever you want the original gospel the original fire the same fire that kept pizza the same fire averted Mary all up there in the upper room that's what we want tonight and we're not leaving without it Oh hollow so if you shall say hallelujah then be eternal to you Oh a quality of faith tonight giving praise and I Amen amen unreasoning - of the prophetic word a spoken word is yours not see he said now watch this word of god is eternal he said on God being infinite he cannot speak one thing and then later on change it to something else - some better decision no see because why because every decision of God is perfect every decision is perfect so when he chose you it was a perfect decision when he chose your soul from the beginning hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah make a mistake he knew you'd fall he knew you'll hardly have your trials or struggles but he made a perfect decision when he you tonight and he made a way that you will come to perfection that you would come to your season that you would be saved he knew you would make the right choice amen he cannot once his word is spoken it could never die it lives on and on and on the prophecy and it cannot can never die because it is God and His Word car no more die than he can die and if he can't die his food candy hey man that's it see so that's the reason we read and push John or Saint John or first chapter that in the beginning was a word and the Word was with God and the Word was God that's right you may and the wood was made flesh and the same God that was spoken in the beginning with his eternal purpose came on over and was made flesh and dwelt among sea man he changed his form a man from thought to flesh Eman became God's Word manifests a man now we could handle him he said here my hands here my feet here's my side touch me it is I Jesus be not afraid hallelujah be not dismayed he breathed upon them receive the Holy Ghost shall surely come to pass on upon you hallelujah oh you're gonna receive power from on high yeah many men glory is now right it was God's wood okay prophet said some years ago he said that a woman he said no this may not be authentic he said he said but he said that licked her tongue in Radium he said while mixing it to put on hands of dials of clocks and watches and stuff you say apparently it killed a woman but years later it when when they kept her skull for an autopsy and like they said they said you could take instruments he said whatever they use he said but they put it against that skull Boone and with a rumble he said you could still hear the radium going on in a skull and he said now after she'd been there yes he said but a radium continually goes on it's not right he said the interaction she had with you would be with it would really do the uridium amen it still went on him after she launched after she died he said in the word is the same way he said the word of God continually goes on a man a man continues on hallelujah amen regardless of what's teaching the word goes on he said now I'm told he said now I'm told that if we could pick up an instrument that could catch it he said talking about our man's voice she said when you speak he said I'm told you could get an instrument pick up an instrument I could catch it he said my voice that I speak today is now right and he's talking back in 1962 and he said my voice that I speak today he said ten thousand years from now he said you could still pick that up in the air he said it's like dropping a petal in the middle of a pond he said under teeny little waves after they failed to be seen by the eye he said they continued on until it hits the bank and the airwaves of our voice continually travels around around the world I said therefore then our voice he said then what we see he say will be our judgment oh so this very ties in any alarm is that we get to see now we're gone hallelujah can actually play back the tape of our lives because we think that it hasn't that always have stopped here but it will stop here it continues on somewhere else and God's instruments while at the end of the judgement picks up every word we've spoken in our natural lines and place it back for us in the judgment holiday that's all that's why it's so important what you say what are we talking about tonight if you shall say a man early on death and life lies in the power of the tongue is that right listen so let's listen to what he said you know he said now the airwaves continue on our voice continually travels around around the world is that an N or voice what we see will be our judgement or testimony will rise against us our own voices will echo in our own ears at the judgment bar of God a man or when it's great instrument catches every voice that's been spoke every word that's been muttered he many men that's why it's so careful man to see the right thing it's not right well it's not right me to think about that story with Jesus when that woman come before him and worship and was giving glory and say our daughter was vexed with the devil it's not right and she's a tuna and tolay he said woman is not fit to take the children's bread and cast it to dogs isn't that right but that woman stood her ground she stood right there because she had a need and she didn't let what he said disturb her spirit oh and she said Lord he's made this if it's sold and that's fine I'm ok with that but even the dogs could get the crumbs from ulta master's table and jesus said before this scene delivered it may you could see the right thing tonight or on an access the power of God your words could change the course of events your words could change what's happening here tonight well if you launch out and feed Lord John and believe something that you've never believed before only the quad is able to deliver God is able to restore rise up and claim it speak it sick pod is evil hallelujah I believe the word that's written in this book I believe the word that's written in this fiber oh god I'm coming off off coming after you Holly I'm coming for what's mine tonight comment for my joy coming for my peace coming for my blessing tonight Oh hallelujah let's see the right thing amen amen hallelujah amen gotta be careful hallelujah hallelujah a man your voice could change the course of the events no I was like marry a man and Lazarus was dead for days Jesus come back he said I could wake him he was there waiting there in a week and so on and they came to him said lord if you had been here my brother would not have done hallelujah but even sue holler even now longer you are able to do something you hallelujah you can restore right there with those words she changed the course of events she threw him into a case that I am the resurrection and the life hallelujah glory to God amen amen have somebody began to turn why because she said something hallelujah that stirred his faith she said something that registered in heaven but words didn't just affect what was happening unnatural her words went up up up hallelujah her faith went beyond a natural amen and that's what we want to do tonight and pray in faith and belief we want to say the right thing tonight hallelujah Hollywood see what is written in this book according to his word holily if he's able to do it he can do it hallelujah praise God but we've got to speak it and watch it take place amen amen have faith in God tonight if you shall say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart you can have whatever you ask for if we have faith as a mustard seed split around mountain tonight and it shall be because it's God's faith in you tonight Oh glory glory email a little more I'm finished Eman he said no he said no therefore voice he said what we see would be your judgment or testimony or rise against us or own voices will echo in our own ears Wow something huh a judgment bar of corn amen and when it's great instrument catches every voice has been spoke every word has been muttered and now he said there's only one way to stop that voice that's wrong he said and he said that's to repent amen amen hallelujah it's only one way to stop that voice those idle words that you spoke and those things that you said in your anger and in your jealousy or in your hatred there's only one way to stop that voice that's the blood of Jesus Christ when you repent hallelujah I say Lord I turn around I turn my mind around I turn my heart around I want to follow after you honey I repent in dust and ashes then God the blood goes after that voice and stops it from meeting you other judgments hollow and court play back the tape there's a blank spots there's a blank spots there's a blank spots I can't find it I can't find it she was delivered she was safe she was installed she was here only blind spots on tape glory many man praise God and then he puts his words in your mouth and any speakers were only men who God alone can't stop it and if it doesn't it goes on it meets up with you in eternity so therefore God being perfect and his voice eternal his own voice will have to catch up with it therefore he must be perfect in every decision but once he says something it has to go all the way and come right back to the judgment he had to speak it honey because it will it will it will confirm itself later on and that's why I believe he told him disciples on a little wine I will see me no more but you'll see me I'll send a comforter and he will come on that day you shall know I am in the father you and me and I knew what was he doing he was speaking the word over them knowing that his Spirit would come back when he changes form to the Son of God spirit he will come back upon them hallelujah amen and manifest the same word that he spoke to them back their holidays a greater and this I'll do that shall you do because I go unto my father what was he doing speaking the word over them Holly don't they were not prepared mentally to understand what he said yet he still had to
