saying God bless you we've been having a tremendous time in Mexico he said that brother oven has already preached two messages and they were mightily blessed to the people with many testimonies amen so we thank God for that this morning amen so the meetings are underway as we speak and also he said but as I've seen that he also preached last night and the message was a focus on the young people

and that's going to be at about six o'clock during that time will be that last service so we just remember them in our hearts I know Minds as they continue to uh you know minister to the people there and meet the needs there and it's nothing that we can really do in ourselves you know we the ministry has to yield themselves to the will of God to to to be a blessing you know and the more they yield themselves there's more God could use it amen for his honor and His glory but we just certainly want to remember them in prayer this morning as they continue on in the in the in the will of God and um praise God it now falls upon my lot this morning to anyway minister to you praise God Amen you never get used to this you know um because it's just it's such a serious thing to address the bride of Christ and so we never treat that casually and at least I don't treat it casually I should try not to sometime there's always the nerves there's always the same news from 10 years ago 15 years ago same news but I just have to you know stay in the spirit and heal to see what God will speak to us this morning I genuinely believe he has a word for us but today and that's what we seek to find the

Lord as we enter into the word now and to bless your people once more in Jesus name amen and amen praise God all right well let's tune to our Bibles now um I have three portions of scripture to read from book of Saint Matthew from also from Saint Matthew chapter 3. from Saint John chapter 3 and then also from Zechariah 4 6 and 7. so I'm actually going back to the Old Testament in the end but that's just how God showed to me amen so I just kind of go with that so you could just make a markup for Zechariah we'll go back there in the last but the first scripture we want to read from is saying Matthew chapter 3 and verse 11. amen um and it says and this is a John ministering to the people while he was baptizing them onto repentance right he said I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than I am whose shoes I am not worthy to bear he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire whose fan is in his hand and he will throw uh thoroughly Purge his floor and gather his wheat into the Ghana but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire and we know what the chaff is right that's that's the ungodly man like the chaff which the Wind Drive it away amen praise God but he's gonna gather his wheat and that's you and I this morning amen Saint John chapter 3. I want to read from verse 3 to 7. this is Jesus witness into Nicodemus familiar scripture but we want to just pull this out here this morning for our context see in John chapter 3 and verse 3. Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Nicodemus said unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born Jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I said unto thee ye must be born again amen praise and evil alone and uh Zechariah Chapter 4. amen the old Testament reading just six and seven and that should close us out here then he answered and speak unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubbabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts who are thou o great Mountain before zoruba Bell Thou shalt become a plane and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it may God add blessing to the reading of his wound let us pray one more time oh God any man could read the scriptures this morning but to take God and your spirit father to bring it to life Lord we heal ourselves now to the moving of your spirit we pray that your anointing would come down for a few moments and minister to our hearts and lives because we are so needy of you tonight and we admit that we don't know the way father won't you help us Lord teach us by a word an anoint us or Faith Lord to receive your promised word in these last times that we're living in blessed people now as we as we enter into the world's portion of service now in Jesus name amen and amen praise God you may be seated amen praise the name of the Lord so just for a title to this message that I have of my heart for this for today my title is the new birth my title is the new birth my subject is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and with fire my inspiration is but by my spirit amen but by my spirit not by might not by power how well is it going to be done it's going to be done by my spirit this is not the work of man but it is a work of the spirit it is not the Acts of the Apostles but it is the acts of the Holy Ghost in the apostles is how God wrought Miracles back in that new testament well back in that early church and we are looking to see another book of Acts in these last days we didn't come all this way just to occupy space we didn't come all this way and just to take up space in a church but we're gonna make a church that's gonna make a Revival we've got to because that's what Jesus died for so I'm here to put my shoulder to the wheel this morning for Revival how about you this morning are you convinced are you concerned about the times that we are living in but we know that the spirit is got to do it it's nothing about your mind nothing about your in your flesh it's no work of man but this is the work of the Holy Ghost this is a work the ministry of Jesus Christ in a people in the last days can somebody say amen glory to God so we are promised the ministry of the spirit to Quicken the word to the bride isn't that right not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts o Hallelujah all the spirit is going to do the work the spirit is going to mend Hearts the spirit is going to fix lives the spirit is going to anoint you the spirit is going to inspire you the spirit is going to fix what needs to be fixed it's not up to me this morning I'm just here to heal myself you're just here to yield yourself to the moving of the Holy Spirit and he is here this morning he knows your every need according to his riches in glory and he is able to supply your every need according to his riches in glory do you believe that this morning can you somebody say Amen hallelujah amen so let's get started so for hundreds of years Israel was without a prophet in the land isn't that right but when Jesus came on the earth his coming introduced a new season it's not right from the time of his birth God begins to do something Supernatural on the earth coming to from the announcement of John isn't that right coming all the way down to his peculiar birth God begins to move upon the Earth isn't that right God calls John out a separated one isn't that right named him John brother would like to say he didn't call him over dial or Zachariah Zephaniah oh hi guy he wasn't he wasn't a hubba hey he was not I don't know I said that he was just John oh that's all you get one crime in the wilderness the voice of one crime in the wilderness seem like nobody's listening seem like nobody cares but that was God's way of preparing away for his coming he used A peculiar man to prepare his way I love how God does things when God calls somebody he does it his way he calls his man the world calls it funny and and silly and daughter praise God but what God man calls foolish God calls wisdom and what God calls wisdom man calls foolish the Bible says my ways are higher than your ways and my thoughts are higher than your thoughts your thoughts will perish in a day but his thoughts are Eternal this morning they are from eternity to Eternity and when God thought about you this morning his thoughts were perfect his thoughts were finished Thy word O Lord is settled in heaven forever and in his thoughts he loved you in his thoughts he saw you anointed in his thoughts he saw you commissioned in his thoughts he saw you filled with the Holy Ghost in his thoughts he saw you crushing the devil under your feet he saw them Kings under your feet all the heads of them kings in the palm of your hand he saw you Victorious he saw you conquering or the Devil is a lion this morning because in God all things are possible and we are more and conquerors through him that loved us and what can separate us this morning from the love of God that stretch his arm wide on the cross he loved you and made a way for you to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and with fire a new badge in your soul somebody say Amen [Music] hallelujah oh glory to God oh Hallelujah friends we are coming into a season of the spirit season of the supernatural where the word all these years I've been laying on books and tapes it's gonna take on an effect it's gonna turn into spirit it's gonna turn into Supernatural and the devil will be crushed on the foot the devil will be broken against the power of the supernatural God oh I believe he's here this morning he's here to give you a baptism a glorious a wonderful baptism of the Holy Ghost and with fire I don't know what you did last night but the Holy Ghost is here I don't know what thoughts are in your mind but the Holy Ghost is here he is here to fill you he's here to restore you or somebody praise him this morning [Applause] Hallelujah Oh Glory Glory oh we feel the presence oh Hallelujah amen oh Hallelujah so I'm not going to tell you to sit or stand you just stay in the spirit amen you're gonna write a word I'm gonna see what God will do for us amen okay so he went forth baptizing the people isn't that right unto the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ until his announcement and so on isn't around until he appear before him he just kept on baptizing because that's what he was sent to do prepare away for this coming of the Lord Jesus he was baptizing the people in water and we know that God promised us in Scripture a baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire it's promised and it is unto you and to your children and as many as them are far off and as many as the Lord or God shall call he promised to claim the People by fire fire to burn the demons out to burn out everything and put God in the soul and make you a real Christian to make you to walk after his statues and to walk after these virtues he's gonna put that in you not by might not by power but by my spirit said the Lord of hosts who is this Green Mountain that stands in before you this morning Thou shalt become a plane and he shall bring forth a headstone or which shoutens nothing that we could have done but the grace of almighty God oh it won't be by that prayer but if God ever pours out his Spirit upon the church it'll be by the grace of almighty God can somebody say Amen hmm Hallelujah boring Hallelujah so is that the introduction of Jesus that this fire baptism is actually mentioned in John's Ministry as he is baptized in the people in water down at the Jordan it's not right for repentance and he asks John to identify himself some I'm told Pharisees went down to question his ministry it's not everyone who are the where you come from what what do we say about you and what did John do he gave them the word this is the scripture here Saint John 1 21. and they asked him what then adult Elias and he said I am not at all that prophet and he answered no and they said unto him that we may give an answer to them that sent us what's the power of thyself and he said I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness make straight the way of the Lord has said the prophet his eyes and day that was sent was sent out of Pharisees so that's right and they asked him and said unto him why baptize it thou then if thou be not that Christ or Elias neither that prophet and John answered them saying I baptize with water but there's time that one among you so he's already here if you think he's that he's about to be born he's already on the earth oh hell he's already standing among you whom you know not oh this morning you better be on expectation he's standing among you you may not see him with your natural eye but prophecy is about to be fulfilled it's about to switch from the prophet to his prophecy he's already standing among you you better get ready this morning you better get your heart right get your eyes lifted up towards heaven and let your pants legs be bragged at the knees and keep on praying until this one that standeth among you oh he also John said he's going to do here it is Who coming after me is preferred before me whose shoes lasted I am not worthy to unloose he's gonna baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire oh hallelujah hallelujah do you believe it amen let me read somebody having a prophet Amen on the sadism Church h Prophet said Satan is the greatest sophist amen I looked up the word surface it actually means a person who reasons with clever but false arguments so he's a debater he liked to argue he like to just ask a question with the purpose of provocation to Pro hook well what about this huh does that sound familiar you shall not surely die Same Spirit got it so but Prophet said Satan is the greatest sophist and he has never been overcome wow in a Strife of words hear it in Divine service the words of man are usually heard more than the word of God each one Chatters as he pleases or kills time I like that by learning disquisitions and disproving the views of others argumentative of the new birth the prophet said and how a man must be changed into the likeness of Christ to become a partaker of the divine nature II Peter 1 4. scarcely anything is said isn't that time like we've come to a condition today where of the new but and how a man must be changed into the likeness of Jesus Christ all man must be born again received the baptism of the Holy Ghost the prophet said you can't shake hands into the into the church you can write your name down on a book and become a member of this body that's not how you become a member of this body you become a member of this body by that same Spirit has to come into you you've got to be born again to be a member of the True Church of God not the Church of man-made but the true church the born Church the Holy Ghost filled Church the Spirit-filled church is a church filled with Spirit-filled individuals Spirit-filled people so I didn't come here this morning to write my name down on a book or to look for a favorite parking space that's not what I'm here for I'm here to receive the same Penny the same Holy Ghost The Same Spirit that Peter received on the day of Pentecost the same holy ghost that Mary received and all those Devils went out of her that same Holy Ghost has got to come into you you've got to be born again oh or outside of that you are just playing Church you're just dressing up and looking nice to come to a nice building and shake hands but I don't believe God sent a prophet 50 plus years in this message for us to just take up space for us to just shake hands and for us to just go home but I came to meet God I came to get into contact with something Supernatural I'm fed up of myself I need a change I need a manifested reality of the abiding kind of Glory in my soul I want it I need it my husband needed my wife needed my family need it is that the way you feel this

Burn Out the Devil Lord hallelujah God's gonna get the victory or somebody save it [Music] [Applause] I want it I need it Hallelujah [Music] oh my God so the prophet is saying here about this new bird scarcely anything is being said that's a disturbing thing shut up means they've intellectualized it come down to our knowledge thing who know more than who who reads more scripture more than who that ain't the point that is not what Jesus died for [Applause] died so that we could come into this image that's what he died for he was tortured beaten and bruised to make a way for you to come to perfection foreign [Applause] tried to keep this from you but we're gonna speak it seven Thunders are the seven voices of the seven Church Ages which are seven manifestations of one Holy Spirit into you as to take a live voice virtual live voice knowledge of live voice tempering to live voice patience to live voice godliness will live voice brutally kindness or live voice and when God sees all them virtues in you he drops down charity that Capstone of love to make you a complete and sealed unit of Jesus Christ and that is the servant of God that goes into the rapture oh Hallelujah oh no wonder the pyramid has never capped God is waiting on you to come down in this last age and cap you off and bring up the dead in Christ the Perfection will be the reflection amen really Perfection oh my all right well so Prophet goes on he said church has almost lost a power binding only the power of losing remain the sacraments given us symbols of unity and love and all life in Christ have made the occasion of bitterest conflict a cause of mutual hatred a center of sectarianism different sects different foreign factions wow Mercy in short he said Christendom or Christianity has become a labyrinth a puzzle and the faith has been split into a thousand little parts and you are made a heretic if there is one of them that you don't accept yeah it'll make you odds it's not right our Oddball so what can help only the one thing needful Prophet said Return to Christ and that's what we want to do this morning turn Eyes Upon Jesus and look full into his wonderful face and receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost on Fire let him change us when Moses came down from the mountain it was noticeable his countenance was different his face Shone with the glory of God he looked like somebody who finally had it all figured out and it only took five minutes [Applause] for 40 years in the wilderness questions questions but one uh experience in the fire and he come out different and that's what we want this morning that's what the young people need that's what the calebs did that's what we all need this morning to throw us in the fire oh Hallelujah experience in the fire where a man meets God and he's changed forever oh Hallelujah they brought the people to seminaries to Creeds to dogmas they bring the people to church but the people need to meet God they need to meet their same Jesus Oh hallelujah's shoes who are we are worthy praise God hallelujah hallelujah Bruce and Afflicted tormenting transgressions chastisement of his peace was upon us by his stripes we were healed oh hallelujah hallelujah amen all right let me carry on here now so what can help one thing needful return to Christ look into Christ as the only leader walking in his footsteps setting aside all other ways until we reach the goal and have come to the unity of the faith according to Ephesians 4 13. now here what Paul says in the New Testament concerning this he said and I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and by speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of men's wisdom but in the demonstration of the spirit and of power and that your faith should stand not in the wisdom of men but in the power of God oh that's where we stand this morning not on the wisdom of man but in the God's power to transform or in God's power Hallelujah the power of God unto salvation amen that's where we stand this morning all right in adoption 1916 Prophet said but the Believers the Caleb and Joshua outfit the Caleb and Joshua outfit your man look like smell like amen that was going on to the promise he said they moved over into the land and they took the land and they settled down in the land isn't that right amen as a possession he said and we never stop a justification or a signification he said let's go on to the baptism of the Holy Spirit let's not stop Hallelujah I believe it on Lord Jesus and being baptized let's not stop just because he cleansed us from a life of sin but now we press on into a position oh Hallelujah to a promise of the baptism of the Holy Ghost for Peter said on the day of Pentecost for This Promise is unto you and to your children and to them that's a power off and even as many as the Lord oh God shall call how that God had set some in a church through their labor pains or they get tremendous sometimes but when a church is grown in under the persecution of the outside world Believing on the Lord Jesus that the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as real is it just as real this morning as it was on the day of Pentecost how they grow own and cry on the labor pains but when listen oh Hallelujah but when they are born and positionally porn into the kingdom of God then the Holy Ghost not a man not a seminary not an association but when the Holy Ghost had set in a church saw Apostles some prophets some teachers some pastors some evangelists oh Hallelujah God's Gonna Give You a Ministry when the Holy Ghost when I've shame Holy Ghost horns in you are new oh Hallelujah so we got to believe this morning that that same Holy Ghost is just as real as it was on a day of Pentecost other than that we are Slackers this morning we are playing church and God is Not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but he wants to give it to you he wants to fill your life with the power of the Holy Ghost more than you even know how to receive it but we're here to preacher this morning we had to speak it over you you're gonna receive it you're gonna receive your anointing for your day just as David was anointing no devil could stop it oh and no devil could stop your anointing this morning God wants upon you upon you oh Hallelujah oh honey lift up your hands lift up your head oh open up your cage and let the king of glory come in and fill you with his presence Hallelujah poor man [Applause] Oh Glory let's hurry on Amen hey Hallelujah oh I feel the Holy Spirit write the anointing ride it ride it praise God hallelujah when I was this morning I didn't have no doubt oh I know the Lord was gonna bring us out I know he's gonna make a way not by much not by power but by my spirit things might be messed up right now but there's nothing that's too messed up that God can't fix there's nothing that got too broken that God can mend back he can mend a broken heart he can anoint you he can inspire you he can give you something a new birth he's not gonna replace you but he's gonna do something new inside of you give you a reboot a new operating system hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah a renovation of the inside inside many many [Applause] oh that's what we come for to be changed oh Hallelujah [Applause] amen [Applause] oh we're going to see content for the fake 1953 Prophet said here now how marvelous earnestly contended for the feet that was once delivered to the sins that's what they're doing today amen all back in the age now the very faith that he had at the beginning it's supposed to be today yet a very fine scholar he said I was having a dinner with here some time ago you name them Eastern Jones He said that brother Branham said he said he said I see most of your meeting is made up of Pentecostal people he said well yes sir and the brother said well why so he said well they're the ones that believe and he said well he said he said I think that Pentecost was a scaffold like a scaffold inside of a building you know just just outer shell and he said that God was going to put up a building the brother still explaining he said so this is his understanding of it I guess Brothers explaining he said that God was going to put up a building and he caused the sky said well and he said but we'll see after the scaffold work is done we don't need the scaffold anymore he said but the scaffold work isn't done he said when the building is completed then God Will Take It Up he said so we're still working on the building and if we're still working on the building we need a scaffold is that yes sir the prophet said we still need every stepladder every step in stone so you see people get caught up they get caught up in something and they want to count people out you know Jesus called Peter James and John up on the hill mount Transfiguration it's all glory and lights all of a sudden they want to build three Tabernacle Peter's official fish for a pretty long time as far as I know I don't know him to be a construction worker so he wants to build three tablet you see what I'm saying so people get caught up in the flesh thing and because want to count people out because they found something here now I don't want to kick kick you know kind of discount others just get caught up in themselves shall we call on fire like Elijah did huh because they're not moving at us you see that same thing see it super Prophet said yes sir we still need a every stepladder every stepping stone we need everything just exactly the building is still in the making yeah yeah and when it's completed this gospel is to be preached to every Kindred tongue and Nation and then Jesus will return that's right he said now we've had plenty of passing out of tracks and theology around the world but the gospel is not the Bible altogether the Bible Paul said that the gospel came to us not in word only but through Power and demonstrations of the Holy Ghost and then when Jesus said go into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature then he meant go into all the world and demonstrate the power of God to Every Creature oh so this gospel is not in word only but it's in power and demonstration out there oh Hallelujah going out into the world oh hallelujah hallelujah and whosoever will let them come pray God God seed out there they may be in different places different groups or whatever but when that David takes the rock of the Revelation Hallelujah and smashes it into Goliath's forehead the Sheep of God will come screaming out out of every group out of every nation out of every tunnel are aware of a goal Forge into all the world and preach the gospel hey many many men and let them know who Jesus is amen then they'll come out you see praise God it's about the people it's the organizations that get mixed up you see Pentecost been spewed out on the mount the organization praise God because they misconstrue the word praise God but there's genuine seeds out there that God's going to save and deliver and redeem we don't know who they are praise God but wait we want to be the body of Christ and if God has a body then why is his hands not reaching why is his eyes not seeing why is his mouth not speaking means we need to be under con the Supreme control of God so that when he wants to move he can move with us oh and the spirit needs to move he can move and touch somebody and heal somebody and pray for somebody and enter into somebody's suffering to have forgiveness to have kindness to have patience to have Temperance with your brother knowing what's in their hearts going with them the extra mile doing whatever it takes on suffering that none should be lost oh Hallelujah that's what it's all about praise God Amen oh Hallelujah amen it's not right so in order to preach a gospel before you can make it a gospel preach then you have to have the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit to prove the gospel the letter kill it the word the letter kill it but the spirit make it alive so we need the spirit this morning we've had the word for over 50 years in this message but what we need is a spirit to make that word live otherwise we just be a nice Christians or a nice church or group of people coming together but where is the spirit oh we need the spirit of God to make the thing work we need put too much stress on the mechanics but not enough on the Dynamics the thing that pulse hates it the things that makes it move we need Jesus in every heart in every life and in every soul to make the world live and then you'll see real Christianity then you'll see people really forgiving from their heart really to in the work of God really living really reaching out really doing all it takes Hallelujah whoa Glory Glory Glory outside of that we just occupying time amen but we need a manifestation and God promised it and we're here to wait for it until he send it we can't go on our own minds we can't go on our own feelings we can't go with a little sprinkle or a shower that is not what our Bible tells me he tells me in those days he told us he'll pour out his Spirit upon All Flesh All Flesh o code preach the gospel to Every Creature such as would be saved or upon All Flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy young man shall or seat Visions all men are gonna dream dreams the gospel is gonna be preached and then the end shall come oh don't look for the end from Putin or from Biden or from somebody else no no this gospel must be preached in power and in demonstration of the Holy Ghost when you see the sick being here when you see the blind eyes opening up when you see people will be in one by one baptized into the kingdom of God coming down from off the mountain with power and demonstrations proven the adoption that is upon them then we are ready for the Rapture and not before God's gonna have a church that's going to beat the devil running before the resurrection before the resurrection you're gonna be filled you're gonna be sealed you're gonna be healed every bone in your body every five of your body will be here you're gonna be renewed regenerated God's gonna have a church Hallelujah praise oh that's your promise this morning claim it believe it receive it not by might not by power but by my spirit say the Lord of hosts God's Gonna cap the pyramid and he's gonna use you to do it you're gonna catch that stone you will procrastinated to catch that stole Hallelujah Hallelujah Glory oh my God Oh Glory so it's not just a ritualistic affair but it's absolutely a real living reality of the resurrection of Jesus Christ living among men he said and that's a fate I'm trying my best to contend for today that God Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever and his power is unlimited unlimited power oh we limit God by our minds but God is unlimited just let your faith release tonight and how big your fate is our big expectation is is what God can use it's what God can feel is what God can appreciate all other than manifest his love to you this morning or somebody worship Him somebody praising Hallelujah oh man let me hurry on here I think we got the message amen I think we got the message right oh my Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah Psalms 104 verse 1 to 4 says blessed the Lord bless the Lord oh my soul oh Lord my God very great Thou Art clothed with honor and Majesty who covered thyself with light as a comment who stretches out the heavens like a curtain who laid the beams of his Chambers in the waters who make the clouds as Chariot who walk it upon the wings of the wind this is my Jesus he walks upon the wings of the wind wherever the wind blows there's his Spirit oh how you don't know where it come from and you don't know where going he is very mysterious he walks upon the wings of the wind hallelujah oh and the enemy come like a flood the spirit of God raises up a standard against him he's raising a standard this morning a standard in your life don't you be afraid [Applause] says to make it his Angel Spirits his ministers a flame of fire Angelic Spirits we come into Angelic beings oh we're gonna come into that season oh hallelujah we're presentation of angels come and take your minister to you The Heirs of Salvation because of who you are Abraham shall I hide from Abraham what I'm about to do because he's heir of the earth and because of who you are this morning God cannot hide from you what he's about to do he's about to destroy it but before he does it there's a ceiling Angel having a seal of God to go forth and to seal the predestinated into the kingdom of God he is the incorator he is the white horse rider he is the Holy Spirit and he is here this morning to see fill you up before the great and terrible day of gone before the day of Vengeance he's gonna fill you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and with fire Hallelujah oh my God hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Ephesians 1 13. in whom he also trusted after that he had heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also that ye believed you were sealed with that Holy Spirit a promise the prophet said Angelic beings associate together oh I hope you get that he said if you got the holy spirit in you then you are candidate for associations with the Unseen World and the supernatural oh Hallelujah you become a member a candidate of the citizen of the kingdom of God and God could put his hand on you and say son of man what's Siesta oh hallelujah hallelujah God's gonna have a church God's gonna have a people God wants you this morning he wants to put his hand on you he led he lit he laid his hand on me I once was blessed but now I see her when Jesus when Jesus when Jesus when Jesus [Applause] he said no wonder people can't believe in those things they never come into contact they got nothing in here to believe it with but when the Holy Spirit comes into the heart quickly he becomes a twofold being one on the earth to die and you are one of Heaven to live oh hallelujah oh he picks something new in you it's a new bird oh Hallelujah in his body he might be still subject to death but in his soul Prophet said he passed from Death on to life in his body he has Earthly contact with five senses but in his Spirit he has contact with God through the Holy Ghost oh you become a China to which God could flow no wonder he said I am the vine you are the branches the branches can bear Putin itself but you gotta be connected to the vine and when you are connected to Divine and you are bringing forth fruits God could use you to heal somebody God could use you to deliver somebody God could use you to speak to somebody because you are connected to Divine by the baptism of the holy spirit in your soul Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh my do you love him whoa it's going good hey man we're going good all right amen all right so praise God too here's Rihanna and the angels of God visits them visit you speaks with you he said speaks with them meaning you hey man I'm I'm placing you I'm putting you in the word amen he says speaks with them I'm speaking with you amen Angels speaks with them and they are messengers sent from God to reveal and to bring messages from God to the individual he's out to get first thing to get the first thing you can't put the cupola on before the foundation is lead see so we got to remember that put the first things first you must be born again then we could build this after that the Holy Ghost come upon you you could make yourself a Christian or do you see it now the foundation got to be lame first things first so seek ye the kingdom freaky first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these other things shall be added unto you but Abraham said I'm be not afraid he said as David dupless said one time he said God has no grandchildren that's right he said we getting too many grandchildren in Pentecost that's right God doesn't have a grandchild nowhere in the Bible says God has a grandchild God has sons and daughters but not grandchildren Oh I thought no second generation no no all our sons all must be rebuked all must be corrected all of us gotta be straightened out and all of us have got to receive that same penny that same Holy Spirit a promise oh Hallelujah you've got to receive it because you are his daughter because you are his son you're going to receive your personal presentation oh believe it this morning walk in it this morning say it speak it anointed to yourself oh that promise is coming oh just shows anything it's coming this morning so don't be afraid let the devil get you all caught up in your mind in your human spirit it's easy because we connected there please go we had to go to work we have to do this to do that but remember the promise that he made hallelujah oh I remember the promise praise God because we can hold him to he's obligated to fulfill his promise word isn't that right all right he said go to another grandchild no end the Bible says God has grandchildren he's not no what it is now the First Methodist Revival they were Sons and Daughters of God and then there he said the old time was brought in their children and just put them in the Methodist Church that's exactly what the Pentecostals had done he said what is it the old timers that used to pray all night long the old-timers that had real real genuine salvation they come in the Pentecost they got the Holy Ghost they brought their children and put them on the cradle and roll them down there and the first thing you know we got grandchildren in Pentecost oh so they didn't come through the same boat that the old timers did that's how you end up with grandchildren all right so it can't be just joined in church everybody got to come to that same door oh you got to be wearing the same garments oh the same wedding garment oh not because daddy did it not because Mommy did it means you gonna just come in praise God that's not how it works oh you got to meet the same Jesus that they met you got to have your own personal experience like they had you've got to get into contact with the Holy Ghost with the god that created you you got to go back to the manufacturer get back in contact with the god that made you you were fearfully and wondering wonderfully made God Made You for a purpose and only his Spirit only his life could work in you only his life could work in this bride that's why we'll never be satisfied with what the world has to offer because there's something else out there that is calling me there's a real Spirit a real anointing oh a new bit and I've got to have it this morning hallelujah oh my see the Old Times by the children and right likely it's component now and they're all they all everyone born into his kingdom Sons and Daughters of God Amen Sons and Daughters not grandchildren God don't have any they are all sons and daughters he said and that's why today the message blinds the people so much because they're not used to seeing the supernatural wow there's a profit scene he said we need the power of God we need back to real Pentecost as Billy Graham said recently you can't ignore the Pentecostal church because the fastest moving church today and so forth it gives you things he gives a uh the reason why amen isn't that right Pentecostal is you know they're adding and so forth like that right he said okay he said that's right she's gone he said uh he said wow you can't stop it he said the Pentecost church is still making the front line he said why you can't stop it that's right God ordained it and she's gone he said but when she gets to a place when she goes uh to bringing in grandchildren and adopting and taking up the things of the world God will move right out and there'll be another group take it and go right on oh I believe that's you this morning am I take it and go right on that genuine experience amen that kind of blessing like what better get into singing this morning amen no one that's safe that seals that satisfies your soul amen amen hallelujah that's what we want this morning amen we can't stop it in the rain so go to move right now and he said uh he said that's right there'll be another group ticket and go right on that's right so get back to the fire alarm brother he said stay under the anointing let nothing bother you oh Hallelujah stay under the anointing stay in the atmosphere stay in the presence of God the devil is going to try to fight you out of there you fight your way back in praise God hallelujah it's dead to be outside of the presence of God you fight your way press your way the kingdom of God is preach and every man every woman every child got a prostate away into that Kingdom you're not gonna get it on a silver platter you can't get it on our app on your phone you gotta press press fight into this Holy Ghost Land Of Promise Hallelujah Oh my he said no today we're living in the last day when we see that capping off of the pyramid that stone that was rejected out of the pyramid they never did find out why that the Cornerstone was rejected in the temple but they can't find the stone that would fit it but now as she begins to hit to the top each one of these Stones coming up from Luther methodists Pentecost then the church will have to get into such a place when the real headstone comes that it'll fit right joint by join together with it oh so that's what we're doing this morning line upon line press up upon precept we are coming into a place that The Headstone could come down and fit right into it joint by joint oh Hallelujah glory to God Amen said the church will have to have the spirit of God in it so much until the spirit will be doing the same works that Jesus did when he was here on Earth that means you are gonna be so drenched so immersed so punk in the spirit that you're gonna do the same works the same signs same one us same Miracles same Holy Ghost works it's gonna be upon you or upon your children wait for it it shall surely come to pass oh I'm so excited this morning it could happen any minute it can happen right now oh it can happen today they were in the upper room and they were all praying in his name they were praising and worshiping until all of a sudden that same Jesus that same Spirit dropped down upon them give each one their portion each one their lick on fire baptism baptism baptism after baptism anointing when save after wave crushing the enemy pushing out the devil putting the Holy Ghost in they were dry seeds but when the Holy Ghost come in they were germanized they were anointed that's what we're looking for this morning oh keep on fighting Hallelujah glory to God Amen stay under the anointing let nothing bother you say we're living in the last day isn't that right Hallelujah I said watch his hair I'll read this quick and then move on Pentecost is not just an organization he said Pentecost is an experience that anyone can have it's a called out a church an elected group small he said look in the days of Sodom there was great preachers went into Sodom to preach and they preached a message down there but one stayed back and performed the signs in this little bitty Church a minority watch the signs it's done and Jesus said the same thing would repeat to the Gentiles in this last day and here it is oh holiday what was the Holy Ghost given for Prophet said that's what the Holy Ghost is is to make you a citizen of the kingdom of God then if you're a citizen of the kingdom of God how does it make you act like God acts in his kingdom what does God do in his kingdom it is Holiness it is righteousness it is purity of thought purity of mind power and love going out to the Lost Healing The Sick performing Miracles doing great things oh Hallelujah oh that's what we're looking for and if we don't have that then we are pressing on to that until we see that Comfort we are not satisfied we will not rest we will not stop we will not stay back we will not be silent until we make a church that's gonna make a Revival that people will come flying in here and say the seventh on us that are not even written is being made manifest hallelujah oh go tell John the sicker here go tell John the blouse here go tell John go tell John the ministry of Jesus Christ is on the earth now making her brighter at it for the going home for the Rapture oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Oh Glory Glory woman he said then to the world you look crazy we look crazy this morning jump a bunch of people jumping shouting screaming praise God but we know what we're going to receive back alone just make me excited that alone make me smile when I wake up praise God I'm gonna get it you're gonna get it hallelujah oh you're gonna feel what Peter felt 50 miles an elbow room oh the holy ghost in the heart of the human praise God oh that's your promise believe it expected receive it speak it stay in that atmosphere don't let nobody shake it on the money pull you away praise God hallelujah hallelujah oh man to the world you look crazy them say them guys are off their head see but you are a citizen of the Kingdom what looks foolish the man is the wisdom of God oh we worship in a way that's called heresy oh and let them say what they want to say they call me whatever you want to call me just don't call me late for the Rapture I wanna be there between six and nine in the morning with my ticket in my hand like a laundry man or the other half up there oh Hallelujah hey man oh my God oh let me hurry on running late all right one more scripture if you want to write it down Saint John 12 24 I said let me go to jail quick Jesus said if a corner wheat falls into the ground and die except it die it cannot bring forth another life now look one more remark he said and remember it's absolutely no to you absolutely essential unnecessary and compelling and compulsory that you receive the Holy Ghost now for if you don't you can't come in the resurrection he said now watch your glory oh that's serious oh that's not cornflakes you can't come in a resurrection if you don't have the Holy Ghost that's what the prophet said he said now watch you cannot break God cannot break his laws he said we know that he has to follow his laws amen isn't that right I never greet him a wheat will take like Jesus out there corn in the Bible just reading it today flocks any kind of seed or whatever right he said it's a corn but when the corn falls into the ground now he said there's all of us here has know what has happened a corner of wheat or a grain of corn can look as perfect as it can be but when you put it in the ground if that corn it has a Perpetual life he said it'll go down today and it will reproduce itself in a stalk and come back and down and go up again and come back down it's perpetual life and if that corn hasn't got a germ of life in it no matter how beautiful it looks it'll never raise it'll go into the ground and just rot and that's it part of it the materials can be used for fertilizing things but as far as it's never living again it'll never live until it's God Perpetual life eternal life in it he said anyone knows that amen efficient uh Romans 8 14 for as many as I led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for we are not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but we have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Our Father the spirit itself parrot witness with our spirit that we are the children of God I'm looking this morning for the spirit itself to come down and tell you who you are that you are predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son the spirit itself is gonna let you know that you are Son of God when he fills you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost Empire and dramatizes that seed or our predestination in you Hallelujah Oh Glory hey many men do you believe it this morning amen and now we know that Ephesians parallel Joshua is not right and when the children of Israel is getting ready to take the land the God had promised to their father that he would give them he had dare to go through a process isn't that right Joshua 5. I'm not going to read this out quick and it came to pass when all the kings of the amorites which are on the side of Jordan Westwood and all of the kings of the Canaanites which are by the sea heard that the Lord had dried up the Waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel when the Kings heard a report until they were Passover that their heart melted the devil's heart is gonna melt one of these days when you come forth in power when you step out of the pages of this Bible and you begin to conquer your land just to hear the report oh are they gonna be in a tizzier but it'll be them seven Thunder Sons coming forth in power come important sweetness come important humility conquering as they go oh Joel's Army will be on the Move I'm looking for this morning that's what's locked up in each and every one of you this morning I believe in Hollywood of fact Hallelujah Oh Glory I know it praise God Amen you might not think much of yourself but your Mighty Man of Allah God said so amen praise God hallelujah oh man except from before the children their heart melted neither was there spirit in them anymore because of the children of Israel oh just a report alone conquer the enemy and they know what to expect and at that time the Lord said unto Joshua make thee sharp dance and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time and Joshua made him sharp knives and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the four skins they went forth a circumcision when they had come in isn't that right and he said and this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise all the people that came out of Egypt that were males even the men of War died in the wilderness by the way after they came out of Egypt and they said now all the people that came out were circumcised but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt then they had not circumcised for the children of Israel walked 40 years in the wilderness till all the people that were the men of War which came out of Egypt were consumed because they obeyed not the voice of God unto whom the Lord swear that he would not show them the land which the Lord swam to their party that he would give us a land flowed with milk and honey so there's got to come forth a circumcision after 40 years in this message we've got a new crop this morning that has not yet tasted of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire of the circumcision of the heart we need another gilchal need another hell of the foreskins we need Joshua the Holy Spirit to take a sharp knife and go to the camp this morning and begin to circumcise the hearts one by one you're gonna be circumcised oh hallelujah hallelujah before you begin to possess your Mountain before you begin to possess the enemy's Gates there's got to be a circumcision go forth in this message in this season in this time oh the word of God is declaring it hallelujah oh man and their children who we raised up in their stead them Joshua circumcised oh hallelujah hallelujah I thought they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised them by the way and it came to pass when they had done circumcising all the people that they are bored in their places in the camp until they were whole and then the Lord said unto Joshua this day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off of you where of the name of that place today is called gilgal and the children of Israel and Captain gilgar and kept the Passover on the 14th day of the month at The Plains of Jericho and they did eat of the old corn of the land on the

this angel of Light remember the last angel I'm hurrying down here now is the angel in the churches to the loudest here it's the loudest and messenger that is because it's the last because the very next chapter is the 19th Chapter which is the coming of the Bride so you talk more Revelation right so okay he said and this is the scripture and the last angel that came to bring light before the coming of the Bride to go out to meet Christ it was a loud decent Church age then what was allowedition church age messenger calling them out of Babylon look churches caught in their cage with her but
