[35:53] leader musician son daughter of God such
[35:57] a responsibility sometimes goes
[35:59] unappreciated or I shouldn't say that we

[36:07] not just like they born and you get a
[36:09] degree in motherhood

[36:13] best that's all I see it well it might
[36:17] be the exact way she's supposed to be
[36:19] I'll compare the other mothers but she
[36:21] tries her best with the tools given to
[36:24] her we just trust God for His mercies
[36:26] that give us the opportunity to be what

[1:35:23] about
[1:35:24] Amon my leman so we talked about
[1:35:28] overcoming what is overcoming to
[1:35:31] overcome definition is to defeat another
[1:35:34] in a competition or conflict to surmount
[1:35:38] the opposition and to be victorious so
[1:35:42] we know it's not against flesh and blood
[1:35:44] but again take it against principalities
[1:35:46] and it's against powers against the
[1:35:49] rulers of the darkness of this world
[1:35:51] against spiritual wickedness in high
[1:35:54] places
[1:35:55] so Allah the devil does not want you to
[1:35:57] know who you really are
