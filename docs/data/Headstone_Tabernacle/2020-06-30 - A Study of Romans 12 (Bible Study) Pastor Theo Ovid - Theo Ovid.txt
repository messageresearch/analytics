learning thank you you're hearing me no let's talk it nobody airing my voice was sealed a while ago on you break the seal off you could hear what I'm saying right and you know we thank God for His grace and mercy and his love and you recognize the spirits at work right Trinidad no China come out and something happen like this all of a sudden overnight what has happened what happened last night what happened and it just takes some you move some action something like that it changes everything and just as in the natural thing could happen overnight in this spiritual change could happen overnight for you this is what you have to believe so tonight I'll be taking this Bible study tonight I really appreciate the what but I is eckle done for the last couple of sessions and it falls my lot to take tonight tonight I want to take a study of Romans chapter 12 you have to find it here because I want to read a scripture before that I want to read a scripture from Luke chapter 23 and verse 30 sheet of 46 if you have your Bibles you could turn to it Luke chapter 23 verse 33 to 46 and when we come into the Bible study night walk with your Bibles have your Bibles okay walk with a man and really from verse 33 of Luke 23 and when they would come to the place which is called Calvary dear they crucified Him and the malefactors one on the right hand the other on the left then said Jesus Father forgive them for they know not what they do and they parted his raiment and cast lots the people stood beholding and the rulers also with them derided him saying he saved others let him save himself if he be Christ the chosen of God and the soldiers also mocked him coming to him or fail him vinegar and saying if thou be the King of the Jews save thyself and the superscription also was written over him in letters of greek latin and hebrew this is the king of the jews and one of the malefactors which were hanged real on him saying if thou be Christ see thy service the other answering rebuked him saying thou shalt not fear God seeing thou at the scene of the same condemnation and we indeed justly for what we received through Jewry what our deeds if this man had done nothing amiss and he said unto Jesus Lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom and Jesus said unto Him verily I say unto thee today thou shalt be with me in paradise and it was about a sixth hour there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour your Sun was darkened and the reveal of the temple was rent in the midst and when Jesus had cried with a loud voice he said father into thy hands I commend my spirit and having said this he give up the ghost let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you tonight for your word and for your truth and say your people got it here tonight and how I appreciate the fact that it would come to hear your word and there's always them a blessing to hear it to read it to study it God and I thank you and I pray that you would give revelation inspiration a most of all activate deep desire and thirst in every heart here tonight granted Lord in Jesus name I ask I background what I wanted to sketch a night with this scripture of Jesus died on Calvary I want to ask you a question do you realize that you have to die I don't mean just like from a figurative like you know the other day I'm gonna die I really like not not done Jesus actually died he actually died to pay the price to redeem us I want you to think about it tonight sometimes we forget that we be more caught up in where Christians being Church we go to church we had a wooden board but the reality is this whole thing about church I'm going to church and hear a new word and that word is restorative because in the beginning was he would we fell from the word we have to go back to the word in order to be truly Britain into God that's why Jesse I must be born again but I want you to catch it that you have to die and die means of giving up a separation god I would that religion that is actually a separation death that is actually you being cut off cut off from what you think would feel what your ideas your life cut off as what that is about and some of us we don't like pain oh but he likes pain but that is painful and that is hard Jesus cried my god Wilder forsaken me he didn't know it was dead it was painful and if his ship from dead to Groot Groot is also people to really grow Easter day but about him said it is rare yet to let go the first boots that kept the second pull let go to second put to get the triple many times we don't want to let go we don't want to go past he pass in that sense when to hold on you want out something we could rock back on this life of feet is a life of real dying finally the Lord and finalists will but Paul said this ring deletions 20 I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not i but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me and poor could see that and he can recognize and realize that Paul is talking about it from a personal position for he give himself for me who loved me and gave himself for me do you realize it was the love of God that drove Jesus to Calvary the love of God in his heart to pay the price for us to be here tonight in this room for us to have access to mercy for us to access a success his blood and his spirit so I want to challenge you tonight that there's a debt that we all have to deal with a debt to self Dino to own cells own ambitions or teas or ideas sometime there's a freeze America and not depta bad self that took good cells and that is where we have to graduate to and come to that we want to see like tube and all the other brothers who came in the presence I hate myself and the best of our works the best of all behavior in God's presence truly if we are nothing and this is the place I think we have to come to you know sometimes I hear different preachers preach and one of the things that I look for and sermons or in messages is if there is anything about across what Calvary about dying out about debt to self these are cues for me in in looking at us women because if we see on just the intellectual level of information and just what is like revelation or we call revelation and it doesn't affect your behavior it doesn't bring about a change something is not right something is wrong so this exhortation or scripture teaching or study tonight is to assist in adjusting or attitudes because the attitude is what will make the difference in how we approach life how we approach things around us we could feel we could fall not because you want to feel I want to fall but it happens but again is your attitude in your feeling of falling this stiff on the cross I'm talking about the one that say Lord remember me it didn't absolve him for all his teeth and behavior and all his body crows he knew he was paying a price for his deeds but you know what his attitude made such a difference these are two tears two teams on the same level who did I'm skillful in order breaking hoses pick locks this is the alternative employment what he calls it they got caught they were judged both of them and one decide with that mount the burr Isaac spoke about some time ago one deciders say no you say what I save save us - save yourselves and the other decided to reboot that one and we he said of this thing but that man don't remember me and Jesus told him what all you mean baptized in Jesus name we wrote attended one church service without being ministers to some faithful or past or future evangelist he said today he with me the attitude ask you tonight towards the wood words correction towards rebukes towards disappointment you may be disappointed how does that compare with somebody who is in physical pain you are disappointed about something your hands and tuck your feet and tuck your eyes and tuck your ears in time your whole body is fine you can raise up your hands good your people can't raise up their hands good because their hands in pain how does that compare let us go into romance no Rubens twelve just fully Bibles a student for almost twelve I want to read from this one you I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service no let's pause right there keep your hands right there because we Google no new scriptures normally sacrifice like that things you kill the lamb to kill the goat you kill the ox is dead but God call us to be a living sacrifice I want you to connect that with Paul seeing I'd ideally it's a debt it's not you getting quoted or with Christianity I can take a paint and you're blessed and you know you won't grow to be in your business or your fears or your school or whatever it is but dice as far as you want to me yes me blessing you you don't want to seek his will it can't be like that this scripture here about living sacrifice resent in your bodies acceptable to God this deals completely unholy with sanctification and sanctification is the Liebherr part or the works part that you do to show your appreciation to God for what God has done for you this is what this is about right this verse here is a key to your blessing I beseech you I beg you to present your bodies a living sacrifice because righteousness could be done in your body and so is also sin the devil's job is to keep you in sin which is unbelief so that you are trapped not by the devil but by your decisions and actions and what is wrought in your own body No you heard by Isaac speak about that you could really see the right thing and please the Holy Spirit and those brothers who said let us go and testify to that lady who aunt Ella aunt Ella we are saved that please the Holy Spirit that please the Holy Spirit do we ever think what we see and you who it pleases or is it that we just please ourselves this is where we have to shift and change your thinking this here I wanted to see it as a requirement of God that you present yourself a living sacrifice not the preacher you into that not you are forced into that you have to be able to present yourself they'll always be sexy dressed women are wrong they'll always be temptations are wrong every person every man still have a choice whether to look for to tune his eyes that tearing of the eyes is yours God can't take a head and be sure the angel come in and take a pick up sheet and put it in for eyes you as a man has to make a choice whether to look and get infected or affected or react to that or turn your head in you tune in your head butter brownies of a cross and then from his car when he see all him Jesse woman and sex just what he could turn to the cross when you turn your head you make a choice a choice that God sees a choice that heaven records that you are doing something about what is out here because you cannot stop t he shoes you cannot stop what season is offering and presenting he there is a Jesus he said all these kingdoms are - it was cards of presentation to him and Jesus made a choice it is also written it is also written it is also written so the Bible is exhorting us to present our bodies a living sacrifice it is something that you have to do sanctification being sanctified means being separated separated for what your friends do what other people do separate it under the same weight a report sanctification I want to put forgiveness because forgiveness God cannot come and make you forgive God cannot come and make you drop yours that's a choice the hula or the hula grudge because all of this affects people healing all of this affects people's deliverance if you want to be delivered if you want to be healed switch your heart and see what is ideal for some parents they have children who may be upsetting and I have to choose about that and he turned it terrible to them and they could actually develop a complex against the own children some children develop complex against their own parents but when all of that you still have to come to a place to love to forgive to be caring to be kind I want you to also understand that a new message is second called the Lord but I'm talking about the lost coin talking about the woman who recognized the coin was lost and she began to strip the floors and shred the cobweb and he said this part he neighbors could see the dust fly I know many times I preach and I talk about you know when people want to hide inner circle visibly carpet and she doesn't let him cover it up quick on water because you know what people don't know the host at duty but this woman was so desperate I could see a fling any capital side I can see jug dragon if he blows side you neighbors what do you think is she going nuts but the fact is she was looking for something what are you looking for to me what are you looking for tonight are you conscious of what you are missing are you conscious of of what you supposed to desire or if you're gonna go to life as it you need to understand that if you lost something you have to find it he's on a matter of I might find it I hope no no you have to find the Bible said she kept Owen Brown says until she found what she had lost you won back your joy that's a coin you won back piece of man that's a coin there a lot of people disturbed about what happened in poor esteem and I don't know what's gonna happen tomorrow if they feel comfortable to work to go to work tomorrow the end gunshots I hear this here that is an uncomfortable thing but the fact is something called peace of mind and coal want to give your peace and are speaking about that at the end of this session here we want to also have prayer and we have some officers among us and officers that we know that we want to pray for them prefer the police and pray for the nation that God will keep us and I see that all is your senior scriptures here we want to be at peace as much as possible I caused it so I want to encourage you to the Lord that Balaram says we didn't come in to occupy a Pew we didn't come to Trisha hear a good sermon a community a good service and so on he said we come to church at check up on our God for a soul salvation and this woman her husband are gone she lost a coin and she wanted to find it before her husband comes back and before Jesus come back in in his coming we have to have all things that God require of us in this very hour let's go to verse 2 I know because say much more on that but we would have us to and it says be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God that speaks for itself the world is trying to shape people by the advertisements by the styles by the fashions he's trying to shape own opinion you know I was thinking when inter grocery and what hands first and then you know social distancing and stuff and I realize that true this virus thing it's like sanctification you have to wash and you have to wash for 20 seconds and people watching and and and we are fortunate is not run into our country could you imagine if those around you the country before washing for 40 seconds ago was a whole minute because they don't want it and I'm seeing how people are being forced into discipline when we have to want disappear discipline is how you want to be able to survive but a man says the only church that was found in this last day will be a trained church it come like Joshua say when I bid you to shout show though shalt 'entertainment we forgot to give instructions that is why you want to know what is God's will what is God's will for your life be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the rear of your mind no you know what Obama said that after a while you forget your custom in his ministry seen miracles or what the miracles a good the girl custom and sometimes wonder if we just get a custom we just hear any word hear any word and you know it's a good word good message good simple this what you see you have to have a cry to get any spirit why it is that some people have a passion and some people don't ever study that some people just deadbeat one two one two and that dead bee can get you very far but the Bible says feed these sorts of things hoped for and so on but the part that gets to me is this he that cometh to God must believe that he is and he is a rewarder to them that diligently seek Him you have to have a hat for God and to know God you have to want to look his word he caught you would reveal his will you kind of got as a feeling no no it can't be like that what pleases God is your connection with his word the word is the pipe eternal you can do it the word is his cellphone what is the direct a live connection to God if you're still on his would you stay with his blessings he gonna bless you regardless of what conditions are on you remember I tell you about just stats talkin about um about the opinion bonded by a sin on by a behavior by an attitude never know the sonship cannot change but you could be born your son but your wings could a son but you're not free Samson was a son but his eyes was all because you're fooling with a woman who was the even belonging to his his arm is kind his people or the devil Sampson didn't see the opportunity he didn't see how the devil could use that woman he was just seeing her beauty a talk a language or whatever it is but he wasn't seeing the power of the enemy to would he wasn't see from his spiritual standpoint does he not trust him and this is what he'd ever like to do messy up in your mind in your torch in the action and attitude trap you set you up and then in your own heart there's condemnation in your own heart there is a Bible there's a force you don't be Liberty don't be freedom you know was he got something on you you know I believe you know the news with up in America and Russia this is was peon Taliban to kill American soldiers and the city president was inform and it was informed and they did nothing about it any question is they keep asking what's this Russia have any president why is he's not dealing with Russia as he or true it appears as if something is dear know what it is if the devil of something on you you'd ever look you wouldn't have defeat to really ask you wouldn't have defeat already at you win now before the traction panel get me Sita well if something is Dion yup attorney or is it get me I mean say why I should leave you know what is going on in your life you have no authority to repute me at the Kashmere you don't have that and didn't know you don't have it if you don't have the confidence that's why when them fellas was trying to cast him out in the name of the Jesus at Port Richard he said Paul I know it I know who are you so the devil hallelujah recognizes Authority the devil recognizes a sanctified life because sanctified life really is it is if they've already been ticked off that was a litigant rowdyism he'd ever get some boots and he's out he's looking for a house because you could only do mischief if you find a temple so he you can't find yours because he owed no when he recognized he has no houses all wrong he said I get seven other bullies and pageants worse than himself I tried to invade your life so the temptations grow up so much higher the trials who must so much hammer more naked woman the parade itself every actions and you see he want to get a doorway into your life he got come to the front door he could try a battle that is why we have to come now to close those doors and I'm hoping this kind of meetin and teaching and sharing would help us to close those doors because we could talk things and share things that we would not normally preach so we could close the gap and and squeeze on the enemy not just by Tommy wooden but by you examining your life and how you dealing with Julie if everybody tonight begin to take what they're hearing and look for life's application you not look at always this is not like a theory tingling you know like her you know like arm it come like you go to school yet the other you pass English maths chemistry and whatnot and then when you go to the job you don't have nothing to do with what you do in school absolutely nothing yeah but you're needy papers say you went to school but the job should go to like a time I I went for interview nah man say you know bunch all my documents and say Otis have towards porn see our biology I see a way this go solo he said we're a school of 50 years no like a dinner or two in sport but to me a thought spawn was just booked information I have no interest in horror told us porn but at the stick in my head they read that because I have an exam coming would spawn your answer the question take your pass have a pass but to say have that power toward us on I have no interest in all of dueling school but this is where sometimes in here any word is just information that's ruling off yes rule enough but what is it beginner take it and see what happens the more see what happens if somebody cross you're wrong ring is somebody wrong you let's continue and see what the Bible talk about it alright verse 3 if I say to the grace given unto me and to every man that is among you there we go not the ting of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as God and Delta every man the measure of faith there's a big one this one is is massive in the amplified it states here for by the grace unmerited favor of God given to me I warn everyone of you not the estimate and think of himself more highly than he ought but ours not to have an exaggerated opinion of one's importance but the rate his ability with sober judgment each equality degree a feat a portion my god to him no this is where people feel they're entitled this is where the entitled one's come forward because they see themselves so high they filled after sit at the top of the table and Jesus gave a parable specifically designed for those of you that the entitled he said when you invited to dine at the table take the lowest seat don't go and take the highest seat because you feel you're entitled because if somebody comes after it any higher see more worthy than you you will have to go back down a few more steps back now so Jesus was trying to guide in your thinking an attitude of humility attitude of thinking yourself not so high but that there are always people that will be higher better more worthy than yourself it's a sobering thing this scripture could have a message in itself because I have seen hope the cause the confusion tonight what people eating the day they entitled highly favored under and in God's kingdom he is no respecter of persons said after me no respecter of persons you see he is no respecter of persons whether you are elder children pastor Tarun Dickey children whether you are elder didn't pastor minister he is no respecter of person he's discipline or this have been Moses discipline Joshua discipline people this is a God of business he's a God of his word let's continue who is for first we has many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in Christ and every one number one of another event then gifts differing according to Greece and is given to us but a prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith or ministry that has reason or ministering or he that teacheth on teaching or he didn't exhort it on my dissertation he that giveth let him do it with simplicity he that ruleth with diligence he that showed mercy with cheerfulness let love be without dissimulation abhor that which is evil please the that which is good and I think amplified let your love be sincere a real thing hit what is evil not all ungodliness turning half on wickedness but hold fast that which is good this is applied principles this has nothing to do it who's your friend who's that your friend Jesus had his own disciples when Peter said the wrong thing Jesus told him get behind me Satan it wasn't oh god Peter no no no no no he didn't say the right thing you know some people wrong not a walk with eggshells tip to one thing like that we had a commenter latinum together come up yeah I was gonna together ticket on that we have to be able to handle what we have no because you see worse is coming what rep look look look Toodee I wanted to focus about deterrence but today they said they have a new virus from China in China that is is like the 2009 swine flu virus and 191 whatever whatever one plus it have the characteristics of the 1918 flu very so you see that demon that bad spirit that what what back dear they write in you know and his wave after wave after we've who prophesied up but the ban on him said it he said we are strengthened the end into the kingdom of God before these he called him horrible big strike let's try the night let's take it serious tonight let's not take it as we go into church and his church people and people on fire by envy and whatnot no you have to breathe true you must be true amen let's continue praise the Lord he said so let your love be sincere do you love your brother Peter cinn Jesus in love as though is really lovely really love me love me bro oh you shouldn't yell at me bro you love your sister oh you're gonna fight this system he said be kind of fractionate to one another with brotherly love in honour preferring one another amplified love one another with brotherly affection yet us as members of one family given precedence I'm showing honor to one another and I believe that Gordon loves when we can honor one another when we could switch other with respects when husbands could show their wives respect son why should it husband respect some children show that parents respects him they aren't sure it Shirin respects I believe God loves that he loves them because you see as we treat each other as showing which we chant God's own people and once you get a revelation that their sons and daughters are wrong him you want to treat them with respects you want to treat them adverts you want to treat them with dignity it says ya verse 11 being slothful not stressful in business but fervent in spirit serving the Lord and it says here and not if I never lag in zeal and until miss endeavor here glue and brilliant with the spirit silver nail or prison or even that is something you always know end but a gist Lazaro evil hallelujah where is Jason he's on fire he have a seal he always comes with it is something inside of him and that is what we all must have a zeal for God I see you for the things of God Gorka said this is my man down here this is my woman on here a passion for God out of Scripture I wanted to connect with when I read it first and they's from first Geeta chapter 4:1 talking about changing their mind look at the scripture from 1st Peter chapter 4 verse 1 for as much then as Christ had suffered for us in the flesh um you serve likewise with the same mind for he that had suffered in the flesh had ceased from sin you know what a man says some family fifty years to get a man in sheep awaiting of order sometime I take 50 years forgot to use a man for six months I can debug this 30 years to get the man in shape sometimes we take a long time to get older be childish be easier to get out of the common behavior like putting off time preach and I left I love to see it he didn't make you had any animals he made you a little lower than the Angels so you cannot subject yourself to the lower lust levelin you have to be striving to be caught up into a heavenly atmosphere where you could be used by God well you could be a challenge of God make what could communicate to others through you it's not flesh and blood God using no in that sense goal want to use his wood in flesh and blood he wants his word to become fresh and he could use you I believe it was a Sunday or some day was talking and and sharing about him about brother branham I'm gonna Branum talking about and his after he seals oh he you know he feeling this way and abdominal and everything else and that is being sincere he wasn't playing angel he wasn't playing and he somewhere up there was a human being he have a disappointment as a human being traveling with the church he striving to get things in order but things doesn't work out as he expects people behavior is not as he expect and as a human being is a great disappointment and he came to us but one time where he lost the burden for the people that's a terrible place to be in because you do you don't have to drive anymore help to really give the kind of support you need to really do what we have to do it has to be a burden the burden makes a difference and the people who pray is who gets burdens and when they get a burden it rises the prayer like a recurring cycle so all the light Christians all the ones who have problems I like how you look at me I and I call this one chick man I find this enough train them and all their emotions they haven't gone deep enough into a burden go when you look again your world is too small God is not in that small thinking that we have many a times it's that's why we need to get in minor Christ a bit of the wood and sometime I pray that pray Lord burden the burden of the world you get a word good interpreting a burden of God so when you come to the church you not see yourself as you quit the church it'll know you're going there to worship you're going there to cause a revival you go in there to create an atmosphere you have a purpose of going yeah when you pray in you not pray because you get a prayer you know it is it a pretty no you want to commune with God you know I find myself you have to pray the mysteriously I have a feeling so if I don't pray I can just not gonna you're not gonna work it lowers I have to pray to gain an expectation of what I'm praying for so whether when I was like a spree Chernobyl Anthony's preaching or whoever is preaching or do you have to do I have to pray I pray about this what we doing at night a good with help a go to it strengthen the good word when honor your faith and coming out started to hear what is being spoken but your lies will be changed that will be like a word applied amen praise the Lord so here we go rejoice in the hope fish tribulation continuing instant in prayer let us finish we didn't finish read this year for as much as Christ had suffered for us in the flesh arm yourself likewise for the same mine but he that had suffered in the flesh had ceased from sin that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lust of men but to the will of God for in the time pass of our life the surfaces to have wrought the will of the Gentiles when we walked in Las deficiencies lost excess of wine revel ins banquet ins abominable idolatries and he speaks about all these things that that is not the way we have to walk so in other words we also be so far from that kind of behavior that we find ourselves that good self ready to die ready to be killed we believe that tonight praise the Lord so let's continue rejoicing in Hope patient in tribulation continuing instant in prayer distributing to the necessity of the Saints given the hospitality bless them that persecute you bless and curse not rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that we only amplified and I pull this out rejoice with those who rejoice sharing others joy and weep with those who weep Sharyl others grief question can you rejoice with somebody else blessing could God bless her sister so much and you could rejoice with her and you had sincerely rejoicing with her could God bless her brother and you could rejoice with him I'm so happy for you god bless you I'm grateful to God I see the quad eyes are on you could you do that or did he get a fight that somebody is blessed and you are not blessed like them and you begin to get envious and jealous and you get a back in your mind so instead of rejoicing with him he said but everything could you weep in somebody weep and feel for him put on their shoes somebody's in pain and you want to feel for you when a battle felt for the people he prayed for in India he took off his shoes because the man was blind and he had no shoes but I must be paired to give him his shoes done barefoot on the platform because he finally was so on fear not only is a man blind but a man had no shoes could you could you share your shoes could you share your coat could you share your dollars as a big one and those people who do want to ask people how you're going I didn't remember that years ago they refuse to answer your word because you be frightened you say you ain't going good on your Scranton and even what he says Scranton they know that they were been a spot because they have a new dawn so they're not even asking how you're going did you what let's praise our prophet prays alone because if you want to put down in the pocket and give you some change like Oh Peter wants to do it if he's had money would have given the guy money it's just that God set it up that Peter forget his wallet that day only see in that and he said silver and gold a diamond and you have anything right now but what I have I sent me I'm happy to give you friends we have to go a little further Jesus talked about if somebody competitive or one man want him to you somebody access a a coat give me a cloak also it is similar I'm an imam if Christ is coming back among us we have to see something that wonders and that similarly monkeys are live voice to love your enemies to do good to them that Christian whatever it is that blessing people cussing your God bless you praise the Lord or bless you you see your your blessing going on them and them kissing you and if meeting and your blessing falling back on you and your crews falling back on you because you are in God's blessing parameters forgiving your house right give me a preacher give me anybody would put God first I'll show you somebody that we bless despite all way devil put in front who would have thought to be won't be like this in Trinidad when we no creeper no that is whole lot daunting who looking for that but you see the develop would to never want to bring confusion never want to bring gloom and take them dying and the myths of all of that we not watching it closed and beat women disinterment that right among

please let's verse 16 says be of the same mind one day was another mind not high things but condescend to men of low estate be not wise in your own conceits recompense no man evil for evil for writings honest in the sight of all men and if it is possible as much as lieth in you live peaceably with all men he said dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but rather give place under out for it is written vengeance is mine I will repay saith the Lord dear for what about is it vengeance is mine saith the Lord I will repeat remember I preached a message call for groups which one that must be

shalt heap coals of fire on his head be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good and this is the last script that I have to share with you tonight and this scripture is from Philly chapter two I wanted to find this one Philippians chapter 2 it says if there be any deer for any conservation was one in Christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the Spirit if any powers and mercies fulfilling my joy that you be like-minded having the same love being of one Accord of one may let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem the other better than themselves looked at every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God made himself of no reputation took upon him the form of a servant was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross listen friends you cannot die if you'll not be better humble yourself if you're not prepared to say I'm wrong I'm sorry I made a mistake shouldn't have done that I shouldn't have said that I should be I've acted at me it's okay the feeling i taller brother if you feel and feel forward you'll feel falling backwards feel forward feel asking for help feel reach you know nothing wrong with feeling what are you gonna learn from your feeling what you're gonna get let's bow our heads Almighty God I thank you tonight this little exhortation sharing with him a little lesson about the cross Romans 12:2 present their bodies a living sacrifice to be humble in heart and in spirit and in mind and they come is a sanctification Lord to prepare for the baptism of the Holy Ghost but that's what you all you ask of us Lord to live a clean life a surrendered life a life of worship unto you knowledge in your word knowledge in your presence but what I pray tonight that you would Lord reveal the scriptures for your people unveil your wood in their hearts and mine knowing that you are in your word you and your wood is the same Lord Leo will become flesh in us that we want to love want to forgive choose to act the act right because it's not just hearing the word Lord is being able to apply the word applying it from tonight title from today are they promised a revival a revival that will start in the homes and lives of the children granted Lord late start a night Lord in Jesus and we ask it amen the night we won't have a special time special prayer it's a rush Kumar Susanne a son Enoch he's oh dear police and we have our own mark on Adrian and different ones so we want to pray for them because we know the challenges as his ordeal and we want the tax court to look over the nation so this time I want you to have real concern because remember is Lucifer at work trying to interrupt Aeneas canted the report program no but he could bring that disruption and the servants to affect the people of let's bow our heads as you want a prenup Heavenly Father I bring Enoch crash College for you along with all the other brothers like Mark and

Lord we know all this disruption and everything else is a sign of things that has come in but there's a bride here in Trinidad that is under the Covenant of the tool of your blood the talk must be displayed we have been applying the blood all these years or we know some point that blood must take life take a whole and bring life that would be this plead father made happen tonight in GSM I ask it a man an amen so this time I wanna invite but Isaac to give us a clue sin would know he didn't expect this but we didn't ask him you have been doing quite well I've certainly be enjoying the the study that he has given I hope that you don't compare it with what he has been doing there's no comparison he's in his element when he's doing this thing but I consider it a privilege to have done this tonight I was looking forward for it and I'm paralyzed ik-hee man who's in charge of Bible study realiza I'm sorry I didn't know but mo laughter even Google s you this is totally unexpected but God bless you Church and really appreciated teaching tonight and it's really a powerful scripture that was read and I pray that there's been a blessing to each and every one of you and there's so much to meditate on these scriptures I was sharing them but over it some time ago that you cannot exhaust Scripture you cannot exhaust the wood and more and more I find myself I'm challenging myself and I want to challenge you as well that you know in the business world they say that you are the average of the five people you spend your time with you know so if you spend your time with people who know more than you do what will happen is that after a while you start to learn things from them you know but if you spend time with people who just talking nonsense and and trust me there's a lot of nonsense sake because when I'm talking then eventually you actually slow down yourself you know and it applies to every area if you if you want your to be physically strong they see you don't do any kind of physical exercise to somebody who lives in hospital for a long time this is very difficult to get off your bed because there's a good thing entropy I think as you would where your muscles start to lose its ability to perform and and and you know physical exercise even mental exercise because the brain is a more is a muscle and it the same principle applies spiritually you know and we sang this song in Sunday school read your Bible and pre every day and you'll grow grew grew and thing about life I don't know what your experience is it is that doesn't come natural it does not come natural there's no automatic switch that you put on the radio Bible and pray every single V no I think recently I saw an article of a student who went to school you know this wasn't passing on and they say when they look at her academic record she never missed a day in school and I have heard people who talk about that I have a business associate who said in his 30 something plus years as a leader in his organization he said he probably has taken one day sick in his whole to me something years in a row you know and he was making a reference you were saying that you know when people not really sick and they say this is sick so I coming in today because a sick you say you bring sickness on yourself because what you testify and what you speak is what you walk into so you say I rather you tell me you had it in you why are you telling me you're just frustrated already tell me yeah I want to see my face to be then ever lie and see you sick when you're not sick so these are principles but but what I was looking at is the discipline of the consistency of something you know and what I'm what I'm trying to see from my own life and by extension those that I have some level of influence on is the discipline of making you would a part of your life I have preached it before I find it very difficult for somebody to move from reading in Scripture from praying into an argument it's a really it's a really that he was in you would after you hear I beseech you therefore brethren you have Paul pleading reseachers beyond ask usage means he that is coming deep within I beseech you by the mercies of God so it's conditional - it's basically mercy of God that you present your by the living sacrifice he said holy that word holy is big that word holy itself is big that we could ever consider to present ourselves holy ask me you holy holy holy is what Isaiah met when the angel was there around each road said holy holy holy are you Lord and here Paul is challenging you and me to present ourselves holy that in our presence in just could look at us and see his own image to us that's that massive wholly unacceptable you when when when you had to bring a sacrifice and the priests connie priest couldn't just take any sacrifice you know when you have to bring a sacrifice and you have to represent your house and after one search you very carefully search a lamb because it was specific a lamb without blemish so it was a criteria because of there was an acceptable elementary sacrifice so you can basically come to present a sacrifice and appreciate again what is this mark here this tower cannot go I'm Graham bring something else this sacrifice is not acceptable and in the same way this scripture is speaking about the acceptability and it's not man's acceptability it is acceptable unto God so God is saying I accept this so and then the clincher of this all and I will announce upon these verses is if your reasonable service well what's not you see that but that could finish anybody tonight because reasonable service if God's saying to us through the Apostle Paul that he not giving us something that is so unattainable and we cannot achieve not he's not saying this is that charlatan I want you to brace yourself any challenge he is saying this is reasonable reasonable so reasonable is scary because reasonable means it's within your ability without even too much effort reasonable is challenging us that this level of sanctification albertov is so beautiful we put it on accurately put them that sanctification is reasonable that takes away excuses you know because what hurts the Christian walk is is our natural tendency to have excuses for why we did what we did or why we didn't do what we do but here Paul is saying it's reasonable that we could present our bodies a living sacrifice reasonable that got to look at our daily work and see you sacrifice and accept that listen this is a son this is a daughter of God and I think that is really really powerful and this way of life as well a little bit said about dying daily it's about discipline I've been hitting this wood discipline for weeks and I'm seeing him more and more because even today as I saw some videos and I'm a very distinguished colleague of mine call me today he say Isaac I fed up delete miss video on the phone and he said this thing is this thing is saying something else alone I said listen I ready for 20 21 because this 2020 this year hey I know where this is the amount of stuff has happened in this year 2020 that happen in years that is almost like what Nick's what could possibly happen next when you think is is China problem you become a world problem when anything is an America problem it becomes a local problem and but the issue is not about China America Chile I know the issue is a sin problem and the reality is sin when it matures if you could see that would matures will only manifest certain things it'll manifest behaviors that appeal to or attracted to or connected to the business nature of man this is the achievement which is violence and naki chaos Babylon Sodom Gomorrah when you strip away what we call morality is really not the issue of morality when you strip away the compass that points to God you will get everything else so it becomes that nothing is a surprise anymore for the simple reason that once you are not pointing to God anything to be expected you know so I want to encourage us especially in these times because we will see more things that we have not seen before not that it hasn't existed before because a Babel does it there's nothing new Under the Sun these are manifestations of what has happened before time and time again it is reflections of the same spirits that have came upon people before to create anak II and this order and sin and and the reality is his sad reality is people will not change by the brutal reality of it I've said it before there is no solution to the crime problem there's no Commissioner there's no army because spirits don't die but even when somebody dies or the spirit now looking for a new vessel to be touched or this really seem as she was and it's clear because even when Jesus had to encounter leave him in spirit of my legion in casting the demons of the Legion he had to send those demons somewhere just understand the context of it and those demons end up going it to be pings and that is why I wanted to run Jesus out because he messed up my whole big business at that time in that context in that description but the point I want to kneel down is this the spirits the spirits no matter how you see it and you have to see the spiritual around but nobody says something really really powerful tonight about closing the doors and I want to build on that not just the doors close the windows close the doors close the windows lock your house you see in this today I see courts on Sookie put apply an ting unblock a meeting because they are taking no chances you see we have glass we have furniture we have TV we have think if them people were to do a little America block of me please that was their natural automatic instinctive response to protect their whatever they had behind it it's the same way that when we see what's happening we supposed to be locking the doors and I'm not just just on the physical doors but he draws up our lives make it impossible to see it done to get room in your life but over it said something powerful about about what sit and have on us that I serious thing that is really serious thing because when somebody have something on you you feel a certain way do anything they call you Fela if somebody have somebody when they call you respond a certain way here yeah because you don't want sir there's so much game and I'm sure you've been in a situation where you feel oh gosh way so and so you know what I know I had something feel I know I'm if I answer no you're getting a doc in him or it all kind of different situations and and anything is if you don't give the devil stuff on you he can't get stuff on you can I say that one more time he democratise create stuff you know you know and I'll try to close to this I was studying Juba and I say I want to do a study of jube that might be maybe make some because there's a counter-argument to jube then I found that a lot of people don't touch on but it is on more than one occasion God asking Satan have you considered my sylvans Juba and the reality was this that when you understand the principle of the conversation it really means Satan don't have any permission to touch your life your family your business your money your health unless God gives him permission to come at you for a test now that is profound so it means II think I just pick you and and you become a victim and no no for him to even come close to you God have to say all right go ahead take a crack and as we a lot of people miss it because it means that because you you are not protection we are all under a protection and that protection stands see them as the common so so even when you look at it conversation when God acts is there will have you considered my servant you see them is like how you accident that question when you have a protection along and you know you're protecting him it's your almost a similar question that some Tim Barris me because you know a car touch him you know occur I'm coming the host a common street I come even you have been protected and Gordon City well here's was I will take off the edge from around his life go do what you want yes don't touch his life and that is what allow the devil to even come onto the street and so the impact jobs life but chew it all and we could get it at some point job was able to which stanley test but true it as well jubilant lessons he did not learn until the head was removed many times we talk about job god always trouble and he's kind of thing but there were lessons that job could not have learned had God not allowed he had to be removed and a lot of emphasis is not pleased because job had a somewhat causal relationship with God if you really to repot the job the Bible said that when it's sharing with that eat he would offer a sacrifice just in case they did something wrong almost as if he was trying to buy their salvation and that's an awkward operates so going to break away his little traditions that he had that he told was protecting his family so every time they have a feast he do all sacrifice just to cover them just in case you don't have to do anything about it but yet and all of us are these little things we just do they celebrate our thing you know a well spoken book in my back pocket if I had idea covered and I think we do it because this is this is your own way of feeling a certain level of comfort but underneath that there is no substitute for that deep relationship with God and I believe Roman twelve Lee is such a powerful foundation of how circumspect we must be how careful we must be our protective we must be how disciplined we must be to not be conformed to this world to be transformed by the renewing of your mind there are principles in there that are so deep that I trust that you would go back into this and study and spend him on ticket I might be in conformed in as well it's my language conformity language of this world it's how I look at people the way God looks at them or is you work influenced and how I look at them when I submit my report on my job when I speak to my family all of us and I said any fortunate that is a country of actors and actresses in the Oscars and Grammy was here we win every time we win because we're able to shape-shift and change to our environment to the situation the challenge to everything to try to the and it's pattern almost nature survival mechanism it's eaten in me chameleons any lizards they tried to fit in any and hid in it but the Bible says don't be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind all that is romant well so in summary may God richly bless you I trust take this word to heart make this word your principle and I never thought quite honestly that you know you're no script Chinese CD would but this thing is so real to your daily life it is ready almost explosive in your mind and heart when you see that everything in life and putting the life and godliness is in this and if you said the see this as a real thing and lifted this you will see a business change your marriage Jean hear conversation change you're walking your feet your confidence you approach everything so we're aware Gauri she bless you Church God richly bless you Stanley fire in line and do not underestimate God do not limit God by your own thinking don't limit God by your experience don't limit God but what you heard other people said because as you see scripture unfold what is promised for us nobody in the past not even the prophet has experienced what we escena for us because it says bright time so the relationship that the groom will have with this bride will be different from that what he has had with any other 84 because this is the ending of all things so middle or race you bless you amen thank you but Isaac and just to say that tomorrow not tomorrow night is service and Millican fall for all of you all to come out in your numbers full full full force I'll say buddy smiley come on full-blast looking for greet I'm a lord I'm on a great expectation so may the Lord bless you you just want to cruise on with a prayer and really miss miss I only thought I thank you for your presence
