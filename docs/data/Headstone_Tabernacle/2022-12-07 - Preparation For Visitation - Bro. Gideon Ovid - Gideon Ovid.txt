cars wherever they are Lord and deliver them and heal them and baptize them and restore them and anoint them Lord in Jesus name we pray amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord you may have your seats I know this this time might be one of the most new wrecking times the first two minutes as you stand here but by God's grace we're gonna make it through I I I I prayed as I came and I said I want to be like a clinical swordsman you know I don't want to waste words I don't want to waste time I want to really bring the message home really deliver what God has placed upon my heart and with that said for a title I just want to say preparation for visitation you know preparation for visitation very very simple preparation for visitation and in the natural you know some persons would have just gone through that Thanksgiving period and we have the Christmas holidays coming up as it were and a lot of us find ourselves in preparation mode you know we find ourselves in a position in which we we want to perhaps clean out and and cook and and do the things that we believe we need to do to prepare for not just a season but but in anticipation of guests in anticipation of visitors and it's the same way that God would want us to prepare our hearts and prepare our lives and prepare our attitudes Lord the atmosphere around us must be prepared for his visitation for the visitation of the holy spirit for for him to be able to drop down and be made known Among Us so let's just Begin by by reading a couple scriptures you may stand and we want to turn to the Book of Genesis reading a couple verses there and then we'll go over to the Book of Luke Genesis chapter 18. reading just about five verses there the Book of Genesis Chapter 18 reading from verse 10. and it says and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and low Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him now Abraham and Sarah were old and well-stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of woman therefore Sarah laughed within herself saying after I am waxed All Shall I have pleasure my Lord being old also and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I have a surety Bear Child which I'm old is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son and over to Luke reading from chapter 24 a few verses there as well from verse 49. verse 49-53 and it says and behold I sent the promise of my father upon you but tarry in the city of Jerusalem until he be endued with power from on high and he led them out as far as to Bethany he lifted up his hands and blessed them and it came to pass while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up into heaven and they worship Him and return to Jerusalem with great joy and they will continually in the temple praising and blessing God Amen may the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you may have your seats one more time you know this when it was placed upon my heart I had to do some research preparation for visitation and I went back to basics I went to make sure I understood what was being said what I had to say and preparation is is derived from a Latin wood and it means to make ready before so it calls for Action it calls for you to do something before the manifestation of that so if you have to prepare for me coming to your home it means you have to do something before I come to your home so it calls for you to do something so that's important to remember that it's done before it can be done at the time it can't be done after at that time it's too late it has to be done before and then I examine the word visitation and according to the definition it had various definitions but the ones I like the most ones that an official visit I like that it's not just a visit an official visit and then it also went on to say a special dispensation of divine favor or wrath and I like that even more because it also highlighted the fact that a visit or a visitation wasn't always a positive thing there is positive and negative it wasn't always a human thing it wasn't always I am coming to your home it might be an angel in your home you got me now I examine it a little more and I realized you know there is schedule and unscheduled visitations so if somebody says brother Gideon I'm coming to your home on Saturday at 3 P.M and I said yes that sounds awesome we have scheduled a visitation so they're coming to visit me at a a predetermined time on a predetermined day so it's easy to prepare for them which is to to make ready before right however in the case of an emergency if I'm calling somebody says listen outside the hopes because I need some help something desperately has happened that I that's unscheduled in my research and reading this scripture reading the course reading the message what I understand we have both schedule and unscheduled so it's important to make the distinction between the two because the distinction between the two actually impacts the way we prepare because when it's unscheduled there's a level of uncertainty there is space on an element or there is a window for doubt to exist and doubt as you know causes fear and paralyzes your faith and your ability to act and properly prepare so it's really incumbent on us to understand where we are at who we are at and how we are operating whether or not it's scheduled on scheduled whether we're preparing for natural or spiritual things and act accordingly right now the scriptures are very very clear as a matter of fact I I just want to read and forgive me for reading so many quotes but I feel like a treasure hunter as I as I went through some of the quotes I said you know what I can't stop here I need to go a little more and the more I went is the more I had to go because I was unearthing gems and jewels and all kind of stuff that we just needed to wash off a little bit right so forgive me a little bit now in a message brother Brandon preacher in 1953 called preparation from paragraph 18 He said so in don't depend on your knowledge and don't never try to figure anything out that God says if you could figure it out or if I could figure it out or if any other preacher could figure it out we would be equal with God we are not supposed and never will be able to figure it out because when we can figure it out it's not fit anymore it's not about him and believing in him and trusting him and trusting his word and what he's promised for us because with our natural five senses and logic we could figure it out so the prophet is saying hey don't worry about it have faith and trust God's word that he's the same yesterday today and forever and he is faithful to accomplish that which he started it goes on to say we've got to accept it by faith is that right God said so I don't know how I can't tell you how he's going to do it but he's gonna do it because he said so that's the basis God is going to do it because he promised to do it he is God and he can't break his promise how it is and some of God's preparations has been so ridiculous to people who depend on the tree of knowledge God's preparation has been absolutely ridiculous to the Natural mind because the natural mind can conceive the things that are of God you know it it goes on you say in in paragraph that 33 God in his preparation back when God was going to destroy the world before he destroyed the world he sent a preparation for saving of the people that desire to be saved what does that tell us that tells us there are those who they need a here nor there they don't care but we're not too worried about that because we want to be the people concerned and have a desire to really line up with God's promise and God's requirement for this hour so those people that have a desire to be saved he has a preparation for us he said he sent forth a preparation for the people that desire to be saved he always does it so he's the same yesterday today and forever so tonight sent me just as a reminder I'm reading still always does it he shows Mercy before judgment and if men spoon Mercy there's only one thing left that's judgment and God don't judge you you judge yourself that's true as long as you're under this prey of blood that's around the world you have a right of Mercy God's Miss the blood of Christ keeps God from killing you or he'll kill you just as soon as you sinned but that's still holding God from you from your death but when you're a free moral agent now but when you die and the spirit goes beyond that then you're already judged you don't have to wait for judgment you judge already God done said the day you eat thereof that day you die and that settles it so friends I'm not saying anything new I'm not saying anything strange I'm not saying anything you don't know wasn't it strange it never had rain I'd be moving to Noah's time Noah was called and challenged to prepare for something that had an uncertain date it was what what I will refer to as an unscheduled visit in this case it was in the form of rain so he got a message saying prepare for something but I'm not telling you when it's going to happen that calls for a great deal of faith and as we know we know the story and I'll I'll read as we go along can you imagine the people this is chapter 30 the paragraph 34. could you imagine the people down in the city talking about it why they'd say hey what do you think about that rain story can you imagine no ideas with social media the Vlogs the Vlogs the depressed the kind of stories you'll have trending yeah you you heard about this rain thing you heard this old man preaching this rain thing it's yes now he's saying that you can imagine what a mockery would have been like year after year going into 2023 and you still believe that you still preaching that you still sit in this Dawn and people why you don't take a break why don't take a rest but he had to prepare for an unscheduled visit nobody else knew about it but he did he had faith and he had the confidence and belief in God's promise at that time they say hey what do you think about the rain story that old guy is telling up there but he had the will of God he knowed where he was no matter what the world how ridiculous it seemed to the world God had a man he could put his hand on it are you that kind of person tonight that God could put his hand on you and say listen this is what I'd like you to do and I'd like you to stick to it I don't want you to be swayed and shifted by every little talk and every little little thing and everything that's trending now that's the scenario Noah was in how ridiculous it seemed to The World God had a man he could put his hand on and he built the ark the people laughed at him that didn't stop him though he just built right ahead he kept pressing on any man that really knows the Divine will of God is born again they could call you a Holy Roller fanatic whatever they want to You'll build right ahead on the earth it doesn't make a bitter difference that's right you get ready you get ready for it no I can see the time said there's gonna come a storm this is what no one know the rains are oh how he's gonna do it you may have had a question because keep in mind just just to build a context it didn't rain before so this was fresh this was new this this was a novelty this was something that sounds so strange that sounds so strange however from the courts before we understand if we could just understand it we don't need faith we don't need to really believe and grab a hole at the impossible and and see it become real and manifested in our lives so the kind of Faith No One needed was a special type this was a a fit that didn't have a history it was untested this was the first time a man would have been called upon to wait this long with a message believe in something and trusting in the word of God for something that never happened before [Music] he says that's right you get ready for it no I could see the time Noah was going to come a storm He reigns that how he's gonna do it why it never did do it and there were much better scientists than we are today go down in Egypt and look at the pyramids setting in the middle of the Earth no matter where the sun is there's never a shadow around it no matter where the sun is how they do it all these Bowlers at least two city blocks high that weigh a billion tons or they get them up there produce something now that could lift them up you can't do it they can't make mummies today as they did in them days with the body they can't embalm like they did none of those things they were smarter really than they are today and you know they laughed at that man that stood up there building the ark and saying it was going to rain but it rained anyhow it didn't change the fact that God always keep his promises he will always keep his word his word to you is still true and will still come to pass but you have to grab a whole of faith and know he's faithful amen amen I can't just imagine just look at this just a moment God Was preparing Noah's preaching and the first thing you know why one day one day they come a thunder and I want you to picture it now can you imagine it's quiet it's kind of like no right no be experiencing some beautiful sunlight and can you imagine you're here Thunder all of a sudden you get a startling reminder there was a man sometime that used to say rain coming you didn't see the rain yet but you're aware that this is not the norm something has interrupted your normal living no I hear someone say oh a blast went off somewhere but a cloud began to rise now I could see the great big poly parrot setting out there looking over the mother Polly pirate and saying mother that's what Noah said I can see little monkey drop the corner and say Come on Mommy we head in for the ark and I run through a little bit but brother Branham said sometimes these wild animals have more sense more faith more belief in the word of God than humans so I am just here to standing up to ensure that we the humans could still be reminded could still believe could still be encouraged and inspired and have the fear so this testimony wouldn't be true we don't want the eye and the animals to beat us we want to be able to hear God's voice hear his word hear his promise and believe it believe it a hundred percent and knowing that we don't have to understand it but the faith that we have in God will pull us through because he said listen when the son of man come would he find churches would you find groups would you find people would you find Bible believing Christians those Concepts sound good those construction interesting but he said shall he find faith and that's the thing that sometimes we lacking that's the thing sometimes that disconnects us from the promises of God and our ability to really come to our fullest potential the faith that God expect us to have in his unfailing word foreign [Applause] I always say in the natural it's easy for us to prepare for a friend if I were to say sister Donna key come come to my house she should expect that it may not be me but but I will cook some food I will prepare some something you know I wouldn't invite you to my house and then I am not home that's not how you prepare I know I'm expecting you a particular time so I may tell I may tell tell my wife I said listen come so we have to put this in place we have to make sure she can park we want to make sure things in order that we have the chairs that the place is clean that we're gonna entertain huh right and when we think about it this is how we operate in the natural but I want to tell you a little secret in our own lives we also have this thing called priority priority or importance for example my brother would come to my home he pops up anytime president call outside hey what's up it's okay I'm not saying the place would be dirty but if he come and you see some toys on the floor it's not a problem no issue at all because it's my brother however just imagine for a second in Trinidad we have a prime minister right if the prime minister is to visit my home what do you think will happen you think he will pop up on the air outside that wouldn't happen but even if he does you think I'll just say well come on in no I will say hold on a minute I will clean I will prepare I will put things in place because I place a certain level of importance on his office or who he is correct so just think for a second in the spiritual now I'm not talking about a man I'm not talking about a prime minister a president or a head of state or or somebody that that we voted in or have a title I'm talking about almighty God I'm referring to the Holy Spirit here I'm talking about the angel of God being able to drop down how much more we ought to prepare our lives our heart our homes to to be in anticipation for his coming to know that he has promised to come and he didn't give us the time they didn't give us the day they didn't give us the hour so how we ought to live how we ought to operate how we ought to speak how we ought to relate to each other knowing that he has committed that I'm going to visit you in Abraham's case they said I will return according to the time of life in no one's case he say it will rain different form one a time frame and even then with Abraham as you know the story in year one can you imagine I doubt Abraham just sat down and you know this story he wouldn't sit down and be like I wanna know when this child come in but I wonder if it's this year I wonder if it's next year I wonder they say Abraham we call him the father of faith he stood on the promise of God no matter what anybody else said he had Faith year in year out day in day out month in month out he had a testimony that God said so God said so so Sarah I know you're looking older and I will read the scripture here no the quote right rather once I find it you know God said he could have chosen Abraham when he was 26 you know you know that Sarah would have been 16 and I want to make a nice story we could write a book about that storybook with pictures and colors you know but that's not the way he wanted it that's not the way he wanted it that is not the way he wanted it I will find it back in a little while right so in in the message God has a provided we 1956 chapter 87 he said I let Abraham and instead of calling him no at 26 and Sarah at 16 I'll wait till they are old that's got amazing so he have plans and he could watch you and say listen you know what this story too simple it reminds me of Gideon in the Bible cause men he had armies for days he could conquer anything after his confidence and his fate was built up he realized he had a lot of support but God said you know what that looked too easy if you do that I don't get the glory I look at the honor I don't get any worship I expect I don't get the results I want confuse I want to twist up I don't want you to think that is because of your strength and your might I want you have a testimony not by my might not by my power but by your spirit because you are God you did it right so he was able to break the Army down because that's the way he wanted it so God said listen I will wait till Abraham is old because I want a really confuse the mind of the wise I want to confuse the why the mind of the natural those who think they could figure it out so I'm nothing to figure in it out I'm into trying to understand the mind of Christ for my life because if I could live a life that's pleased into God then I could walk like Enoch they say Enoch was just walking you know we reflect a normal living and oftentimes we refer to it almost in a negative way with normal living but you know your normal living could be positive Enoch wasn't doing anything fancy you know Enoch was living his normal life but in his normal walk with God in his normal relationship with God he pleased God he walked with God he had such a relationship with God that his normal living allowed him to disappear and he was found not and they couldn't find him wherever they looked they couldn't find him in his normal living oh we ought to be so normal be kind of normal you know during the pandemic they had a new phrase they call it the new normal I hope and pray that our new normal will be a normalcy of faith a normalcy of of Revelation and inspiration and that we will continue to raise and worship on Thanksgiving and we could create such an atmosphere not just in church I just want to pause there for a minute you know it's it's easy to act in church you know that I tell people all the time when I when I meet them on the street I often say I'm born in church I tell am I born in children I said they only write Port especially on another hospital on my birth certificate but I really born in church so I live in church play music I'm not I'm not preacher but a born in church so there are some people who they become accustomed to church church becomes the norm so they know when it's Church time you dress up and say God bless and you lift your hands and you worship because it's the norm it's the thing to do but you know what God don't really take that one too much you know you know that he speaks a lot about the people in his Temple he speaks about the way they operate and his pleasure or displeasure with their activity seems to place a lot of emphasis and value in your life outside of the church outside the walls of the church you see when you go to school and the children give you a hard time and you're driving along the road and they give you a bad drive like I tell my wife earlier this week I was going to to a store and and I pulled um into an empty spot it is so weird it was an empty spot I saw it as an empty spot and I pulled him and a guy outside as I came out he presses one so I turned because there was an empty spot next to me while you squirreling with me somebody else filled the next empty spot so I'm just looking at him and he said I was going there I was going there where I was already parked and outside the vehicle so he had a passenger in the vehicle and as the passenger came out the passenger looked at me and he said boy you you blind and do a Tish boy right you know what I did I reacted are reacted took all that I had in me and reacted I gave him it good I told him like it is you know what I did I just continued walking I just walked into the store did my business and as I walked back out they were gone I tell my wife I said listen that is maturity you know I say you know I heard the words and it didn't impact me because his words didn't Define me because I know who I am and I am not blind neither am I do this so I did not allow his words to throw through me off as a matter of fact that day was a great day I went to one to my wife I said listen today was very very productive you know listen to what happened a man called me blind and Duty but praise the Lord anyhow because I know who I am and I trust and he promised on the word of God I could stand strong by faith knowing that I could water atmosphere wrong I work to preserve that people talk a lot about mental health no right and do you realize you are greatly responsible for the atmosphere around you how you react how you behave outside of the walls of church really determines the life that you live because you allow people to throw you off all of a sudden you're not operating in faith anymore you know you're operating on a natural and unbelief just reacting flying off the handle getting upset and not realizing that this is so for such a time as this strange enough I was driving to church tonight and there was a lot of traffic on Valencia stretch and you know what I just drove I don't know if it's an accident up ahead I don't know what's going on but that's just true I was just so comfortable and this is not a testimony about me but it just goes to show because I knew nothing could stop this message from coming fortunate you are predestinated to be here you know nothing was going to cut me off tonight you know there was no accident no no disappointment no matter what it was I knew before that God had given me these scriptures this message to deliver to you with or without you the message was going home all I had to do was stay committed to his promises and reach and deliver it and by God's grace I Endeavor to do that I go on [Applause] you know and I continue in in that that that that message God had a provided way you know in in paragraph 93 he said Abraham Abraham would No Doubt but no doubt said Thank You Lord I'm so happy to get this this promise that you've given me because here I am I'm old I've always wanted children his own name his father of Nations and he didn't have a child so he's always wanted children so um I'm old and I'd like to have that promise well Abraham went along as if to believe that the baby was going to be born in that same year that's the attitude he had that that baby was going to be born in the same year but you know day by day there was no change and then it went day by day then week by week year by year and no change but the Bible said no if that would be you and I well maybe I don't say but some people they would say oh my God God let me down he tell me I will be a father be a one pass he had three pass what going on like God make a mistake like he forget but no keep in mind we have to prepare for visitation we have to prepare for him to manifest his promise in our lives did keep his his promise and Abraham the Bible said grew strong in God all the time it got greater now he is 75 no 10 years passed he's 85 10 years just think that's when I started preaching these meetings and 10 years past and still nothing happened the first person I ever prayed for but would still be given God praise because it was going to happen why God prepared it God will never give you a promise unless first there is a deposit for it a good man wouldn't give you a check with no money in the bank an honest man wouldn't well God wouldn't give you a check for your salvation or healing lest there was a deposit for it God has prepared for it he told Abraham she was going to have a child and that settled it amen you know oftentimes when exploring I I I I admire the woman with the Lost coin it's a very very interesting story the woman with the Lost coin and just as a background in the second coming of the Lord he said today if a woman was married she should wear a wedding ring as a sign that she's married that's the keep other men from having anything to do with her the look and the Sea she's a married woman in those days they didn't have wedding rings they had a tablet they call it tablet yeah they put it on their head it had 10 coins it went around the head and this is familiar to you I'm just repeating it yeah you know so so it will cause the men to back away because they can see she has a tablet on her head with 10 coins each one of those coins if we only have time but I haven't I'm gonna try to keep my word and you know keep it short and I could tell you each one of those coins had a meaning it was placed in there and each coin meant virtue of that woman the first meaning her loved her husband stuck on a pledge of virtue to live clean for him on the third and fourth and fifth and so on onto the ninth and 10th if you want to look it up look in Galatians 5. you'll find out that woman represented the church and the church is an espouse wife to Christ and the tablet that the church is supposed to wear is found in Galatians 5 which is love joy peace long suffering goodness meekness gentleness patience this is the tablet that's supposed to be worn in the church brought in love kindness Fellowship Etc and this woman when it has been about dark that she realized that she had lost one of those coins or if there ever was a time that the church ought to take inventory find out if you've got all the coins on it should be now it should be tonight it should be right now on the 7th of December yeah the very horns and the clouds of destroying civilization is hanging over the Earth sin and the botch on every hand we're living in a tremendous time where there's wickedness people who go to church just for Hashem people who go to church to try to hide from the meanness people who go to church and profess Christianity and live like the rest of the world drinking smoking gambling woman immorally dressed wearing clothes they ought not to wear in their own dressing room out on the streets before public and broadly love is a thing that's passing almost we have not lost one coin but we've lost practically every one of them this is profit speaking and was getting night and remember her husband would return now although it's a return of her husband I categorize it as a visit in this case she knew beforehand that her husband was going to come at a particular time at a particular day so he is coming from wherever he was doing his business back home so he's about to visit the house he had defied oh sorry and it was getting night and remember her husband would return and if he found out with one of those coins out it showed she had been marked a harlot and if she had defied or defiled herself in any way it would be seen by the people that brought her before the priest and brought witness and she had been found as such a priest recognizing she was a married woman take the coin out and she had been doing wrong and if she had marred her virtue they took that out and you know she had been flitting or showing she wasn't true to her husband that took that one out whatever represented the infringement you know and when her husband returned and had found that she had been marked he would divorce her immediately and have nothing to do with such a woman he had not one such a woman so it was getting toward dark when she realized that she had lost something time for her husband to come and it's getting late the church better be examining themselves by the word of God our Purity our loyalty our devotion we become tatas tale bearers cigarette smokers backbiters painted up Jezebels everything in the calendar that the rest of the world does the Christian church in associating in those things today till you can't hardly tell one from the other how much times we've preached about that we've talked about that we've spoken about that you can hardly tell the difference between the true elect of God the true Bible believe in Christian the true Christian that understands the message and has Faith to believe in the promises a god everybody else now I just run down a little bit and it says it was so late till she had to light a candle and she got a candle not only she got a candle but she got a broom and she went to house cleaning and this is what I referenced before when you're preparing for somebody important you do care what it takes to prepare I know some personally natural they love Christmas so Christmas Eve or late into the wee hours of Christmas morning the bacon ham the cleaning the sowing they're doing whatever they're doing because it's important to them in this case it was important to her that she found a coin that was lost oh brother if there was ever a time to light a candle and send forth the gospel like the Holy Ghost back into the church not so much for emotion not for some Fanatics not for some emotional wake up not for a jump for joy but a heart searching experience men and women get right with God right we're at the end time and she lit a candle to give her light and brother every little candle in here ought to be lit tonight not only that but she got the broom and the neighbors could see the dust flying she had a real house cleaning time for her husband was about to come and if he caught her with one of the points out she was a harlot brother we the Church of the Living God in these great hours that we are now living it behooves us to check up go before God light the candle of the word of the gospel and examine ourselves and find out if we're not falling short and especially when we see all these things coming we're at the end time the coming of Christ is at hand there's not another hope for the world for the a church and look the church is lullian the church has no conscience no more you can hardly wake them up the Bible said a time will come that they'll be in this condition law our Lord delays is coming and they'll be devouring and biting one another and so forth and fighting around that's exactly the hour everything's ready the pages is turned and it was like that and it's ready to coming out of the Lord and I just want to touch on two more things when we talk about preparing for visits and I read the scripture early on I can't help but think about Jesus himself given the promise unto his disciples when he said tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you be intuited with power right so he gave them a direct promise so there should be no doubt as to where the message come from old man who is that why I must have confidence that he say that God say come into this act but in this case you have no excuse right because this is Jesus himself saying listen you you you you I want you all to go a particular place and wait a particular time until a particular experience takes place you know and in the message a time of this decision he said if God required Mary the Blessed Virgin it's an X2 before Mary could enter into the kingdom she had to go up in the upper room she had to wait there like the rest of them did so there was something for her to do she couldn't just sit back and say are waiting you know what you know you know who I am you know I'm entitled to this because I was a wrong long time I was there from his very beginning no she she had to do whatever it took to ensure that when was time for visitation she was in position to get the blessing that he promised so she had to wait there like the rest of them did not until some Minister came and put her name on the book or not when there was some kind of communion given or someone shook a hand or wrote her a letter for her church as we do today but there came a song They Came From Heaven a sound like a Russian Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were certain and they went from these rooms speaking in other languages so filled with the Holy Ghost until they were staggering like they were drunk people the Bible said so and if Mary had to go get that kind of religion to be in glory you'll never get there with anything short of it make up your mind what are you going to do about it it's time of your decision and I just want to skip down here a little bit because I don't want to keep you too long and this this is the last one I want to touch amen all right so in God's provided way and I want to shift a little bit to Moses because this one unlike all the others this was a quite different experience the visitation in the last experience was the Holy Spirit dropping down among the people that were gathered together in the upper room and all the experiences that give thus far with the exception of the woman who lost the coin there was an A positive experience the woman who lost the coin ran the risk of a negative implication to her lack of the coin in in Moses days it was a little different so where I want to highlight is the fact that Moses came out to deliver the people we know that that's given but at time came kind of like no where they had experience a lot of trials and tribulations over a short period of time they had seen plagues farming pestilence all kind of stuff going on and they had reached the end the breaking point where you're about to see the difference but at the same time this that I'm referring to is not just preparation to leave Egypt you know it sounds great and nice and the champagne trying to jump and shout and we say yes we live in Pharaoh we live in Egypt we live in everything behind and that sounds great but there came a requirement for them to prepare in anticipation for the visitation of the Dead Angel and that's what I want to touch just for a few minutes you know in God's provided we paragraph what one would do he said all right I want you to notice and just at that point he said I want you to take the lamb and kill it in the evening perfect type of Christ kill in the evening and then the whole assembly of Israel was to witness the death they did at Christ and the blood was put to be put on the door for that night the death angel was going to ride the land and everywhere there wasn't blood was going to be death so there was a direct negative consequence for their lack of action so if you didn't prepare there was death and I tell your brother if there was a time that the death angel is riding the land it's tonight these are not my words he comes to the church door where the priest stands and a church that's denying the blood and the power of Jesus that's going on there the glory of God has Departed the dead Angel goes in and that settles it they become formal and dead and denying God's power so sometimes you'll wonder why why that you're so quiet boy this is your answer why everybody just calm like they come to watch a movie boy that this is a tea boy but you could see he said this is really the death angel passing because they fail to apply the blood in the church they become formal and dead and denying God's power the first thing you know that is all over the whole group of them you'll never get them to believe anything they can't believe it no watch this that angel I can see the father now they were supposed when the sun went down and the Darkness sat in the ones came under the blood of the lamb and they had to stay under there until marching orders were given brother this is good for your not nazarenes no power off 105. look coming under the blood once under the blood put it on the lintel of the door and on the post but every time a man come through that door into this home he stayed there until marching orders come to go out of Egypt I like that still right there stay there how I consider young ladies going to the parties that night to the young Israelite girls saying come on Rebecca and so forth come on out we're going to and she answered I can't because she was in church right she she probably was on the hookup she probably saw it on her phone and she said listen I'd love to you know I love to go to the party but I can't can't do it and they asked why well we're under the blood we're under the blood oh come on let's go they may tell her come on let's go don't study that blood thing that's nonsense that old crazy religion your daddy's God got there can you imagine in this day they they send yeah a text they send me a WhatsApp or SMS they do a call a video call and they invite you and tell you your parents still go in that church why they still believe that but you're under the blood so it's a different rule for you [Applause] something in my heart tells me that I mustn't go beyond that blood something in my heart this is the trail right now and only went to the big parties and so forth then along about midnight they came they began to come a strange feeling just like coming over the world again no we spoke up a while ago something's wrong great howling Darkness set upon the Earth winds begin to blow I can see the little boy in this home here where we're going to go look at him he says say what is that you're not accustomed to that feeling it's strange it's silent is quiet feel kind of funny I see all the young girls was at the dancers they're hurrying up home oh my it's too late to pray then remember initially I said when you're given the opportunity to prepare is to make ready before it happens after that it's too late so here he says it's too late to pray then now the first thing you know he began to he begins to look around as a little boy and I could hear the little boy say Daddy did the word say that the Allah's son was going to be killing the whom yes well Daddy what about our home son we're just as safe as we can be how do you know we're safe we're obeyed God's word with under the blood I can hear him say just a little later after a while I look out the window little boy does looks there comes two big black wings moving through the air that's death and if there's any time that the black wings has struck the country it's today we've had earthquakes we've had pestilence I'll say we've had all kinds of things that could come to this land and on like they did in Egypt in our time we call it a pandemic we've had things that we have not seen in our lifetime seems strange but the last plague that hit Egypt Before Destruction was death and the last plague that hits the church's spiritual death right that's the last thing they're dying the churches are dying out getting we all we have having protractive meetings but no Revival no Revival they say the great Revival in America tell me where where is the Revival where's this at come on a little bit there again musicians could get ready you say we need what we need is an old-fashioned stirring again where old time John Wesley Revival where they stood and preached all night long and the power of the Holy Ghost falling over the audience that's what we need again amen I need a feel religious right now so listen friend let me tell you something when I think about a great need of this nation and I say of this church we don't need more seminaries we don't need more preachers what we need is what what we've got filled with the Holy Ghost preachers filled with the Holy Ghost that's what we need true as I'm standing here is that the truth no I want you to notice something else that little boy then would watch these Wings go down when it hit a home he heard a scream come but I can hear the little boy say Daddy are you sure that there's blood on there I can see him walk out and look over the door and say yes sir she's covered These Wings start towards that home but when she starts to come down like this she sees the blood he says when I see the blood I will pass will pass over you I will go over that's right on over God's provided way of escape and just as we close I want to touch one more in the message by faith Moses paragraph 121 Prophet said here you can just go a few days and you can stay in the land this is continuing with Moses now Pharaoh may have made offers to them yeah what yeah but go on you could stay in the land you know we could we could allow you to be free and you can just live among us just live like us no you could be free we wouldn't call you slaves anymore will operate differently you go and stay in the land sure he knows they'd be back because he said you can go for a few days and come back we welcome you with moms you could go and return then he found out that wouldn't work so he taught something different he said I'll tell you what to do you go on out anywhere you want to go but leave all your wives all your children all your cattle back here so you're free to go you go you roam you relax you'll be free all the men you all could go on you know you could explore leave your wives the Catholic children and the reason I mentioned this here you see because he knowed they had possession back there that would lead them back and that's what the devil says to you just as long as you leave some of the things of the world hanging on you you still want to smoke you want to drink you want to dress like the world that's as good as the devil wants I hear so much about backsliding I don't believe and this is the prophet now I hear so much about backsliding I don't believe there's so much backsliding as people think they are they just leave too many possessions in Egypt to lay them back that's all backslidings are not what they say it is you left too much of the world back there that lose you brother I tell you when Israel got ready at midnight they had everything they had in this world packed up and ready to go that is preparation packed up and ready to go God sent us a Revival like that we pack up everything and get ready to go the Midnight Cry is coming going out to meet him you better have everything packed up you better not have nothing this will lure in you back any strings will hold you down pack up let's get ready we're going and you know what I tell you there was so true to god Till Pharaoh got so excited at midnight he said get out get out and get going take everything you got and go I'm so glad that a man can live so close to God till the devil don't know what to do with him that's right get out get going obey God by faith he saw the promise he he taken his way with the Lords despise few Pharaoh said take all your guts and get out of here that's why we want the devil to say to us just just take everything and go we don't even want you to stay you don't fit here you don't belong here you're causing too much trouble take all your guts and get out of here I don't know what to do with you he was so true to God by faith by faith will work miracles if you say true to God by faith we see him our time is up past time but by faith and he said this morning I said tonight lift up your eyes don't see what's around you this modern world but look and see him who give the promise the Bible said we don't see all things perfectly now but we do see Jesus you look at him and your ways will be changed prepare
