[47:48] can we just bow our heads for a word of
[47:51] Prayer wherever you are this morning
[47:55] it's a different time is a different
[47:58] season and it would have been perfect if
[48:01] we could have been together here in
[48:03] fellowship in the house of the Lord but
[48:05] as we see prophecy unfolding and the
[48:08] signs of the times and these things we
[48:12] are forced to make adjustments we are
[48:16] forced and and an interruption has come
[48:18] into our lives that has forced a
[48:21] different order of things so right where
[48:23] you are in your homes wherever you are
[48:26] if it's in an office wherever you may be
[48:28] this morning I challenge you to forget
[48:33] everything else wherever you are right
[48:36] now we are declaring it to be holy
[48:38] ground and we want to bow our heads in a
[48:42] word of prayers a body of believers can
[48:45] we pray Heavenly Father we thank you
[48:48] this morning Lord that we could come
[48:50] together Lord in a different kind of a
[48:53] way but we are still together United in
[48:56] faith and united under the blood and
[48:58] united as sons and daughters in this
[49:01] great season that we lived in that does
[49:04] not come as a surprise to us because we
[49:06] have been training for this day we have
[49:08] been preparing for this day all these
[49:10] years of hearing the message of your
[49:13] great prophet and Lord messenger brother
[49:15] Branham we stand here sons and daughters
[49:18] of God Lord both here in Trinidad and
[49:21] Lord all over the world Lord we're sons
[49:24] and daughters are gathered at different
[49:27] times in different ways as Lord we seek
[49:30] to be ready for your soon coming
[49:32] Lord this whole situation as it were
[49:35] came upon us all of a sudden Lord and
[49:39] before we could even realize the
[49:41] magnitude of it order of the world has
[49:43] changed Travel has changed work
[49:47] situations have changed the way we do
[49:50] church has change the way we meet and
[49:52] interact with family has changed and it
[49:55] will never be the same again because
[49:57] Lord you are putting things in order for
[50:00] the coming of the Lord and lord I want
[50:03] to challenge your people from everywhere
[50:05] to see the spiritual happenings that are
[50:08] taking place that Lord at what's
[50:11] happening in the spiritual realm is
[50:13] being reflected in the natural realm in
[50:15] the economic realm in the ecclesiastical
[50:17] realm in the Lord every facet of the
[50:21] world is being Lord touched Lord by the
[50:24] divine plan of God to do things a
[50:26] certain way Lord many of it will be
[50:29] beyond our understanding but through
[50:31] your word Lord you have taught us how to
[50:33] prepare Lord I pray that you would bless
[50:36] the service today that Lord you will
[50:38] touch your people that you would touch
[50:40] your sons and daughters father Lord
[50:42] those that need an extra touch those
[50:44] that need an extra encouragement there
[50:46] are those that are wondering about their
[50:49] jobs and wondering about their lives and
[50:51] wondering about their situations law but
[50:54] as the psalmist even said I've never
[50:56] seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed
[50:58] begging comfort in knowing that you are
[51:02] more than able to take care of your
[51:04] children Lord as we find ourselves under
[51:08] the law the message of the hour we take
[51:11] comfort in knowing that we know what's
[51:13] unfolding before us and we come this
[51:15] morning law to be reminded in a simple
[51:18] way that we can Lord and this Sunday
[51:20] morning law we don't know where next
[51:23] we'll be able to come together we don't
[51:25] know Lord but we know who holds tomorrow
[51:27] and we know that you're in charge of
[51:30] everything and you are in control of
[51:32] everything so Lord we come here this
[51:34] morning Lord just a handful of
[51:36] brothers just handle everything that we

[53:34] beyond being in one physical location
[53:36] and you are more enabled this morning to
[53:39] minister to the heirs of salvation
[53:42] lomi you bless the reading of the word
[53:44] and bless the speaking of it we ask in a
[53:46] precious name of Jesus Christ
[53:48] and the believers say Amen honey men any
[53:52] men I greet you this morning in the
[53:55] precious name of Jesus Christ and if you
[53:59] have your Bibles just before I say a few
[54:01] comments before we're over comes to
[54:04] speak this morning I just want to read
[54:07] from one portion of scripture from first
[54:10] Thessalonians 5 first Thessalonians 5
[54:14] and from verse 1
[54:16] first Thessalonians 5 and verse 1 but at
[54:21] the times and seasons brethren ye have
[54:23] no need that I write unto you for
[54:28] yourselves know perfectly that the day
[54:30] of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the
[54:32] night for when they shall say peace and
[54:35] safety then sudden destruction cometh
[54:37] upon them as travail upon a woman with
[54:40] child and they shall not escape but he
[54:43] brethren and not in darkness that that
[54:46] day should overtake you as a thief
[54:48] ye are the children of light and the
[54:51] churun of the day we are not of the
[54:53] night nor of darkness therefore let us
[54:56] not sleep as do others but let us watch
[54:58] and be sober for they that sleep sleep
[55:01] in the night and they that be drunken
[55:03] are drunken in the night but let us who
[55:07] are of the day be sober putting on the
[55:09] breastplate of faith and love and for an
[55:11] helmet the hope of salvation for God
[55:15] hath not anointed us to wrath but to
[55:17] obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus
[55:20] Christ who died for us that whether we
[55:23] wake or sleep we should live together
[55:25] with him wherefore comfort yourselves
[55:29] together and edify one another even as
[55:32] also he do be the Lord had a blessing to
[55:37] the reading of his word if you're
[55:40] standing in your home's you may be
[55:42] seated
[55:42] there's no one standing here in the
[55:45] church so it's quite a time that we are
[55:48] living in
[55:50] so I greet you once again in the
[55:53] precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[55:56] and you know it's interesting for the
[56:00] last few months I in closing out many of
[56:03] the services I've been seeing that one
[56:06] of these days we'll have the last
[56:07] service we never really knew how that
[56:11] would unfold and we didn't know that
[56:12] this is the situation there's no way at
[56:15] the beginning of this year 2020 that we
[56:18] would see this is the situation that
[56:20] we're in that we have to speak through
[56:22] technology to be able to address the
[56:25] church but this is this is it and what
[56:29] we have been speaking about for all
[56:31] these years and what the Prophet spoke
[56:33] about for all these years so quickly we
[56:35] see that in different ways different
[56:37] things have changed people who love to
[56:41] be call it outside as it were love to be
[56:44] doing whatever they want to do in in
[56:47] meeting people and doing these things
[56:49] suddenly there's an interruption that no
[56:51] matter what plan you had in life you are
[56:55] forced to adjust the adjustment was not
[56:59] a willing adjustment it was an
[57:01] adjustment that was forced upon you
[57:03] because it became an issue of life and
[57:05] death we have countries governments
[57:07] leaders here in Trinidad and Tobago our
[57:09] own prime minister call for National Day
[57:12] of Prayer and people are trying to
[57:15] connect to that the Pope is calling for
[57:17] prayer different governments are calling
[57:19] for prayer and sometimes it seems that
[57:21] if it was only true crisis people want
[57:24] to turn to God and in the midst of all
[57:27] of this we are being challenged to get
[57:30] ready to leave here suddenly people have
[57:33] time on their hands being forced
[57:36] if it's to stay at home forced and we
[57:39] now have new words and phrases that we
[57:41] never knew about social distancing
[57:44] self-isolation these things never
[57:47] existed before in common language as it
[57:51] were or normal language but here it is
[57:53] it's something that every day is is
[57:55] into us stay in your home don't go
[57:58] outside because if you go outside you
[58:02] don't know what's gonna happen to you if
[58:04] you go outside you don't know what
[58:06] you're gonna meet if you go outside you
[58:07] don't know if you're gonna catch this
[58:09] virus and as all of this is unfolding
[58:11] I'm looking at the spiritual side of it
[58:13] because in that day in Egypt when the
[58:16] death angel was about to pass you have
[58:18] to stay in the house with the token
[58:20] applied on your doorpost and you could
[58:22] not go outside if you wanted to you had
[58:25] to stay inside to stay under the token
[58:27] and I was looking as it unfolded and as
[58:31] airports begin to close and as planes
[58:34] began to come down from the end and now
[58:36] airports are parking lots for planes
[58:39] people can fly where they want to go
[58:42] business meetings are canceled
[58:44] conferences are canceled companies have
[58:46] to close because what they offer is no
[58:49] longer needed we now use languages as
[58:52] essential services and non-essential
[58:55] services and people ask themselves the
[58:57] question is what I do essential or not
[58:59] essential but yet in the midst of all of
[59:02] that God is doing something because as
[59:04] everything unfolds he who knows the
[59:07] future and he holds tomorrow he
[59:09] understands what has to happen and what
[59:11] is happening as Paul said in the
[59:14] scripture we read I have no need to
[59:17] bring to your consciousness what has
[59:19] taken place because you should know this
[59:20] thing because this was prophesied by a
[59:23] prophet and was written through the
[59:24] world all these years of a time that
[59:27] would come when they will close down the
[59:29] churches when you can't buy or sell
[59:31] unless you take the mark on you can't do
[59:33] what you want a new system a new world
[59:35] order and all these things are
[59:36] performing the foundation of it former
[59:41] British Prime Minister Gordon Brown I
[59:43] believe said we need one government in
[59:45] the world because in trying to enforce
[59:48] the quarantine and the isolations not
[59:51] all countries are moving as he should
[59:53] and if we had a one-world government we
[59:55] would have more structure more system
[59:58] will be able to more effectively deal
[1:00:00] with this everything that has to unfold
[1:00:03] needs a trigger needs a spot
[1:00:06] Dawid what happens next right now there
[1:00:10] are people who are from this country
[1:00:12] Trinidad and Tobago who cannot come home
[1:00:15] because our airports are closed they are
[1:00:18] pleading from different countries bring
[1:00:20] us home and our Prime Minister says no
[1:00:22] we cannot open the door because we have
[1:00:26] to keep it closed to keep the country
[1:00:29] quarantined in their minds have a right
[1:00:32] or reason or in their hearts to see
[1:00:34] where we deserve to be here but he says
[1:00:36] no the door is closed you cannot come in
[1:00:39] that's man shutting the door what a time
[1:00:43] we're living in when man makes a
[1:00:45] decision that we're not gonna open the
[1:00:47] airport we're not gonna fly a plane
[1:00:49] we're never because safety and peace is
[1:00:52] what we trying to create and I think
[1:00:54] back to the days of Noah
[1:00:55] it wasn't Noah who shut the door but it
[1:00:58] was God who shut the door doors that
[1:01:00] were outside could not come in those
[1:01:03] that were inside could not go out these
[1:01:05] are all shadows and all examples of of
[1:01:09] what's about to be greater because even
[1:01:11] though we cannot meet physically this
[1:01:13] morning you can still hear what I'm
[1:01:15] saying but a brand I'm spoke of a time
[1:01:16] when we won't even be able to speak we
[1:01:19] won't even be able to explain what's
[1:01:21] happening we won't be even able to tell
[1:01:23] you what's about to take place can the
[1:01:25] church say man will come to an end and
[1:01:29] end of the systems of this world and
[1:01:32] enter the way things operate can the
[1:01:35] church say man so I just want to take a
[1:01:39] quick thought and we've been having some
[1:01:40] technical challenges with the internet
[1:01:43] and if you tracking it in different
[1:01:45] countries governments are asking the
[1:01:47] companies that handle the streaming and
[1:01:49] things to put controls on the internet
[1:01:52] because everybody's at home watching
[1:01:54] something everybody's at home looking at
[1:01:56] something and the reality is we have
[1:01:59] time if I can say that on our hands and
[1:02:02] we have to make a choice with what we do
[1:02:05] this is a season when being a Christian
[1:02:08] is not based on who is looking at you
[1:02:10] it's based on you looking at yourself
[1:02:11] and looking at the word because there's
[1:02:14] nobody around there's no gathering of
[1:02:16] people to to hold you accountable to
[1:02:18] what
[1:02:19] you did and what you see I'm not the
[1:02:21] preacher this morning but I want to
[1:02:23] encourage you this morning before the
[1:02:25] minister comes to the pulpit that this
[1:02:28] is a season that is different and we
[1:02:30] don't know how long it's gonna last but
[1:02:32] we want to be ready when he comes I
[1:02:36] preach a message some time ago
[1:02:39] positionally placed before the terrible
[1:02:42] plague strike and that's a quote from
[1:02:45] the Prophet when he spoke about we are
[1:02:48] to strive to be positionally placed
[1:02:50] before the terrible plague strike and if
[1:02:54] this is something then I believe in my
[1:02:56] heart there's more to come this is just
[1:02:58] a first wave of more to come because
[1:03:01] demons are working on every hand and
[1:03:03] with a random and a message demonology
[1:03:05] religious realm he said and today my
[1:03:08] dear Christian friend demons are working
[1:03:10] on every hand and God's Spirit moving
[1:03:13] right out on the other hand to corrupt
[1:03:15] to counteract it every single time and
[1:03:18] it's a foreshadow of the great showdown
[1:03:21] that's coming pretty soon between God
[1:03:23] and the devil
[1:03:24] but abandom Christ I'll get on go
[1:03:26] outside and be right in your heart but
[1:03:29] the Randleman adapter he said we should
[1:03:31] be so on fire for God we should be going
[1:03:34] day and night nothing should be able to
[1:03:37] stop us and we should be so sweet and so
[1:03:39] pleasant and so kind so christ-like in
[1:03:42] our lives but over in the prayer meeting
[1:03:45] on Friday night you were saying don't
[1:03:48] spend all your time watching movies now
[1:03:51] you have time any hands what are you
[1:03:52] doing with your time in the natural
[1:03:55] realm jobs that existed before this may
[1:03:58] not exist after this so young people
[1:04:01] what are you doing are you just gonna
[1:04:04] sit down home and say when I'm home if
[1:04:07] you've never spent time on your knees
[1:04:10] before this is the time to spend on your
[1:04:12] knees as you have never done before take
[1:04:15] the time and stay at home and in the
[1:04:18] self isolation to look into the world
[1:04:20] and see the examples that God had set
[1:04:23] before us that we could take strength
[1:04:25] from the heart of the diligent and from
[1:04:27] the way that we ought to be a sons and
[1:04:30] daughters
[1:04:30] time such as these all of what is
[1:04:34] happening reminds me of the story of
[1:04:36] Noah and if I could take a thought it's
[1:04:39] get into Christ the Ark of safety just
[1:04:43] for a few minutes that's what I want to
[1:04:45] speak on before bird overcomes get into
[1:04:47] Christ the Ark of safety and in Genesis
[1:04:51] we know the story of Noah man had fallen
[1:04:54] from his position the man that God had
[1:04:58] placed on the earth was not where God
[1:05:00] had set him up to be he had fallen and
[1:05:03] fallen and fallen until God was moved to
[1:05:06] do something about it
[1:05:07] home life was not what it was nothing
[1:05:12] was that it wasn't God was push to do
[1:05:14] something about it he was pushed to
[1:05:17] intervene father's fallen from their
[1:05:20] position mother's fallen from their
[1:05:22] position now what's the excuse now it
[1:05:26] wasn't hard to go to work so I couldn't
[1:05:27] have family prayer I had to go to the
[1:05:29] grocery souk I couldn't know what I want
[1:05:31] to do but now that we were all locked
[1:05:33] into our homes and at midnight tonight
[1:05:35] we have nowhere to go unless it's
[1:05:37] critical what's your Excuse
[1:05:40] the time to travel to work that time is
[1:05:42] now your time the time to meet somebody
[1:05:45] that time is now your time the time to
[1:05:49] gather with friends that time is now
[1:05:51] your time and we have a choice a space
[1:05:54] of grace as it were to make sure that
[1:05:57] your calling and your election is sure
[1:06:00] and only a few will take the opportunity
[1:06:04] as it were because even though Noah
[1:06:06] preached for year upon a year that
[1:06:08] judgment was coming and people heard the
[1:06:10] cry they did not take action they did
[1:06:14] not respond
[1:06:15] I wonder out of this situation how many
[1:06:18] people will respond I wonder how many
[1:06:21] people would have to see more of this
[1:06:24] before the cry goes in their heart that
[1:06:26] they must have the Holy Ghost that they
[1:06:29] cannot depend on their knowledge of the
[1:06:31] message they cannot depend on the
[1:06:33] knowledge of the Bible without the Holy
[1:06:35] Ghost you are lost you are finished
[1:06:37] it was said and you hear these viruses
[1:06:40] respect politicians this viruses in
[1:06:44] respect aegis viruses in respect country
[1:06:47] this viruses in respect immigration laws
[1:06:50] this virus has respect customs laws this
[1:06:53] viral Pharaohs can move from country to
[1:06:55] country it can move from family to
[1:06:57] family it can move from house to house
[1:06:59] and in the same way this virus is
[1:07:02] contagious it's the same way the forces
[1:07:04] of demon are also contagious moving from
[1:07:07] father to son
[1:07:08] moving from brother to brother evil
[1:07:11] spirits and the same way we are being
[1:07:13] challenged to quarantine ourselves and
[1:07:16] self isolate from this Corona of Harris
[1:07:18] is the same way I challenge you to make
[1:07:21] your house a safe zone to make your
[1:07:24] family a safe zone by applying the blood
[1:07:27] by putting a token upon your life put in
[1:07:31] the token above your family shame on you
[1:07:34] if you haven't had a family altar shame
[1:07:36] on you if you haven't come together and
[1:07:38] begin to cry say Lord we need you more
[1:07:41] than ever before come to church say man
[1:07:46] we need more we need more we need more
[1:07:49] and we having some technical challenges
[1:07:51] but we'll upload the service when it's
[1:07:53] over you make sure on watch that you
[1:07:55] make sure and share it you make sure one
[1:07:57] play it play it today play tomorrow
[1:08:00] instead of Netflix and YouTube and do it
[1:08:03] all these other things you get onto the
[1:08:05] channel and you watch the services catch
[1:08:08] up on what you missed make every day a
[1:08:10] service day for you we have been locked
[1:08:13] in and this is not strange on the day of
[1:08:15] Pentecost leading up to the Pentecost
[1:08:17] they hadn't locked themselves in the
[1:08:19] room because I didn't want to interact
[1:08:21] with the world the pilot said they were
[1:08:23] afraid they had locked himself up but
[1:08:25] you have prayer of fear but they were in
[1:08:27] there crying out for something and then
[1:08:30] all of a sudden the Bible says no Holy
[1:08:32] Ghost fell upon them on the day of
[1:08:35] Pentecost could it be that in the same
[1:08:37] season all of a sudden the Holy Ghost
[1:08:40] could drop down into your home all of a
[1:08:43] sudden the Holy Ghost can trap down you
[1:08:45] to your family all
[1:08:47] sudden the holy ghost overnight up he
[1:08:49] couldn't move the same way this virus
[1:08:51] has moved overnight it's the same way we
[1:08:54] tryna start another kind of contagious
[1:08:56] effector of the same holy lows could
[1:08:59] fall upon the Apostles you could fall
[1:09:01] upon the Christians can the church say
[1:09:03] man hallelujah
[1:09:07] every attack that attacked Isis is a
[1:09:11] force that's moving it's a force that we
[1:09:13] cannot see the US president says we are
[1:09:16] war and we are fighting an invisible
[1:09:18] enemy this is not new terminology we
[1:09:21] have been at war and we are fighting an
[1:09:24] invisible enemy but we are not ignorant
[1:09:27] of Satan's devices so we are very
[1:09:30] careful we are looking to see how he's
[1:09:32] moving so that not only can we defend
[1:09:34] but we could also attack and I say we
[1:09:39] need to be on the offensive this morning
[1:09:41] not to in crazy think what are your
[1:09:43] ffensive and prayer the offensive
[1:09:45] evaporation because the time is at hand
[1:09:48] I'm getting ready to close out are you
[1:09:53] in the Ark of safety God has allowed us
[1:09:58] to be called aside call aside from
[1:10:01] groups call aside from doctrine and the
[1:10:04] way we do things to us being in our
[1:10:06] homes as it will call aside from our
[1:10:10] understanding of the message to
[1:10:11] confronting the reality of how will I
[1:10:14] eat next month or two months if I lose
[1:10:16] my job it requires not a dependence on
[1:10:19] the pasta but the dependence on God it
[1:10:22] requires not only dependence on
[1:10:24] government because soon the government
[1:10:25] will run out of money can the church
[1:10:28] here ma'am and it will force us back to
[1:10:30] the gold standard all these things are
[1:10:32] not foreign to us it has been prophesied
[1:10:35] and so shall it be fear not little flock
[1:10:39] it is my father's goodwill it's his
[1:10:41] pleasure
[1:10:42] it's his desire to give us a kingdom and
[1:10:45] I say this morning the kingdom of the
[1:10:47] Lord is at hand it's right there every
[1:10:50] day we are getting closer to the rapture
[1:10:52] because call will not allow
[1:10:54] yes bright oh go on she's gonna be
[1:10:57] raised up that's what the rapture is for
[1:11:00] hallelujah where the Brandon preached it
[1:11:04] the death angel wasn't asking what trial
[1:11:07] are you in that that angel wasn't asking
[1:11:10] what church you go to
[1:11:11] the Death Angel wasn't asking who your
[1:11:13] pasta is the Death Angel was just
[1:11:16] looking for the token and in this first
[1:11:20] wave of attack that we are seeing and
[1:11:22] there'll be more to come only their
[1:11:25] tokens only their token only their token
[1:11:30] if there's one prayer you have in your
[1:11:32] heart let it be for the token apply it
[1:11:35] upon your home apply it on your life
[1:11:38] apply it on your daily walk you have to
[1:11:41] work from home apply the token Oh
[1:11:43] hallelujah God has given you a space of
[1:11:46] grace you know when you got in a job all
[1:11:49] that's happening in the workplace God
[1:11:51] has allowed you to bribe to be pull
[1:11:53] aside now you can take lunch
[1:11:55] I know buddies deal with you somebody
[1:11:57] help me this morning I don't have a
[1:11:59] group here to give me back but you give
[1:12:01] back response when you at your home
[1:12:04] Oh hallelujah the gossip that takes
[1:12:07] place on a lunchtime in your workplace
[1:12:09] that can't affect you right now you
[1:12:12] could take your lunch time and you can
[1:12:14] tarry with Jesus come on now come on now
[1:12:17] young people I remember young people
[1:12:21] asking questions how do you deal with
[1:12:23] the music and the maxi when you're
[1:12:25] traveling home from work and you're
[1:12:26] traveling home from school and the
[1:12:28] distractions in the mall and all these
[1:12:31] things what happens when these things
[1:12:33] don't affect you anymore
[1:12:34] there's no more to go - there's no maxi
[1:12:37] to take there's no taxi to take oh I'm
[1:12:40] preaching myself this morning I don't
[1:12:42] need people in the church to have to
[1:12:44] preacher it's in the inside of me the
[1:12:47] world is coming to an end
[1:12:48] are you ready to get out of here are you
[1:12:52] ready God has cut the ties cut the
[1:12:54] attachments cut away the friends from
[1:12:56] you it's time to connect to Jesus it's
[1:12:59] time to connect to God it's time to
[1:13:02] connect to the sauce because he can feed
[1:13:04] you when the cross he has no food
[1:13:06] he can make away when there seems to be
[1:13:09] no way and he is to the Great Physician
[1:13:11] he is still the best doctor that the
[1:13:13] world has ever seen
[1:13:16] hallelujah
[1:13:18] you have to forgive me but I can't stop
[1:13:21] I can't stop trust in God I can't stop
[1:13:24] serving God I can't stop praising God I
[1:13:28] want to know that I know that I'm in the
[1:13:30] Ark of safety I don't want to take it
[1:13:32] for granted
[1:13:33] God has brought us face to face with the
[1:13:36] reality that is not about a group it's
[1:13:40] about the individual it's a reality that
[1:13:43] you could be in your house and ready to
[1:13:45] do what you want to do you choose to do
[1:13:48] what God wants you to do that's the real
[1:13:50] Christian hallelujah hallelujah what
[1:13:57] will you do friends what will you do
[1:14:00] with this grace what will you do with
[1:14:02] this opportunity what will you do it
[1:14:05] this time because I believe we don't
[1:14:08] know what I believe that this situation
[1:14:10] will also pass but there'll come a time
[1:14:12] when the situation will not pass because
[1:14:16] God promised a judge this world and he
[1:14:18] said it but Abraham said even God
[1:14:20] doesn't judge this world he'll have to
[1:14:22] go tEEX fundament Amaro and raise it up
[1:14:24] again and apologize for them but the
[1:14:26] court I serve as a see me yesterday
[1:14:28] today and forever and the same reason he
[1:14:31] judged Sodom and Gomorrah is the same
[1:14:33] reason you touch this world now the
[1:14:39] develops an America rejected God and
[1:14:42] country is not just America every
[1:14:44] country
[1:14:49] have heard people who have no
[1:14:53] relationship with God putting a post
[1:14:55] about praying and putting a post but God
[1:14:58] help us and heal our nation and heal our
[1:15:00] land and the next post is their drinking
[1:15:02] next pose they're trying to drown their
[1:15:05] sorrows because God is yes this talisman
[1:15:10] for them this this this thing you cry to
[1:15:13] and every problem and hope things work
[1:15:14] out but what is happening now is
[1:15:18] unprecedented in history because every
[1:15:22] situation Scimitar is in the past did
[1:15:24] not the technology we have now to make
[1:15:26] us conscious of the gravity of what's
[1:15:29] unfolding before us knowledge has
[1:15:33] increased sounds familiar that's the
[1:15:34] Bible and in the age when knowledge has
[1:15:37] increased riches have increased and in a
[1:15:40] this Laodicean age I have need of
[1:15:42] nothing now whether you're rich or poor
[1:15:46] you have to isolate yourself I saw some
[1:15:53] drone footage of different parts of the
[1:15:54] world where there's nobody on the street
[1:15:57] where you have money or you don't have
[1:15:59] money you cannot go outside on the
[1:16:02] street because somehow no matter what
[1:16:05] people have achieved they value their
[1:16:07] lives more than going out to get money
[1:16:10] they value their lives more than and
[1:16:13] then there are those who who are just
[1:16:15] simply I don't even know how to describe
[1:16:17] them foolish
[1:16:23] foolish because they air all the
[1:16:25] announcements they see all the cases of
[1:16:27] death being spoken about around the
[1:16:29] world and yet still they don't want to
[1:16:32] take the right action so it doesn't
[1:16:35] surprise me when people come to church
[1:16:37] for years and they don't take the right
[1:16:39] action when we tell them get into the
[1:16:42] Ark of safety and they still want to go
[1:16:44] out and do something else
[1:16:47] politics is not important I took my wife
[1:16:50] a few days ago I said I do want to see
[1:16:52] the news anymore
[1:16:54] because it doesn't help the situation
[1:16:57] it's just more information more noise
[1:17:01] it's more distraction not that I don't
[1:17:04] have sympathy or empathy or concern or
[1:17:06] desire but the reality is when you're
[1:17:10] locked in your house what can you do but
[1:17:13] pray when you're locked in your house
[1:17:16] what can you do but seek the Lord for
[1:17:19] you and your house is just what cried
[1:17:20] out as for me and my house we will serve
[1:17:24] the Lord
[1:17:25] as a musician began a play I just wanted
[1:17:29] to greet the church and share something
[1:17:31] with you because after tonight at
[1:17:33] midnight at least for the next two weeks
[1:17:36] we are more restricted and we were
[1:17:38] before so we don't know
[1:17:40] we'll use the technology to stream and
[1:17:42] different things but I pray that you
[1:17:44] will take this time to get called a
[1:17:47] sight of God it is not God's desire that
[1:17:50] this is how we operate in this kind of a
[1:17:52] way because he wants us together even as
[1:17:55] they approaches and we know that the end
[1:17:58] is not yet because he said this gospel
[1:18:00] must be preached and then the end shall
[1:18:02] come but we are closing on to the final
[1:18:05] chapters of this book so when we get to
[1:18:08] come back out we have to push more than
[1:18:11] we ever push before we are required to
[1:18:13] do more than we ever done before to keep
[1:18:16] your job in this economy you need to do
[1:18:18] more II ever did before
[1:18:21] because the demands of change the
[1:18:24] requirements of change people are
[1:18:26] realizing that what they thought was
[1:18:28] important was not important
[1:18:32] oh god help us draw me nearer Jesus
[1:18:37] draw me nearer I spent a bow a heart
[1:18:46] somewhere has one more time as I pray
[1:18:48] before the passing is ready to come up
[1:18:52] I don't know how many are hearing me
[1:18:55] right now I don't know how many are
[1:18:57] connected and if it will be the team
[1:18:59] that you will listen to but whatever
[1:19:02] you're doing right now I want you to
[1:19:03] stop stop the distraction this is not
[1:19:06] the time to cook and watch your service
[1:19:08] clean and watch the service that's not
[1:19:10] it half Church let it be Church in your
[1:19:13] house let it be Church in your life take
[1:19:16] away every other distraction bow your
[1:19:17] heads close your eyes this is you and
[1:19:19] God the same presence Jesus to the end
[1:19:22] from the Centurion and he spoke and that
[1:19:25] Centurion knew that we're servant was
[1:19:28] that the presence of God had a veil
[1:19:30] himself and done something that he got
[1:19:33] us at what time that cigar we serve
[1:19:37] [Music]
[1:19:39] may his presence move through your room
[1:19:43] right now
[1:19:44] may his presence move into your home
[1:19:47] right now every head bowed every eye
[1:19:51] closed Heavenly Father we come this
[1:19:54] morning as a people trying to do what
[1:19:58] you said to do and still be in
[1:20:01] compliance with the law of the land
[1:20:02] rendering to Caesar what is Caesar's
[1:20:05] Lord law said no more than 10 people and
[1:20:09] Lord we wish we could have had every one
[1:20:11] but we have to have a musician somebody
[1:20:14] behind the camera somebody behind the
[1:20:16] streaming somebody behind a song service
[1:20:19] and Lord we had to choose just a handful
[1:20:21] of brothers Lord be able to have this
[1:20:24] service that Lord we can fulfill at the
[1:20:27] same time being in your house but at the
[1:20:29] same time being in fellowship with our
[1:20:32] brothers and sisters in their homes that
[1:20:34] we could still be one church one group
[1:20:37] of people Lord connected by blood
[1:20:39] connected by predestination and law we
[1:20:42] don't take this for granted Lord their
[1:20:46] time is Lord in the past when we should
[1:20:48] have been in church and we didn't make
[1:20:51] it important so we miss church and now
[1:20:53] Lord we can't even be in church we don't
[1:20:56] know how long it's gonna last but father
[1:20:58] we repent Lord I'm not doing all that we
[1:21:01] can do and take him for granted lower
[1:21:04] the opportunity to be together in
[1:21:06] fellowship we many of us took it for
[1:21:08] granted law we won't do that no more we
[1:21:11] can't afford to do that no more because
[1:21:14] Lord we want to be ready we want to Lord
[1:21:17] be with the people who are being on the
[1:21:19] other side Lord Lord the world is just
[1:21:22] distractions it's just trying to pull us
[1:21:24] this way and that way but Lord you give
[1:21:27] us grace that we could look up Lord to a

[1:29:29] the spirit again to fear but you have
[1:29:31] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[1:29:33] we cry Abba Father the spirit itself

[1:30:31] here we are happy to be here this
[1:30:33] morning and
[1:30:34] I'll read something from what but Isaac
[1:30:37] referred to from the British former
[1:30:39] Prime Minister Gordon Brown you spoke
[1:30:41] that this is on Thursday 26th a
[1:30:43] one-world government needed to cope with
[1:30:46] kovat 19 seized former British prime
[1:30:48] minister a former British prime minister
[1:30:51] has called for the creation of a global
[1:30:54] government to cope with the corner of
[1:30:56] the corona virus pandemic Gordon Brown
[1:30:59] who was both prime minister and leaders
[1:31:01] of Britain's left-wing Labour Party from
[1:31:03] 2007 until 2010 told the British media
[1:31:06] that the world government he proposed
[1:31:09] would address the medical and financial
[1:31:12] crisis caused by kovat 19 it will direct
[1:31:16] efforts to find a vaccine for the virus
[1:31:18] organises production and purchase and
[1:31:20] stop profit ears it will also direct the
[1:31:23] response of central banks protecting
[1:31:25] emerging world markets and agree a joint
[1:31:29] approach to use of government spending
[1:31:31] to boost growth The Guardian reported
[1:31:33] that bran would have liked the United
[1:31:35] Nations Security Council to have been
[1:31:38] invited to an emergency online meeting
[1:31:40] of the g20 countries today the meeting
[1:31:44] hosted by Saudi Arabia is tackling the
[1:31:46] issue of the north novel coronavirus
[1:31:49] oh my this this is words this is not
[1:31:55] something that can be dealt with in one
[1:31:57] country Bronk said there has to be a
[1:32:00] coordinated global response so you see
[1:32:04] how it's being set up now that is a need
[1:32:06] to get this super leader to get this
[1:32:09] world government that will cover a
[1:32:12] thority over the entire world Oh
[1:32:14] hallelujah
[1:32:16] doing the worldwide financial crisis of
[1:32:19] 2008 then Prime Minister Brown convinced
[1:32:22] the other global leaders of the need to
[1:32:24] bail out the banks then he hosted a g20
[1:32:27] countries at a summit in London which
[1:32:29] came up with a one point one trillion
[1:32:31] rescue package contemplating the
[1:32:34] emergent financial crisis Brown believes
[1:32:36] that there should be advocacy for the
[1:32:38] emerging world markets within the g20
[1:32:40] countries through this purple grocer
[1:32:42] task force we need some sort of work in
[1:32:45] eggs
[1:32:45] give if I were doing it again I would
[1:32:49] make the g20 a broader organization
[1:32:52] because in the current circumstance you
[1:32:54] need to listen to the countries that are
[1:32:55] most affected the countries that are
[1:32:57] making a number of people to be affected
[1:33:00] such as those in Africa he said also
[1:33:02] that the World Bank and the
[1:33:04] International Monetary Fund need as the
[1:33:06] garden preference and increased it a
[1:33:08] financial firepower to cope with the
[1:33:10] impact of the crisis impact of low and
[1:33:12] middle income countries
[1:33:13] oh my so what has been proposed here is
[1:33:17] a world government to deal with pandemic
[1:33:19] and the economics the conditions that we
[1:33:24] are seeing around us now is confirming
[1:33:26] what this 20th century prophet said this
[1:33:30] is a preview of the press right now
[1:33:33] right now all of a sudden almost
[1:33:36] overnight around the world churches have
[1:33:39] to be pushed aside everything shut up
[1:33:42] this is a preview you know this reminds
[1:33:44] me of when jesus told his disciples when
[1:33:47] you see Jerusalem compassed the wrong
[1:33:50] with armies flee to the mountain Oh
[1:33:52] glory to God and when they came and
[1:33:54] surrounded Jerusalem they couldn't go
[1:33:56] out but something had to happen Oh glory
[1:33:59] they've got to pull it the Army's back
[1:34:01] and then the guy had to go back because
[1:34:03] they had a new emperor back in Rome or
[1:34:06] wherever and when the armies pull back
[1:34:07] the true believers fly out Oh glory to
[1:34:10] God that took that as a rehearsal they
[1:34:12] took that as a sign because jesus said
[1:34:14] when you see Jerusalem compassed with
[1:34:17] armies get out idea or glory to God but
[1:34:20] you saw what's around already armies but
[1:34:22] they remember Jesus words and as soon as
[1:34:25] the army pullback it give a little
[1:34:27] interest to get out of the air all glory
[1:34:29] and here we are because in a preview it
[1:34:31] is live this is not a rehearsal this is
[1:34:34] live a live preview of things that are
[1:34:37] to be or Chloe got caught and it
[1:34:40] wouldn't be a national thing you know it
[1:34:41] would be an international thing every
[1:34:44] law will be enforced and if they go to
[1:34:46] enforce their laws we have lost also
[1:34:49] that God is going to enforce because the
[1:34:52] Holy Ghost is here
[1:34:53] enforce the laws of God or give the Lord
[1:34:56] a shout Oh hallelujah praise call so we
[1:35:00] understand now by prophecy the churches
[1:35:03] will be closed down we understand the
[1:35:05] reason why there will be a force in he
[1:35:08] said national force put Israel in the
[1:35:10] homeland national force we put the
[1:35:13] church in a work on the churches but the

[1:35:33] so God is cutting down the work
[1:35:37] hallelujah hallelujah national force put
[1:35:41] attrition to work on switches but the
[1:35:43] power of God would put the people in the
[1:35:46] brain isn't that right no national force
[1:35:48] will do it but the national force did
[1:35:51] drive Israel to the homeland the
[1:35:52] National forces of the Council of
[1:35:54] Churches will try every organization
[1:35:56] into it but the power of God will reach

[1:47:40] perfected true organization
[1:47:45] it gets further away from God all the
[1:47:48] time
[1:47:48] and further from each other governments
[1:47:51] afield these people is their own and
[1:47:53] they'll lock them down with the owner to

[1:48:17] this business it gets fully from God all
[1:48:19] the time I'm food from each other we
[1:48:21] drop barriers we separate ourselves
[1:48:23] seemingly not having a feet here is bad
[1:48:25] but then when we leave those principles
[1:48:29] of doctrine if we move on to perfection
[1:48:33] then those little things become of not
[1:48:37] much use here is Bom
[1:48:39] we go into a relationship maybe ceases
[1:48:45] that statement is super super super that
[1:48:48] is off the charts you know they say me
[1:48:51] I'm a Baptist we could have about this
[1:48:54] doctrine I'm a Methodist I'm at his
[1:48:57] doctrine I am sexy you know see half
[1:48:59] seal I'm a pre and press either way call
[1:49:01] time and who playing tape in the church
[1:49:03] yes we just press on play I'm a press on
[1:49:05] play I'm aptitude and so on
[1:49:07] and all these different teachings and
[1:49:09] doctrines make the people feel that does
[1:49:12] it open
[1:49:14] I have you best mints any country are
[1:49:17] the best group I this group but when you
[1:49:24] come down to the real deal it has to be
[1:49:29] a relationship not teach him how could
[1:49:34] God give somebody PO and God you know
[1:49:36] them they know about God they know what
[1:49:41] God say they could court God but they
[1:49:43] know don't know him
[1:49:45] so this message came to bring us to know
[1:49:48] him asked about Anthony R sing that song
[1:49:52] come to Jesus come to Jesus and live not
[1:49:56] come to me must come to Jesus the
[1:49:58] Prophet came to reveal I'm full a
[1:50:00] revelation and full of light of Jesus
[1:50:02] Christ come to Jesus and live we don't
[1:50:05] hear about Jesus with the argument and
[1:50:07] doctrine and teachers but where is Jesus
[1:50:09] because Jesus live a certain way a
[1:50:11] certain way with a certain way behave a
[1:50:13] certain way forgive a certain way
[1:50:15] restore said knowing deliver a certain
[1:50:17] way that is Jesus and he Jesus is the
[1:50:21] same yesterday today and forever

[1:50:40] distillery flavor distilleries Torah
[1:50:42] please still away later he's still a
[1:50:44] conqueror he's still over comma so then
[1:50:51] when they come to doctrine when you move
[1:50:54] on to perfection those little things
[1:50:56] become much use we go into relationship
[1:50:58] and we find out the only way that we can
[1:51:01] be perfected is to be in Christ and we
[1:51:07] find out in by the teachings of the
[1:51:09] Bible and how we get into Christ not by
[1:51:12] water baptism not by laying on hands not
[1:51:15] by teaching
[1:51:19] yeah people being taught and taught
[1:51:22] until the big thought right of the
[1:51:23] Spirit not by playing tips you get them
[1:51:27] to Christ you still hear any word to
[1:51:29] give your feet to get into Christ Fiat
[1:51:31] coming here in the world you could hear
[1:51:33] tips hello you hear fall off and you
[1:51:35] could speak back only tips literally
[1:51:37] it's giving your feet to get into Christ
[1:51:39] the object is to get into Christ the
[1:51:42] object is the captain for the Holy Ghost
[1:51:43] the object is that get into the token
[1:51:46] real is again we find on him by the
[1:51:51] teachings of the Bible and how he gets
[1:51:53] into Christ not by water baptism not by
[1:51:56] little hands not by teaching but by one
[1:52:00] spirit we all baptized into one body and
[1:52:03] become perfected she is suffering that's
[1:52:08] a big one no there's a there's a next
[1:52:10] door let's go inside idea perfect head
[1:52:14] through his sufferings he was wounded
[1:52:17] for our transgressions he was bruised or
[1:52:19] does you only really like it come out
[1:52:24] God he was stripped he was beaten he was
[1:52:27] bleeding but I the only way the reefs
[1:52:30] could come out he was caught ship
[1:52:32] diamond that the light could reflect
[1:52:34] seven colors or chlorine a coterie team
[1:52:37] you and I hallelujah to break seven
[1:52:39] seals seven stages of redemption or
[1:52:42] glory to God holiday spirit follows the
[1:52:46] blood all the way from the book of
[1:52:48] redemption oh my
[1:52:50] it's Munna to change he said I scripture
[1:52:54] relation to nine I know thy works at I
[1:52:56] tribulation and poverty but thou art
[1:52:58] rich I know the blasphemy of them which
[1:53:01] say they are Jews and are not but are
[1:53:03] the synagogue of Satan the key to this
[1:53:06] age is most evidently tribulation if
[1:53:09] there was revelation and the first age
[1:53:11] has not predicted an intensified
[1:53:13] tribulation surely second age there is
[1:53:16] no doubt here we go that what the
[1:53:18] following words of Paul applied to the
[1:53:21] mass of Christians wherever they were in
[1:53:24] the world
[1:53:25] and in every age now the Lord Almighty
[1:53:30] say I know there is walking in the mists
[1:53:35] of his people
[1:53:36] there is the chief Shepherd of the flock
[1:53:38] does he hold back the persecution does
[1:53:42] he stem the tribulation no he does not
[1:53:45] he simply says I know your tribulation I
[1:53:49] am not at all unmindful of your
[1:53:53] suffering what a stumbling block this is
[1:53:55] to so many people occasionally one that
[1:53:58] if God really loves them how can God be
[1:54:00] just and loving if he stands by and
[1:54:02] watching his people suffer that is what
[1:54:05] they ask in Malachi 1 1 2 3 the burden
[1:54:08] of the world would have the law to
[1:54:09] Israel by Malachi I have loved you saith
[1:54:12] the Lord
[1:54:12] yet we see where it has thousands of
[1:54:14] this was not Esau Jacob's brother see it
[1:54:16] the Lord yet I love Jacob and he said he
[1:54:18] saw and laid his mountains and his
[1:54:19] heritage we's fat dragon you see here we
[1:54:22] go they could not figure out God's love
[1:54:25] they thought that love meant no
[1:54:29] suffering they thought that love meant a
[1:54:33] baby with parental care but God said his
[1:54:37] love was elective love the proof of his
[1:54:41] love is election that no matter what
[1:54:44] happened his love was proven truly by
[1:54:47] the fact that they were chosen on the
[1:54:49] salvation because God had chosen the
[1:54:51] salvation through sanctification of the
[1:54:53] Spirit and belief of the truth he may
[1:54:56] commit you to death as he did poor he
[1:54:59] may commit you to suffering as the job
[1:55:01] that is his prerogative here his
[1:55:03] prerogative he is sovereign but it is
[1:55:06] all with the purpose if he did not have
[1:55:10] a purpose then he would not he would be
[1:55:12] the author of frustration and not peace
[1:55:15] his purpose is here we go that after we
[1:55:18] have suffered a where we would be made
[1:55:21] perfect be established and wrinkled and
[1:55:25] settled so after all this all this drama
[1:55:29] OVA or the church had to be stronger not
[1:55:33] meat
[1:55:33] not more backsliders my people giving up
[1:55:36] but that should be established not to be
[1:55:39] perfect but to be established like all
[1:55:43] glory their gods open to this morning
[1:55:45] all glory hallelujah hallelujah but what
[1:55:51] I said to him then he would be the
[1:55:53] author of frustration on a piece his
[1:55:55] purpose is that after we have suffered a
[1:55:58] while we would be made perfect be
[1:56:00] established Trenton and settled as job
[1:56:02] said he put strengthen us you see he
[1:56:06] Christ Himself suffered and he learned
[1:56:10] obedience by the things that he suffered
[1:56:15] and he was actually made perfect by the
[1:56:19] things that he suffered now I know this
[1:56:23] is not the kind of girls or people like
[1:56:24] the water had a blessing and they want
[1:56:27] to hear riches from the wicked and keep
[1:56:29] it to the poor and like listen I'm
[1:56:31] serious and calm I bless you and
[1:56:33] multiply you and after you
[1:56:34] but you see power after do the character
[1:56:37] and character have to do it suffering
[1:56:43] not mysteries I am Empress already and I
[1:56:50] hear not that at all the most no Calvary
[1:56:54] no and I swore until I look for assuming
[1:56:56] you know when they see at a day with me
[1:56:58] here at this and that and that and that
[1:57:00] and that it may be ceases
[1:57:05] you know the challenge of people is the
[1:57:09] process Gordon in Genesis say he said my
[1:57:14] people shall soon a strange land I would
[1:57:17] a mighty and I'll bring them out he kept
[1:57:19] the end game but he didn't identify the
[1:57:21] process he said the serpent ruinous he
[1:57:24] pushed his head with his heel and he
[1:57:27] didn't say I'll identify the process
[1:57:29] through Abraham actually generation of
[1:57:32] Jesus Christ God God God
[1:57:34] there's always a process you want to get
[1:57:39] seven subjects you wanna pass an exam
[1:57:41] there's a process you know walking
[1:57:43] school on ball - I claim it in Jesus
[1:57:45] name
[1:57:47] you better study in Jesus name - I'm
[1:57:49] doing homework in Jesus name and boil
[1:57:51] your lessons in Jesus name and then he
[1:57:53] will pass in Jesus name Oh glory to God
[1:57:56] is the process see one young woman she
[1:58:02] she's Mick McCready corner us and she
[1:58:05] tells me she a boy when she gets she
[1:58:07] come on with it unless young man say vkd
[1:58:10] gate here on spring break by the beach
[1:58:13] with a bunch of them and game afterward
[1:58:14] he repented because his foolishness you
[1:58:18] not seeing the news you're not listening
[1:58:20] people are dying
[1:58:21] you're not understanding what it's a
[1:58:23] plane your idiot
[1:58:28] but people miss very descriptive for you
[1:58:34] for merchants after nine and the fifth
[1:58:37] angel sounded I saw a star from heaven
[1:58:40] for South fall from heaven unto the
[1:58:43] earth and to him was given the key to
[1:58:45] the bottomless pit and he opened the
[1:58:48] bottomless pit and there arose a smoke
[1:58:49] ordered a bit as the smoke of a great
[1:58:51] furnace and the Sun and the air were
[1:58:53] darkened by reason of the smoke of the
[1:58:56] pit and they came out of the smoke
[1:58:58] locusts upon it unto them was given
[1:59:02] power as the Scorpions of the earth have
[1:59:05] power it was commanded them that they
[1:59:08] should not hurt the grass of the earth
[1:59:10] neither any green tea so this is not
[1:59:12] natural Lucas they could not hurt the
[1:59:16] grass of the earth neither any green
[1:59:17] thing neither any tree but only those
[1:59:19] men which have not the seal of God in
[1:59:22] their foreheads and today I was given
[1:59:26] that they should not kill should not
[1:59:27] kill them but that they should be
[1:59:29] tormented five months have a time do you
[1:59:33] know five months and their torment was
[1:59:36] as the torment of a scorpion when it
[1:59:39] strike at a man thy spear you know that
[1:59:42] is pain torment for five months and in
[1:59:45] those days shall men seek death and
[1:59:47] shall not find it and shall desire to
[1:59:50] die and get some flee from them there's
[1:59:53] a piece of torture in pain and you can
[1:59:56] die you're in pain and you're waiting
[1:59:58] your wish to die to get all that pain or
[2:00:01] glory of God on the shapes of the
[2:00:03] locusts were like horses prepare for
[2:00:05] battle or the heads were crowns like
[2:00:07] gold their faces were like faces of men
[2:00:10] and they had here a woman the teeth was
[2:00:12] a teeth of a lion they had breastplates
[2:00:14] as were the brass bit of iron the sum of
[2:00:17] the wings was the song of shouts of many
[2:00:20] horses running the battle and in their
[2:00:22] tears like unto scorpions there were
[2:00:23] stings in their tails and their powers
[2:00:25] to hurt men five months and the other
[2:00:30] king over them which is the angel of
[2:00:33] bottomless pit so when people talk about
[2:00:36] angel dies why we has acts we want to
[2:00:39] know where he injured come from people
[2:00:43] talking about they have in Zelda meet
[2:00:44] angel stop the engine because this angel
[2:00:47] come from a bottomless pit whose name in
[2:00:49] the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon but in the
[2:00:52] Greek tongue had a name apollyon one
[2:00:55] always fast and behold become pure
[2:00:57] hafter and a sixth angel song that I
[2:01:00] heard a voice from the four horns of the
[2:01:02] golden altar which is before God saying
[2:01:04] to the sixth angel which had the trumpet
[2:01:05] loose the four angels which are pong in
[2:01:08] the great river Euphrates and the four
[2:01:10] angels were loosed which were prepared
[2:01:12] for an hour and a day and a month and a
[2:01:15] year for to slay the third part of men
[2:01:18] so boy this is only the beginning
[2:01:22] hallelujah and the number of the army
[2:01:25] horsemen were two hundred thousand
[2:01:27] thousand and I heard a number in there I
[2:01:30] saw the horses in the vision and them
[2:01:32] that sat on them having breastplates of
[2:01:35] fire of jacent and brimstone and the
[2:01:37] heads of the horses was has a lion order
[2:01:39] their mouths issued fire and smoke and
[2:01:41] brimstone and by pees tree was I was by
[2:01:44] these three was the third part of men
[2:01:46] killed by the fire by the smoke by the
[2:01:49] brimstone which issued on the mount for
[2:01:52] their power is in the amount and in
[2:01:53] their tails for their tails were like
[2:01:55] unto serpents and their heads and which
[2:01:58] to hate but this is the Parowan I get to
[2:02:01] depart and the rest of the men which
[2:02:05] were not killed by these plagues yet
[2:02:09] repented not of their works of the hands
[2:02:14] that's what we deliver it now men see in
[2:02:17] it seeing the destruction scene and the
[2:02:20] still would repent the rest of the men
[2:02:27] which were not killed by these plagues
[2:02:29] yet repented not of the works of the
[2:02:30] hands that the shipment worship devils
[2:02:32] and idols of gold and silver and brass
[2:02:36] and stone and wood neither which neither
[2:02:39] can see nor hear near the repented they
[2:02:41] of their murders nor their sorceries nor
[2:02:43] the fornications know of their tests
[2:02:47] just as them demons can change the bride
[2:02:50] of who she is
[2:02:50] the bride can change them their people
[2:02:54] you can change that is how they are oh
[2:02:58] my oh
[2:03:00] so Jesus he learned obedience by the
[2:03:03] things which he suffered he was actually
[2:03:05] made perfect by the things that he
[2:03:07] suffered and Hebrews 5:8 9 says though
[2:03:09] he were a son yet learned he obedience
[2:03:11] by the things which he suffered and
[2:03:14] peered made perfect he became the author
[2:03:16] of eternal salvation under all that will
[2:03:18] be him in plain language the very
[2:03:21] character of Jesus was perfected by
[2:03:25] suffering and according to Paul he has
[2:03:30] left his church a measure of suffering
[2:03:33] that day - by their faith in God while
[2:03:37] suffering for him would come to a place
[2:03:40] of perfection question why would he want
[2:03:43] this James 1:2 the for my brethren
[2:03:47] compt it all joy you see everything is
[2:03:50] back to the world back to the scriptures
[2:03:52] Compton all joy when you fall into
[2:03:54] divers temptations knowing this that a
[2:03:56] China of your faith look at patients but
[2:03:58] that patients have a perfect work that
[2:04:00] you may be perfect and entire wanted
[2:04:02] nothing why does he stand by the reason
[2:04:05] is Roman 1718 it Shirin then heirs heirs
[2:04:08] of God and joint Israel Christ if so we
[2:04:11] suffer with him that we may be glorified
[2:04:13] together if I reckon of the sufferings
[2:04:16] of this present time are not worthy to
[2:04:18] be compared with the glory which I be
[2:04:21] revealed in us unless we suffer with him
[2:04:24] we cannot reign
[2:04:25] you have to suffer terrain terrain is
[2:04:29] the rule the conquer to overcome Taupo
[2:04:31] don't worry adoption no glory to God
[2:04:34] sons of God been restored into a
[2:04:36] position of power to reign with him to
[2:04:38] rule with him you have to suffer with
[2:04:40] him do you believe that the reason for
[2:04:42] this is there's a reason for that
[2:04:44] but you always suffer to suffer Oh God
[2:04:47] God God want you to suffer bad no it's
[2:04:49] not that the reason for this is correct
[2:04:54] simply is never made without suffering
[2:05:01] that's why parents sometimes buy the
[2:05:04] best for their children by this pious do
[2:05:07] this and it's here and still do the one
[2:05:09] thing and misbehave and be if terrible
[2:05:11] because we believe that if we help them
[2:05:14] and bless them and what are you gonna
[2:05:15] work out we don't want them good and
[2:05:17] good to pain you don't want them go to
[2:05:19] issues and challenges and you see
[2:05:21] because you suffer in your life
[2:05:22] you're given them a break and what it
[2:05:23] doesn't work
[2:05:26] notice Gordon give none a son don't
[2:05:28] break him every son that commits record
[2:05:34] straight
[2:05:35] because if God don't do that you have a
[2:05:38] bunch of spoiled children yet discipline
[2:05:40] or discipline Joshua dissipated Moses
[2:05:43] everybody come under the rod of God
[2:05:46] hallelujah so what the reason for this
[2:05:50] is that character simply is never made
[2:05:54] without suffering practice of victory
[2:05:57] not a gift
[2:05:58] a man without character can reign
[2:06:00] because power
[2:06:01] apart from character is satanic but
[2:06:04] power wit character is fit to rule let's
[2:06:08] get them think it not strange that the
[2:06:10] fiery trials are to try you that's what
[2:06:12] Peter said it is a stranger is it is it
[2:06:15] strange that God wants to develop a
[2:06:16] christ-like character that comes true
[2:06:19] suffering does it have so many people
[2:06:22] like to argue on the beat because
[2:06:24] there's no life there so the strength is
[2:06:26] what they know and the knowledge that
[2:06:29] they have but what God warns is a
[2:06:31] character life watch and God warns us
[2:06:35] develop a christ-like character that
[2:06:37] come to suffering but and we all have
[2:06:39] trials we all try to chase the sons but
[2:06:42] not not one goes through the church that
[2:06:45] is not suffering and is not being tried
[2:06:47] isn't of God the church that is not
[2:06:52] suffering and is not being tried isn't
[2:06:54] of God for Hebrews 12:6 for whom the
[2:06:57] Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth
[2:07:01] every son whom he receiveth
[2:07:03] and if you read or chastisement then
[2:07:05] your bastard sons
[2:07:06] oh my now you see why I read in Smyrna
[2:07:10] and tribulation here's why here's why I
[2:07:12] read that this special condition in
[2:07:15] Smyrna
[2:07:17] must be applied to every age there is no
[2:07:22] it's free from it there is no true
[2:07:24] believer free from it this is of God
[2:07:27] this is the will of God and it is
[2:07:30] needful we need the Lord to teach us the
[2:07:34] truth that we have to suffer and be
[2:07:37] christ-like and doing it not fight like
[2:07:41] not Not Bombs I like we had to fight
[2:07:44] back on the other make exclusive not
[2:07:46] defending like Christ like above it love
[2:07:51] suffer it long and this kind o charity
[2:07:59] suffereth long and is kind
[2:08:02] not in cus nothing carrying on
[2:08:05] hallelujah scripture Matthew 5 blessed
[2:08:09] are ye when men revile you and persecute
[2:08:11] you and say all manner of evil against
[2:08:13] you falsely for my sake rejoice and be
[2:08:15] exceeding glad for great is a reward in
[2:08:17] heaven for so persecuted the prophets
[2:08:19] which were before you the cloudy skies
[2:08:23] and storms of life are no signs of God
[2:08:25] is approval neither are the bright skies
[2:08:28] and still water signs of his love and
[2:08:30] approval his approval of any of us is
[2:08:33] only in the beloved his love is elective
[2:08:37] which he has for us before the
[2:08:39] foundation of the world
[2:08:40] does he love us yes how shall we know we
[2:08:42] shall know because he said so and
[2:08:44] manifested that he did love us for a
[2:08:46] process to himself give us of his spirit
[2:08:48] placed on us as sons and now how shall I
[2:08:52] prove my love they evolved oh how you
[2:08:54] prove yes how I prove it now by
[2:08:56] believing what he said and by conducting
[2:08:59] myself with joy and mr. Giles that he in
[2:09:02] his wisdom allows to come to pass

[2:09:12] does not say here as he did to the
[2:09:14] church you hold my feet he is not
[2:09:16] talking about his feet now he is
[2:09:18] commending them for their faithfulness
[2:09:20] as he goes he also mentioned their
[2:09:22] patience now faithfulness and patience

[2:09:26] is the outcome of faithfulness it
[2:09:28] seasons in James one tree the Train of

[2:16:59] revealed then he goes he touches his
[2:17:01] mystery he calls for to the people after
[2:17:04] the mission been given to him he costs
[2:17:06] what to the people what does it do he
[2:17:07] proclaims a message what is that a war a
[2:17:10] spiritual war then God takes his
[2:17:12] messenger with the elect of that age
[2:17:14] lays him to sleep he drops a plague upon
[2:17:17] them who rejected it temporary judgment

[2:20:46] about not a bunch of churches and books
[2:20:49] and tapes and plea and clean and plain
[2:20:50] it's not that you know it slop lightly
[2:20:52] talking this message of the compare
[2:20:54] manifestation I don't understand why
[2:20:56] people think we go sit down I'll be
[2:20:57] hearing services and service and preach
[2:20:59] a sermon it's not that you know this is
[2:21:00] our time and a season when you open the
[2:21:03] seven sea was silence only half an hour
[2:21:05] but sometime that after will be up the
[2:21:08] silence will be broken or glory to God
[2:21:11] course and a prophet to do a job that
[2:21:13] turn the hassle akhirin back to the
[2:21:16] theater the father's not back to
[2:21:18] doctrine inverted
[2:21:19] this an explanation the faith of the
[2:21:21] fathers
[2:21:24] no the spirit is the total you shall be
[2:21:28] filled with the Holy Ghost not made
[2:21:29] these hints when the blood was shed that
[2:21:31] put more scent non under there Pentecost
[2:21:34] aha
[2:21:35] so he died at Christ finish blood fell
[2:21:39] from him wounded from his dining rooms
[2:21:42] the blood released the spirit and that
[2:21:45] finish the devil right there
[2:21:47] Oh glory to God if Jesus didn't die if
[2:21:50] the blood wasn't broken
[2:21:52] this spirit couldn't be released but the
[2:21:53] fact that he died
[2:21:55] dr. Calvary and released the spirit the
[2:21:57] spirit itself was hunting every
[2:21:59] pretended seed see that demon that virus
[2:22:03] multiplying and I mean Velen one cell
[2:22:05] multiplying and adding an Excel multi
[2:22:07] plan and an Excel and this Holy Ghost
[2:22:09] this Holy Ghost breathe upon them and
[2:22:11] said receive the Holy Ghost this Holy
[2:22:14] Ghost fell on hundred-twenty then fell
[2:22:15] on 3000 then fell on 5,000 Oh glory of
[2:22:19] God and God after the church and this
[2:22:21] Holy Ghost multiplying the devil can you
[2:22:23] stop this Holy Ghost it's the Holy Ghost
[2:22:25] on fire it's the Holy Ghost and power oh
[2:22:27] the business all want it but I wanted to
[2:22:31] have it in the revival oh because a Holy
[2:22:38] Ghost is for an individual the body but
[2:22:41] no other person in the church it is
[2:22:44] poured out on individuals isn't that
[2:22:48] right
[2:22:48] and that was the team of every apostle
[2:22:51] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[2:22:52] you believe oh my I know that executive
[2:22:56] Baptist doctrine you believe it you have
[2:22:58] it oh my same Baptist doctrine
[2:23:01] same Baptist doctrine is hardly receiver
[2:23:03] since we believe there is something to
[2:23:06] receive
[2:23:07] Oh glory to God and when they were
[2:23:09] spoken through in acts 19 what glory
[2:23:12] know God is there is the keel and the
[2:23:14] hallelujah is the inoculation for for
[2:23:17] for covet 19 ask 19 is the cure for that
[2:23:20] have you received the Holy Ghost she
[2:23:22] should leave
[2:23:23] Oh glory to God hallelujah they say they
[2:23:26] aim here but the Holy Ghost
[2:23:27] Oh glory to God but there was the Holy
[2:23:29] Ghost the Holy Ghost was released

[2:24:52] when I see the blood that's the token
[2:24:54] and the chemistry was only a signal or a
[2:24:57] sign of sanctification but the life
[2:24:59] itself is the token for without the
[2:25:02] circumcision with all the token you're
[2:25:04] not even a covenant so it casts mi
[2:25:05] circumcised men could see I'm a Jew I'm

[2:25:27] preparation for it for the promised land
