[42:26] heard had heard these things he was
[42:28] troubled and all Jerusalem with him and
[42:32] when he had gathered all the chief
[42:34] priests and scribes of the people
[42:36] together he demanded of them where
[42:38] Christ should be born and they said unto
[42:40] him in Bethlehem of Judea for thus it is
[42:43] written by the prophet and thou
[42:45] Bethlehem in the land of Judah art not
[42:48] the least among the princes of Judah for
[42:51] out of thee shall come a governor that
[42:54] shall rule My People Israel Isel and
[42:57] then Herod when he had priv called the
[43:00] wise men inquired of them diligently
[43:03] what time did the star appear he sent
[43:07] them to Bethlehem and said go and search
[43:09] diligently for the young child and when
[43:11] ye have found him bring me word again
[43:14] that I may come and worship him also and
[43:18] he uh verse 9 says when they had heard
[43:21] the king they departed and lo the star
[43:24] which they saw in the east went before
[43:27] them until it came and stood over where
[43:30] the young child was amen so the
[43:33] supernatural star LED them right to the
[43:35] child uh and it says now when they saw
[43:38] the star they rejoiced with exceeding
[43:40] great joy and when they were come into
[43:44] the house they saw the young child with
[43:47] Mary his mother and fell down and
[43:50] worshiped him and they had open their
[43:53] Treasures they presented unto him gifts
[43:56] gold and frankincense and uh and and myr
[44:00] and being warned of God in a dream that
[44:02] they should not returned to Herod they
[44:05] departed into their own country another
[44:08] way may God have blessing to the reading
[44:10] of his word let's just pray one more
[44:12] time Heavenly Father Lord we've read

[44:53] amen and amen okay you may be seated
[44:55] praise God
[45:05] amen praise God so God bless you tonight
[45:08] certainly privileged to be here in his
[45:10] presence amen amen glory so I have a
[45:13] title tonight amen so without further
[45:15] delay um praise God every gift will find
[45:20] its place that's my title tonight amen
[45:23] and my inspiration is that Ministry when
[45:25] positionally place will identify Jesus
[45:28] Christ amen that's my uh inspiration
[45:31] amen praise God and uh of course well
[45:34] you know I was studying the scriptures
[45:38] and uh I think it was not last Wednesday
[45:39] but Wednesday before
[45:41] last um something just came to me um
[45:45] that every gift would find his place
[45:47] right and so I went back into the
[45:49] message that brother Bram preached on
[45:52] that God's Gift always finds their
[45:54] places and I went back into it and then
[45:57] God started to show me some things in
[45:58] there um about the 5o ministry praise
[46:02] God and stuff like that so that's that's
[46:04] what I have tonight amen praise God
[46:06] that's what that's what that's what came
[46:08] to me amen so so in studying this book
[46:14] out here these three wise men come from
[46:16] the East isn't that right three wise men
[46:20] and the prophet said on that same
[46:21] message he said it took wise men to pick
[46:24] up what God was doing to pick up what
[46:26] was taking place because there was a
[46:28] great prophecy laying in the in in the
[46:31] Zodiac which was God's first Bible and
[46:33] these men were astrologers and so they
[46:36] were studying this this zodiac until all
[46:38] of a sudden they picked up a sign in the
[46:40] stars that something was supposed to
[46:42] happen something was supposed to take
[46:44] place isn't that right and so they began
[46:47] to pack with them their revelation of
[46:50] what they saw this sign to be amen isn't
[46:53] that right Hallelujah and I don't know
[46:55] if they all started off together the
[46:57] Bible doesn't quite describe it but when
[46:58] they met up they all had gifts praise
[47:01] God they didn't come empty-handed
[47:04] Hallelujah but when they saw the sign
[47:06] they brought their Revelation praise God
[47:08] they brought their gifts with them oh
[47:10] Hallelujah and tonight we see a sign we
[47:14] see something happening in the word
[47:16] praise God it causes us to come out from
[47:18] where we are we step out from where we
[47:20] are we leave our country we left our
[47:23] churches we left where our communities
[47:25] we left our family to follow after this
[47:28] sign that we see happening in the world
[47:31] today oh Hallelujah isn't that right
[47:34] praise God when God shows you something
[47:37] you cannot stay where you are when God
[47:40] reveals himself to you you cannot remain
[47:42] where you are you have to come out oh
[47:45] Hallelujah God spoke to Abraham and he
[47:47] said walk before me and be therefore
[47:50] perfect oh Hallelujah you can't stay
[47:52] where you are if you want Perfection
[47:55] come on now you can't stay where you are
[47:57] if you want the Holy Ghost you can't
[47:59] stay where you are if you want to be
[48:01] healed if you want to be delivered but
[48:03] come come to the Fountain come to the
[48:06] waters Come to the River there is a
[48:09] River of Life tonight which you can't
[48:11] stay where you are if you want healing
[48:13] from that River you can't stay where you
[48:15] are if you want strength from that River
[48:18] there is a fountain filled with blood
[48:21] that's drawn from Emmanuel's veins and
[48:24] sinners plunged beneath that flood lose
[48:27] all their guilty stains oh how many want
[48:30] to plunge in tonight how many want to
[48:33] dive in tonight oh somebody say amen
[48:37] hallelujah somebody say praise the Lord
[48:40] oh hallelujah
[48:41] hallelujah amen amen hallelujah so the
[48:45] prophet said it took wise men praise God
[48:48] hallelujah amen there's something about
[48:50] these men they had the ability to see
[48:52] and understand things that normal people
[48:55] couldn't really see that's the ability
[48:57] to see and interpret things that normal
[49:00] people couldn't interpret oh understand
[49:02] it's a sign now all these things are
[49:05] symbols these Tre Magi isn't that right
[49:08] one come from Arabia one from Persia
[49:10] from different places in the world they
[49:12] were not Jews they didn't grow up in the
[49:14] temple they didn't know about the
[49:16] scriptures concerning Isaiah they didn't
[49:18] know about that all they saw was a sign
[49:21] and that was enough for them all they
[49:23] saw was a sign in the sky that was
[49:27] declaring something they had been alive
[49:29] for many years but they never seen
[49:31] anything like this this drew them out
[49:35] from their country out from their
[49:37] priesthood out from their comfort zone
[49:41] something about this sign drew them out
[49:43] from where they were drew them to a new
[49:46] place drew them out to a new country
[49:49] drew them out to a new people oh
[49:52] hallelujah hallelujah they had the
[49:54] correct interpret
[49:56] ation and it was proven because when
[49:59] they went in Jerusalem they said where
[50:00] is the king of the Jews because that's
[50:03] what the sign told us oh Hallelujah
[50:06] isn't that right and our sign tells us
[50:08] that our Revival is coming our sign
[50:10] tells us that a Holy Ghost is coming a
[50:13] sign told us oh Malachi 4:5 and 6 God
[50:17] sent a sign behold I sent unto you
[50:21] Elijah the prophet oh Hallelujah he sent
[50:25] to you you the individual God loved you
[50:29] so much that he raised up a prophet and
[50:32] sent him to you oh Hallelujah to turn
[50:35] your hearts back to the faith of the
[50:38] fathers oh Hallelujah and it is these
[50:41] Divine mystery truths that literally
[50:44] turn our hearts back to the faith of the
[50:47] fathers back to the faith that has laid
[50:49] down on the day of Pentecost when men
[50:52] were born again by the spirit of the
[50:55] living God when this pyramid was born in
[50:58] the hearts of men by the Holy Ghost and
[51:01] Fire God come in there and he'll do it
[51:04] one more time he's going to do it
[51:07] tonight do you believe it same and
[51:10] somebody woo sh hallelujah oh I feel
[51:14] inspired tonight Glory Glory
[51:18] Hallelujah oh Hallelujah so it's not so
[51:21] much about the sign and the Magi you can
[51:24] trace the Magi back somewhat in
[51:26] scripture amen isn't that right and it's
[51:28] connected to Magic and that whole root
[51:31] word and astrology and Zar asianism and
[51:33] stuff like that but it's a it's a symbol
[51:36] God was using you see so it's symbols
[51:40] isn't that right and you have to be able
[51:43] to see what God is pointing you to is a
[51:46] truth isn't that right that God is
[51:48] pointing you to now God's Gift all find
[51:50] always finds their places here's a
[51:53] prophet here now on uh 76 he said now
[51:56] look uh what how beautiful those gifts
[52:00] see they pack gifts with them is that
[52:02] right he said those gifts fit into Jesus
[52:04] Christ see gold speaks of his deity he
[52:08] said now there wasn't heathens they were
[52:11] inspired by God can we say Amen y we're
[52:15] not heathens tonight we're inspired by
[52:17] God hallelujah is not they wasn't
[52:20] imagining something he said that proves
[52:23] it right there oh even the mega
[52:26] they that they did see the supernatural
[52:28] because their own gift that they offered
[52:31] identified and spoke well of their
[52:34] testimony that they did see the
[52:36] supernatural light why because it speaks
[52:40] perfectly he said they brought gold
[52:43] which means deity they brought
[52:46] frankincense which means service and
[52:49] they brought mer for his death and when
[52:52] he was a baby showing that deity would
[52:54] be put to death in In the Flesh amen he
[52:57] says isn't that right that it might
[52:58] redeem Fallen man he said now how can
[53:01] people turn that down he said when you
[53:03] realize what are we doing out here
[53:05] Prophet said where did we come from
[53:08] where did we come from tonight he said
[53:10] what's our business being here he said

[53:55] said behold I sent my angel before thee
[53:58] to keep you in the way L you dash your
[54:01] foot against a stone that angel is on
[54:04] the earth that angel come on now has

[55:39] said we're on the back on the basis of
[55:42] free moral agency where we can serve it
[55:45] or reject it just like Adam did in the
[55:48] beginning he said but we find out fur
[55:50] down he said we find out that they
