[41:49] I'm the girl ready isn't that right
[41:52] when the Son of man cometh shall define
[41:55] feet on the earth I would men come and
[41:58] corrupt the prophecy of the fulfillment
[42:00] of what Malachi walk him to do because
[42:02] William Brennan didn't come to send
[42:04] books and tapes sorry that was not the
[42:06] commission that I read in Malachi 4 no
[42:09] no Elijah was sent to turn our hearts
[42:11] back to the faith of the fathers Elijah
[42:13] wasn't sent to distribute books and
[42:15] tapes and possibly plain books on tapes
[42:17] no Elijah was sent to do a specific work
[42:20] to turn our hearts back to the fate of
[42:22] the fathers when that is done then we
[42:25] can say this is that that the Prophet
[42:28] William Branham speaker not all these
[42:30] churches not all these things know this
[42:32] is that when what we don't know this is
[42:34] that when our hearts I literally back to
[42:38] the faith of the fathers which is a

[50:11] what Laurie he another weekend fate
[50:14] considers only buddy-buddy now dead when
[50:17] he was a hundred years old who has been
[50:21] trained as Bonnie was a hundred years
[50:25] old neither did the deadness of Sarah's
[50:27] room this is a Padawan I get to these
[50:29] tags at not talk here it is that he did
[50:33] not stagger knows how much rather than
[50:35] that he's done not he staggered not at
[50:40] the promise of God
[50:42] oh yes he staggered at his body these
[50:45] tiger British Crooked Stick
[50:46] he started hold on to the staff he was
[50:48] rocking in his body but not that promise
[50:51] because quite another man I would like
[50:54] old Laurie does God get us but he's got
[50:58] another the promise of got you on
[50:59] believe but was strong in currency in
[51:05] faith and the evidence of that is given
[51:08] complaining moping of a sad-sack face
[51:13] have a lying smile have a lemon smile no
[51:17] no no no he was given praise given glory
[51:20] it show on his face
[51:22] it shows in attitude he was given praise
[51:25] he was given glory because he was he was
[51:29] he was fully persuaded that what was
[51:32] promised
[51:32] he has able to perform and I don't ever
[51:35] cook student up a hill and hold on I am
[51:39] persuaded that the dynamics that the
[51:43] promise of God is just that's real I am
[51:47] persuaded that there gonna be a super
[51:49] church a super ass as we narrow that
[51:53] slope I am persuaded that we are greater
[51:56] at the revival I swear
[51:59] there be another book of Acts the axis
[52:02] theorem at sixteen I am persuaded
[52:08] what he has promised he is able to
[52:11] perform let me see that
[52:13] praise God almost done but a bantam says
[52:16] you know what I think I grid the grid
[52:18] and he to the churches today would be
[52:20] what I think that Lacan is no salt
[52:23] revealed the people are not broke up
[52:25] enough there's no burden seemingly and
[52:28] you give me someone listen that's so
[52:30] tore up about lost souls that they cry
[52:33] and I wanted or even so bad there they
[52:35] could hardly eat this they can't if you
[52:38] read in history of the world
[52:39] I religious history you'll find out it
[52:41] always taking that kind of a spirit to
[52:44] bring a revival when Zion travailed or
[52:48] travel is a bad word why she put four
[52:51] children you have to be poor it's the
[52:54] atmosphere of anything you get along
[52:57] away there's arguments and you get a
[52:59] type of atmosphere if there's something
[53:01] in the church somebody disobedient I'm
[53:03] very ugly acting in the church and
[53:06] causing trouble you will never have a
[53:09] revival as long as that kind of
[53:10] atmosphere is wrong you have to have
[53:13] everybody if you notice when the
[53:14] horse-breaking my Pentecost they will
[53:16] want place in one Accord waiting for the
[53:18] promise and if we all get like that
[53:21] the revival will be here that's right
[53:24] last coat my heart so hungers to see the
[53:28] atmosphere the atmosphere is what brings
[53:30] it the atmosphere if every person here
[53:33] we're getting one perfect harmony it
[53:35] will be settled you see like the natural
[53:38] way of an egg hatches on the head and it
[53:40] will hatch because it's the atmosphere
[53:42] it's warm and you put a blanket to keep
[53:45] it warm it my hot anyhow put it in an
[53:47] incubator

[1:03:06] all that Jesus began both to do and
[1:03:09] teach until the day in which he was
[1:03:12] taken up after that he through the Holy
[1:03:15] Ghost had given Commandments unto the
[1:03:17] Apostles whom he had chosen and whom
[1:03:21] also he showed himself alive after his
[1:03:25] passion by many infallible proofs being
[1:03:28] seen of them forty days and speaking of
[1:03:31] the things pertaining to the kingdom of
[1:03:33] God and being assembled together with
[1:03:37] them commanded them that they should not
[1:03:38] depart from Jerusalem in other words
[1:03:41] don't leave this place but wait for the
[1:03:44] promise of the Father which saith he ye
[1:03:47] have heard of me for John truly baptized
[1:03:51] with water but ye shall be baptized with
[1:03:53] the Holy Ghost not many days hence when
[1:03:57] they therefore will come together they
[1:03:59] ask of him saying Lord will thou at this
[1:04:01] time restore again the kingdom to Israel
[1:04:04] and he said unto them it is not for you
[1:04:07] to know the times or the seasons which
[1:04:10] the father had put in his own power but
[1:04:13] he shall receive power after that the
[1:04:15] Holy Ghost is come upon him and he shall
[1:04:18] be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem
[1:04:21] and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto
[1:04:25] the uttermost part of the earth amen and

[1:04:31] 2nd Peter chapter 1 amen and verse 16
[1:04:52] second Peter 1 this chapter one and
[1:04:54] verse 16 says for we have not followed
[1:04:57] cunningly devised fables when we made
[1:05:00] known unto you the power and coming of
[1:05:03] our Lord Jesus Christ but will I witness
[1:05:05] is of His Majesty for he received from
[1:05:08] God the Father honor and glory when
[1:05:11] there came such a voice from to him from
[1:05:15] the excellent glory this is my beloved
[1:05:17] Son in whom I am well pleased and this
[1:05:21] voice which came from heaven we heard
[1:05:23] when we were with him in the holy mount
[1:05:26] and we have also a more sure word of
[1:05:29] prophecy whereunto you do well that you
[1:05:32] take heed as unto a light that shine it
[1:05:34] in a dark place until the day dawn and
[1:05:37] the day star arise in your hearts
[1:05:39] knowing this first that no prophecy of
[1:05:42] the scripture is of any private
[1:05:44] interpretation for the prophecy came not
[1:05:48] in old time by the will of man but holy
[1:05:52] men of God spake as they were moved by
[1:05:55] the Holy Ghost
[1:05:57] may God a blessing to ring of his word

[1:08:34] I wanted to read a many man before I got
[1:08:37] into priests gone and it's from
[1:08:39] earnestly contend for the faith that was
[1:08:42] once delivered to the Saints
[1:08:43] Amen isn't that right and that's what
[1:08:46] we're here to do this morning earnestly
[1:08:48] contend for the faith
[1:08:49] praise God deep faith is not books on
[1:08:52] tapes
[1:08:52] here's what it is he is he saying he
[1:08:54] said now he's addressing the church
[1:08:56] telling them just to those that are
[1:08:58] sanctified in God preserved in Christ
[1:09:01] and call and now he said now you're the
[1:09:04] people that I'm talking to that you will
[1:09:06] earnestly contend for the faith that was
[1:09:09] once delivered to the Saints
[1:09:11] he said now not he said the
[1:09:13] faith that was once delivered he said
[1:09:15] did you notice there the faith that was
[1:09:17] once delivered to the fifth to the
[1:09:19] Saints he said some people say well
[1:09:21] that's against my faith he said but
[1:09:23] there's only one fate he said there's
[1:09:26] only one Lord he said there's only one
[1:09:28] God and as one baptism there's one way
[1:09:32] to enter into it or not by your works
[1:09:36] not by your match but by his spirit Oh
[1:09:39] hallelujah hallelujah is not by your
[1:09:42] thought this morning it's not by your
[1:09:44] intellect that's not how you enter in it
[1:09:46] but there's one way to enter in to this
[1:09:49] holy ghost land that we're talking about
[1:09:51] this morning
[1:09:52] oh I by one spirit ties into coming down
[1:10:05] to our time where God is going to
[1:10:07] approve what is right and what is wrong
[1:10:10] men seeing a lot of things
[1:10:13] preachers seeing a lot of things
[1:10:15] churches came and a lot of things but
[1:10:18] it's gonna come up even time where God
[1:10:20] is gonna prove his old word he said my
[1:10:24] word shall return unto me void but it
[1:10:28] shall accomplish the purpose that I set
[1:10:31] foot poor accomplish an accomplished
[1:10:35] ossification if wisly accomplished
[1:10:37] sonification I love the Pentecostals or
[1:10:40] complicit clips and the spirits what are
[1:10:42] we talkin flesh on this last age pride
[1:10:46] come on now come on now we are all
[1:10:49] higher the smaller we are call by a
[1:10:52] higher court
[1:10:54] a call to perfection Oh Oh hallelujah
[1:11:00] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory
[1:11:03] to God
[1:11:04] so there's coming a proven time when
[1:11:07] God's gonna prove his own world but what
[1:11:09] I'm gonna read something here real quick
[1:11:10] and we're going to it he said well
[1:11:13] that's against my faith is only one Lord
[1:11:15] one faith see one doctrine a man and a
[1:11:19] spirit will confirm and make it alive
[1:11:22] with signs following
[1:11:24] please go on a man Allah is nine here's
[1:11:28] what he says he he says now people say
[1:11:31] well I have a faith I go to my own
[1:11:34] church he said that's not what you
[1:11:36] speaking to here he's talking to the
[1:11:39] people that's to contend for the faith
[1:11:43] so it's a thing he's trying to point to
[1:11:46] here now not general faith he said but
[1:11:48] but that was once delivered to the
[1:11:49] Saints see he said now he said now the
[1:11:52] only thing that we're going to ever know
[1:11:55] what's what if he could only find out
[1:11:58] what the faith is so he said if we find
[1:12:01] out what the faith is then we can
[1:12:03] earnestly contend for that faith is that
[1:12:06] ranch he said what the faith he said now
[1:12:09] the faith that was once delivered to the
[1:12:11] Saints
[1:12:12] now we'll go back here where they were
[1:12:14] first call sings and we'll find out what
[1:12:17] kind of faith they had then we'll know
[1:12:21] more or less what they want to contend
[1:12:24] for he said now when the church we call
[1:12:26] was was called Saints they were
[1:12:28] sanctified and would sanctify or sing
[1:12:31] come from sanctifying meaning they were
[1:12:34] clean meaning they were pure meaning
[1:12:38] they were ruling meaning they were
[1:12:40] unadulterated it's not that's why the
[1:12:43] Bible says present your bodies a living
[1:12:45] sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God
[1:12:49] which is your reasonable service that is
[1:12:53] the atmosphere they came in they were
[1:12:55] lean in the presence holla stayin in the
[1:12:58] spirit holstein air
[1:13:01] until caught do something staying in the
[1:13:03] right atmosphere staying in the right
[1:13:06] condition because as long as you're in
[1:13:08] the right condition can meet the need
[1:13:11] quarter to exactly what he said he would
[1:13:14] to once the conditions are met that's
[1:13:24] why if you take an egg and you put it on
[1:13:26] the hot dog
[1:13:27] it will hatch because the atmosphere is
[1:13:30] right the warmth is just what it needs
[1:13:35] hallelujah to bring into that group
[1:13:37] stage is now right to pip out and what
[1:13:40] you need today is to be in that
[1:13:41] atmosphere but to unplug yourself from
[1:13:44] the world unplug yourself from the
[1:13:46] internet and TV and the distractions and
[1:13:50] to begin to get into God's Word and
[1:13:52] because I lined up with what he said
[1:13:54] line it with what he spoke line up with
[1:13:57] what he promised line up with course
[1:13:59] requirements hallelujah hallelujah
[1:14:02] hallelujah then we'll see a mighty move
[1:14:05] of God isn't that right
[1:14:07] okay so he says here now he says what he
[1:14:11] had that day all right he says they were
[1:14:13] they were they were holy that's what was
[1:14:15] right amen
[1:14:16] and so forth he said now if that was the
[1:14:19] beginning of the church when it was
[1:14:21] inaugurated
[1:14:22] that was the beginning of the church
[1:14:24] when it was a lawyer eaten at the day of
[1:14:26] Pentecost he said now let's look at what
[1:14:29] they had back there
[1:14:30] what church contended for what they had
[1:14:33] lost now just 2 D 3 years after the
[1:14:36] beginning of the church now you know
[1:14:38] true wouldn't be take talking about back
[1:14:40] in the Old Testament on the Levitical
[1:14:42] laws because he said ok I'll skip down
[1:14:44] he said now notice what kind of faith
[1:14:47] that he had they had a faith in a
[1:14:50] resurrected living Christ not a people
[1:14:54] God not of people testimony but it was a
[1:14:58] resurrected living crimes
[1:15:00] in other words it wasn't just talking
[1:15:02] about it but they could not prove it on
[1:15:04] the spot Peter wasn't just talking about
[1:15:07] the gospel but we do
[1:15:09] to go down to the key court beautiful
[1:15:12] and brought on a spot he had live in
[1:15:15] evidence living proof and there was a
[1:15:18] court among them and that's what we want
[1:15:21] in this church that's what we want in
[1:15:24] Trinidad a living moving monument of God
[1:15:28] on the earth
[1:15:30] Oh hallelujah hallelujah of God stepping
[1:15:34] out from the pages of the Bible

[1:22:08] was the overview even but praise God
[1:22:11] now we'll see Amanda what they were they
[1:22:16] had a feet and a resurrected live in
[1:22:18] Christ
[1:22:19] someone who rose from the dead and was
[1:22:23] living among them so don't only did he
[1:22:26] raise but the Lord Himself appeared
[1:22:29] everywhere with them confirming the wood
[1:22:32] tiles in one of the miracles in other
[1:22:35] words and those things you can see cold
[1:22:37] over here cold over there cold over
[1:22:40] there look quadric Philip look what it
[1:22:43] pizza
[1:22:43] look what it Andrew and it ended up
[1:22:46] simultaneously God healing the sick here
[1:22:49] reason at that there his body spreading
[1:22:51] out across the barrier on across Judea
[1:22:54] and across the uttermost part of the
[1:22:56] earth just like he said it was it was on
[1:23:00] display it was on the hallelujah and
[1:23:07] that's what we're gonna have again he
[1:23:10] said just as same as he was before he
[1:23:12] ever did died he was living among me
[1:23:14] he's not right he said now see there
[1:23:18] wasn't contended for some historical of
[1:23:20] him but they were contending for a
[1:23:24] living Christ a resurrected one who was
[1:23:29] in limits and now any rose on the dead
[1:23:31] he did the same things after he rose
[1:23:34] from the dead through the apostles he
[1:23:38] was a present tense he was proven that
[1:23:40] he died that he did before he died even
[1:23:44] greater and more of it now he said let a
[1:23:46] little while he said in the world see at
[1:23:48] me no more but he shall see me the
[1:23:50] church to believe it's not it's for you
[1:23:53] it's not for the world the world the
[1:23:56] same Christ are open the eyes of what
[1:23:58] blinded the eyes of another well in the
[1:24:01] world and see him anymore
[1:24:02] but you're gonna see him you're gonna
[1:24:04] have proof you're gonna have evidence of
[1:24:07] this court in your life not by word only
[1:24:09] but by power demonstration because path
[1:24:12] with the gospel is even greater okay
[1:24:18] probably with even in you even to the
[1:24:21] end of the world that's what the
[1:24:22] Apostles believed and he believed that
[1:24:24] what he was in the flesh he was also and
[1:24:28] more in the spirit and that's what they
[1:24:32] thought tooked and that's what he
[1:24:34] believed and that's what they practiced
[1:24:36] and that is what God confirmed amen amen
[1:24:40] okay I'll stop there now Rhema praise
[1:24:41] God he loved him amen so now let's get
[1:24:46] on here now so now I want to talk about
[1:24:49] how God proves himself is now not a
[1:24:53] world proof if you look up the meaning
[1:24:55] of the world it means to show it means
[1:24:58] to be true to be truthful about what was
[1:25:02] spoken about what was said hizzoner
[1:25:05] it means to demonstrate to demonstrate
[1:25:09] the truth of that's what we're talking
[1:25:11] about this morning it means to show
[1:25:13] beyond all doubt with me some manifests
[1:25:17] to produce proof or to produce evidence
[1:25:20] that's why you read that scripture after
[1:25:22] he retired and rose from the dead he
[1:25:25] appeared to them and showed himself
[1:25:27] alive by many infallible proofs and
[1:25:31] fallible means it's unmistakable it's
[1:25:34] undeniably caught you cannot receive you
[1:25:38] cannot refuse what is being manifested
[1:25:41] in front of you it has to be caught it
[1:25:44] can't be nothing else it's not in your
[1:25:46] mind it's what he is doing right now
[1:25:50] we need quad right now hallelujah is
[1:25:55] there a politician
[1:25:56] we can't get walls by a painted fire
[1:25:59] that's an old fire that's a light of a
[1:26:01] pastor but what we need to do is a
[1:26:04] present inspire I live in reality
[1:26:08] I live in manifestation of the sons of
[1:26:11] God or I'll upon sons fill sons step out
[1:26:15] of the Seventh Seal O'Reilly and claim
[1:26:18] the inheritance claim their birth rights
[1:26:21] claim their families that's who you are
[1:26:23] this morning you are not trust anybody
[1:26:26] but you are royal priesthood you are
[1:26:29] holy nation
[1:26:30] you are peculiar people you couldn't
[1:26:32] hear this voice unless God put that in
[1:26:35] the air and sorry your soul is small
[1:26:37] that's what you do it sitting on their
[1:26:40] pews this morning this is not my chance
[1:26:43] this is not by accident but Paul is
[1:26:45] calling up people God has chosen of
[1:26:48] people out of every nation out of every
[1:26:51] child for his namesake
[1:26:54] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:26:56] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:26:59] what Paul chose not what he felt like
[1:27:03] chosen not what he felt like choosing
[1:27:05] but what God chose from before the
[1:27:08] beginning which means it's not about
[1:27:10] your feelings it's not about what your
[1:27:12] circumstance it's not about what's going
[1:27:14] on in your mind
[1:27:15] but it's what God choose from before the
[1:27:18] beginning before there was a mood before
[1:27:21] there was a stop he had something to
[1:27:23] prove
[1:27:24] Oh hallelujah are we gonna get into
[1:27:30] proof evidence the world of proof means
[1:27:34] witness to so that's what we're gonna do
[1:27:37] when the Spirit comes now you're gonna
[1:27:40] be a witness of his resurrection a
[1:27:43] witness that God is alive a witness no
[1:27:46] more talk but evidence here it is here's
[1:27:50] my spirit flowing freely in their eye to
[1:27:53] give substance to to determine to
[1:27:57] substantiate to corroborate to verify
[1:28:00] all these things it's not ready
[1:28:02] it's what proof means to confirm a
[1:28:04] matter Holy Ghost confirming the word
[1:28:06] with signs wonders Americans know when
[1:28:09] Cortot as his voice know when God speaks
[1:28:12] he possesses the ability to prove what
[1:28:16] she said is not man could talk but it
[1:28:21] might be able to prove it not just a
[1:28:23] bluff so that never could say a pound
[1:28:25] but he can't prove when a wall is going
[1:28:27] to be bound there's no proof of that
[1:28:29] so he's just a bluff but God could
[1:28:31] please bi-election that's your present
[1:28:34] circumstance it's not always going to
[1:28:37] remain forever he has proof of that
[1:28:39] because when he calls in a pack pot
[1:28:41] there's something back there for you
[1:28:43] there's something back there for your
[1:28:44] family you can pull out evidence
[1:28:47] look what happened for you I've slipped
[1:28:50] my wedding band of grace up on your
[1:28:52] finger and I'm coming back for you that
[1:28:55] is proof Oh hallelujah praise calling
[1:29:00] Mary man and the devil crown and say you
[1:29:03] did this and you detach and you lied and
[1:29:06] you cheated and in fornication and you
[1:29:09] came in marriage or whatever it was and
[1:29:11] you did this and you did that you could
[1:29:13] look at the face of the devil and say
[1:29:15] there's no proof of that
[1:29:16] because when he goes back into the
[1:29:18] evidence tapes he sees that there's
[1:29:20] blood for you and he said where is the
[1:29:24] tape God said I'll find it
[1:29:27] I've done lost it in a sea of
[1:29:29] forgetfulness
[1:29:30] you have no proof of what you're saying
[1:29:32] but I have proof that I love them couple
[1:29:35] nail prints I in my hands I see he has
[1:29:48] the ability to prove his own word God
[1:29:50] can prove his own word and if you made a
[1:29:53] promise you can keep this promise all
[1:29:55] right any a promise can remain it will
[1:29:58] remain empty until it is proven in all
[1:30:02] right hallelujah so God is guilty until
[1:30:07] he brings his promise to pass hallelujah
[1:30:09] hallelujah spoke it
[1:30:10] it's that circling but it's written for
[1:30:13] prophecy right man I'll put a prophet to
[1:30:16] turn to the prophecy of it was it's
[1:30:18] really for the word to turn into spirits
[1:30:20] because before it was word it was spirit
[1:30:23] and the spirit after the word isn't all
[1:30:26] right the eternal word from his mouth
[1:30:28] and that would circle circle we tend to
[1:30:31] manifest itself in its time and its
[1:30:34] season and it goes back to spirit I can
[1:30:38] it's not much
[1:30:40] so think of it the word is only there
[1:30:43] for a time space it's only there to
[1:30:46] represent a time period the Word of God
[1:30:48] took lineage 400 years
[1:30:51] applicants are conceived of virgins have
[1:30:54] conceived not remain would for years and
[1:30:57] years all right man is not this one come
[1:31:00] and talk about it this one come on shake
[1:31:02] on a Sunday but it still remain word
[1:31:05] until somebody come along somebody come
[1:31:08] along as the prophecy of that would pick
[1:31:12] up what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah
[1:31:15] and Here Come Mary she was just an
[1:31:17] ordinary woman she didn't feel special
[1:31:20] she didn't know she was special but in a
[1:31:22] bad part of my
[1:31:24] she was very special indeed she was the
[1:31:26] incubator that God has predestinated Oh
[1:31:30] hallelujah to conceive and be Jesus all
[1:31:34] the Christ and here she was hallelujah
[1:31:37] hallelujah
[1:31:38] she was just dry word Oh everybody had
[1:31:40] come the angel Saint Hail Mary
[1:31:43] our highly favored you are gonna
[1:31:45] conceive something's gonna come over you
[1:31:48] it won't be by your match it won't be by
[1:31:50] your power but it be by the spirit it
[1:31:53] won't be by your thoughts don't put any
[1:31:56] interpretation to what I'm about to say
[1:31:58] I'm Mary sepia tone unto me according to
[1:32:02] thy word and that was it
[1:32:10] and she received it right there
[1:32:13] something that happened suddenly began
[1:32:16] to move and this morning I don't care
[1:32:19] how you feel it's not about feelings but
[1:32:22] if we could receive the word this
[1:32:23] morning with open face with no veils or
[1:32:27] we're hot but believe what he said will
[1:32:30] come to pass I believe caught this
[1:32:33] morning but his word to you that he is
[1:32:36] not a man that he will live but he is
[1:32:40] the same yesterday he's the same today
[1:32:42] and he is the same for
[1:32:47] Oh hallelujah
[1:32:51] I believe it this morning him and me man
[1:32:55] whoa hallelujah so it's just word until
[1:32:58] it comes to life now we know that this
[1:33:05] gospel it's not a word only but it's
[1:33:09] empowering and demonstration of the Holy
[1:33:11] Spirit hallelujah in other words we
[1:33:14] gotta prove God right here on this earth
[1:33:17] before we leave for the resurrection not
[1:33:21] after before we've got to give the devil
[1:33:23] one more kick one more round
[1:33:26] he's got the seat card on this play
[1:33:28] caught through the Prophet said I'll
[1:33:31] ride this trail one more time those
[1:33:35] words will not fall to the ground that
[1:33:38] same angel who was with the early church
[1:33:41] it's gonna come back again and right
[1:33:43] this trail one more time and this
[1:33:46] morning God it's piling up people and
[1:33:50] it's ready to receive His Word he's
[1:33:52] calling it from the north calling it
[1:33:54] from the South calling it from these
[1:33:56] calling them from no ass gettin em ready
[1:33:58] for a channeler resurrection Oh will be
[1:34:04] one more my hallelujah
[1:34:11] [Music]
[1:34:12] please call hallelujah so now watch
[1:34:17] in the beginning God proved this word
[1:34:19] see in him wants to be the father is not
[1:34:22] in it must be a savior it wants to be a
[1:34:26] deliverer it wants to be the captain of
[1:34:28] our salvation
[1:34:29] isn't that right hallelujah now the only
[1:34:32] thing is that those were just tributes
[1:34:35] those were attributes of what he wanted
[1:34:38] to be but it couldn't be it because
[1:34:42] there was nobody else to sing there was
[1:34:45] nobody to redeem there was nobody to
[1:34:47] show himself alive to in that way in
[1:34:49] that sense there was nobody to know him
[1:34:51] as Savior there was nobody to know him
[1:34:54] as Redeemer is now
[1:34:57] hallelujah so think of it in
[1:35:00] unity God is gone it's not an eternity
[1:35:04] he's all-powerful in eternity he's all
[1:35:08] by himself in eternity he could do
[1:35:10] anything in eternity in heaven he
[1:35:13] created angels a man is not to worship
[1:35:17] Him he was called up there but he wanted
[1:35:20] to be caught
[1:35:21] not only up there but he wanted to be
[1:35:23] gone down here also so in order to be
[1:35:26] caught he had to be worshipped and there
[1:35:29] had to be somebody to worship Him to
[1:35:31] prove that he was caught follow me this
[1:35:34] morning he had angels up there but it
[1:35:37] was nobody down here he created he
[1:35:39] created a moon he created a son he
[1:35:41] created a sauce he created nature he
[1:35:44] created everything but he came to the
[1:35:46] spot where he said I got to create man
[1:35:49] he said let us create man in our image
[1:35:52] and in our likeness so that I could not
[1:35:54] only be god of the heavens but I could
[1:35:57] be called of the earth also so he
[1:35:59] created man in his own image man in his
[1:36:02] own likeness
[1:36:03] man it is two million and said let that
[1:36:05] man have dominion
[1:36:07] let that man worship me so I could
[1:36:09] become part up there and I could also
[1:36:11] become part down here because in order
[1:36:18] to be God he has to be worshipped
[1:36:20] therefore he must have subjects in his
[1:36:22] kingdom to worship Him in spirit to
[1:36:26] worship Him in truth
[1:36:27] [Applause]
[1:36:29] hallelujah so he had an image of himself
[1:36:35] reflecting himself back worshiping God a
[1:36:39] perfect relationship he created man in
[1:36:41] His image holily is not but still God
[1:36:45] wasn't a Savior yet he was still gone
[1:36:49] the Lord God the God of the earth the
[1:36:52] god over man the córdova eater it's not
[1:36:55] right isn't that right he was still
[1:36:56] caught but he wasn't a savior because he
[1:36:59] had not yet expressed that attribute of
[1:37:01] being able to save he wanted to prove
[1:37:05] that
[1:37:05] could save but there was nobody to save
[1:37:08] are you following up he can't prove it
[1:37:11] unless there's a situation that presents
[1:37:14] itself where he could prove what he said
[1:37:17] to be the truth is now there had to be a
[1:37:21] situation to present itself where he
[1:37:25] could become whatever you had lead off
[1:37:27] so there had to be a need in order for
[1:37:30] him to present himself as indeed G get
[1:37:33] it now
[1:37:34] so when man fell to sex is now right and
[1:37:37] to even a whole fall and everything else
[1:37:39] now God could present himself now what
[1:37:43] has an opportunity to speak to man on a
[1:37:46] level and he wasn't able to to before
[1:37:49] the fall
[1:37:50] Oh hallelujah before everything was nice
[1:37:52] everything was wonderful
[1:37:54] but now the comp man is punished from
[1:37:56] the Garden of Eden court now has an
[1:37:58] opportunity to prove himself to be the
[1:38:02] car that he said he is to be the God of
[1:38:04] love to be the God of mercy to be the
[1:38:08] God of kindness to be the core of
[1:38:10] hallelujah the God of simplicity Oh
[1:38:12] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:38:14] hallelujah
[1:38:16] [Applause]
[1:38:20] so if we never was lost we would never
[1:38:23] know God in that way if we never had a
[1:38:26] struggle if we never had a trial if we
[1:38:29] never had a circumstance if we never had
[1:38:32] a situation think about it we would
[1:38:34] never know card in that relationship in
[1:38:36] that Tunis hallelujah of him being a
[1:38:39] father to us of him being a provider for
[1:38:42] us of him being a way maker for us
[1:38:45] Oh hallelujah but he wanted to prove
[1:38:47] himself God had a desire to prove who he
[1:38:52] was he wanted to be your strength he
[1:38:55] wanted to be your joy he wanted to be
[1:38:57] your song Oh hallelujah but you have to
[1:39:00] lose it
[1:39:01] you have to lose a comfort you have to
[1:39:03] lose all the joy you have to lose all of
[1:39:06] the other forget what it was like to be
[1:39:08] up there that's why we bypass our
[1:39:10] theophany and we trucked out from
[1:39:12] thought into flesh that's why we drop
[1:39:15] down here to be tested that's why we
[1:39:17] drop down here to be tried to be proven
[1:39:19] so that court could prove his word to us
[1:39:22] in our generation in our season in our
[1:39:26] time
[1:39:27] [Applause]
[1:39:29] it's not that's why I love the Bible the
[1:39:33] Bible can be said to be many things a
[1:39:36] book of history but what I love about
[1:39:38] the Bible is that the Bible also a true
[1:39:40] account of real human beings who were
[1:39:44] just like you and I who met caught in
[1:39:47] their time and in their season a man a
[1:39:50] man a pyro gets a true account of all
[1:39:53] these men who walk before God who God
[1:39:56] showed himself to who brought open
[1:39:58] himself to who God revealed himself to
[1:40:02] who God made himself real to Oh
[1:40:05] hallelujah
[1:40:07] Oh God showed himself alive all right
[1:40:11] I think about Gideon Gideon was a little
[1:40:15] fella
[1:40:16] smallest in his house it's not right of
[1:40:19] the smallest trial smallest family
[1:40:21] everything small shoe size small
[1:40:25] size small everything smaller there's
[1:40:28] nothing about him that you would think
[1:40:29] that he's a great man but all of sudden
[1:40:32] Israel found herself in a condition and
[1:40:34] he did evil in the sight of God is now
[1:40:36] right
[1:40:36] hallelujah and they were under
[1:40:38] oppression they were on a persecution
[1:40:40] it's not hallelujah here was Gideon for
[1:40:44] himself in a condition he was on the
[1:40:46] winepress Brian and wheat hide in a team
[1:40:49] and is now from the Midianites hiding it
[1:40:51] from evil from from a my phony enemy
[1:40:54] it's nice praise God here is he's there
[1:40:56] doing his thing hiding doing his singing
[1:41:00] secret praying and secrets looking in
[1:41:03] secret he loved the Lord but he don't
[1:41:05] know what to do because they're under
[1:41:07] pressure they under frustration or on
[1:41:10] that situation they are not bondage is
[1:41:13] not right and it seem like there's no
[1:41:15] way out then all of a sudden from an
[1:41:18] angel and said Gideon mighty man of
[1:41:21] Valor
[1:41:22] [Applause]

[1:43:50] sheep taking care of his hood isn't
[1:43:52] doing what he had to do obeying the
[1:43:55] commandments staying in the spirit seen
[1:43:58] in the atmosphere
[1:43:59] all of a sudden a situation presented

[1:44:43] of you and none of them could stand but
[1:44:46] here in a pack side of the desert while
[1:44:48] that was going on
[1:44:50] God had a man ready a man who was
[1:44:53] training
[1:44:54] a man who unbeknownst to him was being
[1:44:57] prepared for the biggest fight of his
[1:44:59] life

[1:45:20] called on his brothers to refresh them
[1:45:23] to give them a little food in new season
[1:45:25] to give them a little encouragement they
[1:45:27] gave him a few reasons by the way until
[1:45:30] all of a sudden he heard a word from
[1:45:32] this man Paul the liar who claimed
[1:45:35] himself to be a part among men who said
[1:45:38] send me a man to fight me no I like
[1:45:41] Illini his own interpretation poor lad
[1:45:44] had his own thing going on he had his
[1:45:46] own move he had his own gospel and he
[1:45:49] had pawned the people crippled the
[1:45:51] people in their intellects crippled the
[1:45:53] people in their mind telling them they
[1:45:55] couldn't make it but you couldn't cross
[1:45:57] this line and when David saw him he said
[1:46:00] who is this uncircumcised philistine the
[1:46:05] Amish of the Living God who is who is
[1:46:10] talking I kind of talk

[1:46:15] God is able personally know that our God
[1:46:17] is strong Oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:46:22] hallelujah and his brothers decide to
[1:46:25] run him you know how brothers are he's
[1:46:28] heading north eNOS of your heart go back

[1:46:33] sudden they began to talk David say that
[1:46:36] man have no right to talk to only at
[1:46:38] that way you know who your body's if you
[1:46:42] don't know and let me tell you I'm a car
[1:46:46] side of the desert and I was there alone
[1:46:50] with my sling and I met a pair one time
[1:46:53] and I couldn't stand before the forces
[1:46:58] on my car and I sue him praise
[1:47:01] hallelujah and a lion came before me and
[1:47:04] he wanted to take my sheep and I slew
[1:47:07] him Oh hallelujah hallelujah and he said
[1:47:12] Oh God that eleven the bear into my
[1:47:14] hands that same God who delivered the
[1:47:17] lion into my hands he is more than able
[1:47:19] to deliver this single ayah and he is
[1:47:24] the same cop this morning oh yeah
[1:47:29] hallelujah he's the same God this
[1:47:31] morning he's the same God Israel might
[1:47:35] have believed the core of yesterday they
[1:47:37] might have believed in a go through
[1:47:38] tomorrow but it didn't know a present
[1:47:40] tense god but that was the difference is
[1:47:43] David David knew our cause was not only
[1:47:46] yesterday but he was a saint today he is
[1:47:49] the same right now hallelujah hallelujah
[1:47:54] hallelujah hallelujah is now and the
[1:48:00] Bible says faith is the substance of
[1:48:02] what you're hoping for feeds itself is
[1:48:05] the evidence of what you can't see
[1:48:07] so if you need evidence this morning
[1:48:10] just have to have H and what God's Word
[1:48:13] says
[1:48:14] concerning you this morning
[1:48:17] me in other words if you want to break

[2:00:08] voice of God because it's the
[2:00:10] manifestation of the prophets word this
[2:00:14] is God's prophet and a true voice of God
[2:00:17] only brings back that real living
[2:00:22] supernatural God with the supernatural
[2:00:25] world
[2:00:26] with the supernatural manifestation of

[2:00:59] promise he said at Sarah represented a
[2:01:02] tassel or the pollen that comes into the
[2:01:05] tassel he said but Mary the Virgin
[2:01:08] represented and produced the true
[2:01:11] spiritual seed to bring forth the real
[2:01:14] true stalk back again it's not right
[2:01:16] Hagar and Sarah both was my sex but Mary

[2:01:58] God is of no private interpretation God
[2:02:02] don't need any of our schools to
[2:02:05] interpret his word when he vindicates it
