has never lost a battle yet he has never lost a victory yet oh blessed be the name of the lord amen i am totally dependent upon him thank you musicians he appreciated anthony with the worship service so if you have your bibles would you turn with me to three portions of scripture i have quite a bit of reading but i do want to get it all in so that we can deal with the subject at hand i want to start in the new testament then we'll go to the old testament so we're going to read from hebrews chapter 12 and we're also going to be reading from first kings 17 and 18. hebrews 12 and verse 25 see that he refused not him that speaketh for if they escape not to refuse him that speak on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven whose voice then shook the earth but now he had promised saying yet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more signified the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain wherefore we're receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our god is a consuming fire and reading from first kings 17 and reading verse 1 first kings 17 and reading verse 1 and elijah the tishbite who was of the inhabitants of gilead said unto ahab as the lord god of israel live it before whom i stand there shall not be due nor rain these years but according to my word and reading first kings 18 and reading verse 1. i'm gonna read a bit here i might stop and then have us finish it but let's start and it came to pass after many days that the word of the lord came to elijah in the third year saying go show thyself unto ahab and i will send rain upon the earth and elijah went to show himself unto ahab and there was a sore famine in samaria and ahab called obadiah which was the governor of his house now obadiah feared the lord greatly for it was so when jezebel cut off the prophets of the lord that obadiah took 100 and hid them by 50 in a cave and fed them with bread and water and ahab said unto obadiah go into the land unto all foundings of water and unto all brooks per adventist we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive that we lose not all the beasts so they divided the land between them to pass throughout it ahab went one way by himself and obadiah went another way by himself and obadiah was in the way behold elijah met him and he knew him and fell on his face and said add thou that my lord elijah and he answered him i am go tell thy lord behold elijah is here what a way to introduce yourself tell your boss that elijah is here and he said what have i sinned this is over there speaking that darwin has delivered thy servant into the hand of ahab to slay me as the lord thy god live it there is no nation or kingdom whether my lord had not sent to seek thee and when they said he is not there he took an oath of the kingdom and nation that they found did not and now thou sayest go tell thy lord behold elijah is here and it shall come to pass as soon as i am gone from thee that the spirit of the lord shall carry me with her i know not and so when i come and tell ahab that he cannot find thee he will slay me but i serve and fight i save and fear the lord from my youth was it not told my lord what i did when jezebel slew the prophets of the lord how i hid a hundred men of the lord's prophet by 50 in a cave and fed them with bread and water and now thou say yes go tell thy lord behold elijah is here that he may slay me and elijah said as the lord of hosts liveth before whom i stand i will surely show myself unto him today so obadiah went to meet ahab and told him and ahab went to meet elijah and it came to pass when abraham saw elijah and a that ahab said unto him ado he that trouble it israel and he answered i have not troubled israel but dao and thy father's house in that he have forsaken the commandments of the lord and thou hast followed belham now therefore send and gather to me all israel unto mount carmel and the prophets of baal 450 and the prophets of the groves 400 would eat at jezebel's table so he have sent unto all the children of israel and guarded the prophets together unto mount camel and elijah came unto all the people and said how long hold he between two opinions if the lord be god follow him but if baal then follow him and the people answered him not a word may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated amen so i have a title this morning and my title is the final showdown and i have a subject placed by fire into the kingdom that cannot be moved and an inspiration let the god that answer by fire let that god be god everybody feeling fine so today we're going to talk about the fire we're going to talk about the holy ghost we're going to talk about the time of the manifestation of the holy ghost and we're also going to talk about the final showdown because the fire is coming to claim individuals into the kingdom the claiming is not by the church the claiming is not by the group the claiming is not by the pastor the claiming is by fire because the fire of god will place you into a kingdom his kingdom a kingdom that cannot be moved a kingdom that cannot be destroyed a kingdom that always was that always is and always will be a kingdom with a king who is the i am that i am he is the king of kings and the lord of lords and today the holy ghost charity itself is here to place individuals into that kingdom the bible said and we read it everything that can be shaken will be shaken churches will sheikh ministers will shake church members will shake politicians will shake the government will shake the police force will shake the criminals will seek men's heart failing for fear but the false anointed they will shake also your family will shake but not you fear not little flock it is my father's pleasure good pleasure to give unto you something give unto you a kingdom an entire kingdom where he is king and you are priests and you are princes and you are sons of the king so we have a reason this morning to smile we have a reason this morning to be happy don't tell me that i should be sad i may not have money in my pocket right now but my father is the king he is the king of kings he is the lord of lords he is the majesty he is bigger than your problem he is bigger than your triumph he is bigger than your situation he called you for a purpose for such a time as this for a final showdown oh we have waited a long time for this but i hear the clock ticking coming to an end we about to break from time into eternity but before we leave this place up there's going to be one more rider there's going to be one more battle every day is a battle when you wake up in the morning it's a battle when you lift your hand it's a battle brother branham said whenever you lift your hands you are defying gravity it's a battle it's a showdown when you pray it's a battle when you worship it's a battle that's why the bible says bring the sacrifice of praise praise is a sacrifice because it's a sacrifice to worship when you don't feel like worshiping it's a sacrifice to lift your hands up when you feel there's no reason to do so but you bring a sacrifice of praise up into the house of the lord and you offer up incense to him because you acknowledge that we are creatures of eternity we are trapped in time but one of these days time will be no more time will finish can the church say but before we leave this place there's going to be another showdown god loves a showdown the devil made the mistake way back before the beginning way back there he got angels to worship him and there was war in heaven and there was a showdown in heaven it started there but we were represented here with michael so when michael drew his sword sons who rotated off of the presence of god who were gene attributes of god who had the dna from god they were compelled to draw their swords also if there was no question about it it was instinct for us because we are just like god we are just like our father so when michael drew his soul you drew your sword also the devil wants you to forget that you are a warrior he wants you to forget that you are a fighter he wants you to forget that you are a trained soldier this is not new to you this is not strange to you this is what you were doing where was tau when i lay the foundations of the and the morning stars sang together and the children of god shouted for joy this is what we were doing worship is not strange to us up giving god praise is not foreign to us this is what we do this is who we are we are born to worship we are born to give him praise we are born to kick the devil out of our homes out of our families out of our bodies of cancer has got to go diabetes has got to go sickness has got to go why because this is what we do we cast devils out we cast demons out in jesus name come the church amen hallelujah this is the last service for the year the last sunday service so i'm gonna give it all i got i'm gonna give it everything i got i want to let the devil know i don't care how january was how february was how much was how april was but this service is my service he may have had a voice all of this year but today it's my turn to say something the bride will have a voice up the pride will speak up and what we speak will come to pass so this morning we are prophesying the time is at hand since it's just a time this morning we are prophesying there will be a revival for the young people all you young people who are halfway in and halfway out we are speaking for you this morning god is gonna arrest you he's gonna arrest you he's gonna lock you up he's gonna put you in prison a person of love that you can't even get out if you want to yes if you are sick in here this morning we are speaking a word your healing is happening right now i'm not even waiting for 2017 your family they're already coming right now they don't even know it but they are being pulled just like lazarus lazarus come forth black slide up come forth sick person comfort you who are depressed come forth god is able [Applause] maybe she did you may be seated if you can i want you to understand the backdrop in first kings 17 elijah said not even dew or rain is going to come unless i called for it and elijah disappeared he went into safety he went into where god led him to be and king ahab looked to the east looked to the west looked to the north looked at the south he couldn't find him he searched he's trying to know who is called who is predestinated but he can't find you because you're under the blood elijah was covered he was protected he was in training he was in preparation but in 18 it switched ahab is going around his business and elijah is ready to display who he is he is ready to come out to hide him you can't hide for long this morning we coming out to hide him the devil beat you up and you went into hiding but not this morning we are getting the permission by the word to come out of hiding you may be seated [Applause] so elijah comes out of hiding because we spoke a couple weeks ago god has never changed his strategy so when god wants to do something he could use hiding he could use a manger he could use the burning bush he could use the walls of jericho he could do whatever you want but when it's time for you to come out it's time for you to come out so elijah taking a stroller he knows ahab is going to be out there he knows over tire is going to be out here he know they are looking for him he said go tell your master that elijah is here he pull out his business card yes this is that elijah that elijah has been searching for he don't need to send you a hunting party he don't need to look no more i've made myself available you may be seated over there saying no no no no no no when i go and tell ahab that you said that you are here but the moment i turn around you will disappear and go i don't know where and he will kill me amen elijah said not this time it's time for a showdown [Applause] the time for hiding is over the time for playing church is over the time for warming a church bench is over the time to say i'm in the message is over the time to be a rumor is over the time to be a name you hear from the distance is over this is going to be a showdown if god is god then serve him let the god and answer by fire let that that's the time we're talking about let the god and answer by fire you maybe see them not answer by convention not answer by the type of service not answered by what is spoken but led to god because the only vindication the only evidence of the showdown is when god himself answers and sends fire into your life that nobody can take away sends fire in your house that the devil can't fight that vindication is not from the minister's association that vindication is not from your family but it's god who sends the fire and this morning we say send the fire can the church say amen oh hallelujah hallelujah but the kangaroo i didn't even check what time i came into the pulpit is a powerful thing you know that's why i love how god operates with the clarions because sometimes you have to force force the issue to get us to move where he wants us to move the prophet relates a story one time i think he saw a turtle and he said take a stick and try to push it and it didn't move tried to throw something and it didn't move but when he lit a fire titans have to do no man told us how to move because fireless caused a response and some of you who don't want to lift your hands up we take sticks and try to push you we take stuff and try to throw it but when the fire comes you can't help yourself we say lord send the fire may he answer by fire this morning all these years in the message what you need is an answer of fire fire in your soul fire in your mind all the things you're struggling to do and you're trying to hold on and you're trying to make it by that fire drop down in there that lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh you trying to be somebody all of that disappears you're gonna fire our god the bible says it's a consuming fire he will destroy everything just let go this morning and let the fire of god take a whole of your life hallelujah a kingdom that cannot be moved a kingdom that cannot be moved cannot be shaken so many times in our lives we try to rely on these props i call it the props in our lives we rely on the prop of our job you know once you have your job you know you can make it rely on the prop of our savings we may lay on the prop of our family and god has a way of removing these props so that we could lie on him and rely on him because he's the only one that cannot be shaken he's the only one that cannot be moved man cannot produce that only god could produce that can the church say amen so the headstone is coming the stone of power is coming to break up every man-made system to break up every conception that you have and but over he was preaching on the inspiration and he was preaching from this quote last week he said i believe that the bride of christ is called i believe she is sealed in the kingdom of god i believe the mechanics is there they are waiting for the dynamic that will take her off the earth into glory in the rapture i believe it with all my heart yes sir he won't know how he's gonna do it but he shall we don't know how he's gonna do it but he shall do it he is the dynamics we just become members of the machine of his body forming ourselves into his image and see him uniting himself with us in his works with his love gifts as he hands them to us just before the wedding supper we are waiting we are watching for that can the church say amen and the dynamics of this church will be a revealing of the holy spirit that we have worked in a small measure while the headstone is coming down to unite with the body but when the head and body unites together the full power somebody say full power the full power of the holy ghost will raise her up chest exactly like that even the dead that's dead in christ for hundreds of years will rise in the beauty of his holiness and take a flight to disguise but the brown said the dynamics is the holy spirit so this final showdown that we are talking about it's not going to be your strength it's not going to be your might but it'll be the dynamics the holy ghost itself from taking control of the mechanics of the body itself and when the two come together and begin to move in harmony they have the devil for all these years every age every generation he felt he made it he beat up elijah he beat up joshua throughout it they dare they fall into the ground but in this time the power that's coming will raise and get out of the graves the power that's coming will cause a rapture to take place up the power that's coming will reach your family that can't understand what's going on but this power could not be stopped up i see a stone cut off without the hands of man and that stone of power is coming can the church say man [Music] may be seated in the very first recorded message that brother branham preached in on april 12 1947 listen to brother adam's words in the message faith is the substance so he said i wish to speak to you tonight just for a little bit of time and teach the word of faith that you might know how listen carefully how to approach god there's many of these great and deep subjects that people claim that they know much about and when it comes down to the final showdown they know very little of it now that's true we are going to find out in a few of these things tonight so billy branham saying there are many deep things that you could preach and you could investigate but when it really comes down to it it comes out to the final showdown and very few know about it so we are talking about showdowns this morning a showdown what is it it's a confrontation it's a fight it's a face-off it's a standoff life is a showdown the bible is a book of showdowns but i believe this morning the bride is getting ready for the final showdown we live in a modern age now but years ago in the days of the wild west there used to be showdowns we'll meet you at 12 noon and one man walk up the dusty road and come into a showdown and he stands up on this side and on the other side the other one walks and they would face off it's a showdown and the whole neighborhood is there the whole community and they say draw on whoever draws and shoots first wins the showdown what a way to go but life is about showdowns sometime ago but over preacher message you say you do what you have to do until you find out what you are called to do many of us we don't like showdown we don't like confrontation but also said your passion for victory must be stronger greater than your fear of defeat i'll say those two again you do what you have to do until you find out what you are called to do and your passion for victory must be stronger greater than your fear of defeat you said satan cannot get stronger but you can i love that one satan cannot get stronger but you can so in this battle this showdown that we are talking about it's time that you lift your head up but brother isaac i don't have the best prayer life that has nothing to do with it right now the showdown is coming and you are being called out this morning you're being called out to make an appearance you're being called out to represent the fate that was once delivered to the scenes you're being called out to be identified you could hide no longer in the shadows every individual in the bride is being called out to be identified oh those dark ages when the christians were burnt at the stake and fed the lions it was easy to make your identification known those days were easier you know it might sound rough to go to the lion's den and stuff you know but it's either you were lion food or not lion food it's either you were a real christian or not a christian there were many people i'm sure say you know what i'm good enough i'm good i'll pray in secret you have no identification but in this age it's easy for people to stay hiding like adam did hiding in eden hiding here hiding there hiding in the church hiding in the crowd but we're talking about a showdown where you could be identified by the token itself but the branham said the token must be displayed that the people around you can see it so if you're trying to hide in the church or hiding a message the clock is ticking down let this service put a line in the sand with you hiding who you are hiding where you come from hiding your testimony hiding who you are in god can the church say man the more i study the words the more i realize that god loves showdown some of us we don't like conflict we don't like confrontation we don't like to face of anybody but god is different he delights in the opportunities to prove himself can the church seem when you read genesis there was darkness but there was a showdown and god said let there be light and light and darkness fought and light worn from all back there it's been a showdown can the church say amen when moses went down to egypt and he began to speak he said i'm going to show you a sign and they dropped the road and and the devil responded janice and jambis throw their rats down what was that it was a showdown if moses didn't hear from god he would have said listen i'm going i'll come back the next time when i come back with something different but no it was a showdown it's a battle you think the devil's going to make it easy for you no he's going to fight for every inch of ground but god has never changed his strategy you are going to overcome you are going to make it you are going to have a testimony oh blessed people name of the lord if you have ever seen a boxing match you maybe see that there's a certain energy but the brandon was an amateur boxer can the church say man but the brandon was an amateur boxer there's a certain atmosphere when you're in a boxing match on one side it's one person about to fight and usually on the other side is some kind of champion somebody who's being challenged in other words a showdown has a challenger and the person being challenged and in a boxing match is the defending champion or the person who thinks they are winning or whatever it is and then there's a person coming against it so right now this morning it's what you have been fighting all these years your cancer your tumor your disease your mind battles your fears and all these years it's day in your life but this morning you are getting an encouragement to come to the showdown because when the brandon said you have to say pull back listen god is not coming to just take care of your battle when you're a soldier you know he's coming to give you strength to fight your battle but abram said it like this he said you have to do something but some of it happened that's why if you shall say to this mountain be moved you can't sit there and start waiting on god to come and do something no you gotta say something you gotta speak to your mountain you gotta speak to your house you gotta speak to your family and then watch god come to back it up oh you don't hear me this morning stop being lazy stop sitting back saying i'm waiting for god to deal with it what are you doing speak to the mountain why crime moses speak and move forward you have been given a commission you have been called as a soldier in such a time as this can the church say man oh my my i feel religious this morning on the left corner is the devil and he's jumping up and down he's been winning all kind of battles for all these years he thinks he could win this one there were showdowns and battles and but one time somebody came into the ring who was a little different he wasn't popular he didn't look handsome he didn't speak nice but when he came to the ring the devil thought this was just gonna be like every other battle when the devil fought moses he warned him he got moses to not make it to the promised land he got abraham to lie he got david to do this and to do that but when this one came into the ring and the devil thought he was like everybody else he said this is just like another showdown but here comes a lowly little savior named jesus and he comes walking into the ring and the devil tried to test him he give a little job if thou be [Applause] and jesus said come on now come on now it is written did they ever say well that's a different one he probably again he said it is also written problem again and then jesus walk out the ring the devil doesn't know what's going on the devil doesn't know what's happening this boxer is boxing different [Applause] this box is a little different from everybody else he's trying to police a police file let me understand this one we can't find nothing against him there was no sin in this one he said i gotta find somebody to pin on this one the devils had to use an attack he said call him blc call him this but jesus uttered not a word because he was preparing to give a knuckle blow to the table the devil had never felt before but the problem said when jesus was in the wilderness with the devil satan was electrocuted with some faults that he never forgot but jesus wasn't finished with him yet can the church say amen jesus battled them battle and battle and then on the cross when jesus said it is finished the devil got one of those moves that he didn't understand him it looked as if jesus was knocked out cold [Applause] and the referee started to count one two three four 5 6 7 8 9 10 and the devil lift his hands up it looked as if jesus was finished the devil said let's call the biggest party we ever had because this one was the biggest fight i ever had it was round after round usually i could knuckle somebody in one round in two rounds in three rounds but this man give me a fight at the end let's celebrate but while the devil is celebrating here comes a boxer who did something no boxer i'd ever done before here comes a boxer who knocks on the door and he said i need to get inside of there they say you're not invited no i don't need to be invited and jesus walked in there and took the keys of debt and took the keys of hell [Applause] and he gave those keys to his bride he said don't fear that don't fear hell don't fear the grave you are just like me because i live you are going to live also i'm the resurrection and the life but listen this battle that i started this battle that i give the devil i'm gonna leave it to somebody special to finish this showdown is gonna be like no other battle abraham couldn't do this elijah couldn't do this moses couldn't do this peter couldn't do this match you couldn't do this i'm gonna leave a lady to do it come on now a little lady in 2016 she's going to be training for the final knockout punch can the church say man for the final showdown for the final battle satan has never been knocked out completely before but this time he's gonna get something he never expected from a group of people he never expected but the branham said when peter walked out of the upper room the devil didn't move but when he went by the gate called beautiful and said silver and gold i don't have but such as i have i give unto you the devil hit the alarm switch and say i thought we killed jesus who is doing all of that and there's peter there's james there's john there's paul come on now irenaeus martin columbus luther where's the all through the ages the devil just looking saying who are these people but in this age there'll be a group of people who will not see that they will not die they will oh come on now church they are getting ready for the final showdown the war that started in heaven is about to come to an end can the church say amen oh hallelujah so lift yourself this morning this year is over and with this year we are seeing cancer is over we're seeing blind eyes are over we are seeing diabetes is over we are seeing no praise demons are over no prayer life that's over being up and down that's over we are standing toe to toe and saying pull back to the devil we're saying we're going to pray we are going to worship we're going to have a prayer life we are going to cause a revival we're going to have a revival it's gonna start with me it's gonna start in my house i'm declaring war this morning this is elijah tell them elijah is here tell them the sons of god are back up tell them the time has come for the manifestation of the sons of god [Applause] oh hallelujah hallelujah oh my my my mind with the pranam said there's been churches churches brides brides churches churches prizes but it's got to come one there's got to become a real pride whole day has got to become a real bride they must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the dynamics of it makes the church live move in the power of the resurrection is going to be resurrection power in you it's going to be resurrection listen you can go if god if you god has you here this morning it's because your work is not complete don't let me hear you wanna die and are ready to go they're so ready to go if god could heal a 90 year old man and he could be shouting god could heal you i don't care where you at you could don't don't you don't may hear you talk about giving up [Music] i don't care what the doctor says i don't care what anybody says god is god and he can extend your life he can give you grace to fight him he's gonna heal you he you don't let the devil bind you you may be seated that's what a showdown is you know when the devil raises up in front of you and your natural responses will go and hide and say let me call the pastor let me call your assistant pastor let me call you elders to pray but your instinct as a soldier is you supposed to be always ready in season out of season friend or no friend on the job in the home in the school on the road though ten thousand fall on my right side the death angel could be walking down the road but you know you have the token on the inside you just display your token say listen this is who i am the dead angel has to pass you by don't you know you are protesting for a special mission [Applause] oh hallelujah so there's been churches churches prizes and they have been show showdown showdowns battles battles showdown but there must come a final showdown there's got to come a point where you break past the sound barrier as it were and when you break past the song mary there's nothing to hold you back anymore by the night there's nothing to keep you bound anymore there's nothing to keep your prayer life down anymore there's no devil in hell could hold you back once you pass the sound barrier but the problem said there's a lot of vibrations there's a lot of shakins up it feels like the wings want to fall off it feels like the engines want to come off but when you break past that barrier that sin barrier that dog barrier brother it's unlimited the potential that's in the church it's unlimited what's locked up inside of you [Applause] brother branham said in the message ministry explained he said what's the matter is we christians get too weak when it comes to the showdown [Applause] that's the prophet speaking we get too weak when it comes to the showdown if it's real it's real if it's not it's not he said and if i didn't believe him with all my heart and no it was real i would not be here tonight but i believe it and not only that i know it's real and that's why i've always said in my heart i want a reality i am i'm not just here to have church i'm not here just no it's got to be more than that there are many churches there are many groups but i want the reality of the living god hallelujah that's what i'm looking for for god to step into homes and heal marriages because he is god he is jehovah china he is jehovah's shaman he is jehovah that's god he promised him to take care of you he promised to heal you he promised to give you the victory you better believe it and stand up and claim it it's yours there's a difference between showdowns and a final showdown remember the brandon said if you don't testify you gonna backslide you know you said that right to some of you who never tell anybody about jesus god is fair you know he's just and he is tied to his own word and he makes no excuses so there's no bligh there's no free pass with god you have to be able to testify oh god and the reason i'm saying i remember when i was in secondary school i got in a showdown with somebody in my class about the bible and he chopped me to shreds going back and forth and scripture this means this and that means this and this and this and after that showdown i felt so defeated because i went with a motive to convince him that this thing was truth but he was more trained than i was in scripture so he was like what does this mean and what this mean and and for many people in the message we know the message but we don't know the bible when they pull scriptures is like but brother branham said this like who is brother branham so you got to know the scripture that's why even the prophet said back to the bible [Music] because the bible is god's word the prophet's mission was to bring a light and shine under the direction of the holy spirit into where is written and to tie up the loose ending to connect the pieces so that we could rightly understand the bible because the bible in isolation is a closed book it's a seal it's sealed to the pentecostal it's sealed to the catholics it's sealed to them they read scriptures and they're only seeing shadows but when you look into the reveal world you are seeing clearly and plainly what you are born to do what you are called to do [Applause] but only a showdown could show what's inside of you let me say that again it's only when the showdown comes it proves what's inside of you that's why there's a test the only way to prove that you didn't waste your five years in secondary school is to have a test [Applause] your test is a showdown it's you and the paper and the pencil and the examiner there and it's like a warfare and you walk in there you either know what you're doing or you're praying to god to remember the stuff you heard in form one that you never looked at again and it's a showdown and some people in 10 minutes is over because they only know 10 minutes worth of stuff and for others they don't really wire time up and they want to be finishing because they have a lot to say because they want to make sure they overcome in this showdown life is about conflict everything has conflict a chicken coming out of an egg is conflict it's a showdown who is going to win is it going to stay in its condition and stay in the comfort zone of the egg or is it going to break out away from that mama chicken and break out of the egg and it wins that show down it steps out [Music] then it wants to go and explore on its own it's a showdown that's life it's a showdown it's a battle it's a struggle you struggle every day to overcome it's built in all of us to struggle amen just like it's built in all of us to be creators because it's the genes of our fathers and it's a struggle because god wants you to be a creator and the devil wants you to be a copy a photocopy of somebody else but when you're the individual revelation you are born for a time as this to be just like your father to have dominion that to mean that adam was given that he forfeited and you recognize that when you worship and you pray and you praise god and you press and you battle and you contend there's something taking place in the inside that's connecting to who you are [Applause] i love it but the red hat said about twisting he said you can't go back if you were not there but only because you were there you could go back to that [Applause] where was thou when i laid a foundation viewed that's not for everybody but if you were there you could go back to that can the church say amen and something has to reveal to you that you were there and if you were there and you were a warrior there why are you a warrior here i just used two words huh if you were there you were a warrior you were a fighter over there now you're coming and you're worried and i'm worried if i'm gonna make her wondering how i can pay the bills i wonder i'm worrying about my child worrying if i could make it a worrying if i could if i'm going to get the holy ghost i don't know and but back there you are a warrior just like the eagle the eagle asked permission for me to seize meat and swoops down when and find a meat it grabs it because it's an eagle it don't ask permission from another eagle it knows that it has a right it's not a chicken it's not a hawk it's an eagle you don't need permission to go to the world and see your name in there you need permission to go to god that veil was ran from top to bottom that the priest had put up to but when jesus died it was direct access you don't need to go to anybody you can go straight to god and say lord my child is in trouble i need an intervention i can't reach somebody in another country but you are able just like that centurion i'm not even worthy for you to come under my roof but just speak to word that's who we are listen to the prophet he said the devil will make you prove every one of those virtues think about that the devil will make you prove every one of those virtues isn't that a showdown so if the virtue being tested is patience then you have a showdown coming a patient showdown and if you've been tested in temperance by the night you have a temperance showdown coming and a situation will come to see if you could be temperate to see if you could be patient so not every showdown requires the same response not every response but machine is drawing sword and chop you know when joseph had his shoulder and it was a potty for wife showdown [Music] and joseph take them shoes i thought it was nike and it was adidas i don't know who it was and he ran for his life so there are some showdowns to win you have to run there's some showdown stand still and see the salvation of god that's a different kind of showdown joseph couldn't see stand still and see this different kind of showdown but the bible says we are not ignorant of satan's devices so the devil comes with all kinds of and i said to young people many years ago you in church you're struggling you're holding on you want to be a christian you want to live right you want to have a testimony in your school on your job because you know better anybody who comes and walks through this you know better when you do nonsense it's a choice and the sad part is many of us we do the blame thing and the blame thing comes way back from adam it wasn't me was a woman it wasn't me it was his serpent in fact adam even threw god in him under the bus he said the woman you gave me so you blame your woman and god forgive because i was by myself alone do any telling i would not be in this position right now but god has got a responsibility of accepting responsibility for your choices that's why we are free moral agents so we have a choice on if we want to worship so that's when elijah reached the point of the showdown he said why halt ye between two opinions why are you stuck trying to decide if to serve the god of ahab or if to worship the living god why are you halt between two opinions to be a real christian or to just be a church member why are you stuck between two decisions to go all the way or just come part of the way why are you stuck between two decisions to dress one way for church you know i'm coming and dress another way when you want to go to your show you want to go to your thing or you want to go by your friends or whatever speak one way in the house of god and that's why i say it's easy to be a christian in church because by nature we could adapt our environment but when you are out there when nobody is looking or when you think nobody is looking that's the real you that's who the angel of the lord is following not following you when you're here in the church and you looking all churchy but when you wake up in the morning and you're in the maxi and the music song in good i remember one time i was in form 2 or so and my dad was against us going to school bazaars and stuff and so maybe i went to maybe one or so for a short moment and he sent us with uh somebody from church uh ola young person i was like form one from two i can't remember and to my shock this older person was dancing to the music like just bobbing his head now he said his music catchy boy and i was just appalled because this was supposed to be person making sure that i don't do that but it's about choices showdown is about a choice [Music] what you see is a choice you could say the right thing you could and and i know we hear it you know but you see what happens the showdown is when the heat get turns up and the pressure comes a lot of the stuff you train and you hear suddenly fades away you know that's when the pr that that's the show on the showdown it's done when it's nice and we could go through the service now and everything is all right but the showdown is when you're by yourself and there's nobody to check you and as i said to them in maryvale two weeks ago that still small voice that says don't do it but the brahmana said when you don't listen over and over you become so you lose the sensitivity and then you get cut off so when you make a choice to disrespect your parents when you make a choice to not come to church after a while it becomes easier and easier and easier that's why the bible says we are in a rebellious and time is a spirit so we don't want to sit back and act as if everything is all right because we are in a showdown right now but the brandon was preaching the greatest battle ever fought and a battle was going on right there in the tabernacle right there in the church so there's a showdown going on right now a showdown for your soul a showdown for your testimony a showdown to see if you're gonna put god first what if you're going to be just like anybody else you could be 10 years old and put god first you could be six years old and put god first you could be a 100 years old and put god first it has nothing to do with your age who your father is who your mother is it has to do with if god has spoken to your life to your heart [Music] you may be seated i knew when i started people thought i was going to get focused on the final show down to coming up but i want to stick here for a little while in this showdown here right now the showdown with your expectation and what you expect and how you expect god to move and god saying not yet i don't want to give you that because you have someone maturing up to do you have some much growing up to do brother branham said one time he said ministers we ever some more growing up to do because god wants some mature son some mature daughters who could weather the storm who could weather the trials who see trials for what they are that god will not give you more than you could be and what trial is more precious than gold and god wants to get your character so beautiful and so sweet that whenever you squeeze your life it's only perfume comes out because it's just like the rose of sharon when they crush the petals and calvary only the sweet fragrance of the rose of sharon could come out because so god gave us some sons and daughters that in 2017 would say god give us some more trials give us some more pressure give us some more showdowns because only the showdown could get us to overcome how many want to be overcomers how many want to face the showdown to overcome the showdown [Applause] only the overcomers the overcomers are the ones who overcome the showdown the showdown of the lust of the eyes the showdown of the lust of the flesh the showdown of the pride of life the showdowns of how you will conduct yourself during this christmas season amen but two two days ago i believe it was there was the earthquake in trinidad whole island shook i was there in my house and i was actually leaning just over the couch at the time and i felt the house began to shake and i said when i spoke that that tuesday evening and still i said for that brief moment you recognize how small you are in the architecture of god i looked out to the church there tuesday night and is one of the largest attendances we had on a tuesday night in a long time and brother anthony i said to them i believe in my heart that everybody had planned to come to service early that morning and it was not the earthquake that drove everybody to the house of god that evening but everything that can be shaken will be shaken people don't understand yet and was so powerful in his ministry last week when he was speaking about judgment and the bible said judgment will begin where in the house of god so don't look at judgment out there judgment begins in the house of god the bible says are the ancient men and the men who have sat in the message for a long time and they know better because to whom much is given much is required are the ancient men who have sat with the books and the tapes and the quotes and god is sending judgment because he will have no sin in his house he will have a church without spot without wrinkle so this is a showdown this morning to have a holy church to have a church built on prayer to have a church built on respects to have a church built on forgiveness because god is a god of judgment and he's a god of mercy [Applause] and the two come hand in hand but the brown said one day the last song will be sung one day the bible be closed for the last time and where will where will you be that's why the bible said seek ye the lord while he may be found call him while he is near this may be not the best type of service you want to hear to end the year you want to jump you want to shout but friends if we don't apply the token we miss the whole purpose of this message the rapture is going to be a small bunch of people friends it's not the whole message going to make it it's not the whole of christianity you talk about the rapture not because you talk about it means you're going to make it can the church say amen [Music] showdowns from the message god's way that's been made for us but ibrahim said so when it come time and the showdown and israel stood there by the sea god's path led across the sea so god looked down through the pillar of fire the sea got scared and moved back you hear that description the sea got scared and moved back and israel went across on dry land god's path led through it so what do you think will happen when you come to your shoulder and god wants to step in the sea your situation will get scared and move back we spoke about moses and his shoulder he spoke about daniel he had his showdown he stole him with a straw now about his prayer life that's what it was a song about his prayer life and what did daniel do curl up no he prayed he had a choice he could have gone and prayed under his bed so nobody would see it but you know what time daniel would pray that anybody could see him praying you know he had a choice he had a choice but a character want to hide you know think about it he had a choice to go where nobody would see him and pray but danielle was not afraid because he knew where his strength came from he knew where his power came from so he prayed just the same shame on you christians who don't even want to pray for your food at lunch in your lunch room on your job you're an embarrassment to the kingdom of god and if you are not strong enough to pray for your food on your lunch table yes i know some of you that that is dude and if you are ashamed of him what how do you want him to defend you and the bible says my people shall never be ashamed can the church say amen [Applause] real christians or no christians at all but ibraheem said uh god don't make halfway preachers he don't make half a christian but a preacher could be halfway a christian could be halfway but we want to go all the way we want god to do something for us but god expects something from us also a committed life a surrender life chem the church say amen the three hebrew boys had their showdown and they didn't back down they had a choice go into the fiery footage they said to break beg for mercy but they kept walking they kept walking they kept walking and when they got into the fiery furnace there was a fought man in the fire to meet them in their showdown can the church say amen and we spoke about elijah elijah said call all your prophets because the reason god held the rain and hell though the jew and reign is because the children of god had turned their backs on god and they were worshiping false idols he said call for us showdown call all your prophets call all your priests call all your believers let's have a convention set up your altar i'll settle my altar elijah was not afraid he's standing by himself he has no way to support him he has no way to encourage him but he has a revelation he said let it not be about numbers but let the god that answer by fire let that god be caught and that's what i'm saying this morning let the god who heals the sick let that call be god let the god who raises the dead let that god be called this morning you better have that god as your god this morning and those priests who were worshiping baal and bail him and all and that they put the animals there and they started dance and they started worship and elijah was so confident he began to tease them he said maybe your god is on a vacation maybe your god went fishing maybe your god went for a walk maybe your god went strolling and those men understand this but the brahmana said they were so sincere they believed that they had to cut themselves because they believed that they were right but when elijah's turn come now the whole nation is watching it's the final showdown in that day he said put it there he said pour water put some water in it because i want to make sure that you see it's really fire from god there's no flame burning anywhere there i didn't start this but let the god that answer by fire it's not a man-made fire it's not a church made fire is isn't a group fire but it's god answering by fire because he sees your life he sees your sacrifice he sees your testimony he sees you staying with his word he see you applying the token and all of a sudden the fire from heaven dropped down and the people began to repent god give us people like that who will stand in such a time as this in this showdown can the church say amen oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah the woman with the issue of blood she came to her showdown the bible said she has spent all that she had and i would expect if she had more money she would have spent it too but she had went from doctor to doctor with her condition but she had come to her crossroads as it was she had come to her showdown she had no many or no more options and called many times to bring us to the spot where we have no more options we have no more alternatives we have no more family to ask i could have imagined you would have asked a family for money ask her friends from money to keep peeing the doctor's pills she had the issue of blood for years and she kept trying to solve it but she heard that jesus was in town and she heard the testimonies of what jesus would do but she came to her crossroads and she told herself if i could just touch up the hem of his garment i'm going to be made whole she came to her showdown and god didn't make it easy for her he didn't clear a path for her but the currency had to press away past those who were just in the church she had to press away past those who were just warming a bench see you had to press away past those who just wanted to be in church hallelujah and she pressed away and she touched him of his garment and she made a withdrawal because she had faith to reach out and jesus looked around he said who touched me the disciples didn't understand what was going on they say but jesus everybody touching you he said this is different this woman made a withdrawal i've felt virtue left me i felt power left me i felt grace left me is there somebody here to small him who has come to dear showdown they have come to their crossroad they don't want to go back home until they get what they came for blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah the time for showdown god give us the courage god give us the strength to press away i come here this morning to fight for the young people i come here this morning to fight for sister christine i come here to fight for everybody who has been struggling for this whole year and i come to declare this new year is your year this season is your season this time is your time it's a new season it's a new day this is the final showdown we are putting this year behind us and we're getting ready to claim every redemptive right your backseat and son we speak a word for him this morning he has got to come house of hell give way to the name of jesus that's the season we are living in no more devil no more devil enough is enough we are calling you out we are calling our showdown this morning blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah you may be seated i say enough is enough and god is saying enough is enough also enough of the devil running through your house enough of the devil taking your joy enough of the devil taking your peace up you leave us on this will be victorious and by tuesday wednesday the devil have you on the ropes up but enough is enough we have worked too hard we have come too far we have labored too long we have held this sea long enough the prophet left us a message of promises and in this messages rapture and fate is rapturing grace it's a prize revival it's resurrection power it's another ephesians it's the voice of the archangel it's a power that's locked up only for the pride paul wish he could have been here brother branham wish he could have been here but we are here for the final showdown i will restore saith the lord all these years we have held a message will not be in vain your coming to church will not be in vain your prayers will not be in vain your shouting will not be in vain your testimony god has not forgotten you he could never forget you the children of israel were in bondage he said i've heard the cries of my people it's been 400 years but i remember my promise that i gave to abraham and god has remembered the promise that he placed concerning you through his prophet malachi 4 there will be a pride in this season on this island i can't speak for anywhere else but as for me and my house we will serve the lord we will have a revival a seven thunder seven sea revival the lord himself will make himself present in our midst to heal the sick to raise the dead to deliver the black sliders to break the chains somebody give god praise somebody give god a shout somebody give him worship oh hallelujah hallelujah i'm convinced i'm convinced that the revival has already started i'm convinced that what's going on right now is the airplane shaking as we break past the sound barrier i'm convinced that the engines are already started i'm convinced that the captain is in the seat i'm convinced because the power word says the lord himself is setting an order the holy ghost itself is setting an order for the coming of the lord this rapture express is about to leave and you are going there also your family is going to make it your loved one is going to make it oh

pressing into a new season pressing into a new time pressing into [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you have to forgive me but i'm tired of the devil you have to forgive me but i'm tired of sickness you have to forgive me but i'm tired of depression hasn't the devil done enough hasn't he hurt enough people hasn't he taken enough young people hasn't he coming from too many homes when are we going to say enough is enough i feel like shamgar this morning shamga had reached a point where he was tired of giving up his prayer life giving up his labor every season after he would plant him and he would reap and he would put away the harvest to fill his times would come and they would take it away from him but the pranam said you may be seated but the president said that had reached a point where he couldn't take it anymore he said shamga looked out but ibrahim said it was me about 600 philistines coming he said shangha stood there the prophet said he looked at his wife he looked at his daughter he said not another season am i going to give up my labor to the philistines brother branham said shanghai was dressed like a farmer he said he was not a soldier but in his heart but the branham said he was concerned and then he got convinced he was convinced that god was with him but the problem said he was not a soldier he didn't have a sword he didn't have a spear he didn't have a shield he had an ox code you know where the ox goat is it's what used to go the oxen just to push it forward it was not a weapon but he reached his point he reached his limit he couldn't take it no more shambhala was tired of praying and seeing the devil take his joy he was tired of coming to church and going back home and not seen a change in his life he was tired of seeing his wife cry he was tired of seeing his daughter hungry he was tired of seeing his little bitty boys not have food he may be seated hallelujah it was not it was not that shangha wasn't working it was not that shangha was lazy shangha was working samgye was struggling sangha was praying sangha was crying out but when the harvest came the philistines would come and they would take it all away and shamga told himself not this time not this time and i want to say this morning not this year not this year i can't talk about 2016 anymore it's over 2015 it's over but 2017 not this time not this time it's not

we're gonna have a revival so you know what the pilot says some girl got her ox code and he ran out he didn't wait for them he didn't wait for them he saw them coming he didn't wait for them he looked

minutes i want to get this in there but the branham said shamgar was convinced it had just become too much for him and many times you have to come to the spotlight shanghai he had become used to giving up his harvest but the devil just pushed just once too much and this time he made up his mind that he was not giving up again he looked not just at himself but he looked at his wife but he looked at his child look at his family i want to challenge you look not just at yourself but look at your family look at your wife your husband your child your brother your sister look at the person who's next to you right now because that's your family i'll catch your burden and say lord is he not fizzy enough i'm tired of seeing sister christine in pain doesn't that that that that should affect you on a deep level i'm tired of seeing my brothers and sisters struggling with their back their eyes it comes a point where you say it's enough is enough enough is enough seeing our young people struggling listen all young people they love god they want to serve god and the enemy has done a number in their minds in the school and on their friends and many of you parents you have done the best that you could the best that you know how you have loved them more than that you could even put into words but still they have a hard time and you know this is the truth and you pray for them and you cry out for them but i want to say enough is enough this is the season for their restoration the philistines have done enough and we come to push them back we come to serve them notice that this is the final showdown but the branham said in the message convinced and then concerned he said if this group of people here tonight and i say today could get that much convinced he said god gave the promises and when god gave the promise to abraham he said he would have possessed the gate of his enemies and so shanghai believed that and looked at the odds against him listen to the prophet and this is what i'm looking for today he said god only needs one man [Music] so i'm looking for one person i know i'm one this morning but is there anybody else this morning he said god only needs one man god just let just let him get one man in his hand the world will think he's crazy but he will drive home the gospel when he's thoroughly convinced listen to what he's convinced about that jesus christ remains the same yesterday today and forever under anything else he will stand through and go on because he's thoroughly convinced that god is god and if he ever was god he's still god and if he isn't the god he was he never was god that's right he's the infinite god the all-powerful this is the prophet almighty omnipresent omniscient infinite he said oh my he's god he's the same god that opened the red sea he's the same god that brought daniel out of the lion's den the same god that brought the hebrew children from the fiery furnace up he's the same god that raised up jesus christ on easter morning he's the same god that fell in there pentecost he's the same god that raised lazarus out of the grave he's the same yesterday today and forever and i'm convinced that this is the holy ghost oh my that's the prophet's words but the prayer goes on he said peter said on the day of pentecost this is that and if this isn't that i'll keep this till that comes up for i believe this is that i'm convinced that it's the gospel and the power and the demonstration of the resurrection of the appearing of the lord jesus christ in this last day making the church ready to be caught away in the pride can the church see man oh my oh my oh my oh my is there anybody convinced this morning is anybody convinced this morning is anybody concerned this morning listen to the prophet moses in the same message moses esteem the reproach of christ listen greater riches than the treasures of egypt i want to say this friends you hunt all kinds of stuff in life that nice house a nice car the money the dist or whatever it is but moses esteemed the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures of egypt therefore he forsake a throne he took his choice with the poor ignorant illiterate slaves why he esteemed the riches of christ greater treasures than to have his glory in the world at that time [Applause] can the church say amen oh have all the glory they want but what god wants today is men and women who isn't interested in great big fineries and all these other things but somebody undertake the simple word of god and preach it with all that's in them and wait on god for the power of god to manifest himself hallelujah we can't bring the manifestation on in our time but when the time has come it's just like elijah tell them i'm here and one of these days there will be an announcement around the world tell them the pride is here tell them the pride is here once more they are sons and daughters of god just like adam dominion on the earth once more the bees will know it the trees will know it the sky will know it the seas will know it can the church say man oh somebody give the lord a shout our praise hallelujah hallelujah oh my my my my my mind oh i'm getting ready to close out now could you take some more hallelujah so brother branham he proclaimed a message a shout message and that short message was a call to war that message was to place us in another ephesians that in another ephesians where the fate will be preached and brother stephen was so tremendous a couple weeks he was speaking about defeat not a fate or a belief or a doctrine but the faith that the early church had because malachi 4 come to restore the heart of the children back to the apostolic faith because it takes faith to operate the power it takes faith to move the sword so every service we we're getting prepared by the word we get them prepared by the world because faith comes by hearing the word and when you are convinced and you get concerned that the time is now and god is able and he's still the same yesterday today and forever then all of a sudden your walk begins to change your talk begins to change and every attack the devil could put might be against your body but he could never touch your soul there's a seed in your soul that the devil cannot touch by the pop well he could watch you he could bring your headaches and your mind battles and mess with your mind and your memory and your conscience and your imagination but your soul belongs to god and the devil is mad he's upset hallelujah so maybe after this year you're a little tired a little wary and you know there are some people they almost want to send themselves off maybe a little tired maybe a little weary but i want to encourage you this morning maybe you didn't understand how this happened why this happened maybe you've seen so much you don't even know if you want to fight anymore and say lady on people fight but today we are all going to fight for every inch of ground we all want to fight to see these great hairs turn back black i was saying to my wife just yesterday i find my rate of gray hair growth is becoming exponential it used to be one or two i said tell everything last two months i just see like a whole crop of gray but brother barry that grey hair got to turn back that gray hair got to go can i stand my promise if my hair grows and it's hard to see here is a little lower than the size for some reason i don't know why one time i told the barber cut this to match this but it's a showdown amen amen paul's today said death where's your sting grave where's your victory he looked in his face and laughed show down because he knew where he was standing that's the confidence we must all have he could speak that way because he had met the pillar of fire his approval was not from man his approval was not from gamaliel his approval was not from jerusalem his approval was from the pillar of fire the pillar of fire placed him into his position and that's what we want sons and daughters of god placed by fire whether we have a service or not your connection is vertical your connection is not horizontal if british stephen isn't here i can't be like oh gosh i wonder what's going on no my connection is political if nobody else wants to worship my eyes are closed to everybody else what they are going through is that what i'm going through i will worship nobody well no nobody else standing up so i what is that yo your connection must be vertical when god speaks to you you respond because god is speaking to you if nobody else is hearing him this morning and you hear him you should be so happy so excited to hear the voice of god inside of your soul somebody see man my could you take some more it's the last sunday you know no i don't want you to think i'm finished now [Music] you're getting service today and next week one time from the message putting on the whole armor of god remember i said you know in this warfare between nations there's a great warfare going on beyond that so while the bible says you'll hear of wars and rumors of wars and the end is not yet but the banner is now saying let's go higher than that there's a great warfare going on beyond that and that's a great warfare between god and satan a great warfare that was the first warfare and it's still raging but oh i'm so glad it'll soon come to an end then it'll all be over and listen listen carefully young people satan has his agents out everywhere i want you to get this so this is not about you coming to church and going to work and going to school satan has his agents out everywhere watching spying out on god's people god's moves the enemy is setting everywhere watching to see what he can do and god's got some out too so god's got some agents out of the shame so we find out that these secret agents of the enemy that sits around now listen but the brother said each nation now will equip its men with the latest equipment the very latest and they study and they do everything they're trying to counteract the other fellows weapons and to get a little more modern weapon a little something with a little more punch to it from the bow and arrow to a musket and from a musketeer a modern rifle and from that to an atomic they just keep on building and it keeps them busy all the time and it's the nation's business if they want to survive they want to equip their souls with the best equipment that there is but the brandon goes and he said well god you know he's infinite see he don't have to think of anything better he's just got the best to begin with so you can't improve on it nothing's to be done about it he just gives us the best and that's his word that's right that's his word the best that can be given and god gives his people the very best that's what he chose for his children the very very best i'm so glad of that listen to the prophet now god cannot make a decision today listen carefully and tomorrow come back and make a better decision let me say it again god cannot make a decision today and come back tomorrow and make a better decision so if god elected you he cannot come back and make a better decision to pick somebody else when god chose you he made the best decision he made the best choice you were his first choice he went at his second choice and the church say amen listen to the prophet see because his first decision is perfect he never has to change it so therefore we can rest upon whatever god says and if god says we're going to get the holy ghost that decision is already made there's no better decision we can rest on that and i'm resting on it this morning we are going to have a revival we are going to have a revival oh my my oh my oh my everybody feeling fine everybody feeling energized you ready for another three hours oh my hallelujah so we are getting ready for war but i'm saying the message of paradox he said any man that believes god any man it doesn't even speak about his condition he said any man that believes god and takes him at his word no matter what the situation is god will perform another paradox to keep his word he didn't say how you're living how you're acting he said if any man believe god and take him at his word no wonder but the brandon could talk about the people will come and get healed in the prayer lines who were prostitutes who were living any way they wanted but they believed god and they took him at his word and god healed them and people sat in the tabernacle for 20 years to 10 years for five years believing and got nothing because they didn't have the fate but this morning we have a faith to see god do something [Applause] you may be seated not by legalism not by rules and i said to them and marava listen this gospel this message is not about rules [Music] do this don't do this do this don't do this young people say we have too much rules it's not about rules it's about love so i said to them in marvel my wife wasn't in the service but i said if my wife tells me to put the white clothes here and put the color here because it's easier to wash i could go and tell my friend's boy tony boy my wife a real rules i have to put it white here and put the color here but it's not a rule to me is love because if she loves it that way my love for her to make her happy with big all the white hair and all the colored hair so i don't see it as a ruler i love her so if you want the white clothes here white clothes colored hair colored clothes and whatever god wants from me if he says do it this way i say yes lord here yes lord here is that the rule he loves me i love him it's a relationship [Applause] you may be seated two weeks ago you know there's a facebook status relationship status single married it's complicated he said your relation with god cannot be complicated it's either it's real or it's not you can't be not sure how things stand between you and god i really shouldn't be kind of rocking no no no no keep that relationship on point all the time the same he give you gifts you give him gifts a sacrifice of praise that's a gift to him surprise him with a gift of worship surprise him with spontaneous glory just stand in the middle of the day lock yourself in the bathroom and say lord i want to thank you for your grace and your love and your mercy [Applause] can the church say man i'm all over the place this morning but i pray this gives you some substance to fight the battle that when nobody else is around that's that's what this is about that you could stand when nobody else is looking anywhere under any time under any condition the earthquake must come on you must look around and stand strong knowing that the canopy of life you know the brandon walked and there was a bubble around him people would come to him and they would stop he said don't be afraid that's just the presence of god it was something you could feel it's something that you just recognized you hit something you can't see with the eye but he was protected i know you know when you give your life completely to him and he takes the driver's seat because he isn't there he has his own security guards so when he's in there his security guards become your security guard can the church say man i want you to understand friends if the president of the united states is driving and is his whole motorcade the plane on top all the security and you just standing by so he said come and get a ride with me and you sit in that car then all of a sudden you are protected you are just as protected as the president of the united states so when you think god plays the holy ghost which is a part of himself in you isn't he obligated to protect himself [Applause] that's why he said no weapon formed against you can prosper because they tried weapons on jesus but it couldn't prosper they will pick up deadly things they wouldn't harm them if death couldn't kill him how could it affect you it might change your location your dwelling place but your soul belongs to god you are cut from a different cloth your dna has has has has as resurrection built in there not everybody has that you know that's why you confuse the doctors how much testimony you have you don't know how you made it through and the doctor said this about you that's about you we read it every sunday praise after praise after praise is your dna is different your blood type is not a or a positive that's not your blood type your blood type is the same jeans that come from god [Applause] come the church say amen [Applause] just a little more i'm just trying to find a way to close out here to encourage you so we are getting ready for war for a final showdown a final battle abraham is counting on us joshua is counting on us david is counting on us they did their part to the best of their ability but they had to pass the but turn on to the next group to take it and the next man to take it and the next judge and the next prophet and when jesus came he passed the battle on to the church all i was in god reported to christ all i was in christ before this church and then the first church aid come and when they were done they passed it on and every age was a battle every age had a thunder every age had a voice every age had a message every age had a people every each at a time but now we are the end of the ages there's no more messenger to come but there is a people on the land there's no more time to come because time is no more we are in that season now where the devil is confused the devil is mad he doesn't understand what is going on but her pride is getting ready you know what brother branham said the third pull is for the weaker ones the ones who don't even have the faith can't even muster the fate but the brandon also said that when you get over there you're going to see people there you never thought we're going to make it so god picked for the clarence a bunch of misfits a bunch of unqualified people just like how we picked peter and james and john who were not qualified god picked a bunch of unqualified people who didn't have the best resumes they didn't have the best resumes for the kangaroo didn't have the best qualifications but he still say i want to choose you paul was a murderer he still choose paul peter was of all kind of he still choose him david was all he still choose him and why god wouldn't choose you you are already chosen to overcome in such a time as this and to overcome [Applause] i'm looking for a point to close out i got some a lot more here but i want to close up but friends this final showdown will bring in your family this final show now will bring in your loved ones this world will shake with the premise it'll be so much power this world will cannot contain it all and then the rapture is going to take place he said it won't last long but it's going to be here a short quick message that will shake the whole nation so mrs jesus christ may god richly bless you keep pressing the battle keep fighting the good fight of faith and don't let the devil steal your joy you're gonna make it god richly bless you give him praise this morning give him a shout of praise hallelujah hallelujah thank you lord jesus thank you glory glory glory glory hallelujah do you love him this morning oh hallelujah what a ministry this morning do you appreciate god7 oh hallelujah oh hallelujah

people as they give in tithes and offering lord may bless the household and bless him abundantly lord ain't you see me praying amen [Music] is like that today foreign one more time [Applause] it's
