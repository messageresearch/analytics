[12:01] word a prayer tonight Heavenly Father we
[12:04] thank you you are so good to allow us to
[12:06] see this year
[12:09] 2025 just just a couple of years back
[12:12] they were talking about white Tok and
[12:14] the year 2000 and all the years that's
[12:17] rolled by and father we know you hold
[12:21] the future we know the challenges and
[12:24] the times that LE ahead has prophesied
[12:26] not only by the oh God the Bible but by
[12:29] your 20th century Prophet William Brown
[12:32] as he prophesied what is going to take
[12:34] place in this bright season help us
[12:36] tonight give us cues give us a word may
[12:39] we hear from you tonight that we help us
[12:42] along life's journey where we all live
[12:44] on this planet Earth we have everyday
[12:46] challenges to face help us and equip us
[12:49] and Empower us tonight to deal with
[12:51] every challenge day by day because it's
[12:54] a day byday battle as bar Anthony
[12:56] preached about the Lord possessing and
[12:59] maintaining was a key message oh God for
[13:02] this season and time to know that we
[13:04] could push and possess but we must also
[13:07] maintain and then we could push some
[13:08] more so speak to us tonight by your word
[13:11] may your spirit come down in a special
[13:13] way Spirit of pray supplication touch
[13:15] his sick in our midst remember brother
[13:16] the clarents Lord and touch them and
[13:18] raise them up in good health and
[13:19] strengthen every other person that may
[13:21] be sick and body May touch them and heal
[13:23] them in Jesus name I ask it amen and
[13:26] amen God bless you and thanks so much
[13:29] coming out tonight this first Friday of
[13:34] 2025 so tonight I want to take a
[13:37] scripture from M
[13:38] Micah
[13:41] 4 and I want to read a line of verse
[13:47] 10 Micah 4:
[13:50] 10 be in
[13:52] pain and labor to bring
[13:55] forth oh daughter of Zan I right there
[14:00] be in pain and labor to bring forth da
[14:04] of Zan my title for this exaltation
[14:05] tonight is labor to bring forth oh
[14:08] Daughter of
[14:09] Zion now we have had two powerful
[14:12] Services possess and maintain and we
[14:15] need to see Jesus the tong word for
[14:17] them reframing your
[14:20] thinking from why this happened to
[14:24] me to why this happened for me
[14:29] the to me
[14:31] part would seek to
[14:33] blame others or things or go down in
[14:38] self-pity why this happened to me
[14:41] because and who and so on but the for me
[14:45] part why this happened for me that part
[14:50] seeks to understand how this would work
[14:53] for your
[14:54] good or what lessons is in it that you
[14:58] can learn and
[15:01] grow because in everything we go through
[15:04] there are lessons and there are things
[15:07] for us to learn and grow not just to be
[15:11] informed not just for knowledge but how
[15:15] can what you go through grow you how you
[15:19] can grow from it for example Luke 2
[15:24] speaks about Caesar Augustus the word
[15:26] should be taxed and a just pop up like
[15:30] that everyone have to go in their own
[15:33] City Joseph
[15:35] Mary they have to head to Bethlehem to
[15:39] be taxed Mary's exous wife great with
[15:42] child and so it was while they were dear
[15:45] the days were accomplished that she
[15:47] should be delivered and she brought
[15:49] forth her firstborn son and wrapped him
[15:53] in swaden clothes and laid him in a
[15:55] Manger because there was no room for
[15:58] them at
[15:59] in now the why this is happening to me
[16:03] pregnant Mary and that donkey going a
[16:06] merry way and all of a sudden laws
[16:08] change taxation you have to go to your
[16:11] place of origin and something like that
[16:13] heading down but the for me part that
[16:19] Jesus was going to be born not in the
[16:22] place he should be according to prophecy
[16:24] so the Taxation and the laws that was
[16:27] instituted by Caesar Augustus was to get
[16:31] Jesus in position so it doesn't make
[16:34] sense getting a plard and protesting
[16:36] against the government and fighting this
[16:38] and fighting the question is what is
[16:40] this
[16:42] for now the bride would have to have her
[16:46] labor pains to bring forth
[16:49] Messiah and just as a thought maybe that
[16:52] is what the Press is about the the Press
[16:55] is a a forcing a pressing a stress
[17:00] Matthew 9:36 says he said unto his
[17:03] disciples the Harvest truly is
[17:05] plenteous but the laborers are
[17:08] few listen to Jesus prayer
[17:11] request pray ye
[17:13] therefore the lord of the Harvest that
[17:17] he will send forth laborers into his
[17:19] hands I want you to know
[17:22] tonight whether you're old whether
[17:25] you're middleaged whether you're young
[17:29] we are called to be
[17:31] laborers
[17:33] not
[17:35] uh Li All By the Sea relaxing relaxers
[17:39] not entertainers not we are called to be
[17:42] laborers Jesus actually ask that a
[17:46] prayer go for that he would send forth
[17:48] laborers into his Harvest so tonight
[17:51] I'll be speaking a bit about Labor
[17:54] travail and you would get where I'm
[17:56] going tonight 1 Corinthians 3
[18:01] three says vers six I have planted
[18:04] Apollo watered but God give the increase
[18:07] so neither is he that planted anything
[18:09] neither he water it but God gave the
[18:10] increase now he that planted and he that
[18:13] water it a one and every man shall
[18:15] receive his own reward according to his
[18:17] own labor here we go get to for we are
[18:21] laborers together with God he are God's
[18:25] husbandry he are God's Building so if
[18:28] this scripture here tonight for we are
[18:31] laborers should eliminate those who want
[18:33] to sit back and relax and watch others
[18:35] labor and understand the calling of God
[18:40] that we are to
[18:41] labor and to labor is to press to
[18:46] travail and I use a word in the little
[18:48] letter I sent out from the pastor's desk
[18:50] pleading
[18:52] prayer I find this very
[18:54] interesting not just prayer but pleading
[18:58] prayer pray or travailing prayer if I
[19:02] could use that word St John 1620 says
[19:04] verily I said to you this is Jesus
[19:07] speaking that he shall weep and lament
[19:10] but the world shall
[19:11] rejoice he shall be
[19:14] sorrowful but your sorrow shall be
[19:17] turned to joy and
[19:19] Jesus contextualized it he put it in a
[19:22] context here by saying a
[19:25] woman when she is in travail at
[19:29] sorrow because the hour is come but as
[19:32] soon as she is delivered of the child
[19:35] she remember no more the anguish for joy
[19:40] that a man is Born Into the world ye now
[19:43] therefore have sorrow but I will see you
[19:46] again and your heart shall rejoice and
[19:48] your joy no man take it from you travil
[19:55] travail is a term for the painful Pro
[19:58] ESS a woman experiences in giving birth
[20:02] to a child and this is expressed in
[20:05] Genesis 35 verse 16 and it says here and
[20:09] they journeyed from beel and there was
[20:11] but a little way to come to ephra and
[20:14] Rael travailed and she had hard
[20:17] labor and it came to pass when she was
[20:21] in hard labor that the Midwife said unto
[20:24] her fear not thou shall have this
[20:29] also so this thing about
[20:33] working God worked for 6 days and he
[20:37] rested on the
[20:38] 7 this word about
[20:42] Labor this is why he placed man in the
[20:45] Garden of Eden the Bible said there was
[20:46] no man to tell the soil he wanted a man
[20:52] that would take what was dear and expand
[20:55] it grow it Harvest it
[20:59] add to it and the only way this could
[21:02] have been done is to put that spirit
[21:05] being man into flesh that he could till
[21:08] the soil there was no man to till the
[21:11] soil adoption but I'm speaking here he
[21:16] said
[21:19] um then he came down and taken upon
[21:21] himself while he did that he did that
[21:24] here we go church that he might save you
[21:26] who wants to be saved do you see what I
[21:28] mean
[21:29] by for knowledge the infinite God who
[21:32] knowed all things saw the lamb and he
[21:36] slay the lamb before the foundation of
[21:37] the world and he put your name on the
[21:39] Lamb's Book of Life and he seen here we
[21:42] go the deceitfulness of Satan what he
[21:44] would do so he put your name on dear
[21:46] that he said that the Antichrist would
[21:48] be so religious so good such a fine
[21:50] fellow such a smart man such a religious
[21:52] man that he would deceive the very
[21:55] elected if it was possible it is
[21:58] impossible because their names were
[22:01] foreordained before the foundation of
[22:03] the world by election he chose them and
[22:06] by and by
[22:08] predestination they know where they are
[22:10] going there you are now this is it here
[22:13] now who could doubt that that is what
[22:16] Paul said that is Paul's writing that's
[22:20] what he taught his church the church
[22:22] listen carefully
[22:25] positionally before the foundation of
[22:27] the world and this is the bum here now
[22:30] when God in his labor pain was bringing
[22:36] forth bringing forth you knowing what
[22:41] you would do he positionally placed you
[22:44] into his own body to be a housewife to
[22:48] be a farmer to be a preacher to be a
[22:53] prophet to be this or to be that he
[22:57] place you positionally
[22:59] then when we have come from the G lands
[23:01] of Egypt through sanctification and is
[23:04] baptized into the promised land for the
[23:07] promise of God is the Holy Ghost
[23:09] Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the holy
[23:10] spirit of God whereby you are sealed
[23:12] until the day of your Redemption then
[23:15] God having predestinated the church he
[23:18] said all the peoples there'll be million
[23:22] times million that shall walk religious
[23:23] and be deceived the only ones that will
[23:26] not be deceived will be those that have
[23:27] come over
[23:29] into the promised land who before the
[23:31] foundation of the world had their names
[23:33] put in the L Book of Life and come over
[23:35] into the promised land and enjoying it
[23:38] and enjoying it so listen friends what
[23:41] we just read here is that God had his
[23:45] labor pain to bring you and I to bring
[23:48] us forth in his own mind so if God had
[23:53] labor
[23:54] pain don't you think that you will
[23:57] escape having lab La
[23:59] pains but BR they told me to preach 2
[24:03] hours I done it again tonight let me
[24:05] tell you something BR you are either
[24:08] marked in or marked out and if you got a
[24:11] bit of spirit about you tonight that you
[24:14] know that you are wrong here's the old
[24:16] sort tril a mner bench down here for you
[24:21] to stay here and moan and groan under
[24:26] the labor pain
[24:28] until God comes down and fill you with
[24:31] the Holy Ghost let me read that again he
[24:33] said there's a mest bench down here for
[24:35] you to stay here and moon and groan
[24:40] under the labor pains until God come
[24:43] down and F with the ghost you see
[24:48] huh there are thousands and thousands of
[24:51] people go to church go to shrines go to
[24:53] MOS go to whatever but they go to that
[24:56] with a religious frame of mind
[24:59] they go to that almost like bringing
[25:01] what a sacrifice to God offering to God
[25:04] God I'm here thing but this Kingdom that
[25:10] John came to introduce that Jesus
[25:11] preached about he said the kingdom is
[25:14] preached and Men you know what I'm where
[25:16] I'm going press their way into it so
[25:19] just think about it now you as a parent
[25:23] you as a wife or husband you as family
[25:26] you can't take your children in
[25:29] you can Inspire them to press to get in
[25:32] but you can't drag them as a club this
[25:34] is my children and no it it doesn't work
[25:37] that way it's one by one it's individual
[25:41] it's a little more than going to church
[25:42] is to recognize that you have to die out
[25:46] and you have to be born into this
[25:47] glorious Kingdom and you have to be
[25:49] filled with the Holy Ghost and I'm
[25:51] almost done but the Bram and there a
[25:54] particular C that we know when our
[25:56] church is groaning under the persecution
[25:59] of the outside world that Believing on
[26:01] the Lord Jesus that the promise of the
[26:03] Holy Ghost is just as real to us as the
[26:04] Pentecost how they grown and cry under
[26:07] labor pains but when they are born and
[26:10] positionally Born Into the kingdom of
[26:12] God then the Holy Ghost has set in the
[26:14] church some Apostles some prophets some
[26:16] teachers some Pastor evangelist so when
[26:19] these men believing that they are that
[26:22] without this process here they are
[26:25] deceived when these men just take for
[26:28] granted well a preaching I have a voice
[26:31] I have a gift therefore that is that is
[26:33] not so gift and calling without
[26:36] repentance and that is why I'm talk
[26:38] about a scrap people of ministers
[26:39] because they didn't get into it right
[26:41] they figure that because they could go
[26:43] be the pulpit and speak things and say
[26:44] things that's the end of it as we see go
[26:47] looking for a better sermon he looking
[26:49] for a better man a better man will
[26:52] produce a better sermon I'm going to I
[26:56] right sometime
[26:58] from this m short this is one I
[27:01] discovered this Al so beautiful but I'm
[27:03] talking about God was in Christ reconcil
[27:05] the world for him to himself he says God
[27:09] dwelt in the body of Christ here this
[27:12] one he could have come down from heaven
[27:14] right from the corders of heaven with a
[27:16] full Angel salute if he wanted to he
[27:18] could have been born a full mature man
[27:22] he could have come down with all the
[27:24] pump and Glory of heaven but he didn't
[27:26] choose that he come to a stable born in
[27:30] a Manuel Pine little Jehovah Crying In A
[27:33] Manger little Jehovah playing as a boy
[27:36] little Jehovah toiling as a man he cross
[27:41] his cast with us and God become human
[27:44] when Jesus was born God was human on
[27:48] earth manifesting God what he was here
[27:53] we go he
[27:55] toiled and labored and felt for the
[27:59] teenager he went through every
[28:02] Temptation that we go through did you
[28:05] get that Jesus wasn't lazy Jesus wasn't
[28:08] sitting down lying and just carrying on
[28:12] he toiled and labor so he knows what the
[28:15] teenager go through you know what the
[28:17] young men go through not only that he
[28:20] went through every Temptation that means
[28:23] he was tempted by women he was tempted
[28:25] by money he was tempted by popularity
[28:27] what whatever test whatever challenge
[28:30] whatever issue there was at that time he
[28:33] went through Temptation God did it that
[28:37] he might do his own personal his own
[28:39] judgment Justice his judgment has got to
[28:42] be Justice if there no justice what
[28:44] could does it be to have judgment so he
[28:47] took the penalty of his own judgment and
[28:50] died as a sinner to condemn sin in the
[28:52] world that we to his Justice might have
[28:56] reconciliation back to the throne of God
[28:58] in
[28:59] Fellowship oh man isn't that a beautiful
[29:03] thing tonight as we
[29:06] wrap there's a song I am watching for
[29:09] the coming of that glad Millennial
[29:11] day when our blessed Lord shall come and
[29:14] catch his waiting B away oh my heart is
[29:18] filled with Rapture as I labor Watch and
[29:22] Pray our Lord is coming back to it again
[29:25] we know that soon today but Kelly sou
[29:28] sent me something he was asking the Lord
[29:31] about uh Prevail in prayer and he got
[29:36] onto something from Charles finny about
[29:39] prevailing pay and I want to read some
[29:41] of that I just felt it come in time of
[29:43] what I had prepared labor to bring forth
[29:45] a daughter of Z and I want to read that
[29:47] now this is from a lecture that was
[29:50] given upon prevailing prayer the
[29:52] scripture he used was the effectual F
[29:54] prayer of a righteous man and let much
[29:57] and this to me was kind of mind
[30:00] blown the last lecture referred
[30:02] principally to the confession of sin
[30:04] tonight my remarks will be chiefly
[30:07] confined to the subject of intercession
[30:10] or
[30:11] prayer there are two kinds of of means
[30:15] requisite to promote a
[30:17] Revival one to influence men the other
[30:22] to influence God the truth is employed
[30:26] to influence men
[30:28] and prayer to move God when I speak of
[30:32] moving God I do not mean that God's mind
[30:36] is changed by prayer or that his
[30:39] disposition of character is changed but
[30:42] prayer produces such a change in us and
[30:47] fulfills such conditions as renders it
[30:50] consistent for God to do as it would not
[30:54] be consistent for him to do otherwise
[30:57] when a sinner repents the State of Mind
[31:01] makes it proper for God to forgive him
[31:05] God has always been ready to forgive him
[31:09] on that condition so that when The
[31:12] Sinner changes his mind towards God it
[31:17] requires no change of feeling in God to
[31:20] Pardon him it is the sinner's
[31:23] repentance that renders his forgiveness
[31:26] proper and is the occasion of God acting
[31:30] as he does so when Christians offer
[31:34] effectual prayer their state of mind
[31:38] renders that they felt right and offered
[31:42] or let me say yeah when Christians offer
[31:45] effectual prayer their state of mind
[31:49] rended it proper for God to answer them
[31:53] he was always ready to bestow the
[31:55] blessings on the condition that they
[31:56] felt right and offer the right kind of
[31:59] prayer whenever this change take place
[32:02] in them and they offer the right kind of
[32:05] prayer then God without any change in
[32:08] himself can answer them when we offer
[32:12] effectual fervent prayer for others the
[32:15] fact that we offer such prayer renders
[32:18] it consistent for him to do what we pray
[32:22] for when otherwise it would not have
[32:24] been
[32:25] consistent prayer is an essential Link
[32:28] in the chain that causes that lead to
[32:32] Revival as much so as truth is some have
[32:36] zealously used truth to convert men and
[32:38] laid very little stress on prayer they
[32:41] have preached and talked theyed tracks
[32:44] with great Zeal and then wondered that
[32:48] they had so little success and the
[32:51] reason was they forgot to use the other
[32:54] branch of the means effectual prayer
[32:58] they Overlook the fact that Truth by
[33:01] itself will never produce the effect
[33:04] without the spirit of God and that
[33:07] Spirit has given an answer to Earnest
[33:11] prayer sometimes it happens that those
[33:14] who are the most engaged in employing
[33:16] truth are not the most engaged in prayer
[33:20] this is always unhappy for unless they
[33:23] or somebody else have the spirit of
[33:25] prayer the truth by itself self will do
[33:28] nothing but Harden men in
[33:31] impenitence probably in the day of
[33:33] judgment it will be found that nothing
[33:35] is ever done by truth used ever so
[33:38] zealously unless there's a spirit of
[33:40] prayer somewhere in connection with the
[33:43] presentation of Truth others ear on the
[33:47] other side not that they lay too much
[33:49] stress on prayer but they Overlook the
[33:51] fact that prayer might be offered
[33:53] Forever by itself and nothing would be
[33:56] done because for Sinners are not
[33:58] converted by direct contact of the Holy
[34:01] Ghost but by the truth employed as a
[34:04] means to expect the conversion of
[34:06] Sinners by prayer alone without the
[34:08] employment of Truth is to tempt
[34:11] God uh Skelly I thank you for sharing
[34:13] this with me and this is the last thing
[34:16] I have here from Hebrews chapter 4 let
[34:19] us therefore fear least a promise being
[34:22] left us of enter into his rest any of
[34:25] you should seem to come short enough
[34:28] andless any of you means all of us for
[34:31] unto us was the Gospel preached as well
[34:34] unto them but the word preach did not
[34:36] profit them not being mixed with faith
[34:39] that heard them for we which have
[34:42] believed do entered into his rest as he
[34:45] said I want to go down ver verse six
[34:49] seeing therefore it remain that some may
[34:53] enter therein and they to whom it was
[34:55] first preached entered not because of
[34:57] unbelief
[34:58] verse 8 for if Jesus had given them rest
[35:01] they would not afterwards have spoken of
[35:03] another day therefore there remain a
[35:07] rest to the people of God for he that
[35:10] has entered into his rest he also has
[35:12] ceased from his own works as God did
[35:14] from his and this is the verse I want to
[35:15] get to let us labor therefore to enter
[35:18] into that rest least any man fall after
[35:22] that same example of
[35:24] unb listen friends there is no no free R
[35:29] the kingdom of God is preached and every
[35:32] man press your way into it all those
[35:36] people who looking for free who looking
[35:40] to say pray for me pray for me pray for
[35:42] me and they would even pray for their
[35:43] own self they would even pray they are
[35:45] so selfish all they want is for them and
[35:49] if they go beyond them is their family
[35:51] that little bubble Circle that you had
[35:53] they don't even look to get enough that
[35:56] they could share for others
[35:58] enough prayer that they could pray
[35:59] Beyond themselves and pray for others
[36:02] the effectual fervent prayer of
[36:04] righteous man of it that much God want
[36:07] to work but God worked through prayer
[36:11] God worked through people with the right
[36:12] Spirit the right mind God gets sick of
[36:15] Saul Saul was on the throne Saul was
[36:17] anointed Saul was preaching Saul was
[36:20] right there but then God says you know
[36:23] what I found a better
[36:25] man be the man you want others to be
[36:29] lead let us lead each one of us by
[36:32] example let us bow our heads heavenly
[36:35] father I thank you tonight God the
[36:37] daughter of Zion the bride will must
[36:42] have to come into travail it cannot be
[36:45] some worshiping some are not it cannot
[36:47] be some praying some are not it cannot
[36:50] be some oppressing some are not it
[36:52] cannot be that the bride will press the
[36:55] bride will pray the bride will seek the
[36:58] bride with labor Jesus prophesied of
[37:01] Sorrow bird pains travail but joy when
[37:06] that manifestation come forth Lord you
[37:09] prophesied that the full word is to be
[37:12] borne into
[37:14] manifestation God if that is so then it
[37:17] has to have travail it has to have B
[37:21] pains it has to have the Deep sincerity

[37:35] it's not empty words we're not killing
[37:37] time we are connecting to the
[37:40] intelligence to the mind of God as to
[37:43] what is the next move bless them tonight
[37:45] as they get on in prayer in Jesus name I
[37:47] ask it amen and amen God bless you
[37:50] Saints and I trust tonight that these
[37:54] things that were shared to you would

[1:32:32] because God give it to us we're not
[1:32:34] claiming it because we feeling clish
[1:32:36] we're not claiming it because we have
[1:32:37] nothing else to do we claiming these
[1:32:39] things because God promised it that why
[1:32:41] Jesus died that we could possess these
[1:32:43] promises and we possess them little by
[1:32:46] little and we took a little tonight
[1:32:48] little by little we're going to possess
[1:32:49] that land and maintain that land so may
