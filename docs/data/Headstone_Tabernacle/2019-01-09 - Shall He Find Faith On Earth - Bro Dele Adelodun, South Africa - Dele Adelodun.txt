anointed singers to place the pride of Jesus Christ and brother Brennan I just read a quote now the day he says God heals by medicine he says God heals by music God heals by singing so you can be

of welcome so if there's anyone else that we haven't recognized we just want to say God bless you mine what can we say about this one but the radio we appreciate our brother obeyed oh my what a masterpiece god bless you my the manifestation of the original faith amen so what a blessing and he said so many inspired things it's such a masterpiece and I liked Whitney when he struck in octane and he said you know please God with rapture in faith and Enoch was the type of the bride and our inspiration is well the Son of man find faith when he returned I wonder if that faith is enrapturing faith well somebody's gonna answer the question somebody's gotta say well I have a revelation but the famous saying you just can't say you must have a revelation of what is that faith so you can't just say it's any faith because the Pentecostals they have faith so that will make them right many other religions a faith people that goes to a witch doctor they have faith but this faith we speak in my brother had to be restored had to be contained for had to be for dead to be bring back and God sent a prophet in this day to restore the faith now brother I believe that faith is on the earth tonight and I believe that faith is gonna be what what's gonna translate these bodies that we live in it's gonna change our 16 elements it's gonna bring you to a place like I spray the quote to a sphere where you never look before it's gonna be a faith that God will speak to you and Rama says it will be such a perfect faith that when you go to a hospital to pray for a sick person it's revealed to you what's gonna happen when you walk in there and when you walk in there brother the doctors is about to close the man's head and say he passed away he walking is their holy doctor it's been revealed to me that this man is gonna love he's gonna get up again why that's the fight Alleluia that's a faith that we're looking for and brother we trust in God that is going to happen in these meetings it's gonna happen to individuals you can have to pull you can have to draw you would have to say god that's me so thank you brother obeyed Oh God richly bless you brother Peter this morning I know a place in tonight so I just wanna read a play the Prophet prayed he says you also fishing with the riches of thy blessings may rest upon these people and may they go here from this day fall through the Holy Ghost may they love from year of the Lord fold with your spirit may they never forget that they contained in for the faith that was once the to the Saints hallelujah we pray God that the Holy Ghost will have the right of way every heart right now may fall like a rushing mighty wind sweep over the pulling cell if not alone I pray that you get victory Pope he says we are high priest offering up spiritual sacrifices the fruits of our looks and giving praise to God and may every believer now as a sacrifice to the high priests enter into the praises of God chhoti and glorifying God and praising his name I ask this in Jesus name Amen and the people praise God with all their hearts and give glory to God let's stand and give him a shout let's give him a praise the Prophet greatness and he said Lord make us a shout and into the praises of God what shall Tina and Chloe find God and praising his name he says you and made the people enter praising God with all their hearts the

Almighty father when I wander husk that you will come by once again greater than hotter times but in your home mana Lord to break forth the bread of life for us one time you did on the road to hemorrhage and it opens the eyes of your people's understanding the Bible said and their eyes were opened the eyes have always been opened physically speaking but there was a revelation there was an illumination that brings to them the realization of the presence of him in whom before this church Oh God they walk with him for about six hours and they never knew you was the one but when you broke the bread of life one breakin of their bread it turns the cost of that fellowship the people who taught the wait a damn week became light footage and they went back another six hours and they were not

themselves all that they have put in the sacrifices they have made lived on their part Lord may they never lose their reward remember them for good Lord and believers who are made sacrifices to come

dear father if there be other places believe us a fellowship in tonight your presence which we trust is with us let it be with them also that bore thee and us will give you glory at the end of all things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ our man [Applause] like to suggest we read our Bibles so after which we can take the comfort of our seats then we get acquainted and go into the message what I like for you to know that I'm happy to be in your midst - now if you have your Bibles with you please turn with me to the Book of Luke chapter 18 look we are going to take the first eight verses and they were going to read from the book of Malachi chapter 4 and revelation chapter 10 and pastor Robledo read two of the scriptures I had in mind and you see he came up in the thoughts and inspiration the Lord gave me so I think I would just continue from where I stopped hoping that the Lord will expand it more and more for us god bless you alright if you have your Bibles with you okay if you are there now say hey man and it's pick a parable unto them to this end that men ought always to pray and not to faint saying there was in a city judge which feared not God neither regarded man and there was a widow in the city in that city and she came unto him saying avenge me of mine adversary Bora and sorry and it would not for a while and after what is said within himself though I fear not God nor regard man yet because this Widow trouble at me I will avenge our lest by a continual coming she will remain and the Lord said hear what you on judge George said and shall not God avenge is on hill edge which cry day and night unto him though he be along with them I tell you that he will have vents them speedily nevertheless in other word in spite of this when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the head Amen all right keep that in mind as we turn to the book of Malachi chapter 4 they are all connected and we shall share their connection tonight Malachi chapter 4 does the last book of the Bible in the hotel cement I'd like to read verses five and six behold I will send you Elijah the Prophet before the coming of the Great and dreadful day of the Lord Anisha attend the art of the father's to the children and the art of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the earth with a curse amen finally revelations chapter 10 revelations chapter 10 I would like to read the first seven verses and I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and the rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it where the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he sat and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roar äj-- and when he had cried seven thunders attached their voices and when the seven thunders had hotter their voices I was about to write and I had a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them math and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth for ever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things which are daring that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets may the Lord had his blessings to the reading of his early work god bless you you may be seated as I remain standing cutting from one of your wonderful man of God a pastor judge imagine yeah I remember because when I come in yesterday we met at the airport and asked that I have him greets the convention so in case some of you will see him let him know I created the convention for him all right I want to thank the Lord very much for making it possible for me to be with the Saints in this part of the world at this time and it's such a privilege to see every one of you and I want to appreciate the kindness of a dear pastor for inviting me to come and be of service to coach people maybe somewhere along the line we can be of a blessing it's a pity I will not be able to wait true throughout the time that that before throughout the time of the convention that's what I'm trying to say we have to live back for home tomorrow as Elias records for some reasons amen all right and we still have to connect back to with another service shortly before the end of the year excuse me sir this is coming into my hairs now if you don't yeah it's too loud all right so but nevertheless I thank him for his understanding and for its acceptance that it's fine I can just be with you today and I continue my journey tomorrow so I want to appreciate him and I pray that lo blessing bless the family and bless the church the officers and everyone both in the background in the four on grounds that have been major supports to this program made a lot bless you all I I came into the country about a week ago what I've seen some of my friends to whom I must apologize after service I came in earlier because by the kindness of pastor Locke I don't know if he's in tonight Oh or father and give a generous vacation time for me and my wife he had wanted us to after the program which a while I said no there are something that's a big customary for me after the program so is that okay you can come Elia then blend into the program so it wasn't really for preaching that I came Elia so he said I would make sure you were less because I see that you've worked so well in the year and we wanted you to arrest so himself with the Brethren in the church and my good friend in his charge brother Quran they organized the invocation for us far away out of where we can preach we only brought out yesterday I want to appreciate them also for the kindness they sure made a lot less than I bring the kitchens of our pasta from Lagos is doing well by His grace and I'm sure be glad to know that his sins are doing very well here and usually I will bring my wife's greetings and my children's greetings but I can be excused of that of my wife because he's here with me and if you make yourself available she will greet all of you at the end of the service so she can pass our greetings what I bring that of our children who called us every day just to know how we are doing and told us greet the Brethren four-horse so in case you ever have a chance meeting with any of them let them know we pass their messages to you amen so we're so glad to be in your midst and we trust that the law bless our being together I want to appreciate other servants of God the servants of God who have spoken before me pastor chandler and we had a wonderful time looking at this subject from a beautiful simple perspective yesterday and it was such a faith challenging thing and they will pray that Allah will bless the labor of his servant over horse we thank God for this morning also the attempts and the expansion of his word to see faith in another dimension and we are grateful for His goodness and for the yielding of Pesaro blade o to the grace of God to bring the wonderful blessings to the bride of Jesus Christ I know God is an inexhaustible fountain and that we can never preach everything in the world we'll keep preaching till he comes amen so I prayed tonight one it's a blessing unto you and in advance I want to appreciate the servants of God I will come after because I know the law we use them also vary tremendously for horse may God bless you are and how I want to appreciate God's servants who are helping us to put the air in the Hoggins so the Hagen can make a beautiful sound they are more qualified than me I don't know of orders to stand before here but since it felt a lot of some of us they find the grace of God as men of God some came from far places some came from within the country just to be a support for those nations I pray that the Lord would bless your article that I pray the local SEO scholarship of us and bless everything you've done to support their missions churches who brought in their pastors who brought in their churches so many things you have done you know when a preacher comes to town is not expecting to see empty benches is expecting to preach to people and when God give us human beings like you it's such a privilege we can see that the Hall tonight is filling up so much until you may need to get expansion so we thank the Lord for what is done and we pray that you will be our blessing again this night so tonight if the Lord will be our help which I trust he will I want to speak on a subject just in line with the theme of the convention which I called shall he find faith on the earth amen you know when we read that scripture it was one asking by himself is that when the son of man comment it was referring to himself is there Willie fine faith so I can't say will I find faith because I am not the son of man amen so that's why I say shall he find faith on the head and for a subject we are looking at faith in this hour I want to trust God tonight to be very patient so I can read some from Brutus scriptures and the messages you pray along for me all right from the scripture that we have read in the Book of Luke chapter 18 Jesus our Lord was drawing a parable now the part that parable is not as important as the thought was bringing her there we found a king who was unjust who does not care for God and has no regard for man so you can't even use God to appeal to him you can't go to him and say even if you don't honor the name of President Ramaphosa I think there's a president here at least fear the name of God is God no regard for it so you can pray in Jesus name to this man so meaning that for you as a Christian it's absolutely impossible for any man to get anything from this guy it does whatever I will are you catch an edge but here was a woman who said however we're in loops whatever Isis manner whatever Isis orientation however we could if thought is me I would get what I want [Applause] so we can say that women as an unstoppable fate is that right the woman as a face that does not take no for an answer she seemed to have something that you cannot challenge she must get what she wants that is what I want us to get out of there and I tell you she got what she wanted from an impossible King all right all right okay now you will expect Jesus Christ himself to be impressed by his own parable but I tell you it wasn't impressed he appreciate what that woman could do but it wasn't still impressed as powerful as that fed wash that isn't the kind of faith that impressed Christ I'm sorry I'm not doubling your revival but follow me on a road we're going to a journey shortly before Jesus give this parable this parable was in Luke chapter 18 Jesus Christ has been impressed by a faith exploit one from the Jews and one from a Gentile in Luke chapter 5 some folks you know the Bible said when some people add that Jesus was in the house teaching the gospel my mind everybody and some friends for men for good friends and said this is an opportunity to procure Ilyn for our friend this their friend couldn't get off from the bed they said whether you able to get up or not if we have to bring you in wheelchair if we have to bring you on your bed or on a stretcher we catch you that mission Oh brethren when I go to that meeting there was no way for them to join the prayer line that crowd was too much but these guys were not going to buckle down they go to their friend and tell him you had going back like this what a night it takes we are gonna get you back alright it's gonna be all right and just like the woman in the parable they are fed knows no stoppage you can challenge it you can stop it the Bible said when they look for everywhere and they couldn't get their friends in they got the ladder and start walking on the roof they remove the roofs they remove the ceiling crazy guys what are you doing here our friend must go on better then when they move the rules and they lower their brother down here the Bible says Jesus saw their faith is it not wonderful I tell you is this is that tonight is still watch on that tonight but guess what by what is said in Luke 18 it doesn't seem to be too impressed still then can look chapter 7 some Israelites felt that this Centurion even though is a Gentile it was a Gentile is done so well for the economy and for their security and for their structure until even it's a favor we must avail him and they went to the Lord Jesus Christ and spoke on behalf of the Roman centurion the Roman centurion 7 was very sick and there's not much the specialist could do for him and they met a case they stood in the gap and they pleaded the cause of this man say he is worthy for whom deeds shall be done and the Bible said the Lord resolved and follow them when the Roman centurion heard that Jesus was coming excuse me it hasn't gotten to that extent it doesn't have to account you see this is the difference between the Jew and the Gentiles the gentle wants that touch they wants to be laid and upon I am NOT condemning in that gets me very well but at the Jews wanted - but the Gentiles don't wait for - because the channel of salvation never opens to them by hands lane the channel of salvation was open to them by spoken word while Peter yet spake the fate of the Gentiles rose to a level that great in South was excited and he has two purposes one protocol the protocol is repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost but God was too excited before those folks could do that if fill them with the Holy Ghost and is for the center tonight Alleluia right on your seat things can take place tonight because it's still the same God we live in another economy we are unbeliever can unbelief cannot stop us brother browser inspire insight spiritual food in due season we have access to our healings and to everything we have need of even when the doctors are failed just click the wedge and things will take place of sin hernias disappeared at the preaching of the gospel of sin without hands stretch out at the preaching of the gospel and that wasn't in the Bible - that wasn't even with the prophet in this time among us only believe all things are possible [Applause] the ten times don't wait they just came to eat and as such I won't sorry I want to agree to the bread and in UK who I was told they are making special meeting house of these tonight god bless them amen all right so it was picks and things take place you love him tonight so this was your intention of this Roman centurion then they look at himself if you me that governs hundred people I cannot give a command as little me and anybody will be checking they will be reasoning they will be examining it could amounts to treason once I give it the muscle page and it must be carried out them by that orientation he had a picture of who Christ was and as an infant Christ is much more is that some nobody to put you under my roof right there where you ask pick the wedge when Jesus saw that it turns to the people again in exitement I said he turning excitement maybe must have picked one of them and say I have never seen such a faith like this not even one in Israel so true now is someone with the Jews it's so another one with the Gentiles but they came in Luke 18 despite all that we are saying it will look like after a while the impression and excitement died down when I come when the Son of Man comes will he find faith we can tell him what you have seen some things are excited you so far you know what this man Jesus must be looking for something else all right let's travel with our Lord a beach in the message unbelievers not in the God the Prophet said in the last days what it's going to take to stand is a scripturally trend church on the line for there's going to be camel impersonations rise the Bibles are as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses so will this man of reprobate mind concerning the truth we realize that we're in that day to where anything can look so real but yet if it is of the scripture leave it alone no matter what kind of a sensation what results you find out of it the thing is even producing results the vindication of the true bride is that they finds themselves in the word don't say pardon resolved amen those are there who never came to light are getting resolved don't call it a fake result if you have a perfect understanding over ninety eight ones at the end time don't call it a fake result if you understand Matthew 13 it is the pure rain falling on the just and on the unjust the dynamics of the true church and the false charge is in the hand of one man listen to me church what you need to come to your full adoption it's in the hand of Christ aha wait for it what the other guys needs to come also to their full adoption when we talk about adoption don't view it on the positive alone the Prophet who touch the trail of the bride's touch the trail of the serpent are you here Church if I became pontiff maximus it started as a saying the same became a ditch it looks for unless but the devil knew the journey was going until he came to his crowning and there was DP one monk crowny he's going to be given the heart of a beast and that would be his full adoption because brother Brahms that thou be Satan incarnate in fullness so the other side is walking right according to the scriptures this other side must also be walking right according to the scriptures we are winding up to a level the field sons of God 1 sons of God will speak and heaven will back up their ways don't struggle with dynamics dynamics doesn't belong to the right side alone it goes both ways and there is only one thing that all life's can interact with this is the reason judas iscariot as to interact with jesus christ there is no way can be inspired to do his work without interacting with Christ there is no way Peter could manifest himself as a genuine sage without interacting with Christ the two of them need Christ because it is the same ring it is the same as you hand and it is the same as all hand when Judas was ready to fulfill his own column Jesus gave him his dynamics that which they'll do it too quickly nobody has understood it was only him he received that message it became anointed and the Bible said eros oh and went to betray Christ for those of you struggle with it does the scripture [Applause] you love him tonight so we are living at the time that things can look so real so there are so many things competing for your loyalty and anything that gets your loyalty get your faith anything that gets your fits get your love mm-hmm anything that gets your love gets you affection get your resources get your support and that is your worship right there the prophets that we are living at a tower that things can look so real but if it is of the scripture even though it's producing results when a time many people are plotting to come back as a messiah in these last days they are with me I have been told to be at liberty but I won't trample on my liberties as brother Robledo said if it is nothing that what I won't say bye if it is in the water I know you love the way even if it feels strange you take it you go home and look at it and the spirit of the law will take care of it people are purporting to be messiahs in the end time and they are coming to show us Masonic designs let me tell you it is beyond you it is beyond you as a faithful minister to be telling the secrets of hearts in this sense of brother bruh I'm bringing Masonic designs I repeat it is beyond hero and I said it's not a spliff of tongue coach me anytime I say it is beyond you you say but they are getting and what are they getting they get one a mr. hodda brother brand sir we are not of those who take a gift by margin of error that you pray for me God is cultivating his gift that is where your message masonic this salmon gift is not cultivated is a gift by which Messiah is known and the Messiah been totally identified in these last days we don't need no man to identify in again this is my brother Brown search your pastors will never show this gift they will never show it there will be only one in unhinge that gift is not even the gift of william brown it is the gift of God himself he shortage to the Samaritans is shortage to the Jews but he never showed to the Gentiles but he left us a promise according to Luke 17 title even does shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is been revealed and right here is the hell of that revelation so since it will not be here physically if acquitted that grace to a son of man the son of man is not the son of man hallelujah that was why when he came he testified I was not the one that appeared at Ohio River I was only the person Neera you are not fitting on me and man is what will fair why you are fitting on the unfailing body ward of the son of man if you live by that arrow you better repent if we take a scripturally trained Church to survive this hour all right all right that's just by the side where's he going you love him tonight all right let's enjoy it a lot a little bit here no matter what kind of a sensation what results you'll find out if it isn't the scripture stay away from it stay right with the word now you say you are getting the people won't believe you don't want them to be believers you don't want them to get excited I'm what topping the things of God the professor no I'm trying to get them to faith faith comment by hearing hearing decreed that might be in the harmonic but that's not the Bible faith comes by hearing the Word of God you see why is not impressed I'm coming faith coming back here in the world that's who that is what brings faith to hear the word of God so if it is not the Word of God is their faith but not the faith of this hour all right it's a now listen real close to this remark faith don't forget to get this now Phet is designed to see what God wills and once there is no knowledge that can do that faith alone is designed and given to the human race to find out what the will of God is and you take your feather to God and it doesn't focus with the word then leave it alone you got faith but you gotta run faith but when your god-given faithful cause you with the wedge you are directly in line and zeroed in oh my god across this our great hour that we live in faith designed to see what God wants how do you see it through the camera of his word is promise this is the full revelation of Jesus Christ now today you see faith is designed to do this sanphet today sees the same thing AFET of the church today should see the same program of God I want you to not miss this now that church today that's called of God will suddenly see the program of God ah because the program of God is written out here and the holy spirit by faith is the one who reads it and set it together then I'll call him man say is filled with the Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit say a certain way to do something in the Bible and this man comes around and say oh that is fanatism could the only spirit be real only spirit and deny his own word no it has to stay with the wedge [Music] [Applause] coming back to this fetch that excited Christ I want to get this very clearly when Jesus came the Prophet told us you may have different languages to describe his ministry but he told us that Christ preface ministry the first two phases II called accorded phases in some way II called the pools when they use the word God explained is a ministry to him truth fishing experiment so these are languages I believe the believers are familiar with the pools face that other now the first two phases thank you sir the first two phases or the first two pools brother Brahm called the Ilyn service now since it came to bring the Ministry of Christ wash it follows that the same way the Ministry of Christ rang that is the same way the Ministry of the son of man been revealed by a son of man will also work so this was why when he came the fastener was doing in India six then he brought the Salmons telling their secrets just to raise their faith brother Brahm said that was not healing itself but you can raise your faith to receive your request now brother Brown called these two phases or these two pools eCollege the Ilyn service and the immediate clear by the study of the scriptures and the message that you really don't need a great level of faith to enjoy those blessings I'm showing you why is not so impressed he taught us that with human fate what a proper column and fate because brother Bram taught levels of faith it's at with human faith you can enjoy any of those things that is where an unbeliever who has never believed and who will never believe who will never become our church remember if we came in here tonight and is just listening or you testify to him of the seven power of God to heal the sick to resident it can increase and receive his miracle what you need is your belief of only ease this is my brother Brahms and many believed him to be really la but they never said that he must be a lodge and he actually healed them and it did wonderful things but the danger is that human faith doesn't go far when he had a mighty convention and there was nothing to eat and he gave them bread and so forth the soy does an outstanding miracle because right there God was growing his wheat plant in his which cultivation is with maturing is with Avastin is with taking it to the mill processing is with making it flour and from flour bakery and baking it as bread and sharing it right in his and there it was running all the protocols it was too much for these people is that what kind of a man is this there's an ANA we have come to a conclusion we shall make him our king it's in your Bible and the Bible said Jesus withdrew from them these people contributed their money and chartered a boat or a ship to go and look for Jesus at the other side in other to install him as king don't you think they have faith but the Bible said look look look look these guys are not doing it because of his words huh they are doing it because of the miracles they are not doing it because of his thought pool they are doing it because of the benefits of the first and the second all this while Jesus has not begun to sound his message this was the face then are you enjoying the Lord that was the face he has began his message he has not began to teach his revelations he has not began to teach his doctrines so it so easy for them to pack it along whatever is saying them they are comfortable with it as long as they can enjoy all those wonderful miracles but let me tell you it will come to a point that those miracles will still be there what the depth to which the world will go they will reject everything and the guys who wanted to install him as king will be ready to crucify in as a sinner that is when it begins to enter into another fate dimension then when it began to sound is message all these guys who are excited who are so impressive by the logic of faith but they are pushed and they're pulling except you eat my flesh pasta repeat it again as I accept you eat my flesh and you drink my blood no life in excuse me pastor that's last date three weeks ago when you came to my house and my wife and I we serve you food can you remind us of the men who we served that's taking particular doesn't look like okay thank you Pastor I thought you will say we serve you the ribs of a human being isn't that exactly what you are preaching you want to turn us to cannabis except we heat your flesh good whoever hears such a thing as to stay with you no way today I pack my family and we live your church this were the same guys who wanted to make him King yesterday by the time Jesus looked back you know it was a gradual breaking of the church until it remains 70 Jesus didn't make much a simple it catch making it worse each day is one revelation or the other until another 70 or 50 something I don't know depletion had to take offense and left even that night service Jesus thought everybody had gun but by the time in look back is this awesome to have standing I want you also call what are you waiting for but I had faith yesterday they were pulling signs and wonders clouds and storms and reigns with this is my voice came now they couldn't absorb it fetch with that continuity's not a godly fate then Peter say excuse me pastor unto whom shall we go we have reached their final Bostock even if we don't understand it who was there here because as far as we are concerned you cannot be wrong what you say is always right the capstone revelation you must have is that this message cannot be wrong [Applause] sometimes it may come contrary to your personal judgment or to what you believe I think you know but dig into these blessings because it can never be run [Applause] that is the capstone revelation you must have that one will keep you standing that one will keep you consistent that will keep you faithful it isn't the multitude of what you can understand where it is how much you can absorb because Jesus can never be wrong [Applause] it was the push of Revelation that shuts Jesus - okay okay if that's the way you feel that you get more of it and they kept teaching them and they kept teaching them but these other guys they so went away and they never came back this is what the prophets and the message spiritual food in due season I'm trying to reach tonight please bear with me because faith cometh by hearing and here in the wedge in the message spiritual food in due season paragraph four is that I want you to get built up now in the only horror cools of God in the faith the faith of this hour isn't it interesting that Tommy husband and all these great men of God who talk outstandingly about the power in the hour they saw around the Prophet and yet they couldn't come into the message of the house is it an interesting lebron Robledo was saying I've had Lee ever seen any man even in a message who gave the level of compliments Tommy husband gave to brother Brown he said we preach Christ in lift Christ Christ walking the streets of Java's over some of those words were too powerful I'm Tommy Osmond said I'm conscious of what I'm saying but if it come into the fullness of the wedge no I want you to get huge up now in the only Oracles of God in the faith the fate of this hour the faith it's going to take my faith listen to your prophet then have ours in any age for this us to be rapture in faith so it's gonna be beyond something that will give you the benefits of the first pool it's gonna be beyond something that will give you the benefit of the second pool what you need to enjoy those sins I repeat is your belief of whom you think Jesus is [Applause] but the Prophet said it doesn't last is that human faith has never been enough it wasn't enough then and it will not be enough now this was when the book of Galatians chapter 1 or chapter 2 is that Paul never said I live by my faith in the Son of God but is that I live by the faith of the Son of God two different things did you catch that if I live by my faith in the Son of God what that means is that whatever I think whoever I think the son of God is that is what I'm living back and many lived by that and a still living by that that is what some of you think that message is just it's just an avenue for additional information you still appeal to all kind of books teachings and preaches is that after - a proper comparison if you are still at the gate of a lingering between two opinions at this hour I don't know where you will end up you are seat drying comparison postures we gotta wake up church amen because brother Bram said if we stop the church the children we go into the garbage cans if we find graceful present the beauty of this wedge Alleluia and move the offense into the realm of channels to see the total picture of this hour then we find out our Cloris on our switch this great revelation is [Applause] [Music] you love him tonight Oh may God help us George I'm trusting God to present this sense in the level of grace that you revealed it to me he said is gonna take my faith now I live by faith in the Son of God what I believe the Son of God is you see why Jesus in Matthew 13 or is this extensor whom do men say i the son of man harm some say you're Elijah is when they are saying that they were excited coating orders they never taught it will come back to them some say one of the prophets some say why Jeremiah maybe as I had a reserve all those Saints at the belief of people about Christ's own and watch they thought a wash are you college but it on to them okay let's leave what what as I say let's come on into you let me tell you when you now have to cut yourself you've gotta be careful all the guys have been excited cotton orders they all kept why you know why you cannot answer that anyhow brother brands have PETA dropped into the channel [Applause] you've got to drop into a channel where it is no longer you opinionated on who you think he is it's got to be a gift from God a revelation this was why when he met a declaration the Lord said flesh and blood has not revealed this to you it is beyond your human senses it is beyond your reasoning it is beyond your intellect hallelujah it is beyond your five senses you surrendered to the super sense your man faith was nothing of that and it is not enough now to come into this rage of the our brother Bram said you got no thoughts coming you must be ready to lose your mind how many are ready to lose their minds tonight you must be ready to give up your opinions you must be ready to give up your feelings you must be ready to give up this is the way I see it doesn't matter how you see what matters is our Christ himself and brother Prem said if you are honest and sincere and you will believe Christ will reveal his mind to you is that you God knows thoughts coming so let's drop our thoughts tonight let's drop our opinions tonight let's drop our feelings tonight let us take what he says if we don't read it from him plant a search each we don't accept revelation by impression we don't accept revelation bioassay in it forget about me as such it because Christ says so and how does Christ speaking these last days through the bad piece of his prophets [Applause] what must we do to do the works of God Jesus and such is that believed on him umeå sense only dissension these last days behold I sank behold eyes behold I only descends in such a messenger let us take what she says and we will be fine don't be uncomfortable your seats be fine you are a child of God he meant human fate wasn't enough then and it is not enough now it takes the very fate of the Son of God to drop into a man's heart so that it can receive the Lord of glory into the temple not made with hands this was a living faith I live by the faith of the Son of God Paul did not say that he lived by faith in the Son of God it was the faith of the Son of God that had given him life and kept him living in Christian victory if you want to live in victory asserts the faith of the son let every man who would be a lie let all these were beat that truth let's survey the name of the Lord Oh know what I am the message perfect fit is that all I've been doing is to receive it in a bracket is all right posture it starts from you believe in the healings and if you can believe all those first pose I can pull and you can come into the opening of the wedge which is the tadpole it's a vindication though you are the seed of God many enjoyed the fests they enjoyed the second it wasn't your money that took the profile on the world seven times it was the money of the pentacle stars Assemblies of God United Pentecostal one nest to nest Trina's five fulness Pascua and no squirrel it was their money not years but don't forget a preacher message present stage of my ministry and in that message he said I was a good guy when I came among you and God was using me to heal your sick and raise the dead oh my disciple because the face is changing I became a bad guy what do they hold against the prophets who they listen to me charge why do they hold against our prophet they had no problem with the healings this is where every testimony of the Pentecostal man if my brother Brahms centered along the exploits but when it comes to the opening of the wedge there's an e met miss takes they did not query the festival they did not question the second poll why are you challenging the taught poll why why are you challenging the topple this is the only offense of William Braja they will tell you India Bush if there was one man who started post-world War II whether it was William Brown they can tell you either where we team here out there where with him there I will read out there Los coches where is thought out this and that happen then we say with such a grace that you know we didn't even see it you have there why didn't you follow on so you see you will have stayed on with that but when it started coming into interpreting the wedge it made mistakes brother Brahms that you will call me a prophet and you will come back and said I make mistakes with the wedge I cannot put it together you we understand what you meant now you call me a prophet and you say I'm messing up with the wedge I can't understand and even tonight I can't understand and if you think that that problem is only how there I want to bring it home tonight for those of you who believe that since the opening of the word we should throw out all the messages from 46 to 62 you are a fanatic on one hinge and for those of you who touch that whatever is from 1946 to 62 is the only thing every other fan says they are after we don't care you are not a fanatic on the other hand both of you have got faith but you got a wrong one you won't offer simple understanding of life tells you that life can only survive when there is motion anytime life's become static that life is dead life does not come to a full stop until it has fully grown and call himself an adult are we here so don't get stopped if God if God never took the profits in 1962 is because it's got some muffins for you up to 1965 if you don't take the revelation that comes by the seals you cannot be a complete believer you see as a bridge all right I'm preaching one of the Dickens's I shouldn't play with the cannon I should as you shoot the fire I hope you realize what you're talking about if I start shooting man you find grace to accept a shot amen you love him tonight all right so if God continues amen we must follow the continuity of the wedge this is what the Prophet started a message it will appreciate many people and even said the Holy Ghost filled before the shoes were opened said dr. robots of the penty of the United Pentecostal a man filled with the Holy Ghost it wasn't switched talking those folks but then it came to a point I began to say if you are actually filled with the Holy Ghost you will follow the word to the storehouse [Music] amen oh I pretty low we have for tonight you will follow the world as it were moves that was when this seals became opened which I'm coming to you will appreciate the connection brother Bram said that Bible in my hands became what a new book I mean ever era is rather he said because many things the Lord revealed came better than my personal understanding they came better than my personal judgment meaning that our faith wasn't perfected until the opening of the seals so don't get talked follow the continuity of the word when you are able to follow the warning continuity it will solve our every question after all it is not you that is a state now that is my reputation that is a stake brother brown says say what I said I will be responsible I'm hiding under the beautiful cover tonight don't hold me responsible for nothing hold brother Brown responsible [Applause] you love him tonight so don't guess talk Church of the Living God our faith is on a journey it's been rests within a bracket and until we get to the end of the bracket we cannot stop because perfect faith we produce perfectly love for a perfectly ruptured church that is the word French all right let's go on in other to come to this feet I love the quotation brother obliterate we're sick or need to come back to eat we need the son of man that was why I said when the Son of Man returns shall we find faith when we may return do you think is talking of the rapture when it comes for rapture it doesn't need to find faith it's only coming for the faithful [Applause] are you yeah because there'll be no salmon at a time no Pridgen shortly before he comes let me tell you shortly before he comes in within the error of his coming conviction will have left the Spirit of the Lord will be withdrawn if that is only will be holy still he that is filthy will be filled this till the coming of Jesus does not give a second chance it'll rupture coming so it's not looking for faith for the rapture coming if he's to look for faith it's gonna be a son of this son of man coming when is it when we able to a place that we fit the rest and will trust the law to take over the rest for you you love him tonight now the Prophet can you please put on the picture for me that picture you and I agreed upon the brother praise the Lord pastor can i am i permitted all right there with me all right now brother Brahm started teaching us about the thoughts on the Son of Man amen and he said when God came in flesh in the body called Jesus it came to fulfill what Moses in Deuteronomy told Israel a prophet likened unto me amen and said that color was necessary because people need to be taught that we are right Alleluia and it is only a prophet who brings God to the people this prophet is not an ordinary prophet is a capital P prophet even when you read it in the book of Deuteronomy the scripture Rajat has a capital P profits for you to know that this would be a god profit but in terms of sonship ministry you will assume the identity of the Son of Man are you following so it came as the son of man to do what to bring the way of right so that a charge an alpha charge can be inaugurated that was why after the Son of man has done justice to his coming Pentecost took place is that right and the fire of the revelation of Pentecost continuing officiant age oh thank you my brother do I know how to use this okay the red button haha technology all right so the fire of that revival of the teaching of the son of man continued in Ephesus that was why you saw so much light and less of darkness because people we are living off of the Son of Man revival the Son of Man River produced the church in Jerusalem it produced the Apostles amen which included Apostle Paul was Patton with Ed opposed to Peter and the rest of them are you here and a touch that the church must be established on apostles and prophets foundation that is the only foundation that Christ will be the cornerstone contending for the faith which was once delivered so you could say the light continues in Smyrna but why the addends manner was not as awesome as were they had in Ephesus amen the first of darkness has begun to do what exact price on the charge human and gradually by the time they came to the top church age greater pressure so much so that falsehood was much more than the truth by the time they reach the far first church age it was almost in complete darkness because this were the era of persecutions people don't want to hear the truth as was once delivered and some great guys whom God will have even used for dispensation of purposes they buckled under pressure people like Polycarp he never came to the full realization of his sonship oh yes the prophets that you've got to reconcile yourself to each but Polly Chabad a bit of the leaning towards organization because it doesn't want to offend and they robbed him from coming to his full potential that's what the Prophet said let me tell you if you a son of God you a daughter of God if God has healed you nothing will jump up with your eternity but listen to me you can shortchange yourself you might never come to the full realization of your sonship because you fail to reconcile yourself to fullness is a quotation that was Upali kibosh if you get your glory you will see Saul King Saul you will see him there but you're not Jerusalem that was called the city of David brother Brahms I should have been called the city of Saul but because I failed to keep the total Word of God so this is a challenge not for your association but for you personally do a favor to your soul tonight sorry so by the time it reached the first Jay Church edge you can see that darkness has taken over it was the darkest at the foot age then God stepped in under sin again but this time it couldn't bring the fullness but it started the work of Reformation and that was why you see that the light portion expanded a bit though in significantly but it was more better than what it was in Thyatira you follow him then it got a bit more light and started becoming conspicuous in Philadelphia it was the age of open door bar by the time it came into laudation its recessed again you know it's research it was in this laudation age that the fullness of the wedge that whirlpool was born into manifestation for you know watch oh my when it came to this age let me say something here it doesn't matter when I stop or if I can go don't worry the Lord will take care now when it came to this age people realized laudation age started as a Pentecostal age and for the first time it was a true account it witnessed the baptism of the Holy Ghost as it was in this beginning are you hearing what the Prophet said what a baptism did was muttering study gifts back into the church now that baptism was a template to bring the fullness because the people who have been born now they needed to grow life can only survive when there is motion if life becomes taunted that is a still faith or death so which tells us the Pentecostals cannot be the end of the redemption plan but it's a vital plan in the redemption plan so the life that gave us justification under luta in saudis and gave us sanctification in Philadelphia as brought to us restoration of gift allowed this year that was the beginning of law decision H what you see that is not the end to life so allow the same age we have the true justification we have the true sanctification we have the true baptism but if a child is born shouldn't he grow he must grow so this child was born in 1906 by the time he came to 1950s is that a crime for something better than milk [Applause] are you yeah milk will suffice for a charge as some certain stage but when the Huggins grew better stronger than milk continuous giving of milk with stunts the growth of that child because now it needs to break bones in need some solid that was why in 1962 coming 20 1963 the cry for revival was so much fast and prayer we need a revival and God Hodge their cry watch the kadhi way crying for in 1963 God give it because the Prophet said what they are crying for is the unveiling of the 10 - that's what I said in the film him n so but when this forward was born into manifestation that church who was crying for Aviva pushed it away that was why the light recess so quietly God was pushed out of loud sa that was why in Revelation chapter 3 verse 14 to 21 a terrible sad picture was presented before loud this young age it was Philadelphia New Age Philadelphian age was the age of the open door but just an age after Philadelphia became the edge of a closed door and who did a shot out they shot up life they shot out Christ they shot up lights this is what the darkness began again darkness is absence of light that is absence of life this was like the diagnosis of God over loud this year is that the unrighteous naked miserable poor blind and on top of it and they know it not some little gems of God we are trapped in that darkness how are we gonna get him out brother Brahms all through the church edges God was identifying himself as a son of God working of the Holy Spirit except or to bring these people how he must return again as the son of man because it takes the prophetic ministry to place the word correctly and it takes them what place correctly to deliver the people you can see that it is not signs and wonders that truly delivers signs and wonders were still taking place in loud Asia even till now but you know what the professor is that the attach do you know what is that he said the a composite redemption - ugly brother is that so in recognizing your D on its message the Prophet brought this again and he searched everywhere they were crying before Reviver he said why were they crying Ben Christians they felt the pull of the hawa he said but they don't know what had already taken place in cities - they were crying instance the treaty were crying in 64 they were see crying we are as it was in 63 God and sadhya cry when the a cry was answered they pushed it out and in 1964 brother bran like the son of man who came the first time as to stand over Los Angeles and say oh Capernaum those tens of spiritual significance then brother Brahmaputra is that not in any way like my lord is that what i'ma say Oh Capernaum or Los Angeles uddaka let yourself at the name of hinges all the profit away ascend to you in the name of the Lord you have killed is happy Holi or how has come then is had not in any way like rice what is that I want to say this I believe that Pentecost allowed this year is come past Redemption brother bran said that is my opinion you can have yours I choose the prophets opinion because that is perfect fetch [Applause] this design not the Lord I may never read it in the Bible this is I not the Lord did you read it later answer me what God was pleased to make this design not a lot but of all scripture that you and I need to be thoroughly furnished unto good works so if the professor this is my opinion I stand by it if I don't stand by his own easy user we take inside she is come past Redemption and that has been some four five six years ago I'm quoting will umbra then I told the church remember Chicago what happened in Chicago for on the prophets of Baal again kadaj against these days Elijah and what was a showdown on man camel how long will you linger between two opinions if God be God's less of him if they'll be gone let's have him that God that unsoldered by fire it will be our God they touch they were drinking brother Brahim into a meeting they gathered and could contract the meeting to to shim him and they used the brother to send invitation and the brother brought the invitation brother Bram the president loves you they want fellowship brother Bramson really please take the mid was that before they came God came to brother bra anywhere you mentioned the name of an alleged you call God on the same and he told him of everything so when this brother came is a bread and lovely they want a fellowship TI's invitation problem look at the brother is a brother let's suppose I'm not able to make it to the fellowship can you represent me no no no no no no it is really ones brother Bram support up to many favors for you to in the past to this one for me son no it is you than the professor you know what you haven't invited me for fellowship you invited me for sure down but the co2 myself told me to come and I will be there and is that for you to know it was God who told me that plays you have rented books to have them meeting they will not give you brother Bram we have paid already brother Brahms I don't care if you have paid they will not give you that place then we give you this other place things of God don't do gas walk in mention the name of the place we don't believe in 20th century sorceress somebody's the audience is having a dick you are the one who invited them to come you told them if the a verdict that you come stomachache - oh come now they have come Europe you are outsmarting them if you have a crowd of 200 people you have those who have ethics if you're not the person mentioned a name tell us the address Alleluia is that we have paid for it is that I don't care and when you people gather daddy brother so-and-so we sit like this this repeat the coffee Shh this will be the call office time brother this brother brother when that day came the second three of the hotels suddenly remember somebody paid Elia is that so sorry but we'll make another arrangement and the arrangement they made was exactly where the Prophet said God said the Lord can never feel when they all came in they could resist sitting and appearing like he told them then when they invite the Prophet to come to their puppet that brother who brought invitation say excuse me I I gotta talk before brother Brahm talk it said you might not you may not believe him you might have a bad impression of him what I want you to know it knows what is talking about and is not afraid of any of you this was what he told me we wouldn't get that place this is where we'll be we are here brother he told me this is the color of your shirt that's what where we are it he told me it is the color of your time that's what you are wearing I think God was given the final message to date loud Sen Church Pentecost everybody who had that rule of repentance but they refused to repent because the Lord will slay them brother Brown came to the porridge you give all the things that we follow and he said if there's anybody with your Bible contrary opinion come here they couldn't come out till today they couldn't come out after service after the service they all went to the Prophet problem I don't know - wait is mine I will buy 70 of these tips and send to all my parishes as a matter of fact we all are coming to be baptized over again then in 1963 are you following me brother Brown brought the message indictment indictment is not judgment is to give the public report of an enquiry that we have done an investigation and you are implicated we shall now send you for trial so when the profit was written the reports to the church world he say you ministers in the camp gathered in Chicago this is about five or six years that you promised coming to be baptized over again is that but you haven't come because the price is too great you link too much on your organization's and it's not happy you to appreciate the truth is that but you know what you have done brother Brahm said the church was committed on pardonable same oh yes go read the message and document that's what it says it brought it blue six as their final sentence and you know I in the message unpardonable sin brother Bram said if you hear the truth and you acknowledge it is the truth but you refuse to work image dia is your pattern a person went acosta allowed this year acknowledged it was the truth they said they are coming to be baptized but they never came in the message indictment I repeat brother Brahm said they committed on pardonable same and from that day he said God will never save them as a denomination is that what the seeds of Karuma hinder will come out so there is not a lycra team charge it is written individual then in 1964 it pronounced them past the redemption in 1965 it pronounced them dead so what you have been seen since 1965 is a dead form of loud Asia and when something is that is such a rough name does why is not getting any better with them if you are still getting excited by that you have not come into the light but since they are dead anything death cannot obtain a true life there are people of God in lower this year who a carrier of God's it James you can call it James you can call it genes of God these ones are not going to stop dead there they want something better they wants to go on to higher ground the inheritance is not before Jordan they want to cross over Jordan in harder to cross over Jordan they need a ministry beyond the Ministry of the messenger to allow the C&H hey hey so that God prophet must return as the son of man again this is my brother Brahms edge in between his ministry as the Son of God in the church edges and his ministry as the son of David in the Millennium in between is to return a game as the son of man and I tell you he actually returns a man and when he returns he never found fate on earth if he found it wouldn't introduce is because I never found in other to bring back the faith you see if you started a message masterpiece this is where you will appreciate what the Prophet said he said I am the Alpha and the Omega is a party never said it was everything in between I'm an evil a recluse because everything in between is actually not God there were some dangerous teachings by even some messengers in the church edges this is why some people become confused whether to assess the prophets position that certain people the messenger of that age Martin Luther was a smoker is pocked pipe and was the messenger for his age swallow it is that the Jews are hungry Christ and they need to be as dominated and it was the messenger for the age after Pentecostal age of love Dacia they taught Trinity hmm the truth of pure goodness of one God and that in pyjamas age from that falseness falsehood entered a charge v wasn't pure again this was my brother Brown came in the message the bridge between the seven Church edges and the opening of the seven cells the bridge is too close loud Asia and to open another dispensation this was why when it came to do that he said what as the Lumbee doing for two thousand years sitting on the throne before it came again as the son of man through the ministry of his messenger he said it's been sitting there interceding for the ignorance of the people you see why the question as the messenger in that age that was why it was called the age of reformers the entire sermon church age is our only true prophets in this sense of whom the word of the Lord came to Paul and William Blaha Alpha and Omega but not everything in between [Music] are you following just not everything him between but for him to come again for perform a looter John Wesley and are the rest of those great men of the hope an age for them to make it the lamp stood interceding for the ignorant then the Prophet came back he said there is coming a time when to be sincere in wrong teaching you will be sincerely wrong he said Trinity came from the pit of hell is that you will ask me are all those two Rotarians of the ages would they go to hell he said no son this is why the land has been there interceding for that ignorance for one day in revelations five alleluia the lamb came and took the book to bring back prophetic ministry again the man to whom the what of the how attempt to Alleluia okay how many minutes I have twenty minutes all right praise the Lord let's see what we're doing to animal that's why the lamb came to bring back what to bring back the pure watch as it was again in the beginning to short the Alpha bride and they will make a bride will be the same judge watch this beautifully what you plant in the plant a season undergo some rottenness in the ground if you dig it off you are going to stand hopeless but allow the grounds to keep covering wait for the harvest exactly what you planted you will get in multiples but the process of getting names might be sawed off this is exactly God was following nature in order to get back is great variety so in between in common as son of God and Son of David he appeared again as the Son of Man brother bronzer to do us let's see what we do a son of man when he appeared he never found what is you love but it wasn't an hopeless case you know I there were people on Hajj who carried the likeness of what Abram had they don't as yet understood Judy her but there's great hope for them this is what the Son of Man was sent to bring them to that realization then we are locked in the gates of loud this year there were lot indicates of out of air and you watch they started crying for deliverance do you realize that because the conditions of that house wasn't okay for them it doesn't meet with their configuration but I'm so glad the people who were interested in for them went only to one person in that dream in that vision in their revelation everybody run - brother Brandi said delivered a it's a delivered delivered and brother Brahm was wondering how can I do it then a great stretch of a william brown and they rose up and said House of El give way and all those who could find the linkage with Abraham started tripping out what is the job of this son of man brother Bram said the germ of this son of man I won't be able to read much again now but I'll bring you the job of this son of man was Malachi for you ready he said didn't the Bible said the Son of Man will return and we can say yes the Bible says and brother Bram said and that is Malachi 4 and to make us appreciate what he meant is that when it begins to sound his message so what is the job of Malachi 4 is to turn the odds of the children back to the father's then the prophet expanded a scripture is that actually it is turning their heart back to the faith of the Apostolic Faith [Music] the hearts that have been let us trade the faith that has been taken away is to be restored through the Ministry of Malachi for I will dis restoration they tonin be done will it take us to a laboratory or it's surgery theater and perform a surgery and remove our hearts and put the ads of the Peter and the rest of them in there it's fit connected yet there'll be a surgery but not the physical one any such in Revelation 10 he said he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders they read it for us an opponent is aright then he said it is this divinely revealed mystery truth that achieves Malachi 4 it is revelation 10 that we accomplish Malachi for the surgery that we need is revelation 10 when we undergo the surgery we will come out as Malachi 4 is that clear to the hesitance amen so we need to know what those seals amen I will not shy her from it we need to know what those seals are he told us is such he will in Revelation 10 7 is that it will reveal the mysteries of the world seven thunders seven thunders which are the revelations contained where in the seven seals is our research is our probably knowledge today I love that so the revelations that the seals watch is what we need to have a ton of us so if we really want our hot stones let's look for that a revelation that is in horse once we know them and we start enjoying them and start living by them automatically something will be taking place is that what it was says we want our heart turned that's our destination when I was coming from Nigeria South Africa was my destination is that right but for me to get to South Africa and was imported South African here wish it will be wrong for me even if I enjoy all the comforts of the plane to think that that plane is South Africa if the heart wisdom let him up understand if you be wrong for me to take that plane as my South Africa but I need that plane if I must catch to South the Word of God is a certain sound amen do you agree with me on that if I sell my even if I'm in business class and I sit on my chair like a sofa or like a bear and start rolling on it am I in South Africa and if I think brother Kosmas that that is South Africa to me and we should change myself when I came into South Africa and injured my gauge I went to Durban I'm into a nice ball if I have time there are many other places to go to I won't get to those places on the plane the plane was landing in South Africa and I begin to enjoy the fullness that is what the seven thunders are something to land us in our destination this is our arrival we near the opening of the word to achieve this in our lives the Word of God has no confusion and said those who choose to be confused you think I don't believe in the virtues with all my heart you will never make it without this but it will take something from my tortoise in you brother Bram said where you are born again all this was automatically in you and he said as you fellowship along the ravine watch amen you don't need to Hajj anything distance without adding himself then we bring it to a full stature that is the face of the hour and we must not shy away from it you love in French okay let me read it to you let's say the content Oh glory to God at the end of the day we find out that we are saying the same thing we just need for that grace and revelation to come into its fullness you love him too Nagi hallelujah Church the tour pool is the opening of the sails and the content of what was opened is the seven thunders amen brother Brown said that is the job of that son of man is that it is in bringing the contacts that connect you that gives you an avenue to fellowship with your bridegroom that connects the body to the head my so the son of man was necessary to bring back their faith that we bet that will establish a relationship between God and is bright again because their marriage is on right now the wedding is on right now that is right to everyone of God the Bride of Christ say Amen the only thing we are waiting for is the shopper you love him French don't feel bad about her is the word of the Lord amen thought pool was the opening of them seven seals I want to read something here amen you love him let me see if I can get it within the little time I have left brother Brown searched the several seas was the mystery of the book is all right and he said until we concede those who watch those seven seals are sealed in we are only presuming them things so we lived by presumption until 1963 this is your prophet talking amen because it was in 1963 that the seals were opened and s aren t we see it we are presuming not denomination as a right to interpret it no man has a right it is the lamp odors that is the reason the thing is in such a scruple tonight they pick up a bluetooth option and the run of air to one side and say this is it another one picks another one doctrine run off to the side and said this is it and each one builds a denomination on diet many of us have come through that already until we got hundreds of denominations within the message again you know why you know why the problem is here jr. Jackson dream I'm gonna close on that give me time on day because this is important for you when the seals were to be opened God gives seven dreams if your recess is this the time and each of them was perfectly interpreted which became prophecy and prophetic now the one I'm talking of now is that of jr. Jackson he saw the Brethren surrounding a stone structure like a pyramid and it's a problem explaining things that are around it is that right let me let me read what she calls Dodge let's read what he calls that you love him tonight we enjoying the Lord in such and I stood there a little bit till the only spirit revealed it does junior Jackson telling him I said the entire Bible as much has been revealed to man truth justification sanctification despotism of the Holy Ghost the party seemed in Jesus name and no distance has been revealed but there is secrets that are eat inside because the Bible is sealed with seven seals and what's good here to find it that morning when those seven angels came down and blasted a heart and rocks flew everywhere seven angels you remember resinous on such amen it's a return back to Java's oval where you come from for the seven seas of the seven mysteries will be watch will be opened amen so while he was explaining things here the bread and we're rejoicing and the touch that was all of it but the Prophet took a crowbar and knock off the edge and means that was revealed something a precious white stone looking so innocent as if no light as fallen upon each brother bronzer I always thought those things were things outside the Bible it's about God corrected me and said they couldn't be out of the Bible because they'll be adding and subtracting they add things in the Bible upon whom nobody has understood then God told him go west and they went to sunset you are not the account of sunset seven angels came down they gave him watch they gave him the prophets the mystery of nothing less in the image and when they finish with him they told him to come back to Jeff to do what to preach the seven seals are you writers so weather sealed outside sealed inside is to preach the content of the seals hey man all right but you see well it went away brother Brahm said even Gina Jackson himself told him it looked off and before he came back as it is in every Exodus everybody got at the opinion of what they thought it was thought pool in challenge now this one fluid this this one fluid ah this one fluid is and the professor they made several denominations what Claude called us out of people brought themself back into it again but I will not remove the fact that in the midst of counterfeits there will be original let's see what a man who brought the son of man ministry told us those things are himself and now pity him for tonight you love him let's see what he caused all right that morning when those seven angels came down and blasted the earth and the rocks flew every way seven inches Trudy and said return back to Javas oval from where you come from for the seven seals of the seven mysteries will be watch opened yeah we are today understanding sir concede in a few days if God willing we will understand the correctness of marriage and divorce and all these things that got us opened every seal the mistress since the foundation of the world and we have been enjoying the presence of His blessings that is true this day this scripture is fulfilled [Music] [Applause] revelations contained in the seals these are the revelations today we know what a white ostrich is isn't it we can't deny that before this is open we call him Jesus Christ after the opening of the seals we saw him as a son before the opening of the seals were sent seventy weeks of Daniel remain seven years but the brands that have that the opening of the seals it became three and a half years before the opening of the seals eternal security was a question after the opening of the seals God took care of it if you think you understood seven serpent seed by what I taught in 1958 you need to check your understanding because it was running a trail that's why I'm stopping tonight until he brought it to even those who claim they believe the message in John chapter 8 certain Jews the Bible said and the Jews who believed on Jesus Christ I may never read out what Jesus told them is that if you continue god bless you sir if you continue if you are not stopped by the healing if you are not stopped by this if you continue to the opening you will be my disciples indeed even though the Bible said they believed on Jesus they had questions with him right there many have come this far believing but they couldn't go into the total revelation of the total let's get our church back to Genesis to Revelation company all them divinely revealed mystery truths of God by the time we teach the church the deeper things of God in the message running from the presence of the Lord but the Blum said every make-belief would be locked away and the Church of God will come to perfection last coach and I will stop last coach and I will stop there with me the professor we're not drinking and carry on is not sane but the whole thing is because of unbelief because if you believe and Jesus Christ to be son you are absolutely not going to do those things you believe that if that spawn of God does not commit sin you must believe the whole thing listen faith jesus said he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me that's everlasting life shall not come into condemnation was already passed from death to life do you believe that the truth yeah it lays there isn't nothing else that you can do only believe and if you believe them lead to immoral things we just drop off as you believe you become loved I'm coaching the Prophet are you here amen and love is God and you begin to wind yourself into Christ and these other things you don't have to quit doing they just quit themselves there's just not desire to do it they worship of him Porsche has no more conscience or desire for saying Amen when the worship eyes Porsche is when is born again his old nature dies out and the new nature sets in then it becomes a part of God and the body of Jesus the bride will be part of his body he was their watch and their bride will love to be the word what a dead to word add to what Luther's justification Westley Santa vacation when Dakota's baptism of the Holy Ghost restoration of the gift and all the rest of it it's got to be worth on top of word jam on top of Jam life on top of life to bring out the full stature of the plight of the Lord Jesus Christ this is not my watch this is his rage watch upon watch will bring out the full stature of the pride of the Lord Jesus Christ so let's go back to our temptations let's go home and be feasting on the wedge spiritual food in due season as you feast on it from Genesis to Revelation leave the rest regards the virtuous will count the masterpiece become the full adoption will come god bless you [Applause] unless the name of Jesus appreciate our pastor

presence we thank you for his anointing we thank you for his word and praise his wonderful name thank you Jesus my appreciator brother Kelly Sully Sully find faith on the earth and I believe that faith is already been revealed and I believe the pride as a secret to that faith because he said the six years didn't bother him but it was that seventh seal that he wanted all his life was that seven see you brother he says the six years one place he says they dead seals but is his under that seventh seal was a live seal was the seven thunders he says any connected to the faith that will change this body and translated brother from from corruption to incorruption from natural to supernatural so the six teams won't do that it already played out the pub seal is for the Jews the sixth seal is the tribulation but the Seventh Seal Alleluia that's a deal steal that the same is going to take us out of here because under there he said as seven things pagan one two three four five six seven and he said why he connected it to the thunders hallelujah he said this mighty angel came down all the earthly angels was finished and he said and the seven thunders of the world and throw their voices out he says is it something to let us know how to enter into that rapture in faith well knew your brother there's something under that seven seal that the pride is caught together revelation and I believe she has a revelation that the Son of Man was the only one listen man not even the prophet could reveal the Seventh Seal it was the mighty angel that flew in to him and the ninety priests the Seventh Seal brother it wasn't the prophet it was at my danger that came in him and what he spoke under that seven sail wasn't a prophet it was a son of man and he said the rapture the faith the bride needs lays under the Seventh Seal hallelujah it's not going home she'll it's a rapture in sailor he says that seven seal is like a rocket ship out five stars those five saucisson another five it keeps going on and on and on he says until you break into eternity so they tried to stop it here they tried to stop it here but everyone must and when they stopped Ian Paisley when they stopped papers there brother you cannot stop it then laughs cheering faith is up on the earth and the plan is a revelation is gonna take out of here come on people man this you deliveries here that's your laughter Issei oh that's the one that's got annoying Tina there's the one that anointed the Prophet oh I'm so happy brother and listen man I'm so glad brother Deli says our destination and I love that you see the message brother mem says Oh God he said you know I've been very Salas of the seeds that I planted for this body he says because the rain is coming he says I mean the real rain the chilling rain is coming brother first that we have is just a shower and a blessing year but brother Ivan the real rain that's gonna change these bodies Oh hallelujah and can I tell you something he didn't say that I sold but what I planted there's a big difference between sowing and planting so when you just throw the sheet and you throw it there and the birds come and some bees among rocks some is among Thrones but he said I planted come on please back please back to me brother please back when you plan something you make a hole you chop it in brother he put a seed in the ground I blood the seed for the body [Music] so this way we not roam don't interested me the poop don't interest me but what did he plan for the body come on we gonna find their brother they'ii planted the rapture in faith and when he comes back in body form that's why the seven thunders is so important is to show us how to go is to prepare us for rapture in faith it will create something in you so right now something is happening you're in the service of these changing you for something and I'm so glad he said this is our destination hallelujah brother you can run that way you can run there three but you gotta end up here because when you come to here you are called out of Latos here i don't lead us here into the eternal church age you call out into the pride age and that's where rapture in faith is lame brother so we are not in Latos here but we in the brain each brother branham put a special age here and that he says he called out the elect many cosel's to make up the headstone so thank God for that seven seal brother you don't move away from it don't let nothing pull you away from there that's a price Redemption seal brother and that's gonna take in the rapture don't you love him tonight don't you appreciate the prophet tonight don't appreciate about the telly tonight brother bringing it running it all the way and to climax with us rather that to me caps off for the message hallelujah god Bless You Man thank you for coming uh Oh hallelujah oh I feel anointed man to put it so late brother brother luck we'd like to just you know wife just raise your hands sister Dinah god bless you we glad to have you here tonight he's a close friend to brother Kelly and his brother daily explained he brought him down and send him on holiday and then we have brother Alex from LeBeau ah brother Alex are you

gain let's pray for him that God would keep virtue pack into his body because many took his time and he can go let me tell you but it's so fully so anointed here so much but we thank God that we have a message in this hour that is brought a revelation to the pride and that revelation lays within you and that grows so the seventh seal don't just end their promises eventually you break into eternity it will usher in the Millennium so we not just stop in here know we're moving all the way it will bring in a millennium it will bring in the eternal city it will carry on all the time he says until you break into eternity don't you wanna be there well let's stay under their anointing God richly bless you brother look [Applause] [Music] Amen Saints Maya could see people on fire and the watermelon is good but there is more amen but there will be a time where we wanna have to dismiss you can remain standing we don't have to dismiss there will be a time where we don't really have time you know a time where we won't have time it will be eternity aim and then now we'll be enjoying more of God of those five stars exploding exploding but all we still here you know there's management of time and things processes and so on that have to be followed amen and I hope Saints you do understand those things have to be done a prayer request here please pray for Asha wife in Kimberly you've ordered the
