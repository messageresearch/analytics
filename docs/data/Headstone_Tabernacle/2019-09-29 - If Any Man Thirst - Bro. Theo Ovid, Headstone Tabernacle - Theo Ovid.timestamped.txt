[1:02:05] feels so good in here this morning it's
[1:02:07] such a blessing to be here you know I
[1:02:10] feel like today's our specialty and it
[1:02:13] has nothing to do with me because he
[1:02:15] said we're the tools and trees are
[1:02:17] gathered together in his name there he
[1:02:20] is in the midst of life and you are here
[1:02:24] and God is here and I believe we'll be
[1:02:27] tremendously blessed this morning okay
[1:02:35] if you have your Bibles I'd like you to
[1:02:37] turn with me it's a simple scripture a
[1:02:39] simple thought I have some words that I
[1:02:43] hope could be put together by Holy
[1:02:46] Spirit this morning so we could be
[1:02:48] blessed and the scriptures Hebrews 11
[1:02:56] verse 6
[1:03:09] when you find it you could see him and
[1:03:13] he found it
[1:03:19] but without faith it is impossible to
[1:03:23] please him for he that cometh to God
[1:03:27] must believe that he is and he is a
[1:03:29] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:03:31] Him may bar heads over the FIR Oh
[1:03:42] Heavenly Father this morning we so
[1:03:46] grateful for your love Lord we so
[1:03:47] thankful for your grace and your mercy
[1:03:49] towards us slowly thank you for this
[1:03:51] opportunity to be gathered together in
[1:03:53] this way Lord Lord I pray that today be
[1:03:56] a special service lord I pray that we've
[1:03:58] come and expectation and our
[1:04:01] expectations will be met Lord Lord I
[1:04:03] pray that you strengthen the weak among
[1:04:05] us Lord Lord I pray that she would be
[1:04:08] with everyone that would hear this
[1:04:10] service lord over the internet connected
[1:04:13] to us right now who may see it
[1:04:14] afterwards Lord Lord this sick and
[1:04:16] afflicted a prayer to be healed
[1:04:18] I played don't try to be lifted up and
[1:04:21] raise up Lord Lord I pray those that
[1:04:23] have a doubtful and backslidden lore
[1:04:26] that would restore them Lord restore
[1:04:28] their joy Lord restore their peace Lord
[1:04:30] restore the strength and courage I pray
[1:04:33] that you be with me this morning Lord
[1:04:35] anoint my lips Lord Lord I pray that you
[1:04:37] take full control over everything that I
[1:04:39] would say everything that is spoken here
[1:04:41] this morning Lord and for the remaining
[1:04:43] of this service Lord Lord you know these
[1:04:45] thoughts on my heart Lord Lord you know
[1:04:46] the feeling that I have I pray that you
[1:04:48] will match it together like a puzzle
[1:04:49] Lord Lord that it will be a blessing it
[1:04:53] will not just be good words and and and
[1:04:55] and lower just was strong together Lord
[1:04:58] but it could be meaningful and sincere
[1:04:59] Lord I pray that we could act upon it
[1:05:01] Lord and take it to heart I prayed I
[1:05:03] could find good ground so to just be
[1:05:07] made into a manifestation Lord in Jesus
[1:05:10] name we pray amen give the Lord a hand
[1:05:14] of praise you may have your seats if you
[1:05:20] don't know by now this is probably most
[1:05:21] nervous I've ever been in my life but
[1:05:24] honest thank God anyhow and I want to
[1:05:27] thank but Oviatt for the faith that he
[1:05:29] has
[1:05:30] to ask me to share a couple words this
[1:05:33] morning so with that in mind I want to
[1:05:39] read a quote from the Prophet and it's
[1:05:45] not so much a title but the thought is
[1:05:48] this faith is a word but to have faith
[1:05:53] requires work it requires that we do
[1:05:56] something that we act right and if I
[1:06:01] were to have an inspiration it would be
[1:06:03] what is your excuse or there should be
[1:06:06] no excuses for lack of action right so I
[1:06:12] take my reference from a message is your
[1:06:16] life worthy of the gospel and in their
[1:06:22] reading from 37 he says when God sent
[1:06:28] Noah this event and Meeta we have of an
[1:06:31] escape for all the people who wanted to
[1:06:32] be saved but the people only laughed and
[1:06:34] scorned that Noah
[1:06:35] but God made the way but they had an
[1:06:38] excuse it wasn't according to their
[1:06:40] mother thinking it didn't it wasn't the
[1:06:44] way they wanted it so they made excuses
[1:06:46] in the day of Noah they made excuses in
[1:06:50] the day of Moses they made excuses an
[1:06:51] idea of Elijah
[1:06:52] they made excuses in the day of Christ
[1:06:54] and they make excuses today now if
[1:07:02] Israel 2,000 years ago would accept the
[1:07:05] invitation that He will give him there
[1:07:07] wouldn't be as they are today
[1:07:08] 2,000 years ago Israel tuned on the
[1:07:10] invitation to come to the wedding supper
[1:07:12] they turned it down and went into
[1:07:14] judgment but as Jesus said they stone
[1:07:16] and kill the prophets that was sent to
[1:07:18] them by making excuses now the excuses
[1:07:21] that he made in each day and said Jesus
[1:07:25] was trying to tell them that the excuses
[1:07:27] was what kill the prophets and what kill
[1:07:30] the righteous are come they accepted
[1:07:32] their Creed's that men had given them
[1:07:34] instead of taking the word of God and by
[1:07:37] doing so had
[1:07:38] would have got of no effect now in the
[1:07:42] day of Noah as we could recall God spoke
[1:07:45] to Noah he didn't speak to everybody he
[1:07:49] didn't speak to the people he spoke to
[1:07:50] Noah
[1:07:51] and give Noah a promise direct direct to
[1:07:54] Noah Noah this is what is required of
[1:07:56] you I want you to do XY and Z I want you
[1:07:59] to warn the people preach to the people
[1:08:00] build an ark I want you to use this type
[1:08:03] of wood these are the dimensions I want
[1:08:04] you to listen to me now Noah had to have
[1:08:07] a lot of faith because if you're reading
[1:08:09] the scripture rain had never fallen
[1:08:12] before so this was an unusual phenomenon
[1:08:15] this is something you had to believe
[1:08:16] that this is God speaking to you so I
[1:08:18] can act upon it amen in this case he had
[1:08:22] to be so convinced right because he may
[1:08:24] have been seen and thought of as a
[1:08:26] madman to be preaching year after year
[1:08:29] soon when after Silman week after week
[1:08:32] month after month that this thing that
[1:08:33] had never been done before was about to
[1:08:36] take place but further to that he has a
[1:08:39] requirement to build a boat now this was
[1:08:41] not cruise ship this was not yacht this
[1:08:43] was not pair up this was an efficient
[1:08:45] boot but it sealed a specific purpose
[1:08:47] and he had to listen to God's Word in
[1:08:49] order to bring that into fruition in
[1:08:52] doing so he took the most porous wood he
[1:08:57] could find gopher wood correct and he
[1:09:00] pictured inside and outside I'm not
[1:09:01] telling anything strange you know all
[1:09:02] these things already but it's just a
[1:09:04] bulletin in my heart so sharing it again
[1:09:07] adventures for such a time as this and
[1:09:09] somebody would be blessed now in this
[1:09:11] case when he did that that we might say
[1:09:15] that is a great manifestation of his
[1:09:16] faith not only is he saying it but he's
[1:09:18] doing something about it
[1:09:19] but there's something else that happened
[1:09:22] very significant even after he built the
[1:09:25] boats he had to take the animals inside
[1:09:28] so it's one thing to say I'm preaching
[1:09:30] here 1 year 2 year 3 snow manifestation
[1:09:33] yeah hundred yeah 115 might have feel
[1:09:37] tired at that point but you still after
[1:09:39] building the ark had to put the animals
[1:09:41] inside
[1:09:42] now the point of significance was when
[1:09:46] going to shut the door now at that point
[1:09:48] it makes the whole story and you whole
[1:09:51] journey almost irrelevant to the people
[1:09:54] because they had a hundred and twenty
[1:09:56] years to come into action to do
[1:09:59] something about the message he had heard
[1:10:01] to do something about these seeds that
[1:10:03] were planted in their hearts they had
[1:10:05] this window to come a hundred and twenty
[1:10:08] years to come along with the message
[1:10:10] that Noah had making no excuses and
[1:10:13] coming inside and God shut the door and
[1:10:15] they would have been fine brother
[1:10:17] branham said even left a window at the
[1:10:19] top in case no I wanted to change his
[1:10:22] mind in cases sure and wanted to change
[1:10:25] their mind in case they wanted to look
[1:10:27] back like like Lot's wife and walk back
[1:10:30] away now
[1:10:31] can you just imagine for a second I just
[1:10:33] want you to think in your mind right now
[1:10:34] if you were one of no one's children so
[1:10:38] you heard the message he preached it to
[1:10:41] you you worked alone you've seen what
[1:10:44] was happening you saw he built the boot
[1:10:46] you're probably assisted in building the
[1:10:48] boots you're reaching point where you
[1:10:50] saw the animals come in and for some
[1:10:52] reason you decided on that particular
[1:10:55] day you know what I feel so tired now I
[1:10:58] feel so disappointed that I have been
[1:11:01] here I have one of our monitor founding
[1:11:04] members when no one started his ministry
[1:11:06] 120 years ago I was there I listened to
[1:11:11] every message he had I perhaps
[1:11:13] fellowship with him we ate together but
[1:11:16] at this time I feeling so tired I think
[1:11:18] I stay at home I think I go in by my
[1:11:21] cousin I think I'm going to work I think
[1:11:23] I've got to do something else that
[1:11:24] listen to this is more important than
[1:11:28] sticking by faith to the promise that
[1:11:30] was left by God
[1:11:33] now you tell me how would you have felt
[1:11:35] when you looked at this door and you
[1:11:37] said Noah open unto me this door we
[1:11:41] could long time I am one of the ancient
[1:11:43] men I'm one of your good friends I am
[1:11:46] one of those who started the journey
[1:11:48] together with you in that case there's
[1:11:50] nothing Noah could do for you
[1:11:52] there's nothing you would of God could
[1:11:53] have done for you at that point no
[1:11:55] matter how much prayer and fast no
[1:11:57] matter how much you sacrifice your turn
[1:11:59] only part no matter what you tried at
[1:12:01] that point your opportunity was gone
[1:12:03] forever now in looking at the scripture
[1:12:07] I realized there there's different types
[1:12:10] of faith as you know you know brother
[1:12:11] Branham one time he referenced dingy
[1:12:13] feet logical fate when the lepers
[1:12:15] decided to go out I'm not going to stick
[1:12:18] on that one but I'm looking at there was
[1:12:21] a man who had a special need he needed
[1:12:24] to be healed anybody needs to be healed
[1:12:26] this morning he needed to be healed and
[1:12:30] there was a time in which the angel
[1:12:33] would come and strongly waters right
[1:12:38] still he waters up and he had no man to
[1:12:41] put him in for 38 years year after year
[1:12:45] he would come I could well imagine he
[1:12:49] wouldn't take a bus and reach he might
[1:12:53] have journeyed every year knowing that
[1:12:55] at this particular time the angel was
[1:12:58] gonna trouble the water no
[1:12:59] this to me is paradoxical because he
[1:13:02] could not go in himself yet he had faith
[1:13:06] knowing based on experience seeing year
[1:13:10] after year this is something I was
[1:13:13] seeking please he had sufficient faith
[1:13:15] to go yes after you can you imagine the
[1:13:17] year that Jesus walked by Jesus what
[1:13:20] wasn't walking by the pool you know he
[1:13:23] was working on another Street so far
[1:13:26] that that man was told Jesus can't hear
[1:13:29] you know when he said o son of David
[1:13:32] have mercy on me
[1:13:33] Jesus could mean he aim physically from
[1:13:36] where he was
[1:13:37] but he had such a faith they said and
[1:13:40] the scripture said he cried all the more
[1:13:43] so he cried as loud as he could as he
[1:13:47] physically could because he was
[1:13:48] desperate enough and had sufficient
[1:13:50] faith to know that God keeps his
[1:13:53] promises all the time in this case can
[1:13:56] you just imagine I want you imagine with
[1:13:58] me for a second
[1:13:59] if this is the year he decided you know
[1:14:03] what is a long time I do in this year
[1:14:05] perhaps I need to try something else
[1:14:07] perhaps I need to go somewhere else
[1:14:10] perhaps I need to stay home and pray
[1:14:12] perhaps I need to stay and fast I need
[1:14:15] to do something different I need to do
[1:14:17] something else and he after 37 years
[1:14:20] decided to stay home
[1:14:22] oh he decided you know what does every
[1:14:25] year coming and every year hi again true
[1:14:27] so you know what I just go in half way
[1:14:29] at least they will say a pass through no
[1:14:32] the first person to enter is a person
[1:14:35] that would get the blessing where they
[1:14:38] have to be healed delivered sealed
[1:14:40] whatever it was was the first right so
[1:14:44] that that's the trouble with a lot of us
[1:14:46] today we know the promises we know what
[1:14:50] the Prophet said we know what he would
[1:14:52] said and we say we have faith and I
[1:14:55] probably wouldn't get to it now but Vera
[1:14:56] Bram said you know 99% of people say
[1:15:00] they have people what you have is hope
[1:15:02] the hope that it will be healed hope
[1:15:06] that they'll be delivered they'll hold
[1:15:07] out that they'll be set free
[1:15:09] so they come sometimes within the
[1:15:11] presence of the Lord where anything is
[1:15:13] possible and the miraculous could take
[1:15:15] place and still defeat fail a little bit
[1:15:19] because they wonder if today is really
[1:15:22] my day I want to give you one more
[1:15:23] example before I close and it's the way
[1:15:27] that Jesus operates you know we see many
[1:15:29] many examples throughout the Bible and
[1:15:31] one of the things he does he gives us
[1:15:33] examples and tests and trials and
[1:15:36] challenges and training because he's
[1:15:38] leading us to something or he want us to
[1:15:41] pass a particular test so
[1:15:42] disciples one time he stood with their
[1:15:45] money said you know what Philip these
[1:15:47] pictures of water and the water was
[1:15:50] turned into wine well now he said what
[1:15:53] do you have to eat five loaves to fish
[1:15:55] sprint blessed it give it now all the
[1:15:59] while they were walking with him they
[1:16:01] saw miracles they sought the miraculous
[1:16:04] take place Peter when he saw Jesus on
[1:16:06] the water he said if you bit me come out
[1:16:08] come you know what I walk with you long
[1:16:11] enough to know that this is not a test
[1:16:14] this is reality and I have faith enough
[1:16:16] to respond to your call and if you were
[1:16:18] to tell me come he could have tried to
[1:16:20] convey he said if you bid me come I will
[1:16:22] come and he went out so they had enough
[1:16:25] examples and if enough experience to
[1:16:28] believe that if God seemed to do this do
[1:16:31] it right so Jesus he came to that man he
[1:16:37] said listen I want you to hurry in
[1:16:39] Jerusalem until you be endued apart even
[1:16:44] tell tell'em I want you go to a
[1:16:46] convention or want you to go and pray
[1:16:50] and fast for three days of our weekend
[1:16:52] no you see I want you to Terry Terry is
[1:16:55] not a quick thing and I'll given it that
[1:16:58] definition now but but it's not a
[1:17:00] touch-and-go thing you don't sorry for a
[1:17:03] minute and Terry for five minutes
[1:17:05] Terry suggests that you have a strong
[1:17:09] desire to be patient and we'd pull in
[1:17:11] fast to the promise that was given to
[1:17:13] you and in that case the scripture would
[1:17:18] say that they tarried and after 50 days
[1:17:23] so can you imagine the instruction was
[1:17:26] to Terry and after one month you say hey
[1:17:30] we're going on brothers I understand he
[1:17:35] - let's hurry and we we appreciate your
[1:17:38] ministry but we have notes that could've
[1:17:41] happened you know but can you imagine on
[1:17:44] the 40th year Terry and I realize like
[1:17:48] there was a man one time Jesus could be
[1:17:50] parable you say there was a king who
[1:17:52] a son about to be married and he sent
[1:17:55] some invitations out I do it me and he
[1:17:58] said he give the invitations and one by
[1:18:00] one one of them said hey you know what
[1:18:02] here my excuse is a good one I bought a
[1:18:05] new piece of land overlooking the ocean
[1:18:08] right and I really want to see what
[1:18:10] happening with it because it had a storm
[1:18:12] watch last week so I want to make sure
[1:18:13] it's still in order right now as his
[1:18:15] excuse another one say you know I bought
[1:18:17] some livestock some capital and stuff
[1:18:19] and from what I hear the economy oil not
[1:18:21] working too good at this stage it look
[1:18:23] like somebody else they can you in fact
[1:18:24] finery so I want to diversify and invest
[1:18:27] in capital I want to check it out to
[1:18:28] make sure I don't know I know everybody
[1:18:31] seems have excuses and you know what
[1:18:32] Jesus said you say the king will not
[1:18:34] have his wedding supper empty he knows
[1:18:39] that if you don't accept it he will find
[1:18:43] people willing unable to accept it the
[1:18:47] invitation is to whosoever will he can
[1:18:51] take the drunkard the backslidden
[1:18:54] the smoker the adulterer before Nikita
[1:18:58] whoever he choose because he wants his
[1:19:01] table to be filled so in that time they
[1:19:04] made excuses and what it was unable to
[1:19:07] be real recipients of the blessings of
[1:19:11] God so coming back to the Upper Room
[1:19:15] can you imagine after month on almost
[1:19:18] half your terrian you pray in your
[1:19:21] fasting is singing and worshiping you're
[1:19:23] just thanking God very promise because
[1:19:26] Jesus left such a awesome promise and
[1:19:28] you saw and he passed what he was able
[1:19:30] to do so you believe in his word and you
[1:19:32] believe in his promise yet you feel
[1:19:34] weary and tired you feel like a disco
[1:19:38] I feel halfway you just want to stroll
[1:19:41] into church any old time you want to
[1:19:44] stroll into church annual attitude no
[1:19:46] matter what song you sing in half we you
[1:19:49] want to dress and you allow no respects
[1:19:52] you want to answer back the deacons and
[1:19:55] the ushers I want to operate your own
[1:19:57] way because you feel oh gosh you know
[1:19:59] how all
[1:20:00] how long I hear you can't tell me
[1:20:03] anything and it becomes so average it
[1:20:06] becomes so normal you show up only on a
[1:20:08] Sunday morning Wednesday night it just
[1:20:11] seems so far but you could make it on
[1:20:13] Sun Leia you could make it to cricket
[1:20:15] down in the state stadium wherever it is
[1:20:17] you could make it to the cousin who
[1:20:19] having to get together in Tobago or
[1:20:21] wherever you want to go
[1:20:23] it just shows priority right so the same
[1:20:27] way I know we don't like to say it like
[1:20:29] that we don't like to admit it like like
[1:20:30] that but really what you're really doing
[1:20:33] is is making other things priority and
[1:20:36] in plain and simple terms what you're
[1:20:38] doing is making excuses now for minute I
[1:20:41] also want you to think if God were to
[1:20:43] see in secret that this morning I want
[1:20:50] to trouble the water
[1:20:51] right and you see those people who come
[1:20:56] out this morning under expectation to be
[1:20:59] filled and healed and delivered he want
[1:21:02] to grant them the desire of their heart
[1:21:04] what would your attitude be getting
[1:21:07] ready this morning how the John's will
[1:21:11] you come to service what will be
[1:21:14] probably saw in your heart
[1:21:16] we heard better Raymond Thompson a few
[1:21:18] weeks ago preacher we should enter the
[1:21:20] sanctuary and we should come to show how
[1:21:22] much more those of us who he promises
[1:21:26] and know he promises like like Noah year
[1:21:28] after year months after months week
[1:21:31] after week day after day we know what I
[1:21:34] said we know what is promised we know he
[1:21:36] promised a revival and we know the
[1:21:38] preacher can't bring a revival but we
[1:21:40] not initiate and revival at whom we not
[1:21:44] initiate and revival in the car where we
[1:21:47] are we still satisfy to quarrel with our
[1:21:50] brother and sister and to get back Sun
[1:21:52] upset we're still unforgiving we still
[1:21:56] hall & oates know what would your
[1:22:00] attitude be if you realize that right
[1:22:02] now within the next five minutes he will
[1:22:05] grant any desire of your heart
[1:22:08] how much more desperate you will become
[1:22:10] knowing that it didn't matter what you
[1:22:12] did last night or watching it last week
[1:22:14] or last month's but you delimit you now
[1:22:17] to be and you can receive anything you
[1:22:19] want today that's what faith does but
[1:22:27] faith is just a world if we don't put it
[1:22:29] into action if we don't act upon it and
[1:22:32] if he don't see like the scripture said
[1:22:34] he is a rewarder of them that diligently
[1:22:36] seek Him
[1:22:38] so when it's harried in the upper room
[1:22:40] they were diligently seeking him seeking
[1:22:43] his space seeking his voice not seeking
[1:22:46] his kingdom
[1:22:47] you know just recently has talked
[1:22:48] interpret and he say you know God give a
[1:22:50] solution for everything you say if you
[1:22:53] want a new car what you have to do if
[1:22:56] you want misalign you want a new house
[1:22:58] you want to raise the pay on the
[1:22:59] promotion you say seek ye first the
[1:23:02] kingdom of God and His righteousness and
[1:23:07] all things all things shall be added so
[1:23:15] what that tells me is when I decide and
[1:23:18] we heard a preacher of a million times
[1:23:21] I'm gonna stay home this week oh no
[1:23:24] because I have an exam coming up I'm
[1:23:28] going to stay home this week because and
[1:23:30] you City because I want you to think for
[1:23:32] a minute I told her brother recently and
[1:23:34] he laughs and I said I say I didn't see
[1:23:36] a intentional you say boy and you
[1:23:40] started and say hold up don't tell me
[1:23:42] the excuse don't get me the excuse you
[1:23:45] have to tell me tell at the divorce tell
[1:23:48] me boss
[1:23:49] I was flannery and I don't know and a
[1:23:53] rich woman I thought whatever the
[1:23:55] excuses you tell him and if it's good
[1:23:58] enough for him it's good enough for me
[1:24:00] you don't want to tell me you're with me
[1:24:04] that's the way God operates he rewards
[1:24:08] them that diligently seek Him
[1:24:10] you see he knows the thoughts and
[1:24:11] intents of your
[1:24:13] so he knows if you want to be there you
[1:24:15] will be there yeah let me give you your
[1:24:17] last one before I go because I'm making
[1:24:19] myself in trouble you know I often say
[1:24:22] we do what we want people do what they
[1:24:26] want
[1:24:27] if I were to tell you here's what going
[1:24:29] on I want two persons a buying a plane

[1:25:15] think fast second that's a trip that
[1:25:18] will come and go that's a trip here you
[1:25:21] might enjoy these sites but it's
[1:25:22] temporary
[1:25:23] imagine you have a father who is king
[1:25:28] that makes me royalty right that makes
[1:25:32] you royalty right so your father who is
[1:25:35] king say listen hear what I send these
[1:25:39] instructions because I want you to
[1:25:41] qualify to pass my tests you know I
[1:25:43] don't think any father wants a children
[1:25:45] to fail so you send them to school Bible
[1:25:48] say under tutors and governors so they
[1:25:51] can be prepared to graduate right so God
[1:25:54] wants you to be prepared to graduate
[1:25:56] because how could we sit and say you
[1:25:58] know we want to have Raptor and fate we
[1:26:00] want to go to the rapture and the
[1:26:02] prophetess but but you could barely a
[1:26:04] feed for divine healing remember you
[1:26:07] want your pass so in order to pass you
[1:26:10] have to give your steps

[1:26:14] Goliath was coming
[1:26:16] here with me he go just drop it on your
[1:26:19] chakra and oh now I feel like Gideon
[1:26:22] here No
[1:26:23] right no pun intended but I feel like
[1:26:25] Gideon you know even when he came to
[1:26:27] Korea and I said listen I'm the least
[1:26:29] among my family some of my tribe but
[1:26:32] here what if you be God meet the sweat
[1:26:35] if you be God knoweth no adhirata but
[1:26:38] adventure dies by chance of coincidence
[1:26:41] make a dragon and it will and because
[1:26:43] he's see he could believe that when God
[1:26:46] say and was just over 300 just go at 300
[1:26:50] I have the victory already right
[1:26:52] so that does do where we are when we
[1:26:54] look back and we see Vietnam that Isis I
[1:26:57] heard you right two boys because she
[1:27:00] said the right thing okay
[1:27:04] look look fish epic life wait a minute
[1:27:10] these are examples before us we know
[1:27:14] that was a real test these are examples
[1:27:17] before us because the real test is
[1:27:20] coming I am here to say the real test is
[1:27:23] coming and the real testers are words as
[1:27:26] a fit test to see if after 120 years if
[1:27:30] after 38 years if after 15 years just
[1:27:34] still believed enough to have the
[1:27:36] attitude and desperation and urgency to
[1:27:39] stick to the promise without making
[1:27:42] excuses and then you will see the Word
[1:27:44] of God manifested in your life
[1:27:46] that's how success and victory and

[1:30:51] where is thy God sin John 7 verse 37 in
[1:30:58] the last day that great day of the feast
[1:30:59] Jesus stood and cried saying if any man
[1:31:02] thirst let him come unto me and drink he
[1:31:05] that believeth on me as the scripture
[1:31:07] has said out of his belly shall flow
[1:31:09] rivers of living water but this spake he
[1:31:12] of the Spirit which they should believe
[1:31:14] on him should receive for the Holy Ghost
[1:31:16] was not yet given because Jesus was not
[1:31:19] yet glorified revelation 22:17 and the
[1:31:24] spirit and the bride say come let him

[1:31:45] of the way and their presence coming on
[1:31:46] your world and minister to your people
[1:31:48] in Jesus I ask it amen you may be seated
[1:31:52] praise God other title If any man test
[1:31:57] I have a question for you our utility
[1:32:01] well Julie Williams called me after a
[1:32:04] service last week and he was trying to
[1:32:07] remind me of a dream that he had his
[1:32:11] dream I think was over 30 years ago and
[1:32:14] I turn right to me and that season was
[1:32:17] Pope must been preached and in the dream
[1:32:20] there was two passenger buses that was
[1:32:23] about to leave Cairo so this is about in
[1:32:26] the early eighties also in between
[1:32:28] decreases for at that time we were
[1:32:31] worship in at that location and there
[1:32:32] was a serious feast bus conductor this
[1:32:34] is a dream now more serious than than
[1:32:36] angry who came in checking for tickets
[1:32:38] this board about her solemnity among the
[1:32:42] passengers so at that time the
[1:32:43] inspiration was fishing buddy token and
[1:32:45] this Ana dream was two buses and the
[1:32:47] conductor was looking for tickets and
[1:32:49] this brought about a solemnity among the
[1:32:52] passengers again I remember the
[1:32:53] seriousness of his expression I can't
[1:32:55] remember the passengers of tickets or
[1:32:57] not I myself had something in my hand
[1:32:59] but I was not sure it was a ticket a
[1:33:02] sister who was closely because by
[1:33:04] examine exclaimed to me that I had it
[1:33:07] when she saw what was in my hand however
[1:33:09] when the conductor reached to my seat
[1:33:12] still serious-looking he told me tell
[1:33:14] ability on this scripture who shall
[1:33:16] ascend into the hill of the Lord or who
[1:33:19] shall stand in his holy place he'd have
[1:33:21] had clean hands and a pure heart who
[1:33:23] hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity
[1:33:25] sworn deceitfully tell him that and he
[1:33:28] was telling me don't forget that I will
[1:33:30] never forget the seriousness of that
[1:33:32] conductor and also does some Lemna t
[1:33:34] upon the people it reminds of what a
[1:33:37] very poor testimony of witness in the
[1:33:38] image of the Lord when his father woke
[1:33:40] him up to see which left an indelible
[1:33:42] mark on his life that's the dream but
[1:33:44] over thus best I can remember may God
[1:33:46] bless you and so on like that isn't that
[1:33:48] something
[1:33:50] and there was no stranger I got a
[1:33:53] message who shall ascend unto the hill
[1:33:54] of the Lord and it's it's really
[1:33:56] something it's my book like to some
[1:33:59] people but really I'm surely it didn't
[1:34:01] sink we'll go to church maybe who would
[1:34:05] see the need that they have to go and
[1:34:06] meet the Lord and climb and be blessed
[1:34:09] and be cluded and be anointed amen if
[1:34:12] any man tis okay let's go
[1:34:15] Hosea 4:6 says my people are destroyed
[1:34:17] for lack of knowledge because there was
[1:34:20] rejected knowledge I will also reject
[1:34:22] thee and thou shalt be no priest to me
[1:34:24] seeing thou hast forgotten the law of
[1:34:27] thy God I will also forget that children
[1:34:31] Deuteronomy 29:29
[1:34:33] the secret thing belongs and the law
[1:34:34] over God but those things that are
[1:34:36] revealed belonging to us and taught
[1:34:38] children that we may do the words of his
[1:34:41] law forever knowledge is important
[1:34:44] knowledge is vital
[1:34:46] now the job you have to have some
[1:34:48] knowledge that is why the employer
[1:34:50] lawyers are lawyers because you are
[1:34:52] paying them for the knowledge that they
[1:34:54] have if you know what they know then you
[1:34:56] could t try your own case you could
[1:34:58] manage your own Keys so what a lawyer
[1:35:00] hire a lawyer you hire them because of
[1:35:02] the knowledge that they have and before
[1:35:05] you know about God you have to get the
[1:35:06] knowledge of God you have to know what
[1:35:08] he is what he stands for what he unfolds
[1:35:11] so knowledge is important it's not right
[1:35:14] to be successful you have to have
[1:35:16] knowledge hallelujah a fool can have
[1:35:19] much success because the fool doesn't
[1:35:20] know and the problem with people that
[1:35:22] they they don't know what they don't
[1:35:24] know so a lot of people know but they
[1:35:26] don't know what they don't know and what
[1:35:28] you don't know is more important than
[1:35:29] you know so you need to know and you
[1:35:32] want to know so Jesus money came he say
[1:35:34] learn of me and always you have to be
[1:35:37] taught because you don't know you have
[1:35:39] heard in times past it the enemy but I
[1:35:42] see unto you
[1:35:43] I'm bringing a new knowledge to you I'm
[1:35:45] bringing a new understanding to you and
[1:35:47] bringing a new word to you you need to
[1:35:49] know this because you don't know this oh
[1:35:51] you're thirteen times past you are 13
[1:35:54] times past but I say unto you so he
[1:35:57] brought the I see unto you
[1:35:59] and the I see unto you is what you don't
[1:36:00] know because what you have birth is what
[1:36:03] we had in times past but you meet or
[1:36:06] know what do you say now or committing
[1:36:08] the Lord appraised offering hallelujah
[1:36:11] glory to God Amen so when people don't
[1:36:14] study and they don't learn and they
[1:36:18] don't grow because the learn is the
[1:36:19] really girl The Crow is to learn they
[1:36:22] get and I want to think about it
[1:36:24] something like that knowledge knowledge
[1:36:27] based upon ignorance knowledge based
[1:36:29] upon ESC only pink and what people feel
[1:36:32] it's a level of ignorance on the subject
[1:36:36] or the topic or what you're talking
[1:36:37] about
[1:36:38] so then people who are married talking
[1:36:42] to people not married for advice and
[1:36:44] counsel the personal marriage can only
[1:36:46] get that knowledge they don't have they
[1:36:48] do have the experience they'll have the
[1:36:50] qualification somebody who have doing my
[1:36:53] bank account when they give advice and
[1:36:54] money they don't even buy bank I didn't
[1:37:00] have a credit cat they know he has a
[1:37:02] comp open but it cannot tell you about
[1:37:04] money a priesthood on Mary when I give
[1:37:07] concerts on married people what kind of
[1:37:10] knowledge the given it's not the correct
[1:37:12] knowledge so you have to have the
[1:37:14] channel to bring the right knowledge or
[1:37:16] right information or glory love god
[1:37:19] somebody like gossip they like they
[1:37:21] gossip and and Nibiru love the gossip so
[1:37:25] if you like to hear the snippets have
[1:37:26] always are people written to offload

[1:37:30] press back rivers and the whole thing
[1:37:32] just raise up like that and they drop it
[1:37:34] on you because the Lord would stuff

[1:37:43] word because I forget the word you're
[1:37:46] saying one that go off Lord take that
[1:37:49] dump somewhere else
[1:37:51] that gossip somewhere else get that all
[1:37:54] talks somewhere else
[1:37:55] Oh glory to God hallelujah praise God no
[1:37:59] there's a reason I'm saying this little
[1:38:01] I'm gonna say mr. signature of thing
[1:38:05] y'know peanut not shootin admit there's
[1:38:06] a reason for this you know becoming
[1:38:08] under something you wanna completely
[1:38:10] foolish visions or Chloe Dakota you will
[1:38:13] be a foolish person will not come back
[1:38:14] to them because they don't know what
[1:38:16] they don't know
[1:38:17] before this presents a foolish and I
[1:38:19] foolish they think they're smart they
[1:38:26] thought they were all right yes the
[1:38:29] thing the smart but they know is it not
[1:38:37] hallelujah what they don't know it
[1:38:40] become the downfall so you want to know
[1:38:43] let's let's continue
[1:38:44] hallelujah knowledge is information
[1:38:48] understanding is Crespin and so on and
[1:38:52] comprehending that information and
[1:38:54] wisdom is knowing what to do with that
[1:38:57] knowledge
[1:38:58] so if wisdom is the principal thing you
[1:39:01] have to start by knowledge the trans
[1:39:03] wisdom you know nothing
[1:39:04] Oh glory to God hallelujah or glory
[1:39:08] knowledge is that wisdom knowledge is
[1:39:10] wisdom is hope to use knowledge or glory
[1:39:13] the part and with knowledge and wisdom
[1:39:15] you should be blessed
[1:39:16] ignorance o'clock a bless that when
[1:39:19] products Solomon what you want Solomon
[1:39:22] said give me wisdom and knowledge to
[1:39:24] govern these people and control Solomon
[1:39:26] because of the natural riches because it
[1:39:28] in answered this and a host of eternal
[1:39:30] man I will bless you so much
[1:39:34] - Oh hallelujah because you're asked for
[1:39:39] wisdom and knowledge knowledge and
[1:39:41] wisdom you need it you need to know
[1:39:46] [Applause]
[1:39:48] after all the singing of the song
[1:39:50] service and you feel happy and nice you
[1:39:52] want to hear you're in competition for
[1:39:56] song service your competition for the
[1:40:00] music you come to church because I want
[1:40:02] to know what you don't know because this
[1:40:08] knowledge is what will empower you
[1:40:10] because this reveals the will of God for
[1:40:13] your life knowledge
[1:40:19] I prefer say wisdom is the principal
[1:40:22] thing get wisdom but before your poor
[1:40:25] chili dog whistle yell devotion to have
[1:40:27] knowledge but revelation here we go no
[1:40:34] supersedes knowledge because revelation
[1:40:38] is more than information revelation is
[1:40:41] knowing to know what you can't explain
[1:40:48] like how exact solution shall conceive
[1:40:50] he just knows it hallelujah hallelujah
[1:40:56] like all Abraham know even of a son
[1:40:59] named Isaac with his wife Sarah who
[1:41:02] can't have children
[1:41:03] that's not knowledge that's revelation
[1:41:06] that's knowing
[1:41:08] [Applause]
[1:41:11] you open the door in the clothes you
[1:41:13] open the door is closed you open the
[1:41:15] door in his clothes and something tell
[1:41:17] you for now that door will open and
[1:41:21] every devil say but your lifts and times
[1:41:24] under clothes
[1:41:25] that has nothing to do with now
[1:41:34] unless you hold the door opens because
[1:41:38] you are knowing that's revelation little
[1:41:43] man say I am some say of this some say
[1:41:46] that I'm Peter said that what the Christ
[1:41:47] he said flesh and blood hath not
[1:41:50] revealed this to you but my father has
[1:41:53] revealed this to you knowing Abram said
[1:42:01] aren't allowed we go up got an even more
[1:42:04] for my sake
[1:42:05] he's an analyte bigger and I are we
[1:42:07] gonna knock down that is knowing he
[1:42:11] doesn't know how this man gonna come
[1:42:12] true but he knows I stop putting up with
[1:42:15] him and I sacrum back down if quite
[1:42:17] other reason from the dead kögel risen
[1:42:19] from the dead but I'm going to sacrifice
[1:42:21] Isaac but coming back down all glory to
[1:42:28] God so what you're hearing preach as
[1:42:31] information or knowledge has to be
[1:42:33] revealed so that's why the devil fight
[1:42:36] you get it in the spirit because the
[1:42:39] Spirit is what brings revelation if the
[1:42:43] Spiritist are here we have a lecture
[1:42:44] hall we have an information center we
[1:42:50] have things that you never hear before
[1:42:52] but if you get in the spirit then the
[1:42:54] spirit to take a whole on the words
[1:42:57] being spoken and when it's revealed to
[1:43:00] you listen if your husband next to you
[1:43:01] if the white next to you if a brother
[1:43:04] next to you is a sensor next to you that
[1:43:06] has nothing to do you an external a
[1:43:08] direct channel of divine revelation
[1:43:16] I think I read this in a meeting Friday

[1:46:24] usually what a bomb the last night
[1:46:27] brings forth a better result when it
[1:46:28] comes to the healing services and pray
[1:46:30] for the sick because there's great
[1:46:33] anticipation the people Wheaton and
[1:46:35] person knowing that they want to get
[1:46:37] healed when butter brown wasn't seen
[1:46:42] people two three four four always beaten
[1:46:43] to get this idea Berlin if you had come
[1:46:46] clean of your manga Osito please
[1:46:47] but the reason to be here people didn't
[1:46:50] crutches or kind of conditionally with
[1:46:51] an outside the reason for the manner got
[1:46:53] a comedy called the note God couldn't
[1:46:55] trouble the water
[1:46:58] many no no money to go to no doctor
[1:47:00] Kuwait out of money you just pay your
[1:47:02] money because you playing with your
[1:47:03] money Romanian had no money was on a
[1:47:05] doctor so they're looking for a preacher
[1:47:07] to look in to be healed so BAM Baram
[1:47:09] says this watch
[1:47:11] so therefore what meaning supposed to
[1:47:12] tremendous the anticipation the
[1:47:15] expectation what is the whole issue with

[1:47:35] and those white people that's once on
[1:47:36] the one a comment just crazy and come
[1:47:38] into the church but because they have no
[1:47:39] understanding that the comment into his
[1:47:42] presence not to come in a bit over
[1:47:44] chances to Ovid and them and them and
[1:47:47] them are beyond that church up there no

[1:52:41] one way mechanics come like wind and Tex
[1:52:44] and scripture but this is a different
[1:52:47] kind of mechanics and let the

[1:52:52] change your mind you go out outside of
[1:52:54] that you do no good and that's what the

[1:53:10] come to a knowledge and understanding
[1:53:12] and get a revelation of your name in
[1:53:14] that book then it changes all together
[1:53:16] it doesn't matter where go chop you
[1:53:18] you can chop in the fiery furnace you
[1:53:19] can jump in the lion's den you can chop
[1:53:21] it down and eat wherever you chopping
[1:53:23] your survive you wanna make it because
[1:53:25] of who you are because of the faith God

[1:56:21] only thing I had to happen was for
[1:56:23] inspiration to strike him then he knowed

[1:59:47] they come to church for now yet a spoken
[1:59:49] word that you could know what to speak
[1:59:52] the word got the mechanics ready if it
[1:59:58] only needs the dynamics tonight if we
[2:00:00] were getting mechanics ready what get
[2:00:02] our hearts right the things that we can
[2:00:05] do that's what we're the Gideon was
[2:00:07] talking about what you can do not what
[2:00:10] you can hear what you can do after what
[2:00:12] you're here for them on every word

[2:00:19] he told us to do get watch get ready
[2:00:23] every mechanic ready and stand there
[2:00:25] then we are ready for the dams in little
[2:00:27] and only quad can do that so it not only
[2:00:30] court cuts left of the dynamics yes and
[2:00:33] that is the faith that says I am NOT
[2:00:35] healed then that don't make any
[2:00:37] difference what circumstances is you are
[2:00:39] healed any now because if I fit your
[2:00:41] heel so that Centurion and Kindle

[2:00:49] just a good I way that's all he had a
[2:00:52] fee he just believe what Jesus said and

[2:01:21] the special there's something in your
[2:01:22] spirit something sense that's why you're
[2:01:24] come they come because something pull
[2:01:25] you something drawer or glory to God
[2:01:27] hallelujah feel that corporately for you

[2:01:33] glory to God that's what you have to
[2:01:35] come with I know in a consciousness and
[2:01:37] awareness or either God hallelujah
[2:01:41] maybe seated oh praise God hallelujah
[2:01:45] version 2 for nevertheless I have
[2:01:47] somewhat against it because I was left I
[2:01:49] feel of to understand this you must
[2:01:51] realize the Spirit is not speaking to
[2:01:54] the original scenes of episodes alone
[2:01:55] this message is to the entire age with
[2:01:58] last 120 years its message them is to
[2:02:01] all generations in that span long
[2:02:04] history keep repeating itself in a
[2:02:06] generation of Israel we see revival in
[2:02:07] one generation only to see the fires
[2:02:09] phasing in the next in the timid
[2:02:11] generation embers may be growing
[2:02:13] slightly in the fourth
[2:02:14] there's no vestige whatsoever of the
[2:02:16] original flame then God lights the fire
[2:02:18] again and the same process is repeated
[2:02:20] it is simply the manifestation of the
[2:02:23] truth that God has no grandchildren
[2:02:25] salvation is not passed on by natural
[2:02:28] built anymore isn't it true to a Pacific
[2:02:30] succession
[2:02:31] it isn't anyway you start out with a
[2:02:34] truly born again believer next
[2:02:35] generation comes along they will no
[2:02:37] longer just plain Christians they have
[2:02:39] taken on denominational names and no
[2:02:40] Baptist Methodist etc they are not
[2:02:43] Christians they have to be born again of
[2:02:45] the will of God not by the will of man
[2:02:47] to be saved and these folks are all
[2:02:49] coming together no by the will of man I
[2:02:51] don't see that some of them aren't right
[2:02:53] with God not for a minute but the
[2:02:55] original fire has died down they are not
[2:02:58] the same anymore
[2:02:58] here we go the fervent desire to please
[2:03:02] God the passion to know his word the cry
[2:03:07] for regional in the spirit begins to
[2:03:09] feed and instead of the church feed on
[2:03:12] fire with the fire of God it has cooled
[2:03:15] off and become former diagur the excuses
[2:03:19] from formality or glory to God I like to
[2:03:23] put it this way the passion to know the
[2:03:25] world they cry to get in the spirit and
[2:03:28] the fufun desire to please God you want
[2:03:31] to have a person don't know what God
[2:03:34] said in his word if you have that
[2:03:36] passion a date a pass and you don't read
[2:03:39] something in that word because you want
[2:03:41] to know
[2:03:43] you want to have God's knowledge yes you
[2:03:46] want to be in the scripture he said
[2:03:48] whole time we know he's in my sire when
[2:03:50] to be not constantly in the wood you
[2:03:51] have to be constantly in the world to
[2:03:53] know who the Messiah is because today he
[2:03:56] is rain tomorrow he is blood
[2:03:58] today he is test tomorrow is that
[2:04:00] according to what is promised for the
[2:04:02] Aged
[2:04:03] so you have to be in the world to know
[2:04:04] what he has promised he said I will
[2:04:06] leave you not comfort us so now is the
[2:04:09] comforter next minute even spirit of
[2:04:11] truth next minute he's disguised as
[2:04:13] mechanics net mirror these dynamics or
[2:04:15] cattle or - oh who do you see themselves
[2:04:18] or plural of choreographer understanding
[2:04:23] hallelujah and to be in the word to know
[2:04:25] who the Messiah is Oh glory to God
[2:04:28] hallelujah that was beginning to have an
[2:04:32] emphasis they were getting former the
[2:04:34] abandonment of God was dying out and
[2:04:36] people weren't too careful about what

[2:04:41] careful about what the world thought of
[2:04:43] them

[2:32:20] academic right for their night seek keep
[2:32:23] knocking keep keep till your purses stay
[2:32:26] with
[2:32:26] try until the promise world business is
[2:32:29] vindicated then you got it you've pulled
[2:32:31] out the worry no more
[2:32:32] you see the Bible promises then stay
[2:32:34] right there and lie until you get it if
[2:32:37] a little baby sees our cookie and he one
[2:32:39] says he cry and cry and stick and scream
[2:32:41] and holler turn red in the face until

[2:32:45] what he wanted
[2:32:46] if you have to lick off the ice cream
[2:32:48] cone he will keep on frosty bigoted and
[2:32:50] that's the way we are supposed to do we
[2:33:01] are pushing the territory of wise
[2:33:03] virgins yeah because the wise version of
[2:33:07] extra oil so the vice version only
[2:33:09] appearing to be hungry and thirsty when
[2:33:12] everybody's that is I'm telling you
[2:33:14] before his version does do say I am
[2:33:16] foolish imma food is vegetable since I'm
[2:33:18] a foolish version no did not see natural
[2:33:20] they think they smart they think they're
[2:33:23] wise they so smart they're not really
[2:33:25] stunning the extra oil they're so smart
[2:33:28] they're not studying the extra sacrifice
[2:33:31] this was smart they're not willing to
[2:33:33] pay any price not what was said to them
[2:33:36] both to them that sell and buy that
[2:33:40] means the wise virgins was making
[2:33:42] sacrifice the wise version was acting on
[2:33:45] the faith the wise version was buying
[2:33:47] oil because they saw the value of the
[2:33:51] oil let's continue know what if I see a
[2:33:54] promise in the Bible that God would then
[2:33:57] I will steer their and cry out till God
[2:33:59] give it to me and he will do that get
[2:34:02] off of your hands get o get you off this
[2:34:04] hands you see that will be auntie but
[2:34:07] he's wanting you to do it he likes for
[2:34:09] you to ask acts abundantly that your joy
[2:34:11] might be full he likes for you to ask
[2:34:16] you might like to sing but you have to
[2:34:19] ask mi long specials but you have to ask
[2:34:22] acts that your joy might be full god
[2:34:25] help me hallelujah cry until his word is
[2:34:29] vindicated or praise the name of the
[2:34:31] Lord hallelujah
[2:34:33] bitter Jesus so court recommends for his
[2:34:36] children his believe in children not
[2:34:38] intellectual speeches not some
[2:34:40] crateology to teach he wants you to cry
[2:34:43] for our knees we over forty years in the
[2:34:45] message 50s in the message we know what
[2:34:47] the message holes what they promised is
[2:34:49] time to cry out cry out fear
[2:34:55] you are too stiff and starchy I really
[2:34:57] you will never get it stiff and starchy
[2:35:04] doesn't get it
[2:35:05] strip churches still preachers starchy
[2:35:10] preachers never get it understand it is
[2:35:13] easy to hit the intellectual line the
[2:35:16] line of theology explanation deep
[2:35:19] revelation mystery and talk and talk but
[2:35:21] it's different when you're so big in
[2:35:23] tutors until they'll describe what he
[2:35:27] was comparing to has the heart not just
[2:35:31] us but as the heart thanked after the
[2:35:35] water Brooks humble man went like my
[2:35:38] vision to explain what that means

[2:36:07] the brook to get water water energized
[2:36:11] the water will fire that had to run
[2:36:13] again it caught the captain up water

[2:43:14] he said I choose being seen after the
[2:43:16] brightest raptured please fully explain
[2:43:19] about the Gentiles that born go in the
[2:43:21] rapture I thought you said that the
[2:43:23] Gentiles that were left went to the
[2:43:25] tribulation and give their lives for a
[2:43:27] testimony of Jesus when he returns from
[2:43:30] the Gentiles the Jews and the other long
[2:43:32] question and so on but a Branham please
[2:43:34] explain because you said there will be a
[2:43:36] small number go in the rapture what
[2:43:38] about the people that believe in the
[2:43:39] Lord and don't believe it the way we
[2:43:41] preach this endtime message will let me
[2:43:43] save this assign a name very good
[2:43:45] question
[2:43:46] now the first place the confusion is
[2:43:47] I've said about the Gentile deeds to be
[2:43:49] done when the tribulation and
[2:43:50] tribulation I do not believe that the
[2:43:53] Gentiles and the Gentile bride not a
[2:43:56] Gentile church now the Gentile church
[2:43:59] will go to the tribulation that is
[2:44:04] people any message with all the oil
[2:44:06] let's call them tribulation scenes see
[2:44:12] the bride is the elected they caught you
[2:44:15] nothing by the rapture they are change
[2:44:18] and take note of the world
[2:44:20] that's what I want to be many of the
[2:44:22] questions while wilderbe write this you
[2:44:25] can't divide the bride here we go is the
[2:44:28] elected of God the church goes true the
[2:44:32] church that's the ones that said
[2:44:34] whosoever will let them come o the
[2:44:38] spirit and the bride say come let him
[2:44:40] become inshaallah will you see the huge
[2:44:42] ever will
[2:44:43] that is church who should ever will come
[2:44:46] the bride is elected to God so the bride

[2:44:53] whosoever will oh praise the name of the
[2:44:56] Lord thirsty yes you're thirsty for
[2:44:59] living reality you're testing for oil
[2:45:02] you're testing for not just oil but
[2:45:05] extra shout out extra the people get
[2:45:12] scholarships and exams
[2:45:13] what is the routine their money out of
[2:45:14] guys who bright the do extra the extra
[2:45:18] make the difference the extra is what
[2:45:21] make them where they are the bride gonna
[2:45:23] have extra because she's doing extra or
[2:45:26] glory negotiations press an extra she's
[2:45:29] hunger and she is tested she's gonna be
[2:45:31] filled
[2:45:36] whatever I'm talk about my tears have
[2:45:38] been my media and night my soul thirsts
[2:45:40] for God for the Living God when shall I
[2:45:43] come and appear because the people sick
[2:45:46] until where is your God I see you look
[2:45:48] in her eyes where is their God I said
[2:45:50] like looking at your plate nothing
[2:45:52] seemed to be working out where is your
[2:45:53] God when you hear that so when people
[2:45:55] want to tell you where is your God
[2:45:57] it should burden you to cry on to him
[2:46:00] because you want to show that God you
[2:46:03] want to display that God you are not
[2:46:05] going to show up Oh glory of God
[2:46:11] when Moses try stealing these people and
[2:46:13] kill the man around for forty years
[2:46:15] all them people back there he think
[2:46:17] about them in well forty years pass man
[2:46:21] buried a son man buried this one woman
[2:46:23] dead and bury what not Podesta eaten
[2:46:25] when God ready and annoyed Moses and him
[2:46:27] back here God come back
[2:46:29] quad-cam nonconformist willin to bring
[2:46:31] his vindication booth to bring the
[2:46:33] people out there is your God I think
[2:46:36] David and right in this Sam must have
[2:46:38] been in distress and it usually take the
[2:46:41] stress to bring the best thought of a
[2:46:42] man when we get down we fast many times
[2:46:45] to get ourselves in a position to get
[2:46:47] ourselves out of the way and I think
[2:46:48] when David got these places he began to
[2:46:50] meditate on the Lord and to think on
[2:46:52] these things meditating is not reading
[2:46:55] meditates is not your head in a book on
[2:46:57] your studying or your internet anyway an
[2:46:58] amazing you know when you're thinking
[2:47:00] over when you're spending time how am I
[2:47:03] going what kind of life I'm living then
[2:47:05] you're looking inside is this what I
[2:47:07] want is this how I want to live I don't
[2:47:10] want that for my life Lord I want
[2:47:12] something better you see some people
[2:47:13] don't take time for that they don't take
[2:47:14] that see yourself they seen others they
[2:47:18] might not appeal resist but they can't
[2:47:19] see for themselves
[2:47:20] yes the figure they smacked don't
[2:47:23] smarten everybody the couch might God so
[2:47:27] David use a meditate think about the
[2:47:28] Lord and as I think like this last I was
[2:47:32] natesan thinking and colorfully message
[2:47:35] my mind and it come to me about
[2:47:36] revelation is knowing I didn't read it
[2:47:39] in a book it just struck me about
[2:47:41] knowledge about understanding about
[2:47:44] wisdom and revelation supersedes that
[2:47:47] because revelation is knowing that's a
[2:47:50] different kind of sense or glory the
[2:47:52] garden knowing halle-loo is a super
[2:47:55] sense it's been caught reveal himself to

[2:57:13] say it - tell the truth I don't know who
[2:57:19] is who
[2:57:20] so I had a preacher so all I custody to
[2:57:26] sell you you you you that purse so let
[2:57:28] me let me continue the test is like an
[2:57:33] alarm clock the soul sets off an alarm
[2:57:37] clock a little buzzer that tells you
[2:57:40] that is looking 9 if you don't get the
[2:57:43] pretty water soon you'll die it's get
[2:57:45] load unload till you putting it off you
[2:57:47] will die
[2:57:48] I'm timid describe it on the sound as
[2:57:50] the hot pant after the water broke
[2:57:52] so my soul after this and so on he said
[2:57:54] the wild dog grabbed this deer by the
[2:57:56] flanks it missed the throat he will grab
[2:58:00] him a second time at the Frank another -
[2:58:02] try enough and quick enough he can shake
[2:58:04] the dog off that there is much faster
[2:58:07] the talk stalks him when he's not
[2:58:09] looking and when he's upwind from him he
[2:58:11] pulled not that dog is near and when the
[2:58:14] wild dog grabs him he's really quick he
[2:58:16] can throw it off but when the talks come
[2:58:17] out or the Frank he has got a whole
[2:58:19] mouthful of deer flesh he grabs at the
[2:58:21] neck sometimes he cut the jugular and
[2:58:23] miss it and she had him shaken he pull a
[2:58:26] whole chunk of meat off to the DA's
[2:58:27] truth and the blood begins to run then
[2:58:30] the dog will come right on the trail of
[2:58:32] blood after the deer as the life of the
[2:58:35] dirac instead mental as the blood which
[2:58:37] is the live stream of the body begins to
[2:58:39] Twinner down the DA gets weaker and the
[2:58:41] dog or the wolf is right behind a deer
[2:58:43] if that deer can find water know what
[2:58:46] has something in it
[2:58:48] drinks the water it stops the bleeding
[2:58:50] but if you don't get the water to cool
[2:58:52] off keeps flowing faster and faster
[2:58:56] because he's running why are you running
[2:59:12] from the enemy now that their nose
[2:59:15] unless he finds water he's gone he just
[2:59:18] can't live I have trapped them many
[2:59:20] times been wounded and when he hits a
[2:59:22] stream of water he was crossing and get
[2:59:24] a drink and up goes the hill come back
[2:59:26] don't get a drink of water and go up you
[2:59:27] will never catch with him as long as he
[2:59:30] follows that stream but once he leaves
[2:59:32] that stream if he can't find another
[2:59:34] book of water
[2:59:35] oh god you look at him right away oh my
[2:59:39] hallelujah and that is all David could
[2:59:42] say as to half panted after the water
[2:59:44] broke
[2:59:45] he wasn't right - no intellectual song
[2:59:47] this was a reality no he was dying
[2:59:50] he's only got to get a drink of water
[2:59:51] and the last day of the feast Jesus
[2:59:55] passed Oh glory to God if any man passed

[3:04:19] views and so forth but when it comes to
[3:04:21] that to this we can meet and common
[3:04:22] ground one ground some might believe in
[3:04:24] sprinkling someone in water baptism we
[3:04:26] come on neutral grounds because he's
[3:04:27] artists for him and fellowship Oh glory
[3:04:31] to God hallelujah not join in church
[3:04:33] quoting a Creed something like that it's
[3:04:35] nothing but the very presence and
[3:04:37] feeling of caught himself in your life
[3:04:38] that will satisfy that to know him his
[3:04:40] life are they gonna skip down quickly
[3:04:42] oh praise the name of the Lord Wow we
[3:04:45] have so much stuff here praise God
[3:04:47] thank you lord Oh watch there we go the
[3:04:50] danger of neglect is you say I have a
[3:04:52] hole it is but I'm not guilty but a
[3:04:53] Branum or just go to Jordan Church see
[3:04:55] the neglect appears if you neglect the
[3:04:58] salad
[3:04:58] of water food you will die say no what
[3:05:03] naturally if you don't drink if you
[3:05:06] don't eat you will die and if you get a
[3:05:11] test and you forgot you which
[3:05:14] spiritually die you're physically in
[3:05:17] church but you're dead on the inside
[3:05:21] you call for revivals you wait for your
[3:05:24] church to have a revival that in revival
[3:05:27] for you the revival ought to begin right
[3:05:29] in you when you begin to test for
[3:05:31] thought there might not be another
[3:05:34] member of the church one day that
[3:05:35] revival if it bridge off in you it will
[3:05:37] break out in other places the revival is
[3:05:47] stopping you and I'm hoping and start
[3:05:50] today that's why the bonds are very
[3:05:52] fabric of the sisters that watch the
[3:05:54] dishes because the spirit of prayers
[3:05:56] upon the sisters they kind of under God
[3:05:59] almost done here
[3:06:01] I remember the Word of God is what the
[3:06:03] Holy Spirit feeds on it don't fees on
[3:06:05] enthusiasm it dole feeds on education it
[3:06:08] doesn't feed on coach church-going it
