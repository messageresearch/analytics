are lifted the voice to God we'd want to call and said Lord Thou Art God which had made heaven on Earth the sea and all that is in demands who by the mouth of thy servant David said why did the hidden rage you see them in the scriptures now and the people imagine everything the kings of the earth stood up and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ for our truth against the holy Child Jesus whom there was anointed with Herod and punches I left with the Gentiles and the people of Israel were gathered together for to do whatever they hand that I counsel

word of God with boldness and the multitude of them that believe of one heart of one Soul neither said any one of them or the things which he possessed was his own and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great grace was upon them all Give the Lord some praises and when they prayed the peace began to shake and they were filled again they call that a refilling of the same Holy Ghost oh God in Acts 2 this is in Acts chapter 4 and the prophet said the Dynamics of this church will be a reselling of the Holy Ghost that we have worked in a small

that brought her to Isaac she failed her face she wanted no more to do with her own thinking Isaac was a thinker from then on and the church itself when it strikes that power of God we have to strike it the church when we strike the power of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost out of the nominational churches so he's the top of Pentecostal stuff and ecumenical stuff and Evangelical stuff he's not talking about them he's talking about us because we are not a denomination he's talking about the baptism coming out outside or give the Lord Our Praise [Applause] all right when watching his spot now when it strikes that power of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost out of the nominational churches out of the Catholic Church wherever it is are you ready when that baptism of the Holy Ghost is made real to people it had to be made real to you [Applause] because if you ever made retail you go want it I never asked for it because Jesus said which man which father will his son ask for a bread wouldn't give him a serpent how much more the father will give the Holy Ghost to them that to them that to them that [Applause] so if you know this is given for you this is promised to you and you need it you have to have it you have to ask God for it you can't do like a shy like a you know like God begging God want to give you more than you want to ask for it this one revolutionize your life

that ear and cause you don't bear my word it's not you the spirit okay the Lord I shout in the house he will cause you to obey his word oh my God hallelujah so when that baptism of the Holy Ghost is made real to people them that are predestinated like you people here to eat in life see it and walk in it what is it Super Saiyan Super Saiyan and they possess the gates of the enemy oh my you love him this morning praise be to Jesus one of us should do this please God will I am just doing what I feel led to do you have to find it there's some uh Acts chapter 10. there was a certain man in Caesarean named Cornelius a centurion of the band called Italian band these are the Jew he's a gentile a devout man he didn't get my present in Jesus name he committed Fellowship no church he had no Bible no book one that feared God that any kind of money is with all his hopes and give much arms to the people might attack the pocket could we tell them that you ain't going good they don't want you they don't want to put their honey give it nothing the mean of the devil in church this man he's not in church he's not a believer he is devote God see in that he has just got seeing that he feared God God seeing that he given much God seeing that and he prayed to God always you're here about 700 Revival yet but be praying to God always for your gossip pray to God before you complain pray to God I've been saying 90 percent of the people they complaining to they don't want to hear your complaints they don't want to hear your story you're coming across negative 10 of the people want you to be as you are they're happy when you're in trouble to take your burden to the Lord and leave it there Hallelujah so God give Cornelius a vision to send for Peter because Peter is in the body and the blood of God runs through the body germs come from the body isn't that right Peter under the other hand got a vision also rise and eat God is showing him to do something he never did before because he never ministered his Gentiles before and Peter there came a voice Peter said rise and eat but Peter said not so Lord I have never eaten anything common or unclean and the voice speak unto him again second time saying what God has cleansed Thou shalt not call command so if we don't know could teach us to reveal to us to bring Clarity to his purpose in your life because sometimes God called it to do things that you're not expected that your human Spirit might might get problems with watch now when Peter doubted in himself what his vision which he had seen should mean behold men which was sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon's house stood before the gate spirit is speaking arise get it down go with them doubting nothing for I have sent them I have sent them then Peter went on to the man which was sent from unto him for Cornelius and said behold I am here with whom don't seek what is the cause wherever you have come then said Cornelius the Centurion or just man one that favorite God of good report among all the nation of the Jews was born from God by an Holy Angel to send for thee unto his house and to hear words of Thee then calling them in and Lodge them and on the more Peter went away with them and certain bedroom dropper accompany him the president come with Peter too and and tomorrow after the international caesarea Cornelius greeted for them had called them together his kinsman's near friends and as Peter was coming and Cornelius met him and fell long at his feet and worship him Peter took him up and saying stand up I myself also I'm a man explanation by the reason that he bow you know because he anointed me he saw the anointed upon me that that's why he born you know so don't be hard on him Peter wasn't that foolishness make an excuse for man worship and pumping up man and whatnot Peter said no no I'm not sure man and he talked with him he went in and found many that will come together he said to them he know how that is unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company or common to want that of another Nation but God showed me that I should not call any man common or unclean therefore came I unto you without gain saying as soon as I was sent for I asked therefore for what intent you have sent for me I call you I said four days ago I was fasting oh my God you hear that word as I would foreign now you know this thing called fast in church but he I was fasting until this hour and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house and behold a manager before me in bright clothing I said Cornelius my prayers heard baptized a church or older and God said your prayer so you can't judge people all day you know because God know what's inside the heart God know what the praying you can't say because this man's not in church because you don't believe what we believe no no no no no no you not the judge of that let God deal with that that's sincere genuine people that may never step into this building that may never come to this church or whatever it is but they love God they have a heart for God and they're crying out to God for help for deliverance for breakthrough [Music] Cornelius thy prayers heard thine arms are hard in remembrances so God even commended them he's given free your arms are held in remembrance in the sight of God send therefore to Japan call Heather Simon who sent him as Peter he's lodging the house of one Simon attana by the Sea and he shall speak unto thee immediately therefore I send to thee and thou has wealth as well done that thou had come now therefore are we all here present before God to hear all things that commandity of God so what they're saying there Peter you are a spokesman God sent you to bring words to us then Peter opened his mouth instead of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter prisons but in every nation either feared him and work at righteousness is accepted with him the word which God sent unto the children of Israel preaching Peace by Jesus Christ he is Lord of all the word I say you know which was published throughout Julia beginning From Galilee and the baptism is John preached oh God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power listen to Peter's testimony how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth where the Holy Ghost went power who went about doing good and healing all our oppressed of the devil for God was with him and we Are Witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem and they slew and hung on a tree him God raised up the third day and showed him openly not to all the people but unto Witnesses chosen before God even to us who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead so Peter is testifying that he is risen he is resurrected the Christ will tell him but they're not dead price the gospel we preacher and no dead gospel it is resurrected it is quick name it is alive he is raised from the dead Hallelujah verse 42 and he commanded us to preach unto the people and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the judge of the quick and the dead to him give all the prophets witness that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remissions of sins while Peter speak these words the Holy Ghost [Music] [Applause] fell [Music] on all them which heard the word that means the Holy Ghost could fall on you today oh give the Lord some praises not the pastor shake your hand not an explanation of the Holy Ghost but this Holy Ghost we're talking about it has fallen you anointed fall on me [Applause] anointing Hallelujah fall on me [Music] Corey so Peter was so anointed you may be seated so traumatized with the power and presence of God that the words coming out of his lips were the words of God and the Holy Spirit the spirit follows what the spirit follows the words so Peter was with me flesh world was coming out of his mouth and the spirit began to follow what Peter was saying so after a while the word convert the spirit because Jesus said the words that I speak unto you they are Spirit they are life so Peter was speaking words and during the words being spoken it must transform to Spirit and the spirit fell upon them and quickened what was in them okay the Lord some Praises okay the Lord has shouted the house glory to God the spirit come like water the Spirit come like rain spirit is quick than power or glory to God listen and they of the circumcision which believed were astonished this is shock treatment for them the president repeater all of them as many that came with Peter because on the Gentiles also was poured out what that would poured out the fighting already on the Gentiles was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost and they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God then answer Peter can any man forbid water that he should not be baptized which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we the same Holy Ghost we receive them have to but as soon as I get baptized in water oh give the Lord a shout and if God could feel Cornelius if God could fill out Gentile man that's not that that has nothing baptized in Jesus name why God can't fill you this morning come on come on come on come on people come on hallelujah praise are showing you that this thing is real this thing is positive this thing is Possible Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God hallelujah glory to God so the Dynamics is about to break upon the bride around the world for the baptism of the Holy Ghost given a Feeling and refilling and then to form us into the wood image which is virtue and knowledge and Temperance and patience and Godless and broadly kindness isn't that right and after that to do what to send us into the wilderness to be tried and nobody press come down not yet because when Jesus got his measure Hallelujah the fullness of the Holy Ghost when it hit Jesus so Jesus said come on and say I am Jesus you know I have full measure here a charge no the Bible said the spirit let him it was the Dynamics let him into the willingness to overcome the loss of the eyes to overcome the loss of the flesh to overcome the pride of life to have a personal one-on-one man or a manual with Lucifer himself and when he finished with Lucifer he returned into the temple and the Spirit came back upon him then he found the place where it was written the spirit and the bride the spirit is upon me because he had anointed me oh God have mercy and the pride will come back after a place I tried come back and say the spirit is now upon me because the spirit will come upon the bride that is thirsty at the Lord that is Dusty in the scriptures nothing going to stop it [Applause] this morning if you are packing his bright buddy the spirit will come upon you have to come upon you it's a quick Year from deadness it will awaken into righteousness it will Quicken you unto his holiness Oh Glory to God Amen my Hallelujah glory to God in and wait let's continue Luther pre-justification but he let it run wild because he didn't live long enough and they organized Luther never organized it the church Wesley they got the Wesleyan Church after that come John Smith and the Baptist on Alexander Cameron support and they were reformers that didn't live long enough to get it together so a lot of loose ends were left what about this many Muslim but using title and many of those things that are left loose but when we come to the end this is us now to the last message is supposed to straighten all that up to bring all these things to one fate one Lord one baptism in other words another Ephesians so this message is to bring us into the Ephesians which were the elected Church the collation the Galatians was the Corinthians were Slackers I'd walk on a crazy living harmonica region the Galatians was legalists Hebrews was babies but

get to the key thing I want to say here yet he said the cap never did come because it was a Cornerstone it was a headstone then he rephrased it he said in the church it was the Cornerstone in the full church is The Headstone and unless he's saying in the church it was Ephesians 2 20. we are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets with Jesus himself as the Chief Cornerstone so in the early church that was the Cornerstone but the Cornerstone now become The Headstone ah and the stone the pillar reviews has become The Headstone of the corner and the Bible said this is the Lord's doing for Give the Lord a shout this is the Lord's doing it is marvelous in our eyes this is the day this is the day that the Lord had made we are going to rejoice and be glad in it oh my hallelujah praise God praise God praise God praise God hallelujah hallelujah glory to God glory to God glory to God hallelujah hallelujah glory to God glory to God hallelujah give me season so listen that's the reason the devil fight broadly kindness that's the reason the devil fought against the spirit of forgiveness because as long as we don't have that Spirit as long as we catch up our Earth we cannot break into the Holy Spirit notice where the holy spirit is placed right on top of Brotherly kindness when you stand praying for Dynamics for the Holy Ghost for the baptism forgive if you have ought against any so the devil jumped all these years was to ensure people mine and caress they Grudge and they ought and they keep renewing their membership in The Grudge Affair renewing the Envy every year they're taking a fresh renewal of the hatred praise God some passes even put it upon the people oh glory to God but that can't attract the Holy Ghost what attract the Holy Ghost it's a spirit of forgiveness when you could drop your heart against your husband against your wife against your children against the boss against your sister against your brother against your family against their sister against this brother I just a pastor against some Elder you drop it drop it drop it drop it drop it okay the Lord some Praises because you are pressing the Perfection you are present the charity you are present the love [Applause] [Music] story don't be seated so hear this prophecy of what will be among the true church but the true church all over the world has shaped down to a place that they come a Ministry among them just exactly like the ministry of Jesus Christ no ministers fight me when I preach about days of fight for Ministry yet because everybody figured because any people put this fight from the street that's not true the fifo ministry is adopted songs I have my Ministry in Baltimore but Christ is a person Christ has his own Ministry if Christ stepped into this Tabernacle he will manifest his ministry that's what happened he said I represent defeat yeah he was representing the faith until the faith came into him which was the angel of God so the prophecy is the pillar far is to be veiled in the adopted Sons don't think that's an impossible and we've got Peter had it you know he was because but fisherman Peter you know he was denying man Peter I don't know that man you know but the pillar fire was veiled in Peter so when anas and pharah come lying in the church they told us another man standing there I hear him for so much time I listen to him I hear him already I know him Peter said you enlighten me you lie to the Holy Ghost I'm not in charge of this thing here no judgment strike he said go happen again because people watching with their eyes and with their flesh and with their senses instead of watching what God promised [Applause] [Music] like if somebody watching Jesus and say well Jesus never stuck on Instagram Jesus never even Shake Supreme anointing power and control but what did Isaiah say Isaiah system her lips I never hear Jesus stammer you what Jesus underwater prophecy you are Jesus keep watching Jesus you are the what is your prophec Y and your prophecy says stagger your promises said baptism approaching God's Throne that way you have something called it burners which is seraphims that have fire and calls when Isaiah said war is me I'm undone I'm a man of unclean lips then the angel came at coals above the altar touch his tongue he said no that iniquity is purged a man speaking for God any unclean but God Purge him with what with fire with Mysteries fire with a nice message no fire but what about there's no fire oh give the Lord a shout save the fire come the demons still in the church walking the Lord I shot and never made that statement before if the fire don't come the demons sitting message demons all glory to God hallelujah there are new kind there's a new kind of demon message demons sitting in the churches all around the world if there is no fire god send the fire Holy Ghost Fire Glory maybe seated praise God there's a woman with a prostitute drunk and all kind of thing like that and somebody said who could get that woman clean or something so and somebody kept and said I know Jesus Christ cleans that woman and when the god finish with a woman she didn't take another drink she wasn't in no bar she was free from all her past free from Fear free from what people talking about her and who the son of man set free is free indeed and when God come not gonna do something in your heart you little rascal inside of here set the long self-righteous like if you're so nice you need to get to the Cross you need to know Jesus died for your sins hey glory to God not one of your goodness all have come short of the glory of God there is none righteous no not one am I preaching the gospel this morning oh glory Lord God Hallelujah [Laughter] oh this is good this is good this is good this is good [Music] this is very good Hallelujah watch watch they got the thing in condition what's the next thing the rejected Stone to the pyramid cut out of the monkey without what without hands God sent it watch the rejected one the rejected stone is the head the Capstone the very one that they rejected to this Gentile Aid was Christ and Christ was not cut and put there as a thicker or Son of God or some good dictionary church he is the Holy Spirit and the cap of the pyramid will be Christ coming do you see it his Spirit just beneath him l-o-v-e is the spirit of Christ coming into the church to manifest those Seven Virtues the Seven Virtues was in the apostles they had all seven of them they had Christ in them Christ was living in them not just a bird but the person of Christ was living in them they had another person who gave the Lord some Praises India person had another person it was the person of Jesus Christ Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God praise God all right now watch um you understand watch Daniel said he watches Gentile age until the Stone come out of the mountain that was cut without hands and they never put a Capstone on the pyramid it was wasn't cut by man's hand it is God's hands that cut that stone and it hit the image right smack on his feet broke it to Pieces brung it to power powder what happened at that time the coming of that stone up went the church in the glory at the Rapture caused it and did the Gentile dispensation God ended it up the coming of that stone so The Headstone closes off the Gentile dispensation now when the Rain Begin to Fall Noah was already sealed into the ark anybody feeling inspired now to to believe Noah's message to get in they couldn't go in because what God God shuts is shot and the Bible said God shut that door so no one couldn't put his hand and open that door for nobody I am your cousin he had a hundred and twenty years to be cousin he was causing 110 years I preaching the same message get into the ark because rain coming judgment coming no Noah on the earth on the children feeling you know somebody texts him having a party tonight you know we didn't have to do this Fool's Day pass no rain what a test I understand Daddy are you sure because that next two hours and every rain coming next week as me as well go and do our party and come back oh yeah shut up son it's gonna rain two days pass through this part what God doing preaching to people that cannot be saved nothing you could do about that and the prophecy is they're going to be a preaching to Eternal loss people will be seen on the internet seeing signs one does Miracles or pouring fire falling and they can't do nothing about it finish the stone the builders refused don't understand let's go so Jesus was God's Corner wheat to have been recently dead and he was the first fruits of them that slept and he was a Sheaf no when in the Bible time when you have your corn crop on you you get the corn coming to maturity you get the first one come to maturity first firm aircon this is a common with it before the Lord that was a weave chief and what that tells you others coming you know they're the first one to come to maturity so there's a sign we're getting a crop here it is God is good oh God be so in tears we're written now we're so in tears we venture the months mole and corn spray and corn and what no no we have a harvest now this is only the first one you have 10 acres with corn this is the first one come to maturity well Christ was the first fruit of them that set all them things were going on they're not dead they're only sleeping but Christ rose from the dead as the first fruit of them that step I can hear Brother nice praising God I can hear all them things were going on before saying hallelujah oh glory to God the church has come to cut the Perfection to bring on the resurrection and every Devon held don't want you to see Perfection Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated remember Abraham has Faith remember Isaac is love remember Jacob is Grace but Joseph that's Perfection nothing against him nothing against you nothing against him nothing against you you are the bride or can the Lord and Shout oh help me this morning Jesus Oh Glory to God are you this happening that happen but when God looked upon you and see the blood upon you he don't see your sins he don't see your faults he don't see your failures he don't see your short comments he see the back of his own son not guilty case dismissed if you don't shout about that I don't know what they're gonna shout about oh get the Lord some Praises this morning Oh Glory to God I hope you're shouting on the internet I hope you're shouting at the heaviness shout in your house shout wherever you are or give the Lord some Praises we have in a shouting time here this morning oh praise God praise God hallelujah so the first one that comes to maturity had to be waved as a memorial on Thanksgiving to God oh praise God and what's something he was the first person that slept he was wave over the promised seed I had the promise of life he was waved on the day of Pentecost and where there came a song from heaven like a waving Mighty Russian wind and wave over the people amen waiting for the blessing to come and is to be waved again again according to Luke 17 30 the son of man in the day when the Solomon will be revealed or wave again over the people that's why every service we're only giving you promises or you want to be filled you are going to deliver you know what we do in here we dropping them promises into you we peppering you with promises we're hitting here with promises we deliver in the Promises by these promises you become partake of yourself divine nature you need promises you don't need to all talk we're not here to talk about Ukraine and Russia not this morning we're not here to talk about Pope Francis not this morning we had to talk about these promises Give the Lord a shout in the house Oh Glory to God this waving of the Holy Ghost oh Hallelujah Glory let's continue here now who is the son of man in the beginning was the word the wizard with God and the Word was made flesh and dwelling Among Us Now Luke 17 verse different scriptures that word again is wave over the people what has been wave over that the dead tradition of man is dead and the Son of God is alive with the baptism of the Holy Spirit right Among Us but at only we have to have this right we don't need no money we need a baptism of the Holy Ghost right among us if nobody in the message wanted we wanted this is the oil I don't want to be no foolish version I want to have oil and extra too that's why I shouting the way I shouting that's why I praise and a way of prison I want a little more give me all in my lamb to keep me burning Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Glory love God what we even have a Sheaf what was the Sheaf the first one that come to mature that prude was a wheat that prove it was a Sheaf he said I'm sure you know what I'm talking about it was way over the people and for the first time they will come forth prophecy for the bright age not loudicia he at least prophesied it first time for the bright age there will be a message you want to hear my messages the message will be the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power being wave over the People by the same signs and wonders that he picked up that's the prophecy the maturity of the word so we find out Faith could grow Faith could ripen fake and mature feet are different stages the different qualities of Faith they find measures of Faith so God wants to get the measure that will take us right up that we could even enter into Rapture and Faith because he say it will take more faith than ever to leave this world because you have to believe your mortal going to change your flesh going to change so that's not normal thing that's that's super stuff that's why he said Divine Healing he said we have to have that because how we can believe we can be changed now we can't have Faithfully Divine Healing a little thing oh praise God understand this Peter never did that before you know Silver and Gold Have I None such as I have I give even if the man didn't want the work he was giving him um do you want me to be healed do you ask me if you want to be healed no he said I come to I have something I want to give it to you I have it I could give it I own it I could give it it's a part of me I can handle it come on preach back to me somebody do you see the difference a blind man come to Jesus and Jesus God asked him what do you want me to do for you now you would say why would Jesus ask that he could see the man dying but yeah surely man want to see suppose he might want to bring the lottery supposedly desires he wants you to express what is upon your heart what it is you want me to do for you Lord that I might receive my sight and God give him a sight oh God what if God come on this morning to ask what do you want me to do for you that is today [Applause] come on give the Lord some Praises they didn't expect that one did you didn't expect that one did you hallelujah what do you want God to do for you today [Music] so what if we have a Car steering wheel in the completed diamond studs all over it engine was mechanically tested to be exactly right engine Wheels bearings greased up tires puncture proof blood free Sandy face to be tested pushed off assembly line both of them filled with gasoline that's running powered gasoline high octane but don't have any Spark no firing power taking pictures supported Instagram with your fancy girl move my Red Bicycle tricycle no driving past you the toddler with a tricycle passenger your shame yeah it can't move no battery no power but better you're shining I polish them with this mystery and he hitting them and destroying this side here and you put oh God the people say I never see it so I never see that shine my food moving just mechanics is that I don't care how much how much power is in the gasoline unless it has spark the Manifest that power there's a power to confirm that is ghastly is my will be water so we assure that gasoline yeah supposedly can but it's really water but it can Mark gasoline on it then the prophet said this no matter how much the theologians claim how well you've got your truth set how much education you got how much you like the Bible until the wave Chief until the Holy Spirit comes upon that person to Quicken that word the gustling the gasoline represent the word it's the truth but without the spirit it won't move and this is what I'm gonna get to we have put too much stress on the mechanics and nothing on the dynamic so from this service forward we want to press the dynamic button because we have an order here we put too much stress on the mechanic and nothing on the dynamic it needs the dynamic power of God the resurrection power of Jesus Christ upon the church the Manifest or to bring to pass that this is gasoline it might be in a gasoline can because it will be water the only proof of it is to put your life on it and it prove where genuine or not no no no but the Brandon says there's a far greater gift here would be the best what gift is the best the gift of the Holy Ghost of wisdom to put the word together to show the church where we are standing when you see this quote this word greatest gift to put the word together but in this season these are all the time in court because we have 40 plus years to put things together so if I come and talk about you know sayings you know what I mean to put the word together yeah wisdom to put the word together so we're doing last 40 years was putting on them ready to send bigger missiles and bigger bombs earthquakes what kind of issue America crumbling daily they were president like a Walking Dead America go on you know they already they're waiting for the sentence is this judgment hanging over America it's getting worse and worse and worse right the bright copy getting worse we have to be getting like Abraham strong and fate give him praise and glory to God watch notice the life that was in the husk in the stalk in the tussle or goddess of in the seed the light that was in the stalk one went to make the other justification made our way personification some vacation made a way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in Perfection and back to the wood again to manifest itself so the history of the seven Church ages is the history of the life of the plant a seed goes on into the ground the church started out it fell into the ground and up come Luther Wesley Pentecost God is going to bring it back to seed when the Holy Ghost came it brought the atmosphere for the sea to come in the Pentecostals who broke into the Holy Ghost age they rejected this message therefore they rejected the seed to bring them to adoption to make them please Sons so God had to leave the Pentecostals to come to you to find you wherever you are you have to find you to make the headstone or give the Lord I shout that he could come into it so you have to find you to make up this bright body in this last day that the spirit could come in oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah glory to God hallelujah hallelujah listen to this for my message dedication remember Solomon right there was no song of Muhammad was heard all the stones was cut out in their respective places not assembled in their places they were cut out separately independently and when they brought it together Solomon just fitted together it was the fitting of the stones to fit the building but God caught your right I

thing all the other Stone was of non-effect until then but this main Stone came in The Headstone and took its place positionally for its resting place for that generation and the glory of God filled the place where they were sitting and there was Shekinah Glory over the whole building and the glory was so great until the priest couldn't even minister because of the glory of God oh Hallelujah you no longer sermon was on the appendicos minutes man won the pump four and five hours it was 15 minutes on the day of Pentecost and people were convicted by the Holy Ghost but I'm gonna say five minutes in the presence of the pillar of fire thought Moses more than 40 years done with all the Mysteries he had done in Egypt Oh Glory to God for 40 something years Moses on the Wilderness Trail but when God hit him with that pillar fire they all he answer all the question was answered he know he had to go down he know he was still called he know he was anointed he know he was predestinated what God feel good about yourself this morning because the God will start to work in you he is going to finish it you know what Psalms 118 said I shall not die but live don't anoint not dead Spirit coming to

to say not everything nice and sweet he said the Lord I chase me so yeah you know he said the Lord are chasing me sure but he had not given me over into debt so that prayer is this thing craving is a victory according you always have to give you over the debt God call it a life God quality glory and future God call it the power how many believe that let the gray hair inside of you say Amen oh give the Lord I shout in the house Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Glory glory to God glory to God look at the four Patriarchs Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph Abraham calling Isaac election vice versa Abraham election Isaac Colin Jacob Grace Julie Perfection nothing against him that was God working its way out so watch what luta Wesley Pentecost the Capstone the church and the word becomes one Luther Wesley Patty pentagonal the Capstone oh my there you are this is a perfect man 70 changes seven steps God building his church is like one person into an individual into himself the power of God coming down to this welding it together therefore the Pentecost of people that let out the Lutheran let out the Western and things doesn't know what they're talking about they live in this part of the temple that's the way some people can come up high and stop off you remember the Bright Tree you remember the summer in the Bright Tree he pruned it watch and the way God is expecting us is individuals to grow is the way he brought the church to grow how did it bring his church to fit virtue knowledge just as he brought the church ages he's going to bring you so you're not an instant overnight Christian you grow in God you grow closer to God that's why things doesn't be working out all as you expect because you want oh God drumming closer to you give your faith oh God I need you I need more of you to give the virtue because in closer now knowledge Temperance patience goddess brotherly kindness Hallelujah then the Holy Spirit there is that God coming closer and my father or give the Lord some praises Oh Glory to God that you shall know how many fathers you and me and you no he's in you you're grueling God forming to the word image amen all right now let's go now Peter here says seven things Faith virtue knowledge and pronounce one patience goodness brotherly kindness add broadly kindness and then the love of God the Holy Ghost Christ here we go in the person of the Holy Ghost comes upon you in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost when they got all these virtues sealed into you so the true baptism really comes when you have all these things sealed in it must be sealed in because if it's not sealed in it can have leaks and Paul call love the bond of perfectness he call it charity which is the bundle for Fitness which is like a glue so when that anointing comes over you it's like a glue seals the whole building you are sealed in and the devil is sealed out the Holy Ghost has sealed in Satan is sealed out you are now anointed appointed and commissioned manifesting seven Living Voices manifesting seven spirits seven voices flowing through you oh give the Lord some praises Hallelujah there we go Christ in the person of the Holy Ghost comes upon you in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and you've got all these virtues sealed in you then God lives in a tabernacle called the building the living Tabernacle of the living God's dwelling place or when a man possesses these things then the Holy Ghost comes upon him then you can see the spirit and the bride have a voice could say come praise God in my right oh my Hallelujah so do you know it had to be cleansed do you know the mystery of the Revelation between Noah and the water it was the Earth getting a water baptism do you know that the hidden Mystery behind that water and the flood is what the Earth was getting the baptism of water when Jesus died and his blood fell to the Earth it was Sanctified but no fire it's promised for the earth to cleanse abbottom but we shall walk on the ashes of the wicked fire is going to come and burn the Earth not annihilated burn it cleanse it Hallelujah in the same way God treats the Earth he treats you because you are from the Earth we are off the Earth [Applause] shall return isn't that right so here with his part he said oh he said no this world is a good job the fire of God which cleanses the earth and the heavens are wrong then it is purchased so that the redeem can live on it live in peace notice the baptism of fire is to cleanse it from sin from sickness from disease Dooms from sinners from the devil and all his group he should be casting the Lake of Fire Holy Fire from God comes down from God under heaven and brings it up notice to make it ready for God to dwell in for God in a new world that is to come is a dwell on the earth because he said God he dwells in the human heart but he and the bride becomes one and they go to their home in the new world and the same Plan of Redemption is used to redeem both the world and the persons that live in it see here we go the heart has to be cleansed like that before God can come down in the person of the Holy Ghost which is Christ coming down and dwelling the human heart it must be repented it must be baptized in water in the name the show belongs to it must be cleansed by the blood of Jesus and then the Holy Fire and holy ghost from God from whom from God comes down and burns out all the desire of sin all the nature of the world oh do you believe that today just as God cleans the Earth he's going to cleanse your heart fire going to come Don't Be Afraid don't be scared this is what God promised Peter had it all them all them into fire and you're gonna go to fire also isn't that right all right out to your faith virtue after virtue knowledge to your knowledge Temperance Temperance patience patience godliness to your godliness brotherly kindness the burning kindness the Holy Spirit and Christ will come of course just believe him the holy spirit is the spirit of Jesus Christ into the church to manifest those virtues so he's showing here l-o-v-e you look at the pyramid here that's Lov love are you see it here just beneath him that that rainbow spot is Holy Spirit and that Holy Spirit coming to do what to manifest the virtues in you and that Lov represent Christ's coming isn't that right oh glory to God almost finished from since the time he said it might be closer than you think it got me scared I haven't done enough time shall be no more he announces the time is over what happens could that be so no Brethren seriously think if it is then the pyramid is kept by the seven tunnels so all of a sudden the Thunders become The Headstone the Thunder is now the Capstone the Thunder's no Capital pyramid the Thunders is now the stone the villain refused the Thunders and skies the power the Dynamics wait till them seven Thunders after the forces attacked poop size and cut the heavens or praise God if that be so then the pyramid is kept by the Seven Wonders who said that Brazil no Prophet said that if that is so then he went on to detail it you remember the premium message it is the Capstone what did it do the Holy Spirit capped off the individual and sealed it when we added to our faith righteousness and godliness and so forth we kept adding till we got seven things and the seven one was love which is God that's how he makes the individual he caps him and seals him with the Holy Spirit then if that be so he's got 78 ages that he added seven Mysteries and they fought forth to bring back and The Headstone comes the cap of the church does the tundas mean that my birthday does the Thunders mean that my bedroom is the cartoon that's connected to the virtues to the voices because the seven tons of seven voices of the seven churches seven live voices every age the Thunders overcome the devil would in Polish we beat them in Arena's age we give them licks and Martin age every age can number eight was blows Hallelujah areas

there he is Christ is that stone he wasn't born of man he was born of God he's coming for a church that has been reborn Again by the spirit of God caused the strength of that headstone runs all through the church like a magnet Hallelujah he said we have to be magnetized to the headstone and I wanted to get a big magnet to give a demonstration of that you know to wrap up national colors here

remember watching a big magnet Stone pick up all this craps because it was magnetized it we have got to be magnetized to the headstone are you ready The Headstone is the holy spirit Holy Ghost so The Headstone caps the pyramid the Thunders kept the pyramid The Headstone is the Holy Ghost the Thunder says the Holy Ghost the Thunder's in two parts revelation a manifestation he said what we see should make a church and to make a Revival that people fly from everywhere say the seven Thunders is being manifested oh my hallelujah oh glory to God what's the purpose of the Holy Ghost form to get and he revealed it as the shout when the bride Catch The Headstone I wonder if it's going to be the voice the voice of the Archangel because you protect Perfection to bring on the forces of Resurrection and Jesus does all three he does the shout he does the voice he does the Trump he did the show to William Branham is he going to do the Force Through The Bride because the spirit and the bride will have a voice this bridge in the Bible say come the bride will be representing Jesus Christ children Mrs Jesus Christ on the Earth the work that he didn't finish the Bible finish Shield their continuation of the works of Christ Oh Glory to God hallelujah I'm closing get a spot question and answers if the church is saved even though she does not go into the Rapture I believe you're taught she must go through the tribulation for purifying but what about those that are dead how will they be purified question here the answer the bride don't need no purification she's already purified and the dead back there they never receive the light that these Church up here have received they live under justification sanifications over like that they lifted the light that they had maybe no way they suffered whatever they went through with the position but now talk about us a lot of more Baptist method you don't want people in the message now talk about us but now in the Rapture in time like this there will come a time that the bride talking about the church that rejects the head part of the Bride will have to suffer for her rejection so he's saying the church in this message that rejected part of the Bible which is the headstone we'll have to suffer for that symptoms to the three and a half years tribulation because the gospel wasn't made plain to them bacteria I just made plain to you today you have it so plain you have all these years an example the series open the churches laid up plain and so plain you can't miss it if you fully reject it there's only one thing to do suffer for it I'm almost done you say what what he did he call out the elect to make up the lutherans he called it like ruled around the make of the wesleyans he could already let the make of the Pentecostals and now he's calling the elect Pentecostals to make the headstone to come into it you see what you're talking about now you dare without us and not made perfect so The Headstone brings on the completion of that Perfection so God calling you to make up this shape this Capstone that the spirit could come into it to raise up all them some Adam come right up oh there's gonna be a resurrection do you believe that final quote and I'm done I want you to notice he never said he should have been for the Cornerstone he shall bring for The Headstone we know the scripture says that Jesus Christ is the Chief Cornerstone he also is a headstone now everything for a few minutes that the seventh Church each messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers then he said in other words rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit not by power not by might not by but by my spirits here the Lord not my organization not by denomination but by the holy spirit will God bring for the church in the last days and I'm done listen to this carefully we have built churches groups fellowships by the word by mechanics but this is what we last hear already is a prophecy that the church will be rebuilt by the spirit it will take Dynamics to do that it will take the power to do that to rebuild the church again and he said when Revival hit the sisters came
