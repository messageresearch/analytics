lord that despite our failures our shortcomings lord you still see something in us lord that sea that you placed in us lord you could still connect it and you could call us so father we come tonight lord for this little bible study this time to have a conversation around your word lord to encourage your people to encourage ourselves in the word tonight lord we see what's unfolding around us we see the plans and movements of the enemy and lord we see what you are doing for your people so lord we are so grateful tonight to break the routine and the norm of what we could be doing tonight lord to enter into your presence we thank you lord for your sons and your daughters lord who have made it their business lord to be in fellowship lord where there are two or three gathered in your name lord it could be virtually it could be in different homes but we are connected tonight and we are gathered in your name lord you are the one who called us you are the one who found us lord your prophet taught us that lord we didn't find this message this message came to us you said it'll fall in the hands of the predestinated so father we commit this meeting into your hands may you bless the word lord may you take me out of the way lord and just encourage lord encourage your people lord may you lord take complete control lord so that lord it will be my own thoughts lord but it will be your word to encourage your people we commit the meeting into your hands in the precious name of jesus christ amen amen and amen well it's certainly a great privilege to be uh gathered here tonight uh by the grace of almighty god and um i was getting a bit of a challenge to connecting on the internet and whenever you see things like that happening you know that satan is mad and satan is trying to trying to to do all that he could do um but you know we have been in the book of revelation and we have been fellowshipping on these things and we understand that you know once you step into a book that the devil hates he is gonna do everything in his power to try to upset your weak to upset your day to do as much as he possibly can to to to distract you to frustrate you you know but we thank god and all these things we already have the victory and we serve a victorious god and we are so encouraged you know by what's unfolding because it's prophecy being fulfilled and we're excited because we didn't choose this walk this walk choose us you know and and that is such such a blessing um you know so like i always say when we come to bible study it's not a service it's an opportunity for us to fellowship around the world and maybe see something that we have not seen before or maybe we are reminded of what we did read or hear or study before but most importantly you know adam said when you talk about him he loves to draw near so we love to talk about him we love to for jesus to be the center of our joy the center of our focus the center of our conversation there's so much that's going around that is designed to distract us you know and it is such a privilege to be able to be called in such a time as this so i salute you all tonight and welcome you all tonight to this little bible study i don't i told over it tonight i i don't want to be too long because um this journey that we are we are on there are some points where i really want to kind of take our time a little bit and kind of touch on a few things um but before i even get into the teaching tonight i was uh really want to appreciate whether steven sent me something um you know about what's happening around the world and i'm i don't know if if you have kind of seen it and stuff like that but i i i had um nikola sitaram do some fact checking for me and and final kind of help me find the articles and stuff like that so i'm gonna try to do this and see if if it could work um to just kind of you know because at first when when somebody shared with me they said they don't if it's fake news or not but i wanted to take this opportunity just kind of point you to a few things you know uh so this is the 12th of january it was announced that kuwait cabinet members resign omit a dispute in parliament now that may seem like just one thing you know so and and if left in isolation it's just it's just another news article you know that may or may not draw your attention to what's going on so this is was announced on the 12th of january and then on the 13th of january the estonia's prime minister resigned over a corruption scandal over there in estonia this is january the 13th bear in mind we are now uh on the 19th day um of january and then two days later on january the 15th the russian government resigns as vladimir putin plans his future and in and around the same day on january 15 the dutch government resigned over child welfare fraud so in isolation it may seem as just news highlights but i'm showing a thread unfolding and and just another day later on the 16th of january of this very same year the government in guinea also resigned the prime minister basically submitted his resignation of his government to the president and then cnn article on january 17th uh cnn covers angela merkel the chancellor of germany saying that she's also going to step down now it's one thing if it's one story and certainly i haven't had a time to explore what's happening in every single country but this is now one two three four five six countries where we have these these different changes taking place and we stand here tonight on january 19th on the eve of january 20th when there is supposed to be another transfer of power as the new u.s president is scheduled to be sworn in on january 20th which is tomorrow and uh in the messenger stephen sent to me he was saying that you know it is it is subtle but it's there there's a transfer of power taking place there are movements and we have been talking about these forces and political movements and all these things happening and suddenly it almost appears as if is is this real how is it possible that in just 19 days in january you have multiple countries multiple situations multiple governments and we have been studying it through the world we have been preaching about it it is it is movements in the ecclesia the ecclesiastical realm movements in the financial realm and even here in trinidad and and many of us and this is the challenge with many of us we sometimes get so buried in our own situation our own challenge our own issues that that we don't even step back as as eagles because an eagle flies high to see what's going on to understand what is happening around it and right here in trinidad there are key phrases being bandied about there's a shortage of the us dollar there's the fact that to import goods and civil and products they did trinidad and tobago it requires the u.s dollar to pay and the shipping companies and the association would represent about 90 of all the important trinidad is requiring u.s dollars which already short to bring products in and already prices are rising and the government is talking about should they be value the currency and and all these things are having impacts and every single country has its challenge every single family has its challenge every single individual has its challenge what is it it's upheavals it shifts in what is going on and ultimately we know it as the whole creation is groaning and travailing for something because something is out of order that is about to get back into order so so the news reporters out there are reporting it from their viewpoint you know and and they could only see it from their angle you know um like i was listening to something this morning and somebody was saying if you want to describe a teacup and you look from a t look at a teacup from on top you know it may just look like two circles the circle of the teacup on the inside and the circle of the saucer on the outside and somebody could spend their entire time describing this is what they saw they saw a circle in a circle where there's just a top view of the teacup and another person could be seeing just the side of the teacup and they draw the shape of a teacup and and the challenge of it is this looking at the teacup from above or from the side both views are actually correct but it's not the whole picture let me see it one more time looking at a teacup from on top or looking at a teacup from at the side the person who is describing what they are seeing would both be correct he challenges they are not seeing the entire picture because the entire picture is a 3d picture to see the entire cup you cannot just see it from one side you need to get a three-dimensional view to see that the cup has so much more to it than this so we who are called as spiritual astronauts in this time have the insight through the reveal word through scripture to see what is unfolding before us and it's not to shake us it is to encourage us to show us that this gospel is in fact real that this message isn't real is it israel i remember the brahms spoke about all these things and the world powers and all these things coming into there when you see it in such quick succession happening in front of us it is certainly a sign to us an encouragement to us that our time of leaving this place is coming to be soon and it's an encouragement to us that we are going to leave here shouting and victorious because the same way that there's a transfer of power that is required in all these different countries there's also a more important transfer of power that is taking place as born sons filled sons place sons take their position of power you know so so all of what is happening it's just a smokescreen hallelujah it's just a smoke screen for the real transfer of power because the god of this evil age is is losing his grip on this world is getting loosed because sons and daughters are coming into a realization of who they are and the moment she gets to know who she is the moment these sons take their place and and and the fullness of the power that's predestinated for us is now dwelling in adopted sons places oh you haven't seen anything yet so i wanted to encourage you tonight as i always say lift your head up square your shoulders god is not finished with you he's in fact he's only getting started so i want to encourage you he who started to work in you he is more than able to finish you the work this is a a real gospel it's a practical gospel it is something to put your life is to impact your house your family your situation only the god i know can heal all of the pieces of your life anybody with me tonight this message is a message of healing you know it it could heal your story it could change your story you know what i was saying with brother ovid you know i i love to read i love to listen i love i love i love development you know and i say some of these things we could talk about in these studies uh they they give a bit more flexibility but i love progress i love change and i was listening to something uh you know and i encourage you you have to find ways to to to how you want to improve you know so one of the things that i do personally when i'm driving i try to listen to audiobooks because you're trying to redeem time this world has so much things going on that if you don't find ways to hack your time so to speak you're going to be left behind and and then the speaker was saying that you know no animal could transform itself a dog is a dog the dog not trying to be a cow a cow is a cow the corner trying to be a horse you know animals are what they are a bird is a bird a fish is a fish but he said man is the only being that has the ability to transform himself he has the ability to move from not knowing to knowing so you may not know spanish but if you decide in your heart you want to learn spanish you can move from not knowing spanish to being fluent in spanish if the desire in you is great enough anybody with me you can transform yourself from somebody who doesn't save into somebody who budgets and saves you could transform yourself by your decisions by your thoughts by your actions to somebody with no prayer life to somebody who has a prayer life anybody with me tonight you could transform yourself from not knowing and just by picking up a book you could change from not knowing about something to knowing about something else anybody with me and and this gospel that we preach that jesus brought was a gospel of transformation he took peter from a man who was going after natural fish and that man peter was transformed from going after natural fish to being fishes of men anybody with meat tonight all right so gosh a god of transformation he took a man named moses who had a speech impediment oh my wouldn't say i can't talk he took that man with a speech impediment and make him and make him a prophet that could lead the entire revolution what would happen tonight if god's desire for transformation connects with your desire for transformation anybody with me oh hallelujah what will happen because god wants us to change he said be transformed by the renewing of your mind some of our minds are messed up you know you know whenever your computer run into a problem they say reboot the computer as as as as as i was trying to connect to this service tonight a message brother over to say my internet giving some trouble i'm going to reset the router because i don't know what happened to the router but if i if i reset the router it it restarts the the the connections i don't understand the mechanics of it but i know the dynamics part now when i hit the reset button that thing starts all over again and it has worked different when i reset it so i went and i reset the router why brother anthony was singing i want to come back the connection i have now is different from what i had when i was trying to speak a little earlier anybody with me tonight so the bible said be transformed by the renewing or the resetting or the rebooting or the recalibrating of your mind so that the connection that you have with your heavenly father you have a better connection sometimes the connection we have does be sticking i don't know i feel good you have to forgive me sometimes the connection with the father does be sticking but when you renew your mind you reset some of the ideas that you've been working with some of the approaches you've been working with and you reset it back to the factory settings that was there before there was a world before there was a moon before there was a star the original factory settings the original plan that god has for you because but the branham taught us god doesn't leave us we are the ones who leave him but if you want to find him get back to where you left him anybody with me tonight you could blame anybody you could blame this one you could blame that one but we're not playing the blame game tonight we want to look at ourselves we want to look at ourselves and look at the word this is not about the person next to you there's another body person next to you in the zoom room or the person next to you in the church pew or the person next to you in the house this is about you looking at your word and looking at yourself and trying to see okay what do i need to do to be changed what do i need to do to be different all right so i'm i'm yielding tonight it's this feels like a different kind of bible study but but but but we are in the word all right because nothing that we're saying tonight is out of order and we want to be so connected with what the world has for us so by the grace of god tonight we we want to continue uh from last week where we started a study on the book of revelation study of revelation uh part one is where we went to last week and by the grace of god we want to go a little further and just kind of touch a few points and kind of encouraging people remind the church you know of a few things and and and you know everything that we're sharing we could find in the prophet's message and through scripture so i encourage you friends the word is your strength you know and and and you have to get more passionate you have to it has to become a passion to you it has to be a passion for you to live this word you know it must become your joy the joy of the lord as your strength all right so we want to start in the book of revelation uh chapter two we would have spent some time in revelation one last week we have talked about john and we know that john has a type of the bride we understood that he was on the isle of patmos he was not there by his own choosing he didn't apply to go there he was not there on vacation he was not there on retirement he was there because they accused him of being a witch after they attempted to fry him and they realized he was unfriable i know that's not a word but he was unfriable after they put him to fry and they thought that he would be fried and boiled whatever you want to say about it they recognize that this man not going down and and and and and they basically throw their hands and say send them to patmos you know that is when they get frustrated because they attempt to kill him field and when the attempts to kill him field they sent him in a place that they thought he would just shrivel up you know and and and when the attempts at the enemy fail to kill you know the devil will only try to frustrate you but in in sending john into a place of of of hard and and and and a rough situation it was there that god came to john in his rough place in his dry place in a in a place where he was among people who who may have deserved to be there because he didn't deserve to be there but yet in that place god was able to speak to him so i want to encourage you tonight whatever place you're in it is it is not by accident it is not by chance because god doesn't give us more than we could pay this this this gospel that we preach this message is is riddled with things that we may never understand because only the things that are revealed belongs to us but we do know one thing that trials and testings and oppression and persecution and being hated is all part of the territory that's why the bible say think it not strange when you when you meet some fiery trial don't don't think it's a strange thing don't don't feel like you're surprised about it when you meet a fiery trial because because this is not supposed to be strange to us um you know so i want to encourage you tonight if you're in a fiery trial you're in a good place because it's not a strange thing we should be familiar with fairy trials we should be comfortable in fiery trials anybody with me tonight so let's go revelation 2 and verse 1 unto the angel of the church of ephesus right these things saith he that hold it to seven stars in his right hand who walk it in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks revelation two verse one i want to read it one more time unto the angel of the church of ephesus right these things say that he that hold it the seven stars in his right hand who walk it in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks i want to read it from the amplified because the amplified pulls out some words there that i kind of like to amplify on if i could use that so the amplified says to the angel divine messenger so so so it even gives a bit more clarity that there's a divine messenger of the church in ephesus these are the words of the one who holds firmly the seven stars so firmly the seven stars meaning these stars aren't arbitrarily held they are not randomly chosen or randomly held which are the angels or messengers of the seven churches in his right hand the one who walked among the seven golden lampstands or the seven churches now brother branham in the ephesian church age for those who have read it this will be somewhat of a refresher for those who have not read it um i encourage you to go into it and those who have read it read it seven more times because all of these things are true to us because we know through the prophet's message he said there has to be an ephesians to this he said the ephesian church was the first church the ephesian church was the template what was said there would have lasted throughout all ages and he spoke of all the church ages from ephesus to laodicea and these seven church ages or these seven churches were seven gentile churches that were physically located in asia minor but he said these seven churches were not just geographical or physical or local churches but they were also spiritual conditions they were also dispensational ages there were many things that he identified about these seven church ages that was that bridge between the time that god had given to the jews and at the ending of this gentile dispensation that he would get back to the jews again so brother branham was speaking about ephesus as a church and we're going to pull out a few things but brother branham also brought out that there were three major locations where christianity flourished firstly was jerusalem which is understandable second was antioch and third was ephesus ephesus we know at some point it was pastored by paul and we know that paul is the messenger of that age paul in traveling would have left timothy and we have touched these teachings in the past timothy would have been the first bishop almost the first pastor of that ephesus church all right and brother branham and bringing these things out he said that first verse of scripture unto the angel speaking about paul of that first church that church that was a template you know and brother branham and speaking about the condition of ephesus he went to touch on certain things that was unique about that specific church he spoke about how subtle the enemy operated in that age because that age was the strongest of ages you know whenever branham drew it all out he drew with the the light shrinking until this last aid was almost blacked out completely so the most light would have been in that first age but he said the presence and the subtle move of the enemy was there in the first age but the branham and ephesian church you could read it i'm just touching some highlights he would have talked about spoken about how they did temple worship in that day and how they had an image of the goddess diana that was not as bright or as clear or as beautiful as it normally would be and it was almost like it was a reduced version of the deity but yet still what was unique about it is that it was but it said it was almost shapeless and the fact that it was shapeless he said it depicts the spirit of the antichrist loosed in the midst of the people with no shape to alarm the people so he was painting this picture that the conditions that existed there that was subtle he said the two arms were of iron that it was the intent to crush the work of god as he made inroads and no one seemed to notice what was happening so i'm just painting a picture of the context before we even advance further and we're not going to be too long into this but it made them goes on to talk about all the rituals that existed in that day the priestesses and the high the man of political power this was what was existing while christianity was there these were all of the the underlying elements that were stirring at that time that was slowly beginning to creep into what was happening in the church now brother branham said as well in that first verse that he was he was speaking to paul the messenger of the age and we know from teaching that paul was the gold standard and the more as i look at this and i realized he said he holds seven stars in his right hand so we know that these seven stars are seven messengers seven men we know them paul irenaeus martin columba luther wesley and brother branham and the more i look at it and the more that i see how brother browner was painting this picture of these two elements he is hauling these seven stars and he amplified it says firmly and by firmly means he he's not gonna risk letting it go he has a very tight hole and these seven stars these these seven men these seven men are important to him so i want to nail down because in ephesians we'll see it later in this age when we talk about how they hated the deeds of the nicolaitans the reality was god in his mind had an order with how he was going to restore so god in unfolding these church ages in dealing with these churches and it's relevant to us because it is still unfolding even till now he hand-picked these seven men so paul was the only one that god was dealing with in this measure in that age i want to say it one more time and but the branham made it clear that paul was the gold standard by which every other messenger who would come after paul would be measured anybody with me so it means that paul irenaeus martin they were all approximating to that gold standard which was established with ephesus as the church the ephesians church and the messenger of that age so i want to raise a question tonight then because as we dig deeper into this we recognize that even in this conversation about god and the seven stars there's no other men being mentioned there i want to be careful in saying this so as i look further meaning it doesn't matter what ministry you had in the days of paul paul's ministry was the only star the same way in our age there's only one star to our age i don't care how gifted somebody is how much they know what they could expound i'm not a star in the context of these seven stars anybody with me the role of star was being expressed to john god already made up his mind anybody with me tonight who these stars were god was settled in his heart who these stars were what they were supposed to do what their makeup was going to be what their nature was going to be how they were going to minister what they had to endure so i find it very difficult that we could be students of the scripture and students of these message and find anybody who could even approximate these seven stars because this is a class all by itself it's only seven stars are being held in your right hand behind the power of god like these men anybody with me no pastor teacher evangelist even prophet outside of these seven men could even qualify to be one of the seven stars those seats have been filled i want to establish it clearly the fact that those seats have been filled and the purpose to be achieved by these seven men have been fulfilled mean that work of these seven men are complete anybody with me i want to nail it down because there is an and to bring it to context to present the present tense people look to their local church and their local pastor or ministers in different places with a certain level of of adoration and adulation that cannot equate when you place these stars where they should be because if you are not careful you will give more honor to gifts that would now displace the role that god himself placed with these seven stars anybody with me i'm nailing down something here because these seven stars from paul all the way to brother branham these it wasn't eight stars he had in his hand it wasn't ten stars he had it wasn't ten seven stars and some secondary stars and some tertiary stars and these were other stars in case this star didn't make it clear and no no no no no no only seven stars of which paul was the original the template the model and this paul was so clear in that first you see if an angel from heaven come and preach any other gospel or any secondary revelation from what i preached let him be accused and the attitude the strength the answer the anointing the power that these seven men operated with there's nobody could even approximate to these men anybody with me tonight doesn't it make you deeply appreciative of the prophet and his message to our day the reason i want to nail this down church is that there are messy churches who have lost the prophet has lost his place in their churches because that's how men's ideas begin to flourish and men's interpretation begins to forage and men's ideas begin to flourish anybody with me tonight all right so i want to nail this down because once we get this foundation and you get it as a revelation then nobody can shake you so brother branham said it this way in ephesian churches in that right hand of power our seven stars who according to revelation 1 20 that we read last week are the seven church messengers this signifies that the very power and authority of god are behind his messengers to every age they go forth in fire and power of the holy ghost with the word they are stars because they reflect light the light they reflect is his light they have no light of their own and that's why i want to be careful because listen we had a light that was reflecting his light i have no message you know this i am feasting on the reflection of the light hallelujah that came from him through that star so we cut your credit for what we bringing out tonight you can't take credit for what you're hearing or what you know because it we are beneficiaries of the divine plan of god to place seven stars in his right hand listen to the prophet they kill not their own fires that men may walk in the light of their sparks you know how many people i've heard in the message say well it's my revelation and and this is what my revelation is and my revelation this sh this shuts that down eh when people say step like revealing what the prophet never revealed and it an opening mysteries that the prophet never opened you see how dangerous and and how that road could lead you down to anybody with me listen to the prophet these seven messengers are making god known to the people he that received them received him that sent them he stands behind them with all the power of the godhead hallelujah my my my mind so we're still in verse 1 unto the angel of the church of ephesus right these things say that he that hold it the seven stars now we know who that he is it is the lord jesus christ himself holding the seven stars in his right hand who walk it in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks but abraham said that these seven gold and casting we know are the seven churches in the seventh ages and listen to the prophet notice you will notice now you know that is walking alone in the midst of his churches he said there's no one else with him he alone is walking through his churches he is walking through this room tonight he is walking through every age but abraham said what he was in the first age he is to all ages to every believer he is jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever we still in verse 1. he said no one else is with him neither indeed can there be for he alone wrought her salvation and having purchased her with his own blood he owns her he is her lord and master she gives him all the glory and that glory he will not share with another so this walking through the church ages is the lord jesus himself walking through every age and walking through now every church anybody with me listen to the prophet there's no pope with him there's no arch bishop with him mary the mother of his earthly bodies not with him he does not speak and turn to a father for he is the father he doesn't turn to give orders to the holy spirit for he is god eternal spirit and it is his life that is flowing and pulsating in the church giving her life and without him there would be no life anybody with me there was no one with him when he tried the fierceness of the wrath of the fiery furnace it was not another but him who hung up on the cross and gave his blood he's the author and finish of our fate he's the alpha and omega of our salvation we are exposed to him and not another we don't belong to a church i'm really profiting him we don't belong to a church we belong to him his word is law creeds dogmas bylaws and constitutions have no effect on us yes it is jesus alone who walks in the midst of the churches it is god in her willing and doing of his good pleasure never forget that you have only one relationship to god and god has only one relationship to you that is jesus anybody with me all of this friends is to make sure it is clear in your mind what god is doing how he's unfolding himself and how critical no more than ever it is about that personal relationship with god let's move on a little bit brother branham and i want you to catch this who walking in the midst of the seven golden can we still in verse one how meaningful are those words the prophet said when viewed in the light of the scripture which described him as christ who is our life for christ indeed is the life of the church she has no other life without him listen carefully she is simply a religious society a club a meaningless gathering of people i want to nail that down again because i was sharing it and i've shared it many times it don't matter how much programs you have it don't matter how much thing you have and you try to do this and do that and do that if christ is not in the hearts if he's not moving through the church if you're not seeing his power all the activities wasting time because only he can bring change you cannot program change the change we want is not program change it's not it's not because we train you to mark your marching it has to be him do any change anybody with me tonight hallelujah my my my my mind so unto the angel of the church of ephesus right these things say that he so is placing him in qatar so we understand who is speaking it could have said these things say the lord jesus christ but but the way it is being expressed is to place context on the magnitude of what is being said saying he that holds the seven stars in his right hand and who walk it in the midst of the seven goal and canceling now let's go on i know thy works and i labor undy patience and how thou cans not dear them which are evil and has strived them which say they are apostles and are not and has found them liars that's a heavy verse right there i want to read it in the amplified i know your deeds and your toil and your patient endurance and that you cannot tolerate those who are evil and have tested and critically appraised those who call themselves apostles and the abba fight said special messengers personally chosen representatives of christ you see anybody say well i am the one that you have to be careful in and in fact are not and have found them to be liars and imposters this is amplified hallelujah now when i first read this and and i love how brother branham addressed it but when i first read this because when you read this passage from revelation 2 from 1 to seven it reads in a certain structure it identifies who is speaking who is being addressed the subject of what is being addressed then it goes into it is almost like it's a performance appraisal for those who who who are in jobs where there's a performance review the typical performance review takes the form of these are the things you do well these are the things you need to improve and these are the goals i'm giving you to be able to reach where you need to reach typically that's how our performance review goes and and any good manager would take a certain format because if i come at you with all the things you're doing wrong first you would not really be too receptive but if i speak to you firstly about what is positive about your work ethic what is positive about how you operate then you would have a uh you would be more receptive for when i want to tell you well now that i know you've been coming to work on time and and and you have been submitting your reports and and and you don't really just take random days and and all these good things i want to address this little issue that we observe about your your performance and now that we address this issue now i want to give you our goal all right so that is exactly what is structured here it says i know your works and then it goes into later on we'll get to it nevertheless i have some issues with you and then it ends off with he that overcome it which is if you hit these objectives if you hit these targets if you overcome these obstacles that you're going through there's going to be a reward anybody with me so brother branham also said it like this he said how beautiful the savior praises and commands his children now the core of this teaching is really god is going after the issue to address because if you come to church and i only tell you you're good you're good you're good you're good there's no change of behavior so you have to know what is being done well and then more importantly what you're really coming to church for is to find out how to improve you want to know what any good employee wants to know give me feedback yes i want to know what i'm doing well but i'm more interested in what i need to improve because if i don't improve i can find myself on the list of people to go home anybody with me tonight and it's the same way but abraham said how beautiful the savior praises and commends his children he takes full account of their fine spiritual attitudes and behavior listen he knows that there is weakness among them but as yet he doesn't cry out against it as a student of management this is so better than the only textbook i ever read and before my review because god knows there's an issue but he's approaching it a certain way he said i know your works hallelujah i see what you're doing i see you showing up in bible study i see you making an effort to be the premier team i see you're paying your tithe i see you making an effort to connect to the live stream i see you testifying i i see you read a little scripture there i see you making an effort he said i know your works and i labor and by the event said that labor is under the pressure and the toil he says is is labor signifies awareness true oppression is there anybody who has some wariness true oppression don't show my razor answer god's people [Music] hallelujah glory so here it is you say i know your works i see your labor and your patience you're enduring you're in a message a long time you're holding on you have seen a lot you have endured or not and and and this description applies now because this is describing bride of that day but also it's an attribute or a description of bride in general so so the bride's supposed to be able to show works the bride's supposed to be able to have their labor the bride's supposed to have patience and and i want to kind of drill down here now because i believe in bringing it personal i don't want to see it as is the ephesians age and this is bright no so you you as a person me as a person does god know your works couldn't can he say he know your works have you done enough work for him to know your work you know when your boss going through the company and you want to know who are the top performers anybody with me tonight you have some people who there's they'll be working but but dear really doing anything to get recognized then but here god is saying i know your work fame to know your works it means your work is not recognizable it is like cornelius a vile stored up of his prayers it it got recognized it got attention he he broke through something that created a level of recognition it is like when the sons of skiva tried to cast out them spirits and and and the devil said but wait a minute paul i know peter i know but who but who are you they were unknown so so can it be said about you as a believer tonight that your works are known what you do for the lord is known what you do for the kingdom is known it can be recognized it can be identified or are you in the army and you're never sure enough for duty i know thy works and i labor you're under pressure you're under pressure in your home but you're not giving up you're under pressure in your marriage but you're not giving up you're under pressure with your children but you're not giving up and that is recognized it's it's under the oppression by the brandon said wherein is true oppression yes we get tired but i know that i labor because despite the labor your prayer is still coming up your worship's still coming up you're going through hard times but because you are a contrarian which means you're moving different from how other people expect it to move it it is something that i could recognize and thy patience that that that patience is enduring holding on you know there's a promise of change you know there's a promise of the holy ghost you know there's a promise of making it but you're patient you haven't seen it yet in your life but you know it's a reality and it will settle for nothing less so you want it and it be impatient you will not accept nothing less so you cannot be partly satisfied so you remain in patience don't want to get this part and how though can't not bear them which are evil now but the brandon went into this at length and i immediately time to go into it but but was painting a picture that that church was so on point that they couldn't stand to bear them did which were evil he said they would throw them out they had a certain standard and and and this reminds me a bit of of you know what the bible say in isaiah i believe in in ezekiel sigh and cry for the abomination in other words some of us have become too tolerant of evil we have lost the sensitivity to what is wrong and what god hates because god was in this scripture giving credit to the fact that you can't bear them which are evil in other words you are resisting the evil we're not talking about be you know oppressive or disrespectful to people and throughout my house but it's an attitude it's a it's a mindset it's coming from the heart because you want to live a certain way you want to love the things that god loves and hear the things that god hates but for you to slide and fall back into the world it means you were not resisting this evil enough anybody with me tonight is this is this connecting to anybody let's continue and thou has tried them which say they are apostles and are not and has found them liars i like how the amplified brings this out and have listened and have tested one and critically appraised those who call themselves that's a distinction because people could call themselves anything call themselves apostles and in brackets the amplified clarifies what that means it means special messengers and personally chosen representatives of christ in other words in other words there are people that are going around saying they are the ones who are officially representing the kingdom that you can only go to that church or only listen to that pastor or is the person listen this this car fit into this sinner and and more than that tested and critically appraised brother branham said it sounds blunt to speak about it but he said the word has to test it you cannot be afraid to test if i'm saying something tonight that is out of scripture out to the world you must but if i don't give an order to to do it it gives a way to handle these things but i am not your absolute the absolute has been established as you were jesus christ is the absolute not listen carefully the way brother branham describe it he says the stars have no light of their own so even the star is not even the absolute the absolute is the light because it starts reflecting the light so the the light is the absolute the word is the absolute so no pasta could be the absolute only word is the absolute the only way the pastor could speak as absolute is if what he is saying is a perfect reflection of the light because that absolute has to be his absolute anybody with me now the only way you could test and critically appraise is you have to be a good student because you cannot test me or anybody or critically appraise me or anybody if you here said another good student but he's saying that listen to these description of the quality of the believers in that day and it's a challenge for us all to understand our day understand our message understand the purpose understand what god has fought for i know the works so they were not just doing works i know they are labor they were not just had labor and struggling and oppression and their patience and and not only did they withstand evil and couldn't bear evil but they tried them they brought a trial them would say they are apostles and they are not and has found them to be liars how can you find somebody to be a liar you have to bring it back by by the word this is not you walking wrong saying you lie you lie i believe it that is not what we're talking about here you know but the brandon made it clear it has to be by the wood so for you to try by the word test by the word you must become this word you must live this word you must know this word it is written it is written it is also written that is why these sessions are so important for us as believers and i'm saying for us because me spending time in this listen i am born and grew up in this message i just turned 40 years old i'm just as strong as i was when i was one but i feel like i'm seeing stuff in the message that that listen every day i read it's like a new thing you know and it's not that it's new but it's more light and it's in the prophet's message but the problem is people are not reading the bible they're not reading the prophet message they're not in his spirit you can't read it like a novel anything we read it last week you have to come here any spirit and when i show you look what happened in in germany look what happened in estonia look what happened in guinea look what happening in in all these different countries look what's happening here in trinidad and you want to trust and lean on your own understanding and lean on the government and lean on all these other things that's going on that crumbling rapidly you have to know how do i fit in in this great divine plan of god how is god going to use me as a piece of his divine strategy in this final great climax that is unfolding anybody with me i'm trying to finish this first thing before we close out tonight and i see in my clock racing a little bit so burst three so not only so so so so this is still called the the positive attributes of the age verse 3 and has born and has patience and for my namesake has labored and has not fainted i want to read it in the amplified and i know that you who believe do we have believers here tonight do we have any believers here in the house tonight so this is jesus himself speaking and you know what it is to be getting an appraiser from jesus because as we read last week this is the only book of you by the bible that's written this way where jesus is actually writing the bible through his scribe john and he's expressing himself to each age and to the messenger of each age and by the brand i'm saying this is not just to that age it's to all ages all right listen to verse three and i know that you who believe are enduring patiently let that be your testimony we are enduring peacefully we will not give up we will not backslide we will not become too far to turn back now i don't care what happens i don't care who leaves who jumped who danced it doesn't matter we are enduring patiently and if this is not that we'll keep this until that come but we know what we're looking towards because this ephesian church started on the day of pentecost hallelujah what they had but abraham taught us that the promise of the holy ghost the promise of power the promise of dynamics is just as real tonight it's just as real as on the day of pentecost and we are not accepting a substitute i'm not accepting an explanation and interpretation unfolding of some idea about it i want the real thing there's a real dollar i don't want to account with it my family has to come back that is the real thing come on now my house have to be delivered that's the real thing he said in blessing i would bless thee that's the abrahamic blessing and not accepting nothing less hallelujah wherever you put your foot is yours that he promises and these are the promises that by these promises we become partakers of his divine nature anybody with me tonight is this encouraging to your soul in every area of your life and and i wanted to i wanted i kind of went ahead there's something else i wanted to kind of just drop this in here i wanted to rewind a little bit because this this was important because this there are some super spiritual message believers who who i want to get this one to be super spiritual believers but i branham in addressing how god is unfolding this scripture he was saying the way god addressed it by identifying the positive first he said we could all learn a good lesson right here in running the church and our families i love that because many over the years in the message ruined their families by such abject legalism and a lack of spiritual understanding that was made clear by the prophet so he said this approach so how you approach somebody if you walk into somebody and they say you know you're wrong you're wrong you're wrong you're wrong how will that be effective god himself to operate so god took an approach he said i know your works he had all the positive thoughts before he was at address this is what you need to improve this is where i need to work on anybody with over with me i want to make the point but the brandon was dropping in here this is not just for churchill you say for your family i'm better still the prophet continued there still in ephesians 3 i'm reading we could all learn a good lesson in that god deals with each one of us in exactly this way so don't ever be discouraged saint of god for god is not on gracious to forget your labors of love whatever we do even giving a cup of cold water to someone has a reward and a blessing from the lord don't lose these simple things don't lose these simple aspects of our christianity of our experience because christianity is not it's not about a doctrine and a belief on a connection it's about living something we talk about to be like jesus we want to be like him we want to live like him we want to operate in his way all right so again i know that you who believe are enduring patiently and are bearing up for my name's sake not the church sikh not the pastor seek it is for his name sake you know i want to be clear on this if you don't have the anger and the reason because if there's anything else outside of his name's sake when the wind blows your backslide when the wind blows your walkery message when you win blows you give up when you build it you say you can't believe because your faith was resting on the man he was doing it for man's sake all right and i know you who believe i'm anniversary are enduring patiently and are bearing up for my name's sake and that you have not grown wary of being faithful to the truth i cannot be wary of being faithful to the truth all right so let's go on verse four nevertheless so now this is where this is where he's starting to address the issue the issue nevertheless in other words after i've said all that i've said after i've spoken about all your efforts after i've spoken about how long in your message and what you have done and how many testimonies you gave and how much time you share and how many books you're handed out and how long you believe and how you fight for defeat and how you contended for after you do all of that nevertheless you're still standing we we are jubilant about that that will not be forgotten it will be rewarded but nevertheless i have somewhat against thee because thou has left my first love so this is where jesus now begin to address the issue and by the branham tied it into he said the fervent desire to please god not a desire to please god or no a full-on desire he qualified the desire to please god not please your wife not please your husband not please the church not please your boss not please your plan not please your expedition a fervent desire to please god a passion the person to know his word this is in the ephesians tradition i'm reading the cry for reaching out in the spirit all begins to feed that is the issue that started in that church in ephesus and instead of the church being on fire with the fire of god it has cooled off and become a bit formal people sit on there they come to church today they any message they they they know they read church they read seven seals they they they're reading mysteries mysterious mysterious people royal priesthood and and and and there's no further desire to please god there's no passion to know his word there's no cry to be in the spirit reaching out in the spirit no praise no worship it become formal formal means it's planned it's expected it's it's set up a certain way it's it's it's a routine that was the issue that was there but that is what was happening back there to the ephesians they were getting a bit formal the abandoned men to god was dying out and the people weren't too careful about what god taught of them as they began to be careful about what the world taught of them are we guilty of this tonight where we we're not really worried about what god said about it but we're more concerned about what the co-workers say or what somebody else say this was what was creeping in creeping in but ibrahim said to understand this you must realize that the spirit is not speaking to the original saints of ephesus alone so it's a challenger cry to us tonight have you left your first love is the fervent desire to please god there i've seen people sit down any message for years and this happens happen and they become so disenchanted there are no quotes there are no tapes they know this and some sit in moses seat they could mark everybody papers this one's wrong this one's wrong and your own life your own desire to please god is not there you know which church doing it this way you know which pastor of the world you know this this is this is this but you as an individual because this is that age of individuals nowhere i'm taking present tense i'm speaking to you i'm speaking to me i have to look at myself tonight is what is my desire like do i have a full-on desire to please god am i concerned if god is pleased is it important to me if god is pleased is he pleased is he pleased with how i live today is he pleased with what i did how i how i spoke today yesterday are my plans pleasing to god is my attitude pleasing to god is my approach pleasing to god because the moment that loses its importance then that is the sign of moving away from your first love that first love that that first love that spark of relationship that exists at that point where everything that is important to god is your is your priority people who came to the message years ago that was eminent they hunted for books when last you read a book unless you sat down with a book and said wait a minute let me sit down and read a book not watching news not taking politics passion to know his word not to know his word or uh okay so we thankful for the unfolding of the word in this way but you have a personal passion so you're not waiting for a bible study you're not waiting for a sunday service you're not waiting to hear tape you hunting for yourself because you want to find you you want to know your scriptures anybody anybody with meat tonight i want this to resonate because the revival has to start with you do you ever start in your home you should have a prayer meeting every single night friday is corporate prayers the whole church is coming together but but that is just on top that is like icing on top of the cake but you have cake the friday break everything covered your whole prayer life the bible said it could be your whole bible study is this is this the only effort because passion and fervent when i see somebody passionate about something fulfilled about something there's a certain attitude you know you can't wait to do something i remember years ago i was in school and i had this little computer game in primary school and listen whole time in school there thank god i was a good student but i couldn't wait to get home to play the game i couldn't wait to get home i just couldn't wait to get home the moment school done is and i was living close to school straight for the computer and that game you can stay there for hours and hours playing you didn't have to tell me to go and play the game my parents say isaac you want to go play the game you'd have to encourage me i want to do it i was having a good time playing the game you have to remind me to do it ask my dad ask my mom books i love reading when i was a kid they had to come in room two o'clock in the morning isaac take off you lie go and sleep you have school in the morning take all the light go and sleep it was a passion to read in general ashamed my own testimony until there was a book so i i think i shared last week i was 12 years old when i read the two changes it wasn't i was at the time i wasn't trying to read it to its ages you know there was a book i wanted to read and my dad said you're not reading that book until you read it ages so are ready for changes because i wanted to read the next book and i thank god he had the wisdom to unfold that way because certain things at age 12 stuck with me but the point is when you're passionate about something it makes you operate a certain way and all of us we know the things we're excited about sports the news the politics during this last election here that unfold in the u.s and that people in trinidad more glued to the news that people in the united states it had more political analysts i'm sure in trinidad and in the united states not just any natural not even any message and the amount of time they spent analyzing the vote and the electoral college if they had spent that time reading the church it is again reading the seals again reading why we are so tossed about reading letting all the pressure they will be under much less pressure tonight but it's a passion so i want us as we explore this because we can't get it all true tonight but i want you to see how easy it is to slip away and it becomes casual and this is what the prophet is painting of what took place it became casual it become well tomorrow's situation is a live stream service so we just connect and then friday's prayer meeting and it becomes it becomes a routine because a pattern and you lose the sincerity of a fool desire to please god the passion to know his word the cry for reaching out in your spirit don't let it fade friends but abandon that is the history of the church when it thinks more of conformity to the world instead of conforming to god it isn't long until you see them stop doing things they used to do and start doing things they did they wouldn't do initially they changed their manner of dress so with a brand i'm going deeper and if he's a church age on they're falling away their attitude and their behavior they get lacks that is what it means relax drifting the cycle of revival of amber abandon goes on i can't get into all of it tonight but i want us to see that what took place in that age is unfolding even in our age and especially as we come into the end that's why we're seeing a great falling away because people have gotten tired and they got frustrated and this brother do this and then and because they're looking at man so much they now judge their behavior and they conduct well if brothers so and so could do it and if sisters so and so could do it well who is me and we have a word template to match let me try to close off here listen to verse five remember therefore from whence though i've fallen that is powerful in the amplified it is to remember the heights from which you have fallen that's powerful enough you and and listen this is not just contextual for your own personal experience you know the heights for us in our day is going back to the days of the prophet being here and the magnitude of the world and power being expressed and the clarity of it being expressed and to see how cheese have fallen from the absolute and the plum line that the prophet laid up that is a heights and we can look even further back to the height and they are pentecost it is not god's fault you know come on now it is not god's fault what has transpired it is man who gets in the way for their own agenda remember therefore from when they were fallen and repent so even here we're seeing the opportunity the space of grace being unfolded that there's a way to get back hallelujah there's an opportunity to get back there's an approach to get back repent and do the first works repent and do the first work doesn't it song like cain and abel does this song like if you do what your brother do does this song there is a right wing to do things and if there's a right way why would he do something else or else so he gives a condition so remember therefore from when someone had fallen in the amplifier they say remember the height so make sure i fall and repent listen to the amplified change your inner self your own way of thinking your sinful behavior seek god's will that's i'm really amplified can i read that one more time so remember the heights on which you have fallen and repent and it says change your inner self this is not change your wife change your child change your pastor changing church this is you i'm speaking to individuals looking at me tonight i think two weeks ago i preached if you have such a situation with your children it is far easier to pray for the strength to deal with it for god to change your perspective of it because ultimately you don't have the power to change them but god could change you he could deal with them you can change your children god is the one to change them but your inner self how you approach things how you process things how you analyze things and the curse that has been impacting so many of us where people have influenced our thinking and it hasn't been god influenced in our thinking anybody with me so change your inner self your old way of thinking your sinful behavior seek god's will and do the works you did at first when you first knew me otherwise i will visit you and remove your lampstand the church is impact from its place unless you repent any kingdom version or else i will come unto me quickly and removed i cannot stick out of its place except thou repent verse six i can't go into this too much tonight we'll touch it some of the time but this thou hast once again and this is perfect this is this is the the mind of god unfolding one time i was in a company training and they were saying managers say something good deal with the issue come back and close it with something good after verse five jesus come up but this thou has in other words this is what is is working for you this in the amplifier say yet you have this to your credit that you hate the works and corrupt teachings of the nicolaitans that mislead and delude people which i also hate so the ephesus chief had a lot working for them this thou hast that now hated the deeds of manipulator which i also hate and very quickly what is this these are the nicolaitans was nikko let it control any people having a sense of control over the people in the context of the church this is my church this is this is my people and and locking on the people as if they belong to the man power being placed under the mind that he now becomes an intimate area with god nothing we have read place any man between you and god here it doesn't even place it doesn't even place the prophet between you and god because he's reflecting the light the light that you didn't have access to was brought close to you because you took a star to bring the light into your view come on now the star reflected in the light of the sun but you didn't have the eyesight come on now to see that sun so god put now a reflector is like you have a router in your house and you want a repeater so that the connection could reach you we were so far from god hallelujah nothing we could have ever done could have seen him in his glory but he said a star to reflect his light so when we see the star we can see him no wonder poor could say follow me as i follow christ he was a perfect reflection of the light of the sun and he went about a man a priest a bishop a pope over would say a message folk [Laughter] between me and and my son the son itself hallelujah the days of iniquiton trying to manipulate the people trying to control the people don't listen to this one don't listen to that one listen you can listen to who you want because if you have to test and try and rebuke and bind and destroy the works of darkness it doesn't matter what what you hear if you are grounded in the word you could send strappiness from what is true i can teach you every counterfeit but if you know what the word is and you know you could try any apostle any preacher any believer anything they bring to you could try it by the word anybody with me hallelujah my my my my mind but occurrence how much preachers i heard and i'm listening i listened with with my bored ears open i said it in any church i said any pulpit i said hey brother albert preached something wrong there's an order you know you better the prophet said take him in the office quotes pull this scripture say it nicely to him we could discuss it if that carries up there then it have ways to escalate it but i am too concerned about my first love to let family get into the way to let church get in the way this first love is important we are not robots you know we are spiritual beings trapped in time here to destroy the works of darkness these are small trials around us because we have a big devil to fight and a dragon that we're gonna contend with as oh come on now anybody with me tonight sickness will be placed under your feet believe it hallelujah depression will be under your feet every circumstance will be under your feet i'm speaking the sons of god hallelujah let me close off here but this dalhasta though hates the deeds of the unique leader which i also hate remember you said you loved eating god love you hear the thing god hit hallelujah last verse he that had an ear hallelujah just that verse alone that peace the heathen hat and ear speaks to the fact that it's not it is not it is not just the physical air you know because it had people who they listen you ever hear or people say it going through morning and comedy next year but but it's spiritual years now he that had an air let him hear what his spirit saying unto the churches and then he leaves now in perfect hr in perfect order this is the goal now know that to tell you what you're doing good now that i tell you what you need to fix now i tell you what i like again about your work now let me give you the challenge this is what you need to work on to him that overcome it i've given you a target now will i give to eat of the tree of life which is an of the paradise of god and by the random typed out perfectly that a tree of life is jesus christ himself he plays the two trees there in the garden of eden he said one was christ one was satan and he spoke about the whole plan and it's only any word we know this and if you don't know it get into the world because we're going to go deeper and deeper into it but i want you to see yourself see the word see how much god loves us to look beyond our faults and put all these things here for us that we can grow into this stature and that he tutor himself the holy ghost could watch our conduct and most importantly the response to this word i will leave you with this tonight if you find yourself tonight not where your first love is not where you are supposed to be not where you were before and you know you were praying differently studying differently your joy used to be a different kind of joy when you walk into service when you hear tape it's presence it's not it's not it's not semantics and i'm trying to convince you of what you don't believe and you don't know listen this is real we too close to the finish line to accept foolishness come on now this gospel is real it is truth it is life-changing we will not tolerate anything less than every promise that was brought to us by scripture as the written word and revealed to us by the shining light the reflection of that star of the sun itself as we reveal it to us can we bow our heads forward afraid tonight or gracious heavenly father lord this little bible study to encourage your people lord just a very simple look at that first church age lord we could speak for hours about it lord but if it's one thing that we want to encourage people with is we need to get back to our first love lord love
