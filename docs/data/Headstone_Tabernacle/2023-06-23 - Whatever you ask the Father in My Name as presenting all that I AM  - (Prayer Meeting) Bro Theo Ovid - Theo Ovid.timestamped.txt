[16:07] and I pray that God bless you so you
[16:09] have your Bibles I'd like you to turn to
[16:11] Exodus chapter 3
[16:13] wanna read verse one to seven
[16:17] Exodus chapter 3
[16:19] is a familiar scripture and we want to
[16:21] just see what the Lord will speak to us
[16:23] tonight prison
[16:25] now Moses kept the flock of Jethro is
[16:28] father-in-law the priest of media
[16:30] and he led the flock to the backside of
[16:32] the desert and came to the Mountain of
[16:34] God even to hold it
[16:36] and the angel of the Lord appeared unto
[16:38] him in a flame of fire
[16:40] out of the midst of a bush and he looked
[16:42] and the whole the bush burned with fire
[16:45] and the Bush was not consumed
[16:48] and Moses said
[16:50] I will now turn aside
[16:52] and see this great sight while the bush
[16:54] is not burnt
[16:56] or when the Lord saw
[16:58] that he turned aside to sin
[17:01] God called him out in the midst of the
[17:04] bush
[17:05] and said Moses Moses and he said here am
[17:08] I note
[17:09] that even though the pillar fire the
[17:12] bush has been burnt and whatnot it was
[17:14] still Moses Choice it was still Moses
[17:18] decision to turn aside to see
[17:21] let's continue and when the Lord saw
[17:24] before that he turned aside to see
[17:27] God call him out of the midst of the
[17:30] Bush and said Moses Moses he said here
[17:32] am I and he said draw not lie hi hither
[17:35] put off thy shoe from of thy feet
[17:39] for the place where I understand this is
[17:40] Holy Ground
[17:42] moreover he said I am the god of thy
[17:44] father the god of Abraham the god of
[17:46] Isaac
[17:47] the god of Jacob
[17:49] and Moses hit his face when he was
[17:51] afraid to look upon God
[17:54] and the Lord said
[17:56] I have surely seen the Affliction of my
[17:59] people
[18:00] which are in Egypt
[18:02] and I feel they're crying by reason of
[18:05] their taskmasters and I know yourselves
[18:08] God through seven of the Amplified says
[18:10] and the Lord said I have surely seeing
[18:12] the Affliction of my people who are in
[18:13] Egypt and I feel they're crying because
[18:16] of their task Masters and oppressants
[18:18] and I know their sorrows
[18:20] and sufferings
[18:23] and child
[18:25] and I want you to take that personal
[18:27] tonight
[18:28] for I know their sorrows you know your
[18:30] Sorrows you know your sufferings
[18:33] and you know your trials father God
[18:36] bless this word Lord bless this
[18:38] stirring at your place in my spirit and
[18:40] heart to share with your people tonight
[18:41] in Jesus name asked amen
[18:44] no
[18:45] I want you to notice something here in
[18:48] verse 6.
[18:49] I am the god of thy father this is a man
[18:51] who never met God
[18:53] he only have heard intellectually what
[18:56] his mother told him or what his father
[18:59] told him that is just at the
[19:01] intellectual level just like many people
[19:03] in a message today they come to church
[19:04] they believe the message they believe
[19:06] for the brand and they believe God's not
[19:07] Prophet they believe
[19:09] the prophet and so on but it is at an
[19:12] intellectual level
[19:14] and here it is that God's disencountered
[19:18] a good arranged this appointment with
[19:21] the supernatural there it is that God
[19:24] began to reveal himself
[19:26] and I want you to note
[19:28] oh God reveal himself here
[19:32] he didn't leave Moses to his own whims
[19:35] and fancies his own imagination he began
[19:38] to identify
[19:40] with individuals
[19:42] who
[19:44] he identified with previously I am the
[19:46] god of thy father the god of Abraham an
[19:49] individual the god of Isaac an
[19:52] individual
[19:53] the god of Jacob an individual and I
[19:56] want you to note that I was thinking
[19:58] about
[19:59] titling this is the god of
[20:02] but I titled this exhortation to you
[20:05] tonight
[20:07] whatever you ask the father in my name
[20:11] as presenting all that I am he may give
[20:14] it to you
[20:15] and you'll see where I get it from
[20:17] whatever you ask the father in my name
[20:20] as presenting all that I am
[20:23] he may give it to you
[20:25] so the first thing God did was to
[20:27] clearly identify the muses he is not any
[20:31] God
[20:32] he is the god of fathers is not
[20:36] something tonight oh praise the Lord
[20:38] blessed be the name of the Lord thank
[20:41] you Jesus for Islam do you get that
[20:43] tonight
[20:44] so he's not so I like that God of
[20:48] your fathers
[20:50] what did God send the prophet Malachi to
[20:52] do
[20:53] turn our hearts back to the feet of the
[20:55] father
[20:56] it is what God
[20:58] originally identify himself with and he
[21:01] did so on the day of Pentecost we can
[21:04] never change that
[21:05] we can never erase that the prophet came
[21:09] to point us and to carry us back
[21:12] back to the feet of the fathers because
[21:15] that feat of the fathers was the
[21:18] original feat and he cannot have a have
[21:20] a new feed you have to go back to
[21:22] original feed no
[21:25] in preparation for the to pull
[21:28] and that is identified in Max mark 11.
[21:33] and you hear me off time preaching it
[21:35] and talking about Jesus talk about the
[21:37] third first the second pull second and
[21:39] then the first book
[21:40] at least on Mark 11
[21:43] just stay with me now
[21:44] Mark 11 22-26 Jesus answered seven to
[21:48] them are faith in God so this was after
[21:50] Jesus cursed the Fig Tree and the next
[21:52] day they saw it dried up he saw a
[21:54] miracle they saw a power they saw a
[21:56] spoken word and he said have faith and
[21:59] God
[22:01] for very nice time to you that
[22:03] whatsoever shall see that whosoever
[22:07] shall see under this mountain be Thor
[22:09] removed and thou and be thou cast into
[22:12] the sea shall not in his heart but shall
[22:14] believe that those things which you see
[22:16] a shall come to pass he can have
[22:19] whatever is here
[22:21] so he's telling them this is where sons
[22:24] of God will be finally placed
[22:27] be placed in a position to speak on what
[22:30] they speak it will materialize it will
[22:32] come to pass
[22:33] and then he dropped down from 23 24
[22:37] wherefore therefore I sent to you
[22:39] whatsoever things you desire
[22:43] When you pray
[22:45] believe
[22:46] that you receive them
[22:48] and he shall have them
[22:50] no you are believing you're receiving it
[22:52] is means that you're believing it from
[22:56] The Source the source of power you're
[22:59] believing it from God providing from
[23:01] you're not looking at this circumstance
[23:03] beat your children Deliverance be it a
[23:05] financial breakthrough be it a physical
[23:08] healing it doesn't matter what is the
[23:10] present situation he said believe
[23:13] you have received it so you are sick Dr
[23:16] give you so much Deeds or the doctor
[23:18] give you so much time but you choose to
[23:21] obey this tonight and believe you have
[23:23] received and you shall have whatever you
[23:27] you shall have that
[23:28] but then Jesus Dreamed a little deeper
[23:31] in verse 25 and when you stand praying
[23:35] forgive if you have ought against any
[23:38] that your father was in heaven May
[23:40] forgive you your trespasses
[23:42] so he put prayer under a condition so
[23:45] people have an awesome God and praying
[23:47] they will send that people haven't uh
[23:50] are having odds and issues and things
[23:52] like that and they pray to God and they
[23:54] pray like total waste of mind because
[23:57] God is not hearing that and this is
[23:59] where we choose not to follow let's say
[24:03] the god of our own imagination or the
[24:06] god of your own feelings or the god of
[24:08] your own emotion but this is the god of
[24:10] the word
[24:10] that's what he's seeing here this is
[24:12] written in red when you start praying
[24:14] forgive
[24:16] so you want to come and pray tonight you
[24:18] want to call upon God tonight something
[24:21] is in your heart you know you're gonna
[24:23] make it right you make it right then you
[24:24] can effectively pray and watch if you
[24:27] have order against any
[24:28] drop it drop it which is him and when
[24:33] you start doing forgive that if you're
[24:35] fought against any that your father also
[24:38] is in heaven May forgive you your
[24:39] trespasses so when somebody said I'm
[24:42] sorry please forgive me you're supposed
[24:44] to respond I forgive you
[24:46] see verse 26 but if you do not forgive
[24:49] neither will your father which in heaven
[24:51] forgive your trespasses
[24:53] no understand this
[24:58] this last day bride is not true she's
[25:01] calling it's a bride
[25:02] a brighter perfection
[25:04] disperfection is coming right up to the
[25:07] tooth pull which we know is the spoken
[25:09] word and this spoken word is a deal with
[25:12] the challenge of the hour we don't know
[25:15] later on what it will be food wise the
[25:18] challenges for food wax Jesus Take Five
[25:21] Loaves two fishes are multiplied
[25:23] we don't know if power will be required
[25:26] upon us to do the same when that time
[25:29] comes but the challenge to get down to
[25:33] the Rapture to get down to the
[25:35] resurrection is coming from number one
[25:37] to two to three you cannot sit down
[25:40] there and say you're in church your
[25:42] bride you're going to the rapture
[25:44] it doesn't work that way you will have
[25:46] to come to Migos requirement no Exodus
[25:50] tree
[25:51] and this is further down verse 13 and 14
[25:54] and Moses said unto God so no Moses God
[25:58] spoke to him we know what happened here
[26:00] and then Moses recognized that he is
[26:03] still the person responsible to go down
[26:05] to Egypt and Muslim to God behold when I
[26:09] come under the tune of Israel and shall
[26:12] see unto them the god of your fathers
[26:16] has sent me unto you
[26:18] the god of your fathers has sent me unto
[26:22] you and they shall say to me what is his
[26:24] name what shall I see unto them question
[26:29] and God said unto Moses I am that I am
[26:34] he said thus shall thou see under the
[26:36] return Israel I am accept me unto you
[26:41] in the Amplified this last verse was 14
[26:44] of Exodus 3. and God said to Moses I am
[26:48] who I am
[26:50] and what I am
[26:52] and I will be what I will be
[26:56] and he said You shall say this to the
[26:58] Israelites I am accept me to you let me
[27:02] repeat that again let me amplify God
[27:04] said to Moses I am who I am
[27:08] and what I am
[27:10] and I will be what I will be and he said
[27:15] You shall see this to the Israelite I am
[27:18] had sent me to you so this was an
[27:22] introduction
[27:23] to hold God wanted the people to know
[27:27] him by name
[27:29] he named himself or called himself I am
[27:34] we often see it I am whatever you have
[27:36] need of that I am
[27:39] now sin John 15 16.
[27:42] Jesus speaking
[27:44] Jesus words
[27:45] you have not chosen me
[27:48] but I have chosen you I wish the god
[27:51] that God engraved that in your heart
[27:52] tonight
[27:53] you have not chosen me this is Jesus
[27:56] speaking to us but I have chosen you one
[27:58] and ordain you too that you should go
[28:02] and bring forth fruit and that your
[28:05] fruit should remain and that here we go
[28:09] whatsoever he shall ask of the father in
[28:14] my name he may give it to you
[28:18] so you you see here like if you're
[28:21] seeing a motive an objective of why you
[28:24] have been chosen
[28:26] why you have been called
[28:28] why you are being ordained and the
[28:32] purpose is to bring forth fruit
[28:34] and that your fruit wouldn't just fall
[28:37] off what your foot will remain
[28:39] and that you would be in a place or in a
[28:41] position to ask
[28:43] so therefore the bride has to come into
[28:47] a position
[28:48] to ask of the father
[28:51] in his name in my name that he may give
[28:54] it now let's hear that same scripture in
[28:56] the amplifi it's in John 15 16.
[28:59] and reads you have not chosen me
[29:03] but I have chosen you
[29:04] I have appointed you
[29:07] I have planted you that you might go and
[29:10] bear fruit and keep on bearing and that
[29:13] your food may be lasted that it may
[29:16] remain abide so that whatever you ask
[29:19] the father in my name
[29:22] and this is what I get where I get it
[29:23] from and whatever you ask the my
[29:25] name as presenting all that I am
[29:29] he may give it to you let me read it
[29:32] again and whatsoever you ask the father
[29:35] in my name as presenting all that I am
[29:41] he may give it to you
[29:43] the burden of God
[29:45] is to get us
[29:47] get the church get the individual to a
[29:52] place to ask what you will
[29:54] and it shall be given or done unto you
[29:59] so it's not a matter of you going to
[30:00] church you go back home
[30:02] and you have no connection with God in
[30:05] that real relationship and that
[30:07] connection as brothers even make sure to
[30:09] this last Friday to be a friend of God
[30:12] so what God desires is for us to be
[30:15] truly on speaking things with him
[30:18] being speaking things with God like how
[30:20] Elijah was Crossing Jordan and then he
[30:23] said what is this you want me to do for
[30:24] you ask what you will do what is it that
[30:26] you want me to do Elijah said Elijah
[30:28] said the double proportion see so I want
[30:31] to identify
[30:32] that brotherly kindness is the platform
[30:36] to put you and speaking things with God
[30:38] now you might get wary of me always
[30:41] talking about barely kindness often he
[30:43] said
[30:44] okay but it is real this odds and brush
[30:49] things is tangible yeah people have
[30:52] things lodging their Spirits lodging
[30:54] them maybe in their soul and they can't
[30:56] seem to get rid of it but you have to
[30:59] in order to get on speaking things with
[31:01] God you say when you stand praying
[31:03] forgive you have to graduate from
[31:05] forgiveness being kind to your brethren
[31:08] to the kind to others and then you come
[31:11] and speaking to begin to ask and as you
[31:14] ask you see God answering your prayer
[31:16] you see little things that's not these
[31:19] big things little things and then you
[31:21] move right up to speak in the word
[31:23] now listen
[31:25] because we don't stretch here no but the
[31:27] brand I'm in a message called the guide
[31:28] he said God sends a guide
[31:30] and God wants you to remember that he's
[31:32] appointed guy he said I will not leave
[31:34] you but I'll pray the father and send
[31:37] you another confidence
[31:38] now this comforter when he was to come
[31:41] was the guidance to all truth and the
[31:44] word of God is the truth and the word is
[31:45] Christ I am the way the truth and the
[31:47] light see no and when the churches did
[31:51] they reject how can we ever expect to go
[31:53] to heaven and the Holy Spirit was sent
[31:56] to us for a guide
[31:57] we will take a cardinal Bishop General
[32:01] Messiah somebody like to guide us when
[32:04] the Holy Spirit was given to guidance
[32:05] this is the part I want to get to and
[32:08] the Holy Spirit always speaks the word
[32:10] not somebody's dream or interpretation
[32:13] or feelings or emotions Holy Spirit
[32:15] speaks what the word I've got many
[32:17] things to tell you Jesus speaks but you
[32:20] cannot understand them now when he comes
[32:22] he will guide you to it and then brother
[32:25] Branham breaks in and says this here
[32:26] that's the reason the coming of the
[32:30] seals
[32:31] at the finishing of the seventh seal the
[32:35] mystery of God shall be finished
[32:37] to know who God is one
[32:40] what he is to
[32:43] how he lives
[32:45] SRI his nature for
[32:49] his being fight
[32:51] you are supposed to be all the way up
[32:54] there by that time he's talking about
[32:56] the Statue of perfect man
[32:57] and you're seeing that the bride body
[33:00] Church
[33:02] supposed to be all the way up there
[33:03] talking about that Holy Spirit slot
[33:07] and he didn't say at the beginning
[33:09] at the finishing of the seventh seal the
[33:14] mystery of God shall be finished to know
[33:16] who God is in other words all about him
[33:20] what he is
[33:22] how we lose his nature his being you're
[33:26] supposed to be all the way up there by
[33:28] that time and to bring us into the full
[33:31] statue of sons and doors of God a church
[33:33] that's washed in the blood of Christ
[33:35] that brought without money
[33:38] pay for by the blood of Jesus okay we're
[33:41] wrapping at the end
[33:43] so in John 14 13 to 15 Jesus speaks
[33:47] he's speaking
[33:49] this is in red whatsoever he shall ask
[33:52] in my name
[33:53] that will I do hear this part that the
[33:56] father
[33:57] may be glorified in the Sun
[34:00] now you see how it come into
[34:03] a place where God wants us to ask
[34:06] and the purpose of getting that
[34:07] fulfilled
[34:09] he said that the father let me glorify
[34:11] in the sun because you're not doing it
[34:13] in your name you don't understand verse
[34:15] 14 if he I'll ask anything in my name I
[34:20] will do it
[34:22] then verse 15 if you love me
[34:25] keep my Commandments
[34:27] said John 14 let's read it out now in
[34:30] the Amplified let's go
[34:33] with the team and I will do
[34:36] I myself will grant
[34:39] whatever you ask in my name
[34:42] as presenting all that I am
[34:45] so that the father may be glorified and
[34:48] extolled into the sun yes I will grant I
[34:52] myself will do it for you whatever you
[34:54] shall ask in mining
[34:56] as presenting all that I am
[35:00] if you really love me you will keep and
[35:03] obey my commands
[35:05] so through this Prophet this entire
[35:07] prophet of Mark I fall this Prophet
[35:09] William Branham all the Mysteries were
[35:13] revealed
[35:14] all Seven Seals
[35:16] or seven tunnels
[35:17] every mystery all about him
[35:21] he revealed his nature
[35:23] his being
[35:24] all about him that is to be presented to
[35:28] God
[35:29] so tonight we can present we can
[35:32] presenting all I am
[35:34] having faith in all that he is
[35:37] regardless of your condition this is the
[35:39] part I want to get to you
[35:40] regardless of your condition what is
[35:42] your condition tonight
[35:44] you are born
[35:46] he could be your deliverer tonight I am
[35:49] your deliverer I am that I am
[35:52] you said he said you said regards a
[35:55] condition you're sick I am your healer I
[35:58] want you to think about it tonight what
[36:01] he is what he declared himself to be I
[36:03] am your healer and you say Lord you are
[36:05] my healer
[36:07] I am your deliverer you say Lord You Are
[36:10] My deliverer whatever you want him to be
[36:13] I am that I Am Lord I am tired Lord I am
[36:17] dead I am whole Lord I am back student
[36:21] and Lord you are restorer I am
[36:25] I am a restorer so God could actually
[36:27] bring you tonight by our anointed by his
[36:31] Spirit by his power and take you out of
[36:34] a backseat and anointing and atmosphere
[36:36] and bring you into his presence
[36:38] watch I am your deliverer you say Lord
[36:40] You're My deliverer whatever you want
[36:42] him to be I am that I am presenting all
[36:45] I am you can ask what you will I am
[36:48] every mystery I am the seven Thunder is
[36:50] presenting all that I am and whatever
[36:52] you have need of that I am
[36:54] and I'm cruising with this last book
[36:56] here foreign
[37:00] and the name is in the word
[37:02] because he is the word
[37:04] what he is then
[37:06] the word interpreted is a manifestation
[37:11] of the name of God
[37:13] this bright church will be a powerful
[37:16] Church
[37:17] a church that God will be proud of
[37:20] our church that will be manifesting his
[37:23] name
[37:24] the Pentecostal watch Jesus name and the
[37:28] speaking tongues and whatnot but the
[37:29] bride the manifestation of the word
[37:31] interprets the name of God the bride
[37:34] will be the world manifesting so Church
[37:37] inclusion
[37:39] it is God's will
[37:41] it is God's desire
[37:44] that you come into the position to ask
[37:46] whatever you will
[37:48] you know he said if he abiding me and my
[37:51] wife's abide in you you can ask so
[37:53] whatsoever you will and it shall be done
[37:56] he just asked to present all that I am
[37:58] and I recognize we have limited God
[38:02] and what do you think about that
[38:03] our fears shows that we have limits on
[38:06] God
[38:07] what do you feel
[38:09] how could you be taken out of this world
[38:11] before your time
[38:13] how could this happen man this happened
[38:15] that happened and you're not going to
[38:16] make it get fearful and you get anxious
[38:18] why it's because trust is not there you
[38:22] are not trusting them to say I am your
[38:24] provider I am your I would say your
[38:28] protector I am your Shield you think
[38:31] your wall is closing on you and you
[38:33] caught up in your own frustrations
[38:34] depression upset problems and so on but
[38:37] you're not seeing this powerful God like
[38:39] those two boys that say our God is able
[38:41] to deliver us or we will not bow down
[38:44] this is what I want to hear saying
[38:45] speaking speaking the word
[38:47] speaking who he is presenting all I am
[38:50] you get an accident what's the purpose
[38:53] behind that the first thing you ever
[38:55] want to tell your sin your fell your
[38:56] failed that why you get a flat tire

[1:29:04] power you promised Dynamics to the
[1:29:06] mechanics is from your prime minister's
[1:29:07] law that which was before the beginning
[1:29:09] to come back because that is
[1:29:11] perfection never in the beginning never
[1:29:13] landed that was that function of spirit
[1:29:16] before in the beginning was the word it
[1:29:18] was taught it was Spirit life father God
[1:29:21] that's very common connected half the
[1:29:23] way in the name of Jesus Lord May it's
[1:29:26] not a real Revival the heart of a
[1:29:28] children tonight
[1:29:34] in Jesus
[1:29:48] I leave the storm
[1:29:50] but I give you peace
[1:29:55] but I give you Grace
[1:29:57] I'll leave the heartache
[1:29:59] but I give you comfort
[1:30:00] I leave the disputes but I give you
[1:30:03] brotherly kindness
[1:30:04] I need a heat but I give you love
[1:30:07] and lead the distress but I give you
[1:30:10] hope may God bless you tonight I may
[1:30:13] Anointed Flow upon you you Commander
[1:30:16] great expectation of the Sunday service
[1:30:17] you pray that God will do more
[1:30:20] abundantly you could just ask but you
[1:30:22] keep on praying because God wants the
[1:30:24] brain to be in a position of asking a
[1:30:27] position of asking what you will that
[1:30:29] the father might be doing to listen God
[1:30:32] bless you God blessed
[1:30:35] peace
