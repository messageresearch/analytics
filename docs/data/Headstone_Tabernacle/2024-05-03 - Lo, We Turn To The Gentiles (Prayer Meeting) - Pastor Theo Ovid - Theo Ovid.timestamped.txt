[11:19] we so glad to have this privilege and
[11:21] opportunity that we could Fellowship
[11:24] around the word and get on in prayer
[11:27] it's part of the Christian experience is
[11:29] part of our connection with God is part
[11:33] of being able to look back and see what
[11:35] a week we had and to be grateful to God
[11:38] and thankful to God for keeping us and
[11:41] that we are still alive in the land of
[11:42] the
[11:43] living I have one scripture I like to
[11:46] read
[11:48] uh from Acts chapter
[11:52] 13 we want to read verse 46 to
[11:56] 52 Acts chapter 13 verse 46 to 52 praise
[12:03] the
[12:07] Lord and verse 46 read then Paul and
[12:10] bamas waxed bold and said it was
[12:14] necessary that the word of God should
[12:17] first have been spoken to
[12:19] you but seeing ye have put it from you
[12:23] and judge yourselves Unworthy of
[12:25] everlasting life
[12:27] L return to the
[12:29] Gentiles for so hath the Lord commanded
[12:32] us sing I have set thee as a light of
[12:35] the Gentiles that thou should as be for
[12:38] salvation unto the ends of the Earth and
[12:41] when the Gentiles heard this they were
[12:44] glad and glorified the word of the Lord
[12:47] and as many as were ordained to eternal
[12:49] life
[12:50] believed and the word of the Lord was
[12:52] published throughout all the region but
[12:55] the Jews stood up The Devout and
[12:58] honorable woman and the chief men of the
[13:00] city and raised
[13:02] persecution against Paul and Barnabas
[13:06] and expelled them out of their Coast but
[13:10] they shook off the dust of their feet
[13:12] against them and came to
[13:16] ionium and the disciples were filled
[13:18] with joy and with the Holy Ghost amen
[13:22] let us pray one more time father we
[13:24] thank you for your word bless it
[13:25] interpret to our heart in Jesus name I
[13:27] ask it amen and amen
[13:29] Sunday service will be a special time
[13:31] Sunday we are actually celebrating 28
[13:34] years since our church was dedicated and
[13:37] we're looking forward for a wonderful
[13:38] time in the Lord a special service we
[13:41] going have this coming Sunday we have
[13:42] two services at 10: and at 3 the
[13:45] communion
[13:47] service this book of Acts is a strange
[13:51] thing that I got tonight the title I
[13:54] have is low we turn to the
[13:57] Gentiles now
[14:00] I titled it that but we're going to flip
[14:03] it we want to see what happened here and
[14:07] see how God is about to flip it to turn
[14:10] to the Jews so in this acts
[14:15] 36:46 in the Amplified it says and Paul
[14:18] and Barnabas spoke out plainly and
[14:21] boldly saying it was necessary that
[14:25] God's
[14:26] message concerning salvation through
[14:29] Christ should be spoken to you first but
[14:33] since you trust it from you you pass
[14:38] this judgment on
[14:39] yourselves that you are not Unworthy of
[14:43] eternal life and out of your own mouth
[14:46] you will be
[14:47] judged Now
[14:48] Behold we return to the Gentiles the
[14:53] Heathen so we know the
[14:56] story the Jews who came on his own and
[14:59] rejected
[15:01] him by this
[15:03] rejection in Acts 13:46 Paul got the
[15:07] commission to turn to the
[15:10] Gentiles that is why we are here
[15:12] tonight because God's Own chosen people
[15:16] using that word rejected him and give us
[15:21] an
[15:22] opportunity note how it
[15:26] was placed to them that it was necessary
[15:31] that this they get this word first but
[15:33] seeing they don't want it they push it
[15:35] away from themselves now we turn to the
[15:38] Gentiles I want you to think this entire
[15:42] message has been here with us over 50
[15:44] plus
[15:45] years it has gone around the world
[15:48] several times in books translated in
[15:51] every way possible to get this to this
[15:54] end time people I wanted to see
[15:59] how God would be angry and how the
[16:04] Judgment of God would be so harsh as
[16:07] this Gentile age
[16:10] closes
[16:11] because when Jesus was on Calvary the
[16:15] Jews cried out May his blood be upon us
[16:18] and our
[16:19] children for that
[16:22] statement for that
[16:24] rejection for that attitude they were
[16:28] scattered
[16:29] they were
[16:31] killed and so on we know 6 million Jews
[16:34] that died under Hitler and I man and
[16:36] Stalin and so on and to this day they
[16:39] under that pressure because of what
[16:42] happened 2,000 years
[16:44] ago what do you think this God of the
[16:48] Bible note god of the Bible who give us
[16:53] Gentiles the opportunity to be grafted
[16:56] in what would that God think
[16:59] about this Gentile Bunch rejecting and
[17:03] turning down this Holy Ghost Gospel and
[17:06] I want to encourage you tonight to cry
[17:08] out to call upon God because we are
[17:12] fighting we are fighting to live we are
[17:14] fighting to die we are fighting La
[17:17] slothfulness lishia we are fighting
[17:21] attacks on slaugh of the enemy we are
[17:23] fighting for our families you have to
[17:25] pray we have to
[17:27] fight so Lord return to the Gentiles
[17:31] Revelation 7 famar scripture after these
[17:33] things I saw four Angels standing at the
[17:35] four corner of the Earth holding the
[17:37] Four Winds of the earth and we know
[17:39] that's the wars they're holding back
[17:41] that they should not hurt the Earth the
[17:43] sea nor any tree so what is to come is
[17:46] to affect everything Earth see the
[17:50] trees that means nature verse two I saw
[17:53] another Angel ascending with from the
[17:55] East having the seed of the Living God
[17:57] and he carried a law voice to the four
[17:59] angels to whom it was given to hurt the
[18:01] earth and the Sea hurt not the Earth
[18:03] neither the sea nor the trees for till
[18:06] we have sealed the Servants of our God
[18:08] in your foreheads and I heard the number
[18:11] of them that were sealed and there were
[18:14] sealed
[18:16] 144,000 of all the tribes of the
[18:19] children of
[18:20] Israel now under the fifth
[18:24] seal we know that the Jews were under
[18:28] there crying out how long they were
[18:30] saying how long Lord how long Lord right
[18:34] the Jews were crying out under the fifth
[18:35] seal and the prophet was revealing it
[18:38] here he was saying that I will not
[18:41] Brethren that be ignorant of the mystery
[18:43] least at any time you be wise in your
[18:45] own conceit the blindness in part is
[18:48] happened to Israel until the fullness of
[18:51] the Gentiles come in so
[18:55] once the Gentile agid is made up or
[18:58] complete or is fulfilled God ready to go
[19:02] back to the Jews the last gentle bride
[19:07] be brought in for the bride the
[19:09] blindness come to Israel for that
[19:10] purpose so all Israel shall be saved as
[19:14] it is written there shall come out of
[19:16] Zan a deliverer that shall turn away the
[19:18] ungodliness of
[19:20] Israel now they are Israel that's under
[19:23] this altar watch Israel was blinded for
[19:27] the very purpose for us being being
[19:29] saved Who blinded them God God blinded
[19:33] his old children his own children no
[19:35] wonder Jesus standing there at the cross
[19:38] and them Jews hling for his blood his
[19:40] own kids he was the scripture he was
[19:42] himself the word and here he is knowing
[19:44] that those people would have gladly
[19:47] received him and that's the reason he
[19:49] blinded them so they wouldn't recognize
[19:52] him he come in such a humble way
[19:54] blinding them to it that they wouldn't
[19:57] receive it the scripture said they would
[19:59] do it he was blinded he blinded Jesus
[20:02] peed them even said father forgive them
[20:05] they don't know what they doing notice
[20:08] now I want you to watch this read close
[20:11] they were given robes they didn't have
[20:13] them they were given robes white robes
[20:15] each one of them now the Saints already
[20:18] have one but they were given robes the
[20:20] Saints already have deers but this this
[20:23] on the fifth seal they had not a chance
[20:25] because they were blinded and so by
[20:28] their own father here we go so the grace
[20:31] of God could be fulfilled to the bride
[20:35] so I want you to notice this is not your
[20:37] right we didn't earn it it's a gift it's
[20:41] a Grace and that's why we should be
[20:43] thankful every time see in other words
[20:46] it is predestinated to them it's the
[20:48] scriptures now they got
[20:50] robes 144,000 to be called out notice
[20:54] thy Breen had to be yet to be killed
[20:59] which means here we go the 144,000 yet
[21:04] to be called in the tribulation the
[21:08] 144,000 is
[21:10] called and they'll be killed which we
[21:13] had some time we might get it tomorrow
[21:16] night if the Lord willing that before he
[21:19] said they have to be matured these Jews
[21:22] they have to be marched by the
[21:24] Antichrist we just come through and
[21:27] notice his last ride where he breaks the
[21:29] Covenant with them Jews down there and
[21:31] she goes these
[21:34] Jews 144,000 is to be called out notice
[21:39] these souls are to wait a little season
[21:42] for the
[21:44] 144,000 to be
[21:46] mared so these Saints these Jews that
[21:51] are the elected of God they have they
[21:55] have been still paying a price
[21:58] and that is why the Judgment of the
[22:02] Gentiles will be so
[22:04] har and that is
[22:07] why we need
[22:10] to shake off
[22:12] this how could I say it this entitlement
[22:16] it just stuck on me you got to forgive
[22:17] me sometime I want to know if I go in
[22:18] off you know am I tripping or what but
[22:22] this
[22:23] entitlement where God have this certain
[22:25] obligation to us and I said no God came
[22:30] to the Jews and they got blinded that we
[22:34] get an
[22:35] opportunity don't mess
[22:38] up don't throw away
[22:41] opportunity you'll be
[22:43] judged let's continue along with
[22:47] you brother brand ENT
[22:50] evangelism we are going to end right
[22:53] here he said the end time message is to
[22:57] get the bride ready
[22:59] and prepared for the
[23:00] Rapture according to Malachai 4 bring
[23:04] them back to the feet that was once
[23:07] delivered to the Saints and then he is
[23:09] drilling down into it now bring them
[23:12] back to the fate of the
[23:14] fathers the Pentecostal
[23:17] part in the restoration time I will
[23:21] restore see the Lord that's real end
[23:25] time
[23:27] evangelism what is
[23:29] evangelism what is the fate of the
[23:32] fathers the Pentecostal part in the
[23:36] restoration time this restoration didn't
[23:38] come through Luther or Wesley or
[23:40] Pentecost which is Pentecostal
[23:42] denomination William brandham the
[23:44] prophet of Malachi 4 he brought the
[23:47] restoration according to the scripture
[23:49] Elias shall first Truly Come and restore
[23:52] all things so this restoration only come
[23:55] by this end time word
[23:57] message but
[23:59] it has a Pentecostal part of it which is
[24:02] the spirit part which is the oil part
[24:05] and he is praying here in Junction of
[24:08] time our heavenly father we thank thee
[24:11] for those who have raised their hands a
[24:13] while ago seeing the desire to be born
[24:16] again they wanted to receive the baptism
[24:19] of the Holy Ghost and be sealed into the
[24:22] kingdom of God now right here in the
[24:25] neighborhood right around the places
[24:27] here where these people come from here
[24:30] are pastors your Shepherds Lord who are
[24:33] feeding their flock and they're standing
[24:35] there not ashamed standing boldly in the
[24:39] presence of God to let people know that
[24:41] they believe in this marvelous old
[24:43] gospel they believe in the baptism of
[24:45] the Holy Ghost they believe in the
[24:47] second coming of Christ they believe
[24:50] that they are in the end time and they
[24:51] are trying their best Lord in their
[24:54] corners of the World to Win people to
[24:56] you oh Eternal God bless their min
[24:58] hisory abundantly I pray here we go that
[25:02] you will anoint them with preaching
[25:05] power with healing power and the virtues
[25:09] of God and this part I want to get to
[25:13] until their little churches will cry out
[25:17] great signs and wonders will take place
[25:20] and may there come an oldfashioned
[25:22] Revival out of Sturges here that will
[25:25] sweep the whole state Grant it Lord give
[25:28] give them an oldfashioned ooing of the
[25:30] Holy Ghost made start from this very
[25:33] gathering
[25:34] together and we know this quote we read

[25:40] time before in two signs Overlook when
[25:43] he said let the people talking about

[25:54] that God will give him let that little
[25:57] remnant go to calling out to God and
[26:00] Watch What Happens listen when the
[26:03] people begins to pray when you want to

[26:09] take place it will affect your life it
[26:11] will affect your family it will affect
[26:13] your business it will affect your walk
[26:15] your talk because you are tapping into
[26:18] the supernatural you are tapping into
[26:20] the Living God by having a communion and
[26:22] a fellowship with him let that Remnant
[26:25] go to calling upon God Watch What
[26:27] Happens there'll be a national Showdown
[26:30] there'll be a power that they have never
[26:32] seen before the trouble of it is this
[26:35] time is going to be too late for them
[26:37] the doors will be closed so remember we
[26:40] are the end time
[26:43] pray Prophet speaks we got programs
[26:46] around here revivals people asking if
[26:48] you accept Christ as your personal Sav
[26:50] yes I do two or three days after that
[26:52] the devil got them out of there again
[26:54] what they need today is an oldfashioned
[26:57] godsent s Paul Revival and the Holy
[27:00] Spirit would get men down at the altar
[27:03] like their mother and daddy used to do
[27:05] and cry out on the altar until God gives
[27:09] them the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[27:12] that's the truth my Christian
[27:13] friend here we go and about to
[27:16] finish you'll be kicked out some of
[27:19] these days from these in
[27:21] National like this it will come a time
[27:25] this is
[27:26] prophecy it will come a time time when
[27:29] you will have to belong to an
[27:30] organization or you can't
[27:33] worship as you know the scripture say it
[27:36] will
[27:37] be they just make fun of you now listen
[27:41] to these words they just make fun of you
[27:43] now but there will come a time where
[27:46] there will be a boycott for the mark of
[27:50] the beast must come you'll either belong
[27:54] to the confederation of churches the
[27:56] Beast like it is in Rome or you don't
[27:58] push up at all that's what the scripture
[28:02] says that is when you'll have to cry out
[28:06] like Isaiah did so so he is saying right
[28:09] now they're laughing at you making fun
[28:12] making
[28:13] mockery but things is about to change
[28:15] and will change now Saints let me say
[28:18] this here you sit here tonight you have
[28:22] your bills you have issues in your
[28:24] family in your home whether with wife
[28:26] husband children with with boss on the
[28:29] job whe they heading for retirement whe
[28:32] they not applying a job you have your
[28:35] own personal life and God is conscious
[28:38] of that you may have health issues
[28:42] health challenges God is aware and he's
[28:45] conscious of that as much as he cares
[28:49] about you about what you're going
[28:52] through cares about the challenges that
[28:54] you have and he wants to meet your needs
[28:59] the overall aring of things is that God
[29:02] has his plan and his
[29:04] program that is above everything else
[29:08] don't ever forget that with all your
[29:10] plans and ambition and all your aims and
[29:12] what you want to do in life and
[29:14] everything else and what you are seeing
[29:15] and so like that remember there is still
[29:19] a program of God when those three men
[29:21] came walking to Abraham they didn't come
[29:24] for a lime or just come to eat and and
[29:26] go back they came with a message
[29:28] they came to tell Abraham judgment is
[29:30] about to strike
[29:31] son I I come to tell you plus I come to
[29:36] let you know that your body is going to
[29:37] be changed that the time of life is
[29:39] coming so two things that play here life
[29:44] to Abraham and Sarah transformation by
[29:47] time of
[29:48] life judgment to Sodom and family is
[29:53] there so I want
[29:55] you not to stay at the caral level or
[29:58] the natural level of your mortgage and
[30:00] your bills and your payments which is
[30:02] part of
[30:03] life but you have to be able to take a
[30:06] peak now and again and more now and
[30:09] again to see what else that you have to
[30:13] observe in this program of God because
[30:17] in Prophecy Jesus said the bill this
[30:20] they they they given in marriage normal
[30:23] living until something just happen and
[30:25] break so when things begin to break and
[30:27] I believe things will break suddenly not
[30:31] gradually suddenly
[30:34] overnight you cannot be caught una a
[30:36] ways you cannot say you did not know you
[30:38] cannot say why is brother fing and
[30:43] presenting and preaching this way why is
[30:46] he doing that you cannot you cannot say
[30:49] you didn't hear let's just continue
[30:53] finish then you talking about when the
[30:57] boycut everything else that is when
[30:59] you'll have to cry out like Isaiah did
[31:01] and he got down in the temple he
[31:04] realized then he raised his hands he
[31:07] said oh Lord I'm a man of un lips you
[31:11] think you're good but wait till that
[31:13] time
[31:15] come I you see brother B is injecting it
[31:18] you think you're good but you wait till
[31:21] that time come I dwell among a people of
[31:24] unclips what did he he got desperate and
[31:27] when you get get desperate about this
[31:29] thing something will take place you are
[31:32] not desperate enough now we know that a
[31:35] birth I don't care is a a baby born in a
[31:38] shock pile hard floor pink decorated
[31:40] hospital is a mess and the new birth is
[31:43] nothing less than a mess but people are
[31:45] so starchy watch that word
[31:47] starchy you'll go over there where they
[31:50] shake hands so the people will prefer
[31:54] humans humans a a normal Church shaking
[31:57] hands saying amen hallelujah we are the
[31:59] Mysteries and we are the best teacher
[32:01] and the unfolding of the word and no
[32:03] noise no sort of crazy people and
[32:05] Hallelujah glory and none of that but
[32:07] here what he's saying here
[32:09] now we will go over where they shake
[32:12] hands we will go over where they don't
[32:15] ball and cry and beat on the Altar and
[32:20] cry out listen to The Prophet words now
[32:23] you want to be too
[32:25] human we need a
[32:28] are dying out to bring forth
[32:33] life if you love
[32:36] God everything that's it us should be in
[32:39] the love of
[32:40] Christ amen he said we set so full
[32:44] we said so unconcerned and I see this
[32:47] word here
[32:48] unconcerned many of us in that category
[32:51] we come in the church not you don't
[32:53] believe but what do you have a
[32:55] burden do you have a concern
[32:58] set UNC concerned when the world is
[33:01] dying under our
[33:03] feet we set so unconcern about it as
[33:07] long as we belong to the church that's
[33:10] all we think that makes a difference
[33:12] that's a sad part with people in this
[33:15] message he said right now we're in a
[33:17] time of investigating judgment remember
[33:19] what we said on Wednesday night he said
[33:22] the two Spirits are marking their people
[33:24] now for future judgment in other words
[33:27] God is investigating us to see who he
[33:32] will seal and who he will
[33:34] judge are skipping
[33:39] quickly we are living in terrific times
[33:41] you see these things that we are in now
[33:43] we studying right now the church is done
[33:45] going and these things are in the
[33:46] tribulation period And I think it ought
[33:48] to be truly settled in every believer
[33:50] heart that this church never takes the
[33:53] tribulation period you cannot put
[33:55] nowhere the church in the tribulation
[33:57] you can put you could put the church
[33:59] there but not the bride the bride is
[34:01] gone she's done she she's not one sin
[34:05] nothing against her the grace of God has
[34:07] covered her and the bleach has took sin
[34:09] so far away there's not even remembrance
[34:12] of it oh here we go it ought to make the
[34:15] bride get down on her knees and cry out
[34:18] to God oh Hallelujah could you just give
[34:21] God some Praises as I close is the final
[34:23] quote and we go straight into
[34:25] prayer there's some trial 27th of April
[34:30] 1964
[34:31] prophecy
[34:34] what one of these
[34:37] days men and women will cry
[34:40] out it will be too far it will be too
[34:43] late the door would be closed and Jesus
[34:48] said it would be that way the virgins
[34:50] come and knocked on the door and said
[34:53] let us in they wanted to get some oil
[34:57] but they ought to have had got the oil
[35:01] when the oil was being given out the
[35:05] knock on the door they were cast into
[35:08] outer darkness and there was weeping and
[35:10] willing a national fee I'm only trying
[35:13] to make that little sideline of Defense
[35:15] to the cours Now by his way and this is
[35:18] it for
[35:22] tonight a lot of Brethren feel
[35:26] entitled The comforted of what they
[35:28] believe and what they
[35:30] know but they short on this
[35:33] oil there will come a time when churches
[35:37] pastors ministers in this message will
[35:40] realize they need something more than
[35:42] Mysteries information knowledge and 4our
[35:44] 5 Hour Services they need something more
[35:46] than that they really need the
[35:50] spirit when they begin to cry for that
[35:53] it just might be too late Saints tonight
[35:56] now begin to cry out you're individual
[35:59] in God this is not a church thing this
[36:02] is not a headstone Tabernacle thing this
[36:05] is a God promised thing Jesus died and
[36:10] the cross brought a channel to bring in
[36:12] the
[36:13] Gentiles he said L Paul said let's turn
[36:17] to the
[36:18] Gentiles God is about to turn to the
[36:20] Jews when God does that listen not one
[36:25] more Gentile will be sa the Gentile age
[36:28] will be completely over you can't say
[36:33] God um once more a whole on no this is
[36:37] the time he give us this is the space he
[36:40] give us the times of the Gentiles let's
[36:43] B it Heavenly Father such an odd
[36:46] exaltation tonight to bring a word and
[36:49] then flip it over to see how these Jews
[36:52] turn you down and they see the cost and
[36:56] the penalty and the years and the
[36:58] anguish what will happen and the
[37:01] prophecies already deal of what will
[37:03] happen to this Gentile dispensation
[37:06] father you said behold I send you Elijah
[37:09] the prophet before that great and
[37:10] terrible of the Lord father May the
[37:12] Believers be conscious may they be aware
[37:15] you're not trying to frighten them and
[37:16] scare them we just going to tell them
[37:17] the truth because the truth make them
[37:20] aware and be sensitive in making
[37:23] decisions and taking actions that will
[37:25] bring the correct results here we
[37:28] tonight God may you take out all shame
[37:30] and all embarrassment they in their own

[37:49] I'm undone of a man of unclean lips is
[37:52] something else when we come into God's
[37:53] presence it is something else where we
[37:55] feel stripped where we feel naked where
[37:57] we feel all alone oh Jesus come and
[37:59] comfort the people tonight Inspire them
[38:02] Lord in their closet Inspire them Lord
