[34:29] marriage afterwards they don't know
[34:31] where the feeling going through praise
[34:33] God because love was like a feeling love
[34:34] is more than that love is a choice for
[34:36] God so loved the world he watched The
[34:38] Wretched and the Sinners down there and
[34:39] give his only begotten son that was a
[34:41] choice of love that he did he act so
[34:43] love is not a talk love is not a feeling
[34:45] love is an action it's not right to love
[34:47] is to act the love is to do it's not the
[34:50] love and just talk and talk and talk he

[50:33] word to you the people didn't know what
[50:35] God thinks and God nature and God so God
[50:38] say instruct them tell them have no
[50:41] other gods before me tell them love the

[50:59] heartfelt Love Oh Glory to God this is
[51:02] what they had a love that will make them
[51:04] go and die for him oh glory to pay the
[51:07] price for him Peter didn't have that

[51:11] said nails and crucifixion and CR and
[51:13] Tes he said I not me I wasn't say
[51:16] something last
[51:17] night I was not there I did not hear

[51:49] crucified upside down even Deacon Steven
[51:53] and all they not listen to the they have
[51:55] their own sins this one is extra don't
[51:58] even bother with that lay not this into

[52:47] mind is the gate to the spiritu your
[52:49] minds open up and accept the spirit God

[1:35:42] spirit of error and the spirit of Truth
[1:35:44] beloved here we go let us love one

[1:35:52] God he that love not knowth not God for
[1:35:55] God is God is God is love the love W PC
[1:36:04] there but I'm bringing a point tonight
[1:36:06] in this was manifested the love of God
[1:36:08] towards us because God sent his only
[1:36:10] begotten son into the world that we
[1:36:12] might live through him hearing is love
[1:36:14] not that we love God but he loved us and
[1:36:17] sent his love son to be the priation for
[1:36:19] our sins beloved if God love us we ought
[1:36:22] to also love one another oh my no man
[1:36:25] has seen God at any time if we love one
[1:36:27] another here we go God dwell in us and
[1:36:30] his love is perfected in us so God have
[1:36:32] no love perfecting and you can love your
[1:36:34] brother and sister and somebody must
[1:36:35] screw up mess up tie you up hate you
[1:36:37] whatever it is for God to see how you
[1:36:39] act God not judging them God judging you
[1:36:42] oh glory to God hallelujah whosoever
[1:36:45] confess okay I skip that hearing is our
[1:36:47] love made perfect that we may have
[1:36:49] boldness in the day of judgment there is
[1:36:50] no fear in love but perfect love casteth
[1:36:54] all fear because fear are torment he
[1:36:56] that fear is not perfect in love we love
[1:36:58] him because he first loved us and that
[1:37:00] crowd Sunday if a man say I love God
[1:37:03] verse 20 and hated his brother he's a
[1:37:06] liar what what what Clarence say don't
[1:37:08] say
[1:37:11] liar CL has given a a polished way to
[1:37:13] say this liar Li in the message now
[1:37:17] don't call them Li but but the John
[1:37:19] saying here now he he had hat his
[1:37:20] brother a liar for he that loveth not
[1:37:23] his brother whom he had seen how can he
[1:37:25] love God whom he have not seen and this
[1:37:27] commandment have we from him that he who
[1:37:29] love God love his brother
[1:37:33] also Luke 14 wo verse 8 we going fast we
[1:37:37] going fast for verse 25 and they went on
[1:37:40] a great multitude with him he turned and
[1:37:42] said unto them great multitude this the
[1:37:43] crowd now if any man come to me Jesus
[1:37:47] and hate not his father mother wife wife
[1:37:51] and children and Brethren and sisters
[1:37:55] and his own life also that's the grinder
[1:37:58] you when Jesus roll you over so
[1:38:01] gr he cannot be my
[1:38:05] disciple now he is saying don't put
[1:38:07] nothing in front of
[1:38:09] me keep me Center keep me in front if
[1:38:14] you have a h mother father brother
[1:38:16] children whatever then verse 27 he said
[1:38:19] whosoever do not bear his cross
[1:38:22] and come after
[1:38:24] me oh waiting on the Lord he
[1:38:27] said come after me that's what the love
[1:38:31] have to make you do you're seeking him
[1:38:34] you're inquiring of him you're longing
[1:38:36] for him so God I want to meet you
[1:38:38] tonight I want to fellowship with you I
[1:38:41] want you to Wrap Me In Your Arms I want
[1:38:43] you to speak to me oh you're going after
[1:38:46] him and you're bearing your cross your
[1:38:48] cross amen don't look like the man you
[1:38:50] know he had the cross and he come he
[1:38:52] complain to God and the cross so big and
[1:38:54] heavy and God bring him and he say you
[1:38:56] have somebody talk about it like he come
[1:38:58] in a big room I know it's a story tale
[1:39:00] and and had lot of crosses he said pick
[1:39:01] pick the pick pick whatever one you want
[1:39:04] and he come and see the smallest one he
[1:39:05] pick it up he said buty want to come
[1:39:09] it same find the smallest cross to carry
[1:39:12] when he car said but same cross you're
[1:39:14] coming with you get smallest and you're
[1:39:18] complaining all right I believe but I'm
[1:39:22] closing that the Christian Life is a
[1:39:25] continual
[1:39:26] sacrifice he that will come after me let
[1:39:28] him deny them daily every day not 46
[1:39:32] days but I'm reading but every day take
[1:39:35] up his cross and follow me Christian
[1:39:37] Life is one
[1:39:39] continually the Christian loves to do it
[1:39:42] he doesn't do it with a grudge he does
[1:39:43] it with a feeling that he loves God he's
[1:39:46] glad he can do it it's a joy to serve
[1:39:48] the Lord Jesus it's a joy to sacrifice
[1:39:51] let's go it's a joy to Worship the Lord
[1:39:54] It's a joy to be called a fanatic for
[1:39:56] the kingdom of God's sake it's a joy to
[1:39:58] stand for the right and move from the
[1:40:01] wrong it's a joy to praise him it's a
[1:40:03] joy to abstain from the things of the
[1:40:05] world it's in their
[1:40:07] [Applause]
[1:40:10] heart Glory you got to forsake
[1:40:13] everything you have to take your choice
[1:40:16] now are you ready to forsake everything
[1:40:18] and follow after him if God goes to put
[1:40:20] in a thirst in your heart you'll forsake
[1:40:22] everything in the world I walked away
[1:40:24] from my own father and mother a home I
[1:40:27] got a wife and three children sitting
[1:40:28] right now if they would tell me no more
[1:40:30] preaching I'd walk right away from that
[1:40:32] home as much as I love them I'll die for
[1:40:35] them right there easily but Christ is
[1:40:37] all he's my objective my motive to him
[1:40:40] is to sacrifice everything that I have
[1:40:42] to follow him whether they call a
[1:40:43] fanatic whether they call me Divine
[1:40:45] healer a Holy Roller whatever it just be
[1:40:47] oh give the Lord some Praises glory to
