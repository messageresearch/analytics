way we invite you in our midst tonight we invite you in the world tonight to speak to us by your word and give us an entrance man entrance with minister to us tonight but we can approach your throne and crowd onto you in GCM I ask it email and God bless you since it's such a privilege to be here and I'm grateful that all of you are here tonight and we want to just go into the scriptures only read from Matthew chapter 6. I want to read from 1 to 18 Matthew chapter 6. we didn't from one feed and do the very interested in the scripture I know parts of it we touched before but I want to just look at something again Jesus speaks easy take heed that you do not your arms before men to be seen of them otherwise you have no reward of your father his name so Jesus is not seeing um as as if uh uh how you're going to do this but he is expecting you to do this to give give arms and then he tell me how to do it those two therefore window doeth thy arms do not form a trumpet before the other Hypocrites doing this in The Ghost and the streets that they may have Glory of men very nice unto you they have their reward windowed with arms let not thy let her know what thy right and do it got down arms may be in secret or you're given in secret and thy father will see you to the secret himself shall brought openly verse 5. Wendell Prius though shall not be as Hypocrites are for they love the priests standing in the synagogues in the corners of the streets that he may be seen of men very nice unto you they have the reward but when no priest entered into thy closet and when Lord shut their door pray to thy father with Siege and secret and thy father with season secret shall reward you openly so he's showing here that your whole operation in life is not a policeman it's not to do things to impress man it's it's a good consciousness to know that if you're given God is here to know if you're praying God is here okay so therefore he said but when you pray so he's digging down inside of you know use that vain repetitions as a he can do for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaker but be not therefore like unto them for your father knoweth what things you have need of before you ask him so it's not that you wouldn't ask him it's not that you would rock back with her attitude but you know our need of he would you love to ask no you still have to ask but you know he know what you have made up so he said you know who's nice after this manner therefore pray our father was just in heaven yet taking them come still worship them thy will be done in earth as in heaven then verse 11 give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom the power and Glory forever and ever this is a perfect prayer is that forgiveness in it it have the kingdom to come in it it have the will of God in it it have uh the worship Hallowed be thy name in it it has leaves nothing Temptation in it deliver some evil everything in it who is 14 and if you forgive men not forgive not many trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses verse 16 moreover 25. be not as hypocrites of Assad confidence for these figures that they may appear on the mental realize unto you they have their reward but don't when the fastest anoint their head wash their face the door appear not on demand of us but unto thy father which is in secret and thy father which is in secret shall we already openly may God bless his word so it's treating one Accord here When you pray when you give When you pray and when you fast not if you give if you pray or if you fast he is seeing or implying this is a win so I have a title I want to put this not if but when not if but when and we have a consolation tonight enough consolation is the Holy Ghost is poured out on individuals I want you to hold it in your heart tonight that the Holy Ghost is poured out on individuals even if there's no point in the church even if they are point out in the assembly it is still poured out on individuals so you tonight in your room in your home Wherever You Are you are individual that the Holy Ghost can pour out and the Holy Ghost don't have to ask permission from anyone to pour it upon you or to bless your life or to cleanse you or to purify you or to restore you or to heal you or deliver you God is suffering tonight now Jesus when he accused of victory I will know the story Mark 11 and in the morning they passed by they saw the Victory Drive from The Roots because Jesus spoke to the tree and said no man eat from thee so the next day they're checked for your child and Peter called him to remember children say master behold Victory which now Christus is withered away and Jesus and it's really certain to him have faith in God so you know we see the manifestation and there's a question about it a surprise to them look look look what happened it's dried up think about it your cancer trailer your disease driver the condition in your life leakage dried up God could traitor he said her feet in God for relation to you whosoever Shanks see under this mountain so Jesus give them the top of it spoken word Peter remove and beat our customers don't in his heart but shall believe that those things which he said shall come to pass he shall have whatever is here therefore I sent to you whatsoever things you desire When you pray so this is God's expectation from us now whatever do you desire we have to pray and believe that you receive them and you shall have them and when you start praying so what is condition after condition being legal here when you start praying make sure forgive if you are ought against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses don't worry about the text and so on so much I would I would put it back in the chat that'd be good you could look at it look back at the scriptures that we are sharing tonight so therefore praying is conditional if you have an old a grudge it can't forgive you know you you know God's not going to hear you you have to be able to drop it you have to be able to forgive when you stand praying so he expects to be praying forgive if you're old against any there's nothing wrong with having an ought any sense then that odds come people do wrong people upset you people hurt you people and you people rely on you treat you badly and so on and you as a human being you react but then when you come into praying that is when the case of what you have against someone comes into play because you won't go to answer your prayer you want to go to hear your prayer hear your voice so he says that if you do not forgive neither will your father in Heaven forgive your trespasses so then your Total Praise away some time if you don't prepare to forgive nobody problem you know the story about Society right she said the right thing and God told him to give her whatever she wanted because she pleased the Holy Spirit by her words and of time we talk about it we preach about it but um yet to see people make a conscious effort to speak correctly to speak the right thing unconscious you know sometimes you it's a temper whatever you have to take a hole of what you see because God is hearing and God heard them Jesus knew their thoughts their thoughts is allowed your thoughts evil thoughts even thinking contrary These Eyes is very very loud so so this is a happy right please the Lord the Holy Spirit spoke back and said Hattie ask anything that you will whatever you got you want find out if this is real or not ask anything healing of a crypto sister secondary ten thousand dollars to keep her from digging on the heels over there you'd restored to her well around nobody whatever you ask Citrus mountain and then he broke into something you see Yahoo was being taken place that's the ministry that we are entering into we are way up the road now he's prophesy I know soon the coming of the Lord Jesus and we have got to have Rapture and feet in a church that will be changed in a moment in a critical of an eye to go out so we're not going out on books we're not going out on tips we're not going our peace upon the church we go to or who the pastor is what mystery preach or any message that is not how we're going out we're going out based upon rapturing feet but he says or he said oh we he said oh let me read it again and we have got to have have Rapture and faith in a church that can be changed in a moment and treat them an eye to go out or we will not go but or we will not go but don't worry prophecy it will be there it will be there and when the power of Jesus church Rises without you but when as a title not if and when to tell the Devils a liar tonight tell that they have a discount feel this is the word of God and when the power of this church Rises it will bring it spiritually the power of that church Rises will bring expression the power of that church will bring the other president and then there will be a general Resurrection so there will be no Resurrection if there's no power so if we cannot preach power talk about power real equivalent Resurrection we're looking for human and I keep seeing it clear you know people like man-made religion because there's man doing it if they're doing it I want to do something they can't trust that God has paid the price and they receive Christ and receive his blood and they receive this pardon and receive his mercy and the free to access his throne and Grace they don't want that they want to our father to he'll be married they want to do this they want to play sharply Rosary they want to do so much things that they will think that they are doing something I tell you don't let the world creep in on you don't let the world get into your church is better and free it out fast it out until God comes down and dig a hole so God set up like a law when enemy must come the enemy they may not not living on the beach the enemy have a job to do to bring someone cool former lukewarm doubting questioning to keep us out of this Spirit look as soon as Christ recently dead and Peter and them are wrong went back fishing three and a half years it's promote efficiently combat fiction I go fishing and people have a whole bunch of followers following going man fishes Jesus they say we fish all night and caught nothing causing that to the right side The Voice spoke they go big and they got a lot of fish okay once man come out to the spirit he's in the flesh it's simple you have to despair you're in the flesh you live any flesh you talk any pressure we are going to flash here that's because in the spirit is a whole big difference so he said keep the joy of the Lord among the saints keep them prayed up that's what we hear tonight that's what I appreciate you coming out tonight because you got to do other things God every little place if no one seeks see a leak in his ark why he put some pitch in it so that's about the best thing I know to keep the leak out the world out is to stop the leak the best thing I know to do the only one way to do it that's prayer prayer stop the leak Prayer Changes Things so there's a leak in your life and you walk with God and your talk with God prayer this prayer tonight this time tonight is is to put that League let's continue the purpose of selling the Holy Ghost was for God to continue to appoint a people continually manifest God to the world that's the purpose not by our Creed not by denomination so not by tax and and and booklets not by denomination church but by but by the power of his resurrection by here we go again making his world real bye here we go taking his promise and standing on the side of the minority like what we are doing tonight and believe in God and what the black Skies move back and the power of God moving and take over that's what he wants you mean that's what he wants to move it yes that's what he wants that is what the Holy Ghost was sent for eign that is not what the Holy Ghost was sent for it was sent to make this word Real by taking his promise his promise standing on the side of the minority and believing God I watched the black Skies move back and the power of God moving and take over that's what he wants that's what Holy Ghost was sent for that's the cool person sent it for that's why he sent it prayer what is prayer prayer is the voice that goes into God's ear how I think about that it's astonishing that we meme humans could pray close our eyes and pray and we could break Dimensions naturally mentions what kind of a logical dimensions and bring all of that and break into the realm of what is impossible with man is possible with God Isaiah 46 that has not now known has done not heard that he Everlasting with God the Lord the creator of the enemies of the good fainted not neither is weary so now we feel retired I'm telling all that and you know like if you're entirely you don't want to say it again and no he's not married there's no such thing of his understanding he was 29 he gave it power to the thing power to who the thief power to the feet and to them that have no might increase that strength even the youths shall think and be very and he said I call you young men because you're strong but thin even huge shall think to me very and the young men shall utterly fall but they bless you here tonight they that wait upon the Lord now this is shy renew their strength God have mercy give us some give God some Praises tonight thee that weed upon the Lord shall be their strength these are multiple things illegals they shall run not be wary they shall walk and not freed prayer lives I want you to see prayer as a living thing you know just stay with a prayer on your finger for your prayer no prayer lives I preach this before I talk about it before prayer goes beyond the present prayer can be generational so sometimes you are here in this room because maybe your great grandfather prayed or your grandmother was praying less like Generations that are going to come Bless the people that's in my loins bless there's that future generation deliver them and save them and he the person died and gone great grandmother great grandfather grandmother grandfather whatever but their prayer lives a person can die but the prayer from your lips lives one before God to be answered in a season on time so tonight if your hair is green you have grandchildren your grandfather your grandmother you have children you have the right to pray for them pray over them you don't know what they're going through right now your children your grandchildren the more you pray the more you can pray The More You Prayed the more you can pray ER this incense goes before God don't let the senses of prayer go empty perishing it verse 1 says and when you have opened the seven seal there was times in heaven I bought this piece of half an hour and I saw seven angels which took before God and to them was given seven trumpets another angel came stood at the altar having a golden Center and it was given unto him much incense that he'd offered with the prayers of all things upon the golden altar which is before the trouble and the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the Saints ascended before God out of the Angel's hand and the angel took the sensor to live with fire on the Altar and cast it into the Earth and there were voices and thunderous and lightness and an earthquake the seven angels which had seven trumpets prepared himself the song now this is judgment about the strike the first thing just sounded and they had followed healing farming with blood and they were cast upon the earth a third part of the trees were burnt up on all the green grass was builted isn't it powerful but right under the Southern Sea of Silence the Bible speak about prayers of All Saints upon the golden altar which was Before the Throne is as if praise taught is as if prayers is bottom up until the season of time to cast it for answers to intervention I wrote here pray as a mystery sinful man of the Earth can sincerely look to God and God answers what a thing what a weapon what a tool we have to take it seriously Angels move Angelic movements because a man is praying prayer Bridges the dimension between UT and heaven where did I get that from from Daniel chapter 9. the Bible talk about in the first year Diaries the son of atheros the seat of the means which will meet King with Realm of the challenges and the first year between I Daniel understood by books a number of years aware of the word of the Lord came the dramatic Prophet that could he accomplished 70 years in the desolations of Jerusalem So Daniel had the books had the quotes that he was studying and he understand now time running out what did he do when you see time running out and I set my face unto the Lord God to seek by prayer and supplication with fasting I suck Lord and Ashes and I prayed unto the Lord my God and made my confession and said oh Lord the great and Dreadful God there's no message praying now this is the prophet praying this is not praying for somebody to hear your praying no no this is from the heart I pray unto the Lord my God and made my confession I said oh Lord the great and Dreadful God keeping the Covenant and mercy to them that love him and to them that keep his Commandments we have sinned so he is praying are you not seen they have sinned he is part of the package he's identified with the shame and with the glory we have sinned committed iniquity have done wickedly and have rebelled even the pattern from thy preception from thy judgments neither have we Half Men to die so that's the prophets which speak and thy meaning or Kings or princes or fathers to all the people who Lord righteousness belong unto thee but unto us confusion of feces as with this day to the men of Judah to the inhabit of Jerusalem unto all Israel that are near that are found through all the countries without us driven them because of their trespass than their trespass against the Daniel is focused in his prayer oh Lord to us belong longer to confusion of Feasts to our Kings or princes to our fathers because we have sin against thee to the Lord Our God we love mercies and forgiveness though we have rebelled unto him against him neither have you obey the voice of the Lord Our God to walk in his laws which he set before his servants and the prophets ye all Israel have transgressed that law even by departing that they might not obey their voice therefore the curse is put upon us and the oath that is written along Moses the servant of God because we have sinned against him and you confirm his word which you stick against him against our judges and judges and bring it upon us the great evil for Allah the whole heaven have not been done as I've been done upon Jerusalem I want to skip to verse 15. Oh Lord according to all our righteousness by this history that I anger unless he will be turned away from thy City Jews the Holy Mountain and you could take that and put it to your house together put into your heart they don't put into your life let that uncomfortable we because of our sins for the iniquities of fathers Jerusalem that people are becoming reproached to order about us now therefore oh Lord our God he's got a No-No he had a pre-advisor on his application and cause I face to shine upon thy Sanctuary that is desolate for the Lord's sake oh my God inclined an ear here so our prayer tonight is to catch the ear of God we're not praying to the will without praying just words you are actually praying to God's ear you won't go to here oh God inclined an ear and here open nine eyes and behold our destinations and the city which is called by their name for we do not present our supplication before all righteousness but for your great Mercies oh Lord hear oh God forgive oh Lord happen before not for I don't say oh my God for thy City like people are caught by many and whilst I was speaking and praying I'm confessing my sin at the center of my people Israel and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God for the Holy Mountain of my God while I was speaking in prayer even the man Gabriel whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning being caused to swiftly fly touch me about the time of the evening operation and he informed me and talk with me and said oh Daniel I am now Comfort to give this skill and understanding at the beginning of this application the Commandment came forth and I am coming to show thee for thou had greatly beloved therefore understand the matter who consider the vision so friends when Daniel start to pray Gable was commissioned to go unto him he was the lead because he had to fight his ritual demon activity and Demon power to get to Daniel and the prophecy of Daniel had stopped praying the angel had to stop coming think about that think how weighty and Powerful it is the angel is on his way to bring Revelation to bring Clarity to bring vision and that angel is dependent upon a man and Youth call upon God and if that man only hold back and stop he has to stop so the angel frightened the man is wrestling with God in prayer and as he is breaking through the angel is breaking through I want to challenge us tonight I am included let us make our house a House of Prayer I'm not talking about the church now I'm talking about your home I'm talking about your body I'm talking about you and I I'm gonna wrap up in your home stretch I think this is important tonight not if but when the prime God said in Genesis 2 manner dominion over the world he gave him look me over all things he lost his worship one he lost his sonship two he lost his domain tree and Satan took it over but brother we are waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God who will come back and take it over again waiting for and this is drilling down into details now waiting for the fullness of time so in other words the manifestation of the sons of God cannot come outside the fullness of time time must come to its fullness or waiting for the fullest of time and then he's clarifying when that gonna be when the pyramid gets to the top now to the top is where Veronica misses that Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness then probably came on probably kindness you get in charity or the Capstone or the headstone Holy Spirit written when the pyramid gets to the top when she's continuing the full sons of God will manifest it when we manifested when the pyramid comes to the top when the power of God will walk out you see Hallelujah and we take every Power that Satan got away from him that's what you're gonna happen to do so we are not called to be wimpy we're not going to be slacker this is not called to be weaklings but we are called to this this is not if this is when I'm almost done in Oneness he said don't Adam Adam Eve let me cry out to you don't listen to the LIE of the devil anymore still with God's word it is thus fear the lord stay with his word to separate from it is breaking your fellowship with God God's Oneness by the Holy Spirit and if you say you've got the Holy Spirit and it's not in agreement with the word then you're not honest with God that is not God's mother the spirit that you got agrees with this word and Manifest this word and make this word power to act the same with the dear and then he said let's see it together had the congregation to see it with him Oneness and they say Oneness with god with God is to have to have God's spirit God Spirit In You in you agreeing agreeing with the word with the word all the word the whole word the whole word and to make it and to make it manifested manifested in power this is almost like a legal document or legal phrase God Oneness with God is to have God's spirit in you agreeing with the word not just with the word all the way not just all the word the whole word to make it manifested in power there you are that is one is for God when that power Works in me it begins Clarity itself Works in you we are one when the power of the Holy Ghost In Me Works in you there's no disagreement the word is there it works it make it what it is God made flesh in You by his word the word made fresh something was wondering if there's a possibility you put his hand upon his posts and stood here before them the Philistines celebrating having a great time they forgot to worship they forgot to watch them and they begin to think God is still God I know yes I've tried to put into the test I know he's telling me it's called it is me that is wrong I'm the one that sinned they didn't notice the tears running out of them blinded sockets tripping off his chin he didn't notice his lips moving you know what I've done wrong let me die with the Philistines so here's another human being now here's a man who we will say pay for his sins report he sowed but he's about the utter words they're going to break dimensions it's about other words they're going to get into the ear of God listen to this he wanted God word manifested before that Jesse now oh Danny wanted his own life oh if that desire could come into the church again he wasn't paying for a new order a new denomination but the word of God might be made known again the promise that he once had I come back to him again he was aware of what would happen if his prayer was answered are you aware what would happen if God answer your prayer he was ready here we go he was in deadliness oh if the church could really get like that then he cried out slowly he was praying it's possible Lord it is possible and I want you to pray that tonight if possible God could heal you tonight it's possible delivery tonight it's possibly your homework free tonight it's possible the enemy that ramping through your family could be rewarded tonight it's possibly stand here with my big friend I'm here my ears rolled out I couldn't see how to whip them no more because my eyes is blind I couldn't see where I was going but it is possible you could let it happen again you're through your poor then you scream out once more Lord just once more just once if the church Glory cried out once more let us see your power once more and as he cried and after God I can see them muscles begin to swell every five and his body begin to twist the Holy Ghost was coming upon him then he stretched for his hands again with the power of the Holy Ghost upon him down went the building he killed more than they that that day that he didn't always satisfied it has always been that way when the power of God come the big destructive isn't full amen and this is final I'm going to spend some time tonight but I think I just felt that I wanted to get this in tonight or Brandon winner Atomic bombers and people are scared in the Pentagon they don't know what to do he says let the people speak about us tonight let it at the flock that little Remnant that God will give him talk about that Elijah calling out to God Watch What Happens so all this here we are getting enough pressure yet I'm gonna sound strange we haven't had enough yet that way I prefer to come down here there will be a national shootout there will be a power that they have never seen before the trouble of it is this time is going to be too late for them then doors will be closed remember we're at the end time pray so friends we're not looking for the government that come on cruises don't want to be hiding because we believe this message that is not what I see in here there's a prophecy hanging over us that we will go to call not in God when your bills are being paid you're sleeping good at night you're eating food you only transport yeah garage sometime you want sometimes two whatever no Britain you go to church as a routine you're going to choose because there were people doing on Sunday as a routine nobody and Isaac but Isaac massively brought it out about that man to teach us going afterwards I think he gave up he gave up trying to enter in first he just become like dices Facebook what is social social Gathering every time you know the angel comes probably whatever are wrong now just in case something happened but God knew his persistence is perseverance God knew his diligence his application Jesus came straight to him and said well you leave whole that question tonight there are some people don't want to be prayed for because they don't want to deliver they don't want to come out over the end just yet you don't want to give it some more time you're not ready yet if you want to come out you come up now God wants his people to pray could somebody say Amen okay when Israel got so tucked in a condition that they could not go any further their time was fulfilled their burden was father and they could thought at the beginning to pray and when the people began to pray then God begins to hear it's time for God to fulfill so even there is a prophecy of fulfillment something has to press the people somebody have to press you and I to get us into prayer I went I'm on my music that sword it was time for the work to be fulfilled they went to pray to God and it is usually here we go those who pray is the one who got the burden the one who gets something is good for free that's what they need to do so last quote when the people begin to pray when Israel start praying for a prophet God had the prophet God had a prophet all the time because God always went to jump ahead of them he had the man prepared but are you ready judge he was waiting for the people to go to pray in the people to want it how to become I'm going to stop right there okay how typical I could say of it today what we need today is not a revivalist it's not another man to some great organization who can get all the groups to organize together all we need to do is a prophet sent from God with a message that will condemn The World God may have that man if the people just benefit you know what I'm speaking he is coming somewhere but the people got to want it God is God doesn't just shoot things down your throat you have to want it blessed are they that will hunger and tears from righteousness for they shall be filled he said and we said it in last service he cannot force you to be saved against your will he cannot heal you against your will you don't want to be healed you will feel sick you don't want to be saved you will be lost and go to hell you cannot force himself is the behold I stand at the door and knock you have to open that door and let them in there are the rooms in the house that close up you have to open all the doors you say Jesus you are welcome let us heavenly father I was so excited tonight I was couldn't wait to be here to share these things with your people tonight of you not not of if but when you expect us to give you expect us to pray you expect us to fast you expect us to

there's much more things to expect and to have great expectations for when you want the church to have great expectations you want to choose to have great ambition father you said you want the church to ask for great things oh God when Elisha said ask for double portion he was truly asked a hard thing you want us to ask for her thing and what I'm asking for Revival don't strike every home every heart every family I ask for stew enough spirit I ask for bringing all the love this year I break another cold and formal and lukewarm and negative and dry a complete breaking out to that law they're breaking out of the humanistic realm into the realm of divine revelation father oh God I mean you bring us truly in the spirit Lord to hear thus hear the Lord bring us in the spirit Lord to get Revelation for Revelation is prevalent power or Glory prevailing power move the ninth Lord May there be a burden of interest in your word a burden and interest and division a burden and interest in the things of God Daniel he quoted Lord he saw my books that a time was rolling on in and he began to seek with his whole heart God when you give your word on the scripture you read when you give a hands not if when we pray not if when you fast not if God we don't have to constrain fast into once a month Lord as individuals we can fast whenever we want to fast always part of our own lives Lord

of asking we're not tired of Believing by faith we walk and do things Lord and our prayer lines and and I'm praying for the sick and everything else we will continue to do as we have done we have continued to press one and you're going to confirm your word with signs and one is a Miracles father preserve your people may they have peace Lord may they have a blessed evening father anointing officers in the church I'm not the ministry the ministers the elders the deacons Lord oh god look over them Father they have fought all these years old some are getting older someone getting tired and wary but Lord I pray that strength coming in a man to fight this good fight of faith and like Paul when he comes to the end of his rule he said fought a good fight I've kept the faith I've finished my course Lord made me so far that may we look back and see the race that we have run and we can see we have run a good race we have finished the course we have kept the faith we've fought a good fight father may we fight a good good for a good fight for them fight tonight for what we know is our own we are fighting for Revival we are fighting for the Holy Ghost we are fighting the breakout in a natural realm oh God Jesus is the parable where those seeds were choked by the cares of this life by the things of this world see that were planted on good ground but allow the vines of life to choke them Father God break every Vine off tonight break what is choking us break what is affecting us big what is hidden in the flow of the spirit to bring forth fruit unto you break it tonight Lord need to be broken we don't want to take nothing for granted father Luke counselor didn't take it for granted he said once more Lord he knew he had access he knew he was a son he knew if he prayed something going to take place father God tonight me the people break through father may they be a breakthrough in the homes in the family the Liturgy the sluggishness the slutness the looseness the lack of prayer the lack of dedication lack of devotion like a study lack of being in the atmosphere oh God it's not good just for Friday only it's not good for Sunday only it's not good for Wednesday only it got to be every day maybe or daily Walk Like The Lily pressing this week how about the mock about the my pressing this rate until it comes to the top to serve others Bless the people I pray in Jesus
