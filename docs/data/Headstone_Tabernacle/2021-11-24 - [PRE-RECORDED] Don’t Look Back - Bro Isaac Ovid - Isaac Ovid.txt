service the devil is in trouble the devil is in trouble this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah keep playing softly we'll be having a prayer line after the service father lord and me as the word continues to go forth lord even before the prayer line made testimonies begin to break forth with the people catching a faith from the word lord to catch the vision lord that it's already done it's already finished you lord who started the work lord is able to complete it and you died on the cross and you already paid the price you don't have to pay it again it's already paid for father god may you touch your people touch me and may you bless the word and the reading of it and the opening of an talent to your scriptures lord for the next few moments in the precious name of jesus christ and the church says amen and amen i just want to read one portion of scripture before we get ready for the prayer line saint luke 17 and verse 26 this scripture and this subject has been burning in my heart for a few weeks now i can't shake it so i know there's something in there for us this morning see in luke 17 and verse 26 and as it was in the days of noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot did it eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they build it but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus in other words so shall it be shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed in that day he which shall be upon the housetop and his stuff in the house let him not come down to take it away and he that is in the field let him likewise not return back remember lot's wife may the lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated in the presence of the lord this morning and i feel like we are in a hospital room this morning i don't know how recently my wife had to visit a doctor and she went early 5 30 6 in the morning around 8 o'clock i checked in she said she's still waiting nine o'clock checked in she's still waiting 9 30 is checked in she's still waiting because when you go by the doctor you can tell the doctor right now right now the doctor sometimes comes when he's ready to come he knows the different matters he has to deal with and when we come into the house of the lord it's in it's a hospital room jesus when he was he said they that are well have no need of a physician but he came as the great physician so he's in the building this morning to deal with different situations to deal with different conditions and he is a deliverer but for the deliverer to operate he has to be activated because god is very clear in his laws with jurisdiction he is god of heaven and he gave dominion to man on the earth so when we pray what we actually do is open the door to allow god to move it's reason god has to find somebody to operate through because if it was not that principle he would operate without humans and then we would understand god in that context so that's why he would use prophets and they become his mouthpiece because when god came down and spoke he said let moses speak because when you speak we can deal with it so god always uses a man and he always uses prayers access into this realm and into this jurisdiction you believe that this morning so we are here this morning for a special deliverance service because man needs to be delivered and that deliverance and the need for deliverance dates back to genesis when man fell from his condition he fell from his position he fell from where god left him and when god asked the question adam where daw he was not asking for his physical location he was asking about his spiritual condition god knows exactly where you are physically he knows that but his question to adam was where are you because i left you in a certain position as a believer i left you in a position of authority but you are no longer there what happened what went wrong and it was that adam had disobeyed an instruction that god gave to him and that disobedience as brother branham said drinking smoking fornication adultery carousing pornography whatever it is that's not sin that is the attributes or the behaviors that come out of sin sin is unbelief and if you really believe god it'll make you behave a certain way if you really be leave god it'll make you act a certain way if you really believe god it will make you do things that are contrary to your training if you believe god it'll make you do things that are contrary to maybe what your parents said to you if you believe god it'll make you go against what your teacher told you because when you hear from god god speaks in a way to us that doesn't make sense all the time and it's not supposed to make sense because the bible said my thoughts are higher than your thoughts the fact that his thoughts are higher than our thoughts means it doesn't have to make sense to us all the time but he promised to reveal certain things to us and those things which are revealed they can now belong to us because it's within our comprehension outside of that we have to trust god for the journeys that he takes us through to bring us to perfection the journey that he takes us true to bring us to a realization so the trials and the ups and the downs and over the speaking about you may have been spoken drinking whatever it was in the past the journeys that we have gone through to be here this morning there is no accident in it there is no mistake in it because god i say this all the time it's either god is in control or he's not in control he can be in the middle somewhere it is either god is in control or god is not in control if god is in control it means he's in control of where you are today he's in control of the job you have he's in control of the house you're living in whether you like it or you don't like it you have to accept the fact that he is in control if he's not in control and that's a whole different story but i believe he's in control because he is omnipotent he is omniscient he is all-powerful there's nothing he cannot do there's nothing he cannot fix he could move governments he did it when jesus had to be born he could produce money he put gold in the fish and when the fish they found it there is no situation that he's not capable of able to and has the ability to change to twist to turn so we have no excuse this morning but to give god worship and to give god praise and to give him thanks in the midst of the trial that he and his wisdom carefully sat down and planned out for us for our benefit our trials are for our benefit our problems are for our benefit our failures are for our benefit because he promised to work it out can the church say man but the problem said missing limbs will be restored can i have a volunteer this morning to have your limb removed so we can restore it nobody wants a volunteer to be blind but blind eyes have to be opened nobody wants a volunteer to be deaf but the deaf ears have to hear so god in his wisdom allowed things to happen to you allow things to happen to your family and like job you could stand there and say do the skin worm destroy my body yet in my flesh i will see god [Music] [Applause] nothing could happen to you nothing could happen to your family unless god allows it to happen and if he allowed it to happen it's a greater purpose behind this and we have to accept that and that gives us a reason to thank god that in the midst of the lord give the lord take it away blessed be the name of the lord can the church say amen [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah so i have a thought this morning for a few minutes you already had the message but i have to get this out i'm pregnant with this this morning don't look back don't look back that's the title this morning don't look back if you came here this morning don't look back if you want to walk with god don't look back we sing the song when we get baptized i have decided to follow jesus no turning back no turning back so i want to remind the church this morning about don't look back don't look back to your always don't look back to your old friends don't look back to where god took you from even peter before he got the holy ghost when jesus died he looked back not only did he look back he went right back to his former employment that jesus pulled him from god didn't pull him from fishing for him to go back fishing but when he lost something he went back to where he was before and for somebody to be backslidden it means they are not where they were pulled to they went back to where they were before because if god pulled you out of something and you stay out of that something then you cannot be backslidden but the reason we have deliverance services is because somebody steps back from where god placed them and the different reasons why we step back the lust of the eyes or lusts of the flesh the pride of life the cares of life our jobs our families conflict marital problems financial problems all of these things are designed and they come at us and we have a choice to make every day we have a choice do i stand my ground do i go back do i go forward and for anybody who found themselves stepping back it's because you decided nobody forced you to do it you decided to not pray you decided to not come to church you decided to talk to your friend before talking to god black sliding is not an immediate happening it is a process it is a slow process it's a slow process of losing your joy it's a slow process of losing your feet it's a slow process [Music] [Applause] but thank god and restoration doesn't have to be a slow process thank god that when jesus was at that wedding and they ran out of wine he said bring some water and with the branham said that jesus bypassed the picking of the grapes jesus bypassed the fermenting of the grapes jesus bypass all of that and in as they were pouring he said how they keep this wine for last the best wine jesus not just turn the water into wine he aged the wine because the quality of wine is age so it means that god bypassed time to restore what they needed so i don't care how long you've been back sitting this morning god could restore your family he could restore your house he could restore your health he could restore your children and not just could he wants to he wants to restore your children he wants to restore your joy not just wants to he will restore your children he will restore not just will he must restore he has to restore he's obligated to restore he can't help himself his heart is beating fast this morning because somebody is crying out to him it doesn't leave that tough to be your voice [Applause] you may be seated for a few minutes there's a cry from within that you can't even put into words the seed in us cries out the seed in your soul cries out because the word is the believer you are not even the believer but the word in you is crying out for something you try to drown the cry with alcohol you try to drown the cry with your word problems but that cry is still there and he is able this morning to answer the cry he's able this morning to break the chains that i've held you have held you all these years some people in church and chained up people out of church unchained up but this morning don't look back the egyptians you see today you will see them no more forever today is a new day it's a new season it's a new hour god himself has come down you may be seated can i talk to you a little bit it's interesting that out of every age that god compared the end to he didn't compare to the age of moses or the golden age of david or the great prophetic age of elijah you see as it was in the days of noah as it was in the days of lot those are the ages those are the eras the times the dispensations the epochs that he compares our day to and he brought the similarities and he sat out a church they built it they planted they married they had wives and he brought the similarities of what it was which was normal living people want to get married they want to build their house they want to go to work they want to have a job they want to get a nice car they want to survive they want to be safe these are natural things and jesus is painting the picture that the issue for many people is not even the spiritual because the natural does impact the spirit the case of this life is what leads to the decay in the spiritual realm and that is why we have to remember lot's wife and i said on wednesday night you can't talk about lot's wife we don't know her name we don't know how old she was we don't know how tall how we don't know her identification is locked lot's wife that's how she is known to us that's all we know about her in terms of describing her but we know her behavior we know what happened to her and when we go back to genesis we can't talk about lord's wife unless we talk about a lot and lot is of no mention if it's not for abraham because it's because of abraham we know a lot if god didn't call abraham we are children of abraham and we know these things if god didn't call abraham who is lot but the bible tells us abraham had two brothers and one of his brothers died and that was lord's father and for some reason i don't know what it was it attracted a lot to abraham but when god spoke to abraham lot say i'm coming with you something in lot was attracted to something in abraham that attraction had to be real because abraham didn't even know where he was going so it had to be something about abraham's approach something about abraham's attitude that attracted lot to follow him in the first place abraham the bible said was seeking a city whose builder and maker was god he wasn't looking for a big bank account or a platinum visa credit card or a nice house he was looking for a builder a city made by god he was not about the natural things he was not about natural wealth he wasn't about natural ambition are you with me this morning don't look back i'm not taking too long with you but i want you to get this because many of us we find ourselves caught in this position lot is under abraham's leadership he's a part of abraham's house his family worships at abraham's altar and the bible said that it was conflict there was strife between the houses now i want to draw clearly to the church this morning the issue was not spiritual it was not doctrine it was not quotes it was not scripture it was the natural things you park your car here i don't normally park here the bible said they didn't have enough room so the natural things i need i want to expand my house but this person too close to me so i try to expand and he tell me my offense bigger than natural things so i want to make the point that it was a natural problem a material problem a business problem that led to the conflict it was not that lot did not believe it was not that lot's wife did not believe it was to create peace within the family that abraham as the senior said to the junior you choose for the sake of peace we are too good for us to have our people fighting like this it was a natural situation and many times in our homes and our families we have natural arguments there are people who come to church upset not because of a spiritual issue in the house but an argument in the house is there anybody in the house this morning an argument between husband and wife son and daughter oh you don't want me to come to your house this morning huh husband and wife and house and neighbor you on your way to church in this argument with your neighbor argument over who did breakfast and who washes the dishes natural problems and it throws the spiritual perspective out of line and under the pressure of the natural problem lot i want you to picture a lot now he has to make a decision abraham is not choosing for him abraham is not making a recommendation to him lot has to choose for himself and every one of us in this room this morning we have to choose for ourselves because that's how god organized it that you have a choice to worship or not to worship you have a choice to pray or not to pray you have a choice to believe or not to believe you have a choice to accept or not to accept you have a choice to come to church or not come to church you have a choice to pay your tithe or not pay your tithe you have a choice to pray or not to pray [Applause] you have a choice to cheat on your wife or not to cheat on your wife that's a choice you have a choice to save or not to save or you could spend your money stop it that's a choice life is about choices we're going to have a prayer line today and you have a choice how you approach the prayer line if you are here today because you're looking for a blessing or you want to choose life and choose eternity and choose redemption and choose not going back from where you came and choose real deliverance because repentance is not just saying i'm sorry it's a change of behavior are there any bible believers in the house this morning [Applause] i'm not going to be too long with you but we're waiting on the doctor right now i'm operating as a nurse right now because the great physician is here to operate i'm checking the blood pressure i'm checking your bmi i'm doing a urine sample this morning checking your blood sugar level before the doctor could operate making sure that the test results are in that your heart is right that your heart is open up so that he can operate without without reservation that your door is open because he said i stand at the door and knock and if any man open up i'm going to come in and stop with him [Applause] [Music] you may be seated [Applause] [Music] i saw something yesterday until people want to be delivered you will anoint them with oil and have greasy demons i say it one more time until people want to be delivered you can anoint them with oil as much as you want you'll have greasy demons the man who was beating up preachers when he came into the house where the branham was and the ministers left the platform and he challenged the prophet the prophet as a short man stood right there when all the other ministers ran for their lives when that man came up to the prophet the prophet said you're going to fall over my feet because you have challenged the lord he didn't challenge god he didn't challenge the prophet he challenged god because i was god's man when the police came because the police the law got involved see will this man be alright he said no because he worshipped the spirit that's upon him he wants to be that way he wants to be that way you have to want to be delivered i am tired of having services you talk to people the branham said it hurt him when he preached certain things and he had to say it over and over and over again and the people did not respond it wears down the preacher it's the same frustration a teacher would have in a school you stand in front of a classroom and you teach and you tell them you have to make something about yourself and they spend all this time the good teachers they do it and it hurts them when they see children with potential waste waste their potential so there is abraham he's waiting for a lot to tell him where he wants to go and the bible said that a lot made a decision he did not decide to backslide he didn't decide to leave the church he didn't decide to take his family out of church lot made a decision believing that it would work out lot made a decision believing that his family would maintain the values that they were raised up under lot made a decision at that time that he thought was the best decision he could make he made a decision not to go into sodom but to move close to sodom the baby said he pitched his tent towards he leaned in a direction and i shared on wednesday and i shared in another place i said listen what you may be able to handle speaking to the fathers in the house your family may not be able to handle because lot was able to survive this whole story as we know about but he lost children in the process he lost his wife in the process so weigh your decisions prayerfully before doing anything can the church say amen so what the bible says and black sliding i can imagine mrs lot gets close to sodom that's a look at the clothes look at the styles look at lot the fashion man of prestige he thought he made a good decision for his family because by moving close to sodom he had more customers he moved to the city i'm preaching it because they build it they planted they married a lot of people say a lot had two daughters read the bible he had more than two daughters because he had daughters who were married and they were sons-in-laws in scripture two left with him but he lost daughters so he had daughters who married lot would have built it he was a businessman he was a wealthy man because it was wealth that created the problem abraham's prosperity and lots prosperity grew to the point that they could not coexist the bible said lot was found at the gate of sodom the gate of sodom is the commercial center of the city so he was at the business center when these two angels came and he bowed down to them i said on wednesday night that god was finishing up with abraham and the bible said the angels were getting up and walking and the bible said abraham was leading them along the way when god said to abraham by the way shall i hide from you it was almost in passing that he stayed since that since the conversation he had went so well and i told him i'm going to return according to the time of life let me just share something with you while i'm why are we walking why are we walking i'm about to go i've heard a cry in sodom and i want to investigate to see if this thing is as bad as i'm hearing because if it's as bad as i'm hearing judgment is coming and i can imagine the the level that abraham had to have to almost hold god's hand if it were and say hold up hold up hold up it can be your way for you to just judge everybody like that that's not how you do things i'm paraphrasing now that's not how you operate you are a feared judge if there be fifty would you not spare them and god say okay i'll spare them and the bible said abraham started to plead he said i am but dust i am nobody i am nothing forgive me if i push it myself but if it's five less than 50 would he destroy it and we know this we understand this and abraham pleaded down to 10 and two angels went into sodom for one reason and one reason only deliverance this is a deliverance service one reason and one reason only deliverance because with deliverance is always judgment but as pertains to believers it's deliverance judgment is to the world so with deliverance is judgment hallelujah and the angels get there and we know the story lot brings them in the men of the city try to get them lot offers his two daughters who had not known men virgins to the men and they said we don't want them we want the men that came into the house when lot said no you can't have them the men of the city say who lotting he is you are outsider trying to fit in here that's i'm paraphrasing how you become a judge over our lifestyle read the bible and at that point the bible says that the angels pulled lot in blinded the men and the bible said it was only exhaustion that stopped those men in their blinded conditions trying to find the door because there was spirits upon them spirits upon them are we dealing with spiritual warfare lot's wife would have been seeing all of this interaction so she knows how the people live now many times we look at lot as a compromiser and in part we could say yes he ended up in sodom but i want to read one scripture for you to see how peter justified lot in second peter two and verse four ii peter two verse four for if god spared not the angels that sin but cast them down to hell and deliver them into chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment and spared not the old world but save noah the eighth person a preacher of righteousness bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly until in the cities of sodom and gomorrah into ashes condemn them with an overthrow making them an example listen what sodom and gomorrah is an example unto those that after should live ungodly so for all gomorrah is a memorial to those that would live ungodly against god's way as a reminder to you of the consequence and delivered the bible goes on just lot so peter justified a lot just lot vexed listened a lot vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked now there are people here this morning who say they want to be delivered are you vexed with the conversation of the wicked are you all up in the conversation does the conversation of the wicked bother you or it has have you accepted it and you tolerate it and people know that they could talk that way around you because you never fight it it never vex you have you been vexed because lot was in a messed up condition but the bible says he was still vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicket anybody with me have you become tolerant have you lowered your guard so much that you just allow any kind of conversation around you you know the branham said there are certain things he said he didn't let certain people into his car because he said one time a man came in the car and spoke a blue streak what he said had a color read the message words have power so lot in his condition although he was in a backslidden condition as it were found himself in sodom he was still vexed with the conversation we're not where his behavior yet we have rich conduct and attitude and the homosexuality and that's not we reached that party it's just a conversation it's an embarrassment when christians are involved in foolish conversation because life and death is in the power of the tongue and your lips your mouth is reserved for spoken word spoken word that's why you are temples of the holy ghost so the spoken word god to use you as a vessel let's go further for that righteous man so peter called lot a righteous man you call him something else now because the angels went into sodom to get the righteous so it was lots righteousness that covered his family it was lots righteousness that made a way for his family to even hear the message oh come on and you young people who want to be disrespectful to your parents it is their righteousness they may have false but god sees them as righteousness because he sees through the blood how dare you disrespect your parents [Applause] yes lot had his problems but there's blood for problems oh come on somebody help me this morning yet look messed up but there's blood from messing up oh come on somebody come on somebody anybody in the house this morning [Applause] so we dealt with i want to read it carefully because i know many of you have not read this scripture and delivered just a lot so peter in his ministry had to come in the new testament to justify the perception of lot just like who we didn't know until peter made it clear because if you read genesis alone you will see lot as this backslider and if it wasn't for abraham that had no chance but peter brings another perspective yes lock messed up yes abraham pleaded for him but we didn't know about the sighing and the crying that lot was going through the travail of a father the travail of a husband the travail of maybe a grandfather we don't know but a lot was there he wasn't captive but he was in travail he was in trouble but he was in travail of spirit travail of soul he knew he was not where he was supposed to be he didn't have the strength to deliver himself he needed deliverance but it was a travail in his spirit he was crying out for something anybody in the house this morning i want to read a scripture carefully and deliver just lot vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked so the two things i want you to understand that because we had put a mark upon those who sigh and cry for the abomination in the city but what does that really mean this is it here he is vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked sighing and crying he's burdened bothered by it and the bible goes on for that righteous man dwelling among them in seeing and hearing now we come into actions not just words in seeing and hearing vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds now we're dealing with the behavior so lot is there at the gate of sodom and he's dying within himself he's dying watching his wife feed from him because she is now different from when they came to this house her behavior has changed his children who he had an expectation of the bible said that they went and found worldly men and married them and that's the bible can we go on so the angels are there with a lot to say a lot is there anybody else that you care about i want to ask this morning is there anybody else that you care about who should be delivered because we came to let you know that we have come to judge this whole city is going to be destroyed so i would advise you get your whole family get them in to hear this message the angel is specific you have son-in-law do you have any other daughters he goes down in genesis 19. and the bible says about two verses or so later lord goes to his son's in law and the bible said the in law mocked him and the bible said that lot lingered let me read it i'm almost done don't look back friends i find in genesis three kinds of believers lot sons and law were clearly unbelievers they did not believe they mocked him let me get it and lot went out and speak under his sons-in-law which married his daughters plural and said up get you out of this place for the lord will destroy the city but he seemed as one that mocked under his sons-in-laws they didn't accept it and when the morning arose at the angels he is not seeing arise take thy wife and thy two daughters which are here we don't know where the other daughters are but these that are here lest they be consumed in the iniquity of the city and i could imagine lot that my son while he lingered you know what it is as a parent to stand there and you don't know what's going on with your other daughters your son's in law you know your wife in a condition and these two daughters who have stayed with you the bible said they have not known any man they are the ones who at least try to behave so lot is lingering we don't know why he's lingering but maybe he lingered because he's hoping the other daughters come to their senses maybe he's hoping the sons and laws decide at least let me take the risk and go out what could go wrong if you write us alive if he wrong i'll come back but these young men were so delusional that didn't even take the calculated risk i want you to think about it friends i don't think you've ever heard this presented like this while he lingered the angels now are forced to take action the bible says the men laid hole upon his hand and upon the hand of his wife and upon the hand of his two daughters in other words the angels are now physically removing them they are no longer depending on words to move them brother pop well they are physically extracting them they are kidnapping them they are arresting them physically taking them out because the words were not enough lot was still lingering the air to physically take them out i want you to understand now two dimensions of this one is god is serious about deliverance so serious about deliverance that he will not just use word alone to get you he has to use force if necessary to get you [Music] he is so serious about deliverance and his promise to deliver he made a promise to abraham to get his family and god cannot break his promise so god had to have the angels them angels had their pieces on they said all the deacons are earpieces pull them out extract them now move them out now no more waiting time is gone no time left take them out put them unconscious if you have to but get them out knock them out if you have to but take them out break their foot if you have to but get them out because judgment is coming but there's a promise over them they cannot die with the rest [Music] they must be delivered [Music] god will do whatever it takes to break you out of evil break you out of sin to break you out of the world you better believe it [Applause] can you take a little more almost done soon we finished the scripture with that and while he lingered the men laid hole upon his hand and upon the hand of his wife and upon the hand of his two daughters the lord being merciful unto him so this force this kidnapping this extraction was mercy it's like a father pulling a child roughly from a fire because a child don't know what's going to happen and the child cry because you pull them and they feel bad about being pulled but that's mercy [Applause] when the word comes to you in a way that makes you feel uncomfortable because you're not living right that's mercy because it's a judgment seat and it's just blood on the judgment seat that makes it a mercy seat the lord being merciful unto him and they brought him forth and set him without the city or outside the city and it came to pass when they had brought them fought abroad that he said escape for thy life now that to me is self-explanatory if somebody says to you brother joe run for your life that way what what what would you do escape for your life look not behind in other words don't look back neither stay at all in all the plane and then we'll do around here there's nothing more for you here less though be consumed and i'll stop reading there and work to bring this to close musicians and get ready they are challenged to move quickly but the branham in doing prayer lines and in doing ministry he would say the angel is here receive him quickly stand up right away because if you don't respond right away he said he'll move on respond quickly lot's wife would have grown up under abraham would have had the decline while she was in sodom would no doubt had known that these are angels that would have come would have seen the manifestation the blinded eyes would have heard lot repeat the message would have been told by the angels escape don't look back they start to move out it's only when they were all judgment strike so when judgment struck they were already out there was something to go back to because judgmental was already striking deeper than that in that custom lot would have been in front leading his family out friends i don't know when lot found out what happened to his wife because he couldn't look back so he is walking running moving trying to get to safety and somewhere along the journey his wife has turned to salt but he's still going maybe he was talking to them saying how are you going to be back there how are you going to be back there and then after a while he gets no response this is real friends this is not church why is he there he can't stop moving because he's a believer because god can only prove his word by believers so as a believer he has to keep moving because if he stops moving he is not a believer what if you're there yes i'm here yes i'm here wife is there wife wife no response sons and laws they were unbelievers they stayed back they were judged up until lot's wife turned around we didn't know what she was she acted like a believer she walked like a believer she talked like a believer but when she looked back she sure who she was she was a make-believer because while she was in sodom she didn't realize sodom came into her friends whatever is in your heart will come out everything as it is in darkness that you want to keep covered up is going to come out there's no secret you know you're not hiding nothing anymore i want you to wonder i'm you you can make that place something softly that's why if she's walking out she hears it she she believes she's hearing the cries she's hearing the judgment she's seeing a lot moving the daughters may be behind her and something is eating her up because they were telling her to come out of sodom but nobody had taken what was in her out of here lot couldn't deliver himself but she came physically out but she was still there she was physically out but her heart was still there there are people here this morning in the tabernacle but your heart is not here your heart is not here this morning [Music] your body is here you have the signs and emotions how many churches this morning are filled with corpses people's bodies and they have all the emotional movement but their heart don't love the lord said if you love the world and the things of the world the love of god is not even in you [Music] her issue was the styles the fashion the lifestyle the culture what's your attraction lot when thinking you would have a bigger business perhaps is it your career is it prestige and i want to ask another question let's just go back to lot before i close out because lot despite the fact that he was just he needed deliverance too so they both needed deliverance [Music] we'll touch a lot then we'll get back to lord's wife and we'll finish if a lot was uncomfortable why didn't he leave the bible said he was vexed every day eating him up why didn't he just walk out why anybody just say i'm gone [Music] why did he just walk out think about that [Music] friends where are you standing this morning just stand our feet [Music] we're going to play steel away deacons allah as we get ready for the prayer line [Music] i want to challenge you this morning [Music] lot's wife she didn't want to be delivered [Music] because if she wanted to be delivered she'd have kept on walking [Music] if you come into the prayer line this morning don't come because you want a blessing you're coming because you want a change you want something to come out of you and somebody come inside of you the bible said uh a new heart i'll give you a new spirit and i'll put my spirit in there [Music] every head bowed every eye closed [Music] [Music] shall we by
