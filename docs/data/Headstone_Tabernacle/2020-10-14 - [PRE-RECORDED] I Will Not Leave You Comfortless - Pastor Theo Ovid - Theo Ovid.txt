heavenly father we worship you this morning we praise you we thank you for your love we thank you for this opportunity to hear words of life for lord you took a prophet and set up so high that he could see beyond the moon the stars see the future see a bride coming forth in perfection see a church stand in a glorious church we don't spot a wrinkle father we thank you for eager eyes to see us where are we supposed to be help us today father that we believe beyond the five senses that we could see what you promised for us lord and be partakers of it father grant it lord come and interpret your word among us come and confirm your word among us come and vindicate your word among us we wait upon you lord you promise our church but jesus walk in the shout of the king will be in the camp we pray a command of the preamble this morning take me out of the way and be glorified in jesus and we ask it amen amen god bless you and welcome are you standing let's go straight to the word of god we want to read uh three portions of scripture this morning god bless you and welcome greeting to those connected to us on the internet and we're so happy to be here to have this sunday fellowship around god's word so it's in john chapter 14 we want to read verse 14 to 21 also first john chapter 2 from verse 15 to 17 and hebrews 10 verse 1 to 10. praise the lord readings in john 14 14 to 21. if he shall ask anything in my name i will do it if you love me keep my commandments and i will pray the father that he will give shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seet him not neither annoyed him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you yet a little while the world sees me no more but you see me because i live he shall live also at that day he shall know that i am in my father ye and me and i knew he that had my commandments and keeped them heated that love at me and he that loved me shall be loved of my father and i will love him i will manifest myself to him first john 2 reading verse 15. 17. love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and the world pass it away and the lust thereof but he that do it the will of god abide it forever in our last scriptures from hebrews chapter 10 for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comments their own to perfect for them would they not have ceased to be offered because the worshiper once purged should have had no more conscious of sins but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year for it is not possible that the blood of birds and goats should take away sins wherefore when he commits into the world he says sacrifice and offering that what is not but a body has now prepared me in burned offerings and sacrifices for sin that was had no pleasure then i said i lo i come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will oh god praise the name of the lord hold on praise god above when he said sacrifice an offering and burnt offering and offering for sin thou would has not neither had pleasure thereon which are offered by the law then he said lo i come to do thy will oh god he taketh away the first that he may establish a second by the which will will will we are sanctified to the offering of the body of jesus christ once and for all may god bless his word you may be seated oh praise god thank you lord jesus oh blessed be the name of the lord it's so good to be here this morning and to feel the presence of the lord this morning have a title i will not leave you comfortless he says jesus own words i will not leave you comfortless and an inspiration i come to do thy will oh praise the name of the lord you have to have a desire for the will of god but imam was praying saying dear god we are grateful people this morning yet lord we are living in a dark world there isn't one of us here this morning father that what feels we want a closer walk with you we want that touch of you in our lives that can tender us and make us flexible so you can change us at any time if you're stiff and starchy he can't bend you and twist you because you're on your own hallelujah here's a big shot in your own self see but he asking that god could tend us that he could change us makes us flexible this is a beautiful thing watch watch so you can change us at any time mold us into sons and daughters of god you're not instant sons you are molded shaped conformed transformed something have to happen upon your life is that your border in the message and you believe that no it's not that you have to be shaped as many as receive him to them give him power to become the sons of god he said make yourself a christian oh glory to god don't just come to church make yourself a christian you make yourself by what you do by what you say by watch how you act by how you live you make yourself a christian oh give the lord a shout go back down let me know because it's the word this morning all we have is the word for you oh glory gonna chicken and chips the word we have for you this morning oh god because the word is god oh same as somebody we have truth for you this morning because truth is what set you free not fooling the wrong truth o glory to god hallelujah and jesus said you shall know the truth and the truth we're going to set you free how many want to be free this morning free from the limitations of your five senses to break out at your prison you're in prison you're in prison of five senses jesus was not in that prison and he came to bring sons out to prison he came to set the captive free oh glory to god so you are not limited to joy and happiness that's that's temporary stuff oh glory to god and that you're feeling good one day and i'm feeling so good forget that you are in christ you're in the word you are fine you're gonna come true some to the waters some through the flood sanctuary trials all through the blood oh glory that you have to believe that glory to god hallelujah if all you have to believe is based upon your eyes then we don't need faith because faith is the substance of what you're hoping for faith is the evidence of what you're not seeing oh glory to god you may be seated praise as we said and we keep saying till it's stick jesus sold five thousand and there was a little boy with five loaves and two fishes and that did not intimidate jesus jesus because he was out of that prison of five senses could see those five thousand people being fed because all things are possible to them to them to them do i hear a shout in the house [Applause] i don't know about you but i come here to break out [Applause] not to sit out but to break out i come to do what has never been done before it may be seasoned occupying a church bench is normal sitting is normal this coming same name and that's normal but when you want to break out you're looking to go beyond normal but i'm going to say when revolution strikes you behave unnormally get a bf different revelation brings stimulation revelation brings excitement revelation brings joy revelation brings faith because you know you're gonna be healed you know you're gonna be delivered you know god will solve the problem you know the red sea gonna open up you know that devil has to back up pack up and leave you know that devil will be cast out you know you're gonna get the victory you know it's just a matter of time faith gives you the victory up front glory to god hallelujah glory to god my god my god my god my god my god this place don't have enough noise we should shout down the football camp we should show down the cricket camp we could shout down the foot camp we could shout out whatever in the stadium whatever people have we could shoot them out because we have something to shout about no wonder john said all in heaven all under the earth heard i john praise god thou art ready to take the book and to lose the seven seals why i can't have a revival this morning at old-fashioned holy ghost demon jason he'll break him oh hallelujah [Applause] let me see that praise god oh glory to god that's what i said don't compare us to no other church because there isn't another church like this church we different we have to be different god didn't call no ordinary people jesus prophesy the people that know their god that's how you have to become the people that know your god your god is not dead your god is not sick your god is not tired your god is not wary your god performs miracles your god is a way maker your core is the god of the armies [Applause] had a challenge on montgomery and he said let the god answer my father and be god that walker that god he said okay ready god answer my father be god you say go and bring down fire and they dance and they cut and they chant you say what happened sleeping he said maybe only god found holiday he said calling him louder imagine them calling her louder maybe going on a journey maybe he ain't come back yet maybe late in the stepping when they finished all the dance and nothing happened he said my chance now my chance now get some water we want fire but we call him for water or give the lord a shout that's what we're talking about not using them five senses not using your eyes [Applause] oh you should be shouting this morning nobody should stop you this morning if somebody dead next to you don't look at them don't look at them oh glory to god hallelujah and somebody dead behind your dream don't even turn around just keep wearing the fire cut somebody on fire somebody under fire oh glory to god hallelujah praise god all you want to be in fire you want to be inspired this morning oh glory glory [Applause] fully trenches precisely sacrifice poor water god i don't want to feel like come with gasoline and come with kerosene and come with some kind of fire be underneath he said poor water let them everybody see us water here let the god the ransom by fire let that god be god that's the challenge that's coming back the god had to feel cancer the god of the cursed humor the quarter to make the walk and the blind to see that god is alive this morning he's the same yesterday today and forever the prophet said when i am gone healings are gone miracles has not gone come on [Applause] deliverance is not gone holy ghost fire is not gone maybe season [Applause] hello [Applause] [Music] yes [Applause] many of you are too casual about the things of god in the time of israel it got so casual that people started telling your neighbor this is where you go off alarm for me isn't going for the self when you go you identify with the lamb because the lamb was taken as a sin offering for you so you have to put your hand on the lamb or when the priest kill it and the life leave it you know is you were supposed to be killed but the lamb took your place so you feel identified it was a serious thing once a year the high priest had to go in and israel under attention biting their nails to want to know if god forgive them now remember it was no joke eating there was no text on scripture in that sense you know it was pillar fire by night when people look up they see a fire all day they know money put that up there so that was a shaken thing in the daytime you see a cloud hanging over the camp they know that is the god of israel looking down over them you understand what i'm saying it was no foolishness it was no nonsense by fire by night a pillow fire hanging over what would buyer go into when the pillow fire hanging over what rum shop you go into and pull the fire over what fetch you go into the until the fire hanging over think about it now in the daytime you're seeing god in the nighttime you see in god and that's how it's supposed to be in the daytime you're seeing god in the night time you see and god i will not leave you comfortless [Applause] jesus knew he was leaving he knew he was with them but he said listen this comforter which is the holy ghost even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive so what will receive it your worldly fashion and styles it can't connect with the holy ghost that's why god tells john the one that you see the dove come on and remain notice what he said not the dove come on doctors come on all kind of people but let the death come and remain that they'll have to stay there that's the one who is the messiah that death wasn't just coming upon you the devil is upon you this morning but is that death going to remain and your behavior and action and attitude gonna determine whether that dog remain or fly away or give the lord a shout in the house [Applause] i'm still in the prayer thank you all right so what about says he said no that's our purpose here father that's my only objective that i have is to try to live before you and to get your word and speak it back to man and woman not to be a different person but to try to honor him who give me life granted lord and may lord as the light travels from the blade to the pollen into the shock into the green while they are passing through this morning if there is some life that goes into the grain that's laying back in that stock bring it out to the lord and made follow the moving of the green for we ask it in jesus name so you want to know you are not a stalker not a shock you're not a flower but praise god you're part of the grain of god isn't that right praise god and barbara was speaking about david okay let's back up trying to do god and servants or being his will god is suffering we want to understand that the people that are wondering why we can't have a revival do you believe god is suffering the bible speaks this way let god be suffering grace speak to a little nitwit i have to say a little nobody let his spirit fall into the city and man can go to work amen and woman can't wash dishes the maid can't make the bed screaming and crying with the hands of the in the air that's a revival in the will of god [Applause] you hear all the revivals going the will of god mankind go to work women can wash the dishes made coming because they're there they're screaming and crying with their hands up in the air that is a revival in the will of god you want a revival that's what you want to be fighting for that is what you want to be present for we're not talking about going to church anybody could do that thousands of people are going to church this morning but they are not revived thousands of people going to church this morning but they're not inspired thousands of people going to church this morning but there is no burden there's no burden of god there's no burden for his word to be fulfilled during the world revival the people get off their ships with the tornados on and they come and see a policeman swinging his club wrong and around like that it's whistling they say my good man could you tell me where the military rival is you say yes sir you're standing in the middle of it because the welsh revival is it me oh glory to god i was that english man revival inside of him you were standing in the middle of it but that's what every one of you ought to be a pulse [Applause] you ain't come here just to get charged up you're coming to be a powerhouse when you leave a leader with power power to pray for the sick power the castle devils power to raise the dead power to overcome power to forgive power to have victory power to run them devils and cast them out paul when you're standing in the street the devil said get out look who is coming oh glory to god you go by the church and the match my that is sovereign that's what god does he alone has a right to sell a revival not get the mechanics together it is to pray for quarters and the dynamics oh my when the gospel the messages when you see the messenger nothing else matters the rest is just fill the material you have to see the vision when you see it no man could fool you no body could show you up it's like an open vision open up to you you know what you're looking for praise god jesus in his resurrection ministry appeared to his disciples in a private ministry to his elect [Applause] everybody wasn't seeing him oh glory to god my god i feel like shouting praise god hallelujah hallelujah give the lord a shout give the lord a shout that resurrection ministry wasn't for everybody [Applause] hallelujah you may be seasoned because jesus was going to see down the resurrection to them so watch before they had faith but when he raised from the dead was a different kind of faith it was resurrection fate now they know this man that we believe in he's not dead he's really alive now he's not feeling the multitude and he's in the dead he's not doing that he's come to tell these guys who they are he come to listen he come to teach them and positionally place them into what they're supposed to receive how they're supposed to receive it and they knew exactly what they were supposed to receive so when they finish with them open the understanding and open the scriptures they were properly empowered by vision marry all of them all the brethren they had revelation so they returned to jerusalem with great joy they need no pastor to give them joy they need no special to give them joy they need no music to give them joy the revelation of what they're about to receive of their dynamics that give them the joy of the lord which was their strength human being all glory of course they were frightened of course they are afraid of the jew romans of course the doors were shut as a human being but they were waiting on a promise one day passed two day pass they're still waiting they couldn't move because they had revelation when you have revolution you can't move not even the devil could move here brahman said job couldn't hope here from god but the devil could move him and when you cannot hear from god don't let that devil move you do i shout in the house listen listen let me see i have no doubts in my mind the rain is going to fall fire going to fall power going to fall the prophecy spoke it nobody could stop it if i dead in the morning it will still fall i'm not controlling that he said i will restore all the years that the conquer woman the caterpillar and the locusts you may be seasoned this restoration is different because the cancer won't caterpillar eat don't go through go to eat eat eat eat eat you finish they say yes you have no more to eat you said good you can't eat you eat it though not empty break already then it's the irony store this one they can't eat they could only watch until the cheese grow why don't we growing we're going in fate we're going in revelation bitcoin and strength we're going an anointing we're going in authority we're going in power yes we're going in revelation every service we claim is something more every service we slap in some more demons and some more devils out from our land every service we gain and more grown every step every place you put your foot that is yours we put an offer on signs and wonders and miracles cast no devils we put in our foot in the holy spirit to run them demons out your house [Applause] your week was rough because the devil didn't want you to get to the spot you're struggling to come to church this morning but you made it you know you see what the devil was fighting you all along this way devil is fighting you from because the devil do not want you to know who you are he wants you to sit like some sinner saved by the grace of god and yesterday on your sin and your sin and your sinner yeah yeah that's what the devil wants you to say that's not the picture that's not the whole picture you're gonna be seated praise god hallelujah praise god we only sinner because we're in time but when that time portal close up we go back to eternity and eternity come down in a body call time so jesus god's eternity come now in a body called time to give you eternity so you

are stronger than you think you are but you don't know that but you will know that because there's a prophecy at that time you want to know i am in the father you and me and i knew he said i will not leave you comfortless glory to god that the wild of the world see at me worship me no more but you are going to be seen you're going to see me because i'll be one with you but i'm going to be in you my god let me see that praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah you must you must want to do better [Applause] one time one time jesus busts his own disciples he said his father she's like lie down he said describes them far as they love them you say you'll do better than that you have to love your enemies you got everybody love their own that's my brethren they're my family everybody love their own but that is not yours calling god they give you a selfish calling your circle your family and you're done where is that what is that jesus said who is my mother who is my father them that do the will of the father they are my mother brother father your real family is in here blood take out on water that's nonsense [Applause] i could press inside of there you know i could push some love inside of there you know your mother and father only give you your face and your complexion or whatever it is but that soul inside of there didn't i give you that your mother and father did not give you that they can't claim that okay the lord i shout that's why jesus said i do that which pleases my father [Applause] my god brother banham never ceased my fee so excited this morning he said in the church of the living god leads the power to cast out devils to heal the sick to take sin and ball it up and throw it away in the church of the living god tonight that's a quote in the church of the living god tonight [Applause] maybe he said god have mercy if we backslide to the point where we hang the wood and we're doing so tap tap tap then i can move into it tap tap tap tap lamp and the elders do so 24 elders balance the crown a little better i want to see it from a better position the elders lean back and get a better seat yeah not in the bible and let's flick off cronkite nowhere we talk about no crowd [Applause] now it's time to worship now it's time to honor him who is worthy for thou has redeemed us by thy blood out of every kindred out of every nation oh hallelujah maybe he sees it oh glory to god i remember one time preaching in india he was preaching in a tent and fire fall i see an elder woman she said that dances little my god is the same holy ghost you have one kind of behavior with the same holy ghost everywhere eternal indian holy ghost and and european holy ghost and american holy ghost what kind of ghost is that that is jesus it have one spirit that we are baptized into one body and when god put you in that body no pastor deacon elder no church could pull you out of that body when god put you inside that body no man could put you god have to put you by his spirit and baptize you into that body it's the body of jesus christ out inside of there putin weapons can't destroy you inside there no man can destroy you inside of there you are safe you're not safe in trinidad you're not safe in america where you're going the mississippi will find you the only one place you are safe that's in christ jesus oh glory to god hallelujah praise god oh praise god praise god praise god oh glory to god [Applause] my god my god my god glory to god don't worry god go bring on bushmen for your enemies don't you worry god go set them up like you set up pharaoh then you bring your armies in the red sea let them come let them come god will set them up and cut them off my angel will go before you praise god the angel of the lord and camp around those that fear him all glory to god hallelujah praise god praise god you may be seated my god you know what going back to the faith of fathers means going back to angels going back to apostolic condition going back to angels coming to open the door for you in prison oh oh you may be seated praise god not feeling the preacher this morning hallelujah praise god feeling the preacher this morning oh hallelujah oh god they put paul in prison peter in prison praise god paul in prison you may be seated and at midnight paul began to praise god all glory to god with the time to praise god when the torture keep quiet when the prison gate and the gatekeeper and the donkey taught you go just sit there and mope oh god i'm in prison are in prison you decide to take through something it's hard to praise your god look with a shame jumping praise god praise god he is free this morning you better be free this morning you will jump through and when paul began to sing oh glory to god something began to happen when paul began to praise god angels descend ha maybe cj and you know what these men hundreds of them look how nice you're looking this morning they didn't have polish shoes they were you a polisher but the same feat that they have is what you're gonna have with your polish shoes and ties oh glory to god hallelujah [Applause] we in the climax of satan eden and we put in smoke on his face what kind of people what we to be right now he's jamming jamming jamming for the devil because he could watch us but he can't touch us because if he could have touched us he had the structures a long time ago but we break a certain barrier now you're about to hit the song barrier oh glory to god you may be seated you see when god was moving in power science was moving in power so when god made one move science made the mutaka that was one power isn't that right from horse and buggy to motoka so science was increasing in power then from motoka they went to aeroplane but then from airplane they went to astronaut so as science was increasing god was increasing from luther to wesley to pentecost and then brilliant brandon come and take us plum out in space oh glory to god no the aeroplane you can still see it with your eyes but when you're blasting the space all you can see is smoke and tell yourself it's up there and that is what's going to happen to us this morning just smoke are we up there [Applause] oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god my god we don't know what you're gonna see this morning hallelujah praise him the lord so when noah's group saw it nothing else matter when john group saw it nothing else matter when jesus group saw it nothing mattered watch and they pull away from everything why the foreign knowledge he predestines things to happen he chooses his person by his foreknowledge he said in romans that the election of god might stand unsure that eastern jacob both born of holy parents twins and his election might stand true and sure he's a hit he saw and i love jacob before either the boy was born so this kink in eternity called time right now that give god the opportunity to display some of his attributes he could not have displayed in this thing called time time of a beginning therefore time has an ending this thing called time [Applause] it's a deception i'll call it the time deception and i think you have time and you don't have it when time runs out so jesus god god himself couldn't stay in eternity he had to come down in a body called time that body called jesus sit down on the earth because it had a kingsman to redeem us one like us so he could because an angel injury sin those are their sin the others get kicked out them is trouble guys and them trouble guys falling upon the earth the battle of angel becoming a battle of men so we have issues here on the earth now because of them falling into the spirit but not all fell and those that did not fall represented us because we were nothing back there yet we were just in a gene taught inside of there and that gene thought is what inside of you as a seed so god put that in your soul so i don't care where you were here to find you you could be hindu muslim baptist methodist your witness it doesn't matter wants that seed inside of there god had to find you because all that the father had passed and has given me will come so god had to give you to him before when before he had a child before you had trouble before the foundation of the world you were chosen in him you're not hearing me this morning when were you chosen before when were you chosen before your chosen way in him to be in him therefore he was chosen before you have to go back into him oh glory to god you are going to go back into him [Applause] glory so because of the sin because of the fall we felt trapped the five senses lost the sixth sense sense of god hallelujah cell phone bright and shiny but not activated commit no calls play games on it calculate things on it connect with wi-fi on it but you can't make no call because it's not activated oh hallelujah when it's activated you could receive and you can make calls so god want to make you an activated son where you could receive and make calls you could call for help i look under the hill someone come in my help my hair come from the lord activated sons these are sons of waters look over and look after you know one time they're locking something down and they say we catch them tonight they close the gates who tell them do that samson never move gates before who tell them do that you can't close a gate on sons of god when the words say thy seed shall possess the gates of the enemy you don't do that you're looking for trouble you're looking for us to break a record you're looking for us to go for beyond goal never mind never move get before samson move gate and post and put it on a hill you know alone it takes to get it back down something will show who's the boss when the spirit come upon me i can do all things through christ who straighten up me let that spirit come upon you you can call a goliath without a sword and say i'll cut your head off when the spirit comes all we have to press for the spirit press to be in the spirit press to be under the spirit [Music] let the weed say let the weed sit oh yeah man could you give the lord a shout out what you doing there you define your feelings your emotions your senses your your conscious reality you are defining it and saying i am strong and don't come the angels to give you the strength because you're confessing something supernatural you're confessing what god has said you're not lying the scripture says let the weak say you have to speak it [Applause] oh [Applause] moses if moses was going by senses if moses is roll them wine and grapes and beautiful women around him and find them with them fellas because of the condition they had at that time if he wanted to continue with that breeze he could have stayed just as he are just as he was to be a prince of egypt but when moses recognized he is one of them one of them mud doubles [Applause] is one of them i am a princess of egypt then he chose to identify with them shouting screaming poorly dressed mothers then i forget a revelation come here is to be deliverer so now we recognize all this training and all this elegant walking and everything else was to take him to a different level altogether hallelujah he tried everything as we were saying child thing when he joined his son and killed

aaron i said pharaoh let my people go say oh gosh era show them show them turn this back stick to the snake furiously guy will you bring it for me see we didn't do that too that's a something i don't

stick you could see what is this i'm going back for consultation i'm going back to to reconnect with the calling that i get moses just stand still and see a snake eat up the other two moses in the spirit buddhists are coming back tomorrow this is the introduction this we don't start battling finish here when moses pepper himself with frogs lice flea flogs all kind of stuff his favorite said take your flux take your people take them and go [Applause] now understand what that means fear was the baddest that he had you know he was the best line everybody look up the fear you know so when god broke the top man you know everybody had to fall under so pharaoh had his pride to deal with and god wanted to break it but god had more to break god wants to destroy the armies the whole armies so quarter to lay them out so then people are singing the songs of moses and they're walking out they're so happy to go yeah everybody going on too because out yes when they camp at the red sea singing and themselves special after special beating harmonizing songs and voices and whatnot all of a sudden they see some dust coming they say like a storm nobody's sitting in this chariot oh god

the son of god hallelujah that is why when joshua hit the jordan he could sit jordan and put his foot and then phillips foot hit the jordan jordan open up that's why elijah could hit the jordan with his mantle and said open up and children have to open up this elijah he never talked to the red jordan river there's a sun coming through nothing going to stop in the way of the sons of god in this last day when god begin to anoint this church when god begins to anoint you nothing understand in your way no man will be able to stand before thee no sickness no disease no condition all missing limbs will be restored missing limbs [Applause] missing limbs missing limbs will be restored somebody lose their foot and they're missing them going to come back go go grow back a foot get back your kidney get back your pancreas get back your womb whatever it is god can give it back give it back give it back give it back do you believe that this is a god that anoints yourself to say son stand still this is that god [Applause] steven give a trip but let us even give a tremendous rotation and promising on tuesday night we heard a scripture of jesus going and a weird woman lost her only son her son was dead and jesus said her compassion compassion and he went and touched the power and present the son back to the woman amen amen just discover something about iq and eq iq is what intelligent question to the college eq is emotional quotient people are blending iq they have high their brains high they could calculate a set of stuff and whatnot but sometimes have people with high iq on low eq low and emotional response low in emotional compassion they are self-centered and selfish because having compassion means that you could actually step into somebody's shoes when brown was in india and they was worshipping his son and so on and in a man came up to him and he's blind and he had no shoes on the first thing but ram did was to measure his shoes to see if he could give the man his shoes so he had a high eq the feel for people you said that's why you have to enter in so i recognize people with law thank god they give them no healing for that oh my god you have no compassion for healing jesus amen next [Applause] have to have that compassion there's a woman we talked this story before she was sitting next to a woman and she had a child that was sick and the woman next to her just felt like to pray for the baby she said can i pray for your child you know and she prayed for the child she had a prayer card she came up to the platform to brother branham and byram says uh a woman next to you pray for your child the child is healed he said god so that one had more compassion than me god saw you had more compassion and put it upon that woman to pray you see what it is being able to put yourself in the person's place on the matter [Applause] jesus saw this with a woman she already lost her husband no she lost her only son he had compassion no talk did you drink last night woman all this kind of thing people trying to know and with purpose i i never see just interview people you all been healing them you know all you said my faith had made the look look the lepers god know what them fellows doing all the time good thing good thing there come and silly hands you don't touch lepers he says he said go and cheer yourself to the priest keep on walking brothers keep on walking while they were going they recognized they were healed simple they never reached the priest one came back out and now he said where'd he rest he said your feet made you that's why there are people with seeds in them amen and they are the one god gonna baptize but the holy ghost because they have something in them you see the rest then what they went and drink to celebrate that they get healed but this one come back to worship this one come back to give god praise this one had something inside of them and i'm telling you if you have something inside of you you're going to get the right response [Applause] the woman at the well she had something in her that she didn't even know her neighbors didn't even know she was doing a prostitution business and living all kind of life why because brahm said listen listen the prophet by vision i believe he said the woman had nobody else to help the feeder family so she was living a certain way to minor children so he went in the spirit realm he could see that but god saw something beyond that he saw a scene in that woman that needed to be unfolded that one woman was a genuine daughter of god we asked what the neighbors and the people say if you go by what the people say you wouldn't see you'll feel this way in that way but when jesus saw the woman hallelujah and he revealed himself that i that speak unto you am he she was so free she ran she didn't walk she ran come see her man you told me all that i did that seed come to life that something sparked inside of her and i trusted it something on a spark inside of you that you know that somebody and your father dragged inside of here and your mother pulled you and you don't want to be in service today but you're struggling because you have no choice you have a choice to serve god i don't serve god hallelujah i had a choice at age 17 i give my heart to the lord i made a choice and never looked back oh glory to god you are a choice today to break out that's the word i want to present to you break out glory to god you have a choice to want to do the will of god a choice thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is heaven that's part of your father prayer will is not talk will is to be done god's will is his purpose for your life you may be seated and the god's will is customized it's not for every is is not the same will for you with somebody else got a bit customized for you because god knows your form and your shape and god know your condition so you know what you have to do oh glory to god amen praise god my lord my lord my lord father help me jesus oh my so the church had the keys but not really amen god holy keys but iran says that's why after judas fell that they get somebody to replace judas and the church by the turning their key they went and choose a man called matthias and that was the elected one i guess the body cast votes and say bara matas fine brother but god choose a little hook no sarcastic high temper jew named paul to be number 12. oh praise the name of the lord isn't that right and that man paul that was saul turned to paul he wasn't easy you know that tough guy persecuting christians right so from the five senses you saying not that man he can't get convicted he can't get changed he finished shock that people like to say shock it i just love i give them a shock experience like explosive who is shocking receipt but paul was a seed oh hallelujah disguise in whatever form he was in puts it in the church so you cannot know what god disguises he does so you have to treat people with respect and treat people with dignity and treat people with kindness you don't know what seed is behind me [Applause] two people like all of them are seeds of god because you don't know but saul became poor and a personal prophet isn't that right so he's talking about david and david now got excited to bring back the ark and he consult his men and consult the people and everything else but nathan was the prophet of that age and the revelation didn't come to david the revelation come to david but david never consulted natan isn't that right so then he wasn't ordained to do that david being inspired watch and the spirit can come and anoint the person and still it's out of the will of god so it's prove we have to we have to go through god's ways not our way it is god's way of doing it here is why watch now how close it gets that razor edge now between right and wrong remember it will fall on one or the other side till it come down to a honed razor between the difference between right and wrong it's got to be every word oh hallelujah praise god we are not living in a pentecostal age now we're living in a wood age where everything had to be examined by the word so when you hear me say we're checking out man and angel be serious about that men could claim whatever they want to claim but when we say bring it and come let me check it out they backing out see because this has to be the word so listen sin is rejecting the revealed will of god that's what sin is rejecting the revealed will of god as we say we are born in sin we are sinners so when we sin that was in us do sin or sin that is not the issue with god because we were born in sin shape and negative we're born contaminated that is what we will do that's normal the thing with god is failing to come out of your sin or failing to come out of that unbelief when a way is made for you that's the difference your behavior is understandable because of your how you were born but when the word comes to say listen this away forever you know it's clear you need to repent you need to get things in order and god going to truly bless you he will dispatch angel to escort you he would help you he would minister to you and you turn that down that is sin the true sense so sin is rejecting the reveal will of god sin in its initial form is to reject the revealed word of god god's will the will of god when god has revealed something on his will to reject that is to blaspheme or to reject god and a church would fail at and never will a church fail never will a program feel as long as those who are in charge stay in the center of god's will god's will is perfect and everything will fall right into its place if you stay in god's will but get out of there will it will throw the whole program off remember akan's wedge you have to move out of one place and praise the name of the lord let's continue from adoption the mystery of israel now remember now it is not just a little thing it's a mystery god's will is a mystery and each man here we go has to seek out the will of god for his or herself so when you seek that out then you get a sense of purpose then you don't want to commit suicide you don't want to give up you don't want to let go god i feel frustrated and i'm fed up i can't take it no more you will come out to that because you'll connect to romans 8 20 all things work together for good you want to go to heaven to escape your trials down here oh god bring heaven quick heaven quick that'd be my mid-1977 you know in a minister's conference or brothers and things like that i brought her up and say you know he was taught me all long story in the millennium and i watching this little brothers and i was astonished at that time my mother be about maybe 18 19 years old and i asked myself what is he talking about because the books i read so far has so much promises that has not yet been fulfilled millennium i don't want a million yet i want these things to fulfill i remember in school teachers tears tears teachers used to tell me he said over he said um you you you're christians on them do you want to just go to heaven go to them i said no i don't want to go to heaven i want to stay here and be a testimony the field we want to escape escape this and escape that no we want to be here to live we want here to be a witness a genuine witness of god oh hallelujah so each man have to seek out the will of god for this life no you have to be persistent to achieve something and all man through the ages has been persistent and noah was persistent after he had found the will of god so when you find the will of god then you could jam things then you could say devil you can't stop you from going there because this is god's will there's a door you go bang on it there's a mountain you will climb it there's a sea you want to swim it walk through it but nothing in your stop because this is god's will for your life it's god's will that you'll be in good health [Applause] sickness is not the will of god for your life don't claim it reject it shake it off glory to god don't claim diabetes hypertension whatever your family have don't claim none of that praise god claim deliverance claim freedom go glory to god claim revival praise god hallelujah it's god's will for you to be revived it's god's will for you to be inspired it's god's will for you to leave different than you came oh give the lord a shout and that it's god's will for you to lose your temper this lord is god's will [Applause] the image just had to go down just like this you see that antenna back as you you can vex your answer back but goku bless you with that and send back yes your husband off god knows he know you off and you know but god is willing for you to be in your place by being respectful so when you break that note you call the whole thing no but god has to display the husband now because he has to make sure things in order that his prayer not be hindered anyone not going down there this morning i'm not i'm not going there this morning so so god what god wants what he what what so god sent the holy ghost to work among his people to bring his church together to bring our church to a place far beyond the lutheran far beyond the methodists far beyond the pentecostal into a place of adoption and rapturing grace oh my oh my oh my you see the pentecostals they will preach too blessed to be stressed or whatever they say all they catch faces and whatnot and different things too blessed to be stressed and the money gospel and blessings of god and god multiplying on what they're doing but the thing about the character is not formed by multiplication characters not formed by blessings and whatnot characters happen to be formed by the trial of your fate by suffering this is what character is all about so if we talk about character we're talking about training and so forth this is the real gospel now because what god wants is sons manifested and he want to trust his word in his sons but he pentecostal he was trusting men and men fail and they're still failing today they still fall in big churches big money and they still falling by the wayside but god wanted character and when he went to adopt sons he couldn't adopt no other person he adopted william branham because william branham had the character of jesus christ and he connected to faith virtue knowledge and he said these brothers peter had those things that is why they were at the world because they had the virtues of god in them so your devotee is going to be in you so you burn a prophet now to gather all this scattered word because the word was lost to the ages so before god could reproduce himself as a seed you have to gather all all the loose ends and bring it together that's what the seven sea was all about to reveal the whole mystery of god to produce a perfect seed oh glory to god and that seed is seven thunders boom a seed inside your soul [Applause] glory devil the one and thunders inside of you because that's the tongue that checks to the evil in every age it never gets shocked up luther was a thunder west he wasn't all there was shaking the devil's kingdom every one of them all glory to god hallelujah praise god god that god's god in the age he had the land anointing praise god under paul martin columbus isn't that right he had the man anointed on the luther wesley isn't that right he had the ox anointing on the columba rada and the eagle anointing under brother branham he was always god in the church well glory to god four gods god in the church oh glory to god i saw a white horse i saw a red horse i saw a black horse but the devil couldn't see the church elected hallelujah surviving the onslaught of the enemy and in this age with all the filth sex spirit money demon you name it god put the blast the best for the last god put you and i prophesy that you're gonna overcome hell itself you will overcome the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh and the pride of life you will overcome [Applause] love not the world or anything in the world if they love the world and the king of the world love the father is not in you and the world is lust of the eyes lust of the flesh and the pride of life and you're going to overcome all of that all the big shot life you're going to overcome that all you have to have this you're going to overcome that too oh man must have this and you're jealous about this you can overcome that too you will have nothing oh glory to god you'll have christ jesus living inside of you you may be seated god wants to break up your human spirit oh glory have to break up in any heart oh glory to god i feel the anointing here with a kangaroo field of spirit the other day your human spirit have to break up anyhow gonna be seasoned remember when somebody died their spirit breaks up the human spirit and i put in the human spirit that way i have the gcc that way i see you on your big shot and you have a big house and a big car you have money all that is right in the human spirit so i'm talking about a woman who was in church and everything else dying and afterwards when our human spirit begin to break up you say i'm lost i'm lost what happened there a human spirit breaks up and her soul is coming forward now and the soul is subconscious the soul is where you are the soul is who you really are you are what you are in your soul that's that's the main thing human spirit intellect and reputation what people think you are that's not what you are you are what you really are not what people think you are oh same as somebody so therefore that human spirit if god could slam that word inside of you and jam that spirit and break out that you'll be so different you'll be breaking out the humanistic realm oh glory to god hallelujah i wouldn't bother with somebody husband somebody wife yeah come here with a boyfriend girlfriend you come here to get the holy ghost you're coming for a revival you're coming for a breakthrough you come here for overcoming power you come here hallelujah like this one a horse like this one it doesn't matter what anybody have is what god ordained for you help me jesus help me jesus oh glory to god hallelujah praise god praise god you may be seated what people have doesn't doesn't bother me i just want the will of god the book says i come to do thy will oh god as is written of me in the form of the book and that must be your testimony that you want to do the will of god oh if your will of god is you to be a doormat you say lord make me an excellent donor when people wipe on me may all the mud come off praise god hallelujah praise god you may be seated hallelujah if you have to be a vagrant for the kingdom be the best fragrance if i'm the worst looking dustbin oh hallelujah praise god you want to be the best of whatever you want to do oh but i want to be a son i want to be a born son phil son anointed son demon chase and son kingdom son oh glory to god what about you oh glory to god hallelujah hey many many men all gloss of god want to bring the church fabian all the other churches oh my god glory to god hallelujah praise god so when science launched the

ball come down ten nine eight seven six five four three two one zero lift off then they blast off and the men sitting there they're controlled by something wrong isn't that right and then we get into the body of christ and we are controlled by our power oh glory to god when the spirit of the lord came upon samson samson beat a thousand philistines with a jawbone because the spirit was upon him

the church it's not praying missile is still in the silo it shows they're flying anywhere so the astronauts have to break the song barrier isn't that right praise god praise god this song barrier where all things are possible blessed be the name of the lord and any man here we go any man that ever lives for god will have to go beyond the five senses he will have to go on have to go beyond education and achieving one man be able to achieve and believe god and break everything and laid aside and sweep unto the heaven oh blessed be the name of the lord i skip down praise god man counters 10 9 8 backwards but god have one two three four fixes seven zero seven church ages god count is different and then is come down to the great orbiting time to zero hour the kung dong seventh goes perfect mount number and now he's given us a correct condom his kung dong is not 10 but seven and we have just come through seven church ages and we find it in revelation uh the seventh one is the kung lung there's visible the first one is ephesus second number is murder then pogamos taitara fifth is sardis sixth philadelphia seventh laodicea the last church age and then is zero time for the church to leave oh praise be to jesus thank you lord now they were god's small god and men if you become born in the family or your family you are son and part of your father and when sin came in we found out that man caused the chasm and the blood of bulls and goats covered but did not remit until the reach bleached on the until the real bleach came that could take the stain of sin and break it completely to pieces and when it got back to satan he wasted time of eternal annihilation i believe here we go that sin will be broke up and when it's confessed upon the basis of the blood of jesus it's like dropping a blood of black ink in a bunch of clorox bleach it just breaks it into the chemicals and sends it plum back the way it comes from and that's the way the blood of jesus does that sets a man across the chasm again as a son of god oh glory to god you get what you're saying here when your sin is broken up it sets you back as a son of god that's why brahma said you are the sinless virtuous bride of jesus christ because the blood of jesus breaks up that thing called sin and freeze you from the prison of the fall from the prison of said freezing from that and bring you back into glorious sonship that you have access to the father oh give the lord a shout all glory when adam fell angels was god in the access angel was god in the tree of life but now the prophet said angels are driving the suns back to have access oh glory to god let me finish this off here watch then a man sets a call to chasm again the son of god then he becomes what the creative power of god is in him and at least whenever god can command it to be done it will be done and we get back and when moses here we go under the blood of bulls when he met that light that pillar fire in the burning bush he stood there on a commission god had given him and he was a prophet and when the word of the lord came to him he spoke and even things were created by the word now if it will do that under the blood of bulls what about the blood of jesus not only covered but we knitted it all together you stand in the presence of god as a redeemed son all glory to god we see the churches far beyond the standard of living you can live higher than that you can live better than that you can live better than that you can do better than that [Applause] so don't think i'm trying to escape and go home i have stuff here we could spend two more years i always have stuff i'm loaded i'm always look at this all right so we try to make our weaknesses excuses we want to tell how big we are how great we are so that's why some people can laugh at their own self there is too embarrassed i like when people can laugh at themselves if you call after yourself you have a problem no i'm sorry i don't mean to offend anybody as laugh at me system laughing we are human oh my the grace of god we are what we are and we are grateful to god amen so watch we want to tell how big we are how great we are i think that's one of the things that i god gave me this text for was to get that out of our mind these little things that we do and that is what we come to church for it's the final way of fault is and the things that we might better ourselves by if we come to church for any other purpose i'm afraid we won't get too much i'm afraid you won't get too much coming to church we come to find our weaknesses find our bad places hold see how little we are and put our trust in somebody that's strong there's so many of us like to testify or like to think that we are insufficient and therefore we make this an excuse i have no education i have no ability i'm not able to do this if you key that up to do that way you keep going like that then you won't among anything but the very thing that we make excuses by our weaknesses god uses that very thing to tackle the job with he waits for us to get to that condition so he can use us so god have a way of sending us through stuff to strip us and in stripping us i call it a kink or a break in your human spirit to give a way for god to break inside of you because in your human spirit you are strong god made you that way you could achieve you could do so much stuff without god so forgot to come in something i have to kind of get messed up tripped up trapped up whatever it is and in that messed up thing where you get broken i am broken in that way god could actually come in and do something for you then you know oh my it's god this is not me no more praise god it's the lord oh hallelujah we find the excuses i can't do this i'm insufficient i can't do that that's the reason he chooses us because we are in that condition i know that song strange but we find out as we read in that weaknesses and rejections we find out that those people who are the weakest and rejected by the outside world is god heroes that's conquered that's why brother bryan says samson was this big muslim man that pumping up in the gym he was a little frigging fella spriggly guy so that is what make it more supernatural how come a small guy with all the big muscle imprisonment fellas when they pump up the other weather jersey so show the muscles out they do how they pump up and i'm not showing us out and the spirit is strong [Music] so we're not talking about you now that's why it's not your you're weak and that that channel is you need the spirit i want to speak upon you hannah weak talk oh glory to god the cast daniel them lions then lion hungry lions is that lance just get fed and they ignoring a human lunch he's hungry lying and hungry lying they can't handle fire so fire was around daniel he said what was inside him came out so fire was he was fire protected lion is afraid of fire i think how hungry it is they're smarter than that keep your hunger out there brother oh glory this is fire here you can't bite not when fire is here oh glory to god these guys defy the five senses and if you have to get anywhere with god you have to defy your feelings your senses your emotions oh glory to god hallelujah glory to god amen praise god so there was a mentalist brother three of them come to this church they said to me no longer but abraham we just received the holy ghost now do we see gifts in the ministry i said don't do it let it alone he's telling me i read a certain brother told us that we after we see the holy ghost we shall see gifts he said and i said become a stuffed shirt if you notice is always those who trying to get away from it is who god uses as long as a man wants to do something and thinks he got enough ability he can do the job over god can't use that man don't seek nothing god's gutting me for you he'll give it to you oh praise the name of the lord hallelujah now we take the weakest and rejected party every hero of god in the front line have been that of a person a person rejected a prisoner thought he was insufficient a person who had no ability then that's the person just in good shape for god to start using them then they feel like they can't they have nothing to do all right so i'll just go so watch when we are insufficient ourselves then we subject to yield to god's spirit as long as we think we can do it then we can't do it but when we get to a place where we know we can't do it then we yield ourselves to god and he does it so that if it's us trying we will feel but if we yield ourselves to god then god cannot fail oh glory to god hallelujah this is the power i want to get to when i close the important thing one of the important things we must master and especially you young preachers remembers alike there's one thing we have got to master if we expect to fulfill god's design our life is to master the thought of human ability if we ever get to a spot we think we can do it with our own intelligence our own abilities we've got to master it in such a way that we can get rid of the thing laid aside so god can use us and make a complete surrender we cannot use one ability we cannot you make we got to make a complete surrender to come to god you've got to surrender to him body soul and spirit everything you are could we stand oh praise the name of the lord thank you jesus oh hallelujah oh jesus oh hallelujah oh thank you lord jesus heavenly father we thank you for your presence tonight and i pray that the holy spirit will take the words that was preached and grieve it in the hearts of the people may they leave yet different middle east be changed father god and may you speak to them lord and use them for your union of glory in jesus name we ask it amen oh i am thirsty
