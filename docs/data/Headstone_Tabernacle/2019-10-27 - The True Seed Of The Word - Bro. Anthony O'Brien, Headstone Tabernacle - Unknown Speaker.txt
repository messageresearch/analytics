God is here this morning and it's already in the building so what we have to do is to just yield ourselves so the spirit that is already here and then see what he would do for us this morning because only he can do what he promised he do when he he can do what he said what happened Amen so we just want to just heal ourselves now and you get ready to switch over god bless you and let's just turn to our Bibles like to invite your attention to our reading of the word amen and I have two readings here the first one we want to look at is a First Samuel 16 and then you can find for marking the New Testament Saint Matthew 24 a man so let's start now with First Samuel chapter 16 and man a man so for Samuel 16 well we just read it from boots 1 ok so then the Lord said unto Samuel how long will they mourn for soul seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel filled einhorn with oil and go I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlem the Bethlehem ight for I have provided me a king among his sons and Samuel said how can I go if Saul hear it he will kill me and the Lord said take an heifer with thee and say I am come to sacrifice to the law Amen so God gave him a kind of an alibi here amen so he said I called Jesse to the sacrifice and I will show thee what thou would do watch out thou shalt do and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I am I named unto thee right so in this situation also samuel is completely trusting in the lord to know who this person is because he doesn't have a name to go away he just is going by the witness of the law a man I could imagine he's like somebody waiting at the airport he doesn't have a face he just knows he's got to pick somebody up and he just waitin there for the Lord to tell him who it is Amen so so so this is the scene now is set you know so and Samuel did that which is Lord speak and booze for and came to Bethlehem and the elders of the town tremble that is coming hmm and he said what comment stop peaceful peaceably and he said peaceably I am come to sacrifice unto the Lord sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice and he sanctified Jesse and his sons and colon to the sacrifice and it came to pass when he could come that he looked on Alya and said surely the Lord is anointed as before him but the Lord said unto Samuel look not on his countenance or on the height of his stature because I have refused him for the Lord see it watch not as man seeing for man looketh on the outward appearance but the Lord looketh on the heart he men any man I want to stop right there priest good and bad chap 24 will read that no I 224 and was 21 please God 1924 and was 21 it says for then he got it man not to 24 21 says for then shall be a Great Tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time no nor ever shall be that's what's coming and except those days should be shortened there should no flesh be see but for the elects eat whose these shall be shortened and if any man shall say unto you lo here is Christ or there believe it not for they shall arise false Christ's and false prophets and shall sow great signs and wonders and so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect behold I have told you before wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth or behold he's in the behold isn't a secret chambers believe it not he said was lightning comment out of the east and china even unto the West so also shall the coming of the Son of Man be for wheresoever the carcase is there will the eagle's be gathered together amen amen so we got it together this morning two feasts on the carcass of his wood this morning amen glory so let's pray now one more time Oh Heavenly Father you all be ready with this morning and no we want to know just surrender for a few moments Lord and Lord pray that your anointed will come down speak to our hearts Lord touch us Lord and use us lord father take us all to the wheel or take me out of the way Father and touch your people Lord we are nothing Lord I'm nothing but just a tool in your hand Lord now and lord do we not any Greek man Lord or trying to be something Lord we're just whatever you want us to be in this Hollow Lorne and we're waitin to be positionally place as it was so father Lord mia just anoint our hearts towards your word Lord we we here to share and courage Lord get in the spirit of the coming of the Lord Lord as we see the Day approaching Lord we know that a prophet said Lord that they'd be Lally in gazing Lord father getting in a spirit of other things Lord but Lord we want to hide in a cleft or rock this morning Lord and getting the right spirit or right channel and the right atmosphere Lord father where you could come and and move among us Lord and change us and make us fit servants and make us ready for the rapture Lord father Lord to go away with the bridegroom for Lord there's a promise for the foolish virgin for weeping a weak wheel in a national teeth but Lord that's not the promise for the bride for she be ready and clothed to go out to meet him grandeur Almighty God now get us ready this morning we can stop by a word Lord and give us revelation to see you pray and ask it now a hobby we in Jesus name Amen amen now obviously this moon email pardon me priests going hang just take a drink of water there well praise the Lord we happy to be here this morning and to feast on the hidden manna eman priests God is an exciting time it's also a dreadful time for the world we see the evening shadows falling upon the world and systems so on the news recently that you know they're losing the trees I think the Amazon burnt down and now there are more and more species of animals dying out plant life dying out and you know there's certain species of India in the sea that's dying out also it's gonna become extinct so we know the world is getting ready for a funeral service and that is coming and Jesus said when you see these signs happening it's very very close he said it's even at the doors said so don't don't fall asleep this morning a man we we come to get woke up a man after what after what God is doing in these last things and we world is given a sign everyone seen a sign of the Messiah coming we did see the sign of his coming in his word Amen hallelujah is would come to us a word in due season how good it is this morning so that's what we come to here we're in due season you can wake us up for such a time as this now we just want to thank the Lord this morning to be here and it says moosian greece this morning we could come into this place and worshiping and praise God like we do as many others that wish they could be in your seat this morning for some it's too late praise God for some it's not their time yet but God has anointed you this morning with a special measure of grease that you could shout that you could lift your hands if you could see man oh it's a grace of God this morning where would we be without the grace of God will be nothing this morning we'd be nobody so we thank God for His mercy and we just want to just land ourselves over to the Holy Spirit this morning I have a title this morning and it is the true seed of the word and I also have an inspiration here and says the Lord looketh upon the heart a man the Lord look at upon the heart then be taking that inspiration here from Samuel which you read in the scripture is now right Laureen so let's begin so we're hearing a story of David being - and just before the scripture we read in Samuel we see that God had rejected Saul as king over his people Israel it's not right and here it was that the people said we want a king over us the judges and Samuel pleaded with the people said God is all King a man we we have no need of a judge is now right in that way and he said but nobody they reason against him and and and Bible said Saul was disturbed and when God spoke samuel was astir brother and God spoke to Samuel a prophet he said they have not rejected you but they have rejected me amen amen all is now right so the people wanted to be like the other nations is my right and sometimes that's the problem we begin to compare ourselves with others and other people and what they've gotten where they are in life and we fail to see that God's doing something special with you isn't that right so sometimes we just got a humble ourselves and let God use us where we are stop trying to be like so-and-so the Prophet said that he said you know they get jealous and said well so-and-so's planting corn I want to plant corn too I want to pump barley - but God can't place you if you're running around trying to be like brother so-and-so or sister so and so you have to take the anointing he gives you you have to work with what measure he gives you to work with his mind so I'm not trying to be like anybody this morning I'm I'm not no great man I'm not no great praise God person or anything I'm just our brother praise God bring in the Word of God to you this morning amen but I know someone who's here this morning who can meet your need and he could set the captive free and he could bless you beyond anything that I could ever to hallelujah is not about me it's about him it's not about you this morning it's not about what we can do it's about what he has already done this precious blood has made a way that we could come into his presence through the blood or we could plead the promises through the blood we could claim my inheritance we could claim our promise see many man please God so we don't claim to be nothing great it's God I look at upon the heart sees what's inside of it amen amen how a few things to see this morning so I'll just kind of take my time and go into it but I just want you to worship and get into the spirit this morning and go on a journey with me this morning because sometimes you get so bogged down with life and things get you know you're pulled here and there this family commitment work commitments bills taxes payments courts you name it you have all these things happening all around you and somehow you have to find a place of quiet in the midst of all of this to hear God speak to you he had a rustle in the mulberry tree you may not have to meet actually make a conscious effort now to turn off a lot of the channels and a lot of the noises and a lot of the distractions he means now I'm a man somehow I wish I could go back ten years younger than I was even so much has happened in 10 years there's so much distractions no your cell phone alone has 15 different ways people can communicate with you it's not if it's not Instagram its whatsapp is inaudible Facebook it's not Facebook is this is not this is that is that is that it's work amen and chain emails different things and sometimes day off is just it's almost impossible amen but we have to fight to redeem the time now God and it's been set up that way and all nature is set up that way you've got to fight the toughest will survive it's not you've got to make up in your mind that you're going to make it it's not like you're gonna tell yourself something this morning gotta tell yourself that you're not going to give up you're not going to back down what are you telling yourself this morning hallelujah because the true seed of the word it's gonna shine forth the praises of his glory the true seed in the last days every false Christ's false anointed people who claim to have this dream to have that but God promised for the elects sake he's gonna shorten those things so that he can make a way out for you and for your family and for many years a lot of hotshot Paul he's gonna make a way out Oh glory to God a man paulownia promise to make away when you see these things happening look up for your redemption try it now amen amen hallelujah we look into the hills this morning for men's comment our help we're not looking to natural things we're not looking to our pockets we're not looking to what people can provide what we can do for ourselves we are nothing this morning without its presence without its power we are nothing there's nothing that we can achieve our finite minds could never comprehend the grace of Almighty God the vastness of our God the powerful God the glory of our God so don't even try you just worship Him this morning you just praise him this morning for his goodness and mercy man you have an air this morning I'll give you a spiritually down in your soul that you could be a receptor for the waves of glory sing over us right now hallelujah the true seed of the word of God you've got something inside your hearts the devil didn't put it there cannot take it away it's a receptor it's a receiver only you can hear the voice of car it's pulling you it's pollen you shouter rejoice o poison of Almighty God [Applause] hallelujah his voice makes peace peace in the storm peace in the valley this boy speaks love this boy speaks tenderness forgiveness hallelujah this for Kipnis with you I'll miss be fair if you hearken to my voice and do all that I see I'll be an enemy to your enemy I'll be an adversary to your adversaries I will bless thy bread a night water that cup shall run over holy goodness and mercy shall follow you all the days not some of the taste but all of the taste Oh hallelujah under bounties on the sick days under weary change on the piece of feel tired right now miss relax he promised you a [Applause] many man so we thank God for His Word and I've a note here second Timothy three all Scripture is given by inspiration of God what we do it audience permission of God it would just be that letter but the Spirit of it like it keep by inspiration oh I love it Peter Paul James there were men just like you and I but they met cause they have situations and trials they had circumstances but they met God Moses elusive stutter but he met cause and crop became his mouthpiece oh hello Jacob was a deceiver but God there's something in Jacob and he turned his name from Jacob to fly oh hello my take my chosen nation God could change your name this morning you don't have to be the same Oh hallelujah we can leave here change well that's the purpose of the gospel what's the changes from glory to glory even as by the Spirit of the Lord will be holding a glass left with the Peace of the Lord we are changed into that glory let's give God give you an image something to look at but you get a spy atchoo and more you look at it the more your noisy to yourself the more you begin to change into that image I'm not looking on the left I'm not looking on alright I got my eye on the prize come on Calvary I come I going up here yonder gotta quit up him seven steps seven steps of glory oh yeah what did the Prophet say he took my place he said now Lord let me take his poor that's a purpose e-type oh oh my that's right so a charge to look at this vision here of these seven steps and to see what we are to become a many men it's not right let's go back to Samuel here no ma I don't want to jump around a little bit but I just want to man see what because God has somebody's here to show you this morning so now we see that Samuel is supposed to go on anoint one of the sons of Jesse that's that's that's the instruction he got if used to write it on a piece of paper he said I'm going today to anoint one of the sons of Jesse I don't know which one I don't have an ID card I don't have a passport size photo I don't have a IG profile I don't have anything to go with I don't even have a GPS location all I know is I'm supposed to go down to Jesse the Bethlehem and to search out one of his sons to anoint for King you see and God is doing something in secret cuz he didn't tell him to go and anoint the king in that we said we just come for sacrifice and we just come to make way for the Lord isn't that right just kind of let him know what they need to know get him in the spirit of the thing in May that God could begin to do work his mystery and unfold his mystery right among the people is now right see Samuel aggrieved that even anointed Saul and Gore repented that saw the king of Israel so what happened so I got fired so I got fired God said I have refused him amen amen it's now and I'm gonna find somebody now who's more worthy of this throne of this position of this Authority isn't that right so here comes Samuel no and I love what the Bible said he come down and they make the sacrifice and Jesse and his sons were sanctified and they come to the service we're Schiffman to please the Lord and to do that one third and do what they supposed to do a man and just in perfect order is now right God was pleased God begin to move and then all of a sudden in Samuel look upon a lion and Samuel says surely this has to be the one he looked at him might have look at his height this is his tall this structure maybe he did hundred push-ups a day I don't know yeah muscles look nice to look at you know Saul look nice too until he failed to slaughter the Amalekites until he failed to do what God told him to do it man it's not right he was good look at you know he was a tall guy he was real handsome looking priests go it's not right that was the outward appearance you man and God told Samuel he said no said see that you do not not he said if I have refused him it's not right said why because God does not look as man see it but he looks not at the outward appearance but God is looking at the heart it's not right it's not right he's looking down down on the inside it's nice so now I have a few slides actually want to show you and brothers get ready to begin to show that and it's kind of about dimensions and all of it is pretty much mathematical in nature so I'm just gonna go through it real quick and I don't mean to confound you by in any way but please God I'm gonna make this down real simple please go so I don't know if you can see what I'm seeing here but it's my first projection here now and this is what they call a one dimension object so it just has one dimension it's a line see and it goes from here to here back here that's pretty much all of the movement that you can get you know first dimension object this is one dimension here is now right so we all good with that amen okay so let's go to the next line let's go to our second dimension object so now what I want you to understand now is to catch a picture of something a little greater than we're accustomed to because this is a second dimension object now perfectly this is the second dimension screen so we can see there's a length and either a width and those are the measurements and of course it's a perfect square so they put the seen and this is what a second dimension object looks like all right so it's a square shape you can have a circle triangle of different things got it okay great let's follow me here now let's go to the next line you know thank you you may wish it was brothers back there in the third dimension object now now this is where it gets interesting now this is the world that we live in the third dimension and we see that there's different heights of things there's length there's width but there's also height and depth to things and we are operating in that world every day we walk around and we see things depend perspective we see light shadows being cast and this is a world where we are accustomed to this is what we grow up knowing this two dimension world isn't that right now mathematics has kind of suggested something and they say that if we begin to progress in mathematics we can actually begin to catch a picture of what's happening outside of our world so they said if the lines come together to make a second dimension object then the second dimension object which is the square come together to make the two-dimensional object which is these here you see that right so the two-dimensional object is made up of second dimension objects so they are willing to suggest that the third dimension object can suggest what the fourth dimension object will look like now let's flip that picture over there so this is actually what science says and mathematics both agree is a fourth dimension object and what they call it is they call it a tesseract now our human minds are too finite to comprehend what this is really supposed to look like so science has tried to get the best picture of what a four-dimensional object would look like so this isn't perfect this is just what science best guess is what a four-dimensional object actually looks like now this could get very complicated because obviously we are not cubes so if we were to look like this you begin to see some really crazy stuff the over your brain can't comprehend it see it's in a world outside of ours okay now let's put the next picture now what they've been able to do is they've been able to rotate this tesseract what we call it and what we are beginning to see here I don't know if you could notice if you look at it close enough you're gonna notice that the square on the inside is actually coming out on the outside and becoming the square the outside and it's continuously rotating like that that's so science is saying that if there is a creature that exists outside of the third dimension he's going to see something that looks like this where the inside of the object is just as visible as the outside of the object does that sound familiar in any way flip to the next picture they try to break it down into what it could be in terms of atomic structure and this is kind of what they came up with still very confusing they put a bunch of tesseracts together but I just want you to catch a picture this morning of what a fourth dimension creature they call it someone outside of our world outside of our universe is able to see 50 next picture now all right so you got that class a man I'm sorry for all the slides but I'm getting to a point here now let's go back to the 2-dimensional field is now now I love this part here what they thought about they said that the two-dimensional field this is what it looks like it's like a piece of paper that you could pull in your hands and you could see a book maybe you have a piece of people like this this is a two-dimensional plane this two-dimensional plane could represent a whole world now let's for instance imagine that we are this circle right over here in this two-dimensional world we can't really see much because if we were the circle we wouldn't be able to see much of anything here actually what we would see is a line here and a line here because our eyes would be looking in this direction but we would never see the whole picture but because we are three-dimensional creatures we could look into a two-dimensional world and see the entire picture it gives us a higher perspective that means that we know the end from the beginning we know the top we know the bottom we know it's where it starts and we know where it finishes and science and mathematics is suggesting that if there is we as three-dimensional creatures could see a two-dimensional world then it is possible to the next picture it is possible for a fourth dimension creature to see something that looks a little more expanded than what we are accustomed to it means that God has the ability to look down on our three-dimensional world and see everything in a greater measure and you can see you can see your end you can see your beginning you can see a pass you can see your future you can see a top you can see your bottom you can see a potential you can see how far you are how far you need to be who you are what name you are where your family was where you are praise God he knows everything about you did you get it and it's like but overall they say it's like a book and God has the ability to scroll through the book and that's a picture that we could catch but really what it is it's a great big universe that God has in his hands and each one of you he's turning and he's flipping and he's looking for our representation of himself some over here some over there in each age we keep flipping the object flipping the image because he was looking for something oh he was looking for his seat from before the beginning God has the ability to flip your three-dimensional objects well over and over until you see what's inside your heart [Applause] now I know this is this is really there's a really a bloomer now let's go to that next slide I was supposed to come after this one now I finished with lesson here this last two last two slides I promise now this is a three-dimensional view of a ball in a box we got that right so someone is putting the ball inside of the box now what they say is that in the third dimension where we are a three dimensional object it has the ability to hide other objects inside of it that's because we are only seeing the outside of the box we are not allowed to see inside of the box if they took a lid and put it over this box close the ball and sang you wouldn't see it they said but outside of that dimension flip the next picture mathematics is suggesting that in the fourth dimension you can actually see inside of that box it's exposed it's almost like an x-ray you could just flip the picture and see what's inside of it and then what's inside comes out on what outside comes in it's all the same to them out there outside of that dimension is nice hallelujah it's a perfect picture you see it take it off this right in man god bless you thank you and it's a perfect picture to me this morning that God is not looking at things the way that you are seeing it a lot of the times we focus so much on this outside thing and we trying to pretty up this two dimensional object ohyes not put on a nice time suit on all that is wonderful but God is not looking at tap this morning God seeing more than that to come praise God Ricardo cell together we see one another we check each other's hands that's wonderful but when God tongue in your world he could see more than you can see he's seeing a bigger picture this morning or he could see Tong pass your flesh pass your spirits tongue in a socket of your heart and the higher you go in the dimensions is the more that you can uncover it's the more that you can see or the higher you go and he said I am the high and lofty one oh well it with him of a broken heart on a contract spirits God knows you're inside this morning that in the presence of God we actually stand naked before him we are completely exposed all that you try to cover up Adam had a cover in one time he saw fig leaves try to cover himself because he felt naked holiday because that's not covering I was over in a supernatural cover him was pulled off of him and he knew the sin that he had committed and he was afraid of God I went quote calm down caught on pick up already not a Darlene nothing the same condition he was when I left him because when I flipped the test something is wrong [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Adam Adam welcome where are you I'm not seeing you in my Kazem in my economy here the way things move and working the thousand places but as soon as he got out of position everything went out of whack try to get a picture know the chaos that took place don't in that dimension when man lost his position of authority the lion is to live with the lamb but now all that flip over all that change color different nature holiday I got a different behavior different things started to happen and God knew something went wrong the whole turn change and go to realize something was wrong he come down to investigate because man was out of position the world fell in darkness Halloween I know the profits that come after was the shadows was just types but there was one that come the Bible said when he hallelujah put him and when he came upon the people the Bible said the light had sprung up holily a lighter Sean where there wasn't light before he came a man saying the kingdom of heaven is at hand it was Jesus he was different he was unique he was special when God flip him when God flip and he said behold here's my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased I'm well pleased apologized him I'm well pleased I carry him in the wilderness to be tested and tempting Oh hallelujah alright because he's not like the image I was in the beginning [Applause] well are you catching it now a man so God doesn't look at the output appearance but he looks on the inside and he knows the whole plan now it's as I said it's really complicated and it's beyond us trying to even figure out because if he dwells in a seventh dimension then think of how much dimensions they are beyond between us and him and how much understanding you have to get to before you can even begin to see or understand what God sees David said knowledge to high for me I cannot attain unto it follow me so we're not trying to figure it out this morning we're just trusting in God because he knows the plan he knows the way he knows we're supposed to go what you're supposed to do who is supposed to talk to what shop is supposed to have Oh hallelujah Oh glory so this morning or prayer ought to be lon show us thy will show me what I'm supposed to do because if he knows the end from the beginning he knows what you are supposed what you have need of he knows where you're supposed to end up and he knows what decision you're supposed to make so that means this morning you are charged to trust the God that knows the whole picture with all of your decision-making hallelujah with everything that you're supposed to to trust God this morning he knows his glory fills the temple he's a part of the universe he's a part of the Stars part of the mountains there's nothing greater than Alcorn hallelujah heaven is my throne the earth is my footstool he come down and visit his people ohand blesses people with healing and deliverance oh he's always on time he hears your voice a man a man the woman at the well she didn't know what was inside of her she didn't know what is inside of her furthermore the outward appearance looked bleak because when you look at our output appearance when you look at her works you wouldn't want to be near to that woman people didn't want to be seen with her people don't want to talk to her it's not right and in those days there was Pharisees there was Sadducees there was man who lofty man of the cloth men who were revered and respected among the people is now right tippy in the marketplaces kissing the babies looking all political piracy means that actor which means they acted out their religion holy holy when tall hats is now right but when poor look Tong and that same thing what people call ingrates call Paul foolishness consider like Deadman points and the Nexus focus when I look at them I don't see no witness when I slip damage it can't nothing I can see it don't make sense to me let me go find somebody but this word will make more sense to because the Messiah came to them and they understood him not and they knew him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God because they had a witness in their soul thank you Jesus Oh glory glory glory glory it's a bigger picture span your vision this morning beyond all this 3-dimensional stuff beyond the chair that you're sitting on beyond a suit that you're wearing a dress that you're wearing forget about all that there's a world that's more real and this one and you are here what you are somewhere else and we are going to that somewhere else by the sweet by-and-by promised us the hands of man Oh hallelujah glorious City as a bride adorned for her husband go here to meet him all the bridegroom comets let your robes white this morning Holy Ghost God in your soul fire come inside of there and change you and rearrange you [Applause] yeah come to this woman she gave me a drink he was waiting they told the disciples go and get some meat one buy something one relish yourselves I pass to Samaria I am just a two of his will but God have the plan I am just operating and accord with the plan in his hand see I have somebody down there who has who's got something in their soul she got her seed of predestination she don't know it yet she don't hear it yet but she's gonna hear it I'm sending you down go talk to that woman go tell her her name is on the book go tell her she's not what she ought to be but that boat Ella she's not what she used to be that voice speak to her gonna talk to the woman [Applause] investigating spirit of the Holy Spirit does feeling Christ begin to probe out the woman no we tell his story so many times but I can imagine cause reaction when Christ said go call your husband and she could have at that point she could have lied here was a respectable-looking man came and asked her you know for a husband she could have brought the man she was living with and see what this noise were she could have done that she could have fronted put up a front seal it's a shameful thing to say I don't have but she chose at that moment to be honest she chose at that moment might have been a quite a dishonorable thing what she said at that point in time but she chose rather to be honest right there and then with this stranger she's never met but yet she felt that there's something about this man that was different I when he spoke to her go call your husband she said I have none and I can imagine at that moment God begin to smile I said I didn't make a mistake this is the one and he said you speak the truth because I won the 11 it is not shown he said if you know who you are talking to you asked me for drink of water and he said there's gonna come a time what the true worshipers the father in spirit was a true worshiper she was going to come out of a situation come out of a circumstance come out of a trial come out of a chest it's only a test it's only temporary this morning fill your hopes on things eternal and a hold of God's unchanging hand all the things of this world are temporal it's just 3d just an illusion of reality it'll all fit away pretty soon well hallelujah what's more real than this it's the thing that keeps put to this world in the first place and it'll be a thing that recreates it John said behold I said a new heaven and a new earth and the old one was faded away and town come a city whole hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and just as God has a city but it's pulling up people to go and inhabit that city and you are that people hallelujah the devil is a liar this morning try to tell you couldn't make it but you were born for this you will raise up for this oh don't let the devil tell you otherwise God knows your story this morning man said I just speak it to you I am he woman ran why because she saw something something greater than what she was seeing all the time something greater than her 3d world she saw something higher a higher perspective yeah higher voice calling her upward out of what she was into what God wanted her to be a man and we answered a call this morning because there's a voice calling you this morning calling you higher come out of her my people be not partakers of her plagues come out of her Oh chimera confusion come out of Babylon and be lifted up let the King of glory come in this morning come into your soul come into your heart and give you a genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost on fire where is faith and virtue and dollar temperance wait you can turn you into that image from glory to glory man God knows the whole plan it's a big complicated plan there's many roads that you could take what God this wisdom is beyond anything finite in this world knows where the path is he knows he knows what's supposed to happen when I suppose happen we're supposed to happen these leagues above your thinking leads up of your situation leads up of your trial leads up of your circumstance trust in God this morning he is able to take you through hallelujah hallelujah he just knows I'm not trying to figure it out I'm just trusting in God because what science is declaring right now they say if they continue going so they go into bong supper entity that is so big it will scare them they just keep racing on in technology and figuring things out and as far as the radio waves gone hope far do the voice go and hope I'll is this going what's in this dimension wasn't that dimension man is continuing to tap into it isn't it trying to figure out the greatness of this car and this is quartz but this is this is God's this is God's plea feel God just moving at our own moving this around every time they try to do this we pluck them he plucked them here praise good God know where they're going you have them like enough fish for God is wanting control you could only go so far no more science don't see the try to figure out a 4 dimension object look like much more powerful for six but their brain is past figuring it out where we stop code continues and it goes on and he goes on and he goes on and he goes on and to eternity to Eternity Oh hallelujah [Applause] Goliath made a mistake when he defied the armies of the Living God he didn't realize what he was up against he thought his might he thought the structure he thought his shekels of iron had anything to do attached he thought he was nine cubits and a span and I was gonna measure up to anything what he didn't realize on the finger of God hallelujah molecule orientated sir who is this uncircumcised Philistine [Applause] I'm Ananias who was thinking like God who had brought hearts a man after God's own heart hallelujah what will make a boy almost challenge at the light like that it had to be a vision greater and what he was seeing greater than what he could imagine an experience that he had that anchored on his soul made him convinced because he was influenced by this divine spirit he was influenced he was fully persuaded so persuaded that he ran down to meet Goliath and to us that same foolish that'll make sense because he had no might of his own to squash that giant he wasn't depending on his own power but he knew the core of the universe the core of his father's Abraham and Isaac he knew that God was real and if got to do it for them he could do it for me if you need healing this morning Satanist mountain be thou removed there's a core that's greater than you he's greater than me he knows what you have need up this morning speak to your circumstance speak to your situation speak to the rock this morning Oh hallelujah and let it bring forth his waters let it overflow Oh hallelujah my I mean hurry on down you know a man you love Lotus spoon eyes here fifty five set my thoughts are not your thoughts neither my ways your ways see it the Lord but the heavens are higher than you so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts higher than your thoughts he's not a different level this morning oh oh listen you gotta think bigger this morning you gotta think greater this morning greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world there's a greater perspective there's a higher in this morning I can blow in a storm do you have a storm in your life it's a devil trying to stir up trouble there's a man one time who had the ability to speak to the song he said peace be sir and I've shown you where to go oh I thought okay that voice and that voice is here this morning that voices on you that voice is getting ready to bail itself in a bride Anya she will have to say it the Lord or she will keep [Applause] here's a quote here from the Prophet fellowship I Redemption preached in 1955 he said now you never die jesus said he that heareth my words and believe it on him that sent me has everlasting life he said you can't die you can die he said it twice just to make sure you understand what he's saying he said you just you die to this mortal part he said but you're alive here you're alive is that here your spirit is right here with Christ he said and then you say Lord how long is it see he said cause he wasn't me being seeing something you know he said he wasn't made that because you're a human being he said and you're longing to come back to this body perfect again so he explains it now he said Annie said and God says just a little while longer until your fellow servants how long long until your fellow servants there has suffered like the martyrs did back there he said and then you will return coming down now he or the prophet explains it he said after you go out of this body out of cosmic light and Petroleum's and what you are made up of that's all your 3d stuff right he said and you go into the fourth dimension he said an out of that into the fifth and then into the sixth dimension then God is in the seventh and he said you are right under his altar he said then when God's left your spirit loose after the end of it all he said it picks up what comes down out of the sixth dimension into the fifth cosmic light come out of the light into Petroleum's out of petroleum into the senses and then here you are back on again a brand new person not old and broke down never to be sick you're here will never turn green you'll never be wrinkled you'll never separate no more you'll never die you'll never be hungry you'll never have a worry what a condition you never have no more pills no more stresses Oh Jeanie is complete there's no way you'll walk with your loved ones and shake their hands and eat and drink and build houses and inhabit them and live forever and forever in the presence of the Lord Jesus oh is that that's what you've got this morning because you heard a little car oh we've got a blessed hope oh the devil will she have this hope but he forfeited it up there in heaven and he can't get it and now he's jealous because you're gonna receive the Holy Ghost jealous because you're gonna make it please tell us because one day you're gonna be oh it's okay to dance it's okay to shout it's okay to lift your hands we got a promise oh that's my mind Oh crazy to see you oh what a glorious promise oh this awesome purchase every day what do you sit back in your job just think about the glory that you had with him before the world was just lay back in that office chair and think about the glory now that you had with him before there was a moon before there was a star oh you are there and because you are there you come down here to prove to Satan that you are not like ease oh we believe every word a man Oh Yuri see the Holy Ghost your family's gonna be delivered you're gonna be a conqueror we are more than conquerors through him that loved us [Applause] oh I love it this morning I love it this morning glory to glory we go from glory to glory we never be the same hallelujah oh my isn't it simple prophet said preachers make it so complicated we just make it so complicated he said you have to come and take prohibitions and all these other things he said it's not it's not complicated the Bible said it's so plain till even a fool shouldn't error just accepting it believing it something happens in here oh it goes past the flesh goes past the human spirit down in a socket of your heart something happens suddenly takes place and the devil knows when it takes place the devil will know and you're different oh the devil will know when you stop lying when you stop cheating when you stop Crescent the devil no he said Paul I know meat I know hallelujah and he's gonna know you because you'll be a witness of God Anya you'll be a witness of that pyramid those seven thunders follow your uncle evil right we're gonna be manifested rittany vessels red of all men oh and the devil will take note that you've been with Jesus or the people take a look [Laughter] that's the purpose e-type form to bring you back to fellowship again to bring you back to his bosom many men oh my my oh I believe it this morning oh we inspired this morning oh we see the plainness of God holla we see the mightiness of God gonna get a picture friends it's it's it's you can't figure love it's just too big [Applause] it was so big the secret was so precious to God this is the mystery of Christ in you the hope of glory is so precious to God he didn't just give this to anybody it was a great big plan I stretch it out to seven ages right at the end time just before the great and terrible day of the Lord God didn't go get a scholar he didn't go get a wise man he got a humble prophet Kentucky prophet o humble man he wasn't much but car to use him Oh hallelujah and he stand there before the people say good evening friends I'm day today Marilla but all of the greatness of God was failing this son of man prophets [Applause] when the Seventh Seal was open it was silence in heaven space enough for now God press a button shut down nothing moved - ah and the devil was looking because he wanted to see what all this great thing was coming to he was building up to something 60 or 50 or 60 coming on or something the devil is excited because he wanted to see what is under the Seventh Seal that was so important and he got a major disappointment when it opened and there were silence when a prophet said when that was taking place revelation 10 was taking place at the same time is now the Bible says seen as we have such a great cloud of witnesses let us run the race with patience so this cloud of witnesses which was Paul Iranians Martin Columba Lou - Wesley when the service here was shut down he shut down heaven God said come come my servants I'm gonna close you in the cloud and we're gonna go down to my prophets who is on the earth because he's got a message to get up ride out before the dreadful day of the Lord he's got to receive a message hallelujah how seven Thunder message a seven seals seven Thunder message oh the Eternals forbidden to write it he heard it I was about to write leaders had sealed up those things which is haven't done without her and write them not I'm gonna give it to my prophet he's gonna prophesy he's gonna testify of me the seven thunders will get paper wrapped her in grace antennas we'll call it back together nila kilobyte Oliver's gonna call [Applause] you early church had it and it ever come in there nicely is now right on room and please key to the whole thing I'm gonna run a town into the ground and he tagged back there matters time for the truth this gospel dripping with blood but God swore by himself said I will restore see the Lord God promised he we saw that tree right back so up come loser I'm from Wesley I've come down other Pentecostals in the right they were coming onto something but when the Prophet come on eh that was the fullness of God made manifest oh and he counted together all of the mysteries all of the loose ends all of loser did all that Wesley Taylor he made it known attentive people what God was doing coming up to something it was coming up what it was to do this perfection now I'm gonna say something call us so mysterious that he couldn't give you the whole plan because they would blow your mind up like a scratch bomb okay it's too much so what God did he hid a mystery of himself all throughout through the ages hit it so Luther come up and preach the just shall live by faith and he was just living a part of it and the devil didn't know what's going on all he knows a big move and the people raised up and believe the word of that out hallelujah and then only rise they should take it over and the devil found a way in it it's nice let Wesley come up and he had another greater measure here speaking on sanctification it's nice and he ran up people of that day rose up and believed the world for a town and cried out hallelujah and begin to lift this Hannah fication so much until it please the Holy Spirit until I wanted to pour out upon them but the age was not yet Holland was not allowed to pour out in that way but they had a revival on the word for their name because this was a word in season it was a word for their time an hour and call throughout the ages throughout the dispensations was unfolding himself unfolding himself because when his loveliness in his wisdom his pictures are too much for us to understand God spoke to John and said come up hither I want to show you something and John began to see this the son of man liken us to one standing among the seven golden candlesticks and he said this and he spoke that John saw a light and a throne and it's now all these things are images images and visions a God gives to his servant John to show him things that was things that aren't things I want to come because it was too mysterious to show it and it's it's his brain can tell him all of that so court unfolded a revelation to him a book of symbols and you're gonna understand what this means and what that mean God beginning to speak to the church through symbols and to types and true shadows clawed hallelujah I never show in its mystery and full but here little they are little until you come into a perfect state where you could know all of these things it's not so it's gonna come out where you are going to know as you are known when God showed prophet the plan of what God was doing with them pyramids this was God's representation God given us our vision God given us a picture of what we are supposed to be isn't that right now this is just a picture but what you are going to do is to live this thing this has got to become a presence my experience in your life because the Bible said a letter killeth but the Spirit give it life and you've got to know God by an experience the Spirit has got to come and I love what Buddha George can lease and Wednesday night he said the spirit King you know after Jesus was baptized he suffered his baptism and then they'll come down and lighten up on him there was a sign of the Messiah but now watch he had to go into the wilderness to be tested and to be tried he had to be proven to be the right kind of a son so we can't just sit around saying we're gonna talk about it or we gonna fellowship around it how long are we going to hallelujah mon-sol let's go up color to perfection this morning because there's something that God wants to do there's a bride this morning

up in the mountains he said prophet said and I saw her dad offices sorry division or something and he said and they told me he said he told me said now he said you could say it's four o'clock just a

said what is that woman's name she just he said a young blonde haired woman then I guess somebody told prophet said Marilyn Monroe he said that was it he said she she died and she she didn't commit suicide it's what the spirit or she died of a heart attack Amen God knows all things a man what the police investigation couldn't figure out a man the Prophet already knew is now he said I felt sorry for the girl she always seemed some kind of a woman weary he said she needed something is that wish I could have got to the child he said she needed Christ she might have went to some cool formal Church but she needed a real case of salvation he said with something in a heart to give that assurance he said he can see it on her face TG was lacking something oh isn't that all right reminds me of that rich young ruler who was lacking something and he knew it and he came to Jesus and he said what should I do and she said do the good things and be at times and come to church and do the right things and all these things I've done for my you too what and the Spirit of God moved Oh Holly Holly and the part is that the Jesus loved him there and when he looked hung when he flipped over the

a slave to sin I am a child of God you'll be who you're meant to be then brother a royal priesthood a holy nation helia people oh my where was I she needed Christ something in her heart to give her that assurance a father she said she'd never seen him my mother was in an unseen institution it was all on the girl's mind prophetsí just see right to it she needed Christ and then in that we know that see and then the other night he said My Children was telling me that on the television there they were going to a play called the River of No Return he said in there is where I caught the world record rainbow down there one time with the Christian businessman he's not only wanted me to see if that was the river or to go to a place with the television and see it or something and if if that was a river and if and if Don Smith the guide had taken this girl down so he said he said there's there she was on the television so you see Marilyn Monroe now on the television screen that seemed good that he had seen that had been dead a year ago or so but there she is every move she made was right there acting out on the screen her voice alive he said now that's in like a fourth dimension he says he said a nut same thing will be to every one of us at the day of judgment Oh God's gonna play back on his big mighty screen your life different snapshots I'm God know which slide to pull out the one way did this and you did that but God no decide to pull out when you repented when he forgive you you know that's light to pull out when you made it right what holiday is now when you went to that brother and you said forgive me brother he could pull up slideouts Oh hallelujah you can erase your past he can bless your future he knows the whole picture is now I unspoken when he original see God said your voice is like our pebble in the river you drop a pebble in a ring goes out rings ripples go out and he said it goes out to the end of the stream he said it's just like that he said in the fourth dimension he said your voice don't stop here he said we stop speaking here and he's no longer here or voice or voice fades out but he said it continues on in another dimension somewhere else it continues on the property ripples all the way down to the day of judgment and meets up with you there and he said the only thing could stop it it's the blood of Jesus Christ it's the only thing that can stop that voice from condemning you when you repent when you made it right that blood grab the whole inner voice and stopped it from condemning you at the judgment bar hallelujah that's what he said hey man it's the truth oh my he said here Jesus he said acting odd that's it he's alright see that's that's how it is under their judgment yes I said and then when Jesus Christ spoke these words he said they never die science claims that in 20 years from now the Prophet said they can pick up the literal voice they'd be able to pick up the literal voice of Jesus he said it's still in the earth he said cassy it's it's a sending post you are he said and there has to be a receiving post so he said Christ was the sender hallelujah when he pressed sin and sent his voice out he said it sent his voice out all around the earth I said you are the receiver might have been 2000 years later but God knew you would be here and that you would be the recipient of his voice [Applause] when Jesus said unhappy you shall know I'm and the father here in me and I knew that wasn't just three disciples that wasn't just whatever was all wrong but that world was for you that word was for me when he said I love you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that wasn't just for you thousand just for them it was my every generation the Word of God going on going on going on hallelujah t believe it do you believe it I say a prophesy he said virgin shall conceive and he spoke it and he released that word and there are four things that can't come back and one of them is a spoken word and when that thing went out it was like a sparrow it had to find somebody and I thought find somebody some host that he could use to manifest that word I went God look down he flip and flip and flip and he couldn't find a witness but all of a sudden other than a girl named Mary was born and God saw some money when he check his book and he checked the 3d object and he checked the spirits and he check her soul yes he found a match and the Holy Spirit hover over Mary wait and wait and waiting for the prophecies of people fill [Applause] [Music] when the seasonal right when the time was right not a moment too soon she was to be a spouse of Joseph God set it up that we can look like confusion they make it look like commerce as we call it I can imagine all joseffer felt here's a young man getting ready to be a sponsor wife when she come back from the season to come back with child and she's claiming that his child's of the Holy Spirit seeing the Lord had spoken to me by his angel and they couldn't what is that there's the first time I ever heard of it that'll make sense it don't compute hallelujah pretty calm processes that is above their thinking it is above their understanding but somehow God put something in Mary to believe this thing she said be upon unto me according to thy word she didn't doubt it for one moment he just said he owns the Holy Spirit overshadow you and you're gonna bring forth a son and his name shall be called Emmanuel Jesus hallelujah it's not the Son of the Living God Oh holily and she believed it all of us but she had to stand a persecution for that she understand a reproach and anytime you go out there to step out to believe something for God you're gonna stand a reproach oh there's a reproach that you have to bear for the words sake but you have a revelation in your soul of whose child you're carrying Oh and it gives you confidence to know that it's not my mind it's not my power but it's by my spirit saith the Lord of Hosts oh honey oh my the wonders of God I showed Joseph boys pulling my side as he chose it she pregnant hold up on that boy no and it was taught there was here he is now right praise God he could have put her away there's many options he had and he was doing his finite three dimensional world trying to figure this thing out one night he fell asleep and had a dream ohana an angel come to him and said don't you worry I know it love messed up but nothing was going on there that is Christ that is Jesus and when Joseph woke up that morning was a different morning that day was a different day cause it come wrong Mary and he said don't you worry honey God's got you and I've got you too and it's gonna be all right God's gonna make her way I know what's going on cause Revere Oh my hallelujah oh what a joy they had joy they're probably the only two people in that whole situation was happy what was going on everybody else is trying to figure out what is this family is under ruin the under scrutiny the obstacle to the market they have to pay their bills they have to see the same people and Terry explain to them what's going on but Mary know what was going on Joseph know what's going on praise God they won't thought they weren't ignorant of what quarter stick was what school was taking place and so too will the pride she will not be ignorant of what God is doing in this hour or she'll be well aware she will know when you see these things taking place when you see these great perplexities oh look up your attention joint nine boys get ready to pop - you with the Holy Ghost get ready oh how do you do something no eye has seen no ass heard what God is fixing to do for you and I oh we shall behold here face to face oh oh I feel like singing this morning my hallelujah it's good it's precious hey man I don't want to stay too long again amen try to find market to win down here oh but he loved the Lord this morning make a little shot up Rick [Applause] I love you you're glowing all right so therefore when God looks down he don't even see us you don't see a Mystics of failures he could look down past that and see the sea down in your soul that seed of predestination Hollyer that see that he four days some since before to be in it oh that's what he is in contact with that's why when he speaks he knows and sunny you that will respond well he's not making it's not hit-and-miss he's not a hit-and-miss god well he is precise he is on target he knows who you are he knows where you are he knows who your family is he knows what your promises he knows you were born for this he knows you were raised up but such a time as this he knows that not long until eruption uh-huh crisis I miss your God reveal he said now notice what I retrieval purpose in his great mystery Secret Garden his mystery secret that he had before all began he's got a three-fold per person and he said I know we want to go up this morning and is what is this true for purpose he said see now I believe by the help of God who is present and he'll show it to us now if he had this threefold purpose we want to find out what is this tree for purpose I said the first thing was that God wanted to reveal himself to the people he's nobody couldn't do it as the great Jehovah God who covered all space and time and eternity that that picture is too big you don't know nothing outside of the third dimension so how are you gonna understand the vastness of this God it's impossible he said it was too mysterious right so he can do it as great Jehovah God to cover all eternity he couldn't so he's too great to ever be revealed to the people because it would be too mysterious how could that create big being that never to begin that never went beyond a circle of a hundred billion Trulia trillions years of life space and out into the in finite into the eternity and a great creature that was all that and still is so he describes his vastness trillions and trillions of light space I'm gonna occupies all of that and he still is this morning the mighty Conqueror the great and mighty spirits oh there is a mighty spirit this morning I covers here it covers you it speaks to me no I come in a volume of the book oh I didn't like to do thy will o my said I enter eternity a great creature he was and not all that is and still in sea but what he wanted to do well he loved fatherhood for he was a father and the only way that he could express it was to become a son of man he said that's the reason Jesus kept saying the son of man see the son of man they didn't they didn't know what he was talking about many of them but he was actually expressing God's attributes to be the son of man oh isn't that right oh my hallelujah excuse me he may I didn't know he was talking about no do you get it see a man he said he wanted to express himself that was his one of his great three four purposes was to express himself to identify himself they came to make a picture of himself that we could see that we can have fellowship with and we can interact with now he could know you by infirmities and by a false and my mistakes and my ax failures he the part of the universe became a humble man and grown with a headache and had trials and testings but yet when he spoke he was more than a man when he spoke Harlan said peace be still when he spoke and said Lazarus comfort it was more than a man it was completely man completely god oh oh my you wanted to identify himself with human beings our us lowly human beings to reveal himself in Christ secondly to have the preeminence in his body of believers hey man that's his that's his bride that's you here this morning he wants to have the preeminence Holly wants to be a chord of the audience he wants to be so pleased to come down on 12 that we create an atmosphere of worship and praise unto a god that caught come down to inhabits the praises of his people the presence of Almighty God Shalom is peace on the continent down in the midst of your circumstance and give you bread and give you water and give you peace peace tongue in your soul Oh hallelujah top preeminence to have the oversight it's not profit selling ninety one to the end time he said the holy spirit today is the message they say so Holy Spirit Moses is the Holy Spirit he right now it's the Holy Spirit that's gonna take you over to the promised land structure the Holy Spirit hallelujah is what's going to show you how to possess your individual inheritance Joshua the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit's we've been magnified before us well Holly [Applause] [Laughter] it'll be more than a man it'll be the church coming into its mighty power and the Philistines will go to pack it up then the shots will go off say girls will be missing faces will be wash the sisters won't grow their hair out there'll be a mass and Sapphira on a few of them when the church got them to its mighty power they will have not seen the Lord or keep still they'll be the true seed of his word a man boy winding down now won't express himself fool it's going real good any man a few more our clothes a man the other in this morning oh you've been a wonderful audience this morning may God bless you and fill you this morning that keep you whatever you need up I can't do it but there's a car outside about three dimensional universe that knows your heart this morning and he fill you with all of his peace with all this love with all of his presence and provide your every need man any man any man boom I see hallelujah oh my so you want to have the preeminence now the second part you know in his body of believers that his bride that he might live in the people I would alone hiding in the sea hide him in your heart he gonna write in your fleshly tablet Abel's holily of your heart his word that you might live it actually might be comments that you could change from this image to glory to glory to glory even as by the Spirit of the Lord amen amen to live in the people and now he could do that in Adam and Eve but sin separated them and so now they had to be some way to get back in again to get it back again oh my and when I said this is just rich to me the Prophet said just they even think it see he said it so rich to me see what God's purpose was why did blue know now why didn't he just keep like that without saying it's not right see but what God's purpose was he thought he would never be able to express his fullness his full attribute hallelujah you don't see the path of him that was with them in the Garden of Eden but you'd never get to see the god of salvation if you never went to the pain of loss if you never been lost before you wouldn't know how it meant to be saved if he wasn't burden you wouldn't know how it meant to be free if he wasn't empty you wouldn't know how it meant to be filled you wouldn't be gracious and you would never be able to sing Amazing Grace how sweet the sound but God calls God let all of this happen here so that his fullness could be expressed Oh cuz he could have been a father there that's true but he's also a savior he couldn't be a savior there when I remain evil perfect in a condition so he had to let things happen see he's saying how do you know he was well because I've had an experience the Prophet said see he's a savior and he had to express that how could he do it only through Christ how could he be a son only through Christ how could he be a healer only through Christ through Christ all things I man see all things are wound up and that one person Jesus Christ oh man he said when I when I think of it I just see the nominations pass off the scene and everything just just going he sees I see when I see God's great bloopers revealing himself he said oh it's just phases of it it's not right but God was coming on to something denomination denomination prize prize churches churches but go to China come on to that perfect one Transco China come down to that one who will not be deceived hallelujah by the thoughts of man but what hold fast to those things that were promised the whole to that word oh you like Abraham every man's word and that cause won't be true I'm not ashamed of gospel I'm not ashamed to stand I'm not ashamed to believe what God has said oh that's who you are this morning Oh hallelujah and God is glorified in your testimony and how you overcome overcome the darkness overcome the trial overcome those Pelton's overcome every loss and spirit fornication you overcome overcome the devil at all his tricks you overcome well greater is He that's in you get my shadow brain yeh man wonderful Oh hallelujah only to

hallelujah you know I don't know a man my I don't keep me to keep it long oh this is wonderful God give us a picture see an early representation of his glory in Christ amen hallelujah all that Christ was was a reflection of this mighty mysterious unimaginable God he come down in a form that we could understand a picture that we could know he loved the unlovable he forgave the unforgivable he reached out to those who are hungry to those who in need then how could you claim to love of God you can't see and not even love your own brother it's falsehood when that same Jesus these shreds out his tent to make a way for the sinner how we ought to have a heart to go after them if God make a waiter why should we hold anybody back or keep anybody town or condemn anybody when Christ forgive us what can I forgive you this morning Oh hallelujah what can I say I'm sorry forgive me this wrong forgive me my attitude oh honey when we see how small we are finite we are in the program of God Oh Holly oughta make us humble [Applause] recognizing our own finiteness own littleness of small now any moment if God take us out on hand weird for but it's God I kept you kept you alive David said so that you should not go down into the pit Oh hallelujah he is your shield and buckler is you're exceeding uncritical David how horsemen David had a real good army they was jealous phalion kinds and yet God did not put his trust in Princes knowing horses when he put his trust in the Lord Oh put your trust in the Lord this morning and everything is going to be orange or you make your burden easy oh I make a yoke light this morning amen hallelujah oh my you can fool my prophet a sign that is what is true is now Oh hallelujah oh dear a man can ride away no no Oh hallelujah the unity of one God in one church the Prophet said it wasn't that it's here it's the so-called meetings here today he said oh they're Greek meetings but it only works on he limped intellectual part of man see a man gets under the spell of a revival and he says well yes I accept Christ he does it intellectually because maybe there isn't a great crowd and so forth he does it because maybe there's great ministers before him but it's only an intellectual conception that man could never go on he's got to come from his mind to his heart and be born again or he'll never be able to go on a mess now you never be able to stand the test well that's important when the real test comes can you stand it it'll prove the experience you have that's why he said it's got to come from your head all this intellectual stuff but you got to lay in the presence of the Sun until all the greenness it's beat out of you until you become mature until you become a right wing until it called down into the sockets of your heart and then the will it takes a real effect in your heart and life and then you begin to live something that this world will hear tyreq from cloth that's what it's got to come down to or we'll never make it friends oh my poor procrastinator a bride she's got what it takes she's like Mary she's got what it takes to go through the trial to go through the persecution to do all the way we cover many men see oh my remember is now right oh my god accept Christ's intellectual conception is all right but when remember when the eye looks upon it Oh will see an eye of God he said the devil used oh no he said your intellectual eyes sorry he said your intellectual eye when the devil uses your eye isn't in a Garden of Eden it proved that the devil chose the head of man to work in but God chooses his heart and the devil chooses him with his eyes so you cease your eyes to look upon something that's why when cats look around he saw plains of Jordan not Jordan rather but of Sodom and Gomorrah so that was wonderful oh and it was pleasant to look at he pitches tend towards them but when God spoke tell you about it said look not look West look salt all is yours I couldn't tell you that because they were closed up with Lawton he's they and their strife between you but as soon as he got out by yourself now I could speak to you no I could show you my promise and not lose his eyes and pitch his tent toward Sodom and then sooner or later you know he ended up in some hollow why because he uses eyes to look at the scene Sodom didn't take much work to cultivate it was already cultivated that land you just gone below who is you see sign up get a mortgage stock up start a new it look easy but the end thereof he didn't calculate it he didn't realize how much you would lose orange it's time to lose by that investment make the right investment today friends look to the Word of God don't look to intellect amen hallelujah oh my getting ready to close now position could come remember when the eye looks upon AWI what but it poop that the devil chose a head of man to working but God chooses his heart the devil shows him with his eyes something that he can see and he says well seeing is believing but when God comes to a man he comes to his heart and lets him believe things by his heart truth in that his eyes does not see but the scripture says faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen God working here sitting working here so what does these big schools and seminaries do anyhow it's sometimes not always but too many times it pulls from here up to here it ought to be taken from here down to here in a man's heart you see it stays up here and it doesn't go down here see he said you know the scripture says as a man thinketh in his heart so is he oh isn't that right a man the infidel the critic used to say how foolish God was to see that there was a mental faculties in a man's heart for there's nothing left to think with but he said about four years ago the Prophet said science found out that in the human heart there is a thinking faculty there is a little room a little place where there's not even a self a little compartment in a human heart it isn't the animal or no other life but in the human heart there's a little place that they could never come to a conclusion about what it was but finally they said this is a place where the soul dwells and so God does not speak his words right as a man thinketh his heart so is he not in his head if God would have meant that he would have said it but he said heart is now right skipping on down here now he said he said that's what he meant he said he never sent to shake hands he said he never said to join church is now right he said you must be born again and that from above a man you must be born again not put your name on a book but be regenerated and your soul changed your entire being made new again Oh Holly is now right that's what God deals with his now or spoken word he was no seed he said I'm from a little group of the seed of the word God presents a Christ our beloved brother a virgin a virgin of his word a man through them will be fulfill all that has been promised for this woman and a virgin who knows no man may creature dogmas but would have promised in himself like it wasn't Mary called himself that we just spoke about it may manifest he will act himself by his own would've promised so to fulfill that that has been written of him a mess not right and as he did when he came from that virgin womb isn't that right he says a little on down he said you know he said they will love him and they will love his and love his and they will be half his potentials for he is their head and they are his subjects oh we are subjects here this morning subjecting ourselves our every high thought into captivity oh isn't that right this morning man my subject to his head headship of Christ was his notice what harmony jesus never did anything until seen of the father or the father showed him first how many between God and Christ see Saint John 5:19 so will the bride so will you be this morning you're gonna be that same way harmony just as God has with Christ you will have with him we man your lover your mates he Messner alright oh my she never doubts it a man hallo he shows that his word of life he shows her and she receives it she never doubts it nothing can harm her not even 1000 my boy the CP planted the water will raise it up again all under what is coming this morning oh I love Greek water and spirits the great holy spirits to water that seed to bring it to life to make it live it'll raise it up again Eman the Prophet said I got a great big hallelujah here's the secrets the word is in the pride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name she has just sayeth the Lord oh and a man arrives and then it's two more times so the holy sprit waters it until it's grown until it serves its purpose to serve God's purpose this morning don't let that deceive you Oh hallelujah Mary Mary glory to God he can replace only softly I'm almost finished you could stand hallelujah glory I'll read one more and then we close out now why hasn't it been an organization start up in these last twenty years of this great revival he said its anointed prophet so knowing the teachers are so forth but why anything he said well there's nothing beyond the green sea it's back without an organization oh my he said a blind man can see it you could borrow his now you see that it cannot organize it's so firmly against it it's a grain of wheat itself it come back to the seat again Oh hallelujah but we've come back to the original this morning holla be it done unto me according to thy will the Son of man oh we've made manifest the great win if we could come back to itself again the son of man in the last days he said there we come false impersonations of it in the last days that will almost deceive the elected if possible he said look at their organizational shocks pulling away now is that it only lets that only happens now but it lets the wheat to be known to the elected which is you here this morning which are part of it notice how beautiful this brought in here now prophet said notice the anointed ones be able the true elected predestinated Ephesians 1:5 will be ordained elected he said they are the only ones that it will not deceive notice he said the anointed prophets will be false they'll be among it to be true anointed are you gonna tell it'll be by the word see like we have it in shadow now do you see it congregation says Amen says he notice the anointed ones only the world will separate them not the science Oh No they'll do the same science but the word says the word is what because I separate them sure stay with that word this morning amen amen hallelujah we are that bright this morning that were nobodies Eve but we stay with that ruler they all done this and that the other sure that's the same jesus said they'll do the same thing but the world is what separates them notice not the science but the world isn't that right glory glory glory and the promise that we receive is a seal of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right for that is God and the former his spirit you being his word in you and then he comes in and if you receive the word in you the Holy Spirit is the only thing that can make that live and then you have the promise of possessing the gate of every enemy that tries to attack you that's right God promised it and it is so made a lot bless you this
