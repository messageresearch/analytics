[35:35] amen and I think we all have to learn a
[35:38] lot
[35:44] amen amen amen because we are disciples
[35:48] disciples have to learn you know I am
[35:51] one of the Elder
[35:54] Minister not comparing myself of his
[35:57] brother Ed and different other ones they
[35:59] are in the
[36:01] age more than myself but I consider
[36:05] myself also as one of a long
[36:10] time when I think about my life we we
[36:15] got converted in the
[36:17] year uh I got converted in the year
[36:21] 62 uh
[36:25] I
[36:27] uh I started preaching from the from the
[36:31] year
[36:34] 67
[36:37] amen
[36:38] so we know a
[36:41] lot amen we are we are alltimers
[36:45] alltimers we have faced a lot of things
[36:49] doctrines move of doctrines and
[36:52] different things it's also good
[36:55] everything is good Hallelujah
[36:57] everything
[36:59] is behind every move is God
[37:03] Amen so we are grateful and we love one
[37:07] another I believe we I believe person
[37:11] also that we need to have to have
[37:14] brotherly
[37:16] kindness and the prophet said in the
[37:18] message I think stage of the perfect man
[37:21] try to
[37:23] understand what he believes amen only to
[37:27] try and
[37:29] hope that one day God is also him
[37:33] bringing in
[37:35] amen amen this is brotherly kindness
[37:38] hoping one
[37:40] day I want to go with you to heaven amen
[37:45] that's my desire not without you with
[37:47] you amen
[37:51] hallelujah and I think this
[37:53] is when we have such a gathering very
[37:56] much important to to have patience for
[37:59] one
[38:01] another to
[38:04] T for one another sorry my English
[38:07] sometimes a little bit
[38:09] limited but we have to T to
[38:12] wait I do believe God will not lose one
[38:15] of his children not one Hallelujah not
[38:18] one
[38:20] amen amen and all I also believe that
[38:24] God has a way to bring his people in
[38:28] because the prophet said your heart will
[38:31] pull you in in your heart is by elction
[38:34] a seed a predestinated seed and this
[38:38] seed is pulling you into Christ Jesus
[38:44] Hallelujah the prophet said not by
[38:47] force forcing somebody is
[38:51] Babylon so we do not believe in forcing
[38:54] I believe in grace I believe in election
[38:57] I believe something deep in the Deep on
[39:00] inside of the inside something is
[39:02] pulling you Hallelujah to come closer to
[39:05] him to come into Christ to find your
[39:08] position Hallelujah something deep in
[39:12] the inside of your inside
[39:15] Hallelujah so we have appreciate the
[39:18] great work brother Sigma has done and I
[39:21] love him and he's a great man of God
[39:23] Amen
[39:25] Hallelujah
[39:30] you need what he did I believe it this
[39:32] is faith in action you know he has
[39:36] expressed
[39:37] something and this is for me
[39:40] also we have to appreciate very much
[39:44] what a person like he his small group
[39:47] when I say small church not to many
[39:49] people like he said this his own words
[39:51] have arranged those meetings may God
[39:53] bless them
[39:55] all
[40:03] you know myself we are
[40:06] friends and the friend will love all the
[40:08] time amen hallelujah so we have love and
[40:12] appreciate one another all the time and
[40:15] this is a friend amen blessed be the
[40:17] name of the
[40:19] Lord so um

[40:44] unique and I think we also need to have
[40:47] a greatness we should not press people

[40:55] want us to be different because he want
[40:57] to receive more than only one flower he

[41:22] Hallelujah always be a free man Hal
[41:26] Hallelujah nobody can control you God is

[41:39] hallelujah amen be sincere be honest
[41:42] love the Lord and God will bless you
[41:45] mightily Hallelujah this is very much
[41:50] important amen so we believe personal
[41:54] you know that we had a wonderful time
[41:56] and we appreciate very much brother Ed
[41:58] bisar for the great work for the
[42:02] message the when I met him the message
[42:05] the priority in his life was to bring
[42:07] the message out why because the message
[42:11] is a person the message is Christ
[42:14] himself and I do believe personal that
[42:18] we need to have the message more than
[42:20] ever before this is very much important
[42:23] for our life and what I have seen
[42:26] traveling around the earth I have really
[42:29] seen that we people are getting used to
[42:34] have the message message books are at
[42:36] the file somewhere but you know the
[42:40] message is a love letter is something
[42:43] personal is Christ speaking to his
[42:46] elected ones so we need to dig into the
[42:50] message we have to read the message more
[42:53] than ever before in our life we have to
[42:57] love the
[42:59] message and I think this is very much
[43:02] important otherwise we believe every
[43:04] Doctrine we have to know the message we
[43:08] have to take the message we have to read
[43:10] it again and again because it's Christ
[43:13] speaking to you Hallelujah this is
[43:17] important otherwise we are like from
[43:20] every wind of Doctrine wave the way this
[43:23] direction that direction Believe on God
[43:26] SP to Malachi for and you will be a
[43:30] blessed person
[43:35] Hallelujah so I appreciate the message
[43:38] read it
[43:40] again pray say God speak to me I want to
[43:45] hear your voice speak to me open your
[43:48] will to me Hallelujah and God will speak
[43:51] to you personal and you will understand
[43:55] it's something between you between you
[43:57] and Christ and no one is between it's
[44:01] uniting time it's a marriage amen
[44:05] hallelujah it's a vedding going on
[44:08] hallelujah it's a wonderful time we are
[44:10] living
[44:12] in so the message is not only paper and
[44:19] printing you have to understand for me
[44:22] personal the prophet said one sentence
[44:24] he said the word itself is Spirit in
[44:28] word form this sentence changed me
[44:32] completely I understood this message the
[44:36] word the Bible is Spirit Hallelujah in
[44:40] word form and what we need to do we have
[44:43] to enter into the spirit of the world
[44:47] Hallelujah into the spirit of the world
[44:50] into the spirit of this message amen and
[44:53] then we will have a manifestation of
[44:59] automatically because the holy spirit is
[45:02] nothing
[45:04] else then the spirit of the word the
[45:09] prophet said the spirit of the world
[45:11] will transforms the seed in its kind the
[45:15] spirit of the word not the letter will
[45:18] kill you but the spirit of the world
[45:21] will transform every seed in its kind so
[45:26] when you speak to me about Holy Spirit
[45:28] for me it is the spirit of the world
[45:31] there's only one Spirit no two Spirits
[45:34] one Spirit Hallelujah Christ the holy
[45:37] spirit is the spirit of the world
[45:40] Hallelujah and we should go from the
[45:43] written world into the living world
[45:46] Hallelujah we have to enter from the
[45:48] written world into the spirit of the
[45:50] world Hallelujah and then we have
[45:53] automatically a manifestation our life
[45:57] Hallelujah for me an alltime the message
[46:02] is very very
[46:04] precious I love it so
[46:09] much but we are we are through the
[46:11] message of Mali 4 I mean don't forget it
[46:15] in your life if God not would have sent
[46:18] a prophet where would we have been think
[46:21] about it so respect and honor always a
[46:25] message of this hour appreciate it take
[46:29] it to your heart tell the Lord speak to
[46:32] me find it in the scripture Hallelujah
[46:35] because it's a light for the Bible it's
[46:37] the evening light for our day and you
[46:40] will be positionally placed in your
[46:42] inheritance Hallelujah because we have a
[46:45] wonderful message L the
[46:52] message we should love one another love
[46:55] is
[46:56] sensitive don't hurt one
[46:59] another respect one
[47:02] another honor one
[47:04] another be good about one
[47:08] another live the right kind of
[47:11] life amen Christ is
[47:15] here he's present I feel his
[47:20] present it's very much important don't
[47:23] push the message books aside take it
[47:27] again read it again tell God cry to him
[47:31] speak to me again said I find my place
[47:34] here in the Bible said I find my
[47:37] position as a wife as a husband as a
[47:40] pastor I mean appreciate that God have
[47:43] sent the prophet Hallelujah so you
[47:45] cannot
[47:47] differ spirit and
[47:49] word
[47:51] because I am very grateful that I have
[47:56] went into the spirit of the world I went
[48:00] into the spirit of
[48:02] perfection I went to into the spirit of
[48:05] divine love I went into the spirit of
[48:09] power of
[48:10] God I know it is written but it's also
[48:13] present in spirit form so I love I love
[48:17] to speak about it I believe the message
[48:20] is a person the message is
[48:23] Christ so we have to understand it's not
[48:28] only not only the books on
[48:32] tapes but you cannot go into it without
[48:35] books and
[48:36] tapes you need to have books and
[48:39] tapes and you have to hear it again and
[48:42] again because God want to take you from
[48:45] the letter form into the spirit realon
[48:48] to manifest Supernatural things in your
[48:50] life but it starts with the books it
[48:53] starts with hearing the tapes
[48:56] and then God can move your life and
[48:58] change your life completely and you will
[49:01] be the message of our day one day and
[49:04] you will manifest it because when you
[49:06] enter into the spirit then everything
[49:09] will be changed Hallelujah Let It Be The
[49:12] Name Of The
[49:14] Lord so I love you I respect
[49:17] you there's one Spirit one God one body
[49:22] of course to be born again by water and
[49:27] spirit is also
[49:29] good because you cannot enter into the
[49:32] kingdom of God without the new birth I
[49:36] never forget that the prophet that the
[49:38] first Doctrine Jesus preached was you
[49:41] must be born again then you can
[49:45] understand the kingdom of God we are
[49:49] grateful for all the ministers who have
[49:50] preached I speak now instead of brother
[49:53] zigma I'm his friend I'm now his
[49:56] mouthpiece we have uh really enjoyed
[49:59] your presence you shared it with a
[50:01] sincere heart we respect you a lot
[50:05] everybody wanted to do the best you know
[50:08] but think about there's more there's
[50:11] more in store I mean we have also to see
[50:14] one another to listen to one another to
[50:17] learn I mean because he will reveal
[50:20] himself you know sometimes people have
[50:22] told me it's everything we need to have
[50:25] Grace I said my brother the Bible is
[50:28] telling us when we humble
[50:31] ourself when we live in a humble way
[50:35] before God God will grant us Grace after
[50:39] Grace so what we need is to have a
[50:41] humble heart I mean a humble heart to
[50:44] listen to one another to respect one
[50:46] another to respect the word of God above
[50:49] all and the message God has given amen
[50:52] and God will visit us and visit us and
[50:55] visit visit us and visit us again so all
[50:58] the ministers my appreciation for you
[51:01] for your ministry and think about
[51:03] Brother G is also one of the family of
[51:07] God is also one of the family of God may

[51:15] are very grateful for him and for his
[51:24] ministry

[1:02:27] let's stand
[1:02:31] together it's good to be in the house of
[1:02:33] the Lord this
[1:02:36] morning is anybody
[1:02:39] hungry I mean
[1:02:44] spiritually
[1:02:46] okay we're going to have church
[1:02:49] today this is here for a
[1:02:53] reason for me and for
[1:02:57] you I'm just glad to be
[1:03:00] here and today the message is going to
[1:03:02] be in two
[1:03:04] parts we're going to go into part one
[1:03:06] first so you want to open your Bibles
[1:03:10] into John chapter 8 thank you
[1:03:18] musicians get started here Luke chapter
[1:03:21] 8 I'm sorry Luke chapter 8
[1:03:26] and
[1:03:27] um look at verse
[1:03:33] one want to thank all of you for
[1:03:36] coming it wouldn't be Church Without
[1:03:41] You So Luke chapter 8 verse1 says and it
[1:03:44] came to pass afterward that he went
[1:03:46] throughout every city and Village
[1:03:49] preaching and showing the Glad Tidings
[1:03:51] of the kingdom of God and the 12 were
[1:03:54] with him
[1:03:54] him so we got a little crowd of 13
[1:03:57] people
[1:03:58] right and certain women which had been
[1:04:02] healed of evil spirits and
[1:04:05] infirmities Mary called Magdalene out of
[1:04:08] whom went Seven Devils now we got
[1:04:10] 14 and Joanna the wife of chusa Herod
[1:04:15] stward that's 15 and
[1:04:19] Susanna 16 and many
[1:04:23] others which ministered unto him of
[1:04:26] their substance so we got a little group
[1:04:28] of 20 people going from Village to
[1:04:31] Village preaching Healing The Sick
[1:04:35] cooking for the master washing the
[1:04:38] clothes there were people like
[1:04:41] you
[1:04:43] yeah just like you let's pray Heavenly
[1:04:46] Father we thank you for your Grace
[1:04:48] today we thank you Lord for all that
[1:04:50] you've done for us during this week we
[1:04:53] thank you Lord that we can be here with
[1:04:55] health we can tie our own shoes we can
[1:04:58] take care of
[1:04:59] ourselves and we have your spirit Lord
[1:05:02] that brought us in
[1:05:03] here Lord only you know the sacrifices
[1:05:06] that each one has made to be here
[1:05:08] today some have come under great
[1:05:12] difficulty some come first class some
[1:05:14] came in the back of the bus but God
[1:05:16] we're thankful that we can be here
[1:05:18] together and only you can reward the
[1:05:23] sacrifice
[1:05:24] we come here we've studied we've looked
[1:05:26] into your word and we want to do
[1:05:28] something we want to say something that
[1:05:30] would bless
[1:05:32] everyone but you know the needs so I'll
[1:05:35] step out of the way and you speak to
[1:05:37] your people help us now in Jesus name
[1:05:41] amen you may be
[1:05:46] seated now scripture records that many
[1:05:48] women follow Jesus we just got through
[1:05:51] reading some of them some of them are
[1:05:53] named and many are not
[1:05:56] named and we want to thank God that we
[1:05:58] have a Bible that has
[1:06:01] details this Bible didn't come just over
[1:06:04] the internet all of a sudden came under
[1:06:07] great
[1:06:08] difficulty and so we're also thankful
[1:06:11] that God has sent us a restoration
[1:06:15] Prophet according to the promise of the
[1:06:17] scripture to restore us back to the
[1:06:20] original
[1:06:21] Faith back to the original word
[1:06:24] and we have a sure word of God sure word
[1:06:28] of Prophecy this isn't fables this isn't
[1:06:30] just
[1:06:31] stories it's the
[1:06:34] truth now back in the New Testament they
[1:06:36] didn't have a new testament they had the
[1:06:37] Old Testament it was the Jewish religion
[1:06:40] that came around and Jesus said don't go
[1:06:41] to the Gentiles then later the door
[1:06:44] opened to us but you see in those
[1:06:49] times women did not commonly travel with
[1:06:52] a rabbi rabbi is a religious teacher now
[1:06:56] in the days of Jesus they had the temple
[1:06:58] and they had the priests and then thanks
[1:07:01] to the Romans they demolished it there's
[1:07:03] no more Temple there's no more priests
[1:07:06] there's only rabbis and they're in the
[1:07:08] synagogues which are places of
[1:07:10] learning and so these people had very
[1:07:13] strict codes that put a distance a
[1:07:16] certain distance between
[1:07:18] men uh between the women and the Jewish
[1:07:21] leaders so much so that by the time
[1:07:24] Jesus came along a rabbi was not even
[1:07:27] allowed to speak to his wife in
[1:07:29] public you know you're way over there or
[1:07:31] you're five steps behind me I know it
[1:07:34] all you shut
[1:07:35] up uh-huh it comes from way back there
[1:07:39] it's not
[1:07:41] right and so these Jewish religious laws
[1:07:44] were there to ensure moral
[1:07:47] Purity but guess what the devil's still
[1:07:50] the devil that's right there's no law is
[1:07:53] going to take care of that
[1:07:54] you see and so these Jewish men in
[1:07:57] general and teachers of the law in
[1:07:58] particular such as Jesus and the
[1:08:00] Pharisees were to have as little to do
[1:08:03] with women in public as
[1:08:05] possible then Jesus came
[1:08:08] along aren't you glad he came to your
[1:08:10] life one day and took care of all your
[1:08:12] funny
[1:08:15] ideas and not only did Jesus speak to
[1:08:18] women in public he dared to take them by
[1:08:20] the hand ooh he's supposed to be the Son
[1:08:24] of God and he's touching those
[1:08:25] women not just the nice little sisters
[1:08:28] with a long hair and the long dress and
[1:08:30] some of them had a long
[1:08:32] tongue but the
[1:08:37] prostitutes and so he spoke to these
[1:08:40] women and he encouraged them to follow
[1:08:42] the
[1:08:43] truth now I know some of you was up till
[1:08:46] 12:30 last night I heard
[1:08:48] you you know what this
[1:08:51] is this is the attention getter
[1:08:55] so if I see anybody going to
[1:08:57] sleep you're going to hear about
[1:09:00] it now you don't have to scream and jump
[1:09:02] and carry on just pay
[1:09:06] attention so there's no indication that
[1:09:10] Jesus ever discouraged women from being
[1:09:12] followers and this probably offended a
[1:09:14] lot of
[1:09:15] Jews you see and here in the 21st
[1:09:19] century when God blesses a
[1:09:22] lady such as our little sister that
[1:09:24] sang that that hair lip some of you
[1:09:27] because you didn't get to sing well
[1:09:29] guess what she's got the
[1:09:31] gift so when God blesses a lady
[1:09:34] sometimes in the 21st
[1:09:35] century
[1:09:39] oh hey
[1:09:41] relax God knows what he's
[1:09:45] doing so what we need is balance that's
[1:09:48] why this is here see the first thing I
[1:09:51] check out is the pulpit see if it's in
[1:09:52] balance
[1:09:54] just about
[1:09:56] perfect I've been to churches where the
[1:09:58] pulpit wasn't in Balance
[1:10:02] yeah and so I want you to remember
[1:10:07] that and when you get your little iPad
[1:10:09] out you can look and see what brother
[1:10:10] brand says about
[1:10:12] balance okay so balance is essential
[1:10:15] it's not an
[1:10:17] option in the New Testament you're going
[1:10:19] to find that women listen carefully to
[1:10:20] his teachings amen
[1:10:24] they accompanied him on his travels we
[1:10:26] just
[1:10:27] read women stood by him at the
[1:10:30] crucifixion Luke
[1:10:32] 24 where was the brave disciples where
[1:10:35] was the guys that cast out all the
[1:10:37] demons and and and distributed the food
[1:10:40] and all those great things where's Big
[1:10:42] Mouth Peter at that time where was he at
[1:10:44] the
[1:10:45] crucifixion hiding someplace in the
[1:10:48] shadows because it looked like it was
[1:10:49] all
[1:10:50] over women gave witness to the
[1:10:52] resurrection
[1:10:54] and they eventually helped spread the
[1:10:56] message throughout the Roman
[1:10:58] Kingdom now John chapter
[1:11:01] 4 is what you see on the screen behind
[1:11:06] me and this scene that you see back here
[1:11:09] is one that brother brandham speaks
[1:11:10] about on just about every tape that I've
[1:11:13] ever heard very few tapes he doesn't
[1:11:15] mention the woman at the
[1:11:19] well John 4:3 says
[1:11:24] he left Judea and departed again into
[1:11:26] Galilee so he's going north you get your
[1:11:29] bearings straight here and so um verse
[1:11:33] four and he must needs to go through
[1:11:34] Samaria why must he needs to go through
[1:11:36] Samaria because he had a vision that
[1:11:38] morning or maybe the night before and in
[1:11:41] this Vision he saw that he was going up
[1:11:43] a certain Road and he was going to stop
[1:11:46] at a well now this well today is under
[1:11:50] the partial roof of a Greek Orthodox
[1:11:52] Church
[1:11:54] and um it's Jacob's Well it's still
[1:11:59] there and so he had to go by that well
[1:12:03] now he had to get there at a certain
[1:12:06] time you see the vision had to be
[1:12:09] correct he couldn't get there when he
[1:12:12] pleased he couldn't get there in the
[1:12:14] early morning when it was nice and cool
[1:12:15] no he had to get there around noon 2:
[1:12:18] when it's about 40° in the shade uh-huh
[1:12:22] Celsius and so it's about 50 Mi or 50 km
[1:12:26] up to the Well from where he was
[1:12:29] at and he had to go there verse five of
[1:12:32] CH of John
[1:12:34] 4 and he cometh to the city of Samaria
[1:12:37] which is called Saar near to the parcel
[1:12:39] of ground that Jacob gave to his son
[1:12:41] Joseph now Jacob's Well was there Jesus
[1:12:44] therefore being weari of his journey sat
[1:12:47] on the well and it was about the 6th
[1:12:49] hour now we can argue from now till sun
[1:12:51] set to find out what time it is but we
[1:12:54] had a Vindicated Prophet that told us it
[1:12:56] was In the Heat of the day so we'll just
[1:12:58] leave it
[1:12:59] alone I know people that have sharpened
[1:13:02] many pencils figuring out that Jesus was
[1:13:05] born in October what a waste of time a
[1:13:08] Vindicated prophet toas he was born in
[1:13:09] April so forget
[1:13:11] it we don't have to reinvent the wheel
[1:13:13] do
[1:13:16] we so he comes to the well he's tired
[1:13:20] he's hungry now where's the disciples he
[1:13:22] said now boys
[1:13:24] it's lunchtime now you go over there at
[1:13:25] the village and you get some sandwiches
[1:13:27] and a 3 l Pepsi maybe and and come back
[1:13:31] so now he's sitting at the well and uh
[1:13:35] he's sitting there and this woman comes
[1:13:37] up now In the Heat of the days when the
[1:13:40] prostitutes came they had segregation
[1:13:43] it's okay integration has not worked out
[1:13:46] too good has it segregation you live
[1:13:49] here I'll live here everything works
[1:13:51] fine it's still that way over there
[1:13:55] so he knew all the rules he knew exactly
[1:13:58] what he was doing and this woman comes
[1:14:01] up and he says give me a drink because
[1:14:04] that was part of the
[1:14:05] vision I don't go to sleep yet this is
[1:14:08] only part
[1:14:10] one now The Honorable women came in the
[1:14:13] early morning or in the evening but the
[1:14:15] troublemakers those other kind of people
[1:14:18] They Came In the Heat of the day the
[1:14:20] disciples were in town buying the the
[1:14:22] the you know the sandwiches and in verse
[1:14:25] 99 he saith to the woman of Samaria unto
[1:14:27] him well first of all of course he asked
[1:14:29] for a drink and uh then in verse n uh
[1:14:33] she says how is it that you being a Jew
[1:14:37] ask of me a drink I'm a a Samaria the
[1:14:39] Jews have no dealings with the
[1:14:41] Samaritans had segregation
[1:14:43] okay but Jesus was one who came along to
[1:14:46] serve as the bridge he came to open a
[1:14:48] new way that they hadn't figured out yet
[1:14:51] but it was all through their Bible they
[1:14:53] just hadn't had no Revelation they knew
[1:14:55] their Bible by heart without an iPad
[1:14:57] without a computer but they had no
[1:15:00] Revelation and so he's opening up a way
[1:15:02] and everybody was you know uh able to
[1:15:06] participate and so he's there with this
[1:15:08] woman now you'll notice it looks like
[1:15:10] they're dressed very
[1:15:11] similar um but um brother brand says we
[1:15:16] have found him in 1954 Jesus Christ came
[1:15:19] here on the earth and talked to a woman
[1:15:20] at the well which was a Samaritan and
[1:15:22] him being a Jews just different in
[1:15:25] race and he let them know right quick
[1:15:27] that there was no difference in the
[1:15:28] races God was seeking those that would
[1:15:31] worship Him in spirit and in truth so
[1:15:34] they had segregation okay now verse 10
[1:15:37] says here Jesus answered and said if you
[1:15:41] knew the gift of God and who it is
[1:15:43] that's sitting here talking to you and
[1:15:45] said give me a drink you would be asking
[1:15:47] of him and he would give you living
[1:15:50] water it's first time she ever heard
[1:15:52] that phrase Living Water they didn't
[1:15:54] teach that at her
[1:15:56] church there's a lot of things you heard
[1:15:58] on tape that you never heard in the
[1:15:59] Baptist Church or the Pentecostal church
[1:16:01] or the manite or wherever you came from
[1:16:04] but it's God's word you see and so he
[1:16:06] goes on extending the conversation
[1:16:08] they're talking about the water and she
[1:16:10] says well man I'd like to have some of
[1:16:12] that you know because I'm tired of
[1:16:13] coming out here at this well and so it
[1:16:16] goes on and uh the whole time he's
[1:16:18] talking to her about the water he's
[1:16:21] Discerning her situation
[1:16:23] you
[1:16:24] see and so she responds down here in 15
[1:16:28] sir give me this water that I thirst not
[1:16:31] and either have to come out here to draw
[1:16:32] the water and then in verse 16 he goes
[1:16:35] straight to the
[1:16:37] point go call your husband and come here
[1:16:41] what's that got to do with the water
[1:16:43] well we would think nothing but he's God
[1:16:45] he knows what he's doing you see and so
[1:16:49] when we consider the the picture here on
[1:16:51] the wall we see that our
[1:16:53] sister was probably very beautiful now
[1:16:57] they the the artist did a nice job she
[1:16:59] looks very
[1:17:00] beautiful but somehow they dressed a
[1:17:04] certain way now obviously she's very
[1:17:06] well dressed I mean you don't see
[1:17:08] nothing do
[1:17:09] yet but the prostitutes had some way
[1:17:12] that they knew who they were back then
[1:17:14] today we also know who they
[1:17:16] are you've been at the mall lately
[1:17:18] you've been down down the streets you
[1:17:21] know studart any of these streets my
[1:17:24] city they're everywhere now the sad part
[1:17:27] is friends of mine that we have mothers
[1:17:30] that carry message
[1:17:32] books they let their girls go out
[1:17:34] looking like
[1:17:35] prostitutes that's really
[1:17:38] sad I'd like to think that some of you
[1:17:40] don't have mirrors at your
[1:17:42] house why would you go out in the street
[1:17:44] looking like that if you had a mirror at
[1:17:46] your
[1:17:48] house yeah somebody be sitting
[1:17:52] here
[1:17:54] amen you
[1:17:56] see I was early this morning thinking
[1:17:58] well Lord everything's been said what am
[1:18:00] I going to say here and he reminded me
[1:18:02] there's some things haven't been said oh
[1:18:04] yes now Christian girls do not go around
[1:18:07] showing the shape of their beautiful
[1:18:10] body they save that mystery for their
[1:18:14] husband so Christian girls don't show
[1:18:16] off their
[1:18:18] body I was at a camp not too long ago
[1:18:20] and I was I was speaking to the to the 1
[1:18:23] and under crowd and there's a little
[1:18:25] girl back there about 13 and she had her
[1:18:27] legs crossed in a certain way hey hey
[1:18:29] you put put your dress down her mother
[1:18:32] must have never told her
[1:18:33] that well she knows now Christian girls
[1:18:38] don't show off the shape of their body
[1:18:40] that's advertising and when you
[1:18:42] advertised you're going to get the wrong
[1:18:45] kind of
[1:18:47] guys if you're unmarried wait for the
[1:18:50] guy to come knocking at your door you
[1:18:52] don't have to go out looking for him
[1:18:54] that's not the way it
[1:18:59] works
[1:19:03] now I'm going to say this one time and
[1:19:05] if you don't understand it we'll have a
[1:19:07] session outside with
[1:19:09] you Christian girls don't wear their
[1:19:12] purse across their
[1:19:14] chest if you don't understand your
[1:19:16] mother doesn't understand I'll meet you
[1:19:19] outside now so this woman here she was a
[1:19:23] stitute and uh she was very beautiful
[1:19:26] she had no trouble attracting men but
[1:19:30] her problem was keeping the
[1:19:32] man she was thirsting for something and
[1:19:35] she didn't know how to satisfy that
[1:19:37] Godly thirst you see nothing else will
[1:19:40] satisfy only Jesus
[1:19:43] Christ and so she had had she had had
[1:19:46] five husbands man can you imagine now we
[1:19:49] don't know what happened to them maybe
[1:19:50] they died maybe they moved off to Syria
[1:19:53] who knows what they did but she just got
[1:19:55] this other guy the night before and she
[1:19:57] wasn't too sure about
[1:19:58] him that's on tape also you know I've
[1:20:02] been around a few years I've been
[1:20:03] listening to this tape
[1:20:05] also can anybody tell
[1:20:08] me when brother Brandon went to Houston
[1:20:11] and they took the picture we're going to
[1:20:12] get into that in a few
[1:20:13] minutes the man that examined the
[1:20:16] picture was named George J Lacy
[1:20:19] right does anybody know what color hair
[1:20:22] he had
[1:20:25] what it's red hair now you
[1:20:28] know not important but you know I've
[1:20:31] been listening
[1:20:32] too so anyway she got this guy the night
[1:20:35] before she wasn't too sure about him
[1:20:36] verse 17 H the woman answered I have no
[1:20:39] husband well she thought she'll get this
[1:20:41] guy you know and he said that's the
[1:20:43] truth that you have no husband because
[1:20:46] you had five and the guy you got last
[1:20:48] night is not your husband you told the
[1:20:51] truth and at that point she knew she was
[1:20:55] cornered she was
[1:20:57] trapped she said sir I believe that you
[1:21:00] are a
[1:21:02] prophet
[1:21:06] now the fact
[1:21:08] is that um you know from there she went
[1:21:10] on to declare her you know belief and
[1:21:13] all the differences you know when he
[1:21:15] spoke to her telling her these things of
[1:21:17] her past and all these details she
[1:21:20] probably got
[1:21:21] uncomfortable I couldn't tell you how
[1:21:23] many people have told me Bo I wish I
[1:21:25] knew William brandom would you like to
[1:21:28] stand there and have him tell you all
[1:21:29] you did last week and what you when you
[1:21:31] cheated that guy over there and would
[1:21:33] you like that it's not real
[1:21:36] comfortable you don't want somebody
[1:21:37] looking through you but but Jesus could
[1:21:40] look right through her told her all
[1:21:42] these details and she got uncomfortable
[1:21:44] and she immediately went on the
[1:21:46] defense of her ideas of race and
[1:21:48] religion because the Samaritans were
[1:21:51] experts on Def fence because right
[1:21:54] nearby where they're sitting now over
[1:21:56] there where the where the Jacob's Well
[1:21:57] is there's not quite that many mountains
[1:21:59] but there's some hills and nearby where
[1:22:01] they were where they were sitting is
[1:22:03] Mount ebal and that's where Moses
[1:22:06] commanded the people now when you all
[1:22:07] get into the land over on that mount
[1:22:09] ebal that's where you're going to put up
[1:22:10] a a um what do you call it a um Altar
[1:22:14] and um uh that's where you going to you
[1:22:17] know sacrifice it was also on Mount ebal
[1:22:20] in Joshua 8 where Joshua renewed The
[1:22:23] Covenant but the Samaritans had a little
[1:22:26] bit different idea they were just a few
[1:22:29] degrees off you know not entirely wrong
[1:22:32] just a few
[1:22:34] degrees and they thought that the other
[1:22:36] hill mount gasim would be the better
[1:22:38] place to worship so they built an altar
[1:22:40] there in 400
[1:22:42] BC but 272 years later the Jews destroy
[1:22:46] that altar adding to the enmity between
[1:22:49] the two groups okay and so the woman at
[1:22:52] the well had plenty of ammunition and
[1:22:54] she didn't mind using it on
[1:22:56] Jesus but he calmed her down in verse 21
[1:22:59] woman believe me the hour comes when you
[1:23:02] shall neither in this mountain nor in
[1:23:03] Jerusalem worship the father you guys
[1:23:06] worship what you don't know we worship
[1:23:09] uh what we know for salvation is of the
[1:23:11] Jews but the hour cometh and now is when
[1:23:14] the true worshippers shall worship the
[1:23:17] father in spirit and in truth perfectly
[1:23:20] balanced right
[1:23:23] for the father seeketh such to worship
[1:23:25] him God is a spirit and they that
[1:23:28] worship Him must worship Him and spirit
[1:23:30] and in
[1:23:32] truth you can have a lots of spirit you
[1:23:35] know the drums are beating the guitars
[1:23:37] are flying and lots of spirit no truth
[1:23:41] or you can have all
[1:23:43] truth and be dead as a door Nowell it's
[1:23:46] got to be
[1:23:49] balanced
[1:23:51] Okay so
[1:23:54] and the woman said I know the Messiah is
[1:23:56] coming how did she know the Messiah was
[1:23:57] coming because when she was a small girl
[1:24:01] they didn't have Sunday school that
[1:24:02] wasn't in Advent until 1750 in the
[1:24:04] Methodist Church but they had uh a Bible
[1:24:07] class and they still have it over there
[1:24:10] where that the kids learn what the Bible
[1:24:13] says the Old Testament fine Bible's
[1:24:16] Bible so they learn and so she had paid
[1:24:20] attention in church she had paid
[1:24:22] attention to what was being said and so
[1:24:25] she knew the Messiah was coming says
[1:24:28] here and he'll be called the Christ and
[1:24:31] when he comes he will tell us all things
[1:24:34] huh she knew that it was in her head you
[1:24:37] see she had paid
[1:24:38] attention and Jesus said I that speak
[1:24:42] unto thee am he see that's what he's
[1:24:44] saying right there I that speak unto
[1:24:46] thee am
[1:24:48] he remember that
[1:24:51] picture and so she paid attention there
[1:24:54] was truth lodged in her memory and she
[1:24:57] had been on this detour a long time we
[1:24:59] don't know why how long she was on The
[1:25:01] Detour as a prostitute but it wasn't the
[1:25:04] it wasn't an unpardonable sin you know
[1:25:07] it happened but now she's back here
[1:25:09] facing Jesus Christ and all she needed
[1:25:13] was an encounter with the Fountain of
[1:25:15] Truth she had a correct spirit I mean
[1:25:17] look look at the painting she had a
[1:25:19] correct Spirit you know she didn't
[1:25:21] reject the truth she knew he was telling
[1:25:24] her the
[1:25:25] truth her spirit was right she just
[1:25:27] needed more truth just like you you had
[1:25:30] a right spirit in the Catholic church or
[1:25:32] wherever you were you you thought you
[1:25:34] were worshiping God you needed more
[1:25:37] truth wow look look what look it says
[1:25:39] here in Malachi oh wow the Bible's real
[1:25:43] and here you are today you know so she
[1:25:48] had representation in heaven she was in
[1:25:50] the elect seat of God
[1:25:53] and once she got one drink of that
[1:25:56] special water it was all
[1:25:59] over he didn't say go read the church
[1:26:01] age book he didn't say go listen to 17
[1:26:03] tapes one drink of
[1:26:06] water prophet of God says just take one
[1:26:10] drink from there you'll never have to
[1:26:12] hear another sermon on morals how to
[1:26:14] dress how to act how to conduct
[1:26:18] yourself
[1:26:21] amen
[1:26:23] [Music]
[1:26:25] but you have to take a
[1:26:27] drink you have to be responsible for
[1:26:29] what you're hearing can't just go over
[1:26:32] and you know you don't you don't get the
[1:26:34] the uh the gospel by osmosis laying on
[1:26:37] your Bible you have to read it you have
[1:26:39] to
[1:26:41] partake you can go through the grocery
[1:26:43] store and look at all the labels oh yeah
[1:26:46] if we put this with this we get the
[1:26:48] chocolate cake and then we could put the
[1:26:50] cherries and you can read all that
[1:26:53] and you can die in the aisle of the
[1:26:55] grocery store because you didn't
[1:26:58] partake you must partake your parents
[1:27:02] brought you here they sent you here they
[1:27:04] spent money take advantage of what's
[1:27:06] going on you
[1:27:09] see but many people don't participate
[1:27:12] they don't take the responsibility and
[1:27:14] manifest what they're hearing you see
[1:27:18] and you see what it is your life speaks
[1:27:20] much louder than your words we've got
[1:27:23] all kinds of people in all the languages
[1:27:25] that can quote and brother brandham said
[1:27:27] who cares your neighbor doesn't care
[1:27:29] what brother brandham said they're
[1:27:31] watching your life they're watching how
[1:27:33] you're going through this
[1:27:37] crisis now not too far from where we're
[1:27:39] sitting down south a little
[1:27:42] farther there was a man 900 years ago by
[1:27:45] the name of Francis of aiss you ever
[1:27:47] hear of
[1:27:48] him yeah that man in Rome took that name
[1:27:51] now that man in Rome does anybody know
[1:27:55] what his mother called him when he was
[1:27:58] born this is pitiful she called him
[1:28:02] George yeah that was his name but then
[1:28:05] when he comes to Rome puts on the white
[1:28:08] oh I'm important now then he takes on
[1:28:10] the name of Francis of AIS to be nice
[1:28:14] but behind him it's not nice so anyway
[1:28:18] Francis 900 years ago said amongst other
[1:28:21] things and brother random said he was a
[1:28:23] gospel preacher so
[1:28:27] relax Francis said preach
[1:28:30] always use words when
[1:28:34] necessary yeah brother brandham came
[1:28:35] along and repeated the same thing he
[1:28:37] says live your
[1:28:39] message so all your neighbors and the
[1:28:42] people you work with they're watching
[1:28:45] they're
[1:28:46] watching they don't care what you say
[1:28:48] they're watching so be
[1:28:51] careful
[1:28:54] so after she participated in this
[1:28:56] conversation she understood and the
[1:28:59] woman at the well was turned instantly
[1:29:01] into a lady a lady with something to
[1:29:04] tell and she took one drink of the
[1:29:07] inexhaustible Fountain of Living
[1:29:10] Water so now she was the woman at the
[1:29:14] well now she's the lady with the
[1:29:17] word
[1:29:20] amen
[1:29:24] so she came in contact with the author
[1:29:26] of life and changed her
[1:29:30] life now we'll go to part
[1:29:34] two Acts chapter
[1:29:38] 1 this will be a message you won't
[1:29:40] forget today or for a long time Acts
[1:29:42] chapter 1 and verse 6
[1:29:44] says when therefore they were come
[1:29:47] together they asked of him saying
[1:29:49] Lord you got to get the picture this is
[1:29:53] a group of people speaking to the
[1:29:55] resurrected Lord Jesus Christ they've
[1:29:58] already SE him they've seen him walk
[1:30:00] through the wall like no doors come
[1:30:02] right through the wall over there
[1:30:03] they've seen him produce cooked fish
[1:30:06] they've seen all kinds of
[1:30:10] evidences and um they asked him this
[1:30:13] this is their big question now they
[1:30:14] don't know he's within 5 minutes he's
[1:30:16] going to blast off but they're speaking
[1:30:18] to an a resurrected Lord and this is
[1:30:21] their biggest question
[1:30:22] Lord will thou at this time restore
[1:30:24] again the Kingdom of Israel that's a
[1:30:26] political question what stupid you
[1:30:29] know he said it's not for you guys to
[1:30:32] know in other words we would say none of
[1:30:33] your business right it's not for you to
[1:30:35] know the times or the seasons which the
[1:30:37] father hath put in his own power but ye
[1:30:41] shall receive power after that the Holy
[1:30:43] Ghost has come upon you and you should
[1:30:45] be W shall be Witnesses unto me both in
[1:30:47] Jerusalem over there in Judea over in
[1:30:50] Samaria all the way to Germany bellarus
[1:30:53] North Carolina
[1:30:55] Australia ends of the Earth it's going
[1:30:58] to go now they might have thought wow
[1:31:00] we're going to travel they didn't know
[1:31:02] nothing about travel you know but the
[1:31:05] fact is he told them that they're going
[1:31:07] to do this now um it says in verse 9 and
[1:31:12] when they had when he had spoken these
[1:31:14] things while they were beheld he was
[1:31:16] taken up and a cloud received him out of
[1:31:18] their sight now in First Corinthians you
[1:31:20] can find out where that it says that
[1:31:22] about 500 people saw him you know there
[1:31:26] at the end and he's telling them to go
[1:31:28] to Jerusalem and wait for the Holy Ghost
[1:31:31] well guess what only 24% of that crowd
[1:31:33] made it to the upper room 76% was the
[1:31:37] make believer and the unbeliever ah it's
[1:31:40] not important we'll do it when we please
[1:31:43] but
[1:31:45] anyway that's the basis of Our Testimony
[1:31:48] today I am a witness of something that
[1:31:51] you you didn't see and I was invited
[1:31:54] here to give witness to something that I
[1:31:57] saw that's my story now I'm not an
[1:31:59] Entertainer I'm only trying to be a
[1:32:01] faithful witness you see now I'm glad to
[1:32:04] be in Germany once again I've been here
[1:32:06] before this is the land of the messenger
[1:32:09] to the fifth age remember Sardis
[1:32:12] Revelation 3:1 he was a reformer his
[1:32:15] name was Martin Luther this was his
[1:32:17] country he spoke the same language and
[1:32:19] the Bible he translated the one you're
[1:32:20] using today he did a good job I want to
[1:32:23] see him one day he's a good friend of
[1:32:25] mine I read his letters I read his
[1:32:27] stuff in one of his letters he says a
[1:32:29] translator needs a lot of words to reach
[1:32:32] back and grab
[1:32:34] from and just for you guys and of course
[1:32:36] everybody here knows at least two or
[1:32:37] three languages some of the Americans
[1:32:40] don't shame
[1:32:41] shame
[1:32:44] but there's no such thing as word for
[1:32:46] word
[1:32:47] translation we translate the phrase and
[1:32:50] Martin Luther would tell you that and so
[1:32:53] we have that Bible today now this is
[1:32:56] where he comes from by God's grace I've
[1:32:58] also been to the tomb of brother Paul
[1:33:00] over in London God's Messenger to the
[1:33:03] first age I've been to the tomb also of
[1:33:06] um of course the empty tomb in Jerusalem
[1:33:09] it's there we'll talk about that a
[1:33:11] little
[1:33:12] later um and um for a period of time I
[1:33:16] was the caretaker of the grave site of
[1:33:17] William brandham when I lived there I I
[1:33:20] cut the grass and you know trimmed it up
[1:33:22] that was my job for a while but in our
[1:33:26] scripture we don't see anything about an
[1:33:28] attorney it only says
[1:33:32] witness Jesus Christ is the only
[1:33:34] righteous one he's our attorney it
[1:33:36] doesn't say anything about
[1:33:38] Judge because nobody
[1:33:41] qualifies but in the 21st century where
[1:33:43] we are so
[1:33:45] smart we have
[1:33:48] smartphone you see and uh this gets you
[1:33:52] in trouble
[1:33:53] sometimes and so what happens is that um
[1:33:58] we hear the neighbor talking on the
[1:34:00] phone of course we're only hearing one
[1:34:02] side of the conversation right we don't
[1:34:03] know what who she's talking to we don't
[1:34:05] know what the other guy said we only
[1:34:06] hear half of the
[1:34:08] conversation then because we are so
[1:34:10] smart in the 21st century we uh fill in
[1:34:14] the blanks make up the rest of the case
[1:34:17] and we judge the case not even knowing
[1:34:19] half of the story that happens to
[1:34:23] Christians so nobody qualifies as a
[1:34:26] judge and we trust that somebody can
[1:34:28] learn something from these uh things
[1:34:31] we're going to
[1:34:32] say and possibly avoid some of the
[1:34:35] pitfalls of life I'm the eagle that was
[1:34:38] born in the Baptist chicken yard
[1:34:41] yeah very few people were born in the
[1:34:44] message home and learn to have the
[1:34:47] family Altar and and do everything right
[1:34:50] a lot of us were born somewhere El else
[1:34:52] you see and so um uh we trust that you
[1:34:57] can see who you are see how God is
[1:34:59] dealing with you so we'll try to get
[1:35:01] through this before lunch I promise
[1:35:04] we'll be out by
[1:35:05] lunchtime it's
[1:35:08] okay my parents were uh both Americans
[1:35:13] they met in Bible School in California
[1:35:16] and they were married in June of
[1:35:19] 1944 long time ago
[1:35:22] and so they had this idea that you know
[1:35:24] they they felt that God is calling them
[1:35:26] to be missionaries in Mexico because
[1:35:29] back
[1:35:30] then uh there were still and of course
[1:35:32] even today but but more so then see you
[1:35:35] see in our world today there's over
[1:35:36] 6,000 languages that are
[1:35:38] spoken and there's languages today that
[1:35:41] still have nothing written down hey wake
[1:35:44] up get
[1:35:48] this and so they looked on the map they
[1:35:52] had the the the stuff and they said well
[1:35:53] there's this there's this tribe down
[1:35:55] here in Mexico that has nothing written
[1:35:57] especially no Bible so they said well I
[1:36:00] think that's where God's leading us now
[1:36:01] they didn't know word word of Spanish
[1:36:03] they were young married people so they
[1:36:05] go down and they took the truck as far
[1:36:07] as it would go then they got on horses
[1:36:09] and they went four days up in the
[1:36:11] mountains to find this
[1:36:13] tribe okay and so they're up there and
[1:36:16] they found the tribe and they they have
[1:36:18] nothing written they have to you know
[1:36:20] point to the sky and uh believe that
[1:36:23] these people are telling them sky in
[1:36:24] their language and try to write it down
[1:36:26] whatever it sounds like that's where you
[1:36:28] start very
[1:36:30] Elementary and so as happens in
[1:36:34] newlyweds homes a baby's going to be
[1:36:36] born so they come out on the horseback
[1:36:38] come back to the truck well instead of
[1:36:40] going to Arizona they got on the train
[1:36:43] and went to Mexico City and that's where
[1:36:45] their first child was born in late
[1:36:47] August of
[1:36:49] 1945 that was me
[1:36:53] yeah okay so we come back to the
[1:36:55] mountains and uh I don't know he we were
[1:36:58] probably there two or three years but my
[1:37:00] dad was not a patient man see he he was
[1:37:02] a little bit impatient so to get this
[1:37:05] language you know to get you got to form
[1:37:06] a dictionary first you could to have a
[1:37:08] dictionary a b c that could take some
[1:37:11] time and then eventually you come over
[1:37:13] here and you can produce St John in that
[1:37:16] language that takes 20 years well I'm an
[1:37:20] eyewitness that he wasn't that of a man
[1:37:22] so he left that blessing for somebody
[1:37:24] else and he moved over to the East Coast
[1:37:27] of Mexico and founded a bible school
[1:37:29] which is still there today I was just
[1:37:31] down there last month and saw
[1:37:33] it so now we're over on the east coast
[1:37:37] of Mexico and it's time to go into the
[1:37:39] first grade well I'm the only white guy
[1:37:42] and all these Mexican kids and I don't
[1:37:44] know what their mother told them at home
[1:37:45] you know they went home say hey there's
[1:37:47] this this white guy in our class today
[1:37:49] well you see back then we did didn't
[1:37:51] have pencil sharpeners I know it sounds
[1:37:53] like stone age but we didn't have pencil
[1:37:54] sharpener all the kids carried a
[1:37:56] single-edged razor blade see they put
[1:37:59] you in jail today for that in my country
[1:38:01] and so we carried a single-edged razor
[1:38:03] blade and so when I wasn't looking this
[1:38:05] kid got a real sharp point on his pencil
[1:38:08] and he jabbed me in the arm and then
[1:38:10] when he saw I had red blood then we
[1:38:12] could be
[1:38:14] friends okay so that was in the first
[1:38:17] grade now trying to keep this in order
[1:38:21] um
[1:38:21] eventually I was I was the first but
[1:38:24] eventually there was four more brothers
[1:38:26] and Five Sisters I was the first of
[1:38:28] 10 yeah and
[1:38:31] um we had a lady that helped us in the
[1:38:33] house and we were only permitted to
[1:38:35] speak Spanish to her the rest of the
[1:38:37] Spanish would be outside and we did not
[1:38:40] know the word discrimination that's from
[1:38:42] the 20th century okay came later but my
[1:38:45] mother had this thing about her you you
[1:38:47] speak Spanish to the Mexican people and
[1:38:50] you speak English to the english-
[1:38:51] speaking people keep the languages
[1:38:53] separate they came pretty handy later
[1:38:57] and such was the
[1:38:58] rule that um I remember one time we had
[1:39:01] a visitor this uh American
[1:39:06] missionary and he spoke perfect Spanish
[1:39:09] he learned it you know as an adult spoke
[1:39:11] perfect Spanish but he was a white guy
[1:39:13] we wouldn't speak Spanish to him only
[1:39:15] English to him that was her rules you
[1:39:17] know and so we kept the languages
[1:39:20] separate and I'm sure those of you that
[1:39:22] know two or three languages you know
[1:39:23] that you have to keep them separate well
[1:39:25] anyway um we come to um
[1:39:29] 1955 Easter of of 55 I was 9 years old
[1:39:33] now I had been on the front row every
[1:39:35] service you know I was raised in the
[1:39:38] Baptist Church and so the missionaries
[1:39:41] kids were always right there on the
[1:39:42] front row uh every service three times a
[1:39:44] week or more but finally when I was
[1:39:47] about 9 years old I realized that Romans
[1:39:50] 3 was for me also wasn't just for all
[1:39:53] those Sinners it was for me
[1:39:55] too all have sinned the Spencer kids the
[1:40:00] Bisal kids the brandom kids all have
[1:40:02] sinned Smith kids and come short of the
[1:40:05] glory of God whosoever shall call upon
[1:40:08] the name of the Lord and be shall be
[1:40:09] saved so I received Jesus Christ my
[1:40:11] savior 9 years old I was baptized on
[1:40:14] Easter Sunday 1955 in the same as a lot
[1:40:17] of you in the name of the Father the Son
[1:40:21] [Music]
[1:40:27] okay
[1:40:29] so when I finished the elementary school
[1:40:32] in Spanish that was all Spanish
[1:40:34] Elementary and at home our mom would
[1:40:35] teach us you know to read and write and
[1:40:37] a little bit of English but then when I
[1:40:40] was 13 years old there was you know
[1:40:43] several kids at home well they sent me
[1:40:45] off to Houston to live with the with a
[1:40:46] Baptist family and go to to seventh
[1:40:49] grade and so I'm over there with these
[1:40:51] people and um everything's new and wow
[1:40:55] all English and they got a cafeteria and
[1:40:57] it's clean wow this is nice you know and
[1:41:01] so there were several moves but
[1:41:03] eventually
[1:41:05] um in uh let's see in January of 62 as a
[1:41:09] teenager I had a reconsecration it's one
[1:41:12] thing when you're a child but then when
[1:41:14] you get to understand things better then
[1:41:15] you have a closer Encounter With Jesus
[1:41:17] Christ becomes more real you see and so
[1:41:20] then halfway through the 10th grade they
[1:41:22] sent me to live with my grandfather in
[1:41:24] Tucson
[1:41:25] Arizona yeah my mother was from Tucson
[1:41:27] that's where she was born that's where
[1:41:28] she died and so uh they sent me to live
[1:41:31] with my grandfather to go into the last
[1:41:34] two and a half years of high school well
[1:41:37] being in
[1:41:38] Tucson uh then my family moved there
[1:41:40] also so we we had a house there and um
[1:41:45] uh I was the guy in high school that had
[1:41:47] the
[1:41:48] reputation we're talking about a a
[1:41:51] school of about 2 200 kids you know and
[1:41:54] I was the guy that didn't go to the
[1:41:55] parties I didn't drink didn't smoke and
[1:41:58] at lunch um instead of talking to these
[1:42:01] these other kids I would talk to the
[1:42:02] Mormon kids because the Mormon guys they
[1:42:03] they had a little more on the ball you
[1:42:05] know they they talk Bible so we would
[1:42:07] talk and um so one day this one girl
[1:42:11] comes up you know at the end of school
[1:42:14] and she says you know we noticed that
[1:42:16] you're so
[1:42:17] picky I suppose there's a word for that
[1:42:19] for you guys back there but picky means
[1:42:21] very
[1:42:23] precise and so um she said but we know
[1:42:26] exactly the girl for you oh
[1:42:29] really yeah where is she well she's way
[1:42:32] over there getting on the bus well the
[1:42:34] next day they introduced me to the most
[1:42:37] beautiful lady on the
[1:42:39] planet Rebecca
[1:42:45] Branham and
[1:42:47] so I met her and you know she's
[1:42:50] beautiful and of course just like you
[1:42:53] guys hey I was young one time
[1:42:56] everybody's not here to to be holy you
[1:42:58] know some of you guys are looking for a
[1:42:59] wife I don't know what you're looking
[1:43:00] for and some of you girls you
[1:43:04] wonder and so um and so the first
[1:43:07] question is what's your name and then
[1:43:10] you want to know kind of how old she is
[1:43:12] cu if she's a little older well you know
[1:43:13] Adam was a little older than Eve so that
[1:43:15] doesn't work real good and so um we uh
[1:43:18] you have to ask her age and well it
[1:43:20] comes out that her father's a
[1:43:22] preacher okay I knew a lot of preachers
[1:43:24] no big deal and it turns out that that
[1:43:28] God moved these people from way back
[1:43:29] East with a funny accent right there
[1:43:32] about a block from my house wow you talk
[1:43:35] about
[1:43:36] predestination make a Believer out of
[1:43:39] you and so so I had to go talk to her
[1:43:42] dad that was the first step okay got to
[1:43:45] talk to Dad no problem so I go talk to
[1:43:48] her dad after school and here's this man
[1:43:51] in the backyard working with the flowers
[1:43:54] or something no shirt on I wasn't
[1:43:56] offended hey we're talking Arizona you
[1:43:59] know it's hot out there and so um and so
[1:44:02] and she
[1:44:04] disappeared Dad this is George you know
[1:44:06] so she disappears and uh here I'm
[1:44:09] talking to this man never seen him hey I
[1:44:12] was a Baptist not everybody in America
[1:44:14] heard the name brandom okay most of them
[1:44:16] didn't hear it especially if he wasn't
[1:44:18] in the Pentecostal church so
[1:44:21] um uh we're talking a few minutes and
[1:44:25] I'm expressing to him that you know I
[1:44:27] like your daughter and I like to know
[1:44:28] we're a little better and and he's
[1:44:30] checking me out you know and we're
[1:44:32] talking and so he gives me permission
[1:44:36] that I can know her a little better well
[1:44:37] I'm in high school with her you know we
[1:44:38] ride the same bus and everything well at
[1:44:41] that point I had the
[1:44:43] victory but he had the problem because
[1:44:46] there were some other guys that knew who
[1:44:48] he was and they were scared to come over
[1:44:51] you know they had nice car nice clothes
[1:44:55] you know but they knew who he was so
[1:44:57] they were I don't know what they were
[1:44:59] waiting for but they lost
[1:45:01] out and so he says sure you can you can
[1:45:04] get to nowh and so we um uh you know we
[1:45:09] had the victory okay
[1:45:12] now at first I knew she had an older
[1:45:15] brother I thought man this might be a
[1:45:17] problem now that's another question you
[1:45:18] guys need to ask you know got an older
[1:45:20] brother
[1:45:21] but the older brother was 10 years older
[1:45:23] than me and he was a skinny kid like me
[1:45:24] so it wasn't a problem but he had a real
[1:45:27] nice a real nice brand new red Chevrolet
[1:45:30] two door oh it was
[1:45:33] nice and I had a used Ford
[1:45:36] truck but the man had a Ford station
[1:45:39] wagon so it was okay you see and um so
[1:45:44] anyway we we got along and the fact is
[1:45:47] that when when the when the family moved
[1:45:50] from Jeffersonville which we'll get into
[1:45:52] that in a few minutes because there's no
[1:45:53] hurry um they moved by Vision he didn't
[1:45:57] take a vote at the church they didn't
[1:45:59] know how long they're going to be gone
[1:46:00] so here they've been in this same house
[1:46:02] from 1948 to
[1:46:04] 1962 and you know the schools right down
[1:46:07] there and the churches over there the
[1:46:08] piano teachers over here everything was
[1:46:10] you know reasonably
[1:46:12] normal and all of a sudden in the middle
[1:46:14] of the 11th grade pick up your stuff and
[1:46:17] go
[1:46:18] west well when they go west there's no
[1:46:21] church there's no friends there's no
[1:46:24] trees and there's no
[1:46:26] piano cuz Rebecca was playing the piano
[1:46:29] every day and so they get out there and
[1:46:32] uh didn't take her very long to figure
[1:46:34] out that the lady you know people on the
[1:46:36] corner had a grand piano cuz she was a
[1:46:38] piano teacher and and that's the girl
[1:46:40] that actually introduced us so uh one
[1:46:43] day brother Brandon was getting his
[1:46:44] family together to go to
[1:46:46] supper and he's only got three kids you
[1:46:49] know so he looks in the back of the St
[1:46:50] St wagon there's only two children Hey
[1:46:51] where's Rebecca well she's down at the
[1:46:53] corner we'll pick her up on the way by
[1:46:55] so brother ROM stops the car at the
[1:46:57] corner and as he's going up to the up to
[1:47:00] the house you know up to knock on the
[1:47:02] door he hears this music it's not chopan
[1:47:06] it's not
[1:47:07] Beethoven it's not down at the
[1:47:12] cross you know 20 fingers on one piano
[1:47:16] you know Rebecca liked the bass and the
[1:47:18] other girl was up at the top so all
[1:47:20] these and just noise you know and so oh
[1:47:22] his heart's breaking oh my little girl
[1:47:25] and he tells about it on tape how that
[1:47:27] this music H just horrible and so he
[1:47:32] knocks on the door and they miraculously
[1:47:35] heard so she comes to the door now he
[1:47:38] didn't jerk his belt off like we might
[1:47:40] he didn't scream at her he just said
[1:47:43] it's time to go okay we go she didn't
[1:47:47] hear another word about that for two
[1:47:49] months
[1:47:51] that's the way he did
[1:47:53] things and so they were praying the
[1:47:55] parents were praying and so when he
[1:47:57] tells the story about this on tape he
[1:47:59] tells all about the music and everything
[1:48:01] he says and then she met George and he's
[1:48:03] a Christian it was the end of the
[1:48:05] problem
[1:48:06] really what was I doing I was taking her
[1:48:09] to the Baptist church every Sunday he
[1:48:11] was thankful that I would take her to
[1:48:13] the Baptist Church he came a couple of
[1:48:15] times or more said amen to the word you
[1:48:18] see so
[1:48:21] and so we
[1:48:23] um we met it was probably somewhere in
[1:48:27] March and in early June um I went to the
[1:48:31] first meeting now when I met him he
[1:48:34] didn't he didn't give me a stack of
[1:48:37] tapes when we were talking the first
[1:48:39] time he realized because I I think I he
[1:48:42] asked me or somehow he found out he knew
[1:48:45] that I'd already read my Bible all the
[1:48:46] way
[1:48:48] through twice you can do it starting
[1:48:51] today and by next August you've read it
[1:48:53] all the way through also it works you
[1:48:56] have to get into the book to know what
[1:48:57] it's all about like brother guard
[1:48:59] said and so I'd read my Bible and so
[1:49:03] here I'm at the first
[1:49:04] meeting and I uh I'm I'm seeing him
[1:49:07] preach and I'm seeing the discernment
[1:49:09] wow this is different we don't do this
[1:49:10] in the Baptist Church and um so I went
[1:49:13] home that
[1:49:14] evening and I was only you know like a
[1:49:16] block block and a half away from where
[1:49:18] they they lived and I said said oh Lord
[1:49:21] this either comes directly from you or
[1:49:23] it's the greatest deception that ever
[1:49:25] hit the
[1:49:26] earth so God revealed to me you know
[1:49:28] slowly it's the truth you know so
[1:49:31] brother random traveled a lot he was
[1:49:33] gone preaching a lot and um uh but when
[1:49:36] he was at home we could spend some time
[1:49:38] together he could explain a few things I
[1:49:40] didn't record any of it you know he
[1:49:42] would take time to explain he was a real
[1:49:44] friend and he always enjoyed talking
[1:49:46] about the scriptures you see and I was
[1:49:49] always welcome at the their house so I
[1:49:51] didn't come into the message or learn of
[1:49:54] the message sitting out there watching
[1:49:55] him preach I could come in the back door
[1:49:58] I had to knock you know but I I was
[1:49:59] welcome and they always had a lot of
[1:50:01] good orange juice in the refrigerator
[1:50:03] remember that
[1:50:05] yeah so you might say well what
[1:50:07] attracted you to this
[1:50:08] ministry
[1:50:10] well God used the girl as the bait you
[1:50:13] know but what attracted me was here's a
[1:50:17] man that's actually living the spirit of
[1:50:19] the scripture
[1:50:21] I knew the scriptures because I had read
[1:50:22] the scriptures I of course I didn't stop
[1:50:24] and analyze at all like we do now but I
[1:50:27] had read through it and I I caught the
[1:50:29] spirit of the scripture and here's a man
[1:50:31] that's living it and his ministry
[1:50:33] showing it you know and so it all
[1:50:35] started all the pieces started to fit
[1:50:37] together and um but it was always two
[1:50:40] different things there was a
[1:50:40] relationship with Rebecca and one with
[1:50:42] her dad so he was living you know and um
[1:50:48] of course he says you must read your
[1:50:51] Bible and pray but see that a lot of
[1:50:53] people don't like that they they want to
[1:50:55] they want to put on Scorpion and listen
[1:50:57] to it and fall asleep no read your
[1:51:00] Bible you know we all have a Bible at
[1:51:03] home read your Bible now before we go
[1:51:06] too much farther I want to go into what
[1:51:08] I call the prophetic Dimension now you
[1:51:10] might not like that word no it's not on
[1:51:13] tape neither is computer uh
[1:51:17] smartphone Facebook a lot of words we
[1:51:19] use on tape okay but we're in the 21st
[1:51:22] century and this is what I call the
[1:51:23] prophetic Dimension and that is that the
[1:51:26] prophet speaks from
[1:51:28] eternity brother Bram says he spent more
[1:51:30] time in this other dimension than he did
[1:51:32] in this one and he goes back and forth
[1:51:36] you see and so for example we have
[1:51:40] Elisha uh and Gesa they're in their
[1:51:43] little house there one day and uh they
[1:51:45] got problems and and Elisha says now son
[1:51:49] go out there and see what's going on
[1:51:50] outside so Gesa goes and looks out there
[1:51:53] wow these soldiers everywhere and he
[1:51:55] comes back shaking oh my Lord we've had
[1:51:57] it they're going to kill us this is our
[1:51:58] last day on Earth Elisha didn't smack
[1:52:01] him he didn't get the belt off no he
[1:52:03] just put his hand on him said Lord open
[1:52:05] the young man's eyes now go look again
[1:52:08] and he goes out wow Angels everywhere
[1:52:11] what happened here they were there all
[1:52:12] the time but he could see in the other
[1:52:14] dimension you see it's very
[1:52:17] important and there's other places and
[1:52:19] that's it's a dimension that's faster
[1:52:21] than this
[1:52:22] one you know there's many people here
[1:52:25] that you can't
[1:52:26] see so in 1950 and you you know some of
[1:52:30] this story but just pay attention you're
[1:52:32] going to get some more of the details in
[1:52:33] 1950 brother bram's preaching in Houston
[1:52:36] Texas it's a series of of 10 nights and
[1:52:39] during that time he um uh encountered
[1:52:43] this Baptist man that thought it was his
[1:52:46] job on Earth to show that brother
[1:52:49] Brandon was false
[1:52:50] and all this is a bunch of nonsense and
[1:52:52] you guys are being deceived and it was
[1:52:55] in the newspapers well brother Bosworth
[1:52:57] was helping brother brandom at the time
[1:52:59] and so he said um now brother brandom we
[1:53:02] have to answer this it's in the
[1:53:03] newspapers we look foolish we got to do
[1:53:05] something and brother BR says we're not
[1:53:06] going to spend one whole night on that
[1:53:08] guy when there's hundreds need praying
[1:53:10] for So eventually brother Bosworth
[1:53:13] convinced brother brandom that he could
[1:53:14] do it very cleanly nothing's nobody's
[1:53:16] going to get hurt okay so then he told
[1:53:19] the press and it was in newspapers well
[1:53:20] now instead of this this place that held
[1:53:23] 8,000 people they went to the place that
[1:53:25] held 30,000 people because a lot of
[1:53:27] people came into town to back up Divine
[1:53:30] Healing more Believers you know and so
[1:53:33] they they they they uh have this meeting
[1:53:36] I think it was the 20th or 21st of
[1:53:38] January of 1950 and so um brother
[1:53:42] Brandon's in the hotel he says well you
[1:53:44] guys have at it I'll be there tomorrow
[1:53:46] but then the holy spirit says no you
[1:53:48] must get ready and go to church
[1:53:50] so he says he comes to church and he
[1:53:52] disguised himself now I don't know what
[1:53:53] he did to disguise himself but nobody
[1:53:55] knew he was there okay we're not going
[1:53:56] to argue how that happen so he's there
[1:54:00] with his wife with his brother and
[1:54:03] four-year-old
[1:54:05] Rebecca she remembered it very well
[1:54:08] because when they got into church it's
[1:54:10] all full and they had to sit up in the
[1:54:11] balcony way up there and they on the
[1:54:13] edge like where you guys are sitting and
[1:54:15] and so he could see what was going on
[1:54:17] and so he's sitting in church
[1:54:20] nobody knows he's there and Rebecca's
[1:54:23] sitting on his lap well that's the first
[1:54:25] time because in all the other meetings
[1:54:28] in her four years she looked and saw the
[1:54:30] other girl sitting with their dad but
[1:54:32] she her dad was up here she could never
[1:54:34] sit with her dad now she's sitting with
[1:54:36] Daddy
[1:54:38] ah and she was the only child at the
[1:54:41] time you know so um she's sitting up
[1:54:44] there with him and the debates going on
[1:54:46] down here and of course you you've heard
[1:54:49] the tape many times for brother Brandon
[1:54:52] relates it because brother BOS says well
[1:54:54] I have one question for the noble
[1:54:56] Reverend best the seven compound names
[1:54:59] of Jehovah the Old Testament can we
[1:55:01] apply those to Jesus Christ yes or
[1:55:03] no well let me think here if I say yes
[1:55:07] that includes Divine Healing can't do
[1:55:09] that and if I say no then there's no
[1:55:12] salvation so he's hung you
[1:55:15] know so they had their little fuss about
[1:55:18] it and um So eventually brother Bosworth
[1:55:22] says
[1:55:23] now I believe brother brandom's in the
[1:55:25] audience someplace when I see we got 500
[1:55:29] people here or less and it's hard to
[1:55:30] pick somebody out but you take 30,000 be
[1:55:33] very difficult to see who's who you know
[1:55:35] and so he says I believe brother Brand's
[1:55:37] in the audience if he's here he's
[1:55:40] welcome to come down dismiss the
[1:55:42] audience because it's it's over you
[1:55:44] know so brother brand starts to get up
[1:55:48] and his brother says don't get up you
[1:55:49] cause a
[1:55:50] riot it be a bad and his wife said it's
[1:55:54] okay he knows what he's doing so he gets
[1:55:57] up and he puts Rebecca in his seat so
[1:55:59] she could see all the way down and she
[1:56:01] always said that she remembered seeing
[1:56:03] the soles of his you know the bottom of
[1:56:04] his feet of the shoes as he came walking
[1:56:07] down so he comes walking down to the
[1:56:10] platform and he says on tape that as he
[1:56:13] was walking down here 500 ushers made a
[1:56:16] way for him to get here because see if
[1:56:18] you had a SP child or if you had a
[1:56:20] cancer mother or whatever that's where
[1:56:22] you'd want to be so here's all these
[1:56:25] people needing prayer and here comes the
[1:56:27] man of God walking down the
[1:56:29] aisle but he made it down here okay so
[1:56:32] he gets down here to the
[1:56:36] platform and um he says a few words and
[1:56:39] then he says
[1:56:41] um I don't have to say anymore he's
[1:56:44] present now the Baptist had hired these
[1:56:47] two photographers professional
[1:56:49] photographers with big cameras to take
[1:56:51] pictures because horse he was going to
[1:56:52] win and then these pictures would go on
[1:56:54] the newspaper and see I won and all that
[1:56:55] so they're taking these pictures and so
[1:56:58] when he says he's here and then these
[1:57:00] guys go home to develop their their film
[1:57:02] the only picture that came out is this
[1:57:03] one
[1:57:11] here now we have people today that have
[1:57:14] taken the Liberty to say that this is a
[1:57:15] fake picture I wouldn't want to be in
[1:57:17] their
[1:57:18] shoes
[1:57:19] so the picture was taken and time
[1:57:24] passes and then um later you know years
[1:57:29] later Rebecca's listening to the tape
[1:57:31] and she hears him talk about those 500
[1:57:33] ushers that made a way for him to get
[1:57:34] here and she was up there watching and
[1:57:36] she had a very good
[1:57:38] memory and she says to her mom now Mom
[1:57:40] you were there did you see those 500
[1:57:42] ushers mom said honey those weren't
[1:57:44] ushers those are
[1:57:48] angels
[1:57:56] so he was seeing
[1:57:58] something nobody else saw
[1:58:00] him maybe somebody saw the light I don't
[1:58:03] know but most people didn't see the
[1:58:04] light now he says about this picture he
[1:58:07] says it's better if you have the picture
[1:58:08] than if the real thing comes in the room
[1:58:10] because your eyes can fool you but this
[1:58:12] is
[1:58:13] real in another place he's in a he's
[1:58:16] he's in a service and people are coming
[1:58:18] through and this lady's got the picture
[1:58:19] she bought out front and she's in the
[1:58:20] prayer line and he says well I see you
[1:58:22] have the picture let's talk about that
[1:58:24] she wanted to get into conversation to
[1:58:26] um you know
[1:58:28] discerner and so um he says I see you
[1:58:32] have that picture and he says not at
[1:58:33] home I have a a testimony on my desk
[1:58:36] about a lady that was in the hospital
[1:58:38] she was dying and she had this picture
[1:58:40] on the nightstand beside the bed and as
[1:58:44] she was praying the light came off of
[1:58:47] the picture and came over her and she
[1:58:49] was healed went
[1:58:52] home it's pretty
[1:58:57] important in 1958 brother Brandon was
[1:59:00] coming home uh another he was out in
[1:59:02] Iowa actually in part of the West he was
[1:59:04] in a meeting and he had this Vision that
[1:59:07] one day they're going to put a little uh
[1:59:09] surveyor marker by his by his Stone
[1:59:12] entrance and when you see that little
[1:59:15] that little thing there that means you
[1:59:17] pick up your stuff and you go west real
[1:59:19] simple because if you stay you're going
[1:59:20] to get in a fight with a guy's because
[1:59:23] see when he bought the property the
[1:59:24] reason brother Brown bought that
[1:59:25] property up there where he built his
[1:59:27] house is because during the flood he was
[1:59:30] in his little boat out there you know
[1:59:31] rescuing people and he noticed hey that
[1:59:33] Hillside is above the water if I ever
[1:59:35] build a house I'm going to build it up
[1:59:36] there so he built this house in
[1:59:39] 1948 and um it was just it was way out
[1:59:42] of the Town it was out out there and so
[1:59:44] it just a small Lane but now in 19 uh 58
[1:59:49] he has this Vision because soon they're
[1:59:51] going to widen the road because the city
[1:59:54] grew out there and they needed a wider
[1:59:55] road so he saw this Vision he wrote it
[1:59:57] down he had he had a little book he kept
[1:59:59] all that stuff written
[2:00:00] down so he's coming home one day in
[2:00:04] 1962 from somewhere and he sees the
[2:00:07] little marker in the in the in the out
[2:00:09] there by his uh gate hm I think there's
[2:00:12] something in my book about that so he
[2:00:13] goes looking through his book there it
[2:00:15] is huh pick up your stuff and go west so
[2:00:19] you know the story they had the
[2:00:20] different visions and dreams and stuff
[2:00:21] and and he went West okay now when he
[2:00:25] went
[2:00:25] West it was January of
[2:00:29] 1963 now there was an African brother
[2:00:32] told me once he said you ought to write
[2:00:33] a book The the last three years well
[2:00:36] these are some of the details that you
[2:00:37] won't find in a lot of
[2:00:39] places so they go west in January of
[2:00:42] 1963 because it's between the two
[2:00:44] semesters of
[2:00:46] school and when he got out west he
[2:00:49] rented this apartment and like I say it
[2:00:51] was just a block from my house but I
[2:00:53] didn't know him
[2:00:54] then and one of the first things he did
[2:00:57] was he sent out little cards of
[2:00:59] invitation come to Jeffersonville March
[2:01:02] 17 to 24th Seven Seals that's all he
[2:01:05] knew send out the invitation didn't know
[2:01:08] anything about it so he sends out the
[2:01:11] invitation well also so that's pressure
[2:01:13] number one Seven Seals March
[2:01:17] 63 pressure number two a friend of his
[2:01:20] called a preacher friend of his in the
[2:01:22] world and you know back then he said now
[2:01:25] brother brandham there last year 1962
[2:01:28] there was a robbery in Houston a man was
[2:01:31] killed and they've blamed these two
[2:01:34] kids and um uh the boy is nephew to the
[2:01:39] man that took the picture this one here
[2:01:42] he said um we would like for you to come
[2:01:44] to to um to Houston on Monday March the
[2:01:48] 4th for a prayer meeting because they're
[2:01:51] up for sentencing and they could get
[2:01:52] life in prison or they could get death
[2:01:55] and we'd like for you to come and help
[2:01:57] pray he says I'll be there and it's
[2:01:59] right on tape he says if I didn't go and
[2:02:01] they killed those kids I could never go
[2:02:03] hunting he said I must go and do what I
[2:02:06] can okay pressure number two pressure
[2:02:09] number three since
[2:02:11] 1947 he was always in Arizona in the
[2:02:14] spring for the Havalina hunt he was a
[2:02:17] hunter he was Elijah man of the
[2:02:19] Wilderness so the Havalina pig is a it's
[2:02:22] a it's a wild pig and my son still hunts
[2:02:25] him and everything so that was something
[2:02:27] brother brand loved to do and he
[2:02:29] promised these two brothers I'll be
[2:02:30] there for the hunt in
[2:02:33] 1963 pressure number three so this stuff
[2:02:36] is going on besides all the other daily
[2:02:38] things going on then he showing up and
[2:02:40] so forth and um
[2:02:43] so we come down to the end of February
[2:02:47] of 63
[2:02:49] and um he's preparing to go to Houston
[2:02:51] to pre to pray for the you know have the
[2:02:54] service on March the 4th there's a
[2:02:57] tape and when he's telling all these
[2:03:00] things he says first I went to Houston
[2:03:02] then I went
[2:03:03] hunting now I know you're all wondering
[2:03:06] I've got the picture right here
[2:03:07] someplace um you're all wondering well
[2:03:10] what about this picture well no problem
[2:03:13] that's in Life Magazine right there now
[2:03:16] National Geographic magazine has paid
[2:03:19] photographers they're roaming the globe
[2:03:22] you know Finding nice stuff Life
[2:03:23] Magazine publishes what they send them
[2:03:26] and so somebody took this picture and
[2:03:29] it's dated February
[2:03:32] 28th brother Brandon was not hunting on
[2:03:34] February
[2:03:36] 28th the hunting started on March 1st
[2:03:39] that year and he went to Houston March
[2:03:41] 4th and then he went hunting it's on
[2:03:43] tape I didn't invent
[2:03:45] it
[2:03:47] so first thing first of the three things
[2:03:50] he goes to
[2:03:52] Houston so they go to Houston they have
[2:03:54] the service pray for these of course the
[2:03:56] kids are in jail and they're praying for
[2:03:58] them now the result of that was that
[2:04:00] they gave them a life sentence they
[2:04:02] didn't kill them and they were out in 15
[2:04:05] years but brother brandham got a uh
[2:04:08] certificate he talks about it for saving
[2:04:11] a
[2:04:12] life now instead of going on to
[2:04:14] Jeffersonville taking it easy maybe you
[2:04:17] know sitting by the pool like might do
[2:04:19] no he he got in the car that night that
[2:04:20] Monday night drove all the way back to
[2:04:23] Tucson 1100 miles the wrong way to keep
[2:04:27] his word to these two Hunters didn't
[2:04:29] know what was happening just I kept my
[2:04:31] word to these two Hunters Billy Paul
[2:04:32] went on to Jeffersonville to take care
[2:04:34] of the Tabernacle and get ready for the
[2:04:36] for the meetings coming up on the 17th
[2:04:38] of March so brother Ram goes back to
[2:04:41] Tucson gets his stuff ready they could
[2:04:44] have got out there by the 6th or early
[2:04:46] on the 7th of May of March
[2:04:49] and when he tells the story he says we
[2:04:51] were sitting around the fire I already
[2:04:54] had my pig which means he killed it that
[2:04:56] day which no matter how you cut it could
[2:04:59] have been the seventh and he said we
[2:05:02] were around the fire and God was
[2:05:04] revealing a lot of things about these
[2:05:05] people's family and I had to walk away
[2:05:07] because there's so many many things
[2:05:09] happening the brothers say that while he
[2:05:12] was at the fire he said the angels have
[2:05:15] been waiting here for a week for us hm
[2:05:19] hallah Hallelujah and so then on the 8th
[2:05:21] of March they're out hunting now when
[2:05:23] you go hunting as brother Ed and all you
[2:05:25] Hunters know you go out when you can
[2:05:27] barely see it's just barely daylight and
[2:05:28] you're out there you know finding your
[2:05:30] way planning to come back to meet again
[2:05:33] at 9 or 10:00 in the morning when it's
[2:05:35] already getting warm so they're out
[2:05:37] there he's over here and those other
[2:05:38] guys are over here and the blast takes
[2:05:41] place and all these things happen so
[2:05:44] when he comes back and meets the
[2:05:45] brothers he says did you guys hear that
[2:05:48] he never said did you see and there's no
[2:05:50] pictures of March the 8th okay
[2:05:54] so he explains a little bit what
[2:05:56] happened they pick up they go to
[2:05:57] Jeffersonville he preaches now when he's
[2:06:00] going in to preach the seals the church
[2:06:02] has been finished it's been remodeled
[2:06:04] everything's
[2:06:05] nice all the people are there he's just
[2:06:08] had this tremendous experience and so he
[2:06:11] goes by Billy Paul's office on the way
[2:06:13] to the pulpit and he says now Billy if
[2:06:16] you ever prayed for daddy pray now oh I
[2:06:19] don't have any idea what I'm going to
[2:06:20] say to these
[2:06:22] people that's walking by
[2:06:25] faith he didn't have it all mapped
[2:06:28] out there's several messages where he
[2:06:30] just he's invited up he has nothing a
[2:06:33] man running from the presence of the
[2:06:34] Lord in in February of 65 he had nothing
[2:06:38] he opens the Bible got a tremendous
[2:06:39] message okay so he preaches the
[2:06:44] seals and two tapes that you need to
[2:06:47] listen to as soon as possible are the
[2:06:50] two tapes after the seals in April of 63
[2:06:53] in Albuquerque New
[2:06:55] Mexico uh God in Simplicity and the
[2:06:57] world falling apart things on there he
[2:07:00] says nowhere
[2:07:01] else so time
[2:07:04] passes and
[2:07:06] um brother Norman was one of the
[2:07:08] brothers at the fire well his
[2:07:11] brother-in-law had a subscription to
[2:07:13] Life Magazine not everybody had the
[2:07:14] subscription but the brother-in-law had
[2:07:16] it so the magazine is dated May 17th
[2:07:19] well they mail it a few days early so
[2:07:21] that you have it in your hands by May
[2:07:24] 17th so brother Norman is over at his
[2:07:26] house after the 15th of May someday and
[2:07:30] he sees this magazine he thumbs through
[2:07:32] it oh wow Arizona mystery looks
[2:07:35] interesting he takes it home he's got it
[2:07:38] on his table brother brandom comes by on
[2:07:40] Sunday and he sees it and real cool that
[2:07:43] he was he say hey can I borrow that I
[2:07:45] like to study that so he takes the
[2:07:48] magazine home home and on the first week
[2:07:50] of June he mentions it this isn't
[2:07:53] Fiction it's all on
[2:07:54] tape and so he mentions this in the
[2:07:57] first week of June he says yeah somebody
[2:08:00] took the picture he says I checked the
[2:08:02] date yeah a couple days before after
[2:08:04] kind of a vague well friends the fact of
[2:08:07] it is he's in another dimension on May
[2:08:08] on March the 8th when he's seeing this
[2:08:10] nobody took the picture they could have
[2:08:12] took the picture in 1940 but this is
[2:08:14] when it happened first I went to Houston
[2:08:16] then I went hunting just that simple now
[2:08:19] if you want to argue about it well I
[2:08:21] don't have
[2:08:22] time so that's the prophetic Dimension
[2:08:25] okay so time passes we're in high school
[2:08:29] and we come up to December of um 63 and
[2:08:34] you know how it is when when your
[2:08:36] girlfriend goes away on vacation or
[2:08:38] something H it's the end of the world
[2:08:41] and so they're off in Jeffersonville
[2:08:43] I've never been past the you know State
[2:08:45] Line Bally and I don't know where
[2:08:47] Jeffersonville is
[2:08:48] but um they're gone they're only going
[2:08:51] be gone 2 weeks but it seemed like 5
[2:08:53] years so I was
[2:08:56] young thin had lots of black
[2:08:59] hair and uh foolish and so I thumbed a
[2:09:03] ride with some Believers and showed up
[2:09:05] for church you know Sunday morning the
[2:09:06] 29th of December big surprise so wow I'm
[2:09:11] sitting in church wow this is neat you
[2:09:13] know and and so so then after the
[2:09:15] service we're at lunch and brother says
[2:09:18] now George of course he knew we were you
[2:09:20] know we were both in choir at the at the
[2:09:23] school and uh I was the assistant choir
[2:09:26] director at the Baptist Church so he
[2:09:28] said now George in the service tonight
[2:09:30] I'd like for you to
[2:09:31] sing me the brandom
[2:09:34] Tabernacle what would I sing here well
[2:09:37] we're going to have a prayer line
[2:09:38] tonight H and so I want you to sing then
[2:09:42] Jesus came well we didn't learn that at
[2:09:44] the Baptist
[2:09:46] Church so I
[2:09:48] we learned it and so sang it that night
[2:09:51] and uh that was the first time Rebecca
[2:09:53] played in church he was very proud and
[2:09:55] he was pleased and so time goes on and
[2:09:59] we um uh he came out and preached Look
[2:10:02] Away to Jesus okay so that's 63 we come
[2:10:05] to May of ' 64 and um Rebecca and I both
[2:10:09] graduated together from High School and
[2:10:11] our parents were both sitting together
[2:10:12] all four of them sitting together out
[2:10:14] there and very proud day for William
[2:10:15] brandham he said finally a brandom has
[2:10:19] graduated because before that they've
[2:10:21] been very poor and nobody finished high
[2:10:23] school and so um very few since then to
[2:10:26] be honest so he was very proud of that
[2:10:28] well in July of 64 he's over there in
[2:10:31] there in uh Philadelphia preaching the
[2:10:34] the great message um uh mighty God
[2:10:38] unveiled now when you went to church
[2:10:40] with brother brandom uh in the car with
[2:10:43] him he got there and church is already
[2:10:46] going on you know he didn't come for the
[2:10:48] preliminaries and so it was him and
[2:10:51] Billy Paul and and Rebecca and her
[2:10:53] friend Betty four people well Billy Paul
[2:10:57] who knows he was sitting someplace and
[2:10:59] uh so there was no seats so they find a
[2:11:01] seat in the mezzan there was another
[2:11:03] level and they found the two seats for
[2:11:05] the girls to sit up there so Rebecca and
[2:11:07] her friend Betty were sitting up there
[2:11:09] and so brother brandham comes in well
[2:11:11] brother Roberts was speaking at the time
[2:11:13] you know at that particular moment so
[2:11:15] brother Bram takes a seat beside him
[2:11:16] there's a long table and so while
[2:11:19] brother Brand's sitting there he reaches
[2:11:20] over and he he touches brother Robert's
[2:11:23] coat you know just barely touches
[2:11:25] it well then he preaches the message and
[2:11:29] they're
[2:11:30] leaving and Rebecca says I saw what you
[2:11:34] did I saw you touch his coat and he says
[2:11:38] oh sis that was such a nice fabric it
[2:11:41] was so
[2:11:43] nice and he said I looked down I had the
[2:11:46] the black pants and the brown coat or
[2:11:48] know some combination that wasn't right
[2:11:50] and he said I felt so foolish well of
[2:11:52] course his outfit probably cost $59 and
[2:11:55] and Robert's probably a thousand you
[2:11:56] know and uh so the moral of the story is
[2:11:59] they were both called of
[2:12:02] God one had to have everything just fine
[2:12:06] you know he wouldn't wear shirt like I
[2:12:08] wear he had to be just perfect you know
[2:12:11] and the other one actually had something
[2:12:13] to say it didn't matter what he looked
[2:12:14] like you know he was nice but it didn't
[2:12:16] have to be perfect
[2:12:19] well um in another time brother Brandon
[2:12:23] was preaching and he comes to the end of
[2:12:25] the service now a lot of times he
[2:12:27] preached in a big Auditorium like this
[2:12:28] it wasn't always in a church and the
[2:12:30] audit the uh the platform was a little
[2:12:34] higher and he says now I want to show
[2:12:36] you all what the reason for the success
[2:12:38] of these Services of course they all
[2:12:40] thought it was on him he said no and so
[2:12:43] they had a big curtain like this so they
[2:12:44] raised the curtain and there was old
[2:12:47] John Ryan back back there out face down
[2:12:49] praying he said that's the reason for
[2:12:51] the success of these
[2:12:58] meetings now I'm not going to give you
[2:13:00] all the secrets of the courtship but we
[2:13:02] were under surveillance okay you can
[2:13:05] believe that now brother brandham didn't
[2:13:08] live in a gated community he lived right
[2:13:09] on a simple Street little bitty car
[2:13:13] didn't even have a carport didn't have
[2:13:15] nothing to protect his car it was a
[2:13:16] rented apartment at the time lived there
[2:13:18] all of 63 or you know 63 64 65 in this
[2:13:24] apartment and so he had a telephone and
[2:13:27] people learned his
[2:13:29] number and they didn't all call for good
[2:13:33] reasons you know what color car shall I
[2:13:36] buy I have a toothache all kinds of
[2:13:38] things well he was human you got tired
[2:13:41] of it so he's looking at the phone now
[2:13:44] those phones back then the the the phone
[2:13:46] at our house was the the rotary you had
[2:13:49] dial take forever to dial number well
[2:13:52] when by 63 when he got there they had
[2:13:54] the push button but it was still a fixed
[2:13:56] phone you know wired to the to the wall
[2:13:59] they didn't have the wireless yet and so
[2:14:02] he picks up the the telephone he's
[2:14:03] looking at it well on the bottom there
[2:14:04] was a wheel that you could turn and if
[2:14:07] you turned it one way the ringer got
[2:14:09] louder and if you turned it the other
[2:14:11] way it's shut off so you could be
[2:14:14] calling him it sounds like it's ringing
[2:14:16] but he doesn't hear because the Ringer's
[2:14:17] off
[2:14:19] well so we were young just like you guys
[2:14:23] we like to talk on the phone yeah only
[2:14:26] lived a block away but you know just
[2:14:28] what people do and we didn't have these
[2:14:30] little guys okay there was a time we
[2:14:32] didn't have cell
[2:14:34] phones and so um and of course my dad
[2:14:37] raised in this big
[2:14:39] family uh he uh he said now look he says
[2:14:43] the phone is for communication not for
[2:14:46] visiting unless he needed to visit then
[2:14:49] it was different yeah he raised 10 kids
[2:14:53] no rock and roll no drugs no foolishness
[2:14:56] he said we have a we have a a democracy
[2:14:58] here I got the
[2:15:01] vote just like Reverend Spencer
[2:15:04] right and so um uh so Rebecca says what
[2:15:09] are we going to do said no problem you
[2:15:12] set your watch just like mine exactly
[2:15:14] like mine okay now when it's 7:00 I'm
[2:15:17] going to di your number I'm going to
[2:15:18] call you but thanks to your dad the
[2:15:21] phone's not going to ring but you pick
[2:15:23] it up I'll be there okay so 7:00 I call
[2:15:28] hello and it had a long cord so she
[2:15:31] would take the phone and she would go in
[2:15:33] the closet and shut the door so we had
[2:15:35] some privacy you see love conquers
[2:15:40] all
[2:15:42] okay so uh another thing that Rebecca
[2:15:45] told me one time uh wait a minute got
[2:15:47] got to give you more about the courtship
[2:15:50] I had this this used Ford truck right it
[2:15:52] was like 5 years old at the time they
[2:15:54] didn't have double cab didn't have air
[2:15:56] conditioning didn't have stereo but it
[2:15:57] was clean well brother brandham had a
[2:16:00] Cadillac now he preached against
[2:16:03] Cadillacs because that was the fine car
[2:16:05] of the time but the Christian
[2:16:07] businessmen wanting to you know uh bless
[2:16:11] some of their people they wanted to give
[2:16:13] him a new car he said no no no no no
[2:16:15] this Forge station won's fine and so he
[2:16:19] um he was gone someplace and brother
[2:16:21] Argan bright out in California always
[2:16:23] got his new car about October you know
[2:16:26] and so when he got his new 56 Cadillac
[2:16:29] he gave the keys to the 55 Cadillac to
[2:16:32] these two guys he said now you drive
[2:16:34] this thing to over there Jeffersonville
[2:16:36] this address you park it you give the
[2:16:38] keys you don't talk to nobody you just
[2:16:40] give the keys and
[2:16:41] leave okay so they take it over there
[2:16:43] and leave it well brother random comes
[2:16:45] home wow check out this car well it's
[2:16:47] like from here to the wall you it's just
[2:16:49] huge
[2:16:50] car big four-door you know had a a V8
[2:16:54] engine with two four barrel
[2:16:56] carburetors oh powerful car and so he
[2:17:01] puts it in the garage hides it several
[2:17:04] months later he put a little piece in
[2:17:05] the paper now I'm you're going to see me
[2:17:07] driving this big blue and white car he
[2:17:11] said it didn't I didn't buy it with
[2:17:12] y'all's
[2:17:14] money I was a gift and so he eventually
[2:17:18] got it out and started driving it was
[2:17:19] beautiful so he took it to
[2:17:21] Arizona so I would come up to take
[2:17:23] Rebecca on a date and he would say well
[2:17:25] here George use my car well I was young
[2:17:28] but I wasn't stupid it's 100° out you
[2:17:31] know and I had a big air conditioner
[2:17:33] well thank you very much so I'd park my
[2:17:35] truck and take the
[2:17:36] Cadillac well the
[2:17:39] um um the Cadillac needed the expensive
[2:17:42] gas now back then I know it's like 100
[2:17:46] years ago but the gas that I used cost
[2:17:49] 25 cents a
[2:17:51] gallon but we had to use the expensive
[2:17:54] gas in the Cadillac 36 Cents a
[2:17:56] gallon so we'd pull in and they didn't
[2:17:58] have self-service either you had to you
[2:18:00] had to get the guy to do it so we'd pull
[2:18:02] into a big station we want
[2:18:07] $2 well anyway let's get on to the story
[2:18:10] here so um um in 1965 brother Brandon
[2:18:14] was preaching in Phoenix he always
[2:18:17] preached up there in January at the at
[2:18:19] the Christian businessman's meeting and
[2:18:21] so in this particular service we were
[2:18:24] all there and there was some different
[2:18:27] case in that service some sister I don't
[2:18:29] know what it was but it was very
[2:18:30] different from everybody else so now
[2:18:33] we're driving home back to Tucson two
[2:18:34] hours and we're halfway and he stops for
[2:18:37] something to drink and so while we're
[2:18:39] stopped Rebecca says now dad tonight you
[2:18:42] know in the service and she gave him a
[2:18:43] couple
[2:18:44] clues about this sister because she she
[2:18:46] wanted to know just what about that
[2:18:48] sister and so he uh well he took his hat
[2:18:51] off and got real serious and he started
[2:18:54] telling us other things about that
[2:18:56] lady well that's when you start paying
[2:18:58] attention you know H this is something
[2:19:01] real and uh and and so those things
[2:19:04] would happen she told us another time
[2:19:06] she said we were in a restaurant having
[2:19:08] uh lunch one day a family and over to
[2:19:11] another table there was a policeman and
[2:19:14] he had ordered his food and so just as
[2:19:16] his food was coming his his radio
[2:19:18] started blasting and he needed to leave
[2:19:21] so he dropped everything and took off
[2:19:22] the light flashing and everything
[2:19:24] brother brand was still eating everybody
[2:19:25] else is nervous and he said it's no big
[2:19:27] deal over there a few blocks this little
[2:19:29] boy fell out of a tree and broke his arm
[2:19:31] but he's going to be okay so Rebecca
[2:19:33] said now we knew everybody's dad didn't
[2:19:35] do
[2:19:36] that so they had an interesting life you
[2:19:40] know um now we come to May of
[2:19:43] 65 but before we get there because we're
[2:19:46] going to wind this up in another 30
[2:19:48] minutes maybe um at the end of
[2:19:53] 1964 the brother brand says the Lord
[2:19:55] sent his Angel and told him now look you
[2:19:57] need to look for a place to stay because
[2:19:59] you're going to live here you know this
[2:20:00] isn't temporary you're going to find a
[2:20:02] house so he starts
[2:20:06] looking and um I remember him telling me
[2:20:09] once he said now the Christian
[2:20:10] businessman offered me a real nice house
[2:20:12] in Phoenix nice big driveway and I
[2:20:15] remember he said it cost $96,000 how
[2:20:17] could I live in a house like that and
[2:20:19] then people come up there and little use
[2:20:21] Chevrolet to be prayed for I couldn't do
[2:20:22] that no he said so he he kept looking
[2:20:26] and he found U he said the Lord directed
[2:20:28] him right to this house there in Tucson
[2:20:31] so this old man had built three houses
[2:20:33] and had them almost finished and then he
[2:20:35] would want to sell them so that the
[2:20:37] buyer could finish it out the way he
[2:20:38] wanted it and so brother bandam looked
[2:20:40] at this house he liked it you know and
[2:20:42] it had space over here to add on the
[2:20:44] denim that he wanted to always have to
[2:20:46] put his animals in
[2:20:48] and so brother BR standing in the
[2:20:49] doorway of the house looking
[2:20:51] out and the the Builder is looking he's
[2:20:54] standing out there looking in and
[2:20:55] they're talking price well Joseph is 9
[2:20:59] years old at the time this little boy
[2:21:01] and you know how kids are always running
[2:21:02] their finger up you know checking things
[2:21:05] out so while they're talking Joseph's
[2:21:07] running his finger up the door jam you
[2:21:10] know there's the hole there where the
[2:21:11] lock goes so he's running his finger up
[2:21:14] well brother random as he's talking he
[2:21:16] reaches into his pocket and gets out his
[2:21:18] knife without even looking away and he
[2:21:21] sticks it in that hole and out comes a
[2:21:24] scorpion and he's not looking and Joseph
[2:21:27] was as far
[2:21:28] away yeah those things
[2:21:31] happen so he bought the house so all of
[2:21:34] 65 they're finishing the house and the
[2:21:36] driveway and all this stuff you know I
[2:21:38] remember helping him put some beds
[2:21:40] together and things and um so in May of
[2:21:43] 65 here I was you know without a job I
[2:21:46] was out of high school school um didn't
[2:21:48] have a job I didn't have a car wake
[2:21:59] up and so uh no job no car wasn't
[2:22:04] baptized right no Holy Ghost talk about
[2:22:07] a loser but I thought I needed a wife
[2:22:10] huh so I found a time when brother
[2:22:12] Brandon was not busy I went up to the
[2:22:15] house you know and he we said in the the
[2:22:19] room there and we're talking I was there
[2:22:22] for a purpose well he starts telling all
[2:22:24] kinds of stories about I don't know
[2:22:26] trips and bunch of stuff and it goes on
[2:22:30] and on I said brother Bram now this is
[2:22:32] wonderful but I'm here for a purpose oh
[2:22:35] what would that be well she looking
[2:22:37] right through me you know I said well
[2:22:39] you must have noticed that I I really
[2:22:40] like your daughter Rebecca and so uh I'm
[2:22:43] here to ask for your blessing and your
[2:22:45] permission because we we'd like to get
[2:22:46] married married CU I'd already talked to
[2:22:48] her she was in agreement you know and um
[2:22:52] he says well now well the eyes got real
[2:22:54] narrow then you know was friends up to
[2:22:55] there and then he got real narrow and he
[2:22:58] says um now look
[2:23:00] George um I'm going to give you guys
[2:23:03] permission to be engaged but don't even
[2:23:05] think about marriage until you both have
[2:23:07] the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said
[2:23:10] because you see all these other cases
[2:23:12] that didn't work out too good I said yes
[2:23:15] sir well time went on that's in may they
[2:23:20] go away again in June for June and July
[2:23:23] of 65 and here I go you know and so
[2:23:26] there in U in uh the uh summertime back
[2:23:30] in Jeffersonville when he was preaching
[2:23:32] the U events made clear by
[2:23:34] prophecy uh anointed one the end time I
[2:23:37] was sitting from oh closer than the
[2:23:40] organ I was I was sitting closer
[2:23:42] watching him preach the anointed ones at
[2:23:43] the end
[2:23:44] time going right over
[2:23:47] you know and um so on August the 1st he
[2:23:52] preached and I knew that we were going
[2:23:54] to go back to Tucson that week and I
[2:23:56] said now brother R before we leave to go
[2:23:58] to Tucson would you have time to baptize
[2:24:00] me in Christian baptism why sure you'd
[2:24:02] be waiting almost three years for that
[2:24:04] you know so on August the 2nd we went
[2:24:06] down to the church and there's a few
[2:24:08] people um
[2:24:10] witness he didn't know who the Witnesses
[2:24:12] were because he told his brother hey if
[2:24:13] there's some visitors bring them in for
[2:24:15] witness well here's some ladies out
[2:24:17] there you know a few couples well he
[2:24:19] comes in to baptize with no shirt on he
[2:24:21] was kind of embarrassed you know so he
[2:24:23] baptized me in in random Tabernacle
[2:24:26] turns out that was the last person he
[2:24:27] baptized course we didn't know it then
[2:24:30] and um so then we're back in ton and by
[2:24:34] then I had had the baptism straight of
[2:24:36] course I had the girl you know have her
[2:24:38] ring and um um and I had a car got
[2:24:43] 5-year-old car but was nice so we're
[2:24:45] driving around I'm driving he's the
[2:24:47] passenger he says man I like this car
[2:24:49] you know and so somehow we got to he he
[2:24:52] comes up with he says now George if you
[2:24:54] ever get to go to Israel your Bible will
[2:24:57] be a new
[2:24:58] Bible now regardless of what all you
[2:25:01] heard he was never there okay but he
[2:25:04] said that to me I wasn't thinking about
[2:25:07] Israel he wasn't reading my mind I was
[2:25:09] thinking about the girl you know and so
[2:25:12] um uh so sure enough that was in ' 65
[2:25:17] well eight years later we made our first
[2:25:18] trip and the Bible becomes a new book
[2:25:21] wow all the stuff's right there you know
[2:25:23] it's 50 miles 50 kmers up the side car
[2:25:25] and all these things it's just a small
[2:25:27] country well since then we've been able
[2:25:29] to uh take groups over and we're going
[2:25:33] on the 1st of November with the group
[2:25:35] that'll group be trip number 36 so we
[2:25:37] know where everything is we know the
[2:25:39] right people we know the Catholics over
[2:25:41] there they're nice
[2:25:42] people now when you go over there oh so
[2:25:45] much Catholic thank God for the
[2:25:47] Catholics they they preserved it it was
[2:25:50] up to the brandit that have carried it
[2:25:52] all home already
[2:25:54] yeah we had some people over there a
[2:25:57] couple years ago and so we're up on
[2:25:58] Mount Mount Caramel and there's a cave I
[2:26:01] don't know if that's the cave for Elijah
[2:26:03] was but it's you know the cave so the
[2:26:05] Catholics have built a nice church and
[2:26:07] they have the candles burning and
[2:26:08] everything so we look we take pictures
[2:26:11] so we get back on the
[2:26:12] bus and this one brother's hands are all
[2:26:14] black said' what in the world you've
[2:26:15] been doing well I was looking for a
[2:26:17] loose
[2:26:18] rock yeah 2,000 years later he thinks it
[2:26:21] can be a loose Rock for him but that's
[2:26:23] the way we are we're a bunch of
[2:26:25] idolators you know so we went over there
[2:26:28] uh all these times and it's safe I mean
[2:26:31] we've got happy customers sitting right
[2:26:32] here that have been
[2:26:34] there and we're going to take the
[2:26:36] Nigerians next year God willing so see
[2:26:40] me if you want to go but anyway so um uh
[2:26:45] in September
[2:26:48] um brother green was in Tucson to put
[2:26:50] new drapes in the house the new house
[2:26:53] because his mother was a seamstress and
[2:26:55] she was making the drapes for the house
[2:26:56] so Perry's in town putting up the drapes
[2:26:59] and brother brandom says to him uh
[2:27:01] brother Perry looks like this kid's
[2:27:02] going to be my son-in-law why don't you
[2:27:04] take him home pray for the baptism of
[2:27:06] Holy Ghost why didn't brother Brown just
[2:27:08] put his hand on me be done with it it's
[2:27:10] not God's plan so I go home with brother
[2:27:12] Perry to Texas I thought I was going to
[2:27:14] be on vacation I didn't know they didn't
[2:27:15] tell me why I was going
[2:27:17] going so about the second day I'm there
[2:27:20] brother Richard Blair comes over to use
[2:27:22] the telephone and he lived about 50 Mi
[2:27:24] away so he comes over to use the
[2:27:25] telephone to call brother Brandon well
[2:27:29] brother Brandon was already out of the
[2:27:30] house when they called but they said
[2:27:31] when he comes back we'll have him call
[2:27:33] you so these two brothers sitting by the
[2:27:35] telephone all day waiting for the phone
[2:27:36] call well I'm over in my room reading my
[2:27:39] Bible and I'm thinking hey there's two
[2:27:41] brothers here just us maybe we could
[2:27:43] just pray you know I didn't know I was
[2:27:45] supposed to be receiving the the Holy
[2:27:46] Ghost I just thought we'd
[2:27:48] pray and so we um we're kneeling at a at
[2:27:52] a bench there in the Sunday School room
[2:27:55] we're
[2:27:55] praying and while we're praying their
[2:27:58] eyes closed it seemed like like outside
[2:28:01] now you know the clouds are real high
[2:28:04] and then sometimes there's a shaft of
[2:28:05] light coming through different places
[2:28:07] you
[2:28:07] know and it seemed like one of those
[2:28:10] shafts of light was coming my way and um
[2:28:13] about then the phone rings and it was
[2:28:15] brother brandom calling for brother
[2:28:17] Blair but brother green goes to answer
[2:28:19] his phone and greets brother brandham
[2:28:22] but brother brandham says but first let
[2:28:23] me talk to George and so I greeted him
[2:28:27] now he knew that I had a hard head you
[2:28:30] know so he took the liberty to to um
[2:28:34] identify what had just happened he said
[2:28:37] I want to be the first to congratulate
[2:28:38] to George on receiving the baptism of
[2:28:40] the Holy
[2:28:41] [Music]
[2:28:45] Ghost
[2:28:51] well that was very nice but my faith
[2:28:54] isn't so much in what he said but in the
[2:28:56] fact that God had done something and it
[2:28:58] just got bigger and bigger the next day
[2:29:01] I got a call from my mother also in
[2:29:02] Arizona and she says hey we got a letter
[2:29:04] here from the president you've been
[2:29:06] drafted into the army huh they need you
[2:29:09] well I went home I didn't look for the
[2:29:11] shortcut like some people I went home
[2:29:14] reported for the Army So within a week
[2:29:16] week I was a soldier with the Holy
[2:29:19] Ghost yeah a good thing because there's
[2:29:21] a lot of sorry people in the
[2:29:23] Army well um that was September uh so in
[2:29:29] November brother Brandon was preaching
[2:29:31] in shreport Louisiana you've heard the
[2:29:33] tapes you know Snow White Dove and so
[2:29:34] forth and
[2:29:37] um so I'm only an hour and a half away
[2:29:40] it's a weekend so I asked for a pass
[2:29:42] well Rebecca came down took me to the
[2:29:44] meeting so I'm in the meeting in
[2:29:45] streetport Louisiana and on Saturday um
[2:29:49] I had a few minutes with brother Brandon
[2:29:50] by myself and I just was finishing basic
[2:29:53] training the six weeks of basic training
[2:29:56] and I didn't know what they were going
[2:29:57] to do with me I didn't know if I was
[2:29:58] going to be killing people or dropping
[2:30:00] bombs or what and so um I explained to
[2:30:04] him I said brother Braham I'm I'm kind
[2:30:05] of concerned about what they're going to
[2:30:06] do with me I don't know what they're
[2:30:07] going to what they're going to train me
[2:30:09] for he didn't say anything about a
[2:30:12] vision he didn't pray he just said don't
[2:30:15] worry George footsteps of the righteous
[2:30:17] are ordered of the Lord that was the end
[2:30:19] of that so I get back to the service get
[2:30:22] back you know that on Monday uh during
[2:30:25] that week and it turns out they're going
[2:30:26] to make a cook out of me huh well I can
[2:30:30] help myself and a few others you
[2:30:33] know and um so it was during that time
[2:30:36] it was on the uh I think it was the
[2:30:37] Saturday service that I'm sitting back
[2:30:39] there with Rebecca and he's telling this
[2:30:41] story and he says yeah my daughter she's
[2:30:43] engaged that lanky Soldier back there
[2:30:45] and he says I see him
[2:30:48] so we were friends okay and we we got
[2:30:52] along very well but um uh come Christmas
[2:30:57] time in December of
[2:30:59] 65 and by then the house is all finished
[2:31:02] and now the family's going to go back
[2:31:03] East preach at Christmas pick up the new
[2:31:06] car and come back and go right into the
[2:31:08] new house so Rebecca's left in Tucson to
[2:31:10] move the stuff out of the apartment into
[2:31:12] the house oh that's nice she'll be here
[2:31:14] and I'm here I can help her
[2:31:17] and so um when brother bam traveled if
[2:31:21] he was by himself or with Billy Paul he
[2:31:23] would just wear boots and blue jeans and
[2:31:26] just any shirt but if he was with the
[2:31:28] family he would dress up a little bit
[2:31:30] maybe not a tie but he would look a lot
[2:31:32] nicer he also liked to leave very
[2:31:36] early now he didn't care for everybody
[2:31:38] went to sleep it's fine but we're going
[2:31:40] to get there so at 6:00 he's already
[2:31:42] rolling you know well like I say I was
[2:31:45] young but it was not foolish so I wasn't
[2:31:47] going to go up at 5:00 in the morning
[2:31:48] and Say Goodbye so I went the night
[2:31:50] before on the 17th of December to say
[2:31:53] goodbye to him and um wish him well so I
[2:31:56] go into his
[2:31:58] room and um we're we're talking a little
[2:32:01] bit and so there by the door is a chair
[2:32:04] and on the chair there's the blue jeans
[2:32:06] and the
[2:32:07] boots so I asked him what's this all
[2:32:11] about and he said
[2:32:14] well guy never knows when he might have
[2:32:16] car
[2:32:17] trouble well I knew that this guy never
[2:32:19] had car trouble because he kept his cars
[2:32:21] in perfect condition and if you didn't
[2:32:24] know anything about cars you'd Wonder
[2:32:26] okay which one's the new one which one's
[2:32:27] the one that's two years old he traded
[2:32:30] because had a lot of miles on it you see
[2:32:32] he wasn't uh arrogant they needed a new
[2:32:34] car but he wanted something that didn't
[2:32:36] have so many miles so anyway he was on
[2:32:38] his way back to pick up the new station
[2:32:41] wagon I didn't say anymore he didn't say
[2:32:44] anymore but with within 24 hours he'd
[2:32:47] had a terrible head-on collision with
[2:32:49] the drunk
[2:32:50] driver the other guy died right there
[2:32:54] and you've heard the whole story how
[2:32:55] that he was in the hospital so we flew
[2:32:57] over on Sunday I got in to see him once
[2:33:01] now because of the injuries he had a
[2:33:03] trachea he couldn't speak and they had
[2:33:06] the head all bandaged up and I don't
[2:33:09] know if he was conscious of people
[2:33:10] coming and going who knows but in that
[2:33:14] intensive carrier unit there in amarel
[2:33:18] Texas there were 12 beds and during the
[2:33:21] six days that he was there the other 11
[2:33:23] got better and
[2:33:25] left but on the 24th of December God
[2:33:28] said that's enough and he took him now
[2:33:31] see that wasn't in the plan because the
[2:33:33] way I heard things this messenger Behold
[2:33:37] the Lamb of God well that's not the way
[2:33:39] it worked out was it and so then we you
[2:33:43] know had to deal with all that now we
[2:33:46] got got to fly um sister brandom on a
[2:33:49] stretcher her daughter Sarah on a
[2:33:51] stretcher and two you know ambulance
[2:33:53] planes back to Indiana planned for a
[2:33:56] funeral well since I wasn't a blood
[2:33:58] relative I couldn't stay I had to go
[2:33:59] back to the service but the um the uh
[2:34:04] fact is that they had the uh
[2:34:06] funeral and uh you know brother Bram
[2:34:10] says here he says you're going to find
[2:34:12] out one of these days that when you go
[2:34:13] to heaven you don't fly off somewhere
[2:34:15] else you're still right here just in
[2:34:17] another dimension faster than this
[2:34:20] they're not far away you
[2:34:23] see and so we were like the disciples we
[2:34:26] were desponding no direction now what
[2:34:28] the leader's gone you know um so on on
[2:34:33] December the 29th they had the the
[2:34:36] funeral but sister Brandon was hurt so
[2:34:38] bad in this accident that she couldn't
[2:34:41] decide if the burial should be in
[2:34:43] Jeffersonville where they had their life
[2:34:45] or in Tucson where they had their new
[2:34:47] house and Billy sure wasn't going to
[2:34:49] decide so the funeral director said we
[2:34:52] have a place we'll keep him and uh when
[2:34:55] you all decide we'll have a burial okay
[2:34:58] so time passes I'm in the Army I'm far
[2:35:01] away from all
[2:35:02] this and um the uh fact is that they
[2:35:07] they chose Monday the 11th of April for
[2:35:11] the burial right after Easter you know
[2:35:14] the word says in 2 Timothy 1:7 for God
[2:35:16] has not given it the spirit of fear but
[2:35:18] of power and of love and a sound mind it
[2:35:22] doesn't say anything about foolish
[2:35:24] calculations does it and in Philippians
[2:35:26] 4:7 and the peace of God which passes
[2:35:28] all the things you can understand will
[2:35:31] keep your hearts and Minds through
[2:35:33] Christ Jesus well it during this time
[2:35:36] that we learned to pray we learned to
[2:35:38] listen we learned what he said we became
[2:35:41] anchored in the word in the prophetic
[2:35:42] word and the written word you know and
[2:35:45] so God God was on the scene because with
[2:35:47] God there's no surprises you know the
[2:35:51] missionary work began in Earnest you see
[2:35:52] back then when brother bandam left there
[2:35:55] were no message
[2:35:57] churches there was a family here a
[2:35:59] family there a little group over there
[2:36:01] nothing like
[2:36:02] this you know and so um time passes okay
[2:36:08] we get down to March of
[2:36:10] 66 and I had my training now as a cook
[2:36:16] and I knew where I was
[2:36:17] headed Rebecca was in Tucson watching
[2:36:20] after her mother her brother her
[2:36:23] sister learning to do all these things
[2:36:26] and
[2:36:27] um and so I called her one Wednesday I
[2:36:30] think it was and I said let's get
[2:36:31] married next
[2:36:32] Tuesday okay so we went home we had a
[2:36:36] private ceremony at the house and guess
[2:36:39] what my mother couldn't be there she
[2:36:41] couldn't be at the wedding of her
[2:36:43] firstborn because she was in false labor
[2:36:45] with with number
[2:36:47] 10 and the baby was born 2 months
[2:36:50] later now see I'm a man I don't
[2:36:52] understand that you would think after 10
[2:36:53] you'd know what's what no it doesn't
[2:36:55] work that
[2:36:56] way so um we were married on March the
[2:37:00] 30th
[2:37:02] 1966 and we took our honeymoon back up
[2:37:05] through the Grand Canyon and go back to
[2:37:07] Jeffersonville and so we're there for
[2:37:09] the uh funeral the burial of March of
[2:37:13] April the 11th 1966
[2:37:16] six
[2:37:18] and during brother Billy Paul's lifetime
[2:37:21] he always kept a very close relationship
[2:37:24] with his grandmother which was Hope's
[2:37:27] mother but this lady never went to
[2:37:29] church she never showed any emotions she
[2:37:32] was a very hard person what they tell me
[2:37:35] so when he goes to to the burial on this
[2:37:38] on this day he leaves his two little
[2:37:41] bitty boys with Grandma and he goes over
[2:37:43] to the burial that was a rainy day day
[2:37:46] just a just a drizzly rainy day and so
[2:37:49] he lives he's over at the burial and
[2:37:52] then he goes back to pick up his
[2:37:54] boys and um he sees his grandmother
[2:37:58] coming out of the back room wiping her
[2:38:02] eyes first time he'd ever see her
[2:38:05] cry and she said even the heavens weep
[2:38:08] for that
[2:38:14] man
[2:38:17] I remember those
[2:38:19] things when it's a rainy day but you see
[2:38:23] at that
[2:38:24] time when brother brand was in that
[2:38:27] hospital there was no lack of prayer and
[2:38:30] we didn't have cell phones it was dimes
[2:38:31] in the machine you know quarters and
[2:38:34] everybody was praying and well there's a
[2:38:35] lot of calculations he can't die and all
[2:38:37] this stuff a lot of faith but God had a
[2:38:41] program it wasn't because of the lack of
[2:38:43] anybody's
[2:38:44] Faith so any we have this burial then we
[2:38:47] left that afternoon we flew to
[2:38:50] California and uh on the 15th okay now
[2:38:54] we been married two weeks on the 15th of
[2:38:56] April I flew off to Vietnam for one year
[2:38:59] I was over there in a hospital it was
[2:39:02] dirt hospital it was not anything fancy
[2:39:05] and so here I was a cook at this place
[2:39:07] it's 100 degrees every day it seemed
[2:39:08] like and um that was a trial by fire no
[2:39:12] phone no vacation only letters that's
[2:39:15] all we had for one
[2:39:17] year now Rebecca's home learning how to
[2:39:20] cook how to clean how to do all these
[2:39:22] things and take care of her mother and
[2:39:23] her brother and her sister so by the
[2:39:26] time I got home a year later she was
[2:39:28] fully
[2:39:30] trained but um during that year it was
[2:39:33] only letters you see this Bible is God's
[2:39:36] love letter to you and I got these love
[2:39:39] letters and you guys that are you know
[2:39:40] over 40 years old you remember when
[2:39:43] you're used to write letters see today
[2:39:44] they can't even spell they text these
[2:39:46] little words you know but back then we
[2:39:48] wrote letters put a stamp on it hope it
[2:39:50] gets there so I'd get these
[2:39:52] letters it was addressed to me so I'd go
[2:39:56] off by myself I'd smell it wow smells
[2:40:00] just like her you know then I'd read it
[2:40:02] several times I look between the
[2:40:04] lines yeah those were the old
[2:40:06] days and so
[2:40:09] um God kept me clean during all that
[2:40:12] time all these other guys who doing all
[2:40:14] kinds of foolish things I was living for
[2:40:18] Christ and so got back home in April of
[2:40:24] 67 and then we had six more months left
[2:40:27] in the military got out of the military
[2:40:29] started translating the messages into
[2:40:31] Spanish and that's been our life ever
[2:40:34] since well we got to fast forward
[2:40:38] here by October of
[2:40:41] 2006 um by then we had you know we had
[2:40:44] our three children
[2:40:46] uh two of them were
[2:40:47] married and we'd been many places we
[2:40:50] lived in Canada we lived in Venezuela
[2:40:52] and Mexico different places but by
[2:40:54] October of 2006 Rebecca was very very
[2:40:57] ill she uh started with a cancer on the
[2:41:01] um kidney took that out two years later
[2:41:04] it appeared on the lung so by October of
[2:41:07] 2006 she suffered a lot of things now
[2:41:10] there was no lack of faith there's no
[2:41:12] lack of prayer I remember receiving a
[2:41:15] letter from the church in Legos there's
[2:41:17] 700 people here on their faces praying
[2:41:20] that was everywhere so it wasn't because
[2:41:22] nobody was caring but God had a program
[2:41:26] he was working out you see and so um
[2:41:30] during this time of course she's you
[2:41:31] know inching closer and closer to the
[2:41:33] river all the medicine everything we
[2:41:35] could do we were
[2:41:37] doing but this wasn't just anybody this
[2:41:40] is somebody lived with William Brandon
[2:41:41] for 20 years she knew what faith was she
[2:41:42] knew what Miracles were and uh I said
[2:41:45] now you know that God can heal you in
[2:41:48] the next 10 minutes and put you back
[2:41:51] 100% but if he chooses to take you then
[2:41:54] you get with your dad and you wait for
[2:41:55] me
[2:41:56] there well a week later I think it was
[2:41:59] we got a call from a a sister up in West
[2:42:02] Virginia a friend of ours and she called
[2:42:05] to tell me that uh that day she was
[2:42:09] getting up from the noon meal and right
[2:42:12] there across the table was a vision and
[2:42:14] she said in this vision I saw brother
[2:42:16] Brandon a big Congregation of people and
[2:42:18] he's preaching faith and the prayer
[2:42:20] Line's lined up and he's preaching faith
[2:42:22] and all of a sudden he looks from where
[2:42:24] he was to where I was to another
[2:42:27] dimension and I warn you don't speak
[2:42:29] against it it does happen and so she
[2:42:33] says and you little sister thank you for
[2:42:37] praying for my daughter
[2:42:38] Rebecca and tell George everything's
[2:42:40] going to be
[2:42:44] okay
[2:42:47] that's when you start to pay
[2:42:49] attention and so I realized this might
[2:42:52] not work out the way I want it but it's
[2:42:53] going to be
[2:42:54] okay
[2:42:56] well
[2:42:58] um on the 28th of November of 06 coming
[2:43:02] up 10 years now the Lord took her and I
[2:43:05] said blessed be the name of the Lord he
[2:43:07] knows best you know and before you ask
[2:43:10] no I'm not going to get
[2:43:13] remarried so um after the
[2:43:17] funeral I remember praying I said Lord
[2:43:20] keep me
[2:43:21] balanced keep me focused on beyond the
[2:43:25] curtain and keep me busy and he has kept
[2:43:28] me
[2:43:29] busy in I think it was in 2010 I was in
[2:43:33] 18 countries in one year so we go and we
[2:43:36] try to be a blessing to somebody I'm not
[2:43:39] preaching Mysteries I'm not preaching
[2:43:41] Doctrine we have tapes but people need
[2:43:43] encouraging because it's been a long a
[2:43:45] long time and it's start they're
[2:43:46] starting to say well it's been so long
[2:43:48] where's the promise of his coming all
[2:43:49] these things these same tapes relax
[2:43:52] God's in control you see and
[2:43:56] so time passes like I say we were
[2:44:00] married just over 40 years I got three
[2:44:01] children three
[2:44:03] grandchildren and when I was over in in
[2:44:06] the
[2:44:07] Congo uh I was over there in uh the
[2:44:10] church with brother Vib Dilla uh two
[2:44:14] three years ago whenever it was
[2:44:15] and so I was there for the Sunday School
[2:44:18] report and they uh said there's 4,700
[2:44:22] present Bibles
[2:44:24] 250 oh got to help these poor people you
[2:44:27] know so I talked to the pastor later no
[2:44:31] problem he says we have money we're
[2:44:33] building this church for 7,000 people
[2:44:36] and it's not sticks it's all concrete
[2:44:38] you know we have money um and um he says
[2:44:43] they sell Bibles right over there but
[2:44:45] the people can't
[2:44:46] read oh is that a
[2:44:49] fact yeah over there in that area
[2:44:52] 20% people can read in the big cities
[2:44:56] maybe 80% so I start to question wow
[2:44:59] what about all this millions of dollars
[2:45:01] of printing something's not right well
[2:45:03] I'm not in charge of that part but
[2:45:05] anyway then during church people keep
[2:45:08] coming in because they live way out
[2:45:10] there with 6,000 people you look out
[2:45:12] there and there's five cars
[2:45:15] and there's about 200 motorcycles and
[2:45:18] and a th000 bicycles everybody else
[2:45:20] walked you know and so I get finished
[2:45:23] speaking brother B little jumps up and
[2:45:24] he says now has anybody got any question
[2:45:27] oh yeah 6,000 people I guess so so they
[2:45:29] start asking the questions and
[2:45:31] translating it and going back and forth
[2:45:32] the only question I remember one sister
[2:45:35] says well since the Lord took your wife
[2:45:37] why are you still wearing the
[2:45:39] ring wow people notice
[2:45:42] everything you know I said said uh well
[2:45:45] because my commitment to Rebecca wasn't
[2:45:47] just until death do you part it's for
[2:45:49] eternity oh okay
[2:45:56] yeah so yeah we're we're definitely
[2:45:59] staying busy and my advice to you all
[2:46:03] because I am the Elder of most of you um
[2:46:07] make your wife happy make her laugh
[2:46:10] every day if she's just laughing it's
[2:46:13] your stupidity but make laugh you know
[2:46:17] and um uh you know there's a formula we
[2:46:20] think what's 50/50 when you get married
[2:46:22] no that's a lie because if it's 50/50
[2:46:25] then when you go to bed at night you got
[2:46:27] to wonder huh did I win did she win who
[2:46:30] won no no no it's 8020 you give 80%
[2:46:35] hoping she gives you 20 she's giving 80%
[2:46:38] hoping you give her 20 everything works
[2:46:40] fine I'm not saying I always did it but
[2:46:42] it does
[2:46:44] work so look people are watching you
[2:46:46] every day they're watching your
[2:46:47] Christianity the the scripture says by
[2:46:50] this shall all men know that you belong
[2:46:53] to me because you carry a King James
[2:46:55] Bible I don't think so because you got
[2:46:59] you know a picture or even this picture
[2:47:02] that's not how they're going to know
[2:47:03] they're going to know by the love we
[2:47:05] have one to another that's why I love
[2:47:07] these conventions because it puts us in
[2:47:09] one room in one Accord we eat together
[2:47:12] we sleep we love each other
[2:47:15] that's what it's all about by this shall
[2:47:17] all may know that you're my disciples if
[2:47:19] you have love one to
[2:47:21] another
[2:47:23] now there's something I promise to read
[2:47:25] to the ministers here before we get
[2:47:28] finished and this is on the tape the
[2:47:31] zerit of
[2:47:33] spirit you need to put this on your
[2:47:35] refrigerator at home need to read it
[2:47:37] every day it's the prayer at the
[2:47:39] beginning of the tape our heavenly
[2:47:42] father I want to express if I can this
[2:47:44] morning
[2:47:45] how in my heart I feel towards one the
[2:47:48] holiest of holy coming down to earth and
[2:47:51] to redeem a sinner like
[2:47:53] myself and I'm sure that these ministers
[2:47:55] that's present now can feel the same way
[2:47:58] it was by your grace that we have made
[2:48:00] been been made Ministers of this
[2:48:02] Covenant that thou has given to Adam's
[2:48:04] Fallen
[2:48:06] race and we are here this morning Father
[2:48:09] gathered for no other
[2:48:12] purpose but to know and to study to know
[2:48:16] rather the will of God and what we must
[2:48:19] do to make Christ real to the people of
[2:48:22] this
[2:48:23] generation that's the whole program
[2:48:26] right there not how smart I am how much
[2:48:29] I suffered how much I spent how I can
[2:48:31] make Christ real to the people of this
[2:48:34] generation knowing surely that in the
[2:48:36] day of the Judgment we will be brought
[2:48:38] face to face with this generation and
[2:48:41] being ministers we will be judges and
[2:48:44] the people to of which we have
[2:48:45] spoken and their attitude towards the
[2:48:48] word which we bring them will determine
[2:48:51] their Eternal
[2:48:53] destination he gets very serious
[2:48:56] therefore Lord in that day we would be a
[2:48:58] judge for or against the generation that
[2:49:00] we preach to Father God please through
[2:49:03] Jesus name let us not say one word that
[2:49:05] would be wrong but may we have sincere
[2:49:08] hearts and open mind that we might
[2:49:10] receive the things that's yours that we
[2:49:12] might be able to go out into our
[2:49:13] different fields of work
[2:49:15] after today and be better equipped
[2:49:17] because of our meeting with you this
[2:49:20] morning that is very
[2:49:22] serious that's the only place you'll
[2:49:24] find that make Christ real to the people
[2:49:27] of this
[2:49:29] generation okay one more thing we're
[2:49:31] going to read here we'll be
[2:49:32] done 1960 he says years ago there was a
[2:49:36] writer Fanny
[2:49:37] Crosby and she was blind she didn't sell
[2:49:40] her Birthright like many fine singers
[2:49:42] today in the television movie world who
[2:49:44] have sold out their Birthright for a
[2:49:46] bunch of uh rock and roll she was
[2:49:49] different they came to her one day and
[2:49:51] they said why don't you write modern
[2:49:53] poetry she said I give all my talents to
[2:49:57] God well then you believe there's a
[2:49:59] heaven oh yeah you think you'll be there
[2:50:03] sure and when you get there if you
[2:50:05] remain blind how will you know
[2:50:08] him she said I'll feel the nail scars in
[2:50:11] his hand and then she turned and went
[2:50:14] back
[2:50:15] into her room and when she did she
[2:50:17] raised her hands and began to praise
[2:50:20] God and when those people left a song
[2:50:23] strucker she said I shall know him I
[2:50:25] shall know him and Redeemed by his side
[2:50:28] I shall stand I shall know him I shall
[2:50:31] know him by the prince of the nails in
[2:50:33] his hand then he goes on to say and

[2:50:37] the streets of
[2:50:38] Glory he's there with
[2:50:41] her the streets of Glory with far better

[2:50:51] would ask her tonight Fanny crows me
