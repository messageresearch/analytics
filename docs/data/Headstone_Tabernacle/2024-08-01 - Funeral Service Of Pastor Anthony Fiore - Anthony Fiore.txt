open by reading obit for my dad and share a couple of stories I think in talking to almost all of you here today the things that came most apparent was uh what was my dad about and I think there were two terms one is simple but not simple minded but uncomplicated everything was basic it was black it was white uh it was how he felt how he lived his life and how he interacted with everyone from his family to the church people and probably be a little bit different than some of the uh funeral service that we've had going ask uh for the dean to come up in a few minutes do an opening prayer we're going to have a couple of songs his granddaughter Abigail is going to sing a song uh we have brother the is going to say a few words Porsche is going to sing a song I'm going to come back and tell a few more stories about my dad and try to give you some more information of you know who he is to us what made him special and why there's so many of us here that are in memory and then asked a couple of other brothers that are here to come up and say a few words brother Wellington brother Co brother brother HTO we going to read uh some letters and testimonies for some special people in my Dad's life and then uh but Joey's going to sing a song and we're going to uh we we'll close the service on time so Anthony John Fury was uh known as Tony at work some of you knew as Nino or brother Fury or Reverend Fury he would have been 84 years old uh on July the 26th he was born in Brook in New York his father was John Anthony his mother was Pauline they called her Betty and he had a younger sister luil he married my mom meline April 15th 1961 as you know many of you would hear mom passed on July 31st last year and five children Timothy who's no longer here with us I'm Paul Lois John and Unice nine grandchildren Johanna Martha James Jonah Abigail Deborah Ro Isabella and Angelina and dad had four great grandchildren as well and survived by nephew s Anthony and so Anthony is that better well hopefully you all know the names of the kids and most the grand so Dad grew up in Brooklyn New York he met my mom in a church in I believe it was in in Brooklyn there's actually a letter from Brother Palomo that I'll read that'll have a little bit more uh color in detail on the early parts of my dad being saved and learning about church they moved to Queens Ozone Park in 1965 they moved to Westbury in 1977 and in 2000 they moved to digs Hills which was the final place for my dad and family for work uh is interesting I just talked with my dad a couple of days ago at the hospital maybe last week and asked him about his first job he was 16 years old in 1956 and he worked for the Brooklyn W wood heel Factory and dad had a grandmother named Anna Theona and she had seven grandson or children sons and one daughter the only daughter was my dad's mom and the the the sons were uh Joe William John Frank Vincent Tony and Angelo and Uncle William was my dad's favorite uncle and my dad was Uncle William's favorite I would think even as opposed to his children and his other grandchildren the ne he really love my dad and the Seven Brothers started the Brooklyn wood meal Factory so my dad that was his first experience at work um his he told me his first job was the wood heel Examiner a job that's not around anymore it means that you actually look at the final the factory would start with a tree the tree would be uh go through many processes and at the end would come out with a heel that would go on a man or a woman's shoes and my dad's first job was examining the heel to see if it was good enough to make it or to not make it so my dad turned out to be really good mechanically and very fast so he worked his way to the point where he had almost all the jobs at the wood heel Factory and interestingly my dad would always brag that the Brooklyn wood heel Factory was one of four factories all the other ones went out of business but they were the last ones to go out of business and I guess the the Plastics really came in and changed the world and the style changed and the last job my dad had was to go out to do sales at the woodill factory and talk to the shoe manufacturers and shoe makers to find out why uh but fortunately he was able to uh when that business went under he had a job at the New York City Transit Authority where he had a terrific career he started as a laborer and left as Deputy superintendent for the New York City Transit Authority and then he also had another job after retirement in a Morton Village in in Long Island but the biggest part and you may know about my dad was his church life so he actually his father was a Catholic pacan and it was very early on that my dad I guess influenced by his grandma Anna Bona would share with him scriptures and she was in a Pentecostal church and my dad would ask the priest why is he wearing such long garment and he would read him a scripture from the Bible basically saying you know you will not enlarge your garment uh but he was converted to uh Pentecostal Church as an Italian Pastor Nam Joseph Roma that ran the church and then where he met the the bomo family and from there you know they met brother Coleman in the 1960s were introduced to the message and dad had a you know long of course career with the local Christian Assembly started as a youth leader Deacon assistant pastor an elder and pastor and then in 2017 uh he was asked by several Believers to uh lead a new church called the United bride assembly and he was Pastor there in 2017 I guess I would finalize theary before some opening comments saying that you know that will be remembered for devotion Devotion to God Church his family in that order I would say he was a loyal humble dedicated and love those by all the encounter and I've heard many testimonies today from people telling me the first that they married they were married by my dad or performed his funeral service for someone in their family where he dedicated uh many people most people don't know he also started off praying on street corners and visiting prisons and hospitals and praying for people that were in need and hurt tremendous testimonies here early today so from people to functions and others that said that you know they were able to call 5: in the morning and have my dad stop everything he was doing to go out and business pray for for people I would say that stories was the most important part most important part of what my dad represented you know I open been talking about being simple and everything was simple for that you know um I remember we moved to Westbury Long Island there must have been 50 families that moved after we moved but it seemed like the right thing to do Queens was getting prowed Long Island seems safer home values are starting to move up and dad was a leader in that way where maybe didn't go to college and he didn't learn about Finance but he seemed to know the right thing to do right he was the first to buy solar panels on the roof the first buy electric car with the Teslas just little things that he did that for him it just simple and it made sense and he was able to you know follow his heart and do it so that's the obituary and you hear on story what was my dad that was his home life his family life his church life and some of the big things uh that he matter but I don't think he giv the details of exactly who who he was and you know so one thing I want to point out is that Dad was touched okay many of you may know that he's a Leo and he was a fighter you may know nebor drank didn't gamble didn't smoke didn't do drugs but you may not know that he never even took aspirin it was very very rare even if you had a headache or some pain and even at the end when I visited that the hospital last week uh they were surprised to hear that he wasn't on pain medications and he wasn't in in pain when they sent them home uh I remember one time we were in Seldon Long Island and um there was a tenant in the house that was gifted from my mom's grandmother and the tenants weren't paying rent and we were all in the car we were all very little and we I guess we were going to go to a convention my mom was very afraid that dad was going to get into an argument going out but he took the person that was in the house and basically said you're not paying rent you got to get out and then apparently this guy's brother-in-law who was very muscular he like pushed everyone aside and came to the front and said is there a problem and my dad grabs the guy by the shirt and said yes there's a problem if you don't get out I'm putting all the furniture on the street you look like you got muscles you're going to help me we're going to take all but Dad mellowed out because I bought a house in Brooklyn and I moved to California and my tenant wasn't paying rent so I sent my dad out to talk him Don tells me that Dad went there found out the guy was at a job as a bus driver and he prayed for him I think the biggest thing about Dad is his love for nature and maybe it was the first job he had where he with wood talking to brother M whimple in the earlier service and he saying that Dad could talk for one hour about wood I never told him that we would take wood and paint it over with different colors it would drive him crazy he would always if he ever found wood that was painted he would stand it down bring it down to what he thought was the you know was the the natural may I know that Dad was a barber and taught me patience because with three kids couldn't afford to get everyone haircuts and Dad learned how to be a part and Tim and I and John would feel such empathy with the other one so it was my turn to get a haircut they would like propop me up and give me candy because it was going to be a onh hour process my dad didn't want us to go to school with like cut hair and get made fun of but you know very very was very patient took his job took his time uh dad was also a mechanic he could fix almost anything he started off as a carpenter but he could fix locks he could do cement work do almost anything and his I mentioned earlier one of his uncles was Uncle William and Uncle William when he died he left my dad all his tools so he's got every tool has cared the letter W for William uh on the tool and it's truly was the prize possession for his uncle William had his own shop and when you know my dad uh you know took over the pools he was very proud to have them but he could do almost any type of um of job I remember the one story he told us he was at the transit authority he was just learning how unions work and there was a broken lock on the locker and my dad could fix it so he waited to see if they were going to fix it and the union didn't fix it so my dad like took off the lock and was going to repair it himself and that was it the union came they stopped at a whole job they had to rope everything off people had to go into a different entrance for 3 months because a carpenter who's in the carpenter Union was now trying to fix a lot that was done by a different Union so dad was dad was a mechanic and dad was also an artist um not a good professional artist like brother Carl but talk to brother Carl Thompson earlier he was caring that my dad told him he wanted to paint the road toas which is the story when two disciples were walking to Jerusalem to mayus and the Gospel of Luke Jesus joined them after the resurrection and brother Carl tried to talk my dad out of painting the pain he said that it was too hard um he might want to start with something less ambitious um but he said I have it you know in my heart to make that pain did and brother Carl was sharing the story with with me that when he came up after I think four or 6 months to see the final painting but Carl told my dad that he's retiring his paint brushes he doesn't want to paint anymore because my dad truly did a beautiful job and the BS are here my dad gave that painting to them because they were very special in my Dad's life BS thank you very much it was um I told Brother both brother Ram you know having that in their hand is a is special to show that my dad you know took his most prized possession just like Uncle William didn't give it to his kids you know my dad gave that pain B said God bless you by the way I don't think my dad did another picture after he painted the road toas he retired as an artist so brother Kevin would you mind coming up I'm going to um I have a several more stories I'd like to share but I'd like to first ask uh Brother Dean to come up and say an opening prayer um and then we're going to have uh help lead us in two songs we're going to have a couple of other songs and then I'd like to come back and share a few more stories like that de shall We Stand dear heavenly father we gathered here this evening Lord God to say by Lord to your servant brother Anthony fiori Lord God father what a blessing he

welcome to the homegoing service for my precious Pastor brother Anthony bori aside from being my pastor brother Anthony Fury was a father figure to me he was a role model and he was a servant of Christ as many of you know brother Fury endured many hardships in life he lost a granddaughter a son and less than a year ago he lost his wife amen but through it all like job brother Fury kept on serving his Lord Brother Fury was was such a good man that God continually boasted about him he told Satan I give you permission to test how faithful my servant Anthony fiori would be if he had to endure loss grief pain I know brother Anthony brother Anthony fiori will come through it am for the Fiori's ability I believe in the Lord Almighty was so impressive that he exed evil his life story continued to be revent today because of his ability to believe in the Lord despite his sufferings why do innocent people like brother Fury go through the sufferings that he went through we do not know but what we do know is like job brother Fury did not commit sin that led to his sufferings his sufferings came about as God allowed Satan to test his faith job represents the truth that innocent people suffer but at the end of the story it it always shows that God was in control the entire time amen God allowed Satan to attack job spiritually emotionally and physically amen amen but job kept on serving God brother fi did the same brother F's grandson Jonah fiori wrote on Facebook these lines my grandfather was an exemplary role model a loving father and grandfather and most importantly a loyal follower of Christ Jonah also wrote he was an example of what a man of God is and he was known for his captivating storytelling and his effective teachings of Jesus Christ brother Fury has gone on to be with the Lord he has taken the cup of Salvation and he called upon the name of the Lord precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints he was God's servant and he offered sacrifices of praise and thanksgiving to God continually Paul John Lo's Unice all the grandchildren everyone related by blood or marriage Porche my girls and I wish to offer our deepest condolences and our sincerest of and our sincerest of sympathies to you all rest assured brother Fury is in the hands of God brother Bram said in questions and answers number four this quote was read by Brother stephanus Cor in TR that recently this is a dying spirit in a dying body but now you can't be in two bodies at one time but there can be two Natures in you at one time now now the nature of the spirit of the Lord when you are born again you're not born a physical like the baby was but what happened the spiritual Birth has come to you and while this spiritual birth is grown into your heart of God there's a physical or a Celestial body growing to receive that spirit and when the life leaves this body like it has left brother brother Anthony fur it goes to that body so brother Anthony Fury has Celestial body now amen just as when the body is presented on the earth the spirit comes in and when the spirit goes out of the body there's a body waiting for we know that after this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one waiting hallelujah praise the Lord amen ladies and gentlemen brothers and sisters behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed in a

the whole world and lose his own soul in 197 4 Brother Joseph Coleman had just done finished preaching and everyone was rejoicing about the mighty service that had gone forth sister Coleman looked at brother fiori and she saw that he was bubbling she turned to him and she asked brother Fury what are you thinking about what you thought about that message that just came forth brother Fury replied are you kidding me that's the Thunders he was the first to catch the inspiration of the seven tunders at the local Christian Assembly brothers and sisters Matthew 25 exemp exemplified brother brother fiori for I was hungry and you fed me I was thirsty and you give me something to drink I was a stranger and you invited me in I needed clothes and you clothed me I was sick and you looked after me I was in prison and you came to visit me serving folks is like serving God Galatians 6:10 says therefore as we have the opportunity let us do good to all people especially to those who belong to the family of Believers brothers and sisters I've spoken to many people this week brother Paul just just said that in his cant and they told me how brother Fury prayed for them and the miraculous took and the miraculous took place he prayed for many people with cancer and God healed them we will never forget the story he told us repeatedly about his son Paul's his son Paul's girlfriend we remember him praying for brother shabz I saw brother shabz here this afternoon God raised him from the dead ladies and gentlemen brothers and sisters before I leave do you belong to the family of Believers brother Anthony fiori was working at the MTA he was such a good worker without a college education he became a tough manager at the mpa though he was a manager and a big and a big huno he was still a Christian one day while working he saw a man a fellow MTA employee reading his Bible what did this manager do he introduced himself to the fellow worker and asked him if he had a revelation of what he was reading the fellow employee replied maybe you can tell me some more about what I'm reading about brother Fury proceeded to tell him about the love of Jesus and how he died on the cross for him I can imagine brother Theory began to talk to him about the rages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life then then brother Fury began to read to him Romans 8 and before I leave I would like to read some of the some of the verses from Romans chap Romans chapter chapter 8 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are Christ Jesus who walked not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus ha made us free from the law of sin and death for what the Lord could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemns sin in the flesh verse 10 and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies verse 17 and if children then hears PR of God and join he with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US verse 26 likewise the spirit also helped our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered that person that brother Fury was talking to at the MTA was brother Anthony the Mayo brother Anthony De Mayo his wife sister Helen de Mayo their daughter Adrian hers and their son Larry de Mayo all came to accept Jesus Christ as their precious Lord and personal savior brother Anthony fur we witness to brother Anthony Deo and four stars were added to his crown God bless you brother Anthony Fury I will see you in a morning I'd like to bring my wife forth sister Porsha CED she will sing a song requested by the family entitled shelter in the arms of God I feel the T of hands so kind and tender they're teaching me imps that I was strong I'll have no fear when Jesus walk besides me for I'm sh in the arms of gold so let the storms rain High the dark clouds rise day wor me for I'm sheltered in arm of God and all the Earth can't har me for I am shelter in G soon I shall hear the call from Heaven's portal come home my child it's the last time you I fall asleep and wait in God's new heaven for

sheltered in The Arms Of God for I'm shed in the arms of thank you Abigail Porsche thank Brother Dean like to tell you a few more uh things about my dad I think you all get to see him mostly on a Sunday but Don Lois Unice and I get to be there every day and we found out we were clearing out some of the things in the house and we found out that dad was a poet not very often I don't think he ever wrote uh something that I said but we found a u Timothy's sixth grade graduation book you know where everyone writes their uh little note so I'd like to read you my dad wrote for my brother to two caveats we have a dog named Dobby and Dad wasn't the best at grammar in 1976 so this is a letter from my dad to Tim when you was just a little boy you had so many ideas you was the first to make some toys that gave us many fears you seem to be like Dobby we thought you were very naughty but you were never was much trouble we will love you till you're 40 you will always be that boy of ours so big so smart so kind and when we look back at those hours we know we'll always find only sweet memories we see that time cannot destroy to us you will always be our precious little boy beautiful beauti my dad when he did read poetry eily remembered it by heart I want to share a couple uh with you usually the themes were very simple and this one is no exception could we with ink the ocean fill and where the Skies of parchment made where every stock on earth a quill and every man a scribe by trade to write the love of God above would drain the ocean dry nor could the scroll contain the hole there no stretch from Sky to Sky Does anyone hurt my dad Shar that that phone and I think he loved it because it was simple um but I also think he loved it because they discovered that that line was on the walls penciled on a narrow room in insane asylum and it was from man that was said to be demented and um you know I believe my dad believes that if you're inspired uh that's all that matters and it's a simple poem about the love of God Joyce Gilmer wrote a song in 1915 called trees does anyone have heard that that poem so I was here in New York less than a month and a half ago and I asked my dad what his favorite scriptures were his favorite songs his favorite poems and he told me this poem that he was able to recite it by memory from the and he got emotional as he RS and apple doesn't fall far from the tree hopefully I'll make it through as well I think that I shall never see a poem lovely as a tree a tree whose hungry mouth is pressed against the Earth's sweet flowing breast a tree that looks at God all day and lifts her leafy arms to pray a tree that may in summer wear a nest of robins in her hair upon whose bosom snow has Lain who intimately lives with rain hes are made by fools like me but only God can make it tree I think Dad loved that PO included all the things that he loved number one it was nature number two it had wood and trees and it was a subtle message that we're all frail and unworthy but God is perfect in the fact that he loves us is all that matters I think that was also uh funny I asked John Lois and Unice to all share stories and we were all just around the table talking about our dad and uh unas and ask you to come up here honey unas shared her favorite story was that I was always the skinny one in the family so when Dad bought boxing gloves cuz we used to fight all the time when he would introduce me he would say the light light light lightweight introduced me so you share that story and the just found something about on the internet about D you would like to he never loed for Praises he was never one to the boo he just went on quietly working for the ones he loved the most his dreams were seldom spoken his once were very few and most of the time his worries went unspoken too he was there a permer foundation through all our storms of life a sturdy hand to hold on to in times of stress and strife a true friend we can turn to when times were good or bad one of our greatest blessings the man that we call dead thank you din John's going to hate me but I'll tell the story he remembered where he told our dad the first joke John I think was a little intimidated by uh dad as the youngest child but apparently my dad was sharing the story of the unfortunate man that died because his yard came in and he fell in the sess and John said that was a crappy way to go and and Dad laugh show sense of hum and Lois shared a story we were going to pen Harris and uh you know we were my dad told us at a time you know he's very my dad was very simple you didn't play ball on Sunday you going to a convention it's not about going to the Hershey Park on the way home and we're here for church we're here for convention so you know basically my dad lectured us for the whole ride there how don't even ask to go to so Jonathan and Lois and Joey they all nominated me to be the negotiators to see if I can soften my dad and go so the convention was over and I said I'll go over there I'll talk to Dad so I went over there and I didn't realize we were that close but apparently loest and everyone could hear my Dad's reaction all they heard was are you kidding me we just came back from this most beautiful convention you have the nerve to has and anyway 20 minute diet fry like how ungrateful and I am told me apparently when I came back they were all shoulders down ejected and I told you know I didn't know they heard the conversation so I said don't worry guys I think we have a chance and dad was loyal but there's lot of things he wasn't right he was not Sports lot of football baseball basketball fans here and he had no particular team that he cared about but it he was loyal to New York in general I don't think he cared if it was Upstate New York and Buffalo or it was the Giants or Deads he loved that the New York team would win he was also proud to being a Italian but I don't think it didn't Define him at all and one of the things I heard from many of you throughout the day was if you came in to the church with long hair a hippie um an immigrant minority in any way there was no he felt better than anybody else he greeted everybody the same the same way he was especially loyal to my mom and to his family and I could truly say that I've never seen my dad and mom fight but Sandy you we Sandy he told us a story apparently there was a Mother's Day Dad forgot to get Mom a Mother's Day card and gift and when she called him out on it he said well you're not my mom I have I already have them very very bad apparently Sandy saw the only fight they ever had of course dad was loyal to his friends and he especially um loyal to God and there was a a favorite song that that he also had is Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved the Wretch like Me I once was lost but now I'm found was blind but now I see how much more simple does it come right the song is 250 years old it was written by John Newton in 1772 and he was a slave traitor that converted to Angelic faith and wrote that song as a part of the songs that he wrote as part of his conversion and Dad loved simple stories with simple themes and with that I've asked a few brothers that my dad loved and respected if they would be willing to share a story or two and I'd like to invite for the Norman please come up and maybe share a story um difficult for all of us it's very emotional you know we love our dad be bear bear with us and then brother Jonathan I'll have you come after brother Norman and then yeah you can come up here you go next Norman mind brother Norman you start first and then brother U ail Norman wellton bless one and all my first encounter with brother Fury first I saw me in didn't know me I came to love with Christian Assembly and before we enter the sanctuary there's a sign of door poost says be still and know that I am God I read that and I walk in the sanctuary the first words I can remember himar brother FY says there is no such thing as divorce now how does man know what's on my heart now the reason why that was on my heart was I just left Pentecost and the preacher there was teaching that you couldn't divorce your wife and get married again watch this the living so at the church I went to him and said no that's wrong you can't do that he said yes this why I understand you can do it so that was on Wednesday night service Thursday Friday it bugged me so Saturday I went took my Bible I went to his house and he tells me listen if you come to my house to augue scripture don't come here he said David Salomon all them had more than one wife okay you got me I don't understand that okay so I came to the message brother brandham says that reason why they had more than one wife is a type of Christ and his bride around the world now now to me when brother F said that there's no such in divorce be still and know that I'm God what manifested to me right there to know that this man here don't know what's on my heart don't know me and he's come out and say that so to me that man has was filled with the Holy Ghost and God was there God that's my first encounter with him now brother Fury he love love the stories when he's preaching he telling stories some people don't like it they call it storytelling but for me that is testimony amen something that he went through now brother Bram I can't remember one of his message that he never stop and give a testimony or so story to me that was great okay now I want to read this scripture here this is Brother Fury all the way it's en TI is 1539 for this cause that I the that thou sh that thou shouldest ordain the things that are wanting and ordain Elders in every city as I have ordained thee if any be blameless the husband of one wife that's got a fe blameless husband of one wife have been hateful children they are here not accused of Riot or unruly for a bishop must be blameless as a steward of God not self-will is always about God never hear him said me me me it's always the will of God not soon anger not given to Wine Not Striker not given to fil to lust but the level of hospitality that is preder amen again is why when you first meet him the way they greet you is like they know you for long time make you feel so comfortable a lover of Good Men sober just holy tempering holding fast the faithful word as he had been taught that he may be able by some Doctrine both to sort and to convert the gainsayers praise God Jonathan Coler privilege that he's able to come here all the way from Germany to the fiori family on behalf of the Coler family we want to express our AR of condolences to you Paul and John Lou and Unice and all the grandchildren and those that are married and blood related on the homegoing of our precious of your precious dad brother Anthony fiori and brother stephanus also asked me to convey this deep syphony so to you God bless you you are in our thoughts and you are have been in our prayers during this time of loss we know what it means to say goodbye to my precious dad and brother fiori he has been a close friend to my dad brother Sigma cener they met I believe in the late 970s and they were special friends ever since he even came to our home in Germany and I believe some conventions and they went together in the Alps and I remember my mom she was telling me the fury one time he was in a store back then in the Ops and um they seen he seen my parents looking from the outside into um the store the little shop and there was some very nice two little squirrels and by that time my parents really couldn't afford any extra so by the time we were they were home again brother FY handed them the two squirels and um those two squirrels are actually still in our home wow remembering brother Fury his heart of given and the same I remember my dad he was telling me as it was mentioned with a f was an artist that um in his study there's two pictures one with uh um Jesus and the rich Y buer and the other one is actually um Jesus with the two disciples to mes and I believe that was the template the blueprint I think he say of that picture that he painted from so again it shows his heart of given um all in all they had precious time of Fellowship together especially at the conventions where they met here after year personally um when I think back about brother the fury as a young person growing up I experienced him as a man of prayer his dedication stood out to me and as he prayed for the prayer requests of the people the Lord answered many of his prayers amen amen and many received their healing and deliverance through his prayers and through his ministry amen just in fact actually yesterday I met a couple and they had expressed how that brother through brother Fiori's prayer it has helped them to have two healthy boys that's right and it's just so beautiful to see so many answered prayers even today the testimonies come back but brother Fury not only had a great burden for the healing of the Natural Body um of the people but he also was concerned about the body of Christ I remember in 2013 he was um calling my dad or they were speaking on the phone together and he encouraged him through a quote in the message the prophet actually mentions that he entered into vision and um he heard a voice saying preacher don't fear there'll be one one of these days so he was also a person that could encourage just one another I think the last time that um they had Fellowship together with in 2019 my dad had visited the home of the fues and um they were driving around he was showing him his new Tesla I just wish he could have driven it in the German highway but I think they both love cars I think so nice cars um but he was sharing his burden about the healing of the body of Christ and they had this in common I know that meant so much to my dad who had a big burden that the love of God will be expressed among the children of God I just want to join everyone to express our thanks to God for a man whose life touched many lives around the world and he was a faithful true witness to his calling his in his influence on our family remains and we as a family appreciated him very much his humble way his kind way and his love to everybody and allow me to to say like we say back home in German we say oh Fe Us in we'll see you in the morning bless you thank you brother brother Gabriel God bless you everyone I'm happy to give a little word of testimony about my brother Fury brother Fury was one of a kind his life his whole life was about Jesus Christ and uh a life of service a life of Education to Christ and uh you've always felt loved around him you always felt that Gentle Spirit and uh we've known brother Fury my wife and I ever since uh 1976 I remember to go to a convention in New York I believe it was in uh yeah I think it was in New York yeah and um we stayed that the fues and we watched them the way they they were his wife and him and uh the family and all we felt was the the spirit of Jesus Christ we had come out of a church where there was sin and now we looked at those people people whose life was the life of Jesus Christ so we felt so so relieved we felt so happy to get acquainted with them and we've been friends musim friends ever since 3 weeks ago I called him each time I would call him I would uh it would make me feel good because this man was something else so simple so humble would never judge people amen would never criticize so I said how are you brother fur he said his voice was like a little TI I knew he was going to to leave I just felt it in his voice I just St the witness that he would soon Le the Earth and he said I I'm fine I'm fine but he was still a a warrior of the faith to me he's one of he is one of the greatest Gifts of love that God gave the Earth amen I say it and I believe it amen amen God and he preached what he lived amen he lived when he preached and now he was almost 84 years old

letter uh I me besides my dad's family the person he knew the most was the bomo family and bomo Senior both this beautiful tribute for my dad I'd like to read it for you uh a tribute to my brother in Christ and special friend Pastor Anthony Fury when he was here he blessed us in many ways and after his departure his legacy and memories continue to bless those of us who had the privilege to know him Matthew 25:21 his lord said unto him well done thou good and faithful servant thou Hast been Faithful over a few things I will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of the Lord brother Fury and I were dear friends and fellow servants for 60 years weeks ago we reminisced as I told him how much his life along with that of my wife changed uh as well as our children based on brother Fury we were both born in July 6 years apart uh brother Fury 1940 brother bomo 1946 we live in Brooklyn and our fames connected through a little church before we were born let me start I remember the day he walked into the church he was 16 years old real tough black leather bomber jacket his grandmother Anna had been praying for him so he came he heard the old Italian singing Amazing Grace and something got a hold of him he left that service changed still tough but knowing there was more to his life than the streets of Brooklyn I stay still stay still tough because weeks later he came to her church all dressed up and immediately asked the young man including me to meet in the men's room what could he possibly want so there we were brother f St Nino announces that his girl was meline high and no one better go near her don't even Shak her hand my older brother and I my older brother had inos but suddenly lost it after that powerful he then said let's go to church and enjoy the service and we did in ear and trembling the rest is history he God M so we grew up together young people in that Pentecostal Church our foot steps were ordered by God he and sister mine got married my brother Mario was his best man as time passed by Brother Fury became the young people's Minister he preached in such Simplicity he expressed the grace of God in his life and how God brought him out of the streets into a more meaningful life he wanted to share his testimony and help the young people to see there was so much more to life we once traveled to my uncle's Church in faraka away um where brother Nino was to speak and he spoke as he spoke the toughest gang members walked in and they stood there in a line defying him to continue you know paused he looked them straight in the eye and said so you think you're tough you're invincible and he began to tell them what awaited them if they didn't surrender their life to Christ he dared them to come forth to the Altar and they one by one they did he led them to Christ that's how brother Fury began his journey and how guard placed us together together from our youth I saw such compassion in his eyes love for souls and he made sure he shared it he taught the adult class in Sunday school and there introduced uh my wife Virginia and I to the message of Malachi 4 we wanted what he spoke of and the rest is history of course he was thrown out of that Pentecostal church for introducing us to the end time message from there we continued to grow both spiritually and naturally we met brother Coleman sat under his ministry as God did a special work in all our lives during his years at the church he always gave his all and he had an impact on thousands of people especially uh me and my wife we had a group that brother Coleman called the Italian band The Furies the Pumas the bomos we had all come out of the streets of Brooklyn gave our hearts to the Lord and had through brother and sister Fury come into the message we all had a deep desire to serve God and love to tell our story and song sister Madden loved the song more and more about Jesus and that is what brother Fury spoke of as he told those precious stories that we all love he stood with his Pastor blessed him by serving God's people stood by his friends and when they needed some help he and his wife were there he did the little things from cleaning the church making communion wine and planning a picnic for the less fortunate a timely phone call a helping hand a few words of wisdom from his own personal experiences my wife and I had a bad car accident when she was pregnant with with our oldest son Joseph both of us rushed to the hospital and he came and prayed then our car was towed and was in a repair shop in a rough part of Brooklyn I received a phone call that the car was stolen well Fury and our and I and our wives went to see what happened and as we arrived we spotted my car some big tough looking men inside drinking the fury runs across the street opens the door to the driver's side and tells everyone to get out this is a stolen car and they were stunned and they got out and he K the car away from them some scriptures that come to mind concerning brother Fury of Proverbs 28:20 a faithful man shall abound with blessing and he was blessed and always blessed the people who he served but the fury leaves a legacy as a faithful servant of Christ who gave his all John 12:26 If any man serve me let him follow me and where I am there shall also my servant be if any man serve me him will my father honor brother Fury's Works followed him and his Heavenly Father through every words spoken here tonight and unspoken by those who have come to honor a man who made a difference in their lives and is being honored I believe the work is being finished tonight as the man I grew up with my faithful friend who lifted up Christ tonight is being honored for his dedicated service and as we as one say Well done thou good and faithful servant God bless his family and may God continue to comfort you with these words thank you brother bomo so we have a few minutes left and I want to uh close by sharing my dad's favorite story and I think every one of you has probably heard the story we we've had this uh painting Lois tells me in our house some way back when we lived on Castle Avenue you know so the story is about a violinist and he never he was a solo violinist he was playing his first big concert and when he goes to the concert he does an amazing job and everybody stands and gives an amazing Applause and standing ovation but you know the violinist doesn't stand because he's looking up in the balcony waiting to see who's there I guess everybody pointed and they started getting louder and clapping louder screaming bravo bravo but he refused to stand and finally somebody said who is the guy he's pointing to up at the balcony and it was the ma the master the person that thought in violin and he said you know I could fool everybody but I can't hold him he's the one that that's right that's right talking brother chz earlier and he saying I was asking everyone please tell me one story something about my dad that he remembered and he summed it up he said there isn't one story he said your dad is a work of a life's work it's every day over the course of decades that you show people who you are it's not worth so I'll close to say my dad can take about amen amen shall We Stand brother Kevin on the wings of us Snow White God sends his pure Sweet Love aide from above on the wings of oh on the wings of sweet love aside from Brother on the wings of let's sing it one more time oh on the wings of a sow from above sing it one more time our God is pure from above on the wings of you can be seated a moment I have a little song U that I asked my brother-in-law Paul if I could I could sing which I believe kind of describes brother Fury's life and everything that we've heard so far I just want to say Amen to every word that was spoken amen and just say that my father-in-law was that and so much more he was a man just filled with the love of God and it was an hon honor will be called his son-in-law and I would say he treated me more like a son and as my brother-in-law Tim was looking down not a son I like a son it's good to know what I'm talking but I will tell you a funny story before I sing so it's more personal um so we had gotten married in 1990 so around 1991 brother Fury loved to barbecue and we were uh on Grand Street in Westbury and we were barbecuing it was just four of us it was my wife myself my mother-in-law my father-in-law and uh he loved Italian sausage so it was the skinny Italian sausage we put it on the grill and came inside and my piece you know was a nice siiz piece but I like it burnt so I put it back on the grill and uh we he started talking about a half hour went by my father said I got to use the restroom and then he was going to go check on the grill and he comes back with the tongues in his hand and the sausage that was like here was now here he said Joey he says God has accepted your sacri so and we left and we had so many so many wonderful moments like that but above those natural moments the spiritual uh life that he led was very influential on my life and um I can't say enough about him um so this song that I'm going to sing is called he touch me and the first verse I believe speaks to his coming to Christ the second verse speaks to his walk with Christ and I believe then there's a little part that I eded at the end and I'll just relay this one little story that my brother-in-law Paul and John had shared on the day that he passed so he was going quickly and at a certain point he turned his head and he was looking up and I believe at that moment he saw the Angels coming for him and just like that he was gone so the last part of the song when we get to that last part of the song it speaks about going home I want you to join with in with me on the song so God bless you and just close your eyes and just think on brother Fury As we sing this little I was sh by he bir oh a lord of guilt and shame there the hand of [Music] Jesus touch me oh and now I am no longer the same he touched me oh he touched me and and all the joy that floods my soul I know that something happened and now I know he touch me and made
