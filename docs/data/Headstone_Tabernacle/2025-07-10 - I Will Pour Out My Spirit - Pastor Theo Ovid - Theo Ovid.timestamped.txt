[6:24] Psalms 23.
[6:27] The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not
[6:29] want. He maketh me to lie down in green
[6:32] pastures. He leadth me beside the still
[6:35] waters. He restored my soul. He leadth
[6:39] me in the paths of righteousness for his
[6:42] name's sake. Yay do I walk through the
[6:44] valley of the shadow of death. I will
[6:46] fear no evil for thou art with me. Thy
[6:49] rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Thou
[6:52] prepareest a table before me. In the
[6:54] presence of mine enemies, thou anointest
[6:56] my head with oil, my cup runth over.
[6:59] Surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[7:01] me all the days of my life and I will
[7:03] dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[7:07] Let us bow our heads for a prayer.
[7:09] Heavenly Father, we thank you for your
[7:10] love, your presence, and this
[7:12] opportunity to serve you, to worship
[7:15] you, to come into your presence, Lord,
[7:17] knowing where the twos and trees are
[7:19] gathered together, there you are in our
[7:21] midst. And Father, we pray you come down
[7:24] in our midst and heal the sick among us.
[7:26] Touch the downtrodden, Father. Heal the
[7:28] broken heart. Lord, you know all those
[7:30] that have need among us, Lord. Those
[7:32] that will be hearing us, connected to
[7:34] us, those that would be listening to the
[7:36] message afterwards. Father, may the
[7:37] presence of life go out to each one and
[7:40] transform them, Father. Grant it, Lord,
[7:42] in this evil day, Father, that your
[7:45] spirit once more will move upon the face
[7:47] of the waters. Move upon the people,
[7:49] Father, and say, "Let there be light."
[7:52] in their dark path, let there be light.
[7:54] When things going negative and all
[7:56] things black around them, let there be
[7:58] light. Speak a word, we pray in Jesus

[18:02] The blood that speak on our behalf

[18:31] in the name of Jesus, we ask is any
[18:33] person sick here, even not connected to
[18:35] the internet, Father, may the virtue of
[18:37] Christ go out and meet the needs of your
[18:39] people. And as we approach your word,
[18:41] may your presence come down in a special
[18:42] way. Speak to our hearts tonight. May
[18:45] this be the junction service that we
[18:48] have been longing for. Granted, Father,
[18:51] in the name of Jesus, we ask it.
[18:53] Amen and amen.
[18:55] Let God bless you. We want to go
[18:56] straight to the word tonight. We want to
[18:58] read from Joel chapter 2. We want to
[19:00] read verse 23-22.
[19:03] And also, we want to look at Luke
[19:04] chapter 4 17-
[19:08] 19. Oh, praise the Lord.
[19:10] Hallelujah.
[19:12] Hallelujah.
[19:13] Reading from verse 23 of Joel chapter 2.
[19:16] Be glad then ye children of Zion and
[19:18] rejoice in the Lord your God for he had
[19:20] given you the former rain moderately and
[19:23] he will cause to come down for you the
[19:25] rain the former rain the latter rain in
[19:27] the first month and the floor shall be
[19:29] full of wheat the fat shall overflow
[19:32] with wine and oil
[19:34] and I'll restore to you the years the
[19:36] locust had eaten the conquer worm the
[19:38] caterpillar the palmer worm army which I
[19:42] sent among you shall eat in plenty and
[19:45] be satisfied ified and praise the name
[19:47] of the Lord your God that had dealt
[19:49] wondrously with you and my people shall
[19:52] never be ashamed. You shall know that I
[19:54] am in the midst of Israel, that I am the
[19:56] Lord your God and none else. My people
[19:59] shall never be ashamed. And it shall
[20:00] come to pass afterwards that I will pour
[20:02] out my spirit upon all flesh. Your sons
[20:06] and your daughters shall prophesy. Your
[20:08] old men shall dream dreams. Young men
[20:11] shall see visions also upon the servants
[20:15] and upon the handmmaids. In those days
[20:17] will I pour out my spirit. And I will
[20:19] show wonders in the heavens, in the
[20:21] earth, blood and fire, pillars of smoke.
[20:24] The sun shall be turned into darkness,
[20:26] the moon into blood before the great and
[20:28] terrible day of the Lord. Uh it shall
[20:30] come to pass that whosoever shall call
[20:32] on the name of the Lord shall be
[20:33] delivered. For in Mount Zion and in
[20:36] Jerusalem shall be deliverance as the
[20:38] Lord had said, and the remnant whom the
[20:41] Lord shall call. Reading from Luke
[20:44] chapter 4, read in verse 17. And there
[20:48] was delivered unto him, talking about
[20:49] Jesus, the book of the prophet Isas. But
[20:52] when he had opened the book, he found
[20:54] the place where it was written, "The
[20:57] spirit of the Lord is upon me because he
[20:59] had anointed me to preach the gospel to
[21:01] the poor. He has sent me to heal the
[21:03] brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to
[21:06] the captives and recovering of sight to
[21:08] the blind, to set at liberty them that
[21:11] are bruised, to preach the acceptable
[21:13] year of the Lord. May God bless his
[21:15] word. You may be seated.
[21:16] Amen.
[21:17] Oh, praise God.
[21:19] You appreciate the service on Sunday.
[21:21] Oh, praise God. What a a tremendous
[21:24] message. That last great kill with
[21:27] Anthony. And that particular quote means
[21:29] a lot to me. I feel I have a commission
[21:33] right inside of there under that last
[21:36] great kill.
[21:37] Surely there's a crop somewhere. And
[21:39] I'll be bringing back that quote
[21:40] tonight. Surely there's going to be a
[21:42] crop somewhere.
[21:44] So tonight I have a title and it's from
[21:46] the scripture from Joel. The title is I
[21:48] will pour out my spirit. This is God
[21:50] speaking.
[21:52] And I have an inspiration. Come back to
[21:55] your original inheritance
[21:57] to a real Holy Ghost again. Hallelujah.
[22:00] And this is actually a direct quote from
[22:02] the prophet.
[22:04] Uh so the title is I will port my spirit
[22:07] inspiration come back to the original
[22:09] inheritance to a real holy ghost again.
[22:12] Amen.
[22:12] Now this here is direct prophecy.
[22:15] I will pour out my spirit. Yes sir.
[22:17] Because we read that
[22:19] former rain latter rain you will eat and
[22:22] be satisfied. You'll be eaten plenty.
[22:24] And I will pour out my spirit upon all
[22:27] flesh. Amen.
[22:28] The spirit is the rain.
[22:30] Amen.
[22:30] What God is saying, it going to have
[22:32] seeds
[22:33] and the rain is going to fall.
[22:35] Amen.
[22:35] And every seed going to bring forth.
[22:37] Hallelujah.
[22:38] After its kind.
[22:39] Oh, glory to. So, William Brown and
[22:41] Kanan put seeds.
[22:42] Yes, sir.
[22:43] And that those seeds those let's say it
[22:46] this way out of a group of the true seed
[22:50] of the word,
[22:51] God will present Christ a beloved bride.
[22:55] Amen. So they are seed and they are true
[22:57] seed.
[22:58] Yes sir.
[22:58] So the true seed that was released by
[23:01] that prophet
[23:02] out of his mouth original seed
[23:04] spoken word.
[23:05] Yes sir.
[23:06] What the tape say?
[23:08] That original seed
[23:10] going to bring forth after his time.
[23:12] The spirit is guaranteed
[23:15] to pour out.
[23:16] You're not wondering. We're not hoping.
[23:20] This is thus sayeth the Lord. The spirit
[23:22] is guaranteed
[23:24] is whether you ready for it
[23:26] is if you prepare for it.
[23:27] If you have the seed for it, but I can
[23:30] guarantee you I will part my spirit.
[23:32] Hallelujah.
[23:33] Sayeth the Lord.
[23:34] Nothing will stop it.
[23:36] Hallelujah. Not even unbelief will stop
[23:39] it.
[23:40] This is what God said.
[23:42] Nothing going to hinder it.
[23:43] Hallelujah.
[23:43] Hallelujah. This I will pour my spirit
[23:47] is directly connected to I will restore
[23:51] all the years that the cankerwoman, the
[23:53] caterpillar and the locust
[23:55] because the word had to be restored
[23:58] before the spirit could be restored.
[24:00] The restoration of the word made
[24:02] provision for the restoration of the
[24:04] spirit.
[24:05] Oh, glory to God. The Satan himself
[24:07] didn't want the word to be connected
[24:09] together. And God spaced his word out
[24:11] through seven ages,
[24:12] knowing in the last age, he was sent in
[24:14] a prophet that going to restore all
[24:16] things.
[24:17] And once all things is restored, we
[24:20] could go back to the original.
[24:21] Yes, sir.
[24:22] Which is the original Pentecostal,
[24:24] which is back to the original church,
[24:25] which is back to the alpha bride.
[24:27] Once we go back to the alpha bride, we
[24:29] are ready to face the rapture,
[24:31] the millennium, the wedding supper.
[24:33] But we have to one pick up what they
[24:34] had. So he sent a prophet to turn our
[24:37] hearts back
[24:38] to the faith of the fathers. It will
[24:40] take the faith back there which is the
[24:42] original faith.
[24:43] Oh glory to God. The resurrection faith
[24:46] and that faith have to be on the earth.
[24:48] And Jesus said when the Solomon cometh,
[24:50] oh give the Lord a shout tonight.
[24:52] Shall he find faith on the earth? Would
[24:54] you be able to answer that question?
[24:56] Shall he find faith on the earth? Would
[24:58] that faith be in you? I say it's going
[25:00] to be in you because God sent a prophet
[25:02] to bring your heart and to turn your
[25:04] heart back to the faith of the fathers.
[25:07] Oh, glory to God. We in for exciting
[25:09] times. And every time I come to church,
[25:12] you never know when the spirit will come
[25:14] to the temple, when Jesus will come to
[25:16] the house. You never know when this day
[25:18] is your day.
[25:19] Oh, glory to God. He found the place
[25:21] where it was written. Oh, glory to God.
[25:23] He was reading about himself. He placed
[25:26] himself in the scripture. Oh, give the
[25:28] Lord a shout tonight.
[25:30] Oh, glory to God. And when Jesus came
[25:32] the first time, he came to declare the
[25:34] accepted day of the Lord.
[25:36] And that he has a year of jubilee,
[25:38] a year of deliverance, a year of
[25:40] release. And if Jesus come again, he
[25:42] must declare jubilee again.
[25:44] To free his people from sin, from
[25:47] bondage, from sickness. Oh, I'll ride
[25:49] this trail once more. There'll be one
[25:51] more ride.
[25:52] Oh, glory to God. Jesus himself going to
[25:54] ride the trail.
[25:56] Do you believe that? Oh, glory to God.
[25:58] Hallelujah.
[26:01] So, tonight and going in forward in
[26:04] preaching, we'll be doing some
[26:05] reflection on the Isuza revival
[26:08] that came in the Isuza street 1906.
[26:11] We'll be looking back again on some of
[26:12] that what happened back there
[26:14] because something supernatural happened
[26:15] back there
[26:16] and God brought the atmosphere before he
[26:18] sent the prophet. He made the atmosphere
[26:20] dropped down 1906 because prophet was
[26:22] coming and a prophet have to bring the
[26:24] word in the atmosphere and the
[26:25] Pentecostal revival that break out 1906.
[26:28] It was God sent it was God ordained. It
[26:31] was God inspired and up to now it
[26:33] influenced the entire world.
[26:35] Oh glory to God. And God took one man
[26:37] and used that man in such a mighty way.
[26:40] Oh glory to God. God used looking for
[26:42] men
[26:42] that he could use in a mighty way.
[26:45] Oh glory to God. So when God called him
[26:47] out, he provided him a lamb. He provided
[26:49] them mana from heaven. He provided them
[26:51] rock to drink from. They were thirsty.
[26:53] He provided a brass serpent to heal them
[26:55] when they were sick. And with all of
[26:57] that and I never even discovered and now
[26:59] discovered something. They wanted a
[27:00] theological experience.
[27:03] I never realized theology could give you
[27:05] an experience.
[27:06] Oh hallelujah. So you have a theological
[27:08] experience and you have a Holy Ghost
[27:09] experience.
[27:11] A theological experience is an
[27:12] intellectual experience.
[27:14] Oh God. Where your mind get stimulated.
[27:16] Oh glory to God. The Holy Ghost
[27:18] experience is your heart gets
[27:19] stimulated.
[27:20] Oh, glory to God. So watch, they wanted
[27:23] a theological experience so they could
[27:25] have something to fuss and organize and
[27:27] break themselves up.
[27:29] So this is what the theology does. I
[27:31] better than you. I am a revelation than
[27:33] you. I seen it this way. You seen it
[27:35] that way. And we argue we fuss like
[27:37] theology.
[27:38] That's the same thing that happened to
[27:40] our Pentecostal fathers over 40 years
[27:42] ago. God call a man in California a
[27:44] negro man one cross eye give him the
[27:47] experience of the baptism of the Holy
[27:50] Ghost
[27:51] and from there for Isuza Street the old
[27:54] Auza street mission till it scattered
[27:56] till it struck the whole nation
[27:58] from nation to nation after nation until
[28:00] Pentecostal revival was burning
[28:02] everywhere what a blessed God was
[28:05] providing by grace
[28:07] many of them couldn't write their own
[28:09] names
[28:10] some of them come to church in rags
[28:12] They walked on the railroad track and
[28:14] pick up handful of corn, beat them out
[28:17] in the track. Little mothers to feed
[28:19] their children
[28:20] so they husband could preach the gospel.
[28:22] They wandered about. They were made fun
[28:24] of. They were mocked, called holy
[28:27] rollers, spelt all night in jail day
[28:29] after day. Some of them they wanted to
[28:32] put them in insane institution. They
[28:33] said they were crazy.
[28:35] God had provided for them one of the
[28:38] greatest revival that this nation has
[28:40] ever known.
[28:41] I don't care when it was. There has
[28:43] never been a revival like the Pentecost
[28:45] of revival.
[28:47] Wesley never had it.
[28:48] Spurgeon, Calvin, Nox, Greg Reformers,
[28:50] they never had a revival like the
[28:52] Pentecostal revival. It's the greatest
[28:54] thing that struck the earth since the
[28:55] Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost.
[28:58] Oh, glory to God. Give the Lord some
[29:00] praise.
[29:01] [Music]
[29:06] And that man see more
[29:09] half blind
[29:12] before that revival breakout.
[29:15] He was praying for 5 hours
[29:17] every day
[29:18] for two and a half years.
[29:20] He had such a burden for prayer.
[29:22] Such a hungering for God.
[29:25] So burden he was.
[29:27] They were steeped in prayer.
[29:30] And that's how I want the church. There
[29:32] was breathing prayer.
[29:34] The atmosphere around them was praying,
[29:37] was calling, was travailing.
[29:39] Hallelujah.
[29:40] We a few here tonight.
[29:42] But I don't see you here tonight few
[29:44] night. I see what God is about to do.
[29:47] I know God have to take a bunch.
[29:49] A Holy Ghost bunch. Some bunch, some
[29:52] time, some day, some night, some prayer
[29:57] and maybe tonight,
[29:59] but somebody going to catch it
[30:01] and get a burden
[30:03] that they can break out of the
[30:04] humanistic realm.
[30:05] You have to let go the shore to sail to
[30:08] the other side.
[30:09] If you're going to make it, you got to
[30:11] see the other side behind you getting
[30:13] smaller and smaller.
[30:15] Oh, glory. Let's sail out, brethren.
[30:18] Let's draw our faith tonight. Amen.
[30:20] Oh, praise God. Let's press the reset
[30:22] button.
[30:23] And cancel everything you think you
[30:25] know.
[30:26] Because what you don't know, you don't
[30:27] know. What you don't know.
[30:29] Cancel everything that you know.
[30:31] Oh, glory to God. Because where are we
[30:33] going? We have not been there before.
[30:35] Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[30:37] The prophet said, "You don't know about
[30:38] power, but power is coming." He said,
[30:41] "You haven't seen power yet.
[30:43] So, let's talk. Let's talk tonight."
[30:46] Oh, hallelujah. You haven't seen power
[30:48] yet. When the anointing struck the asusa
[30:51] street revival, they could feel it
[30:52] blocks away.
[30:54] People were falling down in the street
[30:56] because of the power of God.
[30:58] The most hoy toy and bigger people were
[31:00] coming were preachers
[31:01] with the ties and they straighten up.
[31:03] And when they come so to inspect and to
[31:05] look what's going on, the power of God
[31:07] will strike them down
[31:09] and they leave their broken men,
[31:11] men on the floor.
[31:13] It wasn't something to look at. It
[31:14] wasn't something to look at. It was
[31:17] something to receive. And that revival
[31:19] is coming back.
[31:21] That Holy Ghost is coming back. That's a
[31:23] promise. It's in the word. I will pour
[31:27] out my spirit. Get ready. Get ready. Get
[31:30] ready. Oh, glory to God. It's coming.
[31:32] It's coming. It's coming.
[31:34] Oh, hallelujah. Give the Lord a praise.
[31:38] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[31:41] Jesus, give the parable.
[31:43] 11 hour gentile workers receive the same
[31:46] day.
[31:46] Amen. Same penny, same power, same
[31:49] anointing, same signs, same wonders,
[31:53] same miracles. We have to get the same
[31:55] pay.
[31:56] Not just sit on a church bench. Same
[31:58] pay, same power. These men were restored
[32:02] sons.
[32:03] Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[32:07] Imagine.
[32:07] Hallelujah.
[32:08] Imagine a man that denied Jesus. Peter.
[32:12] Peter who denied Christ. Peter who fail.
[32:15] Peter was able to say silver and gold
[32:18] I have I none
[32:19] but such as I have
[32:21] I give it unto you rise up and walk
[32:24] them brothers wasn't stumbled because
[32:26] they fail and they fall and this
[32:28] happened and that happened that has
[32:29] nothing to do
[32:30] with who they are
[32:32] what God made them
[32:33] all they stumbling and fumbling that is
[32:35] part of the process
[32:36] they were still sons and that's why God
[32:38] Jesus told Peter after you were
[32:40] converted strengthen your brethren you
[32:42] have to be converted
[32:44] from what from What? From what? From
[32:46] Triny. You have to be converted from
[32:48] you.
[32:49] To become like him.
[32:51] Hallelujah. Something have to happen on
[32:52] the inside.
[32:53] It's a conversion.
[32:55] By his spirit. He said, "Not by might,
[32:57] nor by power, but by my spirit, say the
[33:00] Lord."
[33:01] Amen.
[33:01] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. My word
[33:03] shall return unto me void,
[33:05] but it shall accomplish a purpose I sent
[33:07] it for to accomplish.
[33:08] He sent his word not for us to warm
[33:10] church bench. He sent his word for us to
[33:12] be filled
[33:13] with the spirit.
[33:15] He sent teachers to teach us the word to
[33:17] put seeds in us.
[33:19] Why? That the spirit will come upon them
[33:20] seeds.
[33:21] Not to teach us that we get educated,
[33:23] not to teach us that we get PhD, but to
[33:26] teach us that we can be placed
[33:27] positionally to receive the spirit
[33:30] because you have to be in position to
[33:32] receive the spirit. You have to be on
[33:34] brotherly love. On top of brotherly love
[33:36] is holy spirit because faith is based
[33:38] upon forgiveness. So you got to be
[33:40] placed positionally on the seventh step.
[33:43] Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[33:45] Faith, virtue, knowledge,
[33:48] temperance, patience, godliness,
[33:52] brotherly kindness, and then the Holy
[33:53] Spirit.
[33:55] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. And that
[33:57] Holy Spirit is a spirit of Christ coming
[34:00] from the headstone to manifest those
[34:02] virtues. Those virtues going to live,
[34:04] brother.
[34:05] I will pour out my spirit. Do you
[34:07] believe that tonight? So when I want you
[34:09] to come to church, you come under
[34:10] expectation
[34:11] for the outpouring of the spirit.
[34:13] You come under expectation for the
[34:15] baptism of the spirit. You come under
[34:17] expectation to be filled with the Holy
[34:19] Ghost.
[34:19] Oh, glory. Not just to hear word word.
[34:22] You come to be filled.
[34:23] We're going to preach it. You're going
[34:24] to expect it. You're going to preach it.
[34:26] We're going to going to receive it
[34:28] because God promised it. I didn't make
[34:30] the promise. God promise it. I will pour
[34:32] out my spirit. I will pour out my
[34:34] spirit. When the devil tried to bang
[34:36] your mind, say, "Shut up, Satan." God
[34:37] said, "I will part my spirit."
[34:40] And he said, "The spirit going to fall
[34:42] and the word going to live." I feel like
[34:44] running this night. He said, "The spirit
[34:46] going to fall in the kangali and the
[34:49] word will live."
[34:51] Do you believe that?
[34:53] Give the Lord a big shout on that one.
[34:55] The spirit will fall
[34:58] and the word.
[35:00] What you can't live, what you're not
[35:02] living is you're going to live.
[35:04] But the spirit going to fall.
[35:07] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[35:10] Hurry.
[35:12] They were in the upper room.
[35:14] They were afraid.
[35:15] Hallelujah.
[35:15] They had seats and afraid.
[35:17] Yes, sir.
[35:18] They were dry seeds and afraid. They're
[35:20] afraid. They lock the doors. They shut
[35:22] the doors. They shut the room.
[35:24] Hallelujah. They're looking to persecute
[35:25] these people who following Jesus.
[35:27] They shut the door. They lock the room.
[35:30] And they ting inside of they praising
[35:32] God continually. They're waiting on the
[35:34] expectation because they know a promise
[35:36] in Joel that shall come to pass
[35:38] afterwards. I'll pour out my spirit.
[35:41] Young men shall see visions. Old men
[35:43] shall dream dreams. Oh, glory to God
[35:46] upon my handmaids. Oh, we have a
[35:48] promise. I'll pour out my spirit.
[35:50] Sisters getting it. Brothers getting it.
[35:52] Old men getting it. Young men getting
[35:55] it. I'll pass the old fashioned. Old men
[35:58] getting it. Young men getting it.
[36:01] Mothers getting it. Sisters getting it.
[36:03] This is something to get. This is
[36:05] something to receive. This is something
[36:07] to experience. I will borrow.
[36:10] Pour out.
[36:14] [Music]
[36:18] Oh, glory.
[36:19] This what the preachers do.
[36:21] This the elders do. This what the
[36:23] deacons do. This the singers too. Oh,
[36:26] glory to God. I will pour out
[36:29] upon all. Woo. Come on, somebody say
[36:32] all.
[36:33] Somebody say all.
[36:35] Oh, give the Lord a shout tonight.
[36:39] I will pour out.
[36:41] Pour out.
[36:42] Hallelujah.
[36:43] Pour out.
[36:45] Pour out.
[36:46] Oh, see visions
[36:48] to see it before it come to pass.
[36:51] To see things in the future. God
[36:53] bringing it to your frontier, what is
[36:55] coming to pass that you could have an
[36:57] insight ahead of what the devil
[37:00] could offer and show you. God showing
[37:01] you things to come.
[37:03] Oh, when he, the spirit of truth is
[37:04] come,
[37:05] he will show you things to come.
[37:07] That's a promise. The comforter, the
[37:09] Holy Ghost, who I shall send.
[37:12] Oh, hallelujah. You have a promise. I
[37:14] will not leave you comfortless. Little
[37:16] while the world will see me no more, but
[37:18] you are going to see me. Because I live,
[37:20] you shall live also. The comforter is
[37:22] the Holy Ghost. I'm going to send him.
[37:25] Oh, give the Lord some shouts now.
[37:27] Give the Lord some thanksgiving
[37:29] because you are under a covenant. You
[37:32] are under a promise. You are under an
[37:34] anointing that I will pour out my
[37:37] spirit.
[37:40] Pour out.
[37:42] Not sprinkle.
[37:44] Not sprinkle.
[37:46] I want you to get the word pour.
[37:47] Pour.
[37:48] Pour. Pour out.
[37:50] Not sprinkle.
[37:51] Not not the anointing. No. Pour out.
[37:54] When you leave here, leave here drunk.
[37:56] Oh, glory to God. Leave here drunk with
[37:58] the spirit because it poured inside of
[38:01] you.
[38:02] All through your being, it was poured so
[38:03] much in them that they spoke another
[38:05] tongue. The natural language couldn't
[38:08] work no more.
[38:09] They're speaking in other tongues. The
[38:11] quickening power was all over them. It
[38:15] was the quickening power. They were
[38:17] saturated with God. They were saturated
[38:19] with the spirit. It was so much in them
[38:22] that when they lay hands on the sick,
[38:24] the sick have to recover because power
[38:27] was coming through them. Power was
[38:29] vibrating through them. And Jesus said
[38:32] in Acts 18, you shall receive power
[38:35] after the Holy Ghost come upon you. We
[38:37] have a promise, Frederick.
[38:39] You have a promise of dynamics.
[38:43] Same spirit, same word,
[38:46] dynamics to the mechanics. Oh, glory to
[38:48] God.
[38:50] My my my
[38:52] How are we going to get through this
[38:53] tonight?
[38:55] My Jesus.
[38:57] Brother said, "Where did we make our
[38:59] mistake like Israel did? We couldn't get
[39:02] along going the way the Holy Spirit was
[39:04] leading us. We had to add something to
[39:07] cause unbelief to come in.
[39:09] If Israel would have went ahead
[39:12] following the way the Lord was leading,
[39:14] within two weeks, there had been the
[39:16] promised land.
[39:18] Two weeks turn to 40 years.
[39:20] Two weeks. They almost there. Just two
[39:24] weeks.
[39:25] And they in the land. And because
[39:27] unbelief came in,
[39:29] God sent them 40 years.
[39:31] Not only send them 40 years, judge them
[39:32] that they're not going to inherit.
[39:34] And the people that came out, God said,
[39:36] "Not one.
[39:38] Your children, not you." Amen.
[39:41] God put judgment on a whole generation
[39:44] and say your seed after you is what go
[39:46] cross over.
[39:47] Not one of you.
[39:49] Told them in Mexico I said the same God
[39:51] that brought two million people out. The
[39:53] same God that judged them.
[39:55] I told them Mexico the same God that
[39:57] bring people out in this message would
[39:58] judge this message.
[39:59] Same God of this message.
[40:01] Not a different one. You know the same
[40:02] one.
[40:03] Not a different one. The same one.
[40:05] He bring them out of Egypt and he judged
[40:07] them. And
[40:08] when Jesus came on the scene, they said,
[40:10] "Our fathers eat man in the wilderness."
[40:12] And Jesus tell them, "And they are
[40:14] everyone dead."
[40:16] And that dead means separated from God.
[40:22] Amen.
[40:23] And somebody sent me a quote about
[40:25] people, ministers, and different not
[40:27] even saved.
[40:29] Not even saved.
[40:32] Nice people, good people, not even
[40:34] saved.
[40:35] This is serious. Amen.
[40:37] This is not coming to church. You're
[40:39] coming to church. You're coming to
[40:40] church. Like church.
[40:42] This is the calling of God.
[40:44] This is the election of God. The
[40:47] predestination of God.
[40:49] Amen.
[40:50] They had to substitute something. And if
[40:52] the Pentecostal church would have move
[40:53] on in the spirit the way God ordained to
[40:56] go and had already proved that he was in
[40:57] it, we were we would have been living in
[41:00] the millennium.
[41:01] My Lord. And he said the Bible
[41:02] Corinthians says these things happen for
[41:04] an examples
[41:06] for whom the end of the worlds are come
[41:08] that we could learn from these guys.
[41:10] Learn from their failures. Learn from
[41:12] their attitudes. Learn from their
[41:13] arrogance and pride that we don't follow
[41:15] their way.
[41:17] Learn.
[41:18] That's what we're here for. To learn
[41:19] from them
[41:20] that we don't do what they do because
[41:22] God judged them.
[41:23] Hallelujah.
[41:26] What happened to this group? We couldn't
[41:28] go on being led by the spirit in a group
[41:30] of believers. We had to have something
[41:31] to tack a name onto us. We wanted to
[41:33] make an organization. They had formed
[41:35] and made it. Somebody got a revelation
[41:37] that somebody will be baptized in the
[41:38] name of Jesus Christ in in Jesus instead
[41:40] of following the Holy Ghost. What
[41:41] happened? They make an organization
[41:43] called it Pa P A JC and different ones.
[41:46] One coming on a horse, one coming on a
[41:48] cloud and that's where you make your
[41:50] mistake. That is where you horribly sin.
[41:53] Why didn't you leave it alone? If that's
[41:56] name Jesus and all the things you got
[41:58] wasn't right. God say every plant that
[42:01] my heavenly father wasn't planted will
[42:02] be rooted up.
[42:04] He said it will come to north. If it is
[42:06] not God,
[42:08] if it is not God, it will come to north.
[42:10] But if it is of God, who going to stop
[42:12] it?
[42:12] Who going stop this pride? Who go stop
[42:14] the move of God? Who going to stop what
[42:16] God want to do by his spirit? I am
[42:18] convinced when the spirit move, it shuts
[42:20] up everything.
[42:22] Could you mean a cancer casting out God,
[42:24] a healing God, a resurrection God? Who
[42:26] going to stop that God? When the
[42:28] is walking, when the blind is seeing,
[42:30] when the deaf is hearing, when the dumb
[42:32] is speaking, when cancer denies
[42:36] I'm talking about a cancer and a man big
[42:38] on his neck, they come with karma as the
[42:40] cancer fall off his neck,
[42:42] fall off his neck,
[42:44] healed.
[42:47] Amen.
[42:50] It still have cancer.
[42:52] Still have tumor.
[42:53] Still have all these diseases. It's
[42:54] devils.
[42:56] that authorize to strike with sickness
[42:58] and diseases, but sons of God authorized
[43:00] to pack it back up,
[43:01] push it back out.
[43:03] Oh, give the Lord a shout. Come on now,
[43:04] say amen.
[43:05] Stick with me now. Ride with me now. If
[43:08] the devil's authorized to bring
[43:09] sickness, we authorized to cast it out.
[43:12] Oh, give the Lord a shout. That's what
[43:14] we are.
[43:15] That's not our authorization. We have a
[43:17] right. said, "In my name shall cast out
[43:19] devils, heal the sick, raise the dead,
[43:22] speak with new tongues."
[43:24] Take up deadly things that shall not
[43:25] harm you.
[43:27] Oh, we rocking back now
[43:29] to the old human line. Going back to
[43:32] Isuza. Going back to Pentecost. Going
[43:34] back to the Holy Ghost. Going back to
[43:36] the human life.
[43:38] Oh, glory to God.
[43:41] Hallelujah.
[43:42] If it's not of God, it come to north.
[43:44] Leave it alone. Let God be the ruler.
[43:46] But we had to organize oneness, twist,
[43:48] treiness, broke up, fussing, one little
[43:50] group. We are the biggest. We in a
[43:52] minority. We in a majority. We are this.
[43:54] We got the best. We got more money. We
[43:55] got more missionaries. We are not
[43:56] divided. We shouldn't be all one body.
[43:59] We
[44:00] one in hope, one in doctrine, one in
[44:02] charity.
[44:03] Oh my.
[44:05] Oh, glory to God.
[44:10] Israel wanted the same thing. God with
[44:12] them, God working with them. They come
[44:14] to Samuel and say, "Samuel, give us a
[44:15] king. Because we see the Philistines
[44:18] have one. This one have one that one and
[44:20] we we want one. We want to see.
[44:22] We want a king. Samuel
[44:26] Ball. He said, "God, have I stolen from
[44:29] you? Have I robbed you? Have I lied to
[44:31] you? Why you want to talk with king? God
[44:34] is your king."
[44:35] Amen.
[44:37] You talking this flesh thing. They want
[44:38] a man.
[44:43] You want a pope. You want a prosper?
[44:47] You want somebody say he he
[44:51] he's the man. We have the man of the
[44:53] hour.
[44:55] And God told Samuel, "Good. Give them a
[44:57] king." He said, "They have not rejected
[44:58] you. They rejected me."
[45:01] Amen.
[45:01] God knew a king was coming. That is
[45:03] David.
[45:03] Hallelujah.
[45:04] He said they walking. Give them one. And
[45:07] that's how they get saggled with soul
[45:10] who started good
[45:12] and end up being
[45:14] retrenched
[45:16] fired sitting on throne.
[45:19] Fired in the pull pit on fire.
[45:22] Fired by God.
[45:23] Amen.
[45:24] And when God had enough of that enough
[45:26] because Samuel was grieving Samuel
[45:28] anoint you know pour oil on him and
[45:30] thing you know anointed king. God said
[45:32] listen forget he is don't even weep for
[45:34] him. Go to the house of Jesse
[45:37] and anoint one of his sons to be king
[45:40] over Israel.
[45:41] Hallelujah. Go now
[45:44] that anointed gun go off for he already.
[45:46] I have to have a representative. Go and
[45:48] anoint a son of Jesse. Anoint him king.
[45:51] He going to anoint David who not even
[45:53] ready. He going to anoint David who's
[45:54] still young. He going to anoint David
[45:56] who have just potential. He going to
[45:57] anoint David who not even have thinking
[45:59] about kingship and thinking about
[46:01] throne. David who is about sheep. He
[46:03] going to anoint him.
[46:04] Amen. But what God put on you can't
[46:06] stop. It has to come to his fulfillment.
[46:09] It has to come to its accuracy. What God
[46:12] put to you must come to his rightness.
[46:14] Don't you give up on God. He's not going
[46:17] to give up on you. There is something
[46:19] God put upon your life. No devil could
[46:22] change it. And God himself not going to
[46:24] cancel it. Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[46:26] Oh, glory to God. Did you hear what I
[46:28] said? No devil could change it.
[46:31] God not going to cancel it. Oh
[46:33] hallelujah. The spirit of God is upon
[46:36] me, said Jesus. For he had anointed me.
[46:39] Oh, glory to God to preach the gospel.
[46:43] Oh hallelujah. My God. It shall come to
[46:46] pass. God going to pour out his spirit
[46:48] upon you.
[46:50] The prophet said, "No church could hold
[46:51] the Holy Ghost, but individuals." Oh,
[46:54] give the Lord a shout. Individuals could
[46:57] hold.
[47:01] Glory. individuals could hold the Holy
[47:04] Ghost.
[47:05] Amen.
[47:05] That means you could veil it. You could
[47:07] have it. You could receive it. It could
[47:10] come into you.
[47:14] That's your promise.
[47:16] Hallelujah.
[47:16] You want to have somebody that have PhD.
[47:19] We have some of these great titles and
[47:21] so forth to make us somebody to look up
[47:23] to that the rest of the president say,
[47:26] "Well, they fuss and fight and stew out
[47:28] of the corner of the f of the hat." It's
[47:30] a disgrace. It brings unbelief. The
[47:31] Bible said, and brother, I'm going back
[47:33] to the word now. Watch how he goes to
[47:34] the scriptures. The Bible said, "How can
[47:37] you have faith when you have regards one
[47:39] to another?"
[47:41] How can you do it when you try to say
[47:42] the district man is in, we have to
[47:45] listen to him, the bishop is in. We have
[47:48] to listen to him. The prosperator is in.
[47:51] We have to listen to him. Trying to be
[47:54] somebody in your organization, you can't
[47:55] do it.
[47:56] And have faith in God
[47:58] because you have to look to a man. You
[47:59] have to look for some kind of
[48:00] headquarters. But when you're connected
[48:02] to this power source
[48:04] of the Holy Ghost, you have to look to
[48:06] no man.
[48:07] You're looking to the leadership of the
[48:08] spirit
[48:09] because the spirit is sent to guide.
[48:12] He said the spirit of truth going to
[48:14] lead you
[48:16] and guide you
[48:18] into
[48:19] all truth. Give the Lord a shout.
[48:22] Is not the spirit of error.
[48:25] It's the spirit of truth.
[48:27] It was released. It was sent
[48:30] to guide you into all truth.
[48:32] Oh, glory to God.
[48:34] Hallelujah.
[48:35] Hallelujah.
[48:37] Abraham said, I often made this remark.
[48:39] I find there are two classes of people
[48:40] in the world. That's Pentecostal for one
[48:43] and fundamental. Think about it. Just
[48:46] two. The fundamental people positionally
[48:51] know what they are in Christ by the
[48:54] promise of the Bible, but they haven't
[48:57] receive the Holy Ghost to know to have
[49:00] faith.
[49:01] Amen.
[49:02] Amen.
[49:03] So they have the knowledge,
[49:04] they have the information, they have the
[49:06] consciousness, but not the faith.
[49:11] Now we take faith to produce an
[49:12] atmosphere
[49:14] because it take faith to have
[49:15] expectation. When it was revealed to
[49:16] Simeon, he was on expectation. He's a
[49:19] old man.
[49:20] They say if he slip under thick skin, he
[49:23] fall in the grave.
[49:24] I'm just making an expression here. He
[49:26] has dead already. But God revealed to
[49:27] him, you shall not see death
[49:29] until you see the Christ.
[49:31] So you could tell about God that you're
[49:32] almost there.
[49:34] Let me go and buy the the the coffin for
[49:36] you. You could see what you want. See me
[49:39] not on that.
[49:40] See me getting frightened. Grim Reaper
[49:42] getting them wink eye hulk man with the
[49:44] hulk skull. or whatever it is, he has
[49:46] nothing to do with that because God told
[49:49] him, "You shall not see death." So he
[49:51] pushing death aside until I see the
[49:54] Christ. You can't even talk to me. Death
[49:56] can't even come near me until I see the
[49:58] Christ. He could swim through death. He
[50:00] could cross over that he could jump over
[50:02] that
[50:03] because God said you have to see the
[50:05] Christ.
[50:06] And every day he going to the temple
[50:08] waiting.
[50:10] And the same Holy Ghost that came upon
[50:12] him that revealed that to him and give
[50:14] him the expectation when Mary passed the
[50:16] Holy Spirit tell him move. Now
[50:19] when Mary passed, maybe 50 women passed
[50:21] just after her. So he don't know which
[50:23] is which. But he's led by the spirit.
[50:26] He don't want to consult no bishop.
[50:27] Bishop the Lord spoke to me. You think
[50:30] which which virgin which which sister
[50:32] you think I should go?
[50:34] But he would be one miserable Simeon.
[50:38] Man have no leading whatsoever. Then he
[50:40] go snatch a baby and say I feel is this
[50:42] one. You know looking like he had bright
[50:43] eyes.
[50:45] Bright eyes. That not the promise. Baby
[50:48] with the brightest eyes. So he see me is
[50:50] going through now the spirit. I can see
[50:53] him coming some kind of song. I don't
[50:55] know what some hum some kind of Jewish
[50:57] song.
[51:04] He passed this one. He passed that one.
[51:08] When he reach Mary,
[51:10] that's the one. That's the one. That's
[51:11] the one. Spirit, stop him right there.
[51:14] Mary is there. And to confirm it is
[51:16] right. Blind. She can't see nobody now.
[51:18] You see that? You spirit leading.
[51:19] Come on now. Give the Lord a shout. This
[51:21] is this to show God. A blind woman.
[51:23] She's coming through. She's blind. And
[51:24] she stopped right by Mary.
[51:28] God could lead a blind person.
[51:30] [Applause]
[51:34] Oh my God, I feel inspired tonight.
[51:37] Oh God, that's what we're talking about.
[51:38] God can lead a blind woman to the
[51:40] promise of the hour.
[51:42] Did you hear what I said?
[51:44] God can lead a blind person to the
[51:46] promise of the hour.
[51:47] Messiah will come suddenly to his
[51:49] temple. What if he comes tonight? What
[51:51] if the Holy Ghost come to you tonight?
[51:53] Be ready.
[51:57] Glory.
[52:00] Praise the Lord.
[52:01] So the fundamentals know the promise of
[52:04] who they are but they haven't received
[52:06] the Holy Ghost
[52:07] to have faith. The Pentecostal people
[52:10] receive the Holy Ghost but they don't
[52:12] know who they are.
[52:13] So it's like a man got money in the bank
[52:15] and don't know how to write a check and
[52:17] the other one could write the check and
[52:18] hasn't got no money in the bank.
[52:21] If you could get the two together,
[52:25] money and signature,
[52:26] then you could withdraw.
[52:28] Amen.
[52:29] Oh, hallelujah.
[52:31] So then let's continue. If the
[52:34] Pentecostal people could settle
[52:35] themselves, I said last night, I truly
[52:37] believe with all my heart, the
[52:39] Pentecostal church was in a better
[52:42] condition in those days. The old Lazarus
[52:44] Street meetings that you speak of so
[52:46] much, I've read books of the early
[52:48] Pentecostal church 30, 40 back years,
[52:50] was in better condition for the coming
[52:52] of the Lord than right now.
[52:54] Amen.
[52:54] They really was right down to earth
[52:56] Christians. They lived it
[52:59] and they believed it.
[53:00] Hallelujah.
[53:02] They lived it
[53:04] and they believed it.
[53:06] We don't have the old time Pentecostal
[53:08] that used to die out and really come
[53:11] true with God. That real genuine faith.
[53:13] They just got asked God, anoint them
[53:15] with oil and went on so forth.
[53:17] Today God can come down and sh himself
[53:20] miraculously right among the people
[53:21] everything and they say, "Well, I just
[53:22] guess that that's very well." You know
[53:25] what Bram says here?
[53:26] You had too much teaching.
[53:31] I never thought it had that.
[53:34] I never even knew it had that. Too much.
[53:38] They taught so well that they taught out
[53:40] of it.
[53:41] So they coming to me more taught to I
[53:43] know there's not a word.
[53:46] They coming from what?
[53:47] He said you have too much teaching
[53:49] looking for new light.
[53:51] So afterward the same promises thing
[53:53] feel so stale. So then they want new
[53:56] revelations.
[53:57] So the man had to bring up all kind of
[53:59] thing and then afterwards they get a
[54:01] connection a line connected to the pit
[54:05] and Lucy and Lucy first have to bring up
[54:08] some things from there boy
[54:10] and if you don't watch it it and you
[54:12] don't watch that word you figure it's
[54:13] God
[54:14] but is Lucy with his tricks again
[54:17] bringing up revelations.
[54:19] Surely if God know
[54:21] you ain't know good and evil.
[54:24] That would lucy tell Eve.
[54:27] You would be like God.
[54:29] You wouldn't be normal.
[54:31] You you would have a knowledge that you
[54:33] never had before.
[54:35] Listen to me, sis.
[54:37] Itching hairs and e to shake. So he say
[54:41] you have any more?
[54:43] You have any more teachings?
[54:46] And all she was to say was God said so.
[54:50] That's right.
[54:50] Amen.
[54:51] Don't eat of that tree. God said so.
[54:53] Amen. And God can't lie. God said so. He
[54:55] said, "The day we eat, the day we die."
[54:58] Hallelujah. I ain't touching that tree.
[55:00] Get behind me, Satan.
[55:03] And Paul, oh, glory. I'm feeling good
[55:05] tonight. Brother Punch. Paul said, "If a
[55:07] angel come down from heaven and preach
[55:10] any other gospel," Paul went and said,
[55:12] "If I come back and preach something
[55:14] different that I preach originally," he
[55:16] said, "Forget it. Let me be accursed."
[55:18] Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house.
[55:20] Oh, glory to God. We have to stay with
[55:22] original word because the original word
[55:25] is original seed
[55:28] and that is what the rain coming for.
[55:31] Oh God the Lord I shout. Oh I love him
[55:33] tonight. I'm going to stay with this
[55:35] thing. Oh glory. I am not going to move
[55:38] because I know he will pour out his
[55:40] spirit. His spirit is going to borrow.
[55:43] It's guaranteed.
[55:44] [Music]
[55:46] It could happen tonight.
[55:48] Oh glory to God. It could happen now. He
[55:51] say if the power is to come among a
[55:53] people, it wouldn't emit a prayer. It
[55:55] may be the grace of God. It could happen
[55:57] tonight.
[55:58] It could happen now.
[56:00] It could happen to you. Oh, give the
[56:02] Lord a shout. Have faith in God tonight.
[56:06] [Applause]
[56:11] You know me, I'm never intimidated by
[56:13] numbers. If there's two people here,
[56:14] I'll preach this way.
[56:16] Doesn't matter who is here.
[56:18] Oh, glory to God. I'm always on
[56:20] expectation because God is God tonight.
[56:23] If God is God, serve him. Let the God
[56:26] answer by fire. Let that God be God
[56:29] tonight. He's a God of action.
[56:31] Oh, glory to God. He's a God of
[56:33] movement.
[56:34] He's a God of war. He's a God of armies.
[56:37] He's a God of deliverance. He's a God of
[56:39] healing. He's a quarter that sings a
[56:41] trumpet that brings on a jubilee that
[56:44] you could go free from your past, free
[56:46] from your sin, free from your failures.
[56:50] Oh, glory to God. You just have to
[56:51] accept it and walk out and drop the hope
[56:55] and go free tonight.
[56:57] Oh my.
[57:00] You had too much teaching, looking for
[57:02] new light.
[57:04] That's what Eve was looking for when she
[57:06] got her eyes put out. Just go back to
[57:08] the Bible and stay right with the old
[57:10] trend.
[57:11] Don't leave the old pathway
[57:13] of the first love,
[57:14] the first thing that come to you. Live
[57:17] with the Holy Spirit.
[57:19] Don't get off on some other tantrum.
[57:21] Stay right with God.
[57:23] Right in his word. And the Holy Spirit
[57:25] will never make you do anything that's
[57:27] contrary to the word.
[57:28] It will stay right with the word.
[57:30] Amen.
[57:30] No.
[57:33] Hallelujah. The Philistines and these
[57:35] Samson, what are you going to do about
[57:36] it? Oh, we got great denomination. We
[57:39] have greater membership than ever
[57:40] before. But where is the spirit?
[57:42] Where is the Holy Ghost?
[57:44] The church is bigger. The church is
[57:46] better. The church is air condition of
[57:48] elders and everything else. But where
[57:50] there's the spirit,
[57:52] not where's the teaching? I know you
[57:54] have that.
[57:56] Not where's the books. I know you have
[57:58] that. Not where is the tapes? Where are
[57:59] the Bible? You have that. But where is
[58:02] the
[58:03] spirit? Where is the Holy Ghost? Amen.
[58:06] I'm reading.
[58:07] Amen.
[58:07] That's what the devil has done.
[58:10] He wooed the church. Wooing the church.
[58:12] Come to me. This is Satan preaching.
[58:16] Lord,
[58:16] come to me and I will give you a great
[58:18] big tabernacle over here. My Lord,
[58:20] if you will get rid of that fanatic
[58:22] preacher you got
[58:25] and get a man, a doctor of divinity that
[58:27] got some sense.
[58:29] We will build a big classical church and
[58:33] we'll be like the rest of them.
[58:35] Lord,
[58:36] he says, "Shame on you."
[58:38] I'd rather have a man that did no split
[58:40] coffee from beans
[58:42] but was filled with the Holy Ghost
[58:44] that was uncompromised by the power of
[58:47] God.
[58:47] Hallelujah. So they could talk what they
[58:49] want to talk. This is what God wants.
[58:53] Not not not and you know preachers does
[58:55] um does catchy sinners evangelist catch
[58:58] sinners but teachers is teach them.
[59:01] And I say what teachers teaching for to
[59:03] just teach them.
[59:05] The teachers are teaching that the
[59:06] people could be placed to receive the
[59:08] spirit.
[59:09] The preachers have to preach to bring
[59:10] the spirit
[59:11] because the preaching is the watering of
[59:13] the word.
[59:14] Amen.
[59:14] So it's two things happening with with
[59:15] watering. You water into your praises
[59:17] and the preacher water with the
[59:18] preaching.
[59:23] Paul said that one soul,
[59:27] another
[59:28] water,
[59:29] but God
[59:31] give the increase.
[59:33] Let's say it again. One soul,
[59:35] the other
[59:36] water, but
[59:38] God give the increase.
[59:40] One did what? So,
[59:43] and one did what? Water. You need the
[59:45] soil
[59:47] and you need the water.
[59:49] You need the seed and you need the rain.
[59:52] Without the rain, your seed just
[59:54] standing there. You need the rain and
[59:56] the seed. You need mechanics
[59:59] and you need dynamics. Don't just tell
[1:00:02] me we need mechanics. Give me some
[1:00:05] dynamics. He said we do we put too much
[1:00:08] emphasis on the mechanics. But tonight,
[1:00:11] tonight and going forward, we're going
[1:00:14] to put emphasis on this dynamics, this
[1:00:17] Isuza Street, this Holy Ghost, this
[1:00:19] oldfashioned sin killing, demon chasing.
[1:00:23] Glory to God. Hell hot, heaven high.
[1:00:26] That kind of gospel. Give it, brother.
[1:00:28] Give it to me. That's what I want.
[1:00:31] They're going to change our hearts. It's
[1:00:33] going to change lives. It's going to
[1:00:34] change homes. They're going to change
[1:00:36] family. It's the old time Holy Spirit
[1:00:38] and the devil won't go near it. That's
[1:00:41] the reason people fear it. But it's good
[1:00:43] enough for me. Give me that old time
[1:00:45] religion. Give me that old time
[1:00:47] shouting. Give me that old time. Give
[1:00:49] it.
[1:00:51] Oh, give it.
[1:00:54] [Applause]
[1:00:58] [Music]
[1:00:59] [Applause]
[1:01:03] All kind of songs.
[1:01:05] Can't touch them old songs.
[1:01:08] All kind of songs can't touch them blood
[1:01:10] songs.
[1:01:11] Hallelujah. Them songs come by
[1:01:12] inspiration. Them come by Holy Spirit
[1:01:15] experiences. That why we sing them same
[1:01:17] songs from the books and it bring the
[1:01:20] anointing. It's not no modern songs is
[1:01:22] old songs. Songs are 100 years old.
[1:01:24] Amazing grace is old. All them songs is
[1:01:27] old. Old rocket cross is old songs. Get
[1:01:30] it song right. And the anointing is upon
[1:01:32] it. Oh God, we just sing just for
[1:01:34] singing sake. We sing to bring the
[1:01:36] spirit. That's why send for deep David
[1:01:40] to play for Saul, demons upon Saul. But
[1:01:43] singing a music cast them devils out. We
[1:01:46] singing because we want atmosphere. We
[1:01:48] worship because we want atmosphere. It
[1:01:50] take atmosphere to create for the
[1:01:52] supernatural and omnipotence to speak
[1:01:55] and the miraculous to take place. You
[1:01:57] come to create atmosphere. You have to
[1:01:59] see what you come for. You come to make
[1:02:01] a revival. The minister can't bring a
[1:02:03] revival, but you can bring it. I telling
[1:02:06] you tonight, you can bring it.

[1:02:14] prayer life. Bring it from your closet,
[1:02:16] your third pole closet. Bring it.
[1:02:18] Bring that revival. Bring that pill with
[1:02:20] you.
[1:02:22] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:02:24] It shall come to pass afterwards.
[1:02:26] I will pour out
[1:02:28] my spirit.

[1:03:10] to be making a certain noise in his
[1:03:11] house.
[1:03:12] Yes.
[1:03:12] And he had a little daughter who wanted
[1:03:15] to bring some friends some party or
[1:03:16] something. So she said, "Well, let me I
[1:03:18] give daddy the Bible to read. Let me
[1:03:20] give him a geography book
[1:03:22] and put him up in the attic.
[1:03:24] He go keep quiet watching all them lands

[1:03:47] bottom and when I think about my sins
[1:03:50] how God put in the sea of his
[1:03:52] forgetfulness
[1:03:53] God is
[1:03:56] I can't help it I can't help it when I
[1:03:58] think how We take all my sins and put it
[1:04:00] in the sea of the forgetfulness. I have

[1:04:04] say hallelujah. Man, when God in you,
[1:04:06] you see God everywhere.
[1:04:08] Oh, give the Lord a shout. I say when
[1:04:09] God is in you,
[1:04:12] you could see him everywhere.
[1:04:15] Oh, put you in the attic. You're still
[1:04:16] shouting.

[1:04:19] you, you're still shouting. Trials come,
[1:04:22] you still going to shout. You have a
[1:04:23] right to shout. And I found a quote. I
[1:04:25] might read it tonight, but I'm talking
[1:04:27] about when they worship. Hallelujah.
[1:04:28] Bless the honor almighty. He said
[1:04:29] there's a Pentecostal meeting. He said I
[1:04:31] back to the Isuza street because I was
[1:04:33] asking God give me a scripture in the
[1:04:35] revelation that identify Pentecost with
[1:04:37] a random. He said that is it there. Oh
[1:04:39] glory to God. When the lamb took the
[1:04:41] book and they start to worship that is
[1:04:43] the Pentecost. That's the revival right
[1:04:46] there. That's king lamb worship. When
[1:04:48] the anointed are found it in the book of
[1:04:50] revelation. The first part is
[1:04:52] revelation. The second part is
[1:04:53] manifestation. Revelation chapter 5.
[1:04:55] When they lamp up the book, they sang a
[1:04:57] new song. Oh, glory. The old song
[1:04:59] couldn't work no more. They had to sing
[1:05:01] a new song. That was worth to take the
[1:05:03] book and to loose the seven seals and
[1:05:05] all in heaven, all under the earth.
[1:05:07] Heard I John, praise God. His voice was
[1:05:10] j.
[1:05:11] He was going and going through
[1:05:13] dimensions. Oh, glory to God. The earth
[1:05:15] dimension. He was going below on top.
[1:05:17] Hell was hearing him. Everything was
[1:05:20] the lamb took the book. We shall reign
[1:05:23] on the earth. or give the Lord a shout
[1:05:25] and all of this happening and I mustn't
[1:05:27] shout and I mustn't praise my God. Come
[1:05:29] on now.
[1:05:31] [Music]
[1:05:34] [Applause]
[1:05:41] [Music]
[1:05:42] You got to be born again.
[1:05:45] Delila woo in the big churches fine
[1:05:47] educated ministers better class. You
[1:05:50] know so and so down here is a
[1:05:51] millionaire. If we could get him to come
[1:05:53] to our congregation,
[1:05:55] oh my. But I'm say if he isn't born
[1:05:58] again, he doesn't deserve to be there.
[1:06:00] I don't care if he have a million
[1:06:02] dollars. If he own 40 Cadillacs,
[1:06:05] whatever he's got, he has got to be born
[1:06:08] again.
[1:06:11] come right down to the new birth
[1:06:13] and be regenerated by the Holy Ghost
[1:06:16] and come out snotting, excuse me,
[1:06:18] crying, screaming, carrying on that like
[1:06:22] the rest of them doing.

[1:06:29] Sorry you don't have that.

[1:06:40] last time he say he want it. The slave
[1:06:41] tell him come come down come down here.
[1:06:42] He said I can't get it here. He said
[1:06:43] come down now. Come down. And the slave
[1:06:45] went in the pie. He says get it here. He
[1:06:47] said there
[1:06:50] he said yeah in the big sty right here
[1:06:52] with all the mess and thing. He say I I
[1:06:54] ain't coming down there. He said you
[1:06:55] ready yet?
[1:06:56] When you ready for it?
[1:06:58] Doesn't matter.
[1:07:01] Oh give the Lord a shout.
[1:07:03] When you ready it doesn't matter
[1:07:06] where it is. I want it. I want it now. I
[1:07:10] want it tonight. It is my promise. God
[1:07:13] said I will pour my spirit.
[1:07:16] Oh, hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. I have
[1:07:19] a right to get it. It's me, mine.
[1:07:22] [Applause]
[1:07:23] [Music]
[1:07:26] That was a wise Christian.
[1:07:28] He know the man hot know the man have
[1:07:30] pride. So he test him. You waste hand
[1:07:33] laying hands upon the man. The man can't
[1:07:34] move. You ever pray somebody who have no
[1:07:36] anointing upon them?
[1:07:37] This sound like a rocking like you're
[1:07:39] praying for a dead man.
[1:07:42] That the worst prayer to pray. You're
[1:07:44] praying somebody and they pushing. So,
[1:07:47] not even amen. Not even praise God.
[1:07:50] You don't know if they're living or the
[1:07:52] dead.
[1:07:56] But when you pull your hands on somebody
[1:07:57] and they're crying and they're praying
[1:07:59] and in the spirit, my God, you're right
[1:08:01] there with them. They're in the spirit.
[1:08:03] You in the spirit. You praying for them.
[1:08:09] Hallelujah.
[1:08:10] Them dead ones, they'll kill you
[1:08:12] when when you pray. Pray your prayer
[1:08:15] really bouncing back. Your prayer going
[1:08:16] no way at all. Like rubber prayers.
[1:08:19] Boom.
[1:08:21] Prayers are going through at all. Just
[1:08:23] bouncing back. Boom boom boom boom.
[1:08:25] Rubber prayers. And hitting you when you
[1:08:28] finish.
[1:08:30] Say, "Lord, that killed the preacher.
[1:08:35] Oh, hallelujah. So, don't give us don't
[1:08:37] let us have no rubber praise on you.
[1:08:39] Come in the spirit, man.
[1:08:41] Get in the spirit.
[1:08:47] Oh, Lord, help me Jesus.
[1:08:50] Glory to God. Amen.
[1:08:52] So, they bound him. Samson, what they
[1:08:55] do? The Philistines upon what they do?
[1:08:57] They found a secret. They found a
[1:08:59] secret. Have you he found your secret?
[1:09:02] Lord,
[1:09:03] the world found your secret. You woman
[1:09:05] bub your hair look like the world. Dirty
[1:09:07] jokes and cigarettes and socialable
[1:09:09] drinks and so on. Samson the Philistines
[1:09:12] on thee. Brand of tabernacle
[1:09:15] worldism creeping among you. What about
[1:09:17] it? Have you exposed your secret? Have
[1:09:19] you let creep out by social formers
[1:09:21] gospel? What happened to you? Well, I
[1:09:23] guess that's all right. We enjoy
[1:09:24] listening to it once in a while if we're
[1:09:26] not too tired. That's brum tabernacle.
[1:09:29] The Philistines is on day.
[1:09:30] What is he talking about? He is there
[1:09:32] sick has been healed and after all the
[1:09:34] people get so accustomed well hell in
[1:09:35] good service tonight. You know I mean we

[1:09:40] and walk and so on and people
[1:09:42] going normal normal normal.
[1:09:46] They're no longer sensitive to the
[1:09:48] spirit and burden for what God is doing.
[1:09:53] Then he said this when I used to be
[1:09:55] preaching the word the old saints with
[1:09:58] tears in their eyes
[1:09:59] would rise to their feet.
[1:10:01] So this standing up thing you know new
[1:10:03] thing
[1:10:05] rise to their feet and walk
[1:10:08] sobbing maybe not saying a word just
[1:10:10] walking around two three times and set
[1:10:12] down
[1:10:13] somebody call us the exercising church
[1:10:14] we going up we're going down we going
[1:10:16] please exercise.
[1:10:17] Hallelujah.
[1:10:19] When the spirit came upon the boat, he
[1:10:21] stood up to his feet.
[1:10:22] They said, "Little fish, I give back
[1:10:24] life." He has sit down. Stand up to his
[1:10:25] feet. Take off his hat.
[1:10:27] Cuz the spirit come upon him.
[1:10:30] Hallelujah.
[1:10:31] Stand up to your feet. People say now
[1:10:33] they crossing their leg and have a book
[1:10:34] on a pad and a paper to write.
[1:10:38] I remember meetings years ago that
[1:10:40] ministers forget it. The them guys don't
[1:10:42] want to worship nothing at all. So they
[1:10:43] playing writing the word fire falling
[1:10:45] writing on the right. Fire falling be
[1:10:48] right.
[1:10:49] Amen.
[1:10:50] But they don't want to put down the P
[1:10:52] and the book and reach the hand and
[1:10:53] reach for like everybody else. Them is
[1:10:54] ministers, the foot girls.
[1:10:58] 24 elders, them fellas with the crowns
[1:11:00] on the head. When the lamb took the
[1:11:02] book, them fellas lick off crown. Them
[1:11:04] fellas, them fellas settle down and fix
[1:11:07] crown and have a mirror say how the
[1:11:09] crown looking. I want to I want to move
[1:11:12] too much because the crown might shift.
[1:11:15] Them guys are not what crown we're
[1:11:17] talking about. Crown crown gone. So
[1:11:22] them just worshiping the four beasts
[1:11:24] woriing the elders worshiping thousands
[1:11:26] time thousands worshiping blessing and
[1:11:28] honor and might and dominion.
[1:11:33] Hallelujah.
[1:11:35] [Applause]
[1:11:36] There's the quote but Anthony read. So
[1:11:38] revival day. How can we have it when the
[1:11:40] revival giver is bound by the world? God
[1:11:42] won't come in where the world is. You
[1:11:44] can just depend on that. You associated
[1:11:46] with the world, then you let the world
[1:11:48] creep in. You go to acting like the
[1:11:49] world, then you're finished. But when
[1:11:51] you cut loose every fetter of the world,
[1:11:53] come to God. God will use you until you
[1:11:56] go to flirting again.
[1:11:58] Here's the only hope that I have this
[1:11:59] morning to wind up my message. Why
[1:12:01] Samson was bound? A new shock of hair
[1:12:05] grow out.
[1:12:06] Amen.
[1:12:06] Then he's praying, "God, send us another
[1:12:09] church
[1:12:10] just before the end time."
[1:12:11] Yes, sir. that the power of the Holy
[1:12:13] Ghost
[1:12:14] can come into her.
[1:12:15] Not more education,
[1:12:17] not teachings, not more revelations, not
[1:12:20] more mysteries hidden or written hidden,
[1:12:23] however they want to see it.
[1:12:25] I know people think I hate mysteries.
[1:12:28] I anti mystery people.
[1:12:33] But Christ is the mystery
[1:12:35] of God revealed. When you wrap up all
[1:12:36] the mysteries, you have to show me
[1:12:38] Jesus. Amen.
[1:12:39] You see if I if I see Jesus, I go
[1:12:40] understand all the mysteries because
[1:12:42] Paul already answered that question. Do
[1:12:44] I know all mysteries, have all knowledge
[1:12:46] and do have charity, I am nothing, you
[1:12:48] know,
[1:12:48] I wasting time. I just wasting time, you
[1:12:50] know, sounding brass and tingling
[1:12:52] symbol, you know, do I give my body to
[1:12:53] be burned?
[1:12:54] How do I feed the poor and don't have
[1:12:57] charity?
[1:12:58] Nothing.
[1:12:59] Then he had to describe the contents of
[1:13:01] charity or the virtue of charity or the
[1:13:04] nature of charity. Charity is kind.
[1:13:06] Clarity is longsuffering. Doesn't vaunt
[1:13:09] itself up. Is not easily provoked. It
[1:13:12] believe it all things. Hope it all
[1:13:14] things. Endure it all things. Charity
[1:13:16] never failth.
[1:13:17] Oh good Lord have mercy.
[1:13:20] Oh glory to God. I'm preaching myself
[1:13:22] happy tonight.
[1:13:23] I might speak in tongues just now. Oh
[1:13:25] glory to God. Hallelujah. Quick power.
[1:13:28] Oh hallelujah.
[1:13:30] Charity never failth.
[1:13:33] [Music]
[1:13:36] Hallelujah.
[1:13:37] When when brother was going through the
[1:13:39] fence and forget the gun and forget
[1:13:41] about the killer bull, God arranged that
[1:13:42] he forget about the killer.
[1:13:44] And God want to give him experience of
[1:13:45] this charity. This love you see
[1:13:47] something came over him.
[1:13:49] If he had the gun, bow think twice. You
[1:13:51] have gun.
[1:13:52] You ever want to talk to bully have a
[1:13:54] gun?
[1:13:55] You think you would talk to bull and you
[1:13:56] have a gun? Shoot the bull.
[1:13:58] That's what he was going to do if he had
[1:13:59] the gun. So God make sure he the gun not
[1:14:01] there. So then something came over him.
[1:14:04] Take away fear.
[1:14:06] Note when that come, fear gone.
[1:14:08] He's not afraid of the animal.
[1:14:10] Where is he? He's back in Eden.
[1:14:14] Did you hear that?
[1:14:15] Fear is gone.
[1:14:17] Where is he? Back in Eden. Just like
[1:14:19] Adam having dominion over every creep
[1:14:22] and thing that
[1:14:24] [Music]
[1:14:28] he's back in Eden having dominion over
[1:14:31] the cattle
[1:14:33] cattle man cattle snorting coming down
[1:14:35] to him. He says stop go back and lie
[1:14:38] down.
[1:14:39] Are you going and pray for somebody
[1:14:41] and cattle pull back brakes screech
[1:14:44] pull back brakes go and lie down normal.
[1:14:47] Normal normal
[1:14:48] and he passed in normal normal you know
[1:14:50] I didn't I can't remember where he
[1:14:51] passed to come back in
[1:14:53] but he passed right back there still
[1:14:55] anointed cuz them kind of thing when
[1:14:56] your pastor get experience you trim
[1:14:58] afterwards
[1:15:02] I remember I remember was in South
[1:15:04] Africa we do some work in the church
[1:15:05] here and you know we do this by vision
[1:15:09] by inspiration and when South Africa
[1:15:11] like inspiration leave me
[1:15:15] and I used sit down in South Africa. I
[1:15:17] said, "Lord have mercy. What on earth am
[1:15:19] I doing?"
[1:15:22] Somebody called me the father at the
[1:15:24] roof to raise roof high. I was up next
[1:15:27] and I afterwards was like a trembling. I
[1:15:29] was shaking
[1:15:32] and no confessing that
[1:15:35] was shaking but the vision was so
[1:15:39] tremendous.
[1:15:39] Hallelujah.
[1:15:40] That when you come from that you just
[1:15:41] normally want to do you look and see it.
[1:15:44] So you know because in the spirit is
[1:15:46] everything fine when you get out of that
[1:15:48] thing. So you want to say what is this?
[1:15:50] You know what you're doing. All the
[1:15:52] demons that doubt coming to attack you
[1:15:55] until they get back in the spirit.
[1:15:57] You never hear that before right?
[1:16:00] Tonight is the night you hear.
[1:16:03] But God put a faith inside of him
[1:16:05] to believe it will be done. And we did
[1:16:07] it.
[1:16:10] Hallelujah.
[1:16:12] So I believe my commission is tight
[1:16:14] inside of here. What God called me to
[1:16:15] do, God sent us another church just
[1:16:17] before the end time. Who? All right.
[1:16:20] That the power of the Holy Ghost can
[1:16:22] come unto her in the demonstrations of
[1:16:26] the spirit. And this is preaching the
[1:16:28] gospel, not teaching and explaining and
[1:16:32] revealing. Because revelation could come
[1:16:35] two ways. It could come by written. You
[1:16:38] reveal who you are. I am the prime
[1:16:39] minister. I am this. That's written.
[1:16:40] That's and revelation is person also the
[1:16:43] person the primary can come and say I am
[1:16:44] he like what Jesus said I am he so it
[1:16:46] have words it have manifestation it have
[1:16:48] all ways of different revelation but
[1:16:50] this is specific
[1:16:51] that the holy ghost come to the church
[1:16:52] with the demonstration of the spirit
[1:16:55] mark 16 can follow the church acts 2:4
[1:16:58] which is the refilling acts 238 which is
[1:17:00] the filling all of it will be followed
[1:17:02] right along in the church signs and
[1:17:05] wonders accompany the apostles
[1:17:08] not churches accompany the apostles and
[1:17:11] teachings that come signs and wonders
[1:17:13] was part of the package
[1:17:15] that went the with the apostolic church.
[1:17:17] If we are going back here, we have to
[1:17:19] have that.
[1:17:21] I'm going to say it again.
[1:17:23] We have to have that
[1:17:25] to vindicate we have been turned back to
[1:17:27] that
[1:17:28] because that is where the faith was
[1:17:30] expressed. Works is faith expressed. If
[1:17:33] we go back to the faith of the fathers,
[1:17:35] where are the works that the fathers
[1:17:37] did? Could we hear a shout? Could I hear
[1:17:39] amen on that?
[1:17:41] It's not the teachings of the fathers.
[1:17:43] It's the faith of the fathers. And works
[1:17:45] express the faith of the fathers.
[1:17:49] If you have faith, show me the works.
[1:17:53] Amen.
[1:17:56] Hallelujah.
[1:17:57] Then he said, "Great signs of the his
[1:17:59] resurrection accompany them." While we
[1:18:01] in prison, surely God is growing a crop
[1:18:04] somewhere for that last great kill. May
[1:18:07] it be you, my Christian friend, here
[1:18:08] this morning. May it be your strength
[1:18:10] had begin to grow. I pray that this
[1:18:12] message this morning out into the land
[1:18:14] where it go. I trust this message will
[1:18:16] bring the spiritual vitamins that will
[1:18:19] grow a spiritual power back into your
[1:18:22] life again.
[1:18:22] Hallelujah.
[1:18:23] Oh, may the Samson of God may the true
[1:18:25] in heart. May those who are longing and
[1:18:28] crying, pleading, look at the
[1:18:29] description, look at this description.
[1:18:32] May those who are longing and crying,
[1:18:34] pleading and holding on, may they stay
[1:18:37] with it, Lord.
[1:18:38] Until this new crop grows out,
[1:18:41] until there comes forth a joy in Zion,
[1:18:43] that they come for a group that can
[1:18:45] recognize and understand and that can
[1:18:48] see the Messiah and the hidden powers
[1:18:50] that is hid from the world that they not
[1:18:52] understand now. God grant it that they
[1:18:55] will see it for we ask in Jesus name.
[1:18:57] Hallelujah.
[1:18:57] Oh, glory to God.
[1:18:59] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:19:01] So as we wrap up the the the year of
[1:19:04] Jubilee, Jesus the prophet said uh he
[1:19:07] came to the temple to preach the
[1:19:08] acceptable year and precious words
[1:19:10] proceed from his lips. And that year was
[1:19:12] called the Jubilee where every man that
[1:19:14] have been captivity could go free. And
[1:19:16] hundreds years have passed but the same
[1:19:18] God that sent Jubilees in them days is
[1:19:20] the same God who sent Jubilees today.
[1:19:23] All the people that have been captured
[1:19:25] and was in captivity, there come an
[1:19:28] acceptable year when the trumpet sounded
[1:19:30] and all the ones that were in captivity
[1:19:33] didn't have to pay any price. They could
[1:19:35] go absolutely go free.
[1:19:37] They could drop their hoe they were
[1:19:39] hoing whatever instrument they were
[1:19:40] working with could go free. But that was
[1:19:43] by choice.
[1:19:44] You have to choose to go free
[1:19:46] when you hear the trumpet.
[1:19:48] Tonight a trumpet is being sounded. Once
[1:19:50] the word being preached is a trumpet.
[1:19:52] It's a gospel trumpet.
[1:19:54] Oh, glory to God. Amen.
[1:19:56] Hallelujah. If they didn't want to go
[1:19:59] free, then they were taken to the temple
[1:20:00] and they will bore all in the air and
[1:20:02] then they could never go free again.
[1:20:04] Oh my. So, we find out many of us in
[1:20:06] these last days, this is the part I want
[1:20:07] to get to. This is important. Okay. In
[1:20:09] the last days, in our organization of
[1:20:12] Pentecost, we have come in and organized
[1:20:15] ourselves and rejected the leisure of
[1:20:17] the Holy Spirit by the wisdom of groups
[1:20:19] of people. Instead, here we go. Listen
[1:20:22] this book. Instead of having fellowship
[1:20:24] one with one another, it's divided us,
[1:20:27] separated us into several different
[1:20:29] organization of people. And in doing so,
[1:20:31] it has broke up our inheritance.
[1:20:32] Amen.
[1:20:34] Amen.
[1:20:34] He is saying the inheritance get break
[1:20:36] up
[1:20:37] by the divisions.
[1:20:39] Amen.
[1:20:39] And kind of foolishness.
[1:20:42] These walls inside. If we ever get
[1:20:44] walled into a place where we can't
[1:20:46] accept the word and the Holy Spirit and
[1:20:48] have to take the creeds and so forth of
[1:20:50] a church instead of the power of the
[1:20:52] Holy Spirit, the jubilee will never mean
[1:20:54] nothing to that person.
[1:20:55] Amen.
[1:20:56] No matter how much you can say your
[1:20:57] mother left you inheritance, daddy left
[1:20:59] you inheritance and whatnot. He said,
[1:21:01] but accept dogma that was injected into
[1:21:03] your fellowship instead of being free in
[1:21:05] Christ, letting the Holy Spirit lead us
[1:21:09] along back in the age when the early
[1:21:10] church was getting together. Immediately
[1:21:13] they had to go to organizing and when
[1:21:15] they did they was afraid that somebody
[1:21:17] else would be a leader would get in the
[1:21:18] little group. They had issues that came
[1:21:20] in and then they had to organize these
[1:21:22] issues. If they had left it alone let
[1:21:24] the Holy Spirit weed out and bring out
[1:21:27] and lead in and put in
[1:21:28] the church would be farther advanced.
[1:21:30] Let the Holy Spirit I mean every every
[1:21:33] inspiration and and teaching and things
[1:21:35] not not right God will listen God is God
[1:21:38] you know God is boss you know.
[1:21:40] Hallelujah. God will remove people off
[1:21:42] the earth, you know.
[1:21:43] God will shift things around, you know,
[1:21:45] for his purpose, you know.
[1:21:46] God have a plan, you know.
[1:21:48] Listen, the Lord himself descending in 1
[1:21:50] Thessalonians 4, you know, to get his
[1:21:51] bride, you know.
[1:21:52] You think he going to let some man
[1:21:54] manhandle his wife,
[1:21:55] not this Jesus I'm talking about.
[1:21:57] The Lord himself descend with a shout.
[1:22:00] Go them playing with that.
[1:22:01] Them false anointing can only hold
[1:22:03] church members.
[1:22:04] They will never hold the bride.
[1:22:06] And if they have the bride, the bride
[1:22:07] will come out.
[1:22:09] Oh, glory to God. God will have true
[1:22:10] shepherds
[1:22:11] in the last days.
[1:22:13] Oh, glory to God.
[1:22:15] He going to come down himself.
[1:22:17] Hallelujah.
[1:22:18] Now, a man and his family could go back
[1:22:20] to the original
[1:22:23] if they hear the Jubilee trumpet song
[1:22:25] and know what it meant to them.
[1:22:28] If they heard the preong the trumpet,
[1:22:29] the minister, the trumpet is the gospel.
[1:22:31] They had a privilege to come and receive
[1:22:34] again their inheritance.
[1:22:36] Amen.
[1:22:36] What you lost, you go back to it.
[1:22:38] Amen. Oh my. What we lost? What they
[1:22:41] have on Pentecost? We're going back to
[1:22:43] our inheritance. Let me read it. You'll
[1:22:45] see where I get inspiration from. The
[1:22:47] hour of Jubilee. Okay. Our Pentecostal
[1:22:49] experience years ago, we find we have
[1:22:51] walled out ourselves away from that. So
[1:22:53] far that we got to hear what somebody
[1:22:55] say instead of thus say the Lord.
[1:22:57] And you can hear the word of God say now
[1:23:00] is the hour of Jubilee. Go back. Come
[1:23:03] back. Where inspiration from? come back
[1:23:05] to your original inheritance to the real
[1:23:08] Holy Ghost again.
[1:23:10] Remember, he could go free.
[1:23:12] He didn't have to pay nothing.
[1:23:14] Didn't have to do nothing. Just get up
[1:23:16] and go.
[1:23:18] Just Just think about it. You could get
[1:23:19] up tonight and go free. Go and sin no
[1:23:21] more. Oh, glory to God. Who the son of
[1:23:23] man set free is is free indeed.
[1:23:27] Clean your slate. Wipe your slate.
[1:23:29] Watch. if he knew the song of the
[1:23:31] trumpet but he had to know the song of
[1:23:32] the trumpet for they are sons of God.
[1:23:34] Now faith come by hearing hearing the
[1:23:36] word of God. And when we hear that we
[1:23:38] are free and refuse to act upon our
[1:23:40] freedom, then we shall be sealed away
[1:23:43] from God to receive the mark of the
[1:23:45] beast.
[1:23:46] For to hear is to receive. And when we
[1:23:48] hear we are free, then we can accept it
[1:23:51] and be free.
[1:23:52] Oh my. When the hearer heard the Jubilee
[1:23:55] song and he didn't want to be free,
[1:23:57] sealed away from the kingdom. He said
[1:23:59] today in celebration of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:01] revival that we used to have musician
[1:24:03] come and place. I hear our fathers talk
[1:24:04] about how the angels came down and sang
[1:24:06] in the meetings and the power of God
[1:24:08] taking over and the saints were born
[1:24:09] again and things happen and it come from
[1:24:11] a oldfashioned sky blue sinkilling
[1:24:13] preaching old sassifas type. Men did not
[1:24:16] know the ABCs but they know Christ and
[1:24:18] had the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And
[1:24:20] that is what we hunger for today is an
[1:24:22] oldfashioned baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:24] and a pouring out of God's blessing
[1:24:26] back to the whole again.
[1:24:29] If the devil has took you captive, it is
[1:24:32] jubilee time. It is time to come back to
[1:24:35] the old experience again. Back to the
[1:24:37] oldfashioned Bible. Back to the place
[1:24:39] where we can feel the power of God
[1:24:42] search through that will call men and
[1:24:44] women to the altar. That will make them
[1:24:46] stay on their face all night long and
[1:24:48] pray to God and seek for deliverance.
[1:24:51] What a time. What we need today is a
[1:24:53] calling out, a pulling out, a pulling
[1:24:55] out jubilee. Oldfashioned revival is
[1:24:57] what we need. Oh, a weeping through to
[1:24:59] Calvary. What we need is to revive.
[1:25:02] What's exactly what we need? A good
[1:25:03] oldfashioned revival. Oh, glory to God.
[1:25:07] Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God.
[1:25:10] Praise God. If you want an Isuza Street
[1:25:12] return, just lay down and be shaved all
[1:25:15] the way down with the word of God. Oh,
[1:25:18] hallelujah. Stop kicking. Stop fussing.
[1:25:20] Become a sheep. Become a lamb. Get
[1:25:23] shaved. I know it's a privilege. It
[1:25:25] belongs to you because you were born in
[1:25:27] sin. She iniquity coming speaking lies.
[1:25:29] But will you forfeit it and become a
[1:25:31] lamb?
[1:25:31] The lamb was not a grumbler. The Bible
[1:25:33] said he opened not his mouth. When he
[1:25:35] was revived, he reviled it again. That's
[1:25:37] the reason the dove could stay on him.
[1:25:39] But us, let someone do something against
[1:25:41] us, we got hot in the collar, the dove
[1:25:43] take his flight. The Holy Spirit leaves.
[1:25:45] And many times you wonder why we can't
[1:25:47] have that peace we used to have. Oh,
[1:25:49] glory to God. Hallelujah. Oh, glory to
[1:25:53] God. Hallelujah. But in order to be a
[1:25:55] lamb, he forfeited his right. in order
[1:25:58] to die in yourstead. He was a lamb. You
[1:26:01] say, "Brother Brham, what is the way
[1:26:03] back to the oldfashioned meetings? Just
[1:26:05] become lambs again. Just get back to
[1:26:07] being a sheep. The dove hasn't gone very
[1:26:10] far. He's just waiting a chance to get
[1:26:12] back. The road back to Isuza Street.
[1:26:14] There's a place back. Back to the Isuza
[1:26:17] Street meetings again is to return to a
[1:26:19] lamb nature.
[1:26:21] You can't expect a wolf or any scavenger
[1:26:23] and expect a dove of peace to dwell in
[1:26:25] you. He won't do it. You have got to
[1:26:26] become a lamb. Your nature has got to be
[1:26:29] changed. And if you look at things
[1:26:31] different, you wouldn't fuss at the
[1:26:32] preacher when he preaches the strict
[1:26:34] oldfashioned Holy Ghost religion. You
[1:26:36] will just get rid of that wolf spirit or
[1:26:38] that scavenger spirit and get the lamb
[1:26:40] nature and you're ready to forfeit all
[1:26:41] the things that you once done. All your
[1:26:43] worldly privilege. That's true. As I'm
[1:26:45] standing there, Christian friends,
[1:26:46] humble yourselves.
[1:26:48] Don't try to know it all.
[1:26:50] See how much you can forget of what you
[1:26:52] know
[1:26:52] is the best thing. only know one thing
[1:26:55] and that's Christ.
[1:26:56] When the Isuza's tree people humbled
[1:26:58] themselves and became lambs, the Holy
[1:27:00] Spirit came in,
[1:27:02] he will do that this very minute
[1:27:04] right here in this building. If we would
[1:27:05] be willing to play some things off, if
[1:27:08] we be willing to forfeit all the so-cal
[1:27:10] we have to humble ourselves and become
[1:27:12] lambs. And look how this message people
[1:27:13] get so arrogant because they have a few
[1:27:15] extra knowledge. Nobody popes, nobody
[1:27:17] Rome, nobody sees, nobody lamb or whatn
[1:27:19] not. And they can't even get a good
[1:27:20] fellowship, a good hug, a good love you.
[1:27:24] Oh my hallelujah.
[1:27:27] And then he talked of the story about
[1:27:28] the slave broker came by the plantation.
[1:27:31] They noticed one young man. He walked
[1:27:32] with his chest up, chin up. He didn't
[1:27:34] have to whip him. He was up and doing.
[1:27:36] The broker said, "I like to buy that
[1:27:37] slave." The plantation owner said, "He's
[1:27:39] not for sale." What make him different?
[1:27:41] Is he the boss over there? No, he's just
[1:27:43] a slave. You feel him better? know he is
[1:27:45] with the rest of them. What makes him
[1:27:47] different? I didn't know myself until
[1:27:48] one day I learned over in his homeland
[1:27:50] where he came from his father is the
[1:27:52] king of a tribe.
[1:27:53] Amen.
[1:27:54] And though he's an alien and pilgrim, he
[1:27:56] keeps the moral of the rest of them up
[1:27:58] because he's know he's the son of a
[1:28:00] king.
[1:28:01] Amen.
[1:28:01] What kind of people we ought to be?
[1:28:03] Hallelujah.
[1:28:03] Pilgrims and strangers. We ought to
[1:28:05] conduct ourselves not like the rest of
[1:28:08] the world but separate ourselves from
[1:28:09] the things of the world. Keep your chin
[1:28:10] up because there's one thing we know. We
[1:28:12] are sons and daughters of the world of
[1:28:15] God.
[1:28:16] There's a way back there to experience.
[1:28:19] Conduct ourselves as sons and daughters.
[1:28:20] Not dressed like the world. Nothing to
[1:28:22] put on. Oh my. I'm going to finish.
[1:28:25] Oh my.
[1:28:27] And I was praying, God, how can we have
[1:28:31] to return to the street when we will not
[1:28:34] listen to the dove of God? God, it will
[1:28:36] take hard judgment. It may take death in
[1:28:38] the family. It may make something. But
[1:28:41] I'm sure God if we'll ask you whatever
[1:28:43] it takes to bring us back to God.
[1:28:45] Bring back oldfashioned meetings.
[1:28:47] Bring back humility among the saints.
[1:28:49] Bring back the power of God into our
[1:28:51] churches. Shave us tonight. Take the
[1:28:53] world away from us.
[1:28:55] Take everything that's unlike you away
[1:28:56] God. Fill us with the Holy Spirit. Oh
[1:28:59] dove of God. Fly down from these
[1:29:01] banisters. Fly down from the pinnacle of
[1:29:03] this temple here, Lord. and dwell these
[1:29:05] hearts
[1:29:06] that they're waiting just now for the
[1:29:08] baptism of the Holy Ghost. The sharp
[1:29:10] twitch is stored. God bless. The dove is
[1:29:12] flying around the building. You believe
[1:29:13] it?
[1:29:14] The hour has come. The time has come.
[1:29:16] Open your hearts. Holy Spirit is here to
[1:29:18] baptize heal in Jesus name. I rebuke
[1:29:20] every devil
[1:29:21] and sickness cast him away that you go
[1:29:23] free. Let's all stand.
[1:29:24] Father God, we thank you tonight for
[1:29:27] these words chopped up. Lord, I pray
[1:29:28] that you just blended together. Oh God,
[1:29:31] us rises as it was and may the saints of
[1:29:34] God drink it down that we are due an
[1:29:37] outpouring of your spirit. We have a
[1:29:39] direct word from you. Father, I will
[1:29:41] pour out my spirit that we are returning
[1:29:43] tonight to our original inheritance of
[1:29:46] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Father,
[1:29:49] send fire upon your people tonight. We
[1:29:51] love you. We adore you. We thank you for
[1:29:53] breathing upon us, receiving the Holy
[1:29:56] Ghost. Thank you for your breath
[1:29:57] tonight, Lord. The breath of God upon
[1:30:00] our lives. Oh hallelujah. Have your way
[1:30:02] Jesus. Send fire upon the people. Send
[1:30:05] fire out to all those who hear the tape.
[1:30:07] Send fire those who hear tonight in the
[1:30:09] name of Jesus. May your fire fall. We
[1:30:12] need you Lord. You said national force
[1:30:14] will put the world the churches in the
[1:30:16] work of the churches but the power of
[1:30:18] God will put the people in the bride.
[1:30:20] Send your power Lord and put your people
[1:30:23] in the bride. In Jesus name we ask it.
[1:30:26] Thank you
[1:30:29] Jesus
[1:30:35] for the grace that you have
[1:30:39] given us.
[1:30:43] And though I can repay
[1:30:47] from my heart, let say
[1:30:53] that I thank you.
[1:30:57] Hallelujah. Thank you Jesus. Thank
[1:31:02] you. Oh sweet Jesus
[1:31:08] for the great for the grace that you
[1:31:13] have
[1:31:15] gone

[1:31:23] from my heart
[1:31:25] to say
[1:31:32] I want you to worship a little Let's
[1:31:33] just give the Lord some praises right

[1:32:17] Jesus.

[1:33:02] given us
[1:33:05] though I can't repay
[1:33:08] from my heart
[1:33:11] to save.
[1:33:16] [Music]
[1:33:20] Oh my.
[1:33:21] What a presence here tonight.
[1:33:24] Glory.
[1:33:26] Hallelujah.
[1:33:28] Oh, we love you, Jesus.
[1:33:31] Thank you, Lord.
[1:33:32] Let's bow our heads. Father, we pray
[1:33:34] bless the offering and be picked up and
[1:33:35] be used for the fruit of the gospel in
[1:33:38] Jesus.
[1:33:39] Amen.
[1:33:41] And though I care every day
[1:33:45] from my heart, I'd like to say,
[1:33:50] oh my,
[1:33:52] thank
[1:33:53] you.
[1:33:55] God answers prayer. Our God
[1:34:00] answer.
[1:34:04] So keep on praying. Oh, Friday night
[1:34:06] prayer meeting. Lord
[1:34:09] I
[1:34:11] pray
[1:34:13] encourage people to come out Friday
[1:34:15] night. God
[1:34:22] he's so
[1:34:24] [Music]
[1:34:26] good to
[1:34:29] me. Let's bow heads.
[1:34:32] Father, we thank you tonight for your
[1:34:33] word. We thank you Lord for your love
[1:34:35] and presence. God, you have been so good
[1:34:36] to us. And Lord, when the two of trees
[1:34:39] are gathered, truly, you are in our
[1:34:41] midst
[1:34:42] and we appreciate that so much, Lord. If
[1:34:44] without your presence, we'll just be
[1:34:46] just killing time just saying words. But
[1:34:49] Lord, just to feel the angel of God and
[1:34:51] the presence of life among us. It's such
[1:34:55] a blessing, Father, of every service to
[1:34:57] come into your presence. It is life to
[1:34:59] be in your presence. Is dead to be
[1:35:01] outside your presence. Lord God, we
[1:35:02] thank you for the presence, the angel of
[1:35:04] your presence. Father, go with your
[1:35:06] people now. May the angel go with them
[1:35:08] in Jesus. Amen.
[1:35:09] Grab your seats. I just come forward.
[1:35:12] God bless you. See you on Friday.
[1:35:15] Looking forward to tar with the Lord.
[1:35:16] Amen. God bless you.
[1:35:20] Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:35:24] Praise the Lord. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:35:28] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:35:31] [Music]
[1:35:41] Thank you Jesus.
[1:35:43] [Music]
[1:36:00] Somewhere.
[1:36:02] [Music]
[1:36:21] [Music]
[1:36:26] Hallelujah.
[1:36:28] [Music]
