to be here today lord your prophet when he was on earth he said this is the best time that we have now you're gonna get worse and worse and worse father the prophet isaiah told us that gross darkness will cover the earth and gross darkness the people but you promised light in the evening time help us dear god we are living in dreadful times but we ask that your holy spirit will come along in a special way and minister to us and meet our every need and help us help your sons and daughters help those ministers of the gospels those shepherds lord that struggling with the sheep with the responsibility and the comfortability that as a time is at hand god honor your word among us this morning this night in jesus name we ask it amen and amen you may be seated oh blessed be the name of the lord but we bring greetings tonight uh from the headstone tabernacle trinidad we're ingredients to you in jesus name on a tongue but a sigma is family in church for this invitation to be here i want to greet also the fellow ministers fellow laborers in the gospel of jesus christ i want to appreciate all the ministers that has spoken before by the biscar but a pruitt or a kante but isaac but hildebrand god bless you all in your time of labor i want to thank brother zigman for the courage to do what he has done and i you know but abram taught us to look to see a man's motive and objective to see what he's trying to achieve if he's trying to do something for the kingdom of god and i believe that is what it's all about so sad today to see men establishing themselves the kingdom the empire and and so on but friends all this power play and empire building and stuff is just temporary because the train is in the block and the train picks up people along the way and exit others along the way but abraham exited its train in 1965 and that train continues on this rapture express as the rapture expressed to glory and we don't know if this is the last meeting we're gonna ever have we don't know what tomorrow holds and i try to approach the puddle pit what i'm saying as if this is my last service as if this is my last sermon what i'm going to tell god's people because that's who you are you're god's people sometimes you don't know who you are and take something to reveal to you who you are i don't want to know well she didn't know she was a daughter of god she didn't know she was a child of god she didn't know her name was in the book but jesus took time off to come her way and he didn't want to talk about all what she did he wanted to show her there was a seed inside of her that was more important than all what she did and if she could get a revelation of what was inside of her what god put inside of her it'll make a whole difference all together and change her very life so this evening i have this message as a tribute to malachi 4. this is what i have this evening upon my heart and i want you to stand we want to go into the scriptures but this message is dedicated to the testimony in life a tribute to william marin brown and malachi 4 elijah prophet and the scriptures we have this evening is matthew chapter 17 reading from verse 8 to 12 and acts chapter 3 reading from verse 12 to 21. the title of the message is the times of the restitution of all things that's the title the times of the restitution of all things and have an inspiration i will restore saith the lord read in matthew chapter 17 reading from verse 8 this is after jesus was adopted on the mountain and when peter got an anointing to try to build three tabernacles the voice had to shut him up and tell him to don't bother with that and then they had lift up their eyes they saw no man saved jesus only and as they came down the mountain jesus charged them saying tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead and the disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that elias must first come and jesus answered and said unto them elias truly shall first come and restore all things but i say unto you that elias has come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them acts chapter 3 we want to read verse 12 this is after peter raised the man up that was crippled at the gate called beautiful and the people was looking at peter and then peter this is verse 12 and then peter saw it he answered unto the people he men of israel why marveling at this or why look so earnestly on us as though by our own power or holiness we have made this man to walk the god of abraham and of isaac and of jacob the god of our fathers had glorified his son jesus whom you delivered up and denied him in the presence of pilate when he was determined to let him go but he denied the holy one and the just and desired a murderer to be granted unto you and kill the prince of life whom god had raised from the dead wherever we are witnesses and his name true faith in his name had made this man strong whom you see and know ye the fate which is by him had given him this perfect songness in the presence of you all and now brethren i what that true ignorance he did it as did also your rulers but those things which god before had showed by the mouth of all his prophets that christ should suffer he had so fulfilled repented therefore and be converted that your sins may be blooded out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord and he shall send jesus christ which before was preached unto you and this is where i get my thought from whom the heaven must receive until the times of the restitution of all things which god had spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began let's bow our heads with a prayer kind father i pray that your holy spirit will come down in a special way may your pillar of fire drop on my shoulder and speak lip to air to your people you promise once more the world will hear direct from god speak to our hearts we are such a needy people father help us edify us bill us strengthen us inspire us anoint us pour out upon us confirm a word with signs wonders and miracles we ask in jesus name amen you may be seated praise god but i brought him from five identifications he said you cannot organize a kingdom of which christ is the head you cannot denominate a kingdom which christ is the head because christ is king and you cannot take the intellectuals of man and make an organization to which christ will govern therefore any companies any peoples any groups of men that tries to organize the kingdom of god is going contrary to the king and if they are going contrary to the king it would be against the king and if it's against the king it will be antichrist now that's pretty rough an antichrist spirit tries to take a people and call them from organization to organization organizing them together which never was the will of god people has always fussed at me because i struck so hard at organizations it isn't the people in there that i'm striking at it's that dominating spirit that makes the people think we are the people god's people is a called out people i believe they are in every denomination they could be catholic they could be protestant that was that time in this time it could be disinterpretation that interpretation that group that country it doesn't matter they could be jewish they could be kind of what kind of church but the real church here we go is the mystical body of jesus christ and you cannot organize the mystical body of jesus christ by inspiration by doctrine by teaching you still can't do it because it's a mystery it's the mystical body of jesus christ and by one spirit we are baptized into that one body hallelujah hallelujah and once you go into that body nobody can take you out oh give the lord some praises people god's church is free [Applause] god church is bound by no boundaries every human being on earth belongs to him whether he is catholic protestant whatever he is god seek those with an honest heart and we are saved by faith believe in him now you see the church is not an organization people ask he asks are you a christian answer i'm a baptist that don't answer the question at all are you a christian i am pentecost that don't answer the question if you are a christian you are a born-again creature you are a mystic kingdom of god your eyes are not on the things of this world what are the things about and that is the church it is not an organization it can never be an organization this is the prophet take me on record the church of the living god can never be any certain group i want to say it again the church i'm not talking about your church i am talking about the church of the living god jesus said upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell can't prevail against him there is going to be a church hallelujah universal international governed by god ruled by god not message popes or bishops or potential powers all hallelujah are people that god has called out oh hallelujah praise god so i say that take me on record the church of the living god can never be any certain group i don't care what our group teaches what doctrine they have it cannot be a certain group it cannot be i have it you don't have it it cannot be this group here have the angel and this group don't have the angel it cannot be this group is right and this is wrong no one spirit one spirit one lord one baptism one god one elijah one message let me be seated restitution the word it means the act of restoring to the rightful owner something that has been taken away lost or surrendered it also means a return to or restoration of a previous state or that's what the word restitution means restoring to the rightful owner now but assadison church i want to bring a backdrop here he was speaking about martin luther was not the only one protesting the catholic church there were others god time was ripe for a definite move of the restoration of the church to an outpouring of the holy ghost at a later date watch they had the written word but not the reveal word this was the reformation period god was about to take the church out from the depth of satan of the dark ages into the depth of god so god was doing a work to bring the church back because the heaven must receive jesus until the restitution or the restoration of all things so based upon the scripture i am convinced that all things that has to be restored all what the counterwork all what the caterpillar or what the locusts all what has been broken up messed up in this message god said i will restore he didn't even ask you if you interested in restoration it's not about you it is his word he said he said he said i gonna be restored or i feel good tonight that the restoration is on the move for the bride is on hallelujah glory to god from laotian church age brother branham now watch the seventh age messenger he's a prophet not only do we see this messenger coming in revelation 10 7 but we find the word speaks of elijah before jesus returns and brother branham read the script to be read our disciples ask him why say the scribe elias must first come because the teachers and the preachers they preaching this and liars must first come and watch and restore all things before the coming of our lord elijah must come back for a work of restoration of the church then he quote malachi 4 scripture scripture we're familiar with behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and revelation of the lord and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the church to their fathers least i come and smite the good for the curse there is absolutely no doubt elijah must return before the coming of jesus he has a specific work to accomplish that work is in malachi 4 6 that says he will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers so that's barbara job that's his job description he didn't come for us to have message churches all over the world he didn't come for us to give out books and tapes he came specifically to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers so every book every tape every message the objective of that is to turn your heart to turn our hearts back to the faith not church defeat not effect defect there was only one fate let's continue laurie central now this messenger of malachi 4 and revelation 10 7 is going to do two things [Applause] not 50 things not a hundred things two things one according to malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders of revelation 10. which are the revelations contained in the seven seals it will be it will be these divinely reveal mystery truths that would literally literally literal more hallelujah hallelujah literally turn the hearts of the children back to the father exactly so the prophet for the last age here we go must be bringing a message from god that will forerun the second coming of the lord for his message will with the heart of the church return back to the pentecostal fathers here we go are you ready and with the restoration of the world will come the restoration of power [Applause] may be seated remember the pentecostal received dynamics but it didn't produce the fruit of restoration because they didn't have the word so you can receive spirit without word they had gifts they had signs and wonders they had miracles but they couldn't go on to adoption which is what porter branham come to introduce [Music] he came to introduce the age of adoption because this restoration is to return us back to eden this restoration is to turn us back to what adam had and adam had the book adam had the book but when adam fell he lost it and that book went in the hands of the original owner so this is genesis here this is adam losing the book here and the book stays up there until the end of time i elijah messenger coming here to wait for the book a mighty angel have to take the book bring down the book open the book for you to see your name so i can't share with you just bible stuff or or just you know information about the pope about time magazine about what happened in america or venus and mars or the constellation and pluto means this and then this one and what could it be this and could it be this i'm not here what could it be but abraham didn't come but could it be he can be just scared the lord hallelujah listen to what the bible said behold i sent you elijah before the great and terrible day of the lord and he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers oh hallelujah i say unto you elias has already come hallelujah hallelujah i say unto you he has already come and he has done his job so the restoration of the word means the restoration of the power before elijah could come to his message he has to tap the loose ends that's what he said the malachi for elijah the seventh injured had no certain message but his job was to tap the loose end so he said the elijah prophet had to open six seals because christ was the seventh seal malachi 4 a son of man could only open six seals because christ himself was the seventh seal so elijah come and tap all the loose ends to talk about the pope and catholic church and all these different kinds of things that's what he did isn't that right hallelujah when he finished he's ready for his message which was the seventh seal the first three series history fought see this prophecy fifteen the souls under the altar six season judgment where are you at so god take a bride listen and slip up under the sub and see you silence only for half an hour half an hour is fixed only half an hour but that silence is about to be broken and we will see the contents of what was under that seventh seal oh hallelujah praise peter jesus oh blessed be the name of the lord so let's continue the age started off in the 20th century i was the age but as it was to be the age in which the true church would return to being the bride she was at pentecost we know that there must be necessarily a retained dynamic power we know that we have to go back to dynamic power that's that's the promise watch the believers sense this in their spirits and begin crying to god for a new authority in the first century what seemed to be the answer came as many began to speak in tongues and manifest gifts of the spirit it was then believed that this was indeed the long-awaited restoration it was not for here we go the latter rain can only come after the former rain which is a spring or teaching rain the latter rain is the harvest ring how could this be the real thing when the teaching rain had not come the prophet messenger who was to be sent to teach the people and turn the hearts of the children back to pentecostal fathers had not yet come thus what was thought to be the restoration yes yes yes what was taught to be the restoration and the final quickening unto the rapture had not come in it was a mixture of the unrighteous partaking of spiritual blessing and manifesting in the holy ghost it is also devil power as men were under the control of devils yet no one seemed to realize it then to prove it was not real these people second generation organized and wrote on scriptural doctrines here we go and build their own fences as every other group ahead have done and this is what doctrine does it build fences instead of bridges it build walls we believe this so we can fellowship with you we believe this so i can't come to your convention we believe this that's what doctrine does it build walls and god promised to send some rain and that rain gonna fall so much the ducks will begin to swim and you're gonna raise above every wall i will restore saith the lord not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the lord god almighty hallelujah glory so then joel 2 said all the flaws shall be full of wheat fat shall overflow with wine and oil oh this is a prophecy only time was barren all the time was hardship but god said the fat shall overflow and wine will overflow and i will restore to you the years the locals have eaten the kangaroo and the caterpillar and palm oil migrate which i sent among you and you shall eat plenty and be satisfied in praise the name of the lord your god that i just want to see with you and my people shall never be ashamed now it says god is going to restore the lutheran church did not restore it started reformation the western age did not restore the pentecostal age did not restore but god has to restore this is not the resurrection of the church it is the restoration god here we go we'll take the church right back to pentecost i believe that do you believe that hallelujah praise be to jesus now watch remember malachi 4 the message come before the terrible of the lord he said all denominations and creeds eat it down god said i will restore it again last days and it will be restored here we go god shall send the holy ghost in such a way note he did not say god's chance shall send doctrines and teachings in such a way no he did not say that we have a lot of doctrines and teachings he did not say that he said god will send the holy ghost in such a way upon planted word that will restore what's the secret the word is in the pride that's the secret that was always the secret god was always putting the word in the bread by books by tips by preachers by messages the word comes into the bride because the mystery of god come down from god as the word of god so as i receive the word you receive the mystery i am not hearing you i will say it again the mystery of god comes down from god as the word of god so as you receive the word you receive the mystery and christ is the mystery oh give the lord a shout give the lord some praises and we will always know when people get revelation you see when it's just intellectual shake your head do it like that amen glory but when revelation breaks it brings stimulation you see revelation is wine revelations make a stagger revelation make a shout you can't cross your leg with that's that's no revelation that is no revelation whatsoever but once you get revelation when jesus told that woman go call your husband she said i have none but the one he said you're one living with is not yours and when jesus finished with her and said i am he she ran she couldn't walk okay jesus okay thank you jesus no no no no no no she couldn't do that she began to run come see a man come see a man come see a man but you know what's wrong in this message if i want to send knowledge and increase knowledge shall increase it's so much our books it's so much that tapes it's so much information that people will get in the spirit but when john got in the spirit bible said john said i was in the spirit i'm sorry your door from heaven when john when they get in your spirit and that's what the worship is for that's why the devil hates worship people intellectual want information writing down notes so you're not part of sight forget about the notes you don't need to note you don't need to write nothing down you need to worship honor glory might power dominion onto the land forever [Applause] my god hallelujah glory to god hallelujah praise god maybe you see that praise god my lord when jesus when peter told that man he was lame silvan go have i none that's the feature okay it didn't say and peter was walking the gate quite beautiful and he handed him a book and said read that he didn't say play a tape listen to that no that wasn't the fate the faith was silver and gold but i don't have i don't have that but i've got something such as i have i could release it i could give it yes yes you have to give it rise up and walk in the name of jesus christ that's the fate and you know what that man began to do he began to jump and leap and praise god maybe you never sin enough maybe he never was done in hell maybe you never was in trouble enough to begin to praise and thank your god one of one of the sickest things to see is ministers that don't want to worship i want the sickest things to see ministers that can't praise god and can't worship and can't thank god you'll get trouble in heaven you get trouble across there you know about rapturing condition you may be seated the astronauts what what isaac was talking about before they go up there they have to rehearse down here they have to go in the atmosphere of where they are going and if you want to go to heaven if they want to go to up deer you have to rehearse down here [Applause] thousands angels worship the four peace worship living creatures worship the elders worship angels worship hallelujah you can't expect to go over yonder without any atmosphere even the disciples have to wait for an atmosphere they were in the upper room creating atmosphere because holy ghost can't come on dry holy ghosts can't come and dry they were praising god continually hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah they were present god continually they were praising god if you don't feel like it praise god your hand don't want to go and push it up say hallelujah praise glory to god i'm not carrying you i'm not hearing you i'm not hearing you i want to hear you [Music] let me see that how are you going to sing the song of the redeemed that was redeemed us by thy blood a holy ghost film man john he wept because no man was found worthy angel was worthy but he needed a man a king's man all of a sudden out of a tendency the lamb stepped forward and took the book not for himself no for his wife he took the book and he began to release that book and began to break the seals and john said all in heaven all on the earth all john's had to go in different dimensions his voice his worship his praise start to break in different dimensions all under it all under the earth heard i praise god when the lamb took the book because we shall reign on the earth [Applause] you believe that all those believers up there want to stay up there that is not their promise their promises back to the earth and if we have to reign up there we have to demonstrate it down here that's why god put adam to control the beast of the field and everything else and to show the book has been restored god led brother branham to face a killer bull out in the field he even got his gun it's a killer bull they had a reputation it's not a weaving bull it's a killable that's right and brother branham fought him caught found himself caught in that field dealing with this killable i said something came over him it wasn't doctrine came over him it wasn't a teacher and came over here no something came over here it was love it was the spirit of god something came over him something this something is what we're talking about do i know all mysteries do i understand all mysteries do i have all knowledge do i give my body to be burned i could know new name mystery seven thunder mystery mystery trump mystery vile the plagues the wolves every mystery hidden mystery written hidden mystery or kind of mystery if i don't have the love of god i am nothing it will take perfect love to go across there glory to god you may be seated and i have news for you the killer bull is not found in church you don't find a killer bull getting a seat in church no you find it killable on the outside so what you come to church for is to equip you to deal with what is on the outside god will have a powerful bride a bridegroom be restored back just like the day of pentecost an original bride there were cowards in the upper room but notice what happened when the holy ghost came peter slammed the door open hallelujah my god they can't wait to get outside they can't wait to testify you know why jesus said you shall receive power after the holy ghost come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me so when the holy ghost came it brought witnessing power power to declare god present tense oh glory to god so you stand there and say peter you're cursed that's right you deny christ that's right but i have something you don't have because i just come on the upper room so you can talk about me all that you please i will talk about you on my knees because my sins are under the blood i've been redeemed oh give the lord a shout in the house let the redeemed say so oh glory to god let the redeemed say so god will send the holy ghost in such a way you see the prophet saying you could get enough holy ghost to say i'm saved and if i surrender now you can get more holy ghost until signs and wonders still god begin to come out your very body that's the power of virtue because you see brother branham restored back wow he released the spirit of prophecy isn't that right we have received the testimony of jesus which is the spirit of prophecy isn't that right what brother brown brought was a prophetic vision many ministers and many people haven't caught that he brought an actual vision the vision is what makes a difference the vision gives you an oversight a complete picture and the vision means a restoration of the ministry of jesus christ not man ministry this brother ministry that part of ministry we're not talking about that we had it for 50 years we want the ministry of jesus christ oh could we get a shout in the halls that's the promise the prophetic vision identifies the restoration of the ministry of jesus christ amongst the people when bahrain says the world will hear direct from god he said how shall we know it's the voice of god back then it wasn't a vindicated prophet how shall we know the voice of god today it will be a manifestation of the prophet's word so we are supposed to say this is that that the prophet william branham speak of amen not what we speak what the prophet spoke that's what peter did this is that that the prophet joel hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah listen friends we are promised a seven thunder revival you might be seated he said the bride hadn't had a revival yet it will take those seven thunders to wake her up again it will take you taught a man from somewhere else said that no the prophet said seven times give fate i didn't say that he said say what the tip say he said the seventh will gather the bride together that's not my words that's his words he said the seventh honorable show the right how to prepare that's not my word that's his word he said wait till them seven thunders after the voices of that group they're going to shut the hell they could open the heavens oh yes heaven could open up tonight hallelujah hallelujah heaven could open up tonight those are not my words those are his words oh my praise god what has to be restored what was lost to begin with but ibrahim in the breach when adam lost his life he lost his inheritance in life because he had supreme control of the earth he was the god of the earth small g god was the god of the universe big g and everywhere but his son had the earth under his control he could speak he could name he could say he could stop nature he could do anything he wanted to let's go back to the ball when baltimore said bull go and slide down there that was adam again having power over the beast of the field so that has been vindicated so adam just not only lost his life he lost his inheritance in life so one and when i fell i tried to access the power he saw something on the screen mark access denied access denied all the time he had free access but no access denied angels guard the tree of life adam escorted out of the garden of eden that was in the beginning but in this last day angel escorting the bride back to eden you're getting full access did you get that the same works i do shall you do also that's full access if you shall say to the mountain be moved and don't doubt that's full access the pride go now full access to all what jesus had hallelujah so adam loss his inheritance but i'm an adoption somebody has to leave use something to inherit it is that right and inheritance do we have what inheritance did i have i didn't have any but god left me an inheritance when he put my name on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world you say now wait a minute brother jesus did that when he died for me no he never jesus come to purchase that narrative for me read the next verse in whom we obtain an inheritance being predestinated according to his own goodwill look predestinated us unto his inheritance if i'm a right inheritance of something if god is knocking in my heart and say william branham i called you a long time ago before the foundation of the world to preach the gospel i have an inheritance an inheritance of eternal life god sent jesus to make that inheritance real to me because there was nothing i could inherit it it was blank but jesus the lamb slain here we go from the foundation of the world his blood was shed that i may go to my inheritance to be what what inheritance to sonship to be a son of god to be a son of god not not what we are right now this is fallen man son of god is attribute sons of his spirit that way son of god is jesus christ so he came to call other sons that didn't even know they were sons peter come john come james come he was calling them they didn't know what they were being called unto but he was calling them he was calling them to positionally place them for manifestation manifestation god call you not just to sit on a church bench not to sit in the church god call you to be a manifested son [Applause] yeah you might be seated the five-fold ministry is temporary you know i hear so much about fifo and five-fold and five-fold and who in the four who not in the fall and everything else but that fifo ministry is until we all come to the unity of the faith to the knowledge of the son of god onto a perfect man in other words you going to know who you are you're going to know where you come from you're going to know where you're going then afterwards they do no man to teach you afterwards all the minister is going to edify the body because you will come into a perfect realization of where you come from and where you're going you'll be in a state of perfection what man you need over your life what man do you need to rule you when you come into that perfect oneness with god so what man lost was his sonship his inheritance that's what the book is all about this is not a difficult message ministers sometimes make it complex not gordon complexity is god in simplicity that book held the mystery of our names that book held the mystery of inheritance all was sealed up in that book oh my watch this might just choke you but did you know that that men that are sons of god are amateur gods how many knows that watch they were gods they had full domain dominion over the world he gave them dominion over all things he lost his godship he lost his sonship he lost his domain and satan took it over but brother you're what we're waiting for we are waiting for the manifestation of the sons of i love that here i'm waiting for for conventions and churches and groups and so on and notices of what we have no no you're waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god who are they they are around the world did you hear that they are around the world so if somebody thinks they are the only people on the beach something is wrong i am the only man of the man of the art forget about it forget about it get next to yourself brother brother branham said god could only find one man in the day of elijah one man but because here we go because it's half this time he has to find many men because it's half his time so we don't need less men we need more men we need more sons we need more preachers we need more sent ones we need more anointed man of god hallelujah we need men that heard from god that will go to the angel and take the book and eat the book and prophesy from the book [Applause] this is hard to deal with that way you see because we gone through two thousand of these national years so what people know is church pastors and preachers and people teaching bible night stories and whatnot the bible was a seal book until brother branham come all the years people preaching they were preaching from the book was sealed it took a prophet to unseal it that's where we get our message from a book that has been unsealed the mighty angel brought down the book not closed it brought down the book open that means all seven seas were ripped off don't come the angel with the book open hallelujah hallelujah the book is on the earth adam is on the act [Applause] the sons of god are coming back [Applause] the sons of god are coming back the sons of god are coming back [Applause] what about him he demonstrated what we have for the journey on our way to the rapture he demonstrated it son come out and shine four days pour over the element before the doctors and touches my wife the tumor will go now spoke more healing sister hearty right i give you your boys spoken with salvation he demonstrated little fish he had give back your life resurrection power he demo listen this is already vindicated we don't need nobody to say it is wonder if it's so it has already been vindicated that's a vindication the book has been restored i will restore so what by ram did he restore the bride to the full word the token by prophecy already you know you may be seated it comes like a computer program the program is written it's just written the press run at the appointed time just click and everything begin to unfold after that program when adam was when adam was on the earth god was so pleased to get somebody to talk to somebody to fellowship with god was so happy so pleased by the sigma at last he had a son expressed in his image and likeness every evening come down with cool in the evening talk to his son adam how was your day father it's so good i shifted this mountain 50 degrees to this way and i sent that river 10 miles down to the left adam was having a great time shifting things around and moving things are wrong and naming things are wrong having power over this and power over that and god says not good for you to be alone man you need somebody with you i'm going to get a wife for you i'm going to get a bride for you i'm going to pull something out to you man and god put him to sleep he put silence he put him in silence and for half an hour just making a type and afterwards he pulled something out of there and when adam saw her he said you are flesh of my flesh you are born of my bone you shall be called woman because you were taken out of man oh hallelujah praise god what a beautiful picture in the garden of eden i'll let i want you to notice that man fell it wasn't a boy he put in a gun in he put a man and the man fell so god said i'm going to reboot i'm going to reboot this whole system i'm going to bring babe i'm going to bring on something called the process of character development because adam didn't have no tests to get what he got i don't think i'm not trying to get what he got god just give him and praise him and it didn't work oh give the lord a shout give the lord a shout god just placed him and it did not work that man fell so god said you know what i'm going to reboot i'm going to bring her babe i'm going to bring protesting i'm going to trial the child of your fate i'm going to bring destin to give you character karate is not a gift character is a victory so i'm going to send you process so here come jesus there come jesus holy ghost fell on him full anointing fell on him and immediately first phase first move first thing print some business cards to say i am jesus no no business cards yet first thing was to send him into the wilderness to overcome the lust of the eyes lust of the flesh pride of life in other words send him in the willingness to overcome himself before god could give you power over others and other things you must have power over yourself i think that with repeating i think that would repeat it that's why god not releasing power just like that because it's trouble if it's so much trouble no much as if god gave people power they might speak others out of existence they will do all kinetics this one do like this one this will not fellowship with this one this one can't talk to this one it will be trouble so god can't do that he no no you gotta forgive me tonight i'm i'm jumping all over you may be seated jesus called the disciples peter come john come he didn't say peter bring some of your friends and bring them let them come so peter have a group a clique coming with him no jesus called this one that one that one that one whether they talking to each other like is that that has nothing to do with it christ called all of them they had to work it out fight it out battle it out but they are all called of god that's the respects we must have for men that are called of god because no man didn't call me and no man can't uncall me i want to say that again no man then call me and they can't take the calling off of me and they can't take the calling off of you so forget it don't even think about it what i am called to do i've got to do it praise what i'm anointed to do i've got to do it i can only preach with the measure that god gave me oh hallelujah that's all i have all i have is my sling hallelujah and what god give me that's what i'm gonna use oh praise god so we are waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god listen who will come back and take it over again waiting here we go for the fullness of time when the pyramid gets to the top when the full sons of god will be manifested when what the pyramid comes to the top and on top there as far as i remember is brotherly kindness which is spirit of forgiveness and brotherly kindness is a killer and i love what god has done he put burly kindness in the right spot because god knows gonna have feuds and corals and forces and god will see if you not them not the other one if you will drop your oats if you will forgive if you would overcome by the spirit of forgiveness by putting yourself in your brother's place on the matter so people talk about faith and they have faith in our faith but faith is based upon forgiveness so if there is no forgiveness what faith you're talking about not even faith i pray for a headache so it has to be the spirit of forgiveness that brings out the faith in someone oh my even if you are right and they are wrong are you willing to take wrong for christ's sake and forgive and have that honey and have that brotherly kindness because it got to be it got to be that's what god put for our age our agenda books and tips and other manifesting them if that we win already we we we have arrived we gotta hold up our book are they talking to the age we have a spoken book mac's book one book sorry it got to be brotherly kindness across our chest it's got to be the life for this age do you believe that so brother branham says waiting for the fullness of time when the pyramid will get to the top when the full sons of god were manifested when the power of god will walk out and take every power that satan got away from him notice something to the trumpets revelation 10 1-7 all the mysteries are to be revealed to the bride by the messenger of the laotian church all all not some all all not somebody else have to come and get a revel no all has to be revealed by the prophet of malachi 4. it's in the books it's in the tapes but all has been revealed there was no 8th messenger there was no next messenger hallelujah there was only one messenger that's elijah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and his message is what for runs the second coming of the lord from the seventh seal for the branham he said notice here we go for the end of time message this seal talking about the seventh seal for the end time of message this seal he revealed all six seals but don't say nothing about the servant and the end time seal that's what he called the seven seal the end time seal when it starts starts it's a total secret according to the bible total secret at the end of the seven angels message all the mysteries of god will be known we are at the end time the opening of the seventh seal so the seventh seal let's see what silence under it that's the end time seal that's where we are at the opening of the seventh seal he said when it started silence now that was in jestersonville 24th of march 1963. buddha branham speaking and guide this is after he preached statue of perfect man the knight was the guy he said now the holy spirit always speaks his word i've got many things to tell you you cannot understand it no but when it comes he will guide you to it here we go that's the reason the coming of the seals at the finishing no you see when it's taxed it starts in silence now listen to his words at the finishing of the seventh seal the mystery of god should be finished to know who god is what he is how he lives his nature his being you are supposed to be all the way up here by that time he's referring to the statue of a perfect man he received at the finishing of the seven shield you're supposed to have faith virtue knowledge temp that's supposed to be in you by that time you're supposed to be way up the way by that time to see bring us into the full stature of sons and daughters of god oh hallelujah from unveiling of god brothers and sisters are you catching it those seven seas will be broke the full thing will come into view what took place all along the hour of the seventh angel's message all the mysteries of god should be made known in that elijah how are they revealingness christ is put on his church how he's revealed our son of man again how the church is to be put in order for the last day there we go no creed no denomination just the word living in the individual i will take one i would leave one no strings no denominations no binding is the heart and god alone no group no club no grouping no camp nothing like that just sons of god on the earth hallelujah the word living the word living the word living that is what god promised i'm almost finished this part here now remember the seventh seal is the end time of all things the things written in the seven seed book it is the end is the end of struggling world is the end of struggling nature is the end of the trumpets is the end of the vials is the end of the earth it even ends time time runs out now when the angel came down the angels swore time shall be no more we are about to break from time into eternity that angel already swore that oh man we are on borrowed time and one of the brothers of things about the pruitt one of them said there is no way out think about the pisco and that struck me in a way like it never struck me before you can't pay your way out of this you can't dig down and put some house under the ground out of this you can't hide from this ready or not it's coming there's only one way that's up what's coming up on the earth nothing could stop it all glory to god the judgment's already set nothing could stop it hallelujah there's seven thunder a raptor express train is stopping at hessin off praise god we on our way to the rapture oh glory to god get on board get on board get on board hallelujah yes one day this same train have a few more steps and one day the last passenger gonna get on the train there'll be no more stations to stop at no him that is filthy be filthy still him that is righteous gonna be righteous still no more stopping the final name in the book gonna be redeemed oh glory to god he redeemed your soul he redeemed your spirit now he's about to redeem your body by your baptism of fire all glory to god we are gonna leave here oh hallelujah glory to god amen thank you lord time shall be no more everything runs out the end of the seventh seal hallelujah but abram said redemption is in two parts coming out of going into an ephesians paralyzed the book of joshua and he said now in god ritual mercy now then we find out we have come to another ephesians another ephesians now where our intellectual denomination and so forth all our educational programs has come to its jordan we must have an ephesians again we must have an exodus to come out and go into the rapture now listen to this because this is a hidden mystery the bible only talk about seven ages up to laodicea but introduce a hidden mystery of our age called the bright age or the homeland or the eagle age or the age that there's going to be another ephesians what is he talking about let's find out so the church world to this day come along played its part but there is coming a time where it must cease it must do it there has got to be an ephesians of this journey there has got to come an ephesians and ephesus of this journey we are promised here we go are you ready according to revelation 10 according to luke 17 30 there has got to come an ephesians to this who could reveal that who could show us that it take a prophet to come to prophesy that we could expect not a corinthians not a galatians not the hebrews but an ephesians you will see why watch there must come an ephesians to this there is promising friends that these sevenfold mysteries of the word of god must be unfolding and it's in this laodicea that this takes place so therefore we luther couldn't get to it whereas he couldn't get it but now in the last days we are given to understanding by the word that we are going to understand it because it will come on ephesians 8 to it so our ephesians 8 will bring clarity to the word but abraham had to shout and he said i wish i had the voice of the archangel to bring it to a place where you could see it so we have promised the voice of the archangel to drop down to bring clarity to the vision that the prophet brought habakkuk said write the vision and make the vision plain the brother brandon brought the prophetic vision that the fightful ministry was supposed to make plain to the people [Applause] so friends we don't have our own message write the vision and make it plain that he that read it may run it may have an effect upon your life hallelujah so he said you're gonna you're gonna you're going to have it and when it comes in the scene to prove what there had been many men raised up and the time of malachi and matthew 400 years had been great men there was no prophet talk about john the baptist and to prove he was that ephesians made manifest john announced it so jesus brought call him the ephesians made manifest was jesus christ he was the word manifested itself oh blessed be the name of the lord and this is brother brandon here in paradox he said how do you do sir we are strangers to each other i don't know you both of us he says no it would be a paradox for something to happen to know what was wrong with you or something you had done or something you ought not to have done he said i cannot know it it would have to be a paradox because there was no way for anyone to know that outside of some revelation of the unseen that's right so here we go so that the audience not a show but they might see here we go that the ephesus is here and this is the thing that bridges between the nomination and glory land he promised it so in discernment but says not for sure but to prove that the ephesus is here this is the thing that bridges between denomination and glory lamb so before we go to glory land we have to cross a bridge called ephesians you see in ephesians there's only one lord there's only one fate there's only one baptism in ephesians husband love their wives in ephesians children listen to their parents in ephesians you put in the whole armor of god in ephesians you are predestinated unto adoption in ephesians there's the fifo ministry in ephesians is your perfection in ephesians you're no longer strangers or pilgrims but your fellow citizens hallelujah and moses only take them up to the promised land but just what took them over and just for his divisions so the five four minutes you have to take the break into ephesians oh my okay let me just go further here now oh glory to god hallelujah jesus in luke 21 24 says and they shall fall by the head of the sword that shall lead away captive unto nations and jerusalem shall be trodden down by the gentiles until the times of the gentiles be fulfilled friends the gentiles problem says doesn't have a lot of time you say the time of the gentile is a mystery all the bible speaks about is the times of the gentiles and it also speak about until the fullness of the gentiles come in but this revelation chapter seven i believe it is seven angels uh angel angel right from the east having the seed of the living god to seal the hundred and forty four thousand going to the jews but before god returned to the jews you have to close off the gentile dispensation where are we at tonight when the seal of god is about to go across to the jews there's got to be a ceiling for the gentile bride there's got to be a closing time off for the gentiles but abraham he says romans 11 25 or i'll read scripture i would not brethren the ignorant of this mystery lisa be wise in your own conceits that blindness and part is happened to israel until the fullness of the gentiles come in now from recognizing the message but the seventh angels message is to open the mystery of the seals calling the 11th hour gentile workers to receive the same pay the first our workers got that was the purpose to come back to same pay same signs same wonders same life same power that is the promise that's the purpose of the seals going open up to go back you see before we go to rapture we have to go back they were adopted but rapture time wasn't yet so they went into the ground we can't go forward without going back that's why he said the prophet was to go back and pick up the fate then we could go forward for rapture and faith wrapped in condition we have to pick up the fate that they had and the fate that they had wasn't debates and arguments and discussion on doctrine that wasn't the fate that they had they had a genuine power that was permanent and resident oh give the lord some praises it wasn't temporary power it was permanent residing power virtual power hallelujah glorious power apostolic power they had power they received power jesus promised them power and they had it this pride will have nothing less than that [Applause] oh hallelujah give the lord a shout say what there was a dark age that blocked them out then in the middle of the age looter wesley and there's to be an evening time message to receive the same thing the even time message is to restore back again or bring back the same thing oh brother give me a church full of the holy ghost god will do in one year what all theology fails to do in two thousand years you it till the anointing of the church strike home after the doors of the gentile is closed god will anoint the church of them him that is filled to be filthy still him that is righteously righteous still him as holy be holy still but always coming upon us and i picked it to a picture being snapped you caught filthy and snapped and that's the picture freeze right there you've got righteous freeze right there right you're still filthy still holy still go just take a picture that's it whatever condition you caught him that's it what are we living in daniel baran say he wasn't a gentile he was not a gentile but he saw the gentiles rise and fall he wasn't a gentile but he saw the gentile dispensation from start to finish from the head of goal ending up to the feet of iron clay and he said danny was reading what the same was we were reading this morning and he took words from jeremiah the prophet and daniel began to realize it's just two more years left to get out and he set himself in order to pray and then buddha brahman says and i pray to love but i say my inspiration about praying god if there ever was a time we ought to set ourselves to pray as we s his true servants we see by letters of the apostle by the warnings of the holy spirit with the last days the holy spirit speaks that in the last days men shall be headed high-minded lovers of pleasures modern lovers of god we understand that there's comes coughs in the last days i understand nation shall be against nation i understand women will pop their head off and wear short clothes and hide his shoes i understand more will be so low in the last days i understand preachers will be false shepherds in the last days that will compromise will not feed the people the word of god go after creeds and things instead but i understand there'll be a voice come in the last days crying out to go back to the original message back to the things of god i understand here we go that there will be a famine the churches will be so organized like they are today in this message that in the last days there will come a famine it will not be for bread and water only but for the hearing of the true word of god he's not talking about books and tapes that have tons of that so he's not talking about that he's talking about hearing the truth of god and people go from the east to the west not salt to hear the true word of god and they are so organized and tighten up that they will fail to hear it i understand my book i understand that that will take place just before the spirit leaves the gentile church to return to the jews hallelujah are you with me could we take a little more tonight almost true the law failed moses failed joshua took over and the holy spirit will come into the church this is the promise not men not organization he says but the holy spirit will get among the people and make her ready to go up and cross jordan oh hallelujah praise god do you believe that hallelujah praise the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord so god blinded israel purposely but abram says for you and i they cannot see because god blinded them to finish the transgression god cut them off purposely and blinding their eyes so we could get a chance to see and give us an opportunity and we walk around like we are somebody paul tell them here take heed how you do that take heed for if god spared not the natural branch how will he have any more mercy on the wild branch and we walk around say i'm presbyterian i am methodist i am baptist i am pentecostal that don't mean nothing to god you have got to be born again by the holy spirit oh daniel shut up the words and see the book till the time of the end seal it up till the time of the end close up the words and steal the book what did he do he sealed up the vision and prophecy but ibrahim said that now the gentiles wasn't allotted any time he just said the time of the gentiles and we find out that jesus didn't even lock them at times oh my hallelujah for jerusalem shall be trotted down of the gentiles until the time of the gentiles be fulfilled then there is a lot of time but nobody knows when it will be it's a mystery remember in the time of the persecution there will be millions of gentiles will die that rejected bride the remnant of the woman's seed the sleeping vision many places but i'm saying millions will die oh hallelujah praise god you know what daniel saw right a stone cut out without the hands of man man it not bringing that stone that stone came out without the hands of man and brown said what happened at that time he said daniels he watched a gentile age until the stone out of the mountain that wasn't cut with hands they never put a capsule on the pyramid so he's tying them with the capsule now ah are we getting somewhere but ram tying it with the capstone the clothes of the age we're looking for power we're looking for capstone we're looking for dynamics but here's all together he said watch he said no the stone they never put a capsule on that pyramid it wasn't caught up by man's hand it's god's hand that cut that stone what did it do it hit the image right smack in the feet and broke it up the pieces what happened at that time the coming of that stone up when the church in the glory of the rapture caused it ended the gentile dispensation god ended it up with the coming of that stone so the coming of dynamics to the mechanics the coming of the capstone that going to end the gentile dispensation the baptism of the holy ghost with gifts cannot move the bride it will protect charity it will take dynamics it will take the power it will take christ the person of the holy ghost himself oh hallelujah hallelujah he christ is that stone he is he watch and the church calls the strength of the headstone run to the church like a magnet and the headstone is the holy ghost what the heck son is it's the holy ghost and every one of us that have the here we go the magnetism of the holy ghost when that stone strike the image it will flee to it and will be taken back into glory so you have to have something in you that the holy ghost could connect with he didn't say what doctrine you have he said the magnetism of the holy ghost it's got to be in you when that big magnet begins to sweep over the world it must pick you up because you are magnetized hallelujah with the magnetism of the holy ghost oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah praise god hallelujah hallelujah how that magnet is coming down that magnet coming down to kill you pick you up oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah glory to god brother branham he is the dynamics of the mechanics the mechanics of the church what is it apostles prophets teachers fight for ministry becomes god mechanics on earth and he could work that mechanics because god couldn't use a pentecostal because we're just spirit upon men flesh but god changes operations he says i'm going to use the word in men so you put the word in men and men become a channel of god that the fire of god could flow through them adoption time i don't have the code for it quran says where you could say dear is my spirit flowing freely not doctrine not teaching we are teaching for years mechanics for years explanation for years testimonies for years you're not talking about that talking about a man so died out a channel a pipe of god a channel of communication for inspiration to flow through fire coming out of the man's mouth how do holy ghost fallen upon them that heard the word what happened peter is in the body he's a channel of god he's a branch of god connected to the vine of god producing the fruit of god being glorified god hallelujah glory to god my lord my lord praise god praise god wow now the spirit the dynamics of the promised word to get into his church and drive them to calvary under unto the rapture there you are so before you go into the rapture there's a cross see you so quiet again because the cross super church super race everybody on fire and so on but the dynamics going to drive you you have got to die i think you're long in the message i think how much books you have i must tell you're going to die [Applause] you're all going to die drive us to calvary oh hallelujah and then into the rapture a man is permitted to travel so far but it's a separation line between life and death he must never cross you can go on with a little foolishness for a while but you better know where that line is did the lord ever check you on anything pull you up on anything say that's fine enough oh hallelujah you better be careful oh blessed be the name of the lord so god never did god use a group every time any group organized god left it praise god therefore during the reformation they come right from reformers as this embassy will prove we find the scripture in malachi 4 this feast of the trumpets that there is to be an anointing come down to restore again the original fate to bring faith to the people to the original pentecostal that anointing have to come down and i believe that the age has come now where the miraculous the phenomenal the baptism of the spirit the power the signs the wonders this great point out of god's spirit in the last days that's the thing that will bring faith into the people that will take our rapture and faith and take the church into the glory so we could cry we could sigh we could sing that's not what the prophet said he said this is the thing the holy spirit the spirit have to begin to move the spirit has to begin to fall this is what god promised all i could preach is promises this message is a message of promises i didn't come to bring my feelings to you i didn't come to bring a dream to you i come to bring a dust here the lord promised from a 20th century prophet to you you see even if you don't see it the way we said it still doesn't change what he said oh hallelujah question okay wow question answers if the church is saved even though she doesn't go to the rapture and i believe you taught she must go through the tribulation for purifying what about these that are dead how will they be purified the bride don't need no purification she's already purified those that are dead back there they never receive the light that these church open has received they live by justification and sanctification like that they live to the light that they had maybe in a way they suffered whatever they went through with their persecutions here we go but now in this rapture in time like this there will have to come a time now that this bride that rejects the head part of the bride now he's talking about the church he's talking about the church in this message that reject the head part of the bride listen listen in this rapture in time there will come a time that the bride that reject the head part of the bride will have to suffer for her rejection because the gospel wasn't made plain back there like it being made plain to you you see it's so plain you have had all these years examples the sea is open the church is laid out everything else it's so plain you can't miss it so then if you fully reject it there's only one thing to do suffer for it so after the bride was raptured will any of the foolish virgins be saved or will they be lost no everything will be finished for the gentile church when the bride is taking off the earth the spirit of god leaves the earth here this filthy be filthy still he that is righteous is righteous still here is holy is holy still in other words the sanctuary becomes smoky the attorney stands to plead the case christ leaves the sanctuary his day of material work is over the rapture comes and there is no more miracle work christ comes to claim his material work now just me in a minute will the foolish virgin be saved no whatever happens now after that she will have to go through the tribulation period and this is the bomb and the reason of it is because she has rejected the atonement in its fullness now this is very important these words are very important he didn't say that she rejected the atonement no she rejected the atonement in its fullness let's continue she is a professed believer but she will have to go through the tribulation period but for recognizing today's message don't want moses and elijah same condition he said death doesn't do anything to a man but changes dwell in place death doesn't change in your nature it doesn't change your it doesn't change your fate it doesn't change nothing in you but your dwelling place so which way your nature is this morning if you're thought of god's word you won't be a you would be a doctor over there i don't care who you are how you live how good you live it wouldn't change you one bit to die just your dwelling place and if you can't accept the whole word of god the way it is written you wouldn't do it over there don't worry you won't be there you have got to accept it in its fullness in the power of its vindication and the revelation of what it is then you become part of it you have to accept it in its fullness in its vindication and its revelation then you are part of it oh hallelujah oh glory to god let's continue these are the trumpets it's the end time the greedy of the lord is at him the feast of the messiah now in revelation 11 talking about moses of elijah calling israel out of jewish tradition just as the seventh angels message called the bright out of pentecostal tradition moses and elijah is to call israel out of the old atonement of lamb and sheep unto the real living sacrifice to the word and the seventh angel's message under the same trumpet same every same seal is to call the people the bride here we go out of the pentecostal world tradition to the genuine atonement the word christ impersonated in his word made flesh among us now here we go he's repeating himself the same as those two prophets did remember the gentile bride is to have a prophet called elias elijah to call them out of their tradition the bride just the same as these prophets called the jews out of judaism the christ the atonement and the gentiles here we go the gentiles already knows the atonement so the atonement is not the issue that's why i told you note he used the word fullness of the atonement the atonement is not the issue he said it is a call the bride back to the original atonement that's the difference all the pentecostal know jesus died for my sins christ is the atonement he's not talking about that he's talking about your recent atonement back to the day of pentecost hallelujah the fullness of the atonement speaking about the bride she spin from the church from the church body they cut her off soon from a master just like joseph was spitting from the brethren because he was the word jesus was spinning on the brethren because he was the word the church is spitting the bride is spitting from the church oh hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord from invisible you and the bride he said you remember the grain begin to ripen you find before the grain can ripen everything in this talk has to be dead can't you see where you're standing life is in the green again the same word sucked up these come to here up to a head and all the life oh i love this all the life not teachings not doctrines all the life that come through here picked up its people so the life of paul arenas martin columba luta the life you see that magnet coming over to pick up its people oh glory to god what are they picking up for before the rapture oh hallelujah it is forming into a head for the rapture oh blessed be the name of the lord and balaam is praying here may the comfort a revival of the just and a great power come on the church just before it's going it's not too hard to pray that because you promised that we are looking for that for that third pull that we know will do great things among us what he's talking about a great power a great revival a revival of the just oh blessed be the name of the lord so this restitution i'm almost done this restitution the act of restoring to the rightful owner what has been taken away and barbara says if a man lost his inheritance and a squatter come on his land he could not hold it any longer until 50 years after 50 years a jubilee came by and the year of jubilee when the year of jubilee come everything went back to the original the beginning at the beginning all slaves they went back to the original beginning if a man was holding in the field and the trumpet song and he heard it he chewed on his hole and said i'm no more slave i'm going back to my family everything that he had had to be given back oh praise god do you believe that now if some individual lost inheritance that was given to them by god there come a year called the jubilee year isn't that right and in this jubilee every man that lost his inheritance he was a freeborn a true blooded israelite no matter listen no matter who held the possession it had to come back to him he had to go free he didn't have to pay a thing he just had to stop what he was doing and go back to his inheritance listen he has a right to it it was a god-given right because by grace he has inherited it and it would be given to his fathers and hanging out year after year no matter what taking place if he lost it he must go free it meant grace has provided a way for each individual to return to their rightful inheritance and the jubilee was god's manner of expressing grace to his people for restoring or bringing back one to their rightful condition so when you can't make it through go and have a jubilee year just for you brother branham said the power of god was taken back to the original 50th day the year of jubilee when all things went back are you ready for the prophecy are you ready for the prophecy there will come another year of jubilee oh hallelujah listen to this watch and we have added if you notice pentecost has been failing in america for 50 years and about 50 years pentecost began to fall know what's happening the church is receiving the seven seal book of the revelation of jesus christ and not one ten of them can receive it but hear the prophecy but when you see you begin to see the year of jubilee where you don't have to fuss and strain and pull but we are already secured in christ we already have the baptism in the name of jesus all the mysteries have been revealed we are going to bring the seventh season proof that it has been received from the eyes of the people oh glory to god i'm almost done so what god promised that his grace that's why when the heads don't come it will come with shoutings of grace not your works people try to beat people into it let this lead people into it doctrine them into it and it's the grace of god think about it now think about this book have something called redemptive rights not wants rights you have a right to be healed you have a right to be delivered when the lamb took the book he took the book from for you so you have a right to access the power of god you have a right for the baptism of the holy ghost you have a right for re revival that's your right oh glory to god thank you jesus oh praise god i'm almost done music come up please jesus in john 4 told the woman the woman said our fathers worship in this mountain and ye say jerusalem is the place where men want to worship and jesus said on the woman believe me they will come when you shall need in this mountain no yet jerusalem worship the father you worship you know not what we know what we worship for salvation of the jews the hour come and now is when the true worshiper shall worship the father in spirit and the truth for the father seeking such to work worship him god is the spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth oh glory to god so when hallelujah prays the name of the lord when john when john took the when the lamb took the book and john began to rejoice and shout o praise god brahman says he said now watch halal from eight from the eighth to the fourteenth verse he says it was the lamb to be worshipped but in heaven on earth he said on the 8th verse to the 14th verse angels worship him elders worship him living creatures worship him john worship him so much till he say every creature in heaven and earth under the earth worship and blessing god the worship time for the king lamb are we going to have that kind of time you got to get a revelation of your name in the book notice notice notice all this talk about seven seals bahram says when john saw his name john begin to shout and worship have you seen your name because when you see your name you're gonna have to shout and worship may the lord bless you there is jesus listen he has to remain until everything be restored eve
