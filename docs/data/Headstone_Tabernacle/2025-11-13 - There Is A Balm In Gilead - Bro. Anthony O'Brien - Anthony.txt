And we just want to switch now uh by the grace of God um to the reading of the scripture. Amen. And it's a holy thing. We thank God for the opportunity to gather around his word tonight &gt;&gt; and to be touched by him tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, are you happy to be in the house of the Lord? &gt;&gt; Are you happy to be here? &gt;&gt; Next few minutes, we want to just shut in now and just hear what he would say to us. We are totally under his surrender. So, God bless you. As we switch over now, thank you so much. Let's turn to our Bibles over to Jeremiah chapter 8. We'd like to read from verse 22. Um, and just that verse there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. in Jeremiah chapter 8 and verse 22 and it says, "Is there no bomb in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May the God add blessing to the reading of his word. &gt;&gt; Let us bow our hands. Almighty God, we thank you to be in your house tonight, Lord. Lord, it is a privilege to come into thy courts with praise, to come into thy house with thanksgiving. We come tonight, Lord, knowing that we are meeting, Lord, with the awesome, wonderful God, creator of heaven and earth. Lord, how you loved us, Lord. You give us your word to live by and to live in us, Lord Jesus, by your word and by your spirit. Lord, help us tonight. We are in great need of you, Lord. Father, we are a fallen race of people. And Lord, we admit tonight how much we need you, Lord. Your need. We need your guidance in this hour. We need your hand of mercy in this hour. Minister to us by the word tonight. Lord, give us a helping hand, Lord, for we need it so much tonight. Minister to our hearts, to our lives. Help us in some way, Lord. And just for the next few moments, would you just raise us up, Lord? May the spirit of God come and anoint the word and make it live, Lord, and make it uh uh Lord, fortify our hearts as it were, Lord, to uh to to fight the battle, to fight the good fight of faith in these last days that we're living in. Lord, we see what's coming upon the earth. Lord, may you equip your people with the power of your Holy Spirit, with your word living in us, oh God. Grant it, almighty God. Take charge now. Have your way, Lord, Father, in this service. We commit it into your hands, Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may have your seats. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For a title tonight, there is a bomb in Gilead. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is a bomb in Gilead. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's our title tonight. And it was so interesting to what was preached on Sunday uh or what the tape what you heard rather uh living under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; and uh you know I just knew that I just felt it was right tonight to come with this coming behind that message and so that uh we just want to see what God will do for us tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; But there is a bomb in Gilead. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's our title tonight. I think it's pretty obvious at this point that when we look around at the world today, we see that we live in a sick world. The world is full of sick people. &gt;&gt; Everywhere is sickness. Mankind himself is in a sick condition. He's in a need of healing. Healing for his mind, his body, his soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The whole system is corrupt &gt;&gt; to begin with. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Man himself is in a fallen condition. This version of man that we know, that we are familiar with on a day-to-day basis, this man that we interact with, men and women are all in a sick condition. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They are in a fallen condition. Men and women are shriveled and a deformed version of what we were meant to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We might look normal on the outside, but on the inside we are ailing. there's something wrong with us. You might not think that, but that is because we get used to this going to work and coming home and paying the bills and doing what we do. But this is not how it was meant to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When God made man in the beginning, he made a perfect man. And he placed that perfect man in the garden of Eden in a perfect garden, in a perfect atmosphere, and told that man to eat of every fruit of every tree, but that fruit of good and evil toucheth not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And as long as man stayed within the obedience of God, within the will of God, he was in a perfect condition. &gt;&gt; But something happened back there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Something took place back there that caused us to be in this current condition that we're in. The glory that was once upon man's life and crowned creation and man and man in his position and Adam in his in his Eden state, that whole thing was erased. We ended up with a very twisted and broken and and warped idea of reality. &gt;&gt; This is not what it was intended to be. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We were not supposed to be born in sin. We were not supposed to come into the world speaking lies. But that is our reality tonight. We are all sick. &gt;&gt; We are all in need of healing. &gt;&gt; We [snorts] are all in need of deliverance. No matter how polished you might find someone or what kind of a good background or doesn't matter whether someone didn't spit on the sidewalk or whether they had grown up right, done all the commandments, right? There was once such a man who met Jesus. He said, "Lord, I have obeyed all of my commandments to my from my youth up until now." But he knew within himself that he lacked something. And even though he went to the Pharisees, they could give him an answer. Even though he went to the Sadducees, they had no answer to give him. But yet, he knew within himself that he lacked something. He knew within himself that he was not good enough. There was something about him that needed fixing. There was something about him that needed to be addressed. There was something about him that needed healing, but he didn't know nothing about it. He didn't know how to diagnose the problem. He didn't know how to fix his sickness. He didn't know how to cure his disease. He just knew that there was something that he lacked &gt;&gt; and he knew that there was a great teacher in town. And so he decided to come up to Jesus and he said, "What lack I yet?" And the Bible said that at that moment Jesus loved him. The love of God come down for that man, that that rich young ruler. And he said, "Go and take all that you have and sell it to the poor and take up your cross and follow after me." Oh, forget about all that you have. He discerned the spirit that was in that young man. Even though he was dressed right, he was looking right. He was smelling right. He was doing all the right things. He was giving his money to the poor. He was doing this and doing that, but there was something he liked. He had a money spirit upon him. He He worshiped his assets. He worshiped the things that he had and he loved what he had and he enjoyed what he had. And God said, "You can't go on with that in you. You've got to sell all that you have." And this gospel that we have received in this last day requires us tonight to sell all that we have. We can't risk keeping anything that would separate us from our God. Tonight, we got to make our calling and election sure. Tonight, we've got to make sure that we make it in. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We've got to have all the pieces in place. &gt;&gt; We've got to cure, find a cure, find an ailment &gt;&gt; for your sickness. &gt;&gt; Tonight, we come to hear the truth. &gt;&gt; And the truth is that we are in a in a condition tonight &gt;&gt; and that we need help. &gt;&gt; I know I need it. I know that many others need it tonight. &gt;&gt; We didn't come here because we all right. We come here because we have a need. &gt;&gt; And we know that there is a man in here tonight who can touch us at the point of our need. &gt;&gt; We know there's a man in here who can fix problems that we can't fix. We know there's a man in here who can do things that we cannot do. There's a man in here tonight who is able to heal the sick among us. There's a man in here tonight who can raise the dead, who can cast out devils. There is a man in here tonight &gt;&gt; who's got something oh that the world cannot give &gt;&gt; and that is a man we are seeking tonight. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The man called Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He's still as alive today as he ever was tonight. &gt;&gt; As when he had walked the streets of Galilee, &gt;&gt; he's still alive tonight. And &gt;&gt; we believe his spirit is here with us tonight &gt;&gt; to minister to us. &gt;&gt; There is a bomb in Gilead tonight. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. There is a physician there. &gt;&gt; He is a great physician. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh that knows &gt;&gt; everything that's wrong with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He can fix it tonight. He can help you tonight. &gt;&gt; We hardly have enough faith for divine healing. much more faith that we need for the rapture. &gt;&gt; Which means we need a greater greater measure of faith. We need something greater than just divine healing. Divine healing is just a fraction of what we need to change our bodies and to change us from this mortal into immortality. We need more more of that power, more of that glory, more of that healing flow to change this mortal into immortality. Paul said in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye, we'll be changed. What kind of power is about to be released upon the church in the last days? Oh, hallelujah. We've got to have faith for that tonight, friends. And God, send us a prophet. Oh, God, send a message on the earth to give us that faith tonight. SEVEN THUNDERS GIVE FAITH FOR RAPTURE in grace. It is the rapture in grace of the church. Seven thunders have been sent out uh throughout all the earth. Uh oh hallelujah. Seven spirits which are the seven eyes, seven horns which are the seven spirits of God sent all throughout all the earth to FIND YOU TO FIND ME to block YOU OUT OF LAIA. to pull you out of darkness, to pull you out of chaos, to pull you out of confusion, to pull you out OF YOUR SICK CONDITION. There is a bomb in Gileia tonight. AND THAT BOMB IS HERE. THAT PALM IS A manifested reality. Oh, out of a vindicated voice word, an abiding shakina glory. That same Jesus, oh, the spirit that dwelt in him, that is the bomb tonight. And he is here to touch you. He is here to heal you. He is here to deliver you. He is here to restore you. He is here to discern the thoughts and intents of your heart. He's here to go past your flesh. GO PAST THE BONE and the marrow. Go past your mind. Go past your spirit and see your FRACTURED SOUL UH AND see what he can do about it. Only God can fix it. ONLY GOD CAN HEAL IT. Only God can deliver you. Oh, there's things that the DOCTORS CAN'T DO. THERE'S things that man has reached their end. When man has reached the end of their road, THEN GOD IS JUST ABOUT TO GET STARTED. GOD IS JUST ABOUT TO GET FIXED. HALLELUJAH. OH, HALLELUJAH. When the world gives up, when they throw their hands in the air and they have no more answer, they have no more cure. They have no more remedy. They have no more balm. No more bomb to soothe your aches and to soothe your hurts. I COME WITH A MESSAGE TONIGHT TO TELL YOU that there is [screaming] a bomb in Gileian. There is a physician there. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, you might be in a spiritual ICU tonight. Uh but God never gives up on his patience. Oh, you might be in a spiritual condition. You might be torn. Uh, you might be fractured. You might be broken, but there's nothing God can do. There's nothing I've seen him not do. Oh, eyes are upon Jesus tonight. Our eyes are fixed upon him. Oh, [screaming] hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. He's going to do something in this world, something in this message, something in this church, uh something in your life. Uh you're going to pass through one way and come out a next. Uh you're going to go in broken and come out heal. You're going to go in halfway and come out whole. Oh, he touched me. Oh, he touched me and he made me whole. Oh, hallelujah. That's what the bomb of Gilead can do. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Do you believe it tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So, every day we need help. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Every day we in a broken condition &gt;&gt; and is only by his grace that he is fixing us, &gt;&gt; mending us, breaking uh bringing us back uh to a place of restoration. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Only he is able to do that kind of a work. The &gt;&gt; government can't do it. &gt;&gt; Prisons can't fix the crime problem. They just holding crime, criminal spirits for a time and a season until the law has to let them go and they back out on the streets again doing the same things they did when they came back in. &gt;&gt; It didn't fix the problem. They they tried to reform them. They tried to to bring them back into society to make them meaningful contributors of society. But only God could transform a life. Only God could change a soul. Only God could change your walk. Only God could change your talk. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. People come and say, "Oh, I just slipped up. I I just made a mistake. It won't happen again." Yes, it will. Humans are habitual. Humans have patterns of behavior that they can't break. It takes God to change a man. It takes God to change a human heart. It takes divine intervention to break in on you. We couldn't save ourselves. But something along the way. We were born in sin. We were coming up through how we come up. We grow up in different homes and different families and we come through different situations and different things hurt us. Different people hurt us. But it took God to help us in our point of need. It took God to intervene on our behalf. It took God to step in in our path and stop us on our way to hell. He came in the way and stopped us while we were on our way to hell. God stopped us in our tracks and said, "No, no." MERCY SAID, "NO, I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU GO. I'm not going to give up on you. I'm not going to let you slip out of my hands like grains of sand. No, no, no. But I'm here to keep you. I'm here to take you. I'm here to nurture you. I'm here to encourage you. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'm here to show you a better way. Oh, hallelujah. Isn't that right? So in this passage of scripture in Jeremiah 8 that we just read, &gt;&gt; God is using the words of Jeremiah the prophet to speak to the children of Judah. &gt;&gt; And in this scenario, the children of Judah are actually falling away. They are going through a decline, a decline of their own society and a spiritual decline in their kingdom. Their hearts are falling further and further away from the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the condition of the people that are in this context of the scripture where we find God referencing this bomb of Gilead. And whenever God's people begin to get into trouble, God always sends a word of warning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; The prophet of God, William Brandham, said, "God always warns a man before he judges him. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Before God releases his judgment upon the people or unleashes his judgment, he always sends things are not happening the way they should. &gt;&gt; That people aren't as fervent as they should be. &gt;&gt; When people aren't walking the straight and narrow as they should be, brother Abraham said, God always asks the question, why? Why aren't the people healed? Why aren't the people delivered? Why are people so tossed about in this message when God gave a message through a prophet? Why are the people preaching strange things and leaning towards strange doctrines and saying strange things? Why after all these years when we supposed to have clarity in the message? Why are people so tossed about and so driven this way and that? Oh, hallelujah. Why are they not worshiping God? Why are people not praying? Why are people not on fire? Why are people not asking for the Holy Ghost? Why are people not burning? Why are people not praying without ceasing until every one of these virtues are living in them? Uh when God's prophet told them in the stature of a perfect manuh that we ought to pray without ceasing until everyone of these virtues are living in you. That's what we are supposed to be in. That kind of an atmosphere. Oh, for the coming of the Lord. Oh, is close at hand. We know that the time is at hand for the Holy Ghost to pour out upon the church. We know the time is at hand for America to be bombed up. WE KNOW THE TIME IS AT hand for Los Angeles TO SLIDE IN. WE ARE not waiting ON CONDITIONS TO MAKE US DESPERATE. But we see the love of God expressed to us in his word. And that alone ought to make us desperate tonight. To make a conference with this God of the Bible to seek the Lord while he may be found. UH AND CALL UPON HIS NAME uh while he is near. And let the wicked forsake his way. AND LET THE UNRIGHTEOUS MAN FORSAKE HIS THOUGHTS UH AND RETURN unto the Lord. Uh [screaming] oh, that's what we need tonight. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED IN THE MESSAGE. That's what we need in this hour to return unto the Lord. Why? BECAUSE THERE IS A BOMB IN GILEAD. There is a physician there. Oh, hallelujah. Who can touch the brokenhearted? Oh, he can heal you &gt;&gt; and bind up your wounds. Oh, hallelujah. that he is able to do it tonight. &gt;&gt; He can minister to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So God is warning the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that right? And in this passage of scripture, God is actually asking a rhetorical question. It's not like it necessarily needs an answer. It's a question that doesn't really need an answer because the answer is an obvious response. Is there a bomb in Gilead? And the reason the people are not healed physically is because they haven't sought the remedy. It's because they haven't sought a cure. Is the reason because they haven't sought a balm for what ails them. &gt;&gt; But this cry is not about a physical healing. What God is asking about is about a spiritual condition. And God is saying, "I have a spiritual remedy to perform. Spiritual restoration for your spiritual brokenness for your spiritual twistedness, for your spiritual lack. I have an answer. I have a cure. I have a bomb. I have a remedy." Brother Brandham, call it the toxin. Oh, hallelujah. God give a toxin. Oh, an inoculation. Lord, to help you with what ails you, to help you with what you're struggling with, you're struggling to pray, struggling to believe God, struggling to stand on your own two feet. Oh, but God wants to put something in you tonight to cure what ails you, to cure your sickness, to cure what's in your heart, to fix what's wrong in there. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. God is crying out to the people. &gt;&gt; Is there not a bomb in Gilead? &gt;&gt; People put so much confidence in a doctor, &gt;&gt; they will quicker take a tablet. Praise God. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They have so much confidence. If they have a headache, they take a tablet. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; If they have a sore throat, they'll chew some ginger. But God is saying, "I have an answer to your problem. Yet you would not seek me. Yet you would not turn your face towards me and seek me for the answer that you need. I see what's wrong with you. You're running around trying to quench the thirst that I put in your heart for the Holy Ghost. And you're trying to quench that thirst with all kinds of things that I did not give to you. Trying to quench your thirst with TV and trying to quench your thirst with social media. trying to trench your thirst with community and and this and civilization and technology and creature comforts and trying to seek after this. Trying to cure your thirst with money, trying to cure your tur with family. But the only thing that can cure that thirst tonight is the palm of Gilead. Oh, hallelujah. Is the great physician taking his hand in your situation. Oh, and curing &gt;&gt; what ails you. Amen. &gt;&gt; God is essentially saying you have a cure for your ailment, &gt;&gt; but you refuse to use it. &gt;&gt; You have a cure for your sickness, &gt;&gt; for your disease, &gt;&gt; but you refuse to apply it in your situation. And instead of embracing ideas as de as such as idolatry and injustice, which is what uh Judah's condition was, he said, "And you fail to return to the Lord, yet you find no ease for your suffering. The prophet said, "And why are we not in denomination?" He said, "Now we got gifts of healing working." Oh, it's it's going good. Well, brother, he said, "There's other gifts as well. Gifts of healing. That's just one of them." He said, "That's just a little minor thing." He said, "Well, here is a far greater gift right here, which would be the best gift, the gift of the Holy Ghost of wisdom." He said to put the word of God together and to show the church where we are standing &gt;&gt; than just to get somebody healed. &gt;&gt; The prophet is saying that is a greater gift to put the word together is a far greater gift than what we go off on healing and and and and miracles and all of that kinds of stuff. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; The prophet said here, he said, "We all want to be well." Yes. &gt;&gt; He said, "But I'd rather have my soul well than my body well anytime." He said, "Oh my, oh, how many feel that way tonight?" Oh, hallelujah. I might be sick in my body. Oh, I might be sick in my spirit, but I want to know that in my soul is stamped with the glorious, wonderful baptism of the Holy Ghost. I'd rather have my BODY SICK AND KNOW THAT MY SOUL IS sealed with the fire of the living God. I'd rather have a broken leg and know that my soul is passport stamp to glory. Oh, to know that you are sealed with the fire of God IN YOUR SOUL. THAT YOU HAVE RECEIVED THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST AND FIRE. I'd rather see my soul well than my body well at any time. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Oh my. We all want to be well. &gt;&gt; You're just saying it here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Everybody is sick in some way. &gt;&gt; But I'd rather have my soul well. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In other words, if he gave me a choice between my soul and my body, prophet said, I'll choose my soul &gt;&gt; because if this body fails me when my soul is on to glory, I step from this dimension into another dimension that is just as real as this one. Oh, hallelujah. Isn't that right? I step from here into glory and I leave this party behind. Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, leave it behind temporarily. Praise God. Until the resurrection. Amen. &gt;&gt; My but you know where your soul is going. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's a real gift to put the word of God together. Because remember in the beginning when when the devil came into the picture and deceived Eve, she fell by the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He twisted the word, one word, and told her &gt;&gt; she shall not surely die. And then he started to unfold his revelation. He started to unfold his gospel. He started to inject his virus into the situation. And what was a perfect setting in the Garden of Eden, what was a perfect man and and and and a woman, praise God, and everything that was set up the way God had it, it was perfect. There was no sin, no sickness. But here come the devil with an agenda, with a big injection needle of unbelief. That's what it was. It was unbelief as an injection against the word. And Eve received that injection and she gave that injection to her husband. And right there, the devil's virus began to grow inside of them like a darkness. It began to pollute their minds, pollute their atmosphere, pollute their spirits, pollute their bodies until one moment they woke up and realized that they were naked and went and hid themselves and for ashamed. Hallelujah. Isn't that right? Isn't that right? And God come down in the garden saying, "Who told you that you were naked?" Right there. The presence of God that was over them, the anointing that overshadowed them had left them because they fell by the word. So God to restore us, he has to now restore us by the same word that he fell by. Oh, hallelujah. This bride will not be deceived. THIS BRIDE WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO STAND NOT ONLY TO HEAR THAT WORD but to stand with that word and say it is written. It is written. The prophet said she WILL HAVE THUS SAYETH THE LORD OR she will keep still or she will stay right where she is and she will say GIVE ME THAT GIFT. STAY WITH GIVE ME THIS UNTIL THAT COME. I PREFER TO STAY WITH THIS UNTIL THAT COME AND THEN THAT DON'T COME. [screaming] I'M STAYING RIGHT HERE WHERE HE told me to stay. I'm staying in Jerusalem. I'm carrying in Jerusalem until he tell me to go TO GO AND TELL SOMETHING. But I can't go and tell nothing. Until the spirit come down until I'm endued with power from on high. I'M WAITING ON. I'M CALLING ON. I'm praying on. I'M LOOKING FOR THAT SAME HOLY GHOST THAT FELL in the upper room. THIS BRIDE IS LOOKING TO BE GRAMMATIZED. THIS BRIDE IS LOOKING, HALLELUJAH, TO MEET WITH HER, LORD. OH, THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. UH, WE'VE HELD THAT seed long unbelieving. Uh, we've held that seed virgin to the word, VIRGIN TO ANYTHING ELSE. UH, DON'T TELL US NOTHING. IT'S TOO LATE TO INFECT US. IT'S TOO LATE TO INJECT US WITH ANY KIND OF MAN'S IDEA, WITH ANY KIND OF MAN'S UNBELIEF, WITH ANY KIND OF MAN'S TEACHING. IT'S FAR TOO LATE, DEVIL. OH, WE COME TOO FAR TO TURN BACK NOW. OH, I see you crossing Jordan tonight. I SEE YOU POSSESSING YOUR INDIVIDUAL INHERITANCE. I see you waking up to realize that all the promises that Jesus died for is FOR YOU TO POSSESS.

He's going to heal your body. everything you're struggling with, HE KNOWS YOUR STRUGGLES. He knows your cry. He hears your tears. He is here to wipe every tear away. He is the bomb in Gilead. There [screaming] is a bomb in Gilead. There is a physician there. He knows what your deepest hurts are. He knows who hurt you. Uh but he's here to give you power to forgive. Uh power to love. Uh power to repent. Uh power to throw it away. Oh, and let nothing hold you back from entering YOUR SEASON BECAUSE IT IS YOUR SEASON. OH, AND WHEN BROTHERLY KINDNESS COME DOWN UPON YOU, AND YOU RELEASE ALL YOURS, RELEASE ALL YOUR GRUDGES. WHEN YOU FIND YOUR LOST COIN, UH YOU ARE GOING TO SAY TO THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE BODY, COME AND REJOICE WITH ME. UH I HAVE FOUND THE LOST COIN. UH OH, LET US REJOICE TOGETHER FOR THE [screaming] marriage of the lamb has come. and his wife had made herself ready. Oh, when you see by revelation what you are called to do, you're going to make yourself ready. [laughter] You're going to stitch your own wedding garments. You're going to get your headdress. YOU'RE GOING TO GET YOUR BOUQUET BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOUR JESUS IS COMING BACK FOR YOU. You don't know about ANY OTHER BRIDE. BUT THIS BRIDE WILL NOT be deceived. This bride oh has received a new injection. an antidote to the problem. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A virus killer. &gt;&gt; A bomb in &gt;&gt; Gilead. Lord, &gt;&gt; can I go on? &gt;&gt; The literal palm tree that God is actually referencing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I did some research. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is known as the balsam of Mecca. &gt;&gt; It's a literal tree. [snorts] &gt;&gt; It grows as a shrub. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. around the region of Gilead. &gt;&gt; Notice I said a shrub. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's not a great oak tree. It's not a big mahogany. It's not a teak or a cedar. It's a shrub around some little rock somewhere on the dusty side of the road is where you'll find the balm of Gilead. [laughter] A shrub. People with carts and slippers walking past this shrub every day &gt;&gt; in the regions of Gilead. &gt;&gt; They don't pay it no mind because nothing to be to look at. The balm tree, this palm tree, this balm tree that God is actually talking about is an unattractive tree. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; There is no beauty in this tree that you would desire it. It is a palm tree that grows in a strange land in a far distance. It is unattractive. It's a shrub. You would walk past it if you didn't know what it could do for you. [clears throat] You would walk straight past it. Isn't that right? But for those who know what the tree can do, for those who know what that tree is capable of, it is a source of healing. &gt;&gt; It is a source of deliverance. It soothes the aches. Isn't there research even shows that it was used for embarmming the dead and many other medicinal practices? It could be used as a remedy, as a cure for an ailment. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Inside of this shrub was a resin that would come out and they would take it out and refine it and use it in their daily practice of medicine. &gt;&gt; Healing tonight is in the tree. &gt;&gt; Deliverance is in the tree. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? But there's another interesting fact about this tree. Not only is it unattractive, not only is it just a itty bitty thing that most people call might be call a common shrub, isn't that right? But in order to get healing out of it, you have to cut it. You have to cut this tree. &gt;&gt; In order to get access to the resin that is on the inside, and only then will the true powers that are in the tree could be unfolded to you. Oh, hallelujah. I know who you know I'm talking about to Stephen tonight. I'm not just talking about a tree. &gt;&gt; I know you have spiritual thinking caps inside here tonight. You know I'm not just talking about a tree. But Isaiah 53 and verse one said, "Who had believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground. He had no form or comeliness. That when we shall see him there is no beauty that we would desire him. He is despised and rejected of men. A man of sorrows and acquainted with griefs and we hid as it were our faces from him. He was despised and we esteemed him not. Surely he had borne our griefs and carried our sorrows. Yet we did not we did esteem him stricken and smitten of God and afflicted. And verse 5, we know it. He was wounded for our transgressions. He was bruised for our iniquities. Oh, that tree was cut. That tree was bruised. That tree was heuned down. Oh, isn't that right? The chastisement of our peace was upon him. But by his stripes, we were healed. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, that palm lay on a cross ONE CALVARY AFTERNOON. THAT PALM LAY ON A CROSS AND HE CRIED and he screamed for the pain. Uh oh. That he suffered. Oh, hallelujah. He died. Oh, and he was cut. Oh, A SOLDIER PIERCED HIS SIDE. AND BLOOD AND WATER came out. OH, HE DIED an agonizing death. He carried the cross that I was supposed to carry. Oh, he bore the nails UH THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO GO IN MY HANDS. UH BUT he took it. He bore it all. He paid it ALL AND HE DIED. OH, HALLELUJAH. AND THAT BOMB ON THAT CROSS WAS CUT ON THE DAY OF CALVARY. OH, HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. And the prophet said when he died, the spirit that was in that body, God tore that spirit out of him. Oh, hallelujah. That was the Holy Spirit. Oh, THAT VICTORIOUS SPIRIT THAT CONQUERED DEATH, THAT CONQUERED HELL. He was ON HIS WAY TO HELL TO CONQUER. OH, HALLELUJAH. That spirit went out of the body of Christ. OH, AND IT WENT DOWN TO HELL. WHAT DID IT GO DOWN THERE FOR? HE WAS THE BOMB OF GILEAD GOING DOWN TO HELL TO FREE THE SOUL THAT WAS IN HELL. OH, HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. He took the KEYS OF DEATH AND HELL AND THE GRAVE FROM THAT DEVIL. HE SAID, "THAT BELONGS TO ME NOW. THAT'S MINE NOW. I'll have it. Thank you very much." And he kicked down the doors AND HE LET THE prisoners out. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. [screaming] Hallelujah. Oh, glory, glory, glory. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Deliverance is in the tree. &gt;&gt; Healing is in the tree tonight. &gt;&gt; Send the bomb of Gilead. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But you got to have a revelation &gt;&gt; of who he is &gt;&gt; to know that he can do it for you. &gt;&gt; Pharisees call him be elabub. &gt;&gt; The Sadducees called him a heretic. &gt;&gt; They kicked him out of the churches. They didn't want him. Well, the little woman at the well said, "If you are him," praise God. She had a conversation. She said, "I know that the when the Messiah comes, he will do these things and he will have these gifts and these signs and God revealed himself to her." He said, "I that speak to you. I am here." When she saw what was laying in that balm of Gilead, she brought down her water pot. She threw down her reason to be there that afternoon and she ran down to her people and said, "Come see a man who told me all that I have done. Come see a man who touched me and made me whole. Come see a man who did something for me that no other man could do. She had five husbands and the one she was living with were not her own. Oh, hallelujah. She knew men, BUT THIS WAS A DIFFERENT ONE. OH, THIS WAS A GLORIOUS ONE. THIS ONE HAD SOMETHING SHE NEEDED. HE HAD A BOMB. A BOMB THAT SOOTHED HER HURTS. [laughter] A bomb that soothed her pains. her palm that was a remedy for her situation. A remedy oh for what she needed in that hour. [screaming] Oh, he healed her in her soul. Healed her in her spirit. Oh, hallelujah. He discerned her very thoughts. &gt;&gt; There was that bomb at work. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. Amen. My So, we struck that already. He fell by the word. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the spirit of God departed from them and they knew that they were naked. &gt;&gt; They were covered with a glory with an anointing. They did not even know. They were not even aware. &gt;&gt; But something happened when the devil come and injected his virus into the system. And the whole thing was corrupt. And from that time on that virus spread more and more and more. It got to the point when and we find in Noah when God is getting ready to judge the earth that virus that the devil injected back in Eden had grew a corrupt people. &gt;&gt; Mankind was corrupt upon the face of the earth. &gt;&gt; They taught evil continually. &gt;&gt; Every imagination and mischief they had in their heart, &gt;&gt; they manifested it in the flesh. &gt;&gt; So terrible was a condition. It was like a stench coming up to God's nose. He was he was he was he was he was uh uh uh uh turned off by it. He was he was angered by it. Even the Lord repented that he had made man. Isn't that right? And he had vowed to judge them by water. But one man found grace in God's sight. And that man was Noah. Isn't that right? And we found grace in God's sight. This is an again another judgment hour. This is again another judgment day. Judgment is coming to the education system, to the governments, to the justice system, to the polluted system of this world. The virus of the devil has been allowed to spread again in this end and in end end of days. Isn't that right? In this low DC and age, that virus multiply itself again. And we have more corrupt wickedness, more spirits just like it was in the days of Noah. So shall it be in the days of the coming of the son of man. Oh, they eating, they drinking, they married, and they giving in marriage. Oh, that's the condition we find in now. And that evil virus that was injected by the devil. That virus of unbelief, that virus of sin, that virus of filth, that virus of pollution has multiplied itself again into an untoward and evil and crooked generation. Oh, this age was not supposed to have any light. But by faith, God put a slither of light right in that loud DC age. And that light represented you and I. The prophet said in the evening time there shall be light. God's going to find a group of people somewhere who are going to manifest that light. You are going to manifest that light, my brother. Oh, TELL ME MY SISTER. TELL ME my brother. When was THERE A TIME OUTSIDE OF THIS TIME NOW FOR THE MANIFESTATION OF THE SONS OF GOD UPON THE EARTH? OH, we need it, brother. [laughter] We need a healing. We need a release of GOD'S SPIRIT, OF GOD'S BOMB. OH, HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. OH, HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. To heal what has been broken. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To heal our land. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So to cure that sickness, &gt;&gt; he had to come back by the word and the spirit again. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; In order to restore it back. &gt;&gt; When Jesus came, he was the word and he preached the word and he spoke the word over them and prophesied over them. Isn't that right? As a son of man sowing, sewing the word, sewing the seeds. Amen. Is now the kingdom of God is like this. The kingdom of God is like that. Cast this body down and in three days I'll raise it up again. Oh, hallelujah. He confounded them, but he had to speak it because the word went out as a prophecy, knowing that the spirit of God would come behind and manifest that word. Every word that he spoke would be manifested, but it had to be spoken first as a prophecy. Hallelujah. And though they did not understand it, one day he knew that they would remember his words. Oh, hallelujah. He knew that it would come back to them in the time and the season that it had to come back. So he spoke it. The son of man sewing seeds. Some fell on thorny. Some fell on stony ground. Some fell on wayside. But some fell on good ground. Oh, I believe with all my heart. GOD FOUND GOOD GROUND TONIGHT. RIGHT HERE IN HEADSTONE TABERNACLE, RIGHT HERE IN SANGRY GRANDE, RIGHT HERE IN TRINIDAD, GOD FOUND GOOD GROUND uh to sew his seed in. Uh oh, that they with a good and honest heartth have received the word OF GOD. UH THEY KNOW THEY CAN'T FIX THEMSELVES. UH THEY KNOW THEY CAN'T DO NOTHING for themselves. Uh so with a good and honest heartth with an open and willing spirit uh you have received the word UH BECAUSE GOD PUT SOMETHING INSIDE OF YOU UH TO RECEIVE THAT WORD. AND WHEN THAT WORD CAME into you oh hallel you became a virgin uh to the word of God. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. YOU CANNOT RECEIVE ANY OTHER MAN'S seed tonight, but the seed of the word of God. Uh, oh, hallelujah. What he said, UH, WHAT HE PROMISED, GOD PROMISED A REVIVAL, and we're HERE TO RECEIVE IT TONIGHT. GOD PROMISED TO HEAL OUR BODIES, AND WE'RE HERE TO RECEIVE IT TONIGHT. GOD PROMISED THE HOLY GHOST. GOD PROMISED THE POOR DYNAMICS TO OUR MECHANICS. GOD PROMISED THAT THE SEVEN THUNDERS THAT ARE NOT EVEN WRITTEN UH WILL BE MADE MANIFEST IN SUCH A WAY UH THAT PEOPLE WILL COME FLYING IN UH TO TRINIDAD TO FIND OUT WHAT IS THIS? WHAT MEANTH THIS? WHAT TAKEN PLACE? THAT THE SEVEN THUNDERS THAT ARE NOT EVEN WRITTEN ARE BEING MADE MANIFEST. SOMEWHERE SOMEHOW GOD FOUND A PEOPLE SOMEWHERE SOMEHOW ANOTHER SHOCK OF HERE IS GROWING OUT. SOMEWHERE ON THE EARTH, GOD ARE THE PEOPLE, ANOTHER PEOPLE IN THE LAND who under their messenger WILL BE THE FINAL VOICE TO THE FINAL AGE. OH, AND THEY WILL DEFEAT THE DEVIL UPON ANY GROUND HE COMES UPON. OH, ANYWHERE, [screaming] ANYTIME, UNDER ANY CONDITION, GOD IS GOING TO EQUIP HIS PEOPLE WITH THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST AND FIRE. AND HE WILL SET THEM OUT AS ANOTHER EPHESIANS UPON THE EARTH HEALING THE SICK, RAISING THE DEAD, CASTING OUT DEVILS. THAT POWER IS ABOUT TO BE RELEASED. I BELIEVE IT IN THE NAME OF JESUS. I SPEAK IT IN THE NAME OF JESUS. LET THE DEVIL HEAR US TONIGHT. WE STILL BELIEVE THAT GOD WILL POUR OUT THE HOLY GHOST. YOU LOVE THE BATTLE, SATAN. WE STILL BELIEVE UH WITH ALL OUR HEARTS AND WE'RE PRAYING WITHOUT CEASING. WE'RE GOING TO PRAY UNTIL IT HAPPEN. WE'RE GOING TO BELIEVE UNTIL IT HAPPEN. WE'RE GOING TO SING UNTIL IT HAPPEN. WE'RE GOING TO TAR UNTIL IT HAPPEN. WE'RE GOING TO wait until our change comes. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [applause] Oh my. Glory. Just a few more things &gt;&gt; that I want to cover here and then we close out. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, do you love it tonight? Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh wow. I feel good tonight. Thank you so much. Amen. For your worship. Praise God. Hallelujah. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Prophet said here &gt;&gt; on exposition of seven church ages, the sadishian church age. &gt;&gt; He says in divine service the words of men are usually heard more than the word of God. Each one chatters as he pleases [laughter] or kills time by learned dispositions and disproving the views of others. A melting pot of of nonsense. This man versus that man. This minister versus that minister. This church versus that church. The views of men [laughter] usually heard more than the word of God. The prophet said, "Here's your remedy tonight." Are you [laughter] ready? He said of the new birth and how a man must be changed into THE LIKENESS OF CHRIST TO BECOME A PARTAKER OF THE DIVINE NATURE. ACCORDING TO JUST SECOND Peter 1:4, he said, "Scarcely anything is said." Oh, hallelujah. That's what we need tonight. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. A divine nature. We need to come into that nature. You are promised friends to come into a nature that's going to change the way you walk, change the WAY YOU TALK, CHANGE THE WAY YOU APPROACH LIFE, CHANGE THE WAY YOU APPROACH SITUATIONS, CHANGE THE WAY YOU APPROACH CIRCUMSTANCES. WHEN YOU HAVE THIS NATURE, THE DEVIL IS UNDEFEATED. Uh is is defeated in your life. You become undefeated. Praise God. Hallelujah. You stand anywhere, anytime. PRAISE GOD. HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT WHAT IT TAKES TO TAKE YOU THROUGH the trial. even to the rapture. Praise God. This these seven things living in you. Praise God. They make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of God. Oh, and unto a perfect man, unto a measure of stature of THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST. When these seven things come in you, oh, THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING FOR ALL THESE YEARS TO GET THESE SEVEN THINGS IN US TO MEET GOD'S REQUIREMENTS. AND THE DEVIL HAS LOOSED HIS AGENTS UPON THE EARTH. INJECTING PEOPLE WITH UNBELIEF, INJECTING PEOPLE WITH VIRUSES SO THAT THEY would not believe. Oh, but we did not believe the DEVIL'S LIE. WE DIDN'T BELIEVE IT UP THERE. [screaming] AND WE WILL NOT BELIEVE IT DOWN HERE. WE KICKED THE DEVIL OUT UP THERE AND WE'RE GOING TO KICK HIM OUT DOWN HERE. AND [snorts] AS A WITNESS, MICHAEL THE ARCHANGEL IS COMING DOWN BECAUSE HE WAS THERE WITH YOU WHEN YOU FOUGHT THE BATTLE AGAINST SATAN AND YOUR ANGEL REPRESENTED YOU. WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN NOW IN THIS TIME THAT WE LIVING IN? THAT ANGEL COME BACK DOWN AGAIN TO STAND WITH THE SON OF GOD, TO STAND WITH THE DAUGHTERS OF GOD AND TO FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT OF FAITH. WE ARE GOING TO PRESS BACK THE ENEMY, PRESS BACK LUCIFER, PRESS BACK SICKNESS, PRESS BACK DISEASE. OH, HALLELUJAH. THAT MIGHTY CHURCH IS GOING TO STAND THERE AND ALL HER GLORY. OH, THEN THE PHILISTINES WOULD GO TO BACKING UP. THEN THE SHORT WOULD GO OFF. THEN THE HAIR WILL GO MALACHI 4. LIVE IN ME is my prayer. OH, THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO SEE. THAT'S WHAT I'M PRAYING FOR. IF IT'S THE LAST SECOND BEFORE THE RAPTURE, I WANT THE HOLY GHOST. IF IT'S THE LAST SECOND BEFORE THE RAPTURE, I WANT TO BE FILLED. I WANT TO BE SEALED WITH A GLORIOUS, wonderful &gt;&gt; balm of Gilead. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. [screaming] &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Oh my my my my. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's let's try to finish [laughter] this out. Amen. Obama Gillia the prophet said there's people today it's just like this he said a man is dying on the doorsteps of a doctor's office when the doctor in the building has the cure for his disease but he refuses to take it if the man has a disease and the doctor has a cure for it then the man may lay on the doctor's doorstep but if he refused to take the medicine he will die on the doorstep you cannot blame the doctor. The doctor would have given him the medicine to cure him if he would only come and take it. But it isn't the doctor's fault. He's got the remedy, BUT THE MAN is too stubborn to take it. The prophet said, "Whose fault is it?" He said, "And so it is today that many people die in the front of the church on the steps in the pews. They die in their sins because they refuse to accept God's bomb that is in Gilead. They die in their sins BECAUSE THEY REFUSE IT. NOT BECAUSE THERE isn't any there, but they just refuse to take it. Oh, he said, "Then what will they take?" He said, "They'll have to take something false instead." Oh, there's your mark of THE BEAST. THEY REJECT THE HOLY SPIRIT, THEN THEY'LL HAVE TO TAKE SOMETHING FALSE INSTEAD. But we are here tonight to take God's medicine. WE ARE HERE TONIGHT TO TAKE GOD'S WORD AND TO RECEIVE the spirit OF GOD THAT MAKES that word alive. Oh, that makes that word live in you tonight. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, he said night after night inspired prophets of God speaking who takes a word fearlessly and lays it out. He said he must be born again. He said, "But men and women sit in the pews and die and sink into utter despair and annihilate from God because they because there's not grace and salvation." Not because there's not grace and salvation, but because they refuse to receive it. Oh, what a condition. Oh, don't fall into that condition, friends. Oh, hallelujah. No, no. We come too far to fall into such a condition. Amen. There is a bomb in Gilead tonight. There is a physician there. A great position now is here. Oh, the gentle loving Jesus. Oh, hallelujah. Sweeter. Oh, any note on Sarah's song. [screaming] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Sweetest name on mortal tongue is Jesus. Precious Jesus. Our heart beats for him. Uh oh. We long for him. Uh we long for his bomb to come and touch our hearts again. Uh oh. People need the Lord. Uh people need God. People need a savior. People need a redeemer. People need a healing. PEOPLE NEED DELIVERANCE. PEOPLE NEED a resurrection. UH THEY DYING AND THEY DON'T KNOW IT. THEY SICK AND THEY DON'T KNOW IT. THEY GOING TO [laughter] HELL AND THEY DON'T KNOW IT. WHAT they need is THE BOMB OF GILEAD TO INTERVENE TONIGHT. Uh oh. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh my. Oh, I'm getting ready to close. Praise God. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "Sometimes we join church a lot of pretty things and so forth. Maybe we we try to pretty ourselves to go to church, get some something another to wear to church." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "Is that all church means to you?" He said, "Then I'm persuaded you need a new birth." That's exactly right. That grain of corn will never produce any new life until the own grain rots away. He said, "And a person at the altar can't get down there and kneel down and then just get up and say, I've got a new birth." No, no, no. You have to stay there until all of your thoughts, your [snorts] own self, and all your worldly things has rotted away from you, has died and rotten and gone from you. And then a new birth takes place. He said, "Oh, you might slobber and jabber and slobber like a horse." Amen. Hallelujah. But you come up from there in a new condition with a new birth and something in you that is alive and makes you something different than what you was. Oh, that's the effect of the bomb of Gilead. It makes you something different than what you was. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Isn't that right? Oh my, my my my. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Let me finish out here. Praise God.

He says, "Now all those lambs were a shadow or stepping stone pointing to a time when God would bring the real toxin down." Oh, so they had sacrifice in the wilderness. They offered up bullocks and goats and so forth. Isn't that right? Praise God. But they was waiting for a perfect one to come. God was promised to release a real toxin to deal with the sin issue to deal with the unbelief issue to deal with the devil's injection. Isn't that right? He says, "So God never chose a guinea pig. Neither did he choose anything else. He tried the serum out on his own son, a virgin-born son of God, come down to the earth, and God gave him the toxin. Gave him the toxin t test. Isn't that right? Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. And it happened on the bank of Jordan when he was 30 years old. John per record after he baptized him and said, "I saw the spirit of God descending like a dove and it went upon him and he was filled with God's toxin and he proved it that he could stand THE TEST. HE WALKED OUT THERE BEFORE SICKNESS AND sickness vanished from him. He walked before the cripples and the cripples walked. And when he was put to the test, they spit on him. They whipped [snorts] him at the back. They riled him up. Try to get his temper up. And he said, "I could speak to my father and he would send legions of angels." [snorts] What was the matter? WHY DIDN'T HE DO IT? THE PROPHET SAID THE toxin was holding. Oh, he was put to the test AND THERE THE TOXIN WENT TO CALVARY. HALLELUJAH. Mockery and spit on his face. His face was bleeding and so forth. He could have spoke the word and it was changed the whole thing. But the toxin held. The prophet said he died and he had the sins of the world and every sin that was ever in the world was placed on him under that burden of sin with all of the sin laid upon him. He died. Oh hallelujah. That toxin work in temptations. That toxin work IN EVERY TRIAL. THAT TOXIN WORK IN DEATH. THAT TOXIN WORK IN BURIAL AND THE TOXIN WORKED IN RESURRECTION. Oh the prophet SAID THERE IS A BOMB IN GILEAD. And then Jesus said he TOLD HIS DISCIPLES I WANT YOU TO BE INOCULATED WITH IT. SO I AM SENDING YOU FORTH WITH A KIT TO GO OUT INTO ALL THE WORLD AND INOCULATE EVERYONE THAT WOULD BELIEVE. OH, SEVEN TENDERS TO INOCULATE YOU. OH, UNTO A GLORIOUS RAPTURE, UNTO A GLORIOUS WEDDING SUPPER. GOD'S GOING TO INOCULATE THIS BRIDE FROM THE VIRUS OF THE DEVIL. OH, and the prophet said 120 climbed into an upper room and closed THE DOORS AND THEY BARED the windows and they stayed there for 10 days waiting for it to happen. And while they were there in one place and in one accord, ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE CAME A SOUND FROM HEAVEN like a rushing MIGHTY WIND. IT WAS GOD'S BOMB COMING DOWN. AND WHEN IT STRUCK THE ROOM, CLOVE AND TONGUES OF FIRE SET UPON THEM. OH, AND OUT INTO THE STREETS THEY WENT. THE TOXIN HAD THE RESULTS. OH, THEY SHOWED THAT THEY HAD BEEN INOCULATED. HALLELUJAH. THEY SHOW THAT SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED TO THEM. UH ALL THE FEAR AND EVERYTHING VANISHED AWAY AS SOON AS THEY GOT THE INJECTION OF GOD'S TOXIN OF THE HOLY GHOST THAT WAS POURED OUT UPON THEM. OH, IT MADE THEM STAMMER. IT MADE THEM RECEIVE NEW LIFE. GOD PUT HIS LIFE INTO 120. OH, GOD IS GOING TO DO THE SAME FOR YOU TONIGHT. GOD HAS A TOXIN TONIGHT. IT'S THE SAME ONE THAT MARY RECEIVED.

It keeps the the the the the pest away. OH, IT'S NOT A HYBRID PLANT. IT'S an original. It's an original seed. UH AND THE SPOKEN WORD IS THE ORIGINAL SEED.
