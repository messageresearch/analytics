[53:21] the brothers hated him for that coat
[53:24] amen but God gave him a dream upon that
[53:26] coat

[53:31] Hallelujah of all the sheeps bowing to
[53:33] him hallelujah oh blessed be the name of
[53:36] a living God Amen and Joseph had to tell
[53:39] the dream he got more in trouble
[53:42] Hallelujah but here was the dream the
[53:45] dream had to be fulfilled but Joseph
[53:48] didn't know it was going to take a long
[53:49] process Joseph didn't know they would
[53:51] bind him in a well but that was part of
[53:54] that dream to be Vindicated Hallelujah
[53:56] they brought him out of the well sold
[53:58] him into slavery but that was part of
[54:00] the dream to be Vindicated Hallelujah
[54:03] Joseph was looking at the word he said I
[54:05] saw that Vision I saw that dream that's
[54:08] coming for the manifestation that's
[54:09] coming for the Vindication the world is
[54:12] not going to stop me slavery is not
[54:14] going to stop me the presence of pharaoh
[54:16] will not stop me because I am looking at
[54:18] the manifestation I'm looking at a
[54:21] Vindication oh hallelujah oh because
[54:24] Pharaoh was going to get a dream and
[54:25] there was a Joseph to interpret the
[54:27] dream Hallelujah because there was
[54:30] coming the eighth year or maybe the
[54:32] Eighth Day where there was been hunger
[54:35] there was going to be hunger all over
[54:36] the world but on the Eighth Day in the
[54:39] eighth year oh there was going to be
[54:41] plenty because Joseph had a vision
[54:44] Joseph had a dream but it was a process
[54:47] to bring the dream to a manifestation so
[54:49] there had to be Egypt there had to be a
[54:51] time of famine but there had to be a
[54:53] Joseph in Egypt in slavery but God was
[54:57] bringing the process of that dream to a
[54:59] Vindication oh there might be a time of
[55:01] reproach a time of Hunger but we are
[55:04] here in the time of the Vindication in
[55:06] the time of the manifestation another
[55:09] holy time a holy convocation maybe on
[55:12] the eth day there is plenty while there
[55:15] is hunger out there this is Joseph this
[55:18] is Joseph but he had a new name he had a
[55:21] new name but there was yet one part to
[55:23] be fulfilled there was one part to be
[55:25] fulfilled had to bow to Joseph they had
[55:28] to bow to Joseph they had to bow to
[55:30] Joseph because Joseph had to get into
[55:32] position oh on the E year they had to
[55:35] come all the way to bow to that Joseph
[55:39] and I say to you don't be weary don't be
[55:42] tired be the reproach this is the time

[1:17:09] heart has been blessed uh I I have no
[1:17:12] words to you know you find try to look
[1:17:16] for uh the you know words in the
[1:17:19] dictionary to properly explain what is
[1:17:23] going on with the you know
[1:17:25] this is this is unspeakable you can't
[1:17:28] speak joy unspeakable and full of glory
[1:17:31] amen so praise this wonderful name I'm
[1:17:35] so thankful amen I want to thank uh and

[1:17:45] back to Trinidad is always a blessing
[1:17:47] for me to come amen and to share my
[1:17:51] testimony and my testimony I love this
[1:17:54] message with all my heart that's my
[1:17:56] testimony I gave my heart to the Lord
[1:17:59] when I was 14 years
[1:18:01] old amen I've been around the block a
[1:18:03] little B uh a few
[1:18:05] times amen and uh so this is my life I
[1:18:10] have nothing else amen you know if I
[1:18:13] would have found something better I
[1:18:15] would have gone with it right amen so
[1:18:18] I'm 57 now so you can imagine you do the
[1:18:21] calculation how long I've been around so
[1:18:23] therefore um I I have seen many things
[1:18:29] and one thing that I do appreciate is
[1:18:32] the sincerity of real godall
[1:18:37] men their objective their motive is to
[1:18:41] is to do their best to get people back
[1:18:43] to the
[1:18:45] word back to the word of
[1:18:48] God we have received a message in this
[1:18:52] end time amen and we now have brother
[1:18:56] Braham said the perfect interpretation
[1:18:59] of the word with Divine
[1:19:01] Vindication you see there's a lot of
[1:19:03] people say that they have the word but
[1:19:05] you see that's all good but God is going
[1:19:10] to manifest and
[1:19:13] prove because the head part can only
[1:19:16] rest on a True
[1:19:18] Body and that body has got to be the
[1:19:21] word amen amen and the head identifies a
[1:19:25] body as I have often said so you know
[1:19:29] there are many claims it's okay fine
[1:19:31] that's not a problem I I don't argue
[1:19:34] with no man brother Braham said I I
[1:19:36] argue with no man amen you preach the
[1:19:38] word and you just uh go on and love
[1:19:41] everybody because you see the trial that
[1:19:45] we many times face today
[1:19:49] from uh you know if you don't know a
[1:19:52] person for example if they run you down
[1:19:56] it's not a problem you don't know
[1:19:59] them but it's those that really are your
[1:20:03] friends and your Associates and things
[1:20:06] and then they that's the challenge you
[1:20:08] know right that's the challenge a a a
[1:20:12] and we have got to be mature enough and
[1:20:15] understand that these are trials to mold
[1:20:18] us and make
[1:20:20] [Applause]
[1:20:21] us to be more like Jesus
[1:20:26] Christ amen is written in the scripture
[1:20:28] where did you get these stripes in the
[1:20:30] house of my enemies no
[1:20:33] friends amen so praise the Lord
[1:20:36] hallelujah I'm so thankful for friends
[1:20:40] should I say that have helped me uh grow
[1:20:44] in Jesus
[1:20:46] Christ amen hallelujah every trial every
[1:20:52] tribulation listen to me right here
[1:20:55] right now nothing happens without God
[1:20:59] permitting it to
[1:21:01] [Music]
[1:21:03] happen and if God has permitted it
[1:21:06] praise God there must be a purpose for
[1:21:09] it that the purpose might be fulfilled
[1:21:13] and accomplished glory be to God you
[1:21:17] want to have faith and virtue and
[1:21:19] knowledge and Temperance God cannot
[1:21:22] listen character is not a gift it is a
[1:21:26] victory you want virtue knowledge
[1:21:29] Temperance patience God has special
[1:21:31] design trials for you Hallelujah to give
[1:21:35] you the character of Jesus Christ praise
[1:21:39] God

[1:22:02] realize that there's a lot of work that
[1:22:05] goes on behind the scenes and uh I want

[1:24:42] done amen tell me what righteousness
[1:24:45] have you done to earn what you have here
[1:24:47] today absolutely nothing and I'm so
[1:24:50] thankful that uh you know we have not
[1:24:53] chosen God he has chosen
[1:24:56] us amen and we're not holding on to God
[1:24:59] he's holding on to us we don't have the
[1:25:02] strength to hold on to God glory be to
[1:25:05] God and I'm so thankful and I that's why
[1:25:07] the scripture says all that the father
[1:25:09] has given me shall come and I will not
[1:25:12] lose not one praise God so brother Isaac
[1:25:17] also to uh last night possessing your

[1:25:45] something that was promised to him as an
[1:25:49] individual he didn't represent the tribe
[1:25:53] is an individual Fair amen and today if

[1:26:34] evil
[1:26:35] report amen that's what the brother
[1:26:38] Brown says we have got to bring a good
[1:26:41] uh true
[1:26:44] report because Joshua and Caleb came
[1:26:46] back with the evidence the others did
[1:26:49] not they could only explain what they
[1:26:53] saw
[1:26:54] and what they felt and what you know but
[1:26:58] Vision Hallelujah

[1:31:11] read if we can I have two portions of
[1:31:15] scripture uh St John
[1:31:18] 14 I'll be reading the first four verses
[1:31:24] and also Revelations chap 21 and I think
[1:31:28] it's it fits it's very fitting for the
[1:31:33] theme that
[1:31:35] has uh been announced and we want to
[1:31:39] just stay on that
[1:31:41] line and that
[1:31:44] theme brother Jano had
[1:31:49] uh mentioned something in his testimony
[1:31:52] there's got to be a Place
[1:31:55] prepared for the word to be made
[1:31:58] manifest and we know that is a body a
[1:32:02] body has thou prepared me so there is a
[1:32:06] preparation you see so let us let us
[1:32:10] start here verse
[1:32:12] one let not your heart be troubled ye
[1:32:16] believe in God believe also in me
[1:32:20] hey in my father's house are many
[1:32:23] mansions
[1:32:24] if it were not so I would have told you
[1:32:28] now listen I go to prepare a place for
[1:32:34] you you see Jesus when he was walking
[1:32:38] with
[1:32:39] man could
[1:32:41] not make this
[1:32:44] preparation because the Holy Spirit had
[1:32:46] not been
[1:32:47] released but he had to go but on the day
[1:32:51] of Pentecost on the Holy Ghost and the
[1:32:54] Holy Ghost poured out he begin his
[1:32:56] preparation he began his preparation and
[1:32:58] we have to understand his house amen
[1:33:01] this preparation we're talking about is
[1:33:03] your
[1:33:04] Tabernacle uh I go to prepare a place
[1:33:07] for you and if I go oh I love this and
[1:33:10] prepare a place for you I will come

[1:33:25] way ye know next scripture verse found
[1:33:29] in Revelations chap
[1:33:31] 21 and I trust that uh I can kind of
[1:33:36] bring this across in a way that
[1:33:39] uh it had come to
[1:33:43] me because we have to understand
[1:33:48] that the Eighth
[1:33:51] Day is coming
[1:33:56] but let us look at how is written in
[1:34:01] Revelations chapter 21 and verse

[1:34:08] the
[1:34:09] earth the earth as you know it

[1:34:55] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[1:34:59] Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for

[1:35:05] out of Heaven saying behold the temple
[1:35:08] of God is with man and he will dwell

[1:51:11] God people don't know what the anointing
[1:51:15] is I'm going to make it clear to you
[1:51:18] because I have scriptures and I have
[1:51:20] quotes and things amen people people
[1:51:23] fail to know what the anointing really
[1:51:26] is hallelujah brother Braham said that
[1:51:29] the greatest anointing that struck the
[1:51:32] Earth
[1:51:34] come was when Jesus walked into the
[1:51:39] temple he P picked up the Scrolls of
[1:51:44] Isaiah and he read the portion that
[1:51:47] pertained to him
[1:51:53] nobody was shouting nobody
[1:51:55] was you see people get confused with
[1:51:59] noise and think they have all that there
[1:52:02] is to
[1:52:04] have but the anointing and now listen
[1:52:07] please I'm not against shouting and
[1:52:09] glorifying God I I'm just making a point
[1:52:13] listen I want you to understand you can
[1:52:15] shout but at the end of the day you've
[1:52:17] got to understand that the anointing
[1:52:19] comes to make the word made flesh
[1:52:23] [Applause]
[1:52:25] hallelujah
[1:52:27] hallelujah
[1:52:29] hallelujah glory be to God and he said

[1:52:35] he has anointed me Hallelujah the preach
[1:52:39] to the poor and so forth amen glory be
[1:52:42] to God and he put the scroll away and
[1:52:45] brother brandham said oh you take these
[1:52:47] Pentecostals they would just love and
[1:52:49] run around that Temple and shout and
[1:52:51] speak in tongues and everything else but
[1:52:53] that was the greatest anointing the
[1:52:55] anointing comes upon the word to make it
[1:52:58] live it is the the Dynamics to our
[1:53:01] mechanics Hallelujah and brother Bram
[1:53:04] says you wait till the anointing really
[1:53:06] strike this church amen I doubt very
[1:53:10] much if it's just going to make us shout
[1:53:12] and glorify God although that is the
[1:53:14] after effects amen but we will rejoice
[1:53:18] because the word is becoming flesh
[1:53:24] hallelujah
[1:53:25] hallelujah
[1:53:27] amen
[1:53:29] glory
[1:53:30] amen listen so therefore without the
[1:53:33] statue of perfect man amen you will
[1:53:36] never make it you will never be able to
[1:53:39] uh be tied into that Eternal Church age
[1:53:42] amen and I believe the Thunders with all
[1:53:44] my heart you know why because brother
[1:53:46] brandom said it amen and I have to
[1:53:49] believe what he said amen but you see
[1:53:52] here and brother brandom says in the
[1:53:54] Seal of God he lived here once with
[1:53:58] us on Earth in the form of a man God
[1:54:02] lived in his son Christ
[1:54:06] Jesus
[1:54:08] as the God
[1:54:11] man and he returned into Glory leaving
[1:54:15] this world a little while and the world
[1:54:17] seeth me no more yet ye shall see me for
[1:54:20] I will be with you even in you to the
[1:54:21] end of the world
[1:54:23] now listen the person of the Holy
[1:54:26] Spirit returning in the form is that
[1:54:30] Jesus said I come from God and I go back
[1:54:33] to God listen he said he came out of
[1:54:39] Eternity
[1:54:40] am eternity is number
[1:54:43] eight amen he wasn't in
[1:54:46] time God was
[1:54:49] eternal and he's still Eternal amen but
[1:54:52] he had to drop into this
[1:54:54] Kink that the devil caused and through
[1:54:58] sin but here is what's so beautiful
[1:55:01] about this amen you can be seated a
[1:55:04] moment amen I come from God and I go
[1:55:06] back to God he came from eternity and
[1:55:09] stepped down into time amen went out
[1:55:13] back uh and went uh went out of time
[1:55:16] back into
[1:55:18] eternity I love that so now when Adam
[1:55:25] sinned you
[1:55:27] see in the beginning God said the
[1:55:32] day that you eat thereof you shall
[1:55:37] die the
[1:55:39] day and to God a day is a thousand
[1:55:43] years we all know that and we read in
[1:55:46] the Bible that nobody lived a thousand
[1:55:50] years Methuselah came close by he
[1:55:53] didn't but no God doesn't forget his
[1:55:56] promises you know he takes care of his
[1:55:59] promises don't worry about it hallelujah
[1:56:01] amen because he created man here to be
[1:56:04] Eternal in the beginning there was
[1:56:07] eternal Hallelujah Adam was
[1:56:10] eternal Eve was eternal they come from
[1:56:14] God and they were supposed to go back to
[1:56:16] God but Eve let down the bars unbelief
[1:56:20] came in and they caus a kink
[1:56:22] amen and that is what broke Fellowship
[1:56:25] between amen the early Adam and Eve and
[1:56:29] God but God had to fix that you know
[1:56:32] because he himself had to drop down into
[1:56:35] this little
[1:56:37] Loop Hallelujah to make sure that uh he
[1:56:42] pushes it back up back into
[1:56:44] [Applause]
[1:56:46] eternity and the reason for the
[1:56:49] Thousand-Year reign
[1:56:52] listen to me the reason for the
[1:56:55] Thousand-Year Reign is to prove that God
[1:56:59] had paid the price of
[1:57:03] restoration somebody's going to live a
[1:57:06] thousand years glory be to God
[1:57:09] Hallelujah at that wedding supper praise
[1:57:12] God oh Satan will be bound A Thousand
[1:57:16] Years we'll have no tempter then oh God
[1:57:20] takes care of his word
[1:57:23] oh
[1:57:25] Hallelujah glory be to God we would be
[1:57:28] rejoicing and of course the Great
[1:57:30] Tribulation is is taking place for three
[1:57:32] and a half years and Satan is bound and
[1:57:35] so forth but in the at the same time God
[1:57:38] oh is preparing a place for you and I
[1:57:41] listen but it won't be the heavens that
[1:57:43] we know today it won't be the Earth that
[1:57:45] we know today the Earth that we know
[1:57:48] today has water has seeds has trouble
[1:57:51] and so forth but Jesus uh but John was
[1:57:54] speaking about a new Earth for the old
[1:57:56] things has passed away glory be to God
[1:58:00] you talk about oh
[1:58:03] hallelujah amen amen see you can be
[1:58:08] seated if you can amen and we live
[1:58:11] through all these types here but when
[1:58:13] you hit the eighth number eight see you
[1:58:18] go back to Eternity you don't come from
[1:58:21] laws and rituals and orders as the
[1:58:23] brother uh already wrote amen or rather
[1:58:26] uh read you come by
[1:58:30] predestination
[1:58:32] amen I'm going to say I'm going to stop
[1:58:35] and say something here
[1:58:41] please without
[1:58:44] predestination and God is Not unfair you
[1:58:48] know he told Jeremiah before
[1:58:53] uh when you were in your mother's womb I
[1:58:56] knew
[1:58:57] you and I had ordained you to be a
[1:59:00] prophet to the
[1:59:02] [Music]
[1:59:04] Nations
[1:59:06] Hallelujah Jacob and Esa before they
[1:59:10] breathed a single breath hallah Jacob
[1:59:14] have I loved Esau have I hated
[1:59:18] hallelujah how can he do that because he
[1:59:22] knows his
[1:59:24] own God is Not
[1:59:26] unfair and I'm going to tell you the
[1:59:29] greatest Revelation that any man any
[1:59:31] Christian can have today is there true
[1:59:34] revelation of
[1:59:36] predestination Hallelujah to know that
[1:59:38] you come from God and you're going back
[1:59:40] to God again glory be to God Amen so
[1:59:45] let's take a story I've said this many
[1:59:48] times before the devil want to he's the
[1:59:50] accuser you know he's the accuser
[1:59:53] there's nobody else named accuser out
[1:59:56] outside of the devil he likes to accuse
[1:59:57] and there is no Redemption and
[2:00:00] accusation to accuse you he just wants
[2:00:02] to he's judge jury uh and he wants to
[2:00:05] just make you look bad he'll put you in
[2:00:08] the front paper and so forth that's an
[2:00:10] accuser you see but Jesus told the woman
[2:00:14] neither do I accuse
[2:00:17] you because his love was uh was a love
[2:00:23] of
[2:00:24] forgiveness and in her heart was a
[2:00:29] seed she was Ill Fame she was caught in
[2:00:34] adultery this is why I said don't we
[2:00:37] don't have the ability to
[2:00:42] judge any man anybody we don't have the
[2:00:45] ability to judge any person right the
[2:00:49] only reason God's judgment are true and
[2:00:53] they are pure and they are final is
[2:00:57] because he knows all
[2:01:01] things you present your case to a jury
[2:01:04] and all of you trying to get is some
[2:01:07] evidence evidence something um DNA
[2:01:11] anything amen and sometimes you get a
[2:01:13] bunch of it and sometimes you get a
[2:01:15] little bit of it but then you go to
[2:01:17] court amen and it's the proof amen that
[2:01:20] you present whether that case uh is is
[2:01:24] ruled for you or against you that's
[2:01:27] right amen but
[2:01:29] [Applause]
[2:01:33] [Music]
[2:01:37] God God knows all things amen but God
[2:01:41] knows all things and that's how he could
[2:01:43] judge and this is why he before uh Jacob
[2:01:48] and Esau lived one day he knew
[2:01:52] he knew that hallelujah oh that uh amen
[2:01:57] Jacob would have respect unto the birth
[2:02:00] right amen oh and everything that Jas
[2:02:05] that's the only thing he wanted amen was
[2:02:08] that Birthright but Esau he made light
[2:02:12] of it let us never make light of our
[2:02:16] Birthright uh this is the Holy Ghost it
[2:02:19] is your Birthright never make light of
[2:02:22] adoption never make light of perfection
[2:02:25] never make light this is your
[2:02:27] inheritance glory be to God hallelujah
[2:02:32] Glory oh praise be to
[2:02:36] God but when you're
[2:02:39] predestinated now the AC the accuser
[2:02:42] let's get back to the accuser oh you did
[2:02:44] this you did
[2:02:45] that to be predestinated
[2:02:48] means to be way back before before there
[2:02:52] was a star before there was a moon
[2:02:54] before there was an earth before there
[2:02:56] was anything an Adam before there was
[2:02:59] anything moving you were in the back
[2:03:01] part of God's
[2:03:03] mind and listen I want to tell you that
[2:03:06] he did not think of you in your
[2:03:08] condition
[2:03:09] now because he doesn't think incomplete
[2:03:12] thoughts
[2:03:14] now he saw you as a perfect amen
[2:03:18] image just like him casing out Devils uh
[2:03:23] Healing The Sick preaching the Gospel of
[2:03:27] Jesus Christ amen standing for this
[2:03:30] message glory be to God
[2:03:33] Amen that's how he saw you amen and this
[2:03:37] is why when the devil said y you're not
[2:03:40] that well listen Devil he's still
[2:03:42] working on me don't worry about it don't
[2:03:44] worry you just hang around a little bit
[2:03:46] hang around a little while and you'll
[2:03:48] see he'll keep his
[2:03:50] word oh you're not in the book you're
[2:03:52] not in the book or what do you mean
[2:03:54] you're not in the book you know the
[2:03:55] devil don't even know whether you're in
[2:03:57] the book or not because because when the
[2:04:01] book was written he was even he wasn't
[2:04:04] even in
[2:04:07] existence so what he is doing he is
[2:04:10] guessing he is trying to make you doubt
[2:04:14] that you're in the
[2:04:15] book so you have to challenge your devil
[2:04:18] and say okay devil let's go back
[2:04:22] let's go back you want to take me back 5
[2:04:25] years no no no no that's not enough
[2:04:28] let's go back 20 and 30 and 30 and then
[2:04:30] way
[2:04:32] before there was a star there was a moon
[2:04:36] way before where were you when the sons
[2:04:39] of God shouted for joy and the morning
[2:04:41] Stars sang together I was

[2:07:25] Abraham amen after the battle of the
[2:07:28] Kings amen hallelujah he met a man that
[2:07:31] was called

[2:09:23] comes into your
[2:09:25] heart and brother BR said that's the
[2:09:27] only way we can get back to
[2:09:32] Eternity because the Holy Ghost is
[2:09:35] eternal and you know what it it's called
[2:09:42] Zoe the very life of
[2:09:45] God the very person of God listen man
[2:09:50] I'm not just looking for
[2:09:51] blessing I'm looking for the person of

[2:09:56] [Applause]
[2:10:00] God
[2:10:04] hallelujah he dropped
[2:10:06] down in
[2:10:08] time but during that time he had to put
[2:10:12] blood across the uh Chasm there across
[2:10:15] the the whole length of timeall to
[2:10:19] redeem it to push it back
[2:10:23] up amen Jesus was uh when he come in a
[2:10:27] flesh amen and dropped into time it did
[2:10:31] not stop him from being
[2:10:33] Eternal no but he just come down into
[2:10:37] time now he didn't come into time just
[2:10:40] to just pay us a visit he came into time
[2:10:43] to redeem those that have fallen into
[2:10:46] this little
[2:10:48] Loop Hallelujah glory be to God and to
[2:10:52] redeem all those amen hallelujah and to
[2:10:55] bring it back up not for everybody but
[2:10:59] for the elected predestinated seat of
[2:11:02] God before the foundation of the world
[2:11:05] Jesus said I don't pray for the world
[2:11:08] but I pray for those that God has given
[2:11:10] me glory be to God hallelujah he had a
[2:11:14] mission he had a purpose he had a amen
[2:11:18] you come from God and you go back to God
[2:11:20] again

[2:11:38] from eternity listen to me he come Jesus
[2:11:41] come from eternity and stepped into a
[2:11:44] space of time and he come amen and made
[2:11:48] a flesh amen and through here in the
[2:11:50] order Sanctified uh and and a streak of
[2:11:54] blood went across this place to redeem
[2:11:57] it and to connect it back to God again
[2:12:00] all for the uh eternity do you see that
[2:12:04] amen so therefore he come in a step uh
[2:12:07] and step into this body of time could
[2:12:09] you
[2:12:10] imagine Hallelujah the god of
[2:12:13] Glory he's
[2:12:17] Eternal he steps into time he puts on a
[2:12:20] body

[2:21:09] judged we all know
[2:21:11] that I hope you I hope I hope you you're
[2:21:14] in the message now every every sin has
[2:21:17] got to be
[2:21:18] judged he said uh but when we make
[2:21:22] mistakes and we
[2:21:23] sin not
[2:21:25] willingly that sin still has to be
[2:21:31] judged he said but when it's put under
[2:21:33] the blood of Jesus
[2:21:36] Christ Glory Glory that sin is broken
[2:21:47] downall is broken down the chemistry
[2:21:50] chemistry of that sin is broken
[2:21:55] down and this is a good thing that I
[2:21:57] like Glory Hallelujah the prophet say he
[2:21:59] sends it back to the
[2:22:02] one who made you do it

[2:23:40] Thunders is to show the
[2:23:47] bride but the seven Thunders
[2:23:50] is not going to prepare
[2:23:53] you listen to me because the bride in

[2:24:50] prepared
[2:24:53] Noah and gave him the instructions for
[2:24:56] the ark one day he had to get
[2:25:02] started he couldn't permit God to build
[2:25:05] the ark he had to you know and that's
[2:25:07] what shook the the the people around
[2:25:10] when they got when he got into
[2:25:12] action you see because at first it was a
[2:25:17] message next it was action
[2:25:22] amen this man is really building this
[2:25:27] Ark that that Ark shook them because he

[2:26:22] Simplicity of the Holy Ghost working in
[2:26:25] your heart the time has come amen that
