you have your bibles i'd like you to turn to two portion scriptures tonight deuteronomy chapter eight and first corinthians chapter 9 we want to read the whole chapter of deuteronomy chapter 8 and we want to read first characters 9 24 to 27 i think i i read that sometime before in the past this is deuteronomy chapter eight reading from verse one all the commandments which i command thee this d shall be observed to do that you may live and multiply and go in and possess the land which the lord sway unto your fathers and thou shall remember all the we which the lord thy god led thee these 40 years in the wilderness to humble thee and to prove thee to know what was in thine heart whether thou would keep us his commandments or no and he humbled me and suffered into hunger feddy with manner which down you is not neither thy fathers know that he might make thee know that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the lord that man live the arraignment wax not all upon thee neither did thy foot swell these forty years thou shall also consider in thine heart that as a man chased at his son so the lord i got chastened at thee therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the lord thy god to walk in his ways and to fear them for the lord i god bringeth thee into a good land a land of brooks of water fountains of depths and spring out of the valley and hills a land of wheat and barley and vines and fig trees and pomegranates a lot of oil honey olive on honey land where it though shall eat bread without scarceness though shall not lack anything in it a land whose stones are iron and out of whose hills thou mighters dig brass when thou has eaten are not full then thou shalt bless the lord thy god for the good land which he had given thee beware that thou forget not the lord thy god in not keeping his commandments and his judgments and his statutes which i commanded his day least when thou has eaten are not full and has built goodly houses and dwelt therein when thy hoods and eye flocks multiply and i silver and thy goal is multiplied and all that dou has is multiplied then thy heartbeat lifted up and thou forget the lord thy god which brought thee forth out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness wherein were fair recipients and scorpions and drought where there was no water who brought default water out of the rock of flint who fed thee in the wilderness with manner which thy fathers knew not that he might humble thee that he might prove thee to do the good at thy latter end and thou shalt say thine heart my power and the might of my hand had got me this wealth but thou shalt remember the lord thy god for it is he that giveth the power to get wealth and that he may establish his covenant which he sway unto thy fathers as in this day and shall be if thou do all at all forget the lord thy god and walk after other gods and save them and worship them i testify against you this day you shall surely perish as the nations which the lord destroy before your face so shall he perish because you would not be obedient unto the voice of the lord your god and from first corinthians chapter nine wondering from verse 24 paul speaking knowing not that day which run in a race run all but one receiver the prize so run that he may obtain that's a message we preached a couple of weeks ago and every man that strived for the mastery is temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptable crown but we are incorruptable i therefore still run not as uncertain so fight i not as one that beated the ear but i keep under my body and bring it in subjection least by any means when i have preached to others i myself should be a cast away and i think i want to just look at that scripture again first corinthians chapter 9 and you want to just read it in the amplified you say but like a boxer i buffet my body handle it roughly discipline it by hardships and subdue it for fear that after proclaiming to others the gospel and things spitting into it i myself should become unfit not stand the test be unapproved and rejected as a counterfeit let's bow heads one more time heavenly father we thank you for your word we have read it and only you could interpret it to our hearts lord and you know what's upon my heart to share with you people tonight mew inspired lord i i trust you tonight and i have confidence that you would come down among us and speak to our hearts and and change and transform our lives in jesus name i ask a team and you may be seated or praise god i certainly appreciate the bible study we're going to steve muller very uh last night oh praise the name of the lord uh it was a a nice word for us amen praise god so this will tie into that and tie into uh the last message we preach also okay so i have a title tonight the cost of freedom the cost of freedom of a subject discipline as a price and an inspiration freedom is not free or praise the name of the lord and uh romans itself tells us romans 8 14 first man led by the spirit of god are the sons of god you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you'll receive the spirit of adoption wherever you cried the father could imagine from coming from sinners god could release not the spirit of bondage but the spirit of adoption that you call abba father it's circumvent all the little mary's and all the secretaries and all the inbetweenies cut all that off it brings you direct access to god because you're not crying about pastor evangelist apostle you're kind of a father direct director your lord you're not coming to a man you're coming to direct source spirit of russian crime abba father and you have received again the spirit of the option cover the spirit itself buried witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if turin and ears ears of god joined it with christ so he's laid it out if if heirs is of god joining with christ if so if so if so that we suffer with him that we may be also be glorified together if i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory we shall reveal in us so if you can't suffer then they carry with him there's a price there's a cost we're going out somewhere this night amen for the earnest on expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of god and then it went on to talk about the creation supposed to be vanity but i want to jump into the amplified for the whole creation all nature waits expectantly and longs earnestly for god's sons to be made known wait for the revealing or the disclosing of their sonship it's almost as god's sons are hidden they are veiled but the nato itself is waiting for them to be unveiled oh glory to god for the creation which is nature was subject to frailty watched not because of some intentional fault of its part but by the will of him who subjected it yet to hope the nature of creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and corruption and gain entrance into the glorious freedom of god's children so we are promised what the bible called the glorious liberty of the sons of god hallelujah hallelujah from this bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty or the glorious freedom of the sons of god we wasn't made to be bong we wasn't made to be tied up we wasn't made to be tangled up we wasn't made to be in a prison we were made to be free in the image and likeness of god that's how god placed us in the garden of eden in the original oh give the lord a shout that's original commission oh let us put man in our image we have nothing on earth like him we're going to make one like ourselves and when god saw it was good oh give the lord some praises he made a spirit man oh glory to god no no flesh man the flesh getting a theft and a child he made a spirit man and said what's good he's in my image and likeness and in genesis 2 he put a dust man and put the spirit man in that dust man man became a living soul oh glory to god give the lord a shout because there was no man to tell the soil but we are going back to our sonship we are going back to inheritance oh hallelujah hallelujah do you believe that amen so we know the whole creation grown and travail it and paint together not only they but ourselves also we have the full suit of the spirit even we ourselves growing ourselves waiting for the adoption to with the redemption of our body now this word discipline it as a system it means that i got got um of it it means control gain by enforcing obedience or order that's what discipline means or prescribed conduct or pattern of behavior training that corrects molds or perfects the mental faculties or moral character that is what discipline is about you do this up in a child you try to run away bad behavior and that small child become a big big problem in society later on because there's no discipline but you know god doesn't have his sons running in discipline we know every son that committed god god has handled them a certain way because there's god you're talking about you're not talking about a man he you know doti grandfather all humanistic sons and daughters hallelujah real life grandchildren and so on we love that but god only our sons and daughters so all them mini babies and small babies then we go see sons and daughters even before they were born in the mother's womb oh hallelujah god see them as sons coming forth hallelujah so that's why they could tell rebecca maybe the mother of millions i mean your seed possessed the gates of them that hate him oh glory to god it wasn't just watching mother and father and all my wife you're watching generation upon generation hallelujah what is it the seed of the righteous because god knew there was a serpent seed on the earth they are going to pervert and table with judgment and everything else and they will so corrupt the earth that the seed of the righteous will get left and less and less and less so god had to preserve the seed of the righteous oh glory to god so he put something inside of you that you could respond to the word in your time in your generation in your season he put that inside of you and no adultery fornication lying drunken parents grandparents could stop you from coming forth you put your name on the book first and let me drop you along in time to whatever family to bring you forth you couldn't miss your appointment for nothing here you are tonight elected predestinated all glory to god not to be deceived oh go with the god amen hallelujah hebrews 5 8 talking about jesus though he was son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered so he suffered he learned obedience like that so we're not born on obedient children we learn obedience just as jesus had to learn it we have to learn it too and there's a way god will instruct and bring guidance and so on isn't that right first peter 4 1 2 says for as much as christ had suffered for us in the flesh i am yourself likewise with the same mind for he that suffered in the flesh had ceased from sin think about it all right i know there's not a nice smoothie smoothie service there's not like a press you know right here you put some frozen banana and some whipped cream and presents and they give wait let's call it again i'm gonna school drink a smoothie a smoothie they didn't have a smoothie tonight all right there's no smoothie all right so watch for as much as christ has suffered for us in the flesh arm yourself likewise with the same mind for he that suffered in the flesh that cease from sin that he should no longer live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lust of the men but to the will of god first peter 2 21-23 it says here for even here unto were he called because christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that we should follow his steps who did no sin neither was god found in his mouth who when he was reviled reviled again when he suffered he threatened not but committed himself to him that judge it righteously oh glory to god and then barbara was praying he said bless all coming together we pray lord uh this wednesday night that we have assembled knowing wherever two or more assembled together you'll be with us and we ask you lord to give us your word tonight speak to us lord warm our hearts strangely that we would know how to discipline ourselves for the great time that lays ahead as we believe that we are nearing the coming of the lord we thank thee for people now beginning to find faith dear to them and knowing what faith means and knowing even thanking you for service yet ahead believing that you're gonna lose something lord we are waiting with anticipation like the days of all believing that the time is near when you're going to just raise up the windows of heaven and pour out the promises that god has promised in this last day oh glory to god give the lord some praises do you believe it tonight are you on the expectation tonight are you under anticipation tonight i am under expectation oh glory to god i am on anticipation because i know god he's the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah let's continue he said last evening we were speaking on discipline in the church and i think we if we could get the church in a real spiritual attitude then there will be a revival really and it will be so much better for our prayers for the sick as long as our condition are slumping and this slumping going around the world coronavirus come and just drop a damper not not to the elect no they let press in their way because the love of many gonna wax coal because of iniquity all who have black sudden i have dead gonna gonna have coronavirus and iran and go kong them out oh glory to god but the bride will fight back the bible press all glory to god because the kingdom of god is at hand all glory to god church and our church oh if they shut me down we still present that ego's changing bride oh glory be born for this hour we raise up for this hour we were born for the press we are well glory we will raise up for the press for the council churches for anything the devil could put out there we are born to face the devil anywhere any time any place under any condition that's what we raise up for could we give the lord some praises tonight hallelujah hallelujah remember the devil can't get stronger but we can i feel like shouting tonight satan is still satan but he don't know who we are oh come on now hallelujah so watch as long as our conditions are shrunken we just don't seem to pick it up like we should but when everybody is sprayed up kid high and a great expectation i've walked to the platform many times be five or seven thousand people and not be one feeble person left as soon as you walk out on the platform everyone get all the wheelchair cuts and stretches and everything walk right away because you're under such expectation no that was in the days of the early beginning of the ministry before there was anybody else on the field it had to be kind of let down for a while and then everybody it was new and the people were just expecting anything now if you will have the same expectation you'll get the same results so nobody can tell me that was when the prophets are wrong and he reported him as you know if we get the same expectation we'll give the lord a shout we will have the same results because he is jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever oh glory to god do you believe that hallelujah so [Music] amen so now we know what happened when a boy come to a certain age that boy was adopted into the family they took him out in a public place put a special robe on him had a ceremony and all the people of the city gathered around and looked and they had looked upon this boy and the father a sermon of adoption don't miss this and that son was abducted his name on the checkbook was just as good as his daddy's there is where the god is trying to get his church god is what trying to get his church okay just say that this mountain be moved and we'll move authority sons of god the whole creation has grown and waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god waiting to a spot to where sickness will be arise and it will be that way the blind will receive their sight death and dumb we pray for them now but then you will command it didn't they didn't it said these sons you follow them believe they shall pray for the sick he said they shall cast our devil that i will they will and if you say to the smoke not if i say if you say to this mountain be move and don't doubt in your heart what we need is adoption need adoption sons and daughters need adoption but how can the church here we go the pentecostal church and the methodist and the baptist church be adopted until they come to discipline no discipline no adoption let me say it again no discipline no adoption the church must come into discipline hallelujah not people run around with their own feelings because discipline is separate from feelings now this opinion is the order of things you have to do it because it needs to be done even if you feel like it you feel enough to take a seat but it's the father's business oh glory to god when somebody owned a business they had to open it and close it it's their business they're feeling sick they're still going because it's their business oh glory to god they have to see about their business and god have a business it's the kingdom of god you have to be interested in your father's business jesus i must be up with my father's business he wasn't caring about his feelings he was concerned about his father's business well give the lord a shout all glory hallelujah okay watch how can the church the pentecostal church watch and the methodists and the baptist churches be adopted until they come to discipline we have got to be disciplined first i know you don't hear much preaching on this but this is the word here now oh hello people adoption and speak the word when you press come down oh yeah take this before all this press come down and because you you have this mountain you feel so deep and you feel so on take this you've got to be disciplined first god could not trust his power with the church it's hard to tell what they will do you might want to speak me out of existence they don't know you like my head so god can't put power on all of that that crazy stuff you have to go and see what's in their heart oh glory to god when the children of israel wanted the freedom go deliver us deliver us but they gave good food philosophy them to the full isn't that right they were feeding them to work hard to build the cities god sent moses to deliver them what a jubilee to leave egypt hallelujah now they're going where they don't know two million people god sent manna and you had the bible study but but isaac talking about it when manna falls the people find me by the light it tastes like coriander seed and in egypt they had meat in egypt they had this it wasn't so hard as it was in egypt they're studying the bondage they're studying the licks they're saying all of that they're only studying oh they can't handle what god given them now and all god trying to get them to is to the promised land all of this is journey manner is journey hallelujah what in the rock this journey hallelujah all this thing is journey you see what i've scripted i read he said your foot didn't swell oh glory to god i kept you for 40 years all glory to god remember who brought you out when you build your big house when you have your money when you have your car you better don't forget me because i am the one who brought you out and empower you to get what you get or give the lord a shout in the house oh hallelujah praise god hallelujah you say how could a father trust his business with a boy that might simply pollute his whole inheritance he can do it the church has got to come to a place to where it is disciplined god's under work right now discipline he took that son out made a ceremony this is my son i adopt him and watch he was take that to jesus right and jesus had pleased him he took him up took three early witnesses peter james and john he called it hope faith and charity and brought moses and elijah down to witness this great adoption what was he done there is something special here tonight what we're gonna say here tonight the bible said he was transfigured and his rainman shine like the sun a special robe listen to these words a special robe a special anointing oh glory to god a special robe a special anointing and when they looked up they saw him shining in the glory of god and a voice said this is my beloved son here in him what god wants to do with the church tonight he wants to do with an individual is to find somebody the holy spirit is searching to find men that he can take out a certain place and speak to that person anoint them and give them something special great powers and gifts to work his will and to do his will not to stand up and just talk behind pulpit or give the lord some praises but great powers and gifts to do his will and to work as well so what am i supposed to expect more talk oh glory to god how can he do it if he constantly has to compensate oh it's terrible they just run after this they run after error they won't go to church look at what the conditioned churches if god can't do it to the body he will pick up individuals and do it god is able to rise children unto abraham oh glory to god so when we spoke the last message we talk about entitlement right and paul was showing that he didn't consider himself entitled and he considered himself pressing towards the mark he considered himself going amen are running a certain way because there are no shortcuts hallelujah and he said therefore so run not as uncertainly sulfite eye as one that beats the air but i keep my body and bring it on subjection so what he was saying and he was keeping in the discipline in order to win in order to stand in order to run or give the lord a shout you see some people just think they are just predestinated and they sit back and tight entitled to the rapture and that's a lie from the bitter hell you can't overcome a full-time devil being a part-time christian or give the lord some praises and this devil not don't have corona virus and you do not know quarantine what gives the lord some praises he has actively bringing unbelief to people's mind he is actively depressing and frustrating and dropping darkness upon people you have to be actively pursuing the promises of the living god come on preach back to me somebody you have to be active in your pursuit to the mark of the high calling in christ jesus let's continue he said you know what i believe he said people are convinced that jesus is coming soon i don't believe that the people are convinced he's coming in this age i believe the reason they are not concerned is because they're not convinced fully convinced they are not convinced he's with them that's a big one they're not convinced he is with them if they will they will come back to the world is the same god that we read in the bible is the same god receiving you know it's not a different god you know is the same god of moses i exaggerate same one you know he's not a modern one we have you know the same one you know oh hallelujah they'll come back to the way that's right how many people might misunderstand it he said love is discipline that's a big one love is what discipline you must discipline people if you love them if your little girl was sitting out in the room as i said this morning making mud kicks if you really love her you will get off that road so love is discipline as many as i love i rebuke and i chase him so when they get rebuked and chastened you in the you you recite of his love his eyes of love is upon you oh glory to god the price you pay for freedom everything cost and freedom cost hallelujah do you believe that you know what it costs back in egypt he said let them take a lamb and take the blood put it indoor pose a lamb for a house what houses they had in them time lamb was losing the neck you know because they needed the blood to put in that door post he said when i see the blood i'm going to pass over you a lamb for a house a price had to be paid so you know when but anthony was singing tonight when i see the blood or one of the blood songs there i say you know it's all a song different from me tonight when i hear blood i see in christ not i knew it was the blood you know the blood you're singing a song like if it's just blood no it's a price oh glory to god to get the book was the price when jesus died he's just like to save you he'd have to redeem you he died to get the book because no man's song wouldn't take the book the book that adam had oh glory to gosh is a black prize and god couldn't get our angels and do it he came among himself the word became flesh whole glory to god he had to become flesh to have blood to pay the price for our redemption that we can get blood transfusion god become man oh glory to god that we could be redeemed tonight through the forgiveness of sins and the reconciliation back to god what could you praise them tonight you we have we have so much to praise god for tonight oh glory to god hallelujah there's a price to pray so now the price is rejection the price of separation a price of holiness the price for the extra oil why do you think the wise version can tell the foolish go to them that sell and buy what the full wise was saying you have to pay the price to get what we have because what i have wasn't free where i get it you are the one get it oh it thought it was free no freedom is not free people think freedom is free but it's not there's a price behind that hallelujah revival doesn't come free either there's some people waiting to see revival to step in and jump on and take a ride doesn't work the price for the extra oil you have to get a burden of freedom for yourself you have to want to be free and pay the price to be free glory to god two million people free from pharaoh but not free from themselves hallelujah thank you lord pharaoh no more fast masters but here they are with themselves by the hearts with the desires that will be exposed by the wilderness journey or dangerous god set up to try them to see what was in their heart whether they would serve god or not oh my two million people some of them are not christians some of them they don't even know god they're drifting out with the crowd mixed multitude called by the shout message mixed multitude three kinds coming out believing a message of the hour glory to god another two million people joshua and kill him have something in their heart if nothing they heard it in their heart they can't help it oh oh glory to god it lived on for 40 years until joshua stand up and said caleb somebody said just as strong as when i first started out if the lord be with me i shall be able to drive out the enemy he wasn't asking god to drive in about he know he had to drive them out bunch of lazy christians they're driving up nothing but you have to get some strength get some faith and say okay i'm not gonna take it no more time to drive them out oh give the lord a shout hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god sometimes we get motivated we get inspired and after we get inspired the fire lasts for a week two weeks afterwards it just go out and something struck me and i wrote this down the flames of motivation will go out unless the wood of discipline is placed correctly under it you ever let that fire and put kerosene on it you put flame blood bloosh and just die out i have no wood you have nothing for the fire to catch you take it and you're poor the gasoline and it blow up but there is nothing there to maintain and sustain that fire how much people want to lose weight and they get excited join gym and after two three weeks all excitement gone because they have to go into discipline to really get it done oh hallelujah it doesn't the muscles on the and dropping it doesn't come overnight but you have to stick with it discipline brings it through there's a price for everything the students who want to be successful with the exams there's a discipline hallelujah they want to play but they have a cost to play if they want to get these subjects take two students one discipline do their homework do the work instructed to them flip 30 years on that and you see where they are another student playful playful playful not focused flip the script 30 years after that and see where they are at it's two different roads two different directions well his sons everywhere sons of god but this message come to produce adopted sons vindicated sons manifested sons oh glory to god disciplined sons could we give the lord some praises glory to god this message can't bring us in discipline with your sons but we will not be placed oh glory to god are you with me tonight hallelujah said the word of the word represent that discipline that effect upon your life that must harness you to the word that you could put yourself your feelings aside and be committed to what you are responsible for all glory to god here feel like you feel like and i'm feeling low and i feel what are the ranging jesus and go by feel it he was tired he was wary but he did what he had to do oh give the lord a shout you think he wasn't tired in the garden of gethsemane but he did what he had was to do you can't tell me them disciples was more tired than him he said can't you watch me one hour oh glory to god he comes to the end of his ministry now he needed a final encouragement and support from the men who was around him to three and a half years and he was killing sleep god he didn't have the burden i didn't recognize the cost and the price that he had to pay but he set himself the bible said he set his face toward jerusalem he set his face towards the cross because his mind is made up now he knew where he was going oh glory to god he's going to pay the price god in service to die gold frankincense and myrrh god and service to die hallelujah his debt was to pay the price for our liberty tonight his debt was to pay the price for more of freedom tonight all glory cost him and it will cost us all glory to god to see it through for others there is no shortcut there is no other way face up to it oh glory if you are a slacker and you don't want to study the word yourself any man could deceive you because you're leaving up to him to interpret the word to you and god sent a messenger with a message that is thus here the lord lord check inaudible the man preaching by the word oh give the lord a shout don't be though dead and lazy that is a man of god and you might not go check him out try the spirit see if they of god oh glory to god and trust in no man i trust in god are taking the word and checking every spirit out oh because many false spirits have come into the world much of them lying all around the world right now same line spirit that drop upon 400 prophets i feel we have over ten thousand false prophets in this world or more and the same spirit anointing all of them lying prophets oh recorded not speaking according to the word every man would be a lion man be true wow wow wow wow so paul was under discipline that's why he could conduct his bodies roughly that he didn't want to be a cast away he didn't want to be after he preached a gospel he ended up on the scrap heap but i'm saying many ministers would end up on the scrap heap because they didn't end it right they're trying to work the works of christ before having the life of christ and that can't work there's not a pentecostal age die by god given all this length of time and there's eight times of lingering waiting not for constant churches and press here waiting for them you know he reading verse god is waiting on you and i adoption time when god could pour out his spirit oh god paul is putting a bunch of nonsense you had to get the word right the foundation right the mechanics right oh give the lord some praises oh glory to god so what is a disciple what is becoming a disciple a disciple is a follower a student of christ christ being the master and luke 9 23 he said unto them if any man will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me my i must hold something if anyone will come after me come after which is a follower which is a disciple let him deny himself i'll take up his cross daily i want to underline that word daily that means it's a daily walk daily talk that's a choice you know you ought to make you know to make it daily reading the word daily praying daily applying daily fighting daily pressing daily a christian every single day that's why i'm saying make yourself a christian make yourself a christian is that no holy water to drink can they become a christian you make yourself a christian luke 14 and whoever does not bear the cross and come after me can i be my disciple bear the cross and come after. bear it and come after. go get a cross and you have to come after he says sit down oh we have to follow yes who the pastor know him yeah they can follow me as i follow christ you have to know that you're following christ but the key is christ paul said follow me as i follow christ conditional okay he said now watch whoever does not bear crosstalk and come after me cannot be my disciple for which of you come on now intend to build a tower sit a knock first and come to cost whether you are sufficient to finish it at least happily after he had laid the foundation he's not able to finish it and all the people begin to mock him saying this man begin to build and he was not able to finish what did the prophet teach us is that him who starts is him who finished you have to count the course oh if you will finish he said which man he said what oh what king going to make war against another king sit down first and consulted whether he be able with ten thousand to meet with him he's committed against him with twenty thousand or else which the other is a great way off he standeth ambassador and desired condition of peace so likewise here we go whosoever he be of you that forsaken not all he had he cannot be my disciples so jesus was clearly defining discipleship who is going to make it as a disciple of christ the price of separation mother father brother uncle or whoever it is and follow me after me so you can't let them throw you off nobody must throw you off the atmosphere may not be an anchor in your spirit not wife not children not grandchildren not family nobody must throw you off i wouldn't allow anybody to interfere with my space i began to thank god for removing people out of my space glory to god to take them out of my space it gave me more room bye-bye oh glory to god god removed them out of your space yes god remove hypocrites god remove bright males and brighter systems you are bride oh glory to god you are called to make yourself ready oh give the lord a shout stop leading on don't do like king uzziah isalian and can you say i don't lean on nobody there's a lot of shout out between a bed oh i feel good tonight one take and one left stop leaning don't lean on the church don't lean on a pastor don't leave no elder don't eat on your husband don't leave your wife if your husband not making it you make it if your wife are gonna make it you make it enough walk with god i was not if they talk nothing about his wife look at the lord some praises there's going to be a rapture oh glory to god there's going to be a resurrection hallelujah there's going to be perfection blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah that same message we read this also i said a man had two sons islam luke 15 younger man of them said to his father father give me the portion of good that followed to me these are next entitled one here work fit is that his money tell the father give me what and title ii giving proportion divided them onto them as living and that made themselves the younger son gathered all together and took a journey for our country he he gone he gone he have a certain far country you know going on there with him he i want no discipline here one or that he won't nobody tell him what to do he gone you have freedom now freedom to play fool freedom to backslide freedom to go to party freedom to fact freedom to spend with who whenever however his money ran out with the freedom his freedom behind him his freedom put him in bondage his freedom conquered him you want freedom freedom is not free oh glory to god freedom come with a price you know why them generation said well imagine they were crying in a camp fire come down and judge them and they were crying for meat because they eat to the full in egypt they were saying it's better it was in bondage they were telling god that they didn't deliver us if he had his light manner yeah they were throwing back things in the face of god and god was angry and when god dropped all them quails and all their meat on them so while they eaten judgment took them they didn't couldn't even chew it just man struck them hallelujah god hated that you think people are still learning from that afterwards that judgment passed they're going back to normal back to normal i hope after this message tonight and not back to normal for you i hope you realize freedom is not free and that is why a nurse and safari could be killed in the church because freedom is not free to have a price for the behavior and attitude oh glory to god you can't say nice peter he's a fisherman i know him long time and what we are in the school with peter no he's not that you know he's fire inside peter's soul and god is veiled inside the deer oh give the lord some praise and that same god coming back to veil himself and sons and daughters of god be careful oh glory to god hallelujah glory to god hallelujah the father gave the son the freedom he wanted you want freedom you want money take it and take it and look what you did with it burn it down to the ground money didn't work for wealth he didn't inherit he didn't even earn but he could put it on but that son luckily caught himself just in time he said he came to himself and if you entire up tonight you better come to yourself come to your senses tonight you will go to hell if you don't repent you'll go to hell if you're going off the path you will god will judge you and kill you too what the people in this message don't understand the message never seen judgment yet god gave them 40 years of grace 40 years of space 40 years and must and plus of lingering but judgment is about to begin you know where beginning right you know where it's starting right in the house of god and he's certainly the ancient man who is in the house god had brought him into gray here an old man they perish in the wilderness and those arrogant pharisees and those jews were saved our fathers eat man in the wilderness and jesus under everyone dead separated from god the same people god brought out is the same people got killed oh glory to god i fighting for my life tonight oh glory to god i believe this message and i ain't gonna let somebody come and throw me off key oh glory to god to face the judgment of god not when the blood of jesus paid for my liberty all glory to god will not win the blood of jesus pay for my freedom i go like no blind man by me no message prophet no message apostle no message poop no message man none of them give the lord some praises if i am free i want you to be free i know you buying to me or buying to this group praise god you must follow the pillar fire wherever it moves you follow that oh glory to god the purifier is here tonight hallelujah oh give the lord a shout hallelujah [Music] [Applause] jesus died to produce this redemption oh god feel good tonight jesus died to produce the adoption jesus died to produce the manifestation of the sons of god which devil which demon which from hell could stop that from coming forth that's what he died for what he paid for is already paid for he's got to have it it's paid for already you're healing paid for your ceiling paid for your revival paid for your restoration paid for your deliverance paid for your anointing paid for peaceful [Applause] [Music] people there's a price for everything to build a house to build a home because another home always just bricks and cement and sun but if there's coil and fuss inside i know who this is a house of people standing in it moving along in it it takes a cost and a price to build relationships a bill is not right school life it takes study don't want to pass the exams i want to achieve oh my hallelujah being a slave is easier actually than freedom because the master gave you clues the master gave you food you do have the responsibility of you the master have the responsibility over you he could beat you he could give you joy you give the ice cream give you a reward all you do yes sir yes master yes no sir you're under slavery in the bondage notice what god told them this man and thing when they hit the land it ceased because they cut down land now that the dig that the plant that the soul for 40 years they're getting blessed in the wilderness because god provided for them because you want to bring them to the promised land to show them he is good and he keeps his word he asked them ministers to go and bring a report and then baxter men in moses message brought back our evil report god judge all of them for that they say we can't go to the thunders on the back side of the book then bunch of liars keeping great men from going there because back to the book is ephesians practical book is an abduction black in the book is that perfection that says the book is connected to what's inside the book oh glory to god the seas on the back of the book okay the lord has shout but just when caleb stood we are more than able to take that land 40 years to see people die funeral service after funeral service but they have to live with you out all until every one of them died i'm almost done [Music] you know what god kept them for in the wilderness for them why somebody get pregnant to have children because god know them two million rascals they're going no promised land

you have to know who the word is your mate is the reveal word glory to god the brilliant brandon came to reveal the bible so we can take the message and go back to the bible hallelujah because the

heart and you shall find rest unto your souls here we go for my yoke is easy and my burden is light yes there's burdens all over but his own is light light than what the devil put upon you lighter than the bondage of the freedom the devil could give on you oh glory to god my yoke is easy my burden is light oh my hallelujah so the word made flesh is what paid the price for our liberty tonight miracle come up please watch we know this one do you want to always read familiar with this one he's on man running from the presence of god he was saying dear jesus help us tonight now in these few words as we wait upon thee and we pray that your grace and mercy will be with us lord and tend our hearts move back all the shocks the torns the tissues let the blessed sunshine of god fall in upon the word lord and may we have such a great meeting till there will be not be an unsafe person among us all the children will be in the kingdom of god and those who are the baptism of the spirit may they receive it may they receive it does it out it all right watch me all the great mysteries here we go that we are supposed to know at this age lord be unveiled to us reason that we will see the plainness of god what for so that we will know how to behave ourselves and act correcting ourselves and bringing here we go the members of our body into the discipline to the word that's your job that we might know how to live in this present day in the approaching of the lord jesus so all the seals all the mysteries is for us to get a revelation of the plainness of god to know how to behave what is that romans 12 present your body's a living sacrifice about this even say which is a reasonable service the lowest level hallelujah that they may prove what is that good acceptable of god hallelujah hebrews 10 and every priest who's 11 standard ministering and offering of times the same sacrifice which can never take away sins but this man like that after he had offered one sacrifice for sin forever sat down at the right hand of god from henceforth expecting till his enemies we made the footstool for by one offering he had perfected forever them that are sanctified oh my do you believe that tonight oh blessed be the name of the lord o praise god hallelujah hallelujah i'm about to close oh my but abraham let us examine the first phrase that remains i love and the greek the emphasis is upon the peace not pronoun i he does not say as many would feel he should say as as many as love me no sir we must never try to make jesus the object of human love in this verse not is as many that are that are the loved ones of god it is his loving question not ours so once again we find ourselves glory in his salvation his purpose and his plan and we are confirmed even more strongly in the truth of the doctrine of the sovereignty of god even as he said in romans 9 13 jacob have i loved does it not obtain that he also loved only the many is he therefore in the state of complacency awaiting the love of those who have not drawn nigh him by no means is this so for he declared in romans 8 9 13 he saw have i hated and in verse 11 the spirit boldly calls out for the children not being born neither have done anything good or evil that the purpose of god according to election might stand not a works but of him that call it this love here we go as we close tonight is elective love it is his love for his elect and his love for them is apart from human merit nothing you could do could deserve this love it is his love it's a path from human merit for it says that the purpose of god stands in election which is exactly opposite to works or anything man in himself because before the show were born he had already said jacob have i loved and he so have i hated and now he said to his own as many as i love a rebuke and chasing to rebuke is to reprove to reprove is to expose with a future correction chasing does not need to punish it means a discipline because the subject amendment is in mind this is exactly what we find in hebrews 12 5 11. for you have forgotten the exaltation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not the chastening of the lord nor faint when thought rebuked of him for whom the lord loved it he chastened it and scorch it every son whom he receive it if you end your chaste and god delivered you as with son for what son is he whom the father chastened not but if he be without chastisement way of all are partakers then your bastards are not sons furthermore we have had fathers our flesh which corrected us and we give them reverence shall we not much more rather be the subjection of the father of spirit live for they verily for a few days chasteness after their own pleasure but he for our prophet that we might be partakers of his holiness now not chasing for the present seemer to be joyous but grievous nevertheless afterwards it healed the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them that are exercised nearby hearing is now set forth the love of god he desired in love a family of his own a family of sons sons like himself there before him lies all mankind has one lump of clay out of the same lump he will now make vessels under honor on the dishonor the chosen will be his own chosen then those chosen ones born of his spirit will be trained watch to conform to his image in their walk he reproves them with all long suffering and gentleness and mercy he chastened with neil's guide hands sometimes this spotter must take the vessel he's working on and totally break it down in order that he may rebuild it exactly as he does desired but it is love that is his love another way of his love there is not they cannot be let's all [Music] oh stand he loves you oh how he loves me [Music] oh how he loves you
