[16:35] God I am
[16:36] blessed amen so before we get into the
[16:40] service that we have for you this
[16:42] morning I want to just share few
[16:45] Thoughts with you from the prophet's
[16:48] message question and answers with a br
[16:52] God has a hard time trying to get
[16:56] somebody that he could deal with
[16:59] that will stay humble and meek and stay
[17:02] in the place until God calls him to do
[17:05] something you believe that see a man
[17:09] that God can bless and he will still
[17:11] keep himself a man and not be an angel
[17:15] or a
[17:19] God hallelu as soon as a man gets
[17:23] blessed and has a little just a little
[17:26] something given to him like how but BR
[17:29] phras that a little something just just
[17:32] a little something given to him he wants
[17:35] to be a God he wants to become an angel
[17:39] he wants to become some great person
[17:42] what I do me me mine all that that's the
[17:47] wrong attitude am God's hunting for
[17:50] somebody M who he could bless amen pour
[17:54] out the
[17:55] blessings and the more he is blessed the
[17:58] little the man will become Hallelujah
[18:01] and you will never get more of God until
[18:05] you become
[18:06] nothing you have got to be little
[18:08] yourself he that will exalt himself God
[18:11] will bring a beast and he will humble
[18:14] himself God will exalt you have got to
[18:17] get little before you can get big and
[18:20] you will never be big in your own self
[18:22] you'll be only as big as God will be big
[18:25] in
[18:26] you or could we give the Lord
[18:29] shout on that
[18:32] one and this is from say this the time
[18:35] is this the sign of the answer now I do
[18:37] not believe that there's anything that
[18:39] he has spoken all these years of my life
[18:42] that I have spoke to the people but what
[18:44] come to
[18:45] pass now many people have come with
[18:48] dreams and he would let me by his grace
[18:50] interpret for the people many has come
[18:53] with dreams and with problems that I was
[18:56] unable to interpret
[18:58] and I haven't tried to introduce to you
[19:01] people a gimmick that has all the
[19:05] answers I try to be honest to tell you
[19:08] what was truth and I could only tell you
[19:12] as he told me amen and then as it come
[19:16] to me I could tell you and I want to
[19:18] warn
[19:20] you in this day that we living in not
[19:24] saying anything against people but when
[19:25] you see a man when you see a person
[19:28] that's got the answer to everything
[19:30] that's contrary to the
[19:34] word the amen song in the light on that
[19:36] one I want it to be clear this is no
[19:39] gimmick thing we we have all the answers
[19:41] no no no no I want to warn you he said
[19:44] yes when you see a person that got the
[19:47] answer to everything that is contrary to
[19:53] the word amen Jesus said there were many
[19:56] lepers in the Days of Elijah
[19:58] but only one was healed in the many
[20:01] years the 8 more that Elijah lived one
[20:04] leper was healed many widows in the days
[20:07] of Elisha he was only sent to one yeah
[20:10] and we find out that there are many
[20:12] things that God does that he doesn't
[20:15] reveal to his
[20:17] servants I'm not hearing you I want to
[20:20] hear a bigger amen than that many thing
[20:23] that God does that he does not reveal to
[20:27] his servant no servant is greater than
[20:29] his
[20:34] Lord and God will not share his glory
[20:38] with
[20:39] nobody he is God oh give the Lord a
[20:43] shout in the
[20:47] house and when a servant comes to a
[20:50] place he tries to take the place of God
[20:53] some do that know the playing
[20:55] God then God takes his life and moves
[20:57] him away somewhere or something we must
[20:59] remember that so I trust that these few
[21:02] things will edify you that's what you C
[21:04] here for edify you and we could be
[21:07] judged by the word because every gift
[21:09] going to be judged every man is going to
[21:11] be judged all of us going to be judged
[21:14] by the word oh Hallelujah so we not
[21:17] trying to compare ourselves with William
[21:19] brandham and his experience like years
[21:21] ago there was a brother used to preach
[21:22] all kind of things sit down and preach
[21:24] preach for two hours not preach really
[21:26] talk talk they were talk in those days
[21:29] and he said brother brandham uh melt a
[21:32] cigarette pack in the forest and preach
[21:35] a man called thinking man's filter so he
[21:37] can meet a fan he can meet a a box of
[21:40] matches he can meet anything and be a
[21:42] sermon from that so all of them playing
[21:44] mini profit they could just take a word
[21:47] and get an experience and talk and talk
[21:49] and talk and talk and talk so you find
[21:51] out that I am not interested in those
[21:54] sidh shows I call them those experience
[21:56] that belong to brandham and here's why
[22:00] you have to look at listen carefully not
[22:02] so much the prophet you know but the
[22:05] prophet's prophecy amen let me say that
[22:09] again amen not the prophet but the
[22:11] prophet's prophecy you see the prophecy
[22:14] said they would
[22:16] stagger with and have on a lips uh
[22:18] staggering lips and tongues and so the
[22:20] prophecy said that now if you're
[22:22] watching Jesus you could say Jesus never
[22:24] stagger Jesus never speak in tongues and
[22:26] and and fall along in the upper room and
[22:28] no no no so you watching Jesus but
[22:29] you're not watching the prophecy what
[22:31] Jesus fulfilled was his prophecy what is
[22:34] for you is your prophecy so you have to
[22:38] understand that the scriptures prophesy
[22:41] certain things to be fulfilled so it
[22:43] didn't prophesy we be like brother
[22:45] brandham have a hat and go and hunt and
[22:47] so on I'm not living in that kind of
[22:49] area and so on there's a scripture for
[22:51] you to be fulfilled isn't that right so
[22:53] you don't watch the just the prophet but
[22:54] you watch The Prophet's prophecy what is
[22:56] to be here for this time look how much
[22:58] mockery of brother Brandon for
[22:59] prophesying about the car shaped like a
[23:02] egg that you don't need steering wheel
[23:04] and it was controlled by some power look
[23:06] all they mck and make fun and look how
[23:07] they have it right now and it's normal
[23:09] normal normal normal but he said before
[23:11] the end science will increase so
[23:13] powerfully that they will create the car
[23:15] that don't need a steering wheel he saw
[23:17] people sitting in it and they were
[23:18] playing cars or playing games and
[23:20] whatnot and it was taking them to the
[23:21] destination well that's what they have
[23:23] now that's what they're coming up with
[23:24] now why we are nearing the end praise
[23:28] God he said before the end this is
[23:29] supposed to happen but we see it coming
[23:31] in front of us but be near in the end
[23:34] then there going to be a briad Revival
[23:36] why we are nearing the end there's going
[23:38] to be a super Church a super race why we
[23:40] are nearing the end when the power of
[23:42] this church Rises it will bring the
[23:44] brethren we are nearing the end praise
[23:47] God men have feeling for fear we are
[23:49] nearing the end Russia com in position

[23:55] church we are nearing the end the

[23:59] greater move higher and higher why we
[24:01] are nearing the end there's got to be a

[40:22] without spot and blameless and account
[40:25] that long suffering of Our Lord is
[40:27] salvation even as our beloved brother
[40:29] Paul also according to the wisdom given
[40:32] unto him had written un unto you and
[40:34] also in all his Epistles speaking in
[40:36] them of these things in which some
[40:38] things had to be understood which they
[40:41] that are unlearn an unstable rest as
[40:44] they do also the other scriptures unto
[40:47] their own destruction amen ye therefore
[40:50] beloved seeing you know these things

[41:07] amen oh blessed could we give the Lord
[41:09] and praise His

[41:21] life he lost his inheritance in that
[41:25] eternal life
[41:27] God was God over the universe Adam was a
[41:30] god of the earth isn't that right and we
[41:33] are promised a double portion Hallelujah
[41:37] isn't that right not only the baptism do
[41:39] a down payment but a baptism to change
[41:42] our B mortal bodies am isn't that right
[41:46] because God is Not only redeeming your
[41:47] soul and your spirit he has to also
[41:51] redeem your body also Romans 8 says but
[41:54] not we not only they but we also our El
[41:56] have the first fruit of the spirit we
[41:59] ourselves grown within ourselves waiting
[42:02] for the adoption to with the Redemption
[42:06] of the body Hallelujah so there's a
[42:09] spiritual adoption and there's a
[42:11] physical adoption we have to come to the
[42:13] physical adoption but before the
[42:15] physical adoption there'll be a
[42:16] spiritual adoption where God could take
[42:18] his sons and said listen here him amen
[42:21] my life is in him my voice is in him my
[42:24] virtues is in him my blood flows through
[42:27] him hear ye him oh glory to God you

[42:45] he send them to half place and they come
[42:47] through hallelujah praise God all kind
[42:50] of CH and testin but they're going to
[42:52] come out Victorious because God promised
[42:55] that kind of son and last days not no
[42:57] church W bench no no no no no rugged

[43:31] Army Hallelujah hallel Mighty Men of God
[43:35] oh give the Lord some Praises people
[43:38] hallelujah hallelujah glory to God you
[43:41] may be seated so let's get down now
[43:43] let's get down into the harness
[43:45] Hallelujah Israel and the church brother
[43:47] bandam says watch if we can't have faith
[43:52] for Divine Healing yes how are we going
[43:55] to have Rapture in
[43:58] fith that alone should shake up this
[44:01] entire message
[44:03] world if we can't have a healing
[44:05] campaign if we can't have faith for
[44:07] Divine Healing wait my Rapture have no
[44:09] Rapture coming where there's no Divine
[44:11] Healing it has to have Divine Healing
[44:14] you're going to find out what that is
[44:15] all about it's not by chance it's not
[44:16] like praying for the sick and we are
[44:18] Pentecostals and no no no no it's not
[44:20] that it's a program of
[44:22] God cu the Raptor is actually a
[44:24] glorified healing
[44:26] mortal put on immortality corruption
[44:29] putting on
[44:31] incorruption so healing is the earnest
[44:33] of the Rapture DK payment that if God
[44:37] could take a old liver and make a new
[44:39] liver you don't hear what I'm saying if
[44:40] God could take a old heart and give you
[44:43] if God could take cancer and dissolve it
[44:45] if God could take your female problem
[44:46] and
[44:49] [Applause]
[44:53] dissolve my god of God could take your
[44:56] Blind Eye and pop that open and give you
[44:59] a new player eyes new kidneys God could

[52:16] more knowledge more information more
[52:18] deeper Mysteries Hidden Mysteries
[52:19] mystery
[52:21] Mysteries the mysterious Hidden
[52:23] Mysteries the mysterious mysterious
[52:25] Mysteries and go like that mysterious
[52:27] mysterious mysterious mysterious
[52:29] hidden flip it all over your
[52:32] one do I know
[52:39] all some of them get so idle now they
[52:41] just they're making their own Mysteries
[52:44] now they're making God like a
[52:47] puzzle that that like Catholic Church
[52:49] long time they taking the whole whole
[52:51] thing in Latin everybody
[52:53] clueless sick
[53:00] all you know confid wafer and that's it
[53:02] Church done they speak in tongues for
[53:04] the whole service they're talking Latin
[53:07] people don't know Latin only priests
[53:09] doing all the s and thing drinking his
[53:11] own wine and some give you a little
[53:12] thing and then D it and you home you
[53:15] good for the day well that's what them
[53:16] preachers doing right now they're
[53:17] talking
[53:19] Latin a Latin mystery a Latin language
[53:22] unknown
[53:23] language it's so the people don't to
[53:25] live nothing just say boy that is the
[53:29] man that is my man that my pastor as if
[53:32] God said truly P Rapture but said this
[53:35] message and teaching call his t a
[53:37] perfect man is the man that going to be
[53:39] redeemed at the end of the seven seal
[53:41] this is a message that ties the man
[53:43] that's going to be redeemed those
[53:45] virtues must be in the man the man can
[53:47] come and he have virtues anybody can say
[53:49] that they have all seven let me test
[53:51] this
[53:52] one let me see one just one we want to
[53:55] see where are we have seven virtues okay
[53:58] let's test it you
[54:01] frightened you can have all this
[54:03] virtuous and frighten afraid all I want
[54:05] to see is the test of forgiveness
[54:08] yes that's all I want to see you forgive
[54:13] me that's all I want to know because if
[54:17] you forgive me you would love me I short
[54:20] to your lovable oh come on give those
[54:22] some Praises people yeah feel like that
[54:25] in feel like shouting feel like praising
[54:29] God you can't tell me you have virtues
[54:31] you can't forgive you
[54:33] nutcase that makes no sense because that
[54:37] is what this age is about brotherly
[54:40] kindness because faith is based on
[54:42] forgiveness what a mighty God we serve
[54:45] he makees sure you can't get Faith until
[54:47] you could
[54:48] forgive so people could do whatever they
[54:51] want to do don't let it stick on you to
[54:54] hold a heart or a grudge Give the Lord a
[54:56] shout in the
[55:01] house the test is not for them that's
[55:04] when you making excuses he did me and
[55:07] she did me and some excuse that's you
[55:09] making excuses the test is on you to see
[55:12] if you would let it go to see if you'll
[55:15] forgive because when you break that song
[55:17] barrier of unforgiveness when you break
[55:19] that s and I can't forgive you in a
[55:21] different realm all together in a realm
[55:23] of communication with God
[55:25] then your communication restored back to
[55:27] God isn't that right now you could speak
[55:30] to the mountain then you could speak to
[55:32] the Rock because you have a basis of
[55:34] Faith to approach God a faith without
[55:36] fear a faith without condemnation a
[55:38] faith without holding anybody art oh
[55:40] Hallelujah Glory so I believe the
[55:43] phenomenal the baptism of the spirit
[55:45] Power signs and wonders this great
[55:46] pouring of God's spirit in the last days
[55:49] that's the thing that will bring Faith
[55:53] into the people that that will take a
[55:55] rapturing Fai that will take the church
[55:58] into Glory I believe it amen what is
[56:01] going to bring it great outpouring of
[56:04] the spirit not great explanation of
[56:08] Mighty gifted preachers or teachers am
[56:11] that's right that's right when they hear
[56:13] somebody preaching a teacher will come
[56:15] and said you know preaching does convict
[56:17] The Sinner but teaching this
[56:19] positionally place the man so the
[56:22] position he place the people last 50
[56:23] years
[56:25] if the teachers are right in that
[56:27] context then the people have been nailed
[56:30] into position for that's why they can't
[56:34] move that's why they can't praise that's
[56:36] why they can't get a breakthrough
[56:38] because they get nailed by teachers nail
[56:41] them down they know everything but they
[56:43] can't worship God God is the object of
[56:45] worship what God you talking about how
[56:47] you can be serving God and can't
[56:51] worship we don't emphasize worship
[56:54] enough
[56:56] I am not talking worship because I have
[56:57] nothing to preach I'm talking worship
[56:59] because you need to do
[57:04] that I'm not here to pray worship

[1:23:58] both Heaven and Earth you may be seated
[1:24:00] is now contaminated with Devils that can
[1:24:03] accuse us before God Jesus is there to
[1:24:08] intercede for us while the accuser keep
[1:24:11] pointing a finger they did this they did
[1:24:14] this they did this but the blood still
[1:24:18] covers he came to redeem that elected
[1:24:21] that he foresaw
[1:24:23] that is why he said it's so filthy today
[1:24:26] now watch here's a human heart and he
[1:24:28] draw a heart inside of it there's a
[1:24:31] snake watch that is what makes the sin
[1:24:35] the life this one over here has a dant
[1:24:37] so two hearts which is the holy spirit
[1:24:39] that has aive he has malice the one with
[1:24:42] snake have malice hatred Envy that's
[1:24:44] what causing it is that fellow inside a
[1:24:46] deer that snake in the heart is inside a
[1:24:49] there now when you are asked to forgive
[1:24:51] you of your
[1:24:52] sins that has been forgiven and taken
[1:24:56] away but the thing that caused it is
[1:24:58] still there yeah so God forgive you for
[1:24:59] L stealing robbing whatever God forgive
[1:25:02] you but the snake is still there that's
[1:25:06] justification God forgive you but the
[1:25:08] thing that caus you to do it is still
[1:25:09] there then come sanctification watch
[1:25:13] sets our mind in order of Holiness to
[1:25:15] think right signification is a compound
[1:25:17] Greek word which means to cleanse and
[1:25:20] set aside for service the next comes the
[1:25:24] baptism of fire and the holy ghost that
[1:25:28] God might dwell in us and the fire of
[1:25:32] God here we go cleanses our hearts from
[1:25:36] sin Hallelujah and puts the Holy Ghost
[1:25:40] Inside then we bring forth the same life
[1:25:44] that they did back there Hallelujah
[1:25:46] notice he didn't say teachings he didn't
[1:25:49] say Mysteries he didn't say the letter
[1:25:51] of the word he said the fire of God
[1:25:55] cleanses our hearts from sin Hallelujah
[1:25:59] isn't that right a man can repent of his
[1:26:02] sins and maybe he's an immoral man every
[1:26:04] immoral looking woman he finds it's
[1:26:05] still there maybe he's a drunker every
[1:26:07] time he smells a drink it is still there
[1:26:09] when he gets Sanctified it cleanses that
[1:26:12] desire out of him Hallelujah it takes
[1:26:15] the want of it away he can still be
[1:26:18] tempted yes but it takes the want of it
[1:26:22] away but when he is
[1:26:26] baptized with the Holy Ghost and Fire
[1:26:29] and hear the word cleansed burnt out
[1:26:32] cleaned up and then put into service of
[1:26:36] God because signification means set
[1:26:41] aside for service but the Holy Ghost
[1:26:44] puts us in service in service
[1:26:48] Hallelujah excuse me so look how
[1:26:51] striking he takes the a place where you
[1:26:53] had to dwell in through the same process
[1:26:54] he is called The Church who
[1:26:55] justification called The Church who
[1:26:57] sanctification then filled with the Holy
[1:26:59] Ghost and Fire he took it to a process
[1:27:01] that he himself the Holy Spirit himself
[1:27:03] the Son of God can dwell in it amen now
[1:27:09] watch a mystery what people did not know
[1:27:14] no day with water God judged the Earth
[1:27:17] by water and so on flood and so on it
[1:27:19] wasn't just that he was redeemed in the
[1:27:22] Earth by baptizing it in
[1:27:27] water so the mystery behind
[1:27:30] noah8 year old prophecy and the Ark and
[1:27:34] the flood was God saying I am taking
[1:27:38] back what is
[1:27:41] mine I am going to

[1:36:31] garments you know that's the priest
[1:36:33] coming there's no ifs there's no butts
[1:36:35] but his real we walk his special sandals
[1:36:39] with the gold trimming and his shoes tip
[1:36:43] that's the priest he's coming highly
[1:36:47] respected let's hear about
[1:36:49] him we find his bottom part here his
[1:36:53] back life behind him his predestination
[1:36:56] is
[1:36:58] [Music]
[1:37:04] sinful now look at this Blackboard here
[1:37:07] he represent Purity he was a priest he
[1:37:10] was an honorable man he said he had to
[1:37:12] be a good man or he couldn't be a priest
[1:37:14] you don't put bad men as
[1:37:16] priest you Mafia as priest Gangsta as
[1:37:20] priest to be at least a good man to be
[1:37:23] in the
[1:37:25] priesthood watch but you see he got it
[1:37:28] by intellectual learning that's the
[1:37:30] priest so he has no divine revelation he
[1:37:33] went and study in the priesthood he knew
[1:37:35] how to be a priest how to sprinkle the
[1:37:37] thing light the candle do the altar how
[1:37:39] to bless people and so on and that's the
[1:37:41] ritual he's a priest look at the woman
[1:37:45] woman at the well come onl her first
[1:37:49] life she was a prostitute she was all

[1:38:06] the priest with his intellectual
[1:38:09] learning said it's a devil so the priest

[1:38:15] his denomination called it today is what
[1:38:17] the group say individuals in the group
[1:38:19] have no revelation they have a group
[1:38:21] Revelation soever they Pastor pedal in

[1:38:29] collective life as dictated and pregated
[1:38:33] by the pastor who is not a good shepherd

[1:38:41] the people the Good Shepherd just put
[1:38:43] the Holy Ghost on the people the word

[2:02:11] of Prophecy testimony of Jesus The
[2:02:14] Living Word the word coming you word by
[2:02:15] word by word but now the spirit the Lord
[2:02:19] of the spirit the law of the spirit is

[2:02:24] transform that word in your life into
[2:02:27] Spirit into Power this is what the devil
[2:02:30] was not catering for he thought we going
[2:02:32] to be batted and bruised just between a
[2:02:34] long hard word battle but it's not so
[2:02:37] there's an appointed time I will return
[2:02:39] unto thee according to the time of life
[2:02:42] and you're going to have that son that's
[2:02:44] not talk now that's not 25 years saying
[2:02:47] I'm going to have Isaac no no no this is
[2:02:48] the time of life now there's a time to
[2:02:50] produce something oh glory to God when
[2:02:53] that egg hit that sperm that was a
[2:02:55] conception Isaac was on his way it had
[2:02:57] N9 months to him to come forth but he
[2:02:58] was on his way oh we have a right to
[2:03:01] Rejoice because I feel that egg hit that
[2:03:03] SPM is it has a matter of time now for
[2:03:06] that baby to come forth Oh Glory to God
[2:03:09] are you with me now hallelujah
[2:03:12] hallelujah glory to God glory to God
[2:03:16] hallelujah hallelujah Glory Glory so
[2:03:19] when a man is Born Again from
[2:03:21] Heaven back up a little bit he talking
[2:03:23] about a woman a baby don't care how
[2:03:25] cruel she is she gets really kind what
[2:03:28] happened there's a body what this body
[2:03:31] now is not alive yet the only thing is
[2:03:33] flesh and muscles bumping and when the
[2:03:36] baby come out of the womb God breathes
[2:03:37] the breath of life into it and then it
[2:03:39] screams out so the natural body is
[2:03:42] formed and outside the womb there's a
[2:03:44] spirit life to hit that body yes sir and
[2:03:46] then you have a baby alive
[2:03:49] well reverse is also true we are Spirit
[2:03:52] babes in Christ and outside of us have
[2:03:55] that body that if this body fall down we
[2:03:58] have a body to go into isn't that right
[2:04:01] so here he's bringing it now when a man
[2:04:02] is Born Again from Heaven he become a
[2:04:04] spirit baby in Christ and when this robe
[2:04:06] of flesh is dropped this there's a
[2:04:08] natural body theophany a body not made
[2:04:10] with hands neither born of woman that we
[2:04:12] go into and then that body returns back
[2:04:16] and picks up the glorified body h that's
[2:04:19] the reason Jesus went to hell when he
[2:04:20] died and preach of souls in prison he
[2:04:22] turned back into theophany and if
[2:04:26] Corinthians 51 if this Earthly body be
[2:04:29] dissolved this Earthly Tabernacle we
[2:04:32] have another one we have bass that to
[2:04:35] come straight from God the attribute to
[2:04:37] be flesh to be tempted and tested by sin
[2:04:41] uhhuh so you bypass the attribute of God
[2:04:43] to be what tested and temped my sin like
[2:04:46] Adam did but when testing of his word is
[2:04:50] over when we are taken up into this body
[2:04:54] that was prepared for us before the
[2:04:55] foundation of the world it is the word
[2:04:58] there that we skipped to come right down
[2:05:01] to be tempted and tested and if we come
[2:05:04] through that there have been no
[2:05:05] temptation we would know all things the
[2:05:08] reason Jesus know all things he was word
[2:05:11] because before he was flesh that's right
[2:05:14] and then we become the word hallelujah
[2:05:18] and here we are to be formed to the word
[2:05:20] image to be a partaker of the word to
[2:05:23] feed on the word and being predestinated
[2:05:26] since the beginning you see that little
[2:05:27] spark of life that you had in you from
[2:05:29] the beginning when you started your
[2:05:31] journey many of you can remember it you
[2:05:33] joined Church you tried this nothing
[2:05:35] satisfied but one day you just recognize
[2:05:37] it then after you recognize the very
[2:05:39] word of God was Eagle food then you left
[2:05:41] the other thing you have been formed
[2:05:43] into the living image of the Living Word
[2:05:45] you heard from your theophany if this
[2:05:47] Earthly body beli
[2:05:49] we have one
[2:05:50] waiting when Moses seen him he seen him
[2:05:53] in a theophany when Abraham saw him he
[2:05:55] saw his name he saw he call him Elohim
[2:05:57] isn't that right he was in a theophany
[2:05:59] form notice therefore the theophany here
[2:06:03] we
[2:06:05] go are you ready everybody alive right
[2:06:08] now therefore if you have
[2:06:13] died and entered into that theophany
[2:06:16] what happens something he's revealing

[2:07:49] but the real Redemption is those that
[2:07:51] are predestinated because the very word
