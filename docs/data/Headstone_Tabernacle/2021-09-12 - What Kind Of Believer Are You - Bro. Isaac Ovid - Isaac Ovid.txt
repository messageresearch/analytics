privilege and an honor to be back in the house of the lord this morning you are grateful to the lord this morning amen amen you can keep playing soft leaders let's pray our gracious heavenly father we thank you this morning that we could have the opportunity to gather the last time we were able to do this was on april the 18th it's been a while that we have been able to come together lord as your word commands us to do lord is said to forsake not the assembling and this whole evolution of this world and the situation of this world have blindsided so many different things but we are grateful this morning to be here lord for those that could make it out and for those that are connected on the internet lord we are so grateful for this moment lord as we see the clock that times this world and how long it will exist is counting down to close a completion man cannot stop it governments cannot stop it nobody could stop it because god has ordered it to be this way but lord we have broken out of our comfort zone as it were lord to come and put you in your place in our lives you told us in your word to seek you first above everything else lord and everything else will fall in its place lord has been so easy over time for people to lose sight of what's important so we thank you this morning that lord we can gather one more time lord and we don't know what will unfold in the next few months or how long we are here but for the moment we have together we are so grateful so may you bless your people may your anointing even the shekinah glory the august presence will fall upon your people both here and those that are in their homes lord may you prick our hearts as it were lord may you stir our hearts lord in a new way father we commit the service into your hands and the reading of the word in the precious theme of jesus christ and the church says amen and amen so i'd like to welcome you as you know we are on a restricted time so all protocols and formalities observed uh we do have another praise i want to address this before i get in uh from sister rajkumar she called this morning she would have put in a request or prayer request i believe it was true but ovid to three of her sisters in law who had come down with a virus and she's thanking god for answering prayer two of them are 90 percent recovered and one is 80 recovered so she wants to thank god so we really want to praise god for that in addition we do want to remember the knights family in prayer uh in a special way i think most of you were in the zoom meeting and certainly the services there on the channel so you could see it if you missed it and we do have uh an announcement with respect to the funeral arrangements as of this moment what we do know is that the service will be held here at the tabernacle this coming thursday at 1 pm further details will follow so may the lord reach you bless you so i'd like to go straight to the wood this morning for a short time in the present a short quick message amen so reading from saint john 6 and reading from verse 53 seen john 6 and reading from verse 53. thank you brother anthony thank you musicians i want to keep track of time then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood ye have no life in you who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drink it my blood dwelleth in me and i in him as the living father hath sent me and i live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat manna and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live forever these things said he in the synagogue as he taught in capernaum many therefore of his disciples when they had heard this said this is a hard saying who can hear it when jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto them doug this offend you what and if you shall see the son of man ascend up where he was before it is the spirit that quicken it the flesh profited nothing the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life but there are some of you that believe not for jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believe not and who should betray him and he said therefore said i unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him then said jesus unto the twelve will he also go away then peter answered him lord to whom shall we go thou has the words of eternal life and we believe and are sure that thou art that christ the son of the living god jesus answered them have i not chosen you twelve and one of you is a devil he spake of julius iscariot the son of simon for he it was that should betray him being one of the twelve may the lord at a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning amen it's such a great privilege to be able to speak to somebody in the church is really really wonderful amen so i have a title this morning and the title is a question a burden on my heart what kind of believer are you it's a question this morning what kind of believer are you with a subject separating the word bride from the church members and an inspiration only the elect have the ability to hear from god what kind of believer are you and we know it that brother branham many times he would mention that there are three kinds of believers and it was in november on november 24 1963 he decided to actually preach on it and in his comments before he started to preach on it he mentioned i've said it so many times but i decided to actually take time to preach on this subject of three kinds of believers he said the first is believers make believers and unbelievers he said no that is quite a subject but as sure as we sit here tonight and i say as so as we sit here today that group is always gathered together now this is a shaking statement to make because it means as little as we may be today because of the pandemic there are three kinds of believers in the room this morning if you believe the scripture and you believe the word of god it is impossible for you to assume or believe that everyone that sits in a church are true believers because that's not what the bible teaches it's not what the prophet teaches in every church there's no exception to this statement but there branham said in every church there are three kinds of believers i don't care how clear the teacher is i don't care how powerful the preaching is i don't care how much time you spend in the world in every kind of church there are three kinds of believers what kind of believer are you hallelujah can the church say amen i was saying but over a few minutes ago i said this was in jesus's church jesus had three kinds of believers in his church there is no way i could preach like jesus there's no way i could teach like jesus i can't explain like jesus i can't go into your heart the way jesus did but in jesus church there were three kinds of believers so we are not kidding around this morning with knowing that there are three kinds of believers the mission this morning is to shake a believer who is an unbeliever in the church into position the mission this morning is to shake a make believer who is supposed to be a true believer back into their position oh blessed be the name of the lord i know i want to make a distinction we're not going to be here too long but this is a burden on my heart three kinds of believers in the church true believers make believers and unbelievers the unbelievers that brother branham is speaking about is not the worldly unbeliever let's be clear on this now this is an unbeliever who comes to church this is an unbeliever who worships this is the unbeliever who goes to prayer meetings this is the unbeliever who has spoken word books this is an unbeliever who says amen but deep down in their heart they don't really believe somebody helped me this morning in the church three kinds of believers oh when i saw this it started to shake me a little bit because i want to be sure who am i i want to be sure i'm the right kind of believer because in the church there are three kinds of believers this has nothing to do with how long you're in the message it has nothing to do with believing because it's believers but it's quality of believers it's the caliber of the believers it's the characteristics of the believers anybody help me this morning whether madame said and i want to lay it here but i'm saying this is 1963 in november of 1963 he said wherever the people gather we find this group so he said wherever there's a gathering whether it's a convention whether it's a meeting whether it's a zoom room whether it's a prayer meeting well i don't care where is this once people gather together you're gonna find three kinds of people in there oh can the church say amen oh hallelujah he said wherever the people gather we find this group and always have found them and we probably always will have them until the coming of the lord so according to this he said until the coming of the lord so people will be walking together until there come a road that they cannot pass people will walk together until they meet your spot that all the colors will have to show who you really are if you really a true believer or if you're just a make-believer or if you're really an unbeliever oh come on now somebody help me this morning the kind of believer you are determines the kind of man you are the kind of believer you are determines the kind of woman you are the kind of believer you are determines the kind of father you are the kind of believer you are determines the kind of mother you are the kind of believer you are determines the kind of son you are the kind of believer you are determines the kind of husband you are the kind of believer you are determines the kind of wife you are the kind of believer you are determines the kind of deacon you are yes a deacon could be a make-believer yes a deacon could be an unbeliever and yes a deacon could be a true believer somebody preached back to me what kind of believer are you hallelujah it's a deep question it's not how long you're in the message it's not have you connected to all the services it's that how many books you read or what you understand what kind of believer are you brother branham said here i'm in the same court and we probably always will have them until the coming of the lord and i want us tonight to picture ourselves as i speak of these three groups and see what group that we are in so when were ibrahimos preaching this it was to shake the people so that they could see what group you're really in i said it on friday night i said it when i spoke at brother monda's house i said when a loved one a brother passes on it's a snap it's a reminder of the reality because we make plans for tomorrow we have things we want to do we have all these things that we think we have control over and then god puts the line that we cannot pass and then we have to give an answer we have to give a count at that point there's no room to change there's no room to make things right there's no room to say what should have been said or so i prefer to ask today while you have the time to fix things what kind of believer are you i have a burden i have nose but i want to speak to you a little bit i'm troubled friends i was saying about over this pandemic has been a a filtering no prefect no police over your shoulder nobody watching how you're living in your home and if you're connecting to this service and if you're praying every day and and how you're living your life and how you're talking to your husband and talking to your wife and dealing with your co-workers and are you really a christian it's just you and the tutor now and you can fool the tutor what kind of believer are you your behavior your attitude your words your actions makes it very clear to god what you are the challenge is many of us we deceive ourselves that's bible deceive ourselves i said about over i said so many people feel that just being in the message is enough it's true you know i believe i believe so you don't think those who were jesus were believers but when they came to a crossroad and jesus said something to them they could not understand they started the murmur murmuring is me talking about saying hey are you ready with this i'm not sure you know already not i don't know it's hard scene but i don't know if i could ready i'm not sure already and before you know it 70 the majority of jesus's church left the church 70 walked away they were the unbelievers in the church they believed up to a point they would have stayed in the church had jesus not said what he said anybody with me had jesus not confronted them with a higher truth that they did not yet understand they would have still been there saying come on preacher come on jesus say it jesus but the opening of the truth revealed what was really in them hallelujah when they were called to a higher level suddenly they felt the water that they were in was too much water to swim and they had to get out of water and in this whole season that we're living in i'm hearing there young people who don't connect to the services you don't have to travel to church during the pandemic you had to spend no money to come to service uh anybody with me this morning how do you explain that not to me you don't owe me an explanation you owe god an explanation and you tell me you are a believer what kind of believer are you anybody with me this morning not just young people all kinds of calabs all people young people i came this morning to hit the reset button because jesus wasn't playing games his ministry changed and he wasn't he wasn't playing around no he said listen listen i hear all your talking i hear oh you're talking and he said you wrestle who here you better be sure you want to be here you know he said will you go also he wasn't trying to beg them or persuade them he said listen if you want to go also you're free to go also but there's truth that i'm preaching is to take you to where you need to oh you don't hear me this morning you is there anybody in the house this morning so i'm not here to take prisoners this morning i'm here to knock the devil out i'm here to destroy the works of darkness and went on an assignment because the devil has not been playing games he's been infiltrating homes infiltrating lives oh you don't hear me this morning i'm not going to be too much longer hallelujah but if it's one thing we want to do tonight one thing we want to do today is shake you back into a realization that it's that that listen listen i have a job to do brother over there's a job to do and you have a job to do the ministers the ls we have a job to do i want you to sleep tonight by the grace of god knowing i said what the lord told me to say let the chips fall away lie i want to be able to stand like jesus and say if you want to go you could go if you want to serve god you could serve god you want to go and play the fool with the world that's your choice if you want to leave with your limited belief and your limited understanding and do what you want to do i'm not even going to try to stop you you do that we have come too far to turn back now we are moving to a season where true believers born sons filled sons inspired sons want to go all the way to adoption all the way to perfection and nothing is going to move me nothing's going to shake me hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah now let's go a little deeper for a few minutes brother branham said a believer i'm reading from the message three kinds of believers just one message but amanda preached on this topic three kinds of believers you should study it this week in fact that's your homework that's your homework i'm officially brought over is that all right that is your home but over just co-signed it listen to the tips three kinds of believers true believers in the church it's hard to really conceptualize you know because you would think people who come in the church are all true believers make believers in the church what are the make believers in fact let me start from the but rebellion started and i'm going to get it in a second on the believer's side i want to i want to go to the unbeliever then come back to the believer and then take it from there the unbeliever is the one who come into church and they believe you know but they just don't believe everything that's how bitter branham brought it out they don't believe everything they believe a lot of stuff they believe a lot but not everything they are believers but they have some unbelief they are believers but they just can't see something the way you would see it so the world has certain requirements let me bring it context you want to the home and the family wives who reverence your husband you know that's an instruction right that's not a debate that's not a suggestion that's not a recommendation is that uh oh you hear me this morning so so so the the believers when the holy ghost move in see them but in their house no reference for their husband because they don't believe their husband is deserving of reverence and the scripture didn't qualify whether your husband is deserving a reference or not that's a reference to your husband and right there unbelief inside the heart can we can we dig down a little bit can we perform surgery a little bit so the unbeliever have an issue with it because they really don't believe they should be reversing their husband the make believer they understand it you know they believe this was a revenue husband you know but no it's not a genuine reverence this is where is the oscars is the one for the acton the oscars this is where the the acting starts up because he the make-believer could perform the make-believer they're not openly saying i don't believe it they believe it but it's a kind of put-on thing they they're slipping in the cracks they're serving the food nice you know but behind that food is oh god this man is not easy i'm trying to use simple examples features in the heart because behind this what god is looking at his heart do you truly believe my word my instruction or are you make believing this piece you're kind of you're believing that they're putting on a show for me to think you believe it because i can really see what's going on in your heart or do you not believe it i'm your in church [Music] honor your father and mother the true believer accepts that you don't qualify that god blessed you as a christian this is it's a perplexing to me i'm hoping this helps you and you will understand what god is looking at the lord open your eyes to this great message as a believer how could you dis disrespect your unbelieving father wouldn't it be that the revelation that god give you make you so magnanimous so generous so giving that you can overlook the falls of your father when they're especially when they're not able you could overlook that because god overlooked your false is it and suddenly you are so spiritual that you have the right to now disrespect your mother and your father because they're not in church what kind how do you think god looking at that kind of believer when you they are lifting your hands thank you and god saying but look at you you just talk to your father so disrespectful how could i bless that i wanted to be in a home it must be in your life remember this gospel is not our letter things that are working inside the conference it's a life change that people must know they must take note that you have been with jesus i don't know if it's just helping anybody have somebody the virtue of this age is forgiveness broadly kindness the true believers could forgive the unbeliever in the church they're not sure they really don't know if they should forgive for this thing i'm not sure because i feel i want them to feel the brunt of what they did to me they need to suffer a little bit i could forgive them in time but but you're you're already a believer you're in church you know by your unbelieving church because you believe in a true believer would drop it right away how many times 70 times seven you just forgiven you're forgiven you're forgiven and if you can't do it for yourself for christ's sake you're just forgiven because that's a true believer the unbeliever in church but i remember when brother so-and-so put me on that seat boy and i didn't really like it up to no we can't shake your hand because of that is that true believer the make-believer is different the make-believer knows that this thing is intruder but they ride in with it everybody drop odds drop oats drop oats close your eyes go to your neighbor and drop oats and people will walk to you and say i forgive you the unbeliever can't come up to you and tell you that the unbeliever will sit there in church and say and go if you you have experiences go to somebody offended and make it right the unbeliever can't even reach that point to go make it right but the make believer now could come up to you and say brother anthony please forgive me i'm so sorry but in the heart by the currents watch now the gun still locked and loaded it is forgiveness with a loaded gun please i forgive you already not holding it against you but the gun under the jacket if you slip up again it's just bullets in the church listen it's not that they don't know forgiveness is requirement you know but the condition of the heart and you can't see it because it's not visible it's it's locked up envy and jealousy and the acting god bless you and behind it brother branham said it bothered him he said he used to go and haunt to get away from the people because they were saying things to him and he was seeing the spirit behind them now you may not have the prophetic eye to be able to see the spirit of somebody talking to you but rest assured from this teaching there are three kinds of believers and we have no control over what's the kind of believer somebody else is but for me i have to know what kind of believer am i and you have to know what kind of believer are you with i hope this helps somebody this morning mr branham said a believer doesn't have to be a smart person he doesn't have to be an educated person but obama wasn't educated i remember the banner was teaching this he was speaking about peter showing that peter in fact brother branham said this man had made this statement the bible itself said he was both ignorant and unlearned peter he was not a really considered an intelligent person i'm quoting the prophet but peter was a believer who could have explained at the time when jesus said to them except you eat my flesh and drink my blood who could have explained what jesus was really talking about not one of them had a clue but they believed can the church say amen so i trust this is helping you this morning to look at yourself a little way and your attitude towards the word of god and to understand is why the prophet would say full obedience to the entire word of god is what entitles you to the token said differently only to true believers because the only true believers could go into full obedience because they believe all of the word it's it's not it's not a buffet and you're taking what you want i only feel i want this this morning uh ready to come to church not already get this one already come to already jump and be any presence and i'm happy we back out but oh gosh yeah but eyes are coming and coming i come for that hallelujah believers make believers unbelievers three kinds of believers what kind of believer are you i don't want to touch a few things but ibrahim said noah you know what he was a true believer and you know what this thing about true believers many times what they believe don't make sense you know and that is why i realize more and more it is the grace of god to us to see it and you have to protect the seed of god in your soul noah went home and google if this thing could really rain and every report he gets anything can happen the fellas who were studying meteorology and the meteorologist that he did say this rain thing can happen no as a madman message no one that's making sense nowhere crazy how noah could say go and reign we have no evidence we have no data we look back in all the records empirical evidence suggests that noah is a madman but when god speaks to your heart you don't care if they call you a madman you don't care what anybody else says you don't care what or you don't hear me this morning it's revealed to you not from me not from the preacher but from god himself and noah if you call it a madman noah crazy noah no evidence noah listen i want you to understand this this is not like saying this person was healed and i could get healed too this is not saying this person was delivered and i get to get delivered too god gave noah a task to build a boat for something that never happened before and god gave this bride a task to make a church to make a revival to do what no other church ever did before so call me crazy if i dare to believe that we could do the impossible call me crazy if i have faith to believe that missing limbs in my day will be restored call me crazy if i dare to believe that we can make a revival [Applause] you may be seated nothing could move me nothing could shape me nothing could deter me me listen my faith and confidence is not in man no no my faith and confidence rest in the lord jesus christ because he is the perfect he's the perfect one i'm not leaning on my understanding i'm negan any man and paul who was the gold standard cleared up us for me that was my liberation then paul said follow me as i follow christ in other words i'm going to teach you like by the night set to the best i can follow me as i go down this road as you follow christ if you see me deviate keep following christ you see me move keep following christ you see this brother falls away keep following christ you don't understand something keep following christ can the church say man so noah he was a true believer friends quite honestly it is easier to believe now than before you know because we are not being challenged to believe what never took place in a real sense we saw elijah caught up in a chariot of fire oh come on now we see oh you you don't hear me this morning you saw enoch walking and one day oh his foot connected with the king's highway and enoch you couldn't find him no more so it is not like nobody ever did this before and one day i'm looking for the current so when i'll walk and my foot will connect with the king's highway and they're not going to see me no more because i'll be caught up in the rapture yes i believe there's going to be a rapture yes i believe that is what the true believers believe oh hallelujah that we are going to be changed that is mortal will put on immortality and no weapon formed against you is going to prosper i am a believer and i believe there are true believers this morning who believe your family is going to be delivered i don't care where they are this morning i don't care what they're doing this morning i don't care what condition they are in the god we serve is more than able to deliver them to break the chains to break the power of satan and who the son of man set free is free indeed there's no power present past to come that could stop the anointed sons of god from being oh come on now somebody help me somebody give god a shout out praise oh let's remind the devil whose side we are on let's remind the devil that we believe yes i believe i believe in miracles i believe in the outpouring of the holy ghost i believe seven thunders give faith i believe god sent a prophet to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers [Music] you may be seated and you know what listen you know the crazy crazy crazy thing is the bible said that even the devil believes and the devil tremble him and people walking around church with a half a belief and a quarter belief and the devil knows that there's a power that he can't challenge the devil knows that when he met jesus dear in the wilderness he was no match with jesus the devil knows that if god ever gets his hand up on somebody that man becomes invincible the devil knows oh somebody help me this morning or sickness is being challenged this morning by the truth of who we are of who god is and what you are called to do and the devil cannot stop it the devil cannot change it hallelujah give the lord a shout out praise somebody oh hallelujah in your homes wherever you are this morning give the lord a shout out praise [Music] hallelujah hallelujah noah a true believer david a true believer belief has nothing to do with your ability to believe brother mikey has nothing to do with your ability because when david came to meet his brothers hallelujah they were all in the same church because at that day the church was the tribes as that church at that day the church was the sons of israel so they were all in the church but when david got there all he met was make believers and unbelievers the whole army didn't have one believer oh come on now somebody help me this morning not one person believed so it's only when david arrived the church was really complete because in every church you have to have three kinds of believers so when david got there no they could have church oh come on help me somebody kiss saul he make believer he said work on a shield now he put he had to put he had to do a performance prepare ammo for me so at least when i'm going out there i go look good make believer you know and don't forget them so there's them fellas any barracks their training and his unbelief i don't have the gun go work i do never saw it sharp all the training they took nobody want to challenge goliath but when david came and completed the church now three kinds of believers though they're having a conversation and david as he was about to leave he hear the challenge send me a man to fight me and david say wait a minute are we having church this morning are we having church this morning who is this uncircumcised phillies time that dare defy the army of the living god can we have church this morning somehow david knew that one could put a thousand to flight two could put ten thousand to flight david asks who is he i want his name i want to know how to address him i want to know his pedigree i want to know where he come from because every demon has a name and i want to fight in a vacuum i don't want to shoot an under normal target i want to know what i'm going after and his belief as a true believer was based on his experience with god when nobody else was there in the pandemic when nobody else was there he was faithful he was diligent he still had his own prayer meeting he's still connected to the service he still made it his business to do what god required of him anybody in the house this morning i'm trying to find a place to one day we're gonna not have to have a time limit but eclipse we're gonna fellowship on the other side when we let me meet up with nobody again now we see novi you remember we're talking about this thing couldn't know this thing could this thing could we had to get ready so that we could come and connect back with you because this bride has got to come to perfection if i cannot believe that i might as well pack up now if i can't believe this i had a better pack up now but i have to believe sister kangali that this church has to come to perfection to bring on the resurrection i have to believe that there are some true davids there are some true believers who despite the opposition who despite what the devil says who despite what the world says who despite the pressures in life could still say our god is more than able the god who delivered me from the lion the god that delivered me from the bear the god that delivered me from this pandemic the lord that delivered me that kept food on my table i may have lost my job but it was the lord who made a way he made a way i may have had a loss in income but god made it away i may have struggled during the pandemic but god made a way and if he made away from me he could keep on doing it because i'm his child and i'm a true believer i don't want to believe some things and be an unbeliever i don't want to pretend i'm a believer i want to go all the way and be a true believer come to church amen hallelujah my my the musician could begin to get ready we're not finished yet almost but you can begin to get ready short quick message i remember years ago one of my brothers i wouldn't name which one said what happened to these short picked messages to shake the whole nation he said services will be long sometimes that's it brother today is one of them short quick messages hallelujah but that's what i promised you know because this gospel is nothing word only this is our preparation to leave this place this preaching that we in now is a means to an end no no the end is you go into your family and say get off that sick bed oh that is the end the end is you go into your loved one and saying demon let her go come come come short quick message because his gospel is not in word only but it's in power and demonstration and only the true believers can be the ones who will demonstrate it somebody say amen oh hallelujah in the same message three kinds of believers but ibrahim said here i just want to drop this in so late here he said that ought to be the achievement of every believer this afternoon god is able to keep every word that he said he would do i don't care what the denomination says they say the days of miracles has passed and all this telepathy and all its fortune telling it doesn't matter to me what they say i still believe if that gun is zero to the target it will hit the target and i believe if a believer is zeroed with the word of god you see that's a problem people's zeroing on all other things except the word of god what this wasn't saying what this person say how it was explain explained but look at the condition this is the believer if that gun is zeroed in to the target it'll hit the target and i believe if a believer is zeroed with the word of god it'll hit the same thing if the word of god ever promised it it'll do it again i'm fully persuaded of that that when we see we're in this age when it's supposed to be here it's supposed to be here these things are supposed to take place that's the reason but randomly said i do believe that when the bride is called out and elected and set in the book of life there will come a sound from heaven that will take such a baptism of the holy spirit into that pride that will take her from the earth in a rapture in grace tell me who else preaches like this except this prophet god promised it don't care how much science and how much astronauts they signed up on everything else how many million miles they can see i don't care nothing about it there is a heaven and there is a literal jesus christ there that will come in a body form to receive his church to himself no matter listen to this no matter how old the story seems it's still the truth god said so that's what believers believe are there any believers this morning we believe that [Applause] final few quotes i'm not going to be the finishers today but by the grace of god we will but ivan am i talking about joe being a believer but it's a court that he he wrote here in the same message that that i really blessed me he's speaking about joseph you could begin to play something softly joseph another believer he couldn't help being what he was friends that's powerful couldn't help being what he was and i love god so much because every time i fall and get back up it's not just me getting back up you know it's because i can't help being what i am because a true believer is not that you wouldn't slip but a true believer always finds a way by the eclipse to get back up again but the man said he was a prophet god made him a prophet and god made you a son god made you a daughter and don't let the devil rob you of that you are not being shaped into it in that kind of sense god made you that way you've been hold but it's now god now now saying let me see if if no god made him that way listen to the prophet speaking about joseph he didn't want to be different from his brothers but he was different you didn't want to be different from your family but you are different you didn't choose this walk this walk chose you now what kind of believer are you as you respond to this call listen to the prophet god made him what he is and listen nobody else could take his place oh i was listening to the prophet seeing this this morning i was driving up us listening to the tape and he was speaking to me nobody could take my place nobody could take my place and nobody could take your place god wrote your name not as a formality he wrote your name and blood out of love out of his heart out of a desire to be able to reconcile you back to himself nobody else could take his place and the prophet said that now nobody can take your place no matter how little you say i'm just a housewife nobody can take your place god in his great economy has so set so the body of christ in order till there is no one can take your place so i challenge you this morning church as i close out this first message as we come back into the house of god don't you lose your place there's nobody else to take your place god called you he predestinated you and he will fill you with a wonderful glorious baptism of the holy ghost all the way to adoption [Music] friends i don't know how you've been living but this morning you could change the way the question is
