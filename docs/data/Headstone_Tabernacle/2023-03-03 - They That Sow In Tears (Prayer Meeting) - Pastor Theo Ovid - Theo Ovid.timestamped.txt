[14:21] tonight
[14:22] um it's always a privilege that we get
[14:24] together and call upon the name of the
[14:26] Lord
[14:27] so even your bibles are likely to turn
[14:28] into two portion Scriptures it clears
[14:30] fees chapter 11. I want to read verse
[14:33] 46. and we want to read psalms 126.
[14:37] that's talking about six verses they're
[14:39] not from 126 Ecclesiastes
[14:43] chapter 11
[14:45] reading from verse 4. just everybody is
[14:48] fine tonight based on the water
[14:51] okay let's go he'd have observed to win
[14:54] Charlotte soon
[14:56] and he have regarded the clothes shot
[14:59] like me
[15:00] I don't know it's not what is the way of
[15:04] the spirit
[15:05] nor
[15:07] how the bones do grow in the womb of her
[15:09] that is the child
[15:11] even so don't know it's not the works of
[15:15] God who make it over
[15:17] in the morning should I see it
[15:19] in the evening with who will not die in
[15:22] hand
[15:23] for thou knowest not whether shall
[15:27] prosper either this
[15:29] or that or whether they both shall be
[15:32] alike good
[15:34] Psalms 126.
[15:39] when the Lord turned against the
[15:42] Captivity of Zion
[15:45] we were like them that dream
[15:47] then was our mouth
[15:49] filled with laughter
[15:51] and our tongue with singing
[15:54] density among the Heathen the Lord and
[15:57] done great things for them
[16:00] the Lord had done great things for us
[16:03] where else we are glad
[16:06] then again our captivity oh Lord as the
[16:08] strings in the south
[16:11] tears shall reap enjoy
[16:14] he'd have great Fortune report
[16:17] bearing pressure seed
[16:19] shall doubt us come again with rejoice
[16:21] in bring her she's with him may God
[16:24] bless his word let's pray one more time
[16:25] father we thank you for the scriptures
[16:28] tonight and I I pray God that you were
[16:31] to bring the right anointing the right
[16:34] inspiration the right words to your
[16:35] people tonight and open up from them a
[16:38] Channel of Prayer by Your Word in Jesus
[16:41] amen God bless you
[16:44] title of this thought I want to share
[16:46] with you tonight
[16:48] um it's data through tears
[16:51] this is kind of date of 20 years
[16:55] and
[16:56] but Obama was dramatizing about amram
[16:59] and his prayer now it's amazing
[17:02] that even though something is promised
[17:05] why do we still have to pray for it
[17:07] because God promised Abraham with a
[17:11] mighty hand he will deliver the people
[17:13] they will sojourned for foreign
[17:17] it is required
[17:20] that a burden of prayer comes to pray
[17:23] for that Deliverance it's almost as if
[17:26] God's pick his word
[17:28] but it takes man human it takes that
[17:31] Spirit appearance application to connect
[17:33] or activate or whatever it is as a
[17:37] channel by which God could fulfill his
[17:39] very own word so listen to this as we
[17:42] see it I'm wrong on those wearing nights
[17:46] back bleeding
[17:48] climbing up the steps again until two
[17:50] three o'clock in the morning praying it
[17:53] seems like you're just talking to the
[17:55] wind
[17:56] but dong in his Jewish heart they burn
[17:58] their feet but no Winds of doubts clever
[18:01] blood
[18:02] that's the kind of little woman we need
[18:05] to rise on the scene today
[18:07] if he doesn't answer tonight he will
[18:09] tomorrow night if he doesn't answer this
[18:11] here he will next year for he is a God
[18:14] not egot but the god
[18:17] and we see night after night as amram
[18:20] climbed his steps and juicy dead would
[18:23] come up to him and he said you have been
[18:26] up there praying all night why don't you
[18:28] just tell some of the boys where you
[18:30] were killing and let them pray your wife
[18:33] well honey what if they don't do it
[18:37] somebody's got to do it
[18:39] somebody's got to pray true so amram
[18:42] wasn't putting that burden on anybody
[18:45] else
[18:46] he'll do that himself
[18:48] that's what you got to do tonight
[18:50] that day we that's the way every
[18:53] Christian ought to feel tonight not
[18:55] waiting for somebody else but take the
[18:58] front of ourselves and go through
[19:00] if we believe in the Bible
[19:02] to be a history
[19:04] it's also a prophetic book that tells
[19:07] that the same quotas shall rise in the
[19:09] last days
[19:10] and it's time for him to come on the
[19:12] scene that's what I'm known
[19:15] that Moses have profit of London Moses
[19:17] pardon Abraham and then give him a
[19:20] promise by this court of History who
[19:22] hadn't answered a prayer in 400 years
[19:25] as far as you have a record
[19:28] but he made a promise that he would
[19:29] bring them out and it seemingly we have
[19:33] had a silent God
[19:35] for a long time
[19:37] but the hour has come where you're going
[19:40] to rise on the scene one night
[19:42] I don't remember what Creed maybe for
[19:45] seven years it is here no children agree
[19:49] for new Deliverance but just getting a
[19:51] voice one night he got right down to
[19:54] business look brother Branham dramatized
[19:56] free
[19:57] in getting down to business so he is
[20:00] seeing now that this particular night
[20:03] there was something different amram he
[20:06] pushed through he got on the business he
[20:09] said that is how we have to do it
[20:12] get right on the business
[20:14] he said God
[20:18] you promised this
[20:20] and we have looked forward to it
[20:23] we have seen the signs all year
[20:26] from the time
[20:28] it's time for you to do something about
[20:31] it
[20:32] so that's how another day while he was
[20:35] in these words deep
[20:38] concentrated prayer
[20:41] praying with all of his heart
[20:44] he looked
[20:45] handling in the corner
[20:47] he rubbed his eyes and looked again
[20:50] dear stood an angel just so drawn he
[20:53] said Deliverance is coming and you are
[20:55] going to bring a son into the world he
[20:58] is going to be the one to deliver them
[20:59] seek God
[21:01] always answers prayer doesn't he yes we
[21:04] just hold on so just think about it now
[21:07] God promised Abraham
[21:09] I mean yet
[21:10] God is listen carefully dependent
[21:14] on cameram's prayer
[21:17] in the season and time
[21:19] for the spark
[21:21] or the seed of that Deliverance to be
[21:25] activated
[21:26] so when anwam got onto business that
[21:29] night
[21:30] there was a special visitation
[21:33] in another visitation God said by you by
[21:37] your loins by your seed you are going to
[21:41] produce the deliverer and sometimes
[21:44] we tend to think that somebody else God
[21:46] going to use but
[21:49] how do you not know is you
[21:51] now
[21:52] but Abraham spoke about
[21:54] the Shekinah Glory
[21:57] and you talk about any study what can
[22:00] come into the presence of the Shekinah
[22:01] Glory
[22:02] you have got to be prepared before you
[22:05] come into the presence of it and that is
[22:07] a reference to the goddess of the throne
[22:09] so what do we learn from that
[22:11] you have to be given
[22:14] says
[22:15] to the presence of God
[22:17] anyone can read
[22:19] or listen to the word written or spoken
[22:22] but presence must be accessed you must
[22:25] get access or give access
[22:29] to the presence of God
[22:31] so regardless of the battles in your
[22:33] mind even tonight
[22:35] but the presence of God comes to the
[22:38] heart
[22:39] quickly
[22:42] but a Brandon
[22:44] and I make mention of this many times
[22:47] Israel was free from Pharaoh when they
[22:48] left Egypt
[22:49] the enemy was the system so the man says
[22:53] something when you are in the frame you
[22:55] can't see the picture
[22:57] because you are part of the problem you
[22:59] are part of the issues you are inside
[23:01] the frame and you can't see the picture
[23:03] you're supposed to say somebody outside
[23:05] could see it and speak
[23:07] so in Egypt it means then that they
[23:10] could discuss fear of the enemy and the
[23:13] enemy and that enemy was external
[23:16] they could point at it you could talk
[23:18] about it you could discuss it you could
[23:19] share it with others your enemy nicely
[23:21] your excuses why it is Justified what
[23:24] you do why you do it it'll justify in
[23:27] your mind the external enemy they were
[23:29] free from pharaoh but they were not free
[23:32] from themselves they came out of Egypt
[23:34] but Egypt didn't come out of that
[23:36] but Freedom carries responsibility
[23:39] that freedom carries accountability
[23:42] but Freedom you could learn you could
[23:44] you could
[23:45] you're free to connect somebody to
[23:47] Calvary 18 to do their own thing as if
[23:50] guys are there's nothing I guess a
[23:52] special number which is a woman eating
[23:56] is still growing you're still learning
[23:57] it's free to do what
[23:59] creature and Club key about you and
[24:02] circle your own family your own friends
[24:07] so they were free from Pharaoh but not
[24:09] from themselves I'm tearing companies
[24:12] now
[24:13] make yourself a question
[24:16] God adopted his own son gave him all the
[24:19] powers and Heavens
[24:20] he will do
[24:22] for you the same
[24:25] if you will stand here we go after you
[24:29] receive the Holy Ghost and make yourself
[24:32] a Christian
[24:33] I act like a Christian should so we're
[24:36] not born Christians we're not instant
[24:38] like instant coffee or instant whatever
[24:40] become great no you have to become God
[24:43] if you put your face in God's word
[24:46] your eyes towards heaven
[24:48] and let your parents be buggered at the
[24:50] knees that is a prayer and be relevant
[24:53] before God
[24:54] there'll be someday that God will take
[24:57] you over to one side and give you a
[25:00] power earn the gift that the whole world
[25:03] will know he's been with you
[25:07] in position
[25:09] so my brother and sister today we're
[25:11] trying to make the nominations we're
[25:13] trying to build churches we're trying to
[25:14] organize people educate them it's all in
[25:16] them until the love of God comes in
[25:19] you want to speak with tongues you want
[25:20] to clap your hands you want to jump you
[25:22] want to dance you want to lose certain
[25:23] things to make yourself a Christian you
[25:25] will never be until the love of God
[25:26] takes over in your heart that tears that
[25:29] middle out that makes you feel for your
[25:32] brother
[25:33] that make you act like a man a child of
[25:36] God about Christ in you
[25:38] the hope of glory
[25:40] until they should come to that she was a
[25:42] total failure
[25:44] always will be
[25:45] all right
[25:47] do not throw in tears
[25:49] so when seed sticks more work
[25:52] in time
[25:53] and reaping
[25:55] and I want to identify soon
[25:57] as the work that has to be done
[26:01] okay so this stone is not just like
[26:03] plantain corn or agriculture
[26:06] I'm identifying that as the work
[26:09] that has to be done
[26:11] the work that has to be done
[26:15] even when they are challenging
[26:18] painful
[26:20] distrusting issues in your life
[26:23] challenges that will bring tears to your
[26:25] eyes
[26:26] why Lord why no why me why here
[26:30] if you do not soak listen carefully
[26:33] Church
[26:34] there will be no crops
[26:36] there will be no Harvest
[26:38] who went the work that has to be done
[26:43] you can't wait until you stop crying and
[26:46] then you would soon
[26:47] the scripture is 1 4 11 4 says he not
[26:51] observed the wind shall not so
[26:53] heat up regarded the clothes shall not
[26:55] read
[26:56] so you cannot look at the external as to
[26:58] do what needs to be done
[27:01] in other words you cannot wait for the
[27:03] situation to change or the circumstances
[27:05] to change and then you will soon
[27:07] you sow because you must
[27:11] you sow because the seed was getting to
[27:13] the ground
[27:14] is through whether you are crying or not
[27:17] used to in tears
[27:19] used to Under Pressure
[27:21] used to when it is hard
[27:23] the reality is there's work to be done
[27:26] praying is work
[27:28] praying is hard
[27:30] but praying is a must
[27:32] they want to pray and not defeat
[27:35] whether you are active or not
[27:37] whether you feel or not
[27:39] whether you feel like it or not
[27:41] true when you don't feel like it
[27:44] so in tears
[27:46] the tears don't produce the crop
[27:49] the swim does
[27:51] the tears don't produce the crop
[27:55] the swin produces the crown
[27:59] when everything around you want to make
[28:01] you quit
[28:02] through anyhow
[28:03] if your heart is broken
[28:05] through anyhow
[28:07] I wanted to shake this afternoon
[28:09] Shake yourself out of depression
[28:11] frustration Seekers have over given up
[28:14] Shake yourself tonight
[28:17] to
[28:18] util
[28:20] it's different from just soil
[28:22] people in tears want to be caught up in
[28:24] the emotions God this is the problem oh
[28:27] we're going through why ritual this
[28:30] but God wants you to do something and
[28:31] with your tears
[28:32] he wants you to sow in tears sowing in
[28:36] tears is special
[28:37] because
[28:39] it is sown in Brokenness
[28:42] a heart that Weeps
[28:44] around that Mourns
[28:46] tears of repentance
[28:49] tears of sorrowful sin to repentance
[28:53] you know watch the people who make
[28:55] excuses they always blaming this one
[28:56] they never accept responsibility these
[28:59] type of people don't grow they're
[29:00] growing they're going on they're just
[29:02] getting all
[29:04] because they don't want to deal with the
[29:07] responsibility of their behavior and
[29:09] their attitude and I always say maturity
[29:11] is when you can accept responsibility
[29:13] for your actions and your attitude not
[29:15] blaming anybody but my father my mother
[29:17] my uncle my brother my sister the pastor
[29:19] the taking the Elder you have nobody to
[29:22] blame
[29:23] you have a choice
[29:26] in tears is special
[29:28] is not wrong it's almost done yet
[29:32] Isaiah 53 when the Bible talk about what
[29:35] believer report
[29:37] or to whom is the arm of the Lord
[29:38] revealed he speaks about Christ shall
[29:41] grow before you must attend the plant

[30:06] are you acquitted with Greece and we
[30:09] hear those we hid as it were or facing
[30:12] on him he was despised and we estimated
[30:14] not surely he had gone on Greece and
[30:17] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[30:20] him strictly
[30:22] spitting of God and Afflicted but he was
[30:24] wounded for our Transmissions
[30:26] he was bruised for our iniquities
[30:29] the chastisement was of all peace was
[30:31] upon him with his choice we are healed
[30:34] all real like sheep not son or
[30:38] we like sheep go on his tree we have
[30:42] turned everyone to his own way and the
[30:45] Lord
