[25:29] is it a people tonight
[25:31] [Music]
[25:33] may God bless you and thanks for coming
[25:35] and we want to go straight into the wood
[25:38] Matthew chapter 16
[25:41] I want to read from 13 to 18.
[25:43] Hebrews 11 from 1 to 6 on second Timothy
[25:48] 3 1 verse here for 16.
[25:50] reading Matthew chapter 16 and verse 13.
[25:55] when Jesus came into the coast of
[25:57] caesarea Philippi acts the disciples
[26:00] saying whom do men see are the son of
[26:02] man am
[26:04] and they said some Sita what John the
[26:06] Baptist samillas others Jeremiah is one
[26:08] of the prophets
[26:09] he says unto them but whom say he that I
[26:11] am
[26:13] and Simon Peter answered and said unto
[26:15] Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[26:18] Living God
[26:19] and Jesus
[26:21] answered and said unto him blessed are
[26:23] those Simon by Jonah for Flesh and Blood
[26:26] hath not revealed it on disease but my
[26:28] Father which is in heaven
[26:31] Peter Upon This Rock
[26:34] I will build my church and the gates of
[26:36] hell
[26:36] shall not Prevail against it
[26:39] Hebrews 11 verse 1.
[26:42] now Faith is a substance of King's book
[26:44] for the evidence of Things Not Seen
[26:47] for by it the elders obtain a good
[26:49] report
[26:50] true faith we understand that the worlds
[26:52] were freeing by the word of God so that
[26:54] the things which are seen were not made
[26:56] of things but to appear
[26:58] by fit Ebel offered unto God a more
[27:00] excellent sacrifice than Keen by which
[27:04] he obtained witness that he was a
[27:06] righteous God testifying of his gifts
[27:07] and by it he being dead yet speak it by
[27:11] faith Enoch was translated that he
[27:13] should not see death and was not formed
[27:15] because God had translated him
[27:17] for before his translation he had this
[27:19] testimony that he pleased God and
[27:21] without faith it is impossible to please
[27:23] him for he did come into God must
[27:26] believe that he is
[27:27] that he's a rewarder of them that
[27:30] diligently seek him our last scripture
[27:32] from second Timothy 3
[27:34] and we want to read from verse 16.
[27:37] there's one verse there all scripture
[27:41] is given by inspiration of God
[27:44] and is profitable for Doctrine
[27:47] for reproof
[27:49] for correction
[27:50] for instructions in righteousness may
[27:52] God bless his word you may be seated
[27:54] praise God it's good to be here tonight
[27:57] what a blessing and a privilege to be
[27:59] here and the house of God tonight
[28:01] and um
[28:03] this scripture we touched on it many
[28:05] times in the Amplified every scripture
[28:07] is God breathes
[28:09] or given by his inspiration
[28:14] note the scripture itself is given by
[28:16] his inspiration and profitable for dark
[28:20] instruction for reproof and conviction
[28:23] of sin for correction of error and
[28:26] discipline in obedience and for training
[28:29] in righteousness
[28:31] in holy living in Conformity to God's
[28:35] will in thought purpose and action we
[28:38] have a message in that will be played
[28:40] back a couple of services a couple of
[28:42] weeks ago
[28:43] okay so tonight I have a title
[28:48] until this thing is inspired to you
[28:52] as a title
[28:53] I know it's not complete but the rest of
[28:56] it is you are in the same shape
[28:59] until this thing
[29:02] is inspired to you
[29:04] you are in the same shape
[29:07] okay let's go
[29:16] it's good to hear the hallelujahs
[29:18] tonight amen
[29:21] Hallelujah is very encouraging I mean
[29:22] praise the Lord somebody giving God
[29:24] praise amen
[29:26] all right so let's get down
[29:30] get on to work
[29:32] not long ago
[29:35] he said I heard a case where a woman
[29:37] that belonged to a certain Church she
[29:39] might a boy dear the boy was converted
[29:41] but the woman wasn't
[29:43] they move away from the neighborhood she
[29:45] was a Pianist in the church
[29:46] she moved under the neighborhood the
[29:48] ladies in the neighborhood wasn't as
[29:49] moral and clean as they were at the
[29:51] other neighborhood so they wore Beauty
[29:53] shorts
[29:57] and anybody that's born again known as
[29:58] wrong
[30:00] it's only the devil to make you to strip
[30:02] your clothes
[30:03] there was never nobody in the Bible just
[30:05] demon powers that does these things and
[30:07] the word is full of it
[30:09] and then this woman know she said wait a
[30:11] minute my mama was just so old-fashioned
[30:13] foggy Christian
[30:15] and if these other women can be just as
[30:17] good standing in the church as I am why
[30:19] can't I do as they do
[30:21] that was in a mind to begin with
[30:24] she said I could be just as good as thee
[30:27] and did just as much thought of see
[30:29] that's that's reasoning
[30:31] now her soul
[30:33] will tell her that is wrong
[30:36] but she push it aside
[30:38] are we getting somewhere tonight
[30:40] she went to doing it anyhow
[30:43] the layers of the church most of them
[30:44] smoke cigarettes which is one of the
[30:46] coolest and the worst thing that woman
[30:48] ever done in this Modern Age
[30:51] if the ladies can smoke why can't I
[30:53] smoke so she started doing that her
[30:56] husband tried to tell her honey we don't
[30:58] do that she said no look John she do it
[31:00] anyway
[31:01] now this Soul the Bible said the soul
[31:04] that sinner shall die
[31:07] the word dead
[31:09] means to separate in other words the
[31:12] soul that disbelieves the word of God
[31:15] shall finally
[31:17] separate from you
[31:19] I watch your watch how these words are
[31:23] carefully placed
[31:26] now debt if I die now or any Christian
[31:29] would die
[31:31] it wouldn't be a separation from God
[31:33] because either heard my words and
[31:34] believe in him that sent me has
[31:36] everlasting life
[31:37] but you would separate from one from
[31:39] another
[31:41] she kept grieving that soul
[31:45] finally
[31:47] it begin to separate from her
[31:51] and go away
[31:53] and after a while
[31:55] she got to a place that a young fellow
[31:57] move in a neighborhood a married man she
[32:00] began to have a lot of Friendship with
[32:01] this nice slick looking fellow he
[32:04] picking her up taking up places finally
[32:06] it wonged up and kissing her good night
[32:07] at The Back Fence and after a while she
[32:10] left her husband
[32:12] he left his wife and they married which
[32:14] is contrary to the word of God but that
[32:16] soul
[32:18] disbelieving it it finally just moved
[32:21] away from God
[32:23] got away from it she was going by
[32:26] reasoning she was still playing the
[32:28] piano in the church
[32:30] she was still a good member just as good
[32:33] as anybody
[32:34] she moved into another neighborhood but
[32:36] this man continued on into the church
[32:38] brought her letter to another church and
[32:40] then the first thing you know this woman
[32:42] finally and if that man and any woman or
[32:45] either one ought to know if a companion
[32:47] will be untrue to a companion he'll be
[32:49] untrue or she will to you so he took up
[32:51] with another woman
[32:53] and she takes off again runs around
[32:55] finally wound up with a common law
[32:57] husband
[32:58] and it finally caught up with her
[33:00] she began to get some aches and pains in
[33:03] the lower regions
[33:05] and then she went to the doctor it was
[33:08] Advanced magnesi doctor said for his
[33:12] coming
[33:13] a city Minister which is a friend of
[33:15] mine went to her to talk about her soul
[33:17] to her
[33:18] she gave him to understand smoking one
[33:20] cigarette after the other I never sent
[33:22] for you I am just as good as you are no
[33:25] that's the very attitude prove what she
[33:28] was she said I belong to the church I
[33:31] was raised in the church he said listen
[33:34] did I belong to the same generation you
[33:36] do I know that our church doesn't teach
[33:39] that you've got to be born again
[33:42] man telling her that what about that man
[33:45] she said you get the door if I have
[33:47] wanted you I would have sent for you she
[33:49] said all right I've done what I can
[33:52] then in talking with the minister I said
[33:54] watch her
[33:56] no
[33:57] no he was trying to get her prepared
[34:01] so I could go and pray for her
[34:04] and I believe the woman would have been
[34:07] healed
[34:08] I said watch her at the end of the road
[34:13] that's the only way
[34:15] cause she just committed that sin
[34:19] and went to reasonings instead of
[34:22] listening to her school
[34:25] and that soul will catch up with her
[34:28] someday
[34:29] now when she come time to die
[34:33] her pastor with her
[34:35] the people in the room and everything
[34:37] just as normal thought she was all right
[34:40] everything believed she was all right
[34:41] and when she come time to die
[34:45] here we go I want to get this spot
[34:47] the mental faculties
[34:50] is operated by Blood and nerves which is
[34:54] in the brain
[34:55] and that will perish at your debt
[34:59] your mental faculties and your reasoning
[35:02] will pass away
[35:04] cause reasonings could not come in the
[35:07] presence of God
[35:09] it reasons with God it is the soul that
[35:13] lives
[35:14] so in other words
[35:16] uh remember
[35:19] sometimes I'm preaching I'm talking
[35:20] about all the CXC and the GC any doctor
[35:22] degree all that is in that intellectual
[35:25] level there which is a conscious level
[35:27] when you're dying that conscious breaks
[35:29] up because the mind is where the nerves
[35:32] and the blood that breaks up and your
[35:34] soul that's this unconscious level comes
[35:37] up
[35:37] and that is what is presented to God all
[35:40] right so watch notice
[35:43] the blood cease to go through her brain
[35:45] cells
[35:46] and the nerves season her memories her
[35:51] reasonings begin to Cast Away
[35:53] then what happened
[35:55] that soul
[35:57] that has been grieved away that had been
[36:00] dead to her all these years begin to
[36:02] come up to her
[36:03] and she screamed my God I'm lost
[36:06] and the Pastor said yeah there dairy she
[36:09] said I'm lost
[36:10] and the doctor ran and said she's
[36:12] getting hysterically and they give her a
[36:14] hyper World injection and she says
[36:17] scream out and they gave her another one
[36:19] till finally dying with this on the lips
[36:22] I am lost
[36:24] I am lost and the injections of The
[36:27] Testament
[36:28] it sealed her lips to Mortal ears
[36:32] but that soul that realized that had
[36:36] been grieved away it will haunt her as
[36:38] long as there's eternity
[36:40] so remember here we go tonight
[36:42] don't go by reasoning
[36:46] you be sure you're right
[36:49] there's a way of doing that that's
[36:51] accepting Jesus Christ and being born
[36:54] again of the spirit of God where entire
[36:58] soul testifies the word of God is right
[37:01] and stay with it and believe every word
[37:04] cause your spirit Bears record of his
[37:08] Spirit then
[37:09] if you love the world and it's either
[37:11] the world the love of God is not even in
[37:13] you since the Bible
[37:15] and now that is not talking about
[37:18] Lutheran or Plymouth Brethren I'm
[37:20] speaking about Holiness people
[37:21] Pentecostals and the rest that's right
[37:23] so but I'm saying I'm not talking about
[37:25] them people I don't want all of you
[37:27] all praise the name of the Lord do you
[37:29] get it tonight
[37:30] so it doesn't make no sense holding on
[37:32] to the senses
[37:34] and the reasoning
[37:35] and your own thoughts and your memory
[37:37] throw it out
[37:39] start to just believe what God Said
[37:41] to just believe what God Said say God
[37:43] you said it I believe it my soul is
[37:45] resting on it I'm convinced this is
[37:47] truth this is the word
[37:49] oh praise the name of the Lord are you
[37:50] with me now all right let's go
[37:53] brother Brown
[37:55] now to the True Believer it's the
[37:58] revelation of God being revealed in the
[38:01] age we are living in he said my words
[38:03] are spirit and life and Jesus said again
[38:06] the word is a seed that I saw a sword
[38:08] now we know that's true it is God in
[38:12] word form and can only be interpreted by
[38:15] himself
[38:16] are you ready the human mind is not
[38:19] capable to interpret the mind of God
[38:22] or get the love some praises the human
[38:24] mind is not capable to interpret the
[38:27] mind of God how a little finite mind
[38:29] interpret the infinite mind when we
[38:31] can't even interpret one another mind
[38:33] okay the Lord some Praises so all the
[38:36] intellect cannot interpret what God Said
[38:38] from the throne from his mouth them
[38:40] seven perfect spirits that went forth
[38:42] out of the Throne of God or to the mouth
[38:44] of God human mind can interpret that
[38:46] we'll give the Lord some Praises he is
[38:48] the only one that can interpret it and
[38:50] he interpreted to whomsoever he will oh
[38:54] praise God praise God praise God oh
[38:57] glory to God who do men say either some
[39:00] say you are deaf some say you are dark
[39:02] some say in your other but they're not
[39:03] inspiration drop down praise God upon
[39:06] Peter and Peter said toward the Christ
[39:08] the son of the Living God and Jesus and
[39:10] Flesh and Blood have not revealed unto
[39:13] you but my Father in Heaven has revealed
[39:15] upon you and Upon This Rock I will build
[39:17] my church you need Revelation you need
[39:20] inspiration you've got to be
[39:23] upon you oh glory to God
[39:27] Hallelujah this is beautiful you may be
[39:30] seated praise God note Revelation bypass
[39:33] the intellect

[39:38] learn and still have Revelation oh give
[39:40] the Lord a shot I feel good tonight
[39:42] glory to God you don't have an education
[39:44] you don't have to have all this amen
[39:46] degree in the message of the hour praise
[39:49] God but you have to have Revelation you
[39:51] have too much people know a lot but they
[39:53] have no Revelation whatsoever because
[39:55] Revelation is by faith faith is
[39:57] revelation private Enoch by fit Abel or
[40:00] foreign
[40:32] Hallelujah
[40:33] the word is God breathing it's God

[40:40] speaking by his son oh my notice
[40:44] oh here we go
[40:46] to whom he will reveal it so he saw
[40:49] design
[40:50] that he can hide himself in the
[40:53] scripture
[40:54] to the smartest illusion there is he can
[40:57] hide himself sit right there in the
[40:59] scripture and you look all day long and
[41:00] never see it it look a lifetime never
[41:03] see it he could hide himself sitting
[41:06] there oh let that soak in God in the
[41:09] wood can hide himself so in the world
[41:11] that there isn't that Theologian or
[41:13] school that could ever find him he said
[41:15] he hide it from a very elected
[41:17] theologians oh praise God elected
[41:20] teachers he hide it from them and the
[41:22] teaching teaching teaching teaching you
[41:23] know the teacher and the teacher
[41:25] teaching teaching with no Revelation the
[41:27] teaching what they know they're teaching
[41:29] from the intellectual level but not by
[41:31] the revelation of God or give the Lord
[41:33] some Praises that night I don't
[41:35] God hey
[41:37] oh man
[41:39] let's go
[41:41] Christ in you
[41:43] makes him the center of life of the
[41:46] revelation
[41:48] Christ's life in you makes him the
[41:51] center of the revelation
[41:53] Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the
[41:56] complete revelation of Jesus Christ
[41:58] Christ in you makes you the complete
[42:00] revelation of the whole thing what is
[42:03] God trying to do question this of Christ
[42:06] the mission of God revealed what is the
[42:08] new birth then you see well brother
[42:10] Branham what is newborn it's the
[42:12] revelation
[42:13] of Jesus Christ personally to you
[42:17] [Music]
[42:18] because the Lord some praises
[42:20] all the intellectuals and the message
[42:22] stop right there
[42:23] they are moving from that they will
[42:25] preach that till they blew in the face
[42:27] but he said more
[42:29] not you join a church you shook a hand
[42:32] you learned something different you said
[42:35] a Creed you promised to live by a code
[42:37] of rules but Christ the Bible he is the
[42:42] word that was revealed to you and no
[42:45] matter what anybody else say what take
[42:47] place it's Christ Pastor priest whatever
[42:50] it is it is Christ in you that is the
[42:53] Revelation that the church was built on
[42:56] so when Peter got that Revelation where
[42:58] Jesus said Upon This Rock have been my
[43:00] church if that was it Peter did not go
[43:02] to the upper room
[43:05] but he will not deny Jesus 27 times
[43:09] just three times over and over and over
[43:11] you understand that so Revelation is
[43:13] faith
[43:15] look if it is at the bottom or give the
[43:18] Lord some Praises glory to God do you
[43:20] get it now you need to be inspired to
[43:24] break into Faith which is the break into
[43:26] Revelation or break let's say from
[43:28] intellectual Faith to subconscious Faith
[43:30] or have faith most of the faith is
[43:32] intellectual or mental faith and he said
[43:34] yeah drop down in by the Holy Ghost
[43:36] operation and give you a spiritual Faith
[43:38] which is a rock and when they get that
[43:40] rock the delicate mover not old talk no
[43:42] no Whispering Pastor or Whispering
[43:44] Minister could move you and shake your
[43:46] horse this Revelation because you're you
[43:49] heard from your theophany you heard from
[43:50] your father you heard from Heaven you
[43:52] heard by inspiration okay the Lord some
[43:54] praise it was inspired to you oh glory
[43:57] to God thereby Jesus said Upon This Rock
[44:00] praise God build my church and the Gates
[44:02] of Hell praise God that's why we never
[44:04] deviated by the judge that's why we
[44:06] stood all these years Oh Glory to God
[44:08] not my movement of nothing I don't care
[44:10] who said what in Trinidad who don't like
[44:12] cool okay it doesn't matter what they
[44:14] say I'm standing by the Revelation what
[44:16] has been revealed to me oh glory to God
[44:19] is a prophetic Vision it's an open
[44:20] Vision okay the Lord Praise In The House
[44:22] Hallelujah
[44:24] glory to God
[44:26] so watch
[44:28] said the new birth it's the Revelation
[44:30] to you then he said from the ancient of
[44:34] the Lord he said the new birth is an
[44:36] experience
[44:41] so the intellectual gave Jessica
[44:43] revelation
[44:44] and people walk out with the knowledge
[44:46] information inside they're here this
[44:48] intellectable how to match up
[44:51] and break up
[44:53] and no change
[44:55] If any man be in Christ is a new
[44:56] creation
[44:57] All Things become new no change
[45:00] watch this now the new birth is an
[45:03] experience so it is a revelation but
[45:06] it's also an experience which one comes
[45:08] first
[45:11] is important the question that we ask
[45:14] which one comes first of course erosion
[45:16] come first
[45:17] and then the experience
[45:19] the new birth is an experience it's a
[45:21] gift of God it's a seal of your faith
[45:25] or a seal of your revelation could I
[45:28] hear a shout again on that
[45:30] it's a seal of your faith or a seal of
[45:33] your Revelation the same Revelation that
[45:35] God had to be sealed as many have
[45:37] received him by Revelation that them he
[45:40] gave power
[45:42] to become
[45:44] Oh Glory to God Heaven look you see
[45:46] Faith there on top of Faith as he virtue
[45:48] and virtue is power to become okay the
[45:50] Lord some Praises glory Lord God give
[45:53] the Lord a shout
[45:55] I'll say it again faith is a revelation
[45:57] a rock a anchor a certain point but upon
[46:01] that Revelation is a seal
[46:02] of the Holy Ghost which is power
[46:05] not adoption power yet power to pray
[46:07] power deliver holy life power to say I'm
[46:10] sorry power to repent power to amen
[46:13] that's what that power is for Oh Glory
[46:15] to God that's what the power is for you
[46:18] only know get started oh give the Lord a
[46:21] shout in the house

[46:32] Wilderness to face the devil and his
[46:35] Onslaught Give the Lord some Praises you
[46:37] can't go there in your flesh you cannot
[46:39] go there in yourself you have to be led
[46:41] by the spirit Into the Wilderness and he
[46:43] said that the dam is of this church will
[46:45] change the people of the calvary and
[46:47] then into the Rapture they're gonna
[46:49] drive it to die if they will die with
[46:51] his eyes you are what sit down and shut

[47:23] glory to God
[47:25] we're not crazy tonight right
[47:27] all right
[47:28] here we go the new book is an experience
[47:31] it's a gift of God it's a seal of your
[47:34] feet the holy spirit is a seal
[47:36] yeah the holy spirit is what
[47:40] sealed Ephesians 14 he says grieve not
[47:43] the holy spirit of God whereby you are
[47:46] sealed until the day of redemption God
[47:48] made Abraham the promise and Abraham
[47:50] believed God I was justified by faith
[47:52] and God gave him the sign of
[47:54] circumcision as a seal so he does today
[47:57] we believe him and then if you say you
[48:00] believe I do not receive the Holy Spirit
[48:02] then you do not believe because God
[48:04] promised to give you the Holy Spirit
[48:05] when you did believe now in believing
[48:08] you do not receive the Holy Spirit when
[48:10] you believe Paul asked in Acts 19 have
[48:13] you received the Holy Ghost since you
[48:15] believe it's a gift of God and then when
[48:19] the spirit of God comes into a man it
[48:22] quickens him
[48:23] and then he becomes a new creature he
[48:27] believes in the immortal God he believes
[48:30] he does all things his heart is tune
[48:31] with God how wonderful Oh Glory to God

[49:08] God give you a revelation he could turn
[49:10] your wife against you because any
[49:12] husband against you he could tell him

[49:15] that Revelation Revelation got to be

[54:58] Manchester you're a liar
[55:00] but you say so
[55:03] where is that one
[55:06] so that seed seed for the Indian church
[55:09] we read it in our service or two ago
[55:11] I've been so zealous today so the right
[55:14] kind of a seed
[55:16] because the rain coming
[55:18] the real rain
[55:19] no no sprinkling no no sprinkling you
[55:21] know the real rain coming
[55:23] says that a matter of if there ain't
[55:25] coming you know the real rain coming and
[55:27] depend upon where can I see the things
[55:28] you have what kind of manifest you're
[55:30] gonna have
[55:32] worry
[55:34] where is that ripened seed that promised
[55:37] Elijah and immediately after his days
[55:39] shall the Great Tribulation set in and
[55:41] Bully it and then the return of the
[55:43] church and the bride the bride and
[55:44] Christ shall walk upon the ashes in the
[55:46] Millennium when the earth is purified by
[55:48] fire and where they shall reign on the
[55:49] heathens that never heard the gospel
[55:51] shall be raised in that time and sons of
[55:53] God will be manifested it's if he's a
[55:57] rain he's got to have someone to Reign
[55:58] Over he's got a domain and they rule and
[56:00] reign with Christ and Christ rule with a
[56:03] rodent and the Nations then the gospel
[56:04] then the manifested sons of God with the
[56:07] authority just like he had when he was
[56:08] here they will come in a millennium in
[56:10] that room
[56:11] oh my
[56:13] God I've watched for something
[56:16] but I'm speaking has it slipped Upon Us
[56:18] in humility
[56:19] and we miss it is it gone and Jesus life
[56:22] and a sin if that be so then it's later
[56:24] than you think if not
[56:27] prophets coming on if not there's coming
[56:30] one with a message
[56:31] that is straight on the Bible
[56:33] and a quick work will certainly eat
[56:36] the seeds will go in newspapers read the
[56:39] material until every predestinated seed
[56:42] of God has healed it
[56:44] none of them will come except the father
[56:46] draw them and everyone the father has
[56:48] drawn will hear it and come that will be
[56:51] the predestinated seed will hear the
[56:53] word
[56:54] so you are predestinancy like Christ was
[56:57] that's why I said don't forget that

[57:00] predestinated seed that's why you're
[57:02] heard and received the word glory to God

[1:04:45] on that whole thing will be that I
[1:04:47] believe
[1:04:48] the rain has been brought that's the
[1:04:52] reason we are quaint and ding dong
[1:04:54] quieting down
[1:04:55] because the ground is already sold over
[1:04:59] so when the ground is sold
[1:05:00] quiet
[1:05:02] relaxing time
[1:05:05] and then all of a sudden something Greek
[1:05:09] what's something now he said that season
[1:05:12] we are quieting down now because the
[1:05:14] ground is already sold over
[1:05:16] you can't find anywhere hardly what's
[1:05:19] been sown it went out to radio
[1:05:20] television tapes word everything is
[1:05:23] there soon the country now it is planted
[1:05:25] Seas no what seeds was planted you
[1:05:28] cannot get nothing else but what seas

[1:05:50] what the minister said I don't want the
[1:05:51] minister Association think it doesn't
[1:05:52] matter you know this is the prophecy

[1:08:30] reap what a confederation of church
[1:08:31] that's to be born like bones and prisons
[1:08:34] but where the word of God be sold into
[1:08:36] the people's heart yeah we see here we
[1:08:37] go where the word of God being sown into
[1:08:40] people's heart what did the parable says

[1:08:57] being fought through to Perfection or
[1:09:00] give the Lord some Praises glory to God
[1:09:02] but where the word of God have been sown
[1:09:05] into people's heart it will reap a
[1:09:07] bright for Christ as certain as I am
[1:09:09] standing here the prophets are certain
[1:09:12] as I'm standing here where the word of
[1:09:15] God we're not some minister is in
[1:09:16] people's heart no or some church and
[1:09:18] people are where the word of God is in
[1:09:20] people's hearts Hallelujah it will be
[1:09:23] bright for Christ as certainly I'm
[1:09:24] standing here glory to God Amen
[1:09:28] let's go

[1:09:39] he said Don't Look Back look forward

[1:09:44] resources
[1:09:45] [Laughter]
[1:09:47] untapped like a discovering fresh oil
[1:09:51] fresh gas hallelujah praise God untapped
[1:09:54] resources and then he he barely tap into
[1:09:57] they say no Jesus said in sin mark them
[1:10:00] 23. if you say to this mountain be moved
[1:10:03] and don't talk in your heart but believe
[1:10:06] that you have said it will come to pass
[1:10:08] you can have what you said
[1:10:10] no conditions it's Unlimited whatsoever
[1:10:14] things you desire
[1:10:16] When you pray
[1:10:17] believe you received them and you shall
[1:10:20] have them
[1:10:21] that's Unlimited
[1:10:22] that's what the Bible says whatever
[1:10:24] Divine Healing joy peace everything now
[1:10:27] you see brother Branham what if we ask
[1:10:29] for something for somebody's life to be
[1:10:31] taken
[1:10:33] or some everything
[1:10:35] well you wouldn't really have Christian
[1:10:37] feet flirting like that
[1:10:43] Christian things
[1:10:44] to receive things from Christ you must
[1:10:47] all remember church God words are true
[1:10:50] and I believe the right mental attitude
[1:10:55] towards any Divine promise of God will
[1:10:57] bring it apart if you can look at it the
[1:10:59] right way but remember
[1:11:01] here has been my standard in life
[1:11:04] I have tried to do this
[1:11:08] the first thing I want to find out is
[1:11:11] whether it's the will of God or not
[1:11:13] then I know it's God's will
[1:11:16] the next thing
[1:11:18] is my objective to it
[1:11:20] and my motive in doing it then if it's
[1:11:24] the will of God and my objective is
[1:11:27] right and my motive is right I have
[1:11:30] faith
[1:11:31] that will be done
[1:11:33] so he's also saying you cannotic will by
[1:11:35] objective and motive not right
[1:11:37] that's what this mean here you
[1:11:38] understand that because first is the
[1:11:41] will of God I have my objective is to
[1:11:44] glorify him my motive is to give him all
[1:11:47] the glory there's no selfish motives
[1:11:49] about it if you have a selfish motive it
[1:11:51] won't work if your objective is to make
[1:11:54] money for yourself or something it will
[1:11:56] never succeed when you try to do
[1:11:58] something outside the will of God it
[1:12:00] won't work to begin with
[1:12:01] so there's a genuine fate
[1:12:04] but you must come into the real channel
[1:12:06] of God to have that genuine faith
[1:12:09] I don't give a bomb here there is human
[1:12:12] feet
[1:12:14] and there's a fate of God
[1:12:19] so people have the power themselves by
[1:12:21] the human you know but that will have
[1:12:23] his limitation but there's a fate of God
[1:12:25] and you must have a Godly fit to believe
[1:12:29] and then to have Godly Faith you must
[1:12:31] have the mind of Christ in you then
[1:12:33] that's how God projects to you Visions
[1:12:36] Revelations all these things come by the
[1:12:39] mind of Christ being in you you get it

[1:12:44] praise God blessed be the name of the
[1:12:47] Lord Oh Glory to God to the Pentecostal
[1:12:51] goddamn mechanics and Dynamics and the
[1:12:52] spoken tongues in Azusa isn't that right
[1:12:54] praise God but but for our age we didn't
[1:12:58] have it so that God come and become and
[1:12:59] hear the word and there's fire that's
[1:13:01] all powerful no he brought a prophetic
[1:13:04] message in the learning of Christ
[1:13:06] that had to be taught that had to be
[1:13:08] unfolded in the seals he called him
[1:13:11] about the time of the revelation of
[1:13:12] these things they may known so God had
[1:13:14] all these Revelation to make it no it
[1:13:15] took time and along the time has been
[1:13:17] unfolded he calling people there are
[1:13:20] people who have gone on to be with the
[1:13:21] Lord in the 70s and the 80s and the 90s
[1:13:23] we're still here all alone from 1965 to
[1:13:26] now he said the message will go on print
[1:13:28] and newspapers and we'll go to every
[1:13:30] seed it took time to do that he's still
[1:13:33] calling people still delivering people
[1:13:35] isn't that right isn't that God but
[1:13:37] there's a promise of Dynamics to the
[1:13:39] bride it's not right hallelujah praise
[1:13:42] God praise God praise God all right
[1:13:45] let's go now
[1:13:48] here is a predisciplined plan in
[1:13:50] Plainview
[1:13:51] just as other seed the word of God is
[1:13:55] the seed and must have the ground
[1:13:56] prepared beforehand
[1:13:58] if you associate just throw it out in
[1:14:00] the ground I'll do no good the boys will
[1:14:02] pick it up you throw it out it will
[1:14:04] choke up pretty soon
[1:14:06] this probably said so so the ground here
[1:14:09] we go has to make me really feels are
[1:14:12] you ready now
[1:14:13] so God in Sovereign Grace
[1:14:15] be peers
[1:14:17] the heart
[1:14:18] first
[1:14:20] he prepared you
[1:14:22] before the foundation of the world
[1:14:25] to receive him in this age
[1:14:27] he foreknew You by his full knowledge
[1:14:30] and ordain you to eternal life he knew
[1:14:34] you therefore he prepared you
[1:14:36] oh gift you couldn't miss it if you try
[1:14:38] or give the Lord some Praises Oh Glory
[1:14:41] to God oh this this ought to make a
[1:14:44] Baptist shout tonight
[1:14:46] glory to God hallelujah hallelujah
[1:14:49] hallelujah when did he prepare you
[1:14:51] before
[1:14:52] the foundation of the world to receive
[1:14:54] him in this age he foreknew You by his
[1:14:57] foreknowledge and ordain you to eternal
[1:14:59] life he knew you therefore he prepared
[1:15:02] you that's the reason you staggered out
[1:15:05] of these things and then staggered into
[1:15:07] what you have now it was God leading you
[1:15:10] to the place where you're dying for you
[1:15:12] to be Oh Glory to God if the scrum isn't
[1:15:15] prepared before and it can't grow that's

[1:15:42] Revelation and by Vision that was before
[1:15:45] the Bible was written we find out and
[1:15:48] take some of his life God blessed him
[1:15:49] made him a great man everybody respected
[1:15:52] him even to his wisdom had become so
[1:15:54] great his inspiration from God had
[1:15:57] Vindicated him to be God's servant so
[1:16:00] plainly until the people come from
[1:16:01] everywhere to him and then Satan begin
[1:16:04] to accuse that man that's the way he
[1:16:06] does every inspired servant of God Satan
[1:16:09] is always there to accuse him of
[1:16:11] everything he does that's not right now
[1:16:13] we find out in his life on Charles his
[1:16:15] great faith even Jesus when he came on
[1:16:18] Earth he referred to the patience of Job
[1:16:20] he said have you not read the patience
[1:16:22] of Job

[1:21:36] job at a Channel of communication to God
[1:21:39] and that he got by inspiration he had a
[1:21:42] way of moving himself out
[1:21:44] and letting God move in he know he was
[1:21:47] justified it was a gift a gift for the
[1:21:50] people not for job but for the people
[1:21:51] that's what all Divine gifts are to
[1:21:54] serve God's people oh praise God I'm
[1:21:57] going to step down quickly you know
[1:21:58] David was inspired all the people
[1:22:01] shouting and glorifying God for a reason
[1:22:02] that seemed exactly but he was the wrong
[1:22:04] person that inspiration should have come
[1:22:06] to Nathan not David he never even
[1:22:08] consulted Nathan you see does nothing
[1:22:10] till he reveal it to some of the
[1:22:12] prophets now job was this Prophet is
[1:22:14] this day the only thing God had done to
[1:22:16] job was always given wisdom his word and
[1:22:18] inspiration he could but he could get no
[1:22:20] inspiration but he knowed all his
[1:22:22] mechanics he had done he know what to do
[1:22:24] was right he couldn't get a word from
[1:22:27] God but the devil couldn't move him
[1:22:30] because he had a revelation oh give the
[1:22:33] Lord a praise
[1:22:34] because you need inspiration you know
[1:22:36] so that time they're going bone dry call
[1:22:38] it Quicks biscuit giant try Tokyo
[1:22:42] willingness right
[1:22:44] but you're looking for inspiration would
[1:22:45] you have to Jesus
[1:22:47] he was led by the spirits Into the
[1:22:49] Wilderness when the spirit led him he
[1:22:51] spread leave him alone you know he's dry
[1:22:54] wilderness
[1:22:56] he's trying if they'll be if they'll be
[1:22:58] you gotta be tested
[1:23:00] he can't be trusting anything floating
[1:23:02] for him
[1:23:03] where's that
[1:23:05] when he come out now so all all the
[1:23:07] experience coming upon him now so the
[1:23:08] anointing flowing is upon him
[1:23:10] dry dry dry dry
[1:23:13] overcome the devil and what happened
[1:23:15] after that the Bible said he returned in
[1:23:17] the power of the spirit the Spirit come
[1:23:18] down upon him

[1:23:43] spirit in word form it's written it's

[1:24:17] and said the spirit is upon me for he
[1:24:19] hath anointed me in other words I'm

[1:24:24] to cast out Devils to open Blind Eye to
[1:24:27] raise the Dead Or Glory to God and the

[1:24:58] from God but the devil couldn't move him
[1:25:00] now there is where you are when you're
[1:25:02] prayed for you don't have to run back to
[1:25:04] a line or go let somebody just pray for
[1:25:06] you when you know you have done exactly
[1:25:09] what God told you to do then wait
[1:25:12] for that channel of inspiration to open
[1:25:16] up to you
[1:25:17] I know I'm here then it drops into here
[1:25:20] let's continue are you ready
[1:25:23] will you take some more
[1:25:25] you're almost done
[1:25:26] after 10 pages and we're on page nine so
[1:25:28] we're going good
[1:25:29] all right let's go now you must realize
[1:25:31] then friend what condition you're in
[1:25:34] that's the reason I said this tip is to
[1:25:36] the church only
[1:25:38] if you have been called
[1:25:41] from Darkness into light
[1:25:43] from dead to life
[1:25:45] from former intellectual conception of
[1:25:48] Christ to a born-again experience and
[1:25:52] watching your life that it lays the
[1:25:54] things of the world inside and you
[1:25:56] standing for Christ regardless then
[1:25:58] something has happened
[1:25:59] there is something in you hungering and
[1:26:01] moving like Jacob you wrestle with the
[1:26:04] Lord you walk different after that
[1:26:05] something
[1:26:06] no here we go this is where I get
[1:26:09] inspiration from before it can be done
[1:26:13] it has
[1:26:15] it has to you
[1:26:18] are you ready
[1:26:22] I could stand here and preach till I got
[1:26:25] whatever here I got fell off till my
[1:26:28] shoulders stooped down and I was 90
[1:26:30] years old and you listen every day
[1:26:34] until God
[1:26:36] Quicken that to you you are still in the
[1:26:39] same shape
[1:26:41] so they could press play from now to the
[1:26:43] tribulation period
[1:26:46] unless
[1:26:48] it becomes inspired same shape
[1:26:53] hearing preachers hearing word
[1:26:57] two days I've been studying and praying
[1:26:59] on this I said Lord what should I say to
[1:27:02] the church
[1:27:03] something said see it
[1:27:05] the aura is at hand
[1:27:07] I feel it's pulling me away pretty soon
[1:27:10] and I want you to know it
[1:27:11] no man can come to me and he spoke us
[1:27:14] right notice
[1:27:16] the fruits of the spirit now see it has
[1:27:19] to be quickened to you almost done
[1:27:21] when it come time for show them to
[1:27:23] unveil on God he said go get the
[1:27:24] sacrifice do anything in one person call
[1:27:27] upon your God when they cut themselves
[1:27:29] had another flesh jump up and down a lot
[1:27:31] of noise he said holy louder maybe God
[1:27:33] push you in somewhere he might be asleep
[1:27:35] you know what he said I'm a believing
[1:27:38] Jehovah so I can do this anymore no you
[1:27:40] don't you impersonate that don't even
[1:27:43] try to be like yourself God called you
[1:27:45] to be
[1:27:45] I'm a servant of Jehovah there's 700 of
[1:27:48] them down there too none of them dare to
[1:27:50] do it but when he cut the Bullock and
[1:27:51] poured water on it he said Lord Elijah
[1:27:54] now I have done this at your command
[1:27:57] anybody else could have tried it it
[1:27:59] would have been total failure
[1:28:02] because why it was inspired Elijah
[1:28:04] it's got to be inspired to you and the
[1:28:07] Holy Spirit has to bring it
[1:28:09] and make it manifest to you and that's
[1:28:12] what's the matter today you can't get up
[1:28:14] in the order and say well Hallelujah
[1:28:15] Lord I want Holy Ghost I don't know
[1:28:17] brother and sister when the Holy Ghost
[1:28:19] had inspired that word to you you will
[1:28:21] get it before you leave your seat
[1:28:25] foreign
[1:28:36] [Applause]
[1:28:58] even Jesus himself he said I do not what
[1:29:01] I want to do my Within Myself the son
[1:29:04] can do nothing but what he sees the
[1:29:06] father doing he was Emmanuel himself he
[1:29:08] was going on here Jesus was he was the
[1:29:09] flesh that God dwelled in he was the
[1:29:11] tent that God live under but all of that
[1:29:13] the Virgin born son of God Emmanuel in
[1:29:15] the fullness of the spirit he was the
[1:29:17] spirit of the measure yet he said I do
[1:29:18] nothing until the father chose me first
[1:29:20] inspired him to do it so Jesus himself
[1:29:23] was saying I'm waiting for inspiration
[1:29:25] to do this thing my father shows me
[1:29:27] first isn't that right there are too
[1:29:30] many trying to impersonate different
[1:29:32] things of the Lord you can't do that
[1:29:34] that things comes by election God's
[1:29:37] calling you are dropped from your
[1:29:39] mother's womb with that peace and
[1:29:40] calling about repentance that's true you
[1:29:42] can't make yourself something you're not
[1:29:43] but if God calls you listen
[1:29:46] take this to her tonight if God calls
[1:29:49] you be the most thankful person in the
[1:29:52] world because he has called you
[1:29:55] then it becomes real to you as I would
[1:29:58] speak if I had time the squirrels the
[1:30:00] other day I'd turn me around I never
[1:30:02] seen her before I say I couldn't do it
[1:30:04] right there looking at me but how could
[1:30:06] that ever happen it could not have been
[1:30:07] done but it was inspired it was
[1:30:10] quickened the world was spoke and it was
[1:30:12] so oh praise God we're gonna finish the
[1:30:14] home stretch here now glory to God
[1:30:16] whenever
[1:30:19] I'm brought this out you know when ail
[1:30:22] by inspiration come
[1:30:24] no Beauty but they come in Inspiration
[1:30:26] he had no Bibles to tell him it was a
[1:30:28] lamb but God revealed to him it was a
[1:30:31] lamb Oh Glory to God isn't that right
[1:30:34] today people think the same thing the
[1:30:36] channel missions they'll use reason and
[1:30:38] King but offering he said and so forth
[1:30:40] the gospel being preached people shun it
[1:30:42] they don't they want to act like the
[1:30:43] world and be like the world like the
[1:30:45] woman
[1:30:45] because of its reasoning you can't go by
[1:30:48] that c is by inspiration and then he
[1:30:51] read the scripture we read who the man
[1:30:53] said the son of Manama and so like that
[1:30:55] he said and and Flesh and Blood hasn't
[1:30:57] revealed to you I'll skip that all right
[1:31:00] that's what the shanamite woman was
[1:31:02] doing it was unreasonable to take a dead
[1:31:04] baby to the preacher's bed but
[1:31:06] inspiration spoke and if the inspiration
[1:31:08] speak to you that you have been playing
[1:31:10] church if inspiration tells you tonight
[1:31:13] it's time to get rid of your dirty
[1:31:14] habits listen to the inspiration it is

[1:31:57] portion of your spirit be sent upon me
[1:31:59] he said he asks a great thing God
[1:32:01] wants us to ask for big things
[1:32:05] he don't run all the blessings up there
[1:32:07] you can ask for too much
[1:32:10] I feel we asked him too little you know
[1:32:12] yeah could you imagine a little fish
[1:32:14] about that long in the middle ocean
[1:32:15] saying I better not drink much of this
[1:32:17] thing because it might go dry

[1:32:23] praise God okay
[1:32:25] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:32:28] praise be to Jesus
[1:32:30] he said they might frustrate you
[1:32:33] because they're trying to agree with
[1:32:34] their reasonings but don't in their
[1:32:36] heart they admire
[1:32:39] unless their soul associate till they
[1:32:41] have nothing but reason for if you are a
[1:32:44] real Christian Living a true life living
[1:32:47] the word of God with you everybody will
[1:32:49] admire it
[1:32:50] if his soul is in touch with god oh
[1:32:54] praise God
[1:32:55] he said you have seen it
[1:32:58] a man pick up a certain scripture and
[1:33:01] brother that man can take that scripture
[1:33:02] and make it live new
[1:33:04] make it live exactly what it promised
[1:33:06] you in the Bible begin to pray something
[1:33:08] and the next man will see him do it and
[1:33:11] he will come around and try to do it and
[1:33:12] feel I hope you're reading me now he'll
[1:33:15] feel why
[1:33:16] the scripture is not inspired to him
[1:33:19] he's only trying to impersonate and that
[1:33:22] is the Bible reading Giants and jambres
[1:33:24] destined Moses Jester jamres and Moses
[1:33:27] stood on a rod become a serpent and
[1:33:30] pharaoh and you know carry on he said
[1:33:31] just like super century they say that
[1:33:34] was for another day they are all
[1:33:36] together out but watch this spirit in
[1:33:38] the last days go to impersonate the real
[1:33:40] Spirit there is where trouble coming

[1:33:53] is what's going to make the difference

[1:34:00] that why David Tootsie I'll cut your
[1:34:02] head off and run to make Goliath you
