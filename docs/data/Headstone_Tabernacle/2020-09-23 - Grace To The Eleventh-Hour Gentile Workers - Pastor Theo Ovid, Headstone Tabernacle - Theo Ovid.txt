forever granted lord in jesus and we ask it amen praise the lord god bless you 39 and matthew 5 we want to read verse 6. readings in john matthew 20 rather from verse one and the kingdom for the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a householder which went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his vineyard and when he had agreed with the laborers for a penny a day he sent them into his vineyard and he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace and said unto them go ye also into the vineyard and whatsoever is right i will give you and they went away again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour and then likewise about eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle says unto them why stanley here all the day idle they said unto him because no man had hired us we he said unto them go ye also into the vineyard and whatever is right that shall you receive so when evil was come the lord of the vineyard is cured call the laborers give them they hire beginning from the last on to the first when they came that were hired about the 11th hour they received every man a penny and when the first came they supposed that they should have received more and they likewise receive every man a penny when they had received at the moment against the good man of the house saying these last have wrought but one hour and hours made them equal under us which have borne the burden and the heat of the day and he answered one of them and said friend i do no wrong just not thou agree with me for a penny take the thine is and go thy way i will give unto this last eve mazantasy is it not lawful for me to do what i will with my own is thine i even because i am good so the last shall be first and the first last for many be called but few chosen and from john 7 37 and the last day that great day of the feast jesus stood and cried saying if any man tooth let him come unto me and drink he that believe it on me as the scripture had said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water but this speak he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the holy ghost was not yet given because jesus was not yet glorified on our last scripture blessed that day listen matthew 5 6 which do hunger and tears after righteousness for it shall be filled father we thank you once more for this word blessed interpret our hearts in jesus name i ask it amen and amen even be seated praise the name of the lord god bless you blessed be the name of the lord it's great to be here and uh in acts chapter 19 and the scripture paul passed through the upper course of ephesus and finances and disciples he said to them have you received the holy ghost since you believed and they said unto them but we have not so much i've heard there be any holy ghost he said to them and to what then were you baptized and they said unto john baptism and then said paul john verily baptized with the baptism of repentance seen unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on christ jesus and when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus and when paul had laid his hands upon them listen the holy ghost came on them and they speak with tongues and prophesied oh please praise the name of the lord and that was the team of the apostles have you received the holy ghost since you believe amen tonight have a title grace to the eleventh our gentile workers that's the title tonight grace to the 11th hour gentile workers the trust you edify by the message on sunday and the instructions given are you meant to press on for that holy ghost and the message recognizing this message he was talking about uh there was a feast of pentecost and between the feast of pentecost and the feast of the trumpets was a long period of time 50 days and 50 pentecost means 50 and the first fruits of the harvest was brought in and we see it in a tight back there with the natural first fruit represent the first fruits of the holy spirit to be poured upon the people and we find out then that them 50 days was received by the gentiles which god called the gentiles a people for his name the feast of pentacles now listen listen and we have been going through that long feast of pentecost which represent seven is not right seven sabbats now actually the from the 50 days will exactly be seven sabbats and seven sabbaths represent seven church ages to be called in the time of the pentecostal feasts to call up people from the gentiles for his name so this period of time is 50 in 50 of seven sevens 72 changes and in that period of time is the times of the gentiles to be called out he called it this long feast of pentecost now at the end of these seven sabbaths there was to be the day of atonement which was the seven trumpets and we know that connected with the jews that they would mourn the one that they rejected even christ and the seven trumpets was to call a day of mourning back to the sacrifice or the atonement and we find out that israel the seven trumpets pertain only to israel the times of the gentiles has been in this pentecostal feast it has no other time remaining just the times of the gentiles and that's what the terminology that god referred to us as gentiles not a specific time but the times of the gentiles the bible even talked talk about it until the fullness of the gentiles come in so once that time is over which is this long feast which represents seven churches then god goes back to the jews now he said he opened the seals under the sixth seal the seven trumpets sung under the sixth seal because we know that the seventh seal is silence it's christ coming down in secret coming down to call our bride out so now here you go here we go now then the prophet broke here now now the seventh angel's message is to open the mystery of the seals calling the 11 hour gentile workers to receive the same pay that the first hour workers got that is the whole objective what is it for outside of the opening of the seals we will just be another denominational group another nominational following or whatever it is but the seals was open the mystery of it to call the eleven hour gentle workers that's you and i to receive something not to talk about it not to testify about it not to just preach about it and teach about it but to literally receive something and tonight if everything you get from this service tonight is that you have to receive something you have to receive something i'm not talking about coming to church i'm not talking about listening to tapes i'm not talking about reading books i'm talking about to receive something belly shall flow rivers of living water then we went on to explain that or interpret the dispatchy of the spirit that they should receive but jesus was not yet glorified so the holy ghost was not yet given so it was an uncommon promise but he was dropping the promises of them he that believe it on me as the scripture had said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water and that has an interpretation with that which is the holy ghost and the filling of the holy ghost so let's go again the 11th the seven angel memphis our workers got and jesus taught it he said there were some people who went into the harvest and they were hired so we know that jesus was hiding mysteries in parables that's how he was veiling it it looked like his stories and telling stories and parables but the reality was he was veiling mysteries inside of those parables so he said on the noon time someone went so he said and they went and um they were hired and when they did in the early morning they received time a penny for the day and at noon time someone else came in went to work 11th hour that's the last of the day that someone come in and receive the same kind of pay that they did at the first hour of the day it so perfectly was a dark age that blocked them out then in the middle of the day luther wesley came in and then there is to be here we go an evening time message and and to receive the same thing that it did at the beginning the evening time message was to restore back or to bring back that same thing again oh hallelujah the same thing that those brothers receive so he sent a prophet messenger to turn our hearts back to the fate of the fathers to get the same pay that all the guys had received isn't that wonderful oh glory to god the word is not by might not by power but by my spirit and these are the messages of grace he said who what thou great mountain before there's a rubber belt though shall become a plane he shall bring forth the headstone without shouting scrying people who had laid the foundation of the building and he said the ruby bell had laid the foundation with his hands he shall also bring forth the headstone i want you to notice he never said he shall bring forth the cornerstone he shall bring forth the headstone so he is speaking about our day our time this is not cornerstone time this is headstone time so jew hubba bell was prophesying about our day and we know the scriptures say that jesus is the chief cornerstone he's also the headstone now if he would think for a few minutes that the seventh church messenger was the restored fate of the children back to the fathers in other words so that statement could be taken this way and that way but when the prophet interpreted you have no more interpretation to go with it he said in other words rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit not my power not by might but by my spirit saith the lord not by organization not by the nomination but by the holy spirit god will bring for this church in the last day so no man can run that no man can overshadow that no man can denominate that it's by the holy ghost holy ghost alone that god going to bring forth the church in the last day oh glory to god and if i had to call it inspiration for this i would call it power from on high oh glory to god not poor from america power from from from south america or africa or europe power from on high oh glory to god this power for the bride is powering from a man is power from on high not power from justin's will power from on high oh glory to god that performed the mrs association power from on high he said you shall receive power when after the holy ghost come upon you not after you join this church not after you follow this message pope no no after the holy ghost come upon you oh glory to god oh give the lord some praises tonight power from on high they say what is promise this is what we have to receive you don't don't short yourself oh glory to god don't short yourself hallelujah listen this is from the seat of god jesus said a man went out and he walked another man went out to another hour he worked another one went out and worked and one man went out at the 11th hour and then he stopped at the 11 hour he gave everyone the same portion the eleventh hour they wondered why he got eleven tower everyone coming in martin luther work and luther dispensation died in grace others shouted methodists on the westerly age died in grace we are living in another age not back there mother used to say we go on an ox cat now we got a model v8 ford almost jet propelled we are living in a different age altogether we are living in a different dispensation we are living in the day of the restoration of the powers of god and christ said would be powers yonder like they did in the beginning we are living another age they're not looting age there's no westerly age there's the hour of the restoration of the power of god all glory to god and brother branham was the first one that came to maturity to demonstrate this power of god and that sign that he was was saying other sons coming with the same power of god oh give the lord a shout hallelujah other sons come in with the same power of god don't look back yet to wesley methodist then finish already he's the ought and finisher of our faith oh glory to god the 11th hour people would come in the last calling of the gentiles mother worked there dad worked grandmother worked there this is our age the 11th hour was stopped on the 11th month in the year the 11th day of the month the 11 hour of the day the 11th minute and the hour and the 11th hour people might come in what to receive you know what the same baptism of the holy ghost that they big that back there what the same hallelujah baptism are saying it tonight the same one not the new one not a different one not a modern one the same holy ghost they received back there that they did at the beginning to bring back the powers and the resurrection of the lord jesus christ with the same signs and the same wonders oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah but the message these sendings there's so much intellectualism all people weren't interested in is what this mean and what this mean could you explain to change anybody could you achieve the resurrection somebody won't hear about the trumpet god holy trump is unfolding and they trump a god and returning christ shall rise and what kind of body they come up with i'm not gonna explanation and what that we don't need that we need to believe what god promised not no explanation revelation we need no explanation we need revelation and expectation for the manifestation of what god promised or give the lord some praises because once it's revealed which is faith it puts you in a channel it puts you in an atmosphere of expectation for what god promised oh glory to god hallelujah thank you lord jesus hallelujah let me continue here now and this is some modern events there are many people just can't believe it it's even spiritual people i'm going to give you one that will choke you the baptism of the holy ghost don't mean you're going in not at all not on that don't have anything to do with your soul and that's the baptism here's the inside soul in here has got to come from god then on the outside you have five senses in let's see your ugly home the inside you have a spirit in there you have five outlets conscience imagination memory and so on like that remember in that spirit you can be baptized with the genuine spirit of god and still be lost it is the soul that lives that was ordained of god now you may be seated now this quote here uh ministers take this and mean there is no there is no need for the holy ghost because that you could have the holy ghost baptism and be lost but this is not what he's saying here that is not what he is seeing here that is interpreted like that that you don't need the holy ghost because the seed in his soul what he is saying are saved this way when the holy ghost fell on the lutherans they could only produce justification because that was their seed when the holy ghost fell on the wesleyans they could only produce sanctification because that was their seed hallelujah when the holy ghost fell on the pentecostals they produced the gifts because that was their seed now our seed is not abraham fate it's not is the isaac love it's not jacob grace it's to the perfection that's our seed so when the holy ghost fall on us we have to produce that rainbow coat or give the lord a shout in the house that is our seed if the seed is right then the holy ghost activate the sea that is right and that seed in you is in your soul all glory to god the holy ghost doesn't make you a son because your son god empowers you but the holy ghost you shall receive power when the holy ghost come upon you oh give the lord a shout in the house hallelujah hallelujah so this quote i just read does not negate the experience of the holy ghost and this is what he said what is the holy ghost what is it now the reason i have taken this subject you cannot come and receive the holy spirit unless you know what it is you cannot receive it if you know what it is unless you believe it's given to you and it's for you and you cannot know whether you've got it or not unless you know the results it brings so if you know what it is who it's to what accident brings when it comes then you will know what you got when you get it and that would settle it now the first place the holy spirit has been promised no no man promised that the court promised that hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah the holy ghost is what a promise that's what is a promise hallelujah the holy spirit is a sign and abram our father was given a promise because god gave the promise to abraham unto his seed and the promise was made to abraham and to receive and this sign is the covenant people then he went on to say this there's a vast difference between just a christian and a holy ghost-filled christian this has nothing to do with i am in the message i believe a prophet this is not what we speak in here there's a vast difference between just a christian and a holy ghost-filled christian are we going to get this from the scripture place it exactly in the scripture the first place there's a christian that professed to be a christian hallelujah and if this christian has not yet been filled with the holy ghost he is only in the process of being a christian he is a professed to believe it he is working to it but god has not given him his spirit of the holy ghost he has not yet reached that goal with god that god recognized it and the circumcision is the type of the holy ghost and god gave abraham the circumcision after he had accepted god on his promise and walk out into a strange country it was a sign and all his children and their seed after him should have this sign in their flesh because it was a distinction it was to separate them from all other people this sign of circumcision and that's what god uses today is a sign of circumcision of the heart the holy spirit and that makes god's church a separated church so oh hallelujah so it's a promise it's a sign it's a seal it's a seal of a finished work it's your witness it's your seal it's your assurance it's your protection is to say i'm heaven bong don't care what the devil say i'm heaven bong he sealed me he gave it to me he see me in his kingdom i am glory bomb if you seal you no minister could unseal you they could trail the church by the country of the kingdom they control the circle but they captured all the kingdom or give the lord a shout what is the holy ghost it is the spirit of christ in you so the holy ghost another trinidadian the holy ghost is not a trait in that spirit do you want us prayer they'll get busted and rip out hallelujah yeah china thing with the holy ghost the holy ghost is christ spirit oh glory to god give your word a new heart a new spirit and my spirit that holy ghost is my spirit his spirit holy spirit oh glory i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you little while the worst hit me no more but you are going to see me oh give the lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god thank you lord jesus hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord oh hallelujah hallelujah praise god let's continue the holy spirit given utterance sometimes with words you can't understand he's our attorney he pleads for us isn't that right he stands in our place what is the holy ghost the rest amen let's notice again it's a promise to the believer and then he quote this scripture he said uh um i send my promise to my father upon you what promise the one isaiah spoke about with stamina lips another tongues so when jesus opened it on the sign to the scriptures not only did he open understanding to the old settlement text of what was hidden back there but he unfolded to them what they had was to receive just as the prophet came to to tie up the loose ends and talk about soup and seed and all kind of hidden mysteries that was back there that couldn't be understood but not only that he tell them what they have to receive and then he said but i'll send the promise of my father upon you but tarry in the city of jerusalem until you be endured with power from on high and there's going to be a church there's going to be a bunch of people that will be endued with power from on high let me say it real good there's going to be a people in trinidad that's going to be endued with power from on high not power from no bishop not powerful no message pope but power from on high is going to come upon you you cherish your power after the holy ghost come upon you it's the same old-fashioned holy ghost they want to make a stagger that wouldn't make it rock that the peters has the bishop can't stay upright or glory to god he might even throw them on the floor it doesn't matter what to do yo doesn't matter what happened to you oh glory to god what is the holy ghost then he said powerful and high not from a bishop not power from the church but power from on high he said you become a member of the brahm tabernacle he said no you become a member to this church no not so you don't see power after you become a preacher no you shall receive power that's why preachers have no power it's not power after they've gone preacher i have been calling pulp but i think i'm a singer i'm a musician i held that dick that's not the power coming power is strictly holy ghost preacher deacon elder it doesn't matter power comes from god oh glory to god man can give it his power money can't bring this power it comes from god you can't pay for this power it comes from god go hallelujah praise god and you shall receive power after the holy ghost come upon you and you should be a witnesses watch unto me the seventh seal and which is samaria onto the uttermost part of it a man that ever received the holy ghost don't care whether he's begs or bread or not doesn't make no difference to him he's heaven-boned he don't have no ties actually at all he don't care let come let go you let them criticize make fun lose your prestige what do you care you on your water glory hallelujah your eyes are set on christ you are on your road you don't care what the world say what the holy ghost is it's a power oh glory it's a seal it's a comforter it's an advocate it's a sign it's the assurance that god has received you oh glory to god the body of christ is one spirit where every member from pentecost to this time yeah yeah yeah where every member from pentecost to this time drink of that same new wine that same holy ghost bringing in the same results how do we do it by one spirit it is god's open door the holy spirit what is it it is god's open door it's a sign it's a seal it's a comforter it's an advocate it's an assurance it's a rest it is goodness it is healing it is life it is god's open door to all these things it is god's open door oh hallelujah he said jesus ain't going to stand outside your door and knock all the time there's come a time when he will get enough and turn away then you will do the knocking you'll never find him come one is time come while there is knock don't you compromise with anything less than the baptism holy ghost don't tell me a church your appreciation are you hearing me out there and listening i'll come to interrupt your twins in night service this is the world we preach in here and jesus tell them blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness they shall be filled or if you are not tasted in hunger and how you will be filled you ought to be hungering and to be thirsting for it that means god had to dig up the stuff in your heart that affecting the testing because sometimes they have women there it have money there it have cardio it have all kind of idols inside break down them idols rip out the things of your system that you have a test for god like david said as the heart pant after the water block my soul tastes i'm tasting tonight still twisted come while this time come while there's a knock don't you compromise with anything less than the baptism of the holy ghost like they got a pentecost with the same type of water baptism same thing they don't you let nothing put anything in your heart less than that oh glory to god oh my hallelujah let's take a little more remember the old testament if a man lost his inheritance a squatter come on islam he could not hold it any longer until 50 years after 50 years the year of jubilee came by and the year of jubilee when the year jubilee come along then everything went back to the original at the beginning this is god law god put it in a way so people are scrunting and suffering your your family own a lot of money and they take you into captivity they could only hold it for 50 years after 50 years jubilee trumpet song you have to go free you have no choice so either if you acquire any money you could pay back for your property get back your land get back inheritance but in case you have no money that's where the grace comes in when you have no money you can't afford to deliver yourself you can't afford to free yourself the grace come to you oh god you didn't ask for it you didn't pay for it you didn't praise it you didn't oh glory to god the grace just come to you to give you a jubilee a release a release from your sickness or release from your bondage of release from your hard night and your long pleading prayer and the wet on your cheeks of your tears that you cry any night oh hallelujah praise god thank you lord so after 50 years a year jubilee came and the year of jubilee when that year jubilee come along then everything went back to the original at the beginning all slaves they went back to the original beginning if a man was holding a field and the trumpet sounded unheard it he throw down the hole and say i am no more a slave i want to go back to my family hallelujah he had the right he had the legal right he could tell the owner you can't hold me back because he had trumpet and every word tonight is a trumpet a trumpeter being strongly tonight oh glory to god hallelujah praise god on one of these days the world will fall and the legal owners will come one of these days the meek shall inherit the earth one of these days we will take back everything that the devil took from you you're gonna take it back oh glory to god hallelujah glory to god the other debate he says hallelujah disciples say they stole him by night that a debate they argue and devils saying they're saying that but on the 50th day was the day of pentecost and the legal owner came down among them and showed it was no organization hallelujah listen to this bomb the legal owner came down among them and showed it was no organization that it was a filling of the holy ghost that was god's earnest money to his church that it would not be controlled by organization and so forth but it would be the illness of the baptism of the holy ghost with the power and the love of god and that is why i reject number six i reject any man that's trying to take authority over the severity of the local church i reject it i will bless it or uncompromising with it for glory to god because the church the local church supposed to ask have access to the holy ghost to get instruction and guidance not some man from somewhere giving instructions as what the locals are supposed to do away with that oh glory to god is not god's plan at all they don't have that holy ghost led philip holy ghost directed paul the holy ghost sent peter was no man organization nothing no money go organize no fightful ministry either we're gonna blast that but god have his men somewhere god have david somewhere god have his joshua somewhere oh glory to god may not go cross jordan and take the people over oh hallelujah glory to god hallelujah elijah had no apology when he was crossing jordan he is have talked to jordan he ain't saying speak to children he took his mother and struck the children and jordan know what to do oh glory to god because a man of god come and fought oh give the lord a shout hallelujah praise god we have our example seed hallelujah even jesus christ you have an example son even william branham hallelujah thank you lord jesus hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah after 50 days he said god sent the holy ghost back to run the squatters out and to take over the power of the holy ghost came down and the church received its earnest of salvation not brethren not to hurt your feelings or anything about it if the organization is right and you're just a catholic my organization your baptist my organization or your new message because you're a message by organization and you're like a person in your church he says watch he says joining church he says the illness of your salvation he said if you are by baptization you are lost the earnest or your salvation was not joining the church the earnest of your salvation was not belonging to some organization the illness of your salvation is the baptism of the holy ghost without any organization so you can't tie the baptism into a group to a church the baptism is from god and god is suffering he give the holy ghost to them who obey him oh glory to god to show you the sovereignty of god god sent peter to cornelius house you know the story congress was what he was a gentile he wasn't a jew is the first time peter had interaction with the gentiles given testimony what kind of man was that he was just he was devout he was a giving man a sharing man the man had a good heart god oh watch because you're gentile he watch what kind of heart in that man that's what he sent to get that man that's why he's sending peter from that man because peter was activated and he was part of the body and life had to come to the body after the holy ghost come after dynamic strike you're only getting light through the body and peter was part of that body so god had to minister life out to peter's mouth oh glory to god because peter becomes quite channel of communication for life to go forth so why peter was preaching the word holy ghost fell upon them that heard the word cornelius was filled with the holy ghost and he said what this what is this that the gentiles receive the same holy ghost same holy ghost same penny saying pay that be the jews receive all glory to god by one spirit we are baptized you are gentile or give the lord a shout by one spirit we are all made to drink of that one spirit oh glory to god true or gentile oh glory to god amen the earnest of our salvation is the baptism of the holy ghost without annualization amen they could not hold it back 50 day he said the day of jubilee then it went back to the original and the power of god was taken back to his origin of the 50th day and yeah yeah the prophecy there will come another year of jubilee oh glory to god a prophecy what that is that is grace for the all you ever were gentle workers you know why we walk in the judgment this world under judgment right now all this chronic judgment judgment all over but i miss all of that there's a prophecy hanging tonight of grace coming by the jubilee trumpet being sounded for the living our gentile workers i thank god tonight for the trumpet of the jubilee o give the lord a shout hallelujah he said there will come another year of jubilee we have had it just about this time you know this pentecost failed in america for about 50 years i said more she's dependent began to fail now what happened in the church is receiving the seventh year book of the revelation of jesus christ and not one tenth of them could receive it and then he explains what that jubilee will look like he said when you begin to see the year of jubilee where we don't have to fuss and stream and pull like this we already secured in christ oh hallelujah that's a type of the year of jubilee no straining no pulling that's the flow of the spirit there is my spirit flowing freely oh glory to god hallelujah thank you lord hallelujah thank you lord jesus no i'll harvest time to see this back to the original condition and must have all the word in order to be seed it's not right you can't have half a seed it won't grow you can't say i believe in the baptism holy ghost hallelujah i believe in speaking in tongues that's part of the seed but now they have to be added to that the life so to the baptism have to add seven steps which is the life which is virtual knowledge and temperance and patience and godliness to the baptism have to be added the life which is them seven steps then the person of christ come on top of that because you know become a templar house oh glory to god that he could step into oh hallelujah praise god a reproduction of the original grain the life that was in the husk in the stalk in the tassel all gathers up in the seed and the life that was in the stock when one went to make the other and then he said justification made our way for signification so you can't kick our justification you know you justified because you need a message significant momentum make a way for the for holy ghost and he said and the baptism of the holy ghost made a way for the holy ghost itself that's my body but holy ghost people don't kind of crazy stuff because that's not the holy ghost itself but abram had the holy ghost itself which is the person of christ veiled that's different hallelujah that's not the birth baptism that's the life added oh glory to god so he said watch justification wait for the simplification certification made away for the batman legos and the baptism hollywood was made a way for the holy ghost itself to come down imperfection back to the wood again to manifest itself oh glory to god wow hallelujah praise god listen to this the first exodus from a natural land to us to natural land isn't that right second let's say this he brought the prophet and gone he said no he promised the last days the excess in the last days he cannot change it and by scientific proof by the witness of the spirit by the works of this day the great pillar of fire moving among us and the signs and wonders here we go of the resurrection of jesus christ calling the people from adenoma nationalism into the presence of jesus christ to live wait a minute you mean a message supposed to bring us into presence exactly oh hallelujah oh glory to god you bring you not into a church not into a group but in the presence hallelujah on the promised land he said no watch the promise the promise is the baptism of the spirit which is promised all through the old testament anew hallelujah what is the promise the baptism of the holy spirit old testament and new testament too the promise behold i send the promise of my father upon you peter said it under pentecost that is the promise then you go down further the promised land is to live in this land of holy spirit that's god's promise to the church is to live in the power of the spirit it's another world it's another lamb and brother branham he says we are now living by the evidence of the new land amen the son of man so so so the son of man operating true but william branham was the evidence of the new land and we saw the operation of the holy ghost to that man in this hour so much that they took him for jesus oh give the lord a shout the evidence of the new land pick up the pen and write there and the bride will be so much like him they'll be in his very image so much like him oh glory to god there'll be very we we have seen that yet we have seen that yet where bride will be going they have to be in his very image where is that right now promised lannister live in the land of the holy spirit now peter said the promise that was all along through the testament old testament you find promising up to their pentecost to enter into the promise now let's continue almost done going good tonight oh blessed give him some praises right now oh hallelujah praise the lord praise the lord thank you lord jesus praise god hallelujah praise god praise god hallelujah even believe almost finished now watch today if that light of god that holy spirit ever strikes a predestinated seed whose name was put on the lamb book of life now watch watch watch that seed is predestinated but nothing are moving until that light strikes that pretty doesn't it see so he said if the light of god that holy spirit ever strikes a pedestal seed whose name was put on the lamica life before the foundation was the light will shine you can preach the sun like water and ducks back it falls off but let it one strike that seed watch what happened quickly something takes place it's a predestinated seed coming forward and when that light struck literally rebecca she knew something within her oh glory to god look she couldn't explain it she go into her mind she never saw hallelujah she said i will go something struck her she said watch when that light struck little rebecca she knew something within her that brought her to isaac she veiled the face she wanted norma to do with her own thinking isaac was a thinking from then on and the church itself oh glory here we go here we go the church when it strikes that power of god the baptism of the holy ghost out of the manchester churches so we're not talking about pentecost we're not talking about 1906. we're not talking about them pentecostal he said out of it oh glory to the when we strike it he call it the power of god wherever it is oh glory to when that baptism of the holy ghost is made real to the people them that predestinated like you people here to eternal life see it walks in it what
