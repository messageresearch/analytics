[1:01:11] him God is not using the man he's using
[1:01:16] the word in
[1:01:17] the and the word is a
[1:01:21] conductor of the spirit so tonight God

[1:02:16] jump and
[1:02:18] Hallelujah when
[1:02:20] Moses killed that one
[1:02:23] man he ran straight out of Egypt
[1:02:27] out of
[1:02:28] Egypt but when God chose you for a
[1:02:32] purpose he can't change his
[1:02:35] mind he has to find

[1:03:20] of
[1:03:22] Egypt no no he come down
[1:03:26] get a
[1:03:27] man to go to
[1:03:30] [Applause]
[1:03:38] Egypt watch this we know the
[1:03:42] story Fire come
[1:03:44] down to attract Moses
[1:03:46] attention Moses went up

[1:04:22] said to
[1:04:23] Egypt what for
[1:04:26] to take
[1:04:27] over what is Moses saying now Faith
[1:04:38] is if
[1:04:40] Moses was in the humanistic
[1:04:45] realm he said
[1:04:48] no I'm a wanted man in
[1:04:51] Egypt I'm not going

[1:05:57] seated what is
[1:05:59] Faith here we go faith is something
[1:06:02] that's revealed to
[1:06:04] you that is not
[1:06:07] yet but you believe it will
[1:06:10] be faith is a
[1:06:14] revelation of the will of
[1:06:16] God so
[1:06:18] tonight we are in God's
[1:06:23] Will T we are in
[1:06:27] faith preaching to
[1:06:29] you the gospel of the
[1:06:33] Kingdom so faith is something that's
[1:06:36] revealed to
[1:06:37] you but it's not
[1:06:40] yet but you believe it will
[1:06:43] be so watch this
[1:06:47] now before a
[1:06:49] word it's a thought and a thought has to
[1:06:53] be
[1:06:54] created
[1:06:56] God
[1:06:57] thoughts become
[1:07:00] creation spoke by a
[1:07:02] word listen
[1:07:04] listen he presented to you as a
[1:07:08] thought that's when he presented to
[1:07:12] you as a
[1:07:14] thought his
[1:07:16] thought is revealed to
[1:07:18] you but it's still a
[1:07:21] thought until you speak
[1:07:24] it if you
[1:07:26] speak it remains
[1:07:29] thought God want you to
[1:07:39] speak so
[1:07:42] revelation God thoughts coming to
[1:07:45] you like we said
[1:07:47] before God told
[1:07:50] Moses for
[1:07:53] FES that was God taught
[1:07:56] coming to
[1:07:57] mes if he keep quiet
[1:08:05] Monday if on
[1:08:07] [Music]
[1:08:09] Tuesday mes to get
[1:08:21] courage was
[1:08:24] gods
[1:08:26] mes tonight we are
[1:08:29] backing the thoughts of
[1:08:36] God hallelujah so therefore true
[1:08:40] Fai
[1:08:42] Faith seven of
[1:08:45] faith is connected connect to the
[1:08:48] intelligence of
[1:08:50] God the mind of
[1:08:53] Christ God intent and purp
[1:08:57] purp what he wants done with the
[1:09:02] word here is a
[1:09:04] secret the word is in the
[1:09:06] bride and the mind of
[1:09:09] Christ to know what he wants done with
[1:09:11] the
[1:09:12] word So for 50
[1:09:15] years 50 plus
[1:09:18] years the word have been preaching to
[1:09:21] you put to
[1:09:23] you to you
[1:09:26] but now the mind of Christ went to drop
[1:09:30] down to
[1:09:32] reveal what God wants done with his
[1:09:37] word
[1:09:39] Glory Give an
[1:09:41] example when Joshua Cross
[1:09:44] Jordan the first place God tell him to
[1:09:51] take was
[1:09:53] Jer Joshua never said
[1:09:57] the wall is so
[1:09:59] high the city is so
[1:10:03] protected as far as he's
[1:10:05] concerned Jero is given over to
[1:10:09] you so josua Shar
[1:10:13] sword when he is
[1:10:15] resting he Shar his
[1:10:18] sword all of a sudden he heard a
[1:10:23] rustle his sword
[1:10:25] are you for us are you against
[1:10:28] us the man said I am the
[1:10:33] captain I am the
[1:10:37] Unseen don't tell
[1:10:40] anyone that you have seen me just given
[1:10:43] me
[1:10:45] instructions walk around
[1:10:47] Jero around
[1:10:52] Jero glory
[1:10:54] god
[1:10:56] told the people when I to
[1:11:03] shout what they
[1:11:05] do they follow
[1:11:07] instructions so listen to this God would
[1:11:12] anoint the man of

[1:20:02] unbel Abraham had to believe for
[1:20:06] himself his
[1:20:11] wife before it
[1:20:13] happens you see
[1:20:15] it and then you express
[1:20:18] it in word
[1:20:21] form and the word takes a hold
[1:20:25] and becomes
[1:20:28] material in the beginning was the
[1:20:30] word the word was with
[1:20:32] God and the word here we go was
[1:20:38] invisible until it became
[1:20:42] flesh then the

[1:28:38] well I'm almost
[1:28:40] finish he said the
[1:28:43] disciples didn't have this perfect
[1:28:47] Faith because they had Christ walking

[1:28:53] them
[1:28:54] they could not
[1:28:56] for any
