father ride us into another Ephesians Lord ride us into a super Church a super race ride us Lord Jesus write us tonight in Jesus name we ask it amen and amen God bless you thanks again for coming certainly appreciate each and every one of you if you have your Bibles I like to turn to St John chapter 1 we want to read verse 1 and 11-4 Matthew chapter 24 1-4 and then you'll have your seats so you want to read in John uh 1 oh the enem is fighting tonight technical everything else but but God is good yes and and and we are fighting right back Amen in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and we want to go down to verse 11 he came unto his own his own receive him not but as many as receive him to them he that them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God and the word has made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth and we want to go to Matthew 24 and verse one Jesus went out and departed from the temple and the disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple so this Temple was very impressing the disciples and Jesus said unto them see not all these things ver I unto you they shall not be left their one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down and as he sat upon the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world three things they ask and Jesus answered said unto them first thing Jesus said to them take heed that no man deceive you number one deception before you get seals re all kind of mysteries and stuff take he no man deceive you let's talk about them guys for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ shall receive many you shall hear of Wars rumors of wars he shall AED that he be not troubled for all these things must come to pass amen but the end is not here for nation shall rise against Nation Kingdom against Kingdom there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in diverse places all these are the beginning of Sorrows then shall he deliver you up to be afflicted shall kill you and he shall be hated of all Nations for my name's sake we talking about believers in case you didn't know then shall many be offended shall betray one another shall hate one another many false prophets shall arise and shall deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold and he that endure unto the end the same shall be saved let's pray father we thank you for your word and I pray you would come and confirm it and make it alive make it real to your people in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen you may be seated thanks again for coming out tonight it's a blessing to have you to be here oh praise is God I have a context scripture uh from 1 Corinthians 2 uh it says here in verse three I was with you in weakness Paul speaks and in fear in much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power reason reason what's the purpose of this that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God so that other words that your faith don't get excited about information that men is bringing but in the power of God because men could bring talk and information and think they never hear it so and see it so but you see the power that can come from man the spirit that can come from man the spirit and the unction and the power you have to see that and know that comes from God okay now verse 11 Paul said for what man knowe the things of a man save the spirit of a man which is in him so the spirit of man know the things of man talk about the things of man or could explain the things of man he went to say even so the things of God knoweth no man the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God the spirit of God brings forth the things of God now this is the part I want to get to now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God now I want you to have an attentive here tonight yes sir there's an attitude to want to hear and to want to learn and to want to know to keep your attention that your mind will be strain here and everywhere I want you to be focused now that this word that we are speaking to you is God we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God which things also we speak this is the part I want to get to not in The Words which man's Wisdom teacheth amen so the speaking itself is not in Words which man's Wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth amen comparing spiritual things with spiritual so there's a holy ghost teaching and there's a man's teaching it's not the same thing so God brings words God is not a Trinidadian God is the word Oh Glory to God do you see it now all right let's go so tonight I have a title The Living Word manifested the bride that's who she is years she be the Living Word manifested just think about it now friends oh God this is exciting me not you coming to

head just just banging out like that because you have so much information no you're waiting with anticipation that's what I want I that's why I like the promises until it fulfill I'm banging them promises pitting them promises because I am convinced that God can't lie I am totally convinced that if God man enough to promise something in the word he man enough to keep it he can't promise what he can't keep he's too big he's too big he's too big man does promise and lie man does promise and hold back to when God made a promise but Isaac was telling me his daughter he's about almost 5 four way down there tell me Daddy you break your promise I was that kind of blow mind thing to him because they didn't know that she understood what A promise is about she said what what I didn't do she said Daddy I promised to help me clean up the toys but that's a serious thing you know because when a child hold on to these things like that they ain't letting go you know just put a grip you make a

wait upon thee we pray that your grace and mercy will be with us Lord tend our hearts move back all the shock and the torns and titles let the Blessed Sunshine Of God fall Upon Us Lord and may we have such a great meeting till there not be a unsaved person among us all the children will be in the kingdom of God those here we go without the baptism of the spirit may they receive it amen amen what is the it he talking about those that without the baptism of the Holy Spirit may they receive it father may all the great Mysteries that we are supposed to know at this age Lord be unveiled to us he's praying that we will see the plainness of God yes so that we will know how to behave ourselves and act act correcting ourselves and bringing the members of our body into discipline to the word that we might know how to live in this present day at the approaching Lord Jesus Christ this has nothing to with church membership this have to do with life that how we might be disciplined what for to bring your members in discipline to the word you have to do that you can't be saying Lord lustin alustin Lord help me no no no you have to bring your members the Bible even talk about mortified your members mortify the members of your body in other words bring your body in subjection understand how the laws of God work and bring your mind focus into the subjection it come like somebody have to study for doctor or whatnot you can't be a idle brain and study for medical school and stuff like that it's a lot of stuff lot of detail work whether you going eye or nose or whatever speci and whatnot is a lot intense study to be a specialist you can't um um wing it you Wing the knowledge and whatnot and then you put in operating theater pass the knife and you do all kind of crazy stuff like you know I hear story about a man who never want to be a dentist the parents want a dentist for him he he he go on and pull out some wrong man Teach something some kind of wrong things get Sue and end up in jail and set of trouble and what not because he following the parents parents want to do he hated Dentistry but that what they wanted he end pull out some kind of WR thing and do some crazy stuff God don't want that put some B Kingdom and he come Havoc no that why God be filtering filtering filtering filtering until he get the right kind right kind of son oh give the Lord some Praises go have plenty son you know but he filtering filtering filtering because he have to get the right kind of son that he could trust that he could honor Oh Glory to God hallelujah so do you see the purpose of the Mysteries the Mysteries bring the pess of God in other words let's say the Sip and Seed if we didn't have a clarity about what happened in G of Eden we then then the clarity of the Revelation bring her understanding this is God unveiling the mystery of what happened back there amen and all the Mysteries come to bring Clarity on God because God was too mysterious he himself was mysterious and he he had a burden how do I reveal myself now remember he's not a human we think a certain way we have a certain mind and that why God said in Isaiah your thoughts is not my thoughts your ways is not my ways your thoughts are not my you not thinking my thoughts you are your own thing because you are the image of Fallen man you thinking plenty things because I put all them neurons and all them in your brains and give you all your intelligence and you feel real bright but your thoughts and the expression of your thoughts come from the spirit that is in man but only the spirit of God could bring the things of God so when you hold the Book of Revelation you hear John say I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and suddenly a door open Heaven that's not man thing that's God thing I Heard a Voice say come up here I will show you things which must happen Hereafter I was in the spirit oh give the Lord What Spirit he was in Hallelujah pray it was in the holy spirit it's God Spirit on the Lord's day and God take him up and begin to reveal things to him and show him Revelations by Vision Oh Glory to God so he wasn't in the manifestation of it he was in the vision and the revelation of it so it have vision and revelation of it and it have manifestation of it oh glory to God what we see should make a church that will make a Revival that they will say that the seven thunders of Revelation 10 is being manifested oh give the Lord a shout there's a revelation part and there's a manifestation part the lamb was slain before the found of the world that was Revelation part but he came now and died at Calvary oh give the Lord I shout in the house that was the manifestation [Applause] part do you see it now Revelation part manifestation part how many Believers get caught up in the Revelation part or the mystery part or the Talking part or the explaining part or the revealing part and they caught up and they find that that's the man of the there the only man you have hear that man which is a lie that's on P of hell you have to hear from God the voice said go to the angel who is Brother Bram boss go to the angel who had the book open not go to brother brand know go to the angel who had the book open and say give me the book is only a revelation can make you do that you have to get a revelation that you have the authority to go to the Angel by a direct commission go to the angel and say give me the book and I went to the angel and I took and took the book and do what eat the book it has to be anointed to yourself it has to be your digestion I can eat the book for you that come like you bring a big steak you bring ham you bring nice food or what that and I say I'm eating for you and you hungry say not tell [Music] next the pastor doing on of the church i d for all you foolishness what kind of nonsense is that he he he T had the key to my life what kind of foolishness is that the pastor a t he have all the keys in the church he he he could unlock your life a lie all that is deception and foolishness I no tkey have no key for nobody like God had the key for your life the kingdom of God is preached from here and every man Every Man Press their way into a get the Lord some Praises you coming for no T key to turn no key in your life I Ain loocking nothing I just preaching the word of God preach the kingdom and you press your way into it you have to say this is mine you have to talk like Joshua every place you put your foot is yours no tongue no key Cross Jordan and take what is yours Hallelujah they could only claim and possess What You Know by Revelation is your own hey glory to God what you know is your own you could fight for it you could press for it you could amen glory to God hallelujah oh this is so strange tonight hallah just pass page two now approaching page three so you know we can't finish this tonight prop speaks no one can doubt that the Scribe and Pharisees and the great Scholars of the Year 33 ad knew the exact laws of grammar and the exact meaning of words in which the Old Testament was written and for all their superb knowledge they missed the revelation of God's promised word man ested in the sun there he was set forth from Genesis to Malachi with whole chapters devoted to him and his ministry and yet except for a few who were illuminated by the spirit they miss him entirely amen we now come to a conclusion such conclusion as we have already found in the word as much as we believe in trying to find the oldest and best manuscripts to get the best record of the word possible we will never get get the true meaning of it by study and by comparison of scripture sincere as we may be it will take a revelation from God to bring it out and that is exactly what Paul said which things we also speak not in Words which man's Wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth the true Revelation is God interpreting his own word by vindicating what is promised I believe this Bible is accurate Jesus completely authenticated the Old Testament when he was here on Earth and it was compiled exactly as our new testament make no mistake about it we have the infallible word of God today and no man dares take from it or at it but we need the same spirit that give it to teach it to us am Same Spirit is the part I want to get to [Music] now how we need Revelation by the spirit amen we don't need a new Bible we don't need a new translation though some are very good I'm not against them but we need the revelation of the spirit may God Begin by his Spirit to give us continuous lifegiving and prevailing Revelation then he said oh if the church could only get a fresh Revelation and become by it the Living Word manifested and that is where I get the core inspiration from the bride she going to be the Living Word manifested that's the bride who is she going to be the Living Word manifested so when people have their head down and he spoken with books The Living wordss from those books going be walking and saying God bless you amen and some of them might put the hand behind their back Hallelujah and don't even want to shake their hand they will turn down and reject the Living Word manifested GL we're going to get to it if not today Sunday I can't preach everything here tonight on page three I have 16 pages but here it is but brandham said they find fault with the man who was the word now they find fault with the word working through the man the word what working through the man they going to find fa with that so if you think people going to say oh you're the bride oh beautiful no no no the bride will be rejected do you understand that as Christ was rejected this bride going to be rejected she will be the rejected Stone yes sir the stone that the bills refuse and God going to make her The Headstone of the corner and it will be the Lord's doing oh glory to God so don't believe that people go party and rejoice and Shout with you because you are God's chosen or God's anointed or God called call in and and put no no no they're going to be rejected oh Hallelujah pray so if the church can only get what a fresh Revelation and become by it the Living Word manifested so that takes you out the class of church membership it take you of class of foolish Vision out of the class of foolish Vision it takes out you of the class of trying to impress other people and you trying to please God a fresh Revelation that you come to the place of becoming the word manifested I always do that which pleases my father oh give the Lord some Praises at age 12 Jesus could tell Joseph and Mary I must be about my father's business God have a business inside her here oh God running a business the business of Sons and Daughters of God being restored Back to Eden the business of sons of God the daughter of God becoming to be manifested Sons according to what the whole creation is grown in for oh praise God Hal Hallelujah so listen this this so the Pentecostal with the restoration of the gifts and you spoke with tongues make a Doctrine out of that your light is gone out what's the matter is because you failed to stay with the word God's word were unfolding so we must unfold God's word god words unfold As Time unfolds signs unfold this man is the same man he was 6,000 years ago here we go WR with me a little bit amen don't sleep on me now we we we in a channel here right now we we can't get here man is the same man he was 6,000 years ago he is the same intellectual he is the same intelligence he's the same man with five senses he was a thousand years ago but look what progress he has made in the last 50 years and we could say look what progress he made in the last five years not 15 just five years look at what Fallen sons of God has did they invented automobiles radio electric lights atomic pumps jet planes look how fast they turn in science well this is small compared to what have now we don't even want to talk is talk about 5,000 robots in the mercedesbenz show and any Robots coming robots moving aside and thing pass nobody standing inside them things you yeah this look how Fallen sons of God what they have invented but we are trying to linger back on some old church Creed and stand there when God wants us to unfold the word amen we are living in the last days we are living in the time that God's Great beautiful Church ought to be standing on its feet shining like L Valley we but we are back well I belong to the Presbyterian method this Pentecostal arm this that he said what a disgrace we should be unfolding then he start to say what's supposed to be unfolding God's spirit pouring out sir go Spirit what people don't even talk about that no more is men only talking out but not Spirit pour men talking out watch we should be unfolding God's spirit pouring out not just one little gusher not one little baptism but baptism after baptism not a revelation just by faith or sanctification or the gift of the spirit but revelation after Revelation power after power glory after Glory we should be way up the road ready for the translation oh give the Lord a shout in the house power after power revelation after Revelation glory after Glory waiting for translation Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God do you believe that tonight okay let's hit some something here now when God spoke he separate the light from the darkness God's word separate the water from the land God never speaks a word unless he's got a reason for speaking that word he is is not like you and I and myself that speak so much foolish things God speaks a word with a meaning and something that he's trying to achieve and will achieve by his word now when God said let there be light and there was no light that wasn't God that said that when God said let let there be light and there was no light after that it wasn't God that said that when God says anything he must back up what he says Church could you say Amen on this because many men saying God say and God I say at all you because God have it up and God have indicate what they saying so whenever God say anything he must back up what he says and when the word of God has been Vindicated when the word have been Vindicated that is light so so let's call the unindicated word the candle you can't see with that candle take off the light with that candle you can't see with the candle the candle is to be lit then the light is what make you see so so God's Vindicated word is light oh give the Lord some Praises do you see it tonight give me a scripture the letter kill it but the spirit give it life or light so the letter alone could kill it could sound good but it killing it could be well crafted but it killing because his letter there is no Spirit behind it there is no unction behind it there was no Vindication with it so it's killing the people in the church so instead of people come alive they're stilling dead and then they F death is the thing it's supposed to be oh no Praises no worship no atmosphere and they figure that is the message of the hour Hallelujah that's true you know no fire no Fai and when people preach they say you're excited you know the teacher the teacher he he only reach minds but the teacher position Place believers they so position place so much in CS like they place them position in CS in the message that why they so dead if you preach reation 5 now say you know that scripture and John heard the book he take the book lamps see and John say hallelujah glory amen how could you see your name and not praise and worship God I am showing I am showing you before the receive the Holy Ghost the Bible say said they return to Jerusalem with great joy not with a smile on the face you know smile God said so no no not with a smile with great great joy that bills they was afraid to they was afraid that why they closed the door they was afraid of the people out there to put pressure upon them because they no power yet without power you frighten without power you put give on tracks they beat you up with the tracks out there with kind of like that Jesus dead already you know Jesus not around you know I people looking for Jesus disciples you know Peter den and run pet when pet lick sharing on Jesus he said the master lick I don't I for that but Peter believe the promise so he's in the upper room with what Joy God you promise oh good you mean of all the people in Jerusalem God give me a promise Amen to many as many as receive him as many as receive him let's continue the scripture to them give you power to become the sons of God oh not temporary power but permanent power because Judas had temporary power but Judas got booted out of the upper room he didn't make it to the upper room oh give the Lord a shout in the house but those are the disciples they had a promise of permanent power or resident power or dynamic power or internal power or artisian well power Oh Glory to God oh he that believeth on me as the scripture had said out of of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water that's an artisian well that's an internal generator Oh Glory to God that's not an inter external lit up that's an internal generator Oh Glory to God woman if you know who talking to you you're going to ask me for water oh give the Lord a shout in the house that was Jesus oh come on now come on now you shall be filled with power you shall be filled with the Holy Ghost as many receive him the word to them give you power to become or to add hallelujah hallelujah you hit your faith and you add praise God hallelujah knowledge and Temperance and patience and godliness and brotherly kindness what is that the form of the word image inside of you and that image is what going back to Eden that image is what expresses the Lord I shout that image is what going to express the preeminence of God because that image is what get man's out of the way I must decrease and that image must increase Oh Glory to God give the Lord a shout and now preach back to me somebody I must decrease but that image that spirit that power must increase amen how much you willing to heal yourself to God I'm going to close Hallelujah this is a real chop up message wow if God made a promise when that promise is Vindicated hear it brother Clarence then that is light that's the light of the day when the word is Vindicated so everybody right now at text word we have text here and word preaching word and text but the Vindication Ain coming yet because the Vindication come for Place Sons he says Place Sons born Sons fill Sons speak the word and the word is backed up we haven't seen seen that yet we have seen M Champions we have seen Goliath intellectual head message popes pumping the revelation we have seen that and all we see that is people with head it could connect the head and high minded too I don't know but they have plenty head oh no Spirit but head no power but head that knowledge is a power yeah is not Spirit power but it's a power but I people want to sit down at their feet and bow and listen and learn see if God made a promise when that promise is Vindicated then that is light that's the light of the day so how could the bride become the light of the day without the bride being Vindicated we have a promise and the spirit and the bride say come so God have to identify the bride by manifestation the prophecy is there's a prophecy that the the elect will be called out by manifestation Sons will be called out aside by manifestation right now we called together the shout message called three kind of Believers everybody come wabb being snake crab everybody come out but there is a rainbow trout and miss all that netted in the net oh G that's why you a confusion it have crab ministers it have W ministers it have all kind of all kind of fish inside of there but it's a rainbow trout that God ordained and predestinated Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God praise God just like it have Corinthian churches in the message it have Galatians churches in the message it have Ephesians in the message also oh give the Lord a shout in the house different grow different stages different type of groups but there's a bride and by one Spirit we are baptized into that body so no one Church Coulda could claim to be the bride that Bride is a universal body all right so let's go now so we believe the word of God it is the Word of Life to us if if here we go all right okay if we believe the word is of God it is the Word of Life to us us but if we question the word of God it is debt to us for God has spoken who can he night if we question the word it becomes debt CU you're studying University and you have a degree is that right that come like the ants you know that come like oh not the ants come like the C I'm talking about the chicken the rooster on Sunday evening service the rooster C and and saying well how we could eat better and grow better feathers and whatnot and ni old rooster feathers R say he said the radio chicken going by 4 cents they go and Slaughter us tomorrow that rooster Pastor that make no sense you know he's shining the Mysteries he shining Revelation out how the plume all them hands

have strong Putin still there Putin pu Putin sett inside business now s inside there you think ring could win that war you know what God doing giving us space of time yes sir do you understand that if things heat up too fast bright right make it God given us space of grace before the time of judgment he given us space of Grace to see if he could get this thing right that if he could break into the intelligence to know what God wants done with the word God wants this word to be manifested let's agree on that tonight let's say Amen on that tonight he don't always just come to church and go back home he want this word to be manifested let's go down deeper to be manifested in you in me oh give the Lord some Praises then for that to be so you have to get a revelation of what God said about you that you could anoint it to yourself what did David said the Lord shall perfect that which concerneth me Give the Lord a shout in the house what did job say I will wait till my change come oh give the Lord some Praises it's a personal revelation it's an individual Revelation it's not a group Revelation it's not a church Revelation it's not a headstone Tabernacle Revelation sorry we don't have that around here Eve question what one little phase of God's word hallelujah what did it do cause all this trouble that we have if we would have remained behind the word fortified behind the word the whole armor of God and this believe it hallelu so Jesus has constantly told us that there's a separation and we find the last thing that's predicted to the human race before the great final day when we Ascend into the presence of God there'll a final separation we will separate the sheep from the goats amen God will continually and has been separating separating that's what he's doing tonight that's what he always does you can see it in every meeting he separates Faith from unbelief he speaks out he declares himself to those who will believe him and have feet in him Paul was a nazarit of the Lord he was separated Aon was a Nazareth and the Lord he was separated from his Brethren it's a total separation come please close with this here now reach page five it was a total separation we are not to go back into the world no more or have anything to do with the world but cleave only to God Jesus is coming after a bride a woman a church that is separate from the things of the world or the cares of the world she's separate from the Fashions of this Modern Age that we liveing she's separated from the cares and the traditions of churches she's separated only to God God and God is the word and as husband and wife is one so does the bride and the word become one here we go why why for the word is living through the bride that's her credentials that's her identification your identification not you go Tabernacle that's my church know that's not the no it doesn't matter what church you go to your identification is the word living that's supposed to be your identification the only credential that a Believer has is the word of God living in him declaring that Jesus Christ is in that person yes sir it's so sad that the only way people could judge others is what church is going do who's your pastor depend upon what your who your pastor is then [Music] they they have a a interpretation of what they supposed to be oh they off oh this hey cold man thunder have a talk but brandham I'm something deep call to the Deep you see a brother came up on the platform and brother bar said you are not sick you here for Revival you're Christian he could feel the Christian Spirit you see when somebody serving the lord you could feel the spirit you see a glow on their face you could know in contact with the spirit of God you see when they back you see when they start a slip could feel it you could sense it you could pick it up amen you'd have to talk to me but I know it not right with God Spirit getting cold as soon as you're not following and walking in the word things go I like to see it like colors if the color supposed to be red it come like brown brown vibes colors like brother talk about one time he pick up some but in his car and they spoke a Blue Streak and broke the anointing since after that he's very careful who he carry go people speak things and Chans have loose mouths disrespectful like to say this and say the mind and I hold back my tongue I don't live for my mouth and you know this go you better get L for your mouth if you don't get it fast too and lock it down in other words you want to speak what is Right amen you want to speak what is honest and true if you have to speak up your heart you speak it respectfully yes sir because in so doing you want to represent God I know myself I know how I am and I am I'm praying always how could I get out of the way I want to get out of the way because I would I would affect things it'll be colored by my idea or feelings or emotions or my hindrances or whatever it is but you see these virtues here is what God has placed for that we could get out of the way amen dying to our El is what we yield ourselves to he said when you get the Holy Ghost a light comes into you and as you surrender the light expands what if you don't surrender what if you don't heal the light stay as is but if you begin to expand in all areas of your life eventually it will be in your mind your heart your spirit your body you'll be walking with the anointing of God and I think that is where the bright has in for yes sir when B on the platform and a woman coming up and when she come up he just bounce back like that he say don't worry that's just his presence a presence around him where are we seeing that people talking talk Talking Mysteries where is that happening Where Angels around the throne and the throne is not
