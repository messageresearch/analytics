way in our midst lord come down today and speak to us lord we need to hear from you this morning take me out of the way and be you'll be magnifying and glorified in jesus name i ask it amen just worship the lord right now praise the lord god bless you saints i want to greet you in the name of jesus and it's a privilege to be here in the house of the lord to minister to you today this first of august 2021 and the service today going to be in two parts if i say use two parts this first part i have some comments and something i'd like to share and then we'll go into what we have to share with you this morning so god bless you so i would like you uh you have your bibles to turn it to second kings chapter seven we want to read from verse one to twenty second kings verse second kings chapter seven reading from verse one then elisha said hear ye the word of the lord thus saith the lord tomorrow above this time shall a measure of fine flower be sold for a shekel and two measures of bali for a shackle in the gate of samaria then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of god said behold if the lord would make windows in heaven might this thing be so he's making a mockery and he said behold thou shalt see it with nine eyes shall not eat thereof so this is something being pronounced by the prophet elisha as seemingly something impossible because they were surrounded they were starving they were hungry verse 3 and there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate and they said one to another why sit be here until we die if we say we will enter into the city then the families in the city we shall die there if we sit still here we die also now therefore come let us fall into the hosts of the syrians if they save us alive we shall live and if they kill us we shall but die and the rules up in the twilight to go up into the camp of the syrians and when they would come to the uttermost part part of the camp of the syria behold there was no man there for the lord had made the host of the syrians to hear noise of chariots a noise of horses even the noise of a great host and they said one to another lo the king of israel had hired against us the kings of the hittites the kings of the egyptians to come upon us wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight and left their tents and their horses and their asses even the camp as it was and fled for their life and when these leopards came to the uttermost part of the camp they went into one tent did eat and drink carried then silver and gold and rain meant went and hid it came again entered another tent carried dents also and went and hid it then they said one to another we do not well this day is a day of good tidings we hold our peace if we tarry till morning like some mischief will come upon us now therefore come that we may go and tell the king's household so they came and called unto the porter of the city and they told them saying we came to the camp of the syrians and behold there was no man dear neither voice of man but horses tied arses tied tents as they were and they called the porters and they tore it to the king's house with him and the king arose in the ninth and seventeen servants i will now show you what the syrians have done to us they know that we be hungry therefore they are gone up out of the camp they hide themselves in the field saying when they come out of the city we shall catch them alive and get into the city one of his servants answered and said let some take i praise thee five of the horses that remain which are left in the city behold there is a multitude of israel that are left in the behold i say they are all as the multitude of the israelites that are consumed let us send and see they took therefore two chariot horses and the king sent after the host of the syrians saying go and see and they went after them unto jordan and lo all the way was full of garments and vessels which assyrians had cast away in the haste and the messengers returned and told the king and the people went out and spoke and spoiled the tents of the syrian so a measure of fine flow a soul for a shekel and two measures of value for a shekel according hallelujah to the word of the lord and the king appointed the lord the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have charge of the gate and the people throwed upon him in the gate and he died as the man of god had said who speak when the king came down to him and it came to pass as the man of god had spoken to the king saying two measures of valley for a shekel and a measure of fine flower for a shekel shall be tomorrow about his time in the gate of samaria and the lord answered the man of god and said now behold if the lord should make windows in heaven might such a thing be and he said behold thou shalt see it with an eyes and shall eat thereof so it fell out unto him for the people threw them upon the gate and he died may god bless his word may be seated praise the lord so before we get in the service today i want to talk a little bit about this vaccine connected with the coronavirus i feel i want to address it and this is for this church because i realize there are some people are hesitant some don't know or don't want to know and some are taking counsel from those people that are not doctors scientists or even spiritual it seemed like everybody on facebook know that commented negatively is an expert and um i would say check your doctor but don't take consult from these so-called experts on the internet what i see is fear people fear this jab the fear they have more fear you know um what i want to say is that when god pronounced judgment it affect the righteous and the unrighteous when things happen that is god's sent or god arranged or god trying to perform something or get something accomplished it affect all this is not because i'm a believer or i'm a saint i'm immune saints will die saints will get coronavirus it's not that you're immune what we are trying to say is that you don't have to have a a premature debt or premature sickness or unnecessary sickness now i saw a video going wrong it's producing trinidad and they're trying to say or imply that since the vaccine was implemented in this country things have gotten worse and it looked like the data trying to present that and the conclusion is that the vaccine is the cause while the numbers are going up or the debts and so on like that and so like that but if you think it through you would see how foolish that presentation is and it's as if an intellectual idiot produced it so far four million plus people have died from this coronavirus four million millions died even before they had even the very first vaccine it wasn't the vaccine causing the debt do people die from taking the vaccine of course maybe one in a million two in a million i don't know the stats but people will die that's just life that's just how it is some people will die but the fact is the coroner virus kills now my concern so therefore to say that the vaccine is causing cases to rise just does not make sense but you know what when people have negative in their heart and they want the negative that is what they will connect with every negative voice every negative video every narrative armchair expert on facebook or whatsapp or whatever and they will pipe these things and i don't want anybody push any negative against the vaccine here or anything about the vaccine is the market obese or the vaccine have some um bar code in it or microchip instead of nonsense that is just plain foolishness or if the minister himself afraid of getting the vaccine he had problems he afraid hijab and he tell the people don't take it well i am not authorized to do that because the point about it ready or not it will come knocking on your door i want to say today saints this thing kills it's not a game it's not a word game or a argument game it kills it in flicks and it leaves people in terrible conditions so therefore whether it comes from china from a laboratory a conspiracy to reduce world population is irrelevant i have no i don't even want to know where it comes from who make it who have it i don't i'm not interested in that where they have a bar code and and all these things i find it's just plain foolishness to say the least we all have choices in life i know those who took it with high blood pressure and they're alive and kicking i know those who took it with diabetes they're alive and kicking those liquor with cancer and they're still alive and kicking those who take it with low white blood count and so on blood cells and they are alive and kicking and i'm going to close this part here are we going to go into the word but there's a reason why i read the scripture today about these four lepers it was terrible at that time brother branham said that was dingy faith that is the lowest quality of faith of faith that based on reasoning that's the lowest level of faith they say if we go into the city the city have a famine we will die if we stay here we will die if we go to the syrians we might be alive if they keep us oh they might kill us we still go there what do we do when you are confronted with two evils you choose the lesser of the two evils when you are confronted with things you have to sit down and think it through if you stay without the vaccination i am not even talking about what you have now as the coronavirus i'm talking about the variant that would eventually come knocking our door it's like like a sitting dock waiting to get infected if you don't make a choice get counsel from your doctor whatever it is to decide what you will do you just waiting you'll die or get sick or be hospitalized because if the vaccine is a small diluted version of the actual virus and you can't handle that what could happen when that virus rolled you over like a steamroller so these guys if we stay here you will die if we hung out here we will die they decide to go to the enemy camp and because of that dingy fate got some got something to happen that the syrians took off we read the scriptures and they had food and the man was making mockery of elijah's would perish according to the word of elijah so this i want to tell you now if you don't take it if you take it you might die if you don't take it you might die anyway you might die what you gonna do i wish i could say don't come here unvaccinated i'm not playing games you know that's why we shut down and do what we do because we want you to be alive the devil's job is to snatch you out before time don't be a foolish virgin don't make an idiotic choice what i want to say this morning is this to do nothing is also a choice and you will pay the price of doing nothing there is something for you to do you stay as you are you know what's coming eventually it will come knocking on your door what i understand by data is that the people that have vaccinated so far if even if they get reinfected they are not hospitalized and they don't go to the dread trauma that others were unvaccinated and when you're not vaccinated and the virus makers move then he make his melee and callaloo and he make his business inside of there and then come up with a variant i just hope we don't come with that trinity variant worse than the delta variant i just hope we don't do a mixture because there are people waiting watching you're watching watching watching there's people saying i'm going to church too you know they're just watching they're not participating they're doing one thing they're looking to look in the here and look at the conspiracy my ass is not for that my ears is here dusty at the lord that's why that might make much of elijah because it's also impossible but elijah told elijah told him tomorrow around the same time hallelujah bread will be selling oh hallelujah food next day it looked impossible because the famine was hard oh glory to god look impossible to talk about revival it took impossible to talk about bright revival super church super race but it's coming because our prophet elijah spoke it and so shall it be oh blessed be the name of the lord thank you lord jesus i trust these few words would help you the option before you is to do something if you do nothing that is your choice i did something i choose to do it i will do to survive and to live and to stand i ain't talking about fighting immaculate beasts and the press and he just said that i am not into that i'm into what god promised me what god promised the church what god promised to you and my job is to try to keep you alive to be one of those who alive and remain oh hallelujah until the coming of the lord but auntie could you sing something for me i want to switch over i will get in the wood this morning oh i'm going to live the way jesus wants me to live i'm going to give until there's just no more to give i want a love love till there's just no more love i could never never out loud i want to live up the way jesus wants me to live i want to give until there's just no more to give i want to laugh love till there's just no more love could never ever out love my lord [Music] amen holiness is what i long for oh holiness is what i need [Music] holiness is what you want from me so take my heart and control it my hallelujah transform it and take my will [Applause] and conform it [Music] and control it oh take my life transform it lord won't take my wisdom and conforming to yours to yours amen amen so this morning god bless you we want to turn our bibles to hebrews chapter 10 and we want to read verse 4 to 22 we have one scripture this morning hebrews chapter 10 reading from verse 4 to 22 for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins wherefore when he commit unto the world he said sacrifice an offering or what is not but a body has now prepared me in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin that was had no pleasure then said i lo i come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will oh god above when he said sacrifice an offering and burned offerings and offering for sin thou what is not neither had pleasure therein which are offered by the law then said he lo i come to do thy will oh god he taketh away the first that he may establish the second by the which will we are sanctified to the offering of the body of jesus christ once for all and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering of times the same sacrifice says which can never take away sin but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down at the right hand of god from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool for by one offering he had perfected forever them that are sanctified whereof the holy ghost also is a witness to us for after that he had said before this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will i write them and their sins and iniquities will i remember no more now where remission of these is there is no more offering for sin having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holy years by the blood of jesus by a new and living way which he had consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having an high priest over the house of god let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our heart sprinkled from an evil conscience on our body's wash with pure water let us bow his over to pray heavenly father we thank you for your word we pray interpret it to our hearts lord and minister to your people father minister life bring to them division may be made real to them father come out on the pages of this bible be made manifest and read to the people in jesus name i ask it amen god bless you and be seated praise god i hope trust the lord that you're doing fine in the lord i have a title this morning having boldness to enter into the holiest of holies by the blood of jesus christ i'll read it again having boldness to enter into the holiest of holies by the blood of jesus christ of a subject a hidden life that's a subject a hidden light an inspiration going beyond the golden altar of incense that's the inspiration going beyond the golden altar of incense but a branham he was praying and listen to this prayer he said most gracious god in the name of jesus christ we come to deal with humble contrite spirits broken up lord knowing that we are ready for the molding as the prophet went down to the potter's house to be molded and father we desire this morning in our hearts that you will break us up so that we will be molded into different characters characters that will represent jesus christ take my foolish heart lord take my stammering words and break them to pieces lord break my own self-will out and make a new person in christ granted lord that's the desire of our hearts that's why we are here you promised in the last days that they would comfort the message that would restore the fate of the children back to the fathers oh god let us return to that original day of pentecost let us come back to that great fate that was once delivered to the saints made a great bride tree of god that the palmer woman eaten down bring forth in the top of it the fruit that the evening lights would ripen for the coming of the son of god granted lord help us as we pull together for this purpose we commit ourselves to you we are yours do it as lord as you see fit we commit ourselves this morning this synagogue into your hands lord that you your great purpose be achieved in our lives as we give ourselves holy to you not a samson samson gave his strength but he never give his heart god made our heart our strength our all our all be given to you make it mighty lord multiply it for the kingdom of god's sake we ask it in jesus name amen that's our message part of life 18 of february 1962 what a prayer asking god to break him mold him shape him oh let's continue he's speaking about uh that's the reason that all this snarling and fussing and back biting and biting back and carrying on around the church that is what breaks up the church that shows that the devil got into you that shows that the holy ghost left you now i know that's burning the towel to some of you but it ought to do it it ought to that's what it's set for not to be smart not to acute but to tell you where the trouble is for some day i'm going to have to stand and give an answer for you and the very reason the way you do and the way you act that shows what you are let me read it again and the very reason the way you do and the way you act that shows what you are if you are just a old temper that will fly off the handle just a little bit and get from here and carry on or criticize of vulgarity and stuff like that that shows where it's coming from and there's only one thing to do get that thing out of there and the dove will come back to your heart when the dove went under the ark she was turned out but she came back knocked at the arc door until noah let her in the holy ghost is here the holy ghost wants to come in and that's the reason today that the holy spirit he hasn't gone from you forever is just sitting out on the limb of the tree somewhere ready to fly back to come into you and give you love and peace and joy like you used to have praise the lord sayings how many believe that this morning that the holy spirit is there willing to come and give you joy and love and peace he's ready to do it he wants to do it he's longing to do it and you won't let him do it now here we go i'm not talking to you strangers i don't know what your past i'm talking to random tabernacle i am talking to you people i ain't talking to you people from other churches i am talking to the brand i'm tamaracker that is what the matter are wrong here and that is what makes the dove take its flight just let somebody just start a little something around the church the first thing oh is that so you mean so right then the holy ghost flies away it just can't stand that kind of spirit as long as the lamb nature leaves you then the holy ghost is gone that would repeat it as long as that lamb nature leaves you then the holy ghost is gone that's right and that's what the matter today and that's the reason the people is in the condition they are is because they let the wrong spirit come into their heart into their life we must be gentle we must be peaceful we must be alarmed what a tremendous exhortation bible study on tuesday about the study of jonah the mystery of the mercy of god and to see that jonah knowing that god is slow to anger full of mercy full of compassion jonah was concerned that god will forgive those people he run and in the belly of the fish jonah only bald because when you look up his whale belly to the left whale belly what a situation to be in up down east west north south just whale belly and jonah reached out his arm of faith to hold on to solomon's prayer if my people will look to this place and he prayed and god vomited it out but it's very noteworthy to see because of what was in jonah's heart he was like a postman delivering a letter and he didn't expect the response the people repented and he got upset he got depressed he wanted god to kill his life because he had something else in his heart so you could come to church say amen hallelujah glory but something else is in your heart so just a church member if you don't allow the word to have the preeminences in your life so he said we must be gentle we must be peaceful now remember the dove will come you say well brother man don't tell me i never received the holy ghost donde that night one night when he come in he's i felt so good i felt and so on like that he said but you see the reason he couldn't abide aha abide he was alarmed then and when you become a wolf he had to take his flight nothing wrong with the dove it is you you said you let that spirit come to you did i let it bother burnham yes when you went to listen to that gossip when you listened to that lie when you went to saying well i've got a right to you haven't got no right you are bought with a price and that was the price of his precious blood of the son of god you have no legal rights hallelujah the only right you have is to come to the fountain filled with blood that's the right that you have is to surrendered self-will to god and then god does the leading from then on and that is what caused the meeting here we go this beautiful that's what caused so many strange things the holy spirit will go to a place the holy spirit will say this is not right stop the meeting move you under i will stop it too brother and move right on that's right because you have got to be led by the spirit of god and the only way to be led by the spirit of god is to keep gentle not to know a whole lot let me read that again the only way to be led by the spirit of god is to keep gentle not to know a whole lot oh you think i know a whole lot yeah you get your brain all worked up and it can't even work itself you know all the books and all the answers and all the greek and all the hebrew and ain't got no place for the dove to roost that's right but you know it all then the dove can't lead because you know too much and i think that's a problem people just know too much the bible says knowledge shall increase all knowledge has been released by the opening of the seven seals knowledge full complete knowledge of god people just know too much and they know too much they know so much that fate is missing faith is absent the trust in god the confidence in god and he was saying here praise god that there's only one way to enter in and that gate is called self-will you know he's talking about when god come and fill your heart you see if you do something wrong you get condemned because the spirit is influencing your heart some people say don't condemn me to wear short hair you don't condemn me to wear manicure or makeup and so on it don't condemn me to go to dances it don't condemn me to tell a little lie it will condemn me to play bridge and so on he said you know why you ain't got nothing taken them that don't hurt my conscience you got no more conscience than a snake as hips he said you ain't got no conscience there's nothing there to hurt you but i challenge you to let jesus christ come in there and try to do it one time brother you'll be so condemned you'll be back off and shake ahead from that thing just as soon as i'm standing here he said how did it self-will why will you call it self-will because god put man just like adam and eve in the garden of eden self-will this one is death this one is life what's the scripture we read i come to do thy will o god as it is written of me god put you as a free moral agent isn't that right and you have your will but you have to will to do god's will you have to get rid of your own will to let god's will come in for this is the only channel that leads to the heart hallelujah this is what the only channel that leads to the heart oh you could join church you can join baptist presbyterian we could say this way you could join this group that group whatever group you this and pringleness can come to some medication but you will but you have to will to do god's will to let the holy spirit come in there to bring forth these signs shall follow them that believe oh blessed be the name of the lord the mercy seat now the mercy seats in the heart shining fort his glory in all of his children how do you come to it into that that through these different systems true self-will comes in here so you have to want god's will for your life and jesus he went to his own in the garden of gethsemane nevertheless not not my will but thy will be done and what happens you come to the shekinah glory and come straight into the presence of god when a man is walking or a woman he is reflecting the kind of glory he don't go into gambling dance carrying on denying the word no matter what the people say he's got his heart set on wanting god he is if he's truly called of god then jesus christ reflects himself through him with the shekinah glory doing the same things he did back there manifesting the same gospel preaching the same word the same word being made manifest oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah when we preach a message get into the golden altar that message was showing how you need to have a sacrifice to approach god that's the only way you could truly worship that's the only way you could go forward the first thing sins lead upon the altar sacrifice approved then washed then go into this holy place hallelujah one side the shoe bread other side is seven golden candlesticks and before the veil an altar altar of incense that you could pray that could commune you can't go there without going to the brass altar you can't go to that golden altar before going to the barcelona you have to pass through that brass water to get there where you could have effective prayer through the blood of jesus because to go in there you have to have blood and we can only break through that veil that next stage by the blood of jesus now let's go he's speaking here when the virgin receives the baptism of the holy ghost they said this is a summit this is all of it but brethren that's wrong there is no summit to god's power we move on and on it's the unlimited resources of god hallelujah let me say it again the unlimited resources of god has never been tapped yet blessings and powers that we know nothing about it's never even been revealed to archangels is laying just ahead for his church that will believe oh i feel like giving a shout on that one hallelujah praise god unlimited resources of god that has never been tapped yet blessings and powers that we know nothing about it's never even revealed archangels is laying just ahead for your church that we believe for i has not seen it has not heard neither has it entered the heart of men what god has in store for them that love him let's move up and claim our rights as god open the gates and swing out the welcome mat let us move into deeper depths and never colonize yourself organize yourself and get to a place where this is we believe this and that's all see let's believe this plus how much more we can hear from god and i think that ought to be the motive of every man and woman that loves the lord jesus to receive all that you can from the hand of his bountiful mercies that's oh my that's my heart oh praises now he's going deeper now and this applied to us i noticed in the bible one time in the old testament when a son is born into a home he was a son when he was born he became a son when he was born into a home and the ordinary typical oriental home in those days the son was given a place and a tutor and raise the child paul beautiful speaks it in the new testament how the tutor was to raise a child the law was a tutor to bring us to christ and then that child when he was born was in the type of church today born again by the holy spirit and i believe that god has been tutoring his church bringing it up raising it up till it's time now for something else to happen so all this tutoring is not for us to remain permanent students all the tutoring and teaching you know people say teaching places the the believer and positionally what he is what he is to do what not teaching to teach you what you are but what you are to become what you have to do hallelujah but then that child when he was born he said i believe that god has been treated in this church bringing it up raising it up and it's time now for something else to happen something else to happen the church ought to be grown by this time but many of us who ought to be teaching others are yet desiring sincere milk of the bible we need someone to teach us when we should be teachers and to that i bowl my head in shame that i should know more than gordon that i should know more about god than i do and here is one thing i do believe the bible speaks there that when the child being raised the tutor kept the father posted on the conduct of the child now the tutor in the manner here has been the holy spirit and remember the child no matter what would ever take place is born a child it will all be a child but when a man is born of the holy ghost he becomes a child of god for it is actually a second birth a regeneration that creates something in the man that wasn't there to begin with oh glory to god it creates what something in the man that wasn't there to begin with and when every man is born into the whole soul of faith he becomes a child then the holy spirit here we go follows this man and brings word to god how he's progressing so that i have no really pastor an elder and bishop and teacher and message pope that has nothing to do with these guys this has to do with the holy spirit followers that man and reports to the father all right now if you know after the child becomes of age he's still a child and if the child was reckless never paid any attention wasn't interested in the father's work that child never become adopted to that family but if he was a correct child a good child loved the work of his father i was interested and tried to do all he could to progress his father's work watch then the tutor brought the word to the father and that was called the placing of the son was paul gives it in our galatians the adoption then we are predestinated unto the adoption of children by jesus christ the adoption now this is tremendous because this is the prophet presenting the endgame i remember some time back we were speaking about the valley of dry bones and how god acts ezekiel can these bones live and how ezekiel answered down noise and god say prophesy because these bones are going to live that was the endgame that was the end product but there was a process to get it to live bones can't live like that boner to come to bone flesh had to come to upon the bone skin had to come upon the flesh and then comes the bread so what god gives is the complete vision up front of the target of the goal then he comes back and works out the process so here it is but abraham is identifying adoption adopted son but look now closer to what he is connecting to as process he said watch now now the same son that was born into a family could be adopted into the same family or placed in the same family or give a position in the family that he was born into and i do believe that that is the work of the holy spirit today among the church is trying to place in the church positionally here we go apostles teachers prophets and we have seen so many false alarms and in the message for salaam people claiming to be this clear mean to me that without a single vindication evidence only the mouth saying that and they have the people that support them like fanatics backing them in that position that's not what we're talking about there's not false alarms he's talking about the holy spirit it's a work of the holy spirit it's trying to place the church and he can't place the people first oh glory to god you have to praise a faithful ministry oh glory to god that's why i said there's a fightful mystery yet because they have to be placed positionally in the body then others gonna be placed or give the lord a shout watch and we have seen many false salam and so forth moving amongst the people which only indicated that the real genuine adoption was at hand and i believe it god has to place into the church and that is the business of god not man convention care plays that man some man over man some pope message man can't praise another man that's foolishness that's god's business oh glory to god god could take care of his business he said for god i've set in the church not man set not man appoint not man voted in for god set in the church teachers and pastors and prophets and evangelists and pastors for the perfection of the saints for the work of the ministry for the elephantine body this is this is wonderful this morning i'm enjoying the word hallelujah praise god so watch when this boy become of age and when he was ready for this adoption he had proved the tutor told the father this boy was illegible for adoption he was taken into a public place and was robed a row of honor perhaps purple some call of royalty was set up and the whole city all the people around about seeing the father adopt his own son into the family so there's not a private thing in a corner somewhere no this is going safe look him here this is my beloved son look at another one here this is my beloved son who look another one here i'm pleased to be identified with my sons oh glory to god nobody bring it with no message card and no cold card not that not that this is the father identifying his own son isn't that right he said no watch and when and when he's adopted into the family already a son already a child already a of grace but placed into the family he said you get it when he was placed in the family and given his position then that boy's name on the check was just as good as the father's name on the check hallelujah and i believe oh glory to god are you ready church that is the time that the church has arrived at today that's the next great move in the church is for god after seeing false alarms but now god will place in his church correctly oh glory to god apostles prophets teachers evangelists not man-made seminary born but god will place into the church not theology run over or overnight but god will place in the church as god has chosen as the holy ghost has tuted his church and raised it up and in there god will adopt into the position his sons they're already his sons but whether they are worthy of the position he has for them or give the lord a shout i feel inspired this morning he is nailing down about this fightful ministry oh my so here it is the prophet present this vision of adoption and this is from mexico hidden life and he's going to go deeper now he's going to go deeper in this process here is words now now let's drop back to the hidden life and find out what this is going to require to get into this place of adoption oh glory to god how to take a little walk hallelujah my lord my lord do you see it do you see it let me read it again let's jump back to the hidden light and find out what this is going to require to get into this place of adoption a hidden light we realize that in the old testament under mosaic law any reader will know there were two veils two compartments the setup of god's tabernacle in the wilderness so no he's talking about adoption he switched a hidden light he go on the old testament to address this tabernacle hallelujah and that's what we addressed in the golden altar message the first was the congregation then the holy place then the holiest of holies that's god's house that's god's dwelling please that is your dwelling please and you only live in three room house remember you may have two bedrooms you may have three kitchens you may have them a tree room house but god lived in a tree room house when god was here in it and he occupied a tree room house the body the spirit and the soul in the temporal temple he's in the congregation holy place holies of holies each one of them was separated one from another each one had different furniture in it to show the dwelling place a beautiful type he said the living room is where you commune the bedroom is where you rest and the kitchen is where you eat kitchen to eat living room to commune bedroom to rest the sinner comes in faith come by hearing the word he comes and eats the wood he's baptized into their faith and accept christ as personal savior brings them there to commune with god then he moves into the bedroom distilled quietness with god where all the things of the world is shut out he is alone in the stillness of god brethren sisters that's the place this pentecostal move ought to be today not so much babylon we are trinity we are methodists we are assemblies we are church of god we ought to be alone in that quiet stillness with god we ought to be notice when the high priest once a year entered into the first veil then the second veil on the outside the lever where they washed the sacrifice then the sacrifice was killed put on the brazen altar and the blood was put in a charger the high priest once a year walking behind the veil to make an atonement notice the dressing of this high priest before he could enter the veil he had to be stripped and dressed right to go in and that is what the churches today what it needs is a stripping off of all these cults and things and dressed in the rashes of jesus christ and ready to enter in his walk must be different along the hems of his garment he had pomegranate and then a bell and as he walked his walk was so perfect until the bells played holy holy unto the lord so when we see that natural pomegranate bell ringing in god's thinking alleluia in god's translation those bears ringing holy holy holy unto the lord hallelujah shadow a reflection of what is have in heaven isn't that right when sarah is going back and forth holy holy on the lord he said what we need today is not whether we are assemblies or church of god or oneness or whatever it might be our work must be plain to the public holy holy holy unto the lord another thing he must be anointed before he goes in the anointing oil was made with the rose of sharon and the crushing of the rose brought forth the perfume and they put it on the oil that run on aaron's beard plum to the hems of the skirt or glory to god a representation of the anointing that must be upon him before he break into this most holy place with that hallelujah with that blood oh glory to god oh my this is good this morning hallelujah all over the skirt with the anointing oil walking right living right moving right dressed right and there he was taken before him the blood and as he went behind the curtain into the third room there was a veil dropped behind him that the outside world could not see him no more and every man or woman boy or girl that ever is anointed of god listen here talk about pastor here and teacher and evangelist every man boy woman or girl that ever is anointed of god and walks behind that temple the veil of god the holy ghost puts him in a secret place the veil drops behind him and the world and all the things are cut off behind him oh are you ready church that's the reason brethren yeah we that we are holding up the adoption of god as our difference of life and fussing and quarreling amongst one another is the reason the veil can't drop behind us and we can go into that presence of god we are so interested in our denominations that's what i'm saying oh man can't take no group in the corner and talk about this bride nice bride you only push somewhere in the corner someone don't die bright because you have a bible and some spoken books and talking to a few people inside the bush or somebody in a corner somewhere have no fellowship with nobody because you alone right that is madness that doesn't make sense hallelujah we are so interested in our denomination we are so interested in what the next fellow what is that today followed on me it's an individual of fear between every minister how a minister ought to always get alone to himself even before he preaches before he prays before he does anything he should get along with god in that quiet place hid away with god oh my praise be to jesus he says he say no on the inside of this inner court called the holies of holies there was a piece of furniture set in there called the mercy seat and the covenant was in the ark and the ark had two cherubims and it was on the inside that was the furniture inside of the holy place next coming out of the golden candlesticks then onto the lever and many times people living in god's second room even in communion after they receive the word and come into the second step of receiving christ into their life and never know what that secret room is what that bedroom what that rest places yet they eat manner eating the word they're eating the seals these are mysteries and so on as we said some services are back praise god the denomination teaches the flesh so at the national spirit in the church behind your pulpit or wherever all the mysteries they pump in the combination of flesh oh hallelujah because there is no much spirit pushing that but did you notice talk about the mana now if it layed too long it finally melted out it perished away i think a lot of people had had a lot of cam-ground cramps he said now watch god said moses you make a golden pot and they had placed this manner watch it is always fresh and what he did he places into the most holy place isn't that right and the manner never went still oh glory to god is always just a sweet watch it's always fresh and new and sweet as the days went by as years went by and any man who comes to christ and hides away and the veil falls behind him he's in the presence of almighty god eating that manner day and night from one hour to another hour it's just as sweet as it was oh my hallelujah now remember you said i overcome smoking that ain't what he's talking about there's a whole lot more to go to christianity besides not smoking cigarettes or drinking whiskey he doesn't overcome and selling here at all things he'll be my son obvious god listen i will give him of the hidden manner i will hide him away i will give him of the hidden things the world on the outside of the curtain don't know anything about they they eat manna but they don't know about this i will give him hidden manner i will give him a stone with his name in it you get what i mean entering into the adoption or the hidden place with god so you know what the prophet did there he put adoption as beyond the golden altar into the most holy place ministers of the gospel don't care about your denomination or what the world thinks but seek to enter in to the hidden manner where the full revelation of god is made love perfect in your heart and you and god and everything else is at rest let anything come what me you are hidden away what a place to live oh just let me abide there as the song said let me rest need the tree so freely flows where the lamb is the light and the soul of the sieve never die sure they eat manner out there but they didn't know about this they have never been there have you been my dear brother don't despise my ignorance but i want to ask you something have you ever come to the place in life where christ meant more to you than all the arguing you could do about your church has christ meant more to you than all the world i don't mean from emotion or mental work up i mean from the depths of your heart that something settled in there something taking place and you don't know how it come you are hidden away your whole motivism of jesus christ have you entered into that place my dear brother have you come into that place where you don't care what anyone else says not to go out and act smart but till the love of god is so anchored into you that you can't see nothing else your whole motive is to do the will of god the love of god for everybody flowing freely from everywhere what a place to live that's the hidden place that's the place where we have got to come to my bedroom so this is what the prophet is pointing us to that place that's the place where god will reveal secret things that's the place here we go where god does the placing and the calling you get what i mean not the first court not the second court but the third court hallelujah the most holy place in this place he said they put aaron's rod to make a decision who god has chosen and who he hasn't and that rod was a dead stick in one night time come to life and brought buds brought flowers brought almonds it both come to life it brought blossoms yielded fruits a very typical pattern of the sinner being brought to god into the holy place now remember that road passed over every one of those other elements and it got inside the holy place still dead glory to god so it passed through all by the brass altar it passed through all the holy place with the seven candlesticks and so still then but when it went beyond the veil that two step that third place hallelujah that's the reason glory to god the holy spirit watch you since you received the holy ghost to see your attitude towards his kingdom remember i keep preaching over and over is not the sermon being adopted is the man is not the man church being adopted is not my message being announced god not checking him and saying take good sermon good word good message here deep deep deep deep deep no no that's not been adopted deep not being adopted mysteries not been adopted revelations not being that is the man that's been adopted and the only way he can check the man out not me god is the holy spirit after report on the man on his attitude on his behavior under his motive on an objective oh glory to god hallelujah praise god his motive must be right his objective must be right remember one time but i'm talking about oil in a certain place and men started to say if they only get to know where the oil is um you know they go work for the kingdom of god and they want brahm tell them where the oil is he couldn't tell them decided to dig the girl drip the girl dripping oil they rejoicing afterwards they might bother with the kingdom of god afterwards they didn't understand they get a little in somewhere and they dry up somebody else passed the whole mean well and run by the whole thing the objective wasn't right the motive wasn't right they say they want to do for the kingdom but they have other things inside their heart oh blessed be the name of the lord so god examines that's the reason the holy spirit watch you since you receive the holy ghost to see your attitude towards his kingdom it's been us if it's been a selfish motive if the thing that you thought of has been a further a denomination or if it's doing further better to better you your position if it's to make you a man looked up in the world if it's to build you a big church somewhere some popularity or something outside of increasing or better in the kingdom of god something is wrong oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah you see a lot of people sow seeds selfish seeds hateful seeds what kind of seeds harvest time coming for them individuals saw seeds harvest time come for them i guess tell my wife we have mothers even after the children married they're still like helicopter parents hovering over the child over and over they're letting go at all they end up curing business minding the business interfering the business because they want influence there are people like that manipulative people oh yeah they'll be in church too oh yes one control they want influence over others that influence make them feel powerful make them feel strong because there are people in albania you see and that time god want to have influence but then people's subjects said of the people that is when god said i hate the nicolaitan spirit when people dominate people conquer people manipulate and control people what god wants is the control of the holy spirit in your life not somebody controlling you but the spirit of god controlling you oh hallelujah so when that dead rod was brought back in the presence of god himself what happened it budded it blossomed and yielded fruit showing that rod was off of an almond tree and it was cut off and it died and when god man was cut off from god he died spiritually but once brought into a place of god where the presence of god he comes to life and he yields his yields life he yields blossom he yields fruit he said jesus come to the tree to look for fruit on it is that everything but fruit and that's what the matter of our church is today we got everything but fruit we can shout we can speak with tongues we can argue scriptures we can teach our theology but when it comes to fruit bearing the tree is very lean what is the fruit of the spirit when last you hear that what is the fruit of the spirit love joy peace long suffering gentleness goodness patience it shows many is still outside on the first altar if they can't produce these fruits you mean these are real fruits yes let me say the game long time you know you go to market you buy orange watermelon grapefruit bananas you buy fruits well okay recorder some fruits too this is the fruit of the spirit not fruit of a spirit this is fruit of the spirit love joy peace long suffering if they have hate here if they are holding gods here if they have ought here they do have jealousy here they do have envy here it don't have malice it don't have baccanal it do have strife it do have confusion it doesn't have that here i'm not reading those as fruits that's the next kind of fruit okay every tree have to bring after it's kind but the fruit of the spirit is love it's joy it's peace it's long suffering it's gentleness it's goodness it's patience it shows that many is still outside at the first altar you're still open to the public you're still listening to hear what john got to say about it what the neighbor will think or something for yourself but once behind the veil the curtain is dropped you are hid in god through christ oh my hallelujah notice what a beautiful picture of the sinner lay in the presence of god now this rod laying there it was refreshed it was fragrant brought forth fragrance of blossom and it heals his fruit oh my did you ever walk out in the morning in a real fresh cool feeling god has refreshed his heart fragrance did you ever go into the rose garden dung my place they got a lot of honeysuckles the honeysuckles don't smell much along in the heat of the day but early in the morning when all the air has been purified then the aroma of the honeysuckle let a man be fussing and fighting and stewing you will never get much aroma from that but let him get along with god in the stillness of god every man that comes to the pulpit ought to dwell alone first then comes the fruits yielding forth its fruits every man that stays in the presence of god into this great secret place hit away with the yield of fruits of righteousness peace love joy long suffering goodness gentleness patience don't fuss about these other things get that in your life and you will never get it until you are hidden away with god into that land of adoption another thing we would like to call your attention just before we close look at that light on the outside in the courts it was lit up sunlight and so forth some days was cloudy some days the sun didn't shine at all some days it was dark that's the outer court oh glory to god hallelujah that is where the congregation is at outer court then you go to the next court was the lamp of god with the justified stand it was lit by human hands my god my god did you hear that in the second court it was lit by human hands that is where we argue our denominations where we argue our differences where we split ears i don't believe in divine healing in other words that drama that argument is not anymore holy place that drama is in that second court there by with the argument because that light is lit by human hands hallelujah i do believe in divine healing i do believe that visions come from god i do believe this i do believe that you are arguing because you are living you're eating manner you're eating the word you're eating the books and tapes but it's where eaten you could eat outside you could eat it inside but there's a most holy place you'd have mana behind there too you know it's not you're not eaten it's not that you don't believe it's not having to receive a message or a prophet but it's where you are hallelujah praise god he said you are living you are eating manna but you are living under artificial light that is seven golden lights there artificial light lit by man that's right sometimes the light goes out sometimes your lamp gets smoked up but to he who desires to hide away and walk into the next place there is no artificial light anywhere but dung in between the arch of the wings of these cherubims was a supernatural light hanging in deer outside of fire brass altar inside of seven golden candlesticks inside have that light but beyond that veil no natural light no manlet light no human lit that light is the ark hallelujah there's cherubims touching one another facing one another rather and the supernatural element that is there supernatural light inside of there oh glory to god there was a halo of god the cherubims was between the arch of the wings of these cherubims was a supernatural light hanging in there there was a halo of god that lit the whole room and a man once entered into the shekinah glory he said hallelujah that moves back there in the prison of almighty god oh my the dimness of this world any artificial organization and man-made creed has passed away he is living in the shekinah glory of almighty god oh hallelujah praise god oh a special people call to this thing oh god this is not church remember this is not just remember this is not for church members because you have to have boldness to enter in by the blood of jesus into the most holy place by a new and living way you can't come here any old hou this is not coming to church now oh yeah you could go to church any old house but this is coming into the most holy place oh brother branham he will do the same if he will stand after you receive the holy ghost and make yourself a christian and act like a christian should are you a christian are you acting like a christian or you are just a church member that claim you believe a message and you're acting anyhow towards your husband towards your wife towards your children towards your neighbor towards the boss to wherever you're just doing your own thing and coming to church you are a church member if you want to be part of this bright body you have to be the world to be the bride who am i he said he will do the same for you if you will stand after you receive the holy ghost and make yourself a christian and act like a christian should if you will put your face in god's word and your eyes towards heaven and let your pants legs be bagged at the knees that's praying be reverent before god there will be someday that god will take you to one side and give you a power and a gift that the whole world will know he's been with you that's the placing of a son into his position oh my and i have something i want to share with you and brother kanglia share this with me and i find it was so powerful and as i shared with you i don't know who wrote it i don't know where it come from but it's the rise and fall of the lion listen to this no matter how long it lives the greatest lion will eventually die miserably that's the world they may die young from injuries sustained and defending their pride they may die old and feeble by age at their peak they rule they chase other animals they catch devour guard them leave their crumbs for highness but each comes fast the old lion can't hunt can't kill can't defend itself it roams and roars until it runs out of luck it will be cornered by heinen's nibbled and eaten alive by them they won't even let it die before they dismember it life is short paul is is he has every ephemeral like temporary i believe i have seen it in lions i've seen it in old men everyone who lives long enough will become very vulnerable at some point be humble help the sick the weak and the vulnerable and most importantly do not forget that we will leave the stage one day live consciously many men don't think they have to lead the stage but this is life someday we have to leave the stage be humble but abraham still with tempers still mean arrogant somebody says something about you you light up ready to fight and then born of the spirit of god no god's spirit don't do like that no god's spirit is humble meek sweet long-suffering that is god's kind forgiven that's god's spirit and then baram said god make me right i don't want to be arrogant selfish but the gideon spirit mixed up with mine let me read it again god make me right i don't want that arrogant selfish spirit mixed up with mine i want my spirit to be pure and clean broadly love holy with the holy spirit now if someone does something wrong to me that's all right though i might have the right to get back at them i don't want that in my life that would repeat it again that would repeat again if someone does anything wrong to me that's all right though i might have the right to get back at them i don't want that in my life no i want to have love i want to be ready to correct with love with love that absolutely anchors out yonder for us oh my praise the name of the lord begin to play something you take an old hug wash him up scrub him up manicure his toenails give it lipstick put it on nylons you want to turn it loose it will go right to the wallow and wallow scrubbing won't do it no good it's still got the nature of a hug when you take a lamb and put him in a mud hole he will squeal till you get him out why he's the nature of the lamb now the only way to keep the hug out of the mud is to change its nature that's the only way to make a christian let his nature be changed from a sinner to saint and there's only one remedy that's the holy spirit then you become a witness friends the reality is this not all who profess to be christians are christians not all who profess to be christians have christ this is the reality and you have to know what's in your heart and what's the desire of your heart if you don't have such a desire this morning won't you ask god to create a desire in you god created me a hungering and twisting after righteousness people proudly coming out from the bush coming on from wherever to declare they're coming out they're coming out to be whatever they want to be changing agenda doing this that the other but you have to come out one day if you are a real genuine christian or child of god you will go through let's borrow heads [Music] father god i thank you today for these words lord and i pray that they will ricochet in the hearts and lives of your people i will prick their hearts that you call them to a life a hidden life a life lord surrender to you you call them to go beyond that golden altar of incense into this most holy veil where that holy place lord where the veil drops them behind the individual father won't you call them this morning call them beyond church and maybe just maybe as they sit in their home wherever they are listening lord may they see beyond the church itself make you give them a different view that it's not church you call them too you call them into that hidden place that most holy place it's no longer for iran it's not a high priesthood be anymore each individual is ordained to get into that place you put that place as adoption you put that place at the land of adoption you put that place as the place where the hidden things are revealed and unfolded behind that veil father where the glory never failed i don't want you to take each one lord i am here father waiting on you bless the people this morning as they as we wait upon your father may present strip into their homes and may a realize this is not a gamble this is not rolling the dice i'm hoping it comes out right this is your plan and your program being unfolded and jesus said i come to do thy will of god and it is written of me in the volume of the book here we are lord we cannot make the rapture in the first court we cannot make the rapture in the second court rapture is for those who can break into that third court and your city's self will lord the desire for the will of god to be applied in our lives god and i shared in the prayer meeting that if anybody had a case of complex anybody had real issues with jonah when he looked up was whale bell he looked down all around and he said lying vanities he choose to believe something beyond his present circumstance his present condition and he begin to pray and sometimes the devil want to bind our mouths that we will not pray because of the situation we're in or the condition we are in but maybe people free themselves from that this morning to know as a son as a daughter they have that option to cry out to pray to seek to ask to do something god made it just take the sales for granted or take us a light service or just a few words being said but may they take it for the weight and gravity that it should be in that they should see it that we have to break into this most holy place god in the old testament was debt oh god to go in hallelujah now is debt to be outside of your presence oh god may presence come now and settle over their houses their homes their lives healed the sick lord in our midst father god touched them father those who need healing touch from you those who need encouragement those who fight in depression and frustration father raise them up this morning and may a love lord fill their souls may they see as even red lord that dead red blossom and bodied brought forth fruit in your presence they too can blossom and bring forth fruit in your presence release your presence again them father and it's such a tremendous thing while we don't have five people just five people here or so or four
