[1:09:47] Testament to the new but I'm gonna start
[1:09:49] from the new ending up to the old so
[1:09:52] we're gonna read 1st John 1 second
[1:09:56] Corinthians 6 and Micah verse 6 so if
[1:10:01] you have your Bibles we're gonna read
[1:10:04] 1st John
[1:10:34] first John one and breathe verse three
[1:10:39] to seven that which we have seen an
[1:10:47] earth declare we unto you that he also
[1:10:49] may have fellowship with us and through
[1:10:52] our fellowship is with the father
[1:10:53] there's a little feedback someone is
[1:10:57] what the father and with his son Jesus
[1:10:59] Christ and these things right we unto
[1:11:02] you that your joy may be full
[1:11:04] this then is the message which we have
[1:11:07] heard of him and declare unto you that
[1:11:10] God is light and in him is no darkness
[1:11:13] at all if we say that we have fellowship
[1:11:15] with him and walk in darkness we lie and
[1:11:19] do not the truth but if we walk in the
[1:11:22] light as he is in the light we have
[1:11:25] fellowship one with another and the
[1:11:27] blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses
[1:11:30] us from all sin isn't that beautiful
[1:11:33] didn't we have some wonderful fellowship
[1:11:36] this weekend my water place meets being
[1:11:39] and then we turn to second Corinthians
[1:11:49] from verse 66 verse 16 and what
[1:11:54] agreement they had the temple of God
[1:11:56] with idols for ye are the Temple of the
[1:11:58] Living God as God has said I will dwell
[1:12:01] in them and walk in them so I'm
[1:12:06] emphasizing that walk in them and I will
[1:12:08] be their God and they shall be my people
[1:12:11] wherefore come out from among them and
[1:12:13] be separate saith the LORD touch not the
[1:12:16] unclean thing and I will receive you and
[1:12:18] and will be a father unto you and ye
[1:12:22] shall be my sons and daughters saith the
[1:12:25] Lord God Almighty and then Michael
[1:12:33] chapter six and we read from verse seven
[1:12:37] and eight with the Lord we please were
[1:12:40] thousands of rams over ten thousands of
[1:12:43] rivers of oil shall I give my firstborn
[1:12:47] for my transgression the fruit of my
[1:12:51] body for the son of my soul years show
[1:12:56] thee O man what is good and what does
[1:13:01] the Lord require of thee watch what he
[1:13:04] requires but just to do justly to love
[1:13:09] mercy and to walk humbly with thy God
[1:13:15] make order replacing the word you may be
[1:13:18] seated
[1:13:25] [Music]
[1:13:39] so tonight I want the enemy to know it's
[1:13:44] a prayer line but I want him to know
[1:13:46] brother brems is the weakest christian
[1:13:48] the weakest we're not even speaking of
[1:13:52] the eros yet but the weakest christian
[1:13:55] can defeat satan any way any time and
[1:14:00] under any circumstances so tonight I
[1:14:05] know he's in trouble brother because the
[1:14:07] weakest Christian is going to drive him
[1:14:08] out tonight hallelujah
[1:14:11] so tonight I like to take a title
[1:14:13] walking with God amen and I'd like to
[1:14:18] take a subject fellowship that was
[1:14:21] broken but fellowship restored and I got
[1:14:26] inspiration restored to an Eden
[1:14:29] condition so tonight I don't know this
[1:14:36] is such a well although two hours seven
[1:14:40] but I hope I can speak like you and
[1:14:42] everything so we will have to watch with
[1:14:44] the perspiration when it yields two
[1:14:46] hours he said okay so he says here now
[1:14:51] we we got you got to travel with me and
[1:14:54] we go to the Garden of Eden and we
[1:14:55] looking from the outside in and we see
[1:14:58] this beautiful picture and then I can
[1:15:00] hear a speaking our God of Adam telling
[1:15:03] Eve and then I can hear him say dear do
[1:15:07] you see the Sun is setting it's time
[1:15:09] that we talk to the father so they went
[1:15:13] up to the Cathedral a great tree as they
[1:15:17] knelt down all of a sudden a heavenly
[1:15:20] growing light came down the logos the
[1:15:23] holy spirit that had brewed them out of
[1:15:26] the earth came down
[1:15:27] father God and he said children have you
[1:15:31] enjoyed yourself today
[1:15:34] [Music]
[1:15:36] my so father's having fellowship with
[1:15:40] his son with his children and then Adam
[1:15:43] says yes father and then he says I've
[1:15:46] come down to kiss you goodnight and to
[1:15:50] lay you down to to rest tonight so he
[1:15:53] kissed him on the cheeks laid him down
[1:15:55] nothing good on them he was right in the
[1:15:59] bushes with him the lion and he laid the
[1:16:02] lion down and he laid the chips are down
[1:16:03] and the tiger down and laid them all
[1:16:07] down to rest and father was so pleased
[1:16:12] so you can mention while they laying
[1:16:14] their fathers walking around the man is
[1:16:16] looking in his oh my so beautiful he's
[1:16:20] so pleased and he's so happy
[1:16:23] and we're looking at this beautiful
[1:16:25] picture and in the beginning when God
[1:16:27] came down in the evening and talked to
[1:16:30] Adam and Eve in the cool of the day and
[1:16:32] his great voice whispered to them and
[1:16:35] they had fellowship so brother Lou you
[1:16:42] you spoke on the net the three things
[1:16:44] fellowship eternal life and inheritance
[1:16:48] but I want to dwell tonight mostly on
[1:16:50] fellowship because fellowship always
[1:16:53] brings results it gives birth to
[1:16:57] something I mean so he says here and
[1:17:01] there fellowship loves one another all
[1:17:03] the moving of the Spirit went through
[1:17:05] the bushes the Lions come up the Tigers
[1:17:07] and all of them and they worship the
[1:17:10] Lord man was conscious at all time that
[1:17:13] the presence was with him hallelujah
[1:17:18] then he says here he says and in the
[1:17:22] beginning when man used to walk in the
[1:17:24] early age with God in the Garden of Eden
[1:17:26] when the first man was created in that
[1:17:28] Greek great Cathedral under the palms he
[1:17:31] and his wife when the cool of the
[1:17:33] evening come along they come out and
[1:17:35] worship God had a perfect fellowship God
[1:17:38] longs for fellowship and by the overdue
[1:17:41] you said God wanna save us more than
[1:17:43] what we want to be saved well he says
[1:17:46] now he
[1:17:46] small fellowship than what we were at
[1:17:49] one fellowship tonight Wow
[1:17:51] you came in here tonight to worship me
[1:17:53] you're not going to get anything if you
[1:17:56] sit in their own data you're gonna have
[1:17:58] to worship Him and travel soup with him
[1:18:00] and show him that you love him that's
[1:18:03] how you get something from God you
[1:18:04] conscious of his presence hallelujah and
[1:18:14] the process and even his wife and the
[1:18:16] cool of the evening come along they came
[1:18:18] out worship God and perfect fellowship
[1:18:21] God longs for fellowship and I'm here
[1:18:25] tonight if that was in the beginning we
[1:18:27] had the end again now so now we at the
[1:18:30] end is the spirit day in the beginning
[1:18:32] God loved fellowship now we are the last
[1:18:35] sage the climate's God still loves
[1:18:37] fellowship and he's coming down the game
[1:18:41] in the so mega prime to do what to have
[1:18:44] fellowship so if you know in the
[1:18:48] fellowship parties were raised up
[1:18:50] somebody to take your place and they go
[1:18:53] they gonna worship Him hallelujah he
[1:18:59] says he is he wants people to speak with
[1:19:02] him to talk with him he says you you
[1:19:06] might sing too much or you might preach
[1:19:07] too much sometime but they've there's
[1:19:10] one thing you'll never be able to overdo
[1:19:12] and that is to pray he says here he says
[1:19:19] I'm gonna leave the books arches going
[1:19:21] quickly
[1:19:21] now that the beginning of man that what
[1:19:24] God gave him power over everything on
[1:19:27] the earth now through the fall he lost
[1:19:29] the power
[1:19:30] now we watching at this picture
[1:19:33] something went wrong and then through
[1:19:37] the fall he lost that power then he
[1:19:41] become unconscious of the fact after
[1:19:44] losing his relationship so fellowship
[1:19:47] brings relationship so he lost that and
[1:19:51] friendship fellowship with the father he
[1:19:54] lost that and all these channels become
[1:19:59] clogged up
[1:20:00] and he couldn't get through and then
[1:20:03] losses are reaching in the count in his
[1:20:05] relationship and fellowship means
[1:20:07] communion with God was cut off right
[1:20:10] there because of sin and unbelief and
[1:20:13] unbelief is what in the world of
[1:20:15] Almighty God and so this picture was
[1:20:19] painted and out back there through our
[1:20:21] first father and mother they fell and
[1:20:24] that broke of fellowship with God and
[1:20:28] man was thrown from the Garden of Eden
[1:20:31] from that hour and began to scream and
[1:20:33] God came down Adam Adam we are though he
[1:20:36] was hunting for his lost child now I
[1:20:41] like the swing element he felt God even
[1:20:43] sent an angel hallelujah
[1:20:48] he didn't send an angel in each sent
[1:20:50] David no car came down himself because
[1:20:54] it was his child that was lost and God
[1:20:57] didn't it wasn't against God knew he's
[1:21:00] gonna fall God knew this gonna something
[1:21:03] is gonna go wrong but you see man always
[1:21:06] runs from God there's no man that seeks
[1:21:08] God there's no man that says eyes like I
[1:21:12] saw God and I know God so you owe
[1:21:19] tonight to you the voice of God calling
[1:21:22] you and the way loud when are you hiding
[1:21:25] what are you hiding behind now what what
[1:21:28] more what made you realize you make it
[1:21:30] so there's a voice calling out my
[1:21:37] opinion why is lost child now it was
[1:21:41] striking it's not that God didn't know
[1:21:45] because God created his only enemy
[1:21:51] come on you must grease back to me it
[1:21:55] was breeze back to me this God we serve
[1:21:58] created his own enemy so because now
[1:22:06] there's a challenge going on it took God
[1:22:10] six thousand years to create the Eden
[1:22:12] and his own enemy came right into God's
[1:22:16] Eden after six thousand years and
[1:22:19] corrupted Eve and took them out of Eden
[1:22:24] so God see I must be just and give my
[1:22:27] enemy the same time so he gave him
[1:22:31] another six thousand years and he
[1:22:34] creates that Satan's even so now you
[1:22:37] mustn't be shocked what we hear and what
[1:22:39] we see versus Satan's even this is not

[1:24:41] standing here tonight
[1:24:42] you know where you come from El sudden
[1:24:46] comes short of the glory of God but the
[1:24:49] power God pulled us from the gutters of
[1:24:52] Al and he saved us hallelujah and any
[1:24:58] changes so he's here this contest is
[1:25:02] between God and Lucifer but this power
[1:25:08] is made manifest in the church you would
[1:25:12] me that's what I say we have to walk
[1:25:15] with God but the scripture says I'll
[1:25:18] walk with you so it's a it's a two-way
[1:25:22] street this I'll be their God they will
[1:25:25] be my people I'll walk in them and he
[1:25:28] says all I ask for you is just to walk
[1:25:29] humbly don't bring me a thousand dreams
[1:25:31] don't give me a rivers of oil now I
[1:25:33] don't
[1:25:34] one bit just be humble and show mercy
[1:25:36] and walk humbly before me
[1:25:38] God hates a proud spill it man we all
[1:25:50] know thunder will take short of the
[1:25:53] glory of God how can I feel I'm bigger
[1:25:55] than you make me small you know we all
[1:25:59] see that in heavenly places in Christ
[1:26:01] Jesus there's no big you in Smoky no we
[1:26:05] are all the same
[1:26:09] [Applause]
[1:26:12] Wow so he says you know notice in his
[1:26:19] glory back there when he had sinned God
[1:26:22] lived he also sorry for the poor fellow
[1:26:25] seaman Eve going away going out of the
[1:26:28] fellowship they would have to shop for
[1:26:30] themselves what could they do
[1:26:32] they had a loving father who would take
[1:26:35] care of them but now through
[1:26:36] disobedience got old fellowship
[1:26:39] no more fellowship they had to make it
[1:26:43] for themselves they had to tell the soil
[1:26:45] there to earn a living by the sweat of
[1:26:47] their brow they had to get sick and
[1:26:49] dying in all kinds of troubles holidays
[1:26:52] and disappointments why sever fellowship
[1:26:56] no more fellowship with God it couldn't
[1:26:59] be so now the guy must shop for himself
[1:27:02] oh he says he never had to be sick he
[1:27:07] never had to die he never had a worry he
[1:27:09] never had a headache he never had fear
[1:27:14] he just climbed up in the arms of the
[1:27:16] Father and just like a child everything
[1:27:19] was his and whatever he asked he just
[1:27:21] got it why everything Oh baby because he
[1:27:24] was God's child and the child is an heir
[1:27:28] of all things that's why in Dominion he
[1:27:32] was God's child
[1:27:34] but when it was 7 all of that was lost
[1:27:38] now we had to hear to fend for himself
[1:27:41] and son son broke that fellowship man
[1:27:45] has been tossed
[1:27:46] from he says about from every wind of
[1:27:49] doctrine and he still tossed about you
[1:27:53] are turned out of the Garden of Eden to
[1:27:55] shift for himself and then this in the
[1:27:57] next great time he's still talking about
[1:27:59] God kills some animal took the skins
[1:28:02] innocent blood of an animal brought the
[1:28:05] skins and wrapped them around
[1:28:06] Adam and Eve and there was some
[1:28:09] fellowship with them again what so God
[1:28:12] realizes look I can't leave them
[1:28:14] completely cut off so he makes a tempura
[1:28:20] he's a temporal condition okay I
[1:28:23] strained the lamb that would be the
[1:28:25] condition the blood and are covered in
[1:28:27] skins and promises as he walked out to
[1:28:29] the Garden of Eden you could hear the
[1:28:31] sheep skin eating against their brow and
[1:28:33] God felt so sorry
[1:28:35] and the blood running down dishes but
[1:28:36] that was a temporal position for them to
[1:28:41] come back into fellowship and speak
[1:28:44] again with God and the Fellowship again
[1:28:46] why through the shed blood of the Lamb
[1:28:50] hallelujah oh brother I feel a song
[1:28:53] coming on me he says denomination
[1:28:56] barriers will never work because you've
[1:28:58] got two eases you go to this church and
[1:29:01] modeski nomination education science
[1:29:04] God made one preparation for man to be
[1:29:06] restored back to fellowship nothing else
[1:29:09] he offered to the human race but the
[1:29:12] blood was the way back to fellowship and
[1:29:15] I say tonight in 2018 there's only one
[1:29:18] way back to fellowship brother he's not

[1:41:07] him and says go back to Easter I send
[1:41:09] him back to a event run then he went up
[1:41:12] the mountain and he saw the pull of fire
[1:41:15] with a finger of God might Shh write
[1:41:18] those Ten Commandments right
[1:41:19] he saw that but yet Moses style felt

[1:41:59] day he felt here comes in a week going
[1:42:02] possible and when he looked there was a
[1:42:05] back part of the main provinces what was
[1:42:08] that he protected to Moses an image of

[1:56:54] me free when I'm bound by alcohol and
[1:56:57] my habits and I'm bound by pornography
[1:56:59] and lust and all the world I don't like

[1:57:36] but God comes back to us and look top
[1:57:39] [Applause]
[1:57:47] [Music]
[1:57:51] [Applause]
[1:57:55] now I lived this one I wanted to keep it
[1:57:58] for first but I wanted to bring forth
[1:57:59] before this first guy there was one guy
[1:58:02] in the Old Testament that found the
[1:58:04] secret and if you support us so you know
[1:58:07] whom I'm talking about and the Bible
[1:58:10] says he walked with God he walked with
[1:58:16] God every morning he caught up you
[1:58:20] walked with God he loved in the days of
[1:58:23] Noah but the fear I was right reading
[1:58:28] brother and says his name is Enoch and
[1:58:31] Enoch was Noah's grandfather can you
[1:58:37] imagine so we knew when anak was
[1:58:40] raptured they know I begin with a hug
[1:58:42] and he says Noah was a type of the Jews
[1:58:45] but anak he found the secret and when he
[1:58:50] found the secret how to walk with God
[1:58:52] God says I better take him I better take
[1:58:56] this man because if more people is going
[1:58:59] to find out more people will be raptured
[1:59:00] but you see here
[1:59:03] that type because he was a seven from oh
[1:59:06] my goodness he was a seven from anima
[1:59:09] and he walked with God he found the
[1:59:12] secret how to walk with God and God says
[1:59:15] one day Riley was walking he see the
[1:59:18] Kings Highway and he just kept walking
[1:59:20] and he walked up into clothing God says
[1:59:22] come on come on you know come come come
[1:59:24] come
[1:59:25] I don't want em to find them I don't
[1:59:27] want them to find the secret and in the
[1:59:29] perimeter come on in up on the pyramid
[1:59:35] so it was every secret every month we
[1:59:37] eat there so he knocked new in your how
[1:59:40] to walk with God
[1:59:42] oh yes something beautiful man and in a
[1:59:45] walk with God and his feet he the keys
[1:59:47] our way and it just took him home you
[1:59:49] know he's the type of the pride and he
[1:59:51] was raptured and so will this right be
[1:59:53] raptured one of these mornings between
[1:59:55] 6:00 and 9:00 they say about Enoch they
[1:59:58] say you know he was he says you know he
[2:00:02] was for God and God took him Genesis
[2:00:05] 5:24 that's why I didn't wanna read it
[2:00:07] because I kept it the original Hebrew
[2:00:11] meaning for walk implies of Enoch went
[2:00:15] to and fro with God continually
[2:00:17] conferencing with him and growing
[2:00:20] constantly now we always think you know
[2:00:22] when I have you know the picture in my
[2:00:24] mind I almost thought he was in the
[2:00:25] armored some whether it's easy then if
[2:00:29] he's living in a cave on the mountain
[2:00:30] someone then it's easy but here what
[2:00:33] they say they say he continually confess
[2:00:37] with him coming closer to enemy we see a
[2:00:39] new kind of believer he walked
[2:00:42] arm-in-arm every day with the Lord the
[2:00:44] Lord was his very life so much so that
[2:00:46] the end of his life he did not taste
[2:00:48] death but he was translated out of this
[2:00:51] life Hebrews 11:5 inoculant to walk
[2:00:56] pleasingly before God in the mass of a
[2:00:59] wicked society so Enoch wasn't separated
[2:01:02] he was my defines the people and the
[2:01:05] Bible says
[2:01:06] it was in the days of Noah so that maybe
[2:01:08] knock loved in the days of Noah when
[2:01:11] they were eating drinking keeping in
[2:01:13] marriage that's a time he loved tea but
[2:01:17] he found the secret how to offer God
[2:01:20] he'd wake up in the morning said good
[2:01:23] morning father I'm ready to take a walk
[2:01:25] with you and but they say I mean on they
[2:01:28] soothed what a beautiful picture man

[2:01:35] you know we're gonna walk I mean our God
[2:01:37] you better find the secret your
[2:01:39] consciousness is coming back
[2:01:41] how can get to that level I feel a shot
[2:01:49] on me man you know to Bella come over
[2:01:54] before someone else finds that secret
[2:01:57] and brother Theo says that that vision
[2:02:02] is for a time so take him home and then
[2:02:05] in the end time after many many years
[2:02:08] yet comes Malachi for and it gives us
[2:02:11] the revelation how to walk with God how
[2:02:13] do we change it would make those second
[2:02:16] unknown thunders to keep the bride
[2:02:17] rapture in free will show up to go
[2:02:24] people say what's happening now to read
[2:02:26] to be faith is preparing you for the
[2:02:29] manchild come on young people I don't
[2:02:36] want you something I'm watching you I

[2:02:59] young people and you think we waste time
[2:03:02] to come here and preach we tired we
[2:03:05] really lots of money to get here but
[2:03:08] every time we come here we want to say
[2:03:10] something that will help you set you
[2:03:12] free and pull it out to the world
[2:03:16] hallelujah so he found a way he says
[2:03:21] ordered man with all the same problems
[2:03:24] same burdens we carry not the Hermit
[2:03:27] hidden away in the wilderness cave he
[2:03:29] was involved in life with a wife
[2:03:31] children obligations and Anna took all
[2:03:34] his responsibilities so he wasn't a man
[2:03:38] apart he loves like that one day a wife
[2:03:41] children all these responsibilities and
[2:03:44] obligations he undertook he cared for
[2:03:46] his family he worked in monastery
[2:03:48] occupied but he was not earthbound come
[2:03:55] on now he coming home too many of us he
[2:03:58] said Bomba though we eat you know ten
[2:04:01] packs too deep we want this and once we
[2:04:04] wear that we want that and once you have
[2:04:06] that we know you put in your pegs too

[2:04:53] second me to my father's house
[2:05:08] [Applause]
[2:05:08] [Music]
[2:05:17] hallelujah none of the demands of his
[2:05:20] life could keep him from his walk with
[2:05:22] God in this spirit
[2:05:25] so that's beautiful nothing kept him
[2:05:28] bound though he was the earth man with
[2:05:30] all the obligations we have yet he knew
[2:05:32] our how to get lighter Enoch was was not
[2:05:37] a part of this wicked world each day as
[2:05:39] he walked with the Lord he became less
[2:05:42] attached to the things below like Berlin
[2:05:45] tied daily to this earthly life and he
[2:05:48] was taken up in his spirit to a heavenly
[2:05:51] realm and all around it not mankind grew
[2:05:54] increasingly ungodly yet this man
[2:05:57] changed into wild beasts full of lust
[2:06:00] hardness and sensuality Enoch became
[2:06:03] more and more like the one with me he
[2:06:07] walked oh don't you wanna walk with him
[2:06:10] all right you're the voice speaking
[2:06:12] don't you wanna walk with me instead of
[2:06:16] walking with those friends that's

[2:06:44] later he became so that's easy for you
[2:06:47] to be rapture but lighter you become
[2:06:49] brother sister and you have less of the
[2:06:52] Seas of the world sisters are you yummy

[2:09:07] he's got the people bound but tonight
[2:09:14] they're gonna be set free do you ever
[2:09:24] stop to think what Christ redeemed us
[2:09:27] for he gave us everlasting life he
[2:09:30] brought us back brother

[2:10:12] where's the Holy Spirit that's on your
[2:10:14] track and he's gonna get you oh I don't
[2:10:18] go to home there's so much there that I
[2:10:21] got you on Christ how we try to cleanse
[2:10:24] the church that he might live in and a
[2:10:26] fellowship with his heart is greater for
[2:10:30] fellowship than ours so God is closer
[2:10:33] than your right arm
[2:10:37] you think God is all from you brother
[2:10:39] says these like closer then you're right
[2:10:41] down it's right in your heart don't get
[2:10:47] tired I'm going to close you know I'm
[2:10:48] gonna skip a lot of things and I want to
[2:10:50] wind up I will show you here that we
[2:10:52] going back to Eden and we had I eaten
[2:10:55] conditioned on the earth and God had to
[2:10:58] demonstrate it before we leave to show
[2:11:01] there's a harvest coming and they will
[2:11:03] be the same I want you to stand I want
[2:11:18] everyone to stand I want you to listen
[2:11:19] to this please young people do me a
[2:11:23] favor you're not doing it for moving God
[2:11:25] sees us and I'm skipping a lot of things
[2:11:29] and I'm going to write to the right to
[2:11:30] that to an even condition because Romans
[2:11:33] 8:26 for the creature was made subject
[2:11:35] to vanity God knew you can afford the
[2:11:38] creature was made such a brother to fall
[2:11:42] there's nothing you can do God knew it
[2:11:44] but he knew in your heart is the same
[2:11:46] term that's why when it comes to
[2:11:49] predestination this is not even your own
[2:11:51] choosing no man can come to the Father
[2:11:54] unless my father draws him so it's not
[2:12:00] even your own choice I have the code
[2:12:01] there okay then he says how there's
[2:12:05] something beyond the veil yonder that
[2:12:07] pulls a Christian he can't explain it he
[2:12:09] doesn't understand it himself but there
[2:12:11] is something in that fellowship that he
[2:12:13] was with Christ that's why Christ in
[2:12:16] John 7 is his father he says I want them
[2:12:18] to be where we are
[2:12:20] that was his desire you wanted
[2:12:23] fellowship with you he says Lord can't
[2:12:25] it be with I am and let them be one like
[2:12:29] you on Iowa you see so God wants
[2:12:32] fellowship and you don't give him enough
[2:12:35] fellowship and that's why we have less
[2:12:38] prayers answered the law we're gonna
[2:12:41] yield ourselves he said sister do the
[2:12:43] dishes quickly and once it's done go
[2:12:44] back to play

[2:31:25] brother Brennan knocks on the pool per
[2:31:27] day and I look standing right before me
[2:31:31] watch watch now don't you want to walk
[2:31:34] with me so he says the same Jesus that
[2:31:37] said peace be still was right in the
[2:31:39] woods he says in the next best thing
[2:31:41] when I opened my eyes he says yo there
[2:31:44] was two or three deers right before me
[2:31:49] standing right before me he was two or
[2:31:51] three deer and they were looking at me
[2:31:54] now when them deer ever was shot so much
[2:31:57] it in the last week they there was
[2:31:59] hunters in there and and they were all
[2:32:02] dressed in red anyone knows where
[2:32:03] brother ben says snaps his finger that
[2:32:05] they'd gone just that quick by looking
[2:32:08] at me along they would be gone because
[2:32:11] they don't write any others coming up
[2:32:15] like that falls fullfil full-grown male
[2:32:20] and female and mother deer and they come
[2:32:23] up walking looking around great big fat
[2:32:26] fellows I stupid a little bit and I
[2:32:29] thought this is unusual for a deer and
[2:32:32] me with this way and unlike that I
[2:32:34] thought are scaling I said you in my
[2:32:38] hands you couldn't get away if you
[2:32:40] wanted to but I'm not gonna hurt you go
[2:32:43] on and they just looked at one another
[2:32:46] and they kept coming watching remember
[2:32:52] the first coat ready needed when they
[2:32:55] went to sleep now the Tigers came the
[2:32:58] lion and all the name put him to sleep
[2:33:00] here comes the dealer he says and he
[2:33:03] thought they'd run it says but they kept
[2:33:05] coming he says and I just looked at one
[2:33:09] another and they kept coming and they
[2:33:11] got real close to me looking at me they
[2:33:15] stood a little while and walked up even
[2:33:18] closer to eat out of my end not brother
[2:33:24] if a deer so near and he said this year

[2:33:55] like that and I walk on off and I stand
[2:33:58] and I look back to gain they look back
[2:33:59] and walk right on out in the woods

[3:15:32] said people you know it's easy to think
[3:15:34] if he not wasn't a cave somewhere and a
[3:15:37] mountain somewhere but Enoch was living
[3:15:39] in the world but he was walking with God
[3:15:42] he had to call it to his
[3:15:44] responsibilities but he was walking with
[3:15:46] God he had to speak to his family but he
[3:15:49] was walking with God
