from Eclair C's chapter 11 verse 4 to 6 wanna read Isaiah 55 60 11 I wanna read Ezekiel 12 21 to 28 sit again Eclair C's 11 if you're writing it down 4 to 6 Isaiah 55 60 11 and Ezekiel 12 21 to 28 acquiesce is 11 who is for he that observer the windin shall not sue and he had regarded the clouds shall not reap as don't know it's not what is the way of the Spirit know how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child even so don't know it's not the works of God who make it oil in the morning so dicey and in the evening with hole not an hand for thou knowest not whether shall prosper either this or that or whether they would be both shall be alike good Isaiah chapter 55 reading from verse 6 iike the Lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him under our God for he will abundantly pardon for my torts and not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your toes for as the rain come at dawn and the snow from heaven and return it not thinner but water ready it and make it at bring forth and bud that it may brief see to the sewer and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing wherein - I sent it another scripture from Ezekiel chapter 12 we didn't from verse 21 and the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man what is that proverb that you have in the Land of Israel seeing the days are prolonged and every vision feel it tell them therefore thus saith the Lord God I will make this provoke to cease they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel but say unto them the days are at hand and the effect of every vision for there shall be no more vain visions of flattering dim ignitions praise God hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah praise be to Jesus there shall be no tell them for there shall be no more vain vision of flattering divination within the house of Israel for I am the Lord I will speak and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass it shall be prolong it shall no more for ended in your DS or rebellious house will I see the word and will perform it see it the Lord God again the word of the Lord came to me saying son of man behold day of the house of Israel see the vision that we see it is for many days to come and it prophesied of times that are far off therefore see unto them thus saith the Lord God they shall none of my will be prolong any more but the word which I have spoken shall be done see the lawless ball his heavenly father we thank you for your word and we thank you for the inspiration here we target for your people and your man servants lord I hear and become by the churches Lord may empower us to go as the laborers in your field and this time of harvest take me all to the way tonight I may be glorified in our midst confirm your word with signs and wonders and miracles we ask in Jesus name Amen amen so god bless you may be seated and I've been your greetings and my wife and they had some time and I got back home in Trinidad we're certainly glad to be here and all those fellow laborers here it was minister of the gospel we had to put our shoulder to the wheel that we could press on towards the coming of the Lord our contact scripture like to read you'd have to find it it's on first Corinthians 347 and Paul was seen for one said I am of Paul another I am of apollos are we not carnal who then is Paul who is Apollo's but ministers by whom he believed even as the Lord give to every man I have planted Apollo's watered but God gave the increase so then neither is he that planted anything near the sea that watered but God that gave the increase today my context capitalist tonight and if a title a so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth as the title so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth and have a subject one saw it another water it but God gave the increase or praise the name of the Lord so we're looking forward to see what the Lord will not do tonight amen praise God I love the inspiration they that sow in tears shall reap in joy and I put some time on that that was like a burden in my heart to bring to the people you have to beat reveal you have to be a groaning you have to be at revealing you have to be a crying and sign the message has become very comfortable the message has become very flat where people are satisfied to know that they believe a prophet and there are books and tapes and they will grandma said no that's not the message you know your fire coming your your challenges is coming but a Branham out to face his own and so will the bride he said a private be a hunted persecuted group oh so you mean better over we're not going to sit down on a church bench I'm just gonna rupture no that's not happening that is not going to happen Oh glory to God the bride will go to a rough time well glory to God but we have a word from the Lord brick that his wood will not return void everything spoken about the bride will come to pass it has nothing to do with your feelings there's nothing to do with your emotions it have to do with what God have said or glory to God it has what to do what God have said and one time a prophet hadn't got angry and upset Elijah and my god want to know what's the word for the Lord what is word of the Lord and he said bringing me a minstrel because he in an upset mode and once there's a upset it has to have an atmosphere to bring the prophet in the spirit so he get the right singing and the music he said does hear the Lord dig me a valley full of ditches you wouldn't see win praise God he would me he'll win you wouldn't see rain but water going to come after them don't go by your feelings don't buy emotions don't my your feeling tonight Oh glory to God hallelujah and that's why we had that scripture he that we carry the will shall not sow we refuse the conditions around us we refuse to accept what does around us we're going to do what we have to do speak what have to be spoken and I shall surely come to pass do believe that even you will be seated oh praise God so brother Branham in Revelation chapter 4 he was talking about the cherubims had a Freeman sword the Garden of Eden to keep the tree of the Tree of Life there was a Garden of Eden and this is the gate right here swings out at the gate there were turbines it said cherubims and they were to God the way of the Tree of Life he said who is the way Jesus they kept the Tree of Life and gathered it the way of life now you must remember that there was an altar at the Garden of Eden it's an altar this must have been an altar at the Garden of Eden I will tell you why you remember Cain and Abel came to worship so that shows that God's altar was moved and set there at the Garden of Eden and the only way back to Eden is by the altar the only way back to Eden is true the altar so the way back to Eden is by the altar and through the altar and that altar had to be covered with blood he say all kind of people see it nothing but the blood they had to be an atonement they had to be a mercy seat this is the author of judgment that must become a mercy seat God in this gate so Cain went out of the presence of the Lord from the kid at the garden so the presence of the Lord must have been by the altar or glory their God where I guess in the presence of the Lord right by the altar and the altar was at the gate and it's coach dwelling place and Kim went out from the presence of the Lord from this place no God told Moses make everything on earth as a pattern after heaven so any may make that let's continue and when he did he made the Ark of the Covenant and put two cherubim cigar diac so he put two chairman's like that he made cherubims representing the guards scene in heaven isn't that something there that God the mercy seat where God energy kind of glory where is the Shekinah glory at the mercy seat at the mercy seat is right the God that she kind of glory that there's the but I want to get to then it goes to show that every scallywag cannot come in and take of that you have to be prepared before you come into the presence of it or glory no cord do you get that tonight not any scallywag will access this presence so therefore the presence of God must be accessed you could read the books we could listen to the tapes but you have to be given access or glory to God because this presence is guarded Oh glory to God hallelujah glory to God amen the buff is in the mind but when that presence come into your heart it is settled the battle is over Oh glory to God once that faith drop down in your soul your puffle is over that's why more they can tell the people the Egyptians you see today you shall see them no more forever the battle was over no glory no government so you must be given access to the presence of God and right now his debt to be o sight of his presence Oh glory to God let's continue are you ready Israel was free from Pharaoh when they left Egypt the enemy then was the system the enemy was his kingdom the enemy was external you could point to it you could talk about it because it is external you can discuss it you could share it with others hallelujah your enemy no excuses why it is justified what you do why you do it justified in your own mind they had an external enemy they were free from Pharaoh but were they free from themselves hallelujah that is my easy to point outside people as the enemy it easy to look at external enemies and external and this one and that one and that one and that one but they were free from zero but there wasn't free from themselves a bigger past was coming it was enough Pharaoh test it was that same self that put self-glory know that mess itself the truth the truth and the truth will set you free or glory to God hallelujah glory to God freedom carries a responsibility and an accountability but freedom you could lie you could cheat you could be underhand you could cut off or else you could create your own club to love your own colony or care about your circle or your circle of family or friends associate the wilderness journey exposed that they were free from Pharaoh but not for themselves and then first Corinthians tell us they were all baptized under Moses in the cloud in the sea they eat and drink of the same water and these things happen for examples to the intent you see the people and the message thing that they get away from everything because they are in the message listen it's not like that you know don't have a God of your own imagination you know you have to have a core of the word let me say the game don't have a God don't make your own garden you see like how better than and I'll talk about it having a glut for this and you're carrying your own God don't do that this is the corner of the word the same people that God call out he killed the same people that he called out he destroyed don't just say you're called many a call let me say that again many are called but few are chosen you want to be one of the chosen ones Oh glory to God hallelujah praise God may be seated leader these things will happen for examples to the intent we should not lust as after evil things as they lusted neither be the idolaters and some of them as written the people sat down to eat and drink and plain neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed under in one day three and twenty thousand near let us tempt Christ as some of them tempted and were destroyed of serpents need a murmur ye as some of them murmured or Gloria I was destroyed by destroy destroy all these things happen unto them therefore the examples that they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall Oh glory to God hallelujah they have no temptation taken you but such as common to man but God is faithful who will not that you suffer to be tempted above what you are able to bear but with that temptation make a way for you to escape it Oh glory to God you love him tonight Oh glory to God this is the message this is the word hallelujah hallelujah there is no free ride or Chloe what is the price to leave from Egypt to go into the Promised Land Oh hallelujah praise God hallelujah hallelu may be seated glory to God hallelujah different Colin is without repentance you can't make yourself something you are not but if God calls you you be the most thankful person in the world because he has called you then it becomes real to you or glory to God what attracts the Holy Ghost the character in you glory to God hallelujah hallelujah your power must be from the source not the gift or glory to God it could have musical gift I'll play piano and play guitar and sing everything else that's a gift God give you a gift it could be raw talent playing the piano but if that piano player is connected a source it's more than your talent it's the anointing it's the Spirit of God or glory no God you could ever give the scene that's your gift that's your voice if you connect that gift get a power source the Holy Spirit going to anoint you and take it to another level all glory to God hallelujah hallelujah glory to God connected to the power source then the plane become inspired you may be seated the singing become inspired the preaching becomes inspired the exhortation become inspired everything you do become inspired or glory they're going the devil knows it because you are inspired give it was inspired Oh hallelujah praise God listen demon accustom slinging Birds is not that was this first thing here cuz I'm sucking in things without missing Jeb Bush see the bird get nothing so when Goliath coming inside even its purpose I'll cut your head off knocking him down it's not a problem but the visualize you're gonna take his sword and cut his head off you have to be inspired Oh glory to God you will be healed tonight to catch dr. Cottle be inspired deliver tonight Oh glory not God you may be seated you said watch but a brand I'm gonna him if you stand I love this laughter you receive the Holy Ghost and make yourself a Christian oh you mean we're not automatically precense you mean you have to be formed in this thing you mean as many as receive him that the immediate power to become you mean we have to become in his image you mean as we had a headstone we become in this very image in his very likeness you mean some people will be changed and transformed I'm not just sitting Church but they're gonna press their way into a position where the spirit have the preeminence or glory that God makers of a Christian act like a Christian should and if you put your faith in God's Word and your eyes towards heaven and let your hands let me back under the knees and be reverent before God someday someday God will take you to one side and give you a power and against that the whole world will know he has been with you there will be no impersonation to that or glory to God when God bless you god bless you when God promotes you got promote you and when God promote you no man can be Mojo or glory to God did you get that when caught promote you nothing could be more chief or make what put hallelujah glory Lagoon amen is it my brother sister it may be seated we try to make denomination we try to build churches which other organized people and you keep them it's all in vain until the love of God comes in you want to speak in tongues you want to clap your hands you want to jump you want to dance you want to do certain things and because of a Christian you will never be until the love of God takes over in your heart that tears the middle out that makes you feel for your brother that make you act like a man like a child of God and put Christ in you the hope of glory until the church come to that she will still be a total failure and always will be and that is why the Holy Spirit inspired the Prophet to stick brotherly kindness right at the top just underneath Holy Spirit he put brotherly kindness right there because faith the pull on the cap is based on forgiveness so he put the Holy Ghost right on top of brotherly kindness there is no way you could break out or breed true without the spirit of forgiveness the kindness kindness saying worldly kindness I'm not talking about that I'm talking about the spirit of it may be seated all glory to God we are moving on hallelujah God took what about to experience he was in a restaurant condemning a woman and so God why did you destroy this place if that's the place my daughter gonna grow up in and so on like that and got tapping on his shoulder pulling in my side brick a vision before him so all his sins growing up before God show the blood of Jesus like a bump up Bucknam blocking on sure his name are I write a book right pattern drop in the sea of forgetfulness he said no I forgive you and you condemn her how we fixing that how are you gonna fix this thing hallelujah all of a sudden hallelujah it changes the picture because he's glad to be talking about he said my thoughts and not your toys or glory to God glory to God he said my toes and not your toys or glory to God you may see that woman and condemn her but what is God touch about her you may see Saul persecuting the Christians but what is God talks about brother Saul because is about to be transformed even become the Lord hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God let me season so we can't write off anybody we can't cut off anybody if people want to get caught off let them cut off myself but we can't cup of anybody here's why the spirit and the bride say come the spirit and the bride don't say go the spirit and the bride say come let him back here and say come whosoever will come Oh glory to God and that's right sure they've reflected perfection when those same brothers that's all Joseph when those same products came into the presence of Joseph Oh glory to God he said don't condemn yourself God did this all God send me ahead to preserve life they hear that him without the cause that's terrible if I do you something and you hit me that is one thing but you hit me without the cause there was nothing that shows us and that sees in you that Joseph Cedars in you there was nothing against the brain she is justified she is justified as if she never did sinned Oh glory to God you are free tonight you are free tonight the pride is justified [Applause] you may be seated you say I don't feel so I didn't invite you that stress your feelings I invited you to believe what God said he said my tossing up your torch so even if you don't feel it it doesn't mean it's not so because who he foreknew he called who he called it justified and we justified he had already glorified or glory not glory man you love him tonight hallelujah glory to God may be seated Alleluia so in seeds is more work than reaping sowing is simply the work that must be done hallelujah we gather of the issues in your life you know word said there that sow in tears shall reap in joy is not the tears bring in the crop it's the sowing that is bringing the crop if you try and see you if you're in pain stencil if your issues in your life just fell off the show [Applause] you can cry for months if you don't so you wouldn't reap but they not so intense so in pain so in its trouble so and everybody's not now is not the time to show but you not regarding the clothes you have to be got in the red you know the Bible says you may be seated what a lazy man to see he said lying in the street I can't go on you may be seasoned [Music] you can't wait for your problems to be solved to sue you have to show where they are problems whether you can pay your bills major challenges so if we go now Reviver we have to show for that revival or glowing of God so in as high the tears don't produce the crop you may be seated hallelujah hallelujah or glory to God but there's a different kind of tears though the anguish the tsiyon the crying the travail a soul because you're tired of your condition and situation and you recognize God is your help your present help in a time of trouble and no one can help you but God you smile with that sister but inside a pain you shake your hand with that brother but it's a test in your spirit in your heart in your soul that is what God want to hear from you not a put-on not a pretense but the living reality on Jesus he cried very much then coming to me and drink or glory to God hallelujah glory to God hallelujah glory is impressive how God choose to you may be seated they bring a point of reference from agriculture sowing and planting to bring a word to his people it's interesting because the soy sometime is very hard and you have to break up the fellow groan what your sense put in seed and you brung hard you had had something of the rock you want shake you the off your pride and go - attitude on ship you but you come down like soft and mellow or glory to God hallelujah glory to God Amen hallelujah you say brother oven no but suffering and and all these breaking you may be seated Isaiah he shall grow up these 53 more Jesus who I believe are report to him is the Amalur reveal he shall grow up before him as a tender plant as a root out of a dry ground he had no former communist that when we see him there's no beauty we should desire him he is despised one rejected of men to a man who sells tree I created a grief for we here as war faces on him he was despised and we esteemed him not Charlie he had borne our griefs carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities and the chastisement of peace was upon him well a Branham fought you may be seated he said I always wanted Jesus Christ to be manifested without one floor he wanted to get Christ to the people Oh hallelujah Oh glory to God we believe that James 5:7 2:10 be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the Lord behold the husbandman who waited for the precious fruit of the earth and had long patience for it until receive the latter rain be also patient stablish hearts for a common of the Lord - at night crutch not against one another brethren Leisha be condemned behold the judge talent before the door take my breath and the prophets who had spoken in the name of the Lord for an example of suffering affliction and of patience so Court have been written all these years for this glorious harvest God waited till sit and had his even to call this lovely bride Oh glory to God settlement and God even know God come back and sit and even to get a lovely bride that pride is gonna be there you are going to make it I believe that with all my heart or glory to God so in fate and köppen the bless sir in obedience walk blowing about showing repentance so when we gnomes in the word so in charity there are so in tears shall reap in joy or glory to God second Corinthians 9:6 but did I say he that soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly he does sweat puncta fully shall reap also bountifully Oh glory to God and the Holy Spirit was sent to water the seed and somebody read it that william branham he was good center reach the entire seed think about the Peter Chandler from Genesis to Revelation the seed of the entire Bible so the entire bed would have to be new and I supported to wrap the entire vibe as a seed and put it inside you and I so what put that seed like a miracle under the Seventh Seal put seven thunders under there and tied it right up inside of that on the nail that the devil will know nothing about it silence put the seed inside of you and the devil to know what's inside of you because he can't discern at heart or the thoughts inside aha so what put his seed inside of your heart no the devil can't get inside idea to mess with that seed or glory to God that seed is original that's either secure or glory to God do you believe that nothing wrong with a seasonal the ground becomes the issue stony ground hallelujah rocky ground poor negro hallelujah nothing is wrong with the message nothing is wrong with the seven thunders nothing is wrong with the seven seals nothing was wrong with this message [Applause] that's why I'm ABC's it that's like policy once I'm Apollo's I'm appalled and this easy ice carnal its flesh inside the way man getting in front ago to me affecting the flow of things and then he said one show one reap but one show on water but quad give the increase God is who want to bring the increase but somebody after so and somebody after water if you saw a seed is half tap water to bring it forth let's continue the Spirit of God comes forward to water the seed at this back up a bit you may be seated they don't smoke what is your own seed Jesus is the word of God and he was busted open the life is inside the seed and this life which is the spirit was water flowing over the spirit over the seed of God will bring forth the life of the seed and it bring forth something else there is some kind of see there do you understand if the Spirit of God comes forth to water the seed if it's the sea it is watering it will produce the life of the sea so when Jesus died water was released which the spirit was released because seeds were coming and that water release is to come to your seed so right now you haven't manifested what they're supposed to be yet because you're waiting for the water to come to your sea and every seed will be full after its kind Oh glory to God so he said I believe the Bible is the whole truth and Jesus the Word made manifest he was that seed that Eve should have produced he was the sea that Eve was to produce but she hybrid it by disbelieve in God's Word so he was the seed and the only way that life could be reproduction of life life had to come to that seed and in order to spread out the life can't you see it that is why the water was given to water the seeds the holy spirit that was in the Garden of Eden was the water the seed and that's what we will fight the holy spirit on the devil would fight the holy spirit and fight the atmosphere and fight the worship and have it on the Cana intellectual just talking talking killing time with no atmosphere and the atmosphere made the difference that's how you come to creature atmosphere he said one minutes like a bingo revival if the minister's cabin Reviver we should have it a long time ago he said every five I'll have to come by the people you have to been revival from when you're home some in your lives and when you come and understand by revelation and inspiration that you have to bring the revival not only that he said God is written for the people to call upon God to get his servants into action or we have another big men and big this and big Pope's I message Pope and who's the manager and what not all that foolishness that have to cut out there waiting on you if you don't pray the table moves the way they're supposed to move but when you come under expectation when you come on weekend the water with your praises and worship watch them men of God began to speak by direct inspiration what's corridors men or give the Lord a shock Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah sis know how great the man is an ugly the pastor is and how good this evangelist is and how egregious one is it's not that who is Paul with the bottles one water one sure but his car but God give the increase all glory to God amen let me see that if you want the church start with the Word of God you want that life of God stop with the Word of God accept the word and its fullness no that is where you laughter in brothers coming up you see where you're going after a while he said no watch then the works will be manifested in him at the same for it is the same seed word of God God's Son was his example seed and if his life was when that spirit born after him and his baptism and the Holy Ghost come upon him here we go the very life that he produced that same water in spirit of the Holy Ghost will bring forth the same kind of a life doing the same thing he did if it is the same seed Son of God seed hallelujah so let me say this now 82 so-called faithful ministers before the resurrection Jesus have these ministers if it were them the same dong disgusted in the ministers Association meeting how great day I hope hopefully at Castle mode ever say that Devils run you know be seated you have arguments among themselves one married Communist a put once animal left and put one on the right they want on who have a greater ministry and so on when somebody doing something separate out of their circle they want to stop them just leave them alone they feel in charge Jesus come on dropper a seven seed messes on them and 70 walk away he lost 75 for ministers in one day Oh big just what pastor prophet of Allah Muhammad drop a revelation and they just they couldn't handle it they just walk away 12 remain and one is the devil eternal so you see them 70 brothers take a walk with you also Jesus alone [Applause] hallelujah glory to God you have the words of eternal life hallelujah so Jesus died rose from the dead and when John lean and here in Princeton they have questions shall he live till he come and all kind of questions then get power yet what the guys didn't understand that the power that was given to these guys was temporary power it wasn't permanent power it wasn't resident power these guys were preaching cosmo devils having gifts of in science having wonders and was temporary because when the epileptic spirit came down the couldn't acid oh but he's brown say here come of a live voice here come Jesus come off the mountain and here were seven living voices when that Devil see that voice is coming on because I'm voice is a slash them voice is the sweet without using words [Applause] when them devil saw that life walking they began to tremble one time or glory of God and he talked about the bride they're gonna have live voices they're gonna have the voices I gotta shake the devil's Kingdom [Applause] maybe season so after Jesus openly understandin open up the world to them and said you shall receive the promise of my father Terry in the siege of Jerusalem until you be endued with an anointing that's not descriptors until you be endued with the atmosphere then the descriptors until you be endued with power from on high but what is do things along if reinforced in this place the paw of the water will build a whole big stream a river that result it will sweep sickness out oh yeah yeah the power oh no Gordon want to offer and show you want to chase and do it power how me along with you sit down a minute Oh hallelujah so when in the upper room now Holy Ghost came upon them they got permanent power resident power artesian well power he that believeth on me out of his belly shall flow rivers of water hallelujah hallelujah notice you may be seated when Peter mentally get caught beautiful and he Solomon all crippled up and this apostle put his hands to look for some money and he was broke say no your father could have broken apostles he had known IRA to give that man he had no pause or us to give that man he was broke it's a a he's going to them something you know if he had it so any research pocket oh my goodness my you feeling embarrassed I can't find nothing that you sell I'm going on but but but but but [Applause] such as I have I give to you rise up and walk when that man start to walk and jump and leap nobody can see that not happening no no no God will make it be known God will shake it in front of the world he going to jam the mouth of the critics critics mock will be stopped because the prior beyond Northland Commission we know who we are Oh Gloria God gives a lot some prisons so there's a five for ministry yet um people fighting not because a priest so long maybe season fighting that preacher I've long ministry so much of years all they're doing that God test them if they believe the Prophet they identify with the message but in message day for them yet men identify with the message but some point in time cord gonna be get the step and identify himself with you this is my son I am with him I'm anointed here devil you could watch him but you can't touch him because he is my man that I put on the earth okay the Lord a shout does that does that sound familiar you may be seated when the devil walking to and fro all healed because he's a busybody just yes you Jesse right knowing nothing like GTECH he take a break he going somewhere else but he going someone a country right now these songs have got an atmosphere here we worship in a la king God said have you considered myself and joke he said no I didn't think more a man drops it the gods it is none like him you know he is one of the kind on job living a normal life in Jordan the Lord in heaven God seen that man watch him there was a gimmick racket him give not chance at him Oh hallelujah and when God let that devil loose on him club was able to stand the test he said the Lord gives the Lord taketh away let's add be the name of the Lord you're not gonna get me to kill squad Oh put the test and God blessed job and keep good double for his trouble Oh glory to God on when we stand that test going for the best you let them laugh let them criticize sure they not sow in tears shall reap in joy or glory no God Amen hallelujah Oh glory to God just a little more oh my this one this one is something special to me once I remembers Allah be seated I remember seen a year and six months in the book of Revelation and that is what I been teaching I love I just love teaching I think it's wonderful it gives the basis and settles the church no in preaching now there are some people are preachers they can pick up the word with inspiration and sweet audiences that is watering the seeds that the teacher has taught [Applause] they're not soup so if we don't have an understanding of how the gifts operate we could mystic things so the teacher brings the seed and a lot of people like the books and said you know the teacher positionally pleases you cobra I said that and the preacher the Evangelist is preach to a mine or something like that so they're making mockery and front of preachers and they have an affinity and a Cruces that I want to teach us but my question is what are you being pleased for if the teacher is placing you and I then you have to be placed for to receive power not place place that's my son I'm citizenship so that night nada placed the teachers kneel them into the place they can't move right now D taking notes in there please when they supposed to listen to tape for my right ear nose and worship God and create the atmosphere they place [Applause] we had 50 years of work mystery mystery mystery mystery si si si where are the preachers to bring the water to the very seed one soul but God gonna give the increase my my my hallelujah may be seated I know brethren who like to see Baran say and he's almost like a mockery he's a he's a very forceful speaker and he just rocked back on a soft and a teaching and a teaching but when when I preach I come he's a very forceful you know but Rama wasn't like that good he was the Prophet [Music] yeah yeah ah prophets prophesy let's continue an increasing there are some people that are preachers they can pick up the word with inspiration and straight out there in places that's water in the seas that the teacher has taught now you got to put some Syrian first and then water it and the watering comes from the preaching of the word I want to hear bigger even than that because if you want I could come back and teach you know I can rock back and teach teach or preach alright here we go I just teasin now watch there's a vast difference between a teacher and a preacher it is two different gifts of the Spirit altogether and as I humbly say this I have a gift of either he was a prophet he said no preacher I have no teacher but he he don't have the gift of either by two different gifts so do we get at church Mary's belief and I believe you notice one know Mary could have waited till she had some kind of sign that she was going to be mother and you could read after the meeting is over until you feel that you could move your crippled leg or a little better you could hear or that deaf air or cancer seemed to be it wasn't burn you so much that is not taking God at His Word to take God at His Word is the here's word accepted and stopped rejoicing in it your rejoice is evidence that you have to take one of this world because faith is the substance of what you open for it's the evidence of what you have not seen so once I receive it because the hallelujah tonkin Lord have a healing me tonight thank you for the literally risen night glory hallelujah I'm somebody next to you don't know why you choking hallelujah because you saying hallelujah any hope you tell your feelings you tell feelings up as you want but my hallelujah are standing up my hallelujah putting my hands in the air my hallelujah we'll give God praise [Applause] let me see that Oh blowing they're gone want me long image mm sees it no watch so that's not taking go to his word to take God at His Word is to hear his word accept it on some free choice Internet we can see 500 rush to the altar tonight which would be a good sign that Rivera's gonna break we don't have to have family altar we just take God's word for it start with Jason and something will happen God brings the word to life as we water it with praises oh you mean your water the world praises you mean the preacher preacher water and you want to also you mean that is why we go to Revelation 5 all in heaven cream Scott do you mean that is why we going to Revelation 5 when the lamb took the book yadda forgive me you may be seated I could never understand churches that claim to believe but a Branham on the Seas and so on and the can worship and John types the bride I'm John was weeping he was saved he was an atmosphere heavenly places and he was weeping because no manners from worthy I went the lamp of the book as we will say John that the get on bag John's had a shout don't start the prince court he's at all in heaven all over here [Applause] in every season so what you think happened in the upper room let me see them oh you mean Holy Ghost doesn't along on dry let me season those ministers don't know we're talking about you ever go by the altar and pray for somebody who dead on your laid hands and praying and praying praying I pushed them moving in on they don't even know why they're by the altar when somebody in the spirit and you come and in spirit you lay hands upon them something began to move that's something different so when Jesus told them bye-bye and they went in the upper room the Bible said they were in the upper room praising and blessing God continually it was not part-time praise it was a full-time pray [Applause] Mary was prison John was prison he's crazy they're all crazy because they were created [Applause] because prison is the water Olufsen element my God my God my God my God another not caught it may be seated but Urbano says there were dry seeds and they haul themselves up in the upper room is it what I said they were dry seeds and I gotta wait until the water break and he said when the water break upon them the seeds began to grow and the upper room didn't have enough room because it's not a spread out no my god they saw the walk a junkman sitting out there boy they couldn't walk in a straight line nobody was out of walking no no no no they didn't walk on your home

that we will keep this under the thumbs look at the Lord our show [Applause] my my my my my hallelujah hallelujah what were you doing in the upper room but a parent said they were watering the
