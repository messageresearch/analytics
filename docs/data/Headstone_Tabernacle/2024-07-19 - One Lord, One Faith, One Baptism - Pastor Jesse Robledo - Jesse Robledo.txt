God bless you brother Roland and brother mzc is here also God bless you and brother Norris is here with us tonight God bless you again praise the Lord okay so before our speaker comes tonight is brother Jess roblo from New York uh brother y will come and bring a greeting and bless you I want to read a scripture uh you can have your seats from 1 Corinthians chapter 1 verse 22 says for the Jews require sign and the Greeks seek after wisdom but we preach Christ crucified under the Jews as stumbling block unto the Greeks foolishness but unto them which are called both Jews and Greeks Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God because the foolishness of God is wiser than men and the weakness of God is stronger than men for you see your calling Brethren listen how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called but God had chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise God had chosen the weak things of of the world to confound the things which are Mighty and the Bas things of the world and things which are despised had God chosen ye and things which are not to bring to not things that are purpose that no flesh should glory in his presence so God is in this overthrowing of the flesh King that no flesh will glory in his presence and one more scripture 2 Corinthians 5:16 says wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh ye though we have known Christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more so the high calling for us is to know no man after the flesh because Satan's spirit is really the church and the bride spirit is really the word okay amen praise be to Nick Jesus amen so therefore the enemy is really the human mind reason like brother Stephan is talking about uh this morning but God's spirit want you is another realm and God want to break you and I in another realm so we come to get into The Graces of God that God could bless us isn't that right so tonight praise God we want to invite our brother let's play a song praise God Amazing Grace how sweet the song is the grace of God friends that we in this end time message is the grace of God and that's why when we don't give God praise God have a problem with that because Satan wanted Glory Satan wanted praise when we come we come to worship Him in spirit and Truth Jesus said we know what we worship we know why we worship we know who we worship so turn around and greet somebody in Jesus name amen send [Music] Grace how sweet love the sound that SA [Music] like me Lord was now I found I was blind but now I see to many dangerous toys and snares my Lord through men God many D and SN I become this grace that brought me save us far that brought me sa that's and great Hallelujah me keep on playing it's a blessing for me to have brother y to greet you you represent another generation you re another stage of this journey I'm happy to be identified with him God bless him my brother praise the Lord hallelujah amen amen amen amen amen amen amen to God we give the glory amen and amen greetings in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is a blessing to be with you all again this afternoon all the lovely faces from Nigeria and all over those from Trinidad we greet you all we love you all with the love of the Lord hallelujah amen amen amen amen so we just here to bring a little greetings uh we certainly enjoy the service This Afternoon brother Stephan taking us into Psalm 23 and into another Realm by God's grace I believe our cup running over already by God's grace Hallelujah so I'll just read a portion of scripture familiar scripture to the bride in this end time Malachi chapter 4 it says for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud day all that do wickedly shall be stubbled and the day that cometh shall burn them up said the Lord of hosts and it shall leave them neither root nor Branch but unto you you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and he shall go forth and grow as the calves of the stall and ye shall tread down the wicked and for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet in the day that I shall do this said the Lord so we know that is future Hallelujah remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him in Horeb and for all Israel with the statutes and judgments behold I will send Elijah hallu this is our our Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to their fathers least I come and smite the Earth with a curse may the Lord Jesus add His blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated thanks to brother Tio for giving us the opportunity brother Isaac to be here with you all this afternoon and you know I just want to look at this bride here in this end time uh under this Elijah's Ministry because uh we saw Elijah stepped into the Bible uh on in a time where Ahab was on the throne and he got married to this woman called Jezebel of which we know that Union wasn't the way that uh God's thoughts was never unbeliever should marry a Believer under no circumstance and here it is we saw this woman whose father was a murderer who got the thron by murder entered into this Kingdom through marriage and as soon as she came in idolatry began in Israel Hallelujah it was in a moment like that in the Pinnacle of their idolatry that God sent Elijah we don't know where he came from we don't know his father his mother a man in camel skin and he came with th said the Lord and Elijah's message brother he had power over n he had power to shut the Heavens that it rained not in the day of his prophecy no one could stop him no one could stop his word he had the word of the Lord For That season now when Elijah performed that prophecy there and he stopped up the heaven that was for a reason God had a people in mind he had a bride in mind in that day it's the same thing God sent us Elijah in this hour and it's for a reason he has you on his mind if you would notice after God sent Elijah in the provided place and give R him to feed him brother God was ordaining God had ordained a widow woman when the farming started her Barrel was full God didn't sent Elijah to her at that time he wait till the barrel reached to the bottom Hallelujah because Faith had to be expressed Hallelujah she had to be a replica of who he is her message was sent for her Hallelujah so this bride is caught under the tple Hallelujah we are rainbow CHS in this hour when the the angel was given the Prophet The Vision with the third pull it wasn't uh sardine or it was rainbow CH and to catch that you had to go way out first pull is okay second is okay but we want Hallelujah the inside chamber Hallelujah where the glories never fail so that woman when the barrel reach to the bottom is when he came to her Hallelujah so the supernatural was manifest between her and Elijah on a daily basis she knew the mixture between the oil and the meal the Holy Spirit and the word and she know how to put it on the cross Hallelujah to preserve life in this hour now when that took place in Elijah's day it was a constant Supernatural when Elijah left that house brother he went to mount carel for The Showdown we know OB and the whole story but the the climax of that period of plague upon the Earth ended in a showdown God's thoughts was to elevate his Prophet Hallelujah if you can't receive who I send you can't receive me so at the end on The Showdown on the mountain Elijah after he reped all the Altar and we understand everything he said Lord let them know that I've done this at your command Hallelujah so God show him something he walked into the vision and the fire fell there wasn't a custom with fire Hallelujah the be worship cannot produce the fire we have here hallelujah glory be to God in here the fire consumed the sacrifice and the people cried the Lord he is Goden he said if God is God then we had to get rid of these false prophets they took them down to the brook and they slay them Hallelujah by the Brook great things take place Hallelujah but what I want you to see is that in the midst of all of that the people turn back to God that got Jezebel angry that's right before she was married but she didn't do anything when that took place she got angry and you know what Jezebel did she said I'm going to kill Elijah she came against the servant and brother if woman don't get you popularity brother of the government Hallelujah tax case start you had to be on the run but God waiting for him in a cave to give him a commission Hallelujah that took place Jezebel came on the scene we started to hear a voice what took place after that is that there was a brother in Elijah's days called nebot and nebot had a Vineyard he had an inheritance he searched his name on the abstract and he realized he was connected to death before the foundation of the world Hallelujah he stood for a certain faith and Jezebel was the one to organize the slaying the to matter neighor Hallelujah so she came after the messenger first and then she came after his bride Hallelujah but the scripture said touch not my un anointed and do my prophets no when she came against the bride Hallelujah that moved the hand of God she wasn't judged God's thoughts towards her wasn't expressed until she touched his bride Hallelujah so when Ahab went down to possess the vineyard of nebot the eagle came down Hallelujah he's watching over us the eagle came down brother and he prophesied Judgment of on that hallelujah what is that Revelation 18 the Earth was lighted with his glory he came down and he said Babylon the great is Fallen isn't that right there's one Prophet that did that in our day that was elishah before the coming of the great and terrible day of the Lord and He pronounced judgment on that sister and you know what took place when Elijah pronounced the Judgment she didn't die then you know Elijah went up into the Chariot of fire and she remained but as under the ministry after Elijah the Judgment came Hallelujah the bride under her messenger is the final voice to the final age so if you notice Revelation 18 another Mighty angel came down the Earth was lighted with his glory and then he start to call a Bride outall come out not of him Hallelujah Babylon will normally rulle by men yeah Nero and all of them Roman so that whole system it really move to a woman dominating which the woman is on display on the end time here woman show us the church it show us where we are when God wanted to show the prophet hell he show him a woman souls in prison is woman when you want to show him beyond the curtain of time it's woman Hallelujah so woman show us where we are come out not of him but come out of her my people hallelujah so there's a bride that came out of that system under Elijah's Ministry and if you notice when God was ready to judge that system because that system is what is coming against us that system is what will close meetings like these but when God was ready to judge that system he had a man called ju Hallelujah glory be to God J didn't come on foot but J came and a horseback yeah glory be to God that's Revelation 19 because Heavens was open and we saw armies coming down is someone on a horseback to declare judgment upon that wh Rejoice over her when ju came to the wall you had some Uno inside Jezebel paint up her face she put her head out the window that could not that couldn't stop the wrath of God God came to avenge the blood God watched through seven Church ages he watched all the Dark Ages he watched all the pollution Tarion and all that came true God was about to pronounce judgment upon that Hallelujah he said who is on my side you had some Uno up there the scripture show us there are some dictators that once give their power to the beast but in that moment they will turn on her and those dictators show off the wall in one hour she came to not Hallelujah so Saints we not living for this world we living for the Beyond Hallelujah in one hour she came to not and you know what the scripture said ju trampled upon her with the horse so brother we the righteous will walk out on the ashes of the wicked Hallelujah isn't that right to enter into the seventh day but the seventh day is not all there is a climax in the 8 day Hallelujah when that City comes down brother and that bride stands in a as she sees that City come down Hallelujah 12 Foundation the 12 gates and the glory of that City the lamb is the light earth that is who we are in this hour Heaven and Earth will hug and kiss something will break from that Dimension into this Dimension he say I go to prepare a place for you that city is in prepare preparation now and one day these eyes will see it the Believers from over on the next side one day God will clear the fog and these eyes will become Supernatural and we will see them Hallelujah just as we see them they'll see us we will be in that City so since we in the last day it's a terrible time we're under Elijah's Ministry we know who we are yeah God is bringing judgment on that system but while he's bringing judgment on that system there is a bride here in this hour that is preparing to leave here this is who we are in this hour Hallelujah may God bless you may God bless his Services we love you [Music] shalom blessed be the name of the Lord oh I love the old time singing shouting I love the old time we I

Jesus Christ he's never fail yeah [Music] 1983 the Holy Spirit sealed me with the Holy [Music] Ghost if it had not been for that experience I wouldn't be here tonight it has kept me in the good times and the bad times when I felt like giving up like sister Coleman w always remind me you know and she would sing the song and it would encourage me because that's our [Music] testimony without the Holy

over the building this is different you know I believe that God is fixing to move in such a special way many of you who have the Holy Ghost who are seeking the Holy Ghost this is your time I was praying and I told Brother uh stepanus uh by the way how many appreciate his message this morning that was a masterpiece a real masterpiece and uh I personally have have not heard brother stephanus preach an entire message and I was so blessed I told him his dad would be very proud of him amen a chip off the O Block amen praise be to God Amen so once again I appreciate uh being here and for the invitation that our precious brother ID invited me and I appreciate all the ministers that have come and have testified uh uh I am so blessed with every testimony that has come forth um we are here for a purpose we have an appointment with the supernatural amen and uh I have seen the Lord do many wonderful things glory glory and I want to uh specifically the morning I heard from Ali Shan sham sham sham and he struck something that uh touch my heart and I'll have you sit down in a moment about humility it really really spoke to my heart because I think that is the key we want anything from God we have to Humble ourselves we have forgotten how to be humble and by the grace of God we're going to get back to that place see because if we lift ourselves up he cannot be lifted up amen we have got to get ourselves out of the way so he can do his business we cannot do his business we have got to get out of his way so he can do his business amen so I want to uh thank uh him for that testimony and uh I believe with all my heart that God is fixing to do something very special for each and one may God bless the family the church and everyone that is here amen I can't remember all the names I'm getting a little older and uh so I I remember a lot of things but uh the thing is that um as I as the brother was saying this morning Faith does not get old Faith doesn't get old huh what did Caleb say I am as strong today his faith was as strong today as it was when Moses s to him and my faith is as strong today as the day that Moses sent uh you know we have these promises that we are so um fond of not only fond of but we are looking for the manifestation of certain promises and we must keep our eyes on the prize if we do not then the devil will make sure that we uh we lose sight of them so I had I was telling brother stephanus this this morning that I had uh or rather this afternoon I had a little message that I brought with me but then uh early this morning the Lord woke me up and changed uh my message and um and I'm speaking on a subject that I have spoken on for years and that is the importance of the Holy Ghost without the Holy Ghost the church cannot live without the holy ghost that I'm I'm not I'm not talking about Pentecost I'm talking about a genuine experience in the baptism of the Holy Ghost that keeps you alive the Holy Ghost is the life of the church the Holy Ghost is the blood in the church you take the blood out of a man he dies you take the holy ghost out of the church it dies amen and we're contending for that faith that was once delivered to the Saints amen hallelujah and if it was a theme of every Apostle it has got to be our theme also Amen Hallelujah to the lamb God bless you I will turn now if you would I don't want to keep you too long I know uh there is a little meal after so we'll just rush right away uh and then do uh as the Lord leads see but I want to draw your attention to Ephesians chapter 4 Ephesians chapter 4 and we will be reading the first six uh verses of Ephesians chapter 4 and we will uh read further on but for for the background here I want to just uh read this I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called with all lonliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another in love endeavoring now I want you to listen to the to these words endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit he's not talking about yet the unity of the faith this message in general if I would say in the message in general we have lost focus of that that Unity of spirit we don't even fellowship with one another hardly and there cannot be any Unity of the faith without first Unity of spirit you have to love your brother you have to love your sister amen we're following the same message amen we believe in the same Prophet the least we could do is come to a Unity of the spirit and God will do the rest amen the unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace amen and this is what I believe is going on today amen I'm so happy to see so many different uh visitors that's come from around the world and so forth amen we're not greater than you you're not greater than us we are fellowshipping around the revealed word of God if we can only get started God will do the rest amen and this is a miracle because there are some places you can't gather like this unless you're part of a group they don't want nothing to do with uh I'm telling you the truth but we have progressed by the grace of God Amen so listen there is one body yes sir and this is where I draw my title this uh evening there is one body remember that one Spirit even as ye are called in one hope of your calling one Lord One Faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all who's above all Jesus Christ no man is above you amen Jesus Christ is above us all every one of us has uh uh a God to report to and that's Jesus Christ amen who's above all and through all and in you all let us have a word of PR prayer our heavenly father we have read your word and father we know and feel how how the holy spirit is just moving I could feel this place is about to erupt with your presence dear God your presence is already identified your presence is already here amen the platform has been set oh what a convention uh we're having Lord when G when Jesus himself the one we vote for we don't vote for any political party here because we have no continuing City here but we seek one to come amen it's all corrupt and it's all uh finished we know that we have a kingdom which cannot be moved and father that is what we want to strive and and strike this morning or rather this evening and to have people understand the Bride of Jesus Christ who have gathered to hear the word of God I pray pray dear God that you would touch each and every one those that are sick Lord those that need Deliverance those that have questions I pray that the holy spirit in this great presence would answer every question heal every sick dear God deliver the captives father God and may a true Unity of the faith come down lord father dear God like a dead on a day of pentec cost dear God Lord that we may know who the enemy is oh we're not each other's enemy oh no one the brother Brown never taught us how to fight one another oh he taught us how to love one another amen hallelujah so may we come back to basics as it were and father may we by the time this service is over I pray dear God that your Holy Spirit would open our understanding to the word word and we'll be careful to give you the praise and the honor and the glory we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen you may be seated let's give the Lord a hand of Praise amen thank you I don't want to be too long tonight uh because as I said I I realized what's going on uh after and um I remember years ago um well I won't mention any names but uh there was let's say the morning service there was a a preacher that would come with a with a whole pile of books and plop them here and then plop them there we knew we had a long service that was in the morning okay and then it was always understood that in the evening you don't come with a PL and here comes a minister with a whole bunch of books and here and there uh but you realize that um we we have a little more understanding and compassion amen and to understand what I'm about to say you have to understand that there is no quote no scripture no nothing that I could say that can bring the unity of the faith that's right that's right because it doesn't come by word I have a scripture you may have one I have a quote you may have one that doesn't bring there's a war of quotes and scriptures and things only he can bring a Unity of the faith Hallelujah and I'm looking for it in this meeting praise God but the first thing that we've got to uh uh do is get in the unity of spirit amen so he can take it uh the rest of the way and I was reading a quote here and it blessed my heart this is a prayer from brother brandham and if you're wondering what it is that I'm saying or trying to get to this is a prayer maybe it'll help you understand bless every organization this is where brother Brown is preaching 1960 God's provided way of approach to worship bless every organization in the valley all the Blessed people the ministers and pastors of the different denominations maybe we might disagree upon some theological teaching of scripture but father in all one principle we believe in God the Eternal one so help us Lord to have Unity of spirit until Unity of the faith is brought forth so the unity of the faith has got to be brought forth and no man can do it only God can do it Hallelujah and when we shall see him face to face then we'll all see eye to eye until that time May the Holy Spirit bless us in our efforts that we put forth we ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and that is my prayer tonight amen because we all know that we've got to come to a Unity of the faith that is the word the five-fold ministry will have a great Unity of the faith and I believe that God is training a five-fold Ministry but he wants to hone us a little more now amen amen because he wants to use us in the fullness of our ministry but he cannot use us fully unless we get rid of some things amen I hope you love me after this amen the Holy Ghost the Dynamics to our mechanics is what brings forth the true Unity of the faith that's right how many believe that to be the truth the Holy Ghost the Dynamics to our mechanics is what brings forth the true Unity of the faith and only he can bring it Hallelujah yes sir how many of of us have heard before oh we're waiting for the dynamic to this church what did Brother Brown said the Dynamics of this church will be a what a refilling of the Holy Ghost the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Spirit of what we have worked in a small measure God wants to increase that measure where the cripples can walk and the blind can see and the dead can be raised up Hallelujah that's a promise that I believe in that's a promise that I strive every day Hallelujah so don't get bored with this message don't get bored with oh there's coming a Dynamics to the church there is amen Noah had no other message he preached 120 years what did he preach what did he preach he never changed his title it's going to rain it's going to rain and I have to say right now the real rain is going to fall but it has to have sea to fall upon hallelujah amen glory be to godall and it'll take a holy ghost experience young people the reason I say this is because as I said I I feel that the Lord laid upon my heart to bring this because there are a lot of voices and things like this and uh I want to make sure that I preach what I I've always preached and I'm still here by the grace of God over 40 years or so I've been preaching the gospel I would have never made it here un unless it was for the holy [Applause] go I have not changed amen hallelujah amen so now I want you to notice it will take the Holy Ghost as an experience like it was on a day of Pentecost not an intellectual understanding of what the Holy Ghost is and you get a good feeling and so forth and you remain the same it hasn't change the Holy Ghost comes to change you from the [Applause] [Music] inside it comes to burn out all the demons the very traces and desire of sin and whatever oh Hallelujah to the lamb it'll help you get to the next step when you feel like giving up the Holy Ghost will which is your theophany comes closer and says get up from there you can make it by the grace of allmighty God hallelujah amen and where is that theophany sitting here tonight brother Braham say your theophany is right next is sitting right next to you brother and if your theophany is sitting right next to you there is no way you can sit still amen because there is a power of the Holy Ghost quickening your body I'm not trying to make people shout but if I if you agree with what I'm saying there is something on the inside that has to cry out amen hallelujah because you recognize this word you've heard this word somewhere way before there was a beginning way before there was a moon and a star whatever you heard it a it's a certain sound and you say Amen to it Hallelujah but now I want you to realize Hallelujah now you can be seated in a moment because I want you to understand this 120 Souls went up to the upper room in the upper room they did not have a Unity of the faith that's right they did not have the unity of the faith they went in obedience Hallelujah and they obeyed the voice of Jesus Amen and they waited for the promise of the father in one mind and one Accord we know how the scriptures say but they had Unity of spirit but not Unity of the faith oh Hallelujah you mean need to tell me that you could be in in the upper room and still have don't have the unity of spirit you're not going to get anything because you're not open for amen whatever God's program is but now let's listen so they had the uh Unity of spirit but not the unity of Faith they were trusting and praying for the promise of the father that's what they had uh uh gathered therefore and in the upper room there was no five-fold Ministry [Music] yet they were 120 seeds no five-fold Ministry yet amen they were under the unity of spirit but something happened and this is what I'm talking about now only God can make it happen because when the day of Pentecost was fully come listen God sent them to the upper room and said wait and he said oh wait until you are indued with power from on high and listen Our God does not lie he knew that was a coming of Pentecost amen he spoke it it went out and the Holy Spirit followed that word and one day when the day of Pentecost was fully come it hovered over the 120 amen Ready To Break Forth Hallelujah and I'm going to tell you something they were gathered in the unity of spirit but when the Holy Ghost comes down they came down Apostles teachers evangelists amen prophets oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah you see how important the Holy Ghost is amen don't ever let the devil steal the holy ghost from you and you may have the Holy Ghost God bless you keep it hold on to it fight for dear life amen because if you don't know where you're standing the devil will try to take it amen hallelujah see so now the gift of the Holy Ghost was divided God all that God was he poured it into Christ the fullness of the Holy Spirit wasn't Christ amen so now Christ walked among them them among men they did not have what Christ had because the Holy Ghost had not been imparted yet amen he had to uh finish his course at the cross and say it is finished amen and when he gave up the ghost Hallelujah here it comes back on the day of Pentecost and it divided himself amen among 120 yeah and after that 5,000 let me tell you something the Holy Ghost is contagious oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah 5,000 10,000 after that and he's still in the Holy Ghost filling business oh hallelujah amen glory so it was a gift of the Holy Ghost that would divided himself and put a five for Ministry interaction do you understand Hallelujah they came down not only sealed but positionally placed that's the measure that they had hallelujah amen so some Apostles some evangelists some pastors and teachers amen so now uh now they contended for One Faith one Lord and one baptism now the content uh now is time to contend for because brother Brown said either you have the Holy Ghost or you have religion so I uh listen after the Holy Ghost has been released didn't br Bram said uh the Holy Ghost has been bound for over 2,000 years uh over at the river of Euphrates but the evening time message releases the Holy Ghost now that it is released I want part of it I want my part praise God give me my Mountain praise God Amen I want my part amen glory be to God listen there's been churches churches bries Brides churches churches hey all throughout the church ages all throughout the the ages see there's been churches churches Brides brides churches churches but there's got to come one one hallelujah amen there's got to come a real bride there must come one that not only got mechanics but dynamics of it oh Hallelujah glory be to God and I'm afraid that we have been so busy with mechanics on Amen trying to figure out what did Brother Brown said here what did Brother Brown said that and we're full of mechanics now oh hallelujah we're full of mechanics but listen we're we're putting less emphasis on the Dynamics we've got the stress the Dynamics this age we've got the stress the Dynamics because the Dynamics is what's going to get us out of here praise be to God hallelujah you can be an intellectual Giant in this message it don't get you nowhere what we need is a good oldfashioned heart F holy ghost devil chasing true blue red hot bloodb experience with the Holy Ghost and it doesn't get all old amen there's not an old Holy Ghost amen Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah and I'm going to tell you something what troubles what troubles me is when you hear uh people say you don't have to come to the altar you no longer have to come you have it already are you kidding me I have [Applause] [Music] what some people even say you have to deny your experience from 83 and whatever listen one filling rather one baptism many [Applause] fillings I'm going to keep 83 and I'm going to keep on on I'll be filled tonight and tomorrow and the next day praise God it does not diminish what was given years ago brother years ago I'm going to tell you something how you I'm going to tell you I'm oldfashioned Hallelujah I remember people coming to the altar amen convicted by the power of the Holy Ghost amen they were dressed up really nice in their suit and everything but they went to The Altar and they begin to cry out and their suits were so wet with tears not coming down their NOS they did not care they wanted God himself to change them Hallelujah give me that oldfashioned Revival that's what I need that's what the world needs that that's what this message needs is a good old fashion back to God Holy Ghost Revival to finally get the church in order not only the church in order but the fivefold ministry into [Applause] action because a fivefold Ministry has a powerful Ministry but we lives way below our privileges oh Hallelujah are you still with me are you still with me Hallelujah some people say well I have the Holy Ghost what's you know okay that's good get some more you can't exhaust the Holy Ghost there's many there's much more where it come from Hallelujah denounce denounce denounce oh you must denounce everything from the past and so forth listen I'm going to tell you something can I be bold brother sure sure we're friends for many years huh come on people claim oh we're following so and so so and so so and so Amen brother if they heard if so and so heard from the grave what they're preaching today they're turning the grave and say this is false Hallelujah so we love we love we love listen watch the wolves and sheep clothing This is Gospel now amen denounce I've never heard a real Christian say denounce your experience this is direct but it's not for everybody it's for it's it's meat praise be to God hope you can hope it doesn't choke you amen listen I'm telling you this is the truth I don't know I'm just I'm just telling the truth and God told me to come it could be my last time here but nail this down and amen because the Holy Ghost is important in the church amen listen but there has got to come one there's been Church to church Brides bride churches churches there's got to come one Hallelujah there's got to come a real bride a real bride now amen that must come one that's not only got the mechanics we have the Mechanics for years we've read the mechanics and everything else we understand it amen or at least we think we understand it and uh unless it comes to you by Revelation there's no way for us to understand you see it has to come by revelation and it makes the church live talking about the Dynamics amen does your car work you can have a brand new car with no gasoline it can be brand new Straight Out of the showroom but my question is does it work when you turn the key does [Music] it can you put it in into service Hallelujah because I want to compare the fivefold ministry today with the fivefold ministry of the apostolic ho ho ho ho [Applause] ho in the book of Acts you're going to find out amen that we need a little humbling we need a little humbling and I'll and and I'll get to that point in a minute but until we come to that place until we find that place see we got to find that place we have to come to that place and we're on a way tonight and by the grace of God we will find that place hallelujah what good does it do to polish the hubc Caps amen amen what good does it do to give a facelift and simonized job when there's no Dynamics in it see no matter how much mechanics proves to be uh right there there has got to be a Dynamics to make it work my precious brother was speaking uh this morning 60 years 60 years since the revealing of the Seven Seals and so forth by now by now brother we we should have been way up the road way up the road Hallelujah way up the road but we're going to find out tonight we're going to get back on that road now amen because you see God many times permits things to happen right to test our character he'll cause people to talk about you Hallelujah he'll call people people to stab you in the back and you have to have self-control because that's the nature of the person everybody else will blow up but what makes you different is listen the apostles were menant a few words they didn't have to argue with anybody they knew where they stood Hallelujah and when they spoke Heaven opened up it didn't prove didn't have to prove anything God backed them up God backed them up Hallelujah because it was God's men so see uh there's no Dynamics in it no matter how much the mechanics prove it to be right it's got to be mechanics Dynamics rather to work so now quickly Ephesians chapter uh 4 let's let's continue on this so I I'll put it back in the word so we'll understand now Ephesians 4 and verse 11 uh let's see what brother Brown says here or rather this the scripture says here and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and some teachers now listen this is a fivefold Ministry Hallelujah what for the perfecting of the Saints we have a work the work of the ministry what are we supposed to do edify the body of [Applause] Christ in other words five-fold Ministry we're Servants of the people our job is to build up the [Applause] body to encourage the body to preach the baptism of the Holy [Applause] Ghost but today somehow we've got something wrong if you say you're a five-fold minister first of all I've been around the world everybody wants to be an apostle teachers too too low pastors too low everybody wants to be Apostle okay that's great if God made you an apostle that's wonderful but what happens is it's a prestigious position I'm not talking about here now I'm talking about what's going on in the world you understand what I'm saying prestigious position I am a five-fold minister good for you st serving the [Applause] people stop praying for the people to get the Holy Ghost stop praying start praying for the people to be healed and Hallelujah start doing something because we're Servants of the people start preaching to edify the body of Jesus Christ until when until how long until we all come to the Statue of the the fullness of Jesus Christ that's the Great Commission everybody wants to be 54 Minister that's good and it's good to be 54 Minister but I'm GNA I'm I'm going to bring some positive things about P five4 ministers see but the thing is we misunderstand look at the Apostles of old it wasn't no prestigious position many got their heads chopped [Music] off some were boiled in Vats of hot oil some gave their lives for the gospel because in them was the faith and they would not deny the [Applause] faith the original apostles were rugged [Applause] men and they did not compromise with the word of God hallelujah no compromising when they saw something wrong they spoke it cuz God told them to do it that's that's their position but today oh yeah I want to be Apostle oh yeah would you give your life for it would you permit yourself to be cast into a vat of oil would you permit yourself to be your head chopped off listen the Apostles of old didn't even care because they knew that they awaited a more glorious [Applause] place okay I'm still laying down some things amen listen till we all how long are these God called Men supposed to be working in their Church until until that's not just a specific time it's until which means don't quit until amen until or they all come to the unity of the faith now the unity of the spirit is different than the unity of the faith hallelujah hallelujah and a knowledge of the Son of God unto a person perfect man unto the measure of the Statue of the fullness of Jesus Christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed and fro tossed and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine you see the reason I'm speaking certain thing because there's a lot of Winds of Doctrine passed by and somebody's got to say something now listen by the Slate of men and cunning craftiness they used to you know remember years ago I remember uh you know years ago when brother Bram was taken from the scene as said watch Pentecost so close that can deceive the very elected if possible watch Pentecost Pentecost can't deceive nobody no not the bride Pentecost don't deceive anybody is those people that come up with spoken word books they read the same books they quote from the same uh prophet's message and so forth and but they have a spin that you have to watch it and I'm going to tell you something here's the importance of having the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is a filter the Holy Ghost is the spirit of Truth and somebody could be preaching something that you may not fully understand but in here push it back because there's a filter inside the spirit of Truth you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free I spoken to many brothers and sisters you know what I didn't understand what he was saying but I just couldn't receive that I said Thank God Amen you don't have to figure out see intellectualism will catch a lot of people they put the word together in such a way that wow it tickles the intellect and it catches people with intellect amen but you have to understand that this is where the word of God comes to in the heart and when you're filled with the Holy Ghost there is it's too late Satan the word is in the bride no other SE can work in her praise be to God you cannot be deceived impossible let me say that one more time impossible you know brother Braham said the predestinated are the only ones that are redeemable [Music] not because you're a better person not because you live a certain way but because God before the foundation of the world he chose you Hallelujah and you are [Music] redeemable it's not goodness because brother Brown said Jacob Jacob uh rather Esau was a much better person than Jacob was he took care of his daddy but he had disregard for the birthright you know what the birthright is you know what the birthright is today the birthright is the Holy Ghost don't make light of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah Esau said I don't need that I'm hungry I need to eat today but he didn't realize amen that the birthright we're talking about the Holy Ghost is eternal food that will keep you alive eternally amen glory be to God let's let's continue see uh for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come to the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the statute the fullness of Christ we have work to do friends you see that statue of perfect man sir brother Brown didn't just bring that out amen now listen brother Brown said he always taught add to your faith faith is what the Holy Ghost so without the Holy Ghost you can't even add this is why it's so important faith is the Holy Ghost see how important it is but we're promised to reach the headstone and as we near The Headstone we will be so much like Christ that's when you see the fire Ministry get into his position and his action because we'll be so much like Christ they will not be able to tell you AP part so much like Jesus Christ that's when you can say when you see me you see my father that's when you can say Amen to a farmer who has not had rain in three or four months in the name of Jesus Christ I send you rain and you don't even wait for it to start you walk away knowing it's going to rain cuz a spoken word once it's spoken the Holy Spirit follows that word to make it come to pass and right now there's a promise of the Holy Ghost hovering all over this building and my word will not return void but shall accomplish the purpose he sent it for because our God is not a liar he promises you something you're going to get it Hallelujah you're going to get it I'm going to say it again you're going to get it hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah just create the atmosphere for him to walk up and down the aisles [Applause] why I like singing he never failed me yet he's never failed me yet till we all come to the unity of the faith so there is a Unity of the faith and we all striving to come to that Unity of the faith and yet naturally no quote can do it no scripture can do it only he can come down and bring the unity of the faith but until that time have Unity of spirit because that creates the atmosphere for Unity of the faith and this is why I'm happy that I see uh the whole convention open to who whosoever hu so it doesn't matter where you go you have people that are just I mean ministers is so shook up and so possesses of of their congregation don't go over there don't do this don't do that and they get mad and they excommunicate you because you went to visit a friend nothing nothing wrong with you that the pastor needs to to to to to pray a little more pray a little more have patience what what are you afraid of Amen see and there are I hate to say it because there are some places you you become a member and you never come out there's a p is a prison not a church you can't do this you can't do that you can't do that and I'm not listen it's getting quiet here but it's all [Applause] right it's all right listen you know why we're free from here and out we're free we're free if we want to fellowship with that one that one is not going to deceive us because of whatever it is that he's preaching we have a filter who knows you may convert that other person who knows you may uh be sent there amen just like Cornelius sent for Peter Glory Glory Glory sit down a moment so I I just want to illustrate something Peter reminds me of myself and so many of us can agree God had a special relationship with Peter Cornelius was ready he prayed he gave arms he he he was righteous and yet he was a gentile he was a gentile but he was righteous in the sight of the go of sight of the Lord and Peter was was resting on a roof and a vision come down to Peter and said Peter slay and eat pet Peter didn't have that Spirit of uh he had that Spirit of you he had to of course the faith but he wasn't ready to make a step and he said no I will not I've never eaten anything see but God has a way of of doing things that blows your mind out and if you're not ready to follow the leading of the Lord amen you'll never go to that place and if Peter never went to Cornelius Cornelius would have never had the chance of Salvation And The Voice come down a second time and Peter said no can you imagine that no I've never eaten anything unclean and the third time Peter was troubled Peter slay and eat he was a little confused then but you know I I've told the story before Cornelius was ready he was ready Peter was not there are people outside that are ready Hallelujah and we must be ready to go and stop fussing with the Lord if he sends you to Africa if he sends you to Europe a place you have never been go there by faith because God I believe will give you the great Victory if he sends you he's got to back you up hallelujah amen it may confuse your friends and so forth why would you go there because God told me to go there and this is why I like the Church of the Living God it was never a denomination he didn't have to call headquarters can I go he went because God told him to go and this is why I like uh brother o i i I asked brother ID brother ID who did you ask to have these con conventions he said nobody I said Thank You denomination we're falling to denom denomination you know amen you can't do it unless you call somebody that's denomination watch denomination it's a spirit it controls it robs you of your blessing not only that but it binds you to a human being who's off the [Applause] word Hallelujah brother brandham said in the church ages is that they bind the people to themselves hallelujah we're supposed to bind the church to Jesus Christ the son of the Living God hallelujah so so Peter finally went okay and you know what as I said I have 20 24 minutes is that it right can you can you bear another 24 minutes of of what I'm saying all right okay listen and Peter when he got there the house was full of hungry Believers the ground was right it's ready for the seed on and Peter said why did you ask why did you call for me and this is why I say GPS is impersonation of what God had years ago cuz he told Cornelius exactly where Peter was he told him what what door to knock on where to find him and he also working on both ends he told Peter go and ask no more questions sometimes we ask too many questions the Holy Spirit have to say shut up and don't ask questions go Hallelujah to the lamb so he went by the grace of God and while Peter yet spoke the word now if if the ground wasn't ripened and guess what that house was full of his family of his children amen because he knew he was going to receive [Applause] something Hallelujah and while Peter yet spoke the word the Holy Ghost fell upon them they spoke in tongues and so forth oh that confused Peter amen oh how on Earth they receive the Holy Ghost they not even baptized oh my God don't listen God will do things that will blow your mind out let them get the Holy Ghost and then baptize them later but they amen but he did it and then he had to explain to uh Jerusalem and all those that up there and said you know this is what happened and they had to admit well God God has turned over to the Gentiles now what are we going to do they receive the Holy Ghost amen see that's the how God works a f real 5old ministry glory glory glory okay till we all come to un okay uh that we henceforth be no more children tossed and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the Slate of men cunning craftiness whereby we they lie and wait to deceive so now uh let us for speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ now we are growing up into what the head even Christ your pastor your uh all those that are in this great ministry are supposed to be preaching Christ your head is Christ you're bound to Christ not to a man amen from whom the whole body is fitly joined together compact by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working of the measure of every part maketh increase uh of the body unto the edifying of itself in love so the true purpose of the five-fold ministry is to serve God's people do you understand that they are to edify the body encourage the body build up the body strengthen the body until we all reach this great place where we all know we must reach we all have to come to perfection in order to call the resurrection I was going to say something I'm going to check it amen in order to come uh call the resurrection this church has got to come to Perfection and a five-fold ministry will be used to bring this church to Perfection by the word amen the ministry of Ephesians 4 is not for personal Vindication now I'm I'm I'm touching a sore spot here I'm I'm going to do it I'm going to do it I'm going to do it I'm going to do it he said go ahead thank you you ever heard of somebody said who who prayed for that brother who got healed of cancer oh God heard my prayers you know and meanwhile the whole church is praying you see the point is this our prayer should be Lord Heal that individual I don't care how it happen it's not for my Vindication I want that individual that sheep heal cancer is disappearing you see but so much has been focused on personal Vindication they all carry their cross and suffer greatly for the faith in Christ Paul now listen I'm comparing the Ephesians uh the body rather the ministry of the fivefold ministry of years ago They Carried a heavy cross you know they were menant a few words Paul was beheaded in Rome Peter crucified upside down John was placed in the vat of oil and and they were humble men willing to stand in the face of death and torment the Holy Ghost gave them boldness and they were willing to stand unto the death today it's all about status this is why we need to Humble ourselves a little bit humble yourself if God answers your prayers thank God for it hallel all glory goes to Jesus amen everyone thinks okay everyone thinks amen uh and want to be an apostle that's all that's okay they want to be an apostle why so many of us today who call ourselves Ministers of the Gospel could never even stand in the shadow of these old of the new test Apostles God chose you to help build up and strengthen his church that's what a fivefold Ministry is this is what Ephesians 4 is all about it's not just a title or position it's a Ministry in which we should take seriously and with great reverence and not only that but telling the truth in Love no matter how people understand it or don't understand it I have many friends and I have many enemies I go home just as happy you know why because I'm not asking if this is right or wrong I speak because this is my conviction amen and I see mainly an attack on the Holy Ghost and I wanted to make sure I Dro this right here in Trinidad because I'm sure the tapes will go out and oh boy I'm I'm I am of course always uh talked about but it's okay it's okay somebody's got to say it now look at I want you to turn to uh 1 Corinthians uh we'll start with the 10th verse and I'm closing I'm still I'm still on good time I'm closing now Paul the Apostle as well as other men great men who were given great Ministries I want you to uh notice how Paul called the Corinthians carnal now let's let's read this verse 10 now I beseech you Brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that ye all speak the same thing uh and that there be no divisions among you the Visions I tell you will destroy a church destroy or Revival whatever but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment for it has been declared unto me of you Brethren by them which are in the House of Khloe that there are contentions among you now this I say that every one of you saith I am a Paul and I am of Apollos and I am of sephus and some say I am of Christ the question that Paul is asking in this particular uh chapter here he asked the question is Christ divided you're of Paul you're of cph year of apollis who is apollis this is what this is what Paul's asking who is apollis who is Paul he even included himself who is Paul who is sephus I have laid the seed apollis has water to seeed but God himself has given the increase that's an apostle that knows what he's talking about so from here and out amen I don't care what church you belong to I Don't Care What group you you belong to I don't care what religion you you believe in amen know this that at the end of the day you're not of apollis you're not of Paul you're not of sephus Amen it is God that gives the [Applause] increase now you tell me how Paul was getting Glory from that uh what he he's uh baptizing he's so you know I'm I'm of this one I'm he called them carnal that's a carnal that's a carnal mentality I am of this I am of that you know right here right now you are all of Christ in the presence of almighty God you're all of christen you belong to a church you belong to you you have a pastor sure but right here under this anointing we all belong to Jesus Christ Paul never exalted himself you see uh but he said uh let me continue I thank God that I baptized none of you but cus and uh gaas lest any should say that I had baptized in my own name and I baptize also the house of stephanus besides I know not whether I baptize any other for Christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel amen amen not listen not with wisdom of words watch those wisdom of words it tickles the intellect amen it has to be a revelation there's no way for you to understand the kingdom of God without the re Revelation amen lest the Cross of Christ should be made of none effect amen the prophet said that Spirits never die now if these things happen in the time of Paul don't you think they're happening today Spirits never die they just take on new bodies and operate with them I am of I am of brother Sozo I am of brother Sono I am of this one I am of that belief I am a that amen you know what you missed it all you missed it all because Paul himself who was an apostle to that age said who is Paul I put the seed in the ground apollis watered it amen we can cooperate yeah God gave the God gave the increase Hallelujah and it didn't um make Paul feel less an apostle amen God was working his way out Amen to day we hear the same thing I'm of Apollos I'm of uh sephus I am a Paul amen and Paul asked the question is Christ invited and I'm going to ask you the same question today this message that we all this convention we all come to I that's the title exactly one Faith one Lord one baptism is Christ divided yes sir are there two holy ghosts one baptism do you serve another God is there one God one Lord one faith if there's one faith we can all say Amen to that one [Applause] Faith now we're coming into the unity of the faith now Hallelujah you see because you have got to understand that the unity of the faith is coming in now you're going to see the power of almighty God a great manifestation of the Holy Spirit as we near the great headstone we will be so much like Jesus Christ but we have got to Humble ourselves so Jesus gets the glory because he will not share his glory with any man no man and listen I am not telling you to disrespect your pastor your pastor should be respected evangelists and everyone else should be respected for the gift that God has given to the church they should be respect Ed but they are human beings just like you and I and their purpose is to lift up Jesus in such a way that is their Ministry to build up the body of Jesus Christ until we all come to the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God and anyone else that tries to be an angel tries to be more than what they think they are that is off the work hallelujah hallelu amen listen there's a quote that I'm going to read here in a minute so you'll understand it God gave the in increase don't worry about God will give the rewards uh every five-fold Minister every uh Ministry of Jesus Christ God understands what you're going through he's going to he's going to uh bless you I remember there was a brother who was upset or in Europe he said I'm just so upset upset that I was eliminated or bypass uh I should be an apostle because I take canoes into villages in Africa and this and that and I'm upset that I'm not an apostle because he was looking for somebody to give him amen recognition don't look for anyone to give you recognition you know why God has put in a church not man some Apostles some teachers some evangelist because if man called you to be an apostle they can take you away way but if God has called you if God made you an apostle if God made you a prophet if God made you a teacher I don't care you don't looking you're not looking for recognition anywhere else you're doing the works of Christ and you walk back home or you take a flight back home and you feel good because you did what God told you to do you don't get on the phone and say how did I do how did you do praise be to God I Know This is Gospel this is this is listen I I I don't mean to be rough but this is This is Gospel now let's let me just say this cuz I I save the worst for last or I mean the best for last there's certain quotes you can only use at the end because then you're gone you know listen I'm I'm just reading the the quote you want you want to get upset with me it's okay it's it's you know wouldn't be the first time anyway now as an apostle as a member of the fivefold ministry I want you to compare the teachings of certain other groups and the reason I bring up other groups and I'm sure as everybody's listening I'm glad that everybody's listening and I'm glad that I can speak to people that are quiet because it doesn't bother me [Applause] I overcame that long ago you know I was trying to impress everybody you know when the Holy Ghost comes you don't care who is there you don't care amen listen what was the apostles theme now this theme does not change from age to age brother brandham says here in the token now the spirit is the token you shall be filled with the Holy Ghost not many days hence and when the blood was shed the token was sent down on the day of Pentecost like a Russian Mighty win [Applause] here's the next uh he said that was the theme of every [Applause] Apostle not some Apostles now how could that change the original Pentecostal experience the original Pentecostal Apostles how could that change to say look I denounce this and I denounced that I denounce this experience I denounce that the Holy Ghost is no long look we are the Holy Ghost how on Earth can you be the Holy Ghost can you be the Holy Ghost to be the holy ghost means that you're God the word hallelujah you cannot be the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost dwells in man you are a sinner saved by grace and any man that says such a thing so boldly should get out of the pulpit cuz they lack the Holy Ghost [Applause] [Music] listen there's something Apostolic moving in me now that will reject that teaching get back to the Cross what on Earth do they know about the Holy Ghost if they've never experienced the Holy Ghost say I denounce this Holy Ghost listen the Holy Ghost poured out in every age let me tell you something let me tell you something what brother Bram said in in Ephesus they had their mechanics and Dynamics together virtue they had the mechanics and Dynamics together all the way up mechanics and Dynamics together and you say we can't have that you are [Music] false because Apostles will still preach the Holy Ghost by experience because it was a theme of every apostle [Applause] have you received the Holy Ghost since you [Applause] believe well well you see now we are the Holy Ghost now because we have a different we have a different Holy Ghost in This age Hallelujah watch the salesman watch those salesman the next the next you're going to hear is like if you call now we'll add more that's a salesperson have no business behind a Pulpit not in this day and age the thing is is is because we're coming to the truth the real so the devil's trying to cut off the holy ghost in the church to make this church stumble what did Brother brandham say when he was speaking about the Statue of perfect man he said he saw scrap heaps of ministers on the side of the road [Music] why because they went into it [Applause] incorrectly is that gospel scrap heaps so if there's an incorrect way there is a correct [Applause] way I said Lord help me every day let me never change my message because I know what the power of God can do I know what the power of God can do I've seen young people I've seen young people that have a tremendous breakthrough years ago and they're still serving the lord today the Holy Ghost keeps you some ran through walls some knocked over chairs and everything else and they're gone today that don't mean nothing you can run all you want I'm not talking about running I'm talking about getting the Holy Ghost In Your Heart the anchor that holds Hallelujah don't let the devil sell you that it's false [Applause] hallu now I'm going to close I'm G to close what time okay I'm going to close now it's getting late now I I have I just have two more things to say why why do I say that is brother BR says see without the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're only guessing at it you have a lot of ministers guessing trying to figure out mechanics and then they you know how brother R said when you're doing your types and things make sure the cow don't end up on top of the tree and they see the cow on top of the tree they still continue they preach the cow on top of the tree but the real believer knows that the cow belongs on the ground hallah and there's a holy ghost filter that tells you know that Crow belongs on the ground amen we don't have to be enemy but I don't believe that get the get the cow back on the ground and then maybe we can continue see without the Holy Ghost they're only guessing and we see a lot of people guessing because theyve never had that genuine experience the backside of the desert Moses ran away from his Commission why he had no power he didn't have an experience amen he tried in his own ability to do what his parents said his mom told him that he was born a special child and he tried in his own and all he could do is slay one man and after slain that one man he ran for his life fear struck and Moses Mo thought that God forgot Moses head as far as he could hide but God knew exactly where he was at and I'm going to tell you something if God has predestinated you to do something stop trying to hide Moses wasted 40 Years of his life hiding meanwhile God knew where he was at all the time you'll save time your time God's time he said because God is going to catch you God is going to find you and bring you back after he gave you an experience in the backside of the desert then you can go and face pharaoh who you ran away from Hallelujah brother Bram said he come down a oneman army Pharaoh didn't see what was behind him but behind Moses was the armies of the Living God Hallelujah he had a little stick in his hand but he took over because he was commissioned to take over he had that experience he didn't have it before but he had an experience then he knew what he was talking about and when he went down to Pharaoh now remember when you have an experience genuine experience and you know where you're standing there's no go no negotiation Pharaoh said let your children stay back no this is not a negotiation I'm taking I'm taking my children I'm taking my family I'm taking my wife I'm taking my father I'm taking my uh I'm taking everybody I'm not leaving a hoof behind Pharaoh you're not in position to negotiate because greater is he that's in me Hallelujah [Applause] he came back with hidden power hallelujah amen now this this is what I want to finish with I'm closing now I'm done I'm sorry it kept you longer than expected but listen the message I believe got home and I this this is this is what I want you to be very careful be very very careful because this has happened and is happening now brother brandham warns us in questions and answers he said God has a hard time to get somebody that he can deal with that'll stay humble hard time they're rare they're hard to find but the truth is if you want to be a candidate you've got to humble yourself uh that'll stay humble and meek and stay in place until God calls him to do something he said you believe you see that a man that God can bless and he'll still keep himself a man not an angel H you you've heard people say oh you left the angel what Angel you talking about we have the message we've stayed with the Angel's message what Angel you talking about have you become an angel overnight I don't understand maybe you have see a man that God can bless and he still keeps himself a man not an angel or a God as soon as man gets blessed and has a little something given to him he wants to become a God he wants to become an Angel that's where we have the problem you have to humble yourself and watch these guys watch these guys that talk about angels and things like that you you left the angel I didn't leave no angel or you kidding me the angel promised to go with me amen uh God promis to go with me till the end of the world Amen he said he'll never leave me nor forsake [Applause] me I know this is direct but it needs to be done and I may as I said this is my last service I'll say it last quote and I'm gone amen as soon as man gets blessed and has a little something given to him he'll want to become a God and he wants to become an angel he wants to become some great person me and all uh uh see and he said me and all he said see that's wrong the wrong attitude God is hunting right now God is hunting for somebody he could uh bless and pour out the blessings and the more He blesses listen and the more He blesses the little uh the man will become I am not telling a story this is truth you have people people in churches that chant the pastor's name and this and that and this and that you you know you know I I don't even have chant the pastor's name and the Pastor's going around like oh my God God you have others that claim they're an angel you if you leave me you leave the angel I'm glad I left you years ago and I don't feel bad about it you know why because when I left that in fact I wasn't really really really into that but you're trying to sell me that I'm so glad that when he showed me that then he promised God promised he'll be with me even in me to the end of the world I don't need amen and then you hear all kinds of things I'm not going to say no more I'm finish but if we as Ministers of the Gospel we have a responsibility humble ourselves let God use you Hallelujah let God use you cuz he wants to use you God wants to bring forth a fivefold Ministry with the power of almighty God Amen just like I said when they speak it'll happen because it's not them speaking it's God speaking through them but they have gone through the process of humility they have gone through the process and they know amen whatever God does amen he gets the glory and the honor amen and I have been to different places and so forth and by the grace of God I preach messages amen and I am I go home to my wife and family and I you know all glory be to God I don't build this is why I like as I said I don't see our precious brother o building any Kingdom this is why I come year after year after year I agree Hallelujah I can identify with the vision he's trying to get the people together Amen to bring them to a place amen where they can receive the Holy Ghost the fullness of the Holy Ghost and this could be that meeting hallelujah hallelujah but humble ourselves amen and God will do the rest I'm so thankful God bless you I'm done Amazing Grace how sweet the sound do you love the Lord Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a Wretch like Me I once was lost but now I am found I was blind but now I see God bless you dad keep the faith not a faith keep the faith that was once delivered to the Saints and brother Brandon brought the faith and stay with it Hallelujah and if you do those things I believe with all my heart that we'll meet each other in the morning hallelujah praise be to God oh amaz [Music] in Grace how sweet the sound that s a richet oh like me [Music] I'm [Music] found now let's hum it real quickly I just want to say this I want you if you have accepted this message to pray to God go back to your hotel room have God search your heart is there any place he could humble you I want to be more humbler I want to be more Meek because he can only operate in that realm he cannot operate in hate he cannot operate in uh brother bam said when he saw and was transformed over to the other side he said nothing but perfect love will make it there so we must must have the spirit of unity amen I'm not talking about the uh I'm not talk a spirit of cooperation and then that comes then the unity of the faith but we can be humble God can use us more I believe he can but remember what if he answers your prayer what did Brother Stefan said I'm not the one I was just there when he did it that's a humble Prophet amen I wasn't the one down at the river amen I was just there when he come down amen look and and learn from the lessons of the prophet of God and I believe then we can go back Amen on the right course and there'll be a mighty mighty mighty Revival God bless you I love you until we meet again amen [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] again oh Amazing
