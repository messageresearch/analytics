[41:17] ago he's no longer
[41:19] there now I was stumped and
[41:23] stunned because I never thought he would
[41:28] move
[41:29] anywhere I took for granted that the
[41:33] dentist would be
[41:36] dear even somebody asks does Nurse
[41:39] retire then say
[41:41] retire and I just felt to bring that
[41:44] back to
[41:45] you because I have a title here not
[41:47] taking things for
[41:49] granted Breaking Free from entitlement
[41:52] that is my title this morning not taking
[41:56] things for granted gred Breaking Free
[41:59] from
[42:01] entitlement do not take your salvation
[42:03] for
[42:04] granted do not take your walk with God
[42:07] for
[42:09] granted but make a call in an election
[42:12] show there's a reason why these
[42:14] scriptures are dear it's not by flukes
[42:18] or by chance there's a reason why the
[42:20] scriptures say work out your own
[42:22] salvation with fear and trembling as if
[42:25] you could save yourself but it's not
[42:26] really that
[42:27] there's something deeper than that and
[42:30] we want to take a look at that tonight
[42:31] now brother brandham in a message called
[42:34] presuming and I read this message many
[42:36] times and I never saw this spe presume I
[42:39] got in the dictionary looked up what the
[42:42] word presume actually meant Webster said
[42:44] it means to venture without actual
[42:47] authority to presume anything is to
[42:51] venture without actual Authority that's
[42:54] the part we normally emphasize but then
[42:55] he say or to take for
[42:59] granted so for take for granted is to
[43:03] presume to venture without actual
[43:05] Authority or to take for granted to do
[43:07] something that before you are authorized
[43:10] to do it without the actual authority to
[43:14] do it so we ought not to make false
[43:17] claims we ought not to claim we are this
[43:19] and we are that and we are not really
[43:21] that because God has not confirmed that
[43:23] to be
[43:24] so now brother Bram says Satan is the
[43:26] Great is sopus he has never and and
[43:29] sopus is like an argumentative type
[43:31] person he has never been overcome in
[43:34] Strife of
[43:35] words in Divine service the words of men
[43:39] are usually heard more than the word of
[43:41] God each one Chatters as he pleases or
[43:45] kills Time by learning disquisitions and
[43:48] disproving the views of others of the
[43:50] new birth and how a man must be changed
[43:54] into the likeness of Christ to become
[43:57] Akers of his divine nature second Peter
[43:59] 1:4 scarcely ending is said of the power
[44:03] of the keys the church has almost lost
[44:05] the power of binding only the power of
[44:08] loosen Remains the sacraments given as
[44:11] symbols of unity of love and of our life
[44:14] in Christ have been made the occasion of
[44:16] bitterest conflict because of mutual
[44:19] hatred a center of
[44:22] sectarianism in short Christian has
[44:24] become a labyrinth the Fai have being
[44:26] split into thousand little Parts but
[44:29] only one thing is
[44:30] needful return to Christ looking to
[44:33] Christ as the only leader and walking in
[44:36] his footsteps setting aside all other
[44:39] ways until we reach the goal and have
[44:41] come to the unity of the
[44:44] faith as the heavenly father built
[44:46] everything on the gr of the scriptures
[44:48] so should we leave all part
[44:50] particularities of our special
[44:52] confessions and be satisfied here what
[44:55] we must satisfy with that with the
[44:57] reveal word of God which belong to us
[44:59] all with the Bible in our hand we should
[45:02] cry I believe what God has revealed in
[45:05] this book I will obediently keep his
[45:08] commands I hope for what that he
[45:11] promised Christians give ear there's
[45:13] only one life but death comes to us in a
[45:16] thousand forms there's only one Christ
[45:19] but a thousand
[45:20] Antichrist and this is where but Kelly s
[45:24] testimony and even the title of what he
[45:27] a walk in a new land a report of the new
[45:30] birth and its effect is so relevant and
[45:33] so important this is needful this is
[45:36] needful in 1 Thessalonians 3:13 and if
[45:39] you haven't heard it Go and hear it
[45:41] again if you heard it Go and listen to
[45:42] it again watch in 1 Thessalonians 3:13
[45:46] it says to the end he may establish your
[45:49] hearts unblamable in Holiness before God
[45:52] watch these words carefully even our
[45:55] father at the coming of Our Lord Jesus
[45:57] Christ with all the saints in the
[45:59] Amplified it says so he may
[46:01] strengthen and confirm and establish
[46:05] your
[46:06] heart faultlessly pure and unblameable
[46:10] in Holiness in the sight of our God and
[46:12] Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus
[46:14] Christ the Messiah with all his Saints
[46:16] to confirm so God will confirm the Holy
[46:19] Ghost to you confirm your experience
[46:22] confirm your breakthrough he's going to
[46:24] confirm it or give approval to it to
[46:28] confirm is to make firmer or to or to
[46:30] make firm or firmer to strengthen to
[46:33] confirm one res Amen to give a new
[46:37] Assurance of validity to remove all
[46:39] doubts Oh Glory to God so therefore you
[46:42] come to a place there's absolutely no
[46:44] doubt so when that man came with the
[46:46] robe that was glowing and telling people
[46:49] bow and bow and bow and thing was they
[46:52] say well let me go on check in Martin
[46:54] bring your robe and come when Martin
[46:57] that rope
[46:58] disappeared that where that rope come
[47:00] from we I can explain that rope but one
[47:02] thing we know St Martin he was a man of
[47:05] God for that hour there and that
[47:07] fals couldn't stand before that word and
[47:11] there's going to be a bride that no
[47:13] falsity going to stand before that
[47:15] [Music]
[47:15] [Applause]
[47:16] bride amen do you believe
[47:19] thatall so we read the scripture
[47:21] wherefore the rather Brethren give
[47:22] diligence to make your calling an
[47:24] election sure in other words it's not
[47:26] good enough to say I'm a believer I'm in
[47:28] the bride I'm in the eye in the bride
[47:30] and and whatnot and thing like that for
[47:32] if you do these things you shall never
[47:33] fall which things are the virtues how
[47:38] with all diligence in other words you
[47:40] have things that you must apply but a
[47:43] Bram I was crossing on Old Log the other
[47:46] day they some shall overcome don't wash
[47:48] what we call a hollow and I jump up on
[47:51] this lug on the outside look good it
[47:53] looked like a old beach lug but when I
[47:55] jumped on it a great chunk of it fell
[47:57] off it was real rotten and doy I said
[48:00] that is the way Christians are becoming
[48:02] they have been dead now we not talking
[48:04] about unbelievers we're not talking to
[48:05] Sinners we talking about message folks
[48:08] we talking about Christians people go to
[48:09] church when I jump on it a great chunk
[48:12] of it fell off it was real rotten and
[48:15] Doty I said that's the way the
[48:16] Christians have become in they have been
[48:18] dead in sin trespasses so long till they
[48:20] become Dy they can hold no weight at all
[48:25] they don't know what overcoming means
[48:28] they know what going to church means
[48:29] listen to specials mean listen to
[48:31] message songs means they know about all
[48:33] them things but what overcoming
[48:36] is they hold no weight at all they don't
[48:38] know what overcoming means and I begin
[48:40] to think of this text overcome keep life
[48:43] in
[48:45] you not going to church keep life in
[48:49] you it's s inside of here but I'm going
[48:51] to pump what God put upon my heart
[48:54] overcome and keep life in you you don't
[48:56] overcome and church say a church B Bing
[48:58] amen and you have dead half sleepy
[49:00] you're overcoming nothing you're coming
[49:01] to church it's when you leave church is
[49:03] when you have to deal with things when
[49:05] you leave church and you go to your home
[49:06] to your wife to your husband to your
[49:08] family when you leave and go to whatever
[49:10] St station you go to that is where the
[49:12] test come and that is how you can see
[49:14] the test is glorious because it makes
[49:16] you keep Life In You by overcoming what
[49:19] the devil he's supposed to P dce at you
[49:21] he's supposed to spell stuff at you but
[49:24] you don't have to let them
[49:25] stick oh Give the Lord some Praises he
[49:28] is doing his job are you doing yours
[49:31] Hallelujah overcome Le life in you when
[49:35] life went out that's what brought the
[49:36] luck to that condition so it rotten so
[49:39] here he say and it's made worse than
[49:41] ever when it laid in the branch where
[49:43] the water is so the explanation people
[49:45] could sit down in church and rotten away
[49:47] there's no life inside of there so the
[49:49] water of the world don't get them just
[49:51] rotten wood just rotten wood taking up
[49:54] pews and size but br
[49:59] I pray God that tonight if there be some
[50:02] here who doesn't know you never made
[50:04] their peace maybe tonight while we have
[50:07] been speaking a little voice have been
[50:08] speaking on in their heart I feel a
[50:09] warning that I can't be around much
[50:12] longer talk about himself oh God may
[50:14] they put their house in order right now
[50:16] may everything be set May the coldness
[50:18] maybe they are Christians they have
[50:20] lived under this so long and seen so
[50:22] many things have lost the value of
[50:25] it the things to take lightly instead of
[50:29] real deeply and sincerely he say oh God
[50:32] let us check up tonight granted knowing
[50:34] that these things are only warning us of
[50:36] a soon Raptor in church and if we are
[50:40] Laden with sin with unbelief and with
[50:45] fullness that's the killer right there
[50:49] Hallelujah we shall not make the Rapture
[50:52] I don't care who Minister tell you make
[50:54] any Rapture like that he's a liar he
[50:56] said if we are Laden with unbelief and
[50:59] with fullness and with sin we shall
[51:01] not make the Rapture so you must as well
[51:04] prepare for the tribulation period
[51:06] because that way you're on your way to
[51:07] if you want to make the Rapture you have
[51:09] to meet God's requirement Hallelujah we
[51:11] shall not make that rapture we know it
[51:14] Lord so we pray that you will burn into
[51:17] us the Holy Ghost D into our hearts oh
[51:22] God set our souls on fire with your
[51:24] blessing help us to understand Bless the
[51:28] people together bless a pastor and his
[51:30] wife bless the deacons the trustees the
[51:32] lady forgive our sins heal our
[51:35] sicknesses Lord set our hearts a flame
[51:38] and may we go from place with a warning
[51:40] message as we meet people in sin and
[51:43] tell them friend aren't you ashamed that
[51:45] you could do such things knowing that
[51:47] you have to meet God someday Grant it
[51:49] Lord I commit them to you now I commit
[51:52] the message and all together to work
[51:53] together for your glory in Jesus name
[51:57] oh give the Lord some
[51:58] Praises now Paul was the gold standard
[52:02] that the prophet said that he measure
[52:03] every Messenger to Paul was the man that
[52:06] God put as a standard everybody get
[52:09] measured to Paul but Paul himself did
[52:12] not take things for
[52:15] granted and this was such a Trill in
[52:18] studying this for me because I recognize
[52:23] that a lot of things that I see the
[52:25] attitude that people have is not
[52:29] scriptural Paul had a certain mindset
[52:32] here Paul in 1 Corinthians
[52:34] 15:10 but by the grace of God I am what
[52:40] I am and his grace which was bestowed
[52:43] upon me was not in vain but I labored
[52:46] more abundantly than they all yet not I
[52:51] but the grace of God which is within me
[52:54] hallelujah oh give the Lord some Praises
[52:57] this is Prophet Paul this is Apostle
[53:00] Paul this is mindset by the grace of God
[53:03] I am that what I am but I labored
[53:06] more so the grace of God gift you call
[53:10] you anoint you and bless you and you
[53:11] want to sit and steare sit and watch and
[53:14] do absolutely nothing that can't work
[53:16] but that was not the mindset that Paul
[53:18] had Oh Glory to God give the Lord some
[53:22] Praises Hallelujah so let's drill a
[53:25] little bit into Paul's mindset 1 Timothy
[53:27] 1:1 12-4 he said I thank Christ Jesus
[53:30] our lord who has enabled me for that he
[53:35] counted me faithful putting me into the
[53:38] ministry Hallelujah who was before a
[53:42] blasphemer and a persecutor and
[53:45] injurious but I obtained
[53:48] Mercy because I did it ignorantly in
[53:51] unbelief but the grace of our Lord was
[53:54] exceedingly abundant with faith and love
[53:57] which is in Christ Jesus oh give the
[54:00] Lord some
[54:01] Praises Hallelujah hallu glory to God
[54:06] hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord
[54:11] Jesus think I want
[54:14] to give the Lord some Praises
[54:17] [Applause]
[54:22] man think I want to get a scripture here
[54:29] [Applause]
[54:51] h
[54:53] [Applause]
[55:06] he said therefore this is from Romans
[55:08] 5:18 therefore as by offense of one
[55:11] judgment Came Upon all men to
[55:12] condemnation even so by the
[55:14] righteousness of one the free gift came
[55:16] upon all men under justification of life
[55:19] for as by one man's Disobedience many
[55:21] were made
[55:23] Sinners so that The Obedience of one
[55:25] shall made many many righteous moreover
[55:27] the law entered that the offense might
[55:30] abound but when sin abound Grace did
[55:32] much more
[55:34] abound that's exciting scripture when
[55:36] sin B Grace did much more B but in
[55:39] chapter six he said shall we then say
[55:41] what what shall we say then shall we
[55:43] continue in sin that Grace May abound he
[55:46] said God
[55:47] forbid Hallelujah he said God forbid all
[55:51] this Grace talk and Grace talk doesn't
[55:53] mean you get a license to go and sin
[55:55] because Grace
[55:56] when
[55:57] s you deceive that can't
[56:02] workall
[56:04] Hallelujah we have a responsibility to
[56:06] this glorious gospel we have a
[56:08] responsibility to the scriptures we have
[56:10] a responsibility to the
[56:17] [Applause]
[56:21] word so Paul was directly challenging
[56:26] take taking God's grace for
[56:29] granted taking God's grace as if it's a
[56:32] license to do whatever you want to do
[56:34] and it is
[56:40] not it's not a license to live in
[56:44] sin so Paul demonstrated this attitude
[56:47] of
[56:49] humility and
[56:51] gratitude not taking things for granted
[56:57] hope I could get you tonight judges
[56:59] 16:17 after Samson lie and and El Li
[57:03] trying to get he he he's blind to see
[57:06] the devil going to use her he just
[57:08] likeed that chick he liked that girl and
[57:10] everything else his eyes long and
[57:12] lustful but he doesn't see the spirit
[57:15] that going to move behind that so judges
[57:18] 16:17 and this is a good example of
[57:20] somebody who took his gift call and
[57:22] everything for granted watch this he
[57:24] told her all his heart and said unto her
[57:26] there had not come a razor upon my head
[57:28] for I have been a Nazarite unto God from
[57:30] my mother's womb if I be shaven then my
[57:32] strength will go from me and I will
[57:34] become weak and be like any other man
[57:37] this is a man that was called This is a
[57:39] man that is Anointed this is man who
[57:42] could sing this song I know who I
[57:44] am I don't know this
[57:51] song I am positionally placed you see
[57:54] what see in the message I have
[57:56] revelation of my position in Christ I
[57:58] kill a lion I kill this I do that I'm a
[58:01] champion I'm a
[58:03] warrior yeah that years
[58:08] ago no longer Li me a cat instead
[58:11] of R is
[58:15] meow watch
[58:18] this they had not been a razor come upon
[58:21] my head for I've been a Nazarite unto
[58:23] God from my mother's womb if I be shaven
[58:25] then my strength strength will go for me
[58:27] I'll become weak and be like any other
[58:28] man and when elila saw that he had told
[58:31] her all his heart so she knew she have
[58:33] him she sent and called for the lord of
[58:36] the
[58:37] Philistines that's the person who giv
[58:39] she loot that's who pay she she money
[58:42] saying come up at once for he showed me
[58:44] all his heart then the Lords of the
[58:47] Philistine Came Upon him her and brought
[58:49] money in their hand so she wasn't doing
[58:51] it for free you know she doing for love
[58:54] for loot
[58:56] amen and she made him sleep upon her
[58:58] knees and she called for a man and he
[59:00] caused him to shave off the Seven Locks
[59:03] of his head and she begin to afflict him
[59:05] and his strength went from him now this
[59:07] is the scary part verse
[59:11] 20 and she said the Philistines be upon
[59:15] the Samson now she custom saying that
[59:17] and he break the band and this and that
[59:18] and thing and he woke up of as sleep and
[59:20] said I will go out as other times before
[59:24] and shake myself
[59:26] but here the sad part and he wish not
[59:29] that the Lord was departed from
[59:34] him God hand is off that
[59:36] man a man that killed lion a man that
[59:40] have testimony a man that ripped to
[59:42] Philistine God hand is not off that man
[59:45] and the man don't even recognize
[59:51] it Samson taking things for
[59:54] granted that he lie and God still bless
[1:00:02] him he lies and he the power was still
[1:00:06] there but the lie was just an entrance
[1:00:09] you know to make him do other
[1:00:12] things he
[1:00:14] presumed he took for granted he shook
[1:00:17] himself he said this will be like other
[1:00:20] times not even
[1:00:23] knowing the Lord had departed from him
[1:00:26] listen to how Bon brought this in
[1:00:29] presuming Samson was a great man he was
[1:00:31] born a Nazareth unto the Lord Seven
[1:00:33] Locks here hang on his shoulders he
[1:00:34] proved by his sign of nazare to the Lord
[1:00:36] and God was good he run from his parents
[1:00:38] went down started going with a
[1:00:40] Philistine woman and that was against
[1:00:41] the tradition or against Israel to ever
[1:00:43] fool with a Philistine but there he was
[1:00:45] going down there God kept on being
[1:00:48] bearing merciful to him and then she
[1:00:52] tried to woo him a secret instead of
[1:00:54] coming right out and telling her not to
[1:00:56] do such a thing as that he was a
[1:00:58] Nazarite to the Lord he wouldn't tell it
[1:01:01] he told her bind my hands and lie to
[1:01:04] her God forgive his lie watch this is it
[1:01:08] don't know how I never see this like
[1:01:09] that God forgive his lie and he broke
[1:01:13] the bands and on and on like that till
[1:01:16] finally one time he presumed he could
[1:01:19] just do anything he wanted and get by
[1:01:22] witht it
[1:01:26] but say the devil want to get you to
[1:01:29] cocaine and you start on cigarettes not
[1:01:31] cigarette he want you on you know he
[1:01:33] want to get you on hard drugs so he
[1:01:35] start you on cigarette Broadway I don't
[1:01:37] know what have right now long time
[1:01:39] Broadway start you on some cigarette and
[1:01:41] then get it to tampy and from tampy
[1:01:43] something else and then get he said if
[1:01:45] the devil recognize you could see where
[1:01:47] heading him you'll keep it right
[1:01:51] andway ain't touching I ain't touching
[1:01:53] Tamp I ain't touching no marijuana
[1:01:56] you're
[1:01:57] smoking then a spirit jump inside have a
[1:01:59] smoking demon to
[1:02:00] feed that spirit Spirit smoking Spirit
[1:02:04] they have to get
[1:02:07] it that's the trouble is presume we can
[1:02:10] do anything and get by with it we are
[1:02:13] Pentecostal people they say we need
[1:02:15] message now we believe the prophet you
[1:02:17] see we can just do anything and get by
[1:02:19] with it you can't do it you cannot do it
[1:02:24] Samson said I'll raise and Shake myself
[1:02:26] just like I've always done when I what
[1:02:28] when and then when I do it God will be
[1:02:31] there I just presume he is there but he
[1:02:36] found out he was gone you know what I
[1:02:38] believe that the church ought to get
[1:02:40] back to Holiness again or to get back to
[1:02:43] the right way of living Samson he taught
[1:02:47] well I went down there live with this
[1:02:49] prostitute and everything else and she
[1:02:50] finally told me to do this and I finally
[1:02:52] got by with it and all I really told her
[1:02:54] the truth and here it is all about it
[1:02:56] was like this I think it'll be all right
[1:02:59] I presume he is with me and when he got
[1:03:00] up and shook himself he found out that
[1:03:02] his power was gone and I think today
[1:03:05] brother when we look around upon our
[1:03:07] churches the way they're going it's time
[1:03:09] to shake ourselves something is wrong we
[1:03:12] are presuming that we are running all
[1:03:15] right we are presuming that we are doing
[1:03:17] fine Church better be straightened up
[1:03:20] don't let us presume this because we are
[1:03:23] bigger number than we used to be we are
[1:03:25] more financial better than we used to be
[1:03:27] we got better buildings that we used to
[1:03:28] have we were dress better clothes than
[1:03:30] we used to have we have better cars than
[1:03:32] we used to have I wonder about Christ
[1:03:35] how much he's with
[1:03:38] us so Samson took his god-given strength
[1:03:42] and calling for granted don't do
[1:03:46] that Hallelujah but this supposed to get
[1:03:50] you people on the toes you
[1:03:51] know because you're taking nothing for
[1:03:54] granted
[1:04:01] hallelujah look at Paul's mindset 1
[1:04:04] Corinthians 9 verse 24 Paul speaks know
[1:04:09] you not that they which run in a race
[1:04:11] run all but one receiveth the price so
[1:04:16] run that he may obtain Hallelujah in
[1:04:19] other words Paul is telling them don't
[1:04:20] run
[1:04:22] stupid don't run foolish run to to get
[1:04:26] the
[1:04:27] prize then he want to give his testimony
[1:04:29] now this is Paul he want to give a
[1:04:31] testimony brother a punch he says no
[1:04:34] watch and and every man that striveth
[1:04:37] for the Mastery that is to be on top of
[1:04:40] your game it's temperate in all things
[1:04:43] not some men you callor your belly lead
[1:04:45] you your lust lead you uh you know
[1:04:48] whatever your TOS lead you you have to
[1:04:50] bring that into into
[1:04:53] subjection that a lazy man that say a in
[1:04:55] the street that way not going to work he
[1:04:58] saw a land yesterday and he still think
[1:05:00] the land coming back again this
[1:05:02] week so home for the
[1:05:06] week every man that stri for the Mastery
[1:05:09] is temperate in all things they do it to
[1:05:12] obtain a corruptible Crown but we are
[1:05:15] Incorruptible Hallelujah so Paul give
[1:05:17] his testimony now I therefore so run
[1:05:22] hear how I'm running I'm Prophet Paul
[1:05:24] I'm Apostle Paul but I want you to hear
[1:05:27] how I am running I therefore so run not
[1:05:29] as uncertainly so fight I not as one
[1:05:32] that beat the air but I
[1:05:35] keep my body and bring it into
[1:05:38] subjection do you know your body do you
[1:05:42] understand your body and your appetite
[1:05:44] what does trigger you I keep my body and
[1:05:47] bring it into subjection least by any
[1:05:50] means when I have preached to others I
[1:05:52] myself should be a Cast Away Paul say
[1:05:54] I'm the man of the and I can never fall
[1:05:56] I can never fail he's not talking that
[1:05:58] talk he is taking practicality and
[1:06:00] saying listen I don't want to be able to
[1:06:02] preach and after all be a cast away I
[1:06:04] have to get myself in order oh get the
[1:06:07] Lord a shout in other words examine
[1:06:09] yourself to see if you're in the faith
[1:06:12] not examine the pastor examine you
[1:06:15] yourself oh give the Lord some Praises
[1:06:17] not to examine the church examine
[1:06:19] yourself look in the mirror of the word
[1:06:22] you have nobody to compare yourself with
[1:06:24] but the word of God oh give the Lord
[1:06:26] some
[1:06:27] [Music]
[1:06:28] [Applause]
[1:06:32] praises and the Amplified verse 26 said
[1:06:35] therefore I do not run uncertainty
[1:06:37] without definite aim I do not box like
[1:06:39] one beat in the air and strike with
[1:06:41] anniversary you need boxing you box you
[1:06:43] boxing the air you air
[1:06:48] boxing what matches that the same spirit
[1:06:53] that you have no music heavy
[1:06:57] base without a
[1:06:59] guitar but like a
[1:07:02] boxer I Buffet my body his body his
[1:07:06] physical body I handle it roughly and
[1:07:09] discipline it by hardships and subdue it
[1:07:13] for
[1:07:14] fear that after proclaiming to others
[1:07:17] the gospel and things pertaining to it I
[1:07:20] myself should become
[1:07:23] unfit hallelujah hallelujah oh it means
[1:07:26] people can start off run well and become
[1:07:28] unfit yes yes over the years we have
[1:07:31] seen that men come from positive to
[1:07:35] negative come from God side to the dark
[1:07:40] side become on fit right before your
[1:07:49] eyes I myself should become unfit not
[1:07:51] stand the test be unapproved and
[1:07:54] rejected a
[1:07:56] counterfeit oh praise
[1:08:00] God so this is where we get that
[1:08:02] scripture now didn't know how to
[1:08:04] approach it but this is it Philippians
[1:08:06] 2:12 wherefore my beloved as have always
[1:08:08] obeyed not as in my presence only but no
[1:08:11] more in my absence work
[1:08:14] out your
[1:08:16] own
[1:08:18] salvation with fear and trembling
[1:08:20] Hallelujah you have some to work out I
[1:08:22] can't work that out for you you have to
[1:08:25] work that
[1:08:28] [Applause]
[1:08:32] it come like people gossip and Li and
[1:08:34] what kind of things so you got to be
[1:08:35] careful with this kind of people you
[1:08:36] know because they could drive it want to
[1:08:38] cuss and you know that is not Holy Ghost
[1:08:41] you know they not Christian but they
[1:08:44] almost come to light light you up then
[1:08:46] to gas you up then to R you up then and
[1:08:49] you have to hold your peace sometime the
[1:08:51] best thing is to shut up
[1:08:58] me a wife had some problem with husband
[1:09:00] and whatnot and they going to some Cel
[1:09:02] and man tell her something some gum or
[1:09:05] something so time he started make just
[1:09:06] chew and things will go different she
[1:09:09] started chew and chew and chew so she
[1:09:10] said what the secret he say all I trying
[1:09:11] to get you is a
[1:09:13] shut that's true you talking that's
[1:09:17] true cuz that mouth is what causing a
[1:09:19] lot of
[1:09:23] problem so Paul
[1:09:26] was trying to get a different mindset
[1:09:28] from his
[1:09:29] people one that is not a complacent one
[1:09:34] one that is not
[1:09:36] slothful one that is of diligence that
[1:09:39] would work out stuff that wouldn't sit
[1:09:42] there and just be buffed by the devil
[1:09:44] like Devil slapping you up like I know
[1:09:46] that a then and devil just slapping you
[1:09:50] up and as he hit you so your head going
[1:09:52] so your head going so afterward this
[1:09:55] this this too
[1:09:57] easy resist the devil he
[1:10:01] shall that flee song and so poor
[1:10:08] tonight Galatians 5:13 I know lot of
[1:10:11] scriptures
[1:10:12] tonight almost like a Bible teaching for
[1:10:15] Brethren you have been called unto
[1:10:19] Liberty only use not Liberty for an
[1:10:23] occasion of the flesh
[1:10:25] but by love serve one
[1:10:32] another a Christian free you
[1:10:35] know but that don't mean you're going a
[1:10:37] bar to to show free you are and only
[1:10:39] order
[1:10:41] water because you go stumble others you
[1:10:44] said I thought a church
[1:10:46] boy I thought she's a church woman and
[1:10:52] she in other words not the miss use and
[1:10:55] abuse the freedom that God has given
[1:11:00] us and that applies to the position of
[1:11:03] Pastor or the position of every any
[1:11:06] office whatsoever to not to abuse that
[1:11:09] because have men that abuse that and
[1:11:12] abuse the people and bring them in
[1:11:14] subjection to their Spirit not Christ
[1:11:16] Spirit their Spirit not the word of God
[1:11:19] we rebuke that and we reject that we're
[1:11:21] talking about this here is all of us
[1:11:24] subject to the spirit of Christ oh give
[1:11:27] the Lord some Praises Hallelujah Give
[1:11:29] the Lord a shout in the
[1:11:31] [Applause]
[1:11:35] houseall Paul is the same one that says
[1:11:39] wherefore let him that think that he
[1:11:41] standed take he Les he fall why would
[1:11:44] Paul talk like that I thought we had the
[1:11:45] bride adoption time we could speak the
[1:11:48] word when the Press come down what then
[1:11:50] without all these things here yes we
[1:11:52] find Prince out there not a carnival B
[1:11:56] you're jumping and you're chipping and
[1:11:57] you're going on the road you're going
[1:12:00] nowhere it have some fine prins that you
[1:12:04] ought to be inced in tonight
[1:12:07] Hallelujah not to take things from Grant
[1:12:09] for granted and free yourself from this
[1:12:12] entitlement spirit that has seemed to
[1:12:14] overtaken and possess his message
[1:12:16] Hallelujah I could tell them they're not
[1:12:18] going to no Rapture with that thinking
[1:12:20] and that
[1:12:21] attitude wheree Paul say let him that
[1:12:24] think he stand to us he fall what is he
[1:12:27] questioning people about
[1:12:29] arrogance
[1:12:31] overconfidence brother asked me I will
[1:12:34] brother tell me I'll never backslide and
[1:12:36] I keep quiet my mouth was sealed so he
[1:12:39] recognized I wasn't saying anything he
[1:12:40] said but you could say that I said no I
[1:12:41] can't say
[1:12:42] that I say I'm in he palm of his hands
[1:12:45] and if he move his hands I will fall I
[1:12:48] can't say that you see he big and high
[1:12:50] and mighty to say that I a reach there
[1:12:52] yet
[1:12:55] he felt as something because he
[1:12:56] recognized I didn't jump me
[1:12:59] too do say me too on that that's
[1:13:02] complicit with that man s don't all know
[1:13:04] me to you know I going down with that no
[1:13:07] you can't go there so Paul was reminding
[1:13:10] the Believers to walk a certain way
[1:13:13] that's why he said let him that is
[1:13:15] spiritual restore one that is full with
[1:13:18] a certain amount of Grace and
[1:13:19] understanding that you could have fall
[1:13:22] too not restore one with a hey hey hey
[1:13:26] like he mov his chair and he come to
[1:13:28] judge
[1:13:29] no a way to restore a way to bring back
[1:13:34] a way to get people reconciled there has
[1:13:36] to be a way has to be a Christian way a
[1:13:39] Christ Way a Bible Way oh give the Lord
[1:13:41] some Praises not the craziness we have
[1:13:45] seen over the years in this
[1:13:48] message Hallelujah we going good Romans
[1:13:51] 11 this is one of the chiefest
[1:13:53] scriptures for me with Paul in this
[1:13:56] mindset Romans 11:17 and Paul was
[1:13:59] describing about Israel being grafted
[1:14:00] and so like that and here how we bring
[1:14:02] it if some of the branches be broken off
[1:14:04] and thou being a wild Olive Tree would
[1:14:06] grafted among them and and with them
[1:14:08] partakers of the root and fatness of the
[1:14:10] Olive Tree boast not against the
[1:14:13] branches but if thou boast thou bearest
[1:14:16] not to root but to rooty thou will say
[1:14:18] then the branches were broken off that I
[1:14:20] might be grafted in
[1:14:23] know well because of unbelief they were
[1:14:26] broken off but thou standest by faith be
[1:14:30] not high minded but
[1:14:33] fear oh give the Lord some
[1:14:35] Praises Oh Glory to God I hope this this
[1:14:39] shake you this tonight be not highminded
[1:14:42] but fear for if God spared not the
[1:14:46] natural branches take heedless he also
[1:14:49] spare a day oh give the Lord a praise
[1:14:52] glory to God you think God will not
[1:14:54] spare the land of the free and the and
[1:14:56] the
[1:14:57] brave no the land of free and brave get
[1:14:59] judged God not going to spare them the
[1:15:02] judgments already fixed and
[1:15:04] set if God not the if God spared not the
[1:15:08] natural branches take heed L he also
[1:15:10] spare not the behold therefore the
[1:15:14] goodness the severity of God on them
[1:15:17] which fell severity but towards the
[1:15:20] goodness
[1:15:22] if thou continue in his goodness
[1:15:26] this scripture is so deep this if thou
[1:15:30] continue you see people started off good
[1:15:33] and then the drift my CL we talk about
[1:15:36] like that's why it was rebuked Return to
[1:15:39] your first love because that other song
[1:15:42] service tonight was awesome even going
[1:15:44] old school was
[1:15:47] awesome return to First
[1:15:50] Love why why why because things clut up
[1:15:54] the heart
[1:15:56] and you have to guard your
[1:15:59] heart because the devil trying to show
[1:16:01] everything to see what will stick
[1:16:07] in behold therefore the goodness and the
[1:16:10] severity of God on them that fell
[1:16:14] severity but towards the goodness if
[1:16:18] thou continue in his goodness otherwise
[1:16:22] thou also shall not be cut off amen amen
[1:16:25] how the message world can appreciate a
[1:16:27] message like this when they are told
[1:16:30] they are the bride they are the eye in
[1:16:33] the bride without the Holy Ghost without
[1:16:35] the experience of the Holy Ghost they
[1:16:37] know nothing but the Holy Ghost the
[1:16:39] ministers throw like bread to them and
[1:16:41] talking about Holy Ghost without
[1:16:43] sensation be it done to me according to
[1:16:45] Thy word and everything else and the
[1:16:47] people there lacking something the
[1:16:50] minister knows it it's a lack that is
[1:16:53] there that's why I have all this
[1:16:54] competition and no cooperation and
[1:16:57] that's have all of that because it's a
[1:16:59] lack of spirit and there was a brother
[1:17:02] here giv problems and so I talked to him
[1:17:03] I said listen the Bible talk about the
[1:17:05] unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace
[1:17:08] you're not looking to be miserable in
[1:17:09] the church if you want to take if you
[1:17:10] want to be miserable go somewhere
[1:17:13] else are not trying to comfort you in a
[1:17:15] miserable business I will make you get
[1:17:16] more so miserable you just run straight
[1:17:19] out in other words you're breaking the
[1:17:21] rhythm of the spirit
[1:17:25] he want to do things a certain way and
[1:17:27] then when I ask challenge him and it I
[1:17:29] and he said but I didn't I didn't see it
[1:17:31] I didn't think about that I said well
[1:17:32] I'm here for that as a pastor to think
[1:17:34] about things you don't think about
[1:17:36] because I'm in a position to see what
[1:17:37] you cannot
[1:17:39] [Applause]
[1:17:44] see there are some people that believe
[1:17:46] they have technical glasses and they
[1:17:49] seeing
[1:17:53] deep so watch this therefore behold
[1:17:57] therefore the goodness and the severity
[1:17:58] of God on them which fell severity but
[1:18:01] towards the goodness if thou continue in
[1:18:04] his goodness otherwise thou shall also
[1:18:07] be cut off if Samson tell hey stop that
[1:18:11] stop that who tell you to ask me that
[1:18:12] question who tell you ask me where lay
[1:18:14] my strength CU that's my
[1:18:17] secret he didn't ask her that he was
[1:18:19] playing games too so she had to play
[1:18:21] game this she play she a tell me you a
[1:18:23] tell me you a tell me you a tell me tell
[1:18:24] me tell me tell me and she tell her
[1:18:26] eventually lost his
[1:18:31] PowerAll but that son that same Samson
[1:18:35] son he broke free from his
[1:18:38] entitlement after he lost his eyes after
[1:18:41] he grind his Mill after he pay his price
[1:18:44] and they was dear enough to take that
[1:18:46] son that servant to bring him for
[1:18:48] entertainment God hated that God
[1:18:51] despised that is wanting for the man to
[1:18:53] be under judgment
[1:18:55] but it's another thing when you had to
[1:18:56] bring out that man of God to for
[1:18:58] entertainment they not no rally there
[1:19:01] not no Stadium thing no no no you can't
[1:19:03] do that don't do that and when Samson
[1:19:07] understood what was going on he began to
[1:19:10] pray and through them socketless eyes
[1:19:12] Tears start to come down and he said
[1:19:14] once more he could only pray once more
[1:19:17] because he had it before Oh Give the
[1:19:19] Lord a praise in the house he couldn't
[1:19:21] pray once more and he never had it and
[1:19:24] the Dynamics of this church will be a
[1:19:26] refilling of the Holy Ghost that they
[1:19:28] have worked in a small measure you can
[1:19:30] ask for what you don't know about the
[1:19:32] Lord I shout in the house God must give
[1:19:34] a measure that we can work with oh this

[1:32:19] truly as I live all the Earth shall be
[1:32:22] filled with the glory of the Lord

[1:32:27] glory and my Miracles which I did in

[1:32:38] their fathers NE shall neither shall any
[1:32:40] of them that provoke me see it but my
[1:32:43] servant Caleb because he had another
[1:32:45] spirit with him and had followed me

[1:32:50] where on he went and his seed shall
[1:32:52] possess It Go say yeah forgive them I

[1:33:02] my
[1:33:04] Hallelujah let me see I can finish WRA
[1:33:06] up
[1:33:09] here maybe maybe this is a message I
[1:33:12] should have preached on a Sunday
[1:33:15] morning but this this is what has been
[1:33:18] right in
[1:33:22] me about taking things for
[1:33:25] granted I'll skip I'll skip some
[1:33:32] stuff
[1:33:34] hallu but I'm talking about
[1:33:36] preachers they presume they're doing
[1:33:38] right when they preach their Doctrine
[1:33:40] they presume that that's that's just
[1:33:42] what God requires a certain Creed a
[1:33:44] certain affiliation had to join to us
[1:33:46] you had to connect to us and here have
[1:33:48] it and um what um we had the seed is a
[1:33:51] shock all kind of foolishness
[1:33:55] no Vindication no
[1:33:58] confirmation man son of my Ministry and
[1:34:01] all he son a woman
[1:34:08] I'm and know it's like a it's like a
[1:34:12] exciting thing to say Apostle I know who
[1:34:15] the Apostle attraction now who who's
[1:34:17] Apostle and Prophet long time when you
[1:34:19] talk about Prophet you tell people go a
[1:34:20] prophet a false prophet no every other
[1:34:23] Tom Dick Harry and he neighbor is a
[1:34:26] prophet and they're saying it to you
[1:34:28] know Prophet this Prophet that Prophet
[1:34:30] that and
[1:34:32] 99.99% of them
[1:34:34] false Jesus said many false rise and I I
[1:34:37] to be honest I didn't know was so
[1:34:40] many but Jesus can't lie you know it's
[1:34:42] true you
[1:34:43] know many you know I mean almost every
[1:34:46] one of them false for I I stop I stop
[1:34:49] thinking I will hold on to this true
[1:34:50] Prophet here this is Mal prophet
[1:34:58] there's only one Creed in the Bible
[1:34:59] That's Christ to know him is to have
[1:35:02] life outside of that there's no way to
[1:35:05] have life outside of knowing Christ by
[1:35:08] personal experience with him not joining
[1:35:11] a church of Rec a
[1:35:14] Creed so somebody leave here because
[1:35:16] they like brother go next
[1:35:20] church that person leave here but who
[1:35:23] they are
[1:35:24] and how they are nothing has
[1:35:32] changed but say we go to a funeral home
[1:35:36] we feel sorry for the person that is
[1:35:39] dead that doesn't change nothing but a
[1:35:41] dwelling place sometime we think we want
[1:35:44] to think of the best we can for them
[1:35:46] that's right but Jesus said except a man
[1:35:49] be born again he will no wise enter in
[1:35:52] there's no halfway line you presume he
[1:35:55] went to heaven but according to the word
[1:35:57] he didn't do it that's plain every fun
[1:36:01] go to people
[1:36:03] going it had a funeral the man had to
[1:36:06] come and look somebody come up and look
[1:36:07] you want know the wrong funeral because
[1:36:10] what they saying about that man in the
[1:36:11] box and what they know of that man is
[1:36:13] two different things you know so the
[1:36:14] person he was in wrong funeral
[1:36:22] you some
[1:36:24] sometime they see dead people make p
[1:36:28] lie oh Isaac wouldn't say lie say
[1:36:33] misrepresent the truth you
[1:36:35] know sometime I had to go with that the
[1:36:37] misrepresent TRU be the pulpit because
[1:36:39] they want to make it look good but the
[1:36:42] man is a rang stinking
[1:36:44] sinner that missed the portals of Heaven
[1:36:46] man he way to hell because nobody never
[1:36:49] witnessed to that man oh my but I'm say
[1:36:52] you presume he went to heaven but Accord
[1:36:54] to do he didn't do it you just presume
[1:36:57] that he was well he was a good church
[1:36:58] member he done good for the Neighbors
[1:36:59] that's fine but nothing to say against
[1:37:02] that part but do you realize what kept
[1:37:04] people out of the promised land they
[1:37:05] were borderline Believers it wasn't
[1:37:08] unbelievers you know it was people in
[1:37:10] Moses message that had books and tapes
[1:37:12] and press and
[1:37:18] playah the way men and women today they
[1:37:20] go so far in God they will say yes I
[1:37:22] believe but but when it comes to
[1:37:24] surrender everything to Christ your life
[1:37:27] and all where that line lays and that's
[1:37:30] what makes people say well I look at the
[1:37:32] rest of them and here you are older
[1:37:34] Christians to the younger the younger
[1:37:35] woman look at the older women younger
[1:37:37] men looking at the older men and see the
[1:37:39] way you conduct yourself and see what
[1:37:41] you do and they presume it's all right
[1:37:43] because you do it the way you do Israel
[1:37:45] had those experiences Israel mus come
[1:37:49] please had come out of Egypt Israel had
[1:37:51] seen signs and miracles and wonders all
[1:37:53] along the road they had passed through
[1:37:55] the Red Sea on dry ground they were
[1:37:56] Witnesses of the blessings of God upon
[1:37:58] their life and went and but then they
[1:38:00] failed to disobey one of God's command
[1:38:02] what happened the blessing cut off from
[1:38:05] them and they presume that because God
[1:38:08] has been so good he just go on to be
[1:38:11] good but God can't do that and I don't
[1:38:15] think this has wred homers yet because
[1:38:17] years now I've I've preached for years
[1:38:19] about Kang will know that judgment has
[1:38:22] not struck this message yet amen it's
[1:38:25] almost it's almost as if it's the
[1:38:27] longsuffering of God but Ste is the
[1:38:30] longsuffering of God has extended mercy
[1:38:33] and grace to the life of this message
[1:38:35] and thing like
[1:38:41] that skip
[1:38:43] it here it is when we warn spiritual
[1:38:47] gifts in the church if we want the power
[1:38:48] of God the real power of God now I tell
[1:38:50] you brother sister it's so easy for
[1:38:52] someone to be deceived on that sensation
[1:38:54] but you see our church is not moving on
[1:38:56] the way it should it should move we know
[1:38:58] there's something wrong we know then
[1:39:00] then God will not be with us until we
[1:39:02] get whatever it is straightened out so
[1:39:04] it's time to check up and see the things
[1:39:07] that we should do and that what the
[1:39:09] things we should do and get ready and go
[1:39:10] ahead oh praise the name of the Lord
[1:39:14] glory to God so some so he said he said
[1:39:17] the boat that Mo that Noah had to build
[1:39:19] that Noah had to build had to be a holy
[1:39:21] ghost constructed boat it Happ had to be
[1:39:23] boat with the design of God he said a
[1:39:25] Cyprus boat material make Cyprus boat a
[1:39:28] popular material make popular boat he
[1:39:29] said a worldly material make a worldly
[1:39:31] Church a holy ghost material made a Holy
[1:39:32] Ghost Church what is this Holy Ghost
[1:39:34] Church brother Brandon what does it do
[1:39:36] how does it act the Holy Ghost is the
[1:39:38] power of God that is sent you into the
[1:39:40] heart as a witness of the spirit you are
[1:39:44] born again and your life is cleaned up
[1:39:47] Moses take for Egypt but he failed until
[1:39:50] he met him in a burning birth when he
[1:39:52] met him in a burnish birth all he talk
[1:39:53] was over oh blessed be the name of the
[1:39:56] Lord we must keep the word of God don't
[1:39:59] presume nothing just don't take it for
[1:40:01] granted don't venture out when you don't
[1:40:03] have the authority to do so just stay
[1:40:05] and wait if it is 10 days 20 days 10
[1:40:08] years whatever it is until you are dead
[1:40:10] positive Oh Glory to God you want to
[1:40:12] know in whom you have believed Oh Glory
[1:40:15] to God hallelujah then then that life
[1:40:18] will straighten up isn't that right and
[1:40:20] the church I often wondered he said I'm
[1:40:22] closing before I die walk into a church
[1:40:25] sometime and walk through there and just
[1:40:27] see how sin couldn't even set in that
[1:40:29] church any member would have to confess
[1:40:31] it before they got there the holy spirit
[1:40:33] will call it right out on the spot like
[1:40:35] that see women sitting there looking
[1:40:37] like ladies see men like men Real Men of
[1:40:40] Integrity Holy Ghost filled men oh
[1:40:43] praise God so what you have to do
[1:40:45] tonight examine
[1:40:47] yourself whether you be in the Fate he
[1:40:50] said 2 Corinthians uh 13:5 examine
[1:40:53] yourselves whether you be the fith prove
[1:40:56] your own selves know you not your own
[1:40:58] selves how Jesus Christ is in you except
