[24:04] Bibles god bless you you're welcome
[24:08] tonight if you have your Bibles please
[24:10] stand with me to the book of John we're
[24:16] going to read from few places if you
[24:18] don't mind we'll start from the book of
[24:22] John chapter 12
[24:29] John since John chapter 12
[24:34] I would like to read from the 28 verse
[24:38] down to 24 John 12 22 24 then we shall
[24:46] also read from the book of Matthew
[24:48] chapter 27 to 28 somewhere there
[24:53] if you have the sa hey man
[24:57] and there were certain Greeks among them
[25:00] that came over to worship at the feast
[25:03] the same came therefore to Philip which
[25:07] was of Bethsaida of Galilee and desired
[25:11] him saying sir we will see Jesus
[25:15] Philip , tantalate Andrew and again
[25:20] hundra and Philip tell Jesus
[25:26] to come that his son of man should be
[25:34] as set a corn of wheat fall into the
[25:37] ground and
[25:42] if it die it bringeth forth much fruit
[25:47] the wake on of weed econ can ever
[25:51] multiply itself it's by dying I will
[25:55] come back to that
[25:57] god bless you Matthew chapter 27
[26:06] this might be a very hot text now in
[26:09] Matthew 27 for the kind of the theme of
[26:12] our program but you bear with me as we
[26:18] see we are it matches
[26:22] Matthew 27 I like to take from the 60
[26:26] second verse 62
[26:29] now the next day that followed the day
[26:32] of the preparation the chief priests and
[26:36] Pharisees came together unto Pilate
[26:38] saying sir we remember that that
[26:43] deceiver said while he was yet alive
[26:46] after three days our eyes again
[26:51] I'm sure you know they are referring to
[26:54] command therefore that the sepulchre be
[26:58] made sure until the third day lest his
[27:02] disciples come by night and steal him
[27:05] away and say unto the people he is risen
[27:10] from the dead so the last error shall be
[27:14] worse than the first
[27:16] Pilate said unto them ye have a watch go
[27:20] away make it as sure as you can so they
[27:24] went and made the sepulchre sure sealing
[27:27] the stone and setting a watch I will
[27:31] continue to 28 the first six verses in
[27:35] the end of the Sabbath as it began to
[27:38] dawn towards the first day of the week
[27:40] Came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary
[27:44] to see the sepulchre and behold there
[27:47] was a great earthquake for the angel of
[27:51] the Lord descended from heaven and came
[27:54] and rolled back the stone from the door
[27:57] and such upon it he didn't just roll it
[28:01] away is such
[28:04] his countenance was like lightning and
[28:06] his raiment white us no and for fear of
[28:10] him the keepers who have meant to be on
[28:13] guard with the seal with all the cameras
[28:15] did shake and became as
[28:55] me to come to Trinidad to be of service
[28:59] trusting to God that song we along the
[29:02] line we can be of a blessing I very much
[29:05] appreciate the support of my dear friend
[29:07] and brother Isaac it did all he could to
[29:12] get me down here without frustration
[29:17] so maybe not bless you sir and in
[29:21] absentia I want to appreciate past Oulu
[29:24] Emoto for only support for me to be done
[29:29] here he hasn't come yet boy in this
[29:31] great product in love and kindness it
[29:34] was a boot
[29:36] Oh underway so I pretty low blessing
[29:39] very much and there I appreciate all the
[29:47] servants of the Lord
[29:49] pastors both those that will speak and
[29:53] those that were supports the speakers I
[29:56] appreciate every one of you for your
[29:59] grace for your humility for your support
[30:02] for your kindness and for your
[30:04] generosity to come and be part of these
[30:07] meetings I pray the Lord bless every one
[30:09] of you appreciate the entire church for
[30:16] coming like I've always said when a
[30:20] preacher comes to town it is not our
[30:23] intention to come and preach to chairs
[30:25] and benches the gospel is not meant for
[30:28] them the gospel is meant for human
[30:31] beings so it's always a blessing and an
[30:34] encouragement to a preacher when the
[30:37] Lord give us people to speak to so we
[30:40] will never take your kindness that
[30:42] gesture for granted so we'll trust to
[30:45] the Lord that somewhere somehow we'll be
[30:47] of a blessing to you so thank you for
[30:50] coming tonight
[30:51] thank you for coming in the morning I'm
[30:54] taking an advance for how the community
[30:56] we do throughout these meetings may God
[30:59] bless you
[31:02] I bring greetings from Nigeria all the
[31:06] saints the pastors and everyone and my
[31:11] own pastor and all the brethren knew of
[31:15] my comment told me to give you a very
[31:18] kind regards to all the Saints here and
[31:22] my wife and children also requested that
[31:25] I greet every one of you everyone is
[31:28] doing fine and I'm sure they will be
[31:30] glad to know that the believers are
[31:33] doing when he made a lot bless you
[31:36] [Applause]
[31:43] and I sincerely know that all of you
[31:45] appreciated the service this morning the
[31:53] yielding trees
[31:55] atishoo to us that lessons and not being
[31:58] protected
[32:00] that was something and when Pastor crimp
[32:04] read in the morning it said we are
[32:07] unprotected here protected and I find
[32:10] our protection to be that perfect law if
[32:13] we can be yielding and yielding and
[32:16] yielding it will be taking us from glory
[32:18] to glory but that was something to my
[32:21] heart this morning
[32:23] and I pretty low bless you sir bless the
[32:26] family the ministry and the flock of God
[32:29] Park and England
[32:31] amen god bless you all if I do not if I
[32:36] do not greet anyone I shall have greeted
[32:38] forgive me it is not out of rudeness
[32:41] it's just because this is so much I can
[32:44] do right now god bless you
[32:46] so if the Lord will be our help tonight
[32:50] which I trust a will
[32:54] I want to speak on the subjects that I
[32:58] caught in this season of the harvest
[33:02] like pastor Chambliss said this morning
[33:05] that the harvest time is a very broad
[33:07] subject and it can be approached from
[33:10] several many angles because there are a
[33:13] lot of things that go into the harvest
[33:16] what I'm trusting to God that you know
[33:19] the scripture says the body of Christ is
[33:23] compacted together by what every joint
[33:27] supply so if the two of us tonight are
[33:31] not able to give adequate supply don't
[33:34] worry there are still five more supplies
[33:36] coming and I'm sure they will be able to
[33:39] fill in you wouldn't miss anything you
[33:42] watch to receive through these meetings
[33:45] so be less than short of that may I
[33:48] start even this other subject by saying
[33:51] that all your efforts to come and
[33:56] everything that you put in to come is
[33:58] like seed sowing
[34:00] that's what the Prophet said brother
[34:03] Brahm wants to preach in a place in
[34:07] Canada very remote many years ago and
[34:09] there was telling the church before he
[34:12] went is a see those brethren they and
[34:15] their remote parts and they do not have
[34:17] much so for them to make it to the
[34:20] meetings because of the value they
[34:22] attach to those meetings some of them
[34:24] would love to sell their horses there
[34:26] are cut rules and so forth some of them
[34:29] will have to each Ike some of them will
[34:31] have to come by transportation with
[34:33] element of walking in order to get to
[34:36] the meetings and the prophet tour
[34:38] discharge is that you see that is how to
[34:41] get much out of it because what they do
[34:45] goes with one form of sacrifice or the
[34:48] other those that sow in tears most
[34:52] certainly reap in joy so it's that they
[34:56] are putting in so much because of the
[34:58] value they attach to that program and I
[35:01] said that is the reason they usually get
[35:03] so so much so I want to tell you for all
[35:08] the sacrifices you have made you will
[35:11] get so so much the harvest will begin
[35:14] with you your coffers shall be full by
[35:18] the time their missions are over you
[35:20] will count your blessings and it will
[35:22] surprise you what the Lord has done
[35:25] just open your hearts to receive the
[35:28] blessings of God if you have a spiritual
[35:31] niche the law will may teach you say why
[35:34] because you have son you've got to ring
[35:36] if you other the physical needs the law
[35:39] will meet it cavalry takes care both way
[35:42] brother Bram said if he can save your
[35:45] soul it can also heal your body it can
[35:48] meet your needs
[35:49] it can fight your battles so let loose
[35:52] in his presence and I'm sure there'll be
[35:54] a lot of others
[35:55] [Applause]
[35:58] you love him tonight I was thinking of
[36:03] the men that brother Bram called John
[36:05] cherish just bear with me this is how I
[36:08] feel like going and when the Prophet met
[36:12] this man it was such a poor man it
[36:17] wasn't only poor life was unfair to him
[36:20] it was married but he had no child so
[36:24] everything to the negative was the
[36:26] portion of this brother
[36:28] but brother bran made some a statement
[36:31] that was very remarkably by John Terry's
[36:33] is that when this man eats the world it
[36:37] believed everything
[36:38] [Music]
[36:40] and that power of the fridge in the
[36:43] world began to propel in John Charlie
[36:46] was no longer himself then you know it
[36:49] was living like in a two room house that
[36:52] he has used all his entire life savings
[36:54] and walking to acquire but then because
[36:58] of the value attached to the gospel a
[37:02] man of God came into the town to settle
[37:05] down and spread the gospel if an LED of
[37:08] the Lord this will sound unusual to many
[37:11] of us it will sound like a man out of
[37:13] his mind
[37:14] people take out of what they have but
[37:18] John chariot was gonna take out of
[37:20] nothing
[37:21] she was gonna be like that with a woman
[37:24] she dropped all our two minds that's all
[37:27] she had and jesus said she went for much
[37:31] more wattage than those who brought
[37:34] millions it's because the Armenians came
[37:37] out of their billions in support this
[37:40] one came out of nothing it is true -
[37:43] true it left her with zero but because
[37:46] of the value she attached
[37:51] you do open things etana Oh glory to God
[37:59] John chariots left his house and brother
[38:01] Bram said is got a very godly wife who
[38:05] made life easy for him they left the
[38:08] house completely not a saloon or say
[38:12] range they undead it completely as a
[38:15] gift to the men of God without a plan
[38:18] for where they we pass the night the man
[38:22] of God struggle to refuse it but John
[38:25] said the Lord told me to do this so John
[38:29] stood right there and he had to I
[38:32] Burnett squatted somewhere for the night
[38:34] and when a woman who never knew God she
[38:40] wasn't a Christian when she saw them and
[38:42] said I was going on here
[38:44] it's a it was happy to declare testimony
[38:47] the Lord told me to do this and I've
[38:49] done so what is left for you John it had
[38:52] nothing it said okay you know what I
[38:54] will give you my garage to stay if you
[38:57] will pay the wages of dressing my
[38:59] cutting so it's going to cultivate dress
[39:04] and make the garden okay but the payment
[39:07] he will receive for dressing the garden
[39:10] will be the garage is given to leave
[39:14] John gladly accepted it and the John
[39:18] will dress the garden and in the evening
[39:20] you know and after doing that they will
[39:22] go and look for something to do in the
[39:24] evening it will sit somewhere by the
[39:26] compound of the house and start reading
[39:28] his Bible
[39:29] then this woman begins to pay attention
[39:32] to John what was in that book that makes
[39:37] this man so loved and so interested
[39:40] every time without John Charlie's saying
[39:45] one word his life began to preach and
[39:49] the woman you know peeps to see what
[39:53] book he was reading and it turned out to
[39:56] be a Bible and the woman went to the
[39:58] shop to buy a severe Bible and started
[40:02] reading also I want to know what was
[40:05] John's interest what was attracting John
[40:09] in that book and she started reading
[40:13] Bible and by the time she started
[40:16] reading Bible the lot began to minister
[40:18] to her and that opened up a channel for
[40:22] this woman to hear from God and the same
[40:25] God who spoke to John spoke to her
[40:34] and and is that God give John $10,000
[40:39] and this woman who has never been to
[40:43] church never hesitated she runs the
[40:46] attack and came to John is a God who
[40:49] told you to leave your house told me to
[40:52] give you two alone you $10,000 John said
[40:57] to watch is that I don't know you go ask
[41:00] him and John went and asked the Lord
[41:09] because he hasn't seen such a money
[41:11] before together and the Lord said to him
[41:14] okay you start a building business a
[41:18] property selling business go look for a
[41:21] property you sell in a urinal vated
[41:24] salad and like that and this brothers
[41:27] started that and the breath of God began
[41:31] to come upon it and the breath of God
[41:34] began to come upon it and the orphan
[41:36] started expanding started expanding and
[41:40] it has it has banded so much until when
[41:44] the Prophet was telling the story of
[41:46] this brother is a right now John
[41:49] cherished as 1,500 actors not a COS
[41:54] actors and is employing more than 15,000
[41:58] Mexicans to work on that farm and hardly
[42:02] be paid four million dollars to the
[42:05] cause of the gospel and as a right now
[42:07] right now brother John has got so a lot
[42:12] of children until is beginning to has
[42:14] got to slow down is that as I'm talking
[42:17] to you now the reason John couldn't be
[42:19] in this mission is because the weather's
[42:21] just put too bad
[42:24] [Music]
[42:27] that was a woman who was Barrett and
[42:30] brother Brad middleman he said see what
[42:33] 15 years see what difference 15 years a
[42:36] in the life of that man
[42:40] he said because that man switched to the
[42:42] Lord and is ripping bunch of alarbus so
[42:46] whatever you are dream for the Lord
[42:47] don't slack don't be discouraged I'm
[42:51] declaring harvest because there shall be
[42:54] and harvest amen
[42:56] nobody plant one seat and leave just one
[43:00] seat a first time is always an
[43:04] interesting time
[43:11] plans to be sure harvest
[43:15] [Music]
[43:15] [Applause]
[43:20] you love him tonight okay
[43:23] [Applause]
[43:26] I just thought your sense that maybe
[43:31] it's going to help somebody maybe it's
[43:33] going to encourage somebody okay let's
[43:36] make that our background and look at the
[43:39] glitch husband man himself the Lord
[43:42] Jesus of the Gentiles
[43:56] maybe complexes of thinking about this
[44:05] pasta or dis man called Jesus but anyhow
[44:10] the things that we are saying was too
[44:14] attractive for them to ignore Jesus so
[44:19] they decided to take a trip anyhow
[44:22] whether they understood the program or
[44:25] not when I do understood what he
[44:27] preached or not whether they understood
[44:30] this instruction or not it doesn't
[44:32] matter
[44:33] they wanted a taste and the Bible says
[44:40] they devised a plan to approach Jesus
[44:43] and they went through some of the
[44:46] Apostles as an excuse me sir can you
[44:49] oppose booked an appointment and the man
[44:52] said
[44:53] - who - pastor Jesus who are you we are
[44:56] Greeks I would love to tell my fellow
[44:59] colleague and unroot elytis to another
[45:03] person and the two of them came and say
[45:06] pastor the Greeks are interested in
[45:10] seeing you amen now when you see the
[45:14] Prophet preached I will see Jesus is not
[45:17] preaching just seen him as a person they
[45:22] want to see the working of Jesus
[45:24] [Applause]
[45:26] that is a meaning of sass we will see
[45:29] Jesus and you know Jesus when asked that
[45:34] request is said now it's my time for
[45:37] purification you won't understand - it
[45:42] won't be glorified until he dies if the
[45:46] Gentiles are beginning to have an
[45:48] awakening that they need me they want to
[45:53] enjoy my walking they want to see my
[45:56] power they want to be a my effect then
[45:59] something has gotta take place now then
[46:06] Jesus give them a parable he said except
[46:10] a corn of wheat dies if we abide a law
[46:16] that one con will remain one come and if
[46:21] it says long that one can we be hedging
[46:24] and it should be depreciated but if that
[46:28] one con will produce ma is got to be
[46:31] ready to die so God believes in harvest
[46:40] amen
[46:41] it's as long as such this one con dies
[46:44] it will abide alone by itself the
[46:47] disciples may not understand what he has
[46:50] passed a message then gradually the one
[46:53] con began to talk about his death and
[46:57] like you add in the morning Pizza will
[46:59] say over my dead body will you die
[47:04] you got a lot of zeroes people in the
[47:06] church it's fine
[47:07] it will get better with them as they
[47:10] keep growing in the Lord Peter thought
[47:13] was doing crazy people but I didn't
[47:15] realize that by that it was trying to
[47:18] stop God's program anyhow the divine
[47:21] program couldn't be stopped it came to
[47:24] that particular day our Lord went down
[47:28] the reason it went down is to be able to
[47:31] multiply so God knew that if you plant
[47:35] one seed of kin
[47:36] you are going to get up he's a cop even
[47:38] not to cops
[47:40] I'm gonna cop you have many seeds of
[47:43] come a local challenge
[47:47] now I'm preaching this because this is
[47:49] the kind of advanced God preached this
[47:52] is the kind of others Jesus our Lord
[47:55] preached this is the kind of average
[47:57] brother Brahm preached FS is not the
[48:00] rapture I Fest is something that will
[48:02] take place before the rapture it might
[48:05] sound strange to you but that is the
[48:07] truth okay let's go on alright
[48:13] so when he died settin knowing that if
[48:18] this man get off there's gonna be a
[48:22] problem is it
[48:26] I don't know when Christ was alive his
[48:29] life was a problem when he died it was a
[48:35] problem when a rose brother it was also
[48:39] a problem but is there a problem to you
[48:43] it's just aside you belong now these
[48:53] people watching while alive now he has
[48:56] given up the ghost year that of the
[48:58] ghost they confirmed it's themselves
[49:01] they were the one who handed over the
[49:04] body to be buried and when it was buried
[49:09] they came back to Pilate
[49:12] excuse me Pilate excuses governor you
[49:16] see this deceiver
[49:18] then we are actually afraid because they
[49:22] know that everything I had ever spoken
[49:25] nothing has ever filled and while he was
[49:28] alive he told them I have the power to
[49:31] lay down my life nobody ever talked like
[49:36] that because nobody lived by himself
[49:39] nobody exists by himself
[49:42] the only one qualified to be hello him
[49:45] is the one who come in the body called
[49:47] Christ I am was before hey bruh he
[49:53] rejoiced to see my day before Abraham
[49:56] was I have the knew everything he had
[50:02] spoken had come to pass and you watch
[50:06] the politics watch something he said
[50:09] that deceiver when he was alive since
[50:12] that we were raised on the third day and
[50:16] we know that we seem to have an idea
[50:19] that it will not happen hmm
[50:21] but so we want you to let I am more
[50:26] amore and security and seal the place so
[50:31] that nobody will come and tell our story
[50:33] now these people are bad politicians and
[50:38] they are very wicked do you know when
[50:41] you tell the truth
[50:42] you will be consistent but because be
[50:46] these people we align they couldn't be
[50:48] consistent I will show you the align now
[50:51] one of the reasons they killed Jesus
[50:54] Christ was to say that he said if we
[50:57] destroy our temple and on the touch day
[51:01] it will Reza talk they pretended then as
[51:04] if they did not understand what jesus H
[51:08] so this their position is against their
[51:12] better judgment
[51:14] then knew that wasn't what Jesus Christ
[51:17] said Jesus wasn't talking of destroying
[51:20] physica temple he was talking of the
[51:23] temple of himself but when it was
[51:26] convenient they came to use it as an
[51:29] exhibit in order to get him crucified
[51:35] then why did they change the story of
[51:38] the crucifixion to say that this man
[51:40] said on the touch they realize oh he
[51:43] didn't say it twice is that it at the
[51:46] same place that the Miskin truth the
[51:54] only thing that can make you constant is
[51:57] if you tell the truth so it's just that
[52:00] these people we Elias these people we
[52:03] are deceivers they understood better
[52:05] what Jesus said but because of the needs
[52:08] to gather false accusation against him
[52:12] they said easily with destroy a temple
[52:14] now they are no more talking about the
[52:17] temple they are now talking about
[52:18] himself
[52:20] [Applause]
[52:21] [Music]
[52:27] yes brother we exposing the devil
[52:30] and the governor said I don't understand
[52:34] you people again when this man was alive
[52:37] it was your problem now is dead is your
[52:40] headache
[52:41] excuse me you have the Lord you have the
[52:44] enforcement agenda police and everything
[52:46] and the soldiers go on attend to eat as
[52:49] much as you wanted you know what was
[52:52] happening the devil was using those guys
[52:55] to disrupt the arrests the ones that
[53:01] planted seeds to die and rotten and
[53:03] never bring forth life but there is
[53:07] nothing that can stop God's program the
[53:10] law of God is does the soul in tears
[53:14] mas reap in joy nothing can stop it
[53:21] nothing absolutely can stop his
[53:25] resurrection it has done be spoken it
[53:28] must come to pass
[53:30] [Applause]
[53:37] so excuse me
[53:43] so what happened they went to the grave
[53:48] they put several Roman seals that is one
[53:52] other time let's leave that one but they
[53:54] put to those hills and the I admin
[53:56] machineries and soldiers yes looking guy
[54:00] with sophisticated weapons to do what to
[54:04] block the office because they know if
[54:12] Jesus ever rise up according to his
[54:16] principles of John chapter 12 there's
[54:18] going to be problem
[54:20] Satan was contending with just one man
[54:23] but is now after is not going to face
[54:26] many member body of the same one can you
[54:32] catch that
[54:33] that is God's harvests
[54:41] so they put everything in there but I
[54:46] like it when the scripture said on the
[54:48] tenth day the angel of the Lord came
[54:51] down where were these guys that didn't
[54:57] sleep that we are wide awake God kept
[55:02] them wide awake to see everything that
[55:05] happened in there being wide awake that
[55:08] we are shaken that we are shaken and
[55:11] this angel came he broke the seal and
[55:16] erode away the stone and is such upon
[55:20] ease tryna challenge try me if you can
[55:25] we tell your weapons we tell your palms
[55:29] we tell your tillery's try me if you can
[55:32] and the sergeants couldn't they couldn't
[55:36] do it then they can do it nothing will
[55:42] stop this office nothing will stop your
[55:46] body change nothing will stop your
[55:49] resurrection nothing will stop your
[55:52] abduction because it has been squirted
[55:55] it must come to pass having a natural
[55:59] pass away God's Word can never pass away
[56:03] there is not enough demons in hell that
[56:06] can stop it
[56:15] they can stop your display they can stop
[56:18] your demonstration we have a promise a
[56:21] quick short walk will take place in here
[56:24] we have a promise there will be another
[56:27] outpouring brother prams head in our
[56:31] spiritual race listen to me is that the
[56:35] vehicle of the bride ad outrun that of
[56:38] the Antichrist in the message looking
[56:41] away to Jesus is that what we are doing
[56:44] now is to slow down and waiting for them
[56:47] to catch up he said when they catch up
[56:50] watch the truck pull them what you see
[56:54] temporarily manifested will come in its
[56:57] fullness the trouble is in existence
[57:01] right now but it will not come in a
[57:05] great measure until that time something
[57:09] will provoke it the Antichrist will
[57:12] provoke it and we are waiting for them
[57:15] nothing will stop our demonstration
[57:24] let me remind your church this is not
[57:28] the edge of horse
[57:29] so no sacrificial animal here this is
[57:34] the edge of he go when the enemy comes
[57:37] like a float we have a promise the
[57:41] Spirit of the Lord will raise a standard
[57:44] when a stand that is risen it goes above
[57:48] the floor come on friends and wonderful
[57:53] time is ahead don't worry don't worry
[57:56] brother Brahm said this quiz will be
[58:00] here fellowship in like these will
[58:03] become fond memories he said is gonna
[58:06] put a pressure on us until we are almost
[58:08] pressed out is that what you've got
[58:11] nothing to be afraid of because at that
[58:14] hour
[58:15] oh there's gonna be a revival of the
[58:20] jaws there's gonna be another pouring

[1:03:08] sleep say we won't entertain questions
[1:03:14] because it's actually shameful for a
[1:03:16] soldier to be sleeping at such a
[1:03:22] critical time so they they had it all
[1:03:25] arranged and the Bible said the news
[1:03:28] that it was stolen started travelling
[1:03:32] further than the news that it
[1:03:35] resurrected and you say you would have
[1:03:41] expected Jesus to do something about
[1:03:43] that look at that
[1:03:48] you would have expected him to come out
[1:03:51] and organize a counter press conference
[1:03:53] some of us that is what we will do but
[1:03:57] that is not what Christ will do adoption
[1:04:01] material amen
[1:04:04] take something from here he does allow
[1:04:07] the news to be going he knew that nobody
[1:04:10] can blight his name and it didn't even
[1:04:13] make it easy at least appear to some few
[1:04:17] public people let them testify even if
[1:04:21] they will call it apparition if they
[1:04:23] will call it illusion let them call it
[1:04:25] what appear to somebody the Bible says
[1:04:27] Jesus never did that he appeared only to
[1:04:31] those who shared connection
[1:04:33] I guess those news were going around do
[1:04:40] you know what he chose to do silently it
[1:04:43] began to empower an army because now
[1:04:47] what the devil was pushing him to do
[1:04:50] will have broken the scripture the seed
[1:04:53] of corn has died
[1:04:54] it is rotting and it has come back alive
[1:04:58] it's coming back alive is to reproduce
[1:05:02] himself in plentiful so it is not longer
[1:05:06] it is no longer the Ministry of Christ
[1:05:09] to defend himself it did all that the
[1:05:13] proof is point before it died after is
[1:05:17] dead and resurrection
[1:05:19] it is left for his body to stop giving
[1:05:22] the proof that is not dead
[1:05:26] [Music]
[1:05:28] this was why Jesus refused him is not
[1:05:34] that empowering is before it started
[1:05:36] empowering them they disciples I see
[1:05:39] what they are saying is that don't worry
[1:05:40] we shall apply them we shall apply them
[1:05:44] you get this you catch this you catch
[1:05:47] this and it was fortifying them when
[1:05:50] they finish the fortification is that
[1:05:52] the ceiling of your fortification is the
[1:05:54] apparel you can stay there when that
[1:05:58] power comes you will be my witnesses
[1:06:00] those lights they are talking it will
[1:06:03] never take you one week to change the
[1:06:05] story I am giving you what it takes to
[1:06:09] change the story so don't mind what they
[1:06:12] are saying the devil cannot make me obey
[1:06:15] him he wants to push me to take over
[1:06:18] your own ministry Christ is not going to
[1:06:21] take away yours he has done is it
[1:06:24] is not for you to take it over from
[1:06:26] there this was why he refused to reply
[1:06:30] he refused to all the press conference
[1:06:37] there on the day of Pentecost the Holy
[1:06:40] Ghost fare the Holy Ghost fell with the
[1:06:44] falling of the Holy Ghost came the
[1:06:46] understanding of the way because by -
[1:06:49] Pizza understood what Matthew 28 was he
[1:06:52] knew it wasn't in titles it has got to
[1:06:54] be in a name
[1:06:55] so the first salmon was a salmon with
[1:06:58] revelation in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:07:00] and they keep in ansan they charge and
[1:07:03] the people began to look at them very
[1:07:06] differently then one day Peter James and
[1:07:10] John the sons are walking they want to
[1:07:14] go to the temple and one man who has
[1:07:18] always been there everybody knew him the
[1:07:22] critics know him the believers know him
[1:07:25] the unbelievers know him so if something
[1:07:28] happened to him it cannot be said it's a
[1:07:31] lie because everybody knew him and this
[1:07:34] man began to look at this tree James
[1:07:37] remain as if to get something from them
[1:07:41] he wanted a little TT dollars to service
[1:07:46] problem temporarily but inside this
[1:07:49] earthen vessel was a deposit of
[1:07:52] permanent solution was a deposit of
[1:07:56] eternal life my goodness inside this
[1:07:59] earthen vessels is a deposit of eternal
[1:08:03] life to give life to give healing to
[1:08:07] give deliverance to even give salvation
[1:08:12] [Music]
[1:08:18] so Peter said look on Hoss TT dollars
[1:08:23] u.s. dollars British pounds we don't
[1:08:25] have as old as you people are
[1:08:28] well-dressed gentlemen you don't have
[1:08:31] sometimes it's like that we don't have
[1:08:35] [Applause]
[1:08:36] but such as we have this is the obvious
[1:08:42] now this is the harvest now such as we
[1:08:47] have will give unto you they did not
[1:08:51] even breathe they only spoke this what
[1:08:56] as Christ's such as we have will give
[1:09:00] unto you in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:09:03] rise up and walk
[1:09:06] and the Bible signs the man the man the
[1:09:11] man is status now what began to work
[1:09:16] upon him and it began to get estranged
[1:09:19] and in such a got enough and it begins
[1:09:22] to walk and to live and to praise the
[1:09:26] Lord
[1:09:26] what in lipping pressing the Lord
[1:09:30] walking limping pressing
[1:09:33] [Applause]
[1:09:40] they're such is a stitch that's what the
[1:09:44] album's in anyone has did such no one
[1:09:52] that enhance York when the people shot
[1:09:55] these people as a little forget it
[1:09:58] this guys are christ-like in haha watch
[1:10:01] this if planting of Christ as we produce
[1:10:05] many Christ this is the harvest
[1:10:10] [Applause]
[1:10:16] oh and guess what up on top the news of
[1:10:23] this Reviva went everywhere they haven't
[1:10:27] seen anything like blood and be some
[1:10:31] guys who were critics it gots to them so
[1:10:35] with the way this team is going but we
[1:10:39] suppress we put so much millions for the
[1:10:41] press to suppress this news and yet this
[1:10:44] news is traveling Jesus is wiser it
[1:10:52] doesn't only talk a Hawks the gospel is
[1:10:58] not just in watch there must be a
[1:11:01] demonstration oh it doesn't only talk he
[1:11:08] hacks then they called the disciples
[1:11:13] what they were afraid to hear that we
[1:11:16] hear it now watch in Acts chapter 3 said
[1:11:19] by what power and what name did you do
[1:11:23] it Peter is an opportunity I wanted I
[1:11:28] wanted my lord to organize a press
[1:11:31] conference long time ago he didn't do it
[1:11:34] now you people have organized a press
[1:11:36] conference and I will take advantage
[1:11:38] okay
[1:11:39] all of you listen now listen now you see
[1:11:44] the same Jesus whom you crucified
[1:11:50] hallelujah you crucified Him but God
[1:11:57] rest him it aside we saw him with touch
[1:12:02] him we felt him we impressive and we
[1:12:07] know that in resurrected nothing Jesus
[1:12:12] fetch in his name heal this man who can
[1:12:18] challenge such a press conference so
[1:12:24] Jesus was defending his integrity in his
[1:12:28] many member bodies that is the Amish
[1:12:33] [Applause]
[1:12:43] [Music]
[1:12:44] [Applause]
[1:12:47] that is why brother Brown says the first
[1:12:51] office was Pentecost is a quotation etc
[1:12:57] is that the first of s was Pentecost
[1:13:01] if there was an harvest of Pentecost
[1:13:03] that means there was a situation to
[1:13:06] bring about our harvest then is there
[1:13:10] after Pentecost when she cost itself by
[1:13:15] the Apostles became another seed swing
[1:13:22] [Music]
[1:13:24] because it starts at the beginning of
[1:13:27] many members body whereas it was always
[1:13:31] one person it has now become the body of
[1:13:35] that one person with many members are
[1:13:38] you catching the Church of the Living
[1:13:42] then it became the new deposits for
[1:13:47] another office brother Brahm said this
[1:13:52] new deposit which is not the deposit
[1:13:55] this soil of the bridegroom now but of
[1:13:58] his bride was buried at listen cancel
[1:14:07] so the truth was held until the edges of
[1:14:12] the charge went into the dark era that's
[1:14:15] what is saying and it looks like that is
[1:14:19] the end to each but bring the principle
[1:14:22] of John chapter 12 again for any sea to
[1:14:28] multiply itself which the multiplication
[1:14:33] is the average there must be a plant in
[1:14:37] fresh God wasn't satisfied with the
[1:14:41] number he gathered in Pentecost he
[1:14:47] wanted more but soffits that we don't
[1:14:51] want less men we one warm
[1:14:53] that's inspiration from God so you know
[1:14:59] what it is what was buried all of a
[1:15:04] sudden in luta started giving a shoot so
[1:15:09] this one is not actually dead and gone
[1:15:14] it was all God's program those thoughts
[1:15:18] are not a mighty Reviva
[1:15:21] [Applause]
[1:15:25] now lucha didn't carry the entire
[1:15:29] picture of the siege don't take it off
[1:15:34] when the seed is buried to the ground if
[1:15:37] you are digging it off you are gonna
[1:15:39] kill it completely just leave it
[1:15:42] if you have a moment it looks like
[1:15:45] nothing is happening or will ever happen
[1:15:48] when you just leave it as long as it is
[1:15:52] an original seat The Sun will be just
[1:16:01] right for you then what I will be just
[1:16:05] right for it God is never a loser is the
[1:16:11] best farmer I ever knew
[1:16:19] you know again in that dark in that
[1:16:22] period again the devil went on a rampage
[1:16:24] and he started accusing God
[1:16:28] the silence God gods did not respond as
[1:16:31] usual God allow him to be making his
[1:16:35] noise then a looter
[1:16:39] he gave a shoot which is a sign that in
[1:16:46] life that was buried under a started his
[1:16:50] journey of physical manifestation now
[1:16:57] that life which was a stock moved from
[1:17:01] the stock into tassel amen brother
[1:17:07] Bramson lucha was like a former in then
[1:17:11] Wesley became its lottery then from that
[1:17:17] tassel it moved into the shock Tasha was
[1:17:23] Wesley now all these stages stages of
[1:17:28] the potential siege but it is not the
[1:17:32] seat yet
[1:17:39] the profits that if I need an oak tree
[1:17:42] and you give me a seat of oak
[1:17:47] potentially I have my hope tree now the
[1:17:51] husband man must be patient to plant a
[1:17:56] seed and to do the work of conservation
[1:17:59] and induces it will get the Hope tree it
[1:18:07] is only impatience to with process life
[1:18:10] all right so it moves gradually the life
[1:18:16] left the stalk it came into the tussle
[1:18:19] and from the tussle it moved into the
[1:18:22] shop now the short it's always looking
[1:18:28] like the real thing but it is not the
[1:18:34] real thing
[1:18:36] hey what the shot is necessary to
[1:18:40] certain times I'm sure you enjoy the
[1:18:43] blessings of the morning
[1:18:46] and that is why in this age called loud
[1:18:50] this year the first move of God in loud
[1:18:54] dision age was a Pentecostal move we are
[1:19:00] bringing it up to us now this age
[1:19:03] started as a Pentecostal age that was
[1:19:09] the period of the shock Laden CEA's got
[1:19:12] two phases for the believer underline
[1:19:17] the word for the believer for
[1:19:20] non-believer is just got one face but
[1:19:24] for the seed of God in this hour there
[1:19:26] are two phases the Pentecostal
[1:19:29] experience is very important it is your
[1:19:33] shock experience to prepare you for the
[1:19:36] real thing that's what the prophets
[1:19:41] taught by a brother Graham says for you
[1:19:45] to get their wish you must pull the shop
[1:19:50] away or the grain must abandon the shock
[1:19:54] [Music]
[1:19:55] that was what we have been told in the
[1:19:58] morning and it was simplified to even
[1:20:01] our personal lives you catchin it why
[1:20:05] you must agree with the shock because
[1:20:09] the shocks protection will not
[1:20:12] facilitate ripening it's a good
[1:20:18] protection to keep this grain till
[1:20:22] certain stage but in the hour of a vest
[1:20:29] for the entropy harvest some Tomas
[1:20:33] happens to the shop are you catchin it
[1:20:37] and this is why if you look at certain
[1:20:40] stories of redemption you will realize
[1:20:45] that the journey of redemption always
[1:20:48] starts with two categories let's go to
[1:20:51] the Bible do you know the roof was
[1:20:57] brought into the economy of redemption
[1:20:59] in Israel in the season of badly arrests
[1:21:06] aha the Prophet said we're bring my
[1:21:10] understanding from the scripture is to
[1:21:12] do types and shadows we are not
[1:21:16] geologists so we can do tessaro's and
[1:21:19] all kind of this but we'll bring the
[1:21:20] pattern from the scriptures are you
[1:21:24] following now roots book of you and her
[1:21:28] it's a perfect time because Ruth was a
[1:21:32] Gentile who was brought to enjoy the
[1:21:36] blessings who was brought by
[1:21:38] kinsman-redeemer she into the economy
[1:21:41] and the blessings that used to be the
[1:21:44] preserve of Israel and it was important
[1:21:47] for roots to come
[1:21:51] [Music]
[1:21:54] the design for roots to be in the
[1:21:56] picture was necessary to give you a
[1:22:00] perfect shadow otherwise you will not be
[1:22:04] able to relate with your Redemption now
[1:22:07] [Applause]
[1:22:09] roots coming into the economy of Israel
[1:22:12] wasn't an accident
[1:22:15] brother Brant preached why it had to be
[1:22:17] Bethlehem and it told us in that message
[1:22:21] that before the foundation of the world
[1:22:23] God has designed and arranges program
[1:22:26] and part of that program is to include
[1:22:29] the Gentiles in the salvation plan as a
[1:22:33] matter of facts the true women the
[1:22:36] buttes to the sensory of Jesus we are
[1:22:39] gentle women you talk about rare and you
[1:22:47] talk about Ruth come on friends I feel
[1:22:51] so good I'm a 10 time
[1:22:59] and look out beautiful disease God took
[1:23:03] people who look worthless Moab was
[1:23:09] almost an abomination to Israelites you
[1:23:13] know their background they came out of
[1:23:16] instance she was living oh my
[1:23:20] and whatever rare that woman who was so
[1:23:24] much in prostitution until a lot became
[1:23:27] a sunny gray up the a lot do you ever
[1:23:30] notice annamaria a lot was a surname but
[1:23:37] messy rewrote their lives it is not in
[1:23:44] the wheelage not in their own age oh man
[1:23:49] it is God as you add message the race is
[1:23:53] not for the Swift's not a batch of
[1:23:55] artists wrong
[1:24:05] [Music]
[1:24:07] hallelujah Ruth can aim in the season of
[1:24:14] others and when she started that journey
[1:24:18] to come she didn't stutter alone she
[1:24:21] didn't start alone she started with
[1:24:23] another lady who looks like ah they were
[1:24:28] both called daughters-in-law one was
[1:24:33] upper one was Ruth and the boats decided
[1:24:39] hallelujah I'm pretty pastor the boat's
[1:24:42] decided to come with Nami in the season
[1:24:47] of Ava's hey hey I'm gonna touch
[1:24:54] someone's now for you to know that
[1:24:58] whatever is happening along the message
[1:25:01] today shouldn't discourage you oh these
[1:25:07] are things that are to be if the picture
[1:25:11] will be perfect you have some people who
[1:25:14] are previous message for 40 years and
[1:25:17] today they are talking the same message
[1:25:19] they never attacked it in 1965 they
[1:25:23] never attacked it in 1962 what they are
[1:25:26] talking it now because it is the season
[1:25:29] of the office
[1:25:31] [Applause]
[1:25:33] and the picture must become perfect
[1:25:38] I've got no apologies for such nonsense
[1:25:42] whether I believe this I know Dutch
[1:25:45] design I don't care
[1:25:47] [Applause]
[1:25:52] somebody once told me United States you
[1:25:55] say you could be shot for that as a just
[1:25:57] one bullet if God allows you but you
[1:26:01] cannot suppress me from saying the truth
[1:26:05] I am a witness of the resurrection and
[1:26:08] the power of the Lord Jesus Christ I
[1:26:12] must add press conference all the time
[1:26:20] [Music]
[1:26:27] it is a season of a novice and up as
[1:26:31] Monsieur hawk
[1:26:35] it wasn't easy to get up out of the
[1:26:38] journey she travelled very far
[1:26:41] Alleluia until now me preached a message
[1:26:45] of up lessness because it is all about
[1:26:51] what they can get out of it if they can
[1:26:56] no longer catch anything then nothing is
[1:26:59] longer the truth
[1:27:00] they told women not to wear trousers but
[1:27:04] the moment they denied a message there
[1:27:06] was not that we are in pants what has
[1:27:09] been their value for 40 years nonsense
[1:27:14] [Applause]
[1:27:21] Nermin looks are there two of them is
[1:27:24] the excuse me ladies
[1:27:26] maybe you don't understand what is
[1:27:28] happening I'm saying that I'm an old
[1:27:31] woman I'm saying that there is no more
[1:27:33] child in my womb let's even say God
[1:27:35] allow me to am a child and they it
[1:27:38] becomes a son or two boys or twins now
[1:27:41] you people are maybe I don't know that
[1:27:43] you're twenty late twenties and before
[1:27:46] this boy can marry you you will have
[1:27:48] become fifty and you will become will
[1:27:50] you wait for them till that along
[1:27:53] opposite that make sense
[1:27:56] [Applause]
[1:28:00] is a that made sense that made sense so
[1:28:04] many nonsenses are making sense toward
[1:28:08] you opposite of this our today he wasn't
[1:28:12] there when when Wendy Wendy Wendy Ringo
[1:28:16] of cloud appeared that makes sense he
[1:28:18] wasn't there it's not a news who was the
[1:28:23] first person who told you it wasn't
[1:28:24] there it was brother Brown because you
[1:28:27] don't read your message correctly curly
[1:28:30] the message three kinds of believers
[1:28:31] it's a decision upon it at two days
[1:28:34] before I got there
[1:28:35] or two days after I went there it was
[1:28:38] brother Graham who said we didn't plant
[1:28:42] it in the tapes from day one that was
[1:28:44] his first public commentary so it is not
[1:28:47] news for you to come and tell us that we
[1:28:49] have discovered his life he never lied
[1:28:52] but what you cannot deny is the fact
[1:28:55] that that happened because witnesses a
[1:28:58] bunch today only prophet told to take
[1:29:01] cover
[1:29:02] while the angels came down if you think
[1:29:05] it was after it got there brother Bram
[1:29:08] said it was the angels departing after
[1:29:11] their message if you say it was before
[1:29:14] it was after it was before he got there
[1:29:17] it was the angels lowering down to give
[1:29:20] the message he already said that so you
[1:29:22] are not telling us something new
[1:29:31] but for the Hoppus of this hour it makes
[1:29:34] sense it will look so real to you but
[1:29:40] you know us certain things are written
[1:29:43] in order to take care of Appa in the
[1:29:49] message of villain of God brother Bram
[1:29:51] say we have to say things deliberately
[1:29:53] sometimes and he said it is
[1:29:57] intentionally safe it will cause some to
[1:30:01] ponder it will cause some to sit down
[1:30:04] and say lord have mercy upon me it will
[1:30:07] cause him to stumble out and they will
[1:30:10] stain the compound wondering whether to
[1:30:12] come back or to square wave and if you
[1:30:15] make some to go completely away but the
[1:30:18] Prophet said that is done intentionally
[1:30:20] because every seed line must be taken
[1:30:23] care of
[1:30:23] come on friends the dynamics of the true
[1:30:27] church and the false charge is in the
[1:30:30] end of one man
[1:30:31] [Applause]
[1:30:37] brother Ram said The Messenger of God
[1:30:39] will speak for God to puts the true
[1:30:43] church and the first church but it is
[1:30:46] actually a messenger to the true church
[1:30:50] but since God does not have too much
[1:30:53] he's gonna use only one mouthpiece that
[1:30:57] one mouthpiece we bring the light for
[1:31:00] the hour and every plantation vegetation
[1:31:04] whether good or bad they need sunlight
[1:31:09] sunlight is not going to change your
[1:31:12] seat what is going to transform that
[1:31:14] seat through different stages to come to
[1:31:18] its maturity and achieve its purpose so
[1:31:22] Judas Iscariot being part of Christ
[1:31:25] disciple was not accidental
[1:31:28] Jesus chose him listen to me he chose
[1:31:33] him and from day one I knew who he was
[1:31:39] several times
[1:31:41] II told him who he was somebody will
[1:31:44] deceive me and somebody will deny me
[1:31:47] somebody will betray me this was a
[1:31:50] mighty one a very one when it comes to
[1:31:53] Judas it douse it in another day he said
[1:31:57] the man who is dependent with me now but
[1:32:02] do you know what he couldn't do that
[1:32:04] betrayal
[1:32:05] until Islam was right then they waited
[1:32:08] for his dynamics who gave him his
[1:32:11] inspiration the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:32:13] Himself Jesus look at him one day and
[1:32:16] said that which thou do it too quickly
[1:32:21] it was a first charge but it was
[1:32:25] inspired by Jesus come on friends to do
[1:32:29] his own work there are not too light in
[1:32:33] this hour whether they accept or deny
[1:32:36] the message of the hour is God's light
[1:32:39] for today and whatever city you have
[1:32:42] where the tears or which you must
[1:32:45] interact with the message this is what
[1:32:50] there is no problem in the message
[1:32:52] brother Brahm said many will come within
[1:32:55] the range of the message
[1:32:57] the range is defense of the message is
[1:33:00] about only few people with a special
[1:33:03] hearing ability which is otherwise
[1:33:06] called revelation will come inside
[1:33:17] you love him tonight amen
[1:33:21] so up mama's always be here and Ruth
[1:33:25] will be here
[1:33:26] they were priests they were preached the
[1:33:29] same message nama didn't isolate Ruth to
[1:33:34] preach one message and isolated Appa
[1:33:38] just as God never isolated Cain and Abel
[1:33:41] all the seed line started from Genesis
[1:33:44] brother Graham said the planter was from
[1:33:47] Genesis and throughout the ages we have
[1:33:50] seen the seed line that we come to final
[1:33:53] events in this last hour
[1:33:56] Jesus God told Cain and Abel offer me
[1:33:59] something token it was fruits he never
[1:34:05] brought something bad it brought the
[1:34:07] best what a like the revelation of the
[1:34:10] blood to Apple it was the blood that is
[1:34:14] why we think I know it was there I know
[1:34:17] it was

[1:50:14] David and from David Camm the Lord Jesus
[1:50:18] Christ roots generation are you here in
[1:50:25] the season of the Havas now let me close
[1:50:33] with this
[1:50:34] Robitaille
[1:50:42] the 12 spies in the first Exodus a man
[1:50:47] realized when the deadheads arose when
[1:50:52] the TEDx arose the first Exodus the
[1:50:55] second Exodus and this is the third one
[1:50:58] I must not fail to say this so bear with
[1:51:02] me all right
[1:51:03] in the first Exodus God was taken in
[1:51:06] nation out of a nation the second was
[1:51:10] taken a charge out of religion and this
[1:51:14] last one is taken the bride out of the
[1:51:16] church is taking the bride out of the
[1:51:21] shock because they with cannot mature in
[1:51:29] the Pentecostal age of love this year
[1:51:34] okay this then these 12 spies
[1:51:39] I'm gonna close on this and I would
[1:51:43] trust the Lord to walk in the spirit
[1:51:46] through the rest of the men of God
[1:51:49] these twelve spies they were sent out
[1:51:52] for spying in a vest season this other
[1:51:59] season is something you were really
[1:52:00] inspired me
[1:52:06] for roach it was bunny events this one
[1:52:09] it was the address of grips yeah
[1:52:12] and as you can watch again the two lines
[1:52:17] we obvious by the time they were coming
[1:52:22] back ten we on one side which it will
[1:52:27] report so much you will report along the
[1:52:30] message to them but that's fine the
[1:52:34] shadow says it the reality was showing
[1:52:39] but no matter how bad it is there will
[1:52:43] be the two again who we say we are
[1:52:48] modern able not just that we can make it
[1:52:51] we are mortal
[1:52:54] they will never be negative they will
[1:52:58] remain positive the Giants don't matter
[1:53:02] Caleb such they're bred for us I wish I
[1:53:06] eat them
[1:53:07] [Applause]
[1:53:12] the challenges don't matter they are
[1:53:15] bred for us
[1:53:16] and we shall hit them this quiz will not
[1:53:19] matter it is bred for us because we know
[1:53:24] that ten elders are warming up in the
[1:53:27] Pentecostal age of the church to unleash
[1:53:30] terror to this bright economy but we are
[1:53:33] waiting for them they are bred for us
[1:53:36] and we shall each them for watch this
[1:53:42] watch this
[1:53:44] when they came back the gospel of we
[1:53:49] cannot make aids made more sense to
[1:53:54] majority
[1:53:58] much more than the minority think about
[1:54:03] that for a minute men die but the
[1:54:06] spirits that propel them don't stop this
[1:54:10] spirits issue with us today that is why
[1:54:14] you are seen so many fallen away after
[1:54:17] all Jesus and Daddy of the Lord shall
[1:54:19] not come true Peter on TV as they fall
[1:54:22] in a wave it runs through the time
[1:54:26] people will become something else even
[1:54:29] our Lord said except the Debbie
[1:54:31] shortened no flesh shall be saved but
[1:54:37] yes we have winding it down when they we
[1:54:41] are preaching the gospel the whole that
[1:54:45] people felt the new better said preach
[1:54:47] for the younger people I want to be a
[1:54:50] young fellow right now this is not our
[1:54:54] kind of gospel then when Joshua and
[1:54:57] Caleb took over as a man a brother you
[1:55:00] have only had one side please listen to
[1:55:03] the other side but you know how much and
[1:55:06] influence that gospel of we cannot make
[1:55:08] heart in the life of this people but
[1:55:11] Isaac it was so impacting it makes so
[1:55:15] much sense until these folks we are
[1:55:18] willing to travel back two years into
[1:55:22] Egypt and they started looking for
[1:55:24] instead of going two weeks
[1:55:27] forward into opinon
[1:55:30] you go look at the map brother Brown
[1:55:33] said it's five days from Kadesh into
[1:55:35] Canaan less football so - let's make it
[1:55:37] proposed to its maximum people we are
[1:55:41] willing to god two years backward
[1:55:44] instead of two weeks forward in the
[1:55:49] season of the harvest because the best
[1:55:53] range goes well think about you of life
[1:55:57] tonight said let us make captain who's
[1:56:02] gonna be our captain
[1:56:04] they started shopping for captain
[1:56:05] there's no misfortune verse 4 let us
[1:56:08] make up you see a lot of people have
[1:56:10] evil in their heart they are only
[1:56:12] looking for out for a model said let us
[1:56:15] make captain Bowie take us back to Egypt
[1:56:18] and just run collapse and Lord this can
[1:56:21] be you have only heard one side have you
[1:56:25] forgotten the power of God in Egypt have
[1:56:29] you forgotten the power of God in the
[1:56:30] Red Sea have you forgotten how we are
[1:56:33] hungry and he gave us a manner we are
[1:56:36] thirsty gave us water we have a lost one
[1:56:39] bathroom for my soul bless the Lord
[1:56:42] and forget not his benefit have you
[1:56:45] forgotten all those things never mix
[1:56:48] with faith India
[1:56:56] when just run killebrew's off to save
[1:56:59] the situation they were so influenced by
[1:57:01] the gospel of we cannot make it until
[1:57:04] they pick up stones and we're ready to
[1:57:06] kill Joshua killer and the glory of God
[1:57:09] is sending friends at that moment it was
[1:57:13] too late
[1:57:14] one of these days is gonna be too late
[1:57:17] brother Bram said the Spirit of the Lord
[1:57:19] will be withdrawn he that is only will
[1:57:22] be holy still
[1:57:23] he that his fealty will be filled this
[1:57:25] year he told us of a time that church
[1:57:27] will be here for a while even it's not
[1:57:30] to do what to be a testimony he said if
[1:57:34] bread Falls is a middle receive a
[1:57:36] testimony minister of testimony like
[1:57:39] love art like this one heart if so be
[1:57:43] there in each themselves at that time
[1:57:45] preacher won't save nobody the silent
[1:57:49] act was the final phase of the judgment
[1:57:52] of the people God shuts the AK but Ren
[1:57:56] did not fall immediately for the next 10
[1:57:59] to 40 days the ik was there bridging two
[1:58:03] souls that are eternally lost souls who
[1:58:07] are imprisoned think on your way when
[1:58:13] the glory of God descended God said
[1:58:15] everybody started trying to behavior
[1:58:18] said it's too late as you have spoken in
[1:58:21] my ears so will I do to you all of you
[1:58:25] from above 20 you said you cannot make
[1:58:27] it you will never make it because I'm
[1:58:30] the I priest of your confession
[1:58:34] the I press will not bring your
[1:58:37] sacrifice you will bring their sacrifice
[1:58:39] my brother it is whatever you bring that
[1:58:42] it will offer on your behalf so what do
[1:58:44] you bring tonight if you bring I can
[1:58:47] make it you we offer for you you can
[1:58:49] make it if you say I can I will I do
[1:58:52] believe that is what is going to declare
[1:58:54] your behalf is about how all those
[1:58:59] twenty below
[1:59:01] who says they will make it then we enter
[1:59:04] the land that you are despised and for
[1:59:08] God to achieve that
[1:59:09] that's journey from that moment became a
[1:59:12] wandering and brother Brahm told the
[1:59:17] people
[1:59:18] sorry God told Israel is that you people
[1:59:20] will know the breach of my promise the
[1:59:24] breach of his promise is not the
[1:59:26] breaking of his promise listen God
[1:59:30] cannot break his promise but the bridge
[1:59:33] means D taken away of the promise out of
[1:59:36] the reach of the unbelievers so that
[1:59:38] only the believer can enjoy so God
[1:59:42] created a bridge of time additional 38
[1:59:46] years forward for all the people who
[1:59:49] said they cannot make it to die
[1:59:52] read your Bible the Bible and the
[1:59:55] journey never resumed
[1:59:59] until all of them we have wiped out so
[2:00:02] much so that only those who say they can
[2:00:05] enter into the land of promise for 38
[2:00:10] years that we starts their journey from
[2:00:12] Trinidad going to Tobago after three
[2:00:15] hours that we find himself in Chicanos
[2:00:17] or Felicity they are catching nowhere
[2:00:20] until all those people died it was a
[2:00:24] breech of time this is the reason
[2:00:27] brother Brahm preached the message when
[2:00:30] it was taught in the seven seals the
[2:00:33] first Senate priests got eaten and
[2:00:35] revealed in then they followed it with
[2:00:38] the bridge between the seven Church
[2:00:42] edges and the opening of the seven seals
[2:00:45] in other words will run to the edges of
[2:00:49] the shock the climax of the seven church
[2:00:51] age of loved Asia was Pentecostal amen
[2:00:55] but Pentecostal refused to continue when
[2:01:00] the full word of God was brought into
[2:01:02] manifestation then we are like open like
[2:01:05] the ten elders they rejected and the
[2:01:09] moment when the consolidation rejected
[2:01:11] the food world it lost every article to
[2:01:15] provide Redemption this was why God
[2:01:19] cannot retain his seat in there it came
[2:01:22] to the gate of loud this year is that
[2:01:25] the old I stand at the door what he
[2:01:28] shall have been the landlord inside why
[2:01:30] was he standing outside because when it
[2:01:33] was fully presented it was pushed out
[2:01:36] the H before allowed this year Wesley an
[2:01:39] age was the age of open door and just
[2:01:42] one my age it became a closed door not
[2:01:45] to see not to unrighteousness but to the
[2:01:47] Lord Jesus Christ the closet door to
[2:01:51] life I'm loud SEF died this is why
[2:01:54] 95 brother brahmanas love this yeah dead
[2:01:57] in 1963 impact allowed this year in that
[2:02:01] instance before it declared them passed
[2:02:03] the redemption recognizing your beyond
[2:02:06] its message in 1965 it pronounced them
[2:02:09] dead forth for since 65 till now you
[2:02:12] have been seeing that form of law this
[2:02:14] year and that is why it's not getting
[2:02:16] better with the pentacle such things are
[2:02:19] roughly and what a loss to dedicate of
[2:02:22] that simply snow you are there to call
[2:02:25] you out where did you call you into we
[2:02:28] are still in the age of love this year
[2:02:30] but we are not governed by the condition
[2:02:32] of love this year this is our harvest
[2:02:35] but the branch said the which cannot
[2:02:37] match were inside the shock it's got to
[2:02:39] come out and this is why we came out
[2:02:42] into an economy within lousy C&H which
[2:02:46] the professions have caught for us the
[2:02:48] bright age and the pride edge give us a
[2:02:53] better thinking he gave us better songs
[2:02:56] he gave us better past practice to the
[2:03:00] word of the Lord and India we are laying
