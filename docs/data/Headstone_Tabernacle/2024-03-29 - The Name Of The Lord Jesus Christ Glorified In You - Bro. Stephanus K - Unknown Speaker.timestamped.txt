[1:06:24] house of the Lord
[1:06:26] tonight amen you may be seated for a few
[1:06:32] minutes amen it's Fallen my lot to greet
[1:06:36] the church tonight and to welcome us to
[1:06:38] this special weekend of services how
[1:06:41] many are happy to be in the house of the
[1:06:42] Lord
[1:06:44] tonight in such a time as this and you
[1:06:48] know the prophet taught us that the
[1:06:50] angel of the Lord is on the earth now
[1:06:52] setting things in order for the coming
[1:06:54] of the Lord he's moving there he's
[1:06:56] moving all over the world setting things
[1:06:58] in order and and there are many many
[1:07:01] meetings and conventions and services
[1:07:03] and you know just to thing that this
[1:07:05] weekend is the Easter weekend it's a is
[1:07:08] that pivotal distinction between Jesus's
[1:07:11] Ministry and every Prophet who came
[1:07:13] before because there were many who came
[1:07:15] before that had testimonies of Miracles
[1:07:17] and healings and you could look at the
[1:07:19] life of Elijah and the life of David and
[1:07:21] the life of Isaiah and you could go
[1:07:23] through all the scriptures but when
[1:07:25] Jesus came it was more than a miracle it
[1:07:27] was more than healing it was more than
[1:07:29] the sick being healed because he did
[1:07:32] something that nobody else ever did he
[1:07:34] laid his life down and he picked it back
[1:07:36] up again and because of that it is our
[1:07:39] anchor it is our holding ground is what
[1:07:41] keeps Us Alive because we were the ones
[1:07:44] who were supposed to die we were the
[1:07:45] ones who were supposed to pay the
[1:07:48] consequence of our actions of our
[1:07:50] decisions of our thoughts and Jesus came
[1:07:52] to die for our past our present and our
[1:07:54] future so that in him and by the blood
[1:07:57] that was shed we could have life and
[1:07:59] have it more abundantly and because of
[1:08:02] him not because of church but because of
[1:08:04] him not because of a group but because
[1:08:06] of him we could worship we could praise
[1:08:08] we could have access to Healing we can
[1:08:11] have access to
[1:08:14] Clarity not only on who he is but who we
[1:08:18] are in him because our identification is
[1:08:21] based upon him can the church say Amen
[1:08:24] so tonight
[1:08:26] we are under great expectation how many
[1:08:29] appreciate brother the stephanus colen
[1:08:31] Brena flew all the way to us from
[1:08:34] Germany and what a true servant of the
[1:08:37] Lord and I'm under great expectation for
[1:08:39] the Lord to use him as his microphone to
[1:08:42] speak to
[1:08:43] us and to write the prescription of what
[1:08:47] the doctor
[1:08:48] ordered that song We Sing The Great
[1:08:50] physician now is here God is the great
[1:08:53] doctor he's the great physician and he
[1:08:55] has a prescription that he could write
[1:08:57] for whatever need you came here with
[1:09:00] tonight if it's for one person tonight
[1:09:03] that needs a prescription from the Lord
[1:09:05] your coming is not in vain and I believe
[1:09:08] that the Lord through his servant
[1:09:10] brother stephanus will speak to our
[1:09:12] hearts whatever the Lord lays upon his
[1:09:15] heart I don't know what he's going to
[1:09:17] speak about but whatever the Lord lays
[1:09:19] on his heart he believes in that
[1:09:21] vertical relationship he's not speaking
[1:09:24] by a group or by what anybody else SS
[1:09:26] but whatever the Lord put in his heart
[1:09:28] he knows that he has the permission to
[1:09:30] speak whatever the Lord puts on his
[1:09:32] heart because we are one body and by one
[1:09:35] Spirit we are baptized into that one
[1:09:37] body where there's one Lord there's one
[1:09:40] Faith there's one baptism there's one
[1:09:42] Rapture there's one message and Plan of
[1:09:45] Redemption there's one road to adoption
[1:09:48] we are predestinated unto adoption and
[1:09:50] on that road to adoption and Perfection
[1:09:53] that grip of sin will be broken off for
[1:09:55] you that sickness has to be broken off
[1:09:58] of you that mind battle has to leave
[1:10:01] your mind Hallelujah the faith and and
[1:10:04] and and the courage that you're supposed
[1:10:06] to have as a Believer should be rising
[1:10:08] every service you might fall one day you
[1:10:11] might bngs down one day but something
[1:10:13] inside of you keeps pressing it way it
[1:10:16] way out as brother Bram said it's that
[1:10:18] Lily that's pressing its way out and
[1:10:21] that Lily is only doing what Jesus did
[1:10:23] because when he died you he couldn't
[1:10:25] stay dead he had to rise again and the
[1:10:28] seed in you can't stay dead it has to
[1:10:31] rise again can the church say
[1:10:34] Amen so I encourage you be on fire be in
[1:10:39] the spirit create the right atmosphere
[1:10:42] so as the word Goes Forth the minister
[1:10:44] won't even be able to minister this is
[1:10:46] your service this is your service forget
[1:10:49] Who's Next to You Forget who's behind
[1:10:51] you forget who's in front of you if you
[1:10:53] came looking for the Holy Ghost there's
[1:10:55] no doubt in my mind uh that you could
[1:10:57] receive the Holy Ghost tonight if you
[1:10:59] came looking for a breakthrough there's
[1:11:01] no doubt in my mind that you could
[1:11:03] receive the Breakthrough Young Brother
[1:11:05] young sister I challenge you if you
[1:11:08] don't know Jesus make it be tonight that
[1:11:11] you get a personal experience with the
[1:11:15] Lord
[1:11:17] friends as he gets ready to come forward
[1:11:20] don't let this be like any other service
[1:11:23] this is a crossroad there somebody here
[1:11:25] tonight at a crossroad a crossroad of
[1:11:28] life or
[1:11:31] death we are at a crossroad there's not
[1:11:33] much time left we at a crossroad and
[1:11:36] tonight is a night of decision a valley
[1:11:39] of decision a place of decision make
[1:11:41] your calling an election sure so may the
[1:11:44] Lord richly bless you tonight as God's
[1:11:46] servant makes his way forward let's sing
[1:11:48] that song only believe only believe it's
[1:11:52] the song that brother Bram said was his
[1:11:54] favorite song it's a song that meant so
[1:11:56] much to him

[1:14:40] the
[1:14:41] Lord and he has given us a
[1:14:44] prescription and we will use the
[1:14:47] prescription and all things will be made
[1:14:51] whole when Jesus
[1:14:53] comes all all things are made whole when
[1:14:58] he came to the lame one all things
[1:15:02] became whole when he was coming to the
[1:15:05] blind
[1:15:07] one the blindness had to
[1:15:09] leave when he was coming to the sick
[1:15:12] one the sick one had to leave the
[1:15:16] sickness had to go because Jesus was

[1:49:39] Friday he was the word and the Word was
[1:49:42] made
[1:49:44] flesh and in that body that was broken
[1:49:47] there was a stream of blood is that
[1:49:50] right and that blood was not human blood
[1:49:54] that blood was a created blood cell by
[1:49:57] God the Father it was spoken word
[1:50:00] creation that was a blood cell created
[1:50:03] by God it was not a human blood it was a

[2:28:55] come and brother BR says now this is
[2:28:57] only a dream and I walked over a sea and
[2:29:01] I seen brother Roy borders a very good
[2:29:02] friend of mine living in
[2:29:04] California looked like there's something
[2:29:07] wrong his eyes was half closed and great
[2:29:09] big and maybe cancer or something over
[2:29:11] his eyes and something was trying to
[2:29:14] pull me away from him and I scream B the
[2:29:18] B the borders in the name of the Lord
[2:29:21] Jesus snap out of
[2:29:24] that and he just could barely speak

[2:29:30] take something more than this I just
[2:29:33] can't grasp it brother brandham I just
[2:29:36] can grasp
[2:29:38] it so something was blocking our brother
[2:29:41] to to grasp
[2:29:43] something and brother BR says he had a
[2:29:46] dream he said oh brother BOS I love him
[2:29:48] and someone pulled me away and I looked
[2:29:51] and you can play perhaps the song
[2:29:55] there's power in the name of the Lord
[2:29:59] Jesus something pulled me away and a
[2:30:02] lady standing over there and it was a
[2:30:04] little boy and I used to haul and
[2:30:06] groceries from the grocery store to the

[2:30:30] this people too these are fine people
[2:30:33] but and I looked over there and I like a
[2:30:37] big Cellar or a big wall down beneath a
[2:30:42] great big
[2:30:44] cave and great iron bars 8 or 10 in
[2:30:48] thick and people out of their
[2:30:51] minds Twisted arms and legs and beating
[2:30:55] their head like that and she was crying
[2:30:58] and saying deliver the people brother
