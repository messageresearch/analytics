may you open up the windows of heaven and pour out your love and your mercy upon them we are needy people in Jesus name we ask it amen amen God bless you it's so good to be here in the field at fine spirit so we want to go straight into the word sometime I'd like to say some stuff and talk but other times just this is life that's how we just go straight to the word I have no small talk you a come here to hear from me they come here to hear from God okay Isaiah 58 1 verse verse2 Zechariah 41-6 and Luke 4 1-4 and 13- 14 we want to read these scriptures this morning Isaiah vers :12 and they that shall be of thee shall build the old wayte places Thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations Thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach the restorer of parts to dwell in Zechariah Chapter 4 reading verse one and the angel that talk with me came again and wed wake me as a man that is waken out of his sleep and said unto me what seest thou and I said I have looked and behold a Candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and there seven lamps there on and seven pipes to the seven lamps and which are upon the top there on and two all of trees by it one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side thereof so I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my Lord then the angel that talk with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be I said no my Lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord under zeruel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayth the Lord of hosts all last scripture is from Luke chapter 4 reading verse 1 to 4 and then read 13 and 14 and Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan and was led by the spirit Into the Wilderness being 40 days tempted of the devil and in those days he did eat nothing and when they were ended he afterward hunger the devil said unto him if thou be the Son of God command this stone that it be made bread and Jesus answered him saying it is written that man shall live bread alone but by every word of God for time I'll just go down to 13 and 14 but we know the other scripture in between we strike it verse 13 and when the devil had ended all the Temptation he departed from him for a season and Jesus returned in the power of the spirit unto Galilee and there went out a Fame of him throughout all the region round about let's pray father we thank you for your word we thank you for your people here and every need here may be met every sick person here may they be healed any bound person here may they be set free every sinner here may they be saved and any backsliders here may they be restored in Jesus name I ask it amen you may be seated oh praise God praise God Oh Glory to God this is the place to shout we do go Carnival and B and fet and thing this the place we just shout and jump and praise and worship god oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God so after Jesus answered the devil it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God praise God so Jesus overcome the Devil by the word so if you're don't know the word how you overcome if you're not interested in the word how you overcome if you're not conscious of what the word is how you going to overcome you have to get the word to deal with the Devil by the word because Jesus did not overcome the Devil by anything else but the word he said it is written it is written it is written so the devil didn't know who he was because he was telling the devil go read it oh praise the name of the god go and see for yourself so when the devil realized Jesus was getting on in the word the devil take him to a high mountain this is verse 5 showed him all the Kingdom of the world in a moment of time so you can see the devil have a real nice curved big screen all them big big screen TV screen a nice Curve screen to show him in a moment of time he said all these kingdoms of the all the kingdoms of the world and the devil said unto him all this power will I give thee and the glory of them for that is delivered unto me to whomsoever I will give it if thou Willl worship me and all shall be dine in other words he's telling Jesus don't go to Calvary you don't have to die you don't have to pay a price I going be the director and you will be the manager praise God had to go to no trial no testing and then all his Minds right and Jesus answer said unto him get thee behind me Satan for it is written thou shall Worship the Lord thy God and him only shall thou serve so he straighten out the devil and tell the devil where to get off there right it is written so watch this now and he brought him to the Jerusalem set him on the Pinnacle of the temple and said unto him if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down from Den for it is written devil start to quot now he a foolish you know not no stupid devil you know he's to read the word you know so he want to get Jesus now to be popular to play himself to parade his beef and Jesus was in none of that are you getting me now for it is written he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up least at any time that Dash thy foot against a stone word by word the devil quoting word by word he is quoting to Jesus and Jesus said praise God and it is said Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God oh glory to God and when he ended all the Temptations He departed for a season and Jesus returned in the power of the spirit so here it is Jesus he just got filled with the Holy Ghost John the Baptist baptize him he got filled with the Holy Ghost and this Holy Ghost he got filled with led him into the Wilderness the spirit is on him isn't that right and when the spirit when he hit the Wilderness here the spirit turned to word it is written it is written it is written it is written he's traveling it is written the spirit it is written and when he come out in out of the Wilderness the Spirit come back upon him and return in the power of the spirit praise God to go and face them Pharisees and scribes and Sadducees Oh Glory to God and then the spirit

Prophecy you have to hear that you must hear that you're member of this church you need to listen to that message I'm going to start here for this message this morning we leave off from Wednesday night you said here now in the beginning was the word in John one the word was with God and the Word was God and the word became flesh and dwell Among Us now before a word it's a thought a thought has to be created so God thoughts became become creation when it's spoke by a word that is when he presents it to you as a thought his thoughts it's revealed to you then it's still a thought until you speak it you have to speak it so when Isaiah heard God thoughts of virgin shall conceive if he had let the torch hang in his head he was going to pause and say but that can't happen you know I mean logic doesn't allow that to happen a virgin can conceive but the thought came from God into his heart is still a thought until he speaks it so he spoke it a virgin shall conceive and be a son then shall be called wonderful counselor because Jesus had to come outside of this sex thing outside of this Fallen thing that's why a virgin had to conceive Jesus God had to create egg and sperm to make Jesus what he was he was God he was the word made flesh because he had to come outside of this perverted blood that we have right now he was the blood of God oh that's why this from his blood come his Spirit life could come back upon us oh give the Lord some Praises Oh Glory we we couldn't take the life on of another human being we had to get a different human being all together which is Christ Jesus so he came in the blood of God if Satan only knew what blood he had he never let him die a Calvary Let Jesus died of old age but when he died and the blood was shed his Spirit was released and that's why we here this morning because his Spirit has be released Oh Glory to God to pull us to him you be seated remember this you couldn't come if your trying know he said no man could come except the father draw him so you can't come on your own the spirit itself have to come upon you to give you a desire oh give the Lord some Praises some people don't have the desire but you have the desire God put that desire in you that was desire when you was smoking when you was drinking when you was partying that desire God put that inside of there when you was carrying with foolishness he put in Desa knowing one day you going to connect to a reality one day you will connect to your theophany one day you will connect to your word body when they connect to the word coming word by word by word by word oh give the Lord some Praises Glory one day you connect to this end time message we have a message a end time message message message for the end time so watch so we must speak first by Revelation all the promise revealed by the son of man through the prophet of Malachi 4 every word in the Bible is God thoughts laying in seed form and when Jesus the first Parable Jesus give was what the SE and the seed some fell among Sony ground rocks and everything else and then he say if you don't if you don't understand this Parable you understand no Parables because it's the key is that right the key is the seed now if you notice in the beginning God said let there be let there be let there be he cannot do anything except speak to create sir so God's that's why he said my word shall not return to me void his word must be expressed that's why he could say we were with him before the foundation of the world because the world came in the beginning but before the beginning Oh Glory in the beginning was the word but before the beginning was thoughts you were the thoughts he had ah come on on now come on now you were the thoughts that he had before the beginning and he expressed you in the word the logos so you were like a seed in Christ and God sent it to your natural mother and father but and you had a germ a gene a seed that only the word could bring to [Applause] life so whose child are you now not your mother and father you know that just gave physical attributes but whose child are you now Oh Glory to God then you become a son and daughter of a living God by birth and only the seeds could be reborn so you have to have a seed in you to even be reborn oh give the Lord some Praises he that asking about your flesh and who how much man you with and how much sin you did he's not talking about that he want to know what is in seed in you oh give the Lord some PR Glory the horrors for Jesus you may be seated was never the sin you know was not wanting to get out it was never the S you know the woman caught an adultery Facebook so she and everybody talking about her he said woman we are th accusers all them make excuses tell them which one of you without sin P the first stone and all them Trin start to walk away Hallelujah all them self-righteous message people start to walk away he said where where th accusers he said neither do I condemn thee go and sin no more his issue was what was on the inside because he was addressing what was on their inside if you're inside clean Stoner you're hypocrite you're hypocrite oh give the Lord some Praises that is what he was calling Hypocrites I have a bunch of Hypocrites in this in this message Hallelujah looking down on this one and looking down on that one who are you to look down on anyone when God look down on you and see in your sin and pull you out who are you to look down and condemn this one and write off this one and C his one shame on [Applause] you but she shall be called the repairer of the breach the restorer of paths to dwell in God want to repair and brother Isaac teaching in the wall Jeremiah uh Nehemiah building back the wall you may be seated and afterwards had to build back the wall and people didn't believe they was going to get back that wall because when they when you get a city or you take land in those days the first thing you do is put a high tower and put a Watchman to watch the tower and man laying bricks and her sword man mixing bricks and her sword yeah laying bricks and here talking chatting like nothing going on have enemies they will take you out they will stop the walls and when you have the walls all around then you can build houses but you have to pull offense offense a defense a wall and when enemy coming they come with Bild I they call them them big um battering ram big big tree big thing swinging so and they coming to see if they could bust a hole in the wall and when they bust a hole they their army could come in and raid your territory and they bust a hole they Break Down The Walls and going to build back the wall Oh Glory and God talk and prophesy there'll be those called the repairs of the breach there have been a breach of L kindness they a breach of bitterness and all kind of they bust on the walls but but a joy we come back to the repairer of the breach Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God who's going to be in that spot who's going to be in that Gap there's a gap to be filled the devil has busted all kind of walls but there's going to be a repairer there's going to be a restorer there's going to be an anointing coming to restore and to repair and to bring back that which was [Applause] lost [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Malachi 4 William brandham had to anoint every bride promised seed from Genesis to Revelation and presented to the bride oh okay so I you have 14 pages related this morning are still at page one but we just on page one now watch here this in the beginning was the word that as far as we could go by theology now he said first he thought he spoke the word and the Word was made manifest how infallible God is this the word made flesh in the report and Jesus no wonder when he come up the hill there was no food on the tree he said no man eat from thee and he walk away the next day coming back the tree had withered God's mind was a thought before it was a word that expressed Jesus Christ the same one was expressing that word back again and every word there a quote now in the Bible is God's thought laid in seed form and if receive into the human being and spoke by the same thought that materialized the Bible it brings the things to pass see what I mean how powerful could be could the church be listen say it again all of God thoughts in the Bible is God's word in seed form if received in the human being and spoke by the same thought that materialize the Bible remember Moses didn't have the blood of Jesus know Moses was under the Bloods of bulls and goats and he spoke for flies you are more anointing on on you than Moses you know in that sense you because you are the under the blood of Jesus you know the blood of Jesus takes away your sin as if you never did it you know Moses was being covered by Bloods of B by the blood of bulls and goats and yet he spoke for flies under the anointing Samson take a little old Ox gold um bone and beat down a thousand Philistines with steel helmet yes because he knew he was called for a purpose and the devil can't defeat him and the Philistines can't defeat him nothing could defeat him and even though he have a old bone it could be anointed and God could use anything oh give God could use you a old bone oh give the Lord some Praises Oh Glory to God hallelujah don't tell me [Applause] you now listen hold the Propet getting deeper here now the Bible said see okay let this mind that was in Christ be in you now as a man thinking in his heart so is he or so he is so if you think he will fail you can't pass him like a man speak for the mountain and said just as I thought it's still there he speak for it to move but he he believe in his heart sometime we speak things but we don't believe it in our heart we speak it because it's a head thing know it's right but it's not from the heart so you see you could tell somebody forgive but not from the heart you speak it because you know supposed to say I forgive you you know and you can say well I accept it and you didn't accept it from your heart you accept it Go and tell Tom Dick and Harry everybody about it see it has to come to a h thing how many you understand that now not so much you go to church some people are Christians some people go to church not the same thing everybody go to church with Christians the people who destination is church to church morning I want to stay home with them Devils outside you have atere inside you don't want that and that's when Jacob hold the angel he oh God next person tou the angel they G you but then they be the same way they C the neighbor they carrying on they fighting the bitterness and what Jacob Jacob I will not let you go to the how much people have a revelation or experience of touching the angel Jacob not even touching he hold to the angel and said to wrestle with the angel talk to the angel he said where you going he said I had to go now all night you wrestling you know where say wrestle you ever see two people wrestle big men wrestle he on the ground roll on the floor lock neck lock hand lock foot on everything else you know he said to lock the angel foot he grab his hand to get away lock you were serious you said where you going you want to go to next Dimension and I leave me here and like this I frighten for my brother you know afraid my brother you know then when he recognize he overcome he get touched right and when he touched now he start to walk the instead of walking like a soul man the pants falling the bottom or anything like that he walking with a limp he can't run from your brother now you walk with a limp he walking slow you know so you walking so you can't tell people believe him where's your name Jacob no my name is Israel looking for Jacob you say he a dead used to be Jacob well Jacob did e a B CDE e wrong man you seen Israel now I used to be that I used to have that name I used to have that life I used to I used to I used to but God gave me a new oh God help me glory to God give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah now watch God changed the name from Jacob to Israel a man overcome a scog man a Scamp as we would call him a trickster and God said Jacob I love you so I hate God love that trickster because you know the trickster going be changed so you can say oh God I have a picture of him you're stricking and you have a and a video tape and you tape him and what not that is irrelevant bond that bond that get rid of that when God change a man he change a man and Jacob turn to Israel and Israel had 12 sons and that's how you get 12 tribes Israel is not one people oh give the Lord some Praises what you're calling Israel is the children of Israel make up Israel that's why when they start to seal it's so much of the 144,000 of Benjamin and of Asha and of this and of that and of that I heard the number of them that were sealed is only those that going to be sealed it's not them Rascals now down there oh give the Lord sh praises and God of a bunch of people the Bride of Jesus Christ that's going to be sealed and no to take that off of you when God put his mark on [Applause] you my let be seated okay if that same spirit that said let it be light and there was like let there be trees and there was trees if that same mind in Christ be you how much more you could say let there be no cancer let the blind eyes be open and it'll be so but wait a minute he say have faith in God for ver I said unto you if you shall say to this mountain be moved and be plucked and cast in the sea don't doubt in your heart but believe what you say will come to pass you can have whatever thou sayest you shall have it not me you shall have it what power has been given to the church now you can express it by a mental conception but if it becomes real a real revelation of God you see it before it happen and express it in word form that's what a real Revelation does a real Revelation Mak you see it before it happens and then express it so when God called Abraham an old man his wife is old 60 6575 she's past child bearing age and God revealed to Abraham not to Sarah to Abraham you have a son because it was revealed to him because as real to him he could express we going to have a son now she could question and query because she didn't get the Revelation but he had it and because he had it he could express it he could go to the doctor and say check me up the duck doctor say you're still old your wife's still old you still have a son after 15 years give me a check up dock doctor stop wasting at time I'm not even taking your money go back home but that to do with Abraham Abraham still checking cuz you're working the faith now then Abram has somebody making booties and making crib and he he nuts now he gone he gone he going clear after 25 years don't come an angel don't come a man walking to Abraham and tell him I will return unto thee according to the time of life in other words Sarah will go into a monthly cycle again next 28 days I'm going to return un the according to the time of life and Sarah going to have a son what happened what happened is not a man coming next 28 days woo a spirit coming next 28 days Oh Glory to God so Abraham was transformed in his body by Spirit Sarah was transformed in her body by Spirit when Abraham looked in the mirror who's that young man standing there oh glory to God Sarah Sarah was so beautiful that some old Pharaoh General wanted to take out of wife oh give the Lord some Praises was no old woman you know he fancy Sarah and God shut up every woman in the house and said restore unto my Prophet his wife he said but he man tell me the sister he said I know that but I tell you that let him pray for you oh give the the Lord some Praises don't mess with my servants don't mess with my sons oh give the Lord some Praises oh Hallelujah spirit so after Elohim visits to give a reminder or an assurance or a consolation that is not too far off Spirit have to come now to make that amen that that breakthrough so watch something me you can express it by a mental conception but if it's become real revelation of God you see it before it happened and express it in word form so when you express it in word form what that gives you the testimony of Jesus which is the spirit of Prophecy because it's a revelation that's been bued into you so even though your husband don't understand it like the woman in blood issue her husband tell her leave that small Church alone what she going to that church for now she pay she doctor doctor say come next time come and he come and he like that because he get money every time he go but he not helping her her money ran out and her husband was no encouragement so she told herself sometimes when you see people there telling you the right thing you to talk to yourself you know sometimes they're jealous they're lying they don't want you to prosper they don't want to break you they don't want you to be he they don't want the best for you and she told herself if I could just touch the H of his G I been made whole and when she come out brother Lyndon is because there people crowd Around Jesus so she had to push scroll through the leg big hardback men tall men fat men strong men and she say excuse me and you know what I mean we dramatize it me throw a hand back there and say hand back there you know I mean all she want to do is get to Jesus hallelujah oh glory to God and she don't want to touch him Is His Garment you want to touch that's the Garment so she had Faith to pull virtue through him let through the Garment and receive it when she touched the Garment oh God she was healed right away Jesus said who touched my clothes somebody touched me he said everybody touching he said no no no no no something different something different he saw the woman he said thy faith he didn't say his power he said thy faith had made the whole not his power thy faith you have to have faith to draw the power oh give the Lord some Praises do you see why God sent a prophet to turn our hands back to the faith of the fathers because the faith going to draw the power you can't leave you the same way you came you have to leave you today different Oh Glory to God say Amen [Applause] somebody all right watch this now you see it before it happen and express it in word form and that word takes a whole and becomes material a thought expressed now watch if your heart and your mind is so infilled with God's spirit until your thoughts become his thoughts there you are when your mind you're leading you're guiding becomes a direct place or a direct inspiration of the holy spirit that moving in your mortal being what kind of people should we be if the very Holy Spirit has you so embol bodied or empowered that you don't use your thoughts you don't use your mind you don't use your own opinion but the Holy Spirit had you so built until your thoughts and your being is God Spirit expressing itself through you what kind of church would we be what kind of people would it be this morning if this brandom Tabernacle this morning was so filled with the presence of God why you didn't even use your own mind didn't even use your own thoughts didn't have no alternative of your own just to be led by the spirit and they that are sons of God are led by the spirit hear this part now when the human element goes out and the spirit of God fills that vacancy remember we talked sometime ago about the woman who was fooling around still in church and playing piano and whatnot and then she was in a dead bed preacher come to tell her well you know you're right with God and she said I a send for you picture come here go your way and whatnot when she begin to die her spirit start a breakup and the first thing is is the mind so that human spirit all the GC CXC doctor degree all your money car and where feeling who you think you are that's how to break up and her soul start to come up now then she start to SC I'm lost I'm lost you see all that assurance and all that thinking you're okay is at the head level but at death and dying that breaks up so you better be sure it's at the Heart level because that is where the soul is at oh give the Lord some Praises so he's talking about you now when the human element goes out and the spirit of God fills that vacancy when you empty yourself then will be when the church in its power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus you he about Kangle when when when when you empty yourself out when the spirit of God fills its vacancy watch and you will walk in his steps talking about Jesus in his power in his thoughts in his being you see what I mean then your thoughts will become words and your words will become material let's take it to Peter now he's a fisherman Jesus tell him come following Jesus he a cuss fisherman does cuss and smoke and drink and thing so Peter is a normal human being Jesus give him an anointing to work with him for the ministry he's not yet converted isn't that right so crucifixion day now uh crucifixion day get some Any Time Peter deny Christ three times Co Crow Peter cry and everything else he tell Peter wait in the upper room until I get power from on high not books and tapes not reading Old Testament scripture he couldn't read and write power from on high when that power hit Peter so Peter Ste on and said these people are not drunk as you suppose because they were like drunk men in early in the morning how you drinking so early morning he said no not that kind of drinking he said this is that that the prophet V okay no problem Peter going out to the temple as usual is a big dear man Peter put his hand in his pocket and he recognized he have no money his first poor Apostle a man couldn't get a bottle of water he couldn't buy a bottle of water for any man he had no money whatsoever so then Peter said listen to what he said remember what we just read you're thinking you're leading he says silver and gold I don't have but what I have I give unto you no watch he didn't praying for know he said I give unto you what I have I have it and if I have it I can give it well the same thing with you god want to give you that you could give it so Peter said rise up and walk and he held a man in the name of Jesus Christ and the Man start to jump and shout and carry on that is what shook Jerusalem that is what rocked them not saying this is that the scripture and Joel no no no no no it's when the lame man walk because everybody knew he was that lay man in front of the temple everybody was giving him coins oh give the Lord a shout in the house but when they saw that man walk they know another powers in the land and Jesus was not there oh give the Lord a praise Oh Glory the god the Messiah was not around but this were Messiah this were little Messiah little ones on the earth God want to make you that God want to make you a witness God want to make you a messiah a small one a small version and then hear the prophecy now I believe it's on this road when the church will be so wrapped in Christ the Holy Spirit mankind so away from themselves they don't see themselves they don't have they don't have no thoughts but to serve God their thoughts move on they refuse to things of the world they just move in the spirit live in the spirit walk in the spirit to fulfill the law of Christ then the love of Christ in the human heart moving in the Holy Ghost oh I love that because you can have faith without love but this bright faith is Faith at work by love so love have to come oh glory to God in the human heart moving in the Holy Ghost this is divine love now oh glory to God hallelujah there's a love that conquered the bull conquered the Beast conquer anything this is the love that cannot fail oh brotherly kindness will fail but charity never fail it give the Lord some Praises this love coming upon your heart Oh Glory to God this Capstone anointing hey Hallelujah coming upon you giving the power to love your enemies Oh Glory to God hallelujah watch watch then the love of Christ in the human heart moving in the Holy Ghost that great wonderful church will go forth with power and deity because deity will be revealed in human beings by the Holy Spirit bringing to pass the thought of their mind that's how you know it's going to be God oh glory to God when Moses met God the pillar of fire he said who shall I say send them send me he said because you know you have a Harden people tough people down there you know you can't go and say God s me Israel not taking that you Israel different you know who shall I say tell them I am I am I am tell them I am the I am not I was or I will be I am present tense you just have to add what you want I am to be I am your healer I am your deliverer I your whatever you want I am to be I am that I am tell them tell them I am Hallelujah Lord what What You Do by this sign you're going to do this you're going to do that so so watch deity will be revealed on human beings how by a nice message a nice sermon plenty Mysteries that was Mysteries today boy some people believe like Mysteries not on Mysteries and the

made manifest how God watch how God wants his church is to manifest himself God wants his church to manifest himself how can he manifest himself unless his own seed is in that person that's right now remember what happened in Pentecostal right holy ghost fell on them gifted men some of them were one on one woman men because the rain of Fallen the just and unjust they didn't have the seed so God was using men without seed the seed come from God the word and the word comes to the prophet so God a prophet with the seed son of man reveal to L something toty to reveal seed that when you get the seed in you the secret becomes the word is in the bride so God not using you so much but they were using a word in you that's right so that word Can't Fail then you can't fail go give the Lord some Praises so we cannot go back to Pentecost with the anointing or talk in tongues and then cuss your neighbor same tongue that speaking in tongue same tongue cussing that's Pentecost dress how you want to dress act how you want to dress and that's fine and that's fine that's Pentecost there is no difference from them and the world no separation Hallelujah people don't want separation but God loves it that's why he giv Samson seven lucks Hallelujah as a covenant representing not 24 Lu not 72 Lu big noter thing no seven Lu seven because represented seven Church ages it represented the rainbow it represented the Seven Virtues it represented the seven Thunders and when Samson lost his eyes because he didn't see the demon upon Dela he only see nice girl nice woman nice shape nice complexion nice everything only see his nice he didn't see that black demon power upon that woman take him of his off his anointing and to send him off track Hallelujah after they take off his locks and he lost his strength and he grind at the Mill he had enough time to consider his ways the worst thing they could have done was to bring him for entertainment hallelujah praise God he said bring him out bring him out long time serving Once Upon a Time serving God Once Upon a Time in the spirit Once Upon a Time only once upon a time and Samson tell that fell who leading him lead me to the Post he was blind he

God God sent Sams for an inside job when they thought he was outside God put the man on the inside he used Thea Oh Glory to God you didn't hear what I said he used theila to put Samson on the inside oh God have mercy and God put us in Trinidad God put it in this world God put you as the Inside Man Oh Glory to God that devil power is coming down Babylon is Fallen Babylon is Fallen Babylon is

Go Hallelujah who who's speaking that Moses speaking the thoughts of God Moses speaking on behalf of God Aaron becomes his Prophet Moses become God he said let my people go not let let oh God you know some people has beg the devil oh God Satan you do that I know Brothers like that you Mo that talking to you talking wrong talk wrong language that what say cast not negotiate you want coffee war or

now come back tomorrow when Mo had the pepper flies and fugs and fleas and whatnot when he finished take take your flies take take your flocks take your people take your p and go take them and go and the prophet said a man could live such a life that the devil don't know what to do with him oh God help me to be that kind of a man devil don't know what to do with you he frustrated when you think you're supposed to be depressed you're praising God you take you get two flat tire you still worship you lost your job you worship you get increase in pay you worship it doesn't matter this go bad this go bad you still worship the devil know whether you're up or down he don't know what's going on with you because you have a heart giving God to praise oh when you expect it to be depressed and frustrated you're still praising God he said no I can't handle this I handle this I know our brother always low L low I going I go in line with him this evening oh give the Lord some Praises you better be not laer know you better be on fire for God oh let the devil back off on you and leave you for a season glory to God oh glory to God let me see a trying my Lord on page four so the Bible is manifested again like in the early days of Christ cause and there's a quote we emphasize sometime in the past you are a predestinated seed just like Christ was and when the rain falls on the seed the life produces itself when the Holy Spirit Falls so don't be frustrated because you're still waiting for this rain he's talking about here this is what he promised you use what you have in the measure that God give it to you while you're expecting this rain because Abraham had Faith to believe God and walk a faithful life until he got the confirmation so right now you walk a walk of Faith because you know God going to confirm your faith by the Holy Ghost upon your life now you know need this Holy Ghost more than you think because you have to apply it to your family and to your children they can't apply it you have to apply it for them you have to believe for them oh give the Lord a shout in the house so if you think you have no work to do your walk about to get started Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God who going to apply for your children you're 6y old 5y old 10y old who going to apply for them you have to you have to stand in the Gap glory to God when when that that angel was passing and you're hearing screams of death down the street and coming Closer Closer Closer I can hear a six-year-old a seveny old asking Daddy Daddy are you sure that that that angel not going to catch us in this house he said son I am sure because the blood is on the doorpost the blood is on the lintel and Moses said when I see the blood I'm going to pass over you and I know that God going to see that blood because that blood the token was on display oh God somebody had to put it up there oh give the Lord a shout in the house come on you sons of God come on you fathers somebody got to put it up there glory to God I expect the woman to come there and put blood and whatnot is the man had to do that and the man is under attack that's why pornography is to attack the man Hallelujah everything is to attack the man the throw down God's man Hallelujah and you have to fight right back filth is to take throw down the man that's why the family has been wrecked man being stripp of the manhood in this present society and we have to fight that back because God said I find a man I found a man a better man oh glory to God God always looking for a better man you don't just want to be a man you want to be a better man better husband a better father a better grandmother a better grandfather you could be better oh give the Lord a shout glory to God [Applause] Amen sh told my daughter-in-law yesterday I said when somebody doesn't add to their knowledge all they are using is what they already know and what you already know is limited if you are not prepared to read to listen to study to apply to your life you're only using your human element that you had 20 years ago nothing added to you waste of time stunted hallelujah praise God worse than bokon stunted sometime you no short when you pick you pick a a hub a I know talk from experience I a plant corn and peas love to plant corn love to see it grow love to reap too boil corn roast corn get the silk on top there and thing like that there it's a nice thing you know I to be Ming the cor too you just leave the corn just get SP fall so when they cor reach a certain stage you can't Mo it too early and kill it when a certain stage you mold it and that give a anchor and it cor get stronger it's settled there not gr and the corn life is the life of the church ages as you seed in the ground there and it unfold unfold unfold until it come back to the upop we get whole air corn we represent that air that God looking for to come back Alpha and Omega the same seed that was in the beginning will be the seed of the ending in between it processes so the was processes for God to come this is the people with the George that God was looking for oh give the Lord a shout Luther Wesley Pentecost was processes to get to this point now we talking about Oneness with God now we talking about the same seed that was in Jesus the Same Spirit coming upon you to water the seed inside of you oh give the Lord a shout Oh Glory to God oh Hallelujah my God I don't know how I'm going hear listen Elohim hallu suffering from loneliness hlj and I say it this way how to say it because these attributes was in him to be a father with no children to be a savior nobody lost it was a certain way in that being called Elohim that was before the beginning that was before the word so he wanted to be God and he created angels angels worship him God is the object of worship that made him God he wanted to be a father he wanted to be a Creator he created the Earth he said there was no man to till the saw you create man put man there in his own image and likeness because he created beasts and bears and dinosaurs and everything else but there was no man to represent God so he made a spirit man Adam was a spirit man in Genesis 1 then he make a dust man out of the earth and put that Spirit man in the dust man and Man became a living Soul Eve was locked up in that man because Eve was part of Adam in spirit form but is was in one body called Adam Oh Glory to God and Adam was learning the word and learning to work work and word not woman yet work and word and then after Adam was working after Adam had the word he put Adam to sleep he said not good for man to dwell alone he pull out Eve a wife she was a byproduct of the original Adam was original Oh Glory to God I heard a preacher say something it blow my mind when eve eat that tree nothing happen when she give her husband everything fell down oh give the Lord some Praises watch it watch it watch it watch what you eat oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah because God told Adam the day you eat of that day you shall surely die go there talk to Eve go talk to Adam don't eat it don't touch that tree but he love his wife he went with his wife he got kicked out the Garden of Eden and that's where we are now God is say I will restore I will bring it right back I will bring back Sons back to the Garden of Eden I will bring back Adam Fallen race and we are here on the road to Restoration Oh Glory to God God sent a prophet to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers Oh Glory to God we on our way we on our way oh glory to God restoration is already on Oh Glory Hallelujah my Lord my Lord my Lord so when the Holy Spirit Falls when the rain falls on the seed praise God it produces itself when the Holy Spirit Falls so we can't manufacture adoption manufacture fivefold manufacture this and manufacture this and no re it fall makes no sense men want to claim all kind of thing set of liars claiming all kind of thing have all kind of signs and thing like that and they came in that sign we got this rainbow and that light and that this and this see a picture man see a horse all kind of thing and that's supposed to mean what I don't care I see a horse light Cloud nothing Hallelujah until this thing change here I care watch you up go is not posting for Instagram you want pict I have a light I pop a picture like what I supposed to mean I don't know I don't know interpret that that when we see the Life of Christ lived out that's a different thing when you see you encounter your enemies and you could treat them as if they're a friend you know Jesus them disciples didn't know Judas was the devil when Jesus tell them go and what th do is do quickly they thought he went to get some meal or get juice or going to buy some sweet drink or some big Rad or something hallu and you say brother brand live in such a way he couldn't separate his friends from his enemies I want that because you see at the subconscious level if you don't have it right when the enemy come eyebrow twist your mouth shift and because God bless that's a performance that's a God blessed performance but that's not the real thing that husband calling and like that and knock door Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah God bless he just calling right see but it have to be the writing constantly you choose right right is not easy but you choose it there's no right way to do the wrong thing let me say it again there's no right way to do the wrong thing stick with what is right now okay now so when they were in the upper room they haul themselves up familiar quot in the upper room these seeds to word and the wood was laying there without life in it all of sudden all of a all of a sudden there came a song from Heaven Hallelujah as the ministers from forign came down no no no no no from as the waters begin to gush down and it actually fill all the house where they were sitting and the seeds begin to grow it begin to manifest itself the word of God manifested the word was in them the dry and whatnot but holy ghost come transform them all right now watch we live through Luther's age Wesley age Pentecostal age and watch and each age is given a promise of the word and the people of that age that manifest that promised word is the seed of that age according to what Jesus said here they are the children of the Kingdom that's right the manifestation of the Holy Spirit operating to his children is those seed of the kingdom of that age oh praise God Amen so you have to become that the Holy Ghost operating through you we keep your long in all right all right let's go so I got this to repair of the breach a phrase Isaiah 5812 it shall be the build the old way spaces thou shal raise up foundations of many generations thou shal be called the repairer of the breach the restorer of past dwelling and this is something I search out here the phrase refers to a role of characteristic of a person who is dedicated to mending or restoring what is broken or damaged whether it is physical emotional spiritual it implies someone who works to reconcile divisions heal relationships and bring about rest Restorations and unity praise God you shall be called the repairer of the breach ancient walls were made of stone or brick reinforced with towers and Gates and M and ditches they were often attack and Siege by Siege Batten Rams and catapults to defend these The Defenders would use counterweight machines and so like that and that wall was fortified in case of war the enemy Bes the city made efforts to breach the wall with a Batton Ram the goal was to force a breach wiing up for the troops to enter into the city oh praise God here we go hallelujah hallelujah so that's the devil job now to see where you're strong not where you're weak to see where you're weak rather and see where he could break you down more so if you have a chance to attack he will attack and break your walls to see if you could get inside all right so here Jesus brought God to human lives God has made human when Jesus was born he became man isn't that right now you are not converted until you receed the Holy Ghost Bible said so after Peter had both been saved sa and Sanctified given power to cast out on spirits and to preach the gospel Jesus plainly told him he was not converted until he receiv received the Holy Ghost now the Holy Spirit we're going running quickly now will not misbehave itself in one person and behave itself in another it makes each person come into into its character because it's the spirit that leads you so somebody have Holy Ghost and among of foolishness and another person behav in the it's not the same is that right all right so when God plac men here in the days of Jesus he give men a true road map to power you ready a road tells you which way you're headed he said I've crossed the country so much my old wife if I was amazed to think of it in the last few years I could mention where you want to go I could tell you any road that leads to it within 15 minutes of time you'll arrive isn't that right that's what he said it and that's the way God want us to know his word where every pothole is once you keep driving a place after Poole you see them Maxis that why some they driving the best thing going a new place follow somebody who who know the road when they swing so swing so too cuz they know it's a PO day you don't know the road that's right they know the road that's right he said that's the way God wants us to know his word we travel it we know it we have tested it we have tried it we know it leads to here we go the Bible is the road map that leads to the power of God what's what is it the Bible Faith leads you to the power so this turn he has back fast to do what to say we have a message and we are we talking Ministries Faith leads you to the power power produces the promise we need promise oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah glory to God hallelujah praise God all right so I can't stop right mid right now pull back so so fasten your seat belts fasten your seat belt right all right okay so Abraham was called out God called him prove that he was with him and something like that right now you're going to see when you are called out when you are called out right with me I'm doing a little teaching this morning when you are called out first you go to a trial to see if you are really going to go on Don't Say Amen still the would I ain't begging for no amen mean you say when you called out yeah going yet you know just called out God does give you a trial to see if you will go on or you take the offer and go back do like offer and go back all right so when God give you the Holy Ghost which is a sign he accepted your faith that you profess in him you follow me now now watch Hebrews 126 and 8 for whom the Lord love it he chasen it and Scorch it two say all right two say Amen let me read it again let me see if anybody is sleeping in the house don't touch that dial don't change his station just stay right where we are for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scor every son who he receive it if you Endor chasing and we say if you endure chastening God deal with you as Sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if he without chastisement of all of we are partakers then you are bastards and n Sons Hallelujah so every son shout out every son must be tested and tried it just must it have no excuse so get ready so Jesus as soon as he received the fullness of the spirit he immediately went to the minister Association I start to give a testimony we oh we no no we immediately he was led by the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tested on the lust of the eyes the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life which is all that is in the world oh give the Lord a praise offering he was tested without a another Minister without Elders without deacons without any assistance whatever he CAU in other words he was tested with the devil face to face and he overcome him he overcame him oh give the some Praises it is written it is written it is written and when we are prophesying by the testimony of Jesus we are really saying it is written it is written Oh Glory to God you prophesy your adoption you prophesy your healing you prophesy your restoration you prophesying your Revival you're prophesying your son going to come back your daughter going to be delivered go give the Lord some Praises you going to get free you're going to break out you're going to bust out glory glory to God hallelujah praise God praise God praise God there we go you go through a testing time the church goes through a testing time each individual goes through a testing time before it can ever possess the Gate of the enemy Abraham went through it Christ went through it after Christ was filled with the Holy Spirit on the River Jordan he went through a testing time after Abram was called out put into the land to be a pilgrim and circumcision God met him time after time yet he had to go through testing and God here was doing that we call in the Bible the placing of a son he was born a son and he was fell air to his father Kingdom or possession he had to be raised and tried God he find out whether the son is true or not or simply a rust about and this son would be would never be a if he wasn't qualified to take the father's place but if he was qualified and took the father's place all the father had given was to the son and I think many of us Pentecostal people has made a mistake we think as soon as we become sons and daughters that settles it we just come into a place of trying so the Pentecostals couldn't get the character to be endued efficiently and effectively with power because they didn't take the chastisement and the discipline they r on gifts they still speaking tongues and they give money oh praise the name of the Lord he said we just come into a place of trying the Methodist said as soon as they shouted that settle it the Lutheran believe faith and justification thought that settled it no matter what kind of position God put you in you are still growing on towards perfection so until you have arrived you're pressing you're fighting you're struggling can somebody say Amen so don't sit on Moses seat to judge me or judge the church or judge this one don't sit there come on from Moses seat let Moses be Moses you are not Moses come on from Moses seat oh give the Lord and shout hallelujah praise God hallelujah praise God Amen if you're Abraham seed and you look at the promise of God what God Said to do about it he said that's Abraham's seed now you got to come through those testings Abraham first was tested then sealed then given the promise the thing of it is we can't stand the tested and that's the reason that or organizations cannot stand the test it is not the will of God God has blessed it but it isn't the will of God because you've got a whole company of men here A whole company of ideas they pull together and come out the best of what they can some say this is a big man you can't his word and so on like that right all right Abraham never look at one thing but God's promise that's the reason we don't find more an organization here we go can't possess the Gate of the enemy so there's no group Revelation is individuals getting Revelation there's no church Revelation so watch organization can't possess the G an enemy there are too many fungle Minds in there it's got to take an individual that possess the gates of the enemy the thing you have to overcome oh my is yourself your idea before you blame this one and that one why don't you blame you why don't you look in the mirror stop making excuses it's always a aunt a uncle a tanty a father a mother brother your husband your this you no money you the car cut that rot out it's you do like Jonah I am the man throw me overboard it's you the thing you have to overcome is you oh glory to God overcome your idea your thing surrender yourself to him to overcome he knows the way we don't Oh Glory to God thank you Jesus I'm page nine Oh Glory we speed up real fast Hallelujah only 14 pages all right let's go here this in Noah's time eight Overcomers that went in they were caught inside eight Overcomers whatever you do who listening now who would listen Hereafter the always very late you have good intentions but don't be caught outside not him that will let or run it just let God just yield yourself to him walk on with a perfect satisfied faith that what God has promised is able to perform now we are expected in D Daniel's time there were four Overcomers that could stand a test of fire and lion we are expected to be tested that's a good lesson for my brother back there also he that comeing to God must first be tested you can't overcome L there a test given to you that why you have CXC you have GC you have Advance they must test you you go to school and you don't want to test how they will know what you do some of these children I see them with almost nothing in in school like one copy book or something so they going to school they Lear they leaving every day they going to school but they're not learning but they're on their way to school don't we that in church stay home no I begging nobody to be here we have no free Bible to give in Kentucky if I chicken gosts free chips no you have to want this thing as a reality all right let's hit the home session now all right you can overcome at least there's a test given to you and when a test is given it's to see whether you can overcome or not and Jesus said to him that overcome it the test is the greatest thing that ever happened to you two people say amen to the greatest thing to them the as I say somebody and they sue the L people for winning it they say ruined their life they they wi millions of pounds and they blow all the millions and mess up their life they're suing them like you're not supposed to have so much not I'm not supposed to win that so how could we return in the power of the spirit if there is no test given Jesus said come and say come the spirit no no no no no he passed your wilderness so to return in the power of the spirit it has to come true test Prophecy from perfect Faith the church has to lift itself in the power of God did you hear that the church has to lift itself in the power of God we are to close to the end now and I believe the church is in a condition where we can teach a little deeper things and rub some of the MC belief out and I believe that too oh glory to God hallelujah let's go notice Jesus did he heal everybody no sir when his was given power to heal the sick raise the dead cleanse the leper cast what Devils they were given did they heal everybody they come in t with no did they heal everybody they prayed for no miserably failed after they had was given power there it was laid the church has the power but not the Fate operated oh so when the man wasn't healed and they ask J why he wasn't healed he said because of your unbelief that's the same thing today Christ don't change people change your faith changes and from perfect Faith you know this quote they had power but not the faith to use the power there is the brandham Tabernacle there is the church the bride today the holy spirit is here with the power but you haven't got any faith to move it it takes Faith to move it so if Malachi 4 came to turn our hearts back to the faith of the PS the faith is to move the power so you can't talk that Faith you have to manif oh my God hallelujah you have to manifest that Faith oh do you get it now hallelujah praise God we almost reach a cap of what we have here now hallelujah hallelujah I believe the age has come now that the miraculous the phenomenal the baptism of the spirit and power and signs and wonders this great pouring out of God's spirit in the last days that's the thing that will bring Faith into the people I thought these Mysteries these seven T Mysteries literally turn the CH back to the F fast yeah that's one part but you had to take this part too you can't leave this part out he a great point out of the God's spirit that's the thing that will bring Fai into the people that will take a Rapture in faith that will take the church into Glory what great old point of the spirit they don't want to talk about that but I'm going to talk about that because God promis it God can't lie oh praise God praise God here we go when home Str now we zero now how can the church be raptured when we haven't even got faith for the healing we have got to have rapturing faith first what do he say how could you believe that your body will be changed and you can't believe cancer could dissolve your family had cancer this one had tumor this one had that that one had that we have to have faith for them things we have to demonstrate to the devil what kingdom we are from if the Lord I shouting the [Applause] H we never medical profession we should doctor come for injection come you go and see doctors for that go and see your doctor I a tell nobody see doctor go and see doctor you know they qualify in that area but I am saying listen before Jesus come nobody know what cast no Devils the closest to it was David PL har with them demons coming upon Saul when Jesus come he said get out they say wait a minute they saw a power they never saw before he cleansing leper he sending he casting out Devils he take Legion and cast them and make him normal he was showing a demonstration a higher power a different Kingdom all together hey glory to God that's why right Jesus said my kingdom is not of this world you have to demonstrate the power from in that Kingdom Glory Glory Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah ride with me ride with me ride with me ride with me right with me right now may be seated and when Jesus said to cast all Devils de demonstrating a higher power and a power From Another Dimension another kingdom all together they said he cast out Devils by Bob the king of devils and then Jesus made an astonishing statement he said no Kingdom divided against itself can stand and if I cast out the Devils by the devil that means Lucifer Kingdom cannot stand he said no house no family is a keeper there you know cannot stand if it's divided and if the bride body is divided can't stand there's got to be the repairer of the preach Give the Lord shout in the house glory to God God have to anoint a fful Ministry that will step in the Gap with the ministry of reconciliation to be repairers of the bridge oh give the Lord some Praises Oh Glory to God the restorer of Pastor dwelling [Applause] Hallelujah there got to be a fightful Ministry to return in the power of the spirit you can't go anywhere if the fightful is not there glory to God there have to be a stand somewhere glory to God let's go this is the cap here now what we get into now now but the BR preacher message called the message of Grace and he use the scripture from Zechariah that we read today then he says we are all acquainted with this scripture that the Bible that read the Bible was during the time of the preparation of the restoration of the temple and zerubabel was a great Prince among the people who had laid the foundation of the building now you and I want to put on your spiritual thinking anointing jacket this morning the great Prince was determined to rebuild the house of the Lord and when he did he had laid the foundation stone and as we read on further we find out that God said Z rubel had laid the foundation with his hands he shall also bring forth The Headstone I want you to notice he never said about the Cornerstone you shall bring for The Headstone and we know that the scripture say that Jesus is the Chief Cornerstone he's also the headstone and here we go if we will think for a few minutes that the seventh Church messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers and he is interpreting that here now brother Lyon in other words rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit brother over it what are you preaching this morning I am saying the church this bright Church message church has to be rebuilt under the power of the spirit Oh Glory to God Jesus return in the power of the spirit there's got to be a fold Ministry that enter into dead desert and Wilderness and come back under the power of the spirit to rebuild the church not by might not by power but by my spirit sayth the Lord oh glory to God the rebuilding of the Bride church I know it's

right now it could start with youbody CCH that here right now oh glory to God for as we wrap up here he talk about Joshua standing in place of Moses and so like that he said each minister is called to stand where he would the works that I do shall you do also each Minister ordained of God is commanded to stand in the tracks of Jesus Christ and perform the duties that Jesus performed Hallelujah quite a command he said now watch he told Mo Joshua I not fail thee as I was with Moses I'll be with you he said now for instance Moses was the church age that brought them to Sinai to their Theology of last night Moses was not permitted to take the children of Israel over to the promised land because he had failed and then he prophecy come upon and the church organization denomination has failed they will not take the church over God will raise up a new system a inter interational system by the power of God that will take the church into the promised land he said organization and Elation has messed it up each one in their own theology after their own way of thinking but God here we go I'm closing will take his Holy Spirit and would raise up his Joshua that will take the church into the promise with no denominational string tied anywhere but will take over his church the church will be rebuilt under the power of the spirit not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayth the Lord
