[12:45] their faith could rest solemnly upon
[12:47] what you have promised God may it never
[12:50] become boring to them these precious
[12:53] promises that we have been preaching for
[12:55] years and lay in your word may it not be
[12:58] come ordinary but it may always be
[13:02] special father we could see that the God
[13:05] who spoke these promises is obligated to
[13:07] fulfill them and we are resting on that
[13:11] our trust is in the speak to the weak
[13:15] ones the struggling ones the ones that
[13:17] have mind battles the ones who have
[13:18] under oppression depression whatever it
[13:20] is may they be delivered tonight they
[13:22] need sick in our midst may they be
[13:24] healed tonight in Jesus name I ask it
[13:27] amen and amen
[13:29] God bless you and thanks again for being
[13:31] here tonight I'm excited uh for this
[13:34] time of prayer and to share some with
[13:36] you tonight and this is the prophet
[13:41] speaks persecution and trials are a
[13:45] natural normal part of the Christian
[13:47] Life there's only one thing you can do
[13:50] about them commit them all to God judge
[13:54] not and leave the outworking and final
[13:57] judgment to him
[13:59] thou can not bear them which are evil
[14:02] this on Ephesians CH and as try them
[14:05] which say their Apostles and are not and
[14:07] has F them Liars but this is coming back
[14:09] again where a lot of guys will be tried
[14:13] to see what they claim is valid and has
[14:16] found them
[14:18] liar these words now these
[14:21] Ephesians believed that God's people
[14:25] ought to be
[14:27] holy according to the verse they took
[14:31] steps to keep the body unleavened from
[14:35] sin most evidently the apostasy had
[14:39] already
[14:40] started sin had entered into the church
[14:44] but they were obedient to the words of
[14:46] Paul when he said to put away that
[14:49] Wicked from amongst
[14:51] them here we go they were a separated
[14:55] people they had come out of the world
[14:59] and now they weren't going to let the
[15:03] world enter amongst
[15:05] them they would not put up with sin in
[15:08] the
[15:09] church
[15:10] Holiness wasn't
[15:12] afraid with them or a figure of
[15:16] speech it was a way of life and to that
[15:20] end what I got to share with you tonight
[15:24] is two words sanctify yourselves those
[15:28] are the words I have for you tonight
[15:31] sanctify
[15:33] yourselves and this here I'm about to
[15:35] read is from John chapter
[15:38] 17 14- 21 that's the scriptures if you
[15:41] have your Bible you can follow me I have
[15:43] a few scriptures to read tonight and you
[15:45] can follow through with me St John
[15:48] chapter 17 from verse 14 Jesus was
[15:52] speaking I have given them Thy word and
[15:55] the world had hated them because they
[15:59] not of the world even as I am not of the
[16:02] world I pray not that thou shouldest
[16:06] take them out of the world but that thou
[16:09] should keep them from the evil they are
[16:12] not of the world even as I am not of the
[16:15] word sanctify them through thy truth Thy
[16:19] word is truth as thou Hast sent me into
[16:22] the world even so have I sent also sent
[16:27] them into the world
[16:29] and for their
[16:31] sakes
[16:33] I sanctify
[16:36] myself that they also might be
[16:40] Sanctified through the truth let me
[16:43] repeat that verse again it's verse 19
[16:45] and for their sakes this is Jesus
[16:47] speaking I
[16:50] sanctify myself that they also might be
[16:54] Sanctified through the truth neither
[16:58] pray I for these alone but for them also
[17:02] which Shall Believe on me through their
[17:03] word that they all may be one as thou
[17:06] father art in me and I in thee that they
[17:08] also may be in one in us that the world
[17:11] might believe that thou has sent
[17:14] me a scripture we read I believe it was
[17:17] Wednesday night 2 Corinthians
[17:19] 7:1 having therefore these promises
[17:22] there be dearly beloved let us cleanse
[17:26] ourselves from all the filter of of the
[17:28] Flesh and
[17:30] spirit perfecting Holiness in the fear
[17:34] of
[17:36] God and one more scripture we're going
[17:39] to read Joshua chapter
[17:40] 3 verse 1
[17:42] to5 and
[17:44] Joshua Rose early in the morning and
[17:47] they removed from shitan and came to
[17:49] Jordan he and all the children of Israel
[17:52] and lodged deer before they passed over
[17:55] and it came to pass after three days
[17:57] that the officers went through the host
[17:59] and the command of the people saying
[18:01] when you see the Ark of the Covenant of
[18:04] the Lord your God and the priest the
[18:06] Levites bearing it then he shall remove
[18:09] from your place and go after it yet
[18:12] there shall be a space within you and it
[18:15] about 2,000 cubits by measure come not
[18:17] near unto it that he may know the way
[18:20] which he must go for you have not pass
[18:22] said before and Joshua said unto the
[18:26] people sanctify yourself
[18:29] for
[18:30] tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among
[18:33] you so this was God's
[18:38] program before they inherit this land
[18:41] and this is what the prophet says now
[18:44] now when you are
[18:45] asked you are forgiven of your sins you
[18:49] only done this taken that away but the
[18:52] thing that make you do it is still there
[18:54] that all root of evil it is still there
[18:57] notice you repent
[18:58] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[19:00] he forgive you of your sins then
[19:02] secondly comes
[19:05] sanctification
[19:06] which here we go sets our mind in order
[19:11] for Holiness to think right let's pause
[19:15] another a bit
[19:17] sanctification now don't think for one
[19:19] moment I'm preaching Wesley now in that
[19:21] sense or sanctification message and we
[19:24] pass that no no no no no no this still
[19:26] applies what we hear sharing here right
[19:28] now tonight right let listen closely
[19:32] sanctification which sets our mind in
[19:36] order for Holiness to think right and
[19:40] sanctification is a compound Greek word
[19:42] which means clean and set aside for sins
[19:47] so that's the word signification clean
[19:50] and set aside for sins now let's
[19:53] continue now I've typed it with Joshua
[19:55] if you notice Israel was brought out of
[19:57] Egypt and it were three stages of the
[19:59] journey one stage leaving Egypt next
[20:02] stage Wilderness next stage Canaan
[20:04] Canaan does not represent the Millennium
[20:07] it only represent the age of the
[20:09] Overcomer the dispensation of overcoming
[20:12] because in Canaan they killed and burn
[20:14] and took cities there'll be no death in
[20:16] the Millennium but another thing that it
[20:18] does it brings justification by faith
[20:21] after the believe in Moses
[20:23] sanctification and following under the
[20:24] pillar of fire and the atonement of the
[20:26] sacrificial lamb in the wilderness and
[20:28] then entering into the land that have
[20:31] been promised land that have been
[20:33] promised now what is the land promised
[20:37] to the New Testament believer us now the
[20:40] promise here we go is the holy
[20:43] spirit it shall come to pass that in the
[20:46] last days Joel 2:28 I will pour out my
[20:50] spirit upon All Flesh your sons and
[20:52] daughters shall prophesy and upon my
[20:54] hand handmaids and my M servants will I
[20:57] pour my spirit they shall prophesy I'll
[21:00] show wonders of heav and so forth all
[21:02] right did you
[21:04] notice Joshua here we go before the
[21:08] Cross Jordan Joshua said go to the midst
[21:13] of the camp clean your clothes and
[21:17] sanctify every one of you let no man
[21:21] come at his wife for within three days
[21:25] you will see the glory of God
[21:28] see and this is the part of emphasis you
[21:31] know it is a
[21:34] process of getting ready to inherit the
[21:39] promise so cleansing sanctification
[21:43] fasting praying making things right
[21:47] dropping ODS thinking right making that
[21:50] effort to set your mind to his Holiness
[21:53] is part of the process of getting ready
[21:58] to inherit the promise this here is the
[22:02] legalistic part this is the part where
[22:04] you stop smoking stop drinking stop
[22:06] running around stop having your dress
[22:08] above your knee you know stop fooling
[22:10] with the boys fooling with the girls
[22:11] stop fooling around with life stop
[22:13] fornicating stop stop it stop movies
[22:17] whatever this is where you make that
[22:20] decision to clean up your act and clean
[22:23] up yourself now the promise to Israel
[22:26] was God gave the Promised Land of
[22:29] Palestine it was to be their possession
[22:31] let's
[22:35] continue Israel had sinned they had
[22:40] transgressed my Covenant which I have
[22:42] commanded them this is from
[22:46] Leviticus okay Leviticus
[22:49] 11:44
[22:51] no oh no no no this is Joshua 7: 11-4
[22:56] Israel had sinned this is God speaking
[22:59] and they have transgressed my Covenant
[23:01] which I commanded them for they have
[23:03] even taken their cursed thing that have
[23:06] also stolen and disassembled also and
[23:08] they have put it even among their own
[23:10] stuff now this is when they were
[23:12] fighting all of a sudden one battle is
[23:15] because they come running so much men
[23:17] get killed and whatnot and Joshua
[23:19] stopped the whole camp and say wait a
[23:20] minute cour promises Victory what promis
[23:23] US Victory after Victory how come Israel
[23:25] turning their backs how come we are
[23:27] being defeated come men are dying
[23:29] something is wrong stop stop stop we
[23:32] cannot continue like this something is
[23:34] wrong and God begin to tell them Israel
[23:36] sin Israel have have have have stolen
[23:40] stuff things among their own stuff verse
[23:43] 12 of Joshua 7 says therefore the
[23:46] children of Israel could not stand
[23:48] before their enemies stop right there so
[23:52] how could you expect God to trample the
[23:56] feat push back your enemies if you have
[24:00] stuff that belongs to the
[24:02] enemy but therefore Israel could not
[24:05] stand before the enemies but turn their
[24:07] backs before the enemies because they
[24:11] were a cursed neither will I be with you
[24:14] anymore except you destroy the cursed
[24:19] from among you so God wasn't coming to
[24:22] touch anything they had God s my hand
[24:24] off for you unless all clean up your act
[24:26] unless you get rid of whatever is wrong
[24:30] whatever is an issue whatever you have
[24:32] to get out of your life you deal with it
[24:35] look at verse
[24:37] 13
[24:39] and the Bible is written in such a
[24:42] classic way in such a a powerful way no
[24:46] word is like out of line there's no like
[24:49] how we say God is t t r s e he he's con
[24:54] concise precise to the point the first
[24:58] word in 13 is
[24:59] up that one word come up sanctify the
[25:03] people and
[25:06] say you know think about it now early in
[25:08] the morning maybe people have those have
[25:10] sleepy and they waking up struggling and
[25:12] a voice said up get up
[25:14] up sanctify the people and say sanctify
[25:19] yourselves against tomorrow for thus
[25:23] sayeth the Lord God of Israel there is
[25:25] an accurs thing in the midst of Thee oh
[25:28] Israel thou can not stand before thine
[25:32] enemies until he take away the curs
[25:36] thing from among you in the morning
[25:39] therefore he shall be brought according
[25:41] to your tries and it shall be that the
[25:45] tribe which the Lord taken shall come
[25:47] according to the family thereof and the
[25:50] family which the Lord shall take shall
[25:52] come by
[25:53] households and the household which the
[25:55] Lord shall take shall come Man by man
[26:00] and we know the story we will go to
[26:02] details of that Aon was caught with a
[26:05] Babylonian bment and different and
[26:07] Babylonian stuff and the whole family
[26:10] was destroyed and then Israel was back
[26:12] on track so let's continue
[26:15] Leviticus 11: 44- 45
[26:19] much 44 of Leviticus 11 for I am the
[26:23] Lord your God he shall therefore
[26:26] sanctify
[26:28] yourselves and ye shall be holy for I am
[26:31] Holy so this sanctification is not for
[26:34] Sunday morning only on Wednesday night
[26:37] or when you think this has to become a
[26:41] way of
[26:42] life I am the Lord your God which you
[26:45] and ye shall therefore sanify yourselves
[26:48] you shall be holy for am Holy neither
[26:50] shall you defile yourselves with any man
[26:52] of creeping thing that creep upon the
[26:53] Earth verse 45 for I am the Lord that
[26:57] bringe you up out of Egypt to be your
[27:00] God ye shall be holy for I am
[27:05] Holy First
[27:07] Chronicles chapter
[27:10] 15 verse
[27:12] 14 and the Bible says and said unto them
[27:15] and this is for the this is for the
[27:18] priests now ministers ye shall be the
[27:21] chief of fathers of the Levites sanctify
[27:22] yourselves both ye and your brethren
[27:25] that you may bring the Ark of the Lord
[27:27] God of Israel into the place that I
[27:29] prepared for it for because you did it
[27:31] not at first the Lord Our God made a
[27:34] breach upon us for that he sought him
[27:36] not after the due order so there's an
[27:39] order in which God operates with so the
[27:43] priest Bible said in verse 14 and
[27:46] Levites Sanctified themselves to bring
[27:50] up the Ark of the Lord God of Israel
[27:53] brother BR here you
[27:56] are
[28:01] okay something was looking for is Lord
[28:04] he said there you are don't fall short
[28:07] of that brother without the baptism of
[28:10] the Holy Spirit you are lost you won't
[28:12] have to worry about get into heaven if
[28:15] there's nothing in here your heart
[28:17] Supernatural the doors can't unlock you
[28:20] would walk up there and bump your head
[28:22] against it but if the spirit of God is
[28:24] endear the spirit of God inside with
[28:27] unhinged doors you got to have the thing
[28:29] in here to unlock it Yonder now here he
[28:33] comes talking about Jesus he was Torn to
[28:37] Pieces his soul went to God God blessed
[28:41] him and then his soul here we go
[28:44] returned back in the form of the baptism
[28:48] of the holy ghost that comes into every
[28:51] believer to
[28:54] sanctify to clean up the mind to clean
[28:57] up the heart and leave a portion of the
[29:02] Holy Ghost in there here and there and
[29:05] when the Holy Ghost is given out that
[29:08] same holy spirit that brought the body
[29:10] of Jesus out of the gra out of the Grave
[29:14] will Rapture and that Covenant has to
[29:17] Dove tail he tore there and gave the
[29:20] body and went back to God and the Spirit
[29:22] came back to the Earth then your spirit
[29:26] will have to be the same kind of spirit
[29:29] or it will miss that place going
[29:31] together not because you make yourself
[29:34] but because something the love of God
[29:36] has swept over your soul and tore every
[29:39] Earthly Idol out you believe in God's
[29:43] son God is in his son God is in his
[29:47] Universe God is in his word God is in
[29:50] his people what the death of Christ was
[29:54] was to sanctify a church that he might
[29:57] work through to continue his work so he
[30:01] is kneeling it down that the death of
[30:03] Christ was to bring a Sanctified bunch
[30:07] of people a people who Holiness wouldn't
[30:10] be a phrase but it would be a way of
[30:13] life he says and this is the beautiful
[30:17] part he
[30:19] says he didn't have to
[30:23] die he says no man take my life I lay it
[30:31] down and he was comparing that to ISA
[30:35] because when Isaac asked Abraham I see
[30:39] the word I see the fire where is the
[30:41] sacrifice he said go Prov the sacrifice
[30:43] and when Isaac was tied Isa didn't fight
[30:45] and carry on he submitted himself to die
[30:50] so B says Isaac was willing to submit
[30:53] himself to death Jesus he didn't have to
[30:56] die he said no man take my life I lay it
[30:59] down and he did that that through that
[31:02] sacrifice that fulfilled scripture that
[31:05] Bloody sacrifice now this is the part
[31:07] was so beautiful he said I think the
[31:10] sweetest scripture here in all the Bible
[31:12] is this scripture father I sanctify
[31:17] myself because of
[31:19] them he was a man he could have had a
[31:23] wife he was a man he could have had a
[31:26] home
[31:27] a place to lay his head he had rights to
[31:31] that he was a man he could have had good
[31:34] clothes he was a man what did he say
[31:38] father I sanctify myself for their sake
[31:43] what was he doing he was training up 12
[31:46] disciples that was going to preach the
[31:48] gospel in all the world he put an
[31:51] example and Brethren as ministers I tell
[31:55] you it pays us not not to get too much
[31:58] of the world goods and things hanging
[32:00] around us you preachers I'm talking to
[32:03] sanctify yourself for them that you're
[32:06] going to lead that is what we need today
[32:09] is a complete
[32:12] consecrated Sanctified life of ministers
[32:15] that will walk upright before God does
[32:18] not entangle with the things of the
[32:19] world keep a away from it father I
[32:23] sanctify myself for their sake not
[32:26] because he had to do it but he did it
[32:30] for their
[32:32] sake so you take a vessel and you pick
[32:35] it up it's full of mud it is Justified a
[32:38] man has to pick it up the next thing has
[32:41] got to be cleaned and scored out and the
[32:44] word sanify means clean and set aside
[32:48] for service but set aside for service
[32:52] don't mean you are in service then Jesus
[32:57] said blessed the
[32:59] day
[33:00] wow when you hung onto for righteousness
[33:04] you shall be filled so you see here we
[33:07] go the Holy Ghost come came on the
[33:12] sanctifying real true Sanctified
[33:16] believer underline that word not just
[33:19] I'm in the message are you a Sanctified
[33:24] believer what does sanctified means it's
[33:27] a compound word Greek word which means
[33:29] to be
[33:30] cleaned and set aside for service the
[33:33] word sanctify in the English means make
[33:35] clean in Hebrew it means make holy the
[33:40] Greek means Sanctified clean and holy is
[33:44] the same thing it is what sets aside for
[33:47] service and about two more quotes and we
[33:50] done now
[33:52] one believe on the Lord Jesus Christ for
[33:55] your house apply the token to your house
[33:59] now watch then what do you do when you
[34:05] apply it to your house and I don't just
[34:07] want you to think about it from a
[34:09] physical house standpoint I want you to
[34:11] think about it from your body from your
[34:13] temple your house that he was Liv move
[34:16] all the trash out get all the short
[34:20] skirts and the shorts and the cards and
[34:24] the cigarettes and television whatever
[34:27] more kick them out the door when you go
[34:31] to apply the token so applying the token
[34:33] is not talk they have a lot of people
[34:35] like to talk and talk and talk we're not
[34:37] talking about talk we talking about
[34:39] action applying the token means move all
[34:43] the trash out get all the short skirts
[34:46] the shorts the cards the cigarettes so
[34:48] tell me you a mother you don't know what
[34:50] kind of clothes your daugh wear you
[34:52] don't see what in her closet you don't
[34:54] see with licking in her and she under
[34:56] your roof
[34:57] now watch the cards the cigarettes
[35:00] televisions and whatever more kick them
[35:02] out the house the door then you go to
[35:04] apply this open it won't stand still for
[35:06] it all the dances parties rock and roll
[35:09] vulgar newspapers and the stuff of the
[35:11] world kick it out the door say we are
[35:14] cleaning up this space around here two
[35:17] more
[35:18] we water don't save a
[35:22] man it takes the blood of Jesus Christ
[35:26] there's no life in water
[35:28] life comes in the blood cell take
[35:31] sanctification to cleanse that life to
[35:33] kill the desire of sin then the Holy
[35:37] Spirit comes into a clean vessel set it
[35:40] aside in work service the altar
[35:43] Sanctified The Vessel but here we go
[35:46] it's the filling is what put it in
[35:49] service it was set aside for service now
[35:52] it's got to be put in service and the
[35:54] Holy Ghost puts the church
[35:57] in
[35:58] service and the final quote I have here
[36:01] sanctification is when your name goes on
[36:03] the book as a Believer your name is wrot
[36:08] in his blood so therefore sanctification
[36:12] or even a Sanctified life is real
[36:15] evidence that you are in this message is
[36:18] an evidence that your name is on the
[36:20] book and you want to live for Christ and
[36:22] you want to make the sacrifices that god
[36:24] require of you if it means stopping
[36:26] cutting off this one shaving this and
[36:28] whatever it is if you know down in your
[36:30] heart you're not doing all that you can
[36:32] do you wouldn't have ha you would have
[36:34] confidence to get access to Healing
[36:37] Deliverance spiritual because your
[36:39] mechanics is not right inside of you you
[36:40] know your heart is not right but tonight
[36:43] you have a tremendous opportunity to get
[36:45] your heart right you're not getting your
[36:46] heart right because you're going to
[36:47] church you're getting right with God
[36:49] it's God we talking about when the god
[36:51] came down on the mountain and the
[36:52] mountain begin to quake and rck the
[36:54] people said don't let God speak let
[36:56] Moses speak God say okay I'm going to
[36:58] come through a man a prophet to speak my
[37:01] voice but that voice of God is still
[37:03] have thunders and lightning and I'll
[37:05] close you this remember friends what we
[37:07] call Mercy Seat is where your judgment
[37:10] throne with blood on it the blood give
[37:13] us the opportunity to access God's mercy
[37:16] we were born in sin shape iniquity on
[37:18] our way to Hell deserve to go to hell
[37:20] but God rich in Mercy rich in Mercy
[37:23] something that he's rich in that is why
[37:26] he w
[37:27] that is why he calls that is why he send
[37:30] ministers and preachers and testimonies
[37:32] and gospel and every light to tell you
[37:35] don't go that route don't go that way
[37:38] but by stubbornness by being enticed by
[37:41] our own Lust by our own desires and
[37:43] decisions and choices and we pay the
[37:45] price of our wrong decisions and choices
[37:48] but tonight I have a word from you
[37:51] sanctify yourself and you will see what
[37:54] God do to you through you by you for you
[37:58] let's bow our heads heavenly father I
[38:00] thank you tonight I believe is a word
[38:02] from you that you give me to share to
[38:04] your people sanctify yourselves lord
[38:07] it's part of your process of inheriting
[38:11] Lord this Kingdom you said sanctify them
[38:13] by thy truth Thy word is truth it's not
[38:16] a phrase Lord It's a word that must be
[38:18] applied in order to walk this part of
[38:21] sanctification it's an effort it's a
[38:24] legal part it's a requirement of yours
[38:27] who he found he called who he called he
[38:29] justified who he justified he had
[38:30] already glorified it said nothing about
[38:32] sanctification because sanctification is
[38:34] the P we work out oh God Hebrews tell
[38:37] Corinthians tell us having therefore
[38:39] these precious promises let us cleanse
[38:42] ourselves you are not going to come down
[38:44] with fork and hoe the clean of the land
[38:46] the people came out of Egypt they had no
[38:48] land they came into a promised land and
[38:51] they had to clean up they had to cut
[38:53] down the trees and and clean up this
[38:55] area and plant and eat of the Corn and
[38:57] so on Mana ceased no more mana mana was
[39:01] required in the wilderness where by your
[39:03] mercy Mana from Heaven fell every
[39:06] morning they picking up fresh Mana but
[39:07] once they hit that land they had to
[39:09] plant they had to S they had to reap
[39:12] they have to wait for rain Sun they have
[39:14] to go into the laws of the land the laws
[39:17] of your economy of the land and that is
[39:19] where they had success as long as they
[39:22] keep away from accurs things as long as
[39:25] they didn't hide stuff and I think among
[39:27] their stuff they would be successful in
[39:29] conquering the land help us Lord to see
[39:33] that the vision is just the same as it
[39:35] was to those Believers and those people
[39:37] in the Old Testament under Joshua it is
[39:40] the same Lord you have sent you sent a
[39:42] prophet and now Joshua the holy spirit
[39:45] is here to guide us into the word to
[39:47] tell us what to do father God May some
[39:50] Cross Jordan tonight and may you baptize
[39:52] them right in their homes where the holy
[39:54] was on fire may they bust through may
[39:56] they break through May they be
[39:58] encouraged Lord May their faith and soul
[40:00] be lifted up in your presence that you
[40:01] could confirm their word to their hearts
[40:03] and lives Grant it Lord and as they get
[40:05] on in prayer with the spirit of prayer
[40:06] and supplication take a hold upon them
[40:08] in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen so
[40:12] as you get on in prayer may you see it
[40:14] as real that God sent a word that you
[40:17] could be Sanctified and stay Sanctified
[40:21] and God going to bless you so God be
[40:23] with you as we get on in prayer
[40:25] tonight
