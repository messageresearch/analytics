[32:16] to present tonight
[32:18] is time tested fate hallelujah time
[32:22] tested faith those are true just three
[32:25] words but there's a lot in there
[32:27] isn't that right first want to talk
[32:29] about fate
[32:31] and then we want to talk about testing
[32:34] well that's another subject
[32:35] oh it's awesome to have faith but then
[32:38] god's love to test that fate
[32:40] to see if it's real to see if it's pure
[32:44] to see if it's the real thing amen oh
[32:47] it's got to be tested in order to be
[32:49] trusted oh hallelujah
[32:51] and then finally we're going to talk
[32:52] about time if the lord permits
[32:54] oh god loves to put time on things
[32:57] hollis stretched things way out until
[33:00] his word came the word of the lord
[33:02] tried joseph oh in prison
[33:06] oh however he was called of god he had a
[33:08] prophecy of his life
[33:10] holly is what's the switch from the
[33:11] prophet to the prophecy
[33:13] hallelujah in his life but yet he had to
[33:16] wait
[33:16] till the word of god and his season will
[33:19] come to pass hallelujah
[33:20] oh my my my
[33:24] amen hallelujah to put it another way
[33:27] tonight
[33:27] so what we're talking about tonight if
[33:29] you put it another way we can say
[33:31] faith that stands the test of time amen
[33:35] that's what they're talking about amen
[33:37] time tested faith praise god
[33:40] hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah
[33:44] hallelujah glory amen
[33:47] oh so now jesus said by your fruits you
[33:49] shall know them
[33:50] isn't that right in order to know what
[33:52] kind of tree it is
[33:53] we have to see the fruits that it is
[33:56] bearing
[33:56] oh hallelujah and faith is the evidence
[33:59] of things you can't see
[34:01] oh hallelujah so by faith you declare
[34:03] that my fruits are coming
[34:05] my fruits are coming even though you
[34:07] can't see it even though the devil can't
[34:09] see it
[34:09] your faith is prophesying it shall be
[34:12] it shall be it's going to be on your
[34:16] anointing your faith is anointing
[34:18] the promise of god to you it's a reality
[34:21] to you
[34:21] it's a divine revelation to you oh
[34:24] hallelujah isn't that right that's why
[34:27] we can't stress enough
[34:28] the importance of revelation of personal
[34:32] revelation from god
[34:34] because when you see it the devil can't
[34:36] shake you
[34:37] when you see it the devil can't move you
[34:40] when you see it
[34:41] nobody have to tell you to worship
[34:42] nobody have to tell you to hook up on a
[34:44] wednesday
[34:45] nobody got to tell you to hook up on a
[34:46] sunday your heart is burning within you
[34:49] as he speaks to you by the way you can't
[34:52] help but praise him
[34:53] you can't help but shout you can't help
[34:55] but praise god
[34:56] you can't help but kill any atmosphere

[35:17] time all the time and then when it
[35:19] happens
[35:20] it comes as a confirmation of your faith
[35:22] amen
[35:23] that you truly did believe in the word
[35:25] of god for the hour
[35:27] oh hallelujah praise god that the word
[35:29] of god is true
[35:30] and that god said soul and that he

[47:12] to take us to perfection order to take
[47:14] us to adoption
[47:16] hallelujah to take us to get these
[47:17] virtues in us a better thing
[47:19] for us that day without us are not made
[47:21] perfect that this thing when built in

[47:24] would bring up the dead in christ oh
[47:26] hallelujah i say yes sir
[47:28] oh hallelujah that's the purpose glory
[47:31] to god to cap the church or finally
[47:33] amen get her ready for the rapture amen
[47:36] isn't that right
[47:39] so whenever long hair now fate faith is
[47:41] more common than you realize
[47:43] the prophet said most of us use faith
[47:46] every day without realizing it
[47:47] isn't that right hallelujah this little
[47:50] word faith prophet said have faith in
[47:51] god
[47:52] hallelujah and uh time tests of faith he
[47:54] said oh
[47:56] i'm told that an old testament that
[47:58] faith in the old testament
[48:00] was the same way it is in the new
[48:01] testament here's the prophecy
[48:03] said so many people stumble at the
[48:05] thought of faith
[48:06] but it's so simple to have faith he said
[48:08] for instance you can't move out of your
[48:10] seat
[48:11] if you were able to come in and sit down
[48:14] you cannot move from your seat
[48:16] unless you had faith that you do it oh
[48:18] my he said you can't put your hat on
[48:20] again
[48:21] unless you had faith that you could do
[48:22] it he said never can you draw another
[48:25] breath
[48:26] unless you had faith you could do it he
[48:28] said faith is so
[48:30] common that when we look at it for
[48:32] something a little unusual
[48:34] and go way over the top of it trying to
[48:36] find it he said it's what's right
[48:38] next to us oh hallelujah
[48:41] [Applause]
[48:42] hey man so this subject we're talking
[48:44] about tonight is not something way in
[48:47] over your head
[48:48] brother it's something right next to you
[48:50] holiday you live in it every day and you
[48:52] don't even realize
[48:53] when you turn your key in your car and
[48:55] you say i'm going somewhere
[48:57] i'm going out to get the groceries i'm
[48:58] going to do this or whatever that
[49:00] faith take faith to do that to know that
[49:02] that coward start praise god and know
[49:04] that you was gonna come back
[49:05] hallelujah you told your wife he was
[49:07] coming back you told your husband you
[49:08] was coming back
[49:09] how do you know it was faith that told
[49:11] you that praise god
[49:12] hallelujah isn't that right calm and
[49:14] simple isn't that right
[49:16] he said in the old testament when the
[49:18] blood was applied on the door he said
[49:20] i'm told it was put on by hyssop
[49:22] dipped in the blood and rubbed over the
[49:24] door isn't that right
[49:25] his up is common weed and that is how it
[49:28] was applied
[49:29] by his up by something you could reach
[49:31] down anywhere
[49:32] and just grab a handful of it without
[49:35] even half trying isn't that right
[49:36] how appropriate that is and tonight to
[49:39] apply hyssop as fate
[49:41] he said you put the blood on by faith
[49:44] and how we're covered by the blood by
[49:46] fate by common fate holly
[49:49] branham said well you say but miracles
[49:51] and for healing brother branham is it
[49:53] some different type of fate
[49:54] no he said it's the same faith
[49:57] oh hallelujah he said there's only one
[50:00] faith
[50:00] and all good things and all and all good
[50:03] things and all things that are

[50:24] right amen

[50:31] give for your life i'd say well i want a
[50:33] loaf of bread
[50:34] the prophet said well you go into your
[50:35] pocket you'd pull out 25 cents or how
[50:37] much ever
[50:38] he said and you'd hand it to me and say
[50:39] here you are brother mr branham
[50:41] you don't have to starve he said well i
[50:43] might not have the bread yet
[50:45] but i got the purchase power of the
[50:47] bread oh hallelujah is that right

[50:52] but i can be just as
[50:54] happy with that quarter in my hand oh
[50:56] hell is when i got the brain in my hand
[50:58] because i've got the purchasing power of
[51:00] the bread oh

[51:03] to your soul and tell you something's
[51:05] gonna happen

[51:37] hallelujah the prophet says an
[51:38] astounding thing here let me back up a
[51:40] little bit
[51:40] he said now we know that man cannot move
[51:42] a mountain just by speaking to it
[51:44] he was talking about that reference
[51:45] scripture he said if you say to this
[51:46] mountain we move
[51:47] and don't doubt in your heart isn't that
[51:48] right he said now you didn't know that
[51:50] man can't move a mountain
[51:51] just by speaking to it he said the only
[51:53] thing you could do what
[51:55] would that that would be deity so then
[51:58] he said if
[51:59] the mountain let me say that again the
[52:01] only thing that could do
[52:02] that would be deity to move that
[52:04] mountain
[52:05] he said so then if the mountain is
[52:07] before us here's what he said
[52:08] and our objective is right and our
[52:11] motive is right
[52:12] then it isn't us speaking anymore it's
[52:15] deity that's speaking
[52:17] then it has to move oh hallelujah so
[52:20] when you line up
[52:21] with the word of god for your season and
[52:23] time it'll mean no more you speaking
[52:25] but it'll be deity speaking through you
[52:28] and in you
[52:29] hallelujah professor in the face that
[52:31] you claim to have
[52:33] hallelujah demonstrating on the spot
[52:36] here it is here it is hallelujah glory
[52:38] to god deity speaking through you
[52:41] oh isn't that then he said it has to
[52:42] move then he says i truly believe
[52:45] that the church is on the brink of one
[52:48] of the greatest outpourings
[52:49] that it has ever had in this age he said
[52:52] i believe it
[52:54] oh hallelujah hallelujah he said it's
[52:56] just something he said i can't say the
[52:57] lord told me
[52:58] but he said just something inside me
[53:00] just catching a hold of something that i
[53:02] haven't seen all my life until just now
[53:04] he said i don't know how glorious it is
[53:06] to know that just before the coming of
[53:07] the lord
[53:08] that these things are happening oh my
[53:11] hallelujah glory to god amen do you
[53:13] believe it tonight
[53:14] oh do you believe there's something
[53:15] coming forth from the lord that god's
[53:17] speaking to outpour his spirit one more
[53:19] time
[53:19] oh hallelujah he said now faith always
[53:22] experience
[53:24] an experience always a company's fate
[53:26] yes amen an
[53:28] experience always accompanies faith and
[53:30] how could it be tonight
[53:32] he said he said what good does it do to
[53:33] preach a bible
[53:35] uh of a god i could heal of a god that's
[53:38] got power
[53:40] isn't it and tell the people that the
[53:41] days of miracles has passed
[53:43] what good does it do to send ministers
[53:45] to seminaries and colleges
[53:47] and learn all these different things and
[53:49] then come tell the people
[53:51] that something that was isn't anymore he
[53:54] said what does it
[53:55] do it's just like taking a man that's
[53:57] freezing to death and say here's a nice
[53:59] picture of a big painted fire
[54:00] he said the man cannot get warm by a
[54:03] painted fire
[54:04] he is freezing he's got to have warmth
[54:08] oh hallelujah he has to have present
[54:10] tense warmth
[54:11] isn't that right and a man that's
[54:13] thirsting for god

[54:35] bring forth great faith oh hallelujah

[54:41] cannot trust a god you've never met
[54:43] oh that's powerful hallelujah some
[54:46] people they say they know about god
[54:48] but do you know him in the power of his
[54:51] resurrection
[54:52] have you felt it have you felt a mantle
[54:55] drop on you
[54:56] do you know what it is oh you might know
[54:58] the blessings of god
[55:00] but you don't know the power of god when
[55:02] it strikes you
[55:03] oh hallelujah when it struck the prophet
[55:05] he was numb for days
[55:07] all in the presence of that angel oh
[55:10] hallelujah
[55:10] but brother you've got an appointment to
[55:13] meet that angel
[55:14] personally tonight oh and have an
[55:16] experience

[55:28] to eternity hallelujah
[55:29] glory to connie man oh hallelujah
[55:33] hallelujah
[55:34] he said a man ain't qualified to stand
[55:38] behind the platform until he's met god
[55:41] and had an experience no person
[55:43] he said has the right to call himself a
[55:44] christian until first they had an
[55:46] experience with god he said that's right
[55:48] it was abraham
[55:50] he said he was just an ordinary man that
[55:51] came down and dwelt in
[55:54] in china down in the city of earth he
[55:56] was just an ordinary believer
[55:58] but one day remember scripture where we
[56:00] read tonight abraham
[56:02] he said one day god met him and he spoke
[56:04] to him
[56:05] and abraham had an experience and after
[56:08] abraham had that experience
[56:10] he could tell sarah go buy the birdie
[56:12] praise corn
[56:13] buddha get all the pins ready isn't that
[56:14] right we're going to have a baby
[56:17] i don't care how old you are amen isn't
[56:20] that right see why
[56:21] he had an experience first of talking
[56:24] face to face with god
[56:26] and he could call those things which
[56:28] you're not as though they were
[56:30] oh hallelujah after he had met god after
[56:33] he had an experience
[56:34] oh hallelujah a supernatural faith a
[56:38] spiritual thing
[56:39] isn't that right not before it it was uh
[56:42] that's what mattered with the people
[56:43] tonight
[56:44] in this big cities all the cities in the
[56:46] world
[56:49] it's because they refuse to receive the
[56:51] holy spirit he says
[56:53] oh my your methodist you baptist you
[56:56] presbyterian catholic said you're human
[56:58] beings
[56:59] and christ died for you and you've got
[57:01] just as much right to these blessings
[57:02] as a pentecostal house he said but the
[57:04] only thing it is that you just have to
[57:06] sign your name on a book a church book
[57:07] instead
[57:08] of saying this instead of staying there
[57:11] until you've got that experience
[57:13] that god has changed you by the baptism
[57:15] of the holy ghost
[57:16] he says it takes an experience to
[57:19] accompany
[57:20] faith he said and you know where you've
[57:22] been
[57:23] why david know what he's talking about

[1:02:32] i'll read it again tonight it seems so
[1:02:34] fitting
[1:02:35] he said so many says if the lord will
[1:02:36] take this evil spirit from me
[1:02:39] from drinking or gambling or from lying
[1:02:41] or stealing he said i'll serve him

[1:03:22] must be willing to lay it down
[1:03:25] see she has made herself ready i like
[1:03:26] that word he says so you couldn't
[1:03:28] push us through a little pipe and pull
[1:03:32] us out on the other end and then say
[1:03:33] blessed is he that overcome it
[1:03:35] you had nothing to overcome he just
[1:03:37] pushed you through
[1:03:39] but you've got to make decisions for
[1:03:41] yourself

[1:05:20] for 25 years isn't that right
[1:05:23] temptations
[1:05:24] all kinds of things in those 25 years
[1:05:26] but he held with the word of promise
[1:05:28] so says the scriptures isn't that right
[1:05:31] and israel was promised
[1:05:32] a land but they had to fight for every
[1:05:34] inch of it the prophet said

[1:11:06] through now here
[1:11:07] the prophet said on a message here time
[1:11:08] tested the memorials of god
[1:11:10] he said not long ago here down in
[1:11:12] australia he said under the british
[1:11:14] crown like south africa and stuff like
[1:11:15] that he gives a background here
[1:11:16] he says they talk about a bridge that
[1:11:19] they wanted to build from north sydney
[1:11:21] to south sydney
[1:11:22] he said and they call over to the
[1:11:23] country to get architects to build this
[1:11:26] bridge bridge builders
[1:11:27] to come now and build this bridge he
[1:11:29] said but none of them would take it
[1:11:30] no one would dare take it and as soon as
[1:11:33] they got there they found out that the
[1:11:34] bottom of that sea was shifting sands
[1:11:37] and it was quicksands and stuff nothing
[1:11:39] would stand on that foundation
[1:11:41] they tested it and sounded went on and
[1:11:43] so on and said we wouldn't believe we'd
[1:11:45] be able to undertake to build such a
[1:11:46] bridge he said it cannot be done
[1:11:49] so after a while a young architect the
[1:11:51] prophet said come up from england
[1:11:53] uh come down famous man reputable man he
[1:11:56] had a good reputation
[1:11:57] prophet said oh i like that i like a man
[1:12:00] with a reputation
[1:12:01] you don't have to be a big man you can
[1:12:03] be a pauper that lives in an alley
[1:12:05] and have a reputation far better than a
[1:12:08] potentate
[1:12:09] absolutely he says and you don't have to
[1:12:11] be rich you can just have a reputation
[1:12:14] oh hallelujah right it'll declare your
[1:12:16] reputation will declare what you are it
[1:12:18] makes you what you are
[1:12:20] it gives you a good reputation isn't
[1:12:21] that right said you know my reputation
[1:12:23] okay
[1:12:24] so he says this man went down here with
[1:12:25] a wonderful reputation look the
[1:12:27] situation over
[1:12:28] walked the banks for a few days and
[1:12:29] stuff like that when he finished the
[1:12:31] vein he said
[1:12:31] i'll take the job why he said sir you
[1:12:34] know what you're doing
[1:12:35] he said i thoroughly understand oh my he
[1:12:38] was
[1:12:39] completely sure isn't that right he said
[1:12:41] well this great architect
[1:12:42] uh american architects all over the
[1:12:44] world bridge builders they say they're
[1:12:45] afraid of the job
[1:12:46] that's the feedback he's getting is that
[1:12:48] right praise god he said but sir i'm not
[1:12:50] afraid of the job
[1:12:52] he said i'll take it he said amen he
[1:12:54] said i realize i have a reputation and
[1:12:56] stuff like that he said but i'll take it
[1:12:57] prophet said he had a vision
[1:12:59] oh holly said before a man can make a
[1:13:01] reputation he has to have a vision of
[1:13:03] what he
[1:13:04] is doing oh isn't that right the bible
[1:13:06] said without a vision
[1:13:08] the people perish that's why god sent us
[1:13:10] a prophet
[1:13:11] to show us a vision of how to build oh
[1:13:14] hallelujah how to build halal
[1:13:16] how god will rebuild this church in the
[1:13:18] power of the spirit
[1:13:19] oh not by my not by power oh holly it's

[1:13:29] isn't that right he said oh blessed be
[1:13:31] the lord that's the reason there's a
[1:13:33] heaven to go to

[1:13:36] as a christian we know
[1:13:38] what material is in this building oh
[1:13:41] hallelujah that's right it's the blood
[1:13:43] of jesus christ in that building that's

[1:13:55] prophet amen the bible said he that luck
[1:13:57] of these things are blind
[1:13:58] hallelujah and cannot see afar off and
[1:14:00] has forgotten that he was purged from
[1:14:02] his old sins
[1:14:03] but when god pours these virtues into

[1:14:46] like that
[1:14:47] but but beyond the sand was solid rock
[1:14:49] is basically what the prophet said here
[1:14:51] so he said he got in there and got great
[1:14:54] tubes down
[1:14:55] and he began to blow away the shifting's
[1:14:57] hand with some pumps
[1:14:59] until he blew it palm down to solid rock
[1:15:02] and when he got on the rock he anchored
[1:15:04] them great big bolts in there

[1:15:42] was fool's gold he said but all the fool
[1:15:44] was out of it he said why
[1:15:45] because the beaters they beat it he said
[1:15:48] and he beat it
