[12:55] whole like
[12:59] thee. Thank you Anthony. This is our
[13:02] heart desire that we be made more like
[13:05] him. Let's bow our head here so with a
[13:06] prayer. Heavenly Father, we thank you
[13:09] for bringing us together again tonight.
[13:11] And this is a privilege. This is an
[13:13] honor. And I pray and trust that each
[13:15] one would take it as that. We would not
[13:18] always have this opportunity, Father, to
[13:21] seek your face and to cry unto you.
[13:23] Because when that angel came along
[13:24] Revelation 10, Lord, the voice said,
[13:26] "Time shall be no more. Time
[13:30] itself runs out. The time is running
[13:33] out. Running out for the world system.
[13:36] Run off empires, kingdoms, countries.
[13:39] Time is running out. Father, soon we'll
[13:43] be meeting you. Oh God, I pray that you
[13:45] would speak a word to us that will bring
[13:48] light and life and bring a present
[13:50] reality. We're not here to fool the
[13:53] people, deceive the people, or say
[13:55] something just to make them feel good or
[13:56] or whatever, but they need to hear
[13:59] truth. So, may truth come forth tonight
[14:01] by your word and by your spirit that
[14:03] will lead us into a channel of prayer
[14:05] where we have direct access to you and
[14:07] your presence. Granted, God, in Jesus
[14:09] name I ask it. Amen. And amen. God bless
[14:11] you. And welcome tonight. Tonight, I
[14:15] have something I like to share with you
[14:16] before we get on in prayer. And if you
[14:18] have your Bibles, I'd like you to turn
[14:19] your Bibles to Numbers chapter 14,
[14:23] reading verse 41 to 45. After all the
[14:27] scriptures and see how that goes.
[14:29] Numbers chapter 14 verse 41 to 45. And
[14:34] Moses
[14:36] said, "Wherefore do we transgress the
[14:40] commandment of the Lord, but it shall
[14:42] not prosper?
[14:44] Go not up, for the Lord is not among
[14:47] among you, that he be not smitten before
[14:51] your
[14:52] enemies. For the Amalachites and the
[14:55] Canaanites are there before you, and he
[14:58] shall fall by the sword
[15:02] because ye are turned away from the
[15:05] Lord. Therefore, the Lord will not be
[15:08] with you.
[15:10] But they
[15:12] presumed to go up unto the
[15:15] hilltop. Nevertheless, the ark of the
[15:17] covenant of the Lord and
[15:19] Moses departed not out of the
[15:22] camp. Then the Amalachites came down and
[15:26] the Canaanites which dwell in the hill
[15:28] and smoke them and discomforted them
[15:32] even unto Homer.
[15:37] Reading
[15:38] Judges chapter
[15:39] 16 19 to 21 from the scripture reading
[15:43] from verse 19. This is Elila. She made
[15:46] him sleep talking about Samson upon her
[15:48] knees and she called for a man and she
[15:52] caused him to shave off the seven locks
[15:54] of his head and she began to afflict him
[15:58] and his strength went from him. And she
[16:02] said, "The Philistines be upon thee,
[16:05] Samson." And he awoke out of his sleep
[16:08] and said, "I will go out as at other
[16:12] times before and shake
[16:15] myself." And he wished not that the Lord
[16:18] was departed from him. But the
[16:21] Philistines took him, put out his eyes,
[16:25] and brought him down to Gaza, and bong
[16:28] him with fetterss of brass, and he did
[16:31] grind in the prison hopes. Our last
[16:34] scripture is from Luke chapter 2 reading
[16:36] from verse
[16:38] 42. And when he was 12 years old,
[16:40] speaking about Jesus, Luke 2:42, they
[16:43] went up to Jerusalem after the custom of
[16:45] the feast. And when they had fulfilled
[16:47] the days, as they returned, the child
[16:49] Jesus tried behind in
[16:52] Jerusalem. And Joseph and his mother
[16:54] knew not of it. But they supposing him
[16:58] to have been in the company went a day's
[17:00] journey, and they sought him among their
[17:03] kinfolk and acquaintance. And when they
[17:06] found him not, they turned back again to
[17:08] Jerusalem, seeking him. And it came to
[17:12] pass after 3 days, they found him in the
[17:14] temple, sitting in the midst of the
[17:16] doctors, both hearing them and asking
[17:19] them questions. And all that heard them
[17:22] were astonished at his understanding and
[17:25] answers.
[17:26] And when they saw him, they were amazed.
[17:28] And his mother said unto him, "Son, why
[17:31] hast thou dealt with us? Behold, thy
[17:34] father and I have sought thee sorrow."
[17:37] And he said unto them, "How is it that
[17:39] he sought me? They see not that I must
[17:42] be about my father's business. May God
[17:44] bless his word." Thanks again for being
[17:47] here tonight. Tonight, I have something
[17:49] to share with you. Why do you presume?
[17:53] That's my title tonight.
[17:56] Why do you presume? Now to
[17:59] presume is to suppose that something is
[18:02] the case on the basis of
[18:05] probability. To presume is to take for
[18:09] granted that something exist or is the
[18:13] case.
[18:15] Presuming is to adventure without
[18:17] authority.
[18:20] Presumption makes you jump to
[18:24] conclusion. Why do you
[18:26] presume? And remember the scripture we
[18:29] read these guys and if I got time to
[18:33] read it, these guys believe the Lord is
[18:36] with them, but they're presuming that
[18:38] Moses telling them point blank. God is
[18:39] not with you because you turn from the
[18:41] Lord. And this will reflect on all those
[18:45] people who like dates and this happened
[18:47] in this year 1982 or June or August or
[18:51] September and he was with me four years
[18:54] ago and three years ago and all the sort
[18:56] of historical drama I call that. But
[18:59] where is that in relevance to now and
[19:02] you will see what I'm we're getting at.
[19:04] Just hear these words. So God told him
[19:07] every place you put your foot is yours,
[19:10] right? And he said, "Now to you people
[19:12] that was prayed for all of you last
[19:14] night and somebody laid hands on you. We
[19:17] prayed. The presence of God came down
[19:19] and revealed himself right with the word
[19:21] to show that is the truth. There's no
[19:23] fooling. There's no mistake. It's the
[19:25] truth. We don't presume anything. We lay
[19:27] aside reasoning. We cast them down and
[19:30] take the word. Take the word and move
[19:32] on. The word said so. Now you say then
[19:36] the promise is mine." So God say the
[19:38] land is yours. Every place you take your
[19:40] foot is yours. Sure, but you'll fight
[19:44] every inch of it till you're
[19:47] well. Listen to what he's saying. He's
[19:50] talking to sick people and he's saying
[19:54] you cannot sit there and just presume
[19:57] you'll be well, presume or hope you're
[20:00] going to get well. You have to fight
[20:02] until you're well. Now, I don't believe
[20:05] in accepting sickness as a as God's
[20:07] will, God's plan. I am I reject that. I
[20:12] don't care what the sickness is.
[20:14] Sickness is of the devil. God could use
[20:16] sickness to discipline somebody and
[20:18] straighten somebody out. But healing is
[20:20] deterren. It is my right to claim
[20:22] healing. Can the doctor tell me I have
[20:25] 24 hours to live? It is my right to
[20:28] claim my healing even if I die 24 hours.
[20:32] But my right ears as a son, as a
[20:34] Christian, is to claim my healing. This
[20:36] is what I'm called to do. So brother
[20:38] Brandham says, "The promise is yours,
[20:40] minds, but you'll fight every inch of it
[20:42] till you're well. You will take every
[20:45] step of it. It's a battle. The promise
[20:47] is yours." That was a promised land.
[20:50] That was the promised land. But they had
[20:51] to fight to get every step of it. And
[20:54] the promise is yours, but you'll fight
[20:56] every inch of it. I was called by God to
[21:00] preach the gospel. 31 years ago I fought
[21:03] every ever since every inch of ground I
[21:06] fought with the sword of God taking the
[21:09] promise and cutting away. Now listen to
[21:11] this. Now this is getting deeper here.
[21:13] Now, now the way men and women do
[21:16] today, they will go so far in God. They
[21:20] will say, "I believe. Yes, I'll be
[21:23] baptized. I'll do this. Any rules of the
[21:25] church has to lay down." But when it
[21:27] come to surrender everything to Christ,
[21:31] so going to church, that's not a
[21:32] problem. Getting baptized, that's not a
[21:34] problem. Coming every Sunday, that's not
[21:35] a problem. hear this part. But when it
[21:37] comes to surrender everything to Christ,
[21:40] your life and all, that is where the
[21:42] line leaves. That is what make people
[21:45] say, "Well, I look at the rest of them."
[21:49] And here to you older Christians to to
[21:51] the younger the younger women look at
[21:53] the older women, the younger men look at
[21:56] the older men and see the way you
[22:00] conduct
[22:01] yourselves, see what you do. and they
[22:05] presume that they are all right is
[22:08] because you do the way you do. So what
[22:12] is he saying? The older women should be
[22:14] setting an example. The older men should
[22:17] be setting an example. Why is somebody
[22:20] watching you? You are older. He said now
[22:23] if the Pentecostal church would really
[22:25] live to its standard, if it would have
[22:28] lived what it claims to have, then the
[22:31] world will thirst after it. But when
[22:33] they got to see the Pentecostal church
[22:35] let down with so many things almost as
[22:37] the world has got, then they presume
[22:40] that they're just as good as you are. So
[22:43] why come to church? If you dress the way
[22:44] you dress, I could dress so too. If
[22:47] you're not sincere, I can be not sincere
[22:48] too. If you at the edge, I could be at
[22:51] the edge too. So watch you say what but
[22:54] we have got away from that. We can't
[22:57] presume. And tonight, if there's one
[22:59] thing I want to get across to you, let's
[23:01] not presume anything.
[23:03] Don't presume anything. We can't presume
[23:06] it. We have got to line up in the word.
[23:09] Now, it's almost an impossible thing to
[23:11] get people
[23:12] praying,
[23:14] fasting, calling on the Lord. See how
[23:18] weighted these words are relating to
[23:21] now. It is almost impossible thing to
[23:25] get people praying, fasting, calling on
[23:29] the Lord. It seemed like the church has
[23:31] got so drowsy and lazy in these last
[23:35] days, so pitiful. And I hate to come and
[23:39] just keep stirring and preaching and
[23:42] saying these things. But brother,
[23:43] sister, that's the truth. I just can't
[23:45] hold it. It's the gospel. It must be
[23:49] preached. So I think we are just
[23:52] presuming too much. We presume, this is
[23:55] huge.
[23:57] We presume, here we go. Because we had
[24:01] an experience five years ago, Brother
[24:03] Brandon, I was walking down the street
[24:05] one day and the Holy Spirit just blessed
[24:07] me and I run down the street. I thought,
[24:09] Lord, you have to take me somewhere cuz
[24:11] I I'm going to miss being on the
[24:13] street. Maybe you were out in the church
[24:16] and you got an experience. You spoke
[24:18] with tongues and think, well, that's all
[24:20] right. I can go ahead and okay, I see
[24:22] the rest of them doing this. You're just
[24:24] presuming that. So he is showing where
[24:28] historical experiences in context.
[24:31] People had genuine
[24:34] experiences 5 years ago, 10 years ago, 3
[24:37] years ago. But what is happening now?
[24:41] Israel. Yeah. Here why you typing it.
[24:43] Israel had these
[24:45] experiences. Israel had come out of
[24:47] Egypt. Israel had seen signs and
[24:49] miracles and wonders all along the road.
[24:52] They had passed through the Red Sea and
[24:53] dry land. They've seen mana fall out of
[24:55] heaven every night. They were witnessing
[24:58] the blessings of God upon their life.
[25:02] But then they
[25:03] failed. They disobey one of God's
[25:06] commandment. And what happened? The
[25:08] blessing cut off from them. They presume
[25:11] here we go that because God had been so
[25:14] good, he just go on be good on. But God
[25:18] can't do that.
[25:21] And I think we have come to that spot.
[25:24] We come to
[25:25] Aespania and God has given the issue for
[25:29] the church to call a halt and back to
[25:32] our prayer life, back to
[25:35] consecration, back to a spot where we
[25:38] consecrate ourselves away from the
[25:40] things of the world and away from our
[25:43] little petty differences among us and
[25:45] get back to God and brotherly love and
[25:49] humility. Back to the power of God
[25:52] again. You see, we line it up back to
[25:53] God. What next? Brotherly love. That's
[25:56] how you're going to deal and treat your
[25:57] brother. And what next? Humility. Back
[26:00] to the power of God. We are just
[26:02] presuming. And we are running. All
[26:04] right. But God is blessing. He was
[26:06] blessing Israel probably. Listen. Oh my
[26:08] goodness. He was blessing Israel the
[26:12] probably the same day they refused to go
[26:14] and take the promised land. The same day
[26:17] that the disbelieve the
[26:21] spies, listen to this church, the mana
[26:24] fell that same night, but they were all
[26:28] together out of the will of God. So this
[26:30] is people
[26:32] thinking that the blessings of God is
[26:34] with them despite of what they don't
[26:38] understand. God blessing just like the
[26:40] rain falling just and unjust. But God is
[26:43] trusting and believing that you will get
[26:45] back on track. and not rock back. You
[26:48] know, God still blessing me, but I'm
[26:49] doing this. That Samson, he's doing
[26:51] this. He's lying. He's doing this. He's
[26:54] doing that. But the covenant, he hasn't
[26:57] confess that yet. He hasn't broken that
[26:59] yet. When Delilah break him and he talk
[27:02] about his hair, she get them to come and
[27:04] cut him. And the Bible says that Samson
[27:07] shake himself as other times. So, he's
[27:11] telling himself, you know what? Uh, God
[27:13] is with me. Um, I throw it off. I break
[27:15] it off and it going to happen again. And
[27:17] then afterwards he recognized he did not
[27:19] even realize God was no longer with him.
[27:22] The anointing left him. He was just like
[27:24] a ordinary man. He didn't understand the
[27:28] strength, power, anointing, grace and
[27:32] uncction. It was by divine intervention
[27:35] was by of God. And you cannot play with
[27:38] that. It's not a play thing. So listen,
[27:41] they were all together out of the will
[27:42] of God. They could not win another
[27:44] battle until they come back and made
[27:48] things right with God. I think it is
[27:51] time for the church to get back to God
[27:53] again. Let me ask a question. When last
[27:56] have you won a
[27:59] battle? When last have you won a battle?
[28:03] You're in a battle and in a fight and
[28:06] you come true. When last has that
[28:08] happened to you that you say win a
[28:11] battle? And if you're not winning your
[28:13] battles, what is happening to your
[28:15] Christian walk? Because he promised to
[28:17] be with you. He promised to go before
[28:20] you. He promised to make a way for you.
[28:23] I'm not talking about little stumbles
[28:25] and what to do. I talking about win
[28:27] back. I think it's which was um brother
[28:30] Brian. I'm talking about or or Brother
[28:32] Gideon on Wednesday night was talking
[28:34] about um comprehensive licks beating the
[28:37] devil
[28:39] comprehensively where you have victory
[28:42] where you overcome where even though
[28:45] you're wrestling and you roll on the
[28:46] floor you get up on top. It can't it
[28:48] can't be a draw. It can't be well you
[28:50] know 50/50 50 50. No 50 50. You won. You
[28:55] overcome. You you you conquer what was
[28:58] conquering you. You have conquered it
[28:59] now. That is what we're talking about.
[29:01] Oh, praise the Lord. Let me see if we
[29:03] wrap up here.
[29:05] Brother, I think the time for the church
[29:08] to get back to God again, get back and
[29:11] get started like it was going on our
[29:14] journey. Yet, they know God was a good
[29:17] God. He was full of mercy. He had given
[29:20] them mercy. He had showed them his
[29:23] glory. Even their shoes wasn't wearing
[29:25] out. Their clothes wasn't getting tread
[29:28] bear. Mana was falling from heaven every
[29:31] night. They seen miracles and signs all
[29:34] along of the presence of God with them.
[29:36] Yet, here we go. This is so
[29:40] important. Yet, they
[29:43] presumed that because God had did
[29:47] that, they could go up there and take
[29:50] that mountain. So they they're joining
[29:52] strength from the historical experiences
[29:56] of what God did in the past and they
[29:59] taking that presuming as a cue as a sign
[30:04] that based upon the past I could plow
[30:07] into the future to say I'm conquering
[30:10] and overcoming and so on like that that
[30:12] line. But here it is, brother B. If we
[30:16] want spiritual gifts in the church, if
[30:19] we want the power of God, the real power
[30:21] of God, now I tell you, brother, sister,
[30:23] it's so easy for someone to be deceived
[30:25] on sensation and things. The devil can
[30:27] impersonate any any sensation that God
[30:29] has got. But you see, our church is not
[30:32] moving the way it should move. We know
[30:35] there is something wrong. We know then
[30:38] that God will not be with us until
[30:40] whatever it is is straightened out. So
[30:42] it is time to check up and see the
[30:45] things that we should do and what things
[30:47] we should not do. Look how specific this
[30:51] is. You are checking your own heart,
[30:54] your own mind, life, spirit to see what
[30:58] things you should do and to see the
[31:00] things that you should not do and then
[31:03] get ready and for that blessing.
[31:07] Now, good
[31:08] people almost done caught up in this
[31:12] thing. Good people, sincere people like
[31:16] Mary and Joseph, that why I read the
[31:17] scripture. They were very sincere. See,
[31:20] thinking he was with them when he
[31:22] wasn't. Mary and Joseph, I'm going to
[31:25] skip a little bit and so on. And many
[31:27] people think that he was with them when
[31:30] they shook hand with the preacher and
[31:32] put their name on the book, but he
[31:34] wasn't. Many people thought when they
[31:36] were sprinkled, confirmed, baptized in
[31:38] the name of fathers and holy ghost
[31:39] thinking he was with them. They're good
[31:40] people. Mary and Joseph, good people.
[31:43] The facts was he wasn't there. And then
[31:46] he said these words, don't presume
[31:51] anything. The foolish virgins, I'll
[31:53] close with this. The foolish virgins
[31:55] presume two
[31:57] things. One, they presume that the oil
[32:02] that they had was enough.
[32:05] So they didn't see the need to pray like
[32:08] tonight to get some extra
[32:11] oil. They didn't see that need. And two,
[32:15] they presume they still had time to
[32:19] buy. So when the wise told them, "Go to
[32:22] them that sell," they
[32:25] went. They actually went. They actually
[32:29] thought shop was going to be open only
[32:32] to realize shop
[32:34] closed. No oil for sale. You can have
[32:38] oil in the shop but the shop is closed.
[32:39] Who go selling the oil? Go to them that
[32:44] sell. The foolish virgins in this
[32:47] message. I'm not talking about outside
[32:48] the message. In this message one day
[32:51] they're going to wake up and
[32:53] recognize they have word. They have
[32:57] lamp but they don't have
[33:00] oil. They have light. They have the lamp
[33:03] profession confession but they don't
[33:05] have oil. The foolish version had oil
[33:09] you know but the oil ran out. Friends,
[33:13] let's not take things for granted. There
[33:16] are some people I'm not like that. I try
[33:18] not to be like that. They like to have
[33:21] the gas meter close to E.
[33:26] My thinking is this. If some emergency
[33:29] come and you have a little gas in your
[33:32] car, how you're going to make that trip
[33:36] if an emergency come, I like to know
[33:39] that my tank is full whether or not
[33:42] you're going anywhere because I tell
[33:44] myself is better you're full and you're
[33:47] ready then you're close to empty and
[33:50] you're looking for the gas station. Now
[33:52] the gas station might be open but
[33:53] current might gone. If the current gone,
[33:56] they can't pump no gas. So the gas
[33:58] station is open but current just go. You
[34:01] still can't get the gas. So let's gas up
[34:04] tonight. Don't presume anything. Let's
[34:07] get some extra oil tonight. Israel
[34:10] presume that because God historically
[34:13] was with them, they could go up and
[34:14] fight. Moses tell them,
[34:16] "No, you cannot go up and fight nothing.
[34:19] You will get licks." And you know what
[34:21] the Bible said? Licks. They got licks.
[34:23] They get blows because they was off
[34:26] track. So God, help us tonight to get
[34:29] back on track. Search your own heart.
[34:31] Search your own self. Don't get into
[34:34] arrogance. Don't get into the message
[34:36] pride. And most of all, the entitlement
[34:38] that I see ever so often of people who
[34:42] think that because they believe this
[34:44] message, God entitled them some kind of
[34:46] thing. I don't know what they feel
[34:47] entitled to. But to me, you're entitled
[34:50] to die out. You're entitled to press.
[34:53] You're entitled to overcome. You're
[34:55] entitled to sweat it out. When they
[34:57] wanted wanted to when they wanted
[34:59] Clarence, when they wanted water and and
[35:01] and the prophet came down, he said,
[35:03] "Dig." He say just just sprinkle
[35:06] something, you know, dig. Get your fork
[35:08] and dig. You want to get water one inch,
[35:12] you dig one in. You'll get one inch of
[35:14] water. If you want to get more water
[35:17] than that, you have to dig deeper. And
[35:19] that is what we're here to do tonight.
[35:21] Dig. It's a labor. It's a grind. It's a
[35:25] grit. But if you do it, you'll reap the
[35:28] benefit of it. I put a little note from
[35:30] the pastors just this morning,
[35:32] yesterday, about fasting and how it's
[35:36] something to accompany prayer. How
[35:38] fasting get you more spiritually
[35:40] attuned. It is part of the Christian
[35:42] experience. You cannot tell me you walk
[35:45] in a Christian life and you have no clue
[35:47] what fasting is all about. This is part
[35:49] of the Christian walk in the flesh
[35:52] prophet nothing. You have to get in tune
[35:55] with the spirit some point in time and
[35:57] this is a platform an opportunity that
[35:59] we can get our spirits in tune with the
[36:02] mind of God. Let's bow our heads.
[36:03] Heavenly Father, I thank you tonight for
[36:05] this word and I pray it rock us and
[36:08] shake us tonight. The wise virgin, the
[36:11] foolish virgin in their arrogance, they
[36:14] saw no need to get extra oil. They were
[36:17] comfortable with what they have. They
[36:20] felt satisfied. They felt they had the
[36:22] books, the tapes, and they were good.
[36:24] They could go and take a sleep. But then
[36:26] at midnight, the bright room call came
[36:29] out a meeting. They began to light the
[36:31] lamps only to realize a short little
[36:34] light up and then the lamps went out and
[36:38] they choose to ask the wise virgins,
[36:40] "Share now. Press the share button and
[36:43] share with us. Give us of your oil." And
[36:46] the wise was wise enough to tell them,
[36:49] "Not so, not this time. We only have
[36:52] enough for us and for the journey that's
[36:54] ahead of us. Go and buy." Father, what
[36:58] words to hear, go and buy. May we buy
[37:01] tonight. May we pay the price tonight.
[37:04] May we presume nothing tonight, but
[37:06] believe that this word is from you and
[37:09] this word is to be enrw written in our
[37:12] hearts that we will believe that you
[37:15] could confirm and bring assurance in our
[37:17] hearts as to what you want us to do,
[37:20] what you want us not to do, where you
[37:22] want us to go, how you want us to
[37:24] operate. Bless your people tonight.
[37:27] Bless the elders, the deacons, the
[37:29] ushers. Bless the leoty. Father, bless
[37:31] the song leaders, the equipment, the
[37:33] musicians. Bless from the pulpit to the
[37:35] backbench, all the helps, all the
[37:38] support around the church. Bless the
[37:39] upcoming meetings we're going to have in
[37:41] July. Father, may your hand extend.
[37:43] Lord, you promise a five ministry that
[37:46] would step forward, an international
[37:48] ministry that would minister to the
[37:50] bride body around the world. It will be
[37:53] the ministry of Jesus Christ. Oh God,
[37:55] step forward in this hour, Lord, and
[37:57] confirm your word with signs and
[37:58] wonders. Even tonight, I pray the
[38:00] anointing will break forth in homes, in
[38:03] hearts, in lives. Lord, may it
[38:05] accomplish healing, restoration, touch
[38:07] minds tonight. Touch hearts tonight.
[38:10] Touch spirits tonight. Touch the soul of
[38:12] people tonight that they'll be stirred
[38:14] up in spirit just as you stirred up the
[38:16] spirit of the people to restore the wall
[38:18] of Jerusalem. Just as you stirred up the
[38:20] people's spirit to build the temple. Oh
[38:22] God, stir our spirits tonight, knowing
[38:25] that there's a temple to be built, this
[38:26] statue of a perfect man. Oh God, bring a
[38:29] revival in our souls, in our hearts.
[38:31] Many are tired and weary. Many have long
[38:33] been in a vineyard, but give them
[38:35] strength, Lord. Even strength in the
[38:37] inner man tonight that Lord, we know
[38:39] that this walk and this journey has not
[38:41] been in vain. It's a privilege and an
[38:43] honor. Like I will say sometime, I wake
[38:45] up, I say, I thank you, Jesus. I have
[38:48] activity in my limbs. There are people
[38:49] who don't have that, Lord. But we have
[38:51] it, Lord. Even though there may be aches
[38:53] and pains, but we have activity in our
[38:55] limbs that we can give you praise and
[38:57] honor and glory. Father, once more, I
[38:59] ask that your healing virtue would go
[39:01] out to those that are sick. Lord, those
[39:03] that are weary, those that need
[39:05] encouragement, go out to them and
[39:06] minister to them and meet their need
[39:08] right where they are. May the pillar of
[39:10] fire sweep into their homes just like I
[39:13] told the prophet, I will meet you in
[39:15] there. Oh God, meet them where they are
[39:17] tonight. I commit them into your hands.
[39:19] I come at this time I pray into your
[39:21] hands in Jesus name I ask it. Amen and
[39:23] amen. Praise the Lord. So I trust
[39:24] tonight that the few words that were
[39:26] shared would be edified and strengthened
[39:29] to you. We cannot presume anything you
[39:32] know and and with that mindset you know
[39:35] you could press on. You could press on
[39:37] to believe God will come down and bless
[39:39] you because you to start right at the
[39:42] base not presuming nothing. You know Ram
[39:44] said this. He said that um the early
[39:46] church had so much of God and they acted
[39:50] and prayed as if they didn't have much.
[39:52] They keep praying for more and more. He
[39:54] said this last church don't have nothing
[39:57] much like what the early church has and
[39:58] they're not in that spirit atmosphere.
[40:01] We want to be hungry,
[40:04] thirsty like David said as the heart p
[40:07] after the book. This is the spirit
[40:09] atmosphere we want to be in. God bless
[40:10] you as we get on in prayer. Amen. Praise
[40:13] the Lord.

[1:34:02] Blessed be the name of the
[1:34:04] Lord. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:34:09] Hosanna, hosana, hosana. Blessed be the
[1:34:12] name of the Lord. Father, we praise you
[1:34:14] tonight, Father. We thank you tonight.
[1:34:16] We thank you for your presence. We thank
[1:34:18] you for your goodness. We thank you for
[1:34:19] your grace. We thank you for your
[1:34:21] blessing, Father. We thank you for the
[1:34:22] anointing that breaks yoke. We thank you
[1:34:25] for your people, Father God, that you
[1:34:27] have placed faith in them. You have
[1:34:28] placed your word in them. You have
[1:34:30] placed your presence in them. Oh God,
[1:34:32] freshly anoint us, Lord, from the crown
[1:34:34] of our head to the soul of our feet. But
[1:34:36] we thank you, Father. that we not just
[1:34:38] look around and oh God see blessings
[1:34:40] around us. Father, when we look to your
[1:34:42] word where we could look at our own
[1:34:44] desires to see if we have that passion
[1:34:46] to know the word, if we have that cry to
[1:34:48] get in the spirit and if we have that
[1:34:50] fervent desire to please you, oh God,
[1:34:52] may this be a moto, Lord. May this be a
[1:34:54] team. May this be a template for us,
[1:34:56] Lord, a passion to know your word, a cry
[1:34:59] to get in the spirit and a fervent
[1:35:01] desire to please you, to please you
[1:35:02] above everything else. to put you first,
[1:35:04] Lord, to seek first the kingdom. Oh God,
[1:35:07] help your people tonight. Bless the
[1:35:09] services coming Sunday. May the
[1:35:10] anointing roar through the church,
[1:35:12] Father. May there be a blast of the Holy
[1:35:14] Spirit. May you ride a trail once more
[1:35:16] with healing in your wings. God, may we
[1:35:19] see the restoration of every gift back
[1:35:21] in the church. Oh God, not just talking
[1:35:23] about a five-fold ministry, but every
[1:35:25] gift, healing, discernment, tongues,
[1:35:28] interpretation of tongues, prophecy,
[1:35:29] every gift to be back in the church.
[1:35:31] Repair our hearts, Lord. Sanctify us,
[1:35:33] Lord. Give us a wave of holiness, a wave
[1:35:35] of purity, a wave of a undefiled life,
[1:35:38] walking around without a blemish, oh
[1:35:40] God. Set the church in order. Set our
[1:35:42] hearts are right. Lord, set us on focus
[1:35:44] and we didn't presume anything, but we
[1:35:46] will wait upon you. You said in your
[1:35:48] word that the church couldn't wait. Eve
[1:35:51] couldn't wait. The church don't want to
[1:35:53] wait for the real Holy Spirit to come
[1:35:55] into the church to work and to perform
[1:35:57] and to do. Oh God, help us, Father, that
[1:36:00] we wouldn't jerk below. We wouldn't run
[1:36:02] ahead, but we will truly wait upon you,
[1:36:04] Father. Even as they promise they wait,
[1:36:06] shall we their strength. May each one
[1:36:08] here tonight be empowered. May each one
[1:36:10] here tonight be strengthened. Strengthen
[1:36:12] me in a man. Strengthen for the rest of
[1:36:14] the journey, Father. May they feast on
[1:36:16] the word of God. May they feast on the
[1:36:18] unfailing body word of the son of man
[1:36:20] that they could have the strength to
[1:36:22] press on in this journey. Father,
[1:36:23] through trials, through testing, through
[1:36:24] tribulation, through dark hour. Oh God,
[1:36:27] help us tonight. Bless bless your people
[1:36:29] tonight. Bless your children tonight.
[1:36:30] Bless the upcoming convention tonight.
[1:36:32] May your presence be dear and with the
[1:36:34] ministers, with the greeters, with the
[1:36:36] songs, with the worship, with
[1:36:37] everything, Father, that it will bring,
[1:36:39] as Binian preach on Wednesday night,
[1:36:41] glory to you, Father. It will be for
[1:36:43] your honor. It will be for your glory,
[1:36:44] Father. Our lives will be for your honor
[1:36:46] and for your glory. This is how we
[1:36:48] should live. This is how we must live to
[1:36:50] live for your honor and your glory. We
[1:36:52] commit our lives into your hands, your
[1:36:54] people into your hands in Jesus name.
[1:36:56] Amen. And amen. God bless your saints.
[1:36:58] We are so blessed to be here tonight and
[1:37:01] I pray that you get a charge. That is
[1:37:03] what we come to hook up tonight for. To
[1:37:06] get a fresh charge of this Holy Ghost
[1:37:08] power. God bless you. We dismissed.
[1:37:10] Praise the Lord.
