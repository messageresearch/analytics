[25:08] to be here.
[25:10] Amen. Thank God for his grace. Let's
[25:13] turn to our Bibles. We'd like to read a
[25:17] portion of scripture from the Psalms.
[25:19] Psalms
[25:20] chapter 146 for scripture
[25:24] reading this
[25:27] afternoon.
[25:31] Amen. All right. Can you give me hosana
[25:34] in the highest? Amen. Let the king be
[25:37] lifted up. Amen. Psalms chapter
[25:41] 146 says, "Praise ye the Lord. Praise
[25:45] the Lord, oh my soul. While I live will
[25:50] I praise the Lord. I will sing praises
[25:53] unto my God while I have any being. Put
[25:58] not your trust in princes, nor in the
[26:01] Son of Man in whom there is no help. His
[26:04] breath goeth forth. He returnneth to his
[26:07] earth, and in that very day his thoughts
[26:11] perish. Happy is he that had the God of
[26:14] Jacob, for his help, whose hope is in
[26:18] the Lord his God, which made heaven and
[26:21] earth, uh, which made heaven and earth,
[26:23] the sea, and all that therein is, which
[26:26] keepeth truth forever, which execututeth
[26:30] judgment for the oppressed, which giveth
[26:32] food to the hungry. The Lord looth the
[26:36] prisoners. The Lord openeth the eyes of
[26:38] the blind. The Lord raisth them that are
[26:42] bowed down. The Lord loveth the
[26:44] righteous. The Lord preserveth the
[26:47] stranger. He relieveth the fatherless
[26:49] and widow. But the way of the wicked he
[26:52] turneth upside down. The Lord shall
[26:55] reign forever. Even thy God, O Zion,
[26:58] unto all
[27:00] generations. Praise ye the Lord.
[27:02] Hallelujah. Let us give him praise in
[27:04] his house this evening. Praise ye the
[27:08] Lord unto all generations. His name is
[27:12] worthy to be praised, worthy to be
[27:14] glorified, worthy to be lifted up. Oh,
[27:17] hallelujah. He comes when you invite him
[27:19] in. Let us invite him in this evening.
[27:23] Oh, hallelujah. In the house of our God.
[27:25] Amen. As we get ready to pray. Almighty
[27:29] God, we thank you, Lord, to be in your
[27:31] presence. Father, we thank you to be in
[27:33] this place, Lord. You have made for us
[27:36] to come and worship you, Father. Lord,

[27:56] death, your burial, and your
[27:58] resurrection there, God. Father, we
[28:00] remember the price that was paid when we
[28:03] remember redemption's song this evening.
[28:07] Father, Lord, we come to lift up a
[28:09] banner of praise this afternoon. A
[28:12] praise that is due unto your name, a
[28:15] praise that is due unto the King of
[28:17] Kings who purchased our
[28:20] salvation on Calvar's tree this evening.
[28:23] We come to give you all the glory. We
[28:25] pray that you would come and have your
[28:26] way with us this evening. Cleanse us
[28:29] with your blood, Lord. Father, the
[28:31] precious blood that h flowed from
[28:34] Emmanuel's veins tonight. That blood is
[28:37] still powerful tonight, just as strong
[28:40] as it ever was. Lord, to break the bands
[28:43] of sin upon us. Grant it, almighty God.
[28:46] May you work upon the people, Father.
[28:48] Work in our lives, oh God, as we
[28:51] surrender to you tonight, tomorrow and
[28:54] Sunday. Lord, we commit this old time
[28:56] into your into your presence. Lord, we
[28:58] pray that you'd have your way with us.
[28:59] Lord, anoint us and inspire us, Father,
[29:02] this evening for service. Bless the word
[29:04] as it will come forth. Bless your
[29:06] servant as he heal himself to be used
[29:09] mightily of you to speak your word only.
[29:12] Oh God, Father, may it flash like
[29:14] lightning, dear God. May the anointing
[29:16] of God blow, may it surround the word
[29:19] and bring it to life. Minister to the
[29:21] hearts here tonight, Lord, and ears of
[29:24] salvation. And we be careful to give you
[29:26] all the praise, honor, and glory. We
[29:27] commit the service into your hands in
[29:29] Jesus Christ's precious name we pray and
[29:31] ask it. Amen and amen. Praise God. Amen.
[29:35] Hallelujah. Glory to you. Glory to God.
[29:39] Do you love him tonight? You thank God
[29:41] for his presence. Why don't you close
[29:42] your eyes and lift your hands right
[29:44] where you are? Just begin to worship him
[29:45] right now. Just begin to praise him. Oh,

[48:04] [Music]
[48:06] crucified. You laid behind the stone.
[48:12] You
[48:13] left to
[48:15] die. Rejected and alone like a
[48:22] rose trampled on the ground.
[48:27] [Music]
[48:28] You took the
[48:31] fall and thought of
[48:36] me above
[48:38] [Applause]
[48:41] all.
[48:43] [Music]
[48:45] Crucify, live behind the
[48:49] stone. You're
[48:51] left to die.
[48:55] rejected and
[48:57] alone like a
[49:01] rose trampled on the
[49:05] ground. You took the
[49:10] fall and thought of
[49:14] me above all.
[49:20] Like a
[49:22] rose trampled on the
[49:27] ground. You took the
[49:32] fall and thought of
[49:37] me
[49:39] above all.
[49:42] [Music]
[49:56] [Applause]
[49:56] [Music]
[50:00] Oh,
[50:01] hallelujah. Like a rose.
[50:05] Oh, trampled on the ground. Oh, do you
[50:08] appreciate that this evening? Amen.
[50:10] Appreciate brother Lynon Williams.
[50:13] Hallelujah.

[50:19] hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[50:21] Hallelujah. He's above all. Praise God.
[50:24] Hallelujah. Above all powers, above all
[50:26] thrones. Oh, hallelujah. Above all your
[50:29] troubles, above all your worries, above
[50:31] all your trials, above all what you're
[50:33] going through, above all sickness. He's
[50:35] above all that. The God we worship
[50:37] tonight is above all that. He's above
[50:40] everything in your mind. He's above your
[50:42] depression. He's above your frustration.
[50:44] He's above your disease. There's no
[50:46] sickness he hasn't conquered. He
[50:48] conquered death. He conquered hell. He
[50:51] conquered the grave. And he's above it
[50:53] all today. He sits high and exalted
[50:57] above every principality, above every
[51:00] power, above every spiritual wickedness.
[51:03] He is above it tonight. Somebody shout,
[51:06] "Amen." Somebody give him praise. The
[51:08] devil is on the run tonight because he
[51:11] is above it all. Somebody give the Lord
[51:13] a shout. Hallelujah. Our God is
[51:17] victorious. Oh, hallelujah. He's a
[51:19] champion and he sits above it all
[51:21] tonight. Oh, victorious is our God. Turn
[51:25] around, greet your brother. Turn around,
[51:27] greet your sister. Oh, hallelujah. Tell
[51:29] him that you love them in Jesus name.

[52:55] him. Oh, hallelujah. We are together

[55:18] and preach to us this evening. So, let's
[55:19] get ready to hear the word of God. Amen.
[55:21] As we get our hearts under expectation.
[55:24] Oh, hallelujah. God will speak to us as
[55:26] he comes to the platform. May the Lord
[55:28] bless you. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.

[56:27] Oh,
[56:28] hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the
[56:31] Lord. Oh,
[56:36] hallelujah. Thank you,
[56:38] Jesus. Thank you, lamb of God. You love
[56:42] him this evening. You're excited this
[56:45] evening. They came under expectation
[56:48] this evening. Let me start by saying
[56:51] welcome. Welcome to our Easter
[56:53] convention.
[56:54] Amen. Are you happy to be
[56:58] here? I I'm I'm not sure why you
[57:01] [Music]
[57:02] came. I'm not sure what your
[57:04] expectations might be tonight. I I don't
[57:07] even know your needs tonight. But
[57:09] there's one thing I'm sure of that he is
[57:12] here to meet your needs. He is here to
[57:15] deliver. He is here to set the captives
[57:18] free. He is here to bring you out. He is
[57:22] here to turn you around and set your
[57:24] feet on solid ground. You believe that?
[57:28] Thank you, Jesus. Let's give the Lord a
[57:30] hand of
[57:32] praise. Amen. Amen. Amen. I know he's
[57:36] fixing to move tonight. I know you're
[57:39] not going to leave the same way you
[57:40] came. I know something is going to
[57:43] happen. You're either going to leave
[57:45] here better or you're going to leave
[57:47] here worse, but something is going to
[57:50] happen. What a mighty God we serve.
[57:53] Amen. My my my sure feels good in here.
[57:57] You appreciate the singing, the worship,
[58:00] the musicians. God bless you, brother
[58:01] Lyndon. What a beautiful song. Really
[58:05] appreciate
[58:07] that. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[58:13] You may have your
[58:16] seats. I wasn't joking earlier when I
[58:19] said I I'm not sure your motivation for
[58:21] coming
[58:22] today. Perhaps somebody invited you or
[58:25] you thought it's a good idea to come to
[58:27] Easter service cuz Easter is so integral
[58:32] in the Christian calendar. It may have
[58:34] sounded like a good idea, but I want to
[58:36] tell you that that I don't think it was
[58:38] your idea in the first place. Amen. I
[58:41] think before the foundation of the
[58:42] earth, God set an appointment with you
[58:44] today. You couldn't miss this if you
[58:46] tried. You couldn't miss this. If you
[58:49] had another appointment, there was some
[58:52] emergency. Perhaps something went on.
[58:54] You still had to be here. Even if you're
[58:57] not here in person, you had to be
[58:58] connected online. You had to be
[59:01] connected today because something is
[59:03] going to happen and something is
[59:05] predestinated to happen for you. that
[59:08] was that was calendared and panned
[59:11] before the foundation of the earth.
[59:13] Before there was a moon or a star, you
[59:16] were in the mind of Christ to be here in
[59:18] this hour. He saved his time for
[59:20] soldiers like you. He saved the trials
[59:23] for people like you. He saved the test
[59:26] for persons like you because he know you
[59:29] could handle it. He know you have what
[59:31] it takes to make it in this hour. You
[59:34] know you have what it takes to go all
[59:36] the way to go from faith, virtue,
[59:40] knowledge, temperance, patience,
[59:43] godliness, and charity could drop down.
[59:46] He know you had it in you. You had the
[59:49] attributes to become the sons and
[59:52] daughter of God, manifesting the life of
[59:55] Christ, walking on two feet in this
[59:57] hour. Amen.
[1:00:01] You may have your seats.
[1:00:04] [Music]
[1:00:12] My Lord, you love him.
[1:00:15] [Music]
[1:00:17] You see, one of my favorite scriptures
[1:00:19] is Romans 8. Amen. 28. Anybody who knows
[1:00:21] me will say, I I say that all the time.
[1:00:24] Romans 8:28. One of my favorite
[1:00:26] scriptures.
[1:00:28] And it says, "And we know that all
[1:00:29] things, not not some,
[1:00:32] Not not only on a Sunday or perhaps when
[1:00:35] I have money or when I'm feeling good.
[1:00:37] All things
[1:00:39] work together for good to them that love
[1:00:43] God to them who are called according to
[1:00:47] his purpose.
[1:00:49] For whom he did forno which is knowing
[1:00:52] beforehand.
[1:00:56] He also did predestinate
[1:00:59] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:01:02] that h that he might be the firstborn
[1:01:05] among many brethren. Moreover, whom he
[1:01:08] did
[1:01:09] predestinate them he also called and
[1:01:12] whom he called them he also justified.
[1:01:15] Whom he justified them he also
[1:01:18] glorified.
[1:01:19] So I believe he is not now calling you.
[1:01:23] He didn't invite you to a service
[1:01:24] tonight. He had it in his mind that you
[1:01:27] would be here in this hour and you would
[1:01:30] do whatever it took to be where you are
[1:01:33] right
[1:01:34] now. It isn't by
[1:01:36] chance. It isn't by mistake. An accident
[1:01:40] couldn't keep you back. He couldn't kill
[1:01:43] you if he tried. They might have ordered
[1:01:45] a hit against you, but they would fail
[1:01:48] because you had to be hit
[1:01:50] tonight. He had something special in
[1:01:53] store for you tonight.
[1:02:01] I I I don't know about you, but I come
[1:02:03] on the expectation for the miraculous to
[1:02:05] take place. I believe that something
[1:02:09] significant is going to take place
[1:02:11] tonight. Something special is going to
[1:02:14] happen tonight.
[1:02:16] Today, we're going to have a time with
[1:02:18] the Lord. We're going to fellowship
[1:02:20] around his word. He's going to draw near
[1:02:24] and he's going to change you. He's going
[1:02:27] to sort you out. He's going to heal you.
[1:02:30] He's going to deliver. He's going to
[1:02:32] restore you and bring you
[1:02:35] back. Amen. Amen. Amen. You may have
[1:02:39] your
[1:02:39] [Music]
[1:02:41] seats right now. I'm I'm just in the
[1:02:43] purpose of of greeting you.
[1:02:46] So, I want to wish you Easter greetings.
[1:02:49] wish you a happy Easter and the
[1:02:51] blessings of Easter. I hope you have a
[1:02:53] great weekend and I know you definitely
[1:02:55] will. On behalf of my wife and family, I
[1:02:58] want to thank the ministry for the
[1:03:00] opportunity to be able to speak to this
[1:03:02] portion of the bride of Christ in Trinad
[1:03:05] and and those that may be connected on
[1:03:07] the internet. God bless you.
[1:03:10] What a time for the bride. What a time.
[1:03:14] What a hour we live in.
[1:03:16] It's not an easy hour. It's a rough
[1:03:19] time, but we build for this time.
[1:03:23] We've been trained for this time. You
[1:03:25] know, I I was I was studying and
[1:03:27] wondering, you know, when you have a
[1:03:29] surgeon, whatever level of
[1:03:31] specialization or or maybe in the dental
[1:03:34] field or or whatever specialization
[1:03:37] you're in, often times we hear about the
[1:03:40] victory. We hear they completed this
[1:03:42] successfully. We hear that they took 2
[1:03:46] hours or 1 hour and they did something
[1:03:47] for the first time and they didn't think
[1:03:49] it were possible. That's the part we
[1:03:51] like. What we don't see is the 30 years
[1:03:54] of research and study. We don't see the
[1:03:56] 10 years of schooling before you're able
[1:03:59] to become proficient before we could
[1:04:01] trust you and know that you have the
[1:04:02] experience. That's how I feel tonight. I
[1:04:05] feel like some some of us has been in
[1:04:07] the vineyard for 30 years. Some for 50,
[1:04:09] some for 40, some for 10, some for two.
[1:04:14] Same pay.
[1:04:17] Same pay.
[1:04:19] It doesn't matter. You see, once you
[1:04:21] have what it takes, once you learn the
[1:04:23] lessons, the teachers and governors will
[1:04:26] pass you. You will get the same reward.
[1:04:30] Same pay.
[1:04:32] The sacrifice might have been longer for
[1:04:34] you, but the outcome is the same. Think
[1:04:36] think about the children of Israel. Some
[1:04:39] may have been in bondage for their
[1:04:42] entire life. They heard God will send a
[1:04:46] deliverer. They heard that at some point
[1:04:48] we'll be set free and the taskmaster
[1:04:50] will no longer be the taskmaster. He'll
[1:04:52] be the former taskmaster. Pharaoh would
[1:04:54] be a thought of the past. And they may
[1:04:57] have died. And generations after them,
[1:05:00] two, three, four, five generations after
[1:05:02] them would have heard the same thing and
[1:05:04] died. But there came a time like today
[1:05:08] in which all the things that you heard,
[1:05:11] all the things that you believed, all
[1:05:12] the things that your great-grandmother
[1:05:14] would have handed down and passed
[1:05:15] through and you came to a point in which
[1:05:18] the season had changed. At that point,
[1:05:21] it didn't matter that I was in bondage
[1:05:23] for 50 years.
[1:05:26] The time of deliverance was at hand. And
[1:05:29] that was the only thing that mattered.
[1:05:31] Amen. It didn't matter what your father,
[1:05:33] your grandfather, your grandmother, your
[1:05:35] uncle who left church who say, "Boy, you
[1:05:37] know how long I holding on?" It didn't
[1:05:39] matter at that point cuz at that point,
[1:05:41] the season had changed. It was time for
[1:05:44] action. And tonight, I believe it's time
[1:05:46] for action. For too long, Christians
[1:05:49] have sat down and Easter in, Easter out,
[1:05:52] Christmas in, Christmas out, day in day
[1:05:54] out. And it's the same thing over and
[1:05:55] over. But in
[1:05:57] 2025, I don't think it's is is normal
[1:06:00] operations anymore. I don't think we can
[1:06:03] afford when we look around us and we see
[1:06:05] the time in which we living in, I don't
[1:06:08] think we could sit at ease in Zion, I
[1:06:10] think we have to cause something to
[1:06:12] happen and watch the Holy Spirit take
[1:06:15] over and watch him move through the camp
[1:06:19] and do what he is specialized in doing.
[1:06:21] You may have waited a long time, but I
[1:06:24] think we at a crossroads right now. I
[1:06:26] think we at a season when something
[1:06:28] significant is about to happen and
[1:06:31] you're going to witness it.
[1:06:36] [Applause]
[1:06:40] When you think about the cost and the
[1:06:42] pain and the sacrifice that brothers and
[1:06:44] sisters have gone through for you to be
[1:06:46] here in this hour, it wasn't easy, you
[1:06:48] know.
[1:06:52] When you think about the heartaches and
[1:06:54] the pains and the struggles and the
[1:06:56] fights
[1:06:59] and the agony, the sleepless nights and
[1:07:01] the cries and the tears and what they
[1:07:03] went through to see you through to this
[1:07:05] hour. It wasn't easy.
[1:07:09] But you know what? It was all for a
[1:07:12] purpose.
[1:07:13] It was for you to come to a point that
[1:07:15] you could worship the father in spirit
[1:07:16] and in truth.
[1:07:18] And he could be so pleased that he could
[1:07:20] say, "There is my spirit flowing
[1:07:22] freely."
[1:07:23] That he could look at sons of and
[1:07:25] daughters of God moving around and say,
[1:07:27] "Hey, I'm proud." Chip off the old
[1:07:30] block.
[1:07:32] Amen.
[1:07:34] That's who we are. A reflection of
[1:07:36] Christ.
[1:07:38] And Easter is a such an interesting time
[1:07:41] in the Christian calendar. Is a time
[1:07:43] when everybody want to be in church.
[1:07:46] Everybody want to identify with the
[1:07:48] group.
[1:07:50] Don't mind me, you know. I'm just
[1:07:52] getting comfortable.
[1:07:54] I'm just getting
[1:07:56] started. I'm not a long speaker. So, I'm
[1:07:59] just making sure that everything is
[1:08:00] ready. So, once we start, there's no
[1:08:04] turning back. Amen.
[1:08:06] I'm just making sure your worship is on
[1:08:08] point
[1:08:10] and you're not
[1:08:11] distracted. that on this time I want to
[1:08:14] make sure the banks are closed so you
[1:08:16] can't pay that loan that you didn't pay
[1:08:17] yet. I want to make sure that they
[1:08:20] wouldn't answer your calls. I want to
[1:08:23] make sure that you could just focus on
[1:08:24] him just for a couple moments. Cuz if
[1:08:27] you could do that, brother Brandham say
[1:08:29] in five
[1:08:31] minutes, there wouldn't be a person sick
[1:08:34] that stepped in sick that leaves sick.
[1:08:38] If if you could just believe for a few
[1:08:40] moments
[1:08:42] that nothing else matters,
[1:08:45] he is above all sovereign by himself and
[1:08:48] he's going to do something listen
[1:08:49] exceedingly and abundantly above what
[1:08:51] you could ask or think right now. Just
[1:08:54] for a few moments, you could forget what
[1:08:56] happened yesterday and the accident and
[1:08:59] the challenges and what you think
[1:09:01] happening tomorrow. Just for a moment.
[1:09:04] Just forget that for a moment because
[1:09:05] nothing could you could do right now,
[1:09:08] nothing you worry about now would change
[1:09:10] the outcome. But you know what? The God
[1:09:12] I serve is bigger than your problems.
[1:09:16] And he can deliver just like he did to
[1:09:19] the children of Israel tonight.
[1:09:23] Hallelujah.
[1:09:25] Let's just stand as we read the
[1:09:27] scripture. Thank you, musicians.
[1:09:31] Hallelujah.
[1:09:35] And the scripture is so short. I want to
[1:09:37] make sure everybody gets it. I want you
[1:09:39] to turn to the book of St.
[1:09:42] John chapter 3 and verse
[1:09:46] 16. And I want you to read it with me.
[1:09:50] At least follow with me. Every child
[1:09:53] from Sunday school should know this.
[1:09:55] Every adult should know this. It's a
[1:09:57] simple scripture, but that's what I'm
[1:09:59] going to use as a context scripture.
[1:10:06] For God so loved the world that he gave
[1:10:09] his only begotten son that whosoever
[1:10:12] believeth in him should not perish but
[1:10:15] have everlasting life.
[1:10:18] Amen. Let's just bow our heads for a
[1:10:20] word of prayer.
[1:10:23] Oh heavenly father, we come before you
[1:10:25] this evening, Lord. Lord, full of
[1:10:28] expectation, Lord. Full of faith, Lord,
[1:10:31] Lord, we believe what we've said. We
[1:10:34] believe your word. We believe your
[1:10:36] promise, Lord. We believe in this hour
[1:10:38] is a special hour, Lord. And no matter
[1:10:41] what anybody else has to say and think
[1:10:45] and feel, Lord, we believe that
[1:10:47] miraculous is going to take place. We
[1:10:49] believe that there's no one that's going
[1:10:52] to be sick in this place that doesn't
[1:10:54] have to leave here sick. Lord, Lord, by
[1:10:57] your power, Lord, you said healing is
[1:10:59] your children's bread, Lord. Lord, by
[1:11:02] your anointing, Lord, we pray that you
[1:11:04] will fill all the house, Lord. Those
[1:11:05] that are upstairs and downstairs, those
[1:11:07] that are connected on the internet right
[1:11:09] now, Lord, I pray that your spirit will
[1:11:11] flow out to them, Lord. Lord, that you
[1:11:14] will grant mercy on those that need
[1:11:16] mercy. that you'll grant healing to
[1:11:18] those that maybe may may be a little
[1:11:20] downtrodden and need need a little boost
[1:11:22] tonight, Lord. That you will restore
[1:11:23] them, Lord. Lord, I pray that you will
[1:11:26] quicken the hearts of those that that
[1:11:28] come together to rejoice and to worship
[1:11:30] and praise, Lord. Lord, I pray that we
[1:11:32] we be part of that bunch at causing
[1:11:34] something to happen that a revival will
[1:11:36] break out in the homes, Lord, wherever
[1:11:39] we go, Lord, in our hearts, Lord, that
[1:11:41] we could be more sincere, Lord, and
[1:11:43] surrender ourselves to you, Lord. that
[1:11:45] we could get rid of everything else that
[1:11:46] may be distracting, Lord. Lord, that we
[1:11:48] could focus on you and fellowship around
[1:11:51] your word and your promises, Lord. Lord,
[1:11:53] I read your scripture and any man could
[1:11:55] read, Lord, but I pray that you breathe
[1:11:57] life into it. Take me out of the way. I
[1:11:59] pray that you put together these few
[1:12:01] words, these broken up words I have
[1:12:03] here, that you will surge them together,
[1:12:05] merge them together, get them in such a
[1:12:07] palatable way that your people could
[1:12:10] find good ground in their hearts for it
[1:12:12] to to to to to find a bedding ground,
[1:12:14] Lord, that it could dwell, Lord, and you
[1:12:16] could see a manifestation of your word
[1:12:18] in their lives, Lord. Lord, speak
[1:12:21] through me and speak to your people
[1:12:22] tonight, Lord. Lord, this is just the
[1:12:25] beginning. I pray that every day will be
[1:12:26] greater and greater Lord. In Jesus name
[1:12:29] we want to give you all the praise, all
[1:12:31] the honor, all the glory. Jesus name we
[1:12:34] pray. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:12:39] Amen.
[1:12:42] Blessed be the name of the Lord. I don't
[1:12:44] have to tell you tonight, but he
[1:12:46] inhabits your praise. He lives. He
[1:12:49] dwells. He moves among the praises of
[1:12:51] his people. And when you worship him,
[1:12:54] you create such an atmosphere that that
[1:12:56] I may have to share the words I have
[1:12:58] here that he could guide and he will
[1:13:00] direct and only say what he once said.
[1:13:04] Amen.
[1:13:06] For a title this evening, the value of
[1:13:09] your life.
[1:13:11] And for inspiration, the love of God.
[1:13:13] You may have your seats.
[1:13:15] The love of God.
[1:13:18] I hope you appreciate the service last
[1:13:20] Sunday, brother Olu. What a powerful
[1:13:23] service we had.
[1:13:27] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:13:32] And when you
[1:13:35] look when you look
[1:13:37] around and examine the scriptures, the
[1:13:40] Bible is really a love story. Easter is
[1:13:42] about love.
[1:13:44] That that song was a love song. And
[1:13:47] always depends on your perspective. You
[1:13:48] know, they say when you look, what do
[1:13:50] you see? It's love. When you think about
[1:13:53] that scripture we just read, you know,
[1:13:55] it says, "For God so loved the world."
[1:13:58] He gave his only begotten son. Now,
[1:14:01] there are times when you could love, but
[1:14:04] you're not willing to give. You're not
[1:14:06] willing to sacrifice because you don't
[1:14:08] love enough.
[1:14:10] You love, you know, but nah, I'm not
[1:14:14] giving you one of my kidneys
[1:14:15] because cool. I love you and know I
[1:14:18] appreciate you, but I don't love you
[1:14:20] enough. And God proved he was willing to
[1:14:24] back up his talk with action. It wasn't
[1:14:27] a talking love. This love was a action
[1:14:30] kind of love. It was a love with meaning
[1:14:33] behind it, with substance behind it. So
[1:14:36] he could see this love and a
[1:14:39] manifestation of the expression of love.
[1:14:40] When he said, "Here what you see my only
[1:14:43] son. It's not that I have 20 and I I
[1:14:45] will give one and know because you see
[1:14:47] he's the middle child and kind of
[1:14:49] problematic already so I'll sacrif
[1:14:54] and say listen this one is the one that
[1:14:57] I have chosen for special
[1:15:00] mission you know it reminded me of
[1:15:04] Abraham Abraham waited 25 years for this
[1:15:07] son and then God came and said sacrifice
[1:15:10] him
[1:15:11] sacrifice you see that's the ultimate
[1:15:14] sacrifice. After you waited, after you
[1:15:17] watched, after you prepped, you could
[1:15:19] imagine the kind of clothes that Isaac
[1:15:22] had, after you wait for 25 years. Come
[1:15:24] on, you had to have the best. You had
[1:15:27] enough time to save, to put together, to
[1:15:30] ensure that everything was perfect and
[1:15:32] just right. And God said, "Listen here,
[1:15:34] watch. You see that child? Sacrifice
[1:15:37] time."
[1:15:38] It took a level of love for God. Amen.
[1:15:43] That Abraham had had a level of faith in
[1:15:46] the word of God to be able to execute
[1:15:49] that with obedience.
[1:15:52] Amen.
[1:15:55] I also want to say when we find things
[1:15:57] of great
[1:15:58] value, we always willing to pay a great
[1:16:00] price for it
[1:16:04] because it's important to us.
[1:16:09] We willing to fight for it to protect
[1:16:13] it because the value and the perception
[1:16:16] of value to us it means a whole lot. So
[1:16:20] we're willing to do whatever it takes to
[1:16:23] get it done. Amen. But on that basis, we
[1:16:27] could also deduce or
[1:16:29] infer that the level of your
[1:16:32] sacrifice is directly related or there's
[1:16:36] a direct correlation between your
[1:16:38] sacrifi your sacrifice and your
[1:16:40] perception of value.
[1:16:42] So I understand when you raise your hand
[1:16:45] halfway so it's because you really not
[1:16:49] believing that God could do what he say.
[1:16:51] I understand that. Amen. You see, when
[1:16:54] your hand down and you allow gravity to
[1:16:56] take over, I understand in your mind
[1:16:59] that you're telling everybody without
[1:17:03] words, I don't believe too much. You
[1:17:05] know, I kind of physically here, but I'm
[1:17:08] not really here. Amen. But you see, when
[1:17:10] you lift your hands and you know you
[1:17:14] don't have $10 in your pocket
[1:17:16] and you could raise your hands and
[1:17:19] glorify God and open up your mouth and
[1:17:23] make it known that he is great and he is
[1:17:27] greatly to be praised and you worship
[1:17:30] him in spite of your circumstance at
[1:17:33] home despite what your neighbor have to
[1:17:36] tell you. And every day they throwing
[1:17:38] the garbage in front your house. And
[1:17:41] every day they upsetting you and the
[1:17:43] boss they give you a bad appraisal for
[1:17:46] nothing. Just so and you know despite
[1:17:48] that. Glory to God. I thank you that I
[1:17:50] have a job. I thank you that I have a
[1:17:53] salary to look forward to. Oh God I
[1:17:56] might be working for Pharaoh but
[1:17:58] deliverance is coming. Healing is
[1:18:02] coming. Healing is coming. My filling is
[1:18:05] coming. My redemption is coming. You
[1:18:08] see, when you start to worship like
[1:18:10] that, everybody around you could tell,
[1:18:12] you put them on notice. Listen, you
[1:18:15] could watch me, but you can't touch me
[1:18:17] like Job. You have to pass me straight.
[1:18:21] I don't mind the devil move to and fro,
[1:18:22] but don't don't stop by me because I am
[1:18:26] not one of them. I am not one of them
[1:18:29] fake Christians. I know who I serve and
[1:18:33] I believe he's the same yesterday,
[1:18:35] today, and forever. So nothing you could
[1:18:38] say could shake me off of this rock of
[1:18:41] revelation that I stand
[1:18:43] on. When you have that kind of
[1:18:46] conviction and that kind of faith, you
[1:18:48] worship because of who he is, not
[1:18:52] because of what he's done for you. You
[1:18:54] worship him because he is God. Not
[1:18:58] because of the job you have. Not because
[1:19:00] of your title or you got a new suit or
[1:19:03] tie or
[1:19:06] [Applause]
[1:19:09] dress. Y'all don't get me excited
[1:19:13] already. My My You may have your seats.
[1:19:16] I want to speak a little bit if you
[1:19:18] permit me about the first
[1:19:20] Easter. Brother Brandham in a in a
[1:19:22] message I know my redeemer liveth
[1:19:24] talking about Job paragraph 7 say here's
[1:19:27] what he said he said Job in his distress
[1:19:30] everything gone his wife had turned
[1:19:33] against him and was accusing him and all
[1:19:36] his believer friends turned against him
[1:19:39] because they only had theology
[1:19:41] and all the rest had turn turned against
[1:19:44] him but God said listen this is the love
[1:19:48] I was talking about God said come here
[1:19:50] Job
[1:19:51] I'm going to give you something, boy.
[1:19:54] I'm going to place within you something
[1:19:56] that all the devils of hell can't shake
[1:19:58] out.
[1:20:02] Every teacher in the world might accuse
[1:20:04] you one way or the other, but it'll
[1:20:06] never move. You know what he did? He
[1:20:08] just raised up the curtain a little, a
[1:20:11] little bit, and said, "Job, look
[1:20:12] yonder." And what did Job see? What do
[1:20:15] you think he saw? He saw Easter for the
[1:20:18] first time. the first Easter.
[1:20:21] He saw the first Easter and he screamed,
[1:20:24] "I know my redeemer liveth." Oh, what a
[1:20:28] blessed place to be. Every man's that's
[1:20:31] chosen of God and every woman and child
[1:20:33] comes to that spot on those sacred sands
[1:20:36] to where God lifts the curtain and you
[1:20:39] see him in his resurrected power. You
[1:20:41] know that he lives and we as Job can
[1:20:44] cry, I know my redeemer liveth. Amen.
[1:20:47] And at the last days he shall stand on
[1:20:49] the earth. Though the skin worms destroy
[1:20:52] this body, yet in my flesh, I shall see
[1:20:58] God. That first view of Easter made a
[1:21:01] prophet scream and the thunders roared
[1:21:05] and the lightnings flash. He saw Easter
[1:21:09] its first time. When did he see it? Not
[1:21:12] when he had his well-groomed clothes on.
[1:21:14] Not when his hair, not when he just came
[1:21:17] out the barber shop. No, no, no, no, no.
[1:21:19] Not when he was enjoying the very best
[1:21:21] of health,
[1:21:23] but when he was in trouble, when he was
[1:21:26] laying in trouble, at the hour and
[1:21:28] almost his death, that's when he saw
[1:21:31] Easter. That's when he first saw
[1:21:33] resurrection.
[1:21:36] When he saw the first resurrection, oh,
[1:21:38] it's been similar to you and I. It's
[1:21:40] been we laid on the altar somewhere
[1:21:42] until we're ready to die and said, "Lord
[1:21:44] God, do something for me tonight, today,
[1:21:49] this evening." It was then that God
[1:21:52] raised the curtain and we seen
[1:21:54] Easter. We see Easter not in a way of
[1:21:57] theology so much. We never seen Easter
[1:22:00] as wearing new clothes. We never seen
[1:22:02] Easter as rabbits and colored eggs. We
[1:22:04] see Isa in the power of resurrection of
[1:22:07] the Lord Jesus Christ. That was the real
[1:22:10] Easter. And when he screamed, God
[1:22:13] answered back with fire. In an hour like
[1:22:15] this, when it seemed that so much
[1:22:18] trouble is on every hand, God could just
[1:22:20] raise the curtain and say, "Look yonder.
[1:22:24] Look yonder. What do you see? I see a
[1:22:27] resurrected Lord and Savior. I could see
[1:22:30] Jesus Christ. He's the same yesterday,
[1:22:33] today, and forever. He could still heal
[1:22:36] today. He could still set free today, he
[1:22:39] could still deliver today.
[1:22:44] Amen. Amen. Amen. But you see, to truly
[1:22:48] appreciate Easterraise,
[1:22:50] we need to examine why God really loved
[1:22:53] us so much.
[1:22:55] Why us?
[1:22:57] Why was it so important to him that he
[1:23:01] was really willing to make the ultimate
[1:23:04] sacrifice? Just like I said with
[1:23:07] Abraham,
[1:23:10] why you will wait so long, be
[1:23:13] patient, and God will say sacrifice.
[1:23:19] Yeah, it seems almost unfair. But you
[1:23:22] know the beautiful thing about
[1:23:25] God, you can't think about it. You can't
[1:23:28] work it out in your mind. You can't
[1:23:30] figure it out. You can't understand his
[1:23:33] love because his love is
[1:23:36] so unnatural to us humans that we could
[1:23:40] spend whole day talking about it and
[1:23:42] still not have a clue what he thinking.
[1:23:45] [Applause]
[1:23:47] His love is very very simple but
[1:23:51] different.
[1:23:53] Because we have two main loves to talk
[1:23:56] about. What I know for sure is that his
[1:23:59] love never fails. Amen.
[1:24:01] But
[1:24:03] simply
[1:24:06] put, there are two
[1:24:09] forms of
[1:24:12] love. One
[1:24:14] form would be filio love and that's the
[1:24:18] love you have, you know, for your spouse
[1:24:21] and your wife and husband and so on.
[1:24:24] That's human love that you're willing to
[1:24:27] do things for them, you know, you're
[1:24:29] willing to fight for them.
[1:24:39] Sometimes I know some of you thinking
[1:24:42] depending on the circumstance.
[1:24:47] But then there's also agape love, the
[1:24:50] love of God.
[1:24:52] That's divine love.
[1:24:54] Amen.
[1:24:56] That is seemingly contrary to human
[1:25:00] love. It's not the same as the love you
[1:25:03] have for your spouse.
[1:25:05] Brother Brandon by example he
[1:25:08] said if a man were to insult your
[1:25:11] wife right away you'll want to kill him.
[1:25:14] You'll want to fight
[1:25:16] him. Perhaps now you may want to
[1:25:19] reconsider those decisions. But
[1:25:22] naturally you will feel inclined to
[1:25:24] defend her.
[1:25:28] But if you have a gap love, when a man
[1:25:33] insults your
[1:25:36] wife, you feel to pray for him because
[1:25:38] you know he just took God out of his
[1:25:41] thoughts.
[1:25:43] You know he's lost.
[1:25:45] you know, he has to be really really on
[1:25:49] a different kind of scale.
[1:25:51] He can't be normal because that's not
[1:25:54] what humans should do.
[1:25:57] That's God's love. That's not man's way
[1:25:59] of thinking about love. So, it's two
[1:26:01] different types. Human love reasons.
[1:26:04] God's love doesn't.
[1:26:07] God's love is hinged on faith and
[1:26:10] belief. Hallelujah. So, it doesn't
[1:26:12] change. It doesn't change based on
[1:26:14] circumstance and situational. It's the
[1:26:17] same love throughout and we saw the
[1:26:19] example of God's love
[1:26:22] when and we heard it Sunday the bull and
[1:26:26] bees and so on. That was God's love. But
[1:26:29] the Brandham himself said, "Listen, if I
[1:26:31] had my gun, I shoot the bull and pay for
[1:26:34] it."
[1:26:35] Self-preservation.
[1:26:37] But that doesn't work in the economy of
[1:26:39] God. He has a provided way. to achieve
[1:26:43] particular outcomes
[1:26:47] and that's his way
[1:26:51] and you know to face an audience like
[1:26:52] this this is brother Brandon
[1:26:57] speaking someone might say do you mean
[1:27:01] that you'd read those one little verse
[1:27:04] of scripture that sound almost childish
[1:27:07] for God so loved the
[1:27:10] world but you know what he said about
[1:27:12] He said, "There's enough in that verse
[1:27:14] of scripture to send you to heaven or
[1:27:18] condemn you forever." I love that.
[1:27:21] And if I had the power, I would in no
[1:27:24] wise change
[1:27:25] it. If I would be offered all the money
[1:27:29] in the world and to be king of the
[1:27:31] universe and a million years to reign in
[1:27:34] health, I still wouldn't change one word
[1:27:38] of that text because it's God's word.
[1:27:41] And it can never change. No matter how
[1:27:45] small it is, it's just the same. It's
[1:27:49] got the same value in it that the entire
[1:27:52] book has got.
[1:27:55] Your action and your attitude towards
[1:27:57] this little piece of scripture will seal
[1:28:00] your eternal destination. Amen. And if
[1:28:03] that scripture is that valuable, it's
[1:28:06] plenty enough for us to
[1:28:09] think tonight on it for a little while.
[1:28:14] Amen. So that scripture is enough for us
[1:28:16] to think on. There's so many things in
[1:28:19] there and we started already to speak
[1:28:22] about the love of God.
[1:28:24] So he had this unique ability to love
[1:28:28] regardless of your failures and your
[1:28:30] shortcomings and your mistakes and your
[1:28:32] ups and downs because he knew you were
[1:28:35] going to fail it. He knew you were going
[1:28:37] to fall. He knew you were going to be
[1:28:40] led astray and you would have gone
[1:28:41] wrong. But he also knew a day would come
[1:28:45] like the prodigal son where you would
[1:28:47] turn around and say, "Wait a minute.
[1:28:50] What am I really doing here?
[1:28:53] at the side of this bar trying to hide
[1:28:56] from the entrance
[1:29:00] because I really don't want anybody to
[1:29:01] see
[1:29:03] me. Why am I really here? And when that
[1:29:07] moment of realization come, you start to
[1:29:11] think and reflect, wait a minute, this
[1:29:14] is this is not where I belong. This is
[1:29:16] not where I'm supposed to be. Like like
[1:29:18] the eagle scratching around with
[1:29:19] chickens. Why I scratching for corn when
[1:29:23] it have fresh killed carcass for me to
[1:29:26] participate in?
[1:29:30] When you come to that realization,
[1:29:32] listen, if you had a practice flapping
[1:29:36] all day and all night, it don't matter.
[1:29:38] No, because you get a revelation of who
[1:29:42] you are and where you supposed to be.
[1:29:46] You believe the prodigal son thought,
[1:29:49] you know, it has servants making more
[1:29:51] than me, but that ride seem a little too
[1:29:54] long. You're too far to go back home.
[1:29:57] You believe that?
[1:29:59] No. He didn't care if he had to take a
[1:30:03] cart, a horse, a a a a taxi, a bus, a
[1:30:07] maxi. It didn't matter what people say
[1:30:10] about him on the journey. He was going
[1:30:12] home.
[1:30:16] [Applause]
[1:30:18] Hallelujah.
[1:30:20] Likewise, God
[1:30:22] knew that man was going to fail.
[1:30:26] And it didn't matter what transpired
[1:30:28] throughout the process. You know, he
[1:30:30] always had a plan of redemption.
[1:30:35] It may have had ups and downs and we
[1:30:37] look at it and we find it looks strange
[1:30:38] and we don't understand, but it it
[1:30:40] doesn't matter. We don't have to
[1:30:42] understand it. He said it. He made the
[1:30:45] promise by himself and he has an
[1:30:48] obligation to keep the promise.
[1:30:52] [Applause]
[1:30:58] So this evening we would like to think
[1:31:00] about his love
[1:31:03] and the value he placed on us by
[1:31:05] understanding what really happened at
[1:31:07] Calvary. Amen. We also want to look at
[1:31:10] what transpired since Calvary because
[1:31:13] Calvary represented a shift of power
[1:31:18] where Satan in the past was able to
[1:31:20] terrorize you, torture you, torment you.
[1:31:24] He could dangle the powers of the world
[1:31:27] and everything before ruler of darkness.
[1:31:29] He was the boss, you know, because man
[1:31:31] fell.
[1:31:33] And since the fall of Adam, he could run
[1:31:36] the route. however he wanted. Amen. But
[1:31:40] Calvary represented a shift in his
[1:31:43] paradigm where our custom doing this
[1:31:46] normal living our custom going to church
[1:31:49] our custom going Easter conventions but
[1:31:52] Calvary happened.
[1:31:54] When Calvary happened something changed.
[1:31:58] It wasn't business as usual.
[1:32:05] When we consider value as well, God had
[1:32:09] to see real great value in you. You
[1:32:12] know,
[1:32:15] because Jesus himself, he said,
[1:32:19] "Listen, if this cup could pass, if I
[1:32:23] could just walk on water, heal the sick,
[1:32:26] raise the dead, I I I having a good time
[1:32:29] with the brethren here." That was the
[1:32:31] life. But you know what he said? Said,
[1:32:34] "Not my will, not what I think, not how
[1:32:39] I feel emotionally as a man, but I am a
[1:32:43] man on a mission. I've been trained and
[1:32:46] prepared for this."
[1:32:48] And the mission must be successfully
[1:32:51] completed.
[1:32:54] So let let let's look at what happened
[1:32:56] at Calvary. And brother Brandham spoke a
[1:32:59] message that day on Calvary. I I know
[1:33:02] you know the story but listen to this.
[1:33:05] He say finally one day that's the day of
[1:33:08] Calvary. There was one came down from
[1:33:11] glory. One by the name of Jesus Christ
[1:33:13] the son of God who came from glory and
[1:33:15] Calvary was formed.
[1:33:18] That was the day that the price was paid
[1:33:20] and the sin question was settled
[1:33:22] forever.
[1:33:24] So it wasn't just about crucifixion. No,
[1:33:27] the sin question was settled because
[1:33:30] crucifixion was the means of punishment
[1:33:33] at that time. It wasn't strange. We know
[1:33:37] even the bandits were crucified. So, it
[1:33:40] wasn't unusual.
[1:33:42] It opened up the way unto this thing
[1:33:45] that we're hungering and thirsting for.
[1:33:47] Hallelujah. It brought a place of
[1:33:49] satisfaction that no man that's ever
[1:33:52] visit Calvary and seen it the way it was
[1:33:55] that can ever be the same.
[1:33:58] Everything that he ever desired or
[1:34:00] longed for is met when he reaches that
[1:34:02] place.
[1:34:04] It was such an important day that such
[1:34:08] an important thing it shook the world.
[1:34:11] It shook the world like it was never
[1:34:12] shook before. When Jesus died at Calvary
[1:34:15] and paid the sin question,
[1:34:19] this sinful world had a blackout. The
[1:34:22] sun went down in the middle of the day.
[1:34:24] And it had a nervous frustration.
[1:34:28] The rock shook, mountains rent, and the
[1:34:31] dead bodies bursted from the grave. What
[1:34:34] did it do? God zeroed in on Calvary.
[1:34:39] He wounded that animal called Satan
[1:34:42] forever. Now listen, listen. It's not
[1:34:47] just he wounded the animal, you know,
[1:34:48] but I want you to understand. Yes.
[1:34:51] Hallelujah.
[1:34:54] Now, he's been more vicious since then
[1:34:56] because it brought light to the human
[1:34:58] race. And anyone knows that a wounded
[1:35:01] animal is its most vicious, crawling
[1:35:04] around with his back broke. Now, Satan
[1:35:07] was knocked out at Calvary. The earth
[1:35:10] proved that it was the greatest price
[1:35:13] that was ever paid and the only one that
[1:35:16] could pay it. Come and done it at
[1:35:18] Calvary. That's the significance of
[1:35:21] Calvary. That's where the great price
[1:35:23] was paid. That's one of the things God
[1:35:27] had required it. No man was worthy. No
[1:35:30] man was able. No man could do it. And
[1:35:34] God came himself. and was made human and
[1:35:38] lived a human life under human desires
[1:35:42] and was crucified at Calvary. And there
[1:35:46] when Satan thought perhaps would he do
[1:35:49] it
[1:35:51] he wouldn't do it. Hallelujah. He
[1:35:54] wouldn't go through with it cuz he
[1:35:55] having second thoughts. Satan thought
[1:35:57] so. All right. He went through
[1:35:59] Gethsemane and every temptation any man
[1:36:03] ever stood, he went through it just like
[1:36:06] all men, but he paid the price.
[1:36:08] [Music]
[1:36:11] So even though it seemed like if there's
[1:36:14] a chance he may not go through with it,
[1:36:17] he did it anyway.
[1:36:19] But we need to go back a little.
[1:36:22] Jesus didn't come out and say, "Hey,
[1:36:25] yeah, yeah, hold up. Well, you know who
[1:36:28] I am. I am Jesus. I am here to go up on
[1:36:31] that cross, come back down, be
[1:36:33] resurrected. I have it covered. No, no,
[1:36:36] no, no, no.
[1:36:38] He had to go through Gethsemane before
[1:36:40] Calvary.
[1:36:43] He had to do it. There was no passing
[1:36:46] around Gethsemane and going with a level
[1:36:49] of bravado and pride and say, "Listen, I
[1:36:51] just going and pick up a cross there for
[1:36:54] some people cuz my father want me to do
[1:36:55] it." That wasn't the attitude.
[1:36:58] Hallelujah. He had to fight.
[1:37:02] He had to struggle. He had to sacrifice
[1:37:05] and go beyond himself.
[1:37:07] Go beyond what people thought was
[1:37:09] normal. You know why? For love.
[1:37:13] You see, love does make you act in
[1:37:15] strange ways. Love will make you do
[1:37:18] strange things. Just ask anybody who's
[1:37:20] caught caught. Well, I shouldn't say
[1:37:21] now. Caught in back in the day, we used
[1:37:24] to do strange things. Amen.
[1:37:26] We used to do strange things long time.
[1:37:28] We would travel from this place to this
[1:37:30] place by taxi, by car, by bus. Before my
[1:37:34] time, they used to walk.
[1:37:36] Yeah. For love. The things people do for
[1:37:40] love. I told you there's a love story
[1:37:41] this evening.
[1:37:43] In a message,
[1:37:44] Desperations 63, paragraph
[1:37:48] 126. Say,
[1:37:49] listen. Talking about the world's
[1:37:52] greatest battleground. Our dear Lord
[1:37:55] Jesus himself in the world's greatest
[1:37:58] battleground, Gethsemane, he cried out
[1:38:01] in despair.
[1:38:03] Should he take the sins of the world? It
[1:38:05] wasn't his sins, the sins of the world.
[1:38:08] Or should he just remain on earth with
[1:38:10] his disciples?
[1:38:13] What he wanted to do. But watch his
[1:38:15] humility as he humble himself. Not my
[1:38:18] will, but thy will be done. Humble
[1:38:20] himself to the word. the promised word
[1:38:23] of God of heaven. Notice he went a
[1:38:26] little further.
[1:38:28] And if he went a little farther, how
[1:38:30] much ought we to go a little farther
[1:38:32] tonight? See,
[1:38:36] and notice the scripture says here in
[1:38:38] Luke that he prayed earnestly.
[1:38:41] Brother, sister, if Jesus had to pray
[1:38:43] earnestly, how about you and I? Amen.
[1:38:48] How much more we've got to pray
[1:38:51] earnestly. If Christ, the God of heaven,
[1:38:54] made flesh, had to pray earnestly, how
[1:38:57] much more are we sinners saved by grace,
[1:39:00] pray earnestly?
[1:39:02] If the decision throw the son of God
[1:39:04] into despair to make that decision, what
[1:39:08] will it do to you and I? Desperately, we
[1:39:11] must cry. Amen. God in these last days
[1:39:15] had manifested himself so to us by his
[1:39:18] great signs and power. It should make us
[1:39:21] desperate. That's right. And he's
[1:39:23] willing to heal us. He's willing to save
[1:39:26] us. Ought we to to throw everything at
[1:39:29] him in desperation to get that healing
[1:39:33] to get that sealing to get that
[1:39:34] deliverance to get filled to be set
[1:39:38] free.
[1:39:41] The thing is, you need to want it.
[1:39:46] No matter what, we could talk
[1:39:48] desperation. We could talk emergency,
[1:39:50] but you need to want it, you know. It's
[1:39:53] not an autopilot. This is not a plane.
[1:39:56] So, just imagine Jesus had to go through
[1:39:58] this for us to access redemption. For us
[1:40:03] to be reconciled with God, to bridge the
[1:40:05] gap between sin and salvation. So we can
[1:40:08] access the grace of God. He had to go
[1:40:11] through that.
[1:40:13] And we are still presented with the
[1:40:15] option to accept it or reject it.
[1:40:19] Three type of believers you know three
[1:40:22] types. So you still have an option here
[1:40:24] for you say listen you know some folks
[1:40:27] they sacrifice and they believe because
[1:40:30] I sacrificed you have to. That is not
[1:40:33] how God does operate. That's how man
[1:40:35] does operate. Yeah. So, you see, the
[1:40:37] price you
[1:40:38] pay doesn't guarantee acceptance or
[1:40:42] appreciation.
[1:40:43] Parents could relate to this. Back in
[1:40:45] the day, you used to hear things like,
[1:40:47] "Boy, I I went without. I left myself
[1:40:52] undone from my children, for them to
[1:40:54] become educated, for them to go
[1:40:57] university. And now look at them. Look
[1:40:59] at them. They are no time with me.
[1:41:01] They're buring with me after I give
[1:41:03] everything." Now you sacrifice, you
[1:41:06] know, yes, you couldn't be faulted for
[1:41:08] that. You paid your price, but it didn't
[1:41:11] guarantee or give an obligation to the
[1:41:14] children that they had to accept the
[1:41:17] sacrifice or appreciate it. You see, the
[1:41:19] acceptance and appreciation is on them.
[1:41:22] The sacrifice is on you. So you see, it
[1:41:25] brings the question of price versus
[1:41:27] value.
[1:41:29] He paid the price. The price is what is
[1:41:32] paid.
[1:41:33] We could measure the price easily.
[1:41:35] Sometimes we quantify it. We'll say,
[1:41:37] "Look, you pay $100."
[1:41:40] Value is what it means to you.
[1:41:44] Perhaps convenience. Hallelujah. Perhaps
[1:41:47] time, perhaps luxury or comfort,
[1:41:52] right? There's often times a a real
[1:41:55] significant difference between value and
[1:41:57] price.
[1:41:59] Amen. So, here it is.
[1:42:02] God was in control of the price part.
[1:42:06] The price was, "Hey, here what I take in
[1:42:08] my son, but only son going to pay the
[1:42:11] price." But it's still up to you and I
[1:42:14] to respond. It's still up to you and I
[1:42:17] to accept or decline, accept or reject
[1:42:21] what he paid the price for. Because we
[1:42:23] have to see, wait a minute, he paid the
[1:42:26] price for us. I wonder why. It have to
[1:42:29] be something special about us or
[1:42:31] something we were lacking or something
[1:42:32] we needed. So he really pay a
[1:42:35] significant price because we are a great
[1:42:37] value. And when you come to yourself and
[1:42:40] you come to your senses, all of a sudden
[1:42:43] you're like that that that slave. when
[1:42:46] they recognize he operate different. He
[1:42:49] sleep in the same place and he eating
[1:42:51] the same food and he he giving the same
[1:42:53] instruction but he operate the reason he
[1:42:56] operate different because he came to his
[1:42:58] senses and he knew who he was. He knew
[1:43:01] that way back in Africa his father was
[1:43:04] king of the tribe. So it didn't matter
[1:43:06] where he was his position didn't change
[1:43:09] his heritage. His listen his geography
[1:43:14] didn't affect his identity. It didn't
[1:43:17] matter if somebody say, "But look at
[1:43:19] you. You in slavery just like us." It
[1:43:22] didn't matter because to him I'm the son
[1:43:25] of a king. That makes me a prince. It
[1:43:28] doesn't matter where I go. It doesn't m
[1:43:31] matter who is around me. I am who I am
[1:43:34] by myself. Nobody have to control me. I
[1:43:38] don't have to give in to peer pressure.
[1:43:41] I don't have to give in to what group
[1:43:43] think or what the crowd doing. No, I am
[1:43:47] a child of God. Sunday and Monday too,
[1:43:51] Friday and Saturday too. It doesn't
[1:43:53] matter the situation or the
[1:43:55] circumstance. If if I wear down in the
[1:43:58] countryside or in the city, I live this
[1:44:01] way because this is who I am. Because my
[1:44:04] father is a particular kind of person
[1:44:07] and I want to please him. I want to
[1:44:10] reflect him.
[1:44:13] [Applause]
[1:44:19] Amen. You may have your seats.
[1:44:25] Hallelujah. Speaking about that, you
[1:44:27] know, often times we are confused about
[1:44:31] value. We
[1:44:33] sometimes value certain things that may
[1:44:35] not be important.
[1:44:38] We pay emphasis and we give attention.
[1:44:41] We give our time. We go through great
[1:44:43] lengths and sacrifice for things that
[1:44:44] are really not significant in the great
[1:44:47] scheme of things. Yes. Amen. When we
[1:44:49] consider everything around and you
[1:44:51] really try to categorize the things that
[1:44:53] are of value, sometimes we really miss
[1:44:56] the mark. Our priorities are really
[1:44:58] turned upside down.
[1:45:02] We look at an example that brother
[1:45:04] Brandham gave and we will then parallel
[1:45:07] to some of the things that we see around
[1:45:09] us. He gives a story a couple times
[1:45:12] about a little boy up in an attic and he
[1:45:15] found I'll just paraphrase he found a
[1:45:16] little old stamp. When he found the
[1:45:19] little stamp, he had the desire in his
[1:45:21] heart to get ice cream. The ice cream
[1:45:24] probably cost about 5
[1:45:26] cents. So when he found the stamp, he
[1:45:29] realized that this stamp may have value.
[1:45:32] So he took the stamp and he went by what
[1:45:36] is the equivalent of a porn shop today?
[1:45:39] somebody who could give him some money
[1:45:41] in exchange for this stamp. So he went
[1:45:44] with it. Give it to them. Say, "How much
[1:45:47] you'll give me for this?" Cuz he knows
[1:45:49] you want ice cream.
[1:45:52] He knows that's what you want to buy.
[1:45:54] Ice cream is 5 cents. He said, "If they
[1:45:58] offer me five cents, it's
[1:46:00] sold." Because all I want is ice cream.
[1:46:03] I don't want two. I don't want three. I
[1:46:06] want ice cream today. I want it now.
[1:46:09] Five cents is all I
[1:46:10] need. The person on the other side give
[1:46:13] him a
[1:46:14] dollar. You could imagine the excitement
[1:46:18] because instantly although he was a
[1:46:20] little boy and I don't think they
[1:46:21] mentioned his age, he would have
[1:46:23] realized that this thing is worth a lot
[1:46:25] more than I thought. I thought this
[1:46:27] could buy me a ice cream, but this could
[1:46:30] buy 20 ice creams.
[1:46:33] Suffice it to say, he left it alone and
[1:46:36] he moved on. I understand that within
[1:46:38] two
[1:46:39] weeks that stamp was sold for a couple
[1:46:43] hundred.
[1:46:46] Yeah. So the value in it obviously
[1:46:51] increased. Amen. Although the price that
[1:46:54] was paid was very small, the value was a
[1:46:58] lot more. So there's a great disparity
[1:47:00] between the two. It turns out that some
[1:47:02] months later that stamp was
[1:47:05] resold and it was appraised at over a4
[1:47:08] million dollars. Now this is back in the
[1:47:10] day. Yeah. So the little boy he
[1:47:14] obviously didn't understand the real
[1:47:16] value of the stamp. The same could be
[1:47:19] said about stories about Bitcoin and
[1:47:21] different things where back in the day
[1:47:24] people didn't think too much about it.
[1:47:26] By the way, this is not an endorsement
[1:47:27] of it.
[1:47:29] But value could change over time. What
[1:47:32] it means to you could change over time.
[1:47:36] I want to move on
[1:47:39] though
[1:47:41] to another example that I know you're
[1:47:43] familiar with in the message doors and
[1:47:45] doors.
[1:47:47] Brother Brandham, he was talking about
[1:47:48] President
[1:47:49] Lincoln and a young man that found
[1:47:53] himself at the mercy of the
[1:47:56] state and his punishment was death.
[1:48:01] And a good friend approached President
[1:48:03] Lincoln and I'll read it from paragraph
[1:48:05] 90. He said to him as he was getting out
[1:48:08] his carriage, "Mr. Lincoln," a tall
[1:48:11] bearded typical southern skinny and he
[1:48:14] said, "Mr. Lincoln, there's a boy that's
[1:48:16] going to die in two days from
[1:48:19] now. He going to be shot because he run
[1:48:22] in the time of battle instead of
[1:48:24] standing his ground. And he said, "Mr.
[1:48:27] Lincoln, the boy isn't a bad boy." But
[1:48:30] all those musketss firing and people
[1:48:32] dying, he was nervous and he he was so
[1:48:35] upset that he threw up his hands and he
[1:48:37] started screaming. He run up and said,
[1:48:40] "I've known the
[1:48:41] boy." Said, "Mr. Lincoln, only your name
[1:48:44] on this piece of paper can spare him.
[1:48:46] Will you do it?
[1:48:50] Of course, this Christian gentleman
[1:48:52] quickly signed the paper. Pardoned. So
[1:48:54] and so signed his name. Abraham Lincoln,
[1:48:57] president of the United States. Went the
[1:48:59] messenger back as hard as he could and
[1:49:02] he run to the cell. He said, "You're
[1:49:04] free. You're
[1:49:06] free. Here is Mr. Lincoln. Mr. Lincoln's
[1:49:09] signature. You're free.
[1:49:13] He
[1:49:14] said, "This is the
[1:49:17] wouldbe guy in prison who was about to
[1:49:21] die." His response, if you never heard
[1:49:24] it before, it may astonish
[1:49:26] you. He said, "Why would you come to
[1:49:29] mock me knowing that I'm going to die
[1:49:31] tomorrow?"
[1:49:33] He said, "Take that away from here.
[1:49:35] You're only mocking me." And he would
[1:49:37] not receive it.
[1:49:39] He said, "No, I I I don't want it." He
[1:49:42] said, "You're only making if if that was
[1:49:45] the president, it will have, you know,
[1:49:47] the official coat of arms and it will
[1:49:49] have the right type of paper, probably
[1:49:51] laid paper. It will have the seal. It
[1:49:53] will have a stamp. It will have certain
[1:49:55] things that I believe is significant and
[1:49:57] symbolic of coming from the president
[1:49:59] himself." He said, "You're just mocking
[1:50:02] me and trying to make me feel good." And
[1:50:05] he started screaming, "Turn this back."
[1:50:08] The next morning, the boy was
[1:50:12] shot. Then after the boy being dead and
[1:50:15] the president's name on this piece of
[1:50:16] paper that he was pardoned, then
[1:50:19] what? They tried it in the federal
[1:50:21] court. And here was the decision of a
[1:50:24] federal courts, which is the ultimate of
[1:50:26] all our courts. What they say sometimes,
[1:50:29] we don't like their decision, but we
[1:50:31] have to abide by it anyhow. See, because
[1:50:34] that's a typost.
[1:50:37] That's the ultimate. Now, it said this
[1:50:40] decision. A pardon is not a pardon
[1:50:43] unless it be received as a pardon.
[1:50:46] And that's the way with God's word.
[1:50:49] It's a pardon if it's received as a
[1:50:52] pardon.
[1:50:54] It's the word of God. It's the power of
[1:50:55] God to those who would believe it and
[1:50:59] accept it. Hallelujah. So I could preach
[1:51:02] for the rest of the evening. If you
[1:51:04] don't believe and accept the word of
[1:51:07] God,
[1:51:09] it is of no effect. It doesn't apply to
[1:51:12] you. It's just words.
[1:51:18] For a second, I want to come back to
[1:51:19] that great exchange. We talk about price
[1:51:22] versus value. According to research, the
[1:51:26] key difference between price and value
[1:51:28] lies in their
[1:51:30] perspectives. Price is the amount paid
[1:51:33] while value is the perceived worth or
[1:51:36] benefit derived from that payment.
[1:51:39] When we reexamine the context scripture
[1:51:41] we read earlier in John 3:16, we said,
[1:51:44] "For God so loved the world that he gave
[1:51:48] his only begotten
[1:51:50] son that whosoever believeth in him
[1:51:53] should not perish but have everlasting
[1:51:56] life." Amen. Jesus Christ, the only
[1:51:58] begotten son of God was the price and
[1:52:02] the value would be the benefit of
[1:52:05] everlasting life. Amen.
[1:52:07] If you don't see the benefit in having
[1:52:10] access to everlasting life, then it
[1:52:13] didn't matter what price was paid. It's
[1:52:15] not applicable to you. You're not in a
[1:52:18] position to accept it.
[1:52:21] You can't be pardoned as it were. Amen.
[1:52:25] You know in a message broken sistns with
[1:52:29] a brand speaking he said they think you
[1:52:32] need to have a big denomination you know
[1:52:34] together and let them all come together
[1:52:35] to have a great milling around and so
[1:52:38] forth and get thousands to cooperate.
[1:52:40] You think we need to have a a great big
[1:52:42] convention to have a revival.
[1:52:46] Sometimes God takes a little old guy
[1:52:49] that don't even know his ABCs and right
[1:52:52] amongst a bunch of illiterate people
[1:52:54] that hardly knows their right hand from
[1:52:56] the left. He can raise up a revival that
[1:53:00] will shake the world. He did it in the
[1:53:02] time of John. He done it in the time of
[1:53:05] the prophets. None of them as we know of
[1:53:07] was ever educated.
[1:53:10] But God could get a hold of them and do
[1:53:12] something with them.
[1:53:15] In this rock came forth the
[1:53:18] waters with the children of Israel about
[1:53:21] Moses say he was the rock and he
[1:53:23] commanded this rock and must be smoked
[1:53:26] and he gave abundance of pure fresh
[1:53:29] clean water to everybody that would
[1:53:31] drink. He saved all who would drink from
[1:53:34] it. A perfect parallel with John 3:16.
[1:53:38] God so loved the world that he gave his
[1:53:39] only begotten son. Whosoever believeth
[1:53:42] on him should not perish but would have
[1:53:44] everlasting life. God smoked that rock
[1:53:47] on Calvary. Our judgment was upon him
[1:53:50] and from him might come the spirit of
[1:53:52] life that would give you and me eternal
[1:53:55] life.
[1:53:58] Hallelujah. That's a perfect parable of
[1:54:00] it. There is this
[1:54:03] wilderness. They never had to pull, dig,
[1:54:06] pump or anything.
[1:54:08] just partake in his provided way. That's
[1:54:12] the way that he chose to give them
[1:54:14] water.
[1:54:16] Freely
[1:54:18] when they didn't have to dig it out of a
[1:54:20] pond. They didn't have to pull it up
[1:54:22] with a bucket. They didn't have to win
[1:54:25] to get it. Hallelujah. They just had to
[1:54:27] partake of it. And that's all there is
[1:54:30] now. You don't have to join nothing. You
[1:54:33] don't have to get down and work up some
[1:54:36] something and pump it and and hope it
[1:54:38] happen.
[1:54:40] You don't have to say a word over and
[1:54:41] over
[1:54:43] till you get a confused language. No,
[1:54:45] no. The only thing you have to do is
[1:54:48] partake of him freely. That's his
[1:54:50] provided way.
[1:54:52] No pumping, pushing, nothing. Just take
[1:54:55] it freely. Nothing you have to really
[1:54:57] do, you know. Just partake of it.
[1:55:00] Hallelujah. Just believe it. It's all I
[1:55:03] can say. They never had to do anything
[1:55:06] for it. That's right. Never had to dig
[1:55:08] for it. Never had to get on and cry all
[1:55:10] night hoping water was coming. They just
[1:55:12] had to partake. It was smitten and
[1:55:15] ready. That's right. Listen. And God had
[1:55:18] a provided way. He said, "Listen, a few
[1:55:20] years ago, reminds me of now some normal
[1:55:25] modern witch doctors said, let that be
[1:55:29] baby cry." You know it have a lot of
[1:55:31] concepts and people always have a a new
[1:55:34] idea, a new de development. You say
[1:55:37] leave the children and let them cry. Let
[1:55:40] them figure out life. Let them figure it
[1:55:43] out. Don't just grab them up. Don't just
[1:55:46] hug them up. Don't just love them up.
[1:55:48] Allow them to go through their emotions.
[1:55:51] Allow them to find themselves modern
[1:55:54] witch doctor
[1:55:55] thinking. That's what he called it. They
[1:55:58] say, "Let that baby cry. Don't pick it
[1:56:01] up." In all these things like that,
[1:56:03] don't let grandma touch it. And you know
[1:56:07] what? They hatch out. You see what it
[1:56:09] is? A juvenile delinquency. A bunch of
[1:56:13] neurotics. God made a baby to be loved.
[1:56:17] That's why he made a mother to love a
[1:56:19] baby. That's why we're supposed to be
[1:56:22] this way. God made it that way. And
[1:56:26] anytime you upset God's program, you
[1:56:29] must remember you're wrong.
[1:56:31] You will be wrong. As long you're
[1:56:34] upsetting God's program, follow God's
[1:56:37] program. Do it the way God said do it.
[1:56:40] Now, the only way that that could be
[1:56:42] done, just like you were born a sinner,
[1:56:46] the only way you can ever become
[1:56:47] anything else but a sinner, it's got to
[1:56:50] be another birth.
[1:56:52] You got to be born a Christian.
[1:56:55] If you were born a sinner, then you got
[1:56:57] to be born a Christian. And it's got to
[1:56:59] be something that takes place inside of
[1:57:02] you. And that's the same thing has to
[1:57:06] take place in divine healing. Something
[1:57:08] has to take place inside of you. It has
[1:57:12] to be something take place, not just
[1:57:14] work up or emotion. It got to be
[1:57:17] something that actually happens.
[1:57:20] Hallelujah. See, it's not just, oh well,
[1:57:23] I'll just think it this way and study it
[1:57:27] that way. That doesn't do it. It's got
[1:57:30] to be something actually take place.
[1:57:38] We're looking to wind down.
[1:57:41] Let's talk about Jesus a little bit.
[1:57:44] He was described as a diamond.
[1:57:47] Was described and parallel to gold.
[1:57:50] precious,
[1:57:51] valuable.
[1:57:53] So if God is willing to give up his
[1:57:56] diamond, his precious gold, what is he
[1:57:59] giving it in exchange for? Come on now.
[1:58:04] He obviously attributed great value to
[1:58:06] your life.
[1:58:11] The value of your life is so important
[1:58:13] to God that he willing to give up a
[1:58:15] diamond.
[1:58:16] He willing to exchange gold,
[1:58:20] the highest carrot you could find. He
[1:58:22] willing to give that up for you.
[1:58:26] Listen, listen to the prophet on
[1:58:28] Calvary. He was 100% diamond was ever
[1:58:32] sure he was the greatest gold they ever
[1:58:35] found. The most expensive diamond was
[1:58:38] ever. The Bible said the kingdom of
[1:58:40] heaven is like a man that buys diamonds.
[1:58:43] And when he found this great one, he
[1:58:45] sold all the others. And just to give it
[1:58:49] to buy it, just to acquire that, he
[1:58:52] willing to sacrifice the rest.
[1:58:55] He's the greatest character diamond that
[1:58:58] was ever brought out of the dust of the
[1:59:00] earth. The greatest gold that was ever
[1:59:03] brought from the dirt. Talking about
[1:59:06] Jesus. He's a jewel, a jewel of heaven,
[1:59:10] a big diamond. When a big diamond is
[1:59:13] found in South Africa and he said, "I've
[1:59:15] been through the diamond mines at
[1:59:16] Kimbley and they take the diamonds and
[1:59:19] you know what? Then when they get them
[1:59:21] out the dust raw, the next thing they do
[1:59:24] is chip them." Hallelujah.
[1:59:27] Hallelujah. And the reason they chip
[1:59:28] them, cut them is to reflect lights.
[1:59:32] So don't don't mind you get cut and chip
[1:59:35] and bruise and torn. You know, you can't
[1:59:37] reflect light without that.
[1:59:39] So he say listen we cut them to reflect
[1:59:42] lights. Put lights off of that. The
[1:59:45] carrot of that showing what carrot there
[1:59:47] is in that diamond. If it doesn't have a
[1:59:50] lot of fire and sparkle, that's not much
[1:59:53] diamond. What you got might actually be
[1:59:55] glass. You say, but when it's a real
[1:59:58] diamond, real character diamond, it will
[2:00:00] reflect and show different colors like
[2:00:03] that. Different colors.
[2:00:09] That's what he was. He was a diamond and
[2:00:13] he was wounded for our transgressions.
[2:00:15] He was bruised for our iniquity. The
[2:00:18] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[2:00:21] and by his stripes we were healed. Oh
[2:00:24] them rays of God's love and light
[2:00:26] reflect from him healing power, love,
[2:00:29] resurrection. God wounded him and
[2:00:32] bruised him and chopped him and cut him
[2:00:36] by a Roman sword and a Roman whip until
[2:00:39] his thighs were riven and the blood
[2:00:42] running out his back and is over his
[2:00:44] head and down through his bed and off of
[2:00:47] his feet. Oh, what was he doing? He was
[2:00:50] reflecting love. Embraced the cross
[2:00:53] instead of a soft feathered pillow, a
[2:00:56] manger of straw. Instead of a little
[2:00:58] pink gown to wear swaddling cloth, the
[2:01:02] musicians could could get ready.
[2:01:07] You have been a wonderful audience.
[2:01:09] We're on the final quotes.
[2:01:12] [Applause]
[2:01:14] Now I tell you, thank you Lord from a
[2:01:17] message conference with God. Hallelujah.
[2:01:19] Paragraph 286. Now I tell you what I
[2:01:22] want to do. Yes.
[2:01:25] Hallelujah.
[2:01:28] Wherever you are, I'd like to just stand
[2:01:30] at this time.
[2:01:32] Hallelujah.
[2:01:36] Wherever you are, you might be at home
[2:01:38] right now. You might be in work, you may
[2:01:40] be looking at this online, but for those
[2:01:42] of you who are here, I want you wherever
[2:01:44] you are to just lay your hands on
[2:01:46] somebody close by.
[2:01:49] Just so you see, it's it's not me. This
[2:01:51] is brother Brandham here. He say you
[2:01:53] just as effective. You're a believer. If
[2:01:56] you feel that the Holy Spirit is on you,
[2:01:59] maybe not in a gift like this, but that
[2:02:02] Holy Spirit is on you, someone, no
[2:02:04] matter who it is, lay hands on somebody
[2:02:06] and then bow your head. Lay your hand on
[2:02:09] somebody and bow your head. I feel led
[2:02:11] to do this. I feel that it's time for
[2:02:13] your
[2:02:14] healing. If thou can't believe, oh, the
[2:02:18] Holy Spirit moving over the audience.
[2:02:21] That little fellow yonder from Georgia
[2:02:23] praying for your brother. And I say that
[2:02:25] that mother, father, child right now,
[2:02:28] praying for your brother and
[2:02:30] sister, have faith and believe. It's
[2:02:33] just everywhere. Just everywhere. Don't
[2:02:36] pray for yourself
[2:02:37] now. Pray for the person that you've got
[2:02:41] your hands on. That'll make every one of
[2:02:44] you praying for one another. Now Lord
[2:02:47] Jesus, the son of God, who has raised
[2:02:51] from the dead, even the threats of
[2:02:54] Pontius Pilate and the Roman government
[2:02:56] seal couldn't hold you in the grave. God
[2:02:59] the Almighty came down on the day of
[2:03:01] Easter and rolled back the stone,
[2:03:03] breaking the seal, and you rose up and
[2:03:06] was with your disciples 40 days,
[2:03:09] commissioned them to go into the world
[2:03:10] and do these things that's being done.
[2:03:14] That was over 2,000 years ago.
[2:03:16] [Music]
[2:03:25] Lord, you are
[2:03:27] God. You cannot
[2:03:29] fail. You're
[2:03:31] here in this meeting this evening that
[2:03:34] we've had. We've reasoned together about
[2:03:37] these
[2:03:38] things. We've reasoned that you are God
[2:03:42] and you're here. We have been
[2:03:44] commissioned from you to lay hands on
[2:03:46] one another. You have commissioned us.
[2:03:50] You said these signs shall follow them
[2:03:52] that believe.
[2:03:54] If you lay hands on the sick, they shall
[2:03:56] recover. That's our
[2:03:59] commission. Lord, obedience is better
[2:04:02] than
[2:04:03] sacrifice. Hearkening and the fats of
[2:04:05] ram. Now Lord, as a servant, I
[2:04:08] commission and command every devil,
[2:04:10] every spirit, every sickness, every
[2:04:12] affliction, every contrary thing that's
[2:04:15] bothering these people in the presence
[2:04:17] of God, by the witness of the Holy
[2:04:19] Spirit, by the commission of an angel
[2:04:21] sent to me, I challenge this spirit by
[2:04:24] the word of God, this spirit of sickness
[2:04:27] and afflictions, come out to people in
[2:04:29] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[2:04:31] let them be well. Let them go, Satan.
[2:04:35] You're just a bluff. We've called your
[2:04:38] hand. The time has come when Jesus
[2:04:40] Christ has manifested himself in the
[2:04:44] presence of the Gentiles. Now, Satan,
[2:04:46] you are defeated. One time you held
[2:04:49] people, but today you have no legal
[2:04:53] rights now. Jesus Christ stripped you of
[2:04:56] every right that you had at Calvary. He
[2:05:00] paid the full price and said, "It is
[2:05:03] finished.
[2:05:05] Every complete plan of salvation, all
[2:05:08] the healing, all was finished at Calvary
[2:05:12] and you were taken from you. Everything
[2:05:16] you once possessed through sin and
[2:05:18] through the fall. Now we are redeemed by
[2:05:21] the blood of Jesus and you cannot hold
[2:05:24] us any longer. We say leave us in the
[2:05:27] name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:05:32] [Music]
[2:05:39] He took the
[2:05:42] fall and thought of
[2:05:45] [Music]
[2:05:47] me above all.
[2:05:52] You were
[2:05:57] crucified, laid behind the
[2:06:01] stone. You live to
[2:06:06] die, rejected and
[2:06:09] alone like a
[2:06:12] rose, trampled on the ground.
[2:06:18] You took the
[2:06:21] full and thought of me because of his
[2:06:26] love above all. Every hand raised all
[2:06:30] over this place. Let's sing it. He was
[2:06:34] crucified.
[2:06:36] Oh, made behind the
[2:06:39] stone. You
[2:06:41] live and
[2:06:44] die. Rejected and
[2:06:47] alone like a
[2:06:51] rose trampled on the
[2:06:55] ground. You took the fall.
[2:07:01] part of
[2:07:03] [Music]
[2:07:06] me
[2:07:08] all you were
[2:07:13] crucified laid behind the stone.
[2:07:18] You
[2:07:20] left
[2:07:22] time rejected and alone like a
[2:07:29] rose trample on the
[2:07:33] ground. You took the
[2:07:37] fall and thought of me.
[2:07:45] Let's just bow our
[2:07:47] [Music]
[2:08:06] heads.
[2:08:13] [Music]
[2:08:22] Let's just bow our heads right
[2:08:25] now. Oh heavenly
[2:08:29] father, continue playing.
[2:08:32] Oh
[2:08:36] Lord, I've delivered a message
[2:08:40] again. Lord, I look out and I see your
[2:08:45] people. And some of
[2:08:48] them, some of
[2:08:50] them don't seem convinced us yet,
[2:08:54] Lord. Once
[2:08:57] more. Lord, show up strong
[2:09:01] tonight. Extend your mercy to them,
[2:09:04] Lord. Extend your grace to them,
[2:09:07] Lord. Extend your healing to them, Lord.
[2:09:11] Lord, I pray that they
