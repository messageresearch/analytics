[14:40] [Music]
[14:48] it's good to be here it's good to be
[14:52] back among you all
[14:55] I've been greedy asam Argentina and what
[14:57] a time and I know but Isaac and Ghana
[15:01] had a tremendous time also when it's
[15:04] time come he would share with you but we
[15:05] had a real tremendous time in Argentina
[15:09] I want to thank on Antony I didn't get
[15:12] to get a message for the last Sunday
[15:14] service true seed of the world last
[15:15] Sunday and I thought you were really
[15:18] blessed inspiration the Lord look upon
[15:21] the heart and in Argentina I have no
[15:24] words and the testimonies were so very
[15:26] encouraging just want to read maybe just
[15:29] two for you but it's you I want to give
[15:32] you my personal testimony of the
[15:34] meetings in Argentina I hope this
[15:36] message of my brother last night I could
[15:38] hardly sleep because I was meditating on
[15:40] the messages that Holy Spirit brought
[15:42] this weekend and certainly what is
[15:44] mature we have received power in our
[15:46] souls our understanding was open to see
[15:49] the world in the present tense and God
[15:52] wants us to take us deeper into
[15:54] revelation but God has placed in my
[15:56] heart that we should give the importance
[15:58] to life and the right spirit I my
[16:02] brother met the Lord and I will never be
[16:05] the same
[16:06] I believe it out a doubt that your
[16:08] ministry will be powerfully occupied in
[16:10] this last ride the Holy Spirit has
[16:13] focused me to stand firm in the world in
[16:16] these meetings we can see a channel
[16:18] flowing free of anointed and Commission
[16:20] interpretation I encourage you to move
[16:23] forward looking only to Jesus we must
[16:25] give the true importance to our Lord
[16:27] Jesus Christ
[16:28] I appreciate you much of a servant of
[16:31] Christ for the building of us as
[16:32] Hispanics I think I will see you very
[16:34] soon I'll be praying for ministry you're
[16:36] farming at church but
[16:38] Joshua from Chile
[16:39] [Music]
[16:43] and I get this testimony to speak here
[16:46] and such as money without standing one
[16:49] of the Deacons that were standing by
[16:51] when you walk up to the pulpit on the
[16:53] last message he said as you pass by the
[16:56] presence of the Lord came upon him and
[16:59] his knees started to shake he was asking
[17:02] the Lord what was done but after the
[17:03] service he can't stop with disinterred
[17:06] people he has already won five souls for
[17:10] the kingdom
[17:11] all praise the Lord amen amen
[17:16] [Music]
[17:18] well this morning we have a tip we like
[17:20] to put on before but before that I wanna
[17:23] have a time of Prayer a small time of
[17:25] Prayer I felt that we after Friday
[17:27] permitting and all the time but a
[17:29] Stephen for hung in India for the
[17:31] permitting services were blessed even as
[17:33] a real tremendous time Friday we had a
[17:36] tremendous time in the Lord I was back
[17:39] on Tuesday but we are there for Friday
[17:40] permitting but this description red is
[17:43] for music a chapter 9 and Daniel I was
[17:47] understood by books in number of years
[17:48] where of the word of the Lord you see if
[17:51] you don't take time off to there's a
[17:56] echo up here if you don't take time off
[17:59] to go into the world to look at what is
[18:03] happening now you miss the whole thing
[18:06] you live in a normal like eating
[18:08] drinking going to work come back home
[18:09] like if nothing happening this day what
[18:13] not to take you on our ways we spoke a
[18:16] message the day of the Lord everything
[18:18] God gives you and released into your
[18:19] life it's a civil matter let me say that
[18:22] game everything that God has given you
[18:25] and released into your life is receiving
[18:27] better not to get food away from God but
[18:30] to get closer to God every single thing
[18:33] your husband your wife your children
[18:35] your family your job your money your car
[18:37] whatever it is God give you is to get
[18:40] closer to him
[18:41] [Music]
[18:44] the devil job is to get you further from
[18:47] God because the devil don't want you to
[18:49] come to perfection because a devil knew
[18:51] his time is short so you're going on
[18:53] more like a roaring lion seeking it to
[18:55] get you trapped in the churchianity
[18:57] because I got break material like church
[19:00] spirit and you have to come and fight
[19:02] that and look to God look to the angel
[19:05] looked at the Spirit of God looked at
[19:07] the power of God look at you meeting God
[19:09] looking for your personal picture coming
[19:11] together burden Alleluia and the problem
[19:15] if people don't have a burden I put in
[19:17] for service I've been for the things
[19:19] I've drawn a win for the revival you
[19:21] have to get the burden I set my face on
[19:28] the Lord to seek by prayer and
[19:30] supplication with fasting and support
[19:32] and ashes and I pray them that Lord my
[19:34] God and made my confession and said O
[19:36] Lord the Great and dreadful God keeping
[19:39] the covenant and mercy to them there's
[19:41] only had a Priam
[19:42] these are things yet to show you how to
[19:44] pray how to pray not just bring your own
[19:47] take Lord God and thing and you just go
[19:49] in your own Mary we because you praying
[19:51] that for 50 years or for 20 years you
[19:53] see we will pray and not it you know you
[19:55] have to switch be put in because God

[33:51] in the law of Moses all this evil is
[33:52] come upon us yet made we not our prayer
[33:55] before the Lord our God that we might

[34:02] evil brought it upon us for the Lord
[34:04] what is righteous in all his works which
[34:07] he won't do it for your business voice
[34:09] and now O Lord our God that was brought
[34:11] by people for out of the land of Egypt
[34:13] with a mighty hand and cutting be
[34:15] renowned as of this day we have sinned
[34:17] we have done wickedly Oh Lord according
[34:19] to all I righteousness I beseech thee
[34:21] let her hunger and I theory we turn away
[34:24] from thy city Jerusalem by holy mountain
[34:26] because of our sins and for the
[34:28] iniquities of fathers Jerusalem
[34:30] my people are become a reproach to all

[34:37] supplication
[34:38] oh my oh go my god incline thine ear in
[34:43] here opening I shall be whole our

[35:06] praying and confessing my sin and the
[35:09] sin of my people Israel and presenting
[35:12] my supplication before the Lord my God
[35:14] for the holy mountain of my god yeah
[35:16] while I was speaking in prayer even a
[35:18] man Gabriel whom had seen in the vision
[35:20] at the beginning being caused to fly
[35:22] swiftly touched me about a time of the
[35:25] evil ablation and inform me and talk of

[35:32] beginning of ice application the
[35:34] commandment came forth and I have come
[35:36] to show D for the word greatly beloved
[35:38] therefore understand the matter and
[35:40] consider the vision or praising him the
[35:43] Lord after Daniel had that Buettner
[35:45] prayer o my the Spirit came upon Daniel
[35:48] praise God to speak to Daniel to reveal

[35:59] time a prayer a small time a prayer I
[36:01] just wanted you to connect the body I

[36:05] place on Friday night oh praise listen
[36:07] Oliver Graham says and remember at that
[36:10] great day of judgment your prayers will
[36:12] be counted just as much in that revival
[36:16] as my efforts would be double bring them
[36:21] there are people like free things
[36:24] everything free long-standing church
[36:27] maybe I wanted free free things yeah
[36:30] kind of recourse Jesus a revival cost
[36:34] there's a price for breakthrough there's
[36:37] a price victory that is why character is
[36:40] not a gift it's a victory it's not for
[36:42] free so don't come for look for no free
[36:45] ride don't look for anybody else to make
[36:47] the effort and you wait in the ride and
[36:49] jump in the anointing but you're praying
[36:52] you're not seeking God then that is why
[36:54] you won't be able to take a bit you in

[36:59] when you pass through a cornfield
[37:01] you can pick off the corn is not your

[1:05:27] of his glory
[1:05:27] and before him shall be gathered all
[1:05:30] nations and he shall separate them one
[1:05:32] from another as a shepherd as a shepherd
[1:05:35] divideth his sheep from the goats he
[1:05:38] shall set the sheep on his right hand
[1:05:40] the goats on the left then shall the
[1:05:44] King say unto them on his right hand
[1:05:46] come ye blessed of my father inherit the
[1:05:48] kingdom prepared for you from the

[1:06:28] of the least of these my brethren you

[1:07:21] the earth shall worship Him whose names
[1:07:23] are not written in the book of the life
[1:07:25] of the lamb slain from the foundation of
[1:07:26] the world may God bless his word you may
[1:07:28] be seated
[1:07:29] praise the Lord I really wish I wishes

[1:07:51] a Sunday message this is heavy but with
[1:08:00] but Branagh so this is a title for
[1:08:03] groups which one to be really

[1:08:34] I believe what a brand know is not that
[1:08:36] is what God said in this hour Jana
[1:08:39] remember the kingdom of heaven is like
[1:08:42] none to these virgins five were wise
[1:08:44] five were foolish which group you in the
[1:08:49] wise God oil
[1:08:51] the foolish did not get oil what group
[1:08:55] you in what group you want to be because
[1:08:59] some point in time somebody had again
[1:09:00] people are get desperate you must want
[1:09:03] to know that they line up with the
[1:09:05] scriptures the people I just say what
[1:09:08] side you're on
[1:09:09] what good hook you in what church you in
[1:09:11] this is not this is different a bit
[1:09:14] different he said you know if we live in
[1:09:16] the end time is the age that the
[1:09:18] churches are going to come together and
[1:09:19] as even now on trollin wool
[1:09:22] things they will soon control the
[1:09:25] finances of the world then if you don't
[1:09:28] belong to the World Organization of
[1:09:31] Churches you won't be able to buy or to
[1:09:33] sell you would lose all now these are
[1:09:38] weighted words tonight he said you would
[1:09:40] lose all those who stay true to God and
[1:09:44] keep their garments clean from the final
[1:09:47] men of this world system of church
[1:09:49] orders will be physically bereft there
[1:09:53] will be presented to them a great
[1:09:55] temptation to give him preachers will
[1:09:59] give in with the excuse that they will
[1:10:01] serve God within the framework of the
[1:10:04] Antichrist be system they will give into
[1:10:08] the flatteries and the blandishments of
[1:10:10] the hierarchy but the people will follow
[1:10:12] these false shepherds right into the
[1:10:14] slaughter but in the Judgment Day there
[1:10:17] will be found naked they will not be
[1:10:19] given microbes neither will they walk
[1:10:21] with him you can't walk in spotted
[1:10:24] garments of the world holding their
[1:10:26] hands with the devil here and then
[1:10:28] expect to be with God it is time to wake
[1:10:31] up and hear the voice of God crying come
[1:10:34] on tambour organisation religion and my
[1:10:37] people that you be not partakers of her
[1:10:39] sins God is speaking son the religions
[1:10:43] of this world like a Sunday plague leave
[1:10:46] off walking with the world and make your
[1:10:49] garments white by repentance and the
[1:10:51] better than do it no for tomorrow might
[1:10:55] be too late
[1:10:55] Oh glory to God he that overcometh I
[1:10:59] will not blot out his name out of the
[1:11:01] book of life hallelujah let's continue
[1:11:06] the possibility of the removal of a name
[1:11:09] from the records of God deserves more
[1:11:12] than a casual study for up until now
[1:11:15] most students have merely drawn a
[1:11:18] conclusion that God places the names of
[1:11:22] those born again within the Lamb's Book
[1:11:24] of Life at the time of the rebirth and
[1:11:26] if for any reason that name must be
[1:11:29] removed
[1:11:30] is on-the-record will simply be blank as
[1:11:34] it was before an email be placed there
[1:11:36] this is 100% opposite to what the world
[1:11:40] actually teaches at the very start of
[1:11:44] our study let it be known that there is
[1:11:47] not one scripture that teaches that God
[1:11:50] is presently compiling a record of names
[1:11:52] this was all done before the foundation
[1:11:56] of the world
[1:11:56] I feel pointed out shortly it's not a
[1:11:59] question of simply involving ourselves
[1:12:01] with two groups of people both of whom
[1:12:03] had the opportunity to receive it in a
[1:12:05] life where when one group received it
[1:12:07] and had their names placed on record and
[1:12:10] the others who refused it didn't have
[1:12:12] their names replaced we will actually
[1:12:14] show by scripture that multi-tools were
[1:12:18] not even born again we'll go into it in
[1:12:20] a life aha that's a big one multitudes
[1:12:27] will go on that are not even born again
[1:12:31] and get eternal life or is a big thing
[1:12:35] tonight this is not screamer tonight
[1:12:38] right we will also show that there's a
[1:12:41] group of people whose name
[1:12:44] haven't been placed on that record
[1:12:47] before the phone in the world cannot
[1:12:50] under any circumstances have those name
[1:12:53] removed and we will also show that
[1:13:00] another group who stays on that record
[1:13:02] before the foundation of the world will
[1:13:04] have their names removed to begin with
[1:13:06] there's no basis for the claim that the
[1:13:09] Lamb's Book of Life is not the same as
[1:13:11] the book of life the book of life might
[1:13:12] be called the Lamb's Book of Life or
[1:13:14] Christ book of life or even died book or
[1:13:16] the book of the living Unni names are
[1:13:17] written on it and the scripture he says
[1:13:20] quote revelation 13:8 all that dwell
[1:13:22] upon the earth shall worship Him the
[1:13:24] Beast
[1:13:24] whose names are not written in the book
[1:13:26] of life of the lamb slain from the
[1:13:28] foundation of the world
[1:13:30] revelation 20:12 215 I saw the dead
[1:13:33] small and great stand before God and the
[1:13:36] books are open and another book was
[1:13:37] opened which is the book of life and the
[1:13:39] dead would
[1:13:40] out of those things which are written in
[1:13:42] the books according to their works
[1:13:44] under sea gave up the Dead which were in
[1:13:46] it and death and hell but delivered up
[1:13:47] the Dead which were in them and they
[1:13:49] were judged every man according to their
[1:13:51] works and death and he'll were cast into
[1:13:54] the lake of fire this is the second
[1:13:56] death many people don't even know
[1:13:57] there's a second death the first that is
[1:14:00] easy but every man that has died will be
[1:14:03] resurrected to be judged Oh hallelujah
[1:14:07] oh yeah tango tonight for the blood you
[1:14:11] can't go out for Jesus pin and accept
[1:14:13] him your judgment and my judgment and
[1:14:16] take upon himself dying on the cross
[1:14:18] that we could go three tonight that's
[1:14:21] why you should worship Him that's why
[1:14:23] you should give them praise that's why
[1:14:25] you should never come in the house of
[1:14:27] God with herself with the throng with
[1:14:30] any bad attitude or glory to God
[1:14:33] hallelujah you can see that door there
[1:14:39] are other books mentioned there is
[1:14:41] always the reference to one book
[1:14:43] container names it has caused the lamb
[1:14:45] Book of Life or the book of life then
[1:14:49] where is this book located scripture
[1:14:52] Luke's 1017 to 2400 centimeters with joy
[1:14:56] sin Lord even the Devils are subject
[1:14:58] unto us should I name he said unto them
[1:15:00] I beheld Satan as lightning fall from
[1:15:03] heaven behold I give you power to tread
[1:15:05] on serpents and scorpions and over all
[1:15:07] the power of the enemy and nothing shall
[1:15:09] by any means hurt you
[1:15:10] notwithstanding and this rejoice not
[1:15:12] that the spirits are subject unto you
[1:15:15] but rather rejoice because your name are
[1:15:18] written in heaven or glory the Gordon
[1:15:20] that always Jesus rejoice in the spirit
[1:15:23] and said I thank thee O Father Lord of
[1:15:25] Heaven and Earth that I was hid these
[1:15:27] things from the wise and the prudent and
[1:15:30] as we read them unto babes such as well
[1:15:33] hallelujah even so father it seemed good
[1:15:36] in thy sight or did the Lord a shout
[1:15:40] hallelujah so this book of life is
[1:15:43] located in heaven and will appear the
[1:15:46] white throne judgment in these verses
[1:15:48] Jesus said the names were written in
[1:15:50] heaven they were written in the book
[1:15:52] don't rejoice because Devils have taken
[1:15:55] to you but rejoice because your name is
[1:15:57] in heaven
[1:15:57] that's right if you know your name is in
[1:15:59] heaven if you know your name is written
[1:16:02] every service should be rejoicing just
[1:16:05] to have the opportunity do not worship
[1:16:07] in the beasts
[1:16:08] you're not worshiping some false prophet
[1:16:11] you're not worship in this world system
[1:16:12] or give the Lord a shout no wonder he
[1:16:16] said bring them seven thunders come
[1:16:18] forth then you'll be worshiping the
[1:16:20] Living Christ moving in and out among us
[1:16:23] but are we are fighting for every
[1:16:25] promise that God promised in this hour
[1:16:28] Oh glory to God amen hallelujah praise
[1:16:33] God hallelujah praise God praise God
[1:16:38] now notice hallelujah Judas was one of
[1:16:41] those who were cast no Devils in Jesus
[1:16:43] name
[1:16:44] and we know that he was a devil son of
[1:16:46] perdition and Jesus said he that
[1:16:48] watcheth need not wash his feet but is
[1:16:51] clean every whit but you are crema not
[1:16:52] all but he knew who would betray him
[1:16:55] therefore he said you're not all clean I
[1:16:57] speak not of you all I know whom I am
[1:16:59] chosen under study scripture may be
[1:17:02] fulfilled
[1:17:03] these are eat that bread with me have
[1:17:04] lifted up his heel heel against me
[1:17:07] now if language means anything we must
[1:17:11] admit that Judas was chosen by Jesus yet
[1:17:15] he was not clean
[1:17:16] Oh glory to God hallelujah Judas was
[1:17:20] also given to Jesus by the father
[1:17:23] hallelujah notice that given is the
[1:17:27] exact parallel as the illustration of
[1:17:29] Moses and Pharaoh Jacob and Esau due
[1:17:31] east on Pharaoh Abbas for known they
[1:17:34] were predestinated a rat portable repres
[1:17:38] hallelujah and elect even to them that
[1:17:41] stumble at the word being disobedient
[1:17:43] Judas was numbered with the twelve and
[1:17:45] actually had a pact with them in the
[1:17:48] ministry previous the Pentecost
[1:17:51] or glory to God so those faithful

[1:18:32] Holy One by the most of the image speak
[1:18:33] and he was numbered with us and obtained
[1:18:36] part of this ministry the part that
[1:18:38] Judas obtained among the 12 and then
[1:18:41] lost was neither inferior to the
[1:18:44] Ministry of the other level
[1:18:46] no was it a devilish foreign ministry
[1:18:49] interjected among the ministry of the
[1:18:51] others so he was anointed and
[1:18:57] commissioned or get the Lord I shall do

[1:19:04] may take part in this ministry and
[1:19:06] Apostleship from which Judas by
[1:19:09] transgression fell that he might go to
[1:19:11] his own place

[1:19:16] Ghost ministry and kill themselves and

[1:22:04] caught descriptive II read I beheld
[1:22:06] until the truth were tossed down and the
[1:22:08] engines of these did sit whose garment
[1:22:10] was white as snow
[1:22:12] Oh glory to God hallelujah so you're a

[1:23:20] arises why are these righteous ones in
[1:23:24] judgment there is no other place they
[1:23:26] can come in for they are not - they are
[1:23:30] just about to resurrections and since
[1:23:32] they could not qualify for the first
[1:23:35] resurrection they must come in the
[1:23:38] second resurrection unto judgment so the
[1:23:44] second resurrection is a resurrection of
[1:23:46] the judgment not the first one because
[1:23:50] the bride already judged and Christ
[1:23:52] Jesus the bride will not be judged the
[1:23:55] bride cannot be judge she will be with
[1:23:57] the judge okay the Lord a shout
[1:23:59] the bride is justified did you hear that
[1:24:05] the bride is justified as if she never
[1:24:09] did it in the first place
[1:24:11] [Applause]
[1:24:14] hallelujah today my stomach missile
[1:24:22] resurrection the ones who qualify for
[1:24:24] the first resurrection is the bride and
[1:24:26] I'm not in judgment and he could have
[1:24:29] scripted for at the back adoption John
[1:24:30] 5:24 verily unto you he that heareth my
[1:24:32] voice that believe on him that sent me
[1:24:34] hath everlasting life which is I believe
[1:24:37] a recipient of eternal life he is a
[1:24:39] possession of it right now and shall not
[1:24:42] come into judgment hallelujah but
[1:24:45] inspired from death unto life
[1:24:47] so Jesus must have yet another in mind a
[1:24:51] certain resurrection will receive
[1:24:54] eternal life they will receive it at
[1:24:56] that resurrection not having previously
[1:24:59] as a member of the bride and to prove
[1:25:03] that he ever scripture for that John
[1:25:05] 5:22 29 marvel at this for the hour is
[1:25:10] coming this is Jesus in which all data
[1:25:13] in the graves shall hear his voice all
[1:25:17] all and shall come forth
[1:25:20] neither have done good unto the
[1:25:22] resurrection of life and they that have
[1:25:25] done evil unto the resurrection of
[1:25:26] damnation but all could hear that voice
[1:25:29] and to thankful to God tonight that you
[1:25:33] hearing the voice of God in the last
[1:25:35] days or glory of God you hear in his
[1:25:38] voice no you hear in the wood of the
[1:25:40] Spirit no God speaking to you know
[1:25:43] because the electrons the ability to
[1:25:46] hear direct from God give the Lord a
[1:25:50] show
[1:25:52] [Applause]
[1:25:57] you as he left have the ability from God
[1:26:04] or glory to God you are hearing from God
[1:26:07] tonight because God is the word and if
[1:26:11] you hear the word and receive the word
[1:26:12] you came from God that's the ability
[1:26:15] that God put in the lick hallelujah
[1:26:19] we all know that John 5:22 29 is not the
[1:26:24] rapture I just hope you just read for
[1:26:27] only the dead in Christ shall arise on
[1:26:29] the graves at the time along with the
[1:26:31] Living bride who still sits on the earth
[1:26:34] let's see back the scripture we just
[1:26:36] read Marvel not that this for the always
[1:26:38] come in which all that are in the graves
[1:26:41] shall hear his voice and shall come for
[1:26:43] dinner of good or the resolution of life
[1:26:45] till have done evil unto the resident
[1:26:47] damnation that nothing rapture does not
[1:26:50] e rupture the rupture is 1st
[1:26:52] Thessalonians 4 for the Lord himself
[1:26:54] shall sing for me with a shout and the
[1:26:58] voice of the Archangel and with the
[1:27:00] Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[1:27:03] shall rise first and we which are alive
[1:27:06] and remain shall be caught up together
[1:27:09] with them in the clouds to meet the lord
[1:27:12] in the air or get the Lord a shock
[1:27:16] hallelujah glory to God amen hallelujah
[1:27:21] let me get a lot of shots again
[1:27:24] because you wanna be caught up to meet
[1:27:27] them you have one of these change in a
[1:27:30] moment in a pickle and I I believe that
[1:27:33] I'm gonna preach that oh praise God
[1:27:37] praise God hallelujah you may be seated
[1:27:44] we now face the question as to why this
[1:27:48] should be given eternal life at the
[1:27:51] judgement since the epistles seen the
[1:27:55] conclusively point out that one must
[1:27:58] possess the Spirit of Christ or perish
[1:28:01] though it seemed us we must not
[1:28:04] discredit the words of Jesus who most
[1:28:07] pointedly sets forth that there are some
[1:28:10] found in the book of life who will
[1:28:13] either receive eternal life before the
[1:28:16] general direction or after it Paul does
[1:28:19] not evade this truth for he clearly says
[1:28:22] in Philippians tree-level
[1:28:23] if by any means I might attain the
[1:28:27] resurrection of the dead now this
[1:28:29] statement is very peculiar we all know
[1:28:32] and we are all going to be in a
[1:28:34] resurrection whether we want to be or
[1:28:36] not all will be resurrected
[1:28:39] so Paul could hardly be seen is by any
[1:28:43] means I might attain a resurrection of
[1:28:46] the dead the truth of the matter is he's
[1:28:48] not seeing that the literal realness if
[1:28:51] by any means I might attain to the out
[1:28:55] resurrection from among the dead this is
[1:28:59] not the opinion to the general or self
[1:29:01] second resurrection but attending to the
[1:29:03] first resurrection and which he said
[1:29:06] blessed and holy is he who are passing
[1:29:08] the first resurrection on such the
[1:29:10] second death no power or glory to God
[1:29:14] hallelujah praise God
[1:29:16] don't you feel inspired tonight all
[1:29:19] glory to God hallelujah
[1:29:21] hallelujah oh praise God let's continue
[1:29:24] he said no but they should I be like
[1:29:26] priests of God and Christ shall reign
[1:29:28] with him a thousand years the first
[1:29:30] resurrection has nothing to do with the
[1:29:32] second death that is at the end of a
[1:29:34] thousand years when all the rest of the
[1:29:36] Dead live again and in that day there
[1:29:38] will be those who come forth to eternal
[1:29:40] life and those others who are caught in
[1:29:42] the second death no we do not need to
[1:29:44] guess about those who are in the second
[1:29:46] resurrection are given life we are told
[1:29:48] it is given to them on the ground that
[1:29:52] they are being kind and good to the
[1:29:54] Brethren this is something worthwhile
[1:30:00] noting a long time I've heard this but
[1:30:03] this is some type something with Van
[1:30:05] Noten we are told it is given to them
[1:30:08] underground they are being kind and good
[1:30:11] to the Brethren those who are raised and
[1:30:13] cast a lake of fire will be so treated
[1:30:15] because of their mistreatment of the
[1:30:18] bredrin
[1:30:18] or test the Lord I show which group are
[1:30:22] you in which people because some
[1:30:25] everybody's gonna be in a group
[1:30:27] everybody give the Lord a shock if you
[1:30:32] never heard that before you're having it
[1:30:34] now Oh glory to God Amen hallelujah
[1:30:45] since this is the will of the Lord we
[1:30:47] simply accepted there is no argument
[1:30:50] here just a simple statement of fact we
[1:30:55] read the scripture when Jesus fasted
[1:30:57] eternal life he said when I was hungry
[1:30:59] you feed me when I was naked you clothed
[1:31:01] me and they say but when we do that he
[1:31:03] said when you do they literally Lisa
[1:31:05] them you Jesus turned to me Oh
[1:31:07] hallelujah
[1:31:09] all glory to God hallelujah praise God
[1:31:12] the rest was the direct opposite let's
[1:31:15] continue the further clarify notice
[1:31:19] specifically go on alike that porn
[1:31:28] the words in Matthew 25:31 to 46 which
[1:31:31] is what we read it does not see that a
[1:31:34] shepherd is literally separating sheep
[1:31:36] from goats but it is as a shepherd
[1:31:39] dividing sheep from goats
[1:31:41] these are not sheep in this particular
[1:31:43] area of time why turn judgment the sheep
[1:31:46] are already in his fold they heard his
[1:31:49] voice they followed him they already
[1:31:51] have eternal life and he are not come
[1:31:54] into judgment but these do not have it
[1:31:59] in life they are in judgment they are
[1:32:02] allowed to go into eternal life but upon
[1:32:05] what grounds to the enter into life
[1:32:07] eternal
[1:32:08] certainly not upon the fact that they
[1:32:09] already have this life as does the bride
[1:32:11] but they receive it because it was time
[1:32:14] to his brethren they are not his
[1:32:17] brethren that will make them join us
[1:32:19] with Jesus they are not asked anything
[1:32:22] but life they share note role except
[1:32:26] over him their names must have been in
[1:32:29] the book of life are not removed but
[1:32:31] because of the love of the people of God
[1:32:34] they are recognized and saved oh man
[1:32:39] should know you know who you are I know
[1:32:42] you know people gonna treat you based
[1:32:44] upon who you are I will be saved and
[1:32:47] receive eternal life because of who you
[1:32:49] are okay the Lord a shout if the dead
[1:32:52] know who you are
[1:32:53] you better know who you are tonight Oh
[1:32:55] glory to God you are mrs. Jesus Christ
[1:32:58] okay the Lord show scallywags in us
[1:33:01] somewhere he put your name on the book
[1:33:04] he said mark I thought to call you out
[1:33:10] let's continue cause of their love of
[1:33:14] the people of God they are recognized
[1:33:16] and save no doubt these save that help
[1:33:19] the chin of God perhaps like Nicodemus
[1:33:21] and Gamaliel they stood for the cheer in
[1:33:23] a time of trouble it's this seem smack
[1:33:26] of restoration watch carefully now for
[1:33:28] the wicked and not restored but turn
[1:33:31] into the lake of fire the names of many
[1:33:34] of those destroyed within the book of
[1:33:36] rice also but they were blotted out
[1:33:38] because they fail to honor the people of
[1:33:41] God who are the Living manifested word
[1:33:45] living epistle for their day oh you mean
[1:33:49] the bride could be the living manifested
[1:33:51] for this day your meal is not walking
[1:33:53] wrong with the book enough tape and say
[1:33:55] what you believe but it has to be the
[1:33:57] winner in the individual voices I
[1:34:16] believe that you know or you had except
[1:34:19] the other group if you don't want to
[1:34:25] accept that you have to become the Word
[1:34:28] made flesh then you have to find the
[1:34:30] next group you never said I know my
[1:34:31] group keeps spinning and see if you find
[1:34:33] a group it's only for it not 24 you know
[1:34:38] just for so you could pick which one
[1:34:41] that's what they want know what type L
[1:34:44] so which one now let's be clear here
[1:34:48] these are not Nations being judged and
[1:34:50] going to the Millennium because they
[1:34:52] have harbored and at the Jews this is
[1:34:55] very clear because of the conclusion of
[1:34:57] these verses that these do mintage shall
[1:34:59] go into everlasting punishment but the
[1:35:01] righteous into everlasting life there is
[1:35:03] no record of two judgments set where the
[1:35:05] wicked a cast on a lake of fire only the
[1:35:07] beast and the false prophet at the judge
[1:35:11] at the end of the Great Tribulation this
[1:35:14] is the white throne judgment and they
[1:35:17] are judged according to what is written
[1:35:19] in the book
[1:35:20] in the second recollection that's the
[1:35:22] souls under the altar that's in the
[1:35:25] fifth seal them coming second
[1:35:26] resurrection the carbonyl or voice how
[1:35:29] long Lord how long does not judge and
[1:35:31] avenge our blood these Jews under this
[1:35:32] altar we know that note particularly
[1:35:35] that none of these under the altar were
[1:35:37] killed for the testimony of Jesus they
[1:35:39] were not like Antipas who was slain for
[1:35:40] holiness fascist name these are not born
[1:35:42] again one but it's in life as a
[1:35:44] possession they come in the resurrection
[1:35:45] and receive life because of their stand
[1:35:48] on the word notice how these are crying
[1:35:51] for vengeance they cannot be bright
[1:35:53] material that speaks volume nail them
[1:36:04] Jewish Canon for vengeance he said
[1:36:05] dynamite material so any person in this
[1:36:08] message sign of a vengeance you know
[1:36:09] we're on it you know accordion right
[1:36:11] then not in this bright group because
[1:36:14] the bride don't call for vengeance is
[1:36:18] mine saith the Lord I will repair the
[1:36:21] break your contract the bride will turn
[1:36:24] the other cheek give the Lord a show
[1:36:27] [Applause]
[1:36:28] [Music]
[1:36:30] [Applause]
[1:36:36] [Music]
[1:36:45] the bright the bright
[1:36:47] turn-the-other-cheek they have to
[1:36:49] because they are they have to watch so
[1:36:52] these Jews and born of the Spirit they
[1:36:54] don't even believe that Jesus is Messiah
[1:36:56] but they were blinded by God for the
[1:36:58] Gentiles seek God give them eternal life
[1:37:00] on the grounds that though they could
[1:37:02] not come to him they were truly faithful
[1:37:04] to all the word the new and died under
[1:37:11] Stalin and Hitler and yet they will die
[1:37:13] it is the second resurrection where in
[1:37:15] the five foolish virgins to come up oh
[1:37:19] my goodness this five foolish virgins
[1:37:23] Immunization they not denomination let's
[1:37:32] continue they they did not have the Holy
[1:37:35] Spirit so they miss been in the bride
[1:37:38] while the five wise who had oil became a
[1:37:41] part of that bride but these people
[1:37:44] being separated God loving people trying
[1:37:46] to abide in the world according to what
[1:37:48] they knew of it and I help in the work
[1:37:50] of the Lord will come at the end of time
[1:37:53] they will miss the Millennium which you
[1:37:55] can begin to see by these truths is more
[1:37:58] important and wonderful than we ever
[1:38:00] thought or belief though that you hear
[1:38:03] at this all I want to miss it that come
[1:38:06] like have a big banquet downstairs and
[1:38:07] you go home to drink water and Dom says
[1:38:11] have all seven course menu layout here

[1:38:16] and water and a thesis there it have a
[1:38:21] wedding supper yellow animal in am
[1:38:24] honeymoon
[1:38:25] this is more wonderful he said then we
[1:38:28] could think I imagine you don't want to
[1:38:31] miss it
[1:38:31] which group pool in there or give the
[1:38:34] Lord a shout hallelujah hallelujah don't
[1:38:40] be afraid hallelujah glory to God you
[1:38:44] could imagine know when you hit that
[1:38:46] scripture his wife a bit as already when
[1:38:49] you come into the church nobody could
[1:38:50] touch you no more because you know
[1:38:52] atmosphere all by yourself because you
[1:38:55] know who your husband is
[1:38:57] you know who you worship your know by
[1:39:01] your worship oh my let's continue
[1:39:04] Oh glory to God hallelujah listen all
[1:39:09] these people are their names in the book
[1:39:11] of life and their names remain but whose
[1:39:13] names did not remain those of the world
[1:39:16] system churches who fought the bride
[1:39:20] will be tools whose names are removed
[1:39:23] that is who will lose out they will be
[1:39:26] cast into the lake of fire so let's go
[1:39:29] to another step he said let's review our
[1:39:31] case thus far let's review these four
[1:39:33] groups one first of all we know
[1:39:36] assuredly that the purpose of God stands

[1:45:14] Israel's covenant Egypt these had their
[1:45:17] names in the book of life and their
[1:45:18] works written in the books these haven't
[1:45:21] field to obey God being void of the
[1:45:23] Spirit - even the signs and wonders
[1:45:25] among them will have their names removed
[1:45:27] from the book of life amongst that group
[1:45:29] you'll find us entirely void of the
[1:45:32] Spirit religious will have manifestation
[1:45:35] in their lives although the books were
[1:45:37] not elected in him such as Balaam will
[1:45:39] be in that group and the fourth will be
[1:45:41] finally boys whose things have never
[1:45:43] been or never will ever be written in
[1:45:45] the book or give the Lord a shout

[1:49:20] let's continue let's come to this is
[1:49:21] took two good hallelujah yes a little
[1:49:24] more since this portion of the word is
[1:49:27] hard for the human migrants or this
[1:49:33] profit is good oh my goodness is this
[1:49:36] this is good it must be accepted and
[1:49:39] believed by feet somewhere be offended
[1:49:42] by what I have set forth because they
[1:49:44] fail to understand the sovereignty of
[1:49:47] God which sets forth that God is God and
[1:49:50] because he is God one cannot defeat his
[1:49:53] concerts or thwart his will and purpose
[1:49:56] but he being omnipotent
[1:49:59] is ruling in all affairs and is doing
[1:50:01] whatever he will with all his creation
[1:50:04] because all were created for his good
[1:50:07] pleasure
[1:50:08] therefore Paul said if God to take one
[1:50:11] lump of clay and make that seem love one
[1:50:14] vessel unto honor and another vessel
[1:50:16] unto dishonour
[1:50:17] who can be offended and cry against him
[1:50:20] that he has the right to do on the
[1:50:23] grounds of creation alone we cannot deny
[1:50:26] he hath he went even further according
[1:50:28] to Roman's 14 sin 9 we have the
[1:50:31] irrefutable proof that Jesus paid the
[1:50:33] purchase price of the whole world
[1:50:36] therefore you can do as you will with
[1:50:38] his own and none of us liveth to himself
[1:50:43] Norman died himself but whether we live
[1:50:46] we live unto the Lord whether we die we
[1:50:48] die unto the Lord whether we live
[1:50:49] therefore or die we are the Lord's okay
[1:50:54] the Lord I show you are being purchased
[1:50:56] you have been bought with a price do you
[1:51:01] get that tonight you are not your own
[1:51:03] keep a feel listen listen when the angel
[1:51:13] crowd who is worthy who is worthy and no
[1:51:15] man was from worthy and the lamb stood
[1:51:17] for bloody bleeding he said I died for
[1:51:20] them I come for a book I pay the price I
[1:51:23] come to bring back this inheritance from
[1:51:25] yet from my wife all glory of God you
[1:51:28] turn like a show tonight
[1:51:30] I grab restaurant tonight I can't
[1:51:32] worship tonight when the lamb took the
[1:51:35] book no wonder John say all in heaven
[1:51:42] Oh glory to God hallelujah we have
[1:51:45] enough crazy when I saw this tonight
[1:51:47] [Applause]
[1:51:51] somebody about it is that this end
[1:52:06] Christ both died and rose and revived
[1:52:08] but he might be the Lord pour out the
[1:52:11] dead and the living
[1:52:13] yes yes revolution here
[1:52:15] he said ownership not relationship is
[1:52:17] meant yet he is Lord over the river and
[1:52:21] the dead not relationship relationship
[1:52:23] with his bride but honest over all
[1:52:26] that's why when he speak every man-jack
[1:52:28] coming up all go be raised from the dead
[1:52:31] to be judged
[1:52:32] what poopa you will be in hallelujah
[1:52:42] hallelujah I'm almost done the quote
[1:52:49] Ephesians that's in the dispensation of
[1:52:52] the fullness of times he by karateka in
[1:52:54] one all things in Christ both which and
[1:52:56] have done even him in whom we are
[1:52:59] obtained an inheritance being
[1:53:00] predestinated according to the purpose
[1:53:02] of him who worketh all things after the
[1:53:05] counsel of his own will thus if God so
[1:53:08] designed that there are those whose
[1:53:11] names are pleased in the section of the
[1:53:13] book of life that cannot be raised for
[1:53:16] the other names of his bride then we
[1:53:18] must accept it also states that there
[1:53:21] are those who names are placed in the
[1:53:22] record but in the foreknowledge of God
[1:53:24] they would have fail and have those name
[1:53:26] removed we must accept that and if there
[1:53:29] are those who name up there was those
[1:53:31] whole names was never placed on the
[1:53:35] record of life we must accept that also
[1:53:38] Oh Harlan
[1:53:40] or glory to God my God my God
[1:53:52] let's continue to understand this
[1:53:55] subject raise a cup of it even more
[1:54:01] clearly it will be wise to approach it
[1:54:06] from the standpoint of the church
[1:54:07] through the ages remember some time us
[1:54:10] talk about conversion and people don't
[1:54:13] want to convert and the jesting and
[1:54:14] things are literally if they go to
[1:54:16] Mexico you can't use $30
[1:54:18] yeah they converted to pieces so if you
[1:54:22] want to build the house the materials
[1:54:26] called building materials but around
[1:54:28] call them virtues building materials if
[1:54:31] you want to go into the King's presence
[1:54:33] they become steps you're not building
[1:54:37] materials one with the king
[1:54:38] you have seven steps to go up to the
[1:54:42] King because he's only seven step isn't
[1:54:44] that right
[1:54:45] if you want to see to the edges you need
[1:54:47] eyes so all of a sudden you have seven
[1:54:49] eyes and you want to see edges here one
[1:54:52] seven horns so is the currency of the
[1:54:56] conversion to what effect that you want
[1:54:59] now you can't preach spirit to preach
[1:55:01] the world and they would tell in the
[1:55:03] spirit know there are three Bibles the
[1:55:05] zodiac this physical Bible in the
[1:55:07] pyramid but you're capricious area you
[1:55:10] can't preach pyramid but you can preach
[1:55:11] the word and if this would come into you
[1:55:14] you have the pyramid you you have to buy
[1:55:17] all glory love God
[1:55:19] so brother Branham taking the book of
[1:55:21] life now and we bring in a different
[1:55:23] reference on a point to bring clarity
[1:55:25] for all what I've said of these four
[1:55:27] groups already
[1:55:29] just a little more again another finish
[1:55:31] let's go
[1:55:33] that's watch here what you see now to
[1:55:36] understand this now we want to consider
[1:55:38] not even Fisher now but the groups
[1:55:41] represented in the church to do this we
[1:55:44] would like the church to the ages Tobit
[1:55:47] plant a grain of wheat is planted to the
[1:55:50] end that a single grain of wheat will
[1:55:52] reproduce
[1:55:53] by itself to a certain process and
[1:55:55] during a certain period of time that
[1:55:57] single seed will die and in time the
[1:56:00] light that was in it will come up into a
[1:56:01] plant which in turn will be the bearer
[1:56:04] or they carry of that life which is to
[1:56:05] come back to originality and
[1:56:07] multi-platform Jesus the great royal
[1:56:10] seed died the massless one who is the
[1:56:13] life of the church stands in the midst
[1:56:15] of the Church of all seventy ages given
[1:56:20] his life to the church the carrier or
[1:56:22] the bearer to the end that this very
[1:56:24] life will be repetition bodies like unto
[1:56:27] his in the resurrection it is at the
[1:56:30] resurrection that the royal seal will
[1:56:32] see many royal sees that come to himself
[1:56:34] so this is not already it the real glory
[1:56:37] will be ready at the resurrection where
[1:56:40] we shall see him like he is and we shall
[1:56:43] be like him okay the Lord I show this
[1:56:46] miserable fresh body I like him but in
[1:56:49] that resurrection we are going to be
[1:56:51] like this mortality this corruption put
[1:57:01] on interruption and be a change or
[1:57:04] glorious God
[1:57:05] let's continue we shall be like him no
[1:57:08] that is what John the Baptist was
[1:57:10] referring to that Jesus will gather the
[1:57:13] wheat into his gonna that was the
[1:57:16] resurrection where the redeemed who had
[1:57:19] been elected into life came in know the
[1:57:23] record of this wheat plant here we go
[1:57:25] whose end is to reproduce the original
[1:57:27] seed in multiplatform is the book of
[1:57:30] life so he is confessing it the holy
[1:57:34] plant he generated it is the book of
[1:57:37] life are you with me
[1:57:39] I repeat the history all record of this
[1:57:43] wheat plant is the book of life of which
[1:57:45] a path of the book of life is the record
[1:57:48] of eternal life a section of the book of
[1:57:50] life
[1:57:51] this is unflinchingly seen by examining
[1:57:54] the wheat plant a seed is sown so when I
[1:57:57] play this scene that is not to beat yet
[1:57:59] it grows into a stalk that is not a week
[1:58:02] yet life is there but not to reach
[1:58:04] then at the end of the store is a little
[1:58:07] spike that's another tassel still are we
[1:58:09] plant but no bit yet then the plant is
[1:58:12] Paula nice we see the child grow it
[1:58:14] looks mighty and the wheat but has not
[1:58:16] yet seed then forms a wheat in the husk
[1:58:19] it is now back to what is all originally
[1:58:21] know the ripen wheat is harvested Jesus
[1:58:24] died almost finish to bear with me and
[1:58:27] anybody sleeping just gave a big shock
[1:58:29] there's just no sleeping right now we're
[1:58:31] almost done
[1:58:31] alright so Jesus Christ died you give
[1:58:34] his life that life was to come back upon
[1:58:37] the church here we go and bring many
[1:58:39] sons like unto himself unto the glory in
[1:58:42] the resurrection but as the wheat seed
[1:58:44] have to have a carrier to bring forth
[1:58:48] multiplied with seed even so there had
[1:58:50] to be a church which would be a carrier
[1:58:53] of the life of Christ the blade stock
[1:58:57] tassel husk were the carriers for the
[1:59:00] seed but not the seed itself so the
[1:59:03] church cooperate truly ages have been a
[1:59:06] carrier of the true seed though not the
[1:59:08] seed itself that is why we can say the
[1:59:11] book of life is the whole wheat plant or
[1:59:15] give the Lord a shout do you catch it
[1:59:17] tonight let's go over it again here is
[1:59:20] the original seed that was planted it
[1:59:22] produces a bleed that wasn't it if it is
[1:59:24] a store not at either he had come husk
[1:59:26] we to form the tassel appears then the
[1:59:29] pollen falls on something on those
[1:59:31] Pistons part of that plant is quickened
[1:59:33] something of the original seed came to
[1:59:35] the rest of the plant turns in the seed
[1:59:37] why didn't the whole pan go into seed
[1:59:41] because it was created to that end just
[1:59:45] part of that plant can go back to being
[1:59:48] seed because that part of the wheat
[1:59:51] grant is eternal life wheat
[1:59:53] [Applause]
[1:59:58] do you see it all the other processes
[2:00:02] carriers but that part come back to eat
[2:00:05] is the original grain that's the bad old
[2:00:10] glory to God
[2:00:12] he sent the prophet amos back original
[2:00:16] faith the original seed the original
[2:00:20] life all let's finish off here now
[2:00:23] well glory to God he said you have a
[2:00:25] perfect type Israel even Egypt the chemo
[2:00:28] 2 million strong all escaped the
[2:00:31] sacrificial blood or a baptized on the
[2:00:33] Red Sea all came out of the water and
[2:00:34] join holy spirit manifestations all
[2:00:36] angel food all drunk of the rock yeah
[2:00:39] except for few they were not but tires
[2:00:44] all Israel is not Israel all but a tiny
[2:00:48] minority and their names are blotted out
[2:00:50] of the book of life we have the same
[2:00:52] thing right in the church names are
[2:00:55] going to be blotted out of the book of
[2:00:57] life no names every blood another book
[2:00:59] of the eternal life for that is another
[2:01:02] record that contained in the book this
[2:01:05] is the record God had given us eternal
[2:01:07] life and that life is in his son he had
[2:01:10] hacked the Sun had the life oh my
[2:01:13] breaking he could come
[2:01:15] oh my you're being a tremendous audience
[2:01:17] tonight you applaud my mind I thought
[2:01:21] this might be too much for tonight
[2:01:23] but praise God praise God praise God
[2:01:27] hallelujah
[2:01:28] in concluding in concluding this for
[2:01:31] this time let me further statement that
[2:01:34] are merely beginning when I said that
[2:01:37] not one scripture spoke the Lord
[2:01:38] presently compiled in a record of names
[2:01:41] that is indeed so Oh hallelujah
[2:01:45] oh my talk about a roll call he said the
[2:01:48] rapture is not the only roll call the
[2:01:50] rapture will be a roll call
[2:01:52] Oh glory to God I will endure hear that
[2:01:55] voice Oh glory
[2:01:57] when he speaks you can take Jerry's
[2:02:01] voice or glory the shot about Oh
[2:02:06] hallelujah
[2:02:08] Oh glory to God amen oh my mind mind
[2:02:13] mind the rapture is not the only world
[2:02:15] called there's a second resurrection of
[2:02:17] the white tone judgment will names the
[2:02:19] confessed before the fallen angels and
[2:02:20] I've been told by those who know that
[2:02:22] the sweetest song to a human ear it's a
[2:02:26] song of that pieces name how people love
[2:02:29] to have their names before the public
[2:02:30] how they love a clean but no earthly
[2:02:32] voice will ever song your name as
[2:02:34] sweetly as well the voice of God if your
[2:02:38] name is in the book of life
[2:02:40] and remains there to be revealed before
[2:02:44] his holy angels what a day that will be
[2:02:46] when we are Jesus a father they confess
[2:02:49] my name before men in the days of the
[2:02:52] earthly pilgrimage no I will confess
[2:02:54] their name before thee and all the
[2:02:56] heavenly angels he that hath an ear let
[2:02:58] him hear what the Spirit says to the
[2:03:01] churches
[2:03:01] once more the Spirit has spoken once
[2:03:05] again we have reviewed a record of what
[2:03:07] the Spirit set another age and we have
[2:03:09] found the record correct
[2:03:11] another age has gone by it must fulfill
[2:03:13] exactly as he said it would be what a
[2:03:15] consolation that is to us who hope to be
[2:03:18] in the last debride for it causes our
[2:03:20] hearts to leap for joy that he is
[2:03:22] faithful and will perform every promise
[2:03:24] if he was faithful and true the doors in
[2:03:27] his audition age then he will be just as
[2:03:29] true in our age if they're by His grace
[2:03:32] and power will receive the commandment
[2:03:33] by him so will we let us go therefore to
[2:03:35] perfection and meet the Lord in the air
[2:03:37] and be forever be with him let's all
