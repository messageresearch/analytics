[34:51] come out to believe the message of
[34:53] justification but unless somebody come
[34:56] and preach it
[34:57] there would no one be saved and how can
[35:00] a man preach unless he been sent so God
[35:03] had to have one sent from the Catholic
[35:05] church he couldn't find nobody he looked
[35:08] up he looked low he looked down but he
[35:10] needed a messenger oh to proclaim the
[35:13] day of the the um uh the word of the
[35:15] Lord for that day isn't that right so
[35:18] you went to the Catholic Church got a
[35:19] priest but the name of Martin Luther all
[35:22] the Bibles written in Latin so nobody
[35:25] knows what's going on but he is the only
[35:28] one who could read it he's the only one
[35:30] who can understand it and God
[35:32] predestinated Martin Luther to interpret
[35:35] the word for that day that the just
[35:38] should live by
[35:40] faith Hallelujah say Amen somebody oh
[35:45] not but the priest sprinkle on you not
[35:47] by 10 amens and our fathers but by faith
[35:50] the just shall live by faith oh
[35:53] Hallelujah and he shook the Catholic
[35:55] Church oh Hallelujah Wesley shook the
[35:58] church in his day the Pentecostal what
[36:00] about a bride on the earth who has the
[36:03] fullness of the word
[36:04] restored oh Hal this Earth is in first

[36:30] God Amen Hallelujah so amen let's get to
[36:33] the word amen
[36:36] hallelujah amen so for a title this
[36:39] morning
[36:40] amen uh I have a title one taken one
[36:44] left that's my title this morning amen
[36:47] for inspiration I chose men and Brethren
[36:49] what shall we do to be saved amen what
[36:52] shall we do to be saved amen praise
[36:56] praise God so we read from Matthew 24
[36:58] isn't that right Jesus talking about the
[37:00] end of the world and prior to that uh
[37:03] Jesus was blasting the Pharisees and the
[37:05] different ones the Hypocrites and so on
[37:06] in Matthew
[37:07] 23 and um after he was finished doing
[37:11] that the disciples they were walking
[37:13] around Jerusalem and Bible says that um
[37:16] they were showing the Lord great
[37:18] buildings in Jerusalem isn't that right
[37:21] they were they were sightseeing
[37:22] basically amen taking selfies and
[37:26] somebody had the I of Jerusalem t-shirt
[37:28] amen and they walking around with the
[37:29] caps and different things and you know
[37:31] taking pictures stuff like that doing a
[37:33] little tour and showing Jesus you know
[37:35] this is a building for this and this is
[37:37] this building and this is the national
[37:38] Treasury and everything else and they in
[37:41] that atmosphere amen they they're like
[37:43] tourists you know going around and
[37:45] seeing the different sites but Jesus
[37:47] wasn't in that atmosphere Bible says
[37:50] that while they were
[37:52] sightseeing Jesus said something to them
[37:54] that shook them he said uh uh he said to
[37:57] them he said you see all this here
[37:59] around you he said there shall not be
[38:01] one stone left here upon another that
[38:04] shall not be thrown down so Jesus was
[38:06] already the atmosphere of seeing
[38:08] oncoming destruction amen Jesus was
[38:10] seeing all of this Glitz and Glamour and
[38:13] popularity and money and economy and
[38:16] commerce and business he was seeing all
[38:18] of that one day coming to an
[38:21] end so he was never moved by it he was
[38:25] never moved by the proud he was never
[38:28] moved by the money and the popularity
[38:30] trying to get a big house on a fancy car
[38:32] that wasn't his motive that was not his
[38:34] objective because when he look around
[38:36] all he could see is the destruction that
[38:38] was about to take place they were
[38:40] looking at the big buildings the big
[38:42] houses and nice uh Splendor of the land
[38:45] as it were Amen in Jerusalem was a great
[38:47] City a long time ago but all of it was
[38:50] to come to not and Jesus knew that it
[38:52] was about to happen and when he spoke
[38:54] those words it shook the de deciples yes
[38:57] because they were not in that atmosphere
[38:59] as I said you know they were in a car of
[39:00] Flesh you know thing and you know going
[39:02] around you know how we are looking at
[39:04] different things that's nice oh I like
[39:05] that building I like that house but uh
[39:07] God wasn't in that frame of mind you see
[39:10] he was thinking on spiritual things he
[39:12] was building his hopes on things Eternal
[39:14] and that's how we ought to be praise God
[39:18] Amen sure it's how nice to have a nice
[39:19] house and a nice car but what's the end
[39:22] of it all praise God hallelujah isn't
[39:24] that right David said told the Lord one
[39:27] time said look how the wicked Prosper
[39:28] look how the Heathen uh advance and
[39:31] doing better and you know they they're
[39:32] getting better at what they do and they
[39:35] you know improving and God said have you
[39:37] considered an end one of these days it's
[39:40] going to come to an end all that had a
[39:42] beginning will come to an end one day
[39:46] isn't that right John say I saw a new
[39:48] Heaven John say I saw a new Earth the
[39:51] old Heaven and the old Earth was passed
[39:53] away and a new Heaven and a new Earth
[39:55] was for forged by fire Hallelujah and so
[39:58] too must your new heart this morning
[40:00] your new heart have to be forged by
[40:02] God's holy fire praise God Amen isn't
[40:05] that right Hallelujah the same fire
[40:08] praise God the world's looking for fire
[40:10] amen isn't that right uh uh the world
[40:13] looking for fire to to to cleanse itself
[40:15] because it's already gone through two
[40:17] processes of of of of of cleansing isn't
[40:19] that right water in the days of Noah
[40:21] isn't that right then Sanctified by the
[40:23] blood of Jesus when he came on the earth
[40:25] and and died for man kind but there's
[40:27] one more process left Hallelujah isn't
[40:29] that right it's a three-step process
[40:32] praise God to get back into God and the
[40:34] prophet identified water blood spirit so
[40:37] that Earth is waiting for fire
[40:39] Hallelujah isn't that right to cleanse
[40:41] it hallelujah praise God so that the
[40:43] righteous could touch down on it and
[40:45] take over and begin their reign isn't
[40:47] that right A Thousand Years isn't that
[40:49] right hallelujah hallelujah amen amen so
[40:53] so so too are we looking for fire this
[40:55] morning am we are looking for the fire
[40:57] of the Holy Spirit we are looking for
[40:59] the fire of the Holy Ghost to come and
[41:01] baptize our souls into the kingdom of
[41:04] God that's the only way to get in not by
[41:08] your intellect not what you can do
[41:10] praise God but what he has already done
[41:13] what he promised to do for you in this
[41:14] hour he promised praise God to come amen
[41:18] visit you Hallelujah according to the
[41:20] time of life with the Holy Ghost
[41:22] Hallelujah the same holy ghost that he
[41:24] received in the upper room he promis to

[41:57] upup they were looking at the present
[42:01] God was seeing the future isn't that
[42:02] right amen and then the disciples came
[42:06] to him and said they they asked him they
[42:07] said Lord When shall these things be you
[42:10] know and what about the ending of the
[42:11] Lord and ending of the the world and so

[42:18] got real concern all of a sudden all the
[42:22] time they were in the natural enjoying

[46:21] God's looking at all those things
[46:23] supposed to happen sure that's fine
[46:24] that's a wrath of God coming upon the
[46:26] Earth but God's concern is for the
[46:28] gospel to be preached God's concern is
[46:31] his word going out God has a concern for
[46:34] his people God has a burden for his
[46:36] people on his mind and though things
[46:38] supposed to happen though the Earth is
[46:40] supposed to be moved though the mountain

[46:44] the sea Hallelujah those all these
[46:46] things are supposed to happen but praise

[47:07] the news just before I came in there
[47:08] that the Ebola virus is mutating so
[47:11] whatever um antidote or you know uh
[47:16] whatever cure they have for it they have

[47:37] 22,000 people have already been infected
[47:40] you know and and this is just the
[47:41] beginning we haven't seen plagues and
[47:44] famines like what's coming upon the
[47:46] Earth but God promised Hallelujah that
[47:48] before those terrible plague strike that
[47:51] there be another people in the land who
[47:53] under their Messenger will be the final
[47:56] voice to the final age at the final

[48:30] for this morning cuz one day there won't
[48:32] be a church service there won't always
[48:34] be church we don't always have a place
[48:37] to go to amen is that right the prophet
[48:39] said they shut them down they shut down
[48:41] places like these and make them great
[48:43] storehouses isn't that right people have
[48:45] to meet in their homes and have prayer
[48:47] meetings and so forth uh brother Bram
[48:49] saw it coming to pass but he also saw a

[49:18] line up with the word this morning we
[49:19] have to line up with what God's
[49:21] requirements are to fulfill God's
[49:24] requirements isn't that right because
[49:27] the reality is and we always preach as
[49:30] though every one of you would be saved
[49:32] but the reality is want to be taken and
[49:35] want to be left that's how Jesus
[49:38] described a Rapture it's never a group
[49:41] it's not a whole bunch of people going
[49:42] in and we go in in a Rapture no no no
[49:45] it's one little sister over here one
[49:47] little brother over here who's adopted
[49:49] one little brother one little sister one
[49:52] little young man one little young girl
[49:54] but one will be taken one would be left
[49:57] that's the reality so get next to
[49:59] yourself this morning it's not a group
[50:01] ofair this is not a group issue one will
[50:04] be taken one will be left one will be
[50:07] taken praise God two in a field one

[50:15] what day you don't know what
[50:18] hour say Amen
[50:22] somebody oh
[50:24] Hallelujah
[50:25] that's the reality that we face as
[50:28] ministers coming up here and preaching
[50:30] the word we hope that all will be saved
[50:33] but if you don't take the word and apply
[50:35] it then we're not responsible for
[50:38] that amen amen we're responsible to uh
[50:41] with charge responsibility to uh warn
[50:44] you praise God Amen of oncoming disaster
[50:47] we praise God by The Prophet's warning
[50:48] amen echoing those same words praise God
[50:51] hallelujah of Malachi 4 staying with
[50:53] that word warning the people he amen
[50:55] preaching the mysteries of God warning
[50:57] every man hallelujah amen amen but if
[51:00] you don't take the war warning if you
[51:02] don't take God's mercy Prophet said then
[51:04] you're right for judgment isn't that
[51:06] right oh my what an hour we living in
[51:10] isn't that right Hallelujah but this
[51:12] gospel must be preached Jesus said and
[51:16] then the end shall come in other words
[51:18] God's waiting on his gospel to be
[51:20] preached amen and then we could see
[51:22] about all the famines pestilences and
[51:23] wars and earthquakes and diverse places
[51:26] so don't let that be your main uh Focus
[51:29] praise God isn't that right but get
[51:31] concerned about the word get concerned
[51:33] about the gospel praise God get
[51:35] concerned about what God has for you
[51:37] because he has something for you this
[51:38] morning hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[51:41] isn't that right there's a requirement
[51:43] for you to make there's something that

[52:47] they would kill it and so forth and you

[53:11] anyhow and Swinging his hand left or
[53:13] right or just have any kind of approach
[53:15] there was a certain approach to God

[1:03:11] earlier uh from God of this evil age

[1:03:26] isn't that right said did you notice he
[1:03:28] said a people not a church now listen to
[1:03:31] this real carefully I love how he breaks
[1:03:32] it down I'll read it real slow he said a
[1:03:35] people not a church why yet it's called
[1:03:39] a church but he would call a people amen
[1:03:43] now a church is a gathering of many
[1:03:45] people of all different makeups but God
[1:03:49] is calling listen to this but God is
[1:03:51] calling one here he didn't say I call
[1:03:54] Methodist group or the Baptist
[1:03:57] Pentecostal he said he'd call a people
[1:03:59] what for his name see a people one from
[1:04:03] the Methodist one from the Baptist one
[1:04:05] from the Lutheran one from the Catholic
[1:04:08] see but he's calling not a church group

[1:04:18] spirit flowing freely I can find one

[1:13:11] with that that's a waste of time why
[1:13:13] bother talking about hundreds of people
[1:13:16] around Jesus I don't know they got the
[1:13:18] memo or something that Jesus was going
[1:13:19] to pass by and everybody was there but
[1:13:21] she changed because of her attit she
[1:13:23] changed the way things were supposed to
[1:13:25] be and and the way human concept would
[1:13:27] see it she wasn't seeing it that way she
[1:13:30] she was seeing things in a supernatural
[1:13:32] level she was seeing that there was a
[1:13:34] possibility that that there was a
[1:13:35] possibility that that baby part fure the
[1:13:38] Lord would pass by me one day that that
[1:13:42] this day could be the day that that
[1:13:43] Hallelujah she was seeing herself healed
[1:13:46] she was seeing herself walking free and
[1:13:48] she was seeing herself moving Hallelujah
[1:13:51] the way she used to move and jumping the
[1:13:53] way she used to jump and shout and the
[1:13:55] way she used to shout
[1:13:57] and oh
[1:14:00] Hallelujah
[1:14:03] my it's
[1:14:04] amazing what one person can
[1:14:07] do oh Hallelujah God works with
[1:14:11] individuals he always has isn't that
[1:14:13] right okay let me finish this quote here
[1:14:16] one from the Methodist one from the
[1:14:18] Baptist one from the Lutheran one from
[1:14:21] the Catholic see but he's calling church
[1:14:24] not a church group but a people for his
[1:14:27] name that receives his name engaged in
[1:14:31] his name going to a wedding to be
[1:14:33] married to him to become part of him see
[1:14:36] by
[1:14:37] predestination said just as a man
[1:14:39] chooses a right wife in this life was
[1:14:41] ordained to be part of his body he said
[1:14:43] so that is the bride of Christ will be
[1:14:46] and is now from old ordained by God to
[1:14:49] be part of that body amen isn't that
[1:14:52] right so you're predestinated to be part
[1:14:55] of that body oh Hallelujah hallelu you
[1:14:57] have to see yourself that way amen it's
[1:15:00] important how you see yourself in this
[1:15:01] service because one is going to be taken
[1:15:03] and one is going to be left that's the
[1:15:05] reality praise God you make up your mind
[1:15:07] which one you want to be this morning
[1:15:10] Hallelujah Hal I'm not responsible for
[1:15:11] that choice the pastor's not responsible
[1:15:13] for that choice the ministry is not
[1:15:15] responsible for that choice you are
[1:15:17] responsible Hallelujah for the attitude
[1:15:19] and action you take concerning God's
[1:15:22] word isn't that right
[1:15:24] amen
[1:15:26] amen praise God hallelujah where am I at
[1:15:28] here amen do you love him Hallelujah one
[1:15:33] taken one left isn't that right okay
[1:15:36] praise God let me SK over this quote
[1:15:38] here now talking about adoption and uh
[1:15:41] just want to read this here I think it I
[1:15:43] think it fits right in here with what
[1:15:44] I'm trying to see uh said the church is
[1:15:47] supposed to be predestinated isn't that
[1:15:48] right unto the adoption of children you
[1:15:50] know this quote said where a man a man
[1:15:52] see God can take a man and adopt him
[1:15:55] into the family not a group it's
[1:15:57] adoption is not a
[1:15:59] group thing forget about it takes one
[1:16:02] over here set some aside Hallelujah let
[1:16:05] your pants legs be bagged at the knees
[1:16:07] praise God and you set your eyes toward
[1:16:08] Heaven that God takes you over to the
[1:16:10] side not the group you over to the side
[1:16:13] a man a woman somewhere and adopts him
[1:16:16] gives him something isn't that right
[1:16:18] said adopt him in the family see and
[1:16:20] give him something that said first try
[1:16:23] that and see if it's right amen so the
[1:16:26] Bible said try the spirits this man
[1:16:28] claims a certain thing this person say
[1:16:30] claims this uh claims certain things
[1:16:32] said try it see if it's right said and
[1:16:35] if it's a if it's if it's as right move
[1:16:37] right with it then say Lord send us
[1:16:40] something else keep moving see said just
[1:16:42] keep moving say every fellow take his
[1:16:46] place look how he put this here now said
[1:16:48] every fellow take his place in words
[1:16:50] every individual person take their place
[1:16:53] then then what happens after that then
[1:16:55] you're going to see the Church of God
[1:16:56] begin to get into its place so the
[1:16:58] church can only get into its place when
[1:17:00] every fellow takes his place that's a
[1:17:03] church it's made up of every fellow
[1:17:05] that's taken his place in Christ isn't
[1:17:07] that right oh my Hallelujah see so
[1:17:11] that's what the church is it's made up
[1:17:12] of
[1:17:14] individuals isn't that right who have
[1:17:16] taken their stand isn't that right
[1:17:18] who've taken their place in Christ see
[1:17:20] that's when that's when the Philistines
[1:17:21] will go to backing up
[1:17:23] the shorts will go off hair will grow
[1:17:25] down faces will be washed cigars will be
[1:17:28] missing why because we're not trying to
[1:17:30] push nobody to to be holy and to come to
[1:17:32] church on time no you're doing that
[1:17:34] because you take your
[1:17:35] place isn't that right when you take
[1:17:38] your place you do the things of God
[1:17:40] isn't that right nobody had to beg it to
[1:17:42] worship beg you to praise God beg you to
[1:17:44] come on time beg you to pay a tights beg
[1:17:46] it to contribute to the church or
[1:17:48] nothing my God you want to do these
[1:17:50] things because you love the Lord and you
[1:17:52] want to see God's people amen be blessed
[1:17:55] and so forth isn't that right oh my
[1:17:59] isn't that
[1:18:01] right see that's right that's when the
[1:18:03] church begin to get into its Mighty
[1:18:05] power when they have an ananus and saf
[1:18:08] and a few of them a few of
[1:18:11] them talk about another book of Acts
[1:18:14] that was a scary thing back then to see
[1:18:17] that isn't that right here it was
[1:18:19] everybody was selling the the land and
[1:18:21] so forth and you know doing what they
[1:18:24] could uh to the church and so on and
[1:18:26] these people coming to church
[1:18:28] lying write down a sum of money that uh
[1:18:32] was
[1:18:33] false and God killed them on the spot
[1:18:37] because he wanted to keep the church
[1:18:38] pure he loved the church he couldn't
[1:18:41] have the church in that kind of
[1:18:43] condition when people coming there lying
[1:18:44] and doing what they want to do what kind
[1:18:46] of skull dogly and underhanded money no
[1:18:48] no no God couldn't have it in the church
[1:18:51] so he cut it off one time cuz he alone

[1:18:56] amen Peter didn't know but Peter was in
[1:18:58] communication with the Holy Spirit and

[1:22:58] this here quick before I move on uh
[1:23:02] here's a prophet talking about Witnesses
[1:23:06] said in the court there's two kind of
[1:23:07] witnesses that'll stand that's eye or
[1:23:09] air he said now if you're sitting in a
[1:23:11] room and you look through a glass and
[1:23:13] you see an accident he said your witness
[1:23:15] he said your word is no good because you
[1:23:17] were looking through a glass said you
[1:23:19] have to be right there close to really
[1:23:22] know what you're talking about see
[1:23:23] before you can be a witness you have to
[1:23:25] hear it or you have to see it before you
[1:23:27] can be a witness on a severe case in the
[1:23:30] courts you can't say Miss so and so told
[1:23:33] me amen or Mr so and so or Reverend so
[1:23:36] and so told me he's a witness but you're
[1:23:39] not so therefore no man can exactly
[1:23:42] witness to the resurrection of Christ
[1:23:44] only by the Holy Spirit isn't that
[1:23:48] right Amen to make you the right kind of
[1:23:50] witness isn't that right you have to be
[1:23:52] a personal witness yourself being there
[1:23:55] Hallelujah knowing something about it
[1:23:57] knowing what you're talking about amen
[1:24:00] isn't that right and he said and God
[1:24:01] help us to see that day that when men
[1:24:04] will just be what uh will be just what
[1:24:06] they are he said you know I'm saying
[1:24:09] this now with all respects he said it
[1:24:11] isn't our city full of bootleg joints
[1:24:13] that's hurting us he said here's what's
[1:24:15] hurting us more than ever he said his
[1:24:17] people who are professing to be
[1:24:19] Christians are not living like it that's
[1:24:22] he said that's the thing see they're not
[1:24:24] a correct witness they can't witness
[1:24:27] until they have an experience and when
[1:24:30] they have an experience then they become
[1:24:33] a witness automatically Hallelujah
[1:24:36] because they're born again hallelujah
[1:24:38] amen isn't that right Hallelujah comes
[1:24:41] back to what comes back to what brother
[1:24:43] Isaac was saying that Sunday amen we do
[1:24:45] things with the young people to try to
[1:24:46] encourage them but it takes an
[1:24:48] experience Amen to really keep you in
[1:24:51] this hour it takes an experience with
[1:24:53] God you have to say that you felt him
[1:24:57] that you felt his presence that you know
[1:24:59] what it's about that you felt the glory
[1:25:01] you felt the power isn't that right you
[1:25:04] remember the Terence over I remember he
[1:25:06] was sharing with the young people one
[1:25:07] time he said about how he received the
[1:25:09] Holy Ghost he said one day brother
[1:25:11] William Hugh Williams I think came to
[1:25:13] him and began to testify to him is that
[1:25:14] right about how he received the Holy
[1:25:16] Spirit in a in a in a meeting one time
[1:25:19] and the way brother Terry said the way
[1:25:21] that he began to impress how this glory
[1:25:23] and power come upon him oh but the ter
[1:25:25] over begin to get thirsty about it he
[1:25:27] began to get concerned about it there
[1:25:29] was something vibrating off brother Hugh
[1:25:31] Williams that he had never seen before
[1:25:33] there was a glory on his face there was
[1:25:35] a difference in his walk there was a
[1:25:37] difference in his talk there was
[1:25:38] something moving it was real for him it
[1:25:42] was real to him he felt the fire he told
[1:25:45] him what he felt he said you got to
[1:25:47] experience it too amen and by faith but
[1:25:50] uh but the ter over received amen the
[1:25:51] holy Spirit also isn't that right amen

[1:26:06] go into inside of you and burn the
[1:26:09] demons out burn the lust out burn the
[1:26:11] thoughts out the prophet said examine
[1:26:13] your life what were you before he said

[1:26:18] since you believed what changed since
[1:26:20] you received that Holy Spirit of promise
[1:26:23] H isn't that right he said if you're
[1:26:25] still flying off the handle if you still
[1:26:27] have temper tantrums you haven't got it
[1:26:28] yet you have to go back and get it
[1:26:31] praise God you've got it to get isn't
[1:26:33] that right but you're nothing until you
[1:26:35] receive that Holy Spirit of promise you

[1:28:58] personal Savior and I'm going to stay

[1:44:28] up there that was following Apollos he
[1:44:31] said have you received the Holy Ghost
[1:44:33] since you believe not when you believe
