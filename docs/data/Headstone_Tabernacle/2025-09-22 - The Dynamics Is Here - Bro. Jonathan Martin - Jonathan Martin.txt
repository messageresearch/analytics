Oh, do you believe God can move this evening? He's on the move tonight. We are so happy to be in his presence in the mighty move of God. But God bless you this evening. And one more time, if you have your Bibles, we'd like to turn to a portion of scripture in the Psalms as we worship the Lord this afternoon. Psalm chapter 111. Welcome one and all once more to the presence of God. Psalm chapter 111, which says, "Praise ye the Lord. I will praise the Lord with my whole heart and in the assembly of the upright and in the congregation. The works of the Lord are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein. His work is honorable and glorious, and his righteousness endureth forever. He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered. The Lord is gracious and full of compassion. He had given meat unto them that fear him. He will ever be mindful of his covenant. He hath shown his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen. The works of his hands are verity and judgment, and all his commandments are sure. They stand fast forever and ever and are done in truth and uprightness. He sent redemption unto his people. He had commanded his covenant forever. Holy and reverent is his name. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. A good understanding have all they that do his commandments, and his praise endureth forever. May God add a blessing to the reading of his word this evening. Let's just bow our heads and worship the Lord in our own way as we we want to create an atmosphere this evening of praise and worship and glory unto the King of Kings. We're here to worship him this evening. We're here to bow down before him. We're here to acknowledge that he is God and he is Lord and Savior over our lives. We are here to declare that he can do anything among us. He can heal the sick among us. He can raise the dead among us. He can make the cripples walk. He can make the blind see. He can fill with the with the Holy Ghost tonight. Whatever your expectation is right now, release it in this place and let the uh let God hear you this evening and and let him answer your prayer as we cry together in his ears tonight. Dear God, heavenly father, we come Lord into the house of God. We are thankful for this opportunity once more to be gathered around your word, Lord. Gathered in your presence, Father.

May you anoint your people as they sing and worship together, as they praise your holy name. May your glory come down and minister to each one, each heart and life that is gathered here this evening. Even those that are hooked up on the internet, Lord, and listening to our live broadcast, we pray that they also will be blessed by what they hear tonight.

Say, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Say, Lord, I love you. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Let's just give him a a little wave offering. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. He's wonderful. He's marvelous. &gt;&gt; He's loving. You know, I want to sing this little song for the honor and glory of the Lord. A song we all know. The love of God. You know, when we think of the love of God, you get lost for words. Here standing up in front of you is a young man who Satan had planned to take my life. A man took a gun and he pointed at me. He shot me. The bullet hit here and the bullet came out here. So I supposed to be a dead man. &gt;&gt; But then we must remember that the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord. So when you think of the love of God, it spans space, time, it it covers everything. &gt;&gt; But when you face death, you get a different meaning. &gt;&gt; How much the Lord love us, &gt;&gt; you know? Don't care if you make your bed in hell, he'll come and find you there. &gt;&gt; Oh, can we say amen? &gt;&gt; So I want to sing this song more than just words now. We want to sing it with a revelation &gt;&gt; that the love of God is rich and pure. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. I want to read something for you. Yeah. The prophet. You say, "Friends," this is the children of Israel. You say, "Friends, when you miss the love of God in your hearts, you miss everything. No matter what you've done, where there's tongues, they shall cease. Where there's prophecy, it shall vanish. But where there is charity, it lasts forever. Oh, could we say amen? &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. So, just as I sing, close your eyes and think about what the love of God has done for you. Think about bowels of compassion. And when you go in that place, remember it never stops. And may the words mean more to you as we come to worship him because of his love. The love of God is greater far [Music] than tongue or pen can ever tell. It goes beyond the highest star and reaches to the lowest he bow down with care. God gave his son to [Music] glory his child. He reconciled and pardoned from [Music] his sin. Oh, could we lift our hands and sing? Oh lamb of God, how rich and pure, how meless and strong and strong for glory it shine forever [Music] for more endure. Hallelujah. [Music] Sing it. Oh. [Music] contain the contain the oh don't stretch don't stretch from sky to sky oh love of Oh, how rich and pure, how sweet, how me. Oh, and strong and strong and strong. I It shall forever forever more. Endure the saints and angels, the saints. Oh, hallelujah. Let's just lift our hands once again. Oh, love of God. Oh, give him worship. You think about him now. You think about how much he love you. Oh, think about he he stand up his hand to reach for you. Oh, give him a shout. Give him praise. Oh, think about how much he loved you. He paid a price to set you free. Oh, glory. One more time. He's worship. Oh, he's our husband, our lover. [Music] And Pure, pure, pure. Oh [Music] [Applause] Forever. [Music] Oh, we thank God for his love. Thank you for your mercy, Lord. Hallelujah. Thank you for your loving kindness, Lord. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, let's sing a song. Where would I be? God of all you know, lift your hands all over and say, I'm glad you see through eyes of love. Hopeless days, an empty space. If not for grace, where would I be? Oh, where would I be? God only knows. Oh, I'm glad you see through eyes of love. Oh, bless an empty space if not for grace. Amazing grace. Oh, Jesus. Oh, the Lord I once was lost, but now I'm a hopeless case, an empty space if not for grace. Oh, praise him in your own way this evening while the music plays. Hallelujah. [Music] Oh, we thank you for your love. Thank you for your mercy, Lord Jesus. Thank you for your presence. Thank you for your power. Thank you for your spirit, Lord. Oh, you helped me. You rescued me. You saved me. You delivered me. You cleaned me up. You established my going. You set my foot upon a rock. I'm here tonight because of God's mercy. Oh, how many here tonight because of his mercy. Oh, because of his grace. Oh, lift your hands and cry out. Grace, grace, grace. Oh, I hope this case. Oh, an empty space. Oh, well, if not for grace. One more time. Where would I be? Where would I be? God only knows this. Lord, I'm glad you see through eyes of hopeless days an empty space. Oh, if not for great. Let's sing. Rash Lord, please take my hand and lead me all and help me stand. Oh, a hopeless case, an empty space if not for grace. [Applause] Oh, let's all praise him today. Oh, let everything that had breath praise the Lord. Praise his holy name. Oh, he is able. He is able. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Oh, praise him for his life. Why don't you turn around, greet your brother one more time. Greet your sister one more time in a special way. Praise God. Amen. Tell him that you love them. Praise God. Amen. Give me a key for the cloud of glory is moving. Praise God. We move with the cloud. Move with the cloud. Oh, hallelujah. Oh, are you excited? Do you know what God's about to do tonight? Oh, hallelujah. Oh, the cloud of glory is moving. Oh, we'll move with the cloud. Oh, singing move. Oh, and the cloud the cloud of glory is. Oh, move. Well, now move with the cloud. Oh, and move.

Can we give the Lord a hand of praise? Hallelujah. Glory, glory, glory, glory, glory, glory. Well, God bless you, church. It is certainly wonderful to be back in the house of the Lord tonight. And I believe this evening we are here to give the devil a knockout punch in this threeprong attack, this military intervention that God in his wisdom sent our way in the person of the gift of brother Jonathan Martin coming to Trinidad for the very first time. You appreciate God's gift. You appreciate God's servant. And what a blessing he has been yesterday, this morning, and now tonight for this final service. By the grace of God, we are under great expectation for what God is about to do. We certainly appreciate all those who have come for the different services, those who have connected online as well. And tonight, we want to salute and welcome our precious brother Daniel Hernandez. God bless you, brother Daniel. Certainly good to have you here with us tonight. Precious brother Norris Cummings and his wife is here as well. God bless you. Welcome. So I don't want to take one more minute than is necessary. I believe God has something in store for us. And it's the last service. There are so many other things we could be doing, but we are here with our sword drawn looking to knock the devil out of your home, out of your life, looking for power to be manifested in our walk with God. So the cloud of glorious move. Hallelujah. Move, brother Jonathan. Move with the cloud. Oh the cloud of glory is moving. Oh move with the cloud. Oh move with the cloud. Let your spirit arise. Strength be with you. Come, let us move all together. As we follow the way he leads new life, we shall receive. As we move with a clout, oh, we'll move with a clout. Well, praise the Lord. The move is on. &gt;&gt; Following vindicated word. Hallelujah. He's never led us wrong. He's never led us wrong. It's just been from victory to victory to victory. I'm so glad for the grace of God to follow him. Follow where he leads. And I like that song. Amen. The move is on. Well, we want to say God richly bless you and uh we just greet you in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. It's been a real uh been a real blessing to be here and to minister to you and uh we appreciate uh your pastor co for again for allowing us to come and brother Isaac and uh we've just uh appreciate all of all of the hospitality and um I I think I'm going home a little bit heavier. Uh that's been some good food and uh uh so uh my complime my compliments to the who whoever it is. But uh it's it's been some some good food and uh but uh we've enjoyed the fellowship and uh you know uh it's good when we just lick the honey off of each other and uh just enjoy. Well, hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Amen. If if the devil's mad, then that's a that's not a bad thing. And uh because you know, the devil tries, but he doesn't have enough. And uh if there's anything that uh we know uh if if there's any any testimony that we have, the devil just doesn't have enough. And uh he fights and tries to discourage and he tries to bring afflictions and fears and nervousness and anxieties and but the devil just doesn't have enough. You can't keep a son or a daughter of God down. And uh so we just thank the Lord. Is it this mic? &gt;&gt; Okay. Well uh hallelujah. They're they're working on it back there. So problems. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Let's try this one. Well, let's just let's while they're getting us situated, try I don't try Jesus. That's okay. There is power, power, wonder working power in the blood of the lamb. There is power, power, wonder working power in preious blood. Sing it again. There is power power in the blood of the lamb. Power [Music] [Applause] [Music] Earth and power in the preious blood of the lamb. Sing it like this. Oh, victory is mine. Oh, victory is mine. Oh, victory today is mine. Oh, I told you behind. Oh, victory today. It is mine. Well, now I woke up this morning. I did not have a doubt. I knew that my Lord would bring me out. So I got down on my knees and I said, "Lord, help me please." Oh, I rose up singing and shouting the victory. [Music] Oh, victory is mine. Victory is mine. Oh, victory today. Oh, I told thee behind. Oh, victory is mine. Love is mine. Love is mine.

Well, I'm glad that I know who Jesus is. He's more than just some story. He's more than just some man-made idea. &gt;&gt; Oh, but he is a living Christ, a living reality. &gt;&gt; And I'm glad that I know him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, I think we got it fixed. Amen. It sounds good up here anyways. &gt;&gt; And uh so am I good with this mic? &gt;&gt; All right. St. John the 15th chapter beginning we're just going to read the fifth verse and uh then St. John 14 and we'll read verses 16 down to 20 and then Psalms 110 the first seven verses. I am the vine, ye are the branches. He that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit. &gt;&gt; For without me ye can do nothing. &gt;&gt; That is a tremendous revelation for the hour that we live in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That without Jesus Christ we can do nothing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; John 14 and verse 16. And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another comforter, that he that he may abide with you forever. Even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him, but ye know him. For he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. &gt;&gt; I will not leave you comfortless. &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful? Amen. &gt;&gt; I will not leave you comfortless. &gt;&gt; I will come to you. &gt;&gt; Yet a little while on the world seeth me no more, but ye see me, because I live, you shall live also. &gt;&gt; At that day ye shall know that I am in the Father, and ye in me, and I in you. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Psalms 110. And just reading the first seven verses. The Lord said unto my Lord, sit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemies thy foottool. &gt;&gt; The Lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion. Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power. In the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning, thou hast the dw of thy youth. The Lord hath sworn and will not repent. Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melzdc. The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath. He shall judge among the heathen. He shall fill the places with the dead bodies. He shall wound the heads over many countries. He shall drink of the brook and the way. Therefore shall he lift up thy head. And just verse three again, thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power. How many would like to be remembered in a word of prayer? &gt;&gt; Just got a need on your heart. Heavenly Father, we surrender our hearts to you, Lord, for this service. &gt;&gt; Father, we stand before your presence and know that you're here with us, Lord. And as we have read the word, you promised to come to us and we know that you're here, Father. You're our comforter. You're our strength, the fulfillment of every promise for this day. Father, I just ask that you minister to your people. Lord, &gt;&gt; just the hands that were raised, the need, you know, the that is under that upraised hand. God, just minister to to your children, Father. Come in your mercy, Lord, and give strength and healing and fillings of the Holy Ghost, refillings, Lord, and just pour out yourself among us, oh God. We would ask these things in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. God richly bless you. You can be seated. &gt;&gt; I would like to just speak for a a text for just a few moments that the dynamics is here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe that we're living in the grandest of all ages. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And I I see I I see with uh my own eyes and my heart looking through a a a heart of understanding and faith that God has moved in his mercy upon us in this hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's moved in such a supernatural way that for that so we won't miss what he has done and what he is doing and and it is his grace upon our lives. The prophet of God would say that my mission I believe to the earth is to forrun the coming word. &gt;&gt; Amen. the coming word which is Christ and Christ in him has the millennium and has everything right there because he is the word. Brother Brandham would say that the message is Christ and we're not just come together to talk about the message, &gt;&gt; but we're come together to get in the message, &gt;&gt; to get under the message. &gt;&gt; And again, the message is Christ. And so we we know that Satan, all of the mechanics is all in order when Satan is about to be incarnate in the man of sin and he's about to start his ride. &gt;&gt; And uh we we see that that last horse rider is the pale horse, which is spiritual death. And it's the blending of all of the other horses together, all of the other colors, and it makes a pale color and it's spiritual death. And the last plague to fall in Egypt in the Exodus was spiritual death. &gt;&gt; And we see that at the same time that that spiritual death is striking that God sends a a prophet with a declaration that I am come down. That was what Moses his message was a declaration of not just a man coming to say let my people go but it was it was who was doing the speaking &gt;&gt; because it was God speaking through a prophet that I remember my promise and I am come down. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, we remember that Luke the 17th chapter would say that as it was in the days of Noah and as it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be in the revealing of the son of man. So Jesus knew that the conditions of the age would be such as it was in Sodom and was in the days of Noah. But he was speaking himself a a a a body or a a a coming in this time in this age. He was prophesying that I am going to be revealed. &gt;&gt; And we find that the fulfillment of that is a revelation the 10th chapter that the mighty angel has come down and the father would say only Christ it can be. You see the mighty angel descending with an open book and the mysteries are revealed at the sounding of the seventh angel's message. We find again that this day this the scripture being fulfilled is 1 Thessalonians the 4th chapter the 16th verse that the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first. We find again in 2 Corinthians the 3rd chapter the 17th verse. Now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. Amen. So it's in this age that that the Lord himself, not just a man, not not a pope, not a bishop, not just an apostle, but it is the Lord himself that has descended. Amen. It's the everpresence of himself. And the prophet of God would say that the son of man has already come from glory and is revealing himself for the past few years to his church in mercy, showing them his great presence, doing the same things that he did when he was here on earth, revealing himself like he did to Abraham before the destruction. He has come now in mercy, revealing himself to the church. It's being laughed at and scoffed at. Now you see Ephesians the 2 chapter beginning at verse one, Paul would say, "And you hath he quickened." Amen. I like that. You hath he quickened. In other words, you can put yourself right there and and put your name. You He's speaking to you. It's a personal understanding or personal realization that I have been quickened. Amen. You hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins, wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now workketh in the children of disobedience, among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature the children of wrath even as others. But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love, wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ. By grace you are saved. So Paul is showing us, amen, that we were one way. We were identified as the children of disobedience. We had our conversation in the world. But God who is rich in mercy, that means everything to us. But God who is rich in mercy. Amen. You see, the prophet of God would take that and preach God rich in mercy and show us that we were predestinated before the foundation of the world. That we were always seed, but we were in the world and we just had the muck and the filth of of the world upon us. But God who is rich in mercy had an appointed time that we would come out of the darkness into his marvelous light. And you who once were dead are now quickened and made alive. And you never become seed at the altar. You always were seed. And because you were seed, you could be quickened. Because there is nothing to quicken. Amen. You can't just quicken the rock. You can't just quicken the dirt. But it takes a seed to be quickened. And because you are quickened is an witness that this rapture is for you. This resurrection is for you. Amen. Deliverance and overcoming power is for you. It's because of God's rich mercy upon our lives. Amen. You see, I I think of how that God rich in mercy when the children of Israel in the Exodus had sinned and and and there was death in the camp. But God rich in mercy told Moses that you take a brace a brass serpent and put it on a pole. And anyone that can look and and and as they look at that brazen serpent, they'll look and they shall live. Amen. Oh, what a mercy. when death people were dying left and right. But a prophet began to tell them, you've got to look look away, amen, from from your faults and look away from the sin. And you've got to look because that is God's mercy. That is God's atonement. And if you can see it, you can live. I think of how that that angel, Amen, moved upon that pole. Amen. Oh, God rich in mercy allowed. It wasn't just a brass serpent, but it was God coming upon and moving upon something to bring mercy because he was he was showing in time what was going to happen with Jesus on Calvary. And if you can see Jesus and him crucified and you can see that he died for your sins and he took your place. And if you can catch a vision of it and and see by revelation that it is finished uh and that he died and he was buried but he rose again on the third day for your justification. I tell you friends, it's mercy. If you can see it, I tell you. Amen. There was God in his mercy and how that the pillar of fire had moved. Amen. on on that brass serpent. But now it was a time that God was that angel was coming down upon upon the waters there at the the pool of shalom. Amen. And they understood and recognized that the angel of the Lord would come in a certain season and would trouble the waters. And how they knew that the angel was moving is because it moved from the natural to the supernatural. The currents would be moving one direction, but when the presence of that angel would begin to move, the current would be changed and it would go the other direction. And then they understood if I can just get into that water, it's mercy. If I could just get into it, I know that I I will be healed of whatever affliction. I tell you, that was where the angel of the Lord was moving. But you see what the prophet of God would tell us. What are you looking to church all these last days? He's been right among us people and we forgot it. Oh, how easy it is sometimes to forget when we're going through a hard time and we're wondering how the bills are going to be paid or wondering how we're going to be healed or delivered from an affliction or when sin a maybe come into and grip our lives. And we forget that God's mercy is here among us. Uh it's the Lord himself uh revealing himself uh amen to a lost and dying world. Uh without his mercy, we would all die. We would all perish. We all deserve hell. But God rich in mercy has reached downh and give us in a lifeline that if you can see it and get a hold of it it's transforming mercy. Hallelujah. How we forget it but he sent right among us and we didn't know it. The Holy Spirit is here this morning. And maybe many will go away and forget it. Maybe many that sick will forget to believe and anchor their faith right where it should be. Now truly the pull is troubled. The waters are whirling backwards from natural showing the supernatural. The Holy Spirit is here taking a normal bunch of people intelligent sitting here well-dressed well educated looking. The Holy Spirit fall upon them and something whirls them around. They holler, "Glory to God. Hallelujah. What's the matter?" The troubling of the water. Sinners sitting there. Backsliders, prostitutes, drunkards, and everything else are saintly, godly. You can't put a finger on their lives anywhere since they receive it. What is it? The troubling of the waters. What are you looking at? the Holy Spirit fall among us. You see, amen. Those waters is a type of humanity. When you read water in the Bible, it's a type of humanity. And the angel of the Lord coming upon humanity, taking someone that was a prostitute uh and bringing them back uh to avert a righteous uh woman again in the presence of God. taking an alcoholic uh and restoring them sober, taking someone uh that is so filthy and sin. But God moves upon humanity and brings them back to being a son and daughter again. Uh that's what we are declaring. That's what we're pointing to is there is a reality to this message. It is the angel of the Lord and he's troubling the waters. [Applause] He's changing lives. He's setting the captives free. He's taking the ashes of our past and bringing a beauty out of our lives. It's the power of God that's doing it. You see, Isaiah 45 and 22 says, "Look unto me &gt;&gt; and be ye saved all the ends of the earth, for I am God and there is none else." You see the call for years, look unto me, ye ends of the earth. I would like to kind of turn that just a little bit and look especially unto me at the end of each world system because he always makes himself known so real at the end of a world system when it's coming to its end. Look unto me all ye ends of the world, I might say. Amen. See, look unto me. I am God. There is none other. In a time that we are living in now, what could we look to that would be more solid than God? And God is the word. So look to the word of God today for your answer. I know people's going to psychologist. I know people are trying to go from this religion to this religion and they're trying to find peace and they're trying to find a cure and they're trying to find something that will help their family and restore marriages and and will bring a peace to their lives and people are becoming neurotics. People are nervous. People the world's falling apart. But it's at the end of the world system. It's at the time of the end is when God reveals himself uh in reality. It's when God steps in on the scene and says, "Look to me. I'm your healer. I'm your deliverer. I'm your Holy Ghost. I'm your rapture. I'm the one that restores. I am God. And there is none other. I am the remedy. I am the atonement. I am the cure for your sickness. I am the mercy seat that has come down to change the situation uh to break the shackles of your life. Uh to bring transforming grace look to me and all ye ends of the world. You see usually people come to a meeting, a religious gathering. Some of them go to find a big crowd of people to sat with. Oh, I hate to say this, but it's true. Some go to church just to show their clothes they're wearing. Some goes to church because they say this is the biggest church in the city. It's got the best name. A certain class of people goes to this church. That's wrong. You're not looking to the right thing that the church is established for. You see what God promised for the hour, look for that to be fulfilled. You must look to him because he is the word. Search the scriptures. Find out what is promised for this day and then look at it under expectation for it to be fulfilled. Did he not say, "I am the God that healeth all thy diseases?" Is he not the God that said, "I will come down." Is he not the God that said, "I'm going to rapture you and you will be sinless and blameless." Is he not the God that said, "I've got the power to change things. I've got the power to transform your life. I'm the one that changes you from glory to glory to glory." You've got to look at the promise. Quit looking at your bills and look at the promise. Quit looking at your needs and look at the promise. Quit looking at your situation and look at the promise. &gt;&gt; You see the prophet of God in the sermon going beyond the camp says, "As I as as I look and preach across the nation and watch the people, I am fully persuaded that that the people are not getting to Christ. And I believe that it's the enemy that's throwed this hindrance because the reason I believe this is he is not the object that they have been pointed to. They have either been pointed to a dogma or a doctrine or a party or an experience or a sensation or something like that instead of being pointed to Christ the word. &gt;&gt; You see, you see some other finger is pointing them to someone's church. Some other finger is pointing them. you've got to believe my doctrine. Some other some other finger is pointing them to a certain sensation or or a certain theory or or a certain system or or a tradition, but you're pointed to the wrong thing. It's pointed in the wrong way because Jesus said, "I am the way. I am the truth. I am the life." I tell you, see, it's the same Jesus. That same Jesus lives. But you see, what good does it to try to get a man warned by pointing him to a painted fire? You see, that's a that's a historical fire. You say it isn't a painted fire, Brother Brandham. It's a picture of a fire that actually happened. You can't get warned by the picture. There's that something that was. What about now? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You can't get warm but just a picture. Amen. But it's got to be a reality. You can't get warm. Amen. I I I love that picture. Let me just put it like this. &gt;&gt; I love that picture. I I've got it in my home. I've got it everywhere I go. Amen. But just see it's more than just a picture. &gt;&gt; It's about that pillar of fire. And this is more than just a picture, but that is Christ. It's more than just looking back, a man, back in the 50s and and saying, "Yes, we've got a picture, but what about that reality of the pillar of high coming off of the picture and saying it's now? Now is the day of visitation. Now is the time that the angel of the Lord is accompanying this message and he's proving himself alive. &gt;&gt; You see, always pointing to what God's going to do or what he has done and ignoring what he's doing. That's the way we get discrepancies &gt;&gt; in it. &gt;&gt; That's from the sermon, the seed of discrepancy. You see, the prophet of God would say, "Amen, that picture," Amen. The picture that I just showed you says, "Ever since I've been out to stand back and try to keep out of the picture just as much as I possibly could so they would see the Lord Jesus." And I want you now to look to what I'm pointing to, not because I'm telling you this, that the angel of the Lord, Amen. He's saying, "I'm in the picture, but I'm trying to get myself as far away from that picture as I can because I'm pointing to the pillar of fire. I don't want you to just see a man. I want you to see who I'm introducing you to. It's Christ. [Applause] That's the answer. That's the one that we're following." &gt;&gt; You see, I'm wondering today it's what's happening. Are we really getting the people to God or are we just getting them to church? We must get them to Christ. We're this quick getting power. It's good to go to church. Sure, if that's as far as we go, it's not far enough. When you come to church, that's good. But go on to Christ from the church because we must receive this quickening power. if we ever expect to be in that general resurrection because it's the only thing that will ever bring us from the dead. For if the spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, it'll also quicken bring to life your mortal bodies. What a promise to us. You see again in the rising that was the Easter seal. This is the rising of the sun. We cannot do it by word only. We cannot do it by some tradition of man. We only reflect exactly what we're pointing to. I'm afraid today that too many of us are not getting people to Christ. We're getting them to a church, to a theory. But we must get them to Christ. He is the only one. And the only one that has life. He that has the son has life. Amen. You see, we're only reflecting exactly what we're pointing to. Amen. were pointing to scriptures such as Luke 17:30, Revelations 10, Malachi 4, St. John 12, St. John 14, Matthew 17, Joel 2, 1 Thessalonians 4, and all the scriptures pointing to this last day, and that is Christ. Every one of these end time scriptures are pointing to one thing, and that is Christ. Oh, if you can hide away in that now, in that secret place, you can eat and see the goodness and mercy of God. If you're sick, there is healing there. That's why I say there's healing in this message. There's mercy in this message because the message is not a man. The message is Christ. We're not trying to get you to a doctrine. Not trying to get you to a certain man. Not trying to get you to a personality. Not trying to get you from this church over to this church. We're trying to get you to Christ. Mercy is here. Deliverance is here. Grace, grace unto the headstone. It's Christ. [Music] [Applause] When you're eating this eagle food is the cravings from your theophony. When you're reading this message and you're in it and there's a pull and something is saying that's exactly what I needed. That's exactly what my family needs. You're hearing from your theophony and as you are feeding upon this vindicated revealed Christ. Uh it has given you strength. Uh you are not belonging to a chicken pin. You don't belong to some man. You belong to Christ. Uh you don't belong to a denomination. You don't belong to a system. You don't belong to some dead cold formal leisia. Amen. You belong to Christ. And we've heard from our theophony. We've heard the eagle scream, "Come up. Come up. There's a force. There's a magnetizing. Come up." And now it's your job. Flap the wings. Flap the wings. Now is your part. Get into the sky, little eagle. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Put your faith into action. [Music] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says, "The dynamics is the Holy Spirit. The mechanics don't run the church. It's the dynamics the Holy Ghost that gets into this word. It's not a seminary that teaches you all the theology and the Greek interpretations, but it's the dynamics of the Holy Ghost in there to set that a fire and bring it to pass to make it live just exactly what the promise word is for this hour. Not the mechanics, the dynamics. It takes mechanics and dynamics together. The word and the spirit, they are the one that gives life. The dynamics is the spark that ignites the word. That's why the prophet says, "We put so much emphasis on the mechanics. We've had the mechanics, but we've been waiting for the spark. And Christ himself uh has come down uh to spark your faith uh to ignite the word in your heart. Uh it'll heal you, deliver you, it'll restore marriages. Uh it'll change lives. Uh it'll preach the revival. It's the word made flesh. It's quickening power that quickens and brings resurrection life. Quickens the word into reality. manifestation of his resurrection. That's exactly what has happened in this hour. It's the quickening power is the manifestation of life upon life upon life. Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You see, it's the person of Jesus Christ himself returned in spirit form to manifest every promise for the last days. Luke 17:30 the so shall it be in the revealing of the son of man that is prophecy but revelations 10 1-7 was the fulfillment mercy has come the book that was closed the book of redemption was that was sealed up has now been open and mercy has been released look and live look and see your mercy seat Look and see your atonement. Look and see what God has done for us. There's healing in the book of redemption. There's deliverance in the book of redemption. There's rapturing faith. [Applause] But it's more than just a book. It's more than just a title deed. But you see the abstract &gt;&gt; had to come and make sure there was no leans upon the title deed. &gt;&gt; So God rich in mercy sent the Holy Ghost the dynamics &gt;&gt; to take it all the way back. Run it all the way back before there was a devil. Before there was sin, before you made one mistake, the Holy Ghost took it all the way back to the eternal thoughts of God. and he saw you there free, delivered, righteous, perfect, already glorified. And the Holy Ghost came back upon the title deed and said, "You're free to believe it. You're free to claim it. You're free to say, "This is my rights. I'm an heir to all that God has promised." What are you looking at? You got to look at the right thing. &gt;&gt; If you get off of just a little bit, you'll miss it. But you got to stick with the guide. You got to You can't go around and around in circles. You got to You can't get puffed up and say, "I've got this. I know how to get out of this wilderness." You've got You're just going to be in the death march. But the prophet of God said, "I thought I was a good guide, but he just kept doing circles." And he realized he needed something greater than himself. &gt;&gt; And church, we are tired of just denominational systems. We are tired of just man interpreting the message to us. We need the man Christ Jesus to bring a personal revelation of who we are and what we believe. [Music] We're in gross darkness. &gt;&gt; It's lay out a sea out there. But that's why the prophet of God said, "You got to come on up. You got to come out of the age to see what is promised for the age. &gt;&gt; You got to get out of the darkness to be able to see that there's light shining on scriptures for this day." There's your answer. &gt;&gt; Am I making sense to you? You see, you got if if all you can see is wilderness, but if someone can lift you up and you have a vision to see and say, "Oh, there it is." And that's what the prophet did. An eagle power, an anointing to lift you up and give you a vision and say, "There he is. Look." Don't get your eyes on the left or the right. Look. There's the dynamics. There's the quickening. There's your mercy. There is where there's the answer for your family. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; God is supernatural, &gt;&gt; but he can only operate in a people that believes him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And that's why faith is a revelation. And the son of man shall be revealed. And when you see him, it does something because you realize that's my answer. That's the Lord himself. That's the creator of heavens and earth. That's the power of his creative word that can make something out of nothing. And if I just hold to him, it'll change the situations. &gt;&gt; It'll change situations that look impossible. You see, Hebrews 13:8 is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; In other words, the In other words, the same pillar of fire that was with Moses, that came to Paul is the same one that came to William Brandom and it's the same one with us tonight. &gt;&gt; But where's he at? On the word. You got to believe the word. And that's why the prophet of God said, "I've come. I It's a fulfillment of Malachi 4. It's the fulfillment of Revelations 10:7. It's the fulfillment of the Leodysian church age messenger. What is he doing? He's stepping forth as a representative of the Amen, the faithful and true witness over the word. That's what the prophet is. He's only a representative of God. And in this age, it says, "I am the amen." What does that mean? I am the final say. I know the devil's been trying to tell you that he's got the final say over your life. It's a lie from the devil. It's God that's got the final say. It's this message that is praying blood over your life and saying it's God that's the author. He's the finisher. He's the absolute. He's the amen. He's got final supreme authority over your life. [Applause] That that demon that's trying to destroy your marriage, he don't have the final say. &gt;&gt; That demon of sickness that's trying to drag you to a premature grave, he don't have the final say. That demon that's trying to trying to work on your passion and make you lust and all these things, that doesn't have the final say. &gt;&gt; That spirit that's trying to just make you just come to church and go through the motion. I've been there. I know what it's about. You can shout just as good as anyone else. You can get out of the seat just as good as anyone else, but you're thinking of the next meal. I know what I'm talking about. This is more than just going through the motion. This is a revelation that this Christ that is here now present tense that can change your circumstance, change your situation. What about it, young people? You're the next generation. You're the final voice, the final age under your messenger. What about it, young people? I say this God lives. I say he still delivers from cancer. He still delivers from nervousness. He still delivers from oppression. He still delivers from depression. He still is the mighty conqueror. He's the final say over your life. [Applause] [Music] Don't let the devil lie to you &gt;&gt; and tell you that whispering his lies and telling you that he's going to make you do this and make you do that. That's a lie from the devil. &gt;&gt; If I if I asked for a show of hands, how many time How many How many times did you think that you were going to quit? Who all thought that you wouldn't even be here today? &gt;&gt; Young people, I want you to look around and see all the hands. Raise them high. &gt;&gt; The devil has told us over and over and over, you're not going to make it. &gt;&gt; 43 years of my life and the devil has hounded me and fought me and lied to me and said I would never even be here. But I'm here by the grace of God to tell you the devil don't have enough. The devil's lies is not the final say over you. Look to the word. What has come in this age? Again, it's not just a man trying to preach to you. It's the divine vindicated supreme authority of God. [Music] I'm not making it up. &gt;&gt; I'm spraying blood over your life. &gt;&gt; You're healed by his stripes. &gt;&gt; In my name, you shall cast out devils. Those demons of oppression can't stay in your life. Those demons of depression can't hold you. Those marriage conflicts can destroy you. [Applause] I stand here, these brothers stand here as a representative of the Lord himself and declare unto you there is a bleach that can dissolve your past, dissolve your sins. It's because the quickening power of God is here to change the situation. It's his mercy upon us. [Music] I know what I'm talking about. [Music] I've been ready to throw in the towel. &gt;&gt; I've been so punched drunk that I didn't think I would get off the mat. But I'm here by the grace of God. It's his mercy. &gt;&gt; The devil hasounded me and hounded me and hounded me and beat me and beat me and beat me. And I didn't think that I would ever get off of the mat again. But yet there was the devil saying one, two, three. He was about to count me out. But then a mercy, the son of man revealing himself in mercy. The dynamics of the Holy Ghost be to move and stir my soul and I couldn't stay down. It was because there was another force. There was another something motivating me. Get up. Keep going. Keep walking. Keep fighting the good fight of faith. Don't look to the left. Don't look to the right. Don't look to the scoffer, the critic. Look to him and live. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Every promise of God is just as real as the day he spoke them. &gt;&gt; It's not a painted fire. It's a reality of the living God. If you take God at his word, the prophet of God would show us, he would show us a great secret to faith that if the Lord Jesus was here, &gt;&gt; he could not heal you. He couldn't deliver you. &gt;&gt; Because it's already done. [Music] &gt;&gt; You know what he would do? The Lord Jesus would point you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Master, will you heal me? What is the word saying? Oh master, don't leave me in this laya of gross darkness to face tribulation. What does the word say? [Applause] Rise and shine for thy light has come. The revelation that you can't miss the rapture. You won't go in the You won't go in tribulation. You're already judged by the blood. [Music] [Applause] So let me ask you, &gt;&gt; if you're looking for healing, &gt;&gt; what does the word say? &gt;&gt; So are you healed? [Applause] &gt;&gt; Is there any sick among us? &gt;&gt; Then what does the word say? You're not looking to be healed. You're already healed. &gt;&gt; Now, let me take it to what the word says. He sent his word to heal you. And that's not just your physical. That is your soul. It's your spirit. It's your body. Everything is covered in the word. [Music] &gt;&gt; Now, that's why we can't just have mechanics only. We can't just have the fundamentals of the message memorization and knowing the quotes. I believe in that. I believe in knowing what the message says. We got to be grounded in the word, grounded in the message. But you see, then it's got to take the dynamics &gt;&gt; to make that flesh in you. [Music] And then in people, a son or a daughter of God that can say, "You know what? I can look in my past and I see what I used to be. I look now and I see what I am now." &gt;&gt; And you know, you've been quickened. &gt;&gt; What it does, such a change, &gt;&gt; such a change in the way we talk, the way we think, the way we act. It's because we've been quickened. &gt;&gt; It's because we have an understanding. I once was this way, but now I'm this way. There's been a nature change. What did it? It was because God said the dynamics. [Music] &gt;&gt; And then you who have been filled with the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; what does the prophet of God say? Then there's the power of transformation and it's just growing. Just keep watering it. &gt;&gt; Just your h you're priest unto God. Just keep watering the word with praise. Just keep watering that power, that dynamics, that quickening power in your life. Just keep watering it. Thank you, Jesus. You're the answer. Thank you, Lord. You're the same Elohim that appeared to Abraham. The same one, amen, that appeared to our prophet in this day. You're the same one that's in my life. You're the same one that changed my name from church to Mrs. Jesus Christ. Oh, I love you. I thank you, Lord. You've never left me. You've never forsaken me. You're with me until the end of the world. Keep watering it. Keep walking in the promises of God. Keep under expectation. If God did this, he'll do it again. If he filled your watch, he'll give you a refilling because the dynamics is a refilling of the Holy Ghost. And it's refilling upon revealing upon revealing. [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The dynamics is the water &gt;&gt; upon a hungry heart. &gt;&gt; David said as the heart penth for the water brook, so my soul penth for thee, oh God. And sometimes a Christian goes to the valley of the shadow of death, but we're not fearing any evil. But it's in that valley of temptation we start getting a uh we need a we need a fresh drink. &gt;&gt; We got to pull our swords and break through some demonic forces and say, "Oh God, give me a fresh drink of that Pentecostal water. Just give me a refilling of the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; I don't care how long you've been in this message. We need the Holy Ghost. I don't care if it's your first day or if you've been here for 60 years. We need the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Oh, give me a refilling. Give me an outpouring of the Holy Ghost. Just pour it out. Pour out the rain. Pour out the water. Open the windows of heaven. Let your doctrine fall like rain. No God. &gt;&gt; You see, you can have electricity and know that you got power and know that it's a good wire. I'm an electrician. I know what it is to have a man. You you you take you take that wire and you're running it through the ceilings and but then you know that after you made all of the proper connections, the last connection you make is to the power source. &gt;&gt; You can have all of the connections, you can have all of the mechanics, but when it's connected to the power source, &gt;&gt; then you know what you do? There is a man here that can turn on the light. [Applause] When you turn on that breaker, &gt;&gt; I don't know what you call them here, but in the United States, we call them breaker. &gt;&gt; We we flip that breaker and all of a sudden &gt;&gt; and then you know what you can do? You just kind of sit back and look at your labor and say, "It is good. It's connected to the power source. &gt;&gt; You see, the prophet of God says that it's just like the little It's just like the boy and the girl that went down into the cave and went way deep into the earth. And then all of the sudden, there was a man who turned the power off. And the little girl began to scream and cry. And but you see, there was a little there was a little brother that be to that be to cry out to the little sister. and say, "Fear not, little sister. There is a man here that can turn on the light." I know there's been people that has tried to say that the man here that can turn on the light is William Brandham. But you see, William Brandham was the brother. And our brother was speaking to the bride, the little sister, and saying, "Little sister, don't fear. There is a mighty God, the mighty one among us that's here and he can turn on the light. He can turn on the light in your situation. And I just want to declare, rise and shine. Thy light has come. There is a man here right now in this generation and he's turned the light on. Now, what are we looking at? We're not looking at defeat. We're looking at victory cuz we are his victory. &gt;&gt; You see now the prophet of God says what he wants is he wants his bride position &gt;&gt; that his spirit can flow freely. &gt;&gt; The dynamics is here. &gt;&gt; The leadership is here. But now he's putting the word positionally, the bride positionally in the word &gt;&gt; that you can believe every promise &gt;&gt; that it's not. Yes, I believe that. I believe that. Oh, but I don't know about that. &gt;&gt; You see, before there was the break or there was fuses. &gt;&gt; Y'all know what I'm talking about? &gt;&gt; Fuses. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, when when as an electrician, I would go to an old home and I would go to their panel and it's old &gt;&gt; and it would have fuses and they would call me and say, "My fuses are blowing." &gt;&gt; And I I I I I would actually look down and there was a pile of blown fuses. &gt;&gt; You see what they were doing is they put the fuse in and it blew. So, they just got a new one &gt;&gt; and they put it in and it blew and they thought, "Well, maybe I can put another one in and it'll hold this time." &gt;&gt; So, they put it in, that one blew. &gt;&gt; Before long, they just had a pile of blown fuses. And they and they said, you know, I don't I I can't figure it out. &gt;&gt; So, they called someone to try to tell them where the problem is. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So then I begin to run the circuit and I found out where it's grounded. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it was just a broke wire that burnt in maybe a box or electrical outlet or something of that nature. So once I corrected the splice, &gt;&gt; put it all together, &gt;&gt; but the correct union &gt;&gt; where the word and the bride are one &gt;&gt; in perfect harmony. &gt;&gt; That the bride is not fussing with the groom and the bride's not trying to tell the groom how to run his business. [Applause] But the the the the the splash, the union has been corrected and it's right. &gt;&gt; Then I go take the fuse. &gt;&gt; And it's not blowing. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says that God is tired of blown fuses. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, he didn't just say, "God's tired of blowing fuses and then leave us." He sent a prophet to fix it. &gt;&gt; And says, "Get out of those denominational ideas." &gt;&gt; That's why he began to tell us, "We're turning a corner. &gt;&gt; We're not just building a wall. We're building a building. &gt;&gt; And a building is what is the temple of the living God. &gt;&gt; And God has sent me here." This is a prophet saying, "God has sent me here to build powerhouses. He's He sent me here to build up the individual, to build you up in the faith of the hour." [Music] &gt;&gt; Because under those denominational teachers, there was blown fuses all the time because you didn't know if you could believe it or not. But now the word has been given to a small child, &gt;&gt; to a mama, to a daddy &gt;&gt; and they can look for themselves and say, "Why I believe that?" &gt;&gt; You see, the Holy Ghost has been bound up, &gt;&gt; been bound up in traditions and creeds and dogmas. Those denominational rivers have withheld the Holy Ghost for 2,000 years. &gt;&gt; But the prophet of God said, "I have come to break down the barrier to loose the Holy Ghost because my message has fixed the break. My message has been so real that it has brought the head, the bridegroom and the bride as one union. Now let the Holy Ghost flow. Let the Holy Ghost move because we believe it. We believe the word. We believe it from cover to cover. We believe it from cover to cover and everything in between. It's because the connection has been fixed. [Applause] &gt;&gt; But you watch it &gt;&gt; because if you're hearing the prophet say something, but then you know brother so and so said it a little bit differently, you'll break your connection again. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's why the final power to this age is the eagle power. &gt;&gt; And you get out of the word for this day, it's going to break the connection. &gt;&gt; But God has sent you for this age to prove to Satan that we are not like Eve, but we are following the headship of the word and we believe all of it. And it's taken us to the to the perfect Eden again. You don't have to back up for one promise of God. &gt;&gt; Abraham refused to look at the deadness of his body. Refused to look at the circumstance of Sarah. He just kept testifying. I'm a son of God. I'm going to have that promise. I refused to look to the deadness of Sarah's womb. I am looking to a promise. I'm looking in the mirror. I am a father. &gt;&gt; His testimony. I'm a father. So is the testimony of this bride. I am the bride. I am pregnant. I am manifesting Christ. [Applause] Don't look at the deadness of your flesh. Don't look at your mistakes. Look to the promise. Let the blood take care of your flesh. I'm not saying live in sin, but it's the blood that breaks the stronghold. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's his mercy &gt;&gt; that the quickening power has come to break the stronghold of unbelief in our life. &gt;&gt; You see, the prophet says there is where Satan got in to make it all mechanics and no dynamics and all dynamics and no mechanics. We've got to put it together. We've got the power of the Holy Spirit, but we've got to come back with the word to feed this machine. &gt;&gt; You see, Satan's about to start riding. &gt;&gt; We've had anti antichrist teaching. We've had a pope over that teaching. &gt;&gt; But now, Satan's about to be incarnate. &gt;&gt; And it's going to be in the man of sin. It's going to be in that pope. and he's going to rule the world, &gt;&gt; but I've got some good news. &gt;&gt; That Jesus Christ is not finished writing. &gt;&gt; I I I I I don't want to say anything contrary, amen, to to to any ideas, but I'm just going to tell you maybe what the way I see it &gt;&gt; is because the prophet of God said, "I'll ride this trail again." And there's people waiting for brother Brandham to raise up from the dead to finish that. But I'm just going to say this Christ that he introduced us to, this word is still riding. [Applause] &gt;&gt; It's riding in bride form. &gt;&gt; This power, this Holy Ghost power, this message is riding in bride form. The mighty conqueror is in your flesh. The dynamics have come to the mechanics. The move is on. Something's moving us, motivating us, compelling us. [Music] [Applause] They're look they're Satan's going to ride. But I'm telling you, the Lord himself is riding &gt;&gt; and he's in your flesh. We've turned a corner. It moved from just the Holy Ghost, the seven church ages, to the Holy Ghost himself. More than just a sensation, more than just a baptism, more than just a good church service. It's Christ stepping into mamas and daddy's, boys and girls. [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Deity is not in heaven. It's in you. &gt;&gt; I am the word. If you want deity in your midst, then welcome and receive the word. &gt;&gt; Now, here's the rest of that. Don't ever let anyone or anything get between you and that word. &gt;&gt; I'm closing. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm feeling good. &gt;&gt; I feel like we got the devil on the run and &gt;&gt; and I love giving giving him a good whapon. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, if you want, the prophet of God's given you a scripture now. He says, if you want to put it down, 1 Corinthians 4:20, the kingdom of God is God's word made power. &gt;&gt; What is the kingdom of God is within you. &gt;&gt; The kingdom's in you. And when the word comes in there, what does this word begin? It turns itself into power. &gt;&gt; Now catch this. now making it say just exactly what it said. &gt;&gt; The word coming into you, &gt;&gt; the kingdom of God, the word turning itself into power. What does that power do? It doesn't lead you to go be some &gt;&gt; the power of the dynamics in you gives you the power to take this word &gt;&gt; and say it again. &gt;&gt; You see the revelation has come to us. The voice of God has spoken. The mystery is no longer a mystery. It's a clear real voice. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But then the commission to you little bride is go to that angel &gt;&gt; take the book. &gt;&gt; Eat the book &gt;&gt; because you're going to have to prophesy. And we're not prophesying anything different than that prophet &gt;&gt; because he Christ the mighty angel is now in you &gt;&gt; speaking exactly what he spoke to that prophet. &gt;&gt; And now you're not just &gt;&gt; just a little housewife that has no power, no authority. &gt;&gt; But now the kingdom of God is in you. His word made power giving you the authority to say the same thing. You hear that prophet say you're healed. Stand up and say I'm healed. That prophet says you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of Jesus Christ. Stand up and say I am the pure virtuous sinless bride of Jesus Christ. The prophet of God begins to take us to that perfect atonement and say the covenant has come back into full effect. The same ministry that was in Jesus Christ has come back into the perfect word again. And we say amen to it. &gt;&gt; If he hit on 16 cylinders, the bride will hit on 16 cylinders. She will not fall short. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You see, it's turning itself into power, &gt;&gt; making you say amen to the word, &gt;&gt; but then it's coming right through your mouth. Oh, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You see, I I believe that's where we're at. &gt;&gt; I believe that there is sons and daughters of God so full of the dynamic power of the Holy Ghost. They're saying the same thing, &gt;&gt; believing it, saying it, speaking it, testifying of it, just waving that promise. &gt;&gt; Just waving that promise. I don't have the time to go into it, but the prophet of God and the rising of the sun, amen, takes us to that to that scripture. Amen. That that when the first fruits, they're to cut down that first the first sheath and wave it before the people. &gt;&gt; You see, you see the prophet of God says when you come into the position &gt;&gt; that I told you, &gt;&gt; you see the prophet of God is showing, I'm telling you something. I've been telling you it's coming and now it's here &gt;&gt; and you're coming into the position. Then he would take us later and show us the position is mechanics and dynamics together. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When you come into that place, &gt;&gt; then the car begins to move down the road. The prophet of God said it wasn't coming. The prophet of God is saying, "I'm telling you. This is what I've been showing you. &gt;&gt; I've been telling you about this. And now I'm declaring this is my Easter message to you. &gt;&gt; Mechanics and dynamics are together." [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God is telling you, "There's your position, mama. There's your position, daddies. There's your position, preachers. There's your position, musicians, in that position. You are sons and daughters of God that have every right to stand there shoulders back and say, "Satan, you have no part of my life." [Applause] In that position &gt;&gt; is where the creative power of the spoken word is. &gt;&gt; If God told you to move a mountain or whatever, I believe that we would do it. &gt;&gt; But I'm telling you right now, this is God's spoken word. &gt;&gt; And I know the devil's trying to say it's too simple, but I'm telling you, it's the truth. &gt;&gt; You have the power. You have are in position with mechanics and dynamics to take this message and speak it through your lips and see God back it. &gt;&gt; See God back your claim. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Take some gumption &gt;&gt; and st and take what the prophet said. There's a bride standing to her feet. The word is in the bride and she knows what to do with it because it's not the mind of a man. It's the intelligence of God. [Music] [Applause] So many are confused to know what to do with it. It's because we're not in the message enough. Get in the message and you'll know what to do with the word. Stay with the word &gt;&gt; and it makes it power. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever &gt;&gt; if you abide in me and my words in you. &gt;&gt; I'm probably over time. &gt;&gt; Let me just My goodness. &gt;&gt; Let Let me just put it like this. I've got so much here, but I I I just preached too much. There was a there there was a man whose car broke down &gt;&gt; and he took it to a little mechanic and that little mechanic combed over that car, went through it, checked this, checked that, couldn't find the problem. Looked like there was nothing wrong with that car, couldn't find the problem. somehow or another. And after a while, he's getting nervous and frustrated and and the man is saying, "Listen, I need my car or I'm late for my my appointment." The man says, "Sir, I'm trying the best that I can and he's nervous." Finally, there was a man there was a man that was well-dressed came over to him and said, "Sir, said, "Can I help you?" &gt;&gt; Said, "Well, yeah, I mean, I guess sir, why don't you try this and this and this?" &gt;&gt; Okay. When he tried that, &gt;&gt; it started right up. &gt;&gt; All it was was just a little connection. But there was a man &gt;&gt; that knew how to fix &gt;&gt; the connection. &gt;&gt; Just a little something &gt;&gt; to fix that and the and then the spark would come back again. The current would come back through the automobile. &gt;&gt; The man had sense enough. The little mechanic had enough sense to say, "Sir, who are you?" &gt;&gt; You know who he was? &gt;&gt; He He was the chief designer &gt;&gt; of of GM, General Motors. &gt;&gt; He designed the thing. [Music] [Applause] There is a man here &gt;&gt; dressed in the power of his presence. [Music] [Applause] And if there's a blockage in your life, maybe you've grown cold, maybe your wick has got a little bit of crust on it, but there's a man here. All you've got to do is be willing to trim your lamp. All you've got to be, you just need enough sense to say, "Oh, God, &gt;&gt; I believe you're here. &gt;&gt; I know you can fix my problem. &gt;&gt; I know you can bring the current flowing through my life. &gt;&gt; I know you can bring revival in my heart again." You see, the prophet would tell us, "Does the does the Baptist know how to put the bride and rapturing order?" &gt;&gt; Or does the Methodist? &gt;&gt; How about the Pentecostals? &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says, "He's the designer of this bride. He's the designer of his word. &gt;&gt; He knows how to put his bride in rapture order. And the Lord himself has come on the scene. &gt;&gt; This bride, can I just say it like this? You don't lack for anything. &gt;&gt; When you got the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; healing's in there. &gt;&gt; Victory is in there. &gt;&gt; Salvation. rapture, &gt;&gt; adoption, [Music] &gt;&gt; then the prophet of God says, "Then then what do I have to do? &gt;&gt; Just keep drinking." You see the little seed &gt;&gt; in that tree that's growing. If he could look at that mature oak tree, he would look and say, "Well, my, you're so big. You're so tall. You're strong." And but he would look and say, "Son, you'll be me one of these days. &gt;&gt; But all you've got to do is just drink. &gt;&gt; Don't worry about anything. Don't fret any about anything. Don't try to work something up. Don't try to make it happen. Just drink. [Music] &gt;&gt; You hear the prophet preaching. You hear your pastor preaching. Something strikes your heart. And then you just start drinking. Oh, God. Yes, Lord. That's me. That's what I want. All of a sudden, the prophet begins to speak and conviction strikes your heart and you realize that you've been doing wrong. You don't have to wallow in self-pity. You don't have to fall apart and say, "I guess I'm just not bride." No. All you do is just say, "Oh, God, thank you for revealing that to me. Lord, forgive me." And just start drinking. &gt;&gt; You've offended a brother, offended a sister, go to him, make it right, but don't just stay there in regrets and hate and bitterness. Just drink and keep moving. &gt;&gt; I wonder just if if you could just play something &gt;&gt; just Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe something in your heart the last service [Music] and this this Ohio boy is going home. But I I I really have I when brother Isaac asked me to come, I I felt just a burden to come. just talked to your pastor just a few moments and found out his heart was for for his people and [Music] to bring healing and whatever it is. If you're backsliden come then then it then you can come back. &gt;&gt; If you're a little cold, you can come back. &gt;&gt; If you need a refilling, you can have it. I hope we've laid enough word in over these last two or three days, these last three days, that there can be a real faith that you can just reach out and say, "Yes, Lord." Whatever your situation, whatever your circumstance, I as I've been preaching, I I I I've just seen God just dealing with different hearts. Maybe you'd like to make this your moment. Say, "God, just whatever it is, if you need healing, if you need to repent of something, if you just need a refreshing, whatever it is, the Lord himself is here. It It's not a It's not a not a preacher up here just spitting and acting like a crazy person. But if you can just realize who is here and look cuz what I'm trying to do is point you to the one who has the answer for you. &gt;&gt; He's your answer. &gt;&gt; This word, it's your answer. This message, God's proven it's your answer. We we can see that that when God came in the book of I believe first Kings and he asked is there no physician? If there is then why is the daughter of my people sick? Brother Brandham would show us and say we've got the answer. We've got the cure for sin. We've got the way back. We've got everything that we have need of. The atonement is in full effect. Would you like to just take a few moments and just bow your head? Even if there's someone that just wants to come up for prayer, you're welcome to, but just take a few moments and just say, "Lord, would you help me? I believe that you're revealing yourself in mercy right now. And Lord, I I'm exposed in your presence. Lord, would you come and heal me? Would you come and change my life? Would you come and move in my situation? God will do it. God's merciful. God loves you. He cares. Lord Jesus, you see your children. You see the hearts they're laying exposed before you right now. I pray, Father, that you would minister to them, Lord. God rich in mercy, we would be just like the world. We We would be doomed for hell. We would be in gross darkness. We would be in confusion. We would be so overwhelmed. But God, rich in mercy. You said this is a mansized job and you come right into the fiery furnace with us. It's you who is keeping us. It's you who is protecting us. It's you who is saying, "Satan, you've went far enough. You can't go any longer. You can't go any further." Oh, God. Rich and mercy. Bless everyone, Lord. Bless their hearts, Father. Give them strength and encouragement, Father. Lord, we're looking for your soon return. We believe that any day now, Lord, that we're going to change from this old temporal body, we're going to put this old pest house aside and we're going to step into that immortal body. Lord, we don't know how many more battles we've got to face. But Lord, as long as we're facing them with you, we know we can never be defeated. We know there's not enough nervous devils to keep us down. There's not enough oppression to keep us down. There's not enough sin and unbelief in the world that can hold this bride back. And it's not because of us. It's because you're here watching over us. You swore with an oath that you would not leave us, not forsake us, but you would be with us, even in us. and you would manifest yourself to us. Bless your children in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen and amen. Hallelujah. Power break every chain. Break every chain. There is power in the name of Jesus. There is power in the name of Jesus. Oh, there is power in the name of Jesus.
