here i want to also greet all the ministers and pastors here and salute to the brethren who have gone before me preaching the word god bless you be so glad to be part of this great bright movement as rupee pearson leave here but this is what all this gathering is about to prepare our lives to meet jesus if it's not to prepare us then we are gathered in vain but we are here to get ready for the coming of the lord so god bless you from your bibles i'd like you to turn to three portion scriptures tonight from habakkuk chapter two i want to read verse one to four genesis 18 1 verse verse 14 and also romans 12 verse one and two scripture reading tonight i'll become chapter two beautiful verse one i will stand upon my watch and set me up on the tar and was watched to see what he will see unto me and what i shall answer when i am reproved and the lord answered me and said write the vision i'll make it plain upon tables that he'd run that readed it for the vision is yet for an appointed time and at the end it shall speak and not lie do it tarry wait for it because it will surely come it will not tarry behold his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him but that just shall live by his faith genesis chapter 18 verse 14. is anything too hard for the lord at the time appointed i will return unto thee according to the time of life and sarah shall have a son we want to go into romans chapter 12. within those first two verses there i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your body is a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is a reasonable service i'll be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god let us bow ahead so we'll pray heavenly father we we stand in your presence tonight and we are so dependent upon you that you would give the option to speak and the unction to hear bless the hearers of your word lord interpret it to their hearts may they see the plainness of god that they will know how to conduct themselves in the present day that they live in granted father and bring their bodies into the behavior of the word granted god and jesus might ask it amen you may be seated o praise the lord blessed be the name of the lord [Music] but tonight i have a title the vision is yet for an appointed time the vision is yet for an appointed time and i have an inspiration catch the vision and cope with the world that's the inspiration that i have catch the vision and cope with the word now jesus he rebuked his own disciples when they didn't have a real positive testimony when he was talking to them after he rose from the dead he actually told them all fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory so he was telling them i mean you're supposed to know this stuff because i told you i'll be offered i told you all these things but he went on and did something to them and he the bible says that these are the words this is luke this is from 2444 which i spoke unto you while i was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which was written in the law of moses and in the prophets and in the psalms concerning me then open he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures and said unto them thus it is written and does it behooves christ to suffer and arise from the third day or from the dead on the third day and so on and verse 49 he's pretend he's presenting to them so now that he's opened the understanding to the scripture opening the word to them he is presenting to them the vision of what they must expect and what they have to look forward to what was the target what was the endgame what was the goal and he said behold i send the promise of my father upon you but tarry in the city of jerusalem until you be endured with power from on high you'll always say stay there until stay there until this power that has been loosed by my father because i pay the price i pay the price i just come off the cross i am now risen from the dead and now that i have done that nothing could stop the power from being released the power is on its way but be in position to receive it and he jesus led them as far as the bethany he lifted up his hands and blessed them and it came to pass while he blessed them he was part in from them so he was leaving now nobody was crying nobody was depressed nobody was frustrated and jesus was leaving and they worship him and return to jerusalem with great joy he's gone oh hallelujah he have left us glory what do you think happened there jesus told him if i don't go the comforter will not come and they knew he was leaving something else is coming or give the lord a shout in the house oh hallelujah and that is when and they were and they were continually in the temple praising and blessing god because now their mind is open up the understanding is open up the world has been broke to them praise god they don't have to look for some man to interpret more words to them they don't have to look for some bishop somewhere or some man of god from somewhere or a certain man have to come and do this and this certain man did have to look for that no more they got spoken word they got jesus own words they got the breath of god receiving the holy ghost they got the breath of god upon their life no man didn't speak it as god spoke it and we are promised we have been promised according to luke 17 30 the son of man would be revealed again that's not a son of man that's the son of man so this son of man was failed in that prophet the son of man was failed in william branham so the words coming on that prophet's mouth wasn't william branham's words watch the words of the son of man and he the son of man who came to abraham he said i will return unto thee according to the time of life there's an appointed time this vision of god this prophetic vision that was released by seven seals and seven thunders there's an appointed time for this vision to be fulfilled but it shall be fulfilled it shall come to pass god swore by himself that ain't going to come to pass oh do you believe that this evening oh glory to god [Applause] hallelujah call you might be caesar oh hallelujah so when god came down in genesis 18 genesis 19 to tell them i will return to thee according to time of light two angels went down to seram under investigating judgment isn't that right but one angel stayed in the backside of the desert with abraham another angel said the lord said shall i hide from abraham the thing which i about to do so god had to break the seals on the back side of the desert to abraham to reveal to abraham judgment was next coming to sodom oh glory to god but abraham as the elect had to get the divine revelation and vision as things that ought to be oh glory to god we believe that and because god broke that upon abraham abraham broke into intercession to plea for lot because luck was a believer backslidden but a believer formal but a believer lukewarm but a believer it was family or glory to god and you cannot break revelation 22 17 and the spirit and the bread say come it has to be a scriptural voice oh hallelujah so abraham was anointed with revelation 20 through 17 to go after his brother lot oh glory to god isn't that right oh hallelujah praise praise is his family isn't that right and abraham plead before god if there is 50 if there's 25 if there is 10 and they couldn't find 10 10 with christ living in them and god sentenced that city to judgment and that same god oh sentence the world to judgment oh hallelujah because we are back to sudden condition today again we are back into sodom condition again and it has to be a manifestation of the revealing of the son of man again but this time in a body bride that is what you're called to do to give one final witness and they're going to be a voice going out the spirit and the prides that come they don't even know what they would what the world is going to head for oh glory i could see a woman going to the bank start among them or she going to collect a pay but they didn't know next morning fire was coming i could see somebody carrying their children amen into the babysitter but they wasn't seeing fire was coming on the backside of the desert seals being open mysteries being revealed vision being made clear and they don't see the seals of judgment is about to be poured out with the wrath of god or glory to god and people have sat so long enough in this message it become ordinary it become normal like if nothing has taken place like if the law delay is coming and they're fighting one another and accusing one another and chopping on one another but the vision is for an appointed time the vision is correct the vision is thus saith the lord we have not been gathered in vain seven thunders goddess the bride together not the ministers association seven thunders seven thunders whatever them thunders are it's going to gather the bride together a prophet spoke it that's an exclusive bright promise that's why you're here tonight no devil in hell could stop the brand from these promises because the devil himself don't have a clue of what's under that seventh seal is only the brand ordained to go under there oh hallelujah praise god [Applause] this is hidden from the devil this is hidden from the wise and the prudent this is revealing on the babe such as would learn or glory to god you may be seated what did god say in habakkuk right division and make it plain not complicated plain not difficult plain not you scratching your hair trying to figure out what the man of god is trying to say we're not trying to say anything the lord god has spoken [Applause] [Music] the lord god has spoken we're not trying to say anything we have a message and it starts here the lord we have the king's message oh glory to god hallelujah let's be seated [Applause] no no here tight no job inside no ammo right no philistine going to stop the bride from possessing her redemptive rights not when the lamb took the book not when the lamb gave the prophet the book not when the mighty angel came down with the book and the redemptive rights have been revealed no no no no no no no oh glory to god michael fought in the dragon fort this battle way in you may be seated didn't start on earth it started in heaven so if you think you wore in and you warned it started way back in heaven there was no whiskey up there nobody was more smoking marijuana nobody was going no no no no no no no no no no was just this that's the ambition of of lucifer wanting the kind of worship that we give in our god this morning because the father secrets such to worship him and lucifer got jealous and wanted to worship and we were represented by those angels and we say who you not you you not getting this worship oh glory to god and the first overthrow and coup was in heaven hallelujah trying to make a coup to choke off his throne and instead of throwing god off god kick him off and fell to the earth and the battle of angels became the battle of men that's why we are here tonight to give you a sword in your hand to give your shoes on your feet to give you a shield to give you a breath split oh glory to god this is not a game it's another name we're not here to entertain you may be seated praise god hebrews chapter 4 says let us therefore fear lisa promise left us of entering into his rest any of you should come short of it so the promise is to enter into his rest or glory to god hallelujah because the word was preached so all of them but it wasn't mixed with faith so god had to bring the faith to mix with the word i promised for this hour we couldn't even go forward until we go backwards let me say that again we couldn't go forward until we pick up the faith that was once delivered to the saints so god sent our prophet to go back and pick it up bring it here that we could deal with them devils trying to cut us off from the resurrection [Applause] did you get that it takes perfection to bring on the resurrection this vision is a vision of perfection not church anybody could go to church anybody could join church this is perfection this is seven voices this is seven perfect spirits this is the rainbow living in you thundering in you this is what this is about [Applause] i don't want nothing less than that [Applause] oh glory forgive me forgive me tonight i'm getting excited oh my god didn't promise me a stipend you put me same pay keep the stipend until you get the same pay you give me something to hold a small measure to work with but the same day mean just what peter had just what paul had just what the early church had we have to have it back nothing less than that which man on earth right now could say like peter silver and gold highlight none such as a higher which man we want that we have to get back [Applause] when peter met that man and they get caught beautiful remember she said he's a whole hold on come back with a spoken book for you hold on hold on bring it up where you live again give me address in the email address are coming by you tonight to play a tape was not playing that tape the man don't even hear tape you scribble he needs to walk you're blind you need to see you're bang you need to be loosed you're dumb you need to speak [Applause] you need to pay your taxes you need to catch a fish the gospel being preached and ministering to the needs of the people present tense oh man you may be seated g you may be seated jesus had dominion over fish cook fish jesus had dominion over cooked bread he could multiply it he said this is one i can make a two i can make two to be four i can make four become eight i can multiply whatever you put in my hands i don't have to accept this as one bread this is two fishes this is i don't have to accept that i could make it what i want to make it i can make a revival right here in a new room right now that's the gospel let me see it that's the gospel maybe be seated [Applause] some brothers brought the friend on a pilot they have a policy or whatever to not on on a stretcher came to this church service and and it couldn't get no way in it's packed out nobody got washing him there's no deacon there's nothing they can't come in and those brothers refuse to go back home like that they said we come too far there was no bus there was no taxi there was no car they walked with that guy that was their friend they walk with him because they heard jesus is in town and if jesus is wrong something has to happen jesus either turning water into wine multiplying bread wherever something has to be taken place jesus isn't a quiet man there is always activity around jesus some prostitute being forgiven somebody being healed some blind eye opening some devil being cast out once jesus is wrong [Applause] and what those guys did to tear up the roof and let down the man in front of jesus you think they're wasting time you think the idol you think they don't have faith they have to have faith to climb the roof that's our faith to pull them the guy who on the stretcher had to think that these guys have hit it must have been painful to go up the wall side of that building but when he left in front of jesus he was letting down and coming up in the atmosphere it was all around jesus so he was coming along in the atmosphere my god and jesus said which is easier to say wake up your bed and walk or die still be forgiving me he said which one which one i could do both i can forgive you of your sins and free you from your condition oh you want to go free tonight who the son of man set free it's free indeed oh you can go free tonight may be seated so when god given the promise of the promised land long in egypt the prophet said god came down to make this promise a reality so it's good to say we have a promise but the promise has to become a reality hallelujah glory to god these guys were so inspired god told abraham 100 years before that he was going to do it jesus said don't move my bones i'm here until you go to the promised land and bury me with the rest of my fathers because you know the resurrection was coming oh glory to god each one of them prophets knowed what the other prophet said so they were consulting the prophetic utterance oh glory to god of those men of god that went before them to see what the prophecies say because all of them knew it was men that was moved by the spirit [Applause] so they were not speaking from the intellectual level they were speaking from the intelligence of god that drop down into their heart to give them gossip of the lord [Applause] [Music] so abraham said bury me right here where jew was buried said sarah i'm gonna buy a piece of crap we're gonna be buried right here isaac was a prophet after his dad he said listen do you bury me here don't leave egypt take me right to the promised land oh glory to god so that's how they were you may be seated when joseph died years later he said don't bury me here take my bones with you because god will surely visit you so they were in the spirit they knew our resurrection is promised they were looking for it so much that they could say don't put me don't leave me in egypt because that's a non general pass in egypt at all that anointing is only coming in the promised land if you stay in egypt you can't get this anointing you got what i'm saying glory listen one time one time they were burying a man and they heard some enemy coming and they flicked that man in the grave of elijah and when they just throw him and just run when that body hit elijah pose quickness power quickly listen the bible didn't say that i was a christian that was an ordinary man but when that dead man hit quitting power it bring the dead back to life and if the quickening power on elijah bones could bring a dead man to life what about elijah coats william branham died since 1965 and we are resting we are resting on this coach on these words because the spirit the prophet and the bride will say the same thing and what they said would already be said in the world [Applause] oh it's got to be a promise to enter into the rest what to fear that we don't have a promise but we have a promise the promise is to enter into his rest you may be seated [Applause] hallelujah tonight to fight to get into his rest because his rest is the promise what abraham said this year he said watch notice let us there for fear lisa promise being left us to enter into this rest so i want you to remember that unless we final unless god reveal it to us here we go no matter how much we go to church that has nothing to do with it god must come by revelation and reveal himself to us and that takes all the teams of the world that's not good i'm not hearing enough amens on that [Applause] that's something like sixty percent it sounds like a one i had to read it again maybe you didn't get it yet god must come by revelation and reveal himself to us and that takes all the world of all that in the world because once it's being being made plain to you you could run if you read it don't walk you'll run with it because you run with a message it is clear to you that you're not only coming for your soul all your spirit you're coming for your very body itself you want to be completely redeemed oh hallelujah praise god amen brother branham now remember now remember you may be seated they were on their road to rest the pillar of fire led them and we want to find out what is this rest watch so first you have to enter into this rest but you shouldn't come short of it so when you know you have a promise don't come short of it you want to be faithful to the promise of god you want to see it manifested in your life not in the church but in your life and then you could come to church with it in your life you want to start revival in your home you can't start something in the church what you don't have in your home you have to get it on the inside inside that way just when you pray go in the secret closet and pray that your heavenly father who sees in secret will reward you openly oh give the lord a shout hallelujah praise god as the prophet said no minister being a revival the revival have to come for the people you have to [Applause] you have the revival you have to bring it look you're starting it right now right now by your worship by your shouts by your amends by your hallelujah you are creating the atmosphere right now [Applause] may be seated here is the promise here is what we got to fear if there's not a promise left us but the prophet said but there is a promise and the next thing don't come short of it now the thought is if we are on our way to the rest what is the rest where is it it is joining church is it being baptized in a certain way is it becoming a member of the greatest church in the city where in better clothes it is education is it money so we can quit work and just lay down rest the rest of our lives that's not it listen to what the bible says it is let us therefore fear lisa promise left us to enter into his rest that you should come short of it for unto us the gospel was preached as well unto them what is the gospel the good news the good news came to them in egypt that god has sent a deliverer he's going to bring us out and take us to the promised land the good news to us now is that god sent a deliverer the holy ghost and we are on the road to the promised land and the people has made queens and denominations but god still remains that our rest is the holy ghost so this rest is the holy ghost we are pressing towards the holy ghost that's our promised land it's the land of the holy ghost in that land of power in that land of deliverance in that land of freedom in that land of miracles in that manner of anointing in that manner of contact with the supernatural in that land of angels descending angels walking back and forth that's in that land oh it's a good man or he is here tonight oh glory to god amen hallelujah so brother rahm says here the word preached did not prophet them not being mixed with faith and then they heard it so afterwards you'd have to go beyond your shout and praise you have to be praising god and applying it to your own heart he said no no matter how much the word is preached how well you like the way it's been preached unless you yourself are a partaker of that it won't do you one bit of good so you got to say this is minds man i'm taking it tonight am i taking it back home to my wife oh glory to god husband love your wife that's the word oh glory to god you have to express it you have to show it you have to live it take it back home hallelujah praise be to jesus oh glory to god amen hallelujah you may be seated so genesis 1 god said let every seed bring forth after its kind and god could only speak that because god knows the seed of the power to transform itself into whatever the seed is isn't that right and but abraham was talking about transform to be made different to what has been it's character and everything has to be changed and that's the word to be transformed isn't that right and god saw cares and darkness and god saw the condition but that didn't intimidate god darkness and chaos and confusion didn't intimidate god all that has to happen is the spirit have to move and once the spirit moves it has to have a voice because god has to use the voice of his word oh glory to god it's not just the spirit move the spirit have to connect with the voice the voice have to speak and the word becomes that seed to produce the miracle oh glory to god so god transformed chaos into a garden of eden isn't that right everything was perfect he commanded each one of those seas of what they would be that they would transform themselves into the plant of which kind of life that the word of god spoken in them should be if it was an oak tree it was to bring forth an oak it was a palm it was written for the palm because the creator just sent this word and everything under his control now when he put the seed in the earth the seed can only comfort with the power of life within it and that is why god put that seed in you when before the foundation of the world you are not in charge of that seed that's his seed oh glory to god let me say it again you are not in charge of that seed the predestinated mystery of who you are he's in charge of that it's who he for you he called he had to knew you before that's why he called you because he knew the seed where they planted in nigeria your scene whatever village whatever state he had to find you and you know where you are oh glory to god that mother eagle know where you are there's a seed inside of you oh yes you have fleshly habits yes you have your human spirit you didn't even know you had a seed when you were smoking and drinking but god was looking after you all the time because you know one day you have to hear that call you have to hear that call oh glory to god listen we were dead in sin and we heard a call and the people that are dead in the grave they're gonna hear a call one day too oh glory to god god call you the baptist church of methodist church god call you the university of the drunkenness out of adultery of the fornication god could call you further and transform you into a son and daughter of the living god to reproduce and manifest jesus christ do you believe it amen each one of those seeds here we go you may be seated each one of those seeds has the power in itself i love this to transform itself into the species that i desire it to be that is what make me that that's what it must be because i have given every seed here we go transforming power to make out of itself in its potentials now to make out of itself exactly what i want it to be god has never changed and just the same as he was then god is determined to do something nothing is going to stop him and he will do it that's why when god finished with his works he turned his back and rested because you know every single report of this kind stopping after the sky adam after every seed of this kind so god just rested and let the magic work and god acting on this drama come down and say adam like if god is he you got some he said adam where though i hide you gotta see where get away from how are you out of position then then humans start to take over well is the woman they give me you know it's not even me so he began to pass the buck and passable and god came kill a lamb bring this atonement that's very first thing come because death was required so god couldn't spare them he said the day you eat thereof that did you die and there was no gambling house there was no uh drinking house there was just adam eve his wife and a gardener eating and mansfield it had no rockstar and hollywood you know man fell in that environment so man can fall [Applause] anywhere oh oh i thought you wasn't born in sin and shaping integrity i thought it was me alone i thought all of us was born in sin and shape iniquity understand this if god don't hold you you fall let's let's talk [Applause] so don't play more righteous than anyone inside of here if god don't hold you you fall that's why david said i look unto the hills from whence come at my head my health comes from the lord hallelujah i like what isaac said this morning about the tapestry of david's life from a young man the king to the old man to die whole god make sure this life span from childhood go straight up a whole big circle of life and god call him a man after my own heart you may be seated oh praise the name of the lord so then god the power to transform and the devil bring up something to deform and the reform is to take us from his original state make something go wrong with it same seed but messed up same seed but tied up hallelujah we have virgin who's tied up and they deform sometimes they think they straight but they're twisted but there's coming of power and there's coming a prayer they're gonna have revelation 22 17 and the voice of that is not go the voice of that has not cut you off i have not agree with you that's not the voice of it the voice of it the spirit and the bride said come on you have your ticket to glory you about to board the plane you are saying goodbye world what you have time to do to be bitter with anybody or hateful towards anybody you are leaving here your ticket is guaranteed your visa is stamped you cannot be deported you came from [Applause] there did you get that you cannot be deported that is your home you're going back home abram was seeking a city whose maker and building is good [Applause] you may be caesar you should see me in my home there's no gray hair there you should see my house [Applause] you should see the street leading to my house my god i see the wandering oh you know i'm not talking about in trinidad that old house oh my god you should see the real one [Applause] i'm gonna be season do you understand that god's objective was to bring back the original man that was supposed to be standing in the garden of eden as if he never did fall that's why god introduced justification not just forgiveness but justification is you never did it we can't even figure that out but god could because only he as far as i know have a sea of forgetfulness everybody remember what you did but when god take your sins and drop it you remember and remember some of the things i've done but jesus with the special blood forgive me of everyone glory tonight under the blood of jesus you stand justified as if you never did it and you'll never get it because god said so oh give the lord a shout may be seated you see you need to get that because that will affect your confidence to approach your throne of grace with boldness you need to get that because that will affect you from going into the angel to say give me a little book because if you're not sure of your salvation of the redemption and predestination you wouldn't even think about going to the angel because you interpret that you're not worthy but the question wasn't if you're worthy jesus died for you to have access to the book satan don't have the password to go into the book access denied no you don't even have to type in a password you could just put your fingerprint he doesn't have your print no you don't even need a print we could just show your face lord jesus your son and the book opens to you the vision breaks what the lord is about to do hallelujah i told him back home you may be seated i said they go outside on the street level you see in this street that street that street if you fight at that level you would lose you only seen the street i said but if you go in a helicopter you would see beyond the streets you will see the village you go higher you see the city you go higher you see the state you go higher you see nigeria you go higher you start to see ghana you start to see the whole of africa because you're going higher and the higher goal you see a bigger vision and the vision when you come down to the street now it changes perspective because you see a broader picture you see the enemy coming down the road you know you coming along the streets so you're moving on that street or you're cutting more fear because god takes you up into a vision and when you come down from that vision you are invincible because you know the next move and that's what god did to abraham shall i hide from abraham what i'm about to do just think you are here and cause about to break a seventh on the revival it's about to break you'll be seated oh man you'll be seated so caught up in that helicopter gives you a bigger vision hallelujah inspired vision that's why brother brown was so caught up he's i see the bright cold i see she's sealed into the cave where he where is he talking from he's talking from up there he see you sealed he said oh god so close i could feel it my god sons of god going down the streets and praise god silvan gold having none he said god help me live to see it he said it's so close i could see it missing limbs being restored the prophet prophesy missing limbs that's why i'm excited because we have a lot to look forward to [Applause] there's a lot of negative lots of negative we could go into but we're not talking about that we're talking about bridal promises and the vision that had to be clear to you because when those guys got the vision from jesus they were clean and clear about what they were about that's why they're waking up a room and they waited in fear it's not that they were they were spoiled and no no they were fearful but they know what they're expecting power to take away that fear they were nervous but power control i take over all of that this power is promised i love it i love it i love it oh glory to god in the upper room was pastor and congregation a porcelain congregation bishop and congregation everybody was up in upper room your heart wants to hit the upper room because power is from the father oh do you believe that tonight oh glory to god hallelujah amen amen amen glory to god so before before the word can be manifested a seed has to be spoken let there be let there be let there be that's the word seed and then it's manifested is the real seed so god has to speak you first [Applause] so you are thought by pastors you often need a word god sent a prophet to connect you back with your word so when you hear the word preach you connect with it because the word is an expression of you the thought of what you are you are become a world expression so you have to connect with the word oh glory to god you can't help it it's part of your makeup it's part of your core it's part of the gene in your soul you can't help it i'm going to be a perfect man on the earth i'm going to be a perfect man because that is my seed [Music] [Applause] whatever i'm talking about ministers could be halfway god will make halfway preachers but creatures can be halfway reason they get their own weird messed up and interrupted programmer god for their lives but god don't make half preachers he makes full preachers he put something in tears to teach preachers to preach isn't that right but the thing about it we could get mixed up and messed up in our own human spirit and affect the program of god because god wants to be conductors of the spirit so we have to become the word isn't that right and once you become the word then you become a conductor that the spirit can flow through our gift is not messing up and doing a lot of things i'll give his hope to come out of the way if i come out of the way tonight who is speaking you say a brother have a gift the gift is how to come out of the way that the holy spirit could operate and speak through that gift where the teaching gives a prophetic gift whatever gift it is it's how they cut out of the way and once man move out god moves in you hear from god and you know you hear from god oh glory to god so sin john 14 12 is a seed the same works i do shall you do also saint john 15 7 is a seed if you abide in me in my words i bury you you can ask what you will sin mark 16 is a seed these signs shall follow them that believe not maybe not perhaps these signs shall follow them not you follow signs signs following you wherever you go the signs are right behind you you can't help it because this is the word you can't help it because this is true [Applause] so when god made man you may be ceased in his own image after his kind the bible says what is his kind the word [Applause] so the man that god made was word kind not interpretation kind word kind of thing you see man like to follow force interpretation because man make it that easy to believe because god is saying it's easy for it's easy for abraham to believe to go to hagar to have a child that they believe all wrinkles syrup go have it so that's why abram could move like that because when god shake abraham with vision of isaac he's seen the baby but when you look at syria he say oh lord abraham is true sarah so he got divorcer you have to treat that woman right whatever she is you want to cook something she don't want to put food on the table someday it doesn't matter that is still zero it's true that woman he will get that promise so abraham had to walk right talk right and make sure sarah don't leave him because god didn't talk to sarah poor sarah sarah only watching the mirror and say good lord but abraham believe god not sarah grey here not sarah wrinkle not sarah grumpy and the bible consider him a hero of faith father of faith and it's so accurate is he listening ibrahim at false ibrahim struggle but when when they start to write his testimonial the bible said he staggered not at the promise of god to unbelief sign god god signed that that sign already you can't question that testimonial but who signed it staggered not it's written staggered and tonight we have not staggered we stand on that rock if i perish i perish but i'm going in [Applause] this vision can't change [Applause] do it terry [Applause] i am not frustrated i am not tired i am not fed up faith has an anchor faith is a long-range vision faith don't back down i'm fate listen listen fit knows how to [Applause] wait [Applause] appreciated here a man of vision leave here a woman of vision leave here a pass our vision don't just go to the motion get a vision all the vision the people perish know the vision may be seated [Applause] [Music] right in your own country you see people with vision you go to one city and see so different from another city we've got this bishop for this governor who are not here ripping off the money and corrupt as ever roads are this way the city the country's this way there's the atmosphere that is there because the man have no vision he just in power but no vision no heart for the people the romans when they took over they brought the roads and transportation that's how goods and services start to get through all in europe all over also about plagues but that's how the rats and and and diseases was able to spread but every one of those kingdoms brought something to the plate daniel saw the unfolding of these kingdoms one by one but then daniel saw a stone cut out with all the hands of man the coming of that headstone and the brotherham said the pringle was never kept but it will be kept and you will be capped because brother branham slip a pyramid inside of you a pyramid inside of you and the capstone of love have to come upon you [Music] the love of god have to come upon you which is the bond of perfectness because we have to speak to the killable we have to talk bull language passing through this field he forgets his gun god alone if i get the gun he forget about the killer bull all of a sudden when you middle the field here comes killable nobody branham he said if he had the gun back sparks oh shoot it pay for it go home everything settled but he didn't have pax packs had no gun and watching the ball he said this is it and something came over here that's what we're talking about listen what ram didn't say killable look a quote look at coach look i've caught the mystery of the trumpets and the vials on the ball look at court listen the ball was going to put him and the coach [Applause] [Music] hallelujah we have to be able to talk the language and the language people understood was the language of love that is what adam had [Applause] [Music] that was the covering adam had that was the anointing along adam oh glory to god he had something over him he said bull i didn't mean to disturb you go back and lie down and the bull had to turn around pull back his brakes let out the snort and go and lie down that's what we're talking about that bull test is coming courts wouldn't defeat the bull preaching wouldn't defeat the ball but the levers that's the thunder that could just shake the devil oh it's going to thunder once more the world will hear direct from god oh hallelujah praise be to jesus oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah give the lord a shout you may be seated one time the prophet on the platform i know there's 300 ministers how much ministers behind his back a man of common custom beating the preachers coming into the congregation well the deacons once you see that fellow them thinking started to do it like you didn't see him digging him touching that man the man said you snake in the grass he's never spewing out words with that half spirit with it you snake in the grass and what the trying to throw around feet out abram stand up there short small man we just run off the platform they may make a barricade say let's protect this prophet this man of god know every man for their life those ministers say i ain't taking licks today they've run off the platform and leave it all to this prophet and the prophet stood up there intelligence jumped down he said because you have challenged the spirit of god you would fall over my feet notice notice here say follow me right say that again no no no no he said you will fall over his feet the man walking up there but i get paid nervous walking up there come straight to the platform and when he comes he said come out of him the man spin and fall right around here that is the gospel [Applause] that is son of god that is power that is demonstrating this gospel that is letting the devil know you can't send no imps you can't send no demon you can't just send anything like that no weapon form going to prosper all glory to god i will [Applause] so brother he demonstrated it and he prophesied that they're gonna have more of it do you believe that he said by and through the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised oh praise the name of the lord thank you lord so we need a transforming vision to carry out this vision of revelation 22 17. don't think for one moment we're going to jump over that scripture the spirit and the bride don't think for one moment there got to be people that will be affected by this bright ministry just as abraham had dwarfed a lot just as the spirit hunt after adam and the garden of eden god will give you a part of this redemption plan to collect the last seeds in your area around the world whatever god would send you to have a voice to speak the spirit and the pride say come you may be seated oh praise god hallelujah glory to god brother branham the seven angels message is to open the mystery of the seals calling the 11 hour gentile workers to receive the same pay that the first hours received simply so all this serious opening mystery has been revealed it's for purpose it's for pay for salad reading same thing if you don't know what pay is salary when you go to collect the money you offer for the month that's what we're talking about same pay not pentecostal salary we don't want a pentecostal's titan you're supposed to get 7000 a month and against 700. you holding on to 700 until you get like if you're doing doctor or something you have the internship i don't know if it's getting my stipend and whatnot but you can't get you're not a real doctor yet you have you're looking to be confirmed so when you get confirmed in the position you get a different salary so in the meantime you have something to keep you going we don't want you to drop out so we keep you with give god give you something to keep you going but the same pay is coming no you have to understand you need to get the same pay so you wouldn't short yourself no if if if you don't find yourself worthy of that pay you could still thanks for the blessing as good as that no you have to want cmp not more not more you're doing one more you want simply because peter cursed peter denied christ and peter get paid [Applause] [Music] [Applause] do you see what i'm saying peter said i don't know that man and at the day of when did you have pedicure fully come he got his full pace didn't say peter as your curse have paid and you're doing this quarter pay and this is no no same thing that pain was so powerful that when a nurse and the pharah came into the church and they think digest brother peter you know whatever we do deny christ three times and they're talking here you see i never deny him but you're a liar [Applause] and peter had his pay so the pillar of fire was on the throne in peter's heart and brother and i and sister sapphira come in the church thinking like jet brother peter oh i know him a long time ago they come lying peter say you're lying to the holy ghost and then pluck them out dead wife come and the wife knows she lives on this liar a long time she lives on any man she must know he's a liar she's blocking him she defending the lie too they packs you out too after that nobody is joining that church like that you know he got by saying and god added to the church no man joined themselves when the power of god started to manifest himself there are those who are going to fly out the church full speed they're not even looking back because there will be fire bombs there'll be missiles there'll be dynamites there'll be an explosion the fire got refined back and dear praise god you get your life in order or you get out oh the thing will be hot now do i hear a rumble in the house do i hear a shulk in the house or you're starting to get nervous already you could start to get nervous because it's coming this is part of division we're going to have another book of acts oh glory to god let me see if i could wrap up somewhere here now what abraham says the evil time message is to restore back again to bring back the same thing oh glory to god just a little more again praise god but i'm talking about the holy church united and this was made possible when god sent the seven seals and give us a sign by it and send seven angels down all the heaven and come to bring back the scattered word in their denominations and tie it back into the word again what's the purpose to bring down his holy spirit so the object of the seals being open picking up all this scattered word tying it back in the word to present this vision of faith back to the people is to bring back the holy ghost why would god send a prophet to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers that fear is to do what that faith is to pull down what that faith is to anoint what to say we have a church to say my church better than your church to say i have a bigger ministry than your ministry that's not what the faith is for the faith is to bring on the power what's the power for to transform your life because in the seed and you have a life and when that light in that seed in you meet the life of the spirit they're going to transform you into what you're supposed to be oh glory to god hallelujah glory to the god he said the church has brought the holy ghost for nearly two thousand years on the martyrdom it's been bombed not at the river euphrates but at the door of trees and dogmas you may be seated that the holy spirit can't work in the church here's why because of man-made systems but she is going to be liberated prophecy the church is going to be liberated oh glory the holy spirit has been bombed by these nominational rivers for two thousand years but is to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message the evil time message is you know what loose the holy ghost what are we supposed to be looking for the holy ghost what are we supposed to be expecting the holy ghost what is the holy ghost the rest what is the holy ghost the promised land [Applause] talking about solomon had a gift everybody rally around it he said wouldn't be wonderful thing if it happened amongst the people tonight if all america all the people that call himself christian would rally around god's gift in this last day the pouring out of the holy ghost upon the people that is god's gift in the last day is the holy spirit oh that's where we could rally around oh not doctrine not teachings but the holy spirit we need power thing but isaac read the quote national force but israel in the world comes a national force for the churches to work on the churches but the power of god will put the people in the bride we have labored we have strife we have sown seeds and so on but it was take take power but you got to see it and you got to want it you're going to want it with a passion you want to go to wonder with a crying your spirit oh glory to god like that elijah when he got the mantle so and he came down to the river and he recognized all this thing he's looking forward the mantle i get the man to know but nothing is there nothing is there i thought i was going to have something inside this i have it all the books all the tapes i have the mantle then all of a sudden he said where is the lord god of elijah and when he's crowd like that there's no intent to get him then he recognized that anointing wasn't in the mantle the anointing was in god you see the prophet taking mantle and strike the jordan river you take a mango and try the same thing is that the mantle gets his mantle he's very mental and hit it nothing happening it's not the man that mantle is just a symbol [Music] them guys i was walking down to jordan river those those those are levites and when the foot touched jordan jordan open up it's not the foot it's not the shoes they're wearing they're sandals you put on that same standard on your foot touch them just impersonation do you understand what i'm saying praise be to jesus jesus didn't have to do all of that he don't have to open up he just walked on the water he just walked on the water so whatever open up whether you want to walk on the water whatever you want to do you could do it this is what we are in the last days we're going to make a church that's going to make a brief we're going to make it we're going to make a church do you are you going to make it you're going to make a church that going to make a revival a real revival a holy ghost revival oh glory to god amen thank you lord jesus hallelujah hallelujah praise god so this and the church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection oh

fixing to fall you have hold that seat there long enough you're looking for the uncommon son you may be seated almost done oh glory to god you must have a revelation before your possession before you possess the land you must have a revelation of your land go to joshua all the places from here to dear to dear to dare to deal i have given it to you every place you put your foot that's yours merit is in the word day and night and the purpose of that is for joshua to be in tune with the mind of god because you don't know how to please god you can't please god outside of his word so you've got to be in the word to catch god taught about the matter oh give the lord a shout in the house oh glory to god hallelujah so when you're in the world you're in a channel to please god oh my god hallelujah praise god everybody struck her this morning you may be seated look at this guy saul saul tell samuel i've done the will of the lord he self-deceived he said he said i've done the will of the lord i've killed there's only a guy behind here even before you say hey i suppose that he had no animal i suppose he has silence all that's supposed to happen it is done but she bleeded bleeding what is who is it oh god wasn't pleased he thought he could halfway obey and still be blessed and god retrench him day and then he go back to the palace but he get retrenched he on his way home you may be seated so when man lost his inheritance devil grabbed it he thought but god had the book oh my and we had to wait till the kinsmen come to take that book back isn't that right i know every redemptive promise is lean in that book and somewhere at some point you have to approach god for that book what is yours what is your rights i hire your believers talk about it in that way yeah ministers preach it but somewhat believers activating their rights and say i have a right to this i'm a heir to the promise oh yeah this anointing is not just a preacher's hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah stand on the pulpit you may be seated oh my goodness when jesus died the veil in the temple was rent from top to bottom before that was a secret thing i preached within one say hey wait i have a clue we're going to say anybody outside be called clueless when jesus ripped the veil from the top to the bottom he exposed everything in other words it's no secret inside there no more you think you're not high

cherokees to block the tree of life in the garden of eden the prophet said god sent angels to drive you back god trying to push you i'll have a quote i wouldn't read it tonight but he said god want to help you more than you want help god can't wait to help you god want to help you more than you want help that's why you're supposed to be shouting tonight because the mercy of god is what brought this message to us from malachi 4. oh let me see if we can wrap up here now glory to god hallelujah glory to god amen [Applause] so what about unless another message and in that message have a promise of dynamics don't let nobody take that promise away from you we are looking for the spirit to come upon the bride we're looking for dynamics to come upon that word inside of you he used to bring back that fate and barbara says he said what we see oh i'll go skip that oh praise god oh my my my my my so this whole message this whole prophetic vision that the prophet brought was to really set us up to receive the intelligence of god the mind of god in this age of knowledge increase we cannot go uh just like he said anyhow just anyway hoping things going to work out that's not how god sends instructions jericho instruction was specific walk around once a day on the seven days seven times specific to take jericho god will be given specific instructions so the men of god gonna be anointed with the will of god to bring specific instructions that god will test your obedience because you have to be able to cope with the word you have to catch the vision and then cope with the word if that is what god said i have to cope with it don't twist it don't try to adjust it don't try to soften it don't try to water it down this is the word we have to cope with it you may be caesar listen god tell joshua every place you put your foot is yours no man shall be able to stand before thee all the days of their life when they started having victories victory after victory after victory when the report come back who we take here next how much we have today or 10 good 15 20 good one day they come up with some dead men just to say they know what god say you see he coping with the word he

out it was real it was war it was fight it was battle don't you think for one day it's gonna be easy it's not easy for the preacher oh glory to god it's not easy for the minister to be bringing all these promises and fighting all the devils in hell himself oh glory to you but that's what we got to do fight for you and fight for our own lives oh glory to us pray for the ministers pray that god
