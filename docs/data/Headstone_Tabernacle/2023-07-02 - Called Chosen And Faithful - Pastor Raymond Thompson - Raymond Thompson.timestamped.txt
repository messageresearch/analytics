[39:05] the challenge of the hour what Luther
[39:07] had and Wesley had on the early church
[39:09] Father's Heart can't work for this time
[39:11] you know we have to get the present-day
[39:13] Dynamic power to deal with the issues
[39:15] that we have to face and there are
[39:17] issues that you have to face because the
[39:19] bride will be oppressed people I
[39:21] remember when the bride is taking up the
[39:23] devil make war with the remnant of the
[39:25] woman's seed that the devil looking for
[39:27] twitch members so your job is to ensured
[39:29] that you're not to be a church member
[39:31] and you walk a church bench you want my
[39:33] chest man you want to be part of that
[39:35] bride but the Bible say his wife not the
[39:37] church member his wife Hotmail herself
[39:40] ready you have to see the need to be
[39:43] made ready and don't take for granted
[39:45] because it is the Lord I need a message
[39:47] everything will be all right that's not
[39:48] so two million people came out and all
[39:51] of them perish except Joshua and Caleb
[39:54] the same God that brought them all
[39:56] killed them God is the word God is not a
[39:59] Trinidadian God is not your feelings God
[40:01] is not your emotions God is what he said
[40:04] in his word if he said he will blessing
[40:06] God bless you and the devil's a liar
[40:08] every second gonna heal you he gonna
[40:09] heal you and the devil is still a liar
[40:12] what can the Lord some Praises there's
[40:14] gonna be a mighty Victory and a mighty
[40:17] reverence among God's people I believe
[40:19] that may it start this morning may it
[40:22] start right here with you oh glory to
[40:25] God Amen
[40:26] and it's so great you may be seated to
[40:28] have the right attitude a favor to get
[40:31] to get fever towards God when Jesus when
[40:34] the woman came and begging for a child
[40:36] who's next to the devil and and Jesus
[40:38] told her he's not supposed to take the
[40:39] Germans bread and custody the dogs it
[40:41] was a test a verbal would test a test of
[40:44] your attitude and reaction to words
[40:46] being parental at you and Jesus Through
[40:49] the words is that fit to take the
[40:51] Terrence back he didn't look at her
[40:53] his back was towards her maybe it's not
[40:55] fit to take the children's bed and cast
[40:57] it to dogs and the woman stood her
[40:58] ground she didn't go on Facebook and
[41:00] complain and call this one and complain
[41:01] and go like yeah yeah and La La Land and
[41:05] and complaining and and mumbling and
[41:07] grumbling she wasn't in grumbling mode
[41:09] this man who is he or he could talk to
[41:11] me so and she wasn't going down that
[41:13] road she stood up wrong she said even
[41:15] the dogs get crumbed some of the master
[41:17] table she stood out wrong because she
[41:20] had a need she stood out wrong because
[41:22] nobody else can help her she stood a
[41:24] girl because nobody cared or gave the
[41:27] Lord a shout but if you care Jesus care
[41:30] if you care God care don't ever say I
[41:32] don't care you'll be in real trouble
[41:34] saying that don't say that you better
[41:37] care
[41:39] [Music]
[41:41] maybe season and Jesus did not go to a
[41:43] house Jesus did not delay hands upon her
[41:45] he said for this sin
[41:47] so that I'm convinced you could say the
[41:49] right thing and I just as I could say
[41:51] the writing you could say the wrong
[41:52] thing too
[41:55] that's what we have been saying most of
[41:56] the times the wrong thing but you come

[42:02] thing

[55:34] the church shall say
[55:37] amen amen amen amen
[55:42] so if you have your Bibles we're still
[55:44] in the Book of Revelation so it's
[55:46] Revelations 12 12. Revelation 17 and
[55:51] Revelations 19.
[55:53] Isn't it nice to be in the Book of
[55:55] Revelation
[55:57] my
[55:58] I hope you brought your Bibles with I
[56:01] hear a few Bible today
[56:03] okay
[56:04] so uh
[56:11] [Music]
[56:16] if you have it Revelations chapter 12
[56:19] verse 12. therefore rejoice in Heavens
[56:24] and he that dwell in them
[56:26] woe to the inhabitants of the earth and
[56:29] of the sea for the Devil is come down
[56:34] unto you having great Wrath
[56:38] now listen we must listen to the
[56:41] scriptures because why is he so Roth
[56:44] because he knoweth that he has but a
[56:49] short time so there's a reason things
[56:52] are happening so speedily in the world
[56:55] if you can see what's happened he knows
[56:57] his time is short so he has to do
[56:59] whatever he can do and it's woe unto the
[57:02] inhabitants of the Earth
[57:04] but there's a people in the Earth
[57:06] that he cannot touch
[57:08] Hallelujah and then revelation 17.
[57:13] [Music]
[57:22] so it's always good to go back and read
[57:24] the whole chapter but we just sort of
[57:26] pulling out your 14 let's read from
[57:28] verse 13. he's having one mind and shall
[57:31] give their power and strength unto the
[57:33] Peace So speaking of all these Kings
[57:35] at that time gives its power to the
[57:38] peace this shall make war with a lamb
[57:42] and the lamb shall overcome them
[57:45] for he is Lord of lords
[57:48] and King of Kings
[57:50] and they that are with him now this is
[57:52] going to be my title
[57:54] so please you must listen to me today
[57:56] and these that are with him so yes they
[57:59] come into the final battle Yeah of human
[58:01] beings and he says but these that are
[58:03] with him
[58:04] are called
[58:06] chosen
[58:08] and faithful
[58:10] sure so there's a people that comes with
[58:14] him but they are called
[58:16] Chosen and faithful
[58:19] and then uh
[58:23] Revelations chapter 19.
[58:26] and let's read from sliven and I saw
[58:29] heaven open and behold a white horse and
[58:31] he that sat upon the upon him was called
[58:34] faithful true now this is the one
[58:38] that's we coming with but check what
[58:40] he's called faithful and true and in
[58:43] righteousness he does judge and make war
[58:46] his eyes were as a flame of fire
[58:49] on his head were many crowns
[58:52] and he had a name written he had no man
[58:56] knew but himself
[58:57] and he was clothed with a white Vista
[59:01] dipped in blood so you can see who it is
[59:04] kept in Blood and his name is called the
[59:08] word of God
[59:10] and the armies which were in heaven
[59:13] followed him upon white horses clothed
[59:16] in fine linen white and clean now what's
[59:20] use this it's the same people in
[59:22] Revelation 17.
[59:24] he says and out of his mouth go with a
[59:26] sharp sword and that worth it he should
[59:29] Smite the Nations and he shall rule them
[59:31] with a rod of iron and treated the wine
[59:34] press or the fierceness of the wrath of
[59:36] almighty God
[59:38] and he had in his and he had on his
[59:41] fisture my again
[59:43] and on his thigh a name written
[59:47] king of kings and Lord of lords may the
[59:52] Lord add a blessing to the reading of
[59:54] his word
[59:55] and you may be seated what a blessing
[59:57] just to read those scriptures
[1:00:03] so uh I I think today those scriptures
[1:00:06] we can read it and go home what a
[1:00:09] blessing it is really to see where we
[1:00:12] are and what time we did leveling now
[1:00:15] remember with the midnight service I
[1:00:17] preached on Satan's time is short he
[1:00:19] knows his time is short
[1:00:21] so I won't call this part 2 but I'm
[1:00:24] taking up from there so may the Lord
[1:00:26] bless you amen glad to see everyone and
[1:00:28] we trust the Lord is going to bless us
[1:00:30] so I just want to sort of pick up
[1:00:38] in the
[1:00:40] Satan knows this time is short here end
[1:00:42] time he says that the devil is in this
[1:00:46] last days are like a roaring lion going
[1:00:48] around whoever he can find to devour for
[1:00:51] he knows his time is short he hasn't got
[1:00:54] very much time longer now we eat this so
[1:00:57] I'm just recapping for those that
[1:00:59] weren't here uh
[1:01:01] we are not ignorant of Satan's devices
[1:01:04] so he's come down because he's Wrath so
[1:01:08] now whatever is going to Chuck on the
[1:01:10] human beings he's going to Chuck because
[1:01:12] he knows his time how many he can get he
[1:01:15] wants to get the Bible's even said hell
[1:01:18] is enlarged it's borders so that he can
[1:01:20] get more on his side the Bible we quoted
[1:01:24] the letter of Alice come out and demon
[1:01:26] powers are streaming out and that's why
[1:01:28] you can see brother this is one place
[1:01:30] Satan even feeds on the Flesh of his own
[1:01:33] people you can't believe people that
[1:01:35] serve him and yet look how they dine
[1:01:37] they they they're smoking all kinds of
[1:01:40] uh drugs uh what's this Orca pipe they
[1:01:44] they caught them by the thousands with
[1:01:46] liquor with murder with rape that's the
[1:01:49] enemy that's not God so we seek in whom
[1:01:52] we can devour
[1:01:53] but remember we read the scripture he
[1:01:56] goes around like a roaring lion but he's
[1:01:58] not a lion because it's only one lion
[1:02:01] and that's a lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:02:03] Hallelujah so he says here uh he's
[1:02:07] dumping all his evil on the people but
[1:02:09] brother says while he's doing that I
[1:02:12] believe that all the blessings of God
[1:02:14] will be poured out Hallelujah by the
[1:02:17] heavenly father upon the church in the
[1:02:19] last day so no matter what he does God
[1:02:22] is pouring out his Blessing
[1:02:24] so just recapping uh brother man says he
[1:02:27] even sent down extra troops that's why
[1:02:30] he took the Lord off
[1:02:32] so extra troops are coming but did you
[1:02:34] know when the Seven Angels Came extra
[1:02:37] troops came
[1:02:38] why to assist his pride
[1:02:43] knows this time is short
[1:02:47] Satan knows his time is short but the
[1:02:49] bride also knows her time is short
[1:02:52] amen and then we saw how one will say
[1:02:56] sir
[1:02:57] and you shall Chase your enemy he shall
[1:03:00] fall before you the sword and five of
[1:03:03] you shall chase a hundred come on
[1:03:06] uh a hundred and hundreds are put ten
[1:03:09] thousand to flight and your enemy shall
[1:03:12] flee before you
[1:03:13] now I want to start from here
[1:03:16] this is from 26 resurrection of Lazarus
[1:03:21] there's nothing in Army okay let me give
[1:03:23] my title first my title is called
[1:03:28] yes anointed
[1:03:30] I mean chosen and faithful
[1:03:33] so remember that called chosen faithful
[1:03:38] now there's no way you can come outside
[1:03:40] of those three things
[1:03:43] then my my subject is Satan knows his
[1:03:47] time is short my inspiration is is king
[1:03:50] of kings and his Lord of lords
[1:03:54] now that the lone brother puts me in
[1:03:57] Victory knowing that so he says yeah
[1:04:00] there's nothing can harm you there's no
[1:04:01] powers that people present in the future
[1:04:04] nothing can separate us from him we in
[1:04:07] him and he says we never come on our own
[1:04:10] will now you're gonna see why you called
[1:04:14] because you couldn't come on your own
[1:04:16] world something had to call you you're
[1:04:18] not even sitting here today something
[1:04:20] drew you here this morning
[1:04:23] amen he says he by choice elected us
[1:04:26] through
[1:04:27] brought us into him amen so it's his
[1:04:31] business yes to take care of what he
[1:04:35] took
[1:04:36] so you mean brother Raymond I'm not
[1:04:38] standing in my own power he took me so
[1:04:42] now he sees is is uh it's his business
[1:04:46] to take care of me because I didn't come
[1:04:49] of my own something threw me he pulled
[1:04:52] me now then it's his duty to take care
[1:04:55] of me so when I fall he must pick me up
[1:04:57] when I make a mistake and I confess it
[1:05:00] he must forgive me why because he called
[1:05:02] me he took me from The Dungeons of hell
[1:05:05] he took me from the puts of sin but he
[1:05:09] called me out today he left many of my
[1:05:12] friends but he pulled me now it's his
[1:05:15] duty to take care of me as I go in this
[1:05:18] journey so why are you called of God
[1:05:22] [Applause]
[1:05:25] mind so no man can put you from the
[1:05:28] father's ends because he's the greatest
[1:05:30] of all of them he says amen is the
[1:05:34] father who took care of it he's got to
[1:05:36] take more he says who's got more power
[1:05:39] than God so what is the power that you
[1:05:43] have got over you to take care of you so
[1:05:47] what power when he's stronger mine the
[1:05:51] whole powers that's created the universe
[1:05:53] he says amen that took the solar system
[1:05:56] and blew it
[1:05:57] like that like a star went out of place
[1:06:00] and then he watches over it
[1:06:03] and that's the kind father we serve so
[1:06:06] the same father that spoke the universe
[1:06:11] for billion
[1:06:14] billion brother still there for billions
[1:06:17] of years now he he says the same power
[1:06:21] that took you
[1:06:22] is the same power that spoke to that
[1:06:25] star how can you go lost brother how can
[1:06:29] God forget you when he took you from the
[1:06:32] mud of the world and place you where you
[1:06:35] are today
[1:06:36] we serve a mighty God
[1:06:39] oh I like the sun we are not a
[1:06:42] denomination I he says don't let nobody
[1:06:44] tell you any kind of move in the world
[1:06:47] can ever interfere with God's he's
[1:06:51] moving right on it was planned back
[1:06:54] there in the beginning there ain't a
[1:06:57] devil enough or enough Devils can
[1:07:01] interfere with God's program
[1:07:03] no you want to see there's enough Devils
[1:07:06] you must say you might say but he calls
[1:07:08] me to do that and he calls me you know
[1:07:10] God knew that
[1:07:12] oh my come on no man
[1:07:15] this comes fresh you know God created
[1:07:18] his own enemy in Eden
[1:07:22] he didn't know about the serpent he
[1:07:24] didn't know what no he created his own
[1:07:27] enemy to deceive Eve because in him was
[1:07:31] attributes to be a savior
[1:07:34] to be a deliverer so he allowed it to
[1:07:38] prove to the devil you're not gonna keep
[1:07:41] my child up I'm Gonna Make A Way right
[1:07:44] in Eden
[1:07:46] now you mean he didn't know the end when
[1:07:49] you're gonna make mistakes and you're
[1:07:51] gonna fall and you're gonna do things
[1:07:53] but don't worry he comes right back
[1:07:57] redeems you
[1:07:59] cleans you make a way for you and
[1:08:03] nothing can separate you from the love
[1:08:05] of God that is in Christ Jesus come on
[1:08:09] Brothers come on sisters man shake off
[1:08:12] that demon powers shake off that fear
[1:08:15] you can't go lost
[1:08:18] foreign
[1:08:19] [Applause]
[1:08:22] [Music]
[1:08:27] so there's not enough Devils can
[1:08:29] interfere with God's program
[1:08:32] so God's program is still in effect it
[1:08:36] doesn't look like it when you look at
[1:08:37] the world you saw the earthquake now in
[1:08:40] uh turkey and uh what's it sabibi or
[1:08:43] whatever Syria and you see there's
[1:08:46] almost what 3000 people killed one time
[1:08:48] yes
[1:08:50] interviewed some journalists they said
[1:08:52] what's the distance of the earthquake it
[1:08:54] says from Johannesburg to Cape Town
[1:08:56] everything was so flat that's the
[1:08:59] distance
[1:09:00] one mother gave birth in the umbilical
[1:09:03] Court was still on the baby they they
[1:09:04] could say the baby mother was gone
[1:09:07] so you uh someone formed me last night
[1:09:09] and said pastor you preach this God is
[1:09:12] going to interrupt somebody's program
[1:09:14] we're not always going to be like that
[1:09:16] twice Satan has come down with great
[1:09:19] Wrath and in the end at this time is
[1:09:22] fulfilling Matthew 24.
[1:09:25] as I say when they ask him about the end
[1:09:27] he says there'll be earthquakes in
[1:09:29] diverse places not only one place all
[1:09:33] over who would have thought that turkey
[1:09:35] would ever earthquake
[1:09:37] the worst thing I think a thousand years
[1:09:40] or 100 years
[1:09:41] but you see signs of the end time now
[1:09:44] when we hear that we we I mean we feel
[1:09:47] sorry for the people
[1:09:48] but at the same time for the bride Jesus
[1:09:51] told him when this happened look up your
[1:09:54] Redemption draweth nigh
[1:09:56] [Music]
[1:09:56] [Applause]
[1:09:57] [Music]
[1:10:00] so he says here okay
[1:10:03] I'm reading art to preacher 7. now oh it
[1:10:06] says here mark of the beast now oh when
[1:10:09] I read this sometimes my heart leaps
[1:10:12] what's a prophet
[1:10:14] he says my heart leaps for Joy all right
[1:10:17] when I think of how that we live in here
[1:10:20] in the last days
[1:10:23] he says my heart lives for joy
[1:10:25] and then the ten horns which thou souls
[1:10:28] are Ten Kings remember I said which
[1:10:30] received no Kingdom as yet but received
[1:10:34] power as kings one hour with a beast
[1:10:39] these have one mind and shall give their
[1:10:42] power and strength to the Beast well we
[1:10:44] know the Beast is wrong
[1:10:47] watch
[1:10:48] then
[1:10:50] so
[1:10:51] we shall make war with a lamb
[1:10:56] and the lamb shall overcome them
[1:10:59] so please in this meeting you must be
[1:11:01] sure you're on the right side
[1:11:06] they shall make war with a lamb
[1:11:08] and the lamb overcome them
[1:11:11] oh
[1:11:13] I hope you run into the right side
[1:11:15] because who overcame them
[1:11:19] there comes
[1:11:26] maybe for the millennium
[1:11:27] [Music]
[1:11:29] sure
[1:11:31] for he is Lord of lords and King of
[1:11:35] Kings then it's in Brackets don't be
[1:11:37] Shook Up
[1:11:38] so what you see don't be shook up
[1:11:41] because he overcame them and he that
[1:11:44] overcame them is king of kings and Lord
[1:11:47] of lords so in other words this man was
[1:11:50] in battle already he already overcame
[1:11:53] and now he's coming to the final battle
[1:11:55] and he still overcomes why he's king of
[1:11:59] kings and his Lord of lords
[1:12:04] [Applause]

[1:12:09] to see the scriptures then you realize
[1:12:11] the god you serve is just not a makeup
[1:12:14] God he's not an idol statue there this
[1:12:17] man is real brother he overcame for you
[1:12:20] that's why he said on calvary's finish
[1:12:23] they overcame for you but now he must
[1:12:26] come to claim you
[1:12:28] because we're still in a battle of Flesh
[1:12:30] and we still have fights here and fights
[1:12:33] there but it's already over
[1:12:36] no one lose you don't lose
[1:12:39] [Applause]
[1:12:43] [Music]
[1:12:45] he says uh there comes the battle of
[1:12:48] Armageddon ready for the Millennium for
[1:12:51] his Lord of lords and King of Kings he
[1:12:53] says don't be Shook Up
[1:12:54] and they that are with him
[1:12:57] now what's the scripture
[1:12:59] they that are with him are called The
[1:13:02] Chosen now somehow I hope someone is
[1:13:05] going to catch it because maybe the end
[1:13:07] I'll ask you a question did you catch us
[1:13:09] he says they are called chosen
[1:13:12] uh not you yes

[1:18:19] elders she was so sick and I told them
[1:18:22] she want to give her heart to the Lord
[1:18:23] she want to be baptized so I said
[1:18:25] brother this lady is so sick we can't
[1:18:27] baptize in the pool or anything
[1:18:29] baptized in the bath then they went back
[1:18:33] it's about two weeks yes
[1:18:35] three Visa they went back later in the
[1:18:38] sinner's prayer she was in the home
[1:18:40] there then they made the path full of
[1:18:42] water and what did they do
[1:18:45] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:18:49] two weeks after that she passed away

[1:19:54] Hebrews chapter 4.
[1:19:56] people who follow the pillow of fire
[1:19:59] will certainly have a rough time
[1:20:03] so you see we can't look for easy times
[1:20:07] because they gonna persecute the
[1:20:09] Christians the true ones now there's a
[1:20:12] lot of Christians denominational
[1:20:13] Christians you name it

[1:20:22] fall for this
[1:20:23] and what we saw yesterday it blew our
[1:20:26] minds I just told everyone I just
[1:20:28] appreciate the message

[1:21:39] followed him because they are called The
[1:21:42] Chosen
[1:21:44] yes sir and the faithful
[1:21:47] the elected of God now why does the
[1:21:50] bible emphasize this they that are with
[1:21:53] him
[1:21:54] so he's given an expression here the
[1:21:57] Christ don't come along because now he
[1:21:58] came to fetch him now I hope you can be
[1:22:01] able to answer it he came to fetch them
[1:22:04] but now when he comes this time for the
[1:22:05] final battle there's some people with
[1:22:08] him
[1:22:10] and they also ride in white horses
[1:22:13] clothed in white Raymond
[1:22:17] and the Bible says they some are pointed
[1:22:20] them out he wanted the John wanted the
[1:22:22] people to know who's this people
[1:22:26] then he says yeah in why we not to
[1:22:28] denomination they have one mind and
[1:22:30] shall give their power and strength unto
[1:22:31] the peace that's those five Kings and
[1:22:34] this shall make war with a lamb but the
[1:22:36] lamb shall overcome them Glory brother
[1:22:38] premises for the Lord he is Lord of
[1:22:41] lords and king of kings and then he goes
[1:22:44] again and they that are with him are
[1:22:47] called chosen faithful Hey Brother
[1:22:52] this excites me
[1:22:55] my God hallelujah they are called Chosen

[1:23:44] today and it raises your feet to a
[1:23:46] bracket where when the enemy won't trip

[1:28:37] [Music]
[1:28:39] he says here questions and answers
[1:28:41] Genesis he ordained us called us
[1:28:50] and then he quotes Ephesians 1 now that
[1:28:52] you all know that's my favorite
[1:28:53] scripture Paul an apostle of Jesus
[1:28:56] Christ by the will of God to Saints
[1:28:58] which are in Ephesus
[1:29:02] Jesus Christ now here it is notice
[1:29:06] according as he has chosen us
[1:29:09] yeah there's so much scriptures sister
[1:29:12] girl there's so much scripture according
[1:29:14] his he has chosen us in
[1:29:18] so when you were chosen you were chosen
[1:29:20] in him and Christ found no uh God found
[1:29:23] no fault with that body
[1:29:25] so when he chose you you were perfect
[1:29:28] so why you shook up man I made a mistake
[1:29:31] here I fell then this day you were
[1:29:34] perfect when God chose you you were
[1:29:36] perfect
[1:29:37] and he knew the mistakes you're gonna
[1:29:39] make but he already made provision for
[1:29:42] that Hallelujah
[1:29:46] that's why young people if you make a
[1:29:48] mistake or anyone don't stay away come

[1:30:17] come here God can deliver you and take
[1:30:19] it away from you man
[1:30:24] [Applause]
[1:30:28] so he chosen Us in him before the
[1:30:31] foundation of the world
[1:30:32] that's pretty good isn't it
[1:30:36] he's saying no that's not pretty good
[1:30:38] that's real good
[1:30:40] okay is that real good man this is real
[1:30:44] good quotes real good because the
[1:30:46] prophet went into the mind of God and
[1:30:48] pulled it down
[1:30:49] so he said it's real good before there
[1:30:51] was a foundation in the war wall poor
[1:30:55] speaking to the Church of Ephesus said
[1:30:56] he has chosen Us in him now we all the
[1:31:00] members of the body of Christ is that
[1:31:01] right and God before the world was ever
[1:31:04] formed chose you
[1:31:06] and I in before the world was ever
[1:31:09] formed he says fuel my isn't that
[1:31:12] wonderful
[1:31:14] isn't that good but isn't it real good
[1:31:18] hey I got a new one man isn't that real
[1:31:21] good
[1:31:22] then he goes to Romans 8 moreover whom
[1:31:25] he did
[1:31:26] pre knighted then he called
[1:31:28] and whom he called then he also
[1:31:31] Justified and whom he justified them he
[1:31:35] already
[1:31:36] glorified
[1:31:39] What does justify mean like you never
[1:31:43] did it in the first place that's the God
[1:31:47] we serve now they may point you to your
[1:31:49] sin but God forgave you years ago plungy
[1:31:53] beneath the flood as if you never did it
[1:32:00] [Music]
[1:32:01] Hallelujah
[1:32:04] my already glorified so in your presence
[1:32:08] God you sitting here you already
[1:32:10] glorified
[1:32:14] tell me I know it's about hot and so
[1:32:17] forth but stick with me here's something
[1:32:18] at the end is something and I hope
[1:32:21] you're gonna get it
[1:32:23] he says you're the believer's position
[1:32:24] in Christ to them that are in Christ's
[1:32:27] faithful call chosen in Christ that's
[1:32:29] who pulls the dress in the letter two
[1:32:32] aren't you happy today you're in Christ
[1:32:37] isn't that real good
[1:32:40] or already chosen in Christ that's what
[1:32:43] Paul said so he wasn't addressing it to
[1:32:45] the world he was threatening to the
[1:32:47] vision church that was called
[1:32:49] and we are representation
[1:32:52] okay
[1:32:54] wow
[1:32:56] it's Luke I'm finishing earlier they
[1:32:58] don't expect it
[1:33:00] maybe I'll go by inspiration
[1:33:04] you love the word
[1:33:08] and just in your mind and I told you New
[1:33:11] Year's Day tonight when every trial
[1:33:12] comes upon you say Satan I know you your
[1:33:15] time is short
[1:33:17] you're trying to pull me away from this
[1:33:19] and pull me away your time is short
[1:33:21] and sometimes that battle becomes so
[1:33:24] vicious it almost looks like you're
[1:33:26] losing your mind but tell him you're a
[1:33:28] liar
[1:33:29] it is written you shall have the mind of
[1:33:33] Christ tell him Satan is written the
[1:33:36] word is already in us as it was in Mary
[1:33:39] tell him it is written Hallelujah now we
[1:33:43] are the sons of God tell him brother
[1:33:46] because he's so vicious in his attack
[1:33:48] he's gonna attack marriages he's gonna
[1:33:50] attack churches he's going to attack
[1:33:52] homes he's gonna attack your personal
[1:33:54] life he's going to attack you as a
[1:33:56] Christian make you lukewarm
[1:33:58] [Music]
[1:33:59] and that's one of the most dangerous
[1:34:01] things because you come to church you
[1:34:03] sing the image you go back you do your
[1:34:05] same thing
[1:34:06] but you must come to that place where he
[1:34:08] says amen enough is enough
[1:34:11] oh I feel like a boxer now enough is
[1:34:15] enough I took enough blows but it's time
[1:34:17] for me to hit back
[1:34:19] how do I hit back with the word of God
[1:34:22] and I know my position
[1:34:25] now he says here
[1:34:27] okay now they are joining themselves
[1:34:31] together coming to The Showdown to
[1:34:33] Armageddon riding watch on a mixed
[1:34:37] colored horse
[1:34:38] and
[1:34:40] one horse was white one horse was red
[1:34:42] one horse was black so the three colors
[1:34:46] was mixed yes and he come out with a
[1:34:48] pale uh
[1:34:50] political power horse
[1:34:54] political power spiritual power
[1:34:56] controlled by demons watch demon powers
[1:35:00] which is the Antichrist
[1:35:02] so this idea that we're speaking of the
[1:35:04] pale horse rider now young people you
[1:35:07] must know this because it's good to know
[1:35:09] that your school and your curriculum
[1:35:12] whatever you call it that's all good but
[1:35:14] you need to also know why we had a cloud
[1:35:17] why was there a Prophet you need to know
[1:35:20] why because he came to reveal to us this
[1:35:22] and we must also be ready to prepare
[1:35:25] ourselves we can't go with our friends
[1:35:27] and we blink bling and beat this time
[1:35:29] there and that time come to church is
[1:35:31] the only time I'm religious you must go
[1:35:33] back and read read the scriptures that I
[1:35:35] read and see where does it fit in and
[1:35:38] what does it do to your life we need
[1:35:40] that
[1:35:41] so he says here it's it's mixed it's a
[1:35:45] political power what spiritual power
[1:35:47] control Power spiritual he says
[1:35:50] controlled by demon power
[1:35:53] Yo which is the Antichrist mixing that
[1:35:57] all together and you got a Pale Horse
[1:36:01] now look how he came to that color
[1:36:04] sickly looking thing is riding on and
[1:36:07] look what he's riding on this pale
[1:36:10] looking Crystal colored horse mixed with
[1:36:14] black red and white come into the battle
[1:36:17] now watch here now now you have to catch
[1:36:20] please you're awake all of you
[1:36:22] okay he says here
[1:36:25] Gathering these subjects from every
[1:36:28] nation under heaven

[1:36:33] seen the streak of iron run into every
[1:36:37] Kingdom of Rome yes they are come
[1:36:39] Gathering so the ten toes of Daniel's
[1:36:42] statue was mixed with iron and Clay
[1:36:43] that's the Ten Kings that ran into all
[1:36:46] the nations
[1:36:47] and they mixed with clay and iron clean
[1:36:50] iron doesn't mix but these are the Kings

[1:36:59] heaven so that mean the EarthBound
[1:37:03] so that means they on the earth these
[1:37:06] subjects

[1:37:09] bringing his subjects from the four
[1:37:11] corners of the Earth
[1:37:13] riding a pale sickly colored mixed horse

[1:37:22] different powers in the different Church

[1:37:27] now in Revelation 19 oh I hope you're
[1:37:31] ready please man I'm so excited about it

[1:55:40] and that's what we want we want to see
[1:55:43] how young people fill with the Holy
[1:55:45] ghosts our own people fold we want to

[1:56:18] and God will do in one year what the
[1:56:22] Theo theologists failed to do
[1:56:25] the anointing of the church when it
[1:56:28] really strikes home to that fateful
[1:56:31] little remnant
[1:56:33] my after the doors of the Gentiles is
[1:56:35] close oh God will anoint the church then
[1:56:38] he that is filthy let him be filthy
[1:56:40] still you see what happened when the

[1:57:02] playing doing what they do and they'll
[1:57:04] tell you it's so nice you mustn't you're
[1:57:07] not losing nothing
[1:57:09] I always say the world is garbage and
[1:57:13] the devil puts cream on top of it and
[1:57:16] the people see the cream and they think
[1:57:18] they're having a good time but you know
[1:57:20] when they eat in that cream they're
[1:57:21] eating garbage that's killing them so
[1:57:26] don't go after the your friends don't
[1:57:28] it's not good you think it's good
[1:57:32] it's not
[1:57:36] [Music]
[1:57:36] [Applause]
[1:57:38] [Music]
[1:57:39] [Applause]
[1:57:42] so don't try to dress like them you must
[1:57:45] be different like a Christian
[1:57:47] and when you still walk together they
[1:57:49] must say but hey this one is a Christian
[1:57:50] how do they know just by your dress you
[1:57:53] see your actions speak louder than your
[1:57:55] words
[1:57:57] amen
[1:57:58] he says let him that's righteous occur
[1:58:00] then it's always says here and will
[1:58:02] anoint the church the power of God and
[1:58:04] things will be taken place not only then
[1:58:06] but is doing it now
[1:58:08] okay wow we did well
[1:58:12] uh
[1:58:14] is the lights going off I don't know
[1:58:19] oh yeah
[1:58:25] okay I keep looking in I think I have so
[1:58:27] much time
[1:58:29] okay he says yeah that message says the
[1:58:32] digital watches uh
[1:58:35] not working
[1:58:37] now watch Satan
[1:58:40] once uh possessor because of the fall of
[1:58:44] the garden
[1:58:45] is bound and cast into the Lake of Fire
[1:58:48] his days are finished that's why I said
[1:58:50] like Goliath there was a timeline on me
[1:58:53] he should have stayed the 40th Day he
[1:58:55] shouldn't have come in the camp
[1:58:57] but you see God uses them to take Glory
[1:59:00] so if he didn't come out the 40th Day
[1:59:02] why did David come the 40th today God
[1:59:05] wanted to take glory and so he I'm still
[1:59:08] with Israel sure
[1:59:11] even Pharaoh should not have run after
[1:59:13] them he said go leave them but you see
[1:59:15] God said I'm going to take Glory out of
[1:59:17] favor
[1:59:18] sure
[1:59:19] what does he do then he disposes of his
[1:59:22] contestant Satan he throws him in the
[1:59:25] Lake of Fire
[1:59:26] with all those who was inspired by Satan
[1:59:30] to reject the word of redemption so it's
[1:59:34] not only him but it's them that decided
[1:59:37] with him
[1:59:38] and many that rejected the word of
[1:59:40] redemption they all get cars the Bible
[1:59:43] says they cast into the Lake of Fire
[1:59:47] Satan with these angels
[1:59:49] gets cast into the Lake of Fire
[1:59:52] I wonder if the pain must come forward I
[1:59:54] think this is my last one
[1:59:57] yeah
[1:59:58] wow I hope you enjoyed the message can
[2:00:01] we give the Lord a hand a praise
[2:00:05] my
[2:00:06] [Applause]
[2:00:11] I got some powerful stuff but I'm sure
[2:00:13] we can pick it up some other time
[2:00:16] so you are chosen
[2:00:21] I mean you are called Chosen and elected
[2:00:24] now if you read the Scripture it says
[2:00:26] cold chosen
[2:00:28] any and faithful
[2:00:32] speaks he only speaks of Chosen and
[2:00:35] faithful I don't know if you notice
[2:00:37] now I'm coming to you with a and see how
[2:00:39] many quoted
[2:00:41] but you that's why I say the scripture
[2:00:43] is a compound meaning you can't come if
[2:00:45] you are
[2:00:49] so you can't come
[2:00:51] you have to come only because you are
[2:00:54] called
[2:00:55] so even Revelation says that
[2:00:58] when you read it here it says here
[2:01:06] 12.
[2:01:09] so I want to see this
[2:01:12] oh yes
[2:01:16] just get my eyes
[2:01:18] [Music]
[2:01:35] yes it is
[2:01:37] this shall make war with the lamb and
[2:01:40] the lamb shall overcome them for his
[2:01:42] Lord of lords and king of kings and they
[2:01:45] that are with him
[2:01:46] are called
[2:01:48] so he says call comma and chosen comma
[2:01:53] and faithful
[2:01:56] but if you see the quotes we read it
[2:01:57] almost just speaks of
[2:01:59] Chosen and faithful
[2:02:02] but Brahman says all scripture is a
[2:02:03] compound meaning so number one you must
[2:02:05] be called
[2:02:07] so we can't rule out calling
[2:02:10] right so I have to come
[2:02:13] then I said something came to me said
[2:02:15] but brother Raymond what if they
[2:02:17] challenge you and say many are called
[2:02:21] but few are chosen
[2:02:23] don't worry you're still in the chosen
[2:02:26] group
[2:02:29] [Applause]
[2:02:34] still in the chosen group
[2:02:37] you say brother remember I might not be
[2:02:38] cold that's right and I go back to David
[2:02:41] he wasn't qualified but he was chosen
[2:02:45] the woman in the well wasn't qualified
[2:02:47] but she was chosen
[2:02:50] Hallelujah Peter who denied the Lord
[2:02:53] wasn't hey come on man he wasn't
[2:02:56] Justified he wasn't even in the plane
[2:03:00] almost but the difference was he was
[2:03:03] chosen so people were pointing the
[2:03:05] finger at the woman at the well point
[2:03:07] the finger at the Peter point the finger
[2:03:10] at the David because uh the prophet was
[2:03:14] saying but the law to me as a king and
[2:03:17] he brought all the big guys he says it's
[2:03:19] not one of them is he said don't you
[2:03:21] have another one he knew he's there he
[2:03:24] said yes but he's a Shepherd boy he's
[2:03:26] not qualified bring him bring him bring
[2:03:29] him bring him bring him bring him hey
[2:03:32] and when the prophet saw him brother he
[2:03:34] took that horn of oil and knowing that
[2:03:37] young boy he wasn't qualified
[2:03:42] but he was chosen I hope you see
[2:03:45] election now coming in brother I know
[2:03:47] I'm not qualified I made so many
[2:03:49] mistakes I did the most evil in the
[2:03:51] world but Lord why did you choose me so
[2:03:55] until you chose me
[2:03:58] oh glory be to God chosen to fulfill his
[2:04:02] word the other thing you Faithful
[2:04:06] and this I wanna drive down
[2:04:09] consistency brings faithfulness
[2:04:13] do not consistent some people can't come
[2:04:15] to church you see them this week you
[2:04:18] don't see them next week you've got to
[2:04:19] be consistent and I'm gonna give you a
[2:04:22] scripture the man in the pool went for
[2:04:25] 38 years
[2:04:27] consistent brother he went and you know
[2:04:30] what when Christ came there was
[2:04:32] thousands brother misses about 6 000
[2:04:35] people that was worship than what he was
[2:04:38] but where did he go to
[2:04:40] he went to that man that was consistent
[2:04:47] oh
[2:04:48] we got to be consistent in prayer
[2:04:51] consistent in worship consistent in
[2:04:54] serving God on our job on our school or
[2:04:59] wherever we are in our neighborhood
[2:05:00] we've got to be consistent you can't
[2:05:03] witness to your school friends and then
[2:05:05] afterwards you do something that's not
[2:05:07] right they're gonna tell you but you
[2:05:09] said you're a Christian
[2:05:12] so let's be faithful
[2:05:14] in our calling
[2:05:17] chosen to fulfill the word of God now if
[2:05:21] you look at the world and compare how
[2:05:23] little the bride is
[2:05:25] you then you'll be shocked to see the
[2:05:28] minute
[2:05:29] but God is going to defeat this world
[2:05:31] with that little bride that scattered
[2:05:34] right across the world

[2:05:55] where was these people
[2:06:01] and from heaven
[2:06:03] where were they
[2:06:05] that means they went in the Rapture
[2:06:08] before this battle
[2:06:12] and I said this is beautiful man it's
[2:06:15] something that slipped and hid in there
[2:06:16] so sister Ross said they already made it
[2:06:19] they already was called here
[2:06:22] and they were chosen and they were
[2:06:25] faithful
[2:06:26] now Faithful is a big word I wanted to
[2:06:28] break every word down but I knew it will
[2:06:30] take time but you know what chosen me
[2:06:32] and when before the foundation of the
[2:06:35] world I mean called then chosen when
[2:06:37] also before the foundation war and to
[2:06:40] fulfill the world faithful to your
[2:06:42] calling

[2:40:42] amen another note of Praise greeting
[2:40:45] Saints in the powerful name of Jesus
[2:40:47] Christ I would like to give God praise
[2:40:49] for making a way on last Tuesday I
[2:40:51] encountered a young man in his family
[2:40:52] struggling to open their car he somehow
[2:40:55] had locked the key that he used to open
[2:40:57] the car on the inside of the car and the
[2:41:00] only key he seemed to have was the one
[2:41:01] that locks the car so I kept trying
[2:41:03] everything possible to open the car I
[2:41:05] didn't ask him for the key used to lock
[2:41:07] the car to try to open it so he tried to
[2:41:09] take the thing that's supposed to lock
[2:41:11] it to open it
[2:41:12] and I got tired after a while and felt
[2:41:15] like giving up but I decided to pray and
[2:41:17] try once more as I was praying I heard a
[2:41:20] click and the door opened
[2:41:27] um a man next to me told me I'm a real
[2:41:30] boss but I told him it's not me it's
[2:41:33] Jesus praising Jesus for making away
[2:41:36] brother Sabu
[2:41:39] I love that brother and that's that's
[2:41:41] tremendous

[2:47:16] together with brother Ovid
[2:47:18] um they worked very hard on the non-span
[2:47:21] video for the convention so if the
[2:47:24] technical team can take us to that we'd
[2:47:27] appreciate it
[2:47:28] key in the inspiration of the convention
[2:47:38] Parable unto them to this
[2:47:40] position or always to pray and not to
[2:47:43] faint saying
[2:47:45] there wasn't a city a judge which feared
[2:47:47] not God neither regard
[2:47:49] [Music]
[2:47:51] Ed that City she came unto him saying
[2:47:53] avenge me of mine adversary and he would
[2:47:56] not for a while but after what he said
[2:47:58] within himself though I fear not God nor
[2:48:01] regard man yet because this Widow
[2:48:05] troubleth me I will avenge her lest by
[2:48:08] her continual coming she weary me
[2:48:11] and the Lord said hear what the unjust
[2:48:14] judge said
[2:48:16] [Music]
[2:48:20] and shall not God avenge his only lect
[2:48:23] which cried day and night unto him
[2:48:25] though he bear along with them
[2:48:28] I tell you that he will avenge them
[2:48:29] speedily
[2:48:31] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[2:48:33] shall he find faith on the earth
[2:48:36] Jesus never questioned
[2:48:39] when he came back would he find
[2:48:42] respects he never questioned whether he
[2:48:45] had find Saints he never questioned
[2:48:48] whether he had found righteousness
[2:48:51] but what Jesus questioned whether he had
[2:48:54] fined or not is what I'm trying to
[2:48:56] uphold will I find faith when I'm coming
[2:48:59] beloved when I gave all diligence to
[2:49:01] right unto you of the common salvation
[2:49:03] it is needful for me to write unto you
[2:49:06] and exhort you that you should earnestly
[2:49:08] contend for the faith which was once
[2:49:09] delivered unto the Saints what is faith
[2:49:14] faith is something that's revealed to
[2:49:16] you
[2:49:17] that is not yet but you believe it will
[2:49:20] be
[2:49:20] [Music]
[2:49:21] faith is the revelation of the will of
[2:49:24] God
[2:49:26] now the only way that we're going to
[2:49:28] ever know what if we can only find out
[2:49:31] what these days is then we can earnestly
[2:49:36] contend for that faith is that right
[2:49:38] what the face now that the sea faith
[2:49:42] that was once delivered to the Saints
[2:49:44] now if we'll go back to where they were
[2:49:47] first call Saints and find out what kind
[2:49:50] of a face they had then we'll know or
[2:49:54] more or less
[2:49:55] uh what they can get what to contend for
[2:49:58] he was talking about when the first
[2:50:00] church would set an order was
[2:50:02] inaugurated on the day of Pentecost
[2:50:05] and now we'll notice what kind of faith
[2:50:08] that they had they had a faith in a
