[22:55] be here we are not dry red of Christians
[22:59] email so Romans 12:1 re 2 vs. was 1 & 2
[23:06] it's familiar scripture thing but Isaac
[23:08] read out on Sunday I beseech you
[23:11] therefore brethren by the mercies of God
[23:13] that you present your bodies a living
[23:17] sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which
[23:21] is your reasonable service and be not
[23:26] conformed to this world but be
[23:29] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[23:32] that you may prove what is that good and
[23:37] acceptable and perfect will of God
[23:39] that's pretty father we thank you for
[23:40] your word now we read it blessed that
[23:43] any man could read it well it takes you

[23:50] your light on your word today and become
[23:52] alive in Jesus name we ask it amen and
[23:55] amen god bless you may be seated
[23:57] have a title the renewing of your mind
[24:01] that's a title tonight the renewing of
[24:04] your mind I was so blessed on Sunday I
[24:09] don't have words to describe how I felt
[24:14] about Sunday service there was such a
[24:16] tremendous blessing to me and now and
[24:18] something the Holy Spirit was speaking
[24:20] about thinking and but Isaac I
[24:25] afterwards I was telling myself no that
[24:27] wasn't on your notes that no he didn't
[24:29] write that that just come my pure
[24:31] inspiration he was the kept for me was
[24:33] very talking about Joshua and Caleb and
[24:35] he had a ten spice is the same line same
[24:39] groups
[24:40] same God same amount and they had no
[24:44] interaction with the Giants so therefore
[24:47] it wasn't as if they were intimidated by
[24:49] the Giants is a matter of what they told
[24:51] themselves so they told themselves we
[24:55] not able to take it they told themselves
[24:59] that the Giants to greet the tall them's
[25:02] of jazz until suppose the Giants was
[25:05] walking with heart failure a bad hat
[25:09] suppose they was behind one by one group
[25:13] they interviewed Giants is saying well
[25:15] you have had condition you're bigger
[25:17] Eddie you know how long you will last
[25:19] doctor and the Giants in well I quit I
[25:21] couldn't just no you know the instructor
[25:23] the chance all they tell themselves we
[25:26] cannot take it and what they thought
[25:30] affect the people what they preach
[25:34] affect the people what they thought
[25:38] affect the people because when Joshua
[25:45] new killer came back to the camp there
[25:47] was a better mountain that was there a
[25:49] depressive anointing that was there and
[25:52] it was over the whole people because
[25:55] they bought a report now I bring
[25:58] industry sharing the power of words and
[26:00] the power of influence over lines and
[26:04] Vava - hallelujah so if a negative word
[26:09] that came from a negative thought could
[26:13] producers and oppressive atmosphere
[26:15] what would a positive world that come
[26:19] from the intelligence what kind of
[26:22] atmosphere is that supposed to produce
[26:25] then that could produce some affect and
[26:28] influence upon your life that will do
[26:31] make you do great things for the kingdom
[26:35] because that's the most important thing
[26:37] if you're big you can see it you will
[26:39] come out of your selfishness and you
[26:41] will see the kingdom of God is at hand
[26:45] what are you doing about God's kingdom
[26:47] because what I want purposed to promote
[26:50] his kingdom not do you miss Kingdom he's
[26:54] blessing you for the kingdom
[26:56] he's adding to you for the kingdom
[26:59] doing here amen tonight he is making a
[27:03] way for you that you could be used for
[27:05] the kingdom or glory of God hallelujah

[27:12] king is coming
[27:14] Oh blow a king must have a domain he
[27:19] must have a Dominion you yet about the
[27:21] Saudi or whatnot and they talk about the
[27:23] Prince of Sunday I know buddy kingdom

[27:52] and latter in in the first at the same
[27:54] time for marine and latter rain we have
[27:57] been under teaching green and hardly
[28:00] people looking for the latter mean some
[28:01] people feel they have it already because

[28:04] them and Irena what that but that is not
[28:06] what the Prophet taught us he pauses the
[28:09] Lateran is coming our promise is coming
[28:12] I mean it's so boring but it's still the
[28:15] truth they come like Abraham after ten
[28:19] years

[28:21] in borås but that was coming it's just
[28:24] 15 more years later after 20 years you
[28:27] see Isaac preaching he say measure the
[28:28] people said repeatedly same thing over
[28:29] and over
[28:30] it's like boil an egg frying egg
[28:32] poach an egg assuming the same charity
[28:35] same dynamics simply because feel on a
[28:38] half of the Chinese ticket how I wanna
[28:40] flip it is the same promise is dynamics
[28:43] is Lateran it's all work in a bridge

[37:36] ideas he gonna read that but if he was
[37:38] suing Jesus Christ he will read that

[38:13] Scripture and anoint him any stretch any
[38:23] vests I'm talking to anointed because we
[38:26] are the anointed to anoint it we have to
[38:29] say to unlock the prophecy call him and
[38:35] you may be seasoned John the Baptist
[38:38] voice of one carnival at least nobody
[38:40] got knowing that all the time a man
[38:43] wrapped up in seven organic or he's done
[38:45] about this with the message I know I
[38:47] just knowing I just think I feel like my
[38:50] script yes I feel it as playing last
[38:52] night and I read a scripture I feel like
[38:53] me
[38:54] that's an impersonation when John Gotti
[38:59] had no intent in cell metabolism because
[39:02] you are the composite wilderness the
[39:04] amount in seven that they are packed
[39:05] because when you see people and you're
[39:08] compromised and your human spirit upon
[39:09] what you're getting connect with
[39:11] emotions you can already behave all you
[39:13] want to behave go out the five emotions
[39:15] go to cut that off and all the
[39:18] conscience and affection
[39:19] yes because they just turn free would
[39:21] why you think gonna send a trainer so
[39:23] hot and heavy to make sure it bring out
[39:25] that you have a yes whether you love God
[39:28] or your family when you put your husband
[39:30] for sources
[39:32] if what gods say a husband disagree with
[39:34] it you have to forget what he said is
[39:35] that every man would be a lion my would
[39:38] be true friend or no friend friend or no
[39:43] friend let Christ live in me O Lord is
[39:46] my friend who want to go grab a Oh glory
[39:50] to God what shall separate me from the
[39:52] love of God that's in Christ Jesus where
[39:55] they are money or not that doesn't
[39:57] change who you are
[39:58] as we said job had what he had because
[40:01] of who he is but who he was god bless
[40:06] him
[40:07] god no Borden bless him and because he
[40:09] blessing the Lord God bless me what the
[40:14] trip everything would you say himself
[40:16] yeah because when you get a lot of stuff
[40:19] sometime I get over they will try okay
[40:21] overtake me because it lessens too much
[40:23] no yank here you get insensitive pride
[40:26] puffed up and then what this particular
[40:29] and off on you're moving through life on
[40:33] your own and join your own life until

[1:13:45] praise God
[1:13:46] so you know what happened the mind was
[1:13:48] chosen at the battleground
[1:13:49] the police were selected to fight
[1:13:52] because that is where the decisions are
[1:13:54] made in the mind so that is where God
[1:13:57] put it for you to get fight who would
[1:13:59] win the choice of what you accept and
[1:14:02] what you reject isn't that right the
[1:14:04] human mind was chosen for the place of
[1:14:06] the battle I cannot fight in my mind I
[1:14:09] see groans you don't understand what
[1:14:12] going on but that is the Conqueror
[1:14:14] chosen you suppose the girl fight every
[1:14:16] day that will be fighting fighting like
[1:14:20] a mushroom is just like some teddy bear
[1:14:26] yesterday we've in some ways the been
[1:14:28] yourself life it just is so why you know
[1:14:40] fighting you not press in you'll
[1:14:42] overcome in because overcoming keeps
[1:14:44] life in you
[1:14:44] oh my unity who does unity jumps
[1:14:48] yes any obstacles you catch a crime and
[1:14:50] I catch a active
[1:14:51] [Music]
[1:14:53] Oh glory to God amen Humana was chosen
[1:14:59] for the peace of the battle because
[1:15:00] we're that way it was begin
[1:15:03] that is because decisions are made from
[1:15:04] the mind the head they never started
[1:15:07] from some organization praise God and
[1:15:09] there was a woman who was sick and a
[1:15:11] pallet dear in about a rampage a message
[1:15:14] the great battle before and I keep
[1:15:15] preaching and looking at her we should
[1:15:16] not look another bite I'm finished she
[1:15:18] wore hot chic overcome rainy day on the
[1:15:21] ground no you could see what you want
[1:15:23] you seen on your seat you had that nut
[1:15:25] but in you because he only grown and she
[1:15:28] want to walk she want to come on her
[1:15:30] condition and when he finished she was
[1:15:32] free man
[1:15:33] just get up and walk off did not even
[1:15:36] pray for her she overcome right there
[1:15:38] and you could overcome right in your
[1:15:40] seat Oh glory to God nothing changes the
[1:15:44] decision you decide to save God Almighty
[1:15:47] not because of your husband not because
[1:15:49] they are children not because their
[1:15:50] mother father whatever it is but because
[1:15:52] of him he called you equality for a
[1:15:54] purpose and that purpose is about
[1:15:55] everything else all glory to God amen
[1:15:59] we are body soul and spirit the outside
[1:16:01] the body the shell inside the conscience
[1:16:03] of art and then it's the soul soul the
[1:16:05] spirit and spirit governs the other you
[1:16:07] can accept doubt or you can accept feet
[1:16:09] either one you want to work on
[1:16:11] therefore season began at the principal
[1:16:13] part that caused the spirit of man to
[1:16:15] dalgo it's worth it that's what Seton
[1:16:18] did and God begin at the principal part
[1:16:21] the lay his would in that spirit so she
[1:16:24] a time job is a contest ready to bring
[1:16:26] down so first he asked Eve what did God
[1:16:28] say what are you going so become God not
[1:16:30] talking to me and she simply saying God
[1:16:33] say we should eat to the tree but I
[1:16:34] shall not sure I wish I shall not eat
[1:16:37] because a day we eat we shall die then
[1:16:40] says you shall not surely time God knows
[1:16:42] you know when you eat that tree you
[1:16:43] shall be you know both sides which was
[1:16:50] information and knowledge and moving
[1:16:53] either way from feet because all she
[1:16:55] knows to do was believer God said as
[1:16:57] usual test it and God's originally dying
[1:16:59] so talks focused Teddy story walking I'm
[1:17:03] not accepting a different test
[1:17:04] concerning what was said if God said it
[1:17:07] I may not understand it but I believe it
[1:17:09] and as long as coming out of perfect
[1:17:11] smoke I believe it because my prophet
[1:17:13] doesn't speak his own thoughts save a
[1:17:15] property speak it it has to come to pass
[1:17:17] I don't need a full explanation of it if
[1:17:20] I got the revelation that's fine but if
[1:17:22] I still wanna start it I believe it and
[1:17:25] what he was supposed to say if this
[1:17:27] church right now can be put together
[1:17:29] knitted together with such that everyone
[1:17:32] would be in one Accord not one shuttle
[1:17:35] or anywhere there would not be a feeble
[1:17:37] please enormous in another five minutes
[1:17:40] there would not be nobody a desiring the
[1:17:42] Holy Ghost but what we receive it if we
[1:17:45] could get a certain thing fixed now
[1:17:47] there is where the battle begins right
[1:17:49] in your own mind it's not christian
[1:17:52] science mind over matter the main
[1:17:53] accepts the life which is the word of
[1:17:56] god and dear brings the life just your
[1:17:59] thought doesn't do it but the word of
[1:18:01] god brought into the channel of your
[1:18:03] thought so when the would spit down to
[1:18:05] the channel you thought my life freedom
[1:18:09] your mind accepted it grasp it what is
[1:18:13] your mind controlled by your spirit and

[1:27:07] up the channels watch from the middle of
[1:27:10] the heart which is the soul it goes what
[1:27:11] feed in the devii channel the trouble of
[1:27:14] it is we're standing in there with a lot
[1:27:15] of doubt trying to act supported out
[1:27:17] there you've gotta stop that come down
[1:27:20] that channel with the children of God
[1:27:22] and then it goes on automatically it's
[1:27:26] only inside it's the inside that counts
[1:27:29] you said I thought the Bible says out of
[1:27:30] the abundance of the heart the mouth
[1:27:32] speaks

[1:27:39] the right words so instead of
[1:27:41] accelerating forces on Coral you will
[1:27:43] cool it down because there is no virtue
[1:27:45] in
[1:27:46] putting an accelerant to quarrel and
[1:27:48] fasten your label crime of passion
[1:27:55] somebody gets so angry they do something
[1:27:57] under necessary and jvd rested life
[1:27:59] because of a wrong attitude and decision
[1:28:02] and think in an atmosphere
[1:28:03] what is up wasn't thinking through is it
[1:28:06] worth it
[1:28:06] of course not it wanted are in a story
[1:28:10] about a woman Jeff some dominating bore
[1:28:12] some boss always talking about not
[1:28:14] really a boss but a co-worker a terrible
[1:28:16] experience and she just couldn't get
[1:28:18] away it was a horrid Spencer I know she
[1:28:20] said she changed her thinking and asked
[1:28:22] herself what could I learn from this
[1:28:24] person so she didn't try to change him
[1:28:27] she changed herself and it comes
[1:28:31] tolerable she was able to overcome
[1:28:34] because she changed her thinking on the
[1:28:39] matter the Cyprus and the boat storm
[1:28:42] coming
[1:28:42] they sing this song and sing a special
[1:28:44] and cut the hands and so on but he
[1:28:46] didn't have fear the doctor was gone
[1:28:47] Jesus was in the boat he's tired he's
[1:28:51] sleeping and snoring he is out cold when
[1:28:53] he had enough to say go with Jesus Jesus
[1:28:56] wake up from sleep but I know in every
[1:28:59] cup holders be here sail a big one think
[1:29:02] I would have prayer exercise them to a
[1:29:04] faith and was he just weaker sleepy I
[1:29:08] peace be still and tell that storm roll
[1:29:12] up full of Eastern be stoned asleep he
[1:29:18] put away the storm and when I can sleep
[1:29:20] and say oh ye of little faith if you
[1:29:22] have faith you could do this you could
[1:29:24] do that you could do the other don't you
[1:29:26] want to have faith to do this do that to
[1:29:28] the other this is faith is a living
[1:29:30] faith now these are faith that is lies
[1:29:32] all glory to God amen so you have to
[1:29:37] close the channel
[1:29:40] when God gets a man in his hands till
[1:29:44] you can get these senses the conscience
[1:29:46] and everything in doubt until it stands
[1:29:48] with God behind it in the spirit there's
[1:29:51] not a very little work and Puka dog in
[1:29:53] there when court could get a man not
[1:29:56] even your conscience even going out the
[1:29:58] flue is so clear it shows Alleluia the
[1:30:00] open blows are wasted glory to God it
[1:30:02] shines out just clean and clear it's the
[1:30:04] fourth quarter the main is the gate to
[1:30:06] the soul the gate of the Spirit rather
[1:30:08] your mind opens up and accept the Spirit
[1:30:11] or reject the spirit you can have these
[1:30:14] conferences and little feelings and
[1:30:15] sensations all these things that has not
[1:30:17] to do with it that's just sensation but
[1:30:19] when it comes to reality your mind opens
[1:30:21] it up your mind either accept it or
[1:30:23] reject it easier God may not miss it
[1:30:26] it's your mind that open up the door or
[1:30:30] closes the door and listen to your
[1:30:33] conscience listens to your memory
[1:30:35] listens to your affection but when your
[1:30:37] mind closes itself to these things and
[1:30:39] let God the spirit of God the word come
[1:30:43] in it blows the rest of the stuff out
[1:30:45] every doctor's gone every fear is gone
[1:30:48] every sensation is doctors gone every
[1:30:50] feeling is gone nothing standard about
[1:30:52] the Word of God and see that kind of
[1:30:54] buckle against that when somebody
[1:30:56] completely blew know there is a woman a
[1:30:59] physical and there's a woman for this
[1:31:01] spirit did you believe there's a
[1:31:04] spiritual womb and there's a physical
[1:31:05] womb the mind is the womb to the spirit
[1:31:10] Oh glory to God how adultery is
[1:31:14] committed spiritually when you knowing
[1:31:18] better by the Word of God by the
[1:31:20] intercourse of your mind take a lie of
[1:31:22] the devil
[1:31:23] and again and that's what brands say
[1:31:25] when Eve receive the devil line and
[1:31:27] major changed immediately it was instant
[1:31:32] when Adam forsake the word he lost the
[1:31:36] earth immediately because court no
[1:31:38] longer control of him he had no control
[1:31:40] of the earth as long as God was in
[1:31:43] control of Adam because control the
[1:31:44] earth once he lost the control he lost
[1:31:46] the book lost the authority lost the
[1:31:49] many
[1:31:49] when the restoration of the book come
[1:31:52] the restoration of the control of God
[1:31:53] over your life that's why he said the
[1:31:56] bride will have the mind of Christ the
[1:31:58] intelligence that means the control come
[1:32:00] back over which is the headship that
[1:32:03] governed the body so when the headship
[1:32:05] comes to govern the body then God have
[1:32:07] control over you then you will have
[1:32:09] dominion over others and other things
[1:32:11] about Oh glory to God hallelujah praise
[1:32:14] be to Jesus so we are shown with the
[1:32:17] word someday it will bring the life into
[1:32:20] the earth it will replenish the earth
[1:32:21] where he failed Mary did she took the
[1:32:24] word if top sitting like Mary took God's
[1:32:26] word unto Mary seed repeat again to his
[1:32:30] bride true the word will bring up the
[1:32:32] Millennium therefore on the same thesis
[1:32:34] she could take God's Word and said God
[1:32:36] said not to do it get away from here not
[1:32:39] what I mean alright but instead she
[1:32:40] tried to hide it with seat in line Mary
[1:32:43] didn't do that she said be done unto me
[1:32:44] I wanted I would oh my hallelujah
[1:32:48] watch I'm almost done they're talking
[1:32:50] about the latter rain not the scattered
[1:32:52] you laughter in between that's not
[1:32:53] nothing
[1:32:53] if the Lateran would have been here the
[1:32:55] poor glow destructing she would have
[1:32:57] struck the world then loitering is fixin
[1:33:00] to come and I say tonight the latter
[1:33:03] rain is fixin to come Oh glory to God we
[1:33:06] have got to do something to make
[1:33:07] ourselves in it keep your hands off of
[1:33:09] it let God do it take his word believe
[1:33:13] it wallet in your heart and when the
[1:33:14] real biggest of all life will take a
[1:33:16] whole and the word will manifest itself
[1:33:19] normally factor in hallelujah no
[1:33:23] manufacturing just speak in the word and
[1:33:26] I was listen to our tape we were I'm
[1:33:27] talking about he preached the wood and
[1:33:28] people just was healed just like the
[1:33:30] boot being preached this is what I look
[1:33:32] in the scene not even hands me he look
[1:33:34] at not even hands laid not hands laid
[1:33:36] just the word going for
[1:33:41] hallelujah the promise was not only made
[1:33:44] to Abraham and his seed not his seed
[1:33:46] Isaac it field it proved it did but the
[1:33:48] seed the faith that he had here we go no
[1:33:51] matter what the circumstances was how
[1:33:53] against nature it was how much the
[1:33:54] doctor said it was and so Abraham had
[1:33:56] the promise given to him when it was
[1:33:58] impossible
[1:33:59] oh praise God and if the church is
[1:34:01] soared with something else beside the
[1:34:03] word it can't go to meet him he hasn't
[1:34:05] got a free body with fungus on it
[1:34:07] he's got a perfect body he's the perfect
[1:34:10] word and the church will be showed and
[1:34:12] believed in the perfect word and the
[1:34:15] perfect word and the perfect world will
[1:34:16] unite together one flesh one body
[1:34:19] husband and wife I am NOT even in myself
[1:34:21] I believe it that you know the former
[1:34:24] rain man thought there we go the faith
[1:34:26] the rain is fixin to fall what is going
[1:34:30] to bring for you watch the same Sun that
[1:34:32] rises in the West is when horizon with
[1:34:34] watch the Sun is should know in the
[1:34:36] Western Hemisphere - what there we go to
[1:34:39] ripen the seed that has been planted to
[1:34:43] bring forth a bride if you do not have
[1:34:45] those seeds to pay something if you do
[1:34:49] not have those seeds if you're here
[1:34:51] tonight and you're not a Christian maybe
[1:34:53] you belong to church don't you take that
[1:34:55] chance brother don't you listen to those
[1:34:57] things that's a hybrid of fear the Word
[1:34:59] of God has got to live a new supremely
[1:35:01] like I did in Jesus Christ for he is the
[1:35:04] head is but it can't be one thing I said
[1:35:06] another you have to get the seed so when
[1:35:09] we talk about the same P this 11th hour

[1:35:16] got the word because the word is the
[1:35:18] spirit that work I received the word you

[1:35:27] Diaz people came from other groups and
[1:35:29] so on and they were so ignorant of this
[1:35:31] message I was so ashamed the whole kind
[1:35:33] of foolishness economy man ideas that
[1:35:35] was teaching a man preaching to them and
[1:35:37] when I kind of share stuff they didn't
[1:35:39] know what the message said listen
[1:35:42] but around which the entire nation from
[1:35:44] just the revelation but there are
[1:35:46] certain greater promises that you must
[1:35:48] receive and this is what we're trying to
[1:35:50] get the finda seeds to show because that
[1:35:53] is what we're going to anoint when the
[1:35:56] spread began to move into looking for
