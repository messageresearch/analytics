[40:57] local church in ghana and it's your
[41:00] privilege to know you and to be with you
[41:02] together connected this time in this way
[41:06] praise the lord so i want to greet all
[41:07] the ministers that have gathered around
[41:10] this inspiration for these meetings may
[41:12] god bless you
[41:14] i believe he did already and he will
[41:16] continue to bless you and a special
[41:18] greeting to the body of christ around
[41:21] the world amen the body of christ a
[41:24] chosen body hallelujah and you are a
[41:27] part of that body hallelujah and he has
[41:29] called you he has predestinated you to
[41:32] be the body of christ to make up the
[41:34] headstone he has called you for that
[41:36] purpose so just for a short
[41:38] encouragement hallelujah this morning
[41:40] this will encourage me we're going to
[41:42] find out hallelujah that the body of
[41:44] christ is identified in the parables of
[41:47] the five virgins hallelujah the body of
[41:49] christ will be identified hallelujah
[41:52] praise the lord so by god's grace and
[41:54] election we are one of them amen he has
[41:57] chosen us to be one of the wise virgins
[42:00] he has chosen you not to be a foolish
[42:03] virgin but to be part of the wise virgin
[42:05] so in matthew 24 taken from the
[42:07] inspiration
[42:09] the jesus compares the kingdom of god to
[42:12] the 10 virgins which took their lambs
[42:14] and went forced to meet a cry bridegroom
[42:17] and five of them were wise and five were
[42:19] ruled foolish and they that were foolish
[42:23] took their lambs and took no oil with
[42:25] them and verse matthew 25 verse 4 but
[42:29] the wise took oil in their vessel with
[42:32] the lambs and so we find out amen
[42:35] there's a difference between the vice
[42:37] version and the foolish version the
[42:39] foolish virgin they had a lamb by the
[42:41] wise virgin they not only had the lamb
[42:44] but they had a vessel with them and the
[42:46] vessel was filled with oil hallelujah
[42:49] praise the lord so it made a difference
[42:51] between the five wise virgin and the
[42:53] five foolish version amen so the oil
[42:56] praise the lord brother branham says he
[42:59] says the oil is the holy spirit
[43:01] amen that's the oil and the oil needs a
[43:04] specific kind of vessel where it ca a
[43:08] vessel that has the ability to hold that
[43:11] oil amen and that vessel hallelujah will
[43:14] be connected to the lamb
[43:16] amen the foolish virgin didn't had a
[43:19] connection they didn't had a vessel
[43:21] praise the lord by the wise virgin they
[43:23] had a vessel with them and it was
[43:25] connected to the lamb to give a light to
[43:28] their lamb hallelujah and to fool what
[43:31] jesus says in matthew 5 14 ye are the
[43:34] light of the world amen and when you are
[43:37] the light of the world it takes a vessel
[43:39] for that it takes a holy spirit for that
[43:42] to be the light of the world hallelujah
[43:44] and the light is coming from an extra
[43:46] vessel the light is coming forth from a
[43:49] living being from a new life and it's
[43:51] connected to your life amen praise the
[43:54] lord and the message answers questions
[43:56] and answers on hebrews chapter 2.
[43:59] brother branham makes a difference and i
[44:01] want to just bring it out and maybe a
[44:03] blessing to you
[44:05] amen paragraph 363 he says but just
[44:08] trying to make it just a briefly claim
[44:11] as i know how to make it he says when
[44:13] you believe on the lord jesus christ
[44:16] then you have the new birth
[44:18] when you believe on the lord you receive
[44:21] a new thought a new life but it isn't
[44:24] the baptism of the holy ghost you got a
[44:27] new birth when you believe you've got
[44:29] eternal life
[44:30] he that hears my word and believes on
[44:33] him that has sent me has everlasting
[44:36] life he has everlasting life that's the
[44:39] new birth you're converted it means you
[44:42] are turned around so brother branham is
[44:44] starting to make a difference between
[44:45] the new births and to the baptism of the
[44:48] holy spirit hallelujah and he says you
[44:51] have eternal life amen and the ten
[44:53] virgins they had a new birth hallelujah
[44:56] they were turned around they were
[44:58] justified as brother branham said he
[45:00] says they were sanctified but still
[45:02] something was missing
[45:04] and the in matthew we read that's what
[45:06] what's missing was an extra vessel an
[45:09] extra vessel filled with the oil
[45:11] hallelujah praise the lord and brother
[45:13] branham continues and he says but the
[45:15] baptism of the holy spirit puts you into
[45:18] the body of christ and subject to the
[45:21] gifts for service praise the lord so the
[45:24] baptism of the holy ghost hallelujah it
[45:26] puts you in the body of christ amen and
[45:29] the body of christ is a vessel the body
[45:32] of christ is a vessel that is filled
[45:34] with the holy spirit where christ is
[45:36] living in that vessel hallelujah and the
[45:38] baptism of the holy ghost is connecting
[45:41] us to this vessel
[45:43] praise the lord praise the lord in the
[45:46] message face once delivered to the
[45:48] saints brother branham says he says the
[45:50] body of christ is a new creature
[45:54] it's a new creature and it's a new
[45:56] creature a new being it's a living being
[45:59] in your life it's a living new being in
[46:02] your soul hallelujah that's what the
[46:05] body of christ is it turns out to be a
[46:07] new bottle in your life amen for the new
[46:10] wine it's an extra vessel the body of
[46:13] christ amen and the wise virgin they
[46:17] have the extra vessel
[46:19] within them the vessel it contains oil
[46:23] amen as brother branhammy said he says
[46:25] one feeling
[46:27] refillings
[46:29] first of all
[46:31] it puts you
[46:33] in the body of christ
[46:35] and then he fills you
[46:37] and he fills you more and he fills you
[46:39] up in a message patmos vision
[46:42] and it has struck me brother branham he
[46:45] says how thrilling it is to think of
[46:47] those seven lamps drawing life and light
[46:50] from the resources of the main bowel
[46:53] because they had their wicks
[46:55] dipped in it
[46:56] hallelujah each church
[46:59] each church's messenger is the pious
[47:02] depicted here his life is on fire with
[47:05] the holy ghost
[47:07] his wick has been immersed in christ
[47:11] through that week he is drawing the very
[47:14] life of christ and by it it gives the
[47:17] outlie to the church he says and not
[47:20] only can we speak thus of the messenger
[47:22] he says but every true believer is
[47:25] dramatically depicted described here he
[47:28] says they are all drawing from the same
[47:31] source and every true believer every
[47:33] vice virgin is taking their
[47:36] their weakened into this vessel and
[47:38] they're starting to pulling from this
[47:40] vessel they're starting to pulling the
[47:42] life of christ hallelujah they have been
[47:45] dipped in the same boat and the
[47:47] messengers did they are dead to
[47:49] themselves and their lives are hit with
[47:51] christ in god praise the lord now
[47:53] brother branham he brings it down and he
[47:56] says the whisper life
[47:58] what is the visible life
[48:00] it's your outside it's your appearing
[48:03] it's the way you act it's the way people
[48:06] will see you it's the way you you you
[48:08] have your reaction your life it's a
[48:10] visible life and there's an invisible
[48:12] life and brother branham says he says
[48:14] the visible life is burning and is
[48:18] shining and is giving light and
[48:20] manifestations of the holy ghost
[48:22] hallelujah the wise virgin they could
[48:25] manifest the holy ghost the wise virgin
[48:28] they could give out light the wise
[48:30] virgin could show a manifestation of the
[48:33] holy ghost hallelujah let me tell you
[48:36] you're gonna show a manifestation of the
[48:38] holy ghost it will not be in word but he
[48:41] said it's gonna be in spirit and in word
[48:44] hallelujah praise the lord and it's it's
[48:46] visible life and brother branham
[48:48] continues he says but the inner
[48:50] invisible life is hidden in god and fed
[48:54] by the lord's word there's your there's
[48:56] your vessel there's your vessel a true
[48:59] believer a true pride the wise virgin
[49:03] they have an extra vessel hallelujah
[49:05] their weakest into the life of christ
[49:07] and they're pulling from it and they're
[49:10] giving out
[49:11] manifestations of the holy spirit on the
[49:14] outside hallelujah their vessel
[49:17] is connected
[49:19] to the lamb
[49:20] and it's seen
[49:22] in the message the beginning and ending
[49:24] of gentile dispensation
[49:27] brother branham he said what is it the
[49:30] mystery of god
[49:32] what is the mystery of god he says god
[49:35] in you
[49:36] the hope of glory its shining force the
[49:41] baptism of the holy spirit that's the
[49:44] wise virgin it's shining force what you
[49:47] have received on the inside so the
[49:50] baptism of the holy ghost identifies the
[49:53] vessel identifies the body of christ in
[49:56] the believer
[49:57] praise the lord
[49:59] praise the lord so let me encourage you
[50:02] amen to coming to a closure to make it
[50:05] short

[1:01:04] their moment may this be their
[1:01:06] opportunity to respond to the call of
[1:01:09] behold a bridegroom comet father may you
[1:01:12] take complete control in the precious
[1:01:14] theme of jesus christ and the church
[1:01:16] says
[1:01:17] amen and amen
[1:01:19] i'd like to read my scripture before i
[1:01:22] go into the greetings so it's a familiar
[1:01:25] scripture for this convention
[1:01:27] but uh i want to stay there so see
[1:01:30] matthew 25
[1:01:32] just one portion of scripture thank you
[1:01:34] musicians thank you brother anthony
[1:01:36] in matthew 25 and reading from verse one
[1:01:44] then shall the kingdom of heaven be
[1:01:47] likened
[1:01:49] unto ten virgins
[1:01:53] so it's an example it's a likening it's
[1:01:55] a comparison
[1:01:57] which took their lamps and went forth to
[1:01:59] meet the bridegroom
[1:02:02] so in that first verse there's no
[1:02:04] separation of who makes up that ten is
[1:02:07] just ten virgins
[1:02:10] it is only in verse two we begin to
[1:02:12] separate wise from foolish
[1:02:14] and i want us to not see it as five wise
[1:02:17] on one side and five foolish on the
[1:02:19] other side it was just ten they mixed up
[1:02:24] five of them were wise and five were
[1:02:26] foolish they that were foolish took
[1:02:28] their lamps
[1:02:30] so they did something right they took
[1:02:31] their lambs
[1:02:33] and took no oil with them
[1:02:36] but the wise took oil in their vessels
[1:02:38] with
[1:02:39] their lamps
[1:02:41] while the bridegroom tarried they all
[1:02:43] slumbered and slept
[1:02:46] and at midnight there was a crime made
[1:02:49] behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out
[1:02:51] to meet him
[1:02:52] then all those virgins arose all i want
[1:02:56] you to watch that word all
[1:02:57] then all those virgins arose and trimmed
[1:03:01] their lamps
[1:03:03] all
[1:03:04] and the foolish said unto the wise give
[1:03:06] us of your oil for our lamps
[1:03:09] are going out but the wise answered
[1:03:11] saying not so lest there be not enough
[1:03:13] for us and you but go e rather to them
[1:03:16] that sell and buy for yourselves

[1:10:14] because we have a destination
[1:10:16] hallelujah god didn't call us from the
[1:10:18] world to put us in church
[1:10:20] god didn't call us from the world to put
[1:10:21] us in the message
[1:10:23] god didn't call us to just be good
[1:10:24] church believers and to just be
[1:10:27] believers know that is just a part of
[1:10:29] the process to the destination oh
[1:10:31] hallelujah jesus didn't come to break
[1:10:34] five loaves and two fishes and that was
[1:10:36] part of the journey he had a destination
[1:10:38] can the church say amen it was good for
[1:10:41] him to walk on the water but that was on
[1:10:43] the journey that was not the destination
[1:10:45] it was good for jesus to visit the grave
[1:10:48] of lazarus that was on the journey that
[1:10:50] was the that was on the journey he still
[1:10:52] had a destination so don't mix up your
[1:10:56] journey with your destination
[1:10:58] don't mix up what the lord is taking you
[1:11:01] through to where you're going to end up
[1:11:03] because your destination is based on
[1:11:05] pre-destiny oh come on now somebody help
[1:11:08] me this morning somebody help me this
[1:11:10] evening your destination is based on
[1:11:13] predestination
[1:11:18] jesus was predestinated that's why
[1:11:20] nothing could stop him when they came he
[1:11:22] said my hour has not yet come go read
[1:11:24] the scripture again if you know what i
[1:11:27] come for you will know i have a bigger

[1:12:08] news sometimes you got to turn the
[1:12:10] negative news off you got to forget what
[1:12:13] the doctor's saying forget what the
[1:12:14] government's saying forget all the
[1:12:16] notices because they could put you in a
[1:12:18] state of fear and uncertainty why should
[1:12:21] we be afraid when we have faith and
[1:12:24] confidence in the god who called us he
[1:12:27] has kept us he is keeping us up he will
[1:12:30] keep us up the law that we serve he will
[1:12:33] not slumber he will not sleep slumbering

[1:12:44] oh hallelujah
[1:12:46] just a little encouragement
[1:12:48] the preachers have already preached i'm
[1:12:50] just a little spare tire to encourage
[1:12:52] you in this service here that we are
[1:12:54] leaving this place up your boss cannot
[1:12:57] go where you gonna go your neighbor may
[1:12:59] not be going where you gonna go so don't
[1:13:01] get upset with your neighbor don't get
[1:13:03] upset with your boss your inheritance
[1:13:06] there's not a natural inheritance your
[1:13:09] house that you live in is nothing to
[1:13:12] compare with the house your father your
[1:13:14] husband has gone to prepare for you he
[1:13:17] said i go to prepare a place that where
[1:13:20] i am you may be also behold the
[1:13:23] bridegroom cometh

[1:13:32] shake yourself
[1:13:34] shake yourself
[1:13:35] i am bride
[1:13:37] i've been elected i've been
[1:13:39] predestinated hallelujah and all the
[1:13:42] skin worms destroyed this body yet in my
[1:13:45] flesh i will see god it doesn't matter
[1:13:47] what triumph doesn't matter what
[1:13:49] situation i know i'm in the arms of the
[1:13:51] lord if he chooses to put me to sleep
[1:13:54] god bless god i'm depending on my
[1:13:56] brothers and my sisters to wake me up
[1:13:59] but if we who are alive and who remain
[1:14:03] we have a responsibility to make a
[1:14:05] church that would make a revival we have
[1:14:08] a responsibility to be ready to wake up
[1:14:11] the sleeping sins they are counting on
[1:14:13] you they are counting on me they are
[1:14:15] counting on us the prophet is waiting
[1:14:18] the prophets are waiting the apostles
[1:14:20] are awaiting the sleep and saints in
[1:14:23] every age they are waiting on us
[1:14:32] hallelujah
[1:14:33] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:14:36] you may be seated
[1:14:38] so we have a destination
[1:14:40] hallelujah and nothing is out of order
[1:14:43] there's nothing that's out of order
[1:14:45] everything is in order because god is a
[1:14:47] god of order it was chaos he stepped in
[1:14:50] and said let there be light to establish
[1:14:52] order he's a god of purpose he's a god
[1:14:56] of plans dear god is not surprised so
[1:14:59] lift up your head whatever has happened
[1:15:01] in your life god allowed it to bring you
[1:15:04] to this spot to bring you to this
[1:15:06] service to bring you to this convention
[1:15:13] [Music]
[1:15:14] you may be seated
[1:15:16] i don't know how i end up there
[1:15:17] it's not part of my notes but too many
[1:15:20] of us claim to be believers and we want
[1:15:23] to blame this one
[1:15:24] and blame that one and blame this
[1:15:26] situation and blame that situation and
[1:15:29] because of so and so it's why so and so
[1:15:32] we have become great students and
[1:15:34] explainers have caused an effect and we
[1:15:37] miss the point that god allows things to
[1:15:40] happen and if he doesn't want something
[1:15:42] to happen it could never happen man is
[1:15:45] out of the picture because god has the
[1:15:47] power to move man anywhere he wants to
[1:15:50] he raised up pharaoh he bring pharaoh
[1:15:52] down he raised up babylon he brought
[1:15:55] babylon down you don't tell me my god is
[1:15:58] not mighty don't tell me my god is that
[1:16:00] powerful
[1:16:04] [Music]
[1:16:06] he said my thoughts are not your
[1:16:08] thoughts
[1:16:09] my ways are not your ways of this whole
[1:16:12] pandemic you don't think god saw this
[1:16:14] and saw who would make it and so who
[1:16:16] would stand up and so who would still go
[1:16:19] give god praise
[1:16:20] even when we don't have church service
[1:16:22] you're in your home but you're trimming
[1:16:24] your lamp you're in your home but you're
[1:16:26] doing what you're supposed to do lamb
[1:16:28] trimming time if they lock us down you
[1:16:31] don't stop trimming oh my my mind when
[1:16:34] they get to come to church you're still
[1:16:36] trimming
[1:16:37] when you're on your jaw lamp trimming
[1:16:39] time you're always trimming every day
[1:16:41] you're trimming you wake up in the
[1:16:43] morning you're trimming this is not
[1:16:45] about your wife it's not about your
[1:16:47] children but it's about you you're
[1:16:49] trimming you're making ready you're
[1:16:51] getting embraced because you heard the
[1:16:53] cry behold the bridegroom comment get
[1:16:57] ready to meet him we have got to meet
[1:16:59] him i want to meet him i need to meet
[1:17:02] him that's why i was born i was born to
[1:17:05] meet him
[1:17:08] [Applause]
[1:17:12] [Music]
[1:17:20] [Applause]
[1:17:29] hallelujah
[1:17:31] hallelujah so
[1:17:32] let blaming people be a thing that dies
[1:17:35] in 2021
[1:17:38] if she had done this if he had done this
[1:17:41] if he did not do this if she did not do
[1:17:44] this
[1:17:45] then my life would have been different
[1:17:47] if he had done it this way if he didn't
[1:17:49] do it that way then maybe i'd be in a
[1:17:51] different place
[1:17:52] is that so
[1:17:54] you have no power over what anybody else
[1:17:56] does
[1:17:57] it there's no value
[1:17:59] there's no benefit
[1:18:01] spending time addressing things you
[1:18:03] cannot control you have no ability to
[1:18:06] control anything else out of your
[1:18:08] situation no no you have to take
[1:18:11] responsibility
[1:18:12] for what you could control and right now
[1:18:14] you have the controlling of a scissors
[1:18:18] to cut
[1:18:20] to cut from your life
[1:18:22] what should not be there
[1:18:24] so that you can shine brighter because
[1:18:26] the devil can only operate in darkness
[1:18:28] or you don't hear me this morning
[1:18:30] hallelujah the devil could only operate
[1:18:32] in darkness
[1:18:34] and you would have heard it over the
[1:18:35] services
[1:18:36] that over time
[1:18:38] and many people they out on fire
[1:18:40] but the random type of the perfect
[1:18:42] picture of the believer is the wick
[1:18:45] one end you're on fire
[1:18:46] next and you're in oil and that's a
[1:18:48] wonderful picture every believer know
[1:18:51] what that feels like to be on fire if
[1:18:54] you don't know what it feels like to be
[1:18:55] on fire you gotta check your experience
[1:18:58] again
[1:18:59] hallelujah you don't hear me this
[1:19:00] morning you've got to be on fire if
[1:19:03] you're not on fire you're not in this
[1:19:05] thing you're you're a spectator we are
[1:19:07] on the playing field this morning we are
[1:19:10] in position fighting demons left right
[1:19:12] and center and i've got to be on fire
[1:19:15] sometime the fire is brighter sometimes
[1:19:17] the fire gets a little dimmer but i'm on
[1:19:20] fire i've got to stay on fire i don't
[1:19:22] want to lose this fire i don't want to
[1:19:24] give up this fire this fire is for my
[1:19:27] soul it's it's all over me it's keeping
[1:19:30] me alive anybody feel that way
[1:19:36] i'm all over the place forgive me but i
[1:19:39] get excited
[1:19:41] so there's fire on the one hand and that
[1:19:43] wick it you can't use anything to be
[1:19:45] awake you know the wick cannot be paper
[1:19:48] because it will burn down too easily the
[1:19:50] people if it was paper paper can't draw
[1:19:52] the oil from in the lamp
[1:19:54] but it has to be a special material
[1:19:57] so at a starting point even before we
[1:19:59] address oil and fire we have to address
[1:20:01] this special material called a wick that
[1:20:04] but the branham said is the picture of
[1:20:06] the true believer this wick is a special
[1:20:09] material
[1:20:10] hallelujah not any and any kind of
[1:20:12] material or somebody help me this
[1:20:15] morning somebody help me this evening so
[1:20:17] just to be a wick is a blessing oh god
[1:20:20] help me just to be a wick puts you ahead
[1:20:23] of the park just to be a wick puts you
[1:20:26] in a special category
[1:20:28] [Applause]
[1:20:31] [Music]
[1:20:35] you may be seeing it i don't know how
[1:20:36] much effort they put into coming up with
[1:20:38] the concept of a lamp
[1:20:40] what they may have tried before to see
[1:20:42] what could work to bridge the gap
[1:20:45] between the oil and the fire hallelujah
[1:20:47] will like most things in life it takes
[1:20:50] trial and error and trying and
[1:20:52] experimentation to get something that
[1:20:54] works but when they figure out what
[1:20:56] makes a good wick then that wick was
[1:20:58] able to do something very well it was
[1:21:00] able to reach into the oil
[1:21:02] pull the oil up and once you light fire
[1:21:05] it could keep the fire burning
[1:21:10] hallelujah and that wick
[1:21:13] took its time it was not a quick burning
[1:21:15] thing
[1:21:16] it will take its time
[1:21:18] once there's oil and it could pull into
[1:21:20] the wick it will keep on burning but
[1:21:22] there's something powerful about this
[1:21:25] and this is why this inspiration is so
[1:21:27] powerful
[1:21:28] once it's in use
[1:21:30] once the lamp is lit
[1:21:32] and it's drawing oil and it's on fire
[1:21:34] there's a side effect
[1:21:36] when we are in this existence
[1:21:39] that carbon is created
[1:21:41] some darkness is created there because
[1:21:43] you have to go to your job you have to
[1:21:45] go to school you have situation in your
[1:21:47] family and you're being tossed to and
[1:21:50] fro but it is not just that there's a
[1:21:52] problem there's a solution
[1:21:54] to the problem because god will ever
[1:21:57] give you something that there's no way
[1:21:58] of escape so there's a way of escape
[1:22:01] from the trials of this life that brings
[1:22:04] cab on and by the branham says it just
[1:22:06] interferes
[1:22:09] with the flow
[1:22:10] it interferes
[1:22:12] so carbon you might say brother isaac
[1:22:14] i'm not in sin is anything interfering
[1:22:17] with your prayer life
[1:22:18] interfering with your forgiveness
[1:22:21] interfering with your worship
[1:22:24] interfering with you being in the house
[1:22:26] of god interfering with your testimony
[1:22:30] interfering with your purpose you're on
[1:22:32] the right track you know but you're not
[1:22:34] going as fast as you could go because
[1:22:36] something is interfering
[1:22:39] you're on the right road we sing the
[1:22:40] song we're traveling on the right road
[1:22:43] but you are driving slowly because
[1:22:45] something is interfering
[1:22:50] too much carbon too much interference
[1:22:54] that's why party let us lay aside every
[1:22:56] weight
[1:22:59] that so easily besets us
[1:23:02] for some people it's every day to check
[1:23:04] in the pandemic
[1:23:09] there's no sin in looking at the numbers
[1:23:13] but is it interfering
[1:23:15] with your fate
[1:23:17] is it interfering with your confidence
[1:23:19] in god is it interfering with your faith
[1:23:21] in god to preserve you because if god
[1:23:24] predestinated that you make it through
[1:23:26] this i don't care what the numbers say i
[1:23:28] don't care what the doctors say i don't
[1:23:30] care how much variants come out those
[1:23:33] barriers have to respect the names that
[1:23:35] are in the book oh you don't you don't
[1:23:37] hear me when those variants come by you
[1:23:39] they say no not this one
[1:23:41] not this one
[1:23:43] not this one i'm not saying you may not
[1:23:45] get sick but they know they can't take
[1:23:47] your life and if god allows you to go
[1:23:49] it's because he allowed it so you can be
[1:23:52] part of the sleepers who those that are
[1:23:54] alive could wake up so it all is well
[1:23:57] all is well
[1:23:58] all is well
[1:24:00] all is well all is well
[1:24:03] [Applause]
[1:24:12] i've said it before
[1:24:14] mr branham said missing limbs will be
[1:24:16] restored
[1:24:17] nobody wants to volunteer
[1:24:21] to lose a limb
[1:24:22] if i ask for volunteers people look
[1:24:24] around and say maybe brother so and so
[1:24:26] he has more faith than i do maybe sister
[1:24:29] so and so she's a prayer warrior maybe
[1:24:31] she could maybe she could volunteer
[1:24:34] to fulfill that prophecy that missing
[1:24:37] limbs will be restored there are no
[1:24:38] volunteers
[1:24:40] because it's built in us by nature by
[1:24:43] god himself to survive
[1:24:45] [Applause]
[1:24:47] it's built in us to overcome
[1:24:49] it is not a willing thing for us to chop
[1:24:51] off an arm or foot or no it's not that
[1:24:53] easy for us
[1:24:55] even jesus didn't want to die
[1:24:58] [Music]
[1:25:00] that's why the god of gethsemane say
[1:25:02] lord if it's possible if it's possible
[1:25:06] i enjoy life too much
[1:25:09] because we were born to live
[1:25:16] and because he lives we can live
[1:25:18] so life is something to cherish
[1:25:20] it's something to preserve
[1:25:22] it's something to protect we have a
[1:25:24] reason to live for
[1:25:27] but there are also scriptures and
[1:25:28] prophecies that need be fulfilled
[1:25:31] and because god knows there are no
[1:25:33] volunteers
[1:25:36] god by election
[1:25:38] god by predestination
[1:25:40] would pick in the classroom
[1:25:42] who he chooses to take down a certain
[1:25:44] road
[1:25:45] or don't you love god that is not our
[1:25:48] choice in all these things he could
[1:25:50] choose knowing that all things work
[1:25:52] together for good to them that love god
[1:25:55] to them who are be called according to
[1:25:58] his purpose
[1:25:59] [Applause]
[1:26:01] [Music]
[1:26:05] everybody feeling fine
[1:26:07] hallelujah what a mighty god we saved so
[1:26:11] we trust him
[1:26:12] in this response of behold the
[1:26:14] bridegroom
[1:26:15] commit
[1:26:17] just a few thoughts i want to share with
[1:26:18] you and know like i said you have been
[1:26:20] preached to so just to encourage you in
[1:26:22] this last service of the convention
[1:26:25] in the message putting on the whole
[1:26:27] armor of god now god cannot make a
[1:26:29] decision today
[1:26:31] and tomorrow come back and make a better
[1:26:33] decision
[1:26:34] that's us we
[1:26:36] we find a better way to do something we
[1:26:38] make a better decision but not god god
[1:26:40] cannot make a decision today and
[1:26:42] tomorrow come back and make a better
[1:26:44] decision because his first decision is
[1:26:47] perfect
[1:26:48] he never has to change it so therefore
[1:26:50] we can rest upon whatever god says and
[1:26:53] if god made a decision to put your name
[1:26:55] down in the book he already made a
[1:26:57] perfect decision he knows you're gonna
[1:26:59] make it he knows you're gonna overcome
[1:27:02] he knows you're going to receive the
[1:27:03] holy ghost he knows you're going to come
[1:27:05] to perfection he knows your name when
[1:27:08] the word is spoken you can't help but
[1:27:10] respond you can't help but say amen i
[1:27:14] see my name not the literal name but the
[1:27:16] mystery of who you are the mystery of
[1:27:19] your purpose the mystery of your
[1:27:22] destination the mystery of your lineage
[1:27:25] the mystery of your bloodline the
[1:27:27] mystery of your immunity the mystery of
[1:27:30] who you are
[1:27:32] [Music]
[1:27:34] blessed
[1:27:36] be the name of the lord
[1:27:39] it's always been god's way
[1:27:42] in modern events are made clear by
[1:27:43] prophecy it's always been god's way to
[1:27:46] let his people know what's going to
[1:27:48] happen
[1:27:49] before it happens
[1:27:50] he doesn't let everybody know
[1:27:52] but god lets his people know
[1:27:54] a predestinated people are called out
[1:27:56] people are chosen people so god's people
[1:27:59] are never surprised for years we talk
[1:28:02] about wars and rumors of wars and all
[1:28:05] these things and and we are living in it
[1:28:08] it should come to no surprise to us
[1:28:10] we knew we knew all these years that
[1:28:12] there were dark forces at work
[1:28:14] and all these things would lead up into
[1:28:16] a world system and a world order and a
[1:28:18] monetary system and all these things
[1:28:20] unfolding and we could spend hours and
[1:28:22] hours preaching on that but that is not
[1:28:24] getting me ready
[1:28:25] we just got to know we've got to
[1:28:27] understand it's good to see the signs of
[1:28:28] the time but i'm more interested in
[1:28:30] being ready because only they that are
[1:28:33] ready are the ones will go in
[1:28:35] so it's about the focus now
[1:28:38] that we are at this point about being
[1:28:41] ready
[1:28:43] we know how the story is going to end
[1:28:45] and i can imagine those virgins knew
[1:28:48] enough to know what was expected of them
[1:28:53] some
[1:28:54] underestimated the preparation
[1:28:59] and some
[1:29:03] were more prepared than required
[1:29:06] because they have extra
[1:29:09] means you have more than you need at the
[1:29:11] point in time
[1:29:14] i want to make that distinction one more
[1:29:16] time
[1:29:18] the foolish underestimated the cost
[1:29:22] underestimated the requirement
[1:29:25] underestimated what was needed
[1:29:28] but the wise they were more prepared
[1:29:34] i remember in school
[1:29:37] and i'm sure in different situations
[1:29:39] you've all went through this way you had
[1:29:40] an exam to take
[1:29:42] and there comes a point
[1:29:44] as you walk into the exam room there's
[1:29:46] nothing else you could do
[1:29:50] at that point in time you cannot have
[1:29:52] any books
[1:29:54] any recordings
[1:29:55] any class notes anything you you are
[1:29:58] going into that exam room with what you
[1:30:00] have
[1:30:02] and many people go into the exam room
[1:30:04] under underprepared
[1:30:08] and there are those who go in the exam
[1:30:09] room over prepared
[1:30:13] and it blew my mind years ago because
[1:30:15] they are students in every classroom
[1:30:17] we know them
[1:30:18] that you know they're underprepared
[1:30:21] you have to wonder about it
[1:30:23] everything about them speaks of a lack
[1:30:25] of a desire to be prepared
[1:30:28] they think they take things casually
[1:30:30] maybe they come from a privileged
[1:30:32] environment
[1:30:33] maybe they came from an underprivileged
[1:30:35] environment it doesn't really matter
[1:30:36] what environment it came from the issue
[1:30:38] is prepared
[1:30:40] or not prepared
[1:30:43] and you could see the discomfort in the
[1:30:45] exam room after a few minutes
[1:30:47] with those who are unprepared
[1:30:50] because in a few minutes time they're
[1:30:51] almost close to finish
[1:30:53] and it makes you wonder am i doing
[1:30:55] something wrong if you don't know their
[1:30:57] state you will wonder if something wrong
[1:30:59] with you
[1:31:00] not realizing that they just don't know
[1:31:02] the answer and they cannot give an
[1:31:05] account
[1:31:06] for all of the time
[1:31:08] the money the sacrifice whatever it is
[1:31:12] to put them into that room
[1:31:15] many times school teachers tell their
[1:31:18] students in preparing for an exam
[1:31:21] there are 10 modules in this course
[1:31:23] but i'm only testing you on six of these
[1:31:25] modules
[1:31:27] and i remember there was one student i
[1:31:29] know
[1:31:30] who no matter what the teacher said he
[1:31:33] studied alton
[1:31:36] even though the teacher said you're
[1:31:37] going to get tested on six he was just
[1:31:39] that kind of a student
[1:31:43] that what was taught he wanted to know
[1:31:45] it
[1:31:47] and it made me looking at this to give
[1:31:49] an example to maybe help the young
[1:31:51] people
[1:31:53] with what you could relate to
[1:31:55] you could choose to do the bare minimum
[1:31:58] in that scenario where the teacher said
[1:32:00] i'm testing you out of six out of ten
[1:32:03] models that six modules is really the
[1:32:06] minimum
[1:32:07] there are those who would say i'm
[1:32:08] studying all 10 because i'm not here
[1:32:10] just to pass an exam i really want to
[1:32:12] learn
[1:32:13] it's rare to hear it's rare to see but
[1:32:15] they still do exist
[1:32:16] and there are those who say i study in
[1:32:18] one module two modules because maybe
[1:32:20] it's just not that important to them
[1:32:23] but in that exam room how prepared you
[1:32:26] are puts you in a position of strength
[1:32:30] or weakness
[1:32:32] those foolish virgins
[1:32:34] they were prepared
[1:32:36] just not
[1:32:37] prepared enough
[1:32:44] how horrible is it to sit in the message
[1:32:46] for years
[1:32:48] and just be prepared
[1:32:52] and dismiss it because you're just not
[1:32:54] prepared
[1:32:55] enough
[1:32:57] versus the wise virgin who say you know
[1:33:00] what i'm not
[1:33:01] taking
[1:33:02] any chances
[1:33:05] is there anybody in the house who
[1:33:07] doesn't want to take a chance
[1:33:18] so we know how the story is going to end
[1:33:21] now let me just touch a few things
[1:33:25] this scripture that we read the kingdom
[1:33:27] of heaven
[1:33:30] through many parables and examples
[1:33:33] the lord left clues to us for us to look
[1:33:35] at this kingdom of heaven
[1:33:37] and i want us to understand that this
[1:33:39] bridegroom that we are typing out here
[1:33:42] is not any kind of bridegroom he's a
[1:33:43] bridegroom who is also a king
[1:33:47] because the reference is this is like
[1:33:48] the kingdom of heaven
[1:33:50] so it's not a bridegroom like this into
[1:33:52] any kind of bridegroom it's a king is
[1:33:54] about to be married
[1:33:56] and in many examples jesus said the
[1:33:58] kingdom of heaven is like a net cast in
[1:34:00] the sea that god does every
[1:34:02] kind and he's trying to use different
[1:34:05] examples to get the people to see what
[1:34:08] he's trying for them to see
[1:34:10] so the kingdom of heaven is like a net
[1:34:12] cast in the sea and it gathers every
[1:34:14] kind by every kind it means there's god
[1:34:16] there's bad there's ugly
[1:34:18] being called
[1:34:20] but there's always a time of separation
[1:34:25] he said the kingdom of heaven is like a
[1:34:26] man who had a wedding for his son and
[1:34:28] said come all things are
[1:34:30] ready and people had excuses you you
[1:34:33] remember
[1:34:36] the kingdom is having like a merchant
[1:34:39] seeking pearls to sell
[1:34:41] but sells all when he finds a pearl of
[1:34:43] great price
[1:34:45] speaking of the great sacrifice we need
[1:34:48] to make
[1:34:49] about this thing called the kingdom
[1:34:52] are you willing to sell all you have to
[1:34:54] get this pool of great price
[1:34:58] is this world of great price more
[1:35:00] important to you than everything else
[1:35:04] then we come to matthew 25 our text
[1:35:06] tonight the kingdom of heaven is like
[1:35:10] and jesus gives a
[1:35:12] parable a story
[1:35:15] an example filled with so much truths
[1:35:18] that is on the one hand there's
[1:35:20] rejoicing and on the other hand there's
[1:35:22] pain
[1:35:23] and there's despair
[1:35:25] but typically with the wedding there's
[1:35:27] there's a moment of excitement
[1:35:29] weddings are exciting
[1:35:30] it's it's an exciting occasion
[1:35:33] it's a joyous thing especially now more
[1:35:35] than ever where people have lost their
[1:35:37] values and their morals and these things
[1:35:40] and they play games even in the church
[1:35:43] even in the message people are playing
[1:35:45] games so it's an honorable thing
[1:35:47] when we have a wedding
[1:35:51] god is excited about this wedding
[1:35:54] it's been spoken throughout scripture so
[1:35:56] if you are excited i can assure you god
[1:35:58] is more excited
[1:36:00] about this wedding that he's taken about
[1:36:02] here he has waited a long time for this
[1:36:04] even when adam stood there in the garden
[1:36:06] of eden god looked at him looked at
[1:36:08] himself and he said i know what adam is
[1:36:10] feeling it's not good for that man to be
[1:36:12] alone and he brought a bride for his son
[1:36:15] adam oh hallelujah and every age he's
[1:36:18] looking at husband and wife and looking
[1:36:21] at marriage on field until one time he
[1:36:23] god himself saying i'm gonna have a
[1:36:24] bride
[1:36:26] oh hallelujah i'm gonna have a bride and
[1:36:29] his wife had made herself ready
[1:36:32] can the church say man
[1:36:34] god waited throughout history there had
[1:36:36] been many many weddings even jesus his
[1:36:39] first miracle
[1:36:41] was at a wedding
[1:36:43] anybody with me this morning
[1:36:45] many beautiful brides many bridegrooms
[1:36:47] but this wedding we're talking about
[1:36:49] that's in this parable that jesus has
[1:36:51] given is different because this
[1:36:53] bridegroom is different this is the
[1:36:56] wedding of weddings it's not the wedding
[1:36:58] of the century it's the wedding of
[1:37:00] eternity it's a wedding of time blending
[1:37:03] into eternity as god himself is about to
[1:37:06] take his wife
[1:37:10] it is not any bridegroom i don't know
[1:37:12] how many people have to speak at this
[1:37:14] wedding because this bridegroom goes by
[1:37:16] many names you know at a wedding people
[1:37:19] say things about the bride and they say
[1:37:21] things about the bridegroom can we talk
[1:37:23] about the bridegroom a little bit before
[1:37:25] we talk about the pride i can imagine
[1:37:27] people beginning to speak at the wedding
[1:37:29] of this pride and this bridegroom to
[1:37:31] describe this groom because he goes by
[1:37:34] many names he is king of kings he is
[1:37:36] lord of lords he is mighty in battle
[1:37:39] he's a wheel in the middle of the wheel
[1:37:41] he's a rock we need to rock his el
[1:37:44] shaddai he is jehovah jireh i can
[1:37:47] imagine how long it will take to give
[1:37:49] words about this bridegroom when in a
[1:37:52] wedding somebody talks about the groom
[1:37:54] they say well he is this he is that
[1:37:55] where this groom we're talking about i
[1:37:57] don't know when we'll finish talking
[1:37:59] about him because he is everything to me
[1:38:02] he is my joy he is my peace he is my
[1:38:05] rocker he is my salvation david said the
[1:38:08] lord is my shepherd
[1:38:11] anybody with me
[1:38:13] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:38:15] lord
[1:38:22] hallelujah
[1:38:24] and this bride
[1:38:26] i don't know how we're going to describe
[1:38:27] this bride
[1:38:28] because there's been churches churches
[1:38:30] brides brides churches churches rights
[1:38:32] but there must come one who has got
[1:38:34] mechanics and dynamics i can imagine how
[1:38:37] the lord himself because i don't think
[1:38:39] anybody else could speak about his pride
[1:38:41] like the bridegroom
[1:38:44] because that's flesh of his flesh
[1:38:47] it's only adam but a punch could have
[1:38:50] addressed even
[1:38:51] look and say this is flesh of my flesh
[1:38:54] this is born of my bone you are you came
[1:38:56] out of me he could have described who
[1:38:59] she was hallelujah but i could see god
[1:39:01] with the bridegroom looking at his bride
[1:39:03] and saying after all these years
[1:39:06] after all these dispensations after all
[1:39:08] these people after all this journey
[1:39:12] after all the sacrifice after calvary
[1:39:15] after the persecution i've sent kings
[1:39:18] i've seen priests i've sent prophets but
[1:39:20] finally mrs jesus christ there's no lady
[1:39:25] like this lady there's no queen like
[1:39:28] this queen there's no body on the earth
[1:39:32] you made me see that just think of how
[1:39:35] god talked about job have you considered
[1:39:37] my silver job and that's what's talking
[1:39:39] about joe this is his wife you're
[1:39:40] talking about have you looked at this
[1:39:42] lady have you looked at this bride who
[1:39:44] could sign like me who could finish what
[1:39:48] i oh come on now somebody help me preach
[1:39:50] this morning
[1:39:52] i'm not going to be too much longer with
[1:39:54] you but just very quickly
[1:39:57] the same way the lamp we don't have it
[1:39:59] anymore
[1:40:00] certainly in most of the world
[1:40:02] the technology has evolved and people
[1:40:04] are not used to these lamps and wicks
[1:40:06] and you know you still see them in
[1:40:08] certain places and in certain situations
[1:40:10] but a lot has changed in the way we do
[1:40:12] things and here in the western world the
[1:40:14] way weddings take place have also
[1:40:16] changed
[1:40:17] but this scripture in matthew 25 is of a
[1:40:20] specific pattern because it is based on
[1:40:23] the way weddings take place in that day
[1:40:25] in that time and in that location
[1:40:27] and a wedding is not like it is today
[1:40:29] there were multiple steps to a wedding
[1:40:32] so i want to quickly address those
[1:40:34] before i bring this message home to
[1:40:36] bring the type out
[1:40:38] you obviously cannot get married unless
[1:40:40] you have someone to marry
[1:40:43] so for god to get married he has to
[1:40:45] firstly find somebody
[1:40:48] to get married
[1:40:49] not just anybody but somebody you could
[1:40:51] talk to
[1:40:52] somebody who could relate to you
[1:40:54] somebody you can make plans with
[1:40:56] somebody who understands you you have to
[1:40:59] be careful because you want to make not
[1:41:01] a choice not a kind of choice but you
[1:41:04] want to make the best choice
[1:41:06] so for god to choose a pride if you are
[1:41:09] bride then you are his
[1:41:12] best choice you you you receiving that
[1:41:14] this morning
[1:41:20] you have to take your time in making
[1:41:22] that choice because that person
[1:41:23] represents you
[1:41:26] and that's why brother branham will say
[1:41:28] remember the bride will be a called out
[1:41:30] separated and different filled holy
[1:41:33] ghost born washed in the blood of the
[1:41:35] lamb she'll abstain from everything
[1:41:37] that's filthy
[1:41:39] she's a chaste virgin pure by the word
[1:41:41] the word and her are the same
[1:41:43] as a man and his wife become one in
[1:41:45] union so does the real genuine church of
[1:41:48] god when he becomes in christ the bible
[1:41:51] is punctuated with an amen every promise
[1:41:54] don't make any difference what the
[1:41:56] denomination says the soul that's in the
[1:41:58] believer punctuates it because it's a
[1:42:00] word in him speaking out
[1:42:03] so that first part is the selection of a
[1:42:06] pride or the choosing of a bride
[1:42:09] anybody with me
[1:42:12] after that bride is selected
[1:42:15] then there's a period called the
[1:42:17] contract
[1:42:19] where the groom draws up a marriage
[1:42:22] contract
[1:42:23] it's a covenant or it's a contract
[1:42:25] promise
[1:42:27] and a document is usually used for the
[1:42:29] purpose listen of assuring the bride
[1:42:33] assuring sorry that the bride will be
[1:42:35] provided for
[1:42:39] in some tradition it's called a bridal
[1:42:41] payment
[1:42:43] it's a guarantee that this bride don't
[1:42:45] have to worry
[1:42:46] about where she's gonna sleep
[1:42:48] worry about where she's gonna live worry
[1:42:50] about how she's gonna get food
[1:42:52] isn't that right
[1:42:54] and that contract changes the bride's
[1:42:57] status
[1:43:00] because it's not just it is not just a
[1:43:02] kind of thing there's another contract
[1:43:05] or it's it's it's what we call an
[1:43:07] engagement
[1:43:09] in the old days it was formalized now we
[1:43:10] just call it an engagement but in the
[1:43:12] old days it's not just engaged you have
[1:43:14] you have something seen what's going to
[1:43:16] happen next
[1:43:17] so you can rest your feet on this
[1:43:19] contract
[1:43:20] that says there's going to be a house
[1:43:21] provided for you
[1:43:23] and there's going to be food provided
[1:43:24] for you when you walk when you wake up
[1:43:26] in the morning some days you're going to
[1:43:27] get breakfast in bed
[1:43:33] anybody with me
[1:43:34] you're going to be well taken care of
[1:43:38] because this groom is more unable
[1:43:41] and he is making a commitment
[1:43:44] he's making a promise
[1:43:46] not just a verbal promise but in the old
[1:43:48] days it was a written promise so it's
[1:43:50] i'm coming for you but look i'm also
[1:43:52] writing down what i am putting in place
[1:43:56] to give your comfort so because you're
[1:43:58] not going to see me for a while whenever
[1:44:00] you're wondering what's going on pull
[1:44:02] the contract
[1:44:03] pull the document because the document
[1:44:06] says i am going to make sure there's
[1:44:08] food on your table i'm gonna make sure
[1:44:11] that you are taken care of i'm gonna
[1:44:13] make sure you smile i'm gonna make sure
[1:44:15] there's laughter in the house
[1:44:17] anybody anybody help me this morning
[1:44:24] once agreed that contract it became
[1:44:27] binding on both parties
[1:44:29] and they were regarded as husband and
[1:44:31] wife the bride was declared sanctified
[1:44:34] and set apart for her bridegroom
[1:44:37] so from that contract you set aside
[1:44:40] you nobody branham said god slipped the
[1:44:42] wedding ring
[1:44:44] on you before the foundation of the
[1:44:45] world do you realize that you're set
[1:44:47] aside
[1:44:48] sat aside you were born and you didn't
[1:44:51] even know you were set aside oh come on
[1:44:53] somebody preached back to me do you know
[1:44:54] who you are do you know what you're
[1:44:56] called to do do you know what your
[1:44:57] promise is
[1:44:59] [Applause]
[1:45:03] so because in that contract that young
[1:45:05] lady
[1:45:07] was no longer available
[1:45:11] she is taken
[1:45:13] she is off the market she is spoken for
[1:45:16] do not approach
[1:45:17] [Music]
[1:45:18] and she is to not let anybody approach
[1:45:21] come on young people don't you know
[1:45:23] you're paid for don't you know there's a
[1:45:26] contract don't you know there's
[1:45:27] agreement about your life you need to
[1:45:29] stop letting people approach
[1:45:35] anybody with me this morning
[1:45:37] so after that contract the next phase
[1:45:39] was a public announcement
[1:45:41] they call it a baptism or public
[1:45:43] announcement and it was common for the
[1:45:45] bride and groom to be separately taken a
[1:45:48] ritual immersion called a mikvah in the
[1:45:50] jewish tombs
[1:45:52] a representation of like a new birth the
[1:45:55] person emerged from the womb as a new
[1:45:56] person separated
[1:45:58] that does this song familiar we don't
[1:46:00] have it here in the west but but that
[1:46:02] was the process that's how serious this
[1:46:04] wedding thing is the couple would then
[1:46:07] make public
[1:46:08] so the contract part was in secret
[1:46:11] but now after the ritual baptism there's
[1:46:14] a public declaration of their intention
[1:46:16] to be betrothed
[1:46:18] and they were not they were considered
[1:46:20] married but not yet entered into a
[1:46:22] physical relationship so now it's
[1:46:24] getting deeper and deeper
[1:46:27] now after that there is a separation by
[1:46:29] design
[1:46:31] the groom then prepares to leave
[1:46:34] promising to return for the bride after
[1:46:37] a place is prepared
[1:46:39] [Applause]
[1:46:41] so now he knows that this thing is in
[1:46:43] place now it's preparation now he has to
[1:46:45] put things in place for the new couple
[1:46:47] at the father's home the bride listen
[1:46:49] doesn't know the time or the day
[1:46:52] but it's expected to be prepared and
[1:46:54] ready and separated until the return of
[1:46:58] the groom to claim her
[1:47:02] so she is on the expectation and it's
[1:47:04] bacon preparation because you don't know
[1:47:06] the day she don't know the hour but he's
[1:47:08] going to prepare
[1:47:10] meanwhile the groom returned to his
[1:47:12] father's home
[1:47:14] where he begins preparing for the
[1:47:16] eventual bringing home of his bride
[1:47:19] i go to prepare a place in my father's
[1:47:22] house and many anybody know what i'm
[1:47:24] talking about
[1:47:25] [Applause]
[1:47:27] you know this
[1:47:28] and listen the groom returns his
[1:47:30] father's home where he begins preparing
[1:47:32] for the eventual bringing home of his
[1:47:34] bride this was overseen by the father
[1:47:37] so it's not just the bridegroom doing
[1:47:40] what he wants
[1:47:41] the father has a vested interest in the
[1:47:44] way this is happening it's not happening
[1:47:47] any any kind of a way there's a way so
[1:47:50] it is overseen by the father who
[1:47:52] determines when it is finished
[1:47:56] so it is not even but equals up to the
[1:47:58] groom to say already you know you know
[1:48:00] some people don't say already and when
[1:48:01] they check
[1:48:02] but you didn't
[1:48:04] you didn't put the light here
[1:48:06] this switch need to fix
[1:48:07] this bed need to move here
[1:48:11] there has to be an approval
[1:48:14] an approval process
[1:48:16] to make sure it's really ready this was
[1:48:18] overseen by the father who determines
[1:48:20] when it is finished so that the son can
[1:48:23] return to bring his bride home
[1:48:25] in the meantime the bride is preparing
[1:48:28] for the eventual return of the groom and
[1:48:30] lives
[1:48:31] in anticipation
[1:48:34] is there anybody living in anticipation
[1:48:39] oh my my my my mind
[1:48:44] preparation and anticipation
[1:48:46] and the last stage is the groom returns
[1:48:49] at the end of the betrayal period to
[1:48:51] claim his bride
[1:48:53] the bride is aware of a general time but
[1:48:55] not the exact day or the hour
[1:48:58] this makes the arrival time somewhat of
[1:49:01] a surprise
[1:49:03] so the pride is always to be ready
[1:49:07] and this usually takes place at night
[1:49:12] and someone would go ahead to make the
[1:49:14] announcement of the groom's arrival
[1:49:16] usually shouting behold the bridegroom
[1:49:19] comment
[1:49:21] this would be followed by the sounding
[1:49:23] of a trumpet and the celebration to
[1:49:26] leave for the wedding
[1:49:28] can the church say amen
[1:49:30] so jesus was describing in matthew 25
[1:49:34] what he was about to do it was more than
[1:49:37] just a parable it was more than a story
[1:49:40] jesus was seeing this unfolding
[1:49:44] and he was the first one to preach the
[1:49:46] message behold the bride will commit
[1:49:49] at some point in time every true
[1:49:51] disciple of christ would have preached
[1:49:53] that message behold a bride come cometh
[1:49:56] paul preach it hallelujah behold the
[1:49:58] bridegroom comment even paul paul
[1:50:01] thought the rapture was coming then you
[1:50:02] know
[1:50:06] paul put himself he said we who are
[1:50:08] alive
[1:50:10] but he claimed paul saw himself in
[1:50:12] rapture you know he said we who are
[1:50:14] alive and paul didn't know that he would
[1:50:16] join those who would sleep
[1:50:18] so real was it to him he thought he had
[1:50:20] come any day now because he knew jesus
[1:50:23] said i go to prepare a place
[1:50:24] hallelujah but man had to wait
[1:50:28] for every age
[1:50:29] for every season for every age to unfold
[1:50:32] paul put himself but he fell asleep
[1:50:34] irenaeus would have preached this
[1:50:36] message behold the bridegroom comment
[1:50:39] you cannot not preach this message
[1:50:41] because this is jesus message he
[1:50:43] preached in matthew 25 and every single
[1:50:46] preacher has to preach the same message
[1:50:49] announcing behold the bridegroom cometh
[1:50:53] irenaeus preach that message but he fell
[1:50:56] asleep
[1:50:57] martin he preached a message but he fell
[1:51:00] asleep columba he preached a message but
[1:51:03] he fell asleep luther preached a message
[1:51:07] but he fell asleep wesley preached a
[1:51:09] message but he fell asleep brother
[1:51:12] branham preached a message
[1:51:14] and he fell asleep
[1:51:16] but now
[1:51:18] here we are in 2021
[1:51:21] we are preaching this message
[1:51:23] we are preaching the message because
[1:51:25] this is the last people of the last age
[1:51:28] there's no more ages to come
[1:51:30] no more messengers to come they all
[1:51:33] thought it wasn't their day but here we
[1:51:35] are it's our day we shall not all sleep
[1:51:40] we shall not all sleep
[1:51:44] behold the bridegroom cometh
[1:51:47] this message friends
[1:51:48] god bless you with a solomon for this
[1:51:50] inspiration will not be preached by
[1:51:52] another generation
[1:51:54] oh hallelujah this message will not be
[1:51:57] preached by another generation this is
[1:52:00] it
[1:52:01] this is it this generation shall not
[1:52:03] pass until all is fulfilled
[1:52:06] last age
[1:52:07] last season
[1:52:08] seventh watch this is our day this is it
[1:52:12] this is it this is it this is what we've
[1:52:14] been waiting for this is what we've been
[1:52:16] holding on for
[1:52:17] [Music]
[1:52:18] oh hallelujah hallelujah i'm not going
[1:52:22] to be too much longer with you but let's
[1:52:23] go
[1:52:26] we have heard this but matthew 25 verse
[1:52:28] 1
[1:52:29] then shall the kingdom of heaven
[1:52:32] be likened unto 10 virgins
[1:52:34] [Applause]
[1:52:38] which took their lamps
[1:52:41] and went forth to meet the bridegroom so
[1:52:44] i want to identify here there are many
[1:52:46] things here
[1:52:47] but this is not people who don't want to
[1:52:49] make it
[1:52:52] this is not people who want to live in
[1:52:53] the world
[1:52:56] because
[1:52:57] they took their lambs they all tend took
[1:52:59] their lamps
[1:53:00] so taking up the lamp
[1:53:03] is not a separator
[1:53:06] they all went for to meet him
[1:53:09] so going forth to meet him all 10 did
[1:53:12] that
[1:53:14] dad also was not even a separator
[1:53:16] [Music]
[1:53:18] the bible goes on in verse two and five
[1:53:20] of them were wise
[1:53:22] five were foolish
[1:53:23] all virgins
[1:53:25] all holy
[1:53:26] all sanctified all going to church all
[1:53:30] reading their bible all in the message
[1:53:33] just somewhere wise some were foolish
[1:53:36] one taken
[1:53:37] one left all have the books all have the
[1:53:40] tapes all in the inspiration or believe
[1:53:43] the prophet all know the prophecies at
[1:53:45] hand all know the time is at hand
[1:53:48] because they all took their lambs and
[1:53:50] they all went fought to meet the
[1:53:52] bridegroom so the issue was not an
[1:53:54] awareness of time is short the issue is
[1:53:56] that an awareness that the season has
[1:53:58] come some were wise and some were
[1:54:01] foolish
[1:54:08] took their lamps
[1:54:10] and take no oil in the amplified it says
[1:54:12] no extra oil so they had oil
[1:54:16] but they had no extra
[1:54:19] but the wise took oil in their vessels
[1:54:21] with their lamps
[1:54:22] but they ran on taught us the oil
[1:54:24] represents the holy spirit
[1:54:26] so the difference
[1:54:27] between the wise and the foolish is not
[1:54:31] what church you go to
[1:54:32] the difference between the wise and the
[1:54:34] foolish is not which convention you
[1:54:36] listen to the difference between the
[1:54:39] wise and the foolish is not what
[1:54:41] inspiration you belong in the difference
[1:54:43] in the wise and the foolish is not who
[1:54:46] your pastor is the difference between
[1:54:48] the wise and the foolish was that if he
[1:54:50] was with the prophet or you was in the
[1:54:52] prophet the devil between the wise and
[1:54:54] the foolish is that if you're in branham
[1:54:56] tabernacle you're in headstone
[1:54:57] tabernacle or you're in any tabernacle
[1:55:00] [Applause]
[1:55:02] the difference between the rise and the
[1:55:04] foolish is that how long you're in the
[1:55:06] message the difference between the wise
[1:55:08] and the foolish is not even how long you
[1:55:10] pray
[1:55:11] the difference between the wise and the
[1:55:13] foolish is that how much quotes you read
[1:55:15] how you can explain the mysteries how
[1:55:17] you could interpret the word
[1:55:19] hallelujah the difference between the
[1:55:22] wise and the foolish
[1:55:24] was not if they had lamps
[1:55:26] the difference between the wise and the
[1:55:27] foolish was not if they even were on
[1:55:30] fire
[1:55:33] because they were all lit
[1:55:39] there's only one difference
[1:55:41] not two not three not five not seven
[1:55:44] there's only one difference
[1:55:47] the wise have lamps
[1:55:50] and oil
[1:55:51] and extra oil
[1:55:52] [Music]
[1:55:56] and that extra oil signified preparation
[1:56:01] admit you were ready
[1:56:06] [Music]
[1:56:08] people are happy
[1:56:09] to say i'm in this church i'm in that
[1:56:12] church i'm in the message
[1:56:17] all of that
[1:56:19] has no value
[1:56:21] when the bridegroom comes
[1:56:24] and you want to meet him
[1:56:28] the extra oil is the difference
[1:56:32] when the branham said the difference is
[1:56:33] the token
[1:56:36] but in branson after you receive the
[1:56:38] holy ghost here make yourself a
[1:56:39] christian
[1:56:41] so we're just talking about the birth on
[1:56:43] our experience we're talking about
[1:56:45] because people have experiences
[1:56:47] and the oil
[1:56:49] over time
[1:56:52] burns
[1:56:53] because the oil keeps you alive
[1:56:56] [Music]
[1:56:57] that's why when the disciples
[1:56:59] they were already filled with the holy
[1:57:01] ghost
[1:57:02] after they beat them they were all
[1:57:03] refilled with the holy ghost they were
[1:57:06] topping up their lamp
[1:57:08] because the process of life
[1:57:10] that oil is burning
[1:57:12] that oil is sustaining you
[1:57:14] and if you don't top it up
[1:57:16] you're going to run out
[1:57:18] if you don't keep putting oil you're
[1:57:20] going to run out of oil i'm not saying
[1:57:22] you never had oil i'm not saying you
[1:57:24] never had an experience i'm not saying
[1:57:26] you were never filled i'm not seeing you
[1:57:28] we're not packed out i'm not seeing you
[1:57:30] when a day in 1983. i was saying it
[1:57:32] wasn't there in this year and that year
[1:57:34] but but when last have you topped
[1:57:37] when last have you filled back
[1:57:40] because you've been burning on the same
[1:57:42] oil for some time
[1:57:44] aren't you concerned you're going to run
[1:57:46] out
[1:57:47] aren't you concerned that that that that
[1:57:49] that that that you're not going to have
[1:57:51] enough are you sitting down in church
[1:57:54] living on your experience some years ago
[1:57:57] and you don't realize you don't have
[1:57:58] enough because the foolish they did not
[1:58:01] realize until it was too late
[1:58:04] they were holding on thinking god was
[1:58:06] going to come earlier and because they
[1:58:09] tarried he tarried he tarried and they
[1:58:12] laid it there complacent with the layada
[1:58:15] sea on spirit didn't realize
[1:58:19] it was running out
[1:58:20] [Applause]
[1:58:22] oh help us help us i'm not going to be
[1:58:25] too much longer
[1:58:26] friends
[1:58:28] [Music]
[1:58:32] you're driving your car
[1:58:34] and they give you a gauge
[1:58:36] to show how much gas you have left
[1:58:40] if only
[1:58:41] it was so easy
[1:58:43] to know what oil
[1:58:46] we had left
[1:58:48] because when you're driving
[1:58:51] after a while when you drop below
[1:58:53] certain level a warning light comes on
[1:58:55] in case you didn't notice to let you
[1:58:58] know listen if you don't put more gas in
[1:59:01] this car
[1:59:02] you are going to shut
[1:59:04] down
[1:59:06] but the problem is there's no gauge
[1:59:09] for this holy ghost oil thing
[1:59:13] and the only gauge we could trust
[1:59:16] is to get extra
[1:59:18] [Applause]
[1:59:20] the only way to be sure brother anthony
[1:59:23] is to have extra
[1:59:26] [Music]
[1:59:28] [Applause]
[1:59:32] if it had a gauge you would know the
[1:59:34] condition you came into church with
[1:59:38] you would know if you're 90
[1:59:40] 70 50 40 30
[1:59:43] and they say pray for me or
[1:59:46] but it's not like that
[1:59:48] you come to church knowing it is not
[1:59:50] well and situations they are blocking
[1:59:52] you carbon in your life
[1:59:58] it's two things i want to make a
[2:00:00] distinction friends
[2:00:03] he may be seated
[2:00:06] extra oil
[2:00:11] the difference brother branham said the
[2:00:13] difference is the token the token is the
[2:00:14] life
[2:00:15] the virtues the thunders the voices
[2:00:18] charity only the life perfect love can
[2:00:21] be received by the groom
[2:00:23] not a show not a performance not
[2:00:27] these are the books that i've collected
[2:00:29] this is my ipad with all of the
[2:00:31] prophet's messages that that doesn't cut
[2:00:33] it
[2:00:34] [Music]
[2:00:37] friends
[2:00:38] we'll get to it
[2:00:40] the lambs burning out is a scary concept
[2:00:43] because
[2:00:44] it meant that the darkness that they
[2:00:46] were in
[2:00:48] they couldn't make it to the bright room
[2:00:52] they needed light
[2:00:55] to make it out
[2:00:58] i don't know at what point the fool is
[2:01:00] realized wait a minute
[2:01:02] because the bible said they're all trim
[2:01:04] did that
[2:01:06] so even the foolish
[2:01:08] trim their lambs
[2:01:10] oh oh ho
[2:01:12] oh
[2:01:13] so it's not just the wild shrimp and the
[2:01:15] lamb sir
[2:01:20] the foolish treatment the alarms too
[2:01:26] but if you study this thing
[2:01:29] when there's carbon it slows down the
[2:01:32] burning and it slows down the lighting
[2:01:35] because it's only so much oil could come
[2:01:37] up a week
[2:01:39] that is damaged
[2:01:41] there's no free flow
[2:01:43] so when you cut
[2:01:45] and you cut that wick and you trim the
[2:01:47] lamp the floor starts back the light
[2:01:50] gets bright
[2:01:51] it begins to burn the oil faster than
[2:01:54] when there was carbon there
[2:01:56] so a small fire and carbon uses a little
[2:01:59] bit of reserve of oil
[2:02:00] but when you trim the lamp
[2:02:02] all of a sudden the flow accelerates to
[2:02:05] truly light up your situation
[2:02:07] and at that point you're ready but wait
[2:02:09] a minute if this thing keeps burning the
[2:02:10] rate it's going i'm not gonna have
[2:02:13] enough oil i'm gonna be walking down
[2:02:15] this road and i'm gonna lose light
[2:02:18] before i make it on the other side
[2:02:20] [Applause]
[2:02:24] in the messenger token the musician get
[2:02:26] ready the difference between life and
[2:02:29] death was the token and so will it be at
[2:02:31] the coming of the son of god when he
[2:02:33] brings the bride out of the church
[2:02:37] bride out of the church wise out of
[2:02:40] foolish
[2:02:43] wise and foolish to both in church
[2:02:46] and they're coming close to the end and
[2:02:48] uh
[2:02:51] now you listen close this afternoon and
[2:02:53] see if it isn't true the token will be
[2:02:56] the difference there has got to be a
[2:02:58] difference
[2:02:59] so
[2:03:01] they all have lamps they all responded
[2:03:03] they all trimmed their lamps there's got
[2:03:05] to be a difference after all these years
[2:03:07] and notice the difference is not
[2:03:09] doctrine
[2:03:13] the difference is not who he associated
[2:03:15] with who who who come in who who is he
[2:03:17] brother who's his sister who who you're
[2:03:19] connecting to
[2:03:20] if it was that easy then tell me i want
[2:03:23] to connect to
[2:03:26] but my bible doesn't tell me that
[2:03:29] people want the safety of groups
[2:03:32] the safety of knowing that so many
[2:03:35] people doing this activity it must be
[2:03:37] right
[2:03:41] and that has never worked because it's
[2:03:43] an individual affair
[2:03:44] [Music]
[2:03:46] i cannot afford to take the risk of
[2:03:49] basing my walk on anybody
[2:03:54] nobody
[2:03:58] the extra oil the token listen carefully
[2:04:01] in luther's day
[2:04:03] in luther's day the extra oil the token
[2:04:06] was to live out justification
[2:04:08] the just shall live by feet
[2:04:10] so if you were in that
[2:04:13] revelation understanding and not walk of
[2:04:16] the joshua lived by feet that was the
[2:04:18] extra oil of that day
[2:04:20] that was the token of that day
[2:04:24] but i branham taught us it was the same
[2:04:26] holy ghost in every age
[2:04:28] so the revelation of the joshua led by
[2:04:31] fate was the holy ghost of that day
[2:04:36] luther had enough of the holy ghost for
[2:04:39] a message and a revelation of
[2:04:41] justification
[2:04:43] when wesley came
[2:04:45] luther's message was not enough
[2:04:48] it is not that that message was an oil
[2:04:50] or a portion of the spirit but more was
[2:04:52] needed extra was needed
[2:04:54] so when wesley came
[2:04:57] wesley message became the extra there
[2:04:59] were believers who were still saying i'm
[2:05:02] following luther and i'm not with this
[2:05:04] thing that wesley brought
[2:05:05] those who cross over got the extra
[2:05:09] wesley's message became the extra
[2:05:12] as one watch
[2:05:14] faded into another
[2:05:16] those that were all right in luther's
[2:05:19] age
[2:05:20] had to make a choice
[2:05:22] to accept or reject the extra that
[2:05:25] wesley brought
[2:05:26] [Music]
[2:05:27] then the pentecostal scheme
[2:05:30] hallelujah
[2:05:32] then malakai 4 came the token the life
[2:05:35] of jesus christ and as each watch was
[2:05:38] blending into the next watch
[2:05:41] there was a choice to be made
[2:05:43] am i going to live with what i know and
[2:05:45] heard and preached
[2:05:48] because there's a new requirement
[2:05:50] and in our day it's the holy ghost
[2:05:52] itself
[2:05:53] it's the person of jesus christ it's the
[2:05:56] life of jesus christ it's a living fate
[2:05:59] a living virtue a living knowledge
[2:06:01] living temperance living patience living
[2:06:04] godliness living broadly kindness sealed
[2:06:07] by charity that god himself can declare
[2:06:10] there is my spirit flowing freely
[2:06:13] adoption time sons and daughters placed
[2:06:17] into positions when they are born and
[2:06:19] positionally born
[2:06:21] [Applause]
[2:06:25] i'm almost done
[2:06:27] matthew 25 is five and while
[2:06:30] the bridegroom tarried
[2:06:33] he's tarried
[2:06:36] many many many many taught that he would
[2:06:38] have come already
[2:06:41] i remember as a young preacher years ago
[2:06:44] still young but i was very young
[2:06:45] thinking that by now the rapture was
[2:06:48] going to come
[2:06:51] i remember being in school
[2:06:54] thinking surely i'm not going to make it
[2:06:55] to university
[2:06:57] i thought that
[2:06:59] that there's no way i'm going to make
[2:07:00] the university
[2:07:02] i left university how many years ago
[2:07:06] at the sea
[2:07:08] while the bridegroom
[2:07:10] carried they all
[2:07:13] all
[2:07:14] slumbered and slept those words are
[2:07:17] different
[2:07:18] slumber and slept they're two words i'm
[2:07:19] almost done
[2:07:21] while god has been preparing
[2:07:24] during his time of lingering
[2:07:26] this time of sifting
[2:07:28] during these two years of the pandemic
[2:07:30] in particular with people having a
[2:07:33] choice
[2:07:35] of their prayer life and their walk and
[2:07:37] the activities and the things we would
[2:07:40] have done that normally would have
[2:07:41] people a certain way now you've got to
[2:07:43] be more
[2:07:44] intentional about your walk
[2:07:48] and that's all over the world many
[2:07:50] churches some can't open some lock down
[2:07:52] some this and and and it really now is a
[2:07:55] test of do you really want this
[2:07:58] were you in it because your friends were
[2:08:00] in it
[2:08:02] were you in it because everybody came
[2:08:04] together on a sunday and and that jolt
[2:08:06] was enough because the requirement in
[2:08:09] this age is extra
[2:08:11] and to whom much is given much is
[2:08:13] required
[2:08:14] so the exam we are going through no
[2:08:16] other age had to go to this kind of an
[2:08:18] exam in this kind of a way in this
[2:08:21] season when knowledge has increased
[2:08:24] information has increased doubt has
[2:08:27] increased science has increased ideas
[2:08:30] and voices have increased never there
[2:08:32] was an age with so many competing voices
[2:08:36] telling you to do this don't do this
[2:08:37] listen to this person listen to that
[2:08:39] person this is right this is wrong this
[2:08:41] is not right this is the and everywhere
[2:08:43] if you don't listen to the voice of god
[2:08:45] you will go insane
[2:08:48] but yet still there's a bride
[2:08:51] yet still there are people
[2:08:53] who will keep to the word of god
[2:08:56] and they will do all that they can do to
[2:08:58] be ready so that when
[2:09:01] he shows up they are ready to go away
[2:09:04] [Applause]
[2:09:06] i'm almost done
[2:09:07] two words somebody and slept
[2:09:10] sleeping means dead but abandoned
[2:09:12] brought the type that the bride from the
[2:09:14] seven church ages are sleeping
[2:09:18] apart from those that are sleeping so
[2:09:19] those who have gone on before they are
[2:09:21] all asleep
[2:09:24] but there are those that are slumbering
[2:09:27] they are here now slumber means dormant
[2:09:29] inactive like you're dozing
[2:09:32] so you're not a sleeper you're not
[2:09:33] you're not
[2:09:34] you're not asleep you're just there
[2:09:37] dormant inactive
[2:09:42] the living bride slumbering
[2:09:46] in the message
[2:09:49] with all the books on the tapes
[2:09:52] slumbering in the message taking church
[2:09:54] for granted slumbering in the message
[2:09:57] taking conventions for granted this is
[2:09:59] another another meeting
[2:10:01] another service
[2:10:06] no one but abandoned would say the bride
[2:10:09] has not a revival yet
[2:10:10] there's been no revival there no
[2:10:12] manifestation i've got to stir the bride
[2:10:14] yet it'll take those seven unknown
[2:10:16] thunders back there to wake her up
[2:10:19] that'll wake up it's not wake up out of
[2:10:21] sleep as in the sleeping sins but to
[2:10:22] wake her up out of the slumber of
[2:10:25] inactivity the slumber of waiting the
[2:10:28] slumber of the time of lingering all
[2:10:30] these years it looked as if nothing is
[2:10:33] happening all these years you ever heard
[2:10:36] us say the same wake up sleeping giant
[2:10:38] all these years the bright slumbering
[2:10:42] some taking in the words i'm just there
[2:10:44] but there's gonna come something
[2:10:46] waiting for that something wait until
[2:10:48] those seven thunders out of their voices
[2:10:51] to that group who could take the word
[2:10:53] and hand it there it'll slice and cut it
[2:10:55] will gather apply together it'll show
[2:10:58] how to go it'll take those seven
[2:11:00] thunders to wake her up into action
[2:11:05] in other words the manifestation or the
[2:11:08] closing of the gap of behold the
[2:11:10] bridegroom comet will be those seven
[2:11:13] thunders uttering their voices to wake
[2:11:16] this bride up to get ready to leave this
[2:11:19] place and before we leave this place we
[2:11:21] will shut kel down on this earth because
[2:11:25] it will slice and cut you will claim
[2:11:27] your family you claim your children you
[2:11:30] claim your health you claim your joy
[2:11:32] you'll claim your peace
[2:11:37] hallelujah and there'll be a time you'll
[2:11:40] see those sleeping saints again before
[2:11:41] we leave this place oh yes you will see
[2:11:44] those sleeping saints again we go
[2:11:46] leaving this place together hallelujah
[2:11:49] i'm so excited oh hallelujah
[2:11:52] hallelujah
[2:11:53] [Applause]
[2:11:57] matthew 25 verse 6 and at midnight
[2:12:01] there was a crime made
[2:12:03] behold the bridegroom comment go ye out
[2:12:08] to meet him
[2:12:10] in other words at this time friends it's
[2:12:12] not it's not what the pastor is going to
[2:12:14] do
[2:12:16] it's not what the church is doing
[2:12:18] it's not what the convention is doing
[2:12:20] you go out
[2:12:21] [Music]
[2:12:22] to meet him
[2:12:24] you go out to meet the bridegroom
[2:12:30] but just know when you're going out to
[2:12:32] meet him you need your own light
[2:12:37] you can't use my light
[2:12:40] i need my light to meet him
[2:12:44] i need my lamp i need my oil i need my
[2:12:47] fire it's to help me get to him
[2:12:51] it's what he will recognize and it'll
[2:12:53] help me to recognize him
[2:12:55] [Applause]
[2:12:56] i've not been this way before so i need
[2:12:59] light
[2:13:00] so i can see where i'm going
[2:13:02] because he's here and i want to meet him
[2:13:06] anybody with me
[2:13:07] [Applause]
[2:13:10] that cry
[2:13:12] the bridegroom comment would not take
[2:13:14] place in front of the house it'll be
[2:13:16] before the house
[2:13:19] so the bridegroom is passing down the
[2:13:21] road and you're there in the back of the
[2:13:23] house and and
[2:13:24] there there are no street lamps there
[2:13:26] are no lights it's just your light to
[2:13:29] meet him
[2:13:30] if you can find him if you can't see
[2:13:32] where he's passing
[2:13:34] you're going to miss him
[2:13:36] oh hallelujah
[2:13:38] hallelujah
[2:13:41] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[2:13:46] verse seven
[2:13:48] we just go in too quickly then all those
[2:13:50] virgins arose and trim their lamps
[2:13:52] you've heard it preach throughout the
[2:13:53] convention cutting that carbon
[2:13:56] anything extra
[2:13:58] anything slowing you down you have to
[2:14:00] know what slows you down
[2:14:02] what may slow you down may not slow
[2:14:03] brother someone slow down or says the
[2:14:04] swords are down you need to know what's
[2:14:06] slowing you down
[2:14:07] for some people it's not sin it's it's
[2:14:08] sports
[2:14:10] it's playing games on the computer
[2:14:13] for some it is in all kinds of different
[2:14:15] situations but for some it's simple
[2:14:17] things you saw caught him in the news
[2:14:18] you will spend an hour watching cnn but
[2:14:21] you won't spend an hour to pray
[2:14:23] carb on it
[2:14:25] carbon
[2:14:26] it's interfering with your flow
[2:14:28] it's interfering with your state you're
[2:14:30] not worshiping like it should because
[2:14:32] there's carbon
[2:14:34] you have to cut it
[2:14:36] cut it clean don't leave some cut at all
[2:14:38] cut change for numbers of people who who
[2:14:42] affect your flow hallelujah there's a
[2:14:44] flow of the spirit don't let nothing
[2:14:46] affect your flow you want nothing to cut
[2:14:49] it this morning cut it today cut it
[2:14:51] today cut it today purpose in your heart
[2:14:54] is better you have no phone than for
[2:14:56] your flu to be interrupted
[2:14:58] cut family cut friends cut neighbors
[2:15:02] and okay what has to be separated
[2:15:04] trim your lamps
[2:15:06] trim your lamps church trim your lamps
[2:15:08] pride because you need all the light you
[2:15:10] can get what does that carbon do it
[2:15:12] makes your light not shine bright enough
[2:15:17] you need all the light you could get
[2:15:19] because there's cross darkness over here
[2:15:21] gross darkness over the people people
[2:15:24] can't see their way without light
[2:15:26] but there's a promise there shall be
[2:15:28] light in the evening time the pastor
[2:15:30] glory we will surely find
[2:15:33] oh
[2:15:34] hallelujah trim the excess
[2:15:39] but i want to make that distinction
[2:15:40] again both the wise and the foolish
[2:15:43] trim their lamps
[2:15:50] then all the virgin rose and trim the
[2:15:52] alarms read it
[2:15:56] their people in the message
[2:15:59] they wouldn't spit on the sidewalk but
[2:16:01] the man spoke about it
[2:16:05] but there's no fire
[2:16:07] but there's no oil
[2:16:10] perfectly trimmed
[2:16:13] they have mastered the art of trimming
[2:16:16] sit in church dead
[2:16:20] no fire
[2:16:22] no oil
[2:16:23] having a
[2:16:24] form of godliness
[2:16:27] but denying the power
[2:16:30] oh god don't let me get like that
[2:16:33] because that creates a self-righteous
[2:16:35] spirit
[2:16:36] of what you're not doing and what you
[2:16:38] don't do and what is she doing sister so
[2:16:40] and so nobody can look at anybody
[2:16:45] because there are three things that make
[2:16:47] this work
[2:16:48] you need the fire
[2:16:49] you need it trim
[2:16:51] and you need the oil
[2:16:57] if those three things are not operating
[2:17:00] effectively
[2:17:01] you don't know if you're going to make
[2:17:03] it
[2:17:04] you need to be on fire
[2:17:07] you need to be trimmed
[2:17:09] and you need to have extra oil
[2:17:12] mat 225 25 was it i'm whining now
[2:17:15] and the foolish senator wise give us of
[2:17:18] your oil
[2:17:19] for our lambs
[2:17:21] are gone out
[2:17:23] so after the trimming
[2:17:25] and the burning accelerated all of a
[2:17:28] sudden the foolish recognized wait a
[2:17:30] minute
[2:17:32] wait a minute
[2:17:34] my light just went out
[2:17:36] are waiting all this time for this
[2:17:39] wedding
[2:17:40] are waiting all this time to go to the
[2:17:42] rapture
[2:17:44] and i'm out of light
[2:17:47] my light has gone out
[2:17:50] what a position to be in
[2:17:52] in the message 40 years
[2:17:54] 30 years
[2:17:55] 25 years
[2:17:56] [Music]
[2:17:58] one taken one left that's what this is
[2:18:00] you know
[2:18:01] because god is not the respecter of
[2:18:03] tenure how long you in church how long
[2:18:05] in the message
[2:18:07] light going out and the fool is said to
[2:18:11] have give us of your oil for our lambs
[2:18:14] are going out
[2:18:18] but the wise answer saying not so
[2:18:21] i can't do it
[2:18:23] it is not that i don't love you
[2:18:26] it is not that
[2:18:27] i don't want to see you succeed
[2:18:30] it is not that i don't i want to see
[2:18:32] your feel
[2:18:34] it is not because i have a problem with
[2:18:36] you
[2:18:40] and the wise give a reason
[2:18:43] the only reason i can't give you is
[2:18:46] because i'm concerned
[2:18:47] that i forgive you
[2:18:50] i'm also not going to make it
[2:18:54] lest there be not enough for us and you
[2:19:01] but go he rather to them that sell
[2:19:04] and buy for yourselves
[2:19:06] in other words go check and see if
[2:19:08] there's still if you can still get
[2:19:11] i don't know go try to get
[2:19:13] what i have is enough of me
[2:19:15] for me and my house we want to serve the
[2:19:17] lord i've been doing all my best
[2:19:19] to make sure so me and my house we could
[2:19:21] serve the lord
[2:19:22] [Music]
[2:19:23] i want to help you i really want to help
[2:19:25] you
[2:19:26] but you have to go for yourself to get
[2:19:28] yours
[2:19:30] friends there's grace today
[2:19:32] to still go because the call the call is
[2:19:35] here but there's still a little time to
[2:19:38] go get it before it's too late
[2:19:41] oh god you could be gonna pay something
[2:19:42] softly very very softly
[2:19:46] friends
[2:19:47] the painful thing here
[2:19:49] it is not that these foolish
[2:19:54] didn't want to make it
[2:19:56] they had the best of intentions
[2:19:58] [Music]
[2:20:01] the bible said in first
[2:20:03] 10
[2:20:04] while they went to buy
[2:20:07] friends
[2:20:09] they went to fix the problem
[2:20:14] they went to pray when they should have
[2:20:16] prayed
[2:20:18] they went to make things right when they
[2:20:20] should have meetings right
[2:20:22] they went to cry out for god
[2:20:28] [Music]
[2:20:30] at a different time a different place
[2:20:31] that is perfectly all right
[2:20:34] but in this case in verse 10 it was just
[2:20:38] a little too late
[2:20:39] [Music]
[2:20:41] friends in life
[2:20:43] there is such a thing as a little too
[2:20:45] late
[2:20:46] [Music]
[2:20:47] it affects your life it affects your
[2:20:49] business it affects your health
[2:20:52] it affects every area of your life if
[2:20:54] you don't take action
[2:20:56] fast enough you could reach that point
[2:20:59] where
[2:21:00] the very best effort is just too late
[2:21:03] there are people who take chances with
[2:21:05] their health
[2:21:07] and when they decide to make a choice to
[2:21:08] change
[2:21:09] so much damage was done
[2:21:12] unless there's a miracle it's a little
[2:21:14] too late
[2:21:15] because it takes a process
[2:21:17] to reach that way
[2:21:18] [Music]
[2:21:20] clearly
[2:21:22] during the time that is not recorded
[2:21:24] here in scripture the wise was doing
[2:21:26] something differently
[2:21:29] because they were all aware about
[2:21:31] getting ready
[2:21:34] so i don't know what the foolish was
[2:21:35] doing all the years when they were
[2:21:37] coming to church
[2:21:38] but i do know the wise was doing
[2:21:40] something different
[2:21:43] the wise was doing something more
[2:21:46] [Music]
[2:21:47] are you willing to do more
[2:21:49] are you willing to do extra to get extra
[2:21:52] are you willing to give more to get more
[2:21:54] are you willing to pay the sacrifice
[2:21:56] because the bible says go to them that
[2:21:59] sell in other words you have to pay the
[2:22:02] price
[2:22:04] it's going to cost you something
[2:22:06] you can't give all your time to the
[2:22:08] world and expect god to give you extra
[2:22:11] oil
[2:22:12] [Music]
[2:22:14] you can't live any way you want to and
[2:22:16] expect god to bless you
[2:22:19] are you willing to pay the price are you
[2:22:22] willing to sacrifice are you willing to
[2:22:24] break friendships for this great pool
[2:22:27] this perl of great price are you able to
[2:22:29] sell all you have to buy this extra oil
[2:22:32] are you willing to sigh and cry are you
[2:22:35] willing to give it up i want to throw
[2:22:37] away that worldly clothes that worldly
[2:22:39] music are you willing to give up your
[2:22:41] social media nonsense are you willing to
[2:22:44] give up the lust of the eyes the lust of
[2:22:46] the flesh the pride of life
[2:22:51] are you willing to give up your
[2:22:52] self-righteousness
[2:22:53] i want to give up the odds and the
[2:22:55] grudges and the blame games there's a
[2:22:57] price
[2:22:58] it costs to keep these things it costs
[2:23:01] to give it up
[2:23:02] go to them that sell
[2:23:05] and buy pay the price pay the price pay
[2:23:08] the price
[2:23:10] and while they went to buy
[2:23:12] friends it's scary because they had it
[2:23:14] in their heart they wanted to make
[2:23:16] things right
[2:23:17] they wanted to make things right
[2:23:21] and while they are doing it
[2:23:24] it reminds me of the message do not
[2:23:26] cross the line but abraham said he saw
[2:23:28] them at the altar crying out for
[2:23:31] salvation but they had already crossed
[2:23:33] the line it was too late
[2:23:37] no matter what they cried it was too
[2:23:39] late
[2:23:40] no matter what they asked for it was too
[2:23:42] late and here it was
[2:23:43] while they went to buy the bridegroom
[2:23:46] kim
[2:23:46] [Music]
[2:23:49] and this is my title
[2:23:51] and they that were ready
[2:23:53] went in with him
[2:23:55] oh god help me i want to be ready
[2:23:59] i need to be ready
[2:24:01] i need to be ready lord i need to be
[2:24:03] ready
[2:24:05] lord i love my brother i love my sister
[2:24:08] but lord i don't want to take chances
[2:24:09] with me
[2:24:10] i don't want to take chances with me
[2:24:12] lord
[2:24:13] oh hallelujah i don't care about the
[2:24:15] doctrine i don't care i just want to be
[2:24:17] ready because that's the only thing that
[2:24:19] matters day that we're ready went in
[2:24:23] lord i don't want nothing hold me back
[2:24:25] from going in
[2:24:26] i don't want to be wondering if i'm if i
[2:24:28] could go in lord i want to be ready
[2:24:32] i don't want to wonder if i'm ready i
[2:24:34] want to know that i know that i know
[2:24:37] that i'm ready
[2:24:39] i've done everything i could do my tank
[2:24:42] is full
[2:24:43] my house is full
[2:24:45] my vessel is full
[2:24:47] my life is full i've emptied out myself
[2:24:50] i've checked myself i've examined myself
[2:24:54] i've searched myself oh god i don't want
[2:24:57] to take chances i'm locked up in my room
[2:25:00] but lord i want to be ready
[2:25:04] and wild
[2:25:06] they went to buy
[2:25:08] the bridegroom came
[2:25:10] he arrived
[2:25:11] and he's not waiting
[2:25:13] he's not waiting
[2:25:15] he is not waiting
[2:25:17] it's either you're ready or you're not
[2:25:18] ready you've got to be ready or you're
[2:25:20] not ready he is not waiting
[2:25:27] they that were ready
[2:25:30] went with him
[2:25:32] to the marriage
[2:25:34] and the door was shut
[2:25:36] the door was shut
[2:25:39] no more mercy
[2:25:41] no more grace the time for grace over
[2:25:44] just like noah's day the door is shut
[2:25:47] [Music]
[2:25:50] god shut the door friends if i could
[2:25:53] open it back i will but i can't
[2:25:55] god shut the door in noah's day when the
[2:25:58] door was shut no i couldn't do nothing
[2:26:00] about it
[2:26:02] friends
[2:26:02] [Music]
[2:26:04] where are you at where are you at church
[2:26:08] where are you at husband where are you
[2:26:10] at wife where are you at deacon elder
[2:26:13] minister brother sister
[2:26:15] [Music]
[2:26:18] don't be caught outside
[2:26:21] don't be caught outside
[2:26:24] verse 11
[2:26:25] even more painful
[2:26:27] afterward
[2:26:29] came also the other virgins
[2:26:32] saying lord
[2:26:34] lord open to us
[2:26:37] friends this is scary
[2:26:39] to knock
[2:26:41] and the door is not going to be opened
[2:26:44] lord lord open up to us
[2:26:48] the bible says knock and the door will
[2:26:50] be opened
[2:26:52] seek and you shall find
[2:26:55] the bible says in isaiah 55 seek ye the
[2:26:57] lord while while he might be found for
[2:27:01] years we have known that there'll be a
[2:27:02] time limit on your ability to find god
[2:27:08] because judgment is set
[2:27:10] the arrow has been released and nothing
[2:27:13] can stop it you have to outrun the arrow
[2:27:16] you have to outrun the arrow you have to
[2:27:18] outrun the hounds of judgment that god
[2:27:21] has loosed he has held back the four
[2:27:23] winds good nights
[2:27:28] judgment
[2:27:30] that will begin in the sanctuary at the
[2:27:33] ancient men who have sat in the house
[2:27:36] for years
[2:27:38] but the door is being shut
[2:27:40] only those that are ready
[2:27:42] this puts the foolishness to the ground
[2:27:45] this puts issues to the ground this puts
[2:27:48] playing games to the ground this puts
[2:27:51] oats and grudges under your feet
[2:27:54] kill it today
[2:27:57] so we could enter in
[2:27:59] [Music]
[2:28:00] afterward came also the other emergency
[2:28:02] and lord lord opened to us
[2:28:05] but the lord himself answered
[2:28:07] they hadn't heard from it for a long
[2:28:09] time but he answered it said verily i
[2:28:11] say unto you i know you not
[2:28:14] i don't recognize you i don't know who
[2:28:17] you are
[2:28:18] hallelujah because i could only
[2:28:20] recognize the token
[2:28:22] i could only recognize the blood i could
[2:28:24] only recognize my person i could only
[2:28:27] eyes
[2:28:29] [Music]
[2:28:31] and the last verse
[2:28:33] i'm finished
[2:28:35] watch therefore
[2:28:36] watch therefore we are watching
[2:28:39] we are watching
[2:28:41] for you know neither the day
[2:28:43] nor the hour where the son of man coming
[2:28:46] in other words you got to get ready and
[2:28:48] you got to stay ready you got to get
[2:28:50] ready and you got to stay ready you
