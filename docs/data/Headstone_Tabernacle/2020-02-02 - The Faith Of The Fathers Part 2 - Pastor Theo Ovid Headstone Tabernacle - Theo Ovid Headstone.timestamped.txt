[48:08] your word Torah hearts in Jesus and we
[48:10] ask it email and God bless you
[48:14] you must be seated this morning of a
[48:21] title the feet of the fathers part 2 and
[48:25] it so happened that we preached on this
[48:27] at January 19th that was like part 1 but
[48:30] it is part 2
[48:32] and the subject was the fee that was
[48:34] once delivered to the Saints and the his
[48:37] mission was just going to be a unity of
[48:39] the feet we had contact scripture from
[48:42] Ephesians 4 Jude 1 on religion 10 okay
[48:47] so you ready for the word this morning
[48:48] all right
[48:50] know when you come to church you not
[48:53] coming to find out how good you are or
[48:55] great you are how powerful you are ho
[48:57] mighty you are come the church to find
[48:59] out your faults your weakness it comes
[49:02] to to find out about you what you don't
[49:05] know about you that the word can discern
[49:07] you and reveal you expose you help you
[49:14] strengthen you pull you out so you come
[49:17] not to look at other people you come to
[49:19] get to hear from God
[49:20] yes because when you get empowered then
[49:23] you could help others he's none right
[49:25] all right so let's continue this is
[49:29] Barbara if you notice in Revelation 13
[49:33] when the United States come up is the
[49:37] only beast in the Bible that come up and
[49:40] did not come out of the waters
[49:43] the Bible says come up out of the earth
[49:45] where there are no people's that was
[49:49] this new kingdom and it looked like a
[49:53] lamb and after a while it spoke like a
[49:57] dragon that is this country it's got to
[50:01] happen
[50:02] there's an echo here it's got to happen
[50:04] someday they will make a mistake and
[50:08] elect the wrong guy they will raise up a
[50:12] Joseph of a pharaoh that doesn't know
[50:16] Joseph they tried it before and they
[50:20] will do it again if they feel this time
[50:23] which the time he was in it will finally
[50:26] come the Bible said so and I am NOT a
[50:31] politician both sides and I'm a crooked
[50:32] I'm casting my vote on Jesus Christ he's
[50:36] the one I'm interested in but I tell you
[50:38] you better wipe your glasses off no if
[50:41] you expect any freedom for your children
[50:43] I don't know how close it is so this is
[50:46] the direct prophecy that some day
[50:49] America would elect the wrong guy a fear
[50:53] that no no Joseph
[50:54] any time Joseph as freedom of religion
[50:57] because America was founded on that but
[51:00] that is going to change he is praying
[51:05] Grint law that something will be set
[51:08] tonight or done that will cause the we
[51:11] were to turn to Christ for we believe
[51:14] and feel pressed in the spirit that
[51:16] greed judgments are upon these lands in
[51:19] the last days plagues disease germs
[51:22] already bred up to be scattered
[51:25] throughout the nations no doctor nor
[51:27] even how to take a whole of it
[51:29] Oh God will have to believe in divine
[51:33] healing then when nations are breeding
[51:37] germs together the bosom and bombs and
[51:40] millions dying hours over it but we are
[51:42] thankful that when the destroying angels
[51:45] went for you said touch none of these
[51:48] that had the seal of the Father upon
[51:51] their forehead for their mine and we are
[51:55] so glad tonight to be under the blood
[51:56] safely protected as Israel in the days
[51:59] of old put in the blood and the lintel
[52:01] of the door upon the doorpost sign of
[52:04] the Cross when the danger was sweeping
[52:06] the land that dark wings bow down but
[52:08] when you see the blood is rose again
[52:10] I'll pass over you on just one more
[52:13] thing he said what is cancer is a
[52:14] disease we debated for a few extra
[52:16] minutes what is cancer what caused that
[52:18] thing let's take cancer or anything you
[52:21] wish to take tubercle or pneumonia or
[52:23] whatever you wish any disease diseases
[52:24] are germs
[52:25] let me pass something and quickly as our
[52:28] time is going to listen did you know the
[52:30] Bible predicts that in the last days
[52:31] that there'll be germ warfare that
[52:34] diseases will break out upon the people
[52:36] and will fall on everyone with all the
[52:38] baptism of the Holy Spirit but with the
[52:41] angel or who are charged over these
[52:43] plagues was given orders to touch not
[52:46] one upon wound amok ones
[52:49] why how much kind of teachers have we
[52:54] got to be bredrin to get the church in
[52:57] order in that condition to be immune my
[53:02] arms are saw no where the doctors have
[53:05] punched needles in to try to inoculate
[53:07] me from yellow fever I told him I didn't
[53:10] need it but they wouldn't listen to me
[53:12] but I tell you what's going to do God's
[53:16] got a serum it's called the Holy Ghost
[53:19] and when that serum goes in it will
[53:22] inoculate plea all glory to God
[53:27] hallelujah so this morning I come for
[53:29] inoculation against all the diseases and
[53:33] pestilence and please not going to come
[53:36] upon the earth because mango Quan could
[53:39] wouldn't be able to stop it all praise
[53:41] be to Jesus he said our bodies need food
[53:44] and drink each day to survive a physical
[53:48] body if we don't eat take food each day
[53:50] and drink our body weakness and there is
[53:53] something in us that we must have food
[53:54] on one day food will not last for the
[53:57] next day you've got to have food each
[53:59] day to strengthen your mortal being you
[54:02] can live over but you get weaker on the
[54:05] second day you're weaker and the today
[54:07] your Chipman this week well well well
[54:09] that's what many times that we do in the
[54:11] spiritual realm you see each day we have
[54:15] got to commune with Christ we have got
[54:18] to talk to him each day we have got to
[54:20] settle it with him each day Paul said I
[54:23] die daily each day I die yes I live not
[54:26] me but Christ lives in me so if your
[54:29] physical body needs food each day and
[54:31] drink each day to survive your spiritual
[54:33] body needs spiritual food and communion
[54:36] with the Lord
[54:37] each dish to survive hallelujah yes
[54:40] Jesus said man shall live i bread alone
[54:42] but by every word I push you down to the
[54:44] Mount of God so each day we've got to
[54:46] study the Bible
[54:47] some people study it because up every
[54:50] two three times a year but a real
[54:51] believer that is really spiritual built
[54:55] up he reads his Bible every day and
[54:57] talks to the Lord that's right he has to
[54:59] I think I want to read that part again a
[55:03] real believer that is really spiritually
[55:06] built up he reads his Bible every day
[55:08] and talks to the Lord that's right he
[55:10] has to just as you look at what's up
[55:13] every day just look at your phone every
[55:14] day look up text every day look at the
[55:16] messages every day you have to read a
[55:17] Bible every day Oh glory that God has a
[55:20] spiritually built up amen and we have
[55:22] enough power all of this coming Saturday
[55:24] Oprah 506 right here that crowd unto the
[55:28] Lord not another thing that we take food
[55:31] for is to build up our body to resist
[55:33] diseases if you don't take food and let
[55:36] your body get weak then it is subject to
[55:38] diseases diseases will break into your
[55:41] bloodstream and you're gone if your
[55:43] blood is enriched and pure then disease
[55:45] will go right into your bloodstream so
[55:47] you got to eat nourishing food to keep
[55:51] her bloodstream right if you don't you

[1:06:38] before God go back to Israel you have to
[1:06:41] seal a bright and alert call the elect

[1:09:15] have the company inside because I can't
[1:09:18] legislate this order that's why we can't
[1:09:20] beat the people in legalism into
[1:09:22] righteousness it has to be internal
[1:09:28] [Music]
[1:09:31] so Jesus went so far and tell them the
[1:09:34] kingdom is within you but outside of you
[1:09:38] in you have to come in you
[1:09:40] oh my hallelujah
[1:09:45] but ugly something struck me people
[1:09:48] talking about when the press come now
[1:09:49] which is Dylan and Byron said I feel the
[1:09:54] tipple moving within me I feel the
[1:09:58] prefect but for everybody
[1:10:00] Oh the minute it will have to be in you
[1:10:03] oh oh that's a big one that's a big one
[1:10:07] mean the tip will have to be in you or
[1:10:10] glory to God hallelujah praise God press
[1:10:14] coming you know oh yes it'll be a
[1:10:17] squeeze it'll be a tightening tightening
[1:10:19] you know slowly but the grip is
[1:10:22] tightening its tightening until you're
[1:10:23] almost pressed out Oh glory to God then
[1:10:26] what happened to Daniel in Alliance then
[1:10:28] when the chat antenna rely on he said
[1:10:31] the hidden power that was in Daniel came
[1:10:34] from inside Oh
[1:10:35] [Music]
[1:10:43] if the ideas did not deserve in power he
[1:10:46] make a good lion million on the lion was
[1:10:52] on the easy minnow but because he had
[1:10:58] hidden power and it came out when he
[1:11:02] needed it the power he had on the inside
[1:11:09] Kamath on the outside and the lion could
[1:11:12] raw but it could meet him they could
[1:11:15] walk along and break a touch him and
[1:11:17] that's what I'm talking about you will
[1:11:20] have protection inside and I wrong
[1:11:22] because he angels a lot and camp around
[1:11:25] those glory of God a believer you may be
[1:11:32] seated
[1:11:33] so you think can say something the Bible
[1:11:36] said the Bible said there's coming a
[1:11:40] time when men will rot right in their
[1:11:42] flesh and the buzzards will eat of
[1:11:44] carcasses before they even die cancer is
[1:11:48] a to take to what's coming but remember
[1:11:50] that horrible thing was forbidden in
[1:11:52] that day to touch those who had the seal
[1:11:54] of God and that is what we are striving
[1:11:56] for - to get in watch one - to get in
[1:12:02] and be positionally placed before the
[1:12:06] kingdom of God into the kingdom of God
[1:12:08] before these over strike so it
[1:12:11] come in but they're gonna strike but
[1:12:13] before I strike he said we are striving
[1:12:15] to enter enter the kingdom of God let me
[1:12:18] put this onto you let every trial and
[1:12:20] every test push you
[1:12:22] into the kingdom let every situation
[1:12:25] push you use it as wing to your wings
[1:12:30] let the tires make your flight let the
[1:12:34] testing raise you higher not push your
[1:12:37] dog because the Eagle have the ability
[1:12:40] to use the wind to soar higher so when
[1:12:44] the storms come in the eaters happy
[1:12:46] because the even though these strong
[1:12:48] will take them higher or buried or
[1:12:51] caught them little birds and then
[1:12:52] sparrows have to go under but either spy
[1:12:54] higher so you could saw where the Eagles
[1:12:57] go come on now you are not chickens you
[1:13:01] are Eagles user trials as wing as wind
[1:13:05] to the wings that God has given you or
[1:13:08] praise God amen you may be seated
[1:13:12] so we find out the original Church the
[1:13:15] true church is Max and Max sixteen an
[1:13:17] action it's the scripture that we read
[1:13:20] coming to life coming into action and he
[1:13:24] said Jesus said go into all the world
[1:13:26] and preach the gospel to every creature
[1:13:27] then he meant to go into all the world
[1:13:30] and demonstrate the power of God to
[1:13:33] every creature
[1:13:34] so all these mysteries and histories and
[1:13:37] revelations and testimonies for the past
[1:13:39] 50 years have to be converted into the
[1:13:42] power of God that is demonstrable to the
[1:13:46] entire world let me say today we turn
[1:13:50] God for the time of the revelation of
[1:13:54] these things being did known we turn God
[1:13:57] for all the mechanics and revelations
[1:13:59] and teachings and doctrines and all
[1:14:01] these things but there comes an hour
[1:14:03] when the gospel must be preached and God
[1:14:07] have an interpretation of the gospel
[1:14:09] being preached that is not my
[1:14:11] interpretation that is Klotz
[1:14:12] interpretation the gospel being preached
[1:14:15] is not given or Trax is that given all
[1:14:17] teams it's not telling people what's in
[1:14:19] a prophet that not the gospel being
[1:14:20] preached because were being preached
[1:14:22] that does the playing tape playing hey
[1:14:24] mister cover being preached that is
[1:14:26] playin tape we are not here to play
[1:14:28] tapes we are here to preach the gospel
[1:14:30] that's a commission from Jesus Christ
[1:14:33] not from some man in Jacksonville or New
[1:14:35] York or America or Europe or anywhere
[1:14:38] else this is from Jesse's will this is
[1:14:41] from the Bible Jesus Christ go into all
[1:14:43] over land do what preach the gospel to
[1:14:46] every creature
[1:14:47] don't any bull at all don't any bees at
[1:14:51] all every creeping thing that creepeth
[1:14:53] upon the earth reach the never
[1:14:54] how could you preach to the bully every
[1:14:58] creature how could you when you've got
[1:15:00] what mystery you're gonna preach to the
[1:15:01] world you may be seated
[1:15:03] let's go back that over again the
[1:15:05] Prophet was passenger feel the pray for
[1:15:07] somebody that is sick he forgotten that
[1:15:09] feeling uh killable killable the ball
[1:15:13] hard reputation and tag and everything
[1:15:15] else on him that's what he is he forget
[1:15:18] that he had a gun he forgot the gun and
[1:15:20] walked into the field here come to kill
[1:15:22] a bug he thought he was gonna have this
[1:15:24] just stand up there and something came
[1:15:25] over him he said well I'm a servant of
[1:15:28] God and I've a bull coming the bull
[1:15:31] coming he's getting up you got enough he
[1:15:32] said going like back down because you
[1:15:34] know and the bush creatures breaks to
[1:15:38] the wrong light on and he passed normal
[1:15:40] normal listen to what he said listen
[1:15:43] what he said you think if he had a gun
[1:15:45] he was gonna shoot the bull and pay for
[1:15:47] the bull but God allowed it you see what
[1:15:50] brothers are loud sometimes goddess
[1:15:52] protect you from you
[1:15:56] God wanted to manifest something higher
[1:15:59] more than a letter or glory we will do
[1:16:03] the same thing suitable and differ table
[1:16:05] you may be seated
[1:16:06] but something came over him he said was
[1:16:09] the love of God but I say I say is what
[1:16:12] Adam had in the Garden of Eden the feet
[1:16:16] that Adam had was manifested when courts
[1:16:20] they have power over creature over the
[1:16:22] animal over every creeping thing and he
[1:16:24] casts a bull go and lie down I'm a
[1:16:25] servant of God passion to hear to prefer
[1:16:28] some sick person and the bull went and
[1:16:30] laid on because if there was the master
[1:16:32] speaking it was the master preaching it
[1:16:34] was the same voice that Adam had back
[1:16:36] there it was the fate it was evidence it
[1:16:42] was restored so what we presented a
[1:16:44] event coming it has been here it is here
[1:16:47] it has been restored
[1:16:49] Malachi's our center restore the faith
[1:16:51] it has been restored or glory their core
[1:16:55] knowledge will be restored to you or
[1:16:58] give the Lord a shout but that's it is
[1:17:01] on the earth right now
[1:17:02] it had to be here if the devil is an
[1:17:05] irritant what is on the earth
[1:17:07] if hell is an ear they'll have nothing
[1:17:09] and if the devil easily let the sons of
[1:17:12] God on the earth also
[1:17:17] Loreena God God is always one step ahead
[1:17:20] of your problems of your situation of
[1:17:24] your condition you got to want the mind
[1:17:27] of God for your situation but he's
[1:17:29] always one step ahead do you believe
[1:17:34] that so so when he so wait so when he
[1:17:43] said going early will and preach the
[1:17:44] gospel yes we could preach nice long
[1:17:46] messages and nice mystery messages and
[1:17:49] well well fit together messages but the
[1:17:51] real things that he meant is the
[1:17:54] demonstrate the power of God to every
[1:17:56] creature
[1:17:57] now in order to preach the gospel before
[1:18:01] you can make it a gospel preached you
[1:18:04] have got to have the power and the
[1:18:07] demonstration of the Holy Spirit
[1:18:09] to prove the gospel now some people
[1:18:12] asked what abandoned by man will receive
[1:18:13] the bathroom Holy Ghost shall we ask God
[1:18:15] for gifts he said I'm become a stuff
[1:18:18] he said don't ask what for no gifts
[1:18:21] you know was he trying to tell him you
[1:18:23] have to grow in God now
[1:18:26] is there usually signs and wonders
[1:18:28] demonstrate you an adult in Christ so
[1:18:31] now was he put the power to a level of
[1:18:33] maturity that God's a proof of by
[1:18:36] character not by age by by so hear me
[1:18:46] off time say quarters are adopting the
[1:18:48] sermon he's a defender man he's
[1:18:52] interested in a man more than the sermon
[1:18:53] because the man makes the sermon the
[1:18:56] Sermon flows through the man
[1:18:59] man is who called C's not the Sigma not
[1:19:03] the message sweating some people like
[1:19:05] the past I know we we're ready 'cimmanon
[1:19:08] lee soo-man elisa.landi nobody could
[1:19:09] preach like him and whatever it is
[1:19:11] there's only - level and that's why Paul
[1:19:14] said this way I came to you not with
[1:19:16] enticing words of man's wisdom I come to
[1:19:20] you with the power and the demonstration
[1:19:23] of the spirit that your faith with rest
[1:19:25] not in me with my intellect and my
[1:19:27] knowledge and my information and
[1:19:29] revelations but might that your fate my
[1:19:31] rest and the power of God because you
[1:19:34] know man can't do that when you begin to
[1:19:36] see the power of God you know is the
[1:19:38] power of God man can't do that
[1:19:39] it's the power of God are you with me
[1:19:42] so watch in order to preach you can make
[1:19:45] it a gospel preach then you have got to
[1:19:47] have the power and the demonstration of
[1:19:49] the Holy Spirit to prove the gospel they
[1:19:51] let the kill it but the Spirit make it
[1:19:53] the life so it's not a ritualistic
[1:19:54] affair it's absolutely a real living
[1:19:58] reality of the resurrection of Jesus
[1:20:01] Christ
[1:20:01] living among men and that's the faith
[1:20:04] that I am trying my best constant for
[1:20:08] today
[1:20:10] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:20:12] today forever and this power is
[1:20:14] unlimited
[1:20:16] so top unlimited or glory that was shot
[1:20:19] again unlimited that means that power
[1:20:22] could do anything it could bring missing
[1:20:28] limbs back and restore it it could
[1:20:35] dissolve the cancer it can dissolve your
[1:20:37] tumor it could heal your eye it can heal
[1:20:40] your air he can heal your tongue it can
[1:20:42] heal your spirit it could heal your body
[1:20:44] it could heal your soul because his
[1:20:46] power is unlimited
[1:20:48] [Applause]
[1:20:53] so cor trying to power the church into
[1:20:57] unlimited power
[1:21:00] I think about animated poor think about
[1:21:07] five loaves and two fishes and Jesus
[1:21:11] could take that and said just bless
[1:21:13] let me bless it just take that he said
[1:21:14] what you have five thousand people to
[1:21:16] feed the five loaves and two fishes with
[1:21:18] unlimited power he taketh he blessed him
[1:21:21] power he said share it all he had looked
[1:21:25] the same as multiplying it multiply yet
[1:21:26] it multiplied yet multiply yet it wasn't
[1:21:30] like that you know he brick had blessed
[1:21:32] vision shared under brick and shale and
[1:21:35] brick and share and break I'll share the
[1:21:37] didn't realize was a miracle
[1:21:38] there was just breaking and sharing
[1:21:39] Britain and sharing Rick and Sharon they
[1:21:41] didn't recognize the past ten people yet
[1:21:43] and there was still Britain assured when
[1:21:45] they passed 200 people they were still
[1:21:46] breaking and sharing they still go
[1:21:47] realized if it was breaking and sharing
[1:21:49] as your break it you can charity break
[1:21:51] it they could share it unlimited power
[1:21:53] could break and share break and share
[1:21:56] not breath and keep break and share
[1:21:58] could imagine they say pass the bread
[1:22:01] alone and you break internal server and
[1:22:03] break it out of break at hand break and
[1:22:06] as it gets into brick as you hand it as
[1:22:09] it get such a break it you pass it on
[1:22:11] and everybody one by one they get
[1:22:14] baskets of remnants afterwards this is a
[1:22:16] miracle it's a miracle or Chloe the can
[1:22:21] explain that I don't know what you're

[1:22:28] you a miracle Oh glory to God we believe
[1:22:32] that hallelujah hallelujah glory

[1:22:42] believed is the word of God
[1:22:44] and that is true in one sense but the
[1:22:47] Word of God is not the gospel alone

[1:33:10] God in the beginning was the word the
[1:33:13] Word was with God and the wood was gone
[1:33:14] so watch the teeth a word is the
[1:33:17] expression of thought because a word is
[1:33:19] a total Express right it has to be a
[1:33:21] thought before it could be a word so
[1:33:23] Gordon it beginning give the thought of
[1:33:24] what would be spoken by a wood to make
[1:33:27] it what is for and we see we see we see
[1:33:29] the word and it produces what God
[1:33:32] thought was the word is the gospel in C
[1:33:35] form
[1:33:37] don't ever forget that see it after me

[1:33:59] hand a battery to tumble at engine that
[1:34:01] engine nut will just start until you get
[1:34:03] the right kind of power has retained the
[1:34:05] dynamics of the Holy Ghost could we give
[1:34:07] the Lord a shout not some man coming
[1:34:09] from somewhere to pitch a certain
[1:34:11] message that is that the power we're
[1:34:13] looking for oh don't call me that
[1:34:15] don't worry look at the Lord I so don't
[1:34:17] go there over there don't go there Oh
[1:34:20] give the Lord a shout now if we take the
[1:34:24] power of the Holy Ghost to connect with
[1:34:26] what's inside of you
[1:34:27] then you become a pulse or coactivator
[1:34:31] by God and the devil can't do nothing

[1:35:59] portraiture you do not fit in what is
[1:36:02] gospel is
[1:36:05] oh my mmm
[1:36:08] let's continue is that yattaman
[1:36:13] these days he cuttin the backdrop of
[1:36:15] what I wanna preach let's continue God
[1:36:18] it's powerless religion
[1:36:24] I kind of mentioned as well
[1:36:29] this was kid intellectual pictures a
[1:36:32] second ative
[1:36:34] god he's powerless religion it's got to
[1:36:40] have power in it
[1:36:41] it's got to have listeners with
[1:36:43] sincerity ELISA this big one sincerity
[1:36:47] brings power
[1:36:53] [Applause]
[1:36:55] you see you see if I so season you
[1:37:00] against other churches or ministers and
[1:37:03] to show me a positive to you and
[1:37:06] everybody that's negative I am NOT
[1:37:08] sincere and your feet will be up of
[1:37:12] witted feet your feet will be resting on
[1:37:15] me instead of the word and you'll be
[1:37:18] deceived
[1:37:19] see if I try to set you up against this
[1:37:24] one on that one you will have the wrong
[1:37:26] pictures and in your spirit will be
[1:37:29] conquer them and when you meet people
[1:37:32] other churches your spirit wouldn't be
[1:37:34] right
[1:37:34] you will smile and skin your teeth but
[1:37:37] won't be sincere because you will see
[1:37:39] them as off or shocked or this or that
[1:37:41] and see them cuckoo but you love your
[1:37:44] choices to do that because if you
[1:37:46] receive Christ the word you give
[1:37:48] everybody to grow and mature and change
[1:37:50] in their own scenario because this is
[1:37:53] not the only church and inside this
[1:37:55] place you have three kind of people
[1:37:57] treat kind I believe it true believers
[1:37:59] make believers unbelievers rightness are
[1:38:00] displeased I know that because the
[1:38:03] Prophet said that every Guardian have
[1:38:05] that they not just make a point I'm
[1:38:07] making a point
[1:38:08] no you have to believe as a true
[1:38:09] believer you want to have the right
[1:38:11] spirit the right attitude the right
[1:38:14] motive the right objective so you have
[1:38:16] to get a source of strength by how you
[1:38:19] operate and that source of strength will
[1:38:21] be motivation must be love you'll love
[1:38:24] to come to church you love the Brethren
[1:38:26] you love the world
[1:38:27] you'll love the cause you'll love to
[1:38:30] Silve the scenes you're in love with God
[1:38:33] whether you give you I don't give you
[1:38:34] you still tank and many all they're not
[1:38:36] effects with them you're not angry with
[1:38:38] them you with silver Murray catalyst
[1:38:40] that becomes a motivating force you
[1:38:43] willing to depress you willing to go the
[1:38:45] extra mile then or go not just for your
[1:38:48] family but for anybody or glory to God
[1:38:51] hallelujah you're willing to push you're
[1:38:53] willing to be strong you will attend
[1:38:55] courage one another
[1:38:57] oh boy look at the description a charity
[1:38:59] charity suffereth long and is kind is
[1:39:02] not puffed up it's not easily performed
[1:39:05] believe in all things rejoice and up in
[1:39:08] iniquity but rejoices in the truth
[1:39:09] somebody falling back side over he fall
[1:39:11] I like it happy because you stand in
[1:39:14] what kind of it is done like terrible
[1:39:17] you can't live like that say see the
[1:39:21] things we say and do have us reaction in
[1:39:23] or quality of if you have questions or
[1:39:27] wouldn't have fit I suppose that I don't
[1:39:29] know why you see in that boy he sell for
[1:39:31] me like somebody said oh my god fight
[1:39:32] like I say most of them I destroy some
[1:39:34] people you know me I will talk to you by
[1:39:36] yourself you know i eyeball two eyeballs
[1:39:38] were talking to i'd like the true things
[1:39:41] and hoping the person who supposedly get
[1:39:43] Ajani when i talk to you direct and
[1:39:45] really getting it because i tell you
[1:39:47] so either usually put with the traverse
[1:39:49] or nobody I use the pulpit to preach the
[1:39:51] wind not from fusion you recognize the
[1:39:54] no confusion i back an island I want on
[1:39:57] Saturday I have none doing that you know
[1:39:58] I have to do with the vision of the word
[1:40:01] I know this is first this is primary I
[1:40:03] want to keep the main thing the main
[1:40:05] thing that's what we're here for to keep
[1:40:07] the main thing the main thing
[1:40:09] Oakland and the main thing is your
[1:40:11] message or glory there but I do or you
[1:40:14] run like that money run and say what a
[1:40:16] message you don't forget me message
[1:40:17] again boy
[1:40:19] remember it has some story long time a
[1:40:21] family story yes I have to see
[1:40:22] something's very cave to open a man who
[1:40:25] are unforgettable
[1:40:26] see you can run it with all the
[1:40:28] messaging when you run the other polar
[1:40:30] this is the King's message get out of my
[1:40:32] way or I'll have the King's message get
[1:40:35] out huh man win open every devil help at
[1:40:38] the Kings message get outta my way
[1:40:39] then you becomes the King message when
[1:40:42] the devil see you you get out of the way
[1:40:44] or give the Lord a shout and you and a
[1:40:46] message as one you and the message the
[1:40:49] same you become the King's message or
[1:40:52] glory they're gone sincerity brings
[1:40:54] power so remember what the Prophet was
[1:40:58] told you have been given power to bind a
[1:41:01] member not will be given you are being
[1:41:04] given power the binder Mamba the Mamba
[1:41:07] wasn't affecting him the mama was
[1:41:09] affected bredrin going after brethren
[1:41:12] testing them to kill them and yet he
[1:41:14] says be more sincere now it means that
[1:41:17] God saw something in the Prophet that
[1:41:19] man couldn't see and he himself didn't
[1:41:21] know so gorko tell him be more sincere
[1:41:25] so he went and fast for three days and
[1:41:28] people mocked him so why did well for he
[1:41:30] said because God say be more sensitive
[1:41:32] so he said you have to clean it out he
[1:41:34] said he believed in purgatory
[1:41:35] you're fast at all your Priya told you
[1:41:37] get it home he said your purchase soul
[1:41:39] here you can expect somebody to put your
[1:41:42] soul yes I could give you a new dress a
[1:41:44] new shooter whatever it is but but your
[1:41:47] soul only God could push that and you
[1:41:50] have to be able to lay before God and
[1:41:51] say God take it out your husband can see
[1:41:53] it your wife cast here yeah cheering
[1:41:55] casting it the neighbor can see it your
[1:41:56] boss casting it but God sees a new sneer
[1:41:58] and you have to ask for take it out
[1:42:01] rinse it out push it out get it out
[1:42:04] [Applause]
[1:42:06] and when you begin to do that then your
[1:42:08] worship becomes sincere your prayer
[1:42:10] becomes sincere then power becomes real
[1:42:13] over you and around you some believe
[1:42:19] people believe every dream they have is
[1:42:21] some God every Jimmy have is not some
[1:42:22] good something because they eat some
[1:42:24] corn and some things with egg is some
[1:42:26] dream
[1:42:29] some boiled corn or who is going to eat
[1:42:33] was a corn its soup Toledo some things
[1:42:35] are limited some kind of dream some
[1:42:38] dream or for the soup your sweater God
[1:42:42] had gotten ISM the goal is really
[1:42:43] nothing just this just fell asleep in no
[1:42:47] man's land
[1:42:48] just file it on a site so yeah because
[1:42:54] they cut the Bible gasps scripted fields
[1:42:56] go talking to them they plain Baptists
[1:42:58] are yeah Baptists duelist I wasn't about
[1:42:59] to so I don't know I get back I just got
[1:43:01] fiber right you wanna reform up a
[1:43:04] pyramid over that's what I saw
[1:43:06] did no longer Baptist cotton bye
[1:43:09] everyone getting scripted content by the
[1:43:11] cuckoo when you cut them and put it on
[1:43:13] your hand rest and read and interpret
[1:43:18] curriculum material that interpreter
[1:43:20] would have mean they were a feat that
[1:43:22] means one joining some sister Patricia
[1:43:26] another Bible and just about idols are
[1:43:28] coming to me we haven't judges I know
[1:43:31] them message we play Marcus either we
[1:43:34] should stop it

[1:43:39] she no longer yeah she gone
[1:43:41] oh my so good so sincerity brings power
[1:43:46] sincerity brings real worship okay not
[1:43:53] forms but genuine power ship to know you
[1:43:56] have passed from death unto life cord
[1:43:58] wants the perform his word by his power
[1:44:01] and the final part a cup of this little
[1:44:04] part we have you know listeners that
[1:44:05] noted elected God is calling to the
[1:44:07] elected didn't know it
[1:44:09] Paulin the virtuous bride the word the
[1:44:11] lasted Church the elected leader of
[1:44:12] Allah Jesus Christ Jesus a word how many
[1:44:14] believe that all right then the bride
[1:44:16] there we go
[1:44:17] is always part of the bridegroom so the
[1:44:19] brain will not be a denomination it will

[1:49:51] God John was commissioned to write and
[1:49:54] when the seven thunders the voices I was
[1:49:55] about to write I heard a voice remember
[1:49:57] sinner to me seal up those things which
[1:49:59] is seven thunders uttered and write them
[1:50:01] not oh that's what we don't know that's
[1:50:04] yet to be revealed or glory to God and
[1:50:06] the angel which I saw stand upon the sea
[1:50:08] and swear time shall be no more isn't
[1:50:11] that right in the days of the voice of
[1:50:14] the seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:50:16] sound the mystery of God shall be
[1:50:18] finished as he hath declared to the

[1:50:23] this seven sealed book will be revealed
[1:50:25] at the xiangyan of the seven churches
[1:50:27] message then the seven is a big in the

[1:50:47] the book of the mystery of God is not
[1:50:50] revealed until the seven angels messages
[1:50:53] sounded now these points are important

[1:51:14] probe that and the mysteries come down
[1:51:17] from God as as the Word of God and
[1:51:20] reveals the entire revelation of God so
[1:51:22] that tap with mystery mystery mystery
[1:51:24] like is so mysterious the machines come
[1:51:25] down as the word so the word is preached

[2:31:01] full son having the full seed German him
[2:31:05] he had all seven virtues in him he had

[2:39:04] message it's the capstone what did it do
[2:39:07] listen thought we describe it it is the
[2:39:10] capstone what did it do the Holy Spirit
[2:39:13] cut of the individual and sealed it when
[2:39:19] we add it to our faith righteousness and
[2:39:21] godliness and faith and so forth can add
[2:39:23] him till he got seven things so what
[2:39:26] he's talking about this pyramid here
[2:39:27] he's talking with identified all these
[2:39:30] virtues here right
[2:39:31] he says seven things and the seventh one
[2:39:33] was love so to fail you add in seven
[2:39:37] things and his seventh one is love all
[2:39:41] right
[2:39:41] that's how God makes the individual caps
[2:39:45] him and seals him with the Holy Spirit
[2:39:48] so the Holy Spirit is from the bottom to
[2:39:51] the top
[2:39:52] not if you have it on top the family
[2:39:54] button the Holy Spirit Hemme is on the
[2:39:57] bottom to the top all these things
[2:40:01] consist of the Holy Spirit that must be
[2:40:04] in the individual and he went on to say
[2:40:06] in detail you could have leaks in your
[2:40:09] building
[2:40:09] leak in virtue or leakin temperance and
[2:40:12] weaken this so charity comes to seal the
[2:40:15] building that there be no more leaks
[2:40:18] leak in the brotherly kindness say find
[2:40:21] yourself forgiving this one that one
[2:40:23] this one I have a issue with that one
[2:40:24] no when it's sealed you become a sealed
[2:40:26] unit there was no leaks in your life you
[2:40:31] are sealed inside and sealed outside in
[2:40:33] the Reich no here is partying if that be
[2:40:36] so this person that have these some
[2:40:39] things in them that person has got seven
[2:40:41] Church ages that he had seven mysteries
[2:40:44] that be someone in a way and they fought

[2:40:48] comes to cap off the church does the
[2:40:50] tund and thunders mean that my bedroom
[2:40:52] and every man is that answer the
[2:40:55] question is that a yes or no does the
[2:40:58] term doesn't mean that that insider you
[2:41:00] have seven voices seven mysteries seven
[2:41:04] messages seven virtues seven voices Oh

[2:42:00] interviewing people with the power upon
[2:42:01] him he had determined to go back in the
[2:42:03] life and pick up the things that they
[2:42:05] need to know and tell him like it is and
[2:42:07] freedom it was the power of what present
