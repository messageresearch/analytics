pleased by having the right frame of mind towards the life that he give us many people don't have this opportunity but you have fathers here may God bless you and may God be with you to give you the opportunity to bring guidance to your children and as the father our heavenly father that straighten out his sons you are you wouldn't be doing the writing if you don't straighten out your own sons and your own children because that's what God does see so so we have to reflect him that's what we so greetings from the LCA London I was out to services in Miami and then afterwards had to make the trip to London to go to the funeral of Pastor Peter Chandler it was as if things was pre-arranged for me to be there I was invited to speak on Wednesday night this is Wednesday past service and um and I believe that you'll be blessed with that service we can have that this morning the funeral service was outstanding over 50 pastors was there from around the world and more would have been there had it been uh not for Visa issues I know some of you here may not have seen it so what I want to do this morning is to take an extract from it and we want to go over into the Wednesday service that I preach across there by God's grace the message that I preached there was cemented by love the bride because the prophet said there'll be no love left among except among the bride we are in treacherous time right now and I sure you might have known that Putin has brought some warships down to the Caribbean right right right by Cuba 90 miles from the shore of America to show his strength and force this is not going to slow down you know T going to build up and I think that um the pressures that will come around would make some of you shake from your little petty um cockroach um ANS trials that you have and you'd realize there's some bigger things to deal with and you know it come like somebody complain they have no shoes and they stop complaining when they saw somebody with no feet it come like things are very very relative to your own experience as we see a a pipe dripping in your house d emergency we fire catch in the kitchen there's a different story you could lay back on the bed and say click click trip trip drip drip the Trap is just dripping but the fire bur fire burning that's not working you know as Star as you might be You' fly out that bed and jump out and do something about that fire because fire is fire you lose everything so sometimes just how the pressures of Life come that deals with us and I I was amazed by what I saw on the strength of the family and I pray that God bless them and keep praying for them s Monica but I think that the extract that you would see today would give you a clear picture of Life of life stories you see a man come here but a Peter and see him preach but you don't know his history you don't know his story you get an opportunity to see that this morning so brother Nicholas we're going to go straight in it right now by the grace of God so God bless you and enjoy and be blessed with it he's a saint that has gone home to be with the Lord as she said it correctly she said it is the closest thing to being raptured because the doctor said to him that he is four years younger than his own buddy he had no issues had heart issues no issue whatsoever and she felt like he was just taken up his body fell to the ground he was just taken up friends this is not the only World Peter was 71 years old but Peter was 71 years old was an old man and so on but God knows there are people God will relief from what coming upon the earth that is why you have to be special if you who are alive and remain you have to be special you have to be qualified to be here because of what is coming that's why I trying encourage you to be buly to be strong stop complaining stop be weaky weaky and you you know your fyy like you had Mo and P Water no no no you can't be like that in this house you got to be strong get all the pacifier and all them Pampers thing you got to get out of that you got to be strong like a man that'll face the challenges stop this weaky weak whining complaining and always complaining and nothing I working on stop

a much better place we celebrate the legacy of his life you may be seated thank you thank you brother Nathaniel for that wonderful song Thank You congregation for joining in and now it's an honor for me to ask the daughter sister sanche to come forward to read a poem sister s thank you owed to a candle in this city a humble candle was placed molded by God redeemed by God's grace but the times were dark and sin was Surplus but a candle lit in daylight has no purpose he thought life would continue on the path that he rode on but God's vessels don't choose him no they are chosen God set him a light in the spiritual night to shine bright against darkness and fight the the good fight he beamed God's word to the grown Olden youth a holy illumination of the spirit of Truth and that flame sparked in London bringing light to the locals soon spread through the nation International then Global how far that little candle beams did reach because he preached what he lived and he lived what he preached this candle he burned to give others God's light sacrificing all for his calling to Christ whilst working in church one spring afternoon his soul was blown away in a moment too sudden too soon dark clouds above cast an honor Gloom the Earth shook beneath us though the ground did not move tears fell like rain our eyes blurred with mist but in the center of Darkness Godlike persists in that moment when darkness was anticipated the hearts of the Brethren illuminated the candle took flight to eternal light but his per purpose was not here to stand and shine bright God used him to set Christian hearts a light and from this god-given flame did 10,000 ignite though his light never dimmed as he passed on God's Flame the word spread like wildfire again and again thousands of candles were lit from that one now his work is complete but your works just begun his light still Shines on in another dimension but we who remain are that light's life extension we are Heirs of his mission our way has been shown this church that he's founded was built with strong Stones there is no deflection we have our direction we are a projection of God's light reflection just as that can CLE was to you and me be the light that helps other people to see fear not the darkness stay in line for without Darkness light cannot shine darkness is only the absence of light the darker the times makes God's light shine more bright let love be The Guiding Light in all you do shine bright beam far glow righteous burn true brothers and sisters every boy and girl take up your candle and light up the [Music] world shall we put our hands together first the phone reading from the daughter Sansa the light of a candle in the darkness we thank God I'd like now to call upon our precious Reverend Theo ovit from head hstone Tabernacle in Trinidad he will come and give his tribute on behalf of all the ministers can we put our hands together for our Reverend [Applause] again I'd wish to express our condolences to Sister Monica the family and the church without a question Pastor Peter's impact on the message landscape was staggering so many pastors ministers shared their Ministry with the local Christian Assembly London likewise he was willing to share his ministry with others he had a unique style in presenting this glorious gospel it was different because he was different this distinction made him genuinely authentic and original I believe he had a genuine revelation of this message which reflected in his attitude and way of life but Peter was a humble Soul he understood the sovereignity of the local church he stood as a Watchman in the tower and stood guard against the power of the nians and other contrary Spirits which sought to undermine and destroy the church that God has placed under his care his precious wife s Monica succinctly stated they saw everyone that walked into the church because she was his first convert the enemy tried and failed but the Peter stood his grounds a Man Who Loved God loved God's people loved the cause I call him the man they could not break despite knowing that his welcome at convention meetings was often half-hearted he continued to attend he was truly the man they could not break never arrogant Hy or indifferent he conquered in humility a man of few words he had a way of disarming you with his infectious smile and embracing you with his warmth through his love and kindness he Triumph what stood out most to me was that I never heard him speak an evil word about anyone the man they could not break has now broken free from the judgments of man and is in the father's presence he has finished his course and he kept the Fate I feel blessed to have known him to have been associated with him and to have stood by him I salute him as a real Christian and a true servant of God he has left a legacy of sacrifice devotion and dedication to the cause of the Gospel May the comforter God strengthen and guide you all I could see when you arrive at Heaven's portal the angel said welcome home our lost here of brother Peter's passing is heaven gain in the land of perfect love an eagle has landed he will be missed by all of us God bless you all praise the Lord amen appreciate the tribute amen can we clap our hands again for Reverend F over from hstone Tabernacle near that experience that made me realize that there is a God I was miraculously saved from drowning and after such an experience I began to search for salvation and I started to read my Bible I read from Genesis to Revelation when I got into Revelation I struggled to grasp the meaning I cried tears of confusion trying to make sense of what I was reading during that time a religious track was put through my door it convicted me so much that I visited a little Pentecostal group that gathered near my home I invited the leader and sister to come to my house and have a meal because I wanted him to explain the Book of Revelation to me when he turned up he came with the sister and a young Caucasian man from Zimbabwe straight away I was annoyed I was prejudice against him and I showed it I was angry with the group leader for inviting him to come without my permission so I refused to invite him to my my table and offer him any food that I cooked I was fuming anyhow I gave him a cup of tea and a slice of angel cake and I thought that was good enough for him my sister Marva felt so bad for this visitor eating cake while we ate our rice and peas and she rebuked me she told me if I'm going to be a Christian I need to put that racism behind me I was not happy but she forced me to offer him some of my food and he enjoyed it sometime after that I visited the Pentecostal group again they asked me to give my testimony I shared with them my near-death experience when I nearly drowned in the sea in Greece after the meeting the same guy that I treated so badly at my house came to talk to me he wanted to know more about my experience he shared that he also had a clo shave with death that had led him to search for Christ I told him I found that Pentecostal group when a track was put through my letter box I found out that it was him that put it through my door during his Outreach and that was before we even met that's when he told me his name Peter Peter Chandler he asked me me if I could help him with his Outreach to be a shoper room because people often ask him to come into their home and pray with them this is how we started spreading the message in South London Peter was from a star middle class family in Zimbabwe they did not practice Christianity when he came to London he met a West Indian man by the name of of Albert lamant who witnessed to him he asked him are you saved Peter felt challenged by this question and so convicted by this witness he gave his heart to the Lord and got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ after that he started to attend a Pentecostal church he later met a brother in the Pentecostal Church who lent him a book book The Seven seal by Brother William branam around the same time he received this book Peter's life took a devastating turn he was involved in a horrific explosion leaving him with severe burns that confined him to hospital he read the Seven Seals while lying in his hospital bed and then bang a spiritual explosion happened an explosion of not just Divine Healing but one that forever changed his life by the time he's finished reading he was completely healed with not a scar left on him Peter wrote to brother Billy Paul at voice of God recording requesting books he was so supportive of this young evangelist who wanted to spread the message he sent him a box of message books the book books and tape they diligently supplied helped Peter to establish the message in London he felt a deep calling to tell the Pentecostal that God has send us a prophet he faced a lot of resentment and opposition for it when I heard the message I knew it was nothing but the truth and I supported Peter in his Zeal to spread the word but I was my husband's first convert that's how we started it was Pete me and 62 Empty Chairs he was the song leader the musician he played the piano the guitar the accordion he was the Deacon the Usher the preacher we printed our own tracks and handed them all over South London God started to bless our little effort my sister Verona was a second convert followed by my other sisters Marva and Shirley then sister Gwen and brother Terry who later married and then Lawson who married my sister Marva we outreached all over London we would set up in Speaker's Corner in hide Park and in SoHo the West End of London was a regular spot where Peter preached he declared that God has send us a prop and told the people about the coming of the Lord the Pentecostal they called us branhamites they laugh us we book Halls to show The Prophet's film H you know I'm waiting for something that is true it's the angel of the Lord that's true I'm just as helpless as it could be just like any the rest of you and I'm here perhaps with critics sitting here how many ever seen his picture note of my meetings to seem where the scientific taken his picture of here a Holy Spirit now in the name of Jesus Christ the son of God I take every person in here under my control for God's glory your name is uh Eva yeah and your last name is y and you live in this city yes and your house number is 6136 street is that right you're going home to be well in the name of Jesus Christ go and be but you do believe me and besides the reason that you do believe me you are a minister of the Gospel yourself and you're here for a good cause you're not sick you're in need and you want an oldfashioned Revival to break in your community praise the Lord that's what you're bring praise the Lord every one of us wants that let's all stand for an oldfashioned Revival almighty God who created heavens and earth I ask now that every demon power in this building will be broken the power of Jes Jesus Christ be made manifest Lord we but we're not defeated Satan iure thee in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ when Peter preached on the street we were mocked and Echo people through hot charcoal at us from the roasted Chestnut drums despite the challenges Peter's faith never wavered people came and asked for prayers some even made confession S one man even made a confession of murder he got away with it but when Peter preached he got very convicted and confessed as message Believers in London we were very isolated brother Billy Paul put us in touch with Brother Andy strevens he was the first message believer we met in the UK the Lord provided faithful and supportive men in England and later in Europe to encourage Peter in the service of the Lord I know Peter would want me to thank them as I supported Peter's vision it became my vision too his purpose became my purpose when he asked me to marry him all I could think of I didn't want to lose my friend I didn't realize how deeply I'd fallen in love with him and I said yes we were married in less than a year Peter was a spiritual Pioneer LED and guided by a Divine intelligence he labored to spread the message and bring as many Souls as he could to Christ not just in London he led the way boldly into Africa with his missionary and his charity work when other Western ministers were hesitant he once provided boats for believers to cross a dangerous river to get to church a brother later wrote to thank him for those boats as they saved lives when a war broke out the Believers used them to escape his missionary work led him to minister in many parts of the world the LCA Church grew and so did our family we had had three children Abigail Sania and Gabriel the families in the church grew also and so did the Sunday School Every Soul was precious to Peter he was passionate about keeping youth off the street he put together a youth program with Christian activities the faithful and talented Timothy King shared his vision the youth enacted produ ctions he put together gain Global attention people from all over the world came to attend LCA youth Retreats Ash Burham kwood all screen and currently gilwell Park it's been a privilege to see those children grow into young men and women of God having their own children some of the young people we knew as kids have become pastors as Peter preached the word little LCA that began with me and him and the empty chair expanded and that's when we move here to our present church building many churches has sprung from this little church that began with just me and him Peter faced many challenges but none like the pandemic he had an unfailing sense of service he fulfill every obligation he undertook if he said he was going to do something he did it he worked in the church on the church and for the church so when the lockdown came and churches all over the world was forbidden to congregate the Lord inspired Peter with an idea and now I'm going to break protocol and call another name that helped the pastor to bring the word to the people and that is our precious brother Emmanuel he caught the pastor's vision and agreed to assist him the LCA live streaming enabled Peter to Pastor his entire congregation Sunday school teachers were able to teach their classes remotely from the cres 0 to 3 Alpha Omega Omega plus Sunday school class when youth Retreats were banned because of social distancing Peter invented the youth and air where he organized overseas ministers to speak to the youth it was a big success and a great encouragement to the young people at such a dark and unpredictable time during the lockdown Peter used the time to refurbish the church he he installed air conditioning and ventilation unit he studied the government guideline and put everything in place for when the people could return to church there was nothing he couldn't fix or make he cemented a 100 foot path in our backyard by himself he loved the challenge and if he didn't know how he taught himself he was an engineer son he used every kind of tool he worked with wood metal brick or cement if the item he needed wasn't in the shop he makes it himself I have furnitures in my house that he built older than my children and they're as solid as the day he built them he built his first motorbike at the age of 17 he didn't mind getting his hands dirty for the last 3 years most of his time was spent working on the church building every Wednesday he would go to church early to work on the next project and that is how his last day started out it was just a typical Wednesday we left the house early he drove 40 miles from our home in Kent to take me to my sister's house in London he left us there because he was going to meet a photographer who was going to take pictures of the church building before he left to go to church he Pat me on my shoulder and said see you later those were his last words to me and you know the rest well the events of that day still feel unreal even now but there is something I didn't share before because I couldn't find the word to describe it the atmosphere I felt when the police officer allowed me to come into the building it was a great and fearful ush it was frightening my husband was there lying lifeless on the floor but the atmosphere around was so reverent it was like a unseen presiding being that demanded reverence at the time I thought I must have been imagining it but when I observed the action of the police officers I knew that they must have felt that present too they were respectful and spoke softly I know police officers are trained to do their job in a respectful manner but this was more than that from the way they conducted themselves I know that they were conscious of this Majestic presence too I looked at my husband's face and I saw rest it was so calm the coroner took him away with great care and not like it was another day's work my daughter and I both noticed the police officer standing in the lobby had tears in his eyes he has never met my husband but yet he shed tears like the brothers and the sisters standing on the pavement outside of the church the singing and praying outside the church it was so moving it echoed the presence I was feeling inside the church I felt the love from the Believers outside I felt so honored to be identified with them Peter would have been so proud of LCA the departure of my husband in my estimation is the closest thing I can see of being raptured he was Fit and Well he didn't even have so much as a headache that day he was just taken up God is a reality one to be feared and Obey you can't argue with God if there was one scripture that captur the man Peter Chandler was it would be first Peter 5: 2-4 feed the flock of God which is among you taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly not for filthy Luca but of a ready mind neither is being Lords over God's Heritage but being examples to the flock and when the chief sheer shall appear ye shall receive a Crown of Glory that fadeth not away it is perhaps the description of a gracious servant but that's what he was he had acquired dignity his strength did not come from his position it came from his humility and obedience to the word everywhere he preached whether at home or abroad are on the broadcast he never used that platform to speak about himself he repeated what the prophet spoke that Pulpit is older than my children and many of the ministers that are standing behind it it has stood there longer than many of our church members I have witness so many people give their hearts to Christ at the base of that Pulpit if that Pulpit had a voice it could tell you the history of our church for brother Peter it was a sacred desk let us not forget the great example left by him he was an innovator an extremely learned man he study at the highest levels but he used his life to serve the Son of God came into this world as a servant not as a master like a Pioneer and Beacon he pressed forward for God beating a path for others to follow he said he was not afraid of dying he knew he was going to Glory when I told him to slow down or take a break he would tell me let me live dine that was one of his phrases he demonstrated the virtues he preached he lived his values you know he never missed a Sunday in church or family never had family holidays he did not take holidays he had perfect attendance the day after he had a kidney stone removed he was at church at his post of Duty he preached through B's py he took care of himself so that he could take care of his father's business his heart beat for Christ no matter how busy things got he always make time for the people he cared about in both his family and his spiritual family everyone who knew him knows how proud he was of the people he loved of his children their families and his grandchildren we his natural family feel is absent deeply but we are consoled by his spiritual family the LCA family is well trained in conduct order and Doctrine and we are following an excellent example his legacy is love unconditional love there's been countless tributes expressing affection and respect I tried to respond to all of them but there were just so many I want to take this opportunity to thank those wellwishers for their uplifting and encouraging words on behalf of myself and the entire Chandler family I want to thank all of those who have supported Peter in so many different ways bringing him coffees and peppers and little goodies the beautiful drawings from the children to all the officers that worked with him and the Believers of LCA God bless you when I was 24 I started preaching this message we started originally in 1976 in a very small way and a very sort of humble way just in a uh a little labor hall had prayer there I feel very privileged to be in the message of this hour and when I look and realize the immensity of the message the validity of the message and the Vindication of the message I feel very privileged to be called and to know exactly where I'm standing to the Believers around the world that might be watching this I would say take courage as Joshua said be very courageous because this message Can't Fail uh because the message itself is indicating and the message is um as the word says that it shall not return void it might be somebody watching this video that is discouraged or um feeling like leaving I would say to them don't do it stay with the word it shall bring forth what it said it would and it's like a seed a seed that is planted will possess the gates of the enemy don't doubt it will come to pass [Applause] [Music] let's all stand let's

abided faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is Charity you may be seated praise God so tonight I have a title cemented by love the bride Hallelujah that's the title of the message cemented by love the bride amen have ANP Iration Faith which works by love that's the inspiration faith that works by love have a context scripture Galatians 5:6 and it says for in Jesus Christ neither circumcision ath anything nor uncircumcision but Faith which worketh by love so that is where I get the inspiration from faith that worketh by love and we know that seven T give Fai we know the prophet came to turn our hearts back to the feet of the fathers but that fate that he sent us to get connected with it must work by love praise the name of the Lord hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord so this is the prophet he was praying Heavenly Father we approaching that Divine Holiness in the name of Jesus and we pray that we will as we receive I'm going to skip through so those who I'm going to just be skipping right so he said uh we pray Lord that you'll receive our Thanksgiving first to begin with as we are issuing it out tonight in this service issuing it out and giving praise studying Thy Word and knowing what thus say the Lord mean how many things could we put down on a paper to be thankful for the little narrow escapes that we have had this year where Satan would

might have more cap off the permid of Our Lives Lord put the Capstone Christ Jesus upon each and every one of us and that is our desire as we near this headstone as we near the coming of the Lord that our lives be capped oh praise the name of the Lord so it's not good enough just to be in church we want our lives to be caed and to get our lives capped Peter tell us the how to get it capped which is to add to our faith virtue and to knowledge and Temperance and so on oh praise the name of the Lord hallah Oh Glory to God so when Solomon was building the Temple he got stones from every different place every different country he's not right and there was no song that they could hear in this Stones coming through and when they start the building he said they found a stone a funny looking Stone oh praise the name of the Lord a fun looking Stone it didn't look like the rest of the stone it was a hole missing and they couldn't just understand what is missing from that that hole there isn't that right and he find out that it was the Cornerstone amen it was the Capstone it was The Headstone it was a missing Stone and he said I don't care how much Miracles you can perform how many prophets you have how many works of Grace you do it will never meet or never do anything of the Church of the Living God until the Church of the Living God is melted together and cemented by love somewhere along the way it has to have the cement of love to seal the Church of the Living God where brother Peter entered into is the land of perfect love the prophet wife said you have to have Divine love to enter inside of here he said when they come to the UK you need a UK Visa you go to America you need American visa to go to that land you need the Divine love that's the visa to go there not arming the message not what you believe not what you think you got to have a passport you got to get a visa and that Visa is divine love we have to strive Brethren oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah so that is why the prophet prayed take out all the bitterness take out all the Envy take out all the jealousy because we have to be able to work in harmony praise God you kind of bitterness and envy Oh Glory to God hallelujah charity suffering long and is kind charity is not puffed up Charity is not easily provoke it Bear all things it believeth all things it enjo all things char never fath Oh Glory to God you are going to be Anointed with the love of God you going to be Anointed with the charity of God God promis it we are here to expect it we are here to anoint it we are here to claim it oh give the Lord some Praises somewhere on the earth love will come down into the building and take all the evil out somewhere on the earth oh give the Lord a shout hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh praise the Lord hallelujah hallelujah brother BR says the Capstone was rejected and as we grow from Lutheran age Baptist age Methodist age Pentecostal age we are right up to the capping Stone now waiting for the capping Stone to set down and the building is complete Hallelujah now okay let's go did you know in your behavior in the way you act that you represent the entire body of Christ each individual sir represents the entire Christian Nation each individual what a burden yes sir you say I'm a Le member that doesn't matter when you take on the name of Christian yes sir you represent Christ and his church you should live like that that's right you should live like gentlemen like ladies don't never do the things of the world because the whole Eyes Of Heaven and Earth is cast on you to represent that one thing no matter how weak you are how little you are hold your head right because you are a Christian and the testimony of Peter's children was we always knew where Daddy was because he said so yes sir you see this is not the only world we think this sometimes this is it we fight to live and we live to die we fight to get things only to find out a man life is not consist of the things he possess it after fighting for things after fighting for power and P and position and what value is [Music] thisall let's continue now when God became flesh and dwell among us hallelujah when he found a woman in adultery he said I don't condemn you that's right go and sin no more when he found his sick he acted just the way he would have to act for he was God he healed the sick he raised the dead he forgiv the sins and no matter how he was how many how back he forgive them anyhow if they were willing to come and ask now notice if God acted any one time in a certain circumstance and if that same circumstance arise again he's got to act the second time like he did the first time or he's unjust so no matter how bad you are in sin how stupid you have become he's got to act to you like he did to that Fallen woman or he acted wrong here we go this the part I want to get to God's behavior is his [Music] person did you get that yes sir God's behavior is his person and what he is in his behavior declares his [Applause] person so if you want to know if it is God what somebody's Behavior because your behavior reveals who you [Applause] are Glory I feel inspired God's behavior is this person and you know in this age of you have to have identification that's whether passport whether is driving license you have to have and the ID when you ask about the ID is who are you not what you do so much no but your identity as to who you are right when the angel asks Jacob who are you he said I'm I'm a crook he was genuine I'm a thief I just trick people and they the angel say aha now I know you know who you are I could change you Jacob wasn't a hypocrite Jacob was genuine Hallelujah I need Deliverance I need a breakthrough I have bitterness I have this I have that help me Jesus and once you ready to see what's in you because you supposed to know you and even if you don't know you the word come to show who you are Oh Glory to God because when the word

Jesus demonstrated that when they called one acted adultery it was on Facebook it was T everybody was talking about it exactly that a picture it was was everybody knew about it she stood there and all Jesus did is say uh which one of you without sin what he was doing addressing the heart issues oh yeah the eyes were seeing everybody have the knowledge of what she did but they didn't have the heart

Destiny by getting rid of him I don't want to hear about these dreams I don't want to hear about these prophecies I don't hear one about these Visions get rid of Joseph they got rid of Joseph but they couldn't cancel the prophecy they could get rid of you but they cannot cancel the prophecy over your life I am saying to you tonight there's a prophecy over your life that the Devil Himself cannot cancel God can't take back Amen brother Hulu Hallelujah God himself can't take back just hanging over you like it hang over Mary oh give the Lord some [Applause] Praises Hallelujah Mary didn't know she was the one until the angel say hail Mary that highly favored she didn't know she was the one but she was always the one not sister this and sister that Mary her name was in that book When God said a virgin shall conceive it was specifically Mary not Mary sister or Mary cousin it was Mary and I'm saying it is you okay the Lord sh Praises oh is you tonight hallelujah it's about you you tonight he said this same coat God work out and said look what Luther Wesley Pentecost then he said the Capstone yes so Joseph Perfection is the Capstone the cap the pyramid that's right that's it Luther Wesley Pentecost to Perfection he said Luther Wesley Pentecost the Capstone Glory so brother brandham brought the Capstone yes sir this is the Capstone message that's right this is he brought the magnet then to take us home yes sir rapturing faith is leading the message the power is in the books power is in the prophecy right oh glory to God let me see if I can finish off here now [Music] hallelujah thank you Lord that hallu now the church and the word has to be one like Jesus and God was one cor it was in Christ reconcil the word himself so will Christ have to be in the church the anointing of the word to make everything fulfilled yes and that's the Capstone that comes upon the last age that's right not the lisan talk about the bright age so you are called out aoud this here into this Holy Spirit slot into the bride age that the Capstone could come down note note after brotherly kindness in the pyramid is Holy Spirit that's right and have the love right so you have to be called out into that atmosphere there what is not calling you and making you in the church ages is calling you out into a spirit atmosphere that's right that the Holy Spirit can come down because God cannot come down and dry no that why they were worshiping The Upper Room when you're dead God can't come down and that the worst thing to pray for is a person that dead at the altar Hallelujah you're praying for them Hallelujah Glory when somebody pressing Lord Jesus and they're praying and you're praying with them there's an atmosphere that is there that's right but if you pray for somebody that stone dead at the altar you get dead too they will kill you so the Holy Spirit needs an atmosphere so in the upper room they will worshiping Hallelujah Glory Glory Glory so it create an atmosphere like how the prophet say you got to do something for something happen he take a rock and thr it up in here and when it come down start to bring us and then a whirlwind start off judgment striking West Coast yes sir you got to do something sir something happen we do we are doing something tonight we are putting in something consider love the cement of Love That Will cement the bride and will cement you and you will see why you must be cemented that's right Bible call it the charity the bond of perfectness he said because with all these virtues there could be leaks leaks in Temperance leaks imp patience you have it and then something gu so good Lord make it trip you almost and it just leak out but when charity the P of perfectness come and seal the whole building no more Le you are powered on the inside you are poome oh give the Lord some shouts that is God desire for the end time not for you to be weak not for you to be struggling our pictures have to change Hallelujah I know some of you see some of you might going to be seen you know my son sent me a clip of a guy who was talking about a guy who um and he he who encouraged her to write the SAT and he got a score of 1440 or something like that out of, 1600 no know what have here when he came home and he tell his mother he got 1440 but I say you cheat you cannot get that and he said Mommy I did not cheat I did the exam and they give me 1440 so then he started tell himself suppose I'm bright because he know he wasn't so bright he said but suppose I'm bright and he begin to have bright friends and talk to them and go to college and then later on life he could become very successful success businessman 10 years later the S people sent him a letter and told him because he said since he got that results his life changed because he recognized he could be bright and you know he's changed his life and so on 10 years later they sent him and tell him they made an error they sent it to the wrong people and his store was 743 it's too late right right his mind already changed and put him on a different trajectory so that half score that didn't qualify him that he that that his mind already changed and when your mind change you can't unchange [Applause] it if your mind can change T night no devil can change it [Applause] back so Victory starts here be transformed by the renewing of your mind if you think you could do it you could do it if you think you could break out you could break out if you think it could be transformed you can be transformed Oh Glory to I can prove to you the anointing is not only for the preacher Give the Lord I shout in you can take this back home with you oh give the Lord a shout you can take this back with you almost done W [Music] Hallelujah I almost done skip a lot things all right see brother bam they ask brother Bram how can you believe these things the way you do and still go to the Assemblies of God Oneness all the rest he said brotherly kindness amen hoping someday amen patience with them that's right temperance that's right and drawing with them knowledge to understand what he believes corre and to know it's in his heart yes sir virtue in yourself to let it go up with kindness meekness to him having faith that someday God will bring him inen that's right Hallelujah so he was showing that these virtues is being exercised in sight of him if God didn't give him the experience of the people carrying on in the church and of the woman that he condemned because this ending of the story he went to the woman and said woman I was just condemning you and the Lord show me about my sins that's right and I want and she said brother Bram I thought I had no hope she said there is hope for you and he kneel on there with her in that room and got her back to the Lord so let's pull back the c a bit sir and see what God is seeing God is seeing that's a daughter of Minds that's right trapped this is a son of mine that is condemning her his name is on the book and her name is on the book that's right I need to get somebody to her I can't do it because the laws of the principes some man have to go somebody have to witness somebody have to testify so by him going in all humility he could have walk out the bar and walk out but he knew he had to tell that woman something he was challenged to do that and he went and do it I was condemning you and I was wrong the God that I serve show me that's not the way oh glory to God the love came down into my heart and now I know I must reach out to you and I'm come to get you back oh God may God get you back tonight oh it take love to do that but love can do that love is powerful Oh Glory to God love breaks barriers love heals love delivers Love Can't Fail oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah it believeth all things it opth all things Oh Glory to God let's see W up here but Bram says at charity which is love that's the caping stone brotherly kindness now what does it do they are waiting for the headstone which is love for God is love and he controls and he's the strength of every one of these things the holy spirit is above this welling this together building a what a perfect church for the for for for the Capstone that's right to cap off amen and when a man or woman possesses this which is all the virtues then the Capstone comes down and seals them into the kingdom of God and then you are living example of of Christianity that's right brotherly kindness I going to skip that Hallelujah now brotherly kindness then love being the Capstone and all this is tempered together by the Holy Spirit now that is what it takes to become a servant of Christ amen Christ builds his church in the seven Church ages his bride a person a woman a church seven Church ages constitute to make the bride and so on like that remember this morning these virtues has to be in there before the Capstone will even Comon it oh praise the Lord so Jesus proved he was the right kind of son I say say let me say this if you can't me a fanatic from this night on that very thing that I'm speaking of will be done there will be a power put into the church and now it's coming in and the Holy Spirit Will so anoint the people till they will speak the word yes sir and Flash like and will shut them out in something like that all right then we know that uh somebody spoke in tongues and there was interpretation and the interpretation was this because thou has chosen the Narrow Path yeah the harder way that was walked of your own choosing that's right and that is where it must be your choice love is a choice sir not a feeling say God's love is not parental love God's love is elective love so he can send you through the fire he can send you through the hard trials because he Lov you because he elected you God is Not Human like grandparents I'm a grandparent I love my grandchildren but that's not love God has his love is called elective love his love rebukes his love corrects his love instructs that is love right yes sir Hallelujah because I was chosen a narrow path the Hardway that was walked of your own choosing yes sir in other words I didn't have to do it I Conde with the other of them but I stayed with the word th was picked the correct and precise decision it is my way watch he says this in it what a glorious decision thou has made this in itself is that which will make and come to pass the tremendous victory in the love divine amen and I'm closing yes sir so listen to this right now we have a perfect standing by the blood that's right when God look through the blood he see us perfect but our state is not perfect corre we feel down we feel depressed that's our state but by way of the blood we are perfect because when God look down he seen us through the blood do you understand that even if the devil is accusing about your life Jesus I die for them I pay the price for them the accuser that's why I last time I here I said don't accuse one another because you are not Lucifer he is the accuser of the Brethren don't accuse let Lucifer do the accusing Christ is doing the pleading because he's our lawyer isn't that right watch this so there for Faith say this so that that perfect standing by the blood but the perfect state will come by charity when charity comes you'll have a perfect State Hallelujah when brother Brandon was on the platform and a woman come up and she BN something there she said that's okay that's just his presence to charity was all around him as an invisible force feel they not start TR now this real thing yeah you had a feel around him so when she walking up on the platform she walk up and she buks he said that's okay that's just his presence presence are distance that coming back that presence around you that coming back oh glory to God Satan had to get permission even approach around there oh give the Lord some Praises a perfect State a perfect standing a perfect Pride perfect F perfect rapture we are going to get all here oh give the Lord some Praises all right brother Bram just all right so I'm on page 11 go just have 1 pictures Pi we do fine but BR I'd rather have a church listen a moment I would rather have a church that knows nothing about any spiritual gift and just be so in love with each other amen and with Christ that's right I rather have that than every spiritual gift operating in the church now that might sound hard in a Pentecostal group but I rather have it where there is gifts they will fail where there is gifts it bring confusion where there is gifts they can be questioned but where there is love it is perfect that's right and if you had perfect love you would have perfect gifts so work first with love and that brings fellowship and fellowship bring giftsall that's good isn't that beautiful work with love first and that brings Fellowship that's right and fellowship bring this all right so we on page 12 now there are people who lie okay okay right after this morning the holy spirit is so beautiful coming down and bathing Us in his great Beauty I was just Inspire to speak them words and say some glorious day that all the gifts that's in the church will be set aside on a mantle as it was and the Holy Spirit himself will just take the church in such a control of divine love until the sick will be healed the blind will see the lame will walk without hands being laid on them it will be a one great Unity Hallelujah he this the people they lie cheat steal till you could almost have a bond of security to B $5 from somebody you know the Bible speaks of that there'll be no love in the last days but just among the elect [Applause] people that's right the scripture say husband would be against wife wife against husband children against parents just among the elected of the Lord will there be any love left and I'm finished mus musicians come up [Music] please I'm going to read 1 Corinthians 13 yes and the Amplified are we going to close sorry this is the Amplified if I can speak in tongues of men and angels and have not love that reasoning intentional spiritual devotion such as inspired by God's love and in us I'm only a noisy gong correct a clanging symbol exactly if I have prophetic Powers the gift of interpreting the Divine will and purpose and understand all the secret truths and M trees and possess all knowledge and if I have sufficient Faith so I can remove mountains but have not love God loving me I am nothing a useless nobody exactly even if I do out all that I have to the poor in providing food if I Surrender my body to be burned or in order that I may glory and have not the love of God in Me I gain nothing love endures long and is patient and kind love is never in Envy us nor boils over with jealousy is not boastful or vain glorious does not display itself hly it is not conceited arrogant inflated with pride it is not rude unmanly does not act unbecomingly love does not insist on its own rights or its own way for it is not self-seeking it is not touchy fretful or resentful it takes no account of evil done to it it pays no attention to suffer WR it does not rejoice at Injustice and righteousness but rejoice when right and Truth Prevail right love bears up under anything and everything and come that comes it is ever ready to believe the best in every person that's right its hopes are fadeless under all circumstances it endures everything without weakness amen love never fails never never Fades out or becomes obsolete or comes to an end as a prophecy or the gift of interpreting the Divine will and purpose it will be fulfilled and pass away as for tongues it will be destroyed and ceased as for knowledge it will pass away it will lose its value and be superseded by truth for our knowledge is fragmentary incomplete and imperfect and our prophecy our teaching is fragmentary incomplete and imperfect but when the complete and perfect total comes the incomplete and imperfect will vanish away all right become Antiquated void and superseded when I was a child I talk like a child I thought like a child I reason like a child now that I have become a man I am done away with childish way and I've put them aside and now we are looking in a mirror sir that GS only a dim blurred reflection of reality as a riddle or Enigma but then when Perfection comes we shall see in reality and face to face now I know in part imperfectly but then I shall know and understand fully and clearly even in the same manner as I have been fully and clearly known and understood by God so now faith hope hope love abide Faith conviction and belief respecting man's relation to God and divine things hope joyful and confident expectation true affection for God and man growing out of the love of God in us these three but the greatest of Jus love amen last scripture done we going to play something praise God there some Romans 13:10 love worketh no ill to his neighbor therefore love is

bless [Music] you God bless you Church am amen thank you brother Theo for a beautiful message tonight um before I pray I just want to say a few words and um I want to thank you all the local assembly J London for the honor you did to brother Peter Chandler the funeral service I've been in quite a few funeral services in our church at of our church in my country as my country and that's not saying words I can't remember being a service as outstanding as what we had on Monday for brother Peter and so I want to thank you for the great honor you did to brother Peter truth be told I still feel so pained and I know you feel the same way because um it's now that we are realizing brother Peter is no longer here and I just want to leave you a word here I number the Peter since 1981 and he labored he labored for this church when the church was in heon's Hall all the way down to the years he labored and if there's anything about brother Peter brother Benham said that live so that when you pass on the preacher doesn't have to tell lies about you it's so easy to say ni about brother Peter because that's who he was he was just a fine Christian and a fine human being and I would and my testimony about the funeral service and the sweet atmosphere we in the service at the reception is just a thorough reflection of who brother Peter himself was Anonymous there one and I've never and brother Theo said it first and I mean I mean publicly I mean when he sent his testimony in but Frankly Speaking is something that anyone in brother Peter will say like brother benam was said of him you do not know his friends from his enemies that's who brother Peter was and the Swit Spirit at the reception at the service was just a reflection of who he was it couldn't be any other way you couldn't know his friends from his enemies and everybody was there whoever it was and it was just a sweet Spirit of love and my admonition would just be Church please stay that way amen please stay that way the greatest thing we can do for brother Peter in in to salute his memory to honor his memory is just to stay that way stay a church full of love like brother the pre tonight to be the cement that will glue this church together stay together and above all I want to say to you sister Monica the family please take care of them amen sister Monica I known her s new brother Peter she was there by his side through thick and thin and it's not the time to go into all of those things but she went through a lot with him that's true and sister Monica want to say thank you again for the strength you gave all of us because because very few very few men or women not just sisters even Brothers will find it difficult to find the strength that she exhibited it was on the 12th of April 2 days after
