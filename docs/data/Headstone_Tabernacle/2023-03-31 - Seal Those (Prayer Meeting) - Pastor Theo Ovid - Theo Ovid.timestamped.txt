[11:30] put his ball heads or with a prayer
[11:33] tonight as we are push forward
[11:36] to the service
[11:40] I want to pray for one Sherry McIntosh
[11:44] for her to be loosed from under the
[11:46] power of Darkness
[11:48] and from the house of Hell she's trapped
[11:51] let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you
[11:53] tonight for gladness together for this
[11:55] time for him and I pray that you would
[11:57] Inspire and a few words that will be
[12:00] shared with your people that it will
[12:02] Minister unto them and entrance that
[12:04] they could enter into the channel of
[12:06] prayer where they could break through
[12:08] Father prayer bless this prayer meeting
[12:10] tonight bless them in their homes may
[12:13] they receive a special visitation
[12:14] tonight in the name of Jesus and father
[12:16] I bring Cherry Macintosh before you that
[12:20] you will lose her from under the power
[12:22] of darkness and deliver from the house
[12:25] of hell
[12:26] take out of that trap condition Lord and
[12:28] fear
[12:29] fear we preach you have done a work in
[12:32] our heart before you can come and do so
[12:34] again may she be delivered tonight in
[12:37] Jesus you might ask it
[12:39] amen
[12:41] God bless you things and welcome
[12:43] and before I read the scripture uh as
[12:48] one of you heard with the night service
[12:50] uh what is your excuse
[12:53] and um I really thank God for the
[12:56] focused thought that was presented to us
[12:58] and you know many times most times when
[13:01] I pray in for Kuala will speak or exalt
[13:04] or share anything at all I would ask the
[13:07] Lord to drop his thoughts into their
[13:09] hearts put his words upon their lips
[13:11] that we could be edifying so regardless
[13:14] of who it is
[13:15] I listen to hear God I listen to hear
[13:18] things that I know is the spirit
[13:21] speaking because God could use any one
[13:24] of us and
[13:26] but he is limited to our surrender if
[13:29] we're going to see that tonight it will
[13:30] change your perspective and you would
[13:33] see the need to pray
[13:34] in other words the spirit of God
[13:37] even though God could do things
[13:40] he has to get a channel to you
[13:42] that's why you're looking for your hands
[13:44] and your feet and your attitude and your
[13:47] words and and your prayer
[13:50] note that Jesus explained this he says
[13:56] you pray the Lord of the harvests that
[13:58] he would send laborers into the house
[13:59] because the Harvest is right but the
[14:02] leverages few and but Ibrahim said that
[14:04] God set it up that way that it doesn't
[14:07] happen till we pray it doesn't happen to
[14:09] be called can we asked to repeat that is
[14:13] how it is set up in other words we could
[14:16] know the prophecy that with a mighty
[14:18] hand he's going to deliver we know the
[14:21] deliverer is coming and he could sit
[14:23] down he could sit with your more clues
[14:25] you could sit with a bad attitude your
[14:27] consistency will grow it from your
[14:28] system awaiting on it but that's not how
[14:31] it works when God came down to Moses his
[14:35] first thing I have heard the Christ of
[14:38] my people now if it was simple that
[14:41] because God said it and you believe it
[14:44] and that settlement in that context then
[14:47] you just sit back and relax you know but
[14:50] it wasn't like that God so I realized
[14:53] now why pressure comes we don't like
[14:56] pressure but we're not doing the things
[14:58] we're supposed to do we're making
[14:59] excuses but pressure come to force the
[15:02] issue this is what is about
[15:04] so it's like Joseph dreams put pressure
[15:07] on his Brethren who was jealous of him
[15:10] to sell him out D1 the pressure they
[15:13] can't handle this young man with
[15:16] Revelation inspiration and love of the
[15:18] father with a rainbow quote that was the
[15:20] issue he committed on the cause they
[15:21] dump it Joseph no under pressure
[15:25] pain of losing his family and getting a
[15:28] whole new different environment and he
[15:30] had to survive there with his Revelation
[15:32] with his vision with his testimony we
[15:35] know the story but if our wife in prison
[15:38] until until the man remember me the
[15:41] Butler and the man forgot him because he
[15:43] wasn't ready yet and many times we won't
[15:45] go to do things but we're not ready yet
[15:47] we don't know we're not ready we think
[15:49] we are ready and we wanted to work out
[15:51] and we find is a is a pain because it's
[15:54] not what we expect live then turn out
[15:57] the way we want it to turn out and we
[15:59] get disappointed we end up living in the
[16:01] Gap and again we're not living in a kind
[16:04] of state of consistency about God but
[16:07] when you look closer you realize a lot
[16:09] of things are dependent on prayer so
[16:12] let's see tonight that this session here
[16:14] that we're having is the core behind the
[16:18] service on Sunday behind decision on
[16:21] Wednesday night in other words this is
[16:23] the Indian room of the power or the
[16:26] inspiration or the anointing that's in
[16:28] the church this is where
[16:36] that's something different understand
[16:39] this we are humans God put us on the
[16:42] spirit with our own Wills our desire our
[16:46] own
[16:47] man has achieved a lot of things without
[16:50] God
[16:51] companions have stopped without God
[16:53] Science and Technology a lot of stuff
[16:56] man thinking and God gave him the
[16:59] ability to be creative God given the
[17:01] ability to have imagination and what
[17:03] they imagined they could have something
[17:05] like that and because of that you could
[17:07] really do great stuff as a human being
[17:09] on it even without God
[17:11] but the thing about it for the spirit of
[17:14] God to work or the spirit of God that
[17:17] knows the things of God to work we he
[17:21] has to find people that make himself
[17:23] available so whatever you yield to God
[17:25] that's what he could use you want to
[17:27] sing you could use your voice but your
[17:30] heart want to be right here you could
[17:31] use your feet your hands whatever
[17:33] whatever you want to yield to him no he
[17:35] want our entire being that he could
[17:37] express himself to us no Satan is the
[17:39] same Satan remember he doesn't belong
[17:42] here he was kicked out and that spirit
[17:44] that leave the spirit looking for
[17:45] vessels and temples and and things to
[17:47] work through and once you see an opening
[17:49] he slips in and we call that a back door
[17:52] once he gets a back door whether in your
[17:55] life by sin like whatever it is in your
[17:59] home and your family by the things that
[18:00] you do a back to any back door you slip
[18:02] them and he slips in to make Havoc he's
[18:06] not thinking of good things you know to
[18:07] make havoc in your life and so on like
[18:09] that so tonight I trust them that the
[18:11] few words I share with edifying you and
[18:13] help you that you could see and get a
[18:15] burden to pray and when the devil tried
[18:17] to stop your mouth and shut you up and
[18:19] whatnot you have to break past that
[18:21] because you as a son or a doctor of God
[18:23] has access to the father I call upon his
[18:27] name so if you have your Bibles
[18:30] I like to read at least two portions of
[18:32] scripture from Ezekiel nines you're
[18:34] pretty familiar with one to six and also
[18:36] First John 3 18 to 22.
[18:40] very interesting here tonight uh is the
[18:42] kill nine now let me say this before we
[18:45] continue don't let pray for me be an
[18:48] excuse for you not praying you somebody
[18:49] say pray for me I pray for me I pray for
[18:51] me and you saying pray for me because
[18:53] you're lazy pray for me because you're
[18:55] not praying pray for me that can't work
[18:56] cut that out that is childish thing when
[18:58] I was a chance take like a child I'm
[19:00] gonna shoot like a child I'm gonna
[19:01] become a man they put away childish
[19:03] things you have to pray you do the same
[19:05] you do praying you have to be repentance
[19:08] all right Ezekiel 9 reading from verse
[19:11] one he cried alongside my ears with a
[19:13] loud voice saying cause them to have
[19:15] charge over the city they're drawn near
[19:17] even every man with a destroying weapon
[19:20] in his hand
[19:22] praise God
[19:25] uh
[19:26] uh everybody hear me tonight everybody's
[19:28] hearing me tonight but let's continue
[19:31] um
[19:32] and behold six men came from the way of
[19:34] the higher gate which light was in North
[19:36] everymanus photo weapon
[19:38] one man among them a school with linen
[19:40] my writer was ink one by side they spent
[19:43] it and Stood Beside the bridge North and
[19:45] the glory of the god of Israel was gone
[19:47] up from the Cherub where upon he was to
[19:49] The Treasure of the house and he called
[19:51] to the man ruled with linen that which
[19:53] had the righteous ink on by side and the
[19:55] Lord said unto him go to the midst of
[19:58] the city now this is not church
[20:00] it's not who your pastor is where you go
[20:02] to church and fellowship they're not
[20:03] there's nothing with full and the Lord
[20:06] said unto him go to the midst of the
[20:09] city through the midst of Jerusalem I
[20:11] set a mark upon the foreheads of the men
[20:14] that signed Christ all the Abominations
[20:17] that be done in the midst of us and to
[20:19] the others he said in my hearing going
[20:22] after him to the city and smite let not
[20:25] your eyes fear
[20:29] leads little children women that come
[20:33] not near any man upon whom is the mark
[20:35] and begin at My Sanctuary then they
[20:37] bring it on the ancient men which would
[20:40] be her for the house so listen
[20:42] whenever
[20:44] the Seal of God
[20:46] breaks out
[20:48] No Authority Church judgment is next
[20:52] reading First John 3 reading from Verse
[20:55] 18 to 22. my little children
[20:59] let us not love in wood
[21:01] neither in tongue but indeed and truth
[21:05] so here sin is not quotes it is that
[21:09] scripture is not belief it's going
[21:12] beyond that
[21:13] love can be in Word
[21:15] when talk which is tongue but indeed an
[21:20] intrude
[21:22] okay it was 19. and hereby we know that
[21:26] we are of the truth and shall have four
[21:28] Hearts before him
[21:30] now if our hearts condemn us
[21:32] God is greater than our heart and with
[21:34] all things beloved
[21:36] if our heart come there must not then we
[21:38] have confidence towards God
[21:40] now listen to this sub Clause I call it
[21:43] like a clause you know actors shall be
[21:45] given think you shall find lock on the
[21:47] door shall be open listen to verse 22
[21:49] here now
[21:50] and whatsoever we ask
[21:53] we receive of him why because we keep
[21:58] his Commandments which is obedience like
[22:01] what given talking about on Wednesday
[22:02] night and do those things
[22:05] that are pleasing in a sight
[22:08] so you hear us shall be given and people
[22:11] ask you an Ocarina what not but are you
[22:14] in obedience
[22:16] are you doing this thing that pleases
[22:19] him
[22:19] because if you're doing those things we
[22:22] receive from him okay let's go
[22:27] you see the Holy Ghost said
[22:29] he only sealed those who wept inside
[22:33] for the abomination of the city the
[22:35] title of what I want to share tonight
[22:37] ever taught seal Dunes
[22:39] you have a dose see you do not everyone
[22:43] so you do
[22:44] and he says
[22:47] who would he steal in the cities of
[22:49] night
[22:50] who lay on their face day and night
[22:52] crying
[22:53] for the sins in the city now
[22:56] I don't believe he's expressing somebody
[23:00] that say prayers or your prayer thing
[23:03] I believe
[23:05] this thing about sign and crying is deep
[23:08] it's not a light thing
[23:11] it's not something that you hear much in
[23:14] the message as a good
[23:16] time and crime people like talk
[23:20] Fellowship
[23:21] Revelation
[23:23] Mysteries information
[23:25] I never heard such so when I call it was
[23:28] presented but at the end of the day when
[23:30] that is stripped
[23:32] when you are alone whether you are
[23:34] tonight in your home on your room
[23:35] Wherever You Are
[23:36] and you come down to sign and cry that's
[23:38] personal that has nothing to do with
[23:41] huge corporate
[23:43] that has to do with individuals
[23:46] he says if he was an obedient child he
[23:49] loved his father no matter what any
[23:51] other boy said on the next round he knew
[23:53] what his father wanted do you know what
[23:55] your father want that means having a
[23:57] knowledge of God's will for your life
[24:00] and knowledge of the good and knowledge
[24:02] what is required of you no matter what
[24:03] any of the other boys at the next farm
[24:05] he knew what his father wanted watch he
[24:07] could tell from the way he built and
[24:09] what he did
[24:10] what he wanted and a man that's the Son
[24:14] of God reads the Bible
[24:18] and see
[24:19] what God was yesterday he's a sing today
[24:22] and believe him to be deceiving
[24:24] principle in power and everything else
[24:26] Hebrews 38. now then he said when he
[24:30] proved to be a true son here's what the
[24:33] father did to come out to the public
[24:35] place in the street
[24:36] and then he took his son set him up
[24:39] clothed him at rope special role for a
[24:42] special occasion and then there was
[24:43] ceremony where his father adopted him
[24:45] his own family now this is plain there's
[24:48] no complications with this there's no
[24:50] hidden Mystery behind this it is very
[24:52] simple I've got to get the answer
[24:54] if we please him on the back
[24:58] which is when you pray pray to the
[25:02] father who's eating secret and the
[25:04] father who's eating secret to
[25:05] contribution openly openly means you
[25:08] will see the Joy on you in which he feet
[25:11] on you you would even see the glory of
[25:13] God upon you you would see eventually
[25:16] adoption upon you because the father
[25:19] would reward you
[25:22] okay so it's not a matter you promoting
[25:25] yourself I am this I am that you have a
[25:26] flapped a wave there's no flock to weave
[25:28] he said he will let it be known among
[25:30] men it will speak for itself so actually
[25:32] any man pumping himself something
[25:34] another man asking I don't get what
[25:36] should we have he not on track he's not
[25:38] on track because it takes God to
[25:40] identify this is my beloved Son to whom
[25:43] I will please the people don't do that a
[25:46] lot of men like the the the the the
[25:49] um this ceremony of from the people they
[25:51] love him so much and everything is like
[25:53] that but it's not it's not the people
[25:54] this is Father and Son okay and then
[25:57] anything that son did was answered by
[25:59] the father this fan name was good as a
[26:02] check or the father was we know that was
[26:03] adoption
[26:06] now when we receive the Holy Ghost
[26:09] prophecy it's just isn't a jump and
[26:12] shock of it it isn't just to speak with
[26:15] tongues and run over the floor it isn't
[26:18] to organize a group and say we got it
[26:20] the rest of them haven't it's it's to
[26:22] work here we go with love and humility
[26:25] as Christ come to do with
[26:28] them Drop Distance out of here this will
[26:31] all men know that you are my disciples
[26:33] when you have loved one father
[26:36] love is from not with tangible
[26:38] love is something that is expressive
[26:41] love is something that you could feel
[26:43] love is something that you could be
[26:45] aware of that you know
[26:46] child know if you love the dog no dog's
[26:50] tail
[26:51] so if you are a vibrating expression
[26:55] sharing and so on the love of God it
[26:58] will be felt it will be known it will be
[27:00] unfolded as God's love
[27:03] again I want to ask you a question we
[27:06] take so much emotion over religious
[27:07] ideas
[27:08] like this is like like people think they
[27:11] are spiritual but they're very religious
[27:13] spiritual is different you see but
[27:16] spiritual you can bear with others but
[27:18] religious you can't stand this one and
[27:20] it comes to an argument
[27:22] but watch who in the city tonight in
[27:24] Jacksonville that is so concerned about
[27:28] the Lost World in this last day and even
[27:31] spends here we go 13 minutes a night
[27:35] free in for the sins of the city
[27:39] but according to the scripture the angel
[27:41] of God was told to seal those who signed
[27:44] up right
[27:46] questions
[27:48] are you one of those
[27:50] those are those
[27:53] that he's talking
[27:55] you know sometimes I'm praying
[27:59] and I be praying ordinary let's say
[28:01] ordinary just saying words to God
[28:03] and then no
[28:05] something just break
[28:07] and it goes deeper
[28:08] and then it's not just words coming up
[28:11] no it's a hard thing it's a heart for me
[28:15] and then no you're looking to pray till
[28:17] you break through
[28:18] you ever
[28:20] was praying and like it did a sheet over
[28:22] your head
[28:23] and you're praying not going anywhere
[28:25] and you pray and your boss too it's
[28:28] almost like if there's something hanging
[28:29] over that is when you preach through
[28:31] you're not giving up you want to be able
[28:34] to preach
[28:36] no put into takes time
[28:38] so it's not just well okay we have a
[28:40] time of prayer and this is your weekly
[28:42] deposit of prayer you yourself have to
[28:45] have a desire that you want to break you
[28:48] if you don't even know what that is you
[28:50] should want to know what it is
[28:56] don't leave yet
[28:58] and then they begin to cry out
[29:00] there's another way you don't hear
[29:02] people don't cry out remember the only
[29:04] days people will be falling asleep in
[29:06] parameters and just you know losing
[29:10] their eyes and they say the praying in
[29:11] their mind they're all kinds are tough
[29:13] and a lot of things just going on in the
[29:15] mind but God wants you to talk to him
[29:18] this is zoom prayer meeting give us an
[29:20] opportunity to be in a room together
[29:22] with your room but yet you are home by
[29:25] yourself no I don't know what if the
[29:27] neighbors are wrong or whatnot but you
[29:29] could really have a passionate time in
[29:32] talking to the Lord and and sharing your
[29:35] burdens and sharing your concern let me
[29:37] just finish wrap up here
[29:39] reasonable okay so what I want to talk
[29:42] about who is consumed that we spend 30
[29:46] minutes a night praying for the sins of
[29:49] the people and as as you said 30 minutes
[29:52] at night understand this but us param
[29:55] talk about making praying a habit
[29:57] I was thinking about
[29:59] if we ask what is your routine
[30:03] no no I'm an early writer and that's
[30:05] that's just how I am
[30:11] you have to know what is your routine
[30:13] because if you don't have
[30:15] system if you don't have something that
[30:18] you do
[30:19] like
[30:21] on a daily basis that it becomes part of
[30:25] your habit you'd find yourself
[30:27] scratching you'd find yourself not being
[30:31] able to account
[30:32] for all your time is unfolded
[30:36] so for example somebody could rise early
[30:38] in the morning
[30:39] let's say four five because pretty even
[30:43] half an hour pray five to half past five
[30:45] if they want to do some work they could
[30:47] go half past five to six and then they
[30:49] could have their breakfast and this
[30:51] becomes a routine a reason when they
[30:53] could stretch it from five to six in
[30:55] prayer
[30:56] and that becomes a rhythm it's not like
[30:58] a fighting because you see it all adds
[31:01] up the discipline and and this is where
[31:05] people are running from they don't want
[31:06] accountability and they don't want the
[31:08] discipline but this is what being a
[31:10] disciple is all about this is what Jesus
[31:13] call is man to be about to be
[31:15] disciplined ones or disciples followers
[31:18] of and and and people don't want that
[31:20] they don't want to be really taught how
[31:23] to follow many people want to lead but
[31:24] they don't know how to and we have
[31:26] to learn to follow and the Bible talk
[31:29] about those who are of authority over
[31:31] you follow them who are examples of the
[31:35] faith you have to be able to see it
[31:37] whose Faith follow whose Faith follow
[31:41] their conversation who Faith follow
[31:42] their way of life you have to see feet
[31:46] applied Faith growing feet manifested
[31:49] you have to see vision and what Vision
[31:52] does and why we do what we do and to see
[31:56] the results because everything we do
[31:57] have an end game you know everything we
[32:00] do have a result you plant think it
[32:03] takes some time to unfold but they
[32:04] produce fixed for you plant orange it
[32:06] takes some time to unfold but you get
[32:08] oranges you plant watermelon they
[32:10] sometimes to unfold but you get
[32:11] watermelon whatever we gonna read so if
[32:14] we plant habits habits could bring in
[32:17] character by virtue of you know it come
[32:20] like automatic subconscious like we say
[32:22] like when a child is not willing to
[32:24] write have a three wheel and have a like
[32:27] guide Wheels but afterwards they don't
[32:29] need no guide Wheels when they get older
[32:31] you just write you don't even think
[32:33] about it you just go on a bike balance
[32:35] and you're right you don't think twice
[32:37] because it comes subconscious it comes
[32:40] automatic and this to me is how really
[32:42] to become this is to me is how praying
[32:45] has to become and you have to be able to
[32:47] understand God wants you to cry out to
[32:50] say God
[33:04] yesterday yesterday's gone that's why
[33:07] even my preaching and teaching I don't
[33:10] dig up too much in history Lord did us
[33:12] two years ago or three years ago and
[33:14] fabulous how many dates and he did
[33:15] enough I just probably seen yesterday so
[33:18] the same God yesterday is today I need
[33:20] him today I see tomorrow coming and I
[33:23] will hit tomorrow I want them tomorrow
[33:24] too okay all right so let's hit the home
[33:27] stretch and wrap this whole thing up
[33:29] tonight
[33:30] what about him say this now that is what
[33:33] Christ wants to do with this church not
[33:35] give you any more gifts you have too
[33:37] many of them no this is a blow my own
[33:39] not give you any more gifts you have too
[33:45] many of them know what he wants to do is
[33:47] to give you himself and love
[33:50] the love of God
[33:51] the Abundant Life in your heart that
[33:54] makes you love everybody makes you love
[33:57] him to the kind of rest
[33:59] remember
[34:00] the Bible said that the Holy Ghost went
[34:03] forth to seal those for the kingdom the
[34:06] Holy Ghost was hidden
[34:08] to only those whose side cried
[34:13] for for the Abomination that was done in
[34:15] the city and anybody raising Hunter
[34:17] Knight and tell me of a Christian one in
[34:19] Greenville that lays on their face so
[34:21] good for the sins of Greenville that
[34:24] they cry outside before God day and
[34:26] night tell me where that person is I can
[34:28] show you the mark of the Holy Ghost so
[34:31] the Bible said lack only those
[34:33] foreign
[34:37] and why are these people are coming I
[34:40] want some of you that's that's on on
[34:42] praying wrongs with God I want some of
[34:44] you pastors go down here now I want the
[34:46] pastors and those Christian women that
[34:48] knows God come around this woman here
[34:50] you men who know God are interested in
[34:53] Souls you know what the Bible says in
[34:55] the last day so who is calling to pray
[35:00] last days the prophecies said that the
[35:03] people here we here we go in the last
[35:07] days the prophecy said that the people
[35:10] would be so cool and indifferent and
[35:13] when the Holy Ghost come true just to
[35:16] see those who sigh and cried for their
[35:18] permissioned ethnicity I want each of
[35:20] you of ministers to point out me in your
[35:23] congregation that person that science
[35:26] and Christ their light or the sins of
[35:28] the people in the city could you put a
[35:30] Hanuman up on this person remember the
[35:32] Holy Spirit to manage to seal those
[35:35] touch not the others but they're going
[35:37] to perish
[35:39] all right that's cool
[35:42] that is why the Rapture the bride
[35:46] the wise version the call out the
[35:50] affording the elected
[35:53] they're bright
[35:55] wise version called forwarding elected
[35:59] why you businessman wouldn't run your
[36:01] office like some people try to sing war
[36:02] on this program
[36:03] God knew before the foundation of the
[36:06] world who would be safe and who would
[36:08] not be safe by predestination by Foreign
[36:11] he saw every member in other words God
[36:14] saw the choices you would make
[36:17] I'm seeing his prayer about the power of
[36:19] decisions it's not that God forced you
[36:22] to make a tradition God bringing the
[36:24] drama in front of you for you to make a
[36:26] choice a Battleground is the mind and it
[36:29] because that is where decisions are made
[36:32] so because tonight you choose to come
[36:35] into this virtual room you cannot watch
[36:36] television you can go and watch some
[36:38] movie You're Gonna Go by some friend or
[36:39] some family you choose to come in
[36:41] tonight and thank God I certainly
[36:43] appreciate you did but in choose him no
[36:45] you have to choose in hearing what
[36:47] you're hearing whether or not you're
[36:48] gonna cry out whether or not you ever
[36:50] break past the human Instagram and say
[36:52] Lord I need you to intervene tonight
[36:54] hear what he said here now he says God
[36:57] knew before the foundation of the world
[36:58] who would be thief and who would not be
[37:00] saved by predestination by Foreign
[37:03] knowledge is for every member and put
[37:05] every name on the lamb book of life
[37:06] before the church ever began Jesus comes
[37:09] to seek and save that which was on that
[37:11] book he bought the book of redemption it
[37:13] was lost and the redeem us and all the
[37:16] names was on that book was redeemed when
[37:18] he redeemed us so therefore he comes
[37:21] with a shout right and that shout is
[37:24] all right and the Holy Ghost is what
[37:26] SEALs you and the bride elect will be
[37:29] crying against the foolish virgins in
[37:31] the church all right because they were
[37:33] rather than inside the masculinity
[37:35] right so the Bride is a bride the bride
[37:39] is going to make herself ready the bride
[37:41] is going to take the clothes of the wood
[37:42] and rock herself in the gong of the
[37:45] promised would isn't that right I said
[37:47] the Holy Spirit come now and what long
[37:49] treatment time when I'm Dreaming time
[37:50] when he gets woke up when I'm going to
[37:52] smoke up the copy weak should be weak
[37:54] you're clean you clean the lamp and so
[37:56] on like that and it shines bright again
[37:58] and and and because the weak now because
[38:01] fire using oil you have a carbon behind
[38:03] it so after a while still in the Lord
[38:06] You're testifying you're witnessing
[38:07] you're coming to church Karma builds up
[38:09] and your lights gets a little dry or hot
[38:12] or whatever it is it's part of life okay
[38:15] but you have a job till the week that's
[38:18] what these things is about all right all
[38:21] right so let's go find our code
[38:23] something I've read over and over I will
[38:25] read it again tonight they fall no
[38:27] better with our baby to get What It
[38:29] Wants of course with it when the baby is
[38:31] born you could set a bell down there say
[38:33] my little son I'm actually illusion and
[38:35] when you are hungry you need your mother
[38:38] ring the bell it will never work the
[38:40] only way that you could get what they
[38:42] want is to cry fit that is God's sweet
[38:44] let me switch to us this is the final
[38:46] knuckles that's the way that we get what
[38:49] we want is the cry for it coyote don't
[38:52] be ashamed to say I'm hungry for God
[38:53] don't care whether the beacons pastors
[38:56] whatever is a wrong scream what anyhow
[38:57] he said the Jones are certain there what
[39:00] difference does it make as you only read
[39:02] it is to get it until you get help
[39:05] he taught that when you see on earth a
[39:08] body unjust judge and I'm finished
[39:10] tonight so friends
[39:13] oh my God
[39:15] he didn't say to you those who are
[39:17] spoken with books let's be real
[39:19] he did not see he's seeing those who go
[39:21] to put over Church
[39:23] let's be real
[39:24] he didn't say steal those who in the
[39:26] message
[39:27] let's be real
[39:28] steal those who believe in William
[39:30] Branham no he did not say that
[39:32] she would also believe in Joseph he did
[39:34] not say that
[39:35] feel those who you know opened Us open
[39:39] book on the head or sleep with spoken
[39:41] book under the head no you didn't see
[39:42] that see those who sigh and cry and that
[39:46] is why all these scriptures is all
[39:49] absolute that is why we have to hold the
[39:52] word
[39:53] it will take us to where God wants us to
[39:55] be but Abraham didn't come and bring a
[39:57] new doctrine he came to reveal the very
[39:58] scriptures itself that's why we talk
[40:00] about the revealed with
[40:28] and Lord you know the choices we will
