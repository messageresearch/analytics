[56:43] Prophet said the ones here the people
[56:46] that manifest the promised world is the
[56:48] seed of the eat
[56:50] it has no visible manifestations sorry
[56:53] it doesn't have new people and
[56:54] infestation the people that manifest the
[56:58] promise would of the age is the seed of
[57:00] that age according to what Jesus said
[57:02] right here they are the children of the
[57:05] kingdom that's right the manifestation
[57:08] of the Holy Spirit operate and choose
[57:10] children is those seeds of the kingdom
[57:14] of that age oh praise the name of the
[57:17] Lord

[1:01:24] greet you how many are happy to be in
[1:01:28] the house you know we go to work during
[1:01:35] the week and we're tired and weary but
[1:01:38] David said one thing have I desired of
[1:01:42] the Lord and that will I seek after if
[1:01:46] there was one thing that you desired
[1:01:49] some would desire a million dollars some
[1:01:52] would desire this that but David desire
[1:01:54] to dwell in his house all the days of
[1:01:58] his life and we're so thankful that God
[1:02:00] has given us this opportunity amen to
[1:02:04] come in his presence I greet you this
[1:02:08] morning in the wonderful name of Jesus
[1:02:09] Christ I want to just sincerely say that
[1:02:15] I am delighted delighted to be back in
[1:02:18] Trinidad amen
[1:02:24] I was very touched last year with the
[1:02:29] fellowship and the unity of the spirit
[1:02:32] that I felt and we have got to really
[1:02:35] work on that area of the unity of the
[1:02:42] Spirit you know we've got to get started
[1:02:45] and we know that the unity of the Spirit
[1:02:48] can only come by the spirit but if we
[1:02:53] can get started thank God can do the
[1:02:55] rest
[1:02:56] Amen hallelujah so but anyway I am here
[1:03:00] to just give a little testimony and
[1:03:04] these fine preachers that have come
[1:03:06] before me brother Peter and brother Paul
[1:03:09] I I was thinking of changing my name
[1:03:12] last night how on earth can I follow
[1:03:16] Peter and Paul just trying to make a
[1:03:22] name up or something a Silas or
[1:03:24] something or you know perhaps may have
[1:03:27] been more more powerful but amen
[1:03:32] fear not in his eye you know you're not
[1:03:37] in a vision Amen we are in reality here
[1:03:40] amen
[1:03:42] you know I like what brother Thea Ovid
[1:03:46] spoke there the book of Acts regarding
[1:03:50] Paul you know he Paul was of course
[1:03:55] God's man and you know of course there
[1:04:02] was some suspicion around him especially
[1:04:04] when the the scorpion had bit him but it
[1:04:08] didn't break
[1:04:09] Paul's strut he just shook it into the
[1:04:12] fire you know and what I want to say by
[1:04:17] saying this is that the devil could
[1:04:21] label you you can either choose to wear
[1:04:24] that label or you could choose to
[1:04:33] and by the grace of God you see that
[1:04:36] label did not stick amen and I come here
[1:04:45] humbly to put my shoulder to the wheel
[1:04:49] and because I always look at a man's
[1:04:54] motive his objective what he's trying to
[1:04:56] achieve and I like how brother Ovid is
[1:05:02] inclusive and there's no denomination
[1:05:06] there's no I'm always I would say I love
[1:05:09] Brotherhood I'm in nobody circle
[1:05:12] I love Brotherhood see Brotherhood is
[1:05:15] interred it's an international thing you
[1:05:19] see because it's one of the things that
[1:05:24] the that one of those caterpillars and
[1:05:26] Palma worms ate up you know Brotherhood
[1:05:29] and he hates Brotherhood and I'm here to
[1:05:33] make sure that I stand with my brother
[1:05:37] and the fine ministers who are here no
[1:05:41] doubt could have could probably do a
[1:05:43] better job than I can today but I do
[1:05:47] want to say that I'm happy I bring you
[1:05:50] greetings from original faith Gospel
[1:05:53] Tabernacle amen
[1:05:59] I also want to thank God for all the
[1:06:06] specials that went forth and and my wife
[1:06:10] will sang charity amen god bless you
[1:06:15] Rebecca now I know she does not want
[1:06:20] this said but I will say it because I
[1:06:24] just feel to say it it's her birthday
[1:06:28] today and she's 18 years old I just
[1:06:45] don't know how I get older she gets
[1:06:47] younger I just can't figure that out
[1:06:49] amen but you know when you stop counting
[1:06:52] birthdays as well that's as that's how
[1:06:56] old you are you stop we're not living in
[1:06:59] this time you know we're living in
[1:07:01] eternity so therefore I appreciate my
[1:07:04] wife and I thank her for the song
[1:07:12] the God richly bless you thank you once
[1:07:14] again brother Peter for that message
[1:07:17] Adam wear out that I like that where do
[1:07:22] you hide a tree I never heard that in
[1:07:25] the forest amen time for hiding has come
[1:07:31] is come to his end and we are certainly
[1:07:35] here to declare the gospel of God we
[1:07:38] have got to the hour is late we cannot
[1:07:43] play with God God is not to be played
[1:07:46] with you see we've got to mean what we
[1:07:49] say and say what we mean and brother
[1:07:52] Paul god bless you richly for the
[1:07:55] wonderful message the manifestation of a
[1:07:58] token amen
[1:08:00] we certainly do appreciate you for that
[1:08:03] message and how the Holy Spirit came
[1:08:05] down last evening so I pray that God
[1:08:07] would say something today that would
[1:08:11] bless his people it's we're not here to
[1:08:15] see somebody or any particular preacher
[1:08:19] whatever we're here to hear from God and
[1:08:23] I believe if we come with that
[1:08:25] expectation
[1:08:26] God will never disappoint us see because
[1:08:29] we receive what we come expecting so
[1:08:33] therefore I feel very humbled and and I
[1:08:38] thank God for my precious brother ovid
[1:08:41] we've been friends for many years and
[1:08:43] one thing I just want to say is this
[1:08:44] okay brother Overton I we we go way back
[1:08:48] we've traveled the world in many places
[1:08:52] and we've had a very healthy friendship
[1:08:58] and one thing that I appreciate for that
[1:09:00] overt is that he's always been a friend
[1:09:03] to me
[1:09:03] amen I appreciate that very much and
[1:09:07] spite it's not conditional you know you
[1:09:10] have people sometimes that are your
[1:09:12] friend
[1:09:13] based on conditions and those conditions
[1:09:17] changed and you don't know Lord come to
[1:09:19] find it but brother obut has always been
[1:09:22] around
[1:09:23] I appreciate your pastor may God bless
[1:09:26] him this church a man this work and may
[1:09:34] the Lord prosper 'it we ever prosper him
[1:09:38] and prosper this work here on this
[1:09:40] island made it reflect Jesus Christ
[1:09:43] because world is longing to see Jesus we
[1:09:48] have we have heard many ministers many
[1:09:51] fine sermons the world is longing to see
[1:09:54] Jesus and I believe we are living at the
[1:09:58] time of the manifestation of the sons of
[1:10:00] God they're going to feed Jesus I will
[1:10:03] guarantee you they're going to see Jesus
[1:10:05] hallelujah where will he be mister Jesus
[1:10:09] in you and I praise God hallelujah snot
[1:10:13] it won't be that we are actually
[1:10:15] professing it it will be God manifesting
[1:10:19] himself amen that's the that's the Jesus
[1:10:23] that the world wants to say anyway so
[1:10:25] let's stand to our feet as we go
[1:10:28] straight to the word I don't want to
[1:10:30] keep you too long I had asked your
[1:10:31] pastor how long do I have and I always
[1:10:36] have a tendency of going over my time
[1:10:39] and I don't want to do that this morning
[1:10:41] I know we have meals in between services
[1:10:46] and so forth so but once again I am
[1:10:49] happy to be here I want to draw your
[1:10:51] attention to the book of John verse 15
[1:10:57] and also verse 15 Saint John 15 verse 1
[1:11:07] Saint John 13 verse 34
[1:11:26] are you ready amen
[1:11:29] you know my world my words can fail but
[1:11:32] God's Word cannot fail and if we did
[1:11:35] nothing but read the scripture we would
[1:11:37] be blessed amen
[1:11:40] Saint John 15 I like this dis just
[1:11:44] thought I just want to give you a little
[1:11:46] testimonials before I get into it this
[1:11:50] thought came to me while I was packing
[1:11:52] to come here you know I had I had some
[1:11:56] messages and things that had preached
[1:11:58] impact and the Lord had dropped this
[1:12:01] thought in my heart and I you know how
[1:12:04] you speak to the Lord well I'm packing I
[1:12:06] had handled but he he he gave it to me
[1:12:10] so I know that the Lord will bless so
[1:12:14] the title of my message if I would
[1:12:17] before I forget I am the vine and ye are
[1:12:22] the branches and I like how God
[1:12:25] distinguishes that because no matter how
[1:12:30] much God we become or like God we will
[1:12:33] never be God I am the vine and you had
[1:12:40] the branches so we'll get into this here
[1:12:44] just a few minutes amen st. John 5 and
[1:12:47] verse 1 I am the true vine not just a
[1:12:51] vine but the True Vine and my father is
[1:12:53] the husbandman every branch in me that
[1:12:56] beareth NOT fruit he taketh away and
[1:13:00] every branch that beareth fruit he
[1:13:03] purchased it that it may bring forth
[1:13:07] more fruit so therefore don't worry
[1:13:10] about the trials and tribulations you
[1:13:12] have a few little fruits here and there
[1:13:14] God wants more fruit that he's going to
[1:13:16] purge it amen because he wants more
[1:13:19] fruit from you amen the trials of this
[1:13:22] life is more precious than gold amen and
[1:13:26] now ye are cleansed through the word
[1:13:28] which I have spoken unto you abide in me
[1:13:31] and I in you as the
[1:13:33] French or listen to this as a branch
[1:13:37] cannot bear fruit of itself a man except
[1:13:42] it abide in the vine now therefore you
[1:13:46] cannot join the vine you cannot you have
[1:13:52] to be born into the vine amen no man no
[1:13:58] more can ye except ye abide in me now
[1:14:02] let's read that again as the branch
[1:14:04] cannot bear fruit of itself except it
[1:14:06] abide in the vine no more can ye except
[1:14:11] ye abide in me I am the vine ye are the
[1:14:15] branches he that abideth in me and I in
[1:14:18] him the same bringeth forth much fruit
[1:14:22] for o listen to this for without me ye
[1:14:28] can do nothing oh I like that position
[1:14:35] without him we could do nothing amen we
[1:14:40] could try be a good Christian but
[1:14:41] without him we can do nothing
[1:14:44] amen because god this is fruit time and
[1:14:47] sea time bride time and I believe that
[1:14:50] we are all looking for the same thing
[1:14:53] and we are all striving for the same
[1:14:55] thing but we have to use God's Way of
[1:14:59] doing it see hallelujah there's no other
[1:15:02] way to bring forth truth he said I am
[1:15:05] the vine ye are the branches
[1:15:07] so therefore if a man abideth not in me
[1:15:10] he is cast forth as a branch and is
[1:15:13] withered and men gather them and cast
[1:15:16] them into the fire and they are burned
[1:15:18] if now here's the condition of this
[1:15:22] promise if ye abide in me and my words
[1:15:25] abide in you ye shall ask what you will
[1:15:29] and it shall be done unto you hiren oh
[1:15:32] my hearin is my father glorified that ye
[1:15:37] bear much fruit so shall ye be my
[1:15:41] disciples amen Saint John chapter 13 we
[1:15:48] just go back to verses or two chapters
[1:15:51] rather st. John chapter 13 and verse 34
[1:15:59] verse 34 a new commandment I give unto
[1:16:03] you that ye love one another now listen
[1:16:08] to this next these next few words as I
[1:16:15] have loved you that ye also love one
[1:16:20] another now God's love is the highest
[1:16:25] form of love we know and he wants us to
[1:16:29] love one another as he also loved us I'm
[1:16:35] not talking about a filial conditional
[1:16:37] love I'm talking about an agape love
[1:16:41] amen as we are reaching and approaching
[1:16:44] that great headstone a man the stone of
[1:16:48] power the stone which the builders have
[1:16:52] rejected and refused has become the
[1:16:56] headstone of the corner amen it's the
[1:17:00] universal unconditional love that
[1:17:02] remains the same regardless amen of
[1:17:06] circumstances and situations amen that
[1:17:09] is how he loved us and by this shall all
[1:17:13] men know that ye are my disciples if you
[1:17:17] have love one for on
[1:17:20] amen may the Lord had a blessing to the
[1:17:22] reading of his word let us just bow our
[1:17:24] heads in a word of Prayer
[1:17:26] our Heavenly Father we have read your
[1:17:28] word Lord
[1:17:30] any man who can read English and read
[1:17:34] his Bible can read the context of it
[1:17:37] father
[1:17:38] but Lord we asked that the author father
[1:17:42] who wrote the word Lord would come down
[1:17:44] among us Lord and reveal the context
[1:17:48] Lord and reveal the meaning and reveal
[1:17:51] Lord to us that which you have in store
[1:17:54] for us this morning
[1:17:55] Lord we take ourselves out of the way
[1:17:58] and father we ask that you would bless
[1:18:00] your people and may the Spirit of
[1:18:02] Almighty God move from chair to chair
[1:18:06] heart to heart father down in the
[1:18:09] basement in the lower level and out in
[1:18:12] the the yards father may your spirit be
[1:18:16] felt all over the place father for we
[1:18:19] know that there's a prophecy that went
[1:18:21] forth this in itself shall make come to
[1:18:25] pass the tremendous victory and love
[1:18:28] divine father so we don't seek another
[1:18:31] message we don't seek another revelation
[1:18:33] we don't seek another anything this in
[1:18:36] itself shall make come to pass a
[1:18:40] tremendous victory and love divine so
[1:18:43] we're looking for the tremendous victory
[1:18:46] father God victory over ourselves
[1:18:48] victory over Lord anything that would
[1:18:52] keep us from dashing into the presence
[1:18:55] of Almighty God so we ask that you would
[1:18:58] take control of this service and we ask
[1:19:00] it in a wonderful name of Jesus Christ
[1:19:02] amen and amen
[1:19:04] god bless you you may be seated amen
[1:19:07] well over the years I have become a slow
[1:19:10] starter but I trust that God would kick
[1:19:14] us into another gear and just shortly
[1:19:17] here I have to I'm not as young as I
[1:19:21] used to be
[1:19:22] you know I used to run the pulpit all
[1:19:25] around and I still do that from time to
[1:19:28] time
[1:19:28] but the point I want to make today is
[1:19:32] really as I said the title I am the vine
[1:19:36] and ye are the branches
[1:19:38] you know the Prophet said that God had a
[1:19:43] beautiful bride tree on a day of
[1:19:46] Pentecost that was a wonderful tree
[1:19:49] signs wonders and miracles was was
[1:19:52] vindicated you know I mean God I mean he
[1:19:55] didn't just have a church that he called
[1:19:57] the church God himself went with them
[1:20:00] everywhere working amen these signs and
[1:20:04] wonders and miracles amen and no apostle
[1:20:08] no teacher at that time anybody who was
[1:20:11] placed in the body of Christ and God was
[1:20:14] using them never ever to credit for
[1:20:18] anything that God did amen so if that be
[1:20:21] the case God is looking for a group of
[1:20:24] people God is looking for a bride that
[1:20:26] will come back to a place where we can
[1:20:29] get out of the way and God can use us in
[1:20:32] a way that he used the first Apostolic
[1:20:35] Church I think I just think that we just
[1:20:39] get in a way sometime amen and when we
[1:20:42] learn how to get it out of the way then
[1:20:44] God can move and do the things that he
[1:20:46] promised to do amen brother Brad said
[1:20:49] what is a gift a gift is to know how to
[1:20:52] get out of the way praise this wonderful
[1:20:55] name hallelujah
[1:20:56] they were spirit filled and worked and I
[1:21:01] like that spirit fill and word fan the
[1:21:06] Word of God that was in Jesus Christ hey
[1:21:09] man who fed them a mint for three and a
[1:21:12] half years or so in his ministry and
[1:21:14] even though they didn't understand all
[1:21:16] the things that he was speaking but yet
[1:21:19] they were had and it went
[1:21:22] in a form of a see oh listen you may say
[1:21:25] I don't understand what's going on you
[1:21:27] don't have to understand you have to
[1:21:30] just believe what God is saying
[1:21:32] hallelujah
[1:21:34] he never said do you understand he said
[1:21:36] do you believe a man and faith in a man
[1:21:41] the right attitude towards any divine
[1:21:43] promise of God will bring it to pass
[1:21:46] because God said so all repeats are gone
[1:21:50] explain that to me preacher I cannot
[1:21:52] explain it Amen I just believe it
[1:21:55] because God said so there's gonna be a
[1:21:58] dynamics revival God said so there's
[1:22:01] going to be manifestation the sons of
[1:22:03] God God said so I can't explain it
[1:22:05] praise God but I believe it because God
[1:22:08] said so go over be to God the world
[1:22:12] wants an explanation but let me tell you
[1:22:14] something I don't have an explanation
[1:22:16] but I have a faith in my heart praise

[1:22:51] brother branham how he spoke he said
[1:22:53] that Christ was the mystery of God
[1:22:55] revealed all that was in Christ all that
[1:23:00] was in God rather he poured it into
[1:23:02] pranks so he walked the earth as a
[1:23:05] mystery they wanted to know who God was
[1:23:08] they had to go through Christ because he
[1:23:10] was unfolding that great mystery he came
[1:23:13] in the volume of the book
[1:23:15] hallelujah hey glory be to God and

[1:34:20] and the branch should fall off that
[1:34:23] branch dries up this is why I say never
[1:34:31] leave the Word of God never leave the
[1:34:35] original message that was brought to us
[1:34:37] as from Malachi for never leave that
[1:34:41] praise God because it's keeping you

[1:35:22] God that's why I love him that's why I
[1:35:24] praise Him that's why I glorify Him go
[1:35:32] ahead we have to be dependent on the
[1:35:36] Holy Spirit not act like we call equal
[1:35:40] with him hey man we have to be dependent
[1:35:43] on the Holy Spirit no repeats our God
[1:35:46] and the Acts of the early church was
[1:35:49] because Jesus this energy was in the
[1:35:53] Holy Spirit was in them okay
[1:36:02] [Music]
[1:36:05] you have to abide in him and he and you
[1:36:09] the branch comes forth to bring forth
[1:36:13] fruit leaves fruits listen I've seen too
[1:36:21] many branches without fruit even without
[1:36:27] leaves you know the LEAs brother Graham
[1:36:32] says Pentecostal clapping their hands
[1:36:35] but you see I want to let you know that
[1:36:38] the leaves are still part of the tree
[1:36:41] when he restores something he doesn't
[1:36:44] just restored up to the fruit and get
[1:36:46] rid of everything below because now
[1:36:49] we're a fruit time that's how did you
[1:36:51] hear a lot of doctrines like that oh we
[1:36:53] have the fruit we don't need to leave
[1:36:55] and they sit there dead as dead can be
[1:36:58] hey but let me tell you have you seen a
[1:37:01] tree aim it has a little fruit on the
[1:37:04] top and you can't even sit under it and
[1:37:06] get some shade
[1:37:09] the leaves is still part of the tree
[1:37:12] glory be to God hallelujah
[1:37:15] man glory be to God
[1:37:18] it had leaves and had the fruit praise
[1:37:20] God and it had most of all the life now
[1:37:23] listen Amen the original life Amen that
[1:37:29] was in the vine hallelujah manifested
[1:37:36] the fruit of identification I'm talking
[1:37:41] about original branch you want to know
[1:37:44] what a tree is the Bible says by their
[1:37:49] fruits you shall know so the fruit
[1:37:53] identifies the tree and the branch
[1:37:58] cannot do anything without the vine so
[1:38:03] there must be some supernatural power
[1:38:06] pushing out pushing out pushing through
[1:38:10] the branch pushing through the branch
[1:38:12] the next thing you know here's a little
[1:38:14] leaf come out amen thank God for the
[1:38:16] leaves you may not have the fruit yet
[1:38:18] but thank God for the leaf keep pushing
[1:38:21] out and there's another leaf comes out
[1:38:23] don't worry but God ain't meant control
[1:38:26] keep on pushing and keep on pushing
[1:38:28] until the fruit is made manifest and
[1:38:30] that will identify what that tree is
[1:38:37] Luise jesus said the fruit we shall know
[1:38:40] that see the fruit identifies a life in
[1:38:44] the brain in other words he loves fruits
[1:38:57] when we bear much fruit he's glorified
[1:39:02] the fruit is not glorify when we bear
[1:39:05] much fruit then he is glorified
[1:39:08] hallelujah because that's what he put
[1:39:11] the tree therefore to bear fruit that he
[1:39:14] may be gore hot this is why I said
[1:39:20] praise God let's sing that song is a
[1:39:22] life behind name Amen is time that we
[1:39:26] focused back in that life hey man
[1:39:29] hallelujah that life that come that is
[1:39:32] actually in the vine and ye are the
[1:39:35] branches
[1:39:36] amen deceit see because of bride see
[1:39:39] this is bride time and the shuck is dead
[1:39:41] and the virgin word this is work version
[1:39:44] war time see back to the Bible back to
[1:39:46] the original now you can be seated
[1:39:48] because I want to read this quote that
[1:39:50] would probably help you because I am NOT
[1:39:53] just speaking from my mind here I just
[1:39:56] want you to understand where I'm getting
[1:39:58] this from Amen that way you understand
[1:40:01] now the vine doesn't bear fruit does it
[1:40:05] he's asking a question what was he
[1:40:08] talking to the church I am the vine and
[1:40:12] ye are the branches the branches is
[1:40:15] energized by the life of the vine hmm
[1:40:21] hallelujah I'm getting somewhere here
[1:40:23] now therefore Jesus had no lips it's a
[1:40:29] night on earth but mine
[1:40:33] and yours so you see he needs a body he
[1:40:42] needs a man he has no hands but mine and
[1:40:45] yours and he energizes us and we bring
[1:40:50] forth his life as he brings it through
[1:40:57] us whether in preaching the gospel by
[1:41:01] lips or seen visions by I see whether it
[1:41:06] whatever it is laying hands on the sick
[1:41:09] remember there's an energy behind that
[1:41:12] hallelujah whatever it is is Christ
[1:41:15] working through the branch of his church
[1:41:21] every office listen every office
[1:41:26] literally electrified by his presence he
[1:41:36] said isn't it wonderful here we are now
[1:41:38] it's either told I either told the truth
[1:41:42] or a lie if I told the lie
[1:41:44] God will never have anything to do with
[1:41:47] a lie see you know that see if I've told
[1:41:50] the truth then God is obligated to
[1:41:52] vindicate that truth so therefore we are
[1:41:55] speaking about see Christ was working
[1:41:58] through the branch of his church he has
[1:42:03] a church in every office and every in
[1:42:07] every church there are offices and he
[1:42:13] put some apostles some teachers some
[1:42:16] evangelists some prophets etc etc you
[1:42:20] know that there has absolutely nothing
[1:42:21] to do with man
[1:42:26] that's that's the work of God common
[1:42:29] work of God and we are striving to the
[1:42:32] position we please push hoping and you
[1:42:36] know we're in birth pains as it were but
[1:42:41] you see this branch that I'm talking
[1:42:43] about and this vine the vine literally
[1:42:50] electrifies the branch now if you notice
[1:42:55] the branch is energized by the life
[1:43:02] that's in the mine the branch has no
[1:43:06] power in itself remember without the
[1:43:12] vine you are nothing so if a miracle
[1:43:16] takes place it wasn't a branch it was a
[1:43:22] life that come through the vine and into
[1:43:28] the branch that's the energy Amen that
[1:43:32] got places in his church and in every
[1:43:35] office I'm talking about the dynamics
[1:43:40] Amen that hallelujah that knows how to
[1:43:44] turn the word on for too long the word
[1:43:47] has been off you know Amen sure God sent
[1:43:50] a prophet
[1:43:51] amen and he did God use them to the
[1:43:55] mighty works like he's we have never
[1:43:57] seen and the previous generations nor
[1:44:02] this generation but isn't it amazing
[1:44:03] that you go on YouTube and you find old
[1:44:06] timers old timers I don't want to listen
[1:44:09] to some of these young guys that going

[1:45:16] was said in the church ages amen
[1:45:19] some of these ages lasted for hundreds
[1:45:21] of years and the messenger was long gone
[1:45:24] but they were still under the anointing
[1:45:27] of their messenger hallelujah
[1:45:34] which means us nobody they can follow
[1:45:36] there's nobody that can make it more
[1:45:38] clear Holloway and this Malachi 4 was to

[1:45:51] amen reveal the seven thunders amen and
[1:45:55] restore the faith back to the apostolic
[1:45:59] public to think but it'll be these

[1:46:12] time ago I said you know what you preach
[1:46:15] just prophet we preach vindicated
[1:46:19] prophet cause a prophet was vindicated
[1:46:22] by the revelation of the seven seals
[1:46:25] that may him Saint Luke 17 30 holla that
[1:46:30] made him our revelations ten seven
[1:46:33] hallelujah in the days of the voice the
[1:46:37] mystery of God should be finished finish
[1:46:41] why don't people understand what finish

[1:47:11] listen the branch is the body the church
[1:47:14] where the bread have said amen
[1:47:16] so in this body the Holy Ghost uses our
[1:47:20] lips or hands and so forth you see and
[1:47:22] Christ is working through every branch
[1:47:25] and every office literally electrified
[1:47:30] by the presence of God every office

[1:47:42] office apostle teacher could you imagine
[1:47:46] you walk into an office

[1:48:41] between over there walking that office
[1:48:43] flip that switch there is a man that can
[1:48:45] turn on the light every office will be
[1:48:48] electrified with the power of God
[1:48:51] vindicated praise God as I have often
[1:48:55] said it takes a whole lot more than
[1:48:57] going out to the print shop and print in
[1:48:59] your business car to say you are an
[1:49:01] apostle you are a teacher and so forth
[1:49:03] both the the print shop can say it but
[1:49:07] God has got to say there is my spirit

[1:49:53] cannot be Amen an apostle and a teacher
[1:49:57] whatever God has to vindicate that
[1:49:59] himself
[1:50:00] no man can do that but God himself
[1:50:04] [Applause]
[1:50:06] and just to show you that it has nothing
[1:50:08] to do with men Peter had a great idea

[2:02:00] places you can't preach it out where
[2:02:01] they'll pull you right back into the
[2:02:03] pulpit and I'm beginning to feel that
[2:02:06] way now you know what amen there's
[2:02:11] though one more thing I wanted to just
[2:02:14] drop in god bless your rich friend amen
[2:02:18] you see that is my belief but I have to
[2:02:22] stay with this word amen this original
[2:02:26] word which cannot fail you see and all
[2:02:29] that we have been afraid it from and we
[2:02:31] appreciate let me just say this we
[2:02:34] appreciate every man of God everybody
[2:02:36] that have went before us to us better
[2:02:41] understand certain things and give
[2:02:46] credit to where credit is due
[2:02:50] I would like to I would like to believe
[2:02:55] in staying on the positive side we are
[2:02:57] better people today for their works of
[2:03:00] many of these brothers some will say oh
[2:03:03] we're worse whatever but we are better
[2:03:05] people you know we're wiser every trial
[2:03:09] comes your way
[2:03:11] teach us a lesson we knows things today
[2:03:15] that we didn't know years ago and it can
[2:03:19] only make you stronger it can only make
[2:03:22] you more mature if you get you only
[2:03:25] closer to God or mice hallelujah amen
[2:03:30] but anyway I what I was looking at you
[2:03:32] just can't find it right now but what I
[2:03:33] was looking at when brother Branham I
[2:03:37] often wondered in my heart when brother
[2:03:41] Branham was giving the testimony of the
[2:03:46] resurrection of that little fish I want
[2:03:51] you to catch that now the resurrection
[2:03:54] of that little fish little fishy I give
[2:03:58] you your life I always wondered why he
[2:04:04] tied in the voices to that experience
[2:04:10] but if you read it and you could study
[2:04:13] it and you know this story is true he
[2:04:17] said that the Lord told him that there
[2:04:19] was going to be a resurrection of some
[2:04:23] creature see so now just before that
[2:04:28] happened listen brother Branham said an
[2:04:32] anointing and energy come down on the
[2:04:36] lake it was so powerful that those that
[2:04:40] were with him felt oh it is good to be
[2:04:43] here is they almost thought that they
[2:04:44] were being raptured but what did brother
[2:04:49] Graham said he said I couldn't keep from
[2:04:53] uttering those voices
[2:04:55] [Applause]
[2:04:57] and he said it wasn't me it was the vine
[2:05:02] using the branches using thus the Church
[2:05:07] of the Living God that anointing is here
[2:05:12] now by the grace of Almighty God and
[2:05:15] that is my testimony amen everywhere I
[2:05:19] go listen I am not afraid seven thunders
[2:05:25] give faith seven thunders is Brys
[2:05:27] revival because brother Branham said
[2:05:30] that a nice cat cannot skirt around that
[2:05:33] praise God whatever it is it is gospel
[2:05:37] truth even don't you may have your
[2:05:41] opinion about it this and that I don't
[2:05:44] care is gonna happen because it was
[2:05:47] spoken amen and is going to be some
[2:05:51] people say well we have revival all in
[2:05:53] all they men but I'm not talking about
[2:05:55] this you wait to them thunders uttered
[2:05:57] their voices to that point that could
[2:05:59] take the hurt of the time a man handed
[2:06:01] there it'll spice and everything else
[2:06:04] but listen you have got to have the
[2:06:06] right character before he entrusts you
[2:06:09] with that sword
[2:06:10] hey man or else you'll cut the ear off I
[2:06:17] [Applause]
[2:06:19] want to let you know there's nothing
[2:06:21] humanistic about what is about to take
[2:06:24] place
[2:06:25] is totally spiritual Peter said I'll die
[2:06:30] for you oh really
[2:06:31] hey man I'll go to the death will you I
[2:06:34] believe he was honest but he lacked the
[2:06:39] power to do it
[2:06:41] hallelujah and the only thing he had was
[2:06:43] a sword and he cut the ear off Peter put
[2:06:47] your sword away hey man he that uses the
[2:06:49] sword will die by the sword
[2:06:51] hey hey man hallelujah and even Jesus
[2:06:54] hope if my kingdom was of this world my
[2:06:59] people would fight I want to let you
[2:07:02] know your kingdom is not of this world
[2:07:06] so don't get in a fight with people who
[2:07:09] are trying to get you in a fight
[2:07:14] love your brother love your sister amen
[2:07:19] it doesn't mean you agree with them but
[2:07:21] love them anyhow be a better person I
[2:07:25] like what the Bible says he I love him
[2:07:30] because he first that's a big word for
[2:07:34] me
[2:07:35] he first today we say oh I love him if
[2:07:41] we have a whole list of things that we
[2:07:43] want people to make right God had a
[2:07:47] whole list on you I love him because he
[2:07:58] first loved us when what kind of love it
[2:08:01] wasn't filial it wasn't conditional Amen
[2:08:05] it was a couple of unconditional and
[2:08:09] that proves it shows that we are
[2:08:12] expressing the right character and the
[2:08:16] right behavior we don't hate anybody we
[2:08:20] love everybody and everywhere I have
[2:08:22] gone I have preached I have had to
[2:08:24] preach what my conviction is but at the
[2:08:27] end of the day you know what one thing
[2:08:29] that shook me several months ago
[2:08:33] and it's a song I was listening to a
[2:08:35] tape across the banner of time and
[2:08:41] brother Brown said beyond the curtain of
[2:08:44] time where the Branham said nothing but
[2:08:47] perfect love yeah we'll make it there
[2:08:55] he didn't just make that thing he said
[2:08:58] listen me thus sayeth the Lord
[2:09:02] he said because there is nothing but
[2:09:05] perfect teaching perfect revelation so
[2:09:11] in spite of whatever it is that we
[2:09:13] believe whatever we've got to come back
[2:09:15] to that perfect love and that put a new
[2:09:21] perspective in my understanding the
[2:09:30] Bible says love your enemies
[2:09:34] it didn't say you're not going to have
[2:09:37] enemies
[2:09:39] because you have to have enemies to love
[2:09:43] [Music]
[2:09:49] not that you make them enemies but I've
[2:09:53] met some people there predestinated to
[2:09:58] hate you that's that's just about it
[2:09:59] they don't like you they're not
[2:10:01] impressed with you I mean you can do
[2:10:03] somersaults backflips anything else you
[2:10:05] can preach the fire of God down by the
[2:10:08] grace of God they just don't like you
[2:10:14] that's not you see and that is your
[2:10:17] trial to love him to love the unlovable
[2:10:25] when God tell me something when we were
[2:10:29] in the world and when we were not even
[2:10:32] in the position even thinking of God his
[2:10:38] mind was full of us his mind for he was
[2:10:41] mindful of us his mind was full of us
[2:10:45] and he loved us in our conditions only
[2:10:49] God could do that not only only God can
[2:10:53] do that but he's trying to teach his
[2:10:54] church to love the same way because here
[2:11:00] is I'm gonna close now our brother are
[2:11:03] you gonna you know I'm just I do this
[2:11:07] all the time I'm sorry somebody in the
[2:11:10] field was counting how many times I said
[2:11:12] I'm gonna close out I think it was eight
[2:11:15] times or so but listen this let me get
[2:11:19] back to the scripture a new commandment
[2:11:22] I give unto you that you love one
[2:11:26] another as I have loved
[2:11:38] that you also love one another and by
[2:11:43] this by this by what by this love that
[2:11:51] we are Trish by this shall all men know
[2:11:55] that ye are my disciples if you have
[2:12:00] love one for another I'm closing with
[2:12:06] that God bless you let us remember her
[2:12:08] friends we living in a strange time
[2:12:11] we're living in a time that you know
[2:12:15] there's a lot of different opinions and
[2:12:17] things like that but there is a truth as
[2:12:19] sure as there is counterfeit assures
[2:12:21] there's error or whatever some are well
[2:12:26] we have to remember to pray for one
[2:12:28] another because if it wasn't for the
[2:12:30] grace of God we too would be in a
[2:12:32] situation that we cannot so it just
[2:12:36] helped me to understand that we must
[2:12:39] love one another the fighting and all
[2:12:42] the name-calling in it that's not God
[2:12:47] let me tell you something that's not God
