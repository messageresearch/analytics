hallelujah hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the Lord amen are you happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight amen you may be seated for a few minutes amen it's Fallen my lot to greet the church tonight and to welcome us to this special weekend of services how many are happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight in such a time as this and you know the prophet taught us that the angel of the Lord is on the earth now setting things in order for the coming of the Lord he's moving there he's moving all over the world setting things in order and and there are many many meetings and conventions and services and you know just to thing that this weekend is the Easter weekend it's a is that pivotal distinction between Jesus's Ministry and every Prophet who came before because there were many who came before that had testimonies of Miracles and healings and you could look at the life of Elijah and the life of David and the life of Isaiah and you could go through all the scriptures but when Jesus came it was more than a miracle it was more than healing it was more than the sick being healed because he did something that nobody else ever did he laid his life down and he picked it back up again and because of that it is our anchor it is our holding ground is what keeps Us Alive because we were the ones who were supposed to die we were the ones who were supposed to pay the consequence of our actions of our decisions of our thoughts and Jesus came to die for our past our present and our future so that in him and by the blood that was shed we could have life and have it more abundantly and because of him not because of church but because of him not because of a group but because of him we could worship we could praise we could have access to Healing we can have access to Clarity not only on who he is but who we are in him because our identification is based upon him can the church say Amen so tonight we are under great expectation how many appreciate brother the stephanus colen Brena flew all the way to us from Germany and what a true servant of the Lord and I'm under great expectation for the Lord to use him as his microphone to speak to us and to write the prescription of what the doctor ordered that song We Sing The Great physician now is here God is the great doctor he's the great physician and he has a prescription that he could write for whatever need you came here with tonight if it's for one person tonight that needs a prescription from the Lord your coming is not in vain and I believe that the Lord through his servant brother stephanus will speak to our hearts whatever the Lord lays upon his heart I don't know what he's going to speak about but whatever the Lord lays on his heart he believes in that vertical relationship he's not speaking by a group or by what anybody else SS but whatever the Lord put in his heart he knows that he has the permission to speak whatever the Lord puts on his heart because we are one body and by one Spirit we are baptized into that one body where there's one Lord there's one Faith there's one baptism there's one Rapture there's one message and Plan of Redemption there's one road to adoption we are predestinated unto adoption and on that road to adoption and Perfection that grip of sin will be broken off for you that sickness has to be broken off of you that mind battle has to leave your mind Hallelujah the faith and and and and the courage that you're supposed to have as a Believer should be rising every service you might fall one day you might bngs down one day but something inside of you keeps pressing it way it way out as brother Bram said it's that Lily that's pressing its way out and that Lily is only doing what Jesus did because when he died you he couldn't stay dead he had to rise again and the seed in you can't stay dead it has to rise again can the church say Amen so I encourage you be on fire be in the spirit create the right atmosphere so as the word Goes Forth the minister won't even be able to minister this is your service this is your service forget Who's Next to You Forget who's behind you forget who's in front of you if you came looking for the Holy Ghost there's no doubt in my mind uh that you could receive the Holy Ghost tonight if you came looking for a breakthrough there's no doubt in my mind that you could receive the Breakthrough Young Brother young sister I challenge you if you don't know Jesus make it be tonight that you get a personal experience with the Lord friends as he gets ready to come forward don't let this be like any other service this is a crossroad there somebody here tonight at a crossroad a crossroad of life or death we are at a crossroad there's not much time left we at a crossroad and tonight is a night of decision a valley of decision a place of decision make your calling an election sure so may the Lord richly bless you tonight as God's servant makes his way forward let's sing that song only believe only believe it's the song that brother Bram said was his favorite song it's a song that meant so much to him Hallelujah only [Music] be oh [Music] be all things are possible whatever your need is tonight if you you all believe there's some hard cases here tonight there's some hard cases outside oh be come on Mama come on Papa just believe tonight [Music] oh oh s are possible only if you just can do one thing tonight just believe him oh Lord I believe Lord I Bel Lord Jesus in my life father all things are possible Lord what Satan tried to hold back father tonight it's possible Lord because I believe father oh Lord I be Lord Lord I [Music] believe that all things are possible Lord [Music] [Applause] I do you believe do you believe do you really believe that all things are possible there's nothing to heart for the Lord and he has given us a prescription and we will use the prescription and all things will be made whole when Jesus comes all all things are made whole when he came to the lame one all things became whole when he was coming to the blind one the blindness had to leave when he was coming to the sick one the sick one had to leave the sickness had to go because Jesus was there and that woman that touched Jesus Jesus it made a difference in her life may God richly bless you it's a privilege and it's an honor to stand here before you before this church and what can I say I have many experiences in this place where I could touch him where he changed me where he set me free where he brought Deliverance to situations and it's a place of experience for me this place and I believe you can Testify the same that God is not dead but Jesus is alive he's moving Among Us he's moving in and out praise the Lord making the church ready for a resurrection and a rapture he's moving in and out praise the Lord may he move tonight may he move in and out in your heart and in your life so God bless you it's an honor and a privilege I just want to take a short note of greetings and um um brother uh ID your pastor is not here he's in Ivory Coast and I want to greet him and his precious wife here may God richly bless you and it's a privilege to know him your pastor I appreciate him from my heart and our prayers are with him in the convention in Ivory Coast that a fire of God will fall for for another Ministry to come Force that's what we are looking for and I want to greet brother Isaac and your wife sister Karen and the CH and your child God bless you thank you for hosting me in that way appreciate it very much and all the family and uh and the church may God richly bless you it's a privilege in honor and stand before you in this time and the season that God has given it's Easter again praise the Lord you might have many Easter but it's Easter again praise the Lord it speaks about a resurrection it speaks about from Death to life that's what Easter speaks probably praise the Lord amen and I bring special greetings from my wife sister Hannah and my family and my mother and and Johnny and the whole church in odenbach and Alba so God richly bless you amen and uh what can we say we had a great time with brother Isaac than you for sending him over to our church we had a wonderful time with the church and the friends and um in February and we've been very much blessed by his ministry amen and he had two titles have we done enough and it really affected the young people in our church and he was speaking about the real you on a Monday Tuesday Wednesday about the real you and he came with a burden amen and the second service was the time has come for the manifestation of the Life of Christ and that's what I'm contenting to brother Isaac for a manifestation of the Life of Christ in the life of in my life in the life of the heart of the people praise the Lord and we were blessed we were blessed we were blessed H amen praise the Lord amen what can we say Amen it's Easter again amen and uh so let me let me just take a start amen and just want to say thank you brother Isaac you just said a prescription praise the Lord and there's one prescription I want to talk tonight on this Good Friday there's one prescription that is given to the Church of the Living God and that is the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I want to speak about the name of the Lord Jesus Christ what it has done what it's doing and what it will still do praise the Lord amen so we want to give him the give God the glory and H give glory to his name praise the Lord as we have sang the song glory to his name there at the cross was the blood applied praise the Lord but glory to his name thank God for Friday but glory to his name praise the thank God for the blood thank God for the sacrifice thank God that he paid the price for us but glory to his name thank God for deliverance thank God for healing but all to all glory to his name praise the Lord there at the cross was the blood applied praise the Lord and brother brandham he says he says that body he said that body is already judged praise the Lord the Judgment that was for our sake he took the Judgment upon him and he said and we when we are baptized into the body into this body he said then this body is already charged and we don't have to go to judgment because the body is already judged it was judged at Calvary praise the Lord that's why the bride is not coming into judgment because the body is already judged amen praise the Lord and as brother brand him he said in the message he said the Wrath of God the Wrath think about it the Wrath God has a wrath do I pronounce it right the Wrath the Wrath about Sin it it caused a wrath to God and he said and he took the wrath of God was upon him the sacrifice but this rra were the rra for our sake that was the rra for our sin that was the rra for our failures that was the wrath for our wrongdoing and Jesus said I take that wrath I take the sin and I take the wrath of God of me of God on me praise the Lord and let this body be judged because there's a bride of Jesus Christ that will be judged Hallelujah I took the Judgment I took the rra I took the sickness I took the sin the sin question is settled hallelujah praise the Lord praise the Lord amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord and um I want to come and just want to open the scripture and uh I want to go to Philippians 2 hallelu Glory hallu praise the Lord and uh praise the Lord I want to speak about the name of the Lord Jesus Christ tonight and uh I had it since New Year I had it with a burden upon my heart to speak one day about the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and maybe we get another understanding about the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I looked in the message in the table and I typed in the name Jesus 30,48 85 times the prophet mentioned the name of Jesus 30,000 30,000 484 times it means every 30 33 times every message he mentioned the name of Jesus how often are we using the name of Jesus in our own life the cross of Jesus made a way that we can use the name of Jesus Christ in a way you we never thought of and I want to go into it it's good Friday 30,000 times the name of Jesus in the Bible it's used 943 times times in the New Testament 35 times each book The Name of Jesus Christ in Psalm 96 David says give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name there's a glory to this name and I want to speak about it tonight help us oh god of our salvation for the glory of thy name and Deliver Us and Purge away our sins for thy name's sake praise the Lord and that name was manifested praise the Lord not unto us not unto us Lord but unto thy name give glory and tonight we want to give him the glory we want to give glory to this name praise the Lord and brother bam says since Calvary we are invited to share his glory and it's the glory of his name we are invited tonight to share this Glory that means you become a part of this Glory of his name praise the Lord Philippians 2 verse 5 a familiar scripture let his mind be in you which was also in Christ hoping in the form of God sought it not sings not only on the earth in the Earth but under the Earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father praise the Lord amen it's a name above all names that is given to us praise the Lord every tongue every knee shall bow down before this name praise the Lord because of a good Friday because he was obedient unto death praise the Lord that that's why his name was above all names Colossians 3:1 17 [Music] hallelu and now we break it down to you and Paul says whatever you do all right whatever you do on a Sunday when you worship him when you pray to him when you love him whatever you do when you go to job when you go through your tribulation whatever you do he said whatever you do in word or deed do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ everything every action that you do you do it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we check ourselves have you done enough have you done everything in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ or are there some Potentials in our life where we can do more in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is there more land to possess in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is there more things that we can do in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I say there's more to it that we can do in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because every knee every Power every situation has bowed down before that name praise the Lord there's more land to possess praise the Lord amen second thessalonica 1 last scripture and then we go into the message praise the Lord second thessalonica 1:1 wherefore we also pray always for you that's Paul he says I'm praying for you he says I'm praying for you for three things that our God would first count your worthy of this calling how can you be called worthy except his righteousness comes for your righteousness that's the only one only thing and he took your he took your your just man your your Justice he took it on Calvary that his righteousness can come upon Him upon you praise the Lord and count you worthy of this calling and fulfill all the good pleasures of his goodness praise the Lord that speaks about a Sanctified life praise he's fulfilling all the good pleasures of his goodness and fulfill the work of face with power what does the scripture says you

praise the Lord what did the name of Jesus Christ do it released the power of God if you call the name of Jesus it's releasing something and I want to speak tonight what it's releasing praise the Lord hallelujah and to know what it's releasing let me go to Calvary on a good Friday he was the word and the Word was made flesh and in that body that was broken there was a stream of blood is that right and that blood was not human blood that blood was a created blood cell by God the Father it was spoken word creation that was a blood cell created by God it was not a human blood it was a blood of Supernatural blood and that was running like a stream in Jesus praise the Lord praise the Lord and that blood was operating the word and the Word was made flesh flesh and the blood was operating in the word and the Word was made flesh and he dwelt Among Us Jehovah all seven compound names in a manifestation but it was a blood in that name there was a blood running through Jesus Christ praise the Lord amen praise the Lord now what happened at a cross praise the Lord at that cross brother brandham says at that pro at that cross the blood cell was broken hallu in the message the token brother Bram he said we handled God the Bible said first timothius 37 without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was made manifest in flesh the body was God certainly it was he was God all over in the form of a human being and the blood was running through that blood through that body now we notice in this the blood cell being broken on a good Friday the blood cell was broken and brother BR said it released God on Calvary the blood cell was released in God all the attributes of God it was released and the blood cell was broken for what why was the blood cell broken because he said there's a bride that needs this Blood this blood is not only for me but this blood is for Sons and Daughters of God praise the Lord Hall so the blood cell had to be broken now in all the for the blood
