For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us forever. Grace be with you. and mercy and peace from God the Father. And now I beseech thee, Lady, not as so I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but it which we had from the beginning, that we love one another. And this love that we walk after the commandments. And this is love that we walk after his commandments. Father, make us more like thee. Elect lady, elected lady. I call you elected lady that walk in his commandment to be more like this, more like him, not more like your neighbor, not more like your boss, not more like your pastor, not more like this or this one, not more like the heroes. But Lord, there's only one. &gt;&gt; I want to be more like &gt;&gt; as the elected lady &gt;&gt; chosen before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Say, Lord, I want to be more like you. Speak to me tonight. &gt;&gt; You know my needs. &gt;&gt; You know what we need. &gt;&gt; May you speak to us. May you bring your bride together. &gt;&gt; The elected lady. No one &gt;&gt; can take this election away. &gt;&gt; May be seated for just a moment. &gt;&gt; Our sister was singing, "Lead me Lord." This is your desire. Lead me Lord. &gt;&gt; I will follow. &gt;&gt; I will go every door you open. I will go. I just want to greet you everyone who came to this meetings. May God richly bless you and be with you. May this meeting be something that something that is inside of you will get bigger. We get more fiery for the Holy Ghost. We get much deeper in the love of God. We got greater and at what he will perform. something that we can go out of this weekend and said, "Not only our hearts burned, but my life is changed. It brought me closer to him. I'm more like him. I LOVE HIM MORE. LORD, WHATEVER you want, make me more. May it be multiplied and replenished in this weekend. THIS IS THE WEEKEND TO multiply and replenish what is inside of you." &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Before we invite our precious brother oit, &gt;&gt; brother Brandham says &gt;&gt; now here listen a human has to worship. &gt;&gt; A human is not to be quiet. &gt;&gt; BROTHER SAYS A HUMAN HAS TO WORSHIP. &gt;&gt; He says you have to worship something. &gt;&gt; YOU IT'S JUST IN YOU TO WORSHIP. So a human has to worship something. &gt;&gt; So they and brother Brandham said in in the art wall 64. So in the churches they had no worship in their church. So God raised them up a nut. Elvis Presley a pat bone. They still hold on their testimony. Elvis and Pentecost and Pat bone and Christ of church. They absolutely not fulfill Jesus words here. But he said there's something in you to worship. &gt;&gt; So God raised up some nuts that they have something to worship. But here IS THE ELECT OF GOD, &gt;&gt; THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST WITH SOMETHING IN THEIR HEART TO WORSHIP HER SAVIOR, HER REDEEMER, HER BRIDEGROOM. WE HAVE ENOUGH TO WORSHIP HIM. WE HAVE ENOUGH BECAUSE IT'S INSIDE OF YOU TO WORSHIP HIM. [applause and cheering] HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Brother Stephanos, how can we worship? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham in a prayer. Revelation chapter 5 part two. And as we come humbly, watch out &gt;&gt; and may God do it tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Before the word comes for us, a short quick word. As we come humbly, we ask that you lay from our minds. He didn't say you lay from our minds. HE SAID THAT YOU, LORD JESUS, LAY FROM OUR MINDS AND OUR HEARTS ALL THINGS OF THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; LORD, may you lay them away all the toils OF LIFE. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TOILS OF LIFE. YOU HAVE TOILS OF LIFE. I HAVE TO OF LIFE. EVERY ONE OF US HAS TOILS OF LIFE. BUT LORD, MAY YOU LAY THEM AWAY, FATHER. [applause] &gt;&gt; And the worries, every worry, Lord, may you lay it aside. And that you after that he lays it aside. Oh God will put us IN THE STATE OF WORSHIP. &gt;&gt; LORD, may you take the toils. MAY YOU TAKE THE WORRIES. YOU SAID ALL THINGS WORK TOGETHER FOR GOOD. I WILL BE WITH YOU. I WILL BE IN WORSHIP. ALL WORRIES AWAY. PRAISE THE LORD. LORD, FOR WHAT? AND THEN AFTER THAT, OH GOD, WILL YOU PUT US IN THE STATE OF WORSHIP THAT WE MIGHT WORSHIP thee through the hearing of thy word. SO BROTHER OID WHILE THE WORLD GOES FORTH IN OUR HEARTS, IN OUR MINDS, NO MORE WORRIES. This is TAKEN AWAY. JESUS PAID ON THE CROSS. THE PRICE IS PAID. He put us in a state of worship as we hear the word. May God richly bless you. May God bless you. [applause] Praise the Lord. The meeting is on. It's time to worship him, King Lamb. Praise [cheering] the Lord. [applause] Amen. Are you ready? as the elect lady. [applause] The elect lady. NO ONE CHOOSE YOU BUT YOUR BRIDEGROOM. &gt;&gt; NO ONE CHOOSES MY WIFE. I CHOOSED HER. &gt;&gt; NO ONE TOLD ME, STEPHANUS, YOU GOT TO MARRY HER. HERE YOU ARE. BUT I CAME TO HER AND SAID, I WANT TO MARRY YOU. &gt;&gt; She's my ELECTED LADY AND YOU ARE HIS ELECTED. HE CAME FOR YOU. HE CALLED YOU BY NAME. HE SAID, "I ELECTED YOU, PREDESTINATED YOU. YOU WILL ADORE ME IN A STATE YOU NEVER KNOW BEFORE." [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; May God bless you. &gt;&gt; And as the elect lady, &gt;&gt; I have one testimony of elect lady. &gt;&gt; She walks in the way of her husband. &gt;&gt; We walk in the light. &gt;&gt; The elect lady is not working walking in darkness. And she's not working in darkness, &gt;&gt; but she's walking in the light. &gt;&gt; It transforms her &gt;&gt; like a seed like a plant gives transformation by that light as the elect lady. Are you ready for the word? &gt;&gt; You're not going to hear from Lord Oit, &gt;&gt; but I believe tonight you're going to hear from your bridegroom. Amen. &gt;&gt; From Christ through his word, speaking to his elect. May God richly bless you. Appreciate everyone that came, but oh, God bless you. It's a privilege and honor. [applause] [music] We had your son here and it made a change. We had Holy Ghost pouring sounds. where baptism in the pool by that ministry where people got changed life by it. But I'm so glad I've been many times in Trinidad. But it's a privilege to have you here in this in this small place with elected [music] part of the elected pride. May God richly bless you. [applause] Oh, shine all [singing] [music] around me by day and [singing] by night. It's Jesus [music] the [singing] light of. May we sing it like this. I walk in the light. I walk in the I don't care about [music] your state. The light is around you. He's here [music] and we can walk. God bless you. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Jesus the light [singing] of [music] the world. One more time we walk in the light. Oh, [music] we walk. Oh, such a beauty. [music] Oh, [singing] comes when [music] the two drops of mercies bright shine all around us by day [singing and music] and by night. Oh Jesus, let's bow our heads [music] for a prayer. Heavenly Father, we thank you for your presence and thank you for this opportunity to be here and how we have been in this land for many many years uh knowing brother Ziggma [music] and seeing the fruit of his labor and the work here. I pray it touch his wife in a special way and bless the family and bless the Phillas and his wife and family in the church here in a special way tonight. As we come to your word, Lord, may you be with us and take me out of the way and be glorified in our midst in Jesus name I [music] ask it. Amen and amen. God bless you. Have a seat. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. [applause] &gt;&gt; I want to greet you in Jesus name. I want to greet Sister Irene in a special way. God bless you. Uh certainly appreciate being here. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Uh yeah, forgive me a little bit for being a little emotional, but uh but Ziggman and I uh we went a long way and um I remember when he told me as a young man to take care of my family and um I receive him as a like an angel from the Lord. So I feel really blessed to be here tonight and I would see what the Lord will do and I am believing that God will work wonderfully among us tonight. Um uh I know him uh to be a genuine Christian, a genuine believer, a man who genuinely love the Lord. And you know God is not adopting the office. God is not adopting a position. God is adopting a man. &gt;&gt; I want to repeat that. So the titles means nothing. &gt;&gt; Whether it's pastor, apostle or teacher, evangelist, doctor, lawyer is who is behind that title. &gt;&gt; But life is behind that title is more important to God because when Saul failed, God told Samuel, I have found a better man. And God is always looking for better men &gt;&gt; is not what we do is who we are &gt;&gt; more than what we do. &gt;&gt; So who you are have to do with your character &gt;&gt; your person your inner being. And this is to me is what God looking for a man who heart is after God. &gt;&gt; So tonight if you want to stand we want to read three portion of scripture. One Ephesians 4 4-6. 1 Corinthians 12:13 and Colossians 1 17-18 reading Ephesians 4 reading from verse four there is one body and one spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling one Lord one fate one baptism one God and father of all who is above all and through all and in you all. &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 12:13. &gt;&gt; For by one spirit are we all baptized into one body. Whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit. And our last scripture from Colossians chapter 1, reading verse 17. And he is before all things, and by him all things consist. And he's the head of the body, the church, who is the firstborn, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things he might have the preeminences. Let's pray one more time. Heavenly Father, I thank you for your word. And may you come now and bless it and interpret it to hearts of your people and confirm your word with signs. wonders and miracles I ask in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen and amen. God bless you. May have a seat. Praise God. I want to greet the ministers here tonight. God or bless my brother and all the others. We certainly appreciate you all being here and we are grateful to have fellowship one with another. So tonight I have a title, one body, one spirit. &gt;&gt; One head. That's the title tonight. One body, &gt;&gt; one spirit, one head of a subject, the body fitly joined together. And I have an inspiration recognizing Christ alone as the head of the bridebody. The Bible call it he is the head of the body called the church. So the church is not this building. The church is not displaced. &gt;&gt; The church is a body &gt;&gt; and by one spirit &gt;&gt; we are baptized into that what but one body. &gt;&gt; So the vision that brother Brandham brought this prophetic vision that the prophet brought he said I did not come to build another denomination. &gt;&gt; I came to build individuals &gt;&gt; into the stature of a perfect man. &gt;&gt; So he had a vision. It was a prophetic vision because this body was being formed through seven ages. &gt;&gt; This bright body and this body was a hidden mystery. &gt;&gt; Nobody knew but there was a hidden mystery but the prophet came to reveal it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. You may be seated. Brother Brandham, the importance of revelation by the spirit to a true believer can never be overemphasized. He is saying he's not talking about the book of revelation. He is talking about all revelation. &gt;&gt; Now when Jesus asked his disciples who do men say I the son of man am they shared with him what men were saying but when he turned to his own disciples that had books and tastes for three and a half years that heard him for all these years they didn't know. And Peter broke through and said, "Do the Christ." And these were Jesus words. Flesh and blood had not revealed this unto you, &gt;&gt; but my father in heaven hath revealed it unto you, &gt;&gt; and upon this rock, &gt;&gt; I will build &gt;&gt; my church. &gt;&gt; Now today, people go to groups, churches, fellowships, hear things, believe things. But the question is do you have a revelation &gt;&gt; of what you are hearing? &gt;&gt; Do you have a revelation of what you believe? Because only the Holy Ghost could give you revelation. &gt;&gt; Only the Holy Ghost give revelation. &gt;&gt; Now the devil himself fought worship. &gt;&gt; He fights worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just like what what Brother Stephanus was saying to create the atmosphere of worship because in worship you are in the spirit &gt;&gt; and in the spirit the spirit could reveal things &gt;&gt; but if you're not in the spirit you will just be hearing intellectually. &gt;&gt; So you have to press your way &gt;&gt; and fight your way &gt;&gt; to get in the spirit to get in the atmosphere. And once you get in the atmosphere, Holy Ghost could reveal to you &gt;&gt; himself. &gt;&gt; And revelation &gt;&gt; is prevailing power. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Revelation &gt;&gt; is prevailing power. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. So brother Abraham said this way. You may be seated. Flesh and blood had not revealed it, but my father had revealed it. And upon this rock revelation, I will build my church. The church is built on the revelation on thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; So you realize now a lot of people don't have the revelation they claim to have &gt;&gt; because when testing time come, they fall apart. &gt;&gt; Revelation make you stand. &gt;&gt; Revelation makes you revelation make you stand flatfooted. &gt;&gt; If the Lord deliver me, that's fine. If he will not deliver me, I will not bow down. &gt;&gt; I will still serve him. I will still praise him. I'm not going to give up. I'm not going to backslide. I'm not going to let go &gt;&gt; because I have revelation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You be seated. Revelation make you stand anywhere, &gt;&gt; anytime. &gt;&gt; I want to say it again. Revelation make you stand. &gt;&gt; Revelation give you power. &gt;&gt; Revelation give you authority. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. Because revelation is a substance. &gt;&gt; It's not imagination. &gt;&gt; It's not memory. &gt;&gt; It's a actual substance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You may be seated. When Abraham got a revelation of Isaac, &gt;&gt; he had Isaac in his heart. &gt;&gt; His wife, God didn't speak to her. God didn't reveal himself to her. So Sarah didn't have a revelation. But Abraham had a revelation. &gt;&gt; But he can't show it. &gt;&gt; He can't get it out. He can't tell people, "Look at Isaac. Look at his face. Look at his picture." No, it's in him. &gt;&gt; It's a vision. &gt;&gt; It's an inspiration. &gt;&gt; It's a revelation. &gt;&gt; Now, Abraham knew that God said through Sarah, you're going to have that son. &gt;&gt; Sarah had her own ideas, but Abraham knew it's true Sarah. &gt;&gt; So, he can't divorce Sarah. Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. He can't put away Sarah. &gt;&gt; He can't get vexed with Sarah. I don't want Sarah. Sarah's too old. No, he knew &gt;&gt; by Revelation. &gt;&gt; It's through Sarah. &gt;&gt; So, he had to be in harmony. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; With Sarah &gt;&gt; to keep this thing going &gt;&gt; for 25 years. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And God has been checking us out &gt;&gt; to see how we have been going &gt;&gt; for all these years. And we LIKE ABRAHAM STAGGERED NOT AT THE promise of God &gt;&gt; through unbelief but we are holding on &gt;&gt; to our promise &gt;&gt; of dynamics &gt;&gt; to the mechanics. &gt;&gt; WE ARE HOLDING ON &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD CAN'T LIE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WE ARE HOLDING ON BECAUSE God can't lie. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So remember the Holy Ghost alone &gt;&gt; is the revealer of the divine revelation of Christ. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Don't ever forget that. &gt;&gt; So no man could claim uh I could reveal this to you. &gt;&gt; No, he could speak it to you. &gt;&gt; He could express it to you. But the Holy Ghost alone, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; is the revealer. Amen. I remember when I first read the message serpent seed that was scary and the devil used to bang my mind and I started to wonder what if I'm a serpent seed and I all kind of thoughts and one day I got a revelation of my sunship &gt;&gt; and when I got that &gt;&gt; the devil never brought that thought back to my mind &gt;&gt; because I know I'm a son &gt;&gt; and once a always a son. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Once a son, always a son. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the prophet said God is known by simplicity and of revelation of Jesus Christ in the most illiterate person. So that means revelation bypasses your intellect. &gt;&gt; So that's why you say illiterate person, a person who cannot read and cannot write could get revelation. &gt;&gt; Because revelation bypass this here and drops down inside of here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So revelation make you speak from your heart. &gt;&gt; You're not a hypocrite. &gt;&gt; You're not a Pharisee. You speak from what's on the inside. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You're walking in love from the inside, &gt;&gt; not mental. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; So, but also said by lack of this revelation is why we have so much different divisions. So, divisions are not caused by revelation. Divisions are caused by lack of revelation. Because if we have revelation, we will see there is one Lord. &gt;&gt; There is one faith. There is one baptism. THERE IS ONE BODY. THERE IS ONE SPIRIT. AND WE ONLY HAVE ONE HEAD. &gt;&gt; OH, glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Our head is not in Europe. Our head is not in America or South America or Africa or in the Caribbean. Our head is Christ. &gt;&gt; He is the head &gt;&gt; of the body called the church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He is the magnet &gt;&gt; THAT GOING TO MAGNETIZE US &gt;&gt; to take us out of here. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Do you get that now? &gt;&gt; He is our magnet &gt;&gt; that going to pull us up. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. Note, [snorts] so far in all what we have said, man is out the picture. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Man is out the picture. Revelation comes from heaven. &gt;&gt; The what? The Christ. Isn't that right? He is the head of the body &gt;&gt; called the church. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; And there is only one body. &gt;&gt; Not an African body, a European body and an American body. There's only one body. &gt;&gt; And to get into that body is one spirit. &gt;&gt; Not two spirits. Not not a Caribbean spirits and African spirit and a European. No, one spirit. &gt;&gt; And that spirit make everyone in the body behave the same way. Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That spirit IS FIRE. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OUR GOD IS A CONSUMING FIRE. &gt;&gt; THAT SPIRIT WILL MAKE YOU WORSHIP &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD IS THE OBJECT OF WORSHIP. &gt;&gt; HEY. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; That spirit &gt;&gt; would move you &gt;&gt; and influence you. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises tonight. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God. [applause and cheering] You may be seated. We all have our own human spirit. &gt;&gt; We all have our own food taste &gt;&gt; that is allowed by God. You have your kind of food and dish. The Chinese will have it. The Europers will have it. Everybody have their own thing. That's a human spirit. But the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; is higher than all of that. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Our human spirit have nothing to do with the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Actually, God gave us a new spirit to work with the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A new heart I will give you. &gt;&gt; A new spirit I will give you. And then I WILL PUT MY SPIRIT &gt;&gt; into your spirit. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Because the spirit that we have cannot work with the spirit of God until God changes it. &gt;&gt; So he has to give us a new spirit, &gt;&gt; a new heart towards God. A spirit that could work with his spirit. And in that context for us to work with loving into his love. &gt;&gt; If you note that brotherly kindness come after godliness. And to be in godliness is to be like God. But yet the word became flesh and dwell among us. Yet with godliness, we still need the brotherly kindness on top of that that we could express this love to our brethren because Jesus demonstrated it and say by this shall all men know that you are my disciples when you could have this love. If you notice right on top of brotherly kindness is holy spirit. So to access holy spirit you have to come through forgiveness. You have to come through dropping yours, forgiving your brother, forgiving your sister, letting things go. &gt;&gt; Hey, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You be seated. You know, I said something in France and something struck me about the woman who was caught in the act of adultery and how something could go from public to private. And when they were trying to test Jesus, they said this woman was caught and she should be stoned according to Moses law. And Jesus said, "Amen. A I'm not here to fight Moses law, but just before you stone, which one of you without sin cast the first stone?" And I love what Jesus did. He didn't watch them, shame them, embarrass them, belittle them, abuse them, rebuke them. He did not. He turned his back to them and he be to write. We don't know what he was writing. Maybe he's writing faith, virtue, knowledge. I don't know what he was writing. He was writing something. But one by one, each one left. &gt;&gt; And then when he turned around, he said, "Woman, where are your accusers? When she looked, she saw no one. So here it was. Everybody knew what she did. Everybody was there as a witness. And now all of a sudden, they're gone. And Jesus said, "Neither do I condemn thee. Go and sin no more." In other words, he released her from her past, her shame, her guilt. She knew, listen, by revelation, his pardon and his love &gt;&gt; and his grace. &gt;&gt; Nobody else was there to see that. So she was to walk back home knowing that she has been released, knowing that she has been set free. Knowing nobody else know about that. No other church person. Nobody knows. No, you have to know that by revelation. You have to know you have been released. You have to know you are forgiven. You have to know his pardoning grace has to be extended to you. That's the Jesus that I serve. That's the Jesus I want to see. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Now this five-fold ministry according to Ephesians 4:11, apostles, prophets and so forth, they have a purpose. The Bible said the perfection of the saints for the work of the ministry, the edifying of the body till we all come in the unity of the faith. So there is going to be a unity of the faith. Not a unity of groups, not a unity of churches, not a unity of fellowships. No, a unity of the faith. Because there is only one Lord and there's only one faith. There's only one baptism. A unity of default. And William Brham came to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers. So we have to turn back, pick up the father's faith, and then come back and go to the rapture with rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. We have to we have to go back and pick up what they had because they had the original fate. &gt;&gt; How many understand that tonight? &gt;&gt; So, but Abraham didn't come to bring something new. He came to get us back to the original because you cannot change the original. The original is the original seed. WHAT WE ARE HAVING, LISTEN, WHAT WE HAVING NOW IS A REPRODUCTION of the original grain. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS HAPPENING now is a reproduction of the original grain. &gt;&gt; Now the prophets the the Bible says speaking the truth in love. Okay. So watch that we hencefor children. You may be seated. So this five for ministry is to assist the bride to come into spiritual maturity because if you are child you are not air until they come into maturity. So God don't want babes and children and pumpers and and and baby bottle and shaking and rocking and crying everything you only crying crying. God don't want that. God want spiritual maturity that you could handle your stuff. &gt;&gt; That you could handle your issues &gt;&gt; that you could face to your challenges. This is what spiritual maturity is about. In Galatians it said if a child a child is under tutors and governors until the time appointed. So even though all the land is yours or houses and money and everything is yours, you still have to wait until you're committed to that maturity. And waiting means you're under tutorship. You're under guidance. You're under leadership. This is what the ministry is all about to bring you into discipline. That's a word people don't like to use. [snorts] They want to just sit on the bench and go in the rapture. Oh, glory. It's not working that way. But a Brandon was brought into discipline. He lost his wife. He lost his child. He lost the anointing. He was brought into discipline by his experiences, by hard trials and harder trials. And it brought him into a shape just how God wanted him. So sometimes we have questions and I want you to let go of those questions and say, "God, have your own way. No more questions. You just have your own way in my life. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU KNOW WHY I'M GOING THROUGH THIS AND I BELIEVE YOU THAT ALL THINGS will work together for my good because I love God to them who are the called according to his purpose. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So this five-fold ministry will not be men's ministry. You may be seated. This five-fold ministry will be Jesus ministry in men. I know the devil trying to slash and and execute and get rid of a five-fold ministry and just play tapes. But there's a genuine five-fold ministry because the same God say, "Behold, I send you Elijah the prophet and it had flesh on it called William Brham." It's the same God that said THERE'LL BE A FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY. IT HAVE TO HAVE SOME FLESH ON IT. &gt;&gt; OH, give the Lord some praises. The same God THAT SAY I SEND YOU ELIJAH AND PUT WILLIAM Brandon flesh on that scripture is the same God will take Ephesians 4 and put flesh on that scripture. Apostles, prophets, teachers, evangelists, God himself would put flesh on those scriptures and make it come alive and make it real. And our bride will be edified. Our bride will be strengthened. OUR BRIDE WILL BE INSPIRED. OUR BRIDE WILL BE ANOINTED BECAUSE GOD WILL TAKE THAT AND MAKE IT ALIVE. OH, give the Lord some praises tonight. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. Now the body is not one. Your body is not a nose. You're not smelling alone. Your body is not eyes. You're not seeing alone. The body is a complex thing. &gt;&gt; It have eyes. It have ears. It have nose. It have mouth. Now if the nose say or the mouth say I the eyes say I don't like being in front. I want to go behind. I want to see what going on behind. So I I I I I I don't want to be in front anymore. We we have problems. So the bride body &gt;&gt; is a body. &gt;&gt; It's not one member. &gt;&gt; It's not one hand. Your body is not a hand. You have hands. You have feet. You have head. You have neck. Your body is a complex thing. The bride body is a complex thing. It's a body that's around the world. It's a international body. By one spirit you can't see into that body. You are baptized into that body as an individual. &gt;&gt; But it's the body of Christ. But the Bible said from whom the whole body fitly joined together. &gt;&gt; So at some point in time it has to join. &gt;&gt; It has to connect. We have to respect and recognize that you are my brother. You are my sister and we are part of this great glorious body. You can't put me out and I can put you in and I can put you out and you can put me in. Do you understand what I'm saying? Because it's one glorious body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. GLORY TO GOD. IT'S ONE BODY. [applause] HALLELUJAH. My God. My God. Brother Brandon says, "Dear brother, sister, there's only one church and that's the body of believers out of every church that are true believers in our Lord Jesus Christ. That's the only church there is. We do not come into church in the church of God. We become into this fellowship. Aha. Place it. When you come to a group, a lot of ministers don't don't don't think that. They think they own the people. They think they're controlling the group. When you come into a group, you come into a fellowship. This is a fellowship. But when you come in by the spirit, you come into the body. &gt;&gt; It's not the same. &gt;&gt; What we are having tonight is a fellowship. All the churches, all the churches around the world, they're having fellowship. He said in there you get good, bad, renegade, all kind of people in the church. Now, some ministers believe their church higher than others, better than others, top top and so on. That is foolishness. That is not what the program taught. And that shows they don't believe the message &gt;&gt; because he taught us that in the church I'm good, &gt;&gt; bad, &gt;&gt; renegades, all kind of types &gt;&gt; in the church. BUT THAT IS CHURCH. THAT'S NOT THE BODY. THAT'S THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And let me say something strong here. Now, there's a five-fold in the body and there's a five-fold out of the body. It's two different things all together &gt;&gt; in the body is for the body. &gt;&gt; So there is no selfishness. There is no self motive. There is no selfpropelling. And you want your kingdom and you want your ministry and you want that and you want to do this. There is no politics because Christ have no politics. &gt;&gt; Leave that for the politician. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YOU may receive it. The book of Acts wasn't the acts of men. Yes, &gt;&gt; it was the acts of the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; in men. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [applause] THOSE MEN WERE LED BY THE HOLY GHOST. MOVED BY THE HOLY GHOST. ANOINTED WITH THE HOLY GHOST. NOBODY stopped them. DIDN'T HAVE TO ASK PERMISSION. SHOULD I go here? Should I go here? Should I fellowship with this one? SHOULD I SHAKE HAND WITH THIS ONE? They had no confusion whatsoever. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. They were in one mind. THEY WERE IN ONE ACCORD. THEY HAD ONE VISION. THEY SAW ONE BODY. THEY HAD ONE HEAD. &gt;&gt; AND THEY HAD ONE SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; OH, GIVE THE LORD a shout. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Let me see. And I'm saying tonight, &gt;&gt; every kingdom of man will fall. &gt;&gt; We see empires fall. &gt;&gt; We see the French Empire fall. We see the British Empire fall. We saw the Roman Empire fall. And you're seeing American Empire falling in slow motion. &gt;&gt; In real in real time, &gt;&gt; you're seeing a whole empire fall. Amen. &gt;&gt; Daniel saw a stone. &gt;&gt; That stone wasn't cut out by some technological company. &gt;&gt; That stone was cut out &gt;&gt; without hands. &gt;&gt; God cut that stone. &gt;&gt; And when God cut that stone, he struck the image and kingdoms begin to fall. Well, a stone is coming and we are waiting for that storm. &gt;&gt; A rock is coming and we are waiting for that rock. Dynamics is coming and we are WAITING FOR DYNAMICS. RAIN IS coming and we are waiting for that rain. The same rain that float Noah boat &gt;&gt; act kill the people and B said the same Holy Ghost we are worshiping and it will kill the people same Holy Ghost. Don't forget this church saints the same God that brought out two million people kill them. &gt;&gt; Let me repeat that. The same God that brought two million people out of Egypt is the same God that killed them because of unbelief. &gt;&gt; It's not a game. It's not because we have to spoke with books. We are in the bride. It's not like that. &gt;&gt; It's a little more than that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. The books means nothing if we don't apply it. &gt;&gt; The tapes means nothing if we don't apply it. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WE HAVE GOT TO APPLY IT &gt;&gt; to our own lives. &gt;&gt; May be seated. &gt;&gt; Noah had it rough because for 120 years he is building an ark preaching revelation. He have the drawings that God gave him. He have the specification. Noah can't feel led. God tell me 20 ft but I'm going to make it 10 feet. It can't work. &gt;&gt; It has to be according to what God said. We have to understand that God can't lie. God makes no mistake. You are not here by chance tonight. You are not a mistake. &gt;&gt; Don't ever let the devil tell you that you are a mistake. There is no mistake about you. There's no mistake around you. There is no mistake about you. [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You are predestinated &gt;&gt; to face the challenge of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You will be seated. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Huh? In this hour, God needs special men, &gt;&gt; special women. &gt;&gt; Call them special forces. &gt;&gt; He can't take any anybody. He has to take special people. That's why he called you to deal and to handle with what you have to deal with. &gt;&gt; No other age is so difficult as this age. You're still alive. &gt;&gt; You're not dead. &gt;&gt; You have activity in your limbs. &gt;&gt; You can still raise your hands. YOU CAN STILL SAY HALLELUJAH. YOU CAN STILL WORSHIP. GOD PUT YOU HERE FOR THAT. &gt;&gt; OH, praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [applause] &gt;&gt; Maybe season it. When you look at technology now, you can't help but wonder if God allow man to continue, where will he go? He will try to make manual. He will say, "Let us make manual." These guys, their intelligence and wisdom and wherever they're getting the source from is next level. So that is why God send them the eyes and after that is the intelligence. Now what they have now is AI artificial intelligence. The intelligence God going to give us is not artificial. &gt;&gt; We have the real thing &gt;&gt; which should be the mind of Christ &gt;&gt; to know what he wants done &gt;&gt; with the WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Satan was waiting for this time to establish the beast system because the beast system have to know everything. And they get the technology now to be able to know everything. Everyone. There's no privacy. They know who you are. They know where your house is. They know what car you're driving. They know everything about you. &gt;&gt; That is how Satan will get the information. &gt;&gt; But God, the spirit of wisdom don't need that. Satan getting his information through knowledge, science and technology. But God look at prophet stand on the platform. He say your name is so and so. Your house number is so and so. There's no technology doing that. God have a higher technology THAN MAN'S TECHNOLOGY THAN ZION'S TECHNOLOGY. OH, GLORY TO GOD. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. Discernment coming back. Yes, &gt;&gt; every gift will come back in the church. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; We would need every one of them. So, but the Bible is on the platform. You're going to pray for this one. But the pillar of fire, some faith pulling here. You see that woman there? God just heal you of kidney trouble. And he said, "Go just heal you of high blood pressure. Go God heal your diabetes." He's what what is happening there? He is tapping into the intelligence of God. There's not artificial intelligence. There's not some of these false prophets. They're looking on Facebook and see what people sick with who the neighbor is, who the brother is, and they say, "Your name is, oh, your name is right. Your brother Johnny, you have a brother named Stephanos." But they checking on Facebook. Lying prophets have things in their ears calling people name. And why they doing that? They're checking. They checking. They checking. Not brother Brandham. He don't check no Facebook. He could tell you where you're from, what you did, how far YOU DID IT, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU, WHY IT HAPPENED TO YOU, AND WHAT YOU NEED TO DO. What is that? THE INTELLIGENCE OF MAN. KNOW THE INTELLIGENCE of God &gt;&gt; and that INTELLIGENCE IS what is promised &gt;&gt; to the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Even the mind of Christ give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Maybe he said [applause] the Holy Spirit told Cornelius to send for Peter &gt;&gt; from Japa. Specific things &gt;&gt; specific to who to ask for. &gt;&gt; What happened there? The intelligence drop down on Cornelius. The intelligence dropped down on Peter, go and eat. He doesn't even know he have to go to the Gentiles. But God set it up. He arranged a meeting. And Peter didn't even know what is going to unfold. He was just testifying. And the Bible said while Peter spoke the words, the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; fell on them &gt;&gt; that heard the word. &gt;&gt; What was the mystery behind that? The mystery behind that is that you could only get life from the body &gt;&gt; and Peter was part of the body &gt;&gt; and your blood cells flow through your entire body to your heart your pumping. So Peter was in the body of Christ so life could come out of his mouth. &gt;&gt; So he spoke the word &gt;&gt; and then the spirit fell on the word &gt;&gt; and they were filled with the Holy Ghost. and they have not been baptized yet in water. &gt;&gt; That is about to repeat. &gt;&gt; They will send for Peter. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. [applause and cheering] So this Holy Ghost we speaking about is not the just the birth 1906 what the Pentecostal claim to have. This Holy Ghost he's talking about is the Holy Ghost itself. The person of Christ in individuals. So Peter had that person. So when he spoke the word, God honored it. So it come like this. Right now we are identified with the message. We believe the message. We believe what Baram says. But one of these days the message will begin to identify stuff with us. &gt;&gt; In other words, it will switch. No longer you identify, but the message. This is him here. This is my son here. This is my daughter here. Look, look, look. You can't hide no more. You can't duck anymore. You can't avoid anymore. God will choose you and pick you out. That's what he did with Job. HE SAID, "SATAN, HAVE YOU CONSIDERED MY servant Job?" He said, "Yeah, you have a hedge around him." He said, "No, no, no. He's the best man on earth. There's not another man like him on earth. Test him. Try him and I'll prove to you." He said, "If you if you take a hedge, I'll make him curse you." And what happened there was the faith of God in Job that Job that God was bragging on. God is not bragging on you. He's bragging on his faith inside of you. He know you'll come through. He know you're going to break out. You're going to bust out your prison. Oh, glory to God. You're going to break OUT YOUR FEARS. HALLELUJAH. YOU ARE GOING to be delivered. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU ARE BOUND WITH TONIGHT. YOU ARE GOING TO BE DELIVERED. God see your deliverance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. Praise God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. All right. Time run. Okay. So, we know when they were building the temple that they didn't have all the material in Palestine. And this is a good type. So, they had us to get the different material from around the world and get it cut according to specification because the Bible said there was not a hammer or saw herd. So when it came together, it was just fitting in it. And listen to what Baram says. Notice the material wasn't found only in Palestine. This temple because it just wasn't there. He had to go to the rest of the world known world. What a beautiful application that God here we go. Don't just cut his materials out of Jews only, out of white only, out of brown or red or black or whatever colors they may be or whatever just out United States, out of Canada only. But he cuts his materials from all the world. How many knows God doesn't speak English? God is not an English man. I hope you get that this tonight. You know people think God is an English man. He only speak a language. No. God can speak French. God can speak Russian. God can speak Spanish. God can speak any language. He can speak in other tongues &gt;&gt; because he is God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, if they were cutting the stone of a certain kind that was found in such a part of the country and cutting a stone over another nation to fit the stone and it might have seemed strange to the people passing by these odd stones being cut. Now watch, he is cutting them. Here we go. in the way that he wishes. And we find out that the materials being cut in their own native land was pecular to a material cut in another native land. So that means we can't go and tell people in Africa how to do it because God have his African brethren dealing with them, cutting them, heing them out. Same thing with in India. Same thing in wherever in America or Europe. You understand what I'm saying? So he knows how to cut &gt;&gt; and he is the one that going to fit it together. &gt;&gt; Like the three wise men, one bought gold, one bought frankincense, one bought m. Now if you don't have revelation, you would ask what what you bringing? &gt;&gt; Oh, he bringing gold. I bring in gold, too. &gt;&gt; No revelation. Oh, you bringing frankincense. I bring frankincense, too. No revelation. If they wasn't wise and they had no revelation, the man with the frankincense will feel bad because frankincense is like the lowest. because that's for debt. &gt;&gt; The man will have gold will feel good but together their message says God in service to die. &gt;&gt; So together you saw the picture together you saw the message but each brought a revelation as God give it to them. &gt;&gt; This is what God want from us. &gt;&gt; Walk with your revelation. &gt;&gt; Speak your revelation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Declare your revelation. &gt;&gt; But it must be in the word. Right. &gt;&gt; Listen. So we find out the material cut in a in their own native land was peculiar to the material cut in another native land. We find out they were transported by ox cart and so on. And he says now but there was one stone to be restored. He said what there wasn't one stone to be restored. He talk about masonry and architecture. Now many of those stones look very odd. There was a place in the temple for every odd peculiar stone. And this to me is showing where you have to be able to show respects whether they come from whatever country. Because what you're looking for is to hear God and to see God and how God will use a man to help you, to bless you, to speak to you. So even though he might be odd in his words, in his pronunciation, odd in his language, odd in how he looks, it doesn't mean it's not God. I told him in France, not because God is silent, he's absent. &gt;&gt; He could be hidden. &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean because he's hidden, he's absent &gt;&gt; because Jesus ministry from age 12 to 18 was silent. Jesus didn't speak, he didn't work, he didn't do, he didn't explain. When he hear him teaching false doctrine in the temple, Jesus didn't say, "Yo, false." Jesus Jesus didn't argue with them. He just waited until his time came. &gt;&gt; And when his time came, he is baptized with the Holy Ghost. He overcome the devil in the wilderness. Overcome privately, not with deacons and elders and other preachers only by himself. Overcome the lust of the eyes, the lust of the flesh and the pride of life. He overcome that privately. Nobody knows that. &gt;&gt; Right now, the spirit is upon him. &gt;&gt; He returned in the power of the spirit. &gt;&gt; And they said, "We want somebody to read scripture tonight." And Jesus put up his hand first time. I said, "Okay, I'll be so glad Joseph Mary's son coming to read for us tonight." And he have to find all these big scrolls. You know, they had them rolls like that and he had to find Isaiah and then he found Isaiah and then get the chapter and roll it out. Then he begin to read. The spirit of God is upon me because he and they thought he's text he's reading. He's not reading text. He is the text he's reading. The spirit is upon me because he hath anointed me. Is that a quote? He is the court THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT. HALLELUJAH. [screaming] FOR HE HAD ANOINTED me to preach, to do this, to do that. And then he rolled back the scroll, put it down, sat down. I said, "This day, &gt;&gt; this scripture is fulfilled in your ears. &gt;&gt; And all them have sleeping." What? Can't believe it. &gt;&gt; But that was the fulfillment of the promised word. &gt;&gt; And one of these days, you will have the privilege to say this is that that the prophet William Brandham spake of. Oh, GLORY TO GOD. HALLELUJAH. WE ARE NOT HERE TO VINDICATE A MAN. WE ARE HERE to vindicate God's word. &gt;&gt; Oh, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT IN the house. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WE ARE NOT HERE TO VINDICATE A MAN. We are here to vindicate what God have said. God can't lie. We have many people who have gone on to the sixth dimension holding on to this promise. And they without us are not made perfect. They [music] are depending upon us. &gt;&gt; Not all of us will sleep. We who are alive and remain. Give the give the Lord a shout in the house. &gt;&gt; There are going to be we who are alive and remain. Praise God. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; All right. So, brother Brandon, now he's taking this type and he's switching it to ministries. Our ministries, which is a beautiful type here, shows our pecularity, our way of worship. Yet when the temple the real temple we will come to after a few minutes come together every odd acting person we may look a little funny to someone else act a little funny but remember it's the place there for us God is cutting out his church and every little stone have its place exactly to it and remember it was cut from the place that will be put together isn't that right so we of the spiritual how that every gift of God, every odd acting born-again Christian in their pecularity have got its place. It fits in the body, it goes to its right place. So then what is the issue? Who is really ahead? This is not Olympics. This is not 100 meters and 200 meters and I win the race. That's foolishness. We are coming down to the B system. We are coming down to where they will shut down the churches. We are coming down where Satan is like a roaring lion to see if we devour the church. We are coming down to what Jesus said when the son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth or would people lose the faith. Think about it. Over 50 plus years believing this message and people getting weary and tired and people are stumbling and fumbling and going slow and just taking it easy like if this message is nothing and we are saying Elias is already come and the Lord himself has descended with a shout [applause] &gt;&gt; AND THE SHOUT IS IN US. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE THE SECRET IS THE WORD IS IN THE BRIDE. THE SHOUT IS IN YOU. THE MESSAGE IS IN YOU. THE WORD IS IN YOU. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; But you're waiting for the spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But what I say, he said, if it's in Okay, I'll skip. There was one stone that actually was too odd to fool with. So the builders rejected it. They had built the building so high until they missed that stone. And they begin to look for that stone. And he said Jesus spoke of it. He said, "Have you not read of the stone? The stone that the builders refused was the chief cornerstone the head of the rest of it. And I think in building today of the spiritual house that God worship him. I think the great big failure today among the builders we have come with our denomination. We have laid them in sincerity. We have sent our boys to school to educate them to speak well. He says, "But we try to build it upon education, but these things will not work as long we have not accepted this odd stone." And that is where the builders are today. That is why the bride building here we go. Of Christ is not ready for the bridegroom is because the builders have rejected the chief cornerstone that was laid on their Pentecost, which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost. So flip it anyh how you want to flip it. &gt;&gt; We have a bunch of Baptists in the message now &gt;&gt; believing that when they believe the message they have the Holy Ghost. Why? Because brother Brandham says and he was talking to the Pentecostals. The Pentecostals claimed to have an experience. He said if you have an experience and you receive this message then you have the Holy Ghost. I was a Catholic. I didn't know nothing about anything but the Holy Ghost. You see me jumping shouting. I came as I told her brother Janu Catholic. You ever see a Catholic alive? Catholic is dead. Pentecostal was still worship. And I come from Catholic into this message. I know nothing about Pentecostal. &gt;&gt; But something happened to me &gt;&gt; that changed me. &gt;&gt; I'm not a Catholic. I'm a believer. &gt;&gt; A born again believer. A baptized believer. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I see when the spirit fall, it have people behaving one way. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One way. It make you shout. It make it that you know it blow my mind. But Abraham says when John saw his name, John say all in heaven all under the earth I praise God. And you go to the message and you see people not even praising, not even worshiping just watching. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have you seen your name? Do you understand what this name thing is about? &gt;&gt; Do you understand your name was sealed &gt;&gt; with seven seals? &gt;&gt; When the seals was broken, he broke your name. When the mighty angel came down, he came down with the book with your name in it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When the thunders were uttered, he throw your names out &gt;&gt; and the thunders found you. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SO, you ought to understand, you are one in a million truly. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause] &gt;&gt; My God, they rejected it. What they rejected the captain soon. I'm going to skip. Praise God. I lost track of time. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; He says here, "A body has thou prepared me? What house will you build me? &gt;&gt; Heaven is my throne. &gt;&gt; Earth is my foottool. What house will you build me?" &gt;&gt; He said, "But a body has thou prepared." And here, brother Brandham, a body of believers, &gt;&gt; a body that has been born. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Amen. He said the people they are following after creeds and things and leaving off following the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; because people like to believe things. I believe this. I believe this as if that belief taking them to the rapture. Belief is not taking to the rapture. Oil is taken to rapture. &gt;&gt; Power is taken to the rapture. &gt;&gt; Elon Musk cannot send up those rockets with gasoline. He cannot light a fire and say, "Oh god, I'm going to light it like if it's um what you call it uh these things make noise. These things pop light and he can't light under the rocket and I'm going to I'm going to put a a matches on the rocket and going to take off." No, he has to have the right mixture inside of there for this because the rockets going out of space. &gt;&gt; And if we have to go in the rapture, we have to have a power &gt;&gt; to take us out of here. &gt;&gt; Books can't take us out. &gt;&gt; Pressing play can't take you out. talking it can't TAKE YOU OUT. &gt;&gt; EXPLAINING IT can't take you out. You will need a power. &gt;&gt; I don't have that power. He has it. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; And I can give you a promise. I can give you a promise. Acts 18, you shall receive power &gt;&gt; after the Holy Ghost come upon you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. So, power is coming. Get ready. Get ready. Get ready. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Power is on its way. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he designed us, here we go, to come together in heavenly [clears throat] places in Christ and have these supernatural workings of God outlets through gifts of the spirit such as prophecy and wisdom and knowledge and gift of healing and all these other different gifts is outlets that God let out his power and let out his revelation to the people. Not as individuals so much but as a unit. We are all together one great body of believers. And how do we get into this body, the mystic body of the Lord Jesus? By one spirit, we are all baptized. Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; What we need today, the greatest healing we need today is the healing of the body of Jesus Christ. his body, the body of believers that have been broke up by different denominations. They are different one from another. They don't have love one for another. What we need tonight is a uniting together. All Christians shake hands. Every denominations, then God will come down and visit us. &gt;&gt; So if God want us to get us together, who want to separate us? &gt;&gt; Satan. So his job is to divide us. His job is for us to holds and grudge. I don't know what you do here in in Europe if how often you have to renew a license if it's every 3 years or every year or whatever. But I see people like they renewing a grudge like when the grudge finish when it's supposed to expire or the odds they go and get a renewal and they continue this fight. It makes no sense. When you stand praying forgive &gt;&gt; you're praying for what? for love, for charity, for dynamics, for the power, forgive if you have ought against any. We would have ought. We are natural. We are human. We have issues. Somebody may wrong you. Somebody may lie on you. But how do you manage? God is not testing them. He's testing you. He's looking at your attitude because he want to bring you through. &gt;&gt; There will always be issues. &gt;&gt; I hear ministers will run other ministers. This one, this one, that one, that one, that. And when I'm hearing that, I say, who is perfect to judge the others like that? Everybody will have their faults, their weaknesses, their fears, whatever it is. We can't judge like that. We have to let go and let God and say, "God, that is your man, that is your servant. Use him." &gt;&gt; David has his issue. Samuel has issue. All them has an issue. Some start off good and end up bad. Some start off bad, end up good. &gt;&gt; Some some Sam start off halfway. Look at Samson. Samson had issues. He wasn't going to get somebody in his own church. He going to fool around with this one, that one. you know, with Delilah. He didn't see the devil upon Delilah. He saw a shape, a height, a color, whatever it is, what he was admiring. But Samson did not see how the enemy was going to use that woman because she had another force working with her. She had another power working with her. Samson had the power of God working with him. He was covenanted by seven locks. &gt;&gt; So when Delilah stripped him, &gt;&gt; the B and this part was this part is really moving for me. The Bible said when he woke up, he shook himself like before. He expecting the same results and when he shook himself he found out he was just like a normal man. That is when you leave the anointing and when you break the covenant. Sarapson didn't understand. He took for granted what God put on him. He took for granted he's been covenanted. And when his hair was cut, no more power. &gt;&gt; He was just like everybody else. &gt;&gt; God did not call you in this message to be like everybody else. &gt;&gt; God called you to make you a covenanted one. God called you to be a bloodcovered one. &gt;&gt; God called you to be different. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Once a son, always a son. &gt;&gt; Samson, he paid the price. His eyes is out. He's in prison. They want to make fun of him. And all of a sudden, they want to bring him to make fun of him. And Samson asks to be positionally placed before he called for power. I want you to think about that. He didn't ask for power. He asked to be put in the right position before the power comes. Church, we have to be in the right position. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lead me to the pillars. And he's standing there. You may be seated. And he said, "Once more, Lord." Now, the only reason he can say once more is because he had it before. Yes. &gt;&gt; And he said the dynamics of this church &gt;&gt; will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; that they have worked in a small measure. &gt;&gt; So the only reason we could ask for more is because we had it before. &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a praise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We can ask FOR MORE BECAUSE WE TASTED IT BEFORE. &gt;&gt; And what happened? Samson killed more and is dead than his life. &gt;&gt; I think I want to close. I I I run out of time. &gt;&gt; I have 14 pages. I reached six. &gt;&gt; I have another message for tomorrow. I'll close with this. If God give a duck enough sense to know how to dodge the coldness, &gt;&gt; how he ought to give the church. If a duck and do that by instinct, what about the Holy Ghost in the church? It ought to lead us, we talking about the Holy Ghost now, out of old formalities and creeds and things into a glorious, wonderful baptism of the Holy Ghost. It brings virtue, knowledge, patience, godliness, and the Holy Spirit. That is what the real guide would lead us to. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I know a lot of brothers, they want to stay on the mysteries. They want to stay on revelations on Ukraine and Russia and the Pope and this mystery and the vials and and and Mr. Tariff and President Tariff and all the different characters that have a wrong but the point about IT IS THIS THAT CAN'T HELP US. &gt;&gt; What we need is to make OURSELVES READY. HIS WIFE HAD MADE HERSELF ready &gt;&gt; and the only thing will make you ready is the gown of his promised word that you could wrap yourself in it and dress yourself IN IT. &gt;&gt; OH, GLORY TO GOD THAT JESUS COULD SAY THAT'S my bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Like brother Stephan say I chose her. JESUS CHOSE YOU. THAT'S MY BRIDE. &gt;&gt; She walks like me. She talks LIKE ME. SHE LIVES LIKE ME. SHE ACTS LIKE ME. That is my bride. &gt;&gt; Come on, please. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Thank you, Lord. So, the stone will not fit at the bottom foundation. I'm going to close. Musician come please. Jesus cannot come. Here we go. &gt;&gt; Until a church, a body of believers get and the ministry that he wants will have to be the same. They must have this ministry to raise up the Lutherans, the Wesian all through the ages. What is he saying here? Among us, we must see the ministry of Jesus Christ back into the church. We have to come under expectation for that. Not more mysteries, not more men, not more revelations, but Christ walking among us. him moving in and out. He said, "And then we are worshiping the living Christ." &gt;&gt; Listen to these closing words. The very ministry that Jesus Christ was doing here on earth, when it comes back, the very same ministry at Pentecost will not have to widen itself out in an organization. It until Christ the headstone, the church will fit one to another. So he's prophesying over and over and over this ministry is coming. And if the life of Jesus Christ ever puts forth another body of believers, they will write a book of acts &gt;&gt; behind it because it is the same life. &gt;&gt; He was born of God. He's coming for a church that be reborn by the spirit of God cuz the strength of the headstone runs all through the church like a magnet. We have got to be the magnetized to the headstone. THIS BRIDE BODY MUST follow the head for it is part of the resurrection. Oh my. Hallelujah. I didn't finish this part. I have to listen to this one. Therefore, the body cannot recognize. Don't you fail this. The body cannot recognize any other headship but the word. &gt;&gt; So we have no headquarters in America or Europe or any part of the world. Our headquarters is in heaven. &gt;&gt; And Christ is the head of the body of the church. So we have one body, one spirit, one head. God bless you, brother Jonathan.

HE SAID, "I CALLED YOU one out of a million, one out of this nation, one out of this nation, one from the north, one from the south, one from the east, another one from the west. I choose them and together they are the body of Jesus Christ." I love that when he said maybe one day you open a message book, you open the Bible. You start reading it to your wife. You start reading it to your children. You start reading in the church. And you say, "Today, today The power has come into my life. &gt;&gt; The situations is changed. &gt;&gt; What I was I no more. &gt;&gt; My sickness turned into hell. &gt;&gt; The night turned into the to light. &gt;&gt; The darkness has gone. &gt;&gt; The scripture &gt;&gt; has been fulfilled &gt;&gt; in my life. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our brother Oid has a burn for the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; This is what our body of Christ will produce. So at the end of the day, there's only one question left. Are you in the body? There's millions of questions in this world. There's millions of question in the internet. There might be millions of question in the message. But there's one question. [music] It's one question. &gt;&gt; Are you in [music] the body? Let's pray. Dear heavenly father, after a message that was so clear tonight, Father, Lord, if we can get a true revelation of the body of Christ, Father, and to know that you are shaping us, that you are forming [snorts] us, Father, while we are in the body, Father, Lord, and we become more like you, Lord Jesus. Jesus. Father God, I pray, Father, if there's anyone tonight here, Father that says, "I'm not sure or I don't know, Father." Lord, I pray, Father, that the Holy Ghost, Father, will come into your life, Father, and give them a confirmation, Father, into their life. Give them a seal, Father, that they know they know they know they are part of their body. Father, this body is going to be resurrected one day, Father. This body is going to produce another book of Acts, Father. Lord, I pray for everyone, Lord. Father, and I thank you, Father, as we've gathered together, Father, knowing that you are in our midst, Father. Lord, father that you are here with us, Father, your being is here with us, Father. Lord, may you speak to the individuals, Father. Lord, in a personal way, Father, Lord Jesus, may you come to them, Father, Lord, I pray, Father, as they go on their way, Lord, Father, Lord, may you answer that question, Father, in their life in Jesus Christ's name.
