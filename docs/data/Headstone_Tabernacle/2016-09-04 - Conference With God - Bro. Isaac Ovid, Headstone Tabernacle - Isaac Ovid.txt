to surprise his bride with love gifts he likes to do different things different flowers different fragrances because you are the Beloved of God can the church say Amen oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah let us bow our heads for a word of prayer and I want to read a prayer from God's prophet in the message having conferences you can keep playing [Music] every head bowed every eyes closed but the random was praying and I want this to be our prayer this morning our most gracious and loving father the God of all life that sent to us thy loving son the Lord Jesus that he might be the appropriation for our sins took upon himself the form of sinful flesh and was made sin for us that we unworthy people might might be drawn nigh unto God through the shedding of his blood once and for all and we have gathered here in this conference Lord in these nights just to be seen not just to be seen of others or to so much as associate with each other Lord we pray that if that has been the attitude of the people up to this time and myself that you will forgive us for our sin we have come Lord in the age of the dying we come in the time that when we feel we don't have much time left and we have gathered here for one purpose and that's to get close to you we want our sins under the blood we want close Fellowship we want to talk it over with you Lord before you come for on that day it'll be too late then and we pray today Father God that you'll put such a hunger in the heart of the people until up and down these river banks will be prayer meetings going going on men seeking God In A desperate condition knowing that they must find rest to their souls and receive the Holy Spirit or here they'll pun someday into eternity without knowing you oh God be merciful to us and as we see our churches and our own full gospel groups begin to cool down and seem like there's no great crying for lost souls there's no more of that sincere all night prayer and meditation in the word and it seems like we have just drifted Lord forgive us oh God and let us renew ourselves today a fresh in the Holy Spirit when we can think of the days going by in the age of the Methodist when they prayed all night long and wept with bitter tears for the lost and they have no peace and today seems like we can just dress nice and sit down and listen and go home unconcerned oh Lord stir our hearts today put a Zeal in our souls for lost souls May min ministers and the Ley every person become a part of the Kingdom with a burning desire that we canvas cities and everywhere and pull the loss out of the gutters and get them as fire brands for the Lord we read over in the book that it is said that the angel went forth and put a mark upon those who sighed and cried for the Abomination that was did in the city and realizing by the scriptures that there was the first coming of the Holy Spirit through the city of Jerusalem then on his second return in this age to call a people out of the Gentiles for his name how much more should we be concerned and sighing and crying for the Abominations that did we see churches practicing rock and roll and playing Bingo and having all kinds of swimming contests and so forth in the church when prayer meetings and all night taring meetings is forgotten God send us back to the real thing send us back to the real thing let the Holy Ghost come among these people today and start a Pentecost right here granted Lord in every heart truly they want to it's in their hearts to do it but the cares of the world and the swiftness of passing of time has just woed them out Lord start from this Pulpit from me and go to the audience and move like never before give us a Zeal for lost souls Grant it Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen you may be [Music] seated hall hallelujah amen amen I greet you this morning in the precious name of Jesus Christ it is such a privilege to be in the house of the Lord you can keep playing softly certainly want to welcome everyone those connected on the internet special welcome to brother Timothy matura good to see you Sister Lisa special welcome Andrew ER and your wives all the other visitors in our gates Welcome to our Sunday morning service we are happy to be in in Fellowship around the word of God and we come to church to get closer to him amen if that's not the reason you're here then you're here for the wrong reason we are here to get closer to him it's wonderful to get closer to each other it's wonderful to be able to Fellowship one with another but if there's not a most important reason then you miss the whole picture it is to get closer to him to become one with him Hallelujah and God told Moses when you come out of Egypt the whole purpose of coming out of Egypt when you come out of Egypt bring the people to this mountain to Worship in other words before you possess your inheritance worship amen before the every place you put your foot is yours right worship because worship is your way of letting God know that he is your god it has nothing to do with how bad this week was it has nothing to do with what happened this morning it has nothing to do with if you could pay your bills it has nothing to do with what the condition of your mortgage is it doesn't it have nothing to do with what the doctor said about you it it doesn't even have anything to do but your past or your mistakes or your failures we are talking about worship because he is God before you get the Holy Ghost you have to worship before you get a blessing you have to worship before God can touch your child you have to worship before the sickness can leave your body you have to worship before you can get your breakthrough you have to [Music] worship before you pray worship that's why that's the way Jesus taught us you may be seated he said let me teach you how to pray come on and he started our father with Arch in heaven hallow it be thy name before he asked for anything he he was worshiped acknowledging that God is above and he is powerful Our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy he didn't ask for anything yet thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven you are God there is none like you there is no God like Jehovah he is bigger than your problem he is bigger than your trial he is bigger than your situation hallah hallelujah hallelujah he may be seated many religions my God in the world have God for different days and God for different events and the god of rain and the god of animals and the god of Health some of us are guilty because we have made our God the god of Sunday Jesus hallelujah it's only on Sunday we worship my God it's only when we come to church we worship Hallelujah but worship it should be natural to you as breathing because we were created to worship if you miss worship you miss the very purpose for your existence that's why brother Bram said if there's no noise there's no God there's no worship there's no God because God is the object of worship so I want to make sure that the foundation is laid this morning because we will say some things this morning because the truth is going to set you free Hallelujah in every age the worshippers of that age worshiped in spirit and in truth and in our day we have the full truth we have the full word so God has been longing for this day for the people who have the full word the full message the full Revelation to Worship in a way that could be called heresy Worship in a way that could be called fanatical Worship in a way that people could think you're crazy but that doesn't matter because you have a destination that nobody else could understand you have to realize this morning that every experience you went through was to bring you to this spot to catch a revelation that you are born of God that no weapon formed against you could prosper and that all things work together for good to them that love God and to them who are de called according to his purpose and the God I serve his purpose must be accomplished his purpose will be accomplished there's no other way around it you may be seated Hall hallelujah hallelujah so there's a jubilee coming friends there's a time of worship and restoration that we have never seen before and we've got to be ready for it is there not a cause don't we have enough sick people don't we have enough backsliders don't we have enough depressed people to begin to raise the standard and push the enemy out I woke up this morning and my chest was painting me and I said look how the enemy tries to raise up whenever something has got to happen Happ I know this morning that you had to fight all kind of stuff to get here this morning God knows all the trials you went through to be in the house of God this morning but the more the devil fights it's the greater the blessing the Devil is nervous this morning he wants to stop you but he cannot stop you you are an invincible Army you are a super Church you are a super race can the church say Amen so what do we do doing we are getting ready for a jubilee Hallelujah tell your neighbor it's Jubilee time hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah there has got to come a jubilee there has got to come a time when you're free from sickness free from sickness free from tiredness free from depression free from frustration free from the Taskmaster free from the chain of Sin Sin holding you down uh you try to raise up but you find yourself fall back one day that's going to be over one day you're going to raise up and you're not going to go back down because your permanent your state will be permanent can the church say Amen you may be seated I'm excited this morning because somebody's going to break free I can't break you free but who the son of man sets free is free indeed and the son of man was veiled in a son of man to bring a message of Deliverance to bring a more sure word of Prophecy all the scriptures will poting to this day because this is Jesus day I'm not talking about the Jesus of yesterday it's easy to talk about Jesus of yesterday it's easy but the Pam said to talk about what's to come but now right now God is changing your situation he is changing your circumstance you are here and he's changing your house you are here he's changing your company you are here he's changing your family why because you are predestinated for such a time as this can somebody say Amen oh blessed be the name of the Lord oh Hallelujah you may be seated God is going to have a witness he will have a witness in Trinidad he will have witnesses around the world uh he will have witnesses who will say no to the devil who will say no to backline in who will say no to giving up even though you're down on the ground you can still say I'm not giving up you might be knocked out this morning but let the fight be in you you may be seated for a minute hallelujah hallelujah one time there's a story told of a little boy in a classroom and he kept standing up in the class and he kept standing up in the class and the teacher said sit down and kept saying sit down and eventually he sat down and he started smiling they ask why you smiling say I'm sing now but I'm standing up on the inside and it might look like some of you been knocked out the devil ran you over but put a smile on your face you're standing on the inside why because this flesh man this flesh man is temporary but you have a theophany you have a word body your name is in the book and the angels are shouting this morning they are rejoicing this morning though he slay me yet still I trust him I can give this body up CU there's another body waiting for me I know where I come from I come from God and I go back to God so this morning I'm here to speak against your sickness yes yes I'm here to speak against your condition yes I'm here to speak about your past and say it's over it is finished it's over your sickness is finished your past is finished forgetting the things that are passed I press I press blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated this is just a background I'm going to get to the message but I want to you see I really want to talk to you a little bit today so I'm going to do a bit of of exhortation before I talk to you in the message adoption brother Bram said God wanting to place his church Sons and Daughters of God Amen and here brother the brandom's prayer God let me live to see it is my prayer amen so close that I could almost feel it and that this that and that was in 1960 he was speaking there he was he was looking for something he said that's what I've longed to see waiting for the time and remember a prophet is seeing in the future and he speak in present tense so he say that's what I've longed to see waiting for the time when we walk down the street and there lays a he's not speaking about the past he's speaking about the future and he's waiting for a time when there is a laying there from his mother's womb and Silver and Gold Have I None he was waiting for a time that is to break upon us when we will walk the street and by divine revelation and inspiration you walk into a situation and you could speak oh he said Wai him for the manifestation of the sons of God listen you may be seated it's not for your validation it's not for your confirmation it's not for your recommendation it's not for your recognition but when God will make himself known because that's his objective he wants to make himself known we're not here to hear me preach this morning we're not to hear to hear any man preach but we want God to make himself known when they'll stop sickness when they'll stop cancer when they'll stop diseases in other words when God makes himself known you'll see cancer begin to tremble you will see disease begin to tremble God may you make yourself known in the house this morning Hallelujah you may be seated brother the B said right now we lay hands on the sick but in that time we'll command the Devils we'll command the Devils that they got to go I feel like commanding some devils I believe the season is coming upon us for a long time we've been in the vineyard for a long time we P church services I'm not here for just another church service there's a need in the church this morning I'm declaring a state of emergency I'm declaring a state of emergency in the church this morning there are some people who are dead they are here but they are dead there's no joy in their soul uh that's a state of emergency some of you have children who are backsliding that's a state of emergency some of you haven't prayed for a long time that's a state of Emer Mercy some haven't been in the house of God for a long time that's a state of emergency there's sickness in your family that's a state of emergency some of you have accepted your problems that's a state of emergency because God doesn't want you to accept sickness accept your condition you have to raise up out of your situation so it's a state of emergency this morning it's a crisis and whenever there's a state of emergency brother Bram said God calls a conference he said whenever there's a state of emergency God calls a conference it's not our conference it's his conference and he called a conference this morning hallelujah hallelujah oh my my my my my my hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated this morning you keep the motos humming I just want to make sure we on the same page we got to be on the same page it's the word page it's the full word page it's not your idea it's not my idea it's not your feeling it's not my feeling it's not your dream it's not my dream it's a full message it's a finished message it's a complete message there's only one element left remaining that's the bride to come into her position it's always been about this groom this Lord Jesus Christ who has been looking for a bride for a long time he had a desire just before the foundation of the world he had a desire to be a redeemer to be a Healer to be a deliverer but there was another desire to be a husband to be a groom to love his wife and he have demonstrated healing and Redemption but this wife thing is a new thing this marriage thing is a new thing but the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife had made herself ready you are called to the wedding ceremony not as guests not as visitors you have been called to a wedding ceremony to put on your Veil and and to oh you don't hear me this morning I'm not preaching to visitors in the wedding we will have visitors in this wedding but you are going to be married to Jesus Christ himself you are Mrs Jesus Christ you are the chosen from before the foundation of the world you may be seated hallelujah hallelujah Jesus had to get the best wife because he's a special man there was no man like this man he can't marry anybody he walked on water he got to have a wife who could walk on water he healed the sick he got to have a wife who could heal the sick he raised the dead he's got to have a wife who could raise the dead oh you don't hear me this morning he can't marry anybody you may be seated hallelujah hallelujah when Jesus meets a problem you may be sitting for a minute when Jesus meets a problem he comes to the Grave he comes to where Lazarus was he didn't ask what's the problem how many people we have mour do you have enough coffee do you have enough cicks who's cooking for the week he asked one question where did you lay [Applause] [Music] him where's the pro at where is the situation at where what are you crying about at let me get to the problem and I'll fix the problem this kind of man has to have a special kind of wife flesh of his flesh bone of his bone Spirit of his Spirit you may be seated hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated when there's a marriage the two becomes one so God has to trust this woman because when she speaks he is obligated to back it up when she speaks whatever she binds on Earth is bound in heaven whatever she looses on Earth is loosed in heaven you may be seated what are you saying preacher that's why the Brandon made this they say what the world needs is some lived voices because lived voices is Jesus Christ under scene and those lived voices will pulsed something and when the world saying send us Jesus there'll be Jesus walking around Trinidad going under Maxis going under buses come on young people that's your promise you may be seated Hallelujah Glory so we are preparing for a Great Commission am the Pentecostal Church can't preach this Hallelujah The Message Church don't want to preach this Hallelujah because there's a change from just seeing the prophet to the prophet's [Music] prophecy Isaiah's prophecy of a virgin shall conceive when Mary came on the line it switched from the prophet's word to the prophecy being fulfilled the same thing happened when Jesus was there because Jesus was walking and they were still speaking about the Messiah to come and they fear to realize that Messiah was on the earth and the Holy Ghost is here right now he's moving through the aisle right now look at the seal individuals and place them into the kingdom you may be seated I'm going to get to my message in a minute but I want to make sure we are on the same page that we go to the same place that we on our way to the same destination because after it all we all have to give an account amen for every service that you came to amen you have to give an account for every scripture that you read for every book that you read for every tape that you listen to because the objective is not to listen to tapes the objective is not just to be in church the objective is to live [Music] something and if you miss that you missed the whole picture the whole purpose of this great gospel this gospel is a gospel of change you cannot tell me you're here and you're the same but the brandom said when you come to church one of two things happen amen you either get better or you get worse how will you leave this service today will you be better or will you be worse God will change things in your situation to drive you into a state of emergency he can make your life easy if he wants it but will you call upon him in the EAS in Zion or does God have to turn up the heat to make sure and catch your attention make sure and catch your attention he wants to catch your attention and hold your attention can the church say Amen hus in the message here him there'll be a power put into the church and now is coming in that the Holy Spirit Will so anoint the people till they'll speak the word and it will create itself right there can the church say Amen so are you ready for the word this morning let us take our Bibles I want to read one portion of scripture this morning reading from Isaiah chapter 1 I'm reading Verse 18 Isaiah 1 and: 18 come now and let us reason together sayth the Lord though your sins be as Scarlet they shall be as white as snow amen though they be red like Crimson they shall be as wool may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word let us bow our heads once more Heavenly Father we lord are so humble to be in your presence this morning and Lord we are totally and completely dependent upon you amen Lord you know the burden in my heart this morning and Lord I have this simple thought but may you breathe life upon it and speak to your people Lord may you deliver your people from every bondage Lord and may the Holy Ghost pour out here this morning Lord may you delivered the backsliders in our midst this morning and may the Holy Ghost find Lord rest and place in the hearts of the people Lord I will never be the same again may you break the power of sin Lord the power of faar and unbelief upon the people and may Lord such a joy be in the house Lord may you bless those who are here and those connected on the internet and those who would hear the tape commit the service into your hands may you bless the word and the reading of it in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen amen and amen you be seated so for my title this morning it's conference with God Amen in the message having conferences brother the brandham said in the text tonight of conferences we lately have heard so much about conferences wherever you pick up the paper you always see some Diplomat or some official or some convert at a certain place and whether it's United Nation know the government and right here in Trinidad they want to meet to talk about crime and this and that there's a conference going on and but B said why do we hold conferences all right what are they to do they are to get together and reason out different things where we come at a conference we have to reason together and I think this is one of the most beautiful scriptures when God said come and let you and I have a conference amen so that's speaking to any group I'm not speaking to groups I'm speaking to individuals this morning amen amen let us get together and kindly reason things out but though your sins be as scly they shall be as white as snow amen though they be red like Crimson they shall be white as wool if you'll only come and let us reason together and we find tonight and brother Bram said as everyone know that we are losing ground we are losing ground as a people the world is creeping in among us all right you can see it you can feel it you can tell it the world is moving in among us so I think this would be a wonderful time for us to have a conference and talk it over with God and find out what's the matter H now conferences is a get together and usually it is held in a time in a state of emergency and I want to pause a minute and really talk about this state of emergency because in this age coming out of Leia is a age where there's a feeling of need of nothing there's a age of ease in Zion there's a age of there's a comfort with knowing the message with having the message with coming to church and and when you dig beneath the surface outside of the Sunday worship sometime ago I spoke to the young people and my title was between Sundays because it's easy on a Sunday morning to come to church and oh there's a charge there's a Zeal there's an enthusiasm there's a recognition of deity there's an acknowledgment that God is God and you shout and you worship but when the service is over there's a daily struggle to deal with the issues on a Monday and on a Tuesday and on a Wednesday and by Thursday God help me you need a booster shot by Friday by Saturday by Sunday you need to come to church because you done backslid during the week Hallelujah but how do you measure this state of emergency there's an inverse relationship with the state of emergency and your prayer life people don't pray pray 5 minutes that doesn't cut it 10 minutes that doesn't cut it 20 minutes that doesn't cut it if Jesus had to pray and would T earnestly what about us and we come to church and we make demands of God lord and he is hearing from you for the first time for the week it's a state of emergency when our children don't know the Bible am amen it's a state of emergency when the prophet's voice is a stranger not just to your house but some of us who have been in the message for a long time he has become a stranger to us it's a state of emergency it's a state of emergency when we know more about the political dimensions and what's happening in the US than what is happening right now in the Church of the Living God hallelujah it's a state of emergency when we are quick to hear what this church is doing and what that church is doing and what this church is doing and there's no blood on the doorpost of your house hallelu it's a state of emergency when we sit in Moses seat and judge everybody when the Bible said judge not hallah he be judged we are in the state of emergency it's a state of emergency when people come to church to be prayed for and there's no faith in the church right because faith is based on forgiveness and people are holding arts and grudges in the church it's a state of emergency it's a state of emergency when you walked through the doors and you didn't even pray for the minister Hallelujah before he comes into the pulpit not even understanding the demon powers that he has to fight to deliver a [Music] message it's a state of emergency when husbands don't pray for their wives it's a state of emergency when wives don't even pray for their husbands it's a state of emergency when parents instead of arguing don't get down on their knees and pray for their children it's a state of emergency when we forget the power of the blood it's a state of Emer when we forget God forgives it's a state of emergency when we are guilty with unconfessed sin and we don't even come and bring it to the pastor to get prayed for it's a state of emergency you may be seated it's a state of emergency when fathers have forgotten their place in the homes we cannot speak about men being in crisis in the world that's the world but men cannot be in crisis in the Church of the Living God it's a state of emergency the standards of the world cannot be our standards it has become a state of emergency Hallelujah am amen it's a state of emergency Hallelujah when you forget the importance of coming to the house of God my Lord it's a state of emergency when you interpret a word to yourself like a buffet I'll have chicken without the fish and I'll have it's a state of emergency when instead of praying for your brother you call five people and tell them you know what brother so and so did Hallelujah but come this morning and let us reason together together let us talk it over this morning let's bring some resolution to your issues this morning let's let's call a conference in the church brother Brandon said we could pray too much sorry we could sing too much we could jump too much we could shout too much but we could never we could never pray too much because that's the real conference it's to have a oldfashioned prayer meeting you know people love to come to CH but if you you really want to tell who the real church is you call a prayer meeting then you see who the real churches because people their desires to hear a word give me a word give me a word but the sighing and the crying and the taring and the holding on and right it's a whole different story it's a whole different experience god brother Bram said in the message having conference I want to start tonight with the Eden conference God felt good after the first day and the second day he ended each day with the statement it was good Hallelujah he felt pleased he felt satisfied in so much that he could just walk away and know that he left things in a good condition when God made Man In His Image and took from his side a ribon made a woman made a helpmate he placed him in the Garden of Eden to be his beloved children amen beautiful but when his cheering had lost that shocking news struck Heaven your children are lost with the BAM his drama he said God brushed everything aside that there was in heaven he wouldn't send an angel to hunt them he wouldn't send a legion of angels God came himself to hunt his own Lost Child because there was a state of emergency brother BR is J in he said no doubt Michael might have stepped up all right let me go and fix the situation Hallelujah Gabriel and when the message come into heaven your children is lost they have sinned and gone away God didn't take Gabriel amen and say go and Hunt my children he came himself brother said it was a mansiz job a godsize job amen amen when God saw that shocking state of emergency brother BR said I suppose the first ever to come to heaven was when he heard that his children was lost and he came frantically up and down through the garden he went looking under every Bush Adam oh my son Adam where thou amen and that that's the kind of conference we have this morning amen amen amen amen and there stood Adam and Eve with their fig leaves sewn together behind the bush father going back and forth screaming where are you where are you and that same God goes up and down the aisles night after night screaming the same thing where are where out and he finds Adam and Eve the same way with some sort of creed that they have or denomination they're depending on to save them hiding behind some man-made theology when God made a preparation for you when he gave his son to die in your stead you know sometimes I find we are so disconnected from reality the other day I hurt my hand and it was painful and I my mind drifted anybody ever pong a nail and you missed your nail and you hit your finger how painful is that and my mind thought wait a minute when they were pounding the nail into jesus' hands we haven't reached the Death part yet but just one two three how painful that must have been and we seem disconnected from the reality that he paid the price that we were supposed to pay and now when he was on his way to Calvary every sin that we committed and would commit was solely being put on his shoulder and he didn't even deserve it it but he was carrying it Hallelujah because if he didn't do it you wouldn't stand a chance I wouldn't stand a chance there'd be no hope for us but he bore it step by step getting heavier and heavier the weight of the Cross becoming so heavy till he couldn't even carry it himself the same man who said peace be still couldn't even Carry the Cross they had to find a man to carry it for him the weight of our sins the weight of our pain the weight of our mistakes upon him but yet he still went on and you want to give up when he took another step in pain and you want to give up and he saying I got to make it I've got to get to Calvary because my people deserve a [Applause] chance H hallelu hallu am amen amen hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord said Adam and Eve hiding behind their own ideas and God made a preparation for you and he gave his son to die in your stad you've got to be born again Creeds won't work amen that conference is held at some Society but God's conference is held in Eden to take care of your sins and there was one held at Calvary will'll get to that later on to take care of your sin and the sin problem and your sickness and all that will ever happen to you Hallelujah preparations have been made I'm so glad but theam said of the Eden conference amen he made a way a preparation a way to take away sin amen he made a way that you could come back again be brought into Fellowship where you lost and standing out somewhere undone without God God made a preparation at this conference and in Eden he made a temporary preparation until the real preparation would be given through the sacrificial Life of Christ amen so from Eden they started to move into that age of bulls and goats which was a temporary but the say said the figs that they covered with that was their idea but they were supposed to be covered by Blood hallelujah praise God until the real sacrifice because the blood and of bulls and goats could only cover but when Jesus came his blood was not to cover his blood was to remove sin his blood is like a bleach you drop it into disc Scarlet sin there's a transformation take place there's still Power in the Blood this morning what sin you talking about as far as the East is from the West oh do your sins be as Scarlet they shall be as white as snow but Bram said that conference on Calvary was successful he said it'll beat Satan anywhere God's word will defeat Satan any place any time on any condition though your sins be as scal you said any condition brother Brandon that's exactly what it said so when you feel down remind Satan about that conference on Calvary when that blood was said it was set for you it was set for you it was set for [Applause] you for your sins be ascal they shall be white as snow the only thing I'm asking you to do is come to my prepared place the altar that's really this message is going somewhere he said come to my prepared place the altar because if there's no altar in your home you're going to miss it friends if there's no alt in your life you're going to miss it right God long for Fellowship that's what he wanted in Eden he would come in the cool of the evening for Fellowship that's right that Fellowship is a conversation it's a relationship and having the books and the T and the Bible that's that's that's temporary until you could speak to him lip to a until you could talk to him and he could talk back to you and he could have a conversation with you and like Adam in the cool of the evening he would come and say I move this mountain and I was feeling all right and I told the birds to come in and I did this and I did this and and God can say that's what I like you you're my boy I like how you do it you do it just like me that's a conversation that's Fellowship that's a relationship God thank you Lord David said as a heart panted as the water Brook so my soul thirst after the Living God hallelujah praise God David spoke about that relationship being established early will I seek Thee I will look at the Hill from it's coming my help my Help Cometh From The Lord he wasn't looking to men and to trust in men he was looking for God and he wanted a relationship in so much that despite his failures God could say that's a man after my own heart because he put me first in everything that he [Applause] does hallu [Music] hallelujah hallelujah it started in Eden the first conference he made a preparation the first emergency was called and God gave the answer and give the preparation but people don't want to take that preparation Hallelujah God made the decision it isn't to us to make a decision what we should do God makes a decision what to do it was God I said you must be born again it's his word it was his decision the blood was the way not fig Leaf nor any other kind of covering so stop hiding this morning stop hiding in the church stop hiding on your job stop hiding in your familyall come out into the open and get your heart right with God come let us reason together you don't have to wait for the service to be over friends you can start to talk to God during the service we're not here to hear me you are here to reestablish a connection with God hallelujah and brother Bram preaches he talk about another conference his children of Israel were in crisis they were in bondage for a long time and he had heard the cries of his people that had reach a state of emergency so God have to call a conference to get the attention of somebody to do something because God needs somebody to use he is God but he has to extend himself through somebody whether it's one person 25 God is going to have a witness so he found a Man Called Moses but the BAM said Moses was scared Moses was a failure but the Bram said he tried like Adam his own fig leaves he tried hiding he tried running he didn't want to hear about Egypt he didn't check the news on what's happening in Egypt he didn't check emails about Egypt he wanted nothing to do with Egypt because he had failed in Egypt but God all a conference because there were some people that needed to be delivered there were some people that needed to be restored he had some Sons and Daughters who were struggling who were hanging in there they had received the promise they all they had was a promise and they were talking about someday we're going to get out of prison someday we're going to be delivered and the Bible said God heard the cries of his [Applause] people heard the cries of his people it was a state of emergency you maybe seated that's a problem with some of us we don't realize it's a state of emergency until some it's too late but when a baby in a state of emergency the baby starts to cry you may be seated everything is a crisis for a baby you know because they can manage and prioritize what's important what's not so there's one response I want to sleep cry I want food cry I want to get out the crib cry everything is a [Applause] crisis but as we live we get more mature and we we get tough and we get strong and we don't need anybody and we could do it but God wants some people who could get into a state of Crisis but the brandham called it a state of desperation he said you can't hear from God until you get desperate and you can't get desperate until God speaks to you so I pray God speaks to you this morning so you can get desperate to begin to cry and say Lord my prayer life and you cry out Lord my joy and you cry out Lord my back and you cry out Lord my head is hurting and you cry out Lord my family is in trouble and you cry out sometime you don't even need words but the cry gets to God and he says you know what I have heard the cries of my people and I have come down I'm not sending Gabriel I'm not sending Michael I'm not sending a messenger I'm not sending anybody but the Lord himself descend with a shout because I've heard the cries of my people from the age of Paul from the age of irenius from the age of Martin they were crying Luther's day they cried Wesley's day they cried the Pentecostal day they cried but then all of a sudden a great conference seven angels come from eternity in this great conference and there was one with a great swep back Wings he was happy to be on the earth once more for a long time he had to finish this war that started in heaven that came into the Earth and he called a conference oh somebody say Amen you may be seated and just like God had to catch mes his attention God find an unlikely person a 20th century prophet he wasn't tall he wasn't strong he didn't have eloquent words he was a simple man he was a simple man but when the son of man was filed in a son of man and he began to speak what did he say Let My People Go hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated Hallelujah and that Prophet declared a message of Deliverance that Prophet from that conference you may be seated if you've ever been in a high powered meeting speak to brother the Blackman speak to some of these brothers here if you ever been in a high powerered meeting out of the meeting there are certain action [Music] items there are some minutes from the meeting that defines what's supposed to happen what was discussed in the meeting what's being kept off the books so we're going to discuss it but we're not going to write it we're going to discuss it in the meeting this we're going to keep off the books and these are the action items so out of this meeting when Seven Angels Came From eternity there were some action items there was some minutes there were some things that had to be finished a super church was there a church without Puerto Rico was there seven Thunders Gathering the bride was there seven Thunders show how to go is there action items you may be seated you may be seated for a minute we all over the place but we have in church this morning Apple computer one of the biggest companies in the world all right they developed a system of management that is revolutionary they believe that you must have for every position every office what they call the D the directly responsible individual because Steve Jobs said I want to blame the team for anything I want to know who was directly responsible for this so in management school they tell you out of a meeting should have action items should have who is responsible possible and when it should happen with the random said everything that man has achieved has always been trying to improve on what they did before but God operates differently whatever God does God sees the future and he is doing based on what he wants to do so the Olympics man runs and he breaks the last record but God he says your body shall be changed there's no record to compare that to that's just the goal changing body you saying b car run into that all of a sudden you become the fastest runner when you change from Mortal to immortality who could catch you that's a different kind of [Applause] record you may be seated so I'm going somewhere so if man can develop systems that have things to do and who does it and by when don't you think God who developed everything has a Time frame has the people has the action item so when God says once more the world will hear direct from God God has names there God has when it's going to happen he has who is going to do it you can miss it if you want [Applause] to you may be seated I feel so good brother the Adrian you may be seated you know there are people who are backsliding and they think there's no hope for them in know amen the people who backsliding and don't even know they're backsliding and there's hope for them too because the hope is not in you Hallelujah the hope is in Christ in you the hope of glory because that seed that was placed before the foundation of the world that seed could only bring forth after its kind it can't bring forth anything else and orange seed can only bring forth the orange you don't hear me this morning Hal Hallelujah so pile it on devil throw what you want on me this seed is going to bring forth you may be seated Hallelujah that's the reason why no matter how frustrated you get no matter how depressed you get no matter when you want to walk away there's something on the inside you can go so far but there's a wall you hit boom you can't go that way you try you do this you try to shake you try to dance you try to you try to Brock it up you try to do all kind of stuff but it's a wall boom you hit the wall and you can't go no further you try to go back boom you hit a wall you can't go further what's that it's a wall of predestination there's a covering over you there's a blood sacrifice over you and when he sees the blood hallelujah hallelujah his hand is long enough to reach you this morning there's no place he cannot find you you your joy is going to be restored your peace is going to be restored uh your Revival is going to be restored come let us reason together come to this conference with God you may be seated Hallelujah bring back the oldfashioned prayer meetings bring back the old time Holy Ghost Services bring back the old time singing this modern songs can't move the spirit the way the oldfashioned songs used to do the modern preaching can't move the spirit the way they come on now you know what I'm talking about Hallelujah I like the old time singing the old time shouting Hallelujah the lid of hell is open and there are streams of demon powers but God will have some individuals who will stand in 2016 and declare that he's a the same yesterday the same today and the same forever can the church say amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah everybody feeling good you taking some more you came to fight this morning you you know you are the preacher I'm not the preacher you supposed to be pulling in the service say come on preacher come on preacher let's fight together it's not about me it's about you it's about us it's about the devil has been given too much room to play around your life to play around the house today we come to kick him [Music] out start practicing you may be seated this is not new stuff there was war in heaven and Michael and a dragon fought and we kicked him out over [Applause] there so why are you harboring fugitives why you harboring fugitives in in your house kick them out I don't care where he lands kick him out there's a warrant out for his arrest kick him [Applause] out you may be see that there are certain things I want you to eliminate today I don't want to hear my Artis my back pain my nothing is not yours kick it out put the blame and the name on where it's supposed to be is the devil back pain it going back to him is his cancer it going back to him it's not your pain it's his pain send it back today the Egyptians you see today you will see them no more forever not coming back Hallelujah brother I'm so excited I feel like putting on the microphone and running down the aisles I have enough excitement for you and for me put together because God is about to do wondrous things wondrous things in the church wondrous things with his people he promised a Revival he promised the ministry of the spirit to Quicken the word te all these years all these years the seed has been preached to us we can't bring rain but he promised us Send the Rain Lord send the rain pour out your spirit glory to God hallelujah Let the Fire fall Let the Fire Fall burn the evil out burn the sin out burn the blindness out burn the unbelief out burn it out today Holy Ghost and Fire that's what we need uh sky blue sin killing Holy Ghost Revival another rushing Mighty Wind uh to fill the whole house uh it could fill your house it could fill your heart hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated for a minute brother the brandom said when you go into a store some them there are things on different shelves there are things on different shelves and he said there are certain things that are on the top shelf he said in order to reach it you got to stretch some of us we like the comfort zone but I want to challenge you to stretch this morning and do what you've never done before that's what makes a difference the difference between ordinary and extraordinary is just the little so the moment you begin to do a little more the devil is like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa what's going on because you break into your routine but God doesn't like routines because the devil could watch your routine but when you break your routine up he can't figure you out when he's supposed to be sad you're smiling when you supposed to be depressed you're worshiping when you know you don't feel like praying you go to pray anyhow when there's no food on the table you bless the meal anyhow because he promised he is Jehovah Gyra he's going to Pro five if you shall see to this mountain be moved and don't doubt you want to see mountains move begin to speak don't speak about the problem speak about the Mountain Moving it's got to move it's moving right now we are speaking it your deliverance is now now Faith is today is your day not next week not next service but today is your day today is my day my family will have a Revival as for me and my house we will serve the Lord he is still a restorer he promised to restore all the years that the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the Locust and the Palmer worm he is a restorer he will restore your health he will restore your finances he will restore everything you lost he is a restorer [Applause] today Holy Ghost and power Holy Ghost and power Hallelujah ljah Hallelujah my my my my my my my my oh Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Hallelujah Glory we got to keep the devil on the Move we have him on the ropes this morning we have him on the ropes this morning your cancer is counting down to your deliverance it's a countdown to your freedom one of these days one of these days this battle will be all over it'll be over nothing lasts forever it'll be over one of these days you may be seated hallu Hallelujah hall hallu hallelujah hallu conference with God not a conference with the minister another conference with the pastor amen not even a conference with the Believers it's a conference with [Music] godl there's no recognition from man when you were in that conference with God that conference with God is that secret chamber that secret place amen with you and God alone when you can uncover every door brother BR and preached a message doors indoors you familiar with it he said many times when you invite someone to your home you keep them in the porch or the living room and depending on the Comfort level you could bring them to the kitchen there's some people you canot bring to your kitchen amen because if they see what you have in the kitchen amen amen they will eat you out then there are some people when you're more comfortable with them you can take them to your study all right sometime ago some years ago there was somebody I knew who whenever they come to say where you got that where you got that where you got that where you get that you have you have extra of that you you don't have two is only one you have and something invariably happens after a while you just stop inviting them be like no no no no no no no I will come to you I will meet you I'm on the road I'll come to you know you don't need to come by me it's all right but brother brandom saying that many of us want to invite God into the living room but we have to be comfortable to invite him into every room room amen amen of our hearts hallelujah amen there's certain secrets we try to hide from other people but there's nothing we could truly hide or ever hide from God and we all have to come face to face with who we are to God it was very notable in Germany convention hearing the eyewitnesses of the bram's ministry speak and they all had something very common to say us they had the consistent message that when you stood in front of the Prophet you felt naked amen you were suddenly aware that he could see everything about you am in so much that some people would avoid coming close to the prophet in an attempt to hide what was going on with them amen because he had eagle eyes he had eyes of his father Hallelujah so he could discern what's going on in your life God is looking for an honest heart Hallelujah we have too many actors and the actors are those who want people to think it's it's all right when you are drowning it's okay to say I need help amen amen it's all right to say I need prayer it's all right to say I am drowning and I need a Lifeboat amen Peter stepped out and walked under the water and the moment he took his eyes off of Christ as brother over preached many times Peter was a Fisher when he could swim he could have fell in the water and then backstop smoothly back to the boat but he said Lord I'm sinking help and this message come let us reason together gives you the opportunity to say Lord I am sinking help me amen stop acting and pretending and playing we all all need God more than we have ever needed him before if there ever was a time to say Lord I need you hallelujah it's now I'm not speaking for anybody I'm speaking for myself and that should be your position this morning amen hallelujah amen Hall Lord I need you yes Lord I think back to God's Prophet Hallelujah he had done Miracles he had seen the sick healed and and after his wife and his daughter died and imagine God's Prophet came to the spot where he tried to take his own life yes yes and it was not a thought it was something he actually attempted to do amen that's right and had it not been for the Lord intervening when he pulled the trigger it would have been a different outcome that's right wow and there are always moments in our lives when we recognize we need help hallah so God slift it in the scripture come let us reason together amen let us talk it over because sometime we get so caught up with the forest we miss the trees we get so caught him in the Journey of life we miss the simple things that God places along our journey that we could be like him it's not about being in a position or being in church it's being like him come let us reason together am though your sins be as Scarlet they shall be white as snow hallelujah what is sin go brother Bram said sin is is unbelief Hallelujah he said smoking and drinking and running around and those are the attributes of sin amen but the definition of sin is unbelief so if you find yourself here this morning and you're struggling to believe and you're struggling in your walk God could change that situation today in your life and give you a supernatural experience that you have never had before thank you Lord Moses tried to work it out his own way after his conference amen amen or before his conference rather and he found that he was wrong and by doing so like many others who backslide listen for the prophet from one Revival to the other going up and trying to impersonate a Christian or standing and making a sign or some Declaration of creed that we cite or recite we find ourselves in a few days defeated because we're trying to do it in ourselves he says it will never work amen we must meet God's program word by word letter by letter amen amen listen carefully friends and I want you to get this you see anything that you trying to do the intellectual mind is so contrary to the spirit the int ual mind thinks it has to be smart and wise but the holy spirit is humble amen so this is the key break down all you ever knowed break down all you ever know and walk sweet and humble before the Lord loving him with all your heart with all your mind and with all your strength that's where the Holy Spirit works and it makes you do things you didn't think you would ever do it'll make you repent and go back and shake hands and make up with people that you could join church and still call yourself a Christian and hear it down in your heart you can be led of the Holy Spirit and do that Hallelujah you can't cheat you can't lie you can't pull Shady deals it's got to be out and above board and the Holy Spirit will approve it I hope this helped somebody this morning hallelujah amen listen carefully Moses tried but he failed God had called him and there's no doubt in the hearing of my voice there may be many people that's God called the same way but we try to appease that by joining church or doing something religious it'll never satisfied you need a conference with God Amen Hallelujah can the church say Amen it was God's selected Place listen carefully so Moses god determined because he elected him to do so he wanded in the desert and one day on The Backs side of the desert God decided to call his runaway Prophet you heard what he called him oh yeah his runaway prophet he had a purpose and a calling but he was hiding from it his runaway prophet and he selected a certain tree I've always wonder what he put on that tree that it didn't burn up that's the prophet the leaves were popping and cracking and the fire burning and I don't know how long it burned but it didn't burn it was God's selected place to meet his Prophet God selects the place to have his conferences just as the Kings and the rulers of the nation select their places for conferences God selects his place my honest prayer is that your seat today or your standing place he's speaking today is God selected place for you that he can talk to you speak to you do something or say something that would attract your attention can the church say Amen oh just give the Lord a hand of Praise this morning and brother Bram goes on he speaks about different conferences he speaks about the Red Sea conference he said Moses was in line of God's Duty and in the line of scripture and the first thing for a man to do is find out if something went wrong is check himself are first you in the line of God's word and the next thing you in the line of duty following what the Holy Spirit told you then if that be so there's only one thing left that's a conference and they were on their March after being separated and a call out people they come to the Red Sea and they had to call a halt they couldn't cross over amen the Great General Joshua to raise his hand and sound the trumpet stop quit marching is an obstacle before us we have the mountains on each side we are down here in the valley and we have to stop and when that church ever stops that's when Satan takes over we've got to move constantly rapidly marching towards Zion Don't Let the Church of the Living God ever be guilty of stopping and they stopped and said what's the matter here and as soon as they stopped and pitched their tents and begin to rest a while they heard the rumble of Wheels and the only way of Escape they had was backward and here come Pharaoh's Army moving in to block them across the soldiers knowing the strategy how to shut them off there was the Red Sea before them perhaps two or three miles across here was the high mountains they couldn't climb them they'd be like sheep scattered out there Hallelujah and as soon as the Hal was called and Pharaoh's Army was seen coming Moses called the conference Hallelujah and he began to reach out to God Amen he said Lord I've mastered this place but an obstacle has stopped us we have had to call a halt and then when the Brandon begins to minister to the people he said like our brother here in the wheelchair Hallelujah like maybe you're sitting there with cancer or heart trouble or something that you know you're just going to die right away the enemy has stopped you he has brought you to a halt amen maybe you come to a Hal before the enemy overtook you maybe there's something in your life that caus you to Halt whatever it is is you still have the privilege of a conference let's talk it over with him let's do something about it no matter what the enemy is he is never too great for our God we need a conference Hallelujah so Moses went up in a certain place and held a conference he didn't know what to do thank you Lord God still ready listen to The Prophet maybe you broke up your home prise God maybe left your husband or left your wife maybe you run off from your children there might be many things in this life that the enemy has trapped you into but remember my brother sister you still have the rights to have a conference with God yes sir talk it over with him he's a very present help in a time of trouble then we see Moses had a conference and this was his conference oh great leader of Israel I've done all this at your command I have led these people just as you told me to do I've covered the People by Blood I've brought down the plagues Out of Heaven I've done everything he told me to do and here we are trapped what must I do Lord I must have this conference with you Hall oh Hallelujah and brother pamman is dramatizing he say perhaps sitting there on the top of the rock I want you to understand the position Moses really had no clue of how to fix the situation right right God had brought him to that spot but he was at a halt amen his Christian Journey was at a halt he had been in the message for a long time but he was at a halt he didn't know how to go forward he felt he was trapped in he cornered he felt he had no reason to shout he had no reason to worship he had no reason to do anything but he called a conference I said Lord I've done everything you told me to do I've tried my best and I'm in the house of God this morning now do something amen H Hallelujah and when his come his hell God stood on a rock around speaking by the side of Moses and said go back to the camp Moses why cry he said go right back where you started from arm God go down there and speak to the people hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah many time we speak about Moses and we talk about why Christ speak but the reality was in his conference he got an answer the answer may have been part rebuke the why cry but he got a word from the Lord speak and move forward and I believe this morning

the Commandment the command is to go forward the promised land belongs to us the Holy Ghost belongs to us the enemy is on his way to be cut off but God said go forward keep moving oh hallelujah hallelujah oh Hallelujah can the church say amen and that's what's the matter with the church today God calls you and he wants to give you gift after gift and power after power and Grace after Grace but you organize yourself he said then I can't go any further because the church won't let me see there's no halting place in God there's no place for denomination there's no place for any certain standards the thing of it is is go forward speak the word and go forward just keep on going keep moving God said it's right it's right you have got your commission and I've got my commission this

sinful your sins are like Scarlet oh You' have made mistakes oh you have fallen oh you have done this and done that but why don't you come and let's reason together why not come and talk it over over with me my grace is sufficient my power is sufficient my way making ability is sufficient I can still give you the Holy Ghost I can still restore your family it's not about you it's about me I made the promise you didn't make the promise but I made a promise can the church say Amen oh Hallelujah we are in a conference this morning God is talking to somebody he wants to see your reaction he wants

the prayer altars will be established in the homes husbands will love their wives wiv will reverence their husbands children will obey their parents we will have another Ephesians that's what this conference is about that's the result of the conference and God will have a people who every word will come to pass Joshua was at a Crossroads there he was uh he didn't know how to move forward but he was doing the best thing he could brother Timothy he was sharpening his sword he didn't know what to do but he was sharpening his sword because he knew any point in time the God who brought him out of Egypt The God Who took him out from the hands of the midianites the God who brought him out was able to speak and while Joshua was there God called a conference he didn't even call it God showed up on the scene and Joshua drew his sword he said are you for us or are you against us and God say neither I'm not for you I'm not against you I'm the captain and I call a conference I call a meeting to give you marching orders because it's a promised land to be taken and they are sick who need to be healed this is what I want you to do I want you to March down to Jericho I want you to walk around the first day and then come back walk around the second day and come back uh walk around the third day and come back uh you do that for six days uh but the seventh day could you imagine a conference taking place all the angels are watching The Devil Is Watching he has no clue what's going on the little few words he hear he can't do nothing about it because God called the meeting and God called this conference this morning and he is giv orders speak and move forward speak for the Holy Ghost speak for your [Applause] healing Hallelujah you may be seated but the brandham said whenever you have a conference with God your walk changes your talk changes he said Moses had a new walk Joshua had a new walk he had went in being quiet you may be seated he had went by himself wondering what's going to happen when Joshua came out to the camp the generals knew something happened the neighbors knew something happened the high priest knew something happened Joshua was feeling good why he came up from the conference he had reason together all the questions he had was answered he said get ready tell his troops get ready tell the children get ready tell the mothers get ready tell the daughters get ready I receive a word from the Lord speak and move forward that's what I feel this morning tell your wife get ready tell your children get ready tell your family get ready we have a word from the Lord a seven T Revival you may be seated hallelujah hallelujah are you having your conference this morning Daniel had a conference they threw in the Lions then because he was praying too much oh God let that be my testimony that I pray too much oh God they didn't like how much time he was spending praying on the job he's praying in the taxi he's praying on the bus he's praying they say this man is praying too much let's put him in the Lion's Den and they put Daniel in the Lion's Den and he turned the prayers up he went into a conference he said Lord I prayed all these years now help me now fight for me but the bandam said while Daniel was praying while he was in his conference the angel was fighting he was fighting he was fighting and the more Daniel was in his conference the angel was cutting through Hallelujah hall hallelujah you may be seated oh hallelujah oh everybody feeling fine everybody feeling fine Daniel and the Lion's then he's in the conference he's watching the lion the lion is watching him and then all of a sudden the the lion realizes that this one is different he had eaten people before but none like this man he had eaten no can before but this man was looking different this man was smelling different this man was walking different he wasn't even crying he wasn't even sighing he was having a conversation with somebody who he couldn't see somebody who he couldn't recognize but then all of a sudden a presence dropped down and you recognize that's the word who made me that's God himself you may be seated conference I tell you brother kangali when you have a conference with God your walk begins to change your shoulders begin to square back your head begins to lift up you begin to look at every situation different because the conference empowers you with information and Revelation and knowledge you didn't have before because the secret things belong to God but those things which are revealed it's in the conference that God could give you Revelation that's why we have this conference this morning so that divine revelation could drop down to let you know who you are who the devil is and who God is to know that every promise is yours H hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh God I want a conference I'm not leaving here this morning until I have my personal conference I don't want to talk to the pastor I don't want to talk to the Deacon I don't want to talk to the Elder I came to talk to God I came for a conference with the Lord that's what I came for this morning I didn't come to see you I didn't come to see anybody else I came for a conference but there's something burning in my heart and there was somebody who had a need his name was Nicodemus and he looked and he searched he was a secret believer he had questions in his heart he had been in church a long time he had been a religious man but he was looking for a conference and he went to Jesus he said come let us reason together how shall a man get eternal life he going to reason and he reasoned and Jesus said you must be born again and all of a sudden a transition be to take place because he had a conference Hallelujah he may be seated Hall there are only two outcomes all right of the conference you either get better or you get worse here's another man he has question in his heart and he comes to Jesus this is no longer the Jesus of the Old Testament this is the Jesus of the New Testament so he's walking around you could see him you could touch him you could talk to him you could invite him to your house you could you could you could you could touch him he is there and this man come to Jesus Jesus he's a young man what shall I do to inherit eternal life oh my God and Jesus is now in the conference they're reasoning together all right and he says if you obey the Commandments obey the Lord all right obey your father and mother do everything you'll be all right he said but but I've done all this from my youth what laer yet now they're reasoning together amen they're trying to resolve the situation right he has a question in his heart and he had reached a point he couldn't go further because he knew deep down he was missing something that's why he asked a question what lack I yet he was not feeling comfortable that's why he asked the question what lack I yet because I come to church and when I try to shout and jump and I do the motion but I still missing something wasn't like yet and they reason it together Hallelujah and Jesus said go sell all that you have and give to the PO and the man walked away sorrowful because he had something in his heart that the conference revealed yes it may have been on a subconscious level something he had but he wasn't even conscious of how deep it has affecting his life it took that reasoning together to give him the answer so that he could fix the problem and the B said Jesus loved him but that man he walked away sorrowful hallelujah hallelujah conference with God hallu how will you leave this conference today amen yet there's another who walks up to Jesus he said Jesus my servant is sick my servant is dying I've come to reason I've heard the testimonies I've I've seen things and and and I know if you Hallelujah I'm not even worthy for you to come to my roof just say the word see I'm a man under Authority when I say to one go he goeth when I say to one come he comes if you just speak he's reasoning he's negotiating he's talking he's pleading just say the word Jesus is astonished because this man he's a gentile but he tapped into Isaiah come let us reason together he reached there in a scripture and he's coming he's having a conversation with Jesus J said go thy way thy servant is [Music] healed and Jesus turns to the elders and the deacons and say if only I can see this kind of faith in Israel who is this man this man left the conference and he didn't ask if my servant is healed he asked the question what time was he healed because he understood who he was in the conference with he understood who he was talking to he understood the God he was speaking [Applause] with conference with God what will be the outcome of your conference with God and yet there is another woman rushes up to Jesus Jesus my daughter is vexed with the devil come let us reason together Jesus said it's not fit it's not meat it's not appropriate to take the children's bread and cast it dogs you see reasoning is is a back and forth thing so she didn't just walk away and say you see I come all this way I pay to come church I come stand up in the line Theon didn't like anyway he said but even the dogs get crumbs from the master table hallu woman go your daughter is made well amen amen amen come friends let us reason together let's talk to Jesus he's here right now huj Hallelujah there's another woman she has her struggles not much information is given about her but she's trying her very best to make ends meet she's trying her very best to find herself in this world that she lives in Hallelujah she's not a Jew she's a Samaritan all right she's related to the Jews like the cousins and she's struggling with herself Hallelujah she had one husband that didn't work out she had another one that didn't work out she had another one that didn't work out she had another one that didn't work out Jesus and it feels like a spiral that doesn't just have an answer until the day of her conference when she has an appointment she didn't even know she had she shows up on her regular routine and there standing at the well is somebody who is looking very tired because the Bible said he was tired and he had sent the disciples away to find food they have been hungry and he has a conversation and they reasoning together water how you can bring water you have the well we get water who who build the well until all of a sudden he ask the real question in the conference go call your husband yes amen and she says well the one I have is in M she said I have none he said he said yes you have five and one with and all of a sudden that conference revealed to her but nobody else was able to identify her problem amen amen and she ran away yes totally free how will you leave this conference this morning I'm getting ready to wind down there's another conference there there there quite a many there quite a many conferences there's a conference where Jesus goes to Gethsemane and Gethsemane it was not the first time Jesus was there Jesus was used to go into Gethsemane but this time was different yes Hallelujah he is there and it's a different kind of a conference it's the first time we see Jesus almost completely vulnerable because the weight of sin is slowly beginning to creep onto his shoulders and he's coming to terms with his Destiny yeah yeah and the human or Humanity or the or that that side of him begin to show be say Lord if it is possible Hallelujah let this cup pass and in that conference he is battling and he's wrestling until he reached the point of overcoming amen friends we need to talk to God hallelujah amen and there's another conference where Jesus is th arrested and in front of pilate in St John 18 and then pilate entered into the Judgment Hall again and called Jesus and said unto him are thou the king of the Jews Jesus answered them saying sayest thou this thing of thyself or did others tell it the of me Hallelujah they reasoning together pilate answered am I a Jew dine own nation and the chief priest have delivered thee unto me what hast thou done Jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from hence pilate therefore said unto him adou a king then Jesus answered thou say said I am a king to this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice pilate said unto him what is the truth and when he had said this he went out again unto the Jews and said unto him I find in him no fault at all they were reasoning together and pilot asks the question what is the truth and friends maybe you came this

the Lion's Den they thought he would be dead but the truth was from his conference he overcame all right they put the Hebrew boys in the L in the fiery furnace and they thought that they'd be burnt up but the truth was from their conference they walked right out of there when they locked Samson in the seity they thought that they had him cage but the truth was he was going to walk free and when they killed Jesus they thought he was going to stay dead but then he rose from the dead that is the truth you shall know the truth amen and the truth will set you free amen hallelujah the conference
