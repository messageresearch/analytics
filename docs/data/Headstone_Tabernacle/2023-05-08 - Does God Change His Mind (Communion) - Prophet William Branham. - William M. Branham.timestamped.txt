[20:53] God so you may have your seats at this

[21:00] does God change his mind amen so may God
[21:03] richly bless you with no Hearts as we
[21:06] receive the ability man
[21:18] Heavenly Father we thank you forever
[21:21] graceful thing that you have given to us
[21:23] we're Unworthy of of any of your
[21:26] blessings these are certainly unmerited
[21:29] blessings that we receive
[21:31] and we pray God that you will continue
[21:33] to be with us this walking in and
[21:35] feeling this wonderful spirit and a
[21:37] meaning I know it comes from you so I
[21:40] pray father that you'll continue to
[21:43] honor the meeting tonight with your
[21:45] presence and heal all the sick and
[21:47] inflicted granted may this be a great
[21:50] night that will not forget soon because
[21:53] of your presence we ask that in Jesus
[21:55] name amen amen praise God
[22:03] I want to apologize for keeping so late
[22:06] last evening I will try to be faster
[22:08] tonight and just so we can hurry up and
[22:12] and pray for the sake
[22:14] I certainly felt good about last night's
[22:17] meeting it seemed like that there was
[22:19] many people got here and I had plenty of
[22:22] support everybody praying and together
[22:24] that's the way we stand so the Lord
[22:26] bless you now I think tomorrow night
[22:29] we're to be I guess they've already
[22:30] announced that it's another another
[22:31] place all right now let's turn into Book
[22:35] of Numbers the 22nd chapter a right
[22:37] quick for uh just a little text to pass
[22:40] a few comments and then we'll go to
[22:42] place them most of the time in the
[22:44] prayer line Billy said he gave out
[22:46] enormous amount of cars two three
[22:48] hundred of them and it'll take quite a
[22:50] while to get them through the prayer
[22:51] line so I I will just speak for a few
[22:54] minutes not over 30 minutes if possible
[22:57] and then uh start the prayer line pray
[23:00] for the sake
[23:02] and Deuteronomy and pardon me a number
[23:05] is 22nd chapter and the 31st verse
[23:11] I wish to read this and the Lord opened
[23:14] the eyes of Balaam and he saw the angel
[23:18] of the Lord standing in the way
[23:20] and his sword drawn in his hand and he
[23:24] bowed down his head and fell flat on his
[23:27] face
[23:29] now this may sound like a rude little
[23:31] hex or uh just a to give a stand and to
[23:37] have our healing service and I'm going
[23:39] to try to have a prayer line started by
[23:41] nine o'clock if possible now I want to
[23:45] take the subject tonight does God change
[23:48] his mind
[23:49] you know we can change our mind
[23:52] and because we we learn a little
[23:54] different we know we were wrong but I
[23:58] don't believe that God can change his
[23:59] mind because if he does then he
[24:02] certainly uh could not be infinite and
[24:06] he can make a better decision if he
[24:07] would change it so he the faith that I
[24:11] have in him that that he doesn't change
[24:14] his mind because if God ever makes the
[24:17] decision he has to stay with that
[24:19] decision I think and each time the same
[24:22] problem comes up he's got to act in the
[24:25] same way he did the first time or he
[24:27] acted wrong in the first time see so it
[24:30] gives us somewhere to have a basic Faith
[24:32] now we cannot yes Faith isn't just a
[24:36] loose leaf something that you can fly at
[24:38] ear and over somewhere else it's
[24:39] something that's got to be sure it's got
[24:42] to be stable and now I cannot base my
[24:45] faith upon
[24:46] some Theory it's got to be a proven back
[24:50] before I can have faith like a man
[24:52] choosing a wife to marry while he he's
[24:55] got to have faith in that woman he
[24:57] marries her he certainly is fixing
[24:59] himself for a lot of trouble so he's uh
[25:02] got that you got to have faith Some
[25:04] solid facts some Faith the base of upon
[25:07] upon her word upon what somebody else
[25:09] has said or something he's got to have
[25:11] something to place his face on faith on
[25:13] so I feel that
[25:18] to meet God there's just one thing that
[25:20] I can base my faith upon and that's his
[25:23] word
[25:24] because we have different ideas
[25:27] for near all of us we'd sit down and go
[25:29] to even talk about something to eat
[25:31] while we were different on something to
[25:33] eat and we made different our appetites
[25:36] are different and therefore it makes our
[25:39] churches we see they are different in
[25:40] their ideas of what's right and what's
[25:43] wrong that gives us everyone a privilege
[25:46] to take a choice but to me uh I believe
[25:49] that the word of God is right now I
[25:51] don't believe it's of any private
[25:53] interpretation I believe it's just what
[25:54] it says that's the truth and that's why
[25:57] I take it just on the basics of it being
[25:59] the word of God and I haven't got faith
[26:02] enough maybe to make all of it Act
[26:05] but I certainly wouldn't want to stand
[26:06] in the way of somebody who did have
[26:08] faith enough to make an act like for
[26:10] instance Enoch had enough faith that he
[26:12] didn't have to die just took an
[26:13] afternoon stroll and got tired here on
[26:15] Earth it's walked on up to heaven I'd
[26:18] certainly like to have faith like that
[26:19] but
[26:20] I hope that we do get that Faith someday
[26:24] as we grow on into him
[26:27] our reason I chose this place because it
[26:30] seems like that here to me is one all
[26:33] the places in the Bible that would spear
[26:36] a critical place for the text tonight
[26:39] because it looks like that God did
[26:42] change his mind and told Balaam one
[26:45] thing to do and then told him something
[26:46] else to do so I thought maybe just for a
[26:49] while we try to straighten this out just
[26:51] a little and see what he really told him
[26:54] so now uh to outline this we know that
[26:59] Balaam
[27:01] was a a prophet and balik was the king
[27:05] of Moab at the time and they were not
[27:08] infidels up at Moab they served the same
[27:11] God that Israel served because moeb the
[27:14] nation was founded by Lots
[27:18] a son by his daughter
[27:21] and so they serve the same God if you
[27:24] notice their sacrifices and everything
[27:26] was just exactly the same Bullocks and
[27:29] also the Rams speaking uh the second
[27:32] coming and now if uh fundamentalism is
[27:36] all that God requires then Moab or just
[27:40] as fundamental in his offering as what
[27:44] Israel was but we find them now Israel
[27:47] is in the line of following the word of
[27:51] God to a land that have been promised
[27:54] them and they come here would be a type
[27:58] of the natural and spiritual meaning and
[28:02] when the natural and spiritual meets
[28:04] there's always a collision because they
[28:08] run right head on into each other and
[28:11] Israel here would I want to represent it
[28:14] as a spiritual church and Moab as the
[28:17] natural church just the church what we
[28:20] call Church natural and we're all sure
[28:23] that there is a a church and there is a
[28:27] bride coming out of that church we know
[28:30] that that is true and they Clash here
[28:33] and we notice that when they Clash here
[28:35] it come under something that I would
[28:38] like to speak a moment on as soon as
[28:41] they clashed in one scene what the other
[28:42] was doing there was a great
[28:44] impersonation one or the other and
[28:48] that's where we find it today that we do
[28:50] get too much impersonations and when you
[28:54] do that you're always in trouble you
[28:56] cannot live the other fellow's life we
[28:59] cannot impersonate something we must be
[29:02] just what we are you must never try to
[29:05] if this fellow does something because he
[29:07] does it you think you have to too you
[29:09] don't do that you're an individual to
[29:12] God and we mustn't try to impersonate
[29:14] each other and now Israel right in the
[29:17] line of duty marching on their way to a
[29:20] commandment our commandment of God to a
[29:23] promised land they clash with Moab
[29:25] another group of believers and uh I hope
[29:30] this doesn't sound too bad but the
[29:33] little illustration I want to make here
[29:34] is Moe have been settled down in a land
[29:37] he was more like an organized Affair he
[29:42] had his celebrities and his uh uh
[29:45] dignitaries of the of his kingdom but
[29:48] Israel was just a a Wanderer they had no
[29:52] certain place they went they just
[29:54] wandered as the Lord
[29:56] LED them I believe also Balaam later in
[30:00] his prophecy said that people would not
[30:02] be among the Nations it would just be a
[30:05] scattered and that's what it's always
[30:06] been and we find out the Clash Come Just
[30:09] As Cain and Abel they also came together
[30:13] in a collage
[30:15] and then being a brothers and both of
[30:19] them of the same mother Eve and we find
[30:23] that they realize that they were mortal
[30:26] and they had been put out of life out of
[30:29] the garden of life and they both were
[30:32] trying to find a way to get back in
[30:33] there and if you notice both boys was
[30:37] very religious teen was just as
[30:40] religious as Abel was and they both
[30:42] built altars otherwise a church that
[30:45] both made sacrifice they both prayed and
[30:48] they they served God both of them but
[30:51] one of them served him wrong I see you
[30:54] can be ever so sincere and yet be wrong
[30:58] you could be wrong there is a way to
[31:00] seemeth right
[31:02] but the in thereof is the ways of death
[31:04] now we we see that this is so true with
[31:07] Cain and Abel and when they seen Cain
[31:12] saw that Abel's sacrifice was received
[31:15] and I might stop here to say why did God
[31:19] receive uh his sacrifice is because that
[31:24] that he was by a revelation he
[31:28] understood that it was not apples or I
[31:31] believe that now they got the
[31:31] pomegranates or something that they eat
[31:33] in the Garden of Eden that the caused
[31:35] sin and he found Adam or I mean Abel
[31:40] believed that if it was blood which it
[31:43] really was and Abel by Revelation Faith
[31:48] offered unto God a more excellent
[31:50] sacrifice than that of Cain which God
[31:53] testified but he was righteous see in
[31:56] the whole church is built upon a divine
[32:00] revelation of the word of God
[32:03] the whole Jesus said so one day coming
[32:07] down off the mountain he said to his
[32:09] disciples who do you see are the son of
[32:10] man am or who does people say I am and
[32:13] some of them said well your Moses your
[32:15] Elias or one of the prophets he said but
[32:18] who do you say I am and Peter made that
[32:20] great statement Thou Art the Christ the
[32:22] son of the Living God he said blessed
[32:25] art thou Simon son of Jonas and here is
[32:27] the great argument amongst Believers now
[32:29] the Catholic Church says that there he
[32:31] he built his church upon Peter or said
[32:36] that Peter a little Stone upon this
[32:39] Stone little Stone I'll build my church
[32:40] well now the Protestant mostly believe
[32:43] that it was upon himself that he built
[32:46] upon him the Cornerstone
[32:48] but you see he was the Cornerstone to
[32:51] the building I believe that what he
[32:53] built a church upon not to be different
[32:56] but you see the question was who does
[32:58] man say I am and Peter said the art the
[33:02] Christ the son of the Living God he said
[33:04] blessed art thou silence son of Jonas
[33:06] Flesh and Blood never reveal this to you
[33:08] you never learned this by going to a
[33:10] seminary
[33:11] see you never learned this for some uh
[33:14] man-made Affair but my Father which is
[33:17] in heaven has revealed this to you
[33:19] upon this rubber I'll build my church
[33:23] and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[33:26] against it the spiritual revelation of
[33:29] Jesus Christ who is the word
[33:32] let it be the spiritual revealed truth
[33:35] of the word is exactly where the church
[33:38] rests I think that's what Abel had at
[33:42] the beginning a spiritual Revelation
[33:44] that it wasn't the fruit of the field or
[33:46] the works of our hands or so forth it
[33:48] was blood and he offered uh to God a
[33:52] more excellent sacrifice than than caned
[33:54] in we find in Abraham and lot the same
[33:57] thing in a choice because lot went down
[34:00] when the time come when the spiritual
[34:02] and the and the natural Church come in a
[34:06] clash because of the herdsmen they had
[34:08] to separate one for another and whenever
[34:11] this does it sets up a jealousy
[34:14] we find out that Abel be because God had
[34:18] received him and he did not receive
[34:20] Kings beautiful big offering in your
[34:23] toils the hard part was religious and
[34:26] bowed down and worshiped and so forth
[34:28] done everything that Abel did only he
[34:31] didn't have the revelation of what was
[34:33] the truth
[34:34] so we find out that when God accepted
[34:38] Abel's uh Revelation and his offering it
[34:42] made King get jealous of Abel and there
[34:44] was the first murder we find out that
[34:47] jealousy become between the herdsmen of
[34:49] Abraham and lot and they had to separate
[34:51] we find out that Moses and clorah had a
[34:54] clash also Jesus and Judas had a clash
[34:58] and as ever it's been the same thing and
[35:01] so is it today the natural church and
[35:04] the spiritual church has a clash when
[35:07] they come together now the natural tries
[35:11] to match the spiritual always with a
[35:14] carnal impersonation
[35:16] but as it was with Esau and Jacob it
[35:19] will not work God has his church called
[35:24] named set aside and in the ages she
[35:28] lives in he'll reveal himself to her
[35:30] each and every time just as he said in
[35:33] Romans 8 chapter that the foreknowledge
[35:36] of predestination of God might stand
[35:38] sure King uh being Esau and Jacob before
[35:41] either boy was born before they even had
[35:45] a chance to make a choice God said I
[35:48] hate Esau and love Jacob or he knew what
[35:51] was in them from the beginning and we
[35:54] know we're in keep that in mind he knows
[35:56] what's in your heart he knows what you
[35:59] mean no matter what we say he knows what
[36:01] you mean
[36:02] and it's always cause trouble and they
[36:06] uh the always the natural always tries
[36:10] since teen destroyed Abel the natural
[36:13] has always tried to destroy the effects
[36:16] of the spiritual we find it the same
[36:18] thing today the very same thing today it
[36:21] proves that it comes from Satan because
[36:23] it's jealousy and impersonation of Truth
[36:26] so we really believe that God never
[36:29] changes his mind about what he says he
[36:31] always keeps the truth but he has a
[36:34] permissive will now there were the
[36:37] trouble leads we try to work on God's
[36:40] permissive will and he will permit it
[36:44] but also if we take his permissive will
[36:47] though it's not right he will make his
[36:50] permissive will to work out together to
[36:53] glorify his perfect will there's nothing
[36:56] will go wrong with God where he knows
[36:58] just where the clocks are taken at
[37:00] tonight there's nothing wrong every lick
[37:02] is hidden just exactly the way it should
[37:04] be everything we think it's wrong but he
[37:07] knows it's right it's forced to be like
[37:09] this like at the beginning God just
[37:13] permitted
[37:14] he did not that wasn't his perfect will
[37:17] but you see God the great spirit the
[37:20] father in him was attributes and these
[37:23] things that you see displayed now and
[37:25] just his attributes being displayed he
[37:29] dwelt alone he was not even God God was
[37:32] an object of worship he was a great
[37:34] Eternal one
[37:35] and in him was attributes such as to be
[37:39] father to be savior to be healer and now
[37:43] how could he first he had to be father
[37:46] because it proves he was father but he
[37:48] dwells alone he alone is Immortal and
[37:52] now but his attributes has to be
[37:54] displayed now to be a savior there has
[37:56] to be something lost
[37:57] and God cannot purposely lose anything
[38:00] and then redeem it it wouldn't be
[38:02] becoming to his Holiness and his great
[38:05] uh a judgment but he put man on free
[38:08] moral agency knowing that man would fall
[38:12] and in that then he became man himself
[38:15] in order to redeem Batman
[38:17] that fell that's the reason that Jesus
[38:20] was Emmanuel
[38:23] if God sent another person besides
[38:25] himself then that wouldn't be just God
[38:28] had to come himself and take place and
[38:31] God could not be come down in spirit and
[38:33] take place he had to be made flesh In
[38:36] the Flesh of his own creative son
[38:38] and he showed here in the beginning that
[38:40] his perfect will was to create Man Out
[38:43] of the Dust of the Earth
[38:45] but you see he permitted sex to be
[38:47] brought him he never did intend children
[38:49] to be born by sex but it was permitted
[38:52] which soon will fade away now we find
[38:55] out that Moab was a illegitimate to
[38:59] begin with because it was lots Son by
[39:03] his own daughter
[39:05] now notice as the natural Church Moab
[39:09] represents the natural Church boy a
[39:11] dozen Israel the spiritual church now
[39:14] Israel the bride was the represents the
[39:17] called out the church itself the word
[39:21] church means called out one
[39:24] come out those who have come out come
[39:28] out of her my people be separated and
[39:30] saith the Lord and I will receive you
[39:33] unto my self-touch not their unclean
[39:35] things the Church of God is called out
[39:38] of the world
[39:40] out of the chaos of the world you're no
[39:43] more of the world as I was trying to say
[39:45] the other night to you it's uh when you
[39:47] know that you have the earnest of your
[39:50] of your Eternal Redemption right now in
[39:52] You by the baptism of the holy spirit
[39:54] it's already quickened you you are now
[39:57] risen with him and we're sitting
[39:59] together in Heavenly places in Christ
[40:01] Jesus see you're no more of the world if
[40:04] you love the world and your affections
[40:06] are still on the things of the world
[40:07] then the love of God's not even in you
[40:09] see we are from free from the world
[40:12] there's no more desire in the Hebrews I
[40:15] believe the 10th chapter said uh there
[40:17] was a continually remember it's a sin
[40:19] each year those BEAST's body was offered
[40:21] but in this case the worshiper once
[40:24] purged
[40:25] has no more conscience of sin
[40:28] no more desire to sin the whole thing is
[40:33] gone from you because you have been
[40:35] quickened into a new life
[40:37] and then the church naturally just
[40:39] defeat bunch of people and denominations
[40:40] to join it's no more I don't even know
[40:43] more call it church I don't like to
[40:45] refer to it I like to refer to it as a
[40:47] lodge Methodist Lodge Baptist Lord
[40:49] Pentecostal Lodge but the churches are
[40:52] born again it's in Christ Jesus that's
[40:54] new creatures and so we still see that
[40:57] that God keeps his word now a mole seen
[41:02] Moab looked down upon the field in
[41:06] seeing God moving amongst this people
[41:08] who was not even an organized Nation
[41:11] they were just floating around from
[41:14] place to place but the strange thing
[41:16] that they come upon these nations and
[41:19] they took them everything was in the
[41:20] road they took them down
[41:23] they found out more looking up on it
[41:26] Bailey he looked down upon the nation of
[41:29] Israel and he said the people cover the
[41:31] whole face of the Earth
[41:32] he said in the lick up the Nations it's
[41:35] like an ox licking up grass
[41:37] and they found out one of the great
[41:39] Keynotes was that
[41:42] how they got this great Revelation there
[41:45] was a prophet among them
[41:47] they had a prophet now someone that led
[41:51] them it wasn't a man-made system like he
[41:55] was used to uh is is delegations with
[41:58] him and so forth but it was in his
[42:00] dignitaries but they had a leader a
[42:04] Divine call leader and oh what a sad day
[42:10] it was when the church World left off
[42:13] the Divine leadership of the Holy Ghost
[42:16] and adopted a bishop or anything else to
[42:18] take its way it was a sad day
[42:21] the holy spirit is to be the leader of
[42:25] the church he is sent to confirm the
[42:28] words of Jesus Christ to make the church
[42:31] live as it did live at the beginning not
[42:34] long ago a very famous uh School here in
[42:38] in this city uh Seminary and uh they
[42:42] have one in Phoenix
[42:44] and one of the men or a couple of the
[42:46] students was came down to me and said uh
[42:49] we like you brother Branham we don't
[42:52] have nothing in you at all but we just
[42:54] like to straighten you out and I said
[42:56] well I sure want to be straight in that
[42:58] hustle and so I said if I'm wrong I
[43:00] certainly don't want to be wrong I'll
[43:02] talk to too many people and um he said
[43:04] well here's your trouble said you are
[43:07] trying to introduce or to make live
[43:11] again an Apostolic religion when the
[43:15] apostolic religion ceased with the
[43:17] apostles
[43:18] and um I said yes sir I said well now if
[43:23] he said I wouldn't debate it with you I
[43:25] said I wouldn't either we don't we're
[43:26] not supposed to do that we're Brethren
[43:28] and he said well he said I would just
[43:31] like to help you I said I'm certainly
[43:33] willing to get help and he said um now
[43:36] you see he said now the uh uh that's
[43:39] true and I said now on talking we
[43:42] mustn't use uh textbooks I said I won't
[43:45] use mine I had none but this one but so
[43:49] so but I said I won't use textbook just
[43:51] the Bible and you we just use the Bible
[43:53] it's all right I said now we believe
[43:56] that the Apostolic Church began at the
[43:58] day of Pentecost do you agree with that
[44:00] he said yes I do I said now we realize
[44:02] that God gave the church power there for
[44:05] these Apostolic movements he said yes
[44:07] that was the framework of the church now
[44:10] the church is already set in the order
[44:11] and we got over pastors and our great
[44:13] organizations and things we don't need
[44:15] those things anymore to draw people I
[44:18] said now where does the bible say that
[44:21] I said you tell me where the Bible says
[44:23] that at
[44:24] and he said well it doesn't exactly say
[44:27] that in that way I said well then I
[44:29] can't receive it lest it says it just in
[44:30] that way now I said we're I said that's
[44:33] where it has to be I said do you believe
[44:34] that God's still calling people he said
[44:36] yes sir I said now you will believe that
[44:39] the Bible is correct ever answer yeah I
[44:42] said now the spokesman at the day of
[44:44] Pentecost was Peter who had the keys to
[44:47] the kingdom that's right now I said now
[44:50] whatever his decision was Jesus said
[44:52] what you bind on Earth I bind in heaven
[44:54] once you're loose on Earth I'll loose in
[44:56] heaven said I'll believe that I said now
[44:59] in Acts the second chapter 38 verse
[45:02] Peter said to those people who were
[45:04] marbling these people speaking in
[45:05] unknown tongues and uh they asked him
[45:08] what they could do to be saved and he
[45:11] said repeat everyone if you'd be
[45:13] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[45:14] their ambitious sins you shall receive
[45:16] the gift of the Holy Ghost for the
[45:18] promise
[45:20] isn't he you and to your children and to
[45:23] them it's for all even as many as the
[45:26] Lord Our God shall call now God's still
[45:29] calling that same problem is for them
[45:33] well he come over here with one of Billy
[45:35] Graham's groups up here praying for a
[45:37] meeting and a group of them sitting up
[45:39] here in California somewhere a few weeks
[45:41] ago in real deep sincere prayer
[45:44] consecrated to God fasting in the Holy
[45:46] Ghost fell on the whole bunch and begin
[45:48] to speak in other tongues and
[45:53] member of the of the Friendly Church the
[45:56] Assemblies of God in Tucson Arizona he
[45:59] said oh brother random or go up there
[46:01] and feel so good so just raise back my
[46:02] hands and said the glory of God I just
[46:04] sang and said I never could do that in
[46:06] the New Testament Baptist Church I said
[46:08] I see you can but you're out so there
[46:12] you are see God keeps his word what he
[46:16] says he'll do it God has to keep his
[46:18] word now we find out here that this
[46:22] carnal impersonation that boy have had
[46:24] he saw this Prophet among Israel that
[46:28] was able to bless curse lead and so
[46:30] forth so he tries to match it by
[46:34] politics now that's just what's taken
[46:37] place in the churches today they have
[46:39] tried to match it with some kind of a
[46:42] system you can't do it the Holy Spirit
[46:45] must be alive in the church always
[46:47] leading the church for the age that it's
[46:49] living in to confirm the word his
[46:52] promise for that age
[46:53] God spoke the word from the beginning
[46:55] and it's so much for this age and so
[46:57] much for that age and certain for them
[46:59] age it always happens just that way and
[47:01] seeing the Holy Spirit must be alive in
[47:03] the church to make this church live its
[47:05] day it must be here today to confirm
[47:07] this Latter-Day Ministry latter days
[47:10] signs Latter-Day pour out of the Holy
[47:13] Ghost it's just got to be here to do
[47:14] that and you cannot get it through the
[47:17] working of systems God has the system he
[47:20] is the one who's give us the Holy Spirit
[47:22] now we know to sure that Moses had a
[47:26] king and that King was God that anointed
[47:30] him and Balaam also was under a king
[47:34] Bailey and it was more like a political
[47:38] setup see balik
[47:41] Balaam a prophet of God he went to balak
[47:44] for his information
[47:45] Moses went to God for information there
[47:49] was a difference yet both of them are
[47:51] prophets
[47:52] because they were both called of God
[47:54] both met God both talked to God and both
[47:58] Spirit-filled I'm coming Holmes
[48:01] now they were both Spirit-filled man
[48:05] now that is true the Bible said that God
[48:08] met with them and talked with him see so
[48:11] we noticed each one of these prophets
[48:14] both of them being prophets man of God
[48:16] they catered to their headship Moses
[48:20] catered to God and Balaam here tailored
[48:24] to Bailey notice sure and typing the
[48:27] spiritual and the natural how perfect it
[48:29] was Moses sent by God in a line of duty
[48:33] is met and challenged by another man of
[48:37] God
[48:38] could you imagine such but look what a
[48:42] set up they had up there it was an
[48:44] organized Nation
[48:47] and Moses was leading the children of
[48:50] Israel just as God would tell them where
[48:52] to go led by a pillar of Fire
[48:55] and a supernatural being that was
[48:57] leading the way and Moses was getting
[48:59] his information through the logus of
[49:01] course it went out of God that pillar
[49:03] afar which was the angel of the Covenant
[49:05] which was Christ the anointed one and he
[49:09] was getting his message there and giving
[49:11] it to the children of Israel on the road
[49:13] to a Promised Land but this man was all
[49:15] settled down and he had his kingdom he
[49:18] had his churches he had everything right
[49:19] there in order so he sent order to get
[49:21] this man to come over and to curse this
[49:24] people and notice could you imagine that
[49:27] one Prophet one man of God
[49:31] seeing the works of God with another man
[49:34] and try to to challenge that works of
[49:38] God when he knew until no better now
[49:41] Balaam uh first when balik sent to him
[49:45] and told him come over and curse this
[49:47] people now balik done the very thing
[49:50] another done the thing that was right he
[49:53] sought God he's thought God first now
[49:56] that's what he ought to have done
[49:57] and then God Gidding is Perfect Clean
[50:01] Cut answer don't go with him
[50:05] leave him alone don't you curse those
[50:08] people they are blessed
[50:10] now that ought to be enough
[50:13] When God says anything he cannot change
[50:16] that
[50:17] notice his perfect will was don't you go
[50:21] don't attack that people they're my
[50:24] people
[50:26] that was his perfect will
[50:28] but Salem didn't like those people to
[50:32] begin with see there you are how many
[50:35] valence do we have today
[50:39] same thing they know better they had
[50:41] them in the days of our Lord Jesus
[50:43] Nicodemus come and said Rabbi we know
[50:46] you're a man sent from God or or a
[50:49] teacher sent from God no man could do
[50:51] the things that you do unless God was
[50:52] with him see they knew it there was a
[50:54] Balaam against it
[50:56] Balaam didn't like the people notice his
[51:00] headquarters after they sent some fine
[51:03] man over there to tell him now there's
[51:04] some people coming up down here and I
[51:06] understand that you're a prophet you're
[51:08] a great man so you come up here and
[51:10] curse this people Balaam said now you
[51:11] wait a minute uh go in and pray and stay
[51:13] all night maybe the Lord will meet me
[51:15] and you'll tell me all right the next
[51:17] morning the Lord met with him and said
[51:19] don't go don't curse those people
[51:21] they're blessed all right balen went out
[51:24] and said well I can't go because the
[51:26] Lord told me not to go now
[51:28] notice when they went back and took the
[51:31] headquarters
[51:32] for him to go down there and stop this
[51:34] meeting they had you see well then come
[51:36] to find out the headquarters sent a
[51:39] better set of people
[51:41] higher dignitaries maybe a bishop
[51:44] somebody else or might have been a state
[51:46] president or somebody sent down there
[51:48] tell him to go down stop that anyhow see
[51:50] it notice is better influential group
[51:55] better gifts more money said I can exalt
[51:58] you to a better position I might make
[52:00] the instead of just in an ordinary man I
[52:02] can make you a little higher and I have
[52:04] the right to do that because I'm King
[52:05] here in this great movement and um I can
[52:08] do something better for you if you'll
[52:10] just do it notice the new offer blinded
[52:15] him
[52:16] he ought to have known what God Said God
[52:19] will do
[52:21] but it blinded him
[52:23] and as a prophet
[52:25] of God he should have not been
[52:27] influenced by such a group
[52:30] he should have got out of that group to
[52:32] begin with and if I'm talking to some
[52:34] man of God here when they try to tell
[52:37] you at the headquarters that the days of
[52:38] Miracles is passing this what we're
[52:40] doing here in the Lord Jesus is blessing
[52:42] us and that's a bunch of fanaticism work
[52:44] up and emotion there's no such a thing
[52:46] as Divine Healing get out of that group
[52:48] right there
[52:50] get out of it because it's the word of
[52:53] God being made manifest they say there's
[52:55] no such a thing as Apostolic days
[52:56] there's no baptism of the Holy Ghost
[52:58] that's speaking in tongues is nothing to
[53:00] it they're old but brother don't you
[53:02] listen to that there's a many one like
[53:05] balen today sitting back in their office
[53:06] reading these books of the Bible and
[53:08] know that it's the truth but yet just
[53:10] because of Physician's sake they won't
[53:13] take their stand
[53:15] just exactly right
[53:17] notice God
[53:20] he knew he shouldn't have been in this
[53:22] group or Balaam I should have known
[53:23] they they get out of the will of God
[53:27] then tell us a talk here out of the will
[53:29] of God when you find the will of God
[53:31] don't let nobody talk it out of it I
[53:34] know the good people come to the
[53:36] meetings get healed and go back and
[53:38] they'd say oh well there's nothing to do
[53:40] that you're just worked up and there's
[53:41] nothing good and the people go to
[53:42] doubting I see people come and receive
[53:44] Christ in their heart go back maybe
[53:46] speak in tongues and go back to the
[53:48] church and say why you're you're a
[53:49] disgraced to Christianity and so forth
[53:52] and oh my don't don't do that see it get
[53:55] out of that group stay away from them
[53:57] notice Balaam used a Brawny texture for
[54:01] his conscience in he uh said for
[54:04] adventure you stay another night and
[54:05] maybe I'll ask God you see maybe he
[54:07] might have changed his mind but God
[54:09] don't change his mind
[54:11] when God gave us a declaration of the
[54:14] baptism of the Holy Ghost on the day of
[54:16] Pentecost that's the way he has to keep
[54:18] it he did All Through the Bible age and
[54:20] he will any other time that man will
[54:22] come up on them bases that he offered
[54:24] there
[54:25] if you'll come believing repenting being
[54:28] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[54:30] the remission of your sins and believing
[54:32] on God God's obligated to fulfill that
[54:36] prescription
[54:37] right because he's the doctor and he'll
[54:40] fulfill it if you will if you will obey
[54:42] it but you can't afford now they'll try
[54:45] to get this prescription taken order
[54:47] some quack druggist that that might put
[54:49] something else in it it might kill the
[54:51] patient that's the reason we got so many
[54:53] dead church members today they're trying
[54:55] to give the wrong prescription God's got
[54:57] the prescription right here in the Bible
[55:02] [Music]
[55:04] you've got to take the medicine the way
[55:06] the doctor said give it the Bible said
[55:08] is there no is there no bomb in Gilead
[55:11] is there no physician there of course
[55:13] there is so then why is the daughter of
[55:15] my people in this condition see we got
[55:17] the Bible we got the physician it's just
[55:21] the druggist is miskilling the scripture
[55:23] prescription that's what it is you're
[55:26] trying to say the days of Miracles this
[55:27] past there's no such a thing as the
[55:29] baptism the Holy Ghost and all these
[55:30] Saints it's nonsense the Bible is
[55:32] exactly right God doesn't take back
[55:34] anything he said and they try to use a
[55:37] Brawny way out something another like
[55:39] well we believe that well now no matter
[55:41] what you believe it's what God said he
[55:44] said I will pour out my spirit upon All
[55:47] Flesh he promised this in the last day
[55:49] they try to say the meeting that you're
[55:52] seeing they call me a soosayer a
[55:54] polished up soosayer or a Beelzebub or
[55:57] some devil well they got to say that
[55:59] because they're the father that's what
[56:02] he said about Jesus at the beginning and
[56:03] it's not I'm doing this anyhow it's
[56:05] saying Jesus because he's the same
[56:07] yesterday today and forever it's his
[56:09] Spirit oh something that could pass
[56:12] bypassing for bypass his commission so
[56:15] many people try to bypass that oh come
[56:17] join the church and it'll be all right
[56:18] we're an old church we've been here for
[56:20] many years we started yes that's right
[56:22] if that's so then the Roman Catholic
[56:24] church has got to own all of you they're
[56:25] the first of the organizations Dave was
[56:28] first but remember not the first church
[56:30] that is the first organization and the
[56:32] mother of every one of them whichever
[56:34] one of them is contrary to God
[56:36] Revelation 17 says the same thing
[56:42] yes we are in the last days now remember
[56:46] God will let you go see now and then
[56:49] Balaam he thought well then God told him
[56:52] go on why God knew what was in his heart
[56:56] God knew that was in his heart to begin
[56:58] with so he told him to go on he will
[57:00] permit it he will permit you to do it he
[57:03] will bless you many times in doing it he
[57:05] blessed even Israel and to the grace
[57:08] that already given Prophet Pillar of
[57:11] Fire a Deliverance signs and wonders
[57:13] brought him out of Egypt and everything
[57:14] and yet they wanted them all God let
[57:17] them have it but he cursed them all the
[57:18] time he let Balaam go on just the way
[57:21] he's supposed to but what did he do he
[57:23] went down there and
[57:25] instead of cursing the people he had to
[57:28] bless the people he could not curse what
[57:30] God had blessed and I I told you to go
[57:34] to quit at nine and I looked up and it's
[57:35] time now and I got a book full of notes
[57:38] here but I want to say this in closing
[57:40] that God never changed his mind
[57:45] his direct will was for Balaam not to go
[57:51] and when God makes a statement it has to
[57:54] ever remain true now the Bible said
[57:57] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[58:00] and forever now that don't mean in a
[58:03] certain way that means he's the same
[58:04] yesterday today and forever Jesus said
[58:07] in Saint John 14 12 he that believeth on
[58:09] me the works that I do
[58:12] shall he do also
[58:16] is that right
[58:17] he promised in Mark 16 these signs shall
[58:21] follow them that believe
[58:24] they say well that was just for the
[58:25] apostles he said go ye into all the
[58:28] world and preach the gospel to Every
[58:30] Creature these signs shall follow them
[58:33] in all the world into every creature
[58:35] in my name they shall cast out Devils
[58:37] they shall speak with new tongues if
[58:39] they take up serpents or drink deadly
[58:41] things it wouldn't harm them yet they
[58:42] lay their hands on the sick they shall
[58:44] recover now that is his qualification
[58:49] see we try to qualify something
[58:52] we are trying to make it qualify the
[58:55] church to what we think God's word is we
[58:57] can't qualify to the church we've got to
[58:59] qualify to God
[59:01] I've always said it's a great match in
[59:03] time you paint your step thread watch
[59:05] your neighbor paint Israel some of you
[59:07] women wear certainly kind of hat at
[59:09] church what's the rest of women get that
[59:11] Miss Jackson Kennedy had this sir water
[59:14] head haircut and look at all the women
[59:16] she wanted them to those sack colored
[59:18] aprons or things like that it's a
[59:19] scandalous for the woman to be on the
[59:21] street with a stretch Stone like that
[59:22] look at all the women doing the same
[59:24] thing it's an impersonation but that's
[59:26] in the world the church people picked it
[59:28] up and it's a shame that they do it it's
[59:32] wrong for him to do it it's a disgrace
[59:34] and when we see it creeping into
[59:37] Pentecost it's more disgraceful
[59:40] that is right but you see the church
[59:42] puts up with it and lets it go now we
[59:45] don't care I never cared whether my Coke
[59:47] match my trousers or my time that's my
[59:50] coat I want my experience to match God's
[59:52] Bible and his requirements and that's
[59:54] what we as Pentecostal people ought to
[59:56] do is have our experience just like
[59:59] theirs was because he's the same Jesus
[1:00:01] the Same Holy Ghost the same power he's
[1:00:04] living today and he lives Among Us it
[1:00:07] kind of reminds me of one day his mother
[1:00:10] had gone off from Jerusalem from the
[1:00:14] worship and his foster uh daddy Joseph
[1:00:17] and they went three days journey and is
[1:00:21] presuming that he was along with him and
[1:00:23] they found out that he wasn't there
[1:00:27] and you know I want to liken that today
[1:00:29] you know the church has had a
[1:00:31] three-stage journey
[1:00:33] Luther Wesley Finnegan
[1:00:38] three-stage Journey God will give him a
[1:00:40] message justification Luther you handle
[1:00:43] on to it then comes sanctification
[1:00:45] through Wesley then the baptism the holy
[1:00:47] spirit with Pentecost and I wonder if we
[1:00:49] didn't get off all on a big tantrum
[1:00:51] somewhere to build big things and do
[1:00:53] great things like Balaam had in his mind
[1:00:55] great organizations the one to outrun
[1:00:58] together and this and the more giving
[1:01:00] gold medals and Stars for Sunday school
[1:01:02] who could bring in the most members and
[1:01:03] taking us to anything into the church
[1:01:05] I'll tell you this one church is not a
[1:01:07] hypocrite in that's the Church of the
[1:01:09] Lord Jesus Christ that's baptized by the
[1:01:11] Holy Ghost
[1:01:12] you're not persuaded in there you're
[1:01:14] born in there you're sent in there by
[1:01:17] the Holy Spirit they found out
[1:01:20] the parent found out that he wasn't
[1:01:22] among them now in this hour this great
[1:01:26] crisis is on when we know that this
[1:01:29] nation is shaking not only the nation
[1:01:32] but the world is shaking
[1:01:34] it's at the end time there's not another
[1:01:36] thing that I know to happen but the
[1:01:39] Rapture the coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:01:40] Christ it's already and we see these
[1:01:43] gatherings all get every benefit this
[1:01:46] convention coming up get everything out
[1:01:48] of it you can get that's of God if you
[1:01:51] haven't got the Holy Ghost just put it
[1:01:52] in your mind you're not going to leave
[1:01:53] here until you get it that's the way to
[1:01:55] do it stay there because you this is
[1:01:57] might be your last opportunity they may
[1:01:59] never be another convention on this West
[1:02:01] Highway it may be beneath the sieve at
[1:02:04] that time for another one so we don't
[1:02:06] know what's going to happen so we we're
[1:02:08] looking for the judgments of God to come
[1:02:10] up on the Nations
[1:02:12] now may I say this they thought he was
[1:02:16] alone but they found out in the crisis
[1:02:18] that he wasn't he wasn't with them
[1:02:22] now we find out that in the time that
[1:02:25] when this great thing has been brought
[1:02:27] up and we find out that we're missing
[1:02:30] something in our churches and that is
[1:02:33] the power of Christ
[1:02:35] now look I don't want to criticize I
[1:02:37] love you and genuine true love always is
[1:02:41] corrective
[1:02:42] now we're a missing Christ in our church
[1:02:45] we're missing Christ amongst our
[1:02:47] Pentecostal people our brother and
[1:02:48] sisters there's something wrong
[1:02:50] the old-fashioned prayer meetings he
[1:02:52] used to have all day and night they
[1:02:54] don't have it no more
[1:02:55] our women used to wear long hair they
[1:02:57] don't do it anymore it would be a
[1:02:59] disgrace for women to paint and use
[1:03:01] paint back in the early days and act the
[1:03:03] way these women do something went wrong
[1:03:05] nothing wrong with Christ
[1:03:07] see but something went wrong
[1:03:11] something is somewhere the pulpit used
[1:03:13] to what a permitted such a thing as that
[1:03:15] but it does now see the crisis is on him
[1:03:18] we're missing something we're missing
[1:03:20] power that we ought to have whether the
[1:03:22] big machine ought to be running up in
[1:03:24] great signs and wonders well this
[1:03:25] feeling ought to be set and so full of
[1:03:27] power of God now to a sinner couldn't
[1:03:28] stay in here the Holy Spirit condemning
[1:03:30] it right quickly like that like ananias
[1:03:32] and surprised
[1:03:34] and we're missing something now what
[1:03:36] happened they went to look for him
[1:03:38] amongst her kinfolks
[1:03:40] and they didn't find him amongst their
[1:03:41] kin folks so where did they find him
[1:03:44] right back where they left and I think
[1:03:47] when our church got on this great
[1:03:49] organizational spree that we had the one
[1:03:53] had to out do the other and had to have
[1:03:55] a bigger churches and better class of
[1:03:56] people and better dress people and
[1:03:58] better singers and stand up there and I
[1:04:00] like good singing I like real good
[1:04:03] old-fashioned Pentecostal singing but I
[1:04:05] cannot stand that put on stuff that just
[1:04:07] simply don't go with me hold your breath
[1:04:09] to your blue in a face just to be heard
[1:04:11] I've even singing from your heart in the
[1:04:14] spirit of God like a hurting here a
[1:04:16] while ago
[1:04:17] I like good old-fashioned shouting but I
[1:04:20] think shouting and go on this that the
[1:04:21] music's going on or not the spirit of
[1:04:23] God upon the people it brings down the
[1:04:25] blessings and power of God I believe man
[1:04:28] can testify and sing and praise God at
[1:04:30] their work wherever they are
[1:04:33] truly and we're missing something where
[1:04:35] will we find him right or are we lifting
[1:04:39] in the word
[1:04:41] let us pray
[1:04:43] dear heavenly father
[1:04:46] one of these nights we're going to close
[1:04:49] this Bible the last time
[1:04:52] the last song is Going to Be Sung last
[1:04:55] sermon preached
[1:04:57] the last prayer line will be called
[1:05:00] the last sinner who will come in
[1:05:04] and then what
[1:05:06] oh dear God
[1:05:08] we don't want your permissive will
[1:05:10] father
[1:05:11] let us walk to your perfect will
[1:05:14] let us this does not take a word here
[1:05:16] and there and make it to fit a Dogma or
[1:05:18] a Creed or something let us take the
[1:05:20] word as it is
[1:05:22] believing the Full Gospel all that Jesus
[1:05:26] taught for us to do
[1:05:29] we do not believe that the Acts of the
[1:05:31] Apostles is just a framework we believe
[1:05:34] it's the word of God it's the acts of
[1:05:36] your Holy Spirit in the apostles and we
[1:05:39] believe that the same Holy Spirit Lord
[1:05:41] that come upon them and the way they
[1:05:43] acted it'll do the same thing in us when
[1:05:45] it comes up on us if it's the same
[1:05:47] spirit

[1:05:51] that we're just on the eve of it the
[1:05:53] start tomorrow night I pray heavenly

[1:06:13] Shake tremble
[1:06:15] May the presence of Jesus Christ come so
[1:06:18] real to the people that they can just
[1:06:22] close their eyes and see him walking
[1:06:24] among them

[1:16:36] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:16:39] which he was betrayed took bread
[1:16:43] and when he had given thanks he broke it
[1:16:45] and said take eat this is my body which
[1:16:49] is broken for you this do in remembrance
[1:16:52] of me
[1:16:55] after the same manner also he took the
[1:16:57] cup when he had stopped saying
[1:17:00] this cup is the New Testament in my
[1:17:02] blood
[1:17:03] this Dewey as often as he drink it in
[1:17:06] remembrance of me

[1:17:14] death till he comes
[1:17:16] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:17:19] and drink this cup of the Lord on
[1:17:22] worthily shall be guilty of the body and
[1:17:25] blood of the Lord
[1:17:27] but let a man examine himself
