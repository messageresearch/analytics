and amen god bless you and if of your Bibles let's go straight to the wood is a special service today it'll be in two parts I'll share something about AIESEC will come behind and share something with you I will have a prayer I am praise God reading from Isaiah chapter 61 we want to reverse one two three Daniel 12:1 verse was one only wanted to read from Romans chapter 13 verse 11 to 14 so we go to Isaiah chapter 61 we didn't voice one two three the spirit and remember Jesus will be using these same words in in Luke chapter 4 but this is the Spirit of God upon Isaiah this is Christ's Spirit speaking through him he said the Spirit of the Lord God is upon me this is that for Isaiah now this is him in the spirit speaking the Spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord had anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek he had sent me purpose to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of vengeance of our God to comfort all that mourn to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion to give them beauty for Ashes the oil of joy for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called trees of righteousness the planting of the Lord that he might be glorified and readin from Daniel chapter 12 real verse 1 and at that time shall Michael stand up the Great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to the same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book that is not a perhaps that is that a maybe everyone written in that book shall not perhaps that maybe shall be delivered a reading from Romans chapter 13 reading from verse 11 and that knowing the time that now it is high time to a week out of sleep for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed the night is far spent the days of him let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkenness and in chambering and wantonness not in strife and envying but putting on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not provisions for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof let's pray one more time father we thank you for your word come and inhabit your word Lord and speak out through your word by your spirit bless your people Lord and take me out of the way and O God the whole service today father may you be glorified and magnified and you said we ask it amen and amen you may be seated and as you sit down give God some prizes [Music] our title this morning another year of Jubilee then judgment another year of Jubilee then judgment and then I have a scripture inspiration revolution 2017 the spirit and the bride say come God will have a Speas for the spirit to anoint the bride to give that bride a voice oh praise the name of the Lord do you believe that so Caleb and Joshua there were men of feet they were men of integrity who know God said dong in Egypt I give you the land and that's good enough there wasn't there when Abram was alive but God told Abraham he you have seed with Cecilia in a strange land God will bring them all and they will get a land that they're gonna possess so they took the word from what God said and they believe the word oh praise God I give the land that's good enough they run to the people the people are mourning crying and so on but Caleb said we are well able to possess that land he's not right but they ought to fight for every inch of it so it's your line yes but are you gonna fight for it do you get what I'm saying it is your land but you have to fight for it and people have got relaxed and comfortable in the message just waiting for things to come their way but Jesus overcame by the world or glory arisen with a spirit but you had to overcome by the world or glory to God it is written it is written it is written by the word Oh hallelujah believer thank you Lord Jesus now what are you overcoming the overcome by your word let me say this again God made a promise God made a promise you've got to have a battle if everything comes lazy what are you overcoming so if everything going on you whatever you want like a spoiled child you want this your cry fake God give it to you God give it to you God give it to you everything is just fine you're blessed without stress and you know people have those small quotations and so on but that's not what we are promised here now it will go tell Joshua every place you put your foot is yours the land is yours but you're gonna fight fair he'll miss yours deliverance is yours victory is yours joy is yours reach it that's yours too Oh hallelujah holy wars overcoming power that's yours too everything God promising about that's yours but you're gonna fight for it are you gonna fight for it this morning I wanna a salute you this morning I didn't even know that they say there will be terrible weather today and you did you didn't bother with that and it look like what cancel the terrible weather because you got fit to come here bad weather praise God but you have yet to come this morning you didn't bother with the weather because you were bidden about your deliverance than what the waiter at the scene and go up a roll-back storm weather rain Go Go push all that back because he won't you get a breakthrough that's why you were here this morning and if you come for a bridge Sugamo give you a breakthrough Oh what is that a man I would like you wouldn't lie praise God and bring your son Lord or glory to God he bring you for deliverance he bring you for a breakthrough we believe that so the overcame by the Word of God and that by the testimony and by the blood of Christ you've got to overcome something so you have got to have some obstacles when I hear a shout on that one you've got to have some obstacles some sickness here some pain here as the obstacle go don't want to be like that forget yourself gone well and you're sitting about you go I want you to be healed I want your brush man be good help listen God desire is that you have good out was analyze I a second a second a second a second forget that you have to be healed that's what Jesus came for all glory to God to open up the prison bars they set up keep Liberty them that a bog the heal the brokenhearted or glory no God set you Liberty listen when you captive from physical and spiritual conditions let me see them again to bring a deliverance from spiritual and physical condition because I have demons in the physical and demons in the spiritual the physical is sickness or glory to God the spiritual is demonic and the lives of individuals but he promised the free from all attacked physical and spiritual or and who Yuma the son of man set free it's free indeed could begin the law some princes this morning Oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah glory to God hallelujah so before Jesus returned in power to read this scripture he had to overcome by the word the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh and the pride of life I'm talking about dry wood or glory to God because Jesus was led by the spirit into the wilderness to be tested and he told that devil it is written it is written it is also written he never demonstrated power to Lucifer he never demonstrated power to the enemy he overcome by the world there's an overcoming by the world where you take the word and let the devil know where to get off when you take the word and said I'm not going to back down and moved on from what God said because the world itself is God and the word of power and it never don't believe that but the word of power that's right Jesus said destroyed this body and it treated a lot a wizard of myself because he knew what David said he knew David spoke the word I will not suffer my Holy One to see corruption or glory the dog be believer so Jesus after overcoming these three attacks lust of the eyes lust of the flesh and pride of life he was ready to go into the temple and he found the place where it was written and he read the scripture from Isaiah 61 but in the middle of that sentence he stopped he only stopped after the acceptable year of the Lord and he left off the day of vengeance of our God he left off the judgment part because that judgment part is for now that just meant part is for the bride to pick up and God will not hide from the brain what he's about to do free is gone if you have new it Wednesday night service you need to go on YouTube and go in the channel and listen to that service lot and his wife and I trust the Lord but I said could bring back some of that this morning but luck was boss God was about leaving and and he said shall I hide from Abraham what I'm about to do Sodom is already judged hallelujah judgment is coming and and lot had this burden Abram at his building for his family who was done in Sodom and he began to plead with God if there's fifty righteous would you destroy God said no and he's plea and plea until court dispatch angels to get the family out some mocked some make fun out of it but there were a few that came out all glory to God there's somebody to come out before the judgment strike it has to be a voice to say come leave what you're doing and come and just don't look back what opportunity there was two teas on the cross or glory to God two recipes on the cross to Big Time Bandits on the cross one say why you say this haven't seen us also another one say Lord remember me he said the right thing and Jesus said today you will be with me he did another get baptized in Jesus name he didn't have to come to church he didn't have to stay long and I'll fellowship with the Saints jesus said today you will be with me in paradise God made a provision for that man a final hour reprieve final voice of mercy Oh God mercy that was great and Chris was free pardon there was multiplied for me there my burdened soul found Liberty at Calvary or get the Lord a show you talk about the grace of God you talk about the mercies of God you I want to be delivered this morning by the grace and the mercies of God Oh hallelujah glory to God hallelujah praise God he is making a bride hallelujah he is cutting you up now cut you down to his word only gotten all the kree's and dogmas and everything away from you trying to get back a bride for the son another masterpiece part of the word Jesus couldn't take the place you remember when they read that in the day in the book he read just part of the prophecy he left the rest of it for the last day we are supposed to take that part you see he was cut and God wants to cut the church out well he cut the son out like he did the bride and the groom to be his bride you must be part of him not part of the church church and brightness two different things and have Church in her bride to be pastor the bride you'll be part of him do you believe that not part of a Creed not part of denomination but part of him you doubt by the Word of God all glory to God so God want to make you the word itself the Word made flesh the word is invisible until it become flesh in your flesh the word gonna come inside your flesh it will jump up the word all the scribes these has were Scrolls and courts and scriptures but when Jesus came he break the scriptures to life he said the Spirit is upon me that was not a scripture that was being made manifest the Spirit was upon him to fulfill the very scripture itself and that same spirit has to come upon you to manifest revelation telling you 17 and the spirit and the bride say come you were to go to your family and say come or glory to God and it wouldn't have to come because the same voice that called Lazarus from the grave that voice of the Archangel will be my bride and when that voice had come Lazarus couldn't say I'm not coming he had to come he had to come he was dead but he had to come that voice with the same your family that voice is the first of deliverance that voice is the voice of preacher or get the Lord a show or glory to God that boy he's gonna be the bride don't give up don't give up on your family don't even give up on you don't give up yeah you don't even know what I'm here this morning you are slipping right now under prophecy this word this morning it putting you under a direct prophecy that was spoken by a 20th century prophet this is the seer the Lord [Applause] come here see if I could bring it to you this week when I exactly said a virgin shall conceive Mary wasn't coming for 400 days off until a time before it is so that was text until Mary come when Mary came on the scene that is not just text that the reason for long you know that's the prophecy is that happen so when the angel want to connect Mary with that scripture the insula theater Mary's a Hail Mary now a highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed all angels on the scripture because the time has come to anoint this woman to produce Messiah nothing could stop that and have a specific person to fulfill that her name is Mary no other name is we're gonna be fulfilling that but Mary so when the time came the engine of the fine Mary call Miriam said the Lord is with me she don't even know that but you have to tell her the Lord is with me I said I don't my woman Oh glory they're gonna mend God call your God call that tell you that he is with you but he's gonna bless you that he's going to deliver you that's he's gonna free you Oh glory to God you have your pass you have your failures you have your shortcomings but he's not looking at that he's looking at that name in that book Oh glory not unless your name is on that book you shall be delivered [Applause] [Music] [Applause] all glory to God hallelujah are you with me this morning all glory to God so Gordon watch in your flesh and your spirit and inhumanity and Lorien actual thing corner than that he's looking to see what's inside your soul what's inside of your seed why could he say Peter come Andrew come this wasn't just any and anybody he said all that the father had given me shout the father give them to him before they even knew he was given to him he didn't know but he knew like we had to say the woman at a well she didn't know her name was on the book she had lived with one man she had five but Jesus had to meet that woman because he was the book itself even what he knew her name was inside of there because he was the book itself Jesus Loretta fine you Jesus don't let her get you he know what condition you in this morning he know what you need to be delivered from [Applause] when was your name put on another book of life listening we talking about this name when is when I started behave yourself and I started be of nice I might think about that now I know something light it's not so deep but I wanna think about that when was your name put on the last book of life when your backslide when it was fooling around no God put your name in the land of life before the foundation of the world or glory that God when he put it before the foundation of the world and Satan was not there before the foundation of the world so he does not the book he doesn't know your name but God knows your name and he calling you by me which is a manifestation of the word from the book so tonight today you could hear your name and the person next to you they not hearing what God telling you that's you and God that's flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto you but my father had reveal it unto you or give the Lord a shout your husband can't stop you and barring that voice your wife can't stop you hearing that voice not your children

the destroyer and Philistines and Samson was defeated by a woman named Delilah and God put the big Samson a blind for so much of years it look like he did look like a giant it look like all hopes gone

go back to what we once had we once had Genesis 1:28 let us make man in our image in our likeness let that man have dominion over every creeping thing over every spirit Dominion not conquered by spirits but conquering spirits Dominion in power control Allah dominating all glory to God Allah - oh we had that that's belong to sons that's what we had when we say once more we talking about going right back to Genesis when born are the original intent for man to be Intuit power and Jesus brought it back in acts 1:8 he said you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost comes upon you and you

take this is the service this is the term look at the Lord a shout the boy is free the mess where shout can be choice you know let me see it when Samson see one small or one small or all the angels of heaven come down upon him with a mountain of strength and power when substance a touch around everything's there he swim or eat them Philistines at his depth then in his life he killed them out why because a son please position on a position of power that he could fulfill the purpose of God destroy the enemy you're pure reason to destroy the enemies so yeah said all them demons are wrong in life

life let's just live not survive live caught away and survive and live live the abundant life live [Applause] [Music] this is it hallelujah so when man fell blood of bulls and goats was accepted as a substitute but then God is waiting for the lamb to come because only one blood was not truly accepted which is the blood of Jesus Christ which is the blood of God was enough blood of a man was not Jewish blood is real like blood was the blood of God that's why you're foolish enough to conceive so what God put egg and sperm to produce the body called Jesus so when he died was the blood of God and the blood released the spirit life but that blood was the answer the same question because the devil could hold us captive as long as we covered with sin but the blood was the answer the same question because it has to be dealt with say not to be judged and the penalty of sin was death so death was required anybody to compare kinsman-redeemer have to pay the price of debt and give me a kiss my redeemer you have to be willing you have to be rich you have to be connected with man so jesus met the qualification to be the kinsman redeemer he was willing he was rich he was connected to us as a man because no angel could redeem us a man had to redeem us a what every man a worthy kinsman so when he stepped forward to take the book when he stepped forward the die on the cross was the answer the same question once and for all or give the Lord a show you may be seated this same question was answered 24/7 illa it was not temporary and Sayla this was an answer to sin 24/7 I die for them see it and say they did this he did this she did this but I died with my blood is almond like if you pay in advance so it have a cost look at here blood blood blood blood seven ages seven cups of blood and mercy seats Oh Gloria v8 the blood speaking on behalf Oh God we are only here this morning because of blood not because we put because of blood not because we tried to do better but because of blood there is none righteous none none none no not one no Pope righteous no pastor I just know this man righteous is one righteous that is Jesus Christ and when his blood apply to your heart to your mind to your spirit and your spirit hallelujah we see the spirit then you are covered by the blood and you God doesn't see you he sees the blood he doesn't hear your voice you see the voice of the blood speaking on your behalf he sees you perfect he sees you healed he see you delivered he see you free he see you can't hallelujah the chains are wrong you're being busted and broke [Music]

inheritance that inherited become Anakin's my redeemer he freely give it out to us it belonged to him he is the one who redeemed but instead of keeping it for himself he gives it back to it the people that's just love for us he took the book isn't that right he took the book and what happened he came down and give it to the Prophet and any Indians they go and take the book and eat the book a book that he couldn't look upon a book that he couldn't touch no you could eat the book that book belongs to us it's the book of God it's the book of prophecy so we could receive that book and take that book and prophesy your deliverance this morning and the court is here to enforce that would have prophecy over your life a complete even what the doctors give up on you Oh glory to God don't you give

where we don't have to fuss and strain and pull like this so they of Jubilee no fussing no straining no pulling you're walking and your worship then you walk in your atmosphere you're walking and the heaviness around you because heaven consists of the word and the word is in you where is our unhappiness around you they walk into your house and demons scattering before you reach the door you're visiting your family and as you open the door so demon status Kempe because an anointing son a jubilee son redeemer son you're coming to redeem your fallen family oh you're coming like a mini Jesus like a small Messiah but a round ball of the Messiah at I'm anyone a small version of the one the big one when you walk in the Spirit of God is upon me for he has anointed me your family sit in bed but you know you're coming to pray for them you're noting all over you the anointing upon your hands the feet inside your heart or chlorine are when their lands upon them so you know it's more than the SEC pineal universe all will be delivered or give the Lord some praise as people hallelujah when you see this begin to hear you have Jubilee where you don't have to fuss and strain and pull like this but we already secured in Christ Seton can't hold you amen this'll depth our Gentile workers because God is releasing his spirit by His grace Gideon wants some reason come here I want to switch but I wanna share something with you but listen this Barham Roberto deliverance he said I heard but I never learned I'm just warning back there can I come to my mind the people I see really gettin away from deliverance it seems to be something that the people seem so they push it to the other side where God can't do it but that's not the attitude Moses when he was called by God he was total complete prophet when God sends a man to do anything he completely equip him and puts what he has needed of if go across want to be a preacher he puts in something to preach and that's what he's done he sent Moses to Egypt and equipped him just like you if you're Christian go don't make half a Christians God make complete Christians go to make half were preachers but we just can't be half free and Gordon makes his children Christian but sometime they're half a Christians it's not quads intention for them to be that way is there always that got mixed up with the plan of God for their life and that's what makes them that we go to make off we're preachers or halfway Christians but he said more they was completely surrendered into the hands of God and that's the reason God could completely trust him I wonder this morning as Christians if we have either our own will here ourselves so completely to God to go can trust us to a place that put us I won this morning myself if I could be solely with the God till God could trust me could trust but I never could trust the trustee board Deacon board the minister has got a place the duty to preach the gospel and a member of the church if he's got to be a member of this certain group he should not compromise if the Church believes that we should not gamble that member should never touch a deck of cards if we believe in drinking he should turn his head completely from drinking if we believe not believin Gamlen or smokin not supposed to be in that at all and if we've completely deliver ourselves into his hand then one can live in us Christ hope of glory he can reflect himself from us and we get ourselves out of the way then our tours of his thoughts could imagine Christ smoking a cigar could you imagine Christ painted cards if then if your spirit is part of his spirit he wants it to be upon your confession and you permit the devil come in and take over if our hearts condemn us we want complete deliverance we don't want a halfway Church we want to be a real Church on nutrition at all we want to be real Christians or no questions at all we want to deliver on some of our habits from our sins for more evil thinking for more evil doing from our negligence whatever we have done we want a torta deliverance so when people come into this church to be prayed for there'll be little group this little group maybe not over 100 or to sit in here they'll be completely in the hands of God and when when you're unified praise God in our hearts together with brotherly love or bear the office of the church and the pastor the pastor obey God then go and work to the pastor to the board go into the church and we all together one unit for the kingdom of God and Pharaoh Pharaoh Moses you can go but leave your children behind that's the way the devil wants a Christian to come he'll be all right for you to join a church but don't ever forgive Jones maybe all right you don't have to give up your smoking or drinking online or stealin your fault fine and backbiting you rather given up just join the church but Moses wasn't compromise' he wanted a complete deliverance he said we will not leave one hoof behind we will take everything that belongs to us then we go to worship God we will take righteousness we will take holiness we will take purity where it took all what God required that's when one night when God ordained that lamb shall be killed type of Christ and the blood was dipped and he said when I see the blood you had to put it doorpost on the doorpost you have to put the blood on a place where it might be displayed you cannot be a private believer you cannot be a private Christian Christians is a public thing it has to have the blood displayed upon your chest upon your heart upon your life and when the church shall be completely delivered when everything is brought under the blood when your sins come under the blood when you're smoking you're gambling you're cheatin when you're stealing your line when everything is brought under the blood there'll be a total of runs if you are wrong somebody make it right you can't bring that under the blood it won't steer you can bring it something won't let you do it when yourself is completely totally brought on the blood there'll be a total deliverance and you'll have a freedom here we go you'll have a freedom like you have never known before when everything is brought under the blood brought in submissive to the kingdom of God there'll be a real deliverance and then he was saying pray in the air God you don't think you don't take things unless it's to to delivered you cannot receive a sacrifice a blemish on it you will never receive a prayer with sin back in the life of that person you could not do it Lord you didn't do it in the ages gone by you can't do it but the sacrifice must be without blemish oh my hallelujah we believe that praise God praise God want you to prosper I'm being good held he said don't stop for nothing you've got the message Jesus lives God is a healer that's the message what was it the word that he walked with was within him wheeling him up there is flesh and in his soul yet a little while it will seize me no more but you shall see me their spirit quickness the world in other words he is the powder that sends the bullets out there oh my oh praise be to Jesus don't stop for nothing no reason and nothing else God is trained in this great battle Matthew 24 said here be something something oh praise God there will be a time of trouble such as never was before are we living in that time when culture and

was about to press the gas pedal a few seconds after that I saw a little girl run from behind my vehicle she had bolted from her father who was in as much shock as I was I know that it was the Lord the angel of the Lord in action as cordwood has promised us praise God he is real and so are his promises amen and we have some prayer requests good morning sings Lenoir Hodge an ex-coworker - requesting prayer for deliverance of a son who is struggling with depression and all the other issues that go with it also for Denise Phillip a friend who is you know a bed of affliction she has had two heart surgeries that led to other complications and constant infections but doctors in the USA where she lives wanted to do a fitted surgery she has refused because she believes that God can heal

brother Alexis for a young man who was about 10 years old he is blind he met him at a supermarket and he feels a strong compassion and a bit and he's acting the Lord will heal him and make him completely whole and if there's any other request I know we have the prayer line but but if Adam said we could sing too much we could dance too much but we could never pray too much if you want to show a raise of hands as we approach the throne of grace one more time Heavenly Father Lord the woman has already gone forth praises have already gone up Lord me see you time and time again in Lord

I raised my hand also this morning in your house Lord we our Lord needing a touch from you love me you heal each one from the crown of their head to the soles of their feet father Lord and me as the word continues to go forth Lord even before the prayer line me testimonies begin a break for with a people catching a feed from the word lauter catch the vision Lord that it's already done it's already finished you are Lord who started the work Lord is able to complete it and you died on the cross and you already paid the price you don't have to pay it again it's already paid for father God may you touch your people touch me and me you bless the world and a reading of it on the opening of our understand into your scriptures Lord for the next few moments in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says Amen an email just want to read one portion of scripture before we get ready for the prayer line scene Luke 17 and verse 26 this scripture and this subject has been burning in my heart for a few weeks now I can't shake it so I know there's something in there for us this morning see in Luke 17 and verse 26 and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that Noah and into the Ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus in other words so shall it be shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed in that day he which shall be upon the housetop and his stuff in the house let him not come down to take it away and he that is in the field let him likewise not return back remember Lot's wife me the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated in the presence of the Lord this morning and I feel like we are in a hospital room this morning I don't know how recently my wife had to visit a doctor and she went early 5:30 6:00 in the morning around 8 o'clock I checked in she said she's still waiting nine o'clock checked in she's still waiting 9:30 is checked in she's still waiting because when you go by the doctor you can tell the doctor right now right now the doctor some time comes when he's ready to come he knows the different matters he has to deal with and when we come into the house of the Lord it's a hospital room Jesus when he was a said he that are well have no need of a physician but he came as the great physician so he is in the building this morning to deal with different situations a deal with different conditions and he is a deliverer but for the deliverer to operate he has to be activated because God is very clear in his laws with jurisdiction he is God of heaven and he gave Dominion to man on the earth so when we pray what we actually do is open the door to allow God to move it's reason God has to find somebody to operate true because if it was not that principle he would operate without humans and then we would understand God in that context so that's why he would use prophets and he become his mouthpiece because when God came down and spoke is they let Moses speak because when you speak we can deal with it so God always uses and he always uses prayers access into this realm and into this jurisdiction you believe that this morning so we are here this morning for a special deliverance service because man needs to be delivered and that deliverance and the need for deliverance needs back to Genesis when man fell from his condition he fell from his position he fell from where God left him and when God asks a question Adam where doubt he was not asking for his physical location he was asking about his spiritual condition God knows exactly where you are physically he knows that but his question animals where are you because I left you in a certain position as a believer I left you in a position of authority but you are no longer there what happened what went wrong and it was that Adam had disobeyed an instruction that God gave to him and that disobedience as whether Branham said drinking smoking fornication adultery carousing pornography whatever it is that's not sin that is the attributes or the behaviors that come out of sin sinners unbelief and if you really believe God it'll make you behave a certain way if you really be leave God it'll make you act a certain way if you really believe God it'll make you do things that are contrary to your training if you believe God it'll make you do things that are contrary to me what your parents said to you if you believe God it'll make you go against what your teacher told you because when you hear from God God speaks in a way to us that doesn't make sense all the time and it's not supposed to make sense because the Bible said my thoughts are higher and your thoughts the fact that his thoughts are higher than our thoughts means it doesn't have to make sense to us all the time but he promised to reveal certain things to us and those things which I reveal they can now belong to us because it's within our comprehension outside of that we have to trust God for the journey that he takes us true to bring us to perfection the journey that he takes us true to bring us to a realization so the trials and the ups and the downs and word of it is speaking about you may have been smoking drinking whatever it was in the past the journeys that we have gone through to be here this morning there is no accident in it there is no mistake in it because god I see this all the time it's either quarters in control or he's not in control he can't be in the middle somewhere it is either quarters in the controller Gordon's nothing control if God is in control it means he's in control of where you are today he's in control of the job you have he's in control of the house you live in him whether you like you know you don't like it you have to accept the fact that he's in control if he's nothing controlling that's a whole different story but I believe he's in control because he is omnipotent he is omniscient he is all-powerful there's nothing he cannot do this nothing he cannot fix he could move governments he did it when Jesus had to be born he could produce money he put calling the fish on when the fish they founded there is no situation that he's not capable of able to and has the ability to change the twist to turn so we have no excuse this morning but to give God worship and to give God praise and to give Him fans in the midst of the trial that he and his wisdom carefully sat down enough for us for our benefit our trials of our benefit our problems of our benefit our failures of our benefit because he promised to work it out can the church seaman but the pranam said missing limbs will be restored can I have a volunteer this morning to have your limb removed so we can restore it nobody wants to volunteer to be blind what blind eyes have to be open them nobody wants to volunteer to be deaf but the death is up to here so Gordon is wisdom allowed things to happen to you I love things that happen to your family and like jover you could stand there and see to the skin worm destroy my body yet in my flesh I will see God nothing could happen to you nothing could happen to your family unless God allows it to happen and if you're loaded to happen it's a greater purpose behind this and we have to accept that and that gives us a reason of thank God that in the midst of the Lord gives the Lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord can the church semen hallelujah hallelujah so ever thought this morning for a few minutes you already have the message but I have to get this out I'm pregnant with this this morning don't look back don't look back that's the title this morning don't look back if you came here this morning don't look back if you want to walk with God don't look back we sing the song when we get baptized I have decided to follow Jesus no turning back no turning back so I want to remind the church this morning about don't look back don't look back to you always don't look back to your old friends don't look back to where God took you from even pizza before he got the Holy Ghost when Jesus died he looked back not only did he look back he went right back to his former employment that Jesus pulled him from God didn't pull him from fishing for him to go back fishing but when he lost something he went back to where he was before and for somebody to be back slidden it means they are not where they will pull the - they went back to where they were before because if God pulled you out of something and you stay out of that something then you cannot be black Satan but the reason we have deliverance services is because somebody steps back from where God please them and their different reasons why we step back the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh the pride of life the cares of life our jobs our families conflicts marital problems financial problems all of these things are designed and they come at us and we have a choice to make every day we have a choice - I stand my ground do I go back do I go forward and for anybody who found themselves stepping back it's because you decided nobody forced you to do it you decided to not breathe you decided to not come to church you decided to talk to your friend before talking to God what's riding is not an immediate opening it is a process it is a slow process it's a slow process of losing your joy it's a slow process of losing your feet it's a slow process but tangled and restoration does not to be a slow process thank Lord that when Jesus was at that wedding and they ran out of wine he said bring some water and by the pranam shed that Jesus bypassed the picking of the grapes Jesus bypass the fermenting of the grapes Jesus bypass all of that and in as they were pouring he said how they keep this wine for last the best wine Jesus not just turn the water into wine he is the one because the quality of wine is aged so it means that God my past time to restore what they needed so I don't care how long you've been back sit in this morning God to restore your family he can restore your house he can restore your health he can restore your children I'm not just clutter he wants to he wants to restore your children he wants to restore your joy not just once - he will restore your children he will restore not just will he must restore he a stirry straw is obligated to restore he can't help himself his heart is beating fastest morning because somebody is crying out to him it doesn't mean that have to be your voice you may be seated for a few minutes there's a cry from within that you can't even put into words the ceiling ups cries out the seed in your soul cries out because the word is the believer you are not even a believer but the word and you is crying out for something you try to drown the cry with alcohol you try to drown the prior with your world problems but that cry is still here and he is able to small him to answer the cry he's evil this morning to break the chains that I've held you have held you all these years some people in church and chained up people out to church and chained up but this morning don't look back the Egyptians you see today you will see them no more forever today's a new day it's a new season it's a new our God Himself has come down you may be seated can I talk to you a little bit it's interesting that out of every age that God compared the M - he didn't compare to the age of Moses or the golden age of David or the great prophetic age of Elijah you see as it was in the days of Noah as it was and it is of lot those are the ages those are the eras the times the dispensations the epochs that he compares our day to and he brought the similarities and he sat on a church they builded they planted they married they had wives and he brought the similarities of what it was which was normal living people want to get married they want to build a house they want to go to work they want to have a job they want to get a nice car they want to survive they want to be see if these are natural things and Jesus is painting the picture that the issue for many people is not even the spiritual because the natural does impact the spirit the cares of this life is what leads to the decay in the spiritual realm and that is why we have to remember Lot's wife and I said on Wednesday night you can't talk about Lot's wife we don't know her name we don't know how old she was dude we don't know at all how we don't know her identification is luck Lot's wife that's how she's known to us that's all we know about her in terms of describing her but we know her behavior we know what happened to her and when we go back to Genesis we can talk about Lot's wife unless we talk about a lot and lot is of no mention if it's not forever ahem because it's because of Abraham we know a lot if God didn't call the ever ahamill we had children of Abraham and we know these things they've gotta call Abraham who islets but the Bible tells us Abraham had two brothers and one of his brothers died and that was Lots father and for some reason I don't know what it was an attracted lot to Abraham but when God spoke to Abraham lot say I'm coming with you something in luck was attracted to something in Abraham that attraction had to be real because Abraham didn't even know where he was going so it had to be something about Abraham's approach something about Abraham's attitude that attracted a lot to follow him in the first place Abraham the Bible said was seeking a city whose builder and maker was God he wasn't looking for a big bank account or a platinum Visa credit card or a nice house he was looking for a builder a city made by God he was not about the natural things he was not about natural wealth he wasn't about natural ambition are you with me this morning don't look back I'm not taking too long with you but I want you to get this because many of us we find ourselves caught in this position lot is under Abraham's leadership he's the part of Abraham's house his family worships at Abraham's altar and the Bible said that it was conflict there was strife between the houses now I want to draw clearly to the church this morning the issue was not spiritual it was not doctrine it was not Koontz it was not Scripture it was the natural things you park your car here I does normally Park here is the Bible said they didn't have enough room so the natural things I mean I want to expand my house but this person too close to me so I should explain and he tell me I might fence bigger and natural things so I want to make the point that it was a natural problem a material problem a business problem that led to the conflict it was not that luck did not believe it was not that Lot's wife did not believe it was to create peace within the family that Abraham as the senior said to the junior you choose for the sake of peace we are too good for us to have our people fighting like this it was a natural situation and many times in our homes and our families we have natural arguments there are people who come to church upset not because of a spiritual issue in the house but an argument in the house is anybody in the house this morning an argument between husband and wife son and daughter oh you don't want me to come to your house this morning huh husband and wife and house and neighbor you on your way to church of his argument with a neighbor argument over who did breakfast and who washes the dishes natural problems and it rules the spiritual perspective out of line and under the pressure of the natural problem lot I want you to pitch your luck now he has to make a decision Abraham is not choosing for him Abraham is not making a recommendation to him lot has to choose for himself and every one of us in this room this morning we have to choose for ourselves because that's how God organized it that you have a choice to worship or not to worship you have a choice to pray or not to pray you have a choice to believe or not to believe you ever tries to accept or not accept you have a choice to come to church or not come to church you ever tries to pay a tithe or not they attack you ever tries to pray or not to pray you have a choice a cheat on your wife or not to cheat on your wife that's a choice you have a choice to save or not to see where you can spend your money stupid that's a choice life is about choices we're gonna have a prayer line today and you have a choice how you approach the prayer line if you are here today because you're looking for a blessing or you want to choose life and choose eternity and choose Redemption and choose not going back from where you came and choose real deliverance because repentance is not just saying I'm sorry it's a change of behavior are there any Bible believers in the house is Smalling I'm not gonna be too long with you but we're waiting on a doctor right now I'm operating as a nurse right now because the great physician is here to operate I'm checking the blood pressure checking your BMI I'm doin a urine sample this morning checking your blood sugar level before the doctor that operate making sure that the test results are in that your heart is right that your heart is open up so that he can operate without without reservation that your toys open because he said I stand at the door knock and if any man open up I'm gonna come in and sup with him you may be seated I saw something yesterday until people want to be delivered you will anoint him with oil and have greasy demons I see it one more time until people want it to be delivered you can anoint him with oil as much as you want he'll have greasy demons the man who was beating up preachers when he came into the house we're better Branham was and the minister's left the platform and he challenged the Prophet the Prophet as a short man stood right there when all the other ministers ran for their lives when that man came up to the Prophet the Prophet said you wanna fall over my feet because you have challenged the Lord he didn't challenge God even challenged the Prophet challenge God because I was God's man when the police came because the police the law got involved see Willis mommy already said no because you worship the spirit that's upon him he wants to be that way he wants to be that way you have to want to be delivered I am tired of having services you talk to people the Branham said he it hurt him when he preached certain things and he the same over and over and over again and the people didn't respond it wears down on the preacher it's the same frustration a teacher would have in a school you stand in front of a classroom and you teach and you tell them you have to mix something about yourself and these panelists and the good teachers they do it and it hurts them when they see children potential wasted where's their potential so there is Abraham he's waiting for a lot to tell him where he wants to go and the Bible said that a lot made a decision he did not decide to backslide he didn't decide to leave the church he didn't side to take his family out of church lot made a decision believing that it would work out lot made a decision believing that his family would maintain the values that they were raised up under lot made a decision at that time that he thought was the best decision he could make he made a decision not to go into Sodom but to move close to Sodom the Bible said he pitched his tent towards he leaned in the direction and I shared on Wednesday and I shared in another place I said listen what you may be able to handle speaking to the fathers in the house your family may not be able to handle because lot was able to survive this whole story as we know about but he lost children in the process he lost his wife in the process so we are decisions prayerfully before doing anything can the church say Amen so lot the Bible says and black sliding I can imagine missus lot gets close to Sodom that's a look at the clothes look at the styles look at the fashion not is a man of prestige he thought he made a good decision for his family because by moving close to Sodom he had more customers he moved to the city I'm preaching it because they builded they planted they married a lot of people say lot had two daughters read the Bible he had more than two daughters because he had daughters who were married and he was sons-in-laws in Scripture to left with him but he lost daughters so he had daughters who married lot would have builded he was a businessman he was a wealthy man because it was wealth that created a problem Abraham's prosperity and lots prosperity grew to the point that it could not coexist the Bible said what was found at the gate of Sodom the gate of Sodom is the commercial center of the city so he was at the business center when these two angels came and he bowed down to them I said on Wednesday night that God was finishing up with Abraham and the Bible said the endless will of work getting up and walking and the Bible said Abram was leading them along the way when God said to Abram it was almost in passing that he since that's a conversation he had went so well and I told him what are you children according to Tamara life let me just share something with you Adam why are we walking why are we walking I'm about to go I've heard a cry in Sodom and I want to investigate to see if this thing is as bad as I'm hearing because it was as bad as I'm hearing judgment is coming and I can imagine the level that Abraham had to have to almost all go at hand if it were and say hol up hol up hol up hol up it can't be your way for you to just judge everybody like that that's not how you do things I'm paraphrasing that's not what you operate you are fear judge in Debbie 50 would you not spare them I'm going to say okay and the Bible said Abraham started to plead he said I am but dust I am nobody I have nothing forgive me if I push it myself but if it's five less than fifty what he destroyed and we know this we understand this and Abraham pleaded down to ten and two angels went into Sodom for one reason and one reason only deliverance this is a deliverance service one reason and one reason only deliverance because with deliverance is always judgment but as pertains the believers is deliverance judgment is to the world so with deliverance judgment and the Angels get there me know the story lot brings them in the men of the city tried to get them locked offers his two daughters who had not known men virgins to the men and listen we don't want them we won the men that came into the house when Locke said no you can't have them the men of the city say who lot think he is you are outsider trying to fit in here does empower phrasing how you become a judge over our lifestyle read a Bible and at that point the Bible says that the Angels pulled lot didn't blinded the men and the Bible said it was only exhaustion that stopped those men in their blinded conditions trying to find the door because it was spirits upon them spirits upon them are we dealing with spiritual warfare Lot's wife would have been seeing all of this interaction so she knows how the people live now many times we look at lot as a compromiser and in part we could say yes he ended up in sort of but I want to read one scripture for you to see how Peter justified lot in second Peter 2 and verse 4 second Peter 2 verse 4 for if God spared not the Angels that sinned but cast them down to hell and delivered them into chains of Darkness to be reserved unto judgement and spared not the old world but saved Noah the eighth person a preacher of righteousness bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes condemned them with an overthrow making them an example listen what's around and more is an example unto those that after should live ungodly so for all times Sodom and Gomorrah is a memorial to those that would live ungodly against gods we as a reminder to you of the consequence and delivered the Bible goes on just lot so Peter justified lot just lot vexed listened a lot vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked now there are people here this morning who say they want to be delivered are you vexed with the conversation of the wicked or you all up in the conversation that's the conversation of the wicked bother you or it has have you accepted it and you tolerate it and people know that they could talk that way around you because you never fight it it never vex you have you been vexed because lot was in a messed up condition but the Bible says he was still vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked anybody with me have you become intolerant have you lowered your guard so much that you just allow any kind of conversation around you you know that but the Branham said there are certain things he said he didn't let certain people into his car because he said one time a man came in the can spoke a blue streak what he said had a color read a message words have power so a lot in his condition although he was in a backslidden condition as it were found himself in Sodom he was tell vexed with the conversation where his behavior we reached conduct and attitude and the homosexuality and that's not we reach that part yet just a conversation it's an embarrassment when Christians are involved in foolish conversation because life and death is in the power of the tongue and your lips your mouth is reserved for spoken would spoken would that's why you are temples of the Holy Ghost for the spoken would God to use you as a vessel let's go further for that righteous man so Peter called a righteous man you call him something else because the Angels went into Sodom to get the righteous so it was lots righteousness that covered his family it was lots righteousness that made a way for his family to even hear the message but come on and you young people who want to be disrespectful to your parents it is their righteousness they may have false but God sees them as righteousness because he sees to the blood how do you disrespect your parents yes not had his problems but there's blood for problems come on somebody helped me this morning yes luck messed up but there's blood for messing up oh come on somebody come on somebody anybody in the house this morning [Applause] so we dealt with I want to read it carefully because I know many who have not read the scripture and delivered just lot so pizza in his ministry had to come in the New Testament to justify the perception of lot just like we didn't know until Peter made it clear because if you read Genesis alone you would see lot as this backslider and if it wasn't for Abraham lot had no chance but Peter brings another perspective yes luck messed up yes Abraham pleaded for him but we didn't know about the sighing and crying that was going through the travail of a father the travail of a husband the travail of maybe a grandfather we don't know but a lot was there he wasn't captive but he wasn't reveal he wasn't trouble but he wasn't surveil of spirit travail of soul he knew he was not where he was supposed to be he did not the strength to deliver himself you need to deliver us but it was a travail in his spirit he was crying out for something anybody in the house this morning I want to read a scripture carefully and delivered just lot vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked so there are two things I want you to understand that because we had put a mark upon those who sigh and cry for the abomination in the city but what does that really mean this is it here he is vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked sighing and crying is Britain bothered by it and the Bible goes on for that righteous man dwelling among them in seeing and hearing now we come into actions not just words in seeing and hearing vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds now we dealing with the behavior so lot is there at the gate of Sodom and he's dying within himself he's dying watching his wife hear from him because she is no different from when they came to this house her behavior has changed his children who he had an expectation of the Bible said that they went and threw worldly men and married them and that's the Bible can we go on so the angels and they were allowed to say a lot is there anybody else that you care about our access money is anybody else that you care about who should be delivered because we came to let you know that we have come to judge this whole city is gonna be destroyed so I advise you get your whole family get them in to hear this message the aims are specific you have son-in-law you have any other daughters he goes down in Genesis 19 and the Bible says but two verses or so later lot goes to his sons-in-law and Arab said the sons in law mocked him and the Bible said that lot lingered let me read it I'm almost done don't look back friends I find in Genesis three kinds of believers lot sons-in-law were clearly unbelievers did not believe they mocked him let me get it and lot went out and speak unto his sons-in-law which married his daughters plural and said up get you out of this place for the Lord will destroy this city but he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in laws didn't accept it and when the morning arose at the angels he stood not saying arise take thy wife and my two daughters which I hear we don't know where the other daughters are but these are here lest they be consumed in the iniquity of the city and I could imagine Lots device and while he lingered you know what it is as a parent to stand there and you don't know what going on with the other daughters his sons-in-law you know your wife and a condition and these two daughters who have stayed with you the Bible said they have not known any man they are the ones who at least tried to behave so a lot is lingering we don't know why he's lingering but maybe he linger because he's hoping the other daughters come to their senses maybe he's hoping his sons and laws decide at least let me take a risk and go out what could go wrong if he write us alive if he wrong I come back but these were young men was so delusional that didn't even take the calculated risk I want you to think about it friends I don't think you've ever heard this presented like this why are you lingered the angels not a falsity action the Bible says the men laid hold upon his hand and upon the hand of his wife and upon the hand of his two daughters in other words angels are now physically removing them they are no longer depending on words to move them but a pop well they are physically extracting them they are kidnapping them they are arresting them physically taking them out because the words were not enough luck was still lingering the inner to physically take them out I want you to understand now two dimensions of this one is God is serious about deliverance so serious about deliverance that he will not just use word alone to get you he has to use force if necessary to get you he is so serious about deliverance and his promise to deliver he made a promise to Abraham to get his family and God cannot break his promise so God had to have you angels let me I just had the earpieces or they say all the Deacons are earpieces pull them out extract them know and move them out now no more waiting time is gone no time left take them out put them unconscious if you have to but get them out knock them out if you have to but take them out break the foot if you have to but get them out because judgment is coming but there's a promise over them yet time I died with the rest they must be delivered God will do whatever it takes to break you out of even break you out of sin to break you out of the world you better believe it [Applause] can eat a little more almost then sue me feelings just skipped you wither and while he lingered the men lead hall upon his hand and upon the hand of his wife and upon the hand of his two daughters the Lord being merciful unto him so this force this kidnapping this extraction was mercy it's like a father pulling a child roughly from a fire because a child don't know what gonna happen and the child cried because you call Emily and they feel bad about being pulled but that's mercy when the word comes to you in a way that makes you feel uncomfortable because you're not living right that's mercy because it's a judgement sheet and it's just blood on the judgment seat that makes it a mercy seat the Lord being merciful unto Him and they brought him for and set him without the city or outside the city and it came to pass when they had brought them forth abroad that is an escape for thy life No that to me is self-explanatory if somebody says you better Joe run for your life that way what would you do escape for your life look not behind me in other words don't look back need us Theodore when all the plane and I were doing around here there's nothing more for you here let's go be consumed and I'll stop reading there I work too brainy so close musicians made ready they are challenged to move quickly but the Branham and doing prayer lines and in doing ministry he would say the angel is here receive him quickly stand up right away because if you don't respond right away he said he will move on respond quickly Lot's wife would have grown up on the Abraham would have had to decline while she wasn't Sodom with no doubt had known that these are angels that would have come would have seen a manifestation the blinded eyes would have heard a lot repeat the message would have been told by the Angels escaped don't look back they start to move out it's only when they were all judgment strike so when judgment struck they were already out there was something to go back to because judgment was already striking deeper than that in that custom lot would have been in front leading his family out friends I don't know when a lot found out what happened his wife because he couldn't look back so he is walking running moving trying to get to safety and some along the journey his wife has turned to salt but he's still going maybe he was talking to them saying how he got any back they hurry back then after a while he gets no response this is real friends this is not Church why is your there he can't stop moving because he's a believer because
