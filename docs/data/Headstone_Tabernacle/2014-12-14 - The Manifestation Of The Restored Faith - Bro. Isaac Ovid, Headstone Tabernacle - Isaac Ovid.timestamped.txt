[19:24] can we stand to our feet thank you
[19:25] musicians and as we go to three portions
[19:28] of scripture
[19:30] we're going to read from the book of
[19:31] hebrews chapter 11.
[19:33] we're going to read from ephesians 4 and
[19:36] we're going to read from the book of
[19:37] jude
[19:38] there's just one chapter there so we're
[19:40] going to read jude 3.
[19:57] amen
[19:58] so we're going to read hebrews 11 and
[20:00] reading verse 1.
[20:03] now faith is a substance of things hoped
[20:06] for
[20:07] the evidence of things not seen
[20:09] for by it the elders obtained a good
[20:12] report
[20:13] through faith we understand that the
[20:15] worlds were framed by the word of god so
[20:18] that things which are seen were not made
[20:20] of things which do appear
[20:22] by faith abel offered unto god a more
[20:25] excellent sacrifice than cain
[20:27] by which he obtained witness that he was
[20:29] righteous
[20:30] god testifying of his gifts and by it he
[20:34] being dead yet speaketh
[20:36] my lord by faith enoch was translated
[20:39] that he should not see death and was not
[20:41] found because god had translated him for
[20:44] before his translation he had this
[20:46] testimony that he pleased god
[20:49] but without faith it is impossible to
[20:51] please him
[20:52] for he that cometh to god must believe
[20:54] that he is and that he is a rewarder of
[20:57] them that diligently seek him
[20:59] shall we go to ephesians 4 and reading
[21:02] from verse 4
[21:05] ephesians 4 and verse 4.
[21:09] there is one body and one spirit even as
[21:13] he are called in one hope of your
[21:15] calling one lord
[21:17] one faith
[21:18] one baptism
[21:20] one god and father of all who is above
[21:22] all and through all and in you all and
[21:26] reading from the book of jude
[21:28] reading verse
[21:29] 3
[21:36] jude reading verse 3
[21:39] beloved when i gave all diligence to
[21:42] write unto you of the common salvation
[21:45] it was needful for me to write unto you
[21:48] and exhort you that he should earnestly
[21:51] contend for the faith which was once
[21:53] delivered unto the saints
[21:55] for there are certain men crept in
[21:58] unawares
[21:59] who were before of all ordained to this
[22:01] condemnation ungodly men turning the
[22:04] grace of our god into lasciviousness and
[22:07] denying the only lord god and our lord
[22:10] jesus christ may the lord have a
[22:12] blessing to the reading of his word
[22:14] shall we bow our heads for a word of
[22:16] prayer gracious heavenly father we have
[22:18] read lord from your holy text this
[22:20] morning and i pray that the holy spirit
[22:22] will take me out of the way father lord
[22:24] god you gave me a message for your
[22:26] church this morning and i pray there god
[22:28] that you will walk out the pages of the
[22:30] bible and speak to them speak to every
[22:33] life lord they are backsliders in here
[22:34] today may you restore them they are
[22:36] unsaved here this morning may you save
[22:39] them they are those looking for the
[22:40] baptism of the holy ghost on fire may
[22:43] you fill them god almighty lord may you
[22:45] bless the word may you anoint the people
[22:48] may you anoint me we know the word is
[22:50] already anointed father and god for how
[22:53] many minutes we stand here this morning
[22:55] father may you get glory and honor to
[22:57] your precious name in the wonderful name
[22:59] of jesus christ and the church says
[23:02] and the church says
[23:03] amen well you may be seated this morning
[23:06] everybody feeling fine
[23:08] so for my title this morning the
[23:11] manifestation of the restored faith
[23:14] the manifestation of the restored faith
[23:18] and my subject one lord
[23:20] one faith one baptism
[23:22] and my inspiration earnestly contending
[23:25] for the faith restored by malachi 4.
[23:28] can the church say amen
[23:30] earnestly contending for the faith
[23:33] restored by malachi
[23:35] hallelujah
[23:37] and we read in the book of hebrews that
[23:39] faith is the substance of things hoped
[23:41] for
[23:42] it's the evidence of things not seen
[23:45] and we understand that through faith
[23:47] what we see were made of things that
[23:49] don't appear
[23:51] hallelujah that itself is a paradox
[23:54] there a lot of christians who don't even
[23:55] understand that but if you go back all
[23:58] the way in the beginning adam walked by
[24:00] faith
[24:01] adam lived by faith when adam spoke it
[24:04] had to come to pass because he was
[24:06] operating just like his father
[24:08] adam didn't know the word doubt he
[24:10] didn't know the word unbelief he didn't
[24:12] know the word fear all adam knew was
[24:14] faith when adam said mountain moved the
[24:17] mountain had to move
[24:19] hallelujah somebody say man adam didn't
[24:22] know what it was to doubt he didn't know
[24:24] what it was to fear he didn't have any
[24:26] unbelief adam had that original fate
[24:29] that what you say has got to come to
[24:32] pass
[24:33] hallelujah and before we leave this
[24:35] place there will be a manifestation of
[24:38] the restored faith
[24:40] once more the world will hear direct
[24:42] from god
[24:44] oh
[24:45] hallelujah give god glory this morning
[24:49] hallelujah
[24:50] hallelujah and hebrews 11 is such a
[24:53] powerful scripture i had a revival just
[24:56] reading hebrews 11 because it goes
[24:58] through all the heroes of faith and as i
[25:00] read it i was looking for my name
[25:04] oh somebody help me this morning because
[25:06] hebrews 11 says by faith abel by faith
[25:10] enoch by faith noah by faith abraham by
[25:13] faith jacob by faith and i was looking
[25:16] and say where's my name i see by faith
[25:18] isaac
[25:20] by faith joseph by faith moses
[25:25] oh
[25:26] hallelujah and if this writer could have
[25:28] kept writing he was going to say by
[25:30] faith for the jerome by faith with the
[25:32] stephen it is impossible to please god
[25:36] without faith
[25:41] hallelujah
[25:42] hallelujah you may be seated in hebrews
[25:45] 11 hebrews 11 verse 32 and here it is
[25:49] what shall i see or what shall i more
[25:51] see for the time would fail me in other
[25:53] words it's almost like this letter he
[25:55] was on a time limit to write this letter
[25:57] and he was running out of time he
[25:59] couldn't go into the details of what was
[26:01] going on he couldn't really get down
[26:03] into all the names because there were
[26:04] just too many names of people who live
[26:07] by faith who walk by feet who worship by
[26:10] faith who shout by fit who rejoiced by
[26:13] faith
[26:14] somebody help me this morning
[26:17] hallelujah if you don't have faith this
[26:20] morning you're going to leave here with
[26:21] faith
[26:26] you may be seated what shall i most say
[26:28] for the time would fail me and i feel
[26:30] this morning time would fail me to tell
[26:32] of gideon amen gideon and i'm barack and
[26:35] of samson and of jephthah of david and
[26:39] samuel and of the prophets who true
[26:42] faith subdued kingdoms they arrested
[26:45] kingdoms wrought righteousness of
[26:47] obtained promises or stopped the mouth
[26:50] of lions and quench the violence of fire
[26:53] escape the edge of the sword
[26:56] somebody give god a south
[26:59] he may be seated out of weakness were
[27:02] made strong
[27:03] wax valiant and fight turned to flight
[27:06] the armies of the aliens
[27:08] women received their dead race to life
[27:12] others were tortured
[27:14] not accepting deliverance
[27:16] that they might obtain a better
[27:19] resurrection
[27:20] oh we're gonna live by faith this
[27:22] morning we're gonna rejoice by faith
[27:24] this morning
[27:27] hallelujah he may be seated
[27:30] i'm just encouraging your faith this
[27:32] morning
[27:34] what we see with our natural eyes is the
[27:36] enemy of fate
[27:40] whatever you can see is the enemy of
[27:42] fate because fate has the ability to see
[27:44] what's invisible
[27:47] so when i look at the audience this
[27:48] morning you might look in the mirror and
[27:50] say i don't know if i can make it but
[27:52] god is a god of faith
[27:54] hallelujah when he looks at you he
[27:56] doesn't see you in your weak condition
[27:58] he doesn't see you in your dead
[27:59] condition he doesn't see your sin last
[28:01] night because he's looking through the
[28:03] blood and by faith you could be in the
[28:05] house of god this morning
[28:09] you may be seated
[28:11] it troubled by the branham it disturbed
[28:14] the prophet when he would have these
[28:15] healing campaigns and people were
[28:17] sitting in church for all the years and
[28:19] they couldn't get healed and people
[28:21] would walk off the street and they would
[28:23] get a hold of fate and they would get
[28:25] this deposit on their account and they
[28:27] would have this card like a mastercard
[28:30] or a visa card only it's called an
[28:32] eternity card and there's a fake
[28:34] currency
[28:36] that your boss can give you your wife
[28:39] can't give you your neighbor can't give
[28:41] you how long you're in church doesn't
[28:43] top that account up that's a faith
[28:45] account
[28:46] i mean the problem said fate
[28:49] is a revelation of the will of god
[28:52] and if you get a revelation of the will
[28:54] of god about your life it gives you a
[28:56] reason to celebrate
[28:59] it gives you a reason to jump it gives
[29:01] you a reason to dance some of you
[29:03] haven't danced for a long time but this
[29:05] morning i feel like dancing this morning
[29:08] after he like shouted him this morning i
[29:10] feel like praising this morning i feel
[29:13] like lifting up the name of jesus
[29:25] you made me see them
[29:27] fate is the purchasing power
[29:30] it is invisible
[29:31] you can see it brother branham said we
[29:34] have to exchange our fate for healing
[29:39] you have to exchange your faith for the
[29:41] holy ghost that's a direct quote
[29:42] so there's some place there got to be
[29:44] someplace with the clearance there's a
[29:46] counter somewhere where on the other
[29:48] side of the counter it's the holy ghost
[29:50] it's the healing it's your children it's
[29:53] what you're looking for and there's
[29:55] somebody
[29:56] collecting faith saying give me the
[29:58] faith and look the holy ghost give me
[30:00] your faith and look your healing give me
[30:02] your faith and look your son give me
[30:04] your faith look at your daughter
[30:07] oh
[30:08] somebody help me this morning
[30:10] the faith level is going to rise and
[30:12] rise and rise until one day you're going
[30:14] to break into rapturing fate and when
[30:17] you're breaking the rapture and faith
[30:19] you're going to walk up to that count up
[30:20] and you're going to hand that face right
[30:22] there and you're going to get a
[30:23] spaceship
[30:27] we're going to leave this place
[30:29] glory to god somebody say man
[30:32] somebody give god praise
[30:37] hallelujah
[30:39] you may be seated what are you seeing
[30:41] preacher you may not have money this
[30:43] morning this christmas me you may not
[30:45] have any ham this morning i don't know
[30:46] but if you have faith this morning
[30:49] you could speak for him
[31:01] but isaac are you serious
[31:03] are you you know who you are you know
[31:05] who your father is you know who your god
[31:08] is you know the power that's locked up
[31:10] in you it takes faith to activate the
[31:12] power the power never left the power's
[31:15] been here all along we just didn't have
[31:17] enough faith
[31:19] but seven thunders
[31:20] seven thunders gives the bright faith to
[31:24] activate the power
[31:31] you maybe see that
[31:32] look at blind bottom ears
[31:35] he had a routine he had a schedule every
[31:37] morning he'd get up and strategically
[31:39] place himself where everybody would pass
[31:41] by you can't be looking to beg and go on
[31:43] a deserted street where nobody is
[31:45] passing
[31:46] amen
[31:47] even a blind man knows you got to be
[31:49] somewhere where the crowd is so he
[31:51] couldn't see how to get there but
[31:53] whether he listened to the footsteps or
[31:54] whatever he knew where to place himself
[31:56] to beg but wherever he went to pick the
[31:59] crowd he would usually expect i don't
[32:01] know what budget he was working with but
[32:03] the crowd he would expect to get the
[32:05] money was looking for they just weren't
[32:08] there so he had to question where is
[32:10] everybody and they said brother
[32:12] everybody is with jesus
[32:15] i don't know if you know him
[32:17] but he heals the sick
[32:18] he raises the dead he causes the blind
[32:21] to seek the lame to walk the dumb to
[32:24] talk blind by the mayor's put down his
[32:26] collection receipt book he said you tell
[32:29] me that somebody could heal my eyes he
[32:32] didn't know how to find emma because he
[32:33] couldn't see his way maybe you came this
[32:36] morning and you can't see your way but
[32:38] jesus is on the street this morning
[32:42] hallelujah
[32:44] hallelujah you maybe see that so blind
[32:47] by the mayors did the only thing he had
[32:49] power to do
[32:50] hallelujah he's not gonna lift his voice
[32:53] he couldn't walk anywhere he can see
[32:55] jesus
[32:56] he used all he had he said jesus
[32:59] son of david have mercy on me those
[33:02] around him said pardon mayor stop
[33:05] wasting time but he went into fate he
[33:08] went into fate he broke into peter and
[33:11] that fate connected with god's satellite
[33:14] and it relayed from god's satellite to
[33:17] where jesus was and jesus began to walk
[33:20] to him like he walked to you this
[33:22] morning and he's here to meet your need
[33:33] hallelujah
[33:35] he may be seated
[33:36] faith says the situation can change
[33:40] fate says
[33:42] before the doctor's hand
[33:44] could touch my wife
[33:46] the tumor is going to go down
[33:48] faith says
[33:49] it doesn't matter what the situation is
[33:52] the situation will change and this
[33:54] morning we are earnestly contending
[33:57] for the faith restored by malachi 4
[34:01] because the fate has been restored how
[34:03] could you say this because that was
[34:04] brother branham's purpose to restore the
[34:07] fate so you can't tell me that he wasted
[34:09] his time when he came to this earth so
[34:12] the fact that he's not here means the
[34:14] fate has already been restored now it's
[34:17] up to us to contend
[34:33] everybody feeling fine this morning
[34:35] everybody happy in the house of god this
[34:37] morning
[34:38] hallelujah this is the real christmas
[34:40] message
[34:44] listen to brother branham
[34:46] you know some people has great big fate
[34:48] like that
[34:49] they can be healed in a moment
[34:52] some have faith that much they can be
[34:53] healed in a week
[34:55] some has mustard seed feed takes them a
[34:57] long time
[35:00] so there are different measures of fate
[35:02] for you to start your car you have to
[35:03] have it you believe when you turn the
[35:05] ignition
[35:06] something is going to happen
[35:08] that's fate when you tell your neighbor
[35:10] or your friend i'm going to see you at
[35:11] nine o'clock in the morning lord willing
[35:13] that's fate when you walk on your house
[35:15] to go to work you have faith to believe
[35:17] that you're going to reach to work and
[35:19] that's a low level of faith but branham
[35:21] talked about dingy fate he talked about
[35:23] the lepers who were outside the city and
[35:25] they say if we stay here we die
[35:27] if we go out we die we might as well go
[35:30] out that's the lowest fee that's reason
[35:32] and faith
[35:36] but this morning we're not talking about
[35:38] that low level of faith we're talking
[35:40] about your fear coming up to the
[35:41] restored fate the apostolic fate the
[35:44] original fate the faith they had in the
[35:47] day of pentecost with the same signs the
[35:50] same wonders the faith that jesus was
[35:52] resurrected
[35:57] you may be seated
[35:59] brother branham said we hardly have
[36:01] faith
[36:02] for divine healing are we going to have
[36:04] faith for the rapture so something has
[36:06] to happen
[36:07] to the faith banks in the church
[36:09] that the impossible can become possible
[36:12] the bible says when the son of man
[36:14] cometh shall he find more groups more
[36:16] churches more ministers
[36:18] more teaching more doctrine more ideas
[36:21] no shall he find fate and that son of
[36:24] man cometh is not seen luke 17 30 that's
[36:26] not brother branham that son of man
[36:27] coming as dynamics to rest upon fate
[36:31] to rest upon the faith in the church to
[36:33] connect with the faith in the church
[36:35] somebody's saying man
[36:40] so faith with all works is dead
[36:43] faith must cause action
[36:45] faith must be demonstrated faith must be
[36:48] displayed you can tell me you have faith
[36:51] and you're not doing something about
[36:52] your situation
[37:01] faith has here in its chest
[37:03] real feet can't sit down
[37:05] you could be in a wheelchair but your
[37:07] faith could be standing up
[37:11] can the church say a man
[37:14] everybody feeling fine this morning
[37:17] and jesus when he came he represented
[37:19] the fate
[37:22] was the fate
[37:23] and he came to deliver the fate
[37:26] to his disciples to the apostles so they
[37:30] would have the same signs the same ones
[37:32] the same miracles
[37:33] now listen carefully it took fate for
[37:36] the apostles to go to the upper room
[37:43] they needed faith to go to the upper
[37:45] room
[37:46] and they caught faith listen carefully
[37:49] when they saw jesus raised from the dead
[37:53] they have faith
[37:55] because they saw something they never
[37:57] saw before
[37:58] they saw something they couldn't really
[38:00] explain to anybody but they saw it and
[38:03] they caught faith
[38:05] and that measure of faith
[38:08] brought them to the upper room listen
[38:10] they did not yet have faith to preach
[38:12] the gospel
[38:14] they didn't have faith to say self and
[38:16] go have i none they did not fade yet to
[38:18] move the power they only had enough fate
[38:21] to make it to the upper room
[38:26] oh
[38:27] i hope you see where i'm going this
[38:28] morning they didn't have faith with the
[38:30] same signs for the same wonders for the
[38:32] same miracles they didn't have faith for
[38:34] the greater works they only had enough
[38:36] fate
[38:37] to just make it to the upper room in
[38:40] fact for the problem said they hold
[38:41] themselves up so all that they heard and
[38:44] saw gave them enough faith to just come
[38:47] to the upper room
[38:50] they didn't have faith to go after their
[38:51] children they didn't have faith to do
[38:54] any greater work just yet but they had
[38:56] faith to go to the upper room
[39:00] and you say to me preach up i don't have
[39:02] faith he had to go after my son to go
[39:05] after my daughter but we are preaching
[39:07] the faith to take you to the upper room
[39:09] this morning
[39:13] because when the holy ghost fell the
[39:15] fate was delivered to them and when the
[39:18] holy ghost failed that same peter
[39:21] who didn't have the faith to face the
[39:23] romans to face anybody he said this is
[39:26] that which was spoken by the prophet
[39:28] joel
[39:29] because the faith was delivered
[39:34] oh
[39:36] glory glory glory glory
[39:38] so don't be discouraged
[39:40] don't give up now don't backslide now
[39:44] you are already in the church this
[39:45] morning your fate already brought you
[39:47] the right place at the right time now
[39:50] let god take care of the rest of it god
[39:52] told him terry
[39:54] terry in the city of jerusalem
[39:56] until you be endured with power from
[39:58] manheim they couldn't accelerate it they
[40:00] couldn't speed it up they just had to
[40:02] have faith to wait
[40:09] he may be seated
[40:11] you know when as the more the lord opens
[40:13] up to me i realize how many people
[40:15] really miss this message of malachi 4.
[40:18] pastors ministers people had a message
[40:20] for 50 years 40 years is really relevant
[40:22] length or tenure in a message really of
[40:24] no consequence it's about revelation
[40:26] that's right because when god gives you
[40:28] a revelation it makes you stand on a
[40:29] film foundation that nobody can move you
[40:32] can't tell me you have a revelation and
[40:34] then you just jump and teach this teach
[40:36] just teach that that's off the world a
[40:37] revelation will keep you on the word
[40:39] even if you fall even if you make a
[40:41] mistake the revelation will point you to
[40:43] your destination
[40:45] the
[40:46] revelation is like it's like it's like
[40:47] you're not part of a compass
[40:49] it keeps you aligned to the right place
[40:52] so even with all peter's mistakes his
[40:54] fault
[40:55] peter denied christ but peter had a
[40:57] revelation that was pointed to one
[40:59] destination the upper room the upper
[41:02] room the upper room the upper room the
[41:05] upper room that was the destination you
[41:07] may be seated
[41:09] i want you to catch this
[41:11] jesus in his resurrection ministry
[41:14] after he rose from the dead the bible
[41:17] says he opened the disciples
[41:19] understanding to the scriptures
[41:21] in other words for the three and a half
[41:23] years they walked with jesus and they
[41:26] saw the miracles and they heard jesus
[41:28] preach they did not understand what was
[41:31] going on
[41:34] and there are many people sitting in
[41:35] church this morning who have been in
[41:36] church for years and they don't
[41:38] understand what is going on
[41:42] so jesus after he rose from the dead he
[41:44] had his 40-day resurrection ministry and
[41:47] the same disciples who saw him heal the
[41:50] sick raised the dead saw him die and
[41:52] rose again now he opened the
[41:54] understanding to the scriptures
[41:58] listen the opening of the word drove
[42:02] them to the upper room
[42:04] to wait for the holy ghost
[42:06] to wait for dynamics
[42:08] the opening of the word didn't drive
[42:11] them to say well let me try to teach
[42:12] this try to explain this no the opening
[42:15] of the word drove them to the upper room
[42:18] to wait for the promise of the father to
[42:21] wait for thief hey
[42:28] you may be seated listen carefully when
[42:31] the word is opened to you it will drive
[42:34] you to the upper room it will drive you
[42:37] to wait for dynamics
[42:43] the fact that their understanding was
[42:46] open was not enough to meet the
[42:48] challenge of the hour
[42:50] they needed to have the faith
[42:52] they needed to have the power they
[42:54] needed to have dynamics but the opening
[42:56] of the word was to put them in
[42:59] desperation and expectation and
[43:02] preparation for the power and
[43:07] you don't hear me this morning
[43:11] you may be seated
[43:12] we're going to have a trained church
[43:17] a train in the church you must be sharp
[43:19] with the word
[43:20] shop with the word
[43:24] some of you speak to some people look at
[43:25] the world we know it's sharper than any
[43:26] two-edged sword you thought of some
[43:28] people and they hit in the wood like
[43:30] this and that saw their shopping for
[43:31] five years seven years
[43:34] clown clown you're not gonna hear no
[43:35] clown with my sword
[43:40] no contact like a laser
[43:44] who is that
[43:45] who who passed through there's no clan
[43:47] clan this sword is so sad
[43:50] star wars and style whatever laser
[43:52] technology we had it a long time ago
[43:57] sharper enemy two-headed sword rightly
[43:59] dividing the wood bringing fresh skilled
[44:02] meat every service
[44:04] spiritual food and due season tastes
[44:06] good tastes fresh no microwave food this
[44:09] food is just being cooked right now
[44:12] right now
[44:13] right now
[44:14] fresh out the oven fresh out the oven
[44:17] you are the first one to cut it
[44:20] let's cut it up this morning let's share
[44:22] it up this morning
[44:24] hallelujah this is pre-christmas dinner
[44:27] we got the turkey this morning we got
[44:29] the chicken this morning we got fresh
[44:31] pig this morning
[44:37] you may be seated
[44:38] so the word
[44:40] was open to them so they know what to
[44:42] expect
[44:43] what to look for what to wait for
[44:46] peter ran up and said now the word is
[44:48] open let me go and tell everybody this
[44:50] and that no
[44:51] tarry
[44:52] in the city of jerusalem
[44:54] until you be enduring power from behind
[44:57] amen
[45:00] so the word is open to us
[45:04] to wait for dynamics
[45:06] the promise is just as real to us now as
[45:09] it was to them when they were waiting
[45:11] for the holy ghost
[45:13] now listen carefully
[45:15] no wonder but the pranam said wait
[45:18] till those seven thunders
[45:20] utter their voices to that group
[45:22] that can take the word and hand it there
[45:26] now i wanna say something here
[45:29] you know it's amazing how people can
[45:30] read the same quotes
[45:32] i come up with different conclusions
[45:34] and i remember when i was in school they
[45:36] told us when you use language
[45:39] and expression and you're trying to make
[45:41] emphasis you could emphasize
[45:43] any kind of thing in a sentence so i
[45:46] could say the boy
[45:48] ran down the road
[45:50] and i could emphasize the boy ran down
[45:52] the road so not the girl the boy ran
[45:54] down the road
[45:55] i could say the boy ran down the road he
[45:57] didn't walk
[45:59] he ran down the road
[46:01] so the boy ran down the road he didn't
[46:02] run down the highway
[46:04] he ran down the road it's the same
[46:05] sentence but the interpretation of it
[46:08] could be different depending on what you
[46:10] emphasize
[46:11] so people sometimes read quotes and say
[46:12] and they run off with something but that
[46:15] page 304 quote says wait till the seven
[46:17] thunders utter their voices to that
[46:19] group and a lot of people got stuck
[46:20] under that group part and say this is my
[46:22] group is your group is that group is
[46:24] this group and the focus is not on the
[46:26] group the focus is who could take the
[46:28] word and hand it there
[46:31] that is gospel
[46:33] that is the word
[46:36] so when you want to read and go around
[46:37] talking about stuff make sure it is
[46:39] divinely revealed to you what the word
[46:42] is saying
[46:43] because there are many groups that can't
[46:45] take the word and there are many groups
[46:47] that can't hand it there
[46:50] oh somebody help me this morning
[46:55] to take the word means take all the word
[46:57] to hand it there means to know what to
[46:59] do with the word
[47:02] and that could only take place when the
[47:04] word is open to you so that's why wait
[47:06] until the seven thunders utter their
[47:08] voices to that group who could take the
[47:11] word knows what to do with the word in
[47:13] other words have the mind of christ the
[47:15] intelligence to know what to do with the
[47:17] word then they're gonna slice it's gonna
[47:20] cut it's gonna open the heavens
[47:24] you may be seated
[47:27] i might get it lord but i said what are
[47:29] you doing i'm contending for the fate
[47:32] i'm arguing for the faith you can't stop
[47:34] me i know who i am i know who my god is
[47:38] jude exhorted us he didn't exhort the
[47:41] ministers he exhorted everybody content
[47:43] for the faith
[47:44] fight for the fate that was once
[47:46] delivered to the saints because we need
[47:49] that state to get out of here
[47:54] you maybe see that
[47:56] i'm tired of playing games tired of the
[47:59] foolishness people supposed to know
[48:01] better
[48:14] we're going to make this church so hot
[48:16] that's why i love what brother orbit
[48:18] said last week
[48:19] there is no church template for us to
[48:21] follow on the earth
[48:24] there's only one temple there's a word
[48:26] template
[48:27] there is no church on the planet that i
[48:28] can look up to i have to look up to the
[48:30] word template
[48:32] and ephesians church because we are
[48:34] looking for another ephesians
[48:38] and every sovereign church has to
[48:40] contend for the faith to be manifested
[48:43] in that church and what's the faith the
[48:45] same signs the same wonders the same
[48:47] miracles the same life the same power
[48:50] the same anointing the same dynamics the
[48:53] same spirit
[49:14] how could you be that group if you're
[49:16] not taking the word and you don't know
[49:17] what to do with it
[49:19] i'm on page three or four you're not
[49:21] taking the word you don't know what to
[49:22] do with it but you're on the page you
[49:23] can only reach that page when you have
[49:24] all the word in you the full food value
[49:26] in uf mechanics and the mind of christ
[49:29] the the the the faculty that doesn't
[49:31] move that intelligence drops down to
[49:34] know how to rightly divide the word in
[49:36] the right season to have the right
[49:37] effect because whether branham said one
[49:39] day the right word would be spoken the
[49:41] right thing would be said and we were
[49:43] dashed into the presence
[49:45] and you want to tell me i'm supposed to
[49:47] play games with this gospel when i got
[49:49] family out there i got loved ones out
[49:51] there they are backsliders we're not
[49:53] here right now we have to have a power
[49:54] to go after
[49:57] i don't them what condition they're in
[49:59] this morning we're coming for them
[50:01] we are serving notice this morning we
[50:03] are coming we are coming
[50:06] there will be one more ride we're gonna
[50:08] ride this trail one more time and pick
[50:11] up our loved ones pick up our families
[50:15] he may be seated
[50:18] from the message spoken with his
[50:20] original seed notice what harmony jesus
[50:22] never did anything until seen of the
[50:24] father the father showed him first
[50:27] harmony between god and christ see so
[50:29] will the bride
[50:30] and he shows out his word of life he
[50:32] shows up and she receives it she never
[50:35] doubts it nothing could harm or not even
[50:37] death for if the seed be planted the
[50:39] water will raise it up again
[50:42] now i got a great big hallelujah that's
[50:44] a
[50:44] prophet speaking here's the secret the
[50:46] word is in the bride
[50:48] that's why we have to contend for it
[50:50] because the word must be in the pride
[50:51] and the mind of christ to know what he
[50:54] wants done with the word and she does it
[50:56] in his name she has thus saith the lord
[51:01] somebody's saying man
[51:03] amen
[51:05] what are they going to keep still that's
[51:07] right
[51:16] so young people this is for you
[51:19] i'm tired of hearing young people tell
[51:21] me that they don't want to come to
[51:22] church because there are too many
[51:23] hypocrites in the church
[51:31] we have parents fathers mothers
[51:33] grandfathers grandchildren
[51:36] saying this kind of foolishness
[51:40] and the only reason you could say
[51:41] something like that is because you
[51:42] really lack the revelation of this
[51:44] mystery of what god is
[51:47] because if you look at matthew 16 and
[51:49] it's very interesting when you study the
[51:51] scriptures
[51:53] jesus asks his disciples who do men say
[51:55] i am
[51:56] and they began to with the knowledge
[51:58] that they had and their need to impress
[52:00] and a desire to sound sophisticated they
[52:02] said all the most spiritual names they
[52:04] could come up with elijah john the
[52:05] baptist jeremiah or one of the great
[52:07] prophets
[52:09] that's what they're saying and then
[52:10] jesus challenged the very men who were
[52:12] there all these years watching him and
[52:14] say who do you say that i am
[52:17] and there was silence in the church
[52:19] nobody was jumping up nobody was
[52:20] shouting nobody was singing because he
[52:22] caught them
[52:24] and then peter says that were the christ
[52:26] the son of the living god
[52:28] and jesus turns to him and say peter
[52:32] flesh and blood didn't reveal this to
[52:34] you
[52:35] but my father in heaven
[52:37] and upon this rock i built my church
[52:40] do you know how good peter felt
[52:43] you know how the disciples the other
[52:44] disciples felt why
[52:47] why couldn't have been me
[52:49] but i want you to look a little deeper
[52:50] down because it was after that jesus
[52:52] began to explain to the disciples what's
[52:55] about to unfold because he didn't want
[52:56] to tell them without them knowing who he
[52:58] was
[52:59] so you have to clarify that issue first
[53:00] so now you know who i am let me tell you
[53:02] what's about to happen
[53:04] and then tell them peter ups and says
[53:06] don't do it lord and don't die and and
[53:08] what did jesus say get thee behind me
[53:10] satan
[53:12] so i want you to imagine somebody
[53:14] watching at the church that day who
[53:15] missed the first part and just walk in
[53:17] and see jesus telling peter getty behind
[53:19] me satan he said look at the hypocrite
[53:21] now
[53:24] jesus have a devil in his church
[53:27] how could he look at unbelief look at
[53:31] and what people fail to realize is that
[53:33] peter had a destination
[53:37] this seemed peter who had a revelation
[53:39] because if anybody had a revelation was
[53:42] peter
[53:44] jesus confirmed he had a revelation
[53:47] but the revelation didn't take the snake
[53:49] out of his heart
[53:52] all the revelation was doing was telling
[53:54] him you have an upper room to come
[53:57] up a room to come up a room to come
[54:00] so peter walking around with a
[54:01] revelation and his behavior still had
[54:04] change
[54:07] it's changing but it's natural change
[54:09] there's no spiritual change because when
[54:11] the world comes to you begin to shape up
[54:13] you begin to clean your land but there's
[54:14] a spiritual something that peter needed
[54:17] to kill the snake you could be here
[54:19] yourself and avoid shady places and do
[54:21] all this stuff but when the holy ghost
[54:24] fire bombs a snake in your heart
[54:30] fire bombs that lust
[54:32] fire bombs that demon fire bomb that
[54:34] lion spirit
[54:36] you may be seated
[54:39] so don't be too quick to judge people
[54:45] because the upper room is to come
[54:49] let me see it another way until dynamic
[54:52] strike
[54:53] just keep praying for people
[54:55] and make sure your calling and election
[54:57] is short why why listen carefully
[55:00] because when dynamic strikes it's too
[55:02] late to add word food value because the
[55:05] rain comes to bring up the sea that
[55:07] planted
[55:08] so you have to make sure right now
[55:10] instead of looking at other people and
[55:12] criticizing you add the word in your
[55:15] life so when the rain comes you could
[55:17] say lord here i am
[55:19] i'm ready
[55:22] what are you doing with isaac i'm
[55:24] earnestly contending for the faith
[55:26] restored by malachi 4.
[55:32] i hope this sets some people free this
[55:33] morning
[55:36] you may be seated
[55:38] it's impossible
[55:40] to contend for the faith without bumping
[55:43] into someone who doesn't agree with you
[55:49] contending means there will be conflict
[55:52] there will be argument there will be
[55:54] contention
[55:55] and i'm going to go into some scriptures
[55:56] because i know some of you may not have
[55:57] read it but you're going to see in the
[55:59] scripture what i'm talking about
[56:01] and i want to say this if everybody in
[56:03] the message
[56:04] understood what the faith was there
[56:07] would be no confusion amen
[56:10] and that's the truth
[56:12] but the brandon taught us that the lack
[56:14] of revelation is what causes the
[56:16] division
[56:19] so you can help it when people want to
[56:21] argue with you or at times you will have
[56:23] to argue because the command is content
[56:25] for it because we are looking to see
[56:27] something
[56:28] the fate has been delivered it has been
[56:31] restored we have to contend to make a
[56:33] church that will make a revival
[56:36] that's our responsibility somebody's
[56:38] amen
[56:40] hallelujah so let me do a little
[56:42] teaching for a few minutes contending
[56:44] the corinthians had contentions over
[56:47] foolishness over the law over who did
[56:48] this and stuff like that but let's look
[56:50] at the book of acts
[56:53] can we do that
[56:55] everyone could follow with me acts 11.
[57:03] acts 11 verse 1.
[57:05] do a little bible teaching this morning
[57:08] because
[57:10] in speaking to the pastor i said you
[57:11] know
[57:12] 2014 is coming to an end and certain
[57:14] behaviors of 2014 will not cross over
[57:17] into 2015.
[57:20] so you need to read the word more you
[57:21] need to be sharper because listen the
[57:23] end is here you know
[57:25] it's not coming it's here
[57:27] so listen carefully
[57:29] acts 11 verse 1
[57:31] and the apostles and the brethren that
[57:33] were in judea heard that the gentiles
[57:36] had also received the word of god
[57:39] and when peter was come up to jerusalem
[57:41] they were they that were of the
[57:43] circumcision contended with him now
[57:45] understand that this is these are not
[57:47] unbelievers now
[57:48] these are the original jews who were
[57:50] with jesus who heard word that the word
[57:53] went to the gentiles and they had a
[57:55] problem with that
[57:56] and they contended these are holy
[57:58] ghostfield brothers
[58:00] men of the circumcision they contended
[58:01] with peter
[58:03] the same peter
[58:05] that god said you have a revelation the
[58:06] same peter that said this is that the
[58:08] same pizza i got to give you the keys
[58:10] whatever you pine on earth is bound in
[58:11] heaven they contended with peter
[58:15] seeing dog wentes into men uncircumcised
[58:18] and did eat with them
[58:21] but peter rehearsed the matter from the
[58:23] beginning and expounded it by order unto
[58:26] them in other words step by step he
[58:28] explained here what this is what
[58:29] happened
[58:32] now you understand it's a real spirit
[58:34] when you say when somebody accuses you
[58:37] of something and don't even give you the
[58:38] opportunity to explain what happened
[58:43] so here it is this is the apostle peter
[58:45] and fellow ministers fellow apostles and
[58:47] when peter get back to jerusalem leave
[58:49] the gentiles he comes home and he said
[58:50] brother we have a problem with you peter
[58:52] why are you with the gentiles why are
[58:54] you eating their food why are you
[58:55] ministering to them and people say wait
[58:56] hold up
[58:57] let me explain to you what happened
[58:59] because i know you heard it truly
[59:00] grapevine
[59:02] but now i'm here to explain to you
[59:04] what really went on
[59:09] that's why i said we're gonna have a
[59:10] trench and we have too many grapevines i
[59:12] have to cut some of the vines
[59:20] and you read it in your own time peter
[59:22] goes and explains to them and then
[59:24] reached down to a point where
[59:26] in like verse 15 he says and as i begin
[59:28] to speak this is peter talking the holy
[59:29] ghost fell on them
[59:31] how could you deny that so peter is
[59:33] telling him what happened and tell him
[59:34] what happened and how how he reached the
[59:36] end whenever he said as i begin to speak
[59:37] the holy ghost fell upon them
[59:40] as on us at the beginning how could they
[59:42] deny that
[59:43] so he said so peter come and tell them
[59:45] not only did they receive the word but
[59:47] the holy ghost that we have
[59:48] fell upon them also
[59:51] in other words peter is contending for
[59:53] defeat
[59:54] arguing debating explaining and then
[59:57] here peter then remembered i the word of
[59:59] the lord how that he said john indeed
[1:00:01] baptized with water but he shall be
[1:00:03] baptized with the holy ghost
[1:00:07] and the bible said verse 18 when they
[1:00:09] heard these things they held their peace
[1:00:11] and glorified god so you want to tell me
[1:00:14] that contention is not part of it people
[1:00:16] want to say well we we we're fighting
[1:00:18] too much that's scriptural
[1:00:23] let's go to acts 15.
[1:00:27] everybody feeling fine
[1:00:32] reading the bible now
[1:00:37] acts 15 let's go to verse
[1:00:40] 35.
[1:00:50] paul also and barnabas continued antioch
[1:00:53] teaching and preaching the word of the
[1:00:54] lord with many others also
[1:00:57] and some days after paul said unto
[1:00:59] barnabas let us go again and visit our
[1:01:01] brethren in every city where we have
[1:01:03] preached the word of the lord and see
[1:01:05] how they're doing let's go let's go
[1:01:06] check up on them
[1:01:07] and barnabas determined to take with
[1:01:10] them john whose surname was mark
[1:01:13] but paul thought not good to take him
[1:01:16] with them
[1:01:17] who departed from them from pamphlet and
[1:01:19] went not with them to the work
[1:01:21] you say i don't want mark to go and but
[1:01:23] i'm saying let's carry mark
[1:01:25] listen to the scripture
[1:01:27] these are holy ghost-filled brothers
[1:01:29] and the contention was so sharp between
[1:01:32] them
[1:01:34] that they departed a son of one from the
[1:01:36] other
[1:01:37] and so barnabas took mark and sail on
[1:01:39] the cypress and paul chose silas and
[1:01:41] departed being recommended by the
[1:01:44] president unto the grace of god
[1:01:48] what is paul doing earnestly contending
[1:01:50] for the faith and paul was actually
[1:01:53] right because later he said no mark
[1:01:55] ready he could come with us
[1:02:01] so all those who want to sit down in
[1:02:03] church in the message saying well i'd
[1:02:04] already know what's going on and i don't
[1:02:06] know who they believe and i don't know
[1:02:07] what to do and too much fighting what is
[1:02:10] that army
[1:02:12] the opinion potato days are over
[1:02:15] 2014 is the last year of peeling
[1:02:17] potatoes
[1:02:19] we are using an automated kitchen to do
[1:02:21] the food
[1:02:22] everybody now in the army
[1:02:24] everybody has to fight and contend for
[1:02:26] defeat delivered to the saints restored
[1:02:29] by malachi 4.
[1:02:36] what are we doing but i say contending
[1:02:38] for the faith
[1:02:43] last example
[1:02:44] acts 19 here it is apollos
[1:02:47] has an intellectual
[1:02:49] fate of the message
[1:02:52] and here is paul coming down saying
[1:02:54] here's what
[1:02:55] paul with defeat comes down and say have
[1:02:57] you received
[1:02:58] the holy ghost
[1:03:00] since you believe
[1:03:01] and upon us with his intellectual fate
[1:03:03] saying well i didn't really know about
[1:03:04] this holy ghost you're talking about and
[1:03:06] i thought i am the holy ghost i taught
[1:03:08] all kinds of different things
[1:03:12] i thought when i believed that god said
[1:03:13] he said unto what were you baptized
[1:03:17] what is paul doing he's contending for
[1:03:19] the faith
[1:03:21] he said i know you believe but have you
[1:03:22] received the holy ghost since you
[1:03:24] believed
[1:03:26] what is paul doing contending for the
[1:03:29] faith
[1:03:33] i'm done
[1:03:35] with the teaching parts
[1:03:39] everybody feeling fine this morning
[1:03:41] give the lord a hand to praise
[1:03:49] we're doing good
[1:03:51] we're doing very good this morning
[1:03:54] so when you read the book of jude
[1:03:56] and i've already passed half of the
[1:03:58] message so we're gonna
[1:03:59] begin to
[1:04:01] head towards the finish line here now
[1:04:04] jude said that that that man of
[1:04:07] reprobate minds
[1:04:14] came in
[1:04:16] and and brought these problems and
[1:04:17] anointed once at the end time but the
[1:04:19] branham said reprobate janice and
[1:04:21] jamborees as they withstood moses we
[1:04:23] have these second timothy three spirits
[1:04:27] having a form of godliness
[1:04:29] but denying the power
[1:04:31] denying the power of salvation the power
[1:04:33] of deliverance the power of worship the
[1:04:34] power of the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:04:37] the power of dynamics
[1:04:41] and then anointing one of the end times
[1:04:42] with the balance and here come paul
[1:04:43] right behind him
[1:04:45] saying now in the last days there will
[1:04:47] come religious people having a form of
[1:04:49] godliness
[1:04:50] and lead silly woman led away with all
[1:04:52] kinds of worldly lusts
[1:04:55] now as janice and chambers but still
[1:04:57] moses so were these reprobate reprobate
[1:04:59] minds concerning the faith that's a
[1:05:02] prophet not a faith defeat
[1:05:05] one feet one lord one bap you can't have
[1:05:09] one faith without believing in one lord
[1:05:11] you can't have two baptisms not one for
[1:05:14] the father and son and the holy ghost
[1:05:16] one baptism
[1:05:18] this is the prophet
[1:05:20] now here is your promise in jehovah gyra
[1:05:23] as the church of god as the evening
[1:05:25] lights are beginning to shine and the
[1:05:27] tree is getting ripe
[1:05:28] god said he would restore that tree that
[1:05:31] same pentecostal tree same kind of fate
[1:05:34] same everything that they had that tree
[1:05:36] will be restored again without
[1:05:38] denomination without anything it will
[1:05:41] come in the simple power of the holy
[1:05:43] spirit teaching the bible just exactly
[1:05:47] the way it did
[1:05:48] we promise one in the last days you know
[1:05:51] to come and restore the faith i believe
[1:05:53] he's here tonight in the form of the
[1:05:54] holy spirit amen
[1:05:56] can the church say amen
[1:05:58] so when god is ready to do something you
[1:06:01] always have to raise up a prophet
[1:06:05] isn't that right
[1:06:06] when god was ready to deliver he raised
[1:06:08] up moses
[1:06:10] when god was ready to anoint a king he
[1:06:11] raised up samuel
[1:06:13] when god is breaking knowledge has come
[1:06:15] and he raised up isaiah
[1:06:16] when he was ready to weep you raised up
[1:06:18] jeremiah when god is right there
[1:06:20] establish the faith he raised up jesus
[1:06:23] and when god is ready to restore the
[1:06:25] faith you raised up william mary and
[1:06:26] branham
[1:06:30] and in each age god had a voice it was
[1:06:33] by faith that each man spoke
[1:06:36] but before god could get to brother
[1:06:38] branham because that early church fell
[1:06:41] and men crept in and they fall gradually
[1:06:44] to fall away from their faith until the
[1:06:46] church was powerless until it was formal
[1:06:49] until people just come on a sunday
[1:06:50] because they're supposed to be in church
[1:06:52] and the church that god built on the day
[1:06:54] of pentecost ceased to exist
[1:06:57] amen amen
[1:06:58] so god had to restore
[1:07:00] but before he could send that great
[1:07:02] mighty prophet malachi 4
[1:07:05] he had to start somewhere so he start
[1:07:07] with luther and what is luther's message
[1:07:09] the just shall live by faith
[1:07:13] because we are going back to defeat
[1:07:15] so he's announcing it early here's where
[1:07:17] we're going we're going back to the
[1:07:18] faith that just shall live by faith
[1:07:20] in the resume of the ages brother
[1:07:22] branham said and now it says god is
[1:07:23] going to restore
[1:07:25] but ibraham said the lutheran age did
[1:07:27] not restore the church it started a
[1:07:28] reformation
[1:07:30] the wesleyan age did not restore the
[1:07:32] pentecostal age did not restore but god
[1:07:35] has to restore for he cannot deny his
[1:07:38] word
[1:07:39] he said this is not the resurrection of
[1:07:41] the church it is the restoration
[1:07:43] god will take the church right back to
[1:07:45] pentecost of the beginning
[1:07:47] now notice in verse 25 song about joel 2
[1:07:51] 25 it tells why we need restoration the
[1:07:53] locust the cankerworm the caterpillar
[1:07:56] and palmerwoom have eaten all but the
[1:07:58] roots and a little bit of the stem but
[1:08:01] now we are told that all these insects
[1:08:03] are all one and the same in different
[1:08:05] stages that is right they are the
[1:08:07] antichrist spirit
[1:08:09] manifested in organization denomination
[1:08:13] and false doctrine through the ages and
[1:08:16] that poor little root and stalk is going
[1:08:18] to be restored
[1:08:19] god isn't going to plant a new church
[1:08:22] but it's going to bring his original
[1:08:24] planting back to original seed
[1:08:27] he is doing it as he stated in verse 23
[1:08:30] by the teaching of former rain next
[1:08:32] we'll come to harvest rain or rapturing
[1:08:35] fate
[1:08:39] and that's what we're looking for
[1:08:40] rapturing fate
[1:08:42] i said to a brother yesterday i said at
[1:08:43] the end of the day it doesn't matter how
[1:08:45] many of the quotes we know
[1:08:47] none of that matters if you miss a
[1:08:49] rapture
[1:08:50] because we'll be bridging the
[1:08:52] tribulation
[1:08:56] so we need to have that rapture in faith
[1:08:59] because that's what it would take for us
[1:09:00] to leave here somebody say amen
[1:09:04] so god sent that prophet to restore the
[1:09:07] church i remember the branham king he
[1:09:09] contended for the fate that was
[1:09:12] delivered to the saints that's why he
[1:09:14] came and he blasted bullheads he blasted
[1:09:16] women preachers he blasted women who cut
[1:09:19] their hair and the makeup and the
[1:09:21] nomination and interpretation and he
[1:09:23] brought the promises the same signs the
[1:09:25] same wonders the same miracles what was
[1:09:28] he doing contending for the faith
[1:09:30] what are we doing this morning
[1:09:32] contending for the faith
[1:09:35] can the church say amen
[1:09:37] and when but the panel reached his new
[1:09:39] ministry
[1:09:40] for the first time since adam
[1:09:43] there were the words let there be
[1:09:48] why because of faith was restored
[1:09:52] when jesus walked the earth he took fish
[1:09:54] and multiply fish he take bread and
[1:09:56] multiply bread but that prophet stood
[1:09:59] there and said let there be a squirrel
[1:10:02] out of the invisible
[1:10:04] came something visible because the fate
[1:10:08] the original fate the fade way back down
[1:10:11] in genesis that was delivered to the
[1:10:13] saints on the day of pentecost was now
[1:10:15] restored in our day
[1:10:18] let there be a squirrel
[1:10:21] sun come out and shine four days
[1:10:24] before the doctor's hand touches my wife
[1:10:27] that's to restore faith in action and
[1:10:29] that restored faith will be manifested
[1:10:32] in this church it will be manifested
[1:10:35] among you
[1:10:41] hallelujah
[1:10:43] and the church say man
[1:10:45] everybody feeling fine
[1:10:50] you maybe see there
[1:10:52] speaking of malachi 4 but i'm saying in
[1:10:54] the evening messenger he says but
[1:10:56] remember this other one talking about
[1:10:58] malachi 4 was to restore the faith of
[1:11:00] the children back to the fathers restore
[1:11:03] the faith of the children back to the
[1:11:04] faith of the fathers the original bible
[1:11:07] he said listen that's exactly what moses
[1:11:09] done that's exactly what jesus done
[1:11:12] that's what exactly every messenger done
[1:11:14] through the bible at the end of that
[1:11:16] dispensation they restored back the
[1:11:19] message
[1:11:20] the people true organization and things
[1:11:23] got all scrupled up and everything in
[1:11:25] them days um said they have done the
[1:11:27] same thing today
[1:11:30] can the church say amen
[1:11:32] so i am encouraging you church this
[1:11:34] morning as we close this year into the
[1:11:37] new year faith will make you begin to do
[1:11:39] what you didn't realize you could do
[1:11:42] and no matter what your trial no matter
[1:11:44] what your test whatever the situation
[1:11:46] faith will make you count the things
[1:11:48] that are not as though they were
[1:11:50] and i'm on a great expectation looking
[1:11:53] for a restored faith in a restored
[1:11:55] church
[1:11:58] in a message uncertain sound but the
[1:12:00] bible said behold i'll send you a light
[1:12:02] to the prophet before that great and
[1:12:04] terrible day shall destroy the world he
[1:12:07] restored the heart of the children back
[1:12:08] to the original fate back to the gospel
[1:12:12] back to the power of god back to the
[1:12:14] real holy spirit back to christ again
[1:12:16] before that great day comes we hear the
[1:12:19] trumpet sounding oh my what is it can
[1:12:22] the church say amen
[1:12:26] from a message god hasn't provided a way
[1:12:28] but the brandon said what am i saying
[1:12:30] god's provided away
[1:12:32] walk in god's provided away he has
[1:12:33] provided us a messenger of the holy
[1:12:35] ghost he has provided us a word and if
[1:12:38] any spirit speaks contrary to the word
[1:12:40] it can't be the holy ghost because the
[1:12:42] holy ghost wrote the word in the
[1:12:44] beginning in the beginning was the word
[1:12:46] the word was with god and the word was
[1:12:48] god and the word was made flesh and
[1:12:50] dwelt among us and the word of god is
[1:12:52] sharper than a two-headed sword but evan
[1:12:55] said cuts all the worldly flesh off of
[1:12:56] you
[1:12:57] is there anybody want to see the worldly
[1:12:59] flesh cut off
[1:13:01] and is a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:13:03] intents of the heart
[1:13:05] i will restore say the lord a high way a
[1:13:08] highway and a way and it shall be called
[1:13:10] a way of holiness and the unclean shall
[1:13:12] not walk in it
[1:13:14] you better clean up today listen to the
[1:13:16] prophet you can't walk with hollywood
[1:13:18] and with the church at the same time
[1:13:21] you can't walk with god and the world at
[1:13:23] the same time
[1:13:24] you can love god and mammon at the same
[1:13:27] time but the man said what we need today
[1:13:29] is not more organization more
[1:13:31] memberships but we need a church
[1:13:33] cleaning from the pulpit to the janitor
[1:13:36] and a good old-fashioned saint paul's
[1:13:38] revival and the bible holy ghost and the
[1:13:41] people back walking in god's provided
[1:13:43] way god has a provided way let's walk in
[1:13:46] it
[1:13:48] can the church say amen
[1:13:50] what are we doing this morning
[1:13:52] contending for that faith that has been
[1:13:54] restored by malachi 4.
[1:14:00] in the message the evil messenger bring
[1:14:02] back the church to the word now what is
[1:14:04] this messenger of malachi fought to do
[1:14:06] respawn back the original fate the
[1:14:09] resurrection fate that they see jesus
[1:14:12] after he raised from the dead seen him
[1:14:14] working among them
[1:14:17] so that's what we are looking for to see
[1:14:18] jesus working among us
[1:14:20] healing the sick saving the sinner
[1:14:23] pouring out the holy ghost confirming
[1:14:25] the word with signs oneness and miracles
[1:14:30] can the church say man
[1:14:33] so every trial every test every
[1:14:35] situation you have is here to build that
[1:14:37] experience so you could have faith and
[1:14:39] that faith has to keep growing david had
[1:14:41] faith based on the lion and the bear
[1:14:45] so when goliath came up
[1:14:47] he had the faith to deal with goliath
[1:14:49] because he knew god took him to the lion
[1:14:51] and the bear
[1:14:52] so you have to look at your trials and
[1:14:54] testings from a different perspective to
[1:14:56] see it as an opportunity for god to
[1:14:57] build your fate with your target being
[1:14:59] rapture and fate
[1:15:01] perfect fate so that you can leave this
[1:15:03] place can the church say amen
[1:15:08] i'm about to begin to wind down now
[1:15:10] hallelujah it takes fate
[1:15:13] to do the impossible
[1:15:14] it takes faith to push back the demons
[1:15:18] it takes faith and the bible said
[1:15:20] without failures is impossible to please
[1:15:22] god there are people sitting in church
[1:15:24] and they don't have faith
[1:15:28] they read the bible and they don't have
[1:15:30] faith some leave their hands and they
[1:15:32] still don't have faith
[1:15:33] but without faith it's impossible
[1:15:36] to please god
[1:15:38] in the book of mark chapter 2
[1:15:43] here it is
[1:15:45] jesus has a
[1:15:47] contention
[1:15:49] with
[1:15:50] the pharisees
[1:15:53] and it became the past that and it came
[1:15:55] to pass in in mark chapter 2 verse 2 and
[1:15:57] it came to pass that he went through the
[1:15:59] corn field on the sabbath day and the
[1:16:00] disciples began as they went to pluck
[1:16:02] the ears of corn
[1:16:04] and the pharisees said unto him behold
[1:16:06] why do they on the sabbath day
[1:16:09] do that which is not lawful
[1:16:13] you see the fellows believed on the way
[1:16:14] there
[1:16:16] why on the sabbath day they're picking
[1:16:18] corn when they're not supposed to do
[1:16:19] that in somebody
[1:16:21] and i love jesus response jesus say
[1:16:22] oliver is so ignorant
[1:16:25] jesus says to them
[1:16:27] have you never read
[1:16:30] if you want to bring the law to me have
[1:16:32] you never read and and now more than
[1:16:35] ever as i see the word unfolding but
[1:16:39] have you never read what the prophet
[1:16:46] said before you go around saying things
[1:16:49] have you have you ever read so jesus was
[1:16:51] i left jesus class with it you know
[1:16:54] amen now listen the problem they had it
[1:16:56] wasn't a problem with him you know they
[1:16:57] probably was with the disciples they
[1:16:59] really should have gone to the disciples
[1:17:01] and said oh they shouldn't do this but
[1:17:02] he said to come to jesus christ they're
[1:17:03] looking for issue with jesus
[1:17:05] jesus how we can let your disciples pick
[1:17:07] corn
[1:17:08] when is his sabbath day
[1:17:10] and jesus say have you never read
[1:17:19] listen to jesus have you ever read what
[1:17:21] david did when he had need and was a
[1:17:23] hunger
[1:17:24] he and data were with him
[1:17:27] how he went into the house of god in the
[1:17:29] days of abithiya the high priest and
[1:17:31] they'd eat the shoe bread
[1:17:32] which is unlawful to eat but the priests
[1:17:35] and give all to them that were with him
[1:17:37] and he said unto them the sabbath was
[1:17:39] made for man and none man for the
[1:17:40] sabbath
[1:17:41] therefore the son of man is lord also of
[1:17:44] the sabbath
[1:17:46] but that's a background for the
[1:17:47] situation i'm trying to get to that's
[1:17:49] that that's not the real issue you know
[1:17:51] after jesus deals with that he goes to
[1:17:53] mark chapter three
[1:17:55] and jesus the bible says entered again
[1:17:58] into the synagogue and there was a man
[1:18:00] there with a withered hand
[1:18:03] and listen and they the pharisees watch
[1:18:06] him
[1:18:07] whether he would heal him on the sabbath
[1:18:12] that they might accuse him
[1:18:16] so clearly what jesus said to them in
[1:18:18] mark chapter two the message did not hit
[1:18:20] home
[1:18:29] and i want to speak in this as i get
[1:18:30] ready i'm losing my voice i want to
[1:18:31] speak as i get ready to close out here
[1:18:33] because
[1:18:34] this here is this real story of fate
[1:18:37] as you read jesus's miracles jesus heals
[1:18:40] the sick he
[1:18:41] does a blinder he does different things
[1:18:43] he he tell them go their daughters well
[1:18:45] but this situation is is different
[1:18:48] here you have a man in the synagogue
[1:18:50] he's in the church he's not in the world
[1:18:52] he's in the church
[1:18:54] and he has a withered hand
[1:18:58] he can't lift his under worship
[1:19:01] he can't reach for anything
[1:19:03] he can clap he can't hold a microphone
[1:19:06] he has a withered hand
[1:19:08] his hand his feet are not withered
[1:19:11] so he can walk around but when he
[1:19:13] reaches what he needs to do he can do
[1:19:14] nothing about it amen because his hand
[1:19:17] is with it amen his eyes are not
[1:19:19] withered so he could see things but he
[1:19:21] can't touch it
[1:19:23] because
[1:19:25] his hand is withered
[1:19:27] his mind is not withered so he could
[1:19:29] hear things and he could understand
[1:19:31] things but he can't touch the concepts
[1:19:33] of what his mind prepares because
[1:19:37] his hand is
[1:19:39] with it
[1:19:40] he would look around the church in the
[1:19:41] synagogue and see people with their
[1:19:43] normal hands and he would know what to
[1:19:45] do but he can do it because his
[1:19:48] hand is with it
[1:19:51] and the pharisees knew that this man was
[1:19:53] in the church with his withered hand and
[1:19:54] they're watching jesus because they know
[1:19:56] jesus has a tendency to heal people
[1:20:02] somehow when jesus gets in a room with
[1:20:04] sick people
[1:20:06] his nature is to heal them
[1:20:13] so there is the wizard man
[1:20:15] the man with the withered hand and there
[1:20:17] is jesus and there's the pharisees
[1:20:18] looking on looking to see
[1:20:20] if jesus would heal him on the sabbath
[1:20:22] day so they could accuse him
[1:20:25] they have the accusation papers already
[1:20:27] written up
[1:20:29] just waiting for the stamp the signature
[1:20:31] to say you are guilty
[1:20:36] and when you read the bible and and i
[1:20:38] share this on wednesday when god speaks
[1:20:40] he can take back his own word because he
[1:20:42] speaks
[1:20:44] and the word cannot return void to when
[1:20:45] god pronounced judgment
[1:20:47] now this is powerful when god pronounced
[1:20:49] judgment he can't even take it back so
[1:20:51] he makes a way of escape
[1:20:53] so jesus in his wisdom understand the
[1:20:55] setup
[1:20:56] that's why the bible says we are
[1:20:57] ignorant of satan's devices
[1:20:59] and this is the power of fate here this
[1:21:01] is one of the only times in scripture
[1:21:03] where jesus doesn't say you are healed
[1:21:05] go that way jesus looks at the man and
[1:21:08] says stretch out your hand
[1:21:17] in other words there are some things a
[1:21:20] man with a weird hand is not supposed to
[1:21:22] be able to do
[1:21:24] but i want you to reach into some feet
[1:21:27] and stretch out your hand
[1:21:31] he didn't tell you are he he said just
[1:21:33] stretch and there's some people here
[1:21:35] this morning you just
[1:21:43] the word is anyone only need to do is
[1:22:00] hallelujah you may be seated
[1:22:02] i hope this helps somebody because there
[1:22:04] are people in here sitting down with
[1:22:07] withered hands
[1:22:14] withered finances
[1:22:16] children with it
[1:22:18] life withered
[1:22:19] joy withered
[1:22:21] peace of mind with it and they're
[1:22:23] sitting in the synagogue
[1:22:24] looking for jesus and the devil is there
[1:22:27] saying how could you do this on such a
[1:22:29] day because today is not the day to heal
[1:22:31] them but god is saying this morning
[1:22:33] stretch out your hand
[1:22:36] and there's something else about this
[1:22:38] situation that's powerful when your hand
[1:22:40] gets withered or crippled your bone
[1:22:42] density begins to decline
[1:22:44] so it means over time the bible doesn't
[1:22:46] tell us how long his hand was with it
[1:22:47] but he really would never had full bone
[1:22:49] function
[1:22:50] the substance of his hand was missing
[1:22:53] but fate is the substance
[1:22:57] and standing in front of this man was
[1:22:59] defeat
[1:23:00] these substance itself
[1:23:02] as this man was stretching out his hand
[1:23:05] see it as the substance
[1:23:09] of what we hope for
[1:23:11] the evidence of what we cannot see
[1:23:26] can the church say amen
[1:23:28] isn't there joy from reading the
[1:23:30] scriptures
[1:23:31] reading the prophet listen in a time
[1:23:33] when ministers preaching ideas and
[1:23:35] conclusions and dreams and visions and
[1:23:36] nightmares
[1:23:38] we have scriptures
[1:23:40] and quotes from the prophet to keep us
[1:23:42] well fed
[1:23:44] keeps us fat and sassy knowing that our
[1:23:47] god is a god
[1:23:48] mike i feel like david my cop running
[1:23:50] over
[1:23:51] holy goodness and mercy shall follow me
[1:23:54] all the taste of my life
[1:24:08] i'm not going to be much longer this is
[1:24:09] my closing message for this year so
[1:24:12] everything i had felt penned up for
[1:24:29] the holy ghost must pour out we must
[1:24:31] have dynamics we must have a super
[1:24:33] church a super race as we near the
[1:24:36] headstone
[1:24:39] and your family is going to be delivered
[1:24:41] your son is coming back your daughter is
[1:24:43] coming back your loved one is coming
[1:24:45] back the same god who wrote the word is
[1:24:48] able to bring it to pass
[1:24:51] because we are preaching the restored
[1:24:53] faith this morning
[1:25:06] so that man faith made him hold
[1:25:08] and i love it
[1:25:09] the pharisees couldn't accuse him verse
[1:25:11] sixes and the pharisees went forth and
[1:25:13] straight away took counsel with the
[1:25:14] herodians against him how they might
[1:25:16] destroy it
[1:25:19] because jesus yes
[1:25:23] you can trap jesus it's only when jesus
[1:25:27] said his time is ready to be trapped and
[1:25:28] that you could trap him
[1:25:30] and even tell him was a setup because if
[1:25:32] the devil only knew he was going to rise
[1:25:34] again he said send security to keep him
[1:25:36] alive
[1:25:36] so when they came home jesus said my
[1:25:38] always not come don't worry they can't
[1:25:40] touch me yet but he said when the time
[1:25:41] is coming second latest life down
[1:25:45] and i can pick it up again
[1:25:47] and when i pick it up i'm picking it up
[1:25:49] because i want to deliver the fate
[1:25:52] because the same works i do
[1:25:54] you're gonna do also i'm greater than i
[1:25:57] do because i go unto my father but i'm
[1:25:59] not gonna leave you comfortless i will
[1:26:02] come to you as a prophet malachi 4. i'll
[1:26:04] come to you as the holy spirit i'll come
[1:26:07] to you as faith virtue knowledge
[1:26:09] temperance patience holiness probably
[1:26:11] kindness charity
[1:26:18] you may be seated
[1:26:20] i'm beginning to close out musicians and
[1:26:21] get ready
[1:26:24] for my message condemnation my
[1:26:25] representation
[1:26:27] but the brandon said father this is a
[1:26:29] prayer
[1:26:31] so is it now at the near coming of jesus
[1:26:33] again just like the vine
[1:26:35] he said if the vine puts forth a branch
[1:26:38] and that branch was a pentecostal branch
[1:26:40] filled with the holy oats and signs and
[1:26:42] wonders of fruits follow that branch if
[1:26:45] that vine ever puts another branch it'll
[1:26:47] be the same kind of branch
[1:26:49] we know that father by nature itself and
[1:26:52] we do know that you can graft any fruit
[1:26:55] that's pertaining to that into that vine
[1:26:57] and it will live by the vine and we know
[1:26:59] that you can take an orange tree and
[1:27:02] grow citrus fruits of different kinds
[1:27:04] seven or eight we can put lemons in it
[1:27:06] it'll go right in because it's a citrus
[1:27:08] fruit it'll grow grapefruit and many
[1:27:10] other tangerines and many other citrus
[1:27:12] fruits but if that tree
[1:27:15] bring forth its own branch again it will
[1:27:18] be an orange lord it will be like the
[1:27:20] first one was and we believe that there
[1:27:22] is to be a church in these last days
[1:27:25] that will receive both former and latter
[1:27:27] rain
[1:27:28] it will be scattered throughout the
[1:27:29] world in this layout see an age it'll be
[1:27:32] a church that's called back to the
[1:27:34] original feat in god
[1:27:36] it'll be a church and have jesus christ
[1:27:39] walking in it manifesting himself the
[1:27:41] shout of the king will be in it
[1:27:44] can the church say amen i'm getting
[1:27:46] ready to close out
[1:27:47] hallelujah give the lord a shout of
[1:27:49] praise
[1:27:55] hallelujah hallelujah and i truly
[1:27:58] believe this is our time now
[1:28:00] and we know seven thunders get fit
[1:28:03] and i believe this is
[1:28:04] we are in our 41st year
[1:28:09] 41st year because september 20th 1974
[1:28:11] the revelation of the seven is broke
[1:28:15] and there's something about the number
[1:28:17] 41.
[1:28:18] so from some decept from september 20th
[1:28:21] 1974 to september 20 2014 we broke into
[1:28:25] the 41st year
[1:28:27] in the days of noah it rained for 40
[1:28:29] days 40 nights but on the 41st day it
[1:28:32] was over
[1:28:35] the children of israel walked around the
[1:28:36] wilderness for 40 years
[1:28:38] but in the 41st year they went in
[1:28:42] jesus was in the wilderness for 40 days
[1:28:45] but on the 41st day he returned in the
[1:28:48] power of the spirit
[1:28:50] and for 40 years from september 1974 to
[1:28:53] this year
[1:28:55] we have now broken into the 41st year
[1:28:58] brother
[1:28:59] you have no idea
[1:29:01] what god is about to do
[1:29:03] the power of the church is about to rise
[1:29:06] is that why we could call for a seventh
[1:29:08] time the revival convention next year
[1:29:11] looking for the manifestation of those
[1:29:13] seven thundering voices to that group
[1:29:16] who could take the word and hand it here
[1:29:19] brother you should be rejoicing let us
[1:29:21] stand our feet this morning oh glory
[1:29:25] glory glory glory
[1:29:33] hallelujah
[1:29:37] in the message jehovah jaira and there's
[1:29:38] about three quotes and we close out but
[1:29:41] ibrahim said but we're still waiting for
[1:29:43] that something
[1:29:44] hallelujah we are still waiting but
[1:29:46] that's something that's going to take
[1:29:47] the fate
[1:29:48] that's something that's what i'm looking
[1:29:50] for but terry that's something that'll
[1:29:52] take the fate and restore the fate of
[1:29:54] the children back to the original
[1:29:56] pentecostal tree
[1:29:58] that the cankerworm eat up the roman
[1:30:00] kangaroom caterpillar all the
[1:30:02] denominations increased eaten down god
[1:30:04] said i will restore it again in the last
[1:30:07] days and it will be restored listen god
[1:30:10] shall send the holy ghost
[1:30:12] in such a way
[1:30:14] upon planted wood that will restore
[1:30:19] hallelujah he didn't say i may send it
[1:30:22] he said god shall send
[1:30:24] the holy ghost in such a way upon
[1:30:27] planted word and i believe we have
[1:30:30] received planted word the true word of
[1:30:33] god
[1:30:34] spiritual food and now we are waiting
[1:30:36] for the holy ghost itself to drop down
[1:30:41] hallelujah
[1:30:44] hallelujah
[1:30:46] hallelujah how do you feel church
[1:30:49] you feel it coming on do you see the
[1:30:51] clouds getting ready to form because the
[1:30:53] rain is about to fall listen in the
[1:30:55] restoration of the bright tree but
[1:30:57] ibrahim said now that tree that joel
[1:30:59] spoke about here see it cannot die
[1:31:03] the worms eat it down but it couldn't
[1:31:05] die
[1:31:06] because in its root it had the
[1:31:08] predestinated truth
[1:31:10] and you cannot die you might be dried up
[1:31:13] this morning you might have no leaves
[1:31:15] this morning you might have no branches
[1:31:17] this morning you might have no park this
[1:31:19] morning it might look as if there's no
[1:31:21] life this morning but deep down in the
[1:31:23] roots the part that nobody could see
[1:31:26] sister maryland nobody could see it but
[1:31:28] down inside of there there's a
[1:31:30] predestination seed that kept you coming
[1:31:33] for this whole year it kept you alive
[1:31:36] and god is saying i am going to restore
[1:31:39] that original fate
[1:31:41] back to you i'm going to give you the
[1:31:43] same signs the same wonders the same
[1:31:46] power
[1:31:48] but ibrahim said all the bugs can never
[1:31:51] stop up no communism nothing will stop
[1:31:54] it i will restore say it to lord there
[1:31:57] will be an easter so nothing could stop
[1:32:00] you you could even miss this service if
[1:32:02] you wanted to something called you
[1:32:04] something pulled you something pulled
[1:32:06] you but now the holy ghost is here
[1:32:11] give the lord a sound of praise to give
[1:32:14] us faith for divine healing fit for the
[1:32:17] holy ghost fit for your family fit for
[1:32:20] the rapture i feel pentecostal this
[1:32:23] morning i'm looking for that sin killing
[1:32:26] sky blue holy ghost all pouring to pour
[1:32:29] the lip

[1:32:55] pour out the holy ghost upon planted
[1:32:58] word and you are going to bring forth
