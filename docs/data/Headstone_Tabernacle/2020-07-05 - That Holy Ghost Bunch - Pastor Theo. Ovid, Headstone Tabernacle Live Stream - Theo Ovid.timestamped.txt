[20:19] 20 verse 19 then the same day at evening
[20:27] being the first of the week when the
[20:29] doors were shut where the disciples were
[20:32] assembled for fear the Jews came Jesus
[20:35] stood in the midst and said unto them
[20:38] peace be unto you notice they were
[20:40] assembled for fear of the Jews he said
[20:43] peace be unto your wedding yet so said
[20:44] he shown unto them his hands his side
[20:47] then what the disciples glad when they
[20:49] saw the Lord
[20:50] then said Jesus to them peace be unto
[20:52] you as my father hath sent me even so
[20:56] send I you and he and and when he had
[20:59] said this he breathed on them and said

[38:34] it doesn't new like a didn't Christ
[38:35] because that was his purpose of coming
[38:38] here we go
[38:40] his purpose coming was to bring caught a
[38:43] man and make God and man one or glory of
[38:47] God his purpose was to bring God to man
[38:50] and the word was the conduit to get God
[38:53] to man or glory to God oh my god you
[38:58] have to run to a truth or glory to God
[39:01] the only way he could bring back the man
[39:03] what's the lid on a platform of the way
[39:06] [Applause]
[39:09] [Music]
[39:10] when the government or a country have to
[39:13] get good someone placed an X and there
[39:16] is no access they have to make a road
[39:18] you wrote is you weak hallelujah to
[39:22] bring goods from one part of the country
[39:23] to another quantity country that is the
[39:26] work
[39:26] oh praise God other nutus is maybe
[39:29] cutter put and pelty bread or pallidus
[39:31] and tell you this over some kind of
[39:32] thing as far as I could go but if you
[39:34] want to transport this here to make a
[39:35] rule you have to make a way so God had
[39:38] to make a we a platform to get his
[39:41] spirit to float on because it was so
[39:43] messy
[39:44] Oh glory to God so God sent the word and
[39:47] the world become the conductor of the
[39:49] Spirit so go I have some plumbing to
[39:51] doing some electrical connections to
[39:54] connect upon my ass because man gets so
[39:56] disconnected and disjointed he was
[39:59] disconnected on the power source so when
[40:01] you're looking for geesh from the power
[40:02] source that work him lines cut it's just
[40:06] that my son blackness he's like the
[40:08] flick on a light there is no light just
[40:10] the tactus of sin and sickness but jesus
[40:13] come with some connections jesus
[40:15] cumbersome equipment and when he set it
[40:18] up and put up the main source because
[40:20] i'm i touch in matthew 10 and showed him
[40:23] how it has work he anointed men but the
[40:26] same spirit does for them power does
[40:29] work even Childress and all know how
[40:31] that's work because ever touched no
[40:33] Devils there was healing the sick and it
[40:36] was the even converted yet but he was
[40:38] demonstrating this thing does really
[40:40] work this power come from another source
[40:43] my kingdom is not of this world my
[40:46] kingdom a natural kingdom also to see me
[40:50] with your natural ports don't try to
[40:52] give me your natural ports
[40:54] don't try to give me your natural words
[40:56] or give the Lord a shout the nose
[41:00] his kingdom was of a high order
[41:06] don't nobody cuz if I got Kingdom
[41:09] Kingdom and church is not the same thing
[41:14] there's an order show let me say it
[41:17] again King on my church it's not the
[41:20] same thing after three and a half years
[41:34] with Jesus
[41:35] these brothers were faithful these
[41:40] possible shook up say if you're fearful
[41:42] and shook up days all right
[41:44] your brother welcome brother but it does
[41:49] get faithful and shook up do you know
[41:52] the play breathe you rapid Superman you
[41:55] have a play I can know anybody don't
[41:57] know because my people blast away but
[42:00] this devil we have to face
[42:01] he ain't taken up blood that demon said
[42:07] Paul I know you can't Bluff this thing
[42:10] this I know you can't Bluff this thing
[42:13] who are you impersonating the sting
[42:17] there will be no inclination to the
[42:20] stipple thing or give the Lord a shout
[42:24] in person is every other thing but not
[42:26] this thing what this pie will have there
[42:29] is no impersonations to it so you have
[42:37] to want to know what can a bunch you

[55:42] religious and go to church be a member
[55:44] there of and they can't go on to a
[55:46] Sunday sermon amen now God promises in
[55:50] this these what he was going to do and I
[55:54] would like to ask anybody any minister
[55:56] any way of one promise that God made the
[55:58] change and what he said that they were
[56:01] to but what the three church is doing it
[56:02] now but it want it they don't want it
[56:06] here Harris would Jesus brought go to
[56:10] human lives God was made human when
[56:16] Jesus was born God became man that he
[56:20] might become fellowship with man and in
[56:24] man to achieve one purpose just one
[56:28] purpose that is to bring to man
[56:32] what God is not what a church is
[56:40] so when you see people succumb to this
[56:42] just because it's just habit you know
[56:44] that that Alaia talking they're the past
[56:48] align the people like is buncha liars

[56:57] object is to bring God to man to bring a
[57:05] man to what God is how he lives his
[57:10] nature his being all about him and
[57:15] that's why I said at the finishing of
[57:16] the seventh seal we supposed to be all
[57:19] the way of the eternal who God is how he
[57:22] lives his nature his being by that time
[57:27] you come like a next kinda Adam because
[57:30] you coming into communion with God or

[57:40] connecting line and the dial tone on his
[57:42] phone went dead after being in sin there
[57:45] was no way he could commune to God so
[57:48] God as I put the blood substitute until
[57:50] Jesus come to reconnect them back to
[57:52] heaven on the cross was the reconnection
[57:56] to bring back a day is a direct direct
[58:00] line and to prove the line was direct
[58:03] when Jesus died you rip the veil of the
[58:05] temple from the top to the bottom to
[58:07] expose what was hidden all along only
[58:11] high priests could go inside adhere only
[58:14] man I've got to go inside earlier when

[1:03:53] branham what is the difference when
[1:03:56] Jesus breathed on the disciples and said
[1:03:58] receive ye the Holy Ghost and when they

[1:04:17] promise to give them he breathed upon
[1:04:19] them his promise said receive the Holy
[1:04:20] Ghost it was a promise here we go and
[1:04:23] they went to the upper room to wait for

[1:06:20] the Olympic never have to go through
[1:06:22] training and qualification tests because
[1:06:26] you want the very best because they are
[1:06:35] competing lot but people are crazy and

[1:06:39] only people who this is the life if the
[1:06:43] instrument is tremendous then doing this
[1:06:44] the doing this that but this has come
[1:06:46] like the life they are dedicated to it
[1:06:48] because they want to represent the
[1:06:50] country well God won't have
[1:06:53] representative of his kingdom
[1:06:56] people have represent where they come
[1:06:59] from
[1:07:01] and to do that he had to get the very
[1:07:02] best and some of the best wasn't dead in
[1:07:10] mud in filth in sin in all kind of
[1:07:14] condition but they were his best
[1:07:16] I mean mind them bum them out and then
[1:07:21] he's had a clean mo because this is his
[1:07:24] best Satan was deceived by how they were
[1:07:27] in a mess but this was God's best toe be
[1:07:32] fooled by the mess you are not like the
[1:07:35] rest
[1:07:36] you are God's best he leave the best for
[1:07:40] last so he leaves you for the last days
[1:07:43] or chlorine of caught you I could have
[1:07:46] the victory you are going to overcome
[1:07:48] you appointed Brett oh you are going to
[1:07:51] be filled with God my lord my lord
[1:08:01] [Applause]
[1:08:08] Boris let's continue the Holy Ghost the
[1:08:14] Holy Spirit is an experience of being
[1:08:17] filled and enduring power for service
[1:08:23] power for what for service so for us to
[1:08:27] get into true service we have to be
[1:08:30] empowered by God and Jesus said you
[1:08:34] shall receive power after not winter
[1:08:39] come upon you not Wesley come upon you
[1:08:41] not the Pentecostal baptism come upon
[1:08:44] you but after the Holy Ghost comes upon
[1:08:47] you and you go be witnesses unto me not
[1:08:51] under a church not unto our system not
[1:08:54] until a group but unto the Messiah
[1:08:57] even the seventh seal you shall be
[1:08:59] witnesses unto me the witness shall be
[1:09:02] inside and manifested outside okay the
[1:09:07] Lord a shout Jesus was God's witness as
[1:09:11] long as they have him with them they
[1:09:13] were fine because they had God witness
[1:09:16] with them
[1:09:16] but the prophecy hanging over them was
[1:09:19] for this witness to come into them so
[1:09:21] when Peter receive the Holy Ghost he
[1:09:23] know how to witness in him as my father
[1:09:27] sent me jesus said so send I you
[1:09:30] it was a promise breathing on them the
[1:09:33] father had sent him went in him so to
[1:09:35] send them guys out he had to go into
[1:09:37] them and then learning of the word
[1:09:39] didn't do it the teaching of the word
[1:09:41] didn't do it they explained in the world
[1:09:44] and they understanding didn't do it it
[1:09:46] was the fire it was the Holy Ghost it
[1:09:49] was caught on mighty that came and
[1:09:51] jumped on in their socket of their souls
[1:09:54] that's history so what's the point in
[1:09:59] trying to see how this one teaching so
[1:10:02] right and this one teaching and teaching
[1:10:04] my teacher where is a God of the teacher
[1:10:06] God wrap up the teachings and put life
[1:10:10] inside of it
[1:10:11] he put life and Pisan in sanctification
[1:10:14] but life and hottest and justification
[1:10:16] but life and hydrogen reduction of the
[1:10:19] world but the thing is that get to the
[1:10:21] life
[1:10:21] Oh glory to God hallelujah you know long
[1:10:25] time with parents when a game met
[1:10:27] somewhere they do the highs in something
[1:10:30] when you're drinking they get the whole
[1:10:32] thing to go if you get our message
[1:10:36] straight Oh bitter boy complain about
[1:10:40] this and complain about that but that is
[1:10:42] what good for you Oh hallelujah so go
[1:10:44] ahead app it up and hide it and slip it
[1:10:47] in Satan's Kingdom you take Jesus unroll
[1:10:50] em also who Jesus is a baby
[1:10:57] no no that is 12 years already cut for
[1:11:00] them fellas early in the priesthood no
[1:11:03] you're not about my father's business
[1:11:05] 18 years silence inulin church seen them
[1:11:07] given wrong teachings false doctrines
[1:11:10] and wrong interpretations and s saying
[1:11:11] that that is temperance but that is I
[1:11:14] just really a nobody and somebody might
[1:11:18] be its it you see it wrong you caught
[1:11:19] your own scripture not Jesus 18 years
[1:11:23] season watching everybody is same way
[1:11:27] Jesus when the day come somebody wants a
[1:11:31] my to read for us this summer day Jesus
[1:11:34] put his hands up like that first time
[1:11:37] Jesus coming forward to read and he find
[1:11:40] his cool of eyes I wasn't like a Bible
[1:11:41] like this and you gotta find his school
[1:11:42] of Isaiah in the FATA chapter they got a
[1:11:44] big school open it's cruel fine guys see
[1:11:48] the Spirit of the Lord is upon me
[1:11:50] this is young Jesus looking for you
[1:11:53] don't know let me to preach the gospel
[1:11:54] open the eyes of the blind and set at
[1:11:57] liberty them that are bruised
[1:12:00] Hollis's and depreciates terribly of the
[1:12:03] Lord and I can see him banner and kiss
[1:12:05] the book roll the book I said this day
[1:12:13] the scripture is fulfilled in your ears
[1:12:18] they thought he was reading a text but
[1:12:23] he was the express text
[1:12:25] he was the text expressed he was the
[1:12:29] text made flesh he was the living text
[1:12:32] he was the laws literally but fresh on
[1:12:37] it
[1:12:39] [Applause]
[1:12:41] ah
[1:12:44] whoa my god and I keep saying it over
[1:12:49] and over I don't know how much even
[1:12:50] catch it but it's something that I love
[1:12:52] what he said he said he told a search
[1:12:54] the Scriptures for in them you think you
[1:12:58] have eternal life what is he saying to
[1:13:00] them says the text because you think
[1:13:03] because you listened to the text because
[1:13:06] you could say that the text because you
[1:13:09] could speak the text you have to the
[1:13:10] life he said but detects testify of me
[1:13:14] [Applause]
[1:13:16] so the text is not dead just to talk
[1:13:19] the text is to identify a prophecy and I
[1:13:23] am the fulfillment of the prophecy of
[1:13:25] the text but then he went further he
[1:13:29] said you wouldn't come to me that you
[1:13:31] might have life so he was showing life
[1:13:34] is not in the letter life is in a person
[1:13:38] [Music]
[1:13:39] get the Lord a show that's why he
[1:13:47] doesn't know so much of books and tapes
[1:13:49] and everything can be so miserable
[1:13:50] because life is nothing the text
[1:13:53] life isn't a person the person of Jesus
[1:13:56] Christ or do you catch it do you see it
[1:14:01] then you have to leave and go to him to
[1:14:03] get life I am the way I am the truth and
[1:14:08] I am the life itself he came unto his
[1:14:15] own his own received him not but as many
[1:14:18] as received him to tell me get power to
[1:14:21] become the sons of God you have to get
[1:14:23] power to become part that Holy Ghost
[1:14:26] Bunch wow I have to strike you power as
[1:14:28] the hitch you got to want an experience
[1:14:31] with God
[1:14:36] so the text supposed to inspire a pest
[1:14:40] in your heart to the Living God and
[1:14:44] David said it is me as a hot pant after
[1:14:46] the water Brooks so my shawl passed

[1:15:17] will just see the Living God taught is a
[1:15:19] reality
[1:15:23] [Applause]
[1:15:26] [Music]
[1:15:31] the Holy Spirit is an experience of
[1:15:35] being fulfilled and Intuit power for
[1:15:39] service but confession and receive in
[1:15:43] Christ is to have faith and make your
[1:15:45] confession and feel free that goddess

[1:15:59] one thing but this whole evil thing is
[1:16:02] power power to pray power to overcome
[1:16:06] father say I am sorry pardon sir please
[1:16:09] forgive me power to take wrong power to
[1:16:14] humble yourself little Brahm says could
[1:16:28] we continual video he said will you be
[1:16:30] glad and thank him for taking your sins
[1:16:32] you believe you did it
[1:16:34] just raise up your hand let's say I
[1:16:36] believe he takes my sins it takes my

[1:16:59] Christian baptism I know I'll period
[1:17:01] speak these words before they was
[1:17:03] baptized right either speak these words
[1:17:04] the Holy Ghost fell upon them how much
[1:17:09] you don't hear much about that the Holy
[1:17:10] Ghost fell we're not gonna preach a big
[1:17:12] no revelation Holy Ghost or glory to God
[1:17:17] why question I'm still reading they were
[1:17:20] all under expectation so how could the
[1:17:23] Holy Ghost fall and you're not under
[1:17:25] expectation and how could you be under
[1:17:28] expectation if we don't preach the
[1:17:30] expectation for you to expect
[1:17:32] does that sound complicated if we don't

[1:17:38] if you have to serve your watermelon
[1:17:40] this morning and you have to be
[1:17:41] expecting watermelon after preach

[1:18:08] you have to be on the expectation faith
[1:18:10] that every piece you won't be preaching
[1:18:12] go glory to God Brahm says they were all
[1:18:15] an expectation no you are under

[1:22:11] he went to countenance houses power his
[1:22:13] power he didn't know listen he never
[1:22:15] meant the Gentiles before you know God
[1:22:16] as a gift bit of vision to go to
[1:22:18] Cornelius house Cornelius under vision
[1:22:20] expectant Peter God working on both
[1:22:23] sides that man don't know fully what to
[1:22:25] do this is a whole new moon for him he
[1:22:28] never experienced this before he began
[1:22:30] to testify about the Lord and why pizza
[1:22:32] was speaking the word the Holy Ghost
[1:22:35] these people never came to a service
[1:22:38] that never get baptized but the Holy
[1:22:39] Ghost because the man heart he was just
[1:22:42] and default but the Holy Ghost was watch
[1:22:45] what you have in your heart let me give
[1:22:49] the Lord a shout all my doctrine this
[1:22:52] man was taught how much mysteries I
[1:22:57] think he had how much revelation and
[1:23:00] Bach until she listened to none Peter
[1:23:04] was the living book
[1:23:11] Peter had the book DITA Hockley Aslam
[1:23:20] [Music]
[1:23:22] and his name was activated by the spirit
[1:23:27] coming through the word oh why Peter
[1:23:34] speak these words the Holy Ghost owner
[1:23:38] can do it the Holy Ghost sort of pipe
[1:23:41] and the Holy Ghost rip down to the pipe
[1:23:44] of the word and touch the gene the gym
[1:23:49] in Cornelius and corniness become
[1:23:53] activated son that'll be the said the
[1:24:01] same God that poured out upon the Jews
[1:24:03] his dough come to the Gentiles it is the
[1:24:07] same God the same reality the same
[1:24:10] experience Cornelison walk with Jesus
[1:24:13] two and a half years corners in the air
[1:24:15] Jesus teaching calling us via testimony
[1:24:18] of a man that was activated by God with
[1:24:21] the full-si germ in his body
[1:24:27] [Applause]
[1:24:49] let me see said so after the Apollo
[1:24:55] experience God only using these men but
[1:24:59] the full gym so now you understand where
[1:25:03] I'm the Philip he in the revival but a
[1:25:07] man Hanafy OPI he gettin away he and a
[1:25:11] chariot miles away reading scripture
[1:25:14] because he's burdened and the word is a
[1:25:17] conduct of the Spirit so he's reading
[1:25:20] written text and he don't have an avenue
[1:25:23] for the text to be open for the spirit
[1:25:25] to come in so once the word open is to
[1:25:31] open up a channel I won't forget this do
[1:25:34] I ever forget this once the word open is
[1:25:36] to make a channel for the spirit to come
[1:25:38] in so Philip was translated from the way
[1:25:42] he was to the mind is it understandest
[1:25:45] with no readers and when he brought the
[1:25:48] word to him the spirit and he all state
[1:25:53] GOP up he going to appear not with a
[1:25:58] bunch of books and tapes but fire fire
[1:26:02] the same core that Philip had this man
[1:26:06] huh you're gonna teach you he go to
[1:26:09] printing they remembers me to open up
[1:26:12] the word just get the spirit in
[1:26:22] is that no cellphone in that time it
[1:26:25] have no human connection in the time
[1:26:26] it's just Holy Spirit connections Holy
[1:26:30] Spirit translations Holy Spirit's
[1:26:33] anointed Holy Spirit directed that's why
[1:26:36] his bogus it is nonsensical for any man
[1:26:39] to try the guide the bride leader bride
[1:26:42] be in charge of the bride that mean up
[1:26:45] land money in a punch in his mode
[1:26:47] doesn't think that his head a brain a
[1:26:49] brain punch just even think that because
[1:26:52] the ax the book of Acts was the acts of
[1:26:54] the Holy Ghost and all those brothers
[1:26:57] were guided by the Holy Ghost all those
[1:27:00] buttons did by the Holy Ghost led them
[1:27:01] to do or glory of stealin full of the
[1:27:05] Holy Ghost he was a deacon he's preached
[1:27:07] to them and busted them and stone him
[1:27:09] and before he died he said no evil a
[1:27:11] latest one day they'll charge get him a
[1:27:14] discount not this one that others data

[1:31:58] oh and I said Holmes just you know God
[1:32:01] is going to restore by shining forth the
[1:32:03] evening light to restore the whole wood
[1:32:05] of God again watch the full
[1:32:08] manifestation of Christ in His Church
[1:32:11] but hungry if we see that MacArthur
[1:32:15] proceedures he said look how he said is
[1:32:17] here Gorgon restore the full wood of God
[1:32:21] again let me translate it that the full
[1:32:25] manifestation of Christ in his wood and
[1:32:28] it's Church so see full world is not
[1:32:31] full text full word is full word that it
[1:32:36] would become a contribute for full
[1:32:38] spirit to come because the world was
[1:32:41] lost to the ages he Bibles if he said he
[1:32:43] said seven angels to gather the
[1:32:45] scattered word to tie back into the
[1:32:47] world to bring down the Holy Ghost
[1:32:48] because with the fullness of the work on
[1:32:51] the fullness of the Spirit or I say this
[1:32:53] way with the restoration of the word
[1:32:55] come the restoration of the Spirit never
[1:32:58] see when wasps are digging a hole to
[1:32:59] play pipes water their small pipes and
[1:33:02] big pipes it was a major interruption
[1:33:05] which is in major pipes these huge guys
[1:33:07] because that is the pipe that shallow
[1:33:10] water into areas and then they get
[1:33:12] lesser size structure into homes and
[1:33:14] different things like that are you with
[1:33:16] me for the do the work in this last day
[1:33:20] God needed full pipe so first excellency
[1:33:26] the Lord Himself had to do this problem
[1:33:28] the Lord Himself commentor to lay down
[1:33:31] this pipe for the spirit to come because
[1:33:35] the enemy command like a flood in his
[1:33:36] last day and the Holy Spirit has the
[1:33:39] coming like a flood to raise a standard
[1:33:40] against the enemy so the Lord couldn't
[1:33:43] send them some other angels the Lord
[1:33:45] Himself descends from heaven with a
[1:33:48] shout and when Jesus cried seven
[1:33:52] thunders shorter voices oh and those
[1:33:55] Tumnus was to catch the bride execution
[1:33:58] right promise
[1:33:59] Oh glory to God so now the platform of

[1:34:19] there have the Saints in gear have the
[1:34:22] colors the rainbow in there of the life

[1:34:27] mysteries you have the rainbow you have
[1:34:30] the covenant you have the channel of God
[1:34:33] for the Spirit the flow true all the
[1:34:42] written for is the gap because that that
[1:34:47] completes the whole thing which is
[1:34:49] charity the bond of perfectness let's
[1:34:53] continue where does it tree right the

[1:44:08] dewatering spirit watch
[1:44:10] he said no there where is a lot of in
[1:44:13] common apart is then the work shall be
[1:44:15] manifested in him are the same for it is
[1:44:18] the same seed Word of God God son this
[1:44:22] is Jesus was his example seed and what
[1:44:25] his life was when the spirit poured upon
[1:44:28] him after his baptism and the Holy Ghost
[1:44:32] come upon him a watch that was Gore
[1:44:35] example seed son right when Judd
[1:44:37] baptized Jesus what came upon him a text
[1:44:40] a book a tape or the Holy Ghost the Holy
[1:44:45] was in his fullness came on Jesus and he
[1:44:49] become the unmounted Christ nor display
[1:44:52] as far as John public seen is another
[1:44:55] man get dip in water another man get
[1:44:57] baptized but that Holy Ghost on him now
[1:44:59] lead him into the wilderness the face
[1:45:02] Lucifer Lucifer never had an x-ray or
[1:45:05] led for battle until it is written it is
[1:45:11] written it is also written Jesus
[1:45:14] shopping for peace never show one
[1:45:17] display of power and all the powers on
[1:45:20] him when he kept the power that is when
[1:45:23] he went to the temple the fine
[1:45:24] description or chlorine at God so what's
[1:45:27] something now
[1:45:28] so after holiness come upon him the very
[1:45:30] life that he produced well here we go
[1:45:34] that same water in spirit of the Holy
[1:45:40] Ghost will bring forth the same kind of
[1:45:45] life doing the same thing that he did if
[1:45:49] it's the same seed
[1:45:52] so the prophecy is for the watering
[1:45:56] spirit of the Holy Ghost to come up on
[1:45:59] the seed in your life so that is why he
[1:46:02] said they call themselves on the Upper
[1:46:04] Room dry seeds
[1:46:05] what were they waitin for the water and
[1:46:07] spirit of the Holy Ghost or glory no God
[1:46:12] and that is why Jesus went to Calvary to
[1:46:16] release that water in spirit or glory to
[1:46:20] God because the badness that the Holy
[1:46:23] Ghost was not yet given because Jesus
[1:46:26] was not yet glorified or glory the cause
[1:46:29] of Jesus had to die to pay the price to
[1:46:32] release the spirit that we can become
[1:46:36] the sons of God but we are not sons
[1:46:41] because we born of this earth we are
[1:46:44] sons because of his foreknowledge
[1:46:45] because of his thinking and now the Holy
[1:46:48] Ghost coming upon you to water that seed
[1:46:51] inside of you Oh glory to god I'll close
[1:46:55] with this hallelujah hallelujah oh
[1:46:58] praise the God Oh hallelujah
[1:47:03] you loved him he said the Holy Spirit
[1:47:07] where is that kind of seed the Holy
[1:47:09] Spirit water and bring for that seed
[1:47:12] it's the water the seed if the seed is
[1:47:15] planted that's exactly what it is
[1:47:17] watered for and if the water falls on
[1:47:19] you blessed God let me tell you
[1:47:21] something preach I'm so-and-so I don't
[1:47:22] believe that stuff you were just in
[1:47:24] Naaman Arsenal your old hypocrite that's
[1:47:26] the sea that was planted
[1:47:28] he said Alma Brenham I was born of
[1:47:30] Charlie and Ella Branham that's make me
[1:47:32] a Branham because I am a seed there are
[1:47:35] two agreements with their sperm they're
[1:47:37] gonna make a seed and when God and His
[1:47:39] Word becomes one when courts spirit what
[1:47:43] is the seed of God the Word of God it
[1:47:46] produces
