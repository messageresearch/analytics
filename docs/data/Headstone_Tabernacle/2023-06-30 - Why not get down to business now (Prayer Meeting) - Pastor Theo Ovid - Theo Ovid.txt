that called the teachers wait you know if each one here tonight each one of us will wait upon the Lord I have waited on God many of the decisions we have made many of the actions we would not have done it because he will bring Direction guidance confirmation you would have you would have seen his hand more in your life a lot of things is because we haven't waited because we are free to choose and decide and act and God gave us that Liberty and based upon that Liberty we reap the fruit of our decisions we reach the fruit of our thoughts we read the fruit of our words and as we get nearer to The Headstone as we get nearer to this capping of the pyramid we need to wait upon the Lord let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we John wrote and said write on your children I write unto you young men I write unto you father it's a processes and growth from baby to child young men to fathers you want us to come into maturity you want us to come in fatherhood you want us to come that we can catch your mind for the prophet he was the eyes Lord he says there's no moving faculty past the eyes the next next is intelligence and I pray tonight your intelligence will come down and speak to us and minister to us on entrance into this Spirit of Prince application and ask him and seeking after you we thank you for all what you're doing all what you have done bless what we're going to read and share tonight and Jason may ask it email an email I was certainly blessed on Wednesday night uh by what Bulgarian shared about uh after the training is completed there's some people not going for trading at all so they're not even reaching that completion part because training has to do with discipline it's a discipline to attend this virtual permit internet you could do other things but this is what discipline is about the systematic rhythmic consistent Behavior has required of user discipline so we want to go in the world tonight and I want to just take two portions of scripture one from Luke 16 16. a scripture that we know and also from Jeremiah 29 it's 10 to 13. just want to get and um this thought I have for tonight is why not get down to business why not get down to business Luke 16 16 says the low on the prophets went to John and since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man presses into it not just simply walk into it easily where the brand says but there's it's got to be pressed into see when you seek me with all your heart now before Jeremiah 29 verse 10 says for thousand the Lord after 70 years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you and perform my good word towards you and causing you to return to this place for I know the thoughts that I think towards you share the Lord thoughts of Peace not of evil to give you an expected end and listen to verse 12. then this is God speaking now then shall you call upon and he shall go and pray unto me this is God's expectation this is called Cesar you shall go and pray unto me and I will happen unto you and you shall seek me and find me when you shall search for me with all your heart father May a blessed word in Jesus amen God bless you thanks again for being here tonight wow of something written here grumblers are you a grumbler or why now a complainer of for finer do you Mumble and Grumble of people who have Mumble and Grumble and the mumbles they say something indistinct and quietly making it difficult for others to hear so people know you're not happy and you mumbling words yeah I know whatever they say but you're mumbling you're seeing stuff but I want to share some of you tonight fate does not mumble Faith speaks fate looks for we Faith sees what is possible faith is never negative feet is always positive and people claim to have feet or their claims is to have revelation and by their behavior an attitude you could see they are short of what they are cleaning fate is revelation but it's revealed to you it causes you to look for we it causes you to see what is possible causes you to be positive that's what faith does scripture reading First Corinthians 10. we read let me consume it if you want to yes or just listen moreover brethren I would not that you would be ignorant hold at all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea we're all baptized into the Moses in the cloud and the Sea so always in the message all our books all updates all our pastors and all the nice churches and weakness and stuff right it only the same spiritual meat or drink the same spiritual drink and then drank of that spiritual rocket follow them the proposed Christ but there are many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness and the Wilderness is not a destination the willingness is the environment of tests the Wilderness is on the way to the promised land with six and these things were or examples to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted neither be either at us as some of them were some of them has written the people sat down to eat and drink and it was up to play neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three and twenty thousand neither let us stem crisis some of them also tempted I will destroy the serpents are some of the emotional members I'm gonna destroyer of the Destroyer listening spot now all these things happen unto them for examples and they are written for our admiration upon whom the end of the will come wherefore let him not think that he stand there take care less he fall here we go verse 13. this is what I want to get to they had no temptation taking you but what is coming to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that he are evil but will with the Temptation also make a way to escape that you may be able to dare so we complain about the Temptation or the test or the enticement to sin but you're not looking at with every enticement to sin every test every temptation God makes a way of Escape let's look at the scripture in verse First Corinthians 10 13 and the Amplified and I think it it really uh expands it okay let's go First Corinthians 10 13. for no temptation no trial regarded as enticement enticing to sin no matter how it comes or where it leads has overtaken you and laid hold on you that is not common to man that is no temptation of trial has come to you that is beyond human resistance that is their human resistance and that is not adjusted and adapted and belonging to Human Experience and such as man can bear but God is faithful to his word and to his compassionate nature and he can be trusted not here we go not to let you be tempted and tried and a seed beyond your ability and strength of resistance and power to endure but with the Temptation he will always always wish I would always he will always also provide the way out the means of escape to a landing place that you may be capable and strong and powerful to Bear up under it patiently like we say he may not take away the storm but he gives you peace he may not take away the Affliction but he gives you Grace okay let's go quickly now you can't purpose anything of God's promise in your heart without finding the reality to it listen to how this was a place you can't poop us not hearing and understanding and knowledge information but we're talking about purpose now anything of God's promise in your heart without finding the reality again if your soul has been tormented by sins and doubts ups and don'ts and frustrations and there is something done in you that is telling you that there is somewhere you can overcome that why do you throw the wrong from church to church from place to please just kneel down till you strike heaven as I said last night go beyond the song barriers then you'll have a purpose in life you will have a purpose and belonging to the church you'll have a purpose in being baptized you will have a purpose in what you are seeking for cause we know that God is honest God is true and God cannot lie if you need any need whatever that God has promised in this Bible he's here tonight to meet that need no need if she can feel that his presence is here his spirit is here and he is willing here we go he is willing already and longing to give to you what you are seeking for why would you wait any longer or hear this part when you come to him don't come as a floater I'll go up and try and see if it works you will never get nowhere when you come with this kind of a determination that you have sold out Lock Stock and Bar when you are tired of the world and sin and unbelief and frustration and doubts and come to the Living God with an anchor surely tightening the Rock of Ages the holy spirit is here to pull you into the presence of the Living God and that will give you a faith that you overcome anything else in the world sickness disease and even that itself you see when he said when you come with that kind of determination what does the bible see if it is it is the substance of things were for the evidence of Things Not Seen freezer he that committed God commit to God like we are doing tonight must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently or passionately or enthusiastically or persistently or with a determination seek it after him you shall find me strictly read when you seek me with all of your heart no watch he says you said you said that brother Branham that's what I meant that was it not Lazarus lame dead I've never heard this before I want to say it again tonight I fell a lot to do this tonight was it not Lazarus who was laying dead in the ground and already corruption set when Jesus at the master way have you buried him if you want doubt you shall see the glory of God did not I tell you not a doubt he said to Jairus that night or that day if you only believe you can see the glory of God then fit overcomes debt fate is the victory overcomes debt fate is the victory over sin faith is the victory over sickness faith is the victory over worry fate is a victory over frustrations fate is the victory over the world you say John when he wrote that he didn't have my troubles he didn't have to deal with the folk that I deal with he didn't have to go through the things that I do all right but again said he said when this is nice when he passes exam to get his license when I stole him go and learn to drive you only get the path the authority to be on the road but the training doesn't teach you in the driving at night it doesn't teach you when it's raining but you have the tools I want to share with you tonight God put something in you to resist sin to resist temptation God put tools in you you have the tools and we want to show you by the word tonight what God is expecting of you that you could ride over it who is it now he may not have had to deal with the same folk Dr John he may not have had to overcome the same thing but he never excluded him for he said the Fate is the victory that overcomes the world the whole thing how is it get fit right above it when we have the written word of God laying before us and the Holy Spirit here performing and showing the resurrection of the Lord Jesus with Divine promises written here whatever desire When you pray believe you receive it you shall have it what do you do then have fit not just floating feet as a new one so you have something called floating feet not just make believe fit but a real fit and we read this thing last Sunday Feed is a conqueror feed is an overcomer it isn't a peacemaker it's overcome fate is a victory that overcomes the world what does it do what is Faith it's a conqueror conqueror and victory is the same to Hong Kong means to beat down to override to handcuffs to train to prison it means that the sin that want to rule you you let me know it means that you have overcome it you whipped it you are greater than it and faith is the victory that overcomes Every curse of the devil features the victory feed is what faith in what not faith in your church not faith in your Creed not feeding some man but faith in Jesus Christ who made a promise that's the victory what is it my arm is so crippled but fit is a victory I still feel sick but fate is a victory it overcomes the world when you can climb into God and I'm saying that I'm believing that tonight by prayer until you see the thing conquered under you there's nothing that can hurt you then you have overcome you got 15 miles of Elbow Room you are still in Freedom how many you want to get some Elbow Room tonight freedom from Devils from frustration from all kind of contrary influences just Elbow Room that you can move up push it to God okay and this is the part I want to get to tonight to wrap up this whole thing where I get this taught from why not get out of business but Ram speaks a little woman that's sitting present now so he was talking about somebody that was right there in the service she has been at this altar Time After Time After Time a good woman but she started smoking a long time ago she just couldn't overcome it but she had come up and I would pray with her and seemed like she just couldn't overcome it and the first thing you know I told her I said there'll be Deja down the road he didn't show all the church he didn't blast her she just tell her there's danger down the road she said but a problem I have cried I have begged you see just emotional fight in the air that won't do any good I hope you're following this with me tonight I hope that you're connecting it to your own experience and what you yourself go through and I get done and pray with her this is what I want to know there's not an evangelist this is not some teacher this is a prophet I get down and pray with her testimony prayed with me and lay hands on up and she'll go back and a few days I'll meet her again and just knock you down with cigarette smoke and still Brown and one night Don yondo she went to the doctor begin to get sick whether are we till just sell this time we think and the doctor looked into her she said cancer smoking cigarettes there she was laying yesterday then she got down to business see a drunken man which was true as long as you can walk onto this church tonight you know you can go and join the Methodist or Baptist as long as you can sit in here and there are people they have become so arrogant in this message can't tell them anything they won't tell me anything you could walk from one group to the next group they could there have to be no group at all because they have books their tips and just about A pompous arrogant they don't even have the attitude of being a forgiveness sinner talking to other sinners let's continue as long as you walk out the church tonight no you can join the Methodist of Baptist as long as you can sit in here and say I'm a good person there's nothing wrong with me yeah you can't do nothing with you yeah you can't do nothing with you that's right it is one but when you see your sins as God sees them in the light of his Bible when you see then you repent or perish something will take place you'll get onto business so she walk out here small small around your heart the doctor back there will be raised up and said it's a heart attack you get down to business that's when she had to get to business and the woman is sitting looking at me now but Robertson is back there Mr wood but a Witcher in there somewhere and I believe they're in a truck and the Holy Spirit seemed to move us the war way up and there she was when I got there she had a dream and when the Holy Spirit came into the room she got down to real business here we go she never smoked a cigarette from then on she had gained many pounds of Wheat and they can't find a trace of cancer what is it it is feet that overcome Why didn't it overcome when I was praying for her question he prayed you need hands you encouraged her she got the altar she's a regular old alcohol person always up there why didn't I it overcome when I was praying for here she was just fluttering around but when the doctor said you got cancer you're going to die she got to business and that's the way it has to to get when you get to business why read that wrong why not get down to business no I'm using that why not get onto business tonight put your feet in God or hear this bomb here what if the woman had feet I'd have faith in me it will feel because I'm a man and watch this now this is so good the prophet prayed for he lay hands upon her and what if her confidence was in him he led her upon me and this happened who touched her with that he says watch what if the woman had a faith in me it will feel because I'm a man but when she changed her feet not in the brand of Tabernacle or in William Branham or in someone else but please a fit in Jesus Christ then she got feet she reads up over her fears don't and God healed her feet is the victory and I'll close with this he was speaking about the woman that had the dead baby in Mexico and she didn't want to bury a baby she held on to the baby because she saw that somebody else was here and different things like that and she was talking about she'll run right under the top of the shoulders fall right down among them she would gain a few feet then try to put her back out she'll come right between their legs holding this baby upsetting ushers and everything else she was getting up there she had to get there it didn't make any difference she was going to get there now when the same desperation Rises it will true love and feet up there in the Battlefront to claim what you want because it's a promise of God that you can have it I turn to the minister or evangelist at the place I turn I felt sorry for the woman but there was no desperation right till I thought well but a jack will pray for her that settle it as I was speaking now I looked there and there was a vision so all of a sudden a vision broke to him I seen a little baby sitting there a little black face Mexican baby with no teeth he was laughing at me said no there I said wait a minute wait a minute oh he had a point here now her desperation drove the Holy Spirit to change my subject change my eyes and show me her babysitting there that sent the spirit back I said prison energy wait a minute bring me the baby here she come with the little wet soaking blue and white blanket a little dead form about a lot long she fell with her crucifix in her hand or rosary and say healing Mary I said put that put it up that's not necessary and she can't close away while she scream Padre which means father I said don't say that don't say that do you believe he said in Spanish to her and she said yes she believed he asked her how she would believe she said if God can give that old man his sight he can give my baby the light desperation Drew over to it not a thing in my part I just saw the vision I said Lord Jesus I saw a vision of this little baby it might be this one and that kind of kick his feet and they was raised from the dead desperation when those Seekers moved all thy heart then I will hear you see the kingdom the low on the prophets went to John since that time the Kingdom of Heaven is preached and man president urugues stand around and say pick me up by the color Lord push me in you tonight as sometime you are hearing me tonight

new pages and things and said I said sister she got up and said I believe I'll be all right I said no stay there and then the first thing you know she started praying a little bit and directly she got louder and louder and after a while she got desperate she said oh God save me alcoholic I'm not send the money on a mask couldn't cure it nothing else could do it but then big black eyes look at me tears dropping off her cheeks and said something happened oh yeah something happened she got desperate let's be desperate about this between death and life if you can't get desperate don't come
