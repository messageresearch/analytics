belongs to you because you have Victory we could touch into that Victory Lord you are not just a conqueror Lord You Are The Mighty conqueror and you said that we are no more than conquerors so father we thank you this morning for the grace and the love and the mercy you have extended to us this morning to be called your sons and your daughters and to be granted the privilege to enter into your gates with Thanksgiving in our hearts with a praise and our lips with worship from our very inner being may you bless the reading of the word open our understanding we pray a special blessing this morning on our pastor that he would touch it from the crown of his head to the soul of his feet touch him in his body even now if there's anyone else in our midst this morning who might not be feeling well may the angel of the Lord move to them and even as the word is ministered Lord may they get a charge from their to offy this morning Lord we know this is there's no better place to be this morning than in your house this morning there's no place I'd rather be than in your house this morning so Lord may you speak to us from your word and anoint your people anoint me touch my vocal cords and Lord let nothing be said that you don't want say and may what you once said be said with boldness Lord with the Precision Lord to cut through situations and to bring Deliverance to your people Lord you said that they that are well have no need of a physician so we are here this morning looking for the great physician to minister to the a of Salvation may you take complete control in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says and the church says amen so before you take your seats if you would turn with me to three portions of scripture I greet you this morning in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ it's certainly a great privilege to be here in the house of the Lord one more time it's not something we could ever take for granted and we are looking to take full opportunity and advantage of what God has for us today the word teaches us that you get what you expect so I trust you have great expectation this morning and we are looking for God to bless in a might way so reading uh from The Book of Psalms we're going to read Psalms 85 Psalms 138 and 2 Kings 3 uh for our scripture reading this morning before we take our seats Psalms 85 and verse 6 will thou not revive us again anybody looking for a Revival anybody looking for something to move upon you that your walk is different your talk is different will thou not revive us again that thy people may rejoice in thee so there's a rejoicing that is connected to Revival there's a joy that's connected to Revival and I believe that we're in a season of entering into a bride's revival can the church say Amen Psalms 1387 though I walk in the midst of trouble thou wil revive me Hallelujah Thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies and thy right hand shall save me and reading 2 Kings 3 and reading verse 16 and he said thus sayeth the Lord make this Valley full of ditches for thus sayeth the Lord ye shall not see wind neither shall ye see rain yet that Valley shall be filled with water that ye may drink both ye and your cattle and your beast and this is but a light thing in the sight of the Lord he will deliver the moabites also into your hand and he shall Smite every fence City this is not the Open Cities now but the fence the protected oh my and every Choice City and shall F every good tree and stop all Wells of water and Mar every good piece of land with stones may the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning in the presence of the Lord certainly a great privilege to be here to fight the good fight of Fate amen and so I do want to take this opportunity to extend a happy anniversary to the pastor and his wife this morning 45 years amen I'm I I I I I am a direct beneficiary of that blessing and many of us direct beneficiaries of that blessing and we pray that the Lord would continue to bless them and strengthen them in this season as they set an example for us because that's what God allows us to see examples and these examples have an impact on those that have you know come on and on and on so that we too in this time of Darkness Darkness could shine and arise and shine for thy light is come we live in a time when families are under attack homes are under attack churches are under attack people are under attack and if you are not under attack you should be very worried because being under attack shows that there's a Target on you that the devil wants to destroy there's something about you that the devil is after so if you are not under some kind of pressure this morning you should be very worried so count yourself privileged if the the the hounds of hell are against you count yourself blessed if this week was an upside down week and every turn you make there was something to try to stop you because the devil knows there's something in you that he's trying to derail trying to throw off trying to upset can the church say Amen so we in everything we give him thanks in the good times in the bad times and it's easy to thank him in the good times you know but how do you thank him in the bad times you ever stop to think about it some of these songs we sing We Sing it because it's the words of the song but in the good times praise His name in The Bad Times do the same meaning the same kind of praise and worship and thanks you give when it's good you don't do do a a a a lower level thanks and praise when things go bad you maintain the same level of praise and thanksgiving in the bad times when when things not working out you say Lord I Thank You Lord I praise you I Praise You In The Storm oh hallelujah oh my blessed be the name of the lord it's it's not easy to praise and in the storm it's not easy to be grateful in the storm in everything give thanks thanking him for the storm that you don't understand why this storm has your name on it but you're thanking him anyway even when you don't understand you thank him even when you don't feel like it you thank him Hallelujah and that's why worship is such an important thing and and the few words we had yesterday and how many were blessed by the evening yesterday I hope your batteries were recharged and you got some rest so you could put some fire in your service this morning it can be I'm the only one here with some fire Hallelujah Glory making sure the temperature is right brother George looking for God to do something special for us looking for God's people to create a Revival because the minister can never bring a Revival but it takes the people to bring a Revival to create a Revival and how you do it you do it in your home you do it in your prayer closet you do it in a taxi you do it when you're in school you do it when you're washing the dishes you do it in the taxi everywhere you go you're under expectation and you creating an atmosphere you know you could create the atmosphere around you Hallelujah I'm just encouraging you here this morning so I have a title this morning let us dig let us dig a valley full of ditches let us do something this is something that we have to do God is not coming and dig your Valley brother over can of dig your Valley full of ditches we all have to dig a valley for our blessing if you believe God is about to bless you there's got to be some kind of preparation made for you to receive your blessing so this is not the kind of service to look for the brother next to you to dig for you I want to know how much blessing you want because how much ditches you dig defines your expectation Hallelujah if you expect a little bit think a small ditch but if you're looking for healing then you take you have to take a ditch that could fit healing oh come on now somebody preach back to me if you looking for your family to be delivered you got to dig ditch that's big enough for the blessing of your family being delivered if you're looking for adoption you're going to have a ditch that could fit adoption come on now because in this rain this Harvest rain this this this this latter rain come on now it's about to fall it's fixing to fall we have not believed in vain all these years that we have come to church has not been in vain all these years of believing looking for something has not been there un vain Hallelujah so TI the letters d a valley full of ditches an encouragement to you and a subject making preparations for a 700 Revival Hallelujah there's got to come a Revival there's got to be a Revival and the bride Revival is a seven Thunder Revival seven Thunders gather the bride seven Thunders shows her how to prepare seven oh come on now gives her faith Hallelujah and seven Thunders is the bride Revival Hallelujah that's a exclusive bride promise it's only for the bride not for the church member but there's a 7even under the Revival in that Revival is your redemption in that Revival is your healing in that Revival is everything you've been looking for Faith to leave this place Hallelujah not just Faith to come to church but Faith to for these 16 elements to be changed faith for our body change faith for this gray hair to come back black oh Hallelujah and an inspiration restoring the Divine connection for your Revival because you can't have a Revival without a connection a personal connection a personal experience you must know God and God must know you Hallelujah this is nothing to do with church this is not what church you go to this is you and God and God and you in a secret closet having a connection having a relationship having Fellowship having communion every day should be communion every day should be Fellowship every day you rise above your situation every day you rise above your frustration you become bulletproof you become sin proof you become backside proof you become giving up proof you become allergic to giving up you become allergic to depression you become allergic to frustration not that situations wouldn't come to throw you off but something in you is greater than the situation can the church say Amen so looking for God to do something so you have to be under expectation listen God is not the risk taker God is not a restrictor Hallelujah everything God does with a pop well he does it knowing what's going to happen he he not taking a chance this morning on you can I say that one more time he eliminat risk anybody with me this morning so to guarantee that you make it he put names in the book because he not taking chances to guarantee that you're going to make it he sent his son to die for you so that there's blood so even when you make a mistake he wants to cancel risk so that the blood could speak for you when you can't speak for yourself oh you don't hear me this morning God is not taking a risk this morning on Redemption on salvation on adoption even on your family can the church say Amen oh hallelujah thank God for his Mercy thank God for his grace and thank God for making a way because God is not a taker Lazarus couldn't stay Dead come on now because God is a risk taker no son can end up in that situation and God can't take him out of every situation you end up in God knew the risk involved and he put a provision in there Daniel in the lion D was never at risk oh come on Hallelujah but Anthony preaching next to me say Danel had an insurance policy the insurance policy is you know you take insurance to deal with risk Daniel was never at risk when Moses was going down there on the Nile he was never at risk because God don't take risk God don't have to take a risk because he knows the end from the beginning if you know the end from before the beginning you don't take any risk and your end God knows your end he sees you in the Rapture he sees you adopted that's enough to make a back shout enough to make a Methodist convert enough to make a c come and run to the altar to know that God is not trying to hope you make it he put everything in place to make it Hallelujah you didn't even find the message the message found you he said the message would find itself in the hands of the predestinated you couldn't miss this church if you wanted to you couldn't miss the prophet if you wanted to H hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated am remember the mark God chose your family God chose your country God chose your village God chose the school you go to he chose a university he chose who to send to University and who he couldn't handle in University all of it coming together to ensure that you find yourself in where you're supposed to be to be able to be a reflection of his goodness that's why we ought to be so thankful this morning because he's a way maker and the way he made for you is different than the way he made for me but he is a way maker can the church say amen I want you to think about in friends God is not a risk taker if you give you a son he give you a daughter he give you a family there's no risk there he will put things in place to deliver Hallelujah the children of Israel were there in bondage in Egypt and they were they were not at risk there was oppression there was a Taskmaster but it were not at risk it was just a matter of time until the word of God came to the right season and when the word formed the right season then they were there was a right man who was born on Moses he was started as a baby and that baby was not at risk in fact God made sure but a punch that he had the best food in Egypt talk about God not taking risk make sure that the best trainers in Egypt could train Moses because he want to make sure Moses could handle everything can the church say Amen oh be thankful this morning lift your head up there's more for you than against you there's more blessing over you than you realize count your blessings name them one by one so this morning we are under expectation for a seventh under the Revival we are under expectation not for a pente costal Revival we are under expectation for a bride's Revival this is just for the bride not just for message Believers not just and listen I want to make a distinction here the Bible says that the devil believes so if an an trembles there were a lot of preachers here this morning devil believes answerable but the say he frightened but the distinction I want to make here is if it was just down to belief then the devil make it so this is so there's a separation between just having a belief or believing because the devil believes that more than some message Believers he has had enough experience to believe he know it by experience that when God say you going to do something you going to do something some of us still have to come to that understanding that what God said he's going to do he's going to do but the devil has seen it time and time again so the devil believes and trembles because he know God is a god of his word so if it's just belief then the devil will be qualified but there are some things the devil cannot access but the brandom said that the devil cannot get under the blood because if he can get under the blood he'll be your brother so the blood is exclusive for a group of people who could access under there anybody with me this morning and there's something else that's powerful that's the key to unlocking your blessing that the devil cannot do the devil cannot worship so if you really want to separate yourself from just the regular Believers you just have to worship because the devil resists he can't worship Hall you don't hear me this morning that's what he fought for he wanted worship it's not in him to worship so you begin to break out of his gra you say thank you Jesus thank you Lord Jesus Hallelujah blessing and honor might and power you are doing what the devil can never do and when the Praises go up the glory comes down can the Church Say Amen and time and time again we see in scripture I'm just encouraging you this morning just talking to you a little bit sometime it's good just have a little conversation around the word but the man said when you talk about him he draws near he loves for us to talk about him you know Hallelujah people spend time with Teran talking about politics and this and that and it has its place modern events made clear by prophecy we can spend time there too but there's nothing like talking about Jesus he's the center of my joy he's the center of my peace he's my way maker my provider when you can't talk to nobody else he can talk to him and he's always available to talk to you you don't ever get a busy tone when you call him he is always available all the time you can call him at 9:00 a.m. you can call him at 9:00 p.m. you call him at 1:00 p.m. or 1:00 a.m. 5:00 a.m. or 5: p.m. Jesus is on the main line he don't have a hotline with angels responding he himself is on Main Line you could tell them what you want this morning oh I feel religious this morning oh I feel religious I feel like the old fashion sin killing sky blue kind of Holy Ghost Revival service that's what young people need in know it's good to have programs and these things but give them an experience with the old fashioned sin killing sky blue Holy Ghost Revival but it's a change of the inside and see your appetite begin to change the things that used to attract your attention no more start to look all how that used to attract my attention but when your appetite change oh my can the church say Amen you may be seated so we ought to be under expectation and expectation puts us into a state of preparation and preparation is very interesting because we at that time of the year today December the 15th we were around 10 days away from Christmas and I always remember precious brother John Phillip one Christmas you say I'm not painting I'm not painting I'm not painting catch they I'm not painting not this year they're not taking my money this year not painting where was Christmas Eve when he spirited him so he went and by paid he paid all night long because there's a pressure to be prepared and you have to be not just aware of preparation but there's a spirit that comes with preparation you know and and if and and and and this is the challenge of it people really not in the spirit of the coming of your Lord because when you're in the spirit of the coming of your lord it puts you in a state to have to make preparations to leave here brother mam taught us plan as he coming in 20 years but live if you com in tomorrow because they put you in a state of Readiness am I ready to go spiritually ready some of us we have so much plans and things we let this distort us and we we're not sensitive to the fact that time is really short we out of time in them can the church say Amen but before we leave here there has to be a Revival there has to be an outpouring there has to be a Deliverance I cannot believe that so many who have passed through not just this church but this message who Fall Away God is going to leave them there we have to be the ones who stand in the Gap to get into position to speak for them to pray for them to car for them he said unto you and to your children and as many as are far off many as the Lord God shall call there are many who are walking around predestinated and they don't know it or predestinated and forgotten it who are they waiting on not God they waiting on you and I to dig a valy full of ditches to make preparation for the blessing to make room for the Deliverance can the Church Say Amen oh Hallelujah Glory Glory Glory making preparations for seven T the Revival digging a valley full of ditches restoring Your Divine connection restoring your prayer closet restoring an atmosphere around you that the devil can't break past can the church say Amen oh in the message expectation talking about Noah he was expecting it to rain so he made preparations for the rain oh I like that the prophet said oh make preparation as long as you hear God's word then make preparations for it to happen and wait under expectation oh that makes me start feeling religious to begin with to think that God said so and be expecting it so I want to encourage you this morning don't just be expecting the new year and expecting the season and all that but let's be under expectation for a holy ghost Revival let's be under expectation for an UNP pouring of the spirit in the message that same message but everybody said now if God has promised a Revival here we're going to have it let's make ready for it if God promised to heal let's make ready for it if Jesus said the same works I do you shall do also let's make ready for it move out everything get ready we are right in time we are not one day early we're not one day late today is the day I'm not waiting until tomorrow I'm not waiting until next week I'm not waiting until 225 today is the day I'm going to be healed today I'm going to be free today my my son is going to be delivered today my daughter is being delivered today my healing is today my breakthrough is today my financial situation will change today now fate is hallelujah I'm not waiting until tomorrow I claim if you're sick this morning claim you're healing today Hallelujah not just Lord Is A Healer but today Lord I'm Healed God is not now healing he healed you way back on Calvary claim your healing say today is my day female condition today Hallelujah high blood pressure today healed delivered set free whatever it is brother bam goes on he said now it'll seem foolish he said I don't care what anything contrary is to that it's wrong Hallelujah Noah had to make preparations Esther had to make make preparations the father of the protal son when he saw son had to make preparations Hallelujah we got to make preparations Hallelujah in the message making the valley full of ditches but abam said and the only way you ever going to see your way out is an old fashioned spiritual Revival where the Hallelujah of God is ringing from the bottom of your heart and an oldfashioned Holy Ghost sent Revival HS the place then you begin to see things then God will begin to reveal things then you'll wonder why these real Christians are hanging on while they praying for you and that's a challenge today there are too many Cold lukew War formal powerless Christians but but B said the only way you're going to see a way out is a oldfashioned sin killing sky blue Holy Ghost Revival one time with the BR the CL said it'll make you act unseemly it'll make you dance a certain way it'll make you shout a certain way it'll make you move a certain way has nothing to do with a person next to you you looking for your Revival you experiencing your Revival has nothing to do with your husband your wife your children your family the church is you in Revival there's one over there in Revival the Revival is TI to the church you are the Revival the Revival is a moving Revival the Revival is a personal Revival the Revival is something that's on the inside nobody can take it away this Joy I have the world didn't give it to me the world can't take take it away I have no money I'm still in Revival I got money I'm in Revival he don't heal me I'm still in Revival but I got to Sal on my lips I got a praise on my heart Hallelujah I'm defying the laws of gravity I'm lifting my hands up I'm creating the environment creating the atmosphere I smile in the face of the devil it doesn't matter what the devil does to me I am in Revival don't mess with my Revival don't mess with my Revival this is my Revival say amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Revival means freedom Revival means restoration Revival means Redemption Revival means another book of Acts Revival means another day of Pentecost Revival means a super Church Revival means another Ephesians Revival means the baptism of the Holy Ghost all of that is in the Revival oh hallelujah hallelujah I don't just want to come to church to come to church sake I say it all the time one preacher I'm tired of church deorah George I'm looking for reality and I'm looking for more church I'm looking for the sick to be healed I'm looking for the blind eyes to pop open I'm looking for young children who don't know God to come and say I met it for myself God has no no grandchildren I'm looking for people who saying I don't want no part of sin those sin are in these members do sin those sin is in this body I'm making my body obey my confession I am in Revival I'm going to be filled I'm going to be healed I'm going to be delivered by Stripes I'm Healed by Stripes I'm Healed nothing going to change that can the church say Amen oh hallelujah hallelujah but said Revival does five things you remember these five things he said it brings souls to Christ that's the Great Commission Hallelujah you have to have a burden to see your loved ones your family your co-workers come to Christ it can't be business as usual you looking for God to do something judgment is over the Earth if you are true son true daughter there's a burden in Your Heart Lord may they see the truth may they come to know you may they come to Know You by Revelation and experience but a Revival puts a burden in you to bring souls to Christ when laugh has has you have you told somebody about the Lord say testify you know what brother said if you don't testify when they find back that's the rec when you don't testify andless is not you in your house talking to those in your house that's fine but if it it can't be a secret and I tell you go and rain down fire and brimstone in your office you know but testify God is good do you know the Lord have you met the Lord you you see me why I'm happy and and listen BR Punch If you can't be happy you can't attract nobody you if you are looking like something going on good they say in sales if you are believe in your product you can't sell your product them well I have a kind of watch here it's a kind of I don't already have one myself but you all buy it would you would you buy that that's I say when you want to go and eat good food go to a restaurant when you see the chef eating his own food this is this is serious thing one time I went to a restaurant I saw the chef come on and take a plate I say I want whoever he eaten because if the chef who cook the food sit don't eating that give me that because he beli in his own product can you CH say Amen so you have to believe in your product you have to believe that God is a good god you have to believe that God Is A Healer and your testimony and your experience to become so positive that especially when you're down that's the best time to sell it because but that is the time when people will believe you the most because when things looking good and everything is fine then is it's a normal thing but it's when you go against the O and you're swimming upstream and they you come to work and you know something happen and they say but how you so happy that is when they could testify can the church say Amen when you feel like giving up that's when you testify and you'll find that when you testify in those low moments you get encouraged you remember the time bov was testifying how somebody came to him and tell him they want to backslide he said by time he say how you could do that and by time and he himself was going through his own experience by time he done he he preach himself you know but that's the problem with many of us I was sharing with somebody recently in I remember in a Rema church for those who were when we were in AR Rema what it was you say a lot throw the acts first so when you get to your job your school let them know I'm a Christian don't hide it but when you declare it and say I'm a Christian I'm believer they actually help you live it because they'll say but I thought you say you're a Christian I thought you were say a man of f i remember in school doing that and people saying Isaac move from here you can't hear this they they say this is not for you because you say you're a Christian and it creates an environment around you it creates something around you that it kep it keeps you on track because you want to make it you don't want to come all these years and he make it you know what is to come to church all these years and not and not make it so whatever you got to do to put in place to make sure you make it you do that so I want to encourage you as we wind down 2024 and look to 2025 you have to practice the Bible say he who winth a soul is wise what is your testimony of sharing this gospel with people now we bringing it personal what is your testimony of telling someone around the Lord about the Lord because if you try once and twice and it didn't happen you just going to give up so I want to encourage you as you approach this new season all this is part of your training because you have to be able to have a testimony and there are some people because of how they live in school in the neighborhood on the street they can't even testify if your neighbor cannot accept an invitation to come to church you have to check yourself we talking this morning but Brother Andy preaching part if you're coworker you can't invite them to church because of how you living on the job you have to check yourself in because your life supposed to be such a bul that when you invite them they they I can't wait to come because seeing something about your life that is attractive to me that I want to come to wherever you're going I want to hear what you're feeding on because I can't believe you could be so different from the rest of us but many of us we hideing we don't want anybody to know we a Christian you're in the lunchroom and you're there you do the fastest prayer for your lunch maybe this is not everybody but but a cple maybe one person inside here people they want to pray for their lunch in the lunch room and say Lord bless it you don't want anybody to know that and the Bible say my people shall never be ashamed young people I want you to take note of this know because it's the key to God blessing you you not being ashamed of this gospel so Revival is to do five things bring souls to Christ bring the church back to the spiritual condition it should be in like the alpha Church bring close communion with God not close communion with movies not close communion with your friends not no but close communion with God it brings Fellowship among the churches and it brings an atmosphere to pray for these sicks pray for the sick that's what we need tonight is a good oldfashioned backward sin killing sky blue religion bleach under the power of the Holy Ghost that's still in the message making a valley full of ditches familiar quote the third seal now that's what's the reason today the Revival that we are supposed to have we have denominational revivals we haven't had a real stirring no no no no no sir don't think we've got revivals we haven't oh they've got millions and millions and millions of church members but not a Revival nowhere no no the bride has hasn't had a Revival yet see there's been no Revival there no manifestation of God to thir the bride yet see we're looking for it it will take those seven unknown Thunders back there to wake her up again he will send it he promis it and I'm resting on this can the church say Amen I'm resting on this promise I can't move from this promise he promised to send it it will not be man working it up but he will send it seventh on the Revival wake her up again put that bride into action the seventh Thunders the seventh Revival is the bride Revival the seventh Revival is the journey to the Rapture it's got to come can the church say Amen Give the Lord a shout of Praise seven tunders will gather the bride seven tund will give the bride Faith seven tunders will show the bride how to go it'll be the manifestation of God that stir the bride it'll be a manifestation of those S Thunders oh Hallelujah a living faith a living virtue a living knowledge a living Temperance a living patience a living godliness a living brotherly kindness a living charity Christ himself living making himself known through you through your 16 elements can the church say Amen oh that's what the whole creation is groaning it's travailing it's under expectation for the manifestation of the sons of of God the trees are looking for it nature is looking for it the governments they need it Hallelujah because everything else has to come subject to the sons of God oh I believe the sons of God are coming back into power as we shift Hallelujah from 2024 to 2025 s is this the time oh Hallelujah call me old fashioned but I know what I'm looking for hallelujah we're not going to stay bound forever we're not going to stay under pressure forever you're not going to stay under the grip of the enemy forever whatever is holding you back we serve notice to the devil today Satan let God's people go Satan we serve you notice the time has come the season has change we have turned the corner Pride time seed time revival time manifestation time outpouring time healing time Deliverance time oh Hallelujah this is not the message world this is not even the church this is individuals this morning God is looking for individuals it's an individual Affair if you want Deliverance today is your day you want to be free today is your day you could shout you could jump you could worship you could praise him oh hallelujah oh I'm reminding you of what you already know I'm not preaching anything new new to you but this is for your remembrance so you can hold on to the promise of God and know your family is going to be delivered Hallelujah know you are going to be delivered know that you are going to be adopted know that you are going to be free and most importantly you're going to be in the Rapture the Rapture is mine Joy is mine peace is mine victory is mine Joy is mine peace is mine Worship Is Mine praise is mine I'm not going to let no rock out praise me I'm not going to let the pews out praise me I'm not going to let some concert in the world have more noise Hallelujah there's going to be noise in this church a noise of Jubilee a noise of Revival a noise of Praise if you have never worshiped lift your hands and worship you never shouted before Give the Lord a shout you never give him praise before Give the Lord a oh come on now hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah I mentioned it yesterday that woman whose daughter was vexed with the Devil the Canaanite woman she came to Jesus it was not that she didn't ever need she came with a real situation she called Jesus she explained her situation and God didn't pay her no attention hallelujah hallelujah because there's two things God looking for and she didn't show those two things yet God can't respond unless it he sees those two things Hallelujah and Jesus is walking this morning Hallelujah he's looking for those two things if anybody presents those two things something is going to happen you don't hear me this morning two things he's looking for Hallelujah and once those two things are present he's got to do something Hallelujah and that woman she had desperation she had stick tutiven you ever found that word in the dictionary stick to ATIV didn't come to give up she say I'm not going back home so when Jesus didn't pay attention to her she went to the disciples and she say brother brother Peter brother Peter brother Peter until Peter said Jesus just deal this because Peter wasn't converted yet Peter was running out of patience he said I handle his pressure Jesus said my food my purpose my desire being here is for the house of Israel well who tell him say that oh my that woman she heard that and she said to worship and when Jesus told that worship it caught his attention condition one was met because once you worship God he's now on speaking terms with you Hallelujah condition two was not met yet but when Jesus see now how bad you really want this how bad you really want it because there are some people here this morning they don't want to change you know brother Andy there are people who in church for years with no change they already W change change and the moment you correct them or straighten them out or say something to them they they they act up so Jesus want to test the spirit because he wants to activate the second part of the thing the second condition he say it's not fit to take the children's bread and cast it to dogs that's a that's a statement to separate to see to the separate from the men from the boys and what did the sister do she opened her phone and went straight to Facebook she called the express and say you know I went to this church and this man tell me I'm a dog she make a video Hallelujah here I am this is me right outside the church you can see right there look petza look a live stream in here I fed up but but over preach it she didn't look because your pain your problem your need has to be bigger than what people say to you the Usher I shake my hand the Deacon I shake my hand that the wrong seat how long I in church I get to GRE the pastor did all kind of issues she wasn't focused on the issues you know she was on her KNE she said but wait a minute if I really want this thing what the what what what what do the dogs see but but even the dogs get crumbs from the master table well when she said that second condition meant he said woman you see that fate you're moving with because when you have worship and Faith together God has to move oh come on now somebody help me this morning when worship meets Faith or When Faith meets worship oh come on now you could get healing today you listen not just get you could take it you could take your healing it on the shelf and you can pick it up and walk out with it you don't need to ask permission to be healed you could take up healing and it's like a grocery whatever you put in the C you can walk out this grocery because it already paid for it don't need no credit card it don't need no bank statement whatever you put in there you can walk out with it this morning can the church say amenl and you can only worship if you know God if you understand who God is his nature his being his attributes because only then you can not worship in spirit and in truth you see it all ties together but if you don't have faith because people are worshiping without faith and faith is the currency is the only currency you know it's not talk it's bold but call Reckless feet that is mine Fai to believe the impossible the doctor give you a run put look at your put and laugh at report by faith I'm Healed by Stripes I'm Healed I care what our people say that paper is not for me that's why your words are so important don't walk around saying I'm sick and I have this and the doctors say it but I know you can we adjust our vocabulary this morning the doctor say my sugar high are a claiming that you know my sugar is normal let the week say I'm strong your words Define Your Destiny come on now the doctor say I have female condition that what they saying but I know I'm Healed can the church say Amen the doctor says arthritis but that is them my God say I will supply all your needs healing is your children's spread anybody with me this morning life and death is in the power of the tongue so you need to speak different I heard a a doctor say when you say you're tired your body just answer that you know so I know to practice even if you thought come I don't want to verbalize it but but I feeling so he I want to finish that statement and when you set up because your body listen to your words your thoughts is one thing your thoughts are powerful but you see when you put it into words it brings a reality to it because spoken word is the attribute of creation you know is the spoken word everything is here by the word Let There Be Let There Be So when you say and verbalize certain things all of a sudden things that line up a certain way that's why the Bible say let the weak say it they saying you're not weak but say you're strong because you create your world and I've preached it before that in the natural they have positive affirmations that's tapping into a spiritual principle today is going to be a great day and what what kind of thing they have said before you leave your house I'm I'm positive I am happy I am satisfied I'm happy and I'm like that's a Biblical principle and people in natural walking in that I'm happy it's a nice day it's going to be a great day I'm going to sell I'm going to be and and they're living in that environment and Believers have all the books have all the tapes by tired but if you know the enemy just beating me up beating me up remember years ago I met a brother I was young and at the time it troubled me he see the devil just coughing me and kicking me and I looking up at him like I was shocked but by verbalizing these things you digging a deeper hole you're diing no deeper ditch we talking about you just dig yourself in a hole but you have to speak positive so I want to encourage you as you end this year and going into New Year speak positive and watch situation in your life change watch your environment change watch your circumstance change cut out the negative just speak positive and brother BR I think ready but where somebody asked the prophet if he was lying he said no it was my confession you can't tell me about my confession can the church say Amen blessed be the name of the Lord you you love the Lord this morning could you take some more I just having a conversation with the church and I feeling I feeling strong but I'm not feeling tired and today is the Lord's day so we here to just enjoy the presence of the Lord and spend time reset and reboot you know when somebody is under the influence of drugs they have to put them in a place of detox cut away certain things so that they could reset and recalibrate they take them away from the environments that might enable them and they put them somewhere separate so they could spend some time away from certain things and when it come to church is ready at time to detox because the reality is friends is a small portion of your time per week you spend in church in you spend a set of hours in work you hours walk and the few hours you have in church people want to know well how long how long again how long say the message of the hour keep you service with an hour but when it come to the house of the Lord you want something to be said to touch your heart to encourage you to help you see that there's ways to improve to change if you are the same person now as you were at the beginning of this year you have two weeks to change could I say that one more time you have people who happy to say I'm the same person nobody could change me where you see is where you get my mother make me so all kind of people that not for the messenger that is not bright talk because we want to be changed from glory to glory to glory we want to be shaped and horned to be a reflection of the image not of the church or of the pastor but of God you when when people see you they see but that is the Life of Christ that is the virtue of Christ the Faith of Christ the knowledge of Christ The Temperance of Christ the patience godliness the brotherly kindness the forgiveness and as brother said yesterday after sister Karen gave a testimony that the character form in part of this thing is not through the good times because we always opt in for the good time but is the is the tough moments is what a shape the character and the thing about it is brother Mikey nobody chooses the the the trial you know if you give somebody a sheet and say but Joo um pick the trial you want people will default to the easiest one I remember years ago there was a publication where a man say well Lord I want to pick a a a smaller cross to bear I don't ever saw that and say well go in the room and choose one and when he look around the room you see look what the smallest cross when he pick it up he say that same one you coming here wa I give you what you could handle you think you watch all the big CR taking the smallest one you said that the one they coming with because I giving you more than you could bear and he promised in he word to never give you more than you could bear it requires us to reframe our perspective that's the biggest thing you know when you could reframe your perspective you look at your home different you look at your life different you look at your situation different there was a study done of some of the most successful people on the Earth and they said the one common thing they found was in the midst of situations these people all believed there was a way they could get out of it it was not even about financial thinking it was nothing it was just the belief that there's a way out of the situation and if you look at your life your home your marriage your business there's a way out of this and we know the way God is the way if you have that brute Faith to say I don't care how Bleak it looks it's going to work out your whole outlook begins to change can I say that again you're not wondering oh gosh if it going to work out no it's going to work out the how is not even up to you God will give you the how you just have to believe my situation will change and when you said to walk like that you start to see Things fall into place and you never know how it go fall into place it is not up to you to figure out you how that's what God is he said cast your cares bring your thing to the altar cast all your burdens unto Jesus I said people come there cast their burden and then when God touch it fast enough they going and take it back up and carry it with them you bring your burd you leave it there you walk with faith you could fix your children give them to the Lord say Lord I give them to you you're not going to love any less you're not going to do any less but Lord is your problem to fix now you know because I can't fix it but I know you can so I'm trusting you to fix it put your right right words put me in right situation let them but I giving it to you to fix it because once the part the age of accountability now it's yours can the church say Amen so we're looking for our personal Revival where nobody have to crank us up you know when your car G in trouble you have to get a Kickstart some to bring a battery and they put it on the thing and thing and and Kickstart your vehicle some people every Sunday have to Kickstart them but when break into your own personal Revival you don't you don't need a kickart you started normal normal all the time on a Monday you're starting on a Tuesday you're starting on a Wednesday you're starting you can't leave your house without talking to God you can't leave your you can't enter a room without acknowledging him you say acknowledge Him in all your ways and he will direct your part it becomes a part of your DNA it becomes a part of your operation could you take some more we just have a few more services this year you know so we we want to get as much out of it the I'm not going to be too long with you from the message influence what we have seen happen should put every soul into action it should make a church that would make a Revival here in Phoenix and we see here in Trinidad that people would fly in from Europe to see what taking place they'd say there's a place in Arizona called the Maricopa Valley a city called Phoenix there's something broke out here until the seven tunders of Revelation 10 that's not even written in the Bible is being manifested Hallelujah it is the rising of the sun there's been churches churches bries Brides churches Brides brides but there has got to come one Hallelujah there has to come a real bride there must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the Dynamics of it makes the church live move in the power of his resurrection Hallelujah in the fourth seal page 304 God's word sharp two-edged sword slays him puts him right down under wait till them seven Thunders utter their voices to that group who can really take the word of God and hand it there there's two sides take the word of God and put it into action hand it there it'll slide and cut and they can close the heavens they can shut this or do that whatever they want to glory to God can the church say Amen you believe these promises you are expectation for God to use you as a vessel of Honor in this season and on in this [Music] time Hallelujah let's go a revivalist to revive the seeds as planted in you so seeds had to be planted that's why all these services and these meetings we have is to make sure seed is there because when the Revival come which is the rain comes it has it could only bring up the seed in you if the seed in you is foolishness it'll bring up foolishness but if the seed in you is the word itself it'll bring forth the life itself Hallelujah and the devil knows this so his only move has been to plan seeds of error Hallelujah seeds of Discord a seed of discrepancy seeds that can't bring forth the Life of Christ but the bride cannot be deceived Hallelujah I believe that we are sitting on a Ministry of prophetic Ministry a Ministry in this church where the right seeds are planted a seed that points to Perfection a seed that point to adoption a seed that says listen don't be comfortable there's more land to be taken there's more room at the cross there's more you have to do and the church sayen so God had to wait all these years and here we are at the end of 2024 I remember being in secondary school around the time of white and all these say I don't even think we'll make it past the year 2000 BR punch it's 2025 me here I said to somebody they used to say well there'll be some young ones to sweep it on to the coming of the Lord but T ter saying soon might be even able to say I'm that there's some younger ones coming to look at them younger ones now to Super because we getting older but there's a promise over us and God is operating a way that will make every man's word a lie and only his word stand up true people say all kind of stuff but God's word is the truth he he knows who exactly he wants in the Rapture he knows exactly who have to go that the the the when the bride comes into the Perfection they can bring on the resurrection listen nobody want to volunteer to be part of the Resurrection part had to come up in give somebody the choice they say no no no I want to be here you Rapture and God say well we need somebody to raise him so some SE had to go into the ground nobody want to be sick but everybody want go to be a Healer any volunteers nobody want to volunteer to be sick nobody want to volunteer to be dead to be part of the Resurrection but God had to choose in his Sovereign Grace how this whole plan unfolds but rest assured if God call for the Rapture there's no devil in hell going to stop you if God said you're going to be healed there's no devil in hell going to stop you if he said your family going to be delivered the Devil Himself cannot stop it can the church say Amen you can leave this service today shout him in joy and praise and worship knowing that he who started the work in you is more than able to complete it and if it started last year or 40 years ago he is still the same yesterday today and forever and he is still a way making God he's still a god of his word he is still a god of his promises Hallelujah so God have to wait all these years many people came into the message and they shouted and they jumped and they believed and they had quotes and they had testimonies and some of them they can't even see them in condemnation my representation but the B said no wonder God can't send a Revival he's got nothing to build it on then he take individuals because the the the thought was is a church is that church Ral there the angel is there this power is there but brother Bram saying here he's got nothing to build it on he'll take individuals and build it on them individuals and declare them not churches before the world who stay with that word Lord let me be one of those individuals who stay with the word that's what I want can I stay with the word can I live in this word can I be in the presence of God in this word so situations have to come to see if there would be individuals who would stay with the word hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah if you are not making plans with a Rapture what are you making plans for Hallelujah and I have it here in the notes but but Terence I say you need to have a plan to survive the tribulation please have it if you're not making preparation for the Rapture you have to have a tribulation survival plan but I can't believe God bring me to this message to be thinking about the tribulation we got to be prepared to do whatever it takes as for me and my house we will serve the Lord I'm prepared to pray to fast to seek to burn to clean to do whatever it takes because I want to make it in this process there will be different situation come up but we want to make it your children may not be happy but you say this is this house is a house of prayer this house is a house of God you want to do foolishness you could go somewhere else but this house we want to welcome the Holy Ghost in This House certain things have to happen certain things can't operate this way because this house is with the presence of God can the church say Amen could you take some more you can't have a ball game unless you get in the spirit of the ball game you've got to get in the spirit of it and we can never have a Revival in treport or anywhere else until the the church gets in the spirit of Revival God can come and perform Miracles he can show wonders he can stretch forth his hand to heal the sick and Afflicted the preacher can preach the gospel as hard as he can but there'll never be a Revival until the church gets in the spirit of revival can I can I read that code one more time that's in making a value full of ditches you can't have a ball game unless you get in the spirit of the ball game we preach this many times you know how terrible it is to be in a game and nobody responding it's a bat it's a goal it's a dunk whoever anybody there watching the player and all the want to play because when he play he shout he get anointed when they get out that scream you you want to do more because you're in the spirit of the game you get inspired you know people with you you know your team supporting you score a goal and and you're ready for the next one you're ready how we doing it you is a short window a time a game don't last forever is a 90minut game or whatever lat time and you're in the spirit you can't have a ball game unless you get in the spirit of the ball game you've got to get in the spirit of it we can never have Revival in stport or headstone Tabernacle until the church gets in the spirit of Revival he said God can come and perform Miracles he can show wonders he can stretch forth his hand to heal the sick and Afflicted the preacher can preach the gospel as hard as he can but there'll never be a Revival until the church gets in the spirit of Revival so come on Church let's get in the spirit of Revival not the spirit of church not the spirit of another service but a spirit of a Revival we going to have a Revival tell your brother your neighbor your sister when you see them we are going to have a Revival we are getting ready for Revival where's the Revival it's in me when we come together we are making the Revival happen every service is Revival we are leaving here on the platform of a Revival Give the Lord a shout of praise we're not leaving here depressed frustrated but barely make it in no we leaving here shouting we are leaving this place jumping we are leaving this place on fire you're going to leave this place with your foot and the devil's neck you're going to leave here bringing your children bring in your family you're going to leave here and give the doctor's reports back to the doctor you're going to leave here and say I'm Healed I can't explain it I don't know what happened but God but God but God that's the only explanation I can give you if it had not been for the Lord who was on my side can they give the Lord a shout of Praise oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah like that man when Jesus heal him they say who who heal you what what happened he say I don't know now don't sh t m all I know I was blind when I see don't ask me for the mechanics of it all I know I came to a meeting one night and my soul was right something got a hold of me Hallelujah I came to church I thought it was an ordinary service but something got a hold of me I was once was blind but now I could see I came in feeling kind of low but something came over me I came in feeling tired but something came over me I came in thinking about my family but something came over me it was the Holy Ghost it was the Holy Ghost it was the Holy Ghost a holy ghost Revival is a seventh Revival a seven Revival is a holy ghost Revival it's the Life of Christ pouring out himself in our midst him living moving breeding in and out of the church he's longing for a church he can walk in longing for a church where sin can stay in the church Hallelujah Give the Lord a hand of Praise Give the Lord a shout of Praise show the devil who side you on and show the Lord who side you on who's on the Lord's Side come with me who's on the Lord's Side worship with me who's on the Lord's Side start a Revival with me hallelujah we're going to start a Revival we're going to shake up our homes we're going to break the routine we're going to do something different if you normally lift one hand lift both hands if you normally Sal at level 10 go to level 20 today but let's do something we are digging a valley full of ditches let us dig a deep valley full of ditches because the rain is going to fall Healing Rain Revival rain [Music] Hallelujah you've got to believe it you've got to know it you got to claim your children you got to claim your family you got to claim your house you got to claim your healing take a valley this morning you may

room for the rain we're going to have enough rain for your children enough rain for your healing enough rain for your victory you may be seated Hallelujah the word is sharper than a two-edged sword but it take more than just the word alone because when you mix the word with faith and bring the word and the spirit now you have the enforcer moving with the word so when the word connects to someone it's a word and spirit coming together the word giving the platform for God and the spirit being the enforcer the same angel that worked with the prophet when the prophet left that angel never left because his commission was to set in order for the coming of the Lord can the church say amen and the angel of the Lord that great Angel is that manifestation of the Holy Spirit he's Leading the People back to Calvary Leading the People back to repentance Leading the People to the Holy Ghost itself Leading the People to forgiveness Leading the People to a change on the inner man not not a not

God wants you all by himself is you and God Alone in that secret place is you and God Alone Church Hallelujah Glory Glory Glory Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah Oh Glory I'm trying to p p the land hallelujah hallelujah may God break the worldly alliances may God break the worldly connections young people the people in the world cannot help you go where you are going the things of the world cannot get you where you need to go you got to break it you got to break the worldly Alliance you got to break the worldly fashion you got to wake the how you spend your time your worship belongs to God your time belongs to God your money belongs to God God your resources belong to God your talent belongs to God you are nothing without God it's all him Hallelujah you may be seated and you'll find out church if God is not in his place you'll find yourself in the desert a dry place can I say that one more time if God is not the object of your worship you'll find yourself in a dry place you'll find yourself wanting and empty unsatisfied and discouraged depressed and Forsaken and you look to the left and to the right and find no peace because God is not in his place you can make progress spiritually but if God is not the complete object of your worship you'll find yourself in a desert find yourself in a dry place without sustenance without water you know you can go for a a long time without food but water is only a few days without water you don't want to find yourself in the desert you don't want to find yourself cut off from God you are part of his family but you're cut off from God let me say that one more time you could be part of the family of God and cut off from God because you have lost your focus about putting God first may this be the last season where you have made that mistake of putting something else before him he said Thou shalt have no other gods before me but the brandom taught us your job could be a god your family could be your God money could be your God how whatever you could make anything of God the year is around 850 BC we are living in the time of the descendants of the King by this time the kingdom had been rent into two what King David left was destroyed as sing Solomon took over and his son after him implemented taxes we have taught this many times and the tax was seemed to burdensome so there was a division in the land the children of Israel and the kingdom of Judah and the Believers from The Tribe of Benjamin the Levites had separated themselves some with Israel and some with Judah the Prophet Elijah had already been taken up King Ahab and Jezebel was already off the scene and in 2 Kings 3:16 3 verse one rather now jehoram the son of Ahab and we all know how terrible Ahab was now jehoram the son of Ahab began to Reign Over Israel now we know the capital of Israel is Samaria Reign Over Israel and Samaria the 18th year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah so the divided Kingdom has two kingdoms two kings we have jehoram the son of Ahab over Israel and we have Jehoshaphat the king of Judah and Reign 12 years and King joham we read in verse two he wrote evil in the sight of the Lord but not like his father and like his mother so not like Ahab and Jezebel for he put away the image of ba that his father had made so this is the point I want to make even though he made progress in cleaning up the image of Bal God still saying he wrought evil and there are many of us we have put away some things but we have not put away all things you remember when we did the study of jeffa just the chapter before they rep they call upon the Lord to deliver and God said go to the gods you serve because he didn't see true repentance they say Lord forgive us help us save us he say I'm not doing it go to the god you servant because I keep delivering you and you keep doing foolish just go to them gods and then they the Bible says they put away the strange gods and it's only when he they put so in other words the first repentance was with strange gods they were repenting and they had strange Gods what are strange Gods strange clothes strange friends strange conversations Strange Music strange desires because anything taking it time is a form of worship are you with me what happened with when they lost the battle after Jericho he said don't touch their stuff and Aon take some clothes and a piece of gold showing the desire of man for money and the things associated with money and fashion and clothes and these things I say that was an accursed thing and because one man took it it affect the whole Army and what should have been a victory became a loss and men died because of not just Disobedience but the lust or desire in aon's heart push him to take something that God said is unclean so I want us to understand friends when we are looking for God to bless us we may be in a desert and not even realizing we're in a desert because there are cursed things with us because we have maintain and brother Anthony preached on it a few weeks ago this strange things a strange God brings strange incense so God is looking at it so I could imagine jehoram thought he's making progress because he put away Bal and some of us we put away what might be the surface level things we put away H going and drink and smoke and all these things but behind the scene there's still evil not and it may not be just music and clothes and all these things but even in our hearts lust and envy and animosity and gossip and hatred so there's the external there's also the internal which many times is even worse because nobody knows it's there backbiting and animosity all these and and we worship it you remember the man the the man who came into the church and the and the ministers ran off the platform and he came to the prophet and his the but BR said he'll fall over his feet and when they came the authorities asked him what what happened could he get help he said that man was worshiping the spirit that was upon him so the people who worship the god of their ideas the god of their imagination they are so caught up in their world and how they think things should be their whole world is wrapped up so here it is you have jehoram the Bible said he wrought evil in the sight of the Lord but not like his father and like his mother for he put away the image of B fathers and me as great nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jobo the son of nebat which made Israel to sin he departed not there from Brother bam speaking on this trying to find a place to land he said when they went to select them they got jerob his son and her son you couldn't expect very much to come out of a marriage like that so when we find out when Jan had ascended to the throne he was a borderline believer just a halfway lukew believer so many of them in the world tonight jehoram would set his sail and any way the wind was blowing that's the way jeam would go and that's the matter with the church tonight they set their sa to every form of Doctrine toss about from Pillar To Post not knowing where to stand or what to do and when the little Trials come up the little afflictions away they go this way their Methodist today Baptist tomorrow Pentecostal next day a Lutheran the next day 7 Day Adventist Jehovah witht they don't know where they stand tossed about borderline packing your church letter from one place to another what good does it do anyhow that's how bam described this King could you take some more are you with me verse four and Misha king of Moab was a sheep master and rendered unto the king of Israel 100,000 lambs and 100,000 Rams with W taxation right but it came to pass when Ahab was dead that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel and King jehoram went out of Samaria at the same time and numbered all Israel in other words he preparing for war you see how much men we have count them because now there's a rebellion in the camp and understanding this political unrest thank you brother Anthony he knows when he numbered them he clearly didn't have enough men to fight Moab so verse seven says and he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah saying the king of Moab had rebelled against me will thou go with me against Moab to battle in other words I need support and you have to realize friends there are some things in life you could never do alone you have to get some kind of support is not right and brother Olu in the message last week was speaking about it wasn't good for man to be alone that God wants us to be part of a community part of a family part of a body because that is part of The Human Experience there are some things you are able to achieve no company is a one there's no one man big company it doesn't exist a company made up of teams and departments and managers and all these things because to do anything great there has to be a community around it so King jehoram is sharp enough to know this Rebellion I cannot deal with it on my own but I have to get some support so he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah saying the king of Moab have rebelled against me will thou go with me against Moab to battle and he said this is Jehosaphat responded I will go up I am as Thou Art in other words I see you as my brother my people as thy people and my horses are thy horses so whatever supporting in other words I have your back brother Bram said though that in looking at this situation he said Jehosaphat was a righteous man but he said I want you to notice how easy it is sometimes on a little persuasion for a Christian to get in the wrong company trying to be a Pity in other words brother the BR is saying that Jehoshaphat in supporting jehoram wasn't even doing the right thing because God already had judgment over Israel so Jehosaphat trying to be a good brother was actually out of line because judgment was already over Israel Over the way they were living are you with me that's why but say compassion is not feeling sorry for people it's doing the will of God anybody with me I want to kind of skip through verse eight and he said which way shall we go up and he answered the way through the Wilderness of Edom so the king of Israel went jehoram and the king of Judah Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went I don't even know how Edom going make this thing because there in now gone from uh true believer in the type of Jehoshaphat to a make believer in the type of jehoram to the king of Edom who is a rank unbeliever but it's three of them in this war like a church in every church are three kind of Believers here we have a type of Jehoshaphat jehoram and the king of Edom I don't even think they name him but in every church have three kinds of Believers and in this Alliance which is important to have alliances you have two kind of Believers you have Jehoshaphat you have jehoram and the king of of Edom who we have no name for him but we just know he there so the king of Israel went and the king of Judah and the king of Edom and they fetch a compass of seven days journey and there was no water for the host and for the cattle that followed them and I want to pick up a point here this Alliance didn't even have a real plan because if you going into war brother George you need to count a scripture which man going to war when count he call before he go to war and see the army fight all these things how we can go into war with no water seven days journey and there was no water for the host and the C so they left without even a plan for the water so in other words whatever they were caught up in and saying let we go and fight them fellas even think the thing through and many times we approach situation in life without a plan and I said before God is not a rester he's a planner there are many quotes where say God is not halfhazard God not saying oops I make a I forget to give you something and I forget to do something he said I will give you everything you need to go and wherever you go Elijah there's a woman there she will feed you when it's time he send Ravens to feed him there's provision when in part of God there's no wonder about provision can I he will take care of you can I say that one more time when you're along the path that God wants you to walk there will be provision I'll skip through some history but Edom really come out of Esau line you know Esau was a whole project by itself so we we kind of skripture that I have all the scriptures here for that but I want to kind of reach a point here so when they realized water literally more than flour in this case they have no water the king of Israel said alas that the Lord had called these these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab now this here is a real interesting statement because here it is the king of Israel who is backsliding is saying alas is the Lord had called us together the Lord had nothing would call them together so you have people like to say but is the Lord brought me to this the Lord did not bring you there but yeah people like to talk this way but the Lord told me how you end up in problem the Lord did not take you there that's why there's a distinction between the trials you put yourself in and the Lord leading You Into the Wilderness this was not the Lord leading this was you in your emotion and your feelings and all these things end up in and say well is the Lord you know is the Lord who took us here and and and you have to be very careful with people who talk that way so the king of Israel said alas that the Lord had called these treat this this is them trying to comfort themselves three kings to deliver them into the hand of Moab but thank God for brother Jehoshaphat the One True Believer among them he said is there not here a prophet of the Lord because Joseph had realized listen this thing are going nowhere no man have a word from the Lord but if there is a man who has a word from the Lord because the prophet is the mouthpiece of God he said is there not here a prophet of the Lord that we may inquire of the Lord in other words Jehoshaphat take this man word for it he said there has to be I want to talk to the prophet it because this plan already fa you have to know where the plan fa and you need to get better help than what you had so far this is 2024 into 2025 looking at where you're at and realizing something needs to change he say is there not a prophet in here that we may inquire of the Lord because I want us to note up until this point there was no mention of prayer fasting seeking the will brother Anthony sang the song with Zig David said Lord they took my family he say shall I pursue in other words one thing that made David a man after God's Own Heart is he never move without first talking to the Lord he said Lord if you tell me to pursue I'm ready to go if it tell me to stay here I'm staying right here but not flying off the hand and doing what I want to do are you with me so what we see is a picture of three men Jehoshaphat with his nice good heart come to support his brother who contrary to begin with nobody pray about the matter nobody sought the Lord to see Lord is this what want us to do now after the fact is a you know in the pr world is a whole cleanup campaign is there is there not a prophet who we could talk to who could help fix this situation because here we are now Stranded the situation is dire they have no water if they don't get water in three days water but be men dead or no one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said here is Elisha the son of shaffat which poured water water on the hands of Elijah what about Spirit of Elijah is something else Elijah Elisha John the Baptist brother brandom Elijah to come this the spirit of Elijah is tiing this whole narrative here and Jehoshaphat said the word of the Lord is with him so the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom the unbeliever went down to him and Elisha said unto the king of Israel and this is to show you how God operates and how his servants operate because there is a prophet he say what I have to do with thee in other words you already reached here you already make it now you want to come to make it my problem what have I to do with the you're living with the desires of your own heart and now you're coming to me I want us to understand as we venture into 2025 it is important for you to seek the Lord before you make any moves can we hold to that truth and Elisha said unto the king of Israel what have I to do with the get thee to the prophets of thy father this song in just like it did in the Book of Judges go to the gods you serve go to the prophets you serve go to all them things you been feeding on because only when it look as if your life falling apart you want to run to church anybody with me we almost done I just want to make sure we close this point here what have I to do with thee get thee to the prophets of thy father and to the prophets of thy mother in other words the prophets of Ahab and Jezebel you know because many of us we see God God and church and as a thing of convenience we come to church because it's convenient it's it's something to do it's a it's really a religious spirit and here it is Elijah is identifying the religious spirit on jehoram saying go to the prophets who you have been serving what have I to do with thee and the king of Israel sent him n for the Lord you see again the king is speaking on behalf of the Lord without permission the Lord had called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab and Elisha rebota say as the Lord of host liveth before whom I stand surely were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah I would not look toward thee nor see thee in other words it's not the Lord have you here because if it wasn't for Jehoshaphat being in this room I walking out of here because God is not with this are we there this morning and I love how this ties here and this is the right time the musician could get ready now but in Scripture it says now bring me a Minstrel so elishah knew that in order to shift the atmosphere of what was wrong they had to get in the spirit of worship he said let's change that bring a Minstrel and it came to pass that when the minstrel played then the hand of the Lord came upon him in other words it took a period of worship and and anointing and because elishah at this point he had to he himself but the George had to get in the spirit to know because you bring him out from where he was at into a situation that God never sent him there officially so he said let's get in the atmosphere verse 16 and he said thus say the Lord make this Valley full of ditches for thus sayeth the Lord ye shall not see wind in other words it will not be something that's visible neither shall you see rain in other words I want you to know that is the Lord doing this and he is doing it yet that Valley shall be filled with water that you may drink both ye and your cattle and your beast and this is but a light thing in the sight of the Lord he will deliver the moabites also into your hand and he shall Smite every Fen City and every choice City and shall fell every good tree and stop all Wells of water and Mar every good piece of land with stones can the church say amen and we know that they had the victory so friends this is the closing part of this message here you got to dig a valley full of ditches because the rain is going to fall but the part here I want us to catch God could have just pour water on them go if God want to dig a dit he could do it himself you know but he was saying you have a work to do you have to make preparations because I'm going to bless you but you have a work to do when you're in trouble dig a valley full of ditches if you end up in a mess dig a valley full of ditches if you've lost your joy dig a valley full of ditches if you have no water dig a valley full of
