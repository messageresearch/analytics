[54:26] which are evil that was tried them which
[54:28] say the apostles that are not how
[54:30] beautiful the Savior praises and
[54:32] commment oh let me finish reading triy
[54:34] them which say the apostles are not and
[54:37] has found them liars and has born
[54:39] talking about the Believers and has
[54:41] patience and for my name's sake has
[54:43] labored and here this part and has not
[54:45] fainted I like that part there are too
[54:48] many people easy to faint don't faint
[54:50] because of what you're facing deal with
[54:52] it confront it you can't defeat Goliath
[54:56] if confront golad you have to confront
[54:58] your sickness your whatever issues in
[55:00] your mind whatever trial whatever
[55:02] testing confront it don't go and duck
[55:05] and hide and cover and cry and long
[55:06] tears that helping Faith helps not your
[55:10] tears do you get what I'm saying praise
[55:13] the name of the Lord how beautiful and
[55:15] the Savior praises and commends his
[55:17] children he takes into account their
[55:19] fine spiritual attitudes and behavior he
[55:21] knows that there is weakness among them
[55:23] as but as yet he does not cry out
[55:25] against it isn't is not just like our
[55:27] Lord he knows how to encourage Us in the
[55:29] right matters and discourage Us in the
[55:31] wrong matters we should all learn a good
[55:33] lesson right here in running the church
[55:35] and our families and better still we
[55:38] could all learn a good lesson in that
[55:40] God deals with each one of us exactly
[55:42] this way don't ever be discouraged saint
[55:45] of God did you hear that you in
[55:48] discouraging sat here this morning I
[55:49] give a word here for you don't ever be
[55:52] discouraged saint of God for God is not
[55:55] ungracious to to forget your labors of
[55:57] Love whatever we do even giving a cup of
[56:00] cold water to someone has a reward and
[56:03] blessing from the Lord I Know Thy Works
[56:05] labor and patience as he walks in the
[56:07] midst of his church he's aware of the
[56:09] suffering his people and he
[56:12] cares and it was in the days of
[56:14] captivity in Egypt when he he the cries
[56:16] he who never changes still hears the
[56:20] cries of the oppressed as he walks among
[56:22] them the very word labor signifies a a
[56:26] weariness through oppression God's
[56:29] people do not only work for him in labor
[56:31] of love but they suffer for him with joy
[56:34] there's a paradox suffering him with joy
[56:36] people don't want that suffer with him
[56:39] with joy but you suffer with him with
[56:41] joy and you know always preach how do we
[56:43] show our love to God by conducting
[56:45] ourselves with joy amidst the trials he
[56:47] in his wisdom sent our
[56:49] way that when they come in big man and
[56:52] big woman big Christian then when they
[56:54] can face a trial and up on the phone on
[56:57] on on new phone you're complaining
[57:00] you're complaining you're complaining
[57:01] you're complaining and complaining only
[57:02] weakens your faith you're telling Tom
[57:04] Dick Harry everybody else instead of
[57:07] saying Thank You Lord hallelujah you're
[57:08] going to work things out I trust you and
[57:11] like a child you promise a child a
[57:13] sweetie a a chocolate or what that they
[57:15] believe you and you better bring that
[57:18] chocolate when you come you know because
[57:19] you hear a whole lot of crying about it
[57:22] so that is the same Simplicity in which
[57:24] God want you to release your faith and
[57:26] trust him because if ever there was a
[57:28] time you had to trust God is coming down
[57:30] to this time here now if you feel you
[57:32] burn out that drama about to start so
[57:35] get Bly if there ever a time you need to
[57:37] trust God is the time that's coming out
[57:40] you see the Bank Lower how much us could
[57:42] buy everybody think from us next just
[57:44] don't go be
[57:47] food don't say Amen now is a belly we
[57:50] talking about now some people serious
[57:52] about that very very
[57:54] serious do you what I'm saying it's it's
[57:58] it's a nice time coming on you know a
[58:00] trying time coming on you know and you
[58:02] have to have a triumphant Faith listen a
[58:05] triumphant fith to deal with what is
[58:08] coming on so don't back down now
[58:11] hallelujah praise God so listen to this
[58:14] now he says now the the
[58:17] uh they are patient in being the Yoke
[58:20] this first AE suffered Grace persecution
[58:22] you had to work hard to preach the
[58:24] gospel shed forth truth the the high
[58:26] calling in life was to serve God and
[58:28] when their hopes in life were blighted
[58:30] they were patient and committed all to
[58:32] him there's not you fighting and
[58:34] wrestling with God you see you you
[58:36] commit things to him and you expect you
[58:38] want this to work out but it doesn't
[58:39] work out so praise God God knows best so
[58:42] you commit everything to the hands of
[58:43] God you you you want this you want that
[58:45] and what not that's why we talk about
[58:47] seeking first the kingdom put your heart
[58:49] on the spiritual things and natural
[58:51] things would follow you and you could
[58:53] take that seek first the kingdom and tie
[58:55] that in with Psalms 1 blessed a man who
[58:58] walked not under the counil of The Godly
[59:00] stands in the way of Sinners nor sit in
[59:01] the seat of the scornful but his Delight

[59:23] an assurance that if you take this and

[59:27] come and trap you and then trap you

[1:06:23] upright a Christian is before public how
[1:06:25] gracious he is to his fellow man doing
[1:06:27] not but good let him confess Christ as
[1:06:29] his Savior and acknowledge the gifts of
[1:06:31] the holy spirit in tongues and prophecy
[1:06:33] and healing Miracles it will be
[1:06:35] condemned the spirit of this world hates
[1:06:38] the spirit of God because it can't
[1:06:41] overcome the spirit of the Lord it tries
[1:06:43] to destroy the vessel in whom the spirit
[1:06:45] of Truth
[1:06:47] dwells here we go it's just background
[1:06:50] we start preacher it persecution and
[1:06:52] trials are natural normal part of the
[1:06:55] Christian
[1:06:56] Life that sound like 30% say Amen
[1:06:59] natural
[1:07:01] normal that is supposed to be part of
[1:07:03] your journey persecution and
[1:07:06] trials hallelujah praise God praise God
[1:07:09] Amen talk about trust this man right
[1:07:12] here St on a bus bust up I have no money
[1:07:14] to go inside the
[1:07:16] bus because he going to service this man
[1:07:18] standing right there Michael Black when
[1:07:21] he bus stops say come I pay for you
[1:07:23] explain that
[1:07:26] this is not no joke you know this not we
[1:07:27] not cracking jokes this morning you know
[1:07:29] this is real testimony you know stand up
[1:07:32] by the bus stop with no money but going

[1:07:46] they coming but they don't know how
[1:07:46] they're going

[1:07:57] so listen to this persecution trials are
[1:07:58] natural normal part of the Christian
[1:08:00] Life there's only one thing you can do
[1:08:02] about them commit them all to God judge
[1:08:07] not and leave the outworking and final
[1:08:10] judgment to him praise be to Jesus I'm
[1:08:13] going to just skip all of that all right
[1:08:15] let's go we going to start
[1:08:18] now in the last
[1:08:21] days but no Jesus said you you say that
[1:08:24] against me it be forgiven you because
[1:08:26] they were Jews but otherwise in the last
[1:08:28] days when the Holy Ghost comes upon the
[1:08:32] Gentiles one word against it will never
[1:08:35] be forgiven in this world nor the world
[1:08:38] to

[1:09:05] about the Judgment time that is about to
[1:09:07] come and things people say and how it
[1:09:10] will hit them back hard that why you say
[1:09:12] let your word go out with kindness
[1:09:13] sometime you have to eat it
[1:09:17] back I see people mash up the whole
[1:09:19] fames with their

[1:49:07] this meeting I am wanted to happen now
[1:49:10] that the anointing will strike the whole
[1:49:12] church why these mystery PR preachers

[1:49:19] are MTH here that the anointing will
[1:49:22] strike the whole church you see the
[1:49:24] reason they don't touch this is because
[1:49:25] they they don't control
[1:49:28] this they could preach text but this is
[1:49:31] the prophecy here that the anointing
[1:49:33] will
[1:49:34] strike the whole Church of the Living
[1:49:38] God and she will rise to her feet not
[1:49:41] sit

[1:49:49] fly no praising God you just like a
[1:49:51] flatting a fly

[1:50:21] dead will be raised up and the power of
[1:50:23] God will shake the world with the Church
[1:50:25] of the Living God I am supposed to look
[1:50:28] for that and I have to look for people
[1:50:30] who agree with that and want that too

[1:55:12] right now you talk about SE T smell the
[1:55:16] flesh the outer Court the inner courts
[1:55:19] we have the next altar I have conscience
[1:55:21] imagination memory passion affection
[1:55:24] five senses of the flesh which is the
[1:55:26] human the flesh the body then five
[1:55:28] senses of the spirit the inner court and
[1:55:30] so like that right we got three gates he
[1:55:33] said now that is where your per Holiness
[1:55:35] and Methodist stayed on the altar out
[1:55:37] there now watch lutherans go back and
[1:55:39] forth in the flesh here come P Holiness
[1:55:42] but that light ran out he's talking
[1:55:43] about pressing into the most holy Place
[1:55:45] let's go now remember there was a veil
[1:55:48] that hand between the holy and the
[1:55:50] holiest of holies in the holiest of
[1:55:53] holies is where Christ come to sit down
[1:55:57] on your heart's
[1:55:58] Throne Christ is enthroned he comes
[1:56:02] through justification sanctification by
[1:56:05] one spirit and here we all baptized into
[1:56:08] one body which is the body of Christ by
[1:56:10] what Holy Spirit who comes in Methodist
[1:56:13] Baptist pres Pentecost whosoever will
[1:56:16] that Veil you know what that Veil is
[1:56:20] listen that Veil veils your heart from
[1:56:23] it are you ready I'm still reading the
[1:56:25] veil is called
[1:56:30] self-will and that's why I say you have
[1:56:33] to be intentional about what you want to
[1:56:36] do and how you want to live it's not a
[1:56:40] matter of just doing it you have to be
[1:56:43] intentional here it is to break from
[1:56:45] your the second Court into the place
[1:56:49] that place where you're getting the
[1:56:51] shadow of the Almighty
[1:56:52] that hiding place to break into that
[1:56:55] hiding place is your
[1:56:57] own
[1:56:59] self-will you have to will to do God's
[1:57:06] will so that's why people love to put it
[1:57:08] on the pastor or the preacher or the
[1:57:10] priest because when they put it on that
[1:57:12] man they have nothing to do it's the
[1:57:15] priest he sprinkle he put He dust ashmen
[1:57:18] and so on he do all of that and you
[1:57:20] blame the priest but God saying is your
[1:57:23] will you have to want to be
[1:57:26] adopted not
[1:57:28] hope you have to want to be a better man
[1:57:32] that's what God told he said he said
[1:57:34] Samuel don't forget about Saul I
[1:57:37] found a better man you have to want to
[1:57:41] be a better woman a better mother a
[1:57:44] better father a better
[1:57:50] wife you will you don't want to be a
[1:57:52] baby maker there someone just put on
[1:57:54] baby just put on child put on child put
[1:57:56] on child them is baby mother they are
[1:57:58] not
[1:58:00] mothers you want to know you're raising
[1:58:02] your child unto God to do that you have
[1:58:05] to go beyond you if you're not ready for
[1:58:07] motherhood don't get married when you
[1:58:09] get married have a child you have to
[1:58:10] raise that child unto God some people
[1:58:13] raise the child and say of age you know
[1:58:14] I I not responsible no more they
[1:58:17] 18 never was Mother Mother they just
[1:58:20] happen to have a child and child get
[1:58:21] bigger and say
[1:58:22] you know I mean not my responsibility no
[1:58:28] more and for this call shall a man leave
[1:58:30] his mother and father and cling to
[1:58:32] that who is
[1:58:34] that some rougher who ra that who raised
[1:58:41] that we have to raise up Sons to be
[1:58:45] men courageous Men original men now they
[1:58:50] want to e feminize men
[1:58:56] want to make men
[1:58:58] Gish but God said let us make man in our
[1:59:00] image like
[1:59:02] us God is the original designated of
[1:59:05] that woman getting more pushy and
[1:59:10] forward s inside of here that manly
[1:59:14] spirit and that argumentative and that
[1:59:16] rudess and thing God make that you know
[1:59:18] as a perversion of the original you know
[1:59:21] Hallelujah
[1:59:22] the veil is called self-will do you get
[1:59:25] the picture now the senses out there the
[1:59:28] senses on the body the senses to the
[1:59:30] soul the veil between that and the holy
[1:59:32] place the holiest of holies is self-will
[1:59:35] so Paul said I bring my body into
[1:59:38] subjection least after I have preached I
[1:59:41] become a
[1:59:44] c so Paul arrested his desires
[1:59:53] I wonder if everybody hearing this this
[1:59:55] morning I find the amen getting lighter
[1:59:56] and lighter and lighter you know are
[1:59:58] coming home to
[2:00:02] you I coming to your
[2:00:04] house all right okay so watch notice
[2:00:09] when the high priest once a year entered
[2:00:11] into the first Veil the second Veil out
[2:00:13] of the lavers where they washed the
[2:00:14] sacrifice the sacrifice was killed I'm
[2:00:16] going to skip and then to the hems of
[2:00:17] His Garment he had pomegranate then a
[2:00:19] bell and he walked so perfect until the
[2:00:21] Bells say holy holy unto the Lord what
[2:00:24] we need today is not whether we are
[2:00:26] assemblies or Church of God or Oneness
[2:00:28] our walk ought to be plain to the public
[2:00:30] holy holy unto the Lord you're not
[2:00:33] acting because you come to headone
[2:00:35] Tabernacle you're acting because you
[2:00:36] love God and you believe the word and
[2:00:38] your walk is Holy Holy unto the Lord
[2:00:41] that's what your walk another thing he
[2:00:43] must be anointed before he goes in the
[2:00:45] anointing oil was made of the Rose of
[2:00:47] Sharon the crushing of the Rose brought
[2:00:49] forth the perfume and put it on the oil
[2:00:52] that run along aon's beard plumped Hem
[2:00:53] of His skirt covered up with the
[2:00:55] anointing oil walking right living right
[2:00:58] moving right dressed right and there he
[2:01:01] went taken before him the blood and he
[2:01:03] went behind the curtain into the third
[2:01:05] room there was a veil that dropped
[2:01:06] behind him and the outside world could
[2:01:08] not see him no more are you ready the
[2:01:11] very man or boy or woman or girl that is
[2:01:15] ever anointed of God and Walks Behind
[2:01:18] that veil of God the Holy Ghost puts him
[2:01:20] in a secret place the veil drops behind
[2:01:23] him and the world and all of its things
[2:01:25] are cut off from behind him so once that
[2:01:28] Veil Dro behind you the world is cut off
[2:01:32] shout out cut off Shout again cut off
[2:01:35] the world is cut off because that Veil
[2:01:38] drop behind you give the Lord some
[2:01:41] Praises do you see how it's supposed to
[2:01:43] be so if the world sticking onto you and
[2:01:45] it's sticky sticky sticky you're not be
[2:01:47] the veil yet because once they get
[2:01:48] behind the veil the world is
[2:01:54] he the BMB now he the BM Oh God help us

[2:02:00] that we are holding up the adoption of
[2:02:03] God wo but the punch is a big one listen
[2:02:07] listen listen as our difference of life
[2:02:10] and fussing and quarreling among one
[2:02:12] another is the reason the veil can't
[2:02:15] drop behind us and we can go into that
[2:02:17] presence of
[2:02:19] God adoption is being held up by
[2:02:23] Behavior it's an individual Affair
[2:02:25] between every Minister how a minister
[2:02:26] ought to get alone to himself even
[2:02:28] before he preaches before he prays
[2:02:30] before he does anything he should get
[2:02:32] alone with God in that quiet Hiway place
[2:02:34] with God praise God sure they eat Mana
[2:02:38] out there but they didn't know about
[2:02:40] this have you my dear brother don't
[2:02:42] despite my ignorance I want to ask you
[2:02:43] something Have you ever come to a place
[2:02:45] in life where Christ meant more than you
[2:02:47] than all arguing you could do about your
[2:02:49] church has Christ meant more more to you
[2:02:52] than all the world I don't mean from an
[2:02:54] emotion or mental workup I mean from the
[2:02:57] depths of your heart that something
[2:02:59] settling there something taking place
[2:03:02] and you don't know how it come but
[2:03:03] you're hid away listen your whole motive
[2:03:06] is to serve Jesus Christ have you
[2:03:08] entered that place my dear brother have
[2:03:11] you come into that place where you don't
[2:03:13] care what anyone says not to go out and
[2:03:15] act smart but till you love of God so
[2:03:18] anchored in you that you can't see
[2:03:20] nothing else your whole motive is to do
[2:03:22] the will of God to love for everybody
[2:03:24] flowing free from everywhere you want to
[2:03:26] live in that place you want a place to
[2:03:28] live that hidden place that's the place
[2:03:31] where we got to come into that's the
[2:03:33] place that God Reveals His secret things
[2:03:35] that's the place where God does the
[2:03:36] placing and the calling oh my Lord my
[2:03:40] Lord my Lord that's the place where God
[2:03:43] do the placing in the calling not some
[2:03:45] Minister some convention saying you are

[2:04:06] cool feeling God has refresh his Earth
[2:04:09] fragrance did you ever come in the Rose
[2:04:10] Garden the honeysuckle don't smell much
[2:04:12] along the heat of the day but early in
[2:04:14] the morning when all the air has been
[2:04:16] purified the ARA of the honeysuckle let
[2:04:18] a man be out fussing fighting stewing
[2:04:20] and you will never never get much of an
[2:04:22] aroma from that of the Gospel let him
[2:04:24] get alone one time in the Stillness of
[2:04:25] God and he said every man that come to
[2:04:27] the pulpit ought to dwell alone with God
[2:04:30] first then comes the fruits healing
[2:04:32] fruits every man that stays in the
[2:04:34] presence of God into this great secret

[2:04:46] that land of
[2:04:47] adoption oh so there's a place in that
[2:04:51] places where that's the third pull I

[2:05:11] secret and he reward you openly amen
[2:05:13] acts 5:14 to 15 says and the Believers
[2:05:15] were added were more added to the Lord
[2:05:17] mlu both men and women in so much that
[2:05:20] they brought forth the sick into the
[2:05:22] streets and they laid them on beds and
[2:05:24] couches that at least the shadow of
[2:05:27] Peter passing by might overshadow some
[2:05:30] of them praise God and they were healed
[2:05:33] Oh Glory to God isn't that something
[2:05:36] here and B saids look here he taking
[2:05:38] Peter James John hope faith and charity
[2:05:40] don't you see those gifted people then
[2:05:42] hope faith charity Hope was in James he
[2:05:45] was the one who set the church in order
[2:05:46] Faith was in Peter and charity was in
[2:05:48] John hope faith and charity it was God's
[2:05:51] representative on the earth and the
[2:05:53] people laid in Peter's Shadow and were
[2:05:55] healed oh friends don't think I'm
[2:05:57] yelling at you friends you might think
[2:05:59] I'm excited but I'm not I'm trying to
[2:06:01] get my point to you close enough to you
[2:06:04] you to see what I'm talking about oh
[2:06:06] praise God so then Along come the
[2:06:08] Pentecost with the baptism of the Holy
[2:06:10] Ghost and narrow it down by receiving
[2:06:12] the Holy Ghost that's right now that
[2:06:14] begins to shake down the gifts the
[2:06:15] resurrection and the spirit of God has
[2:06:17] come in the fullness of signs and
[2:06:19] wonders into the church and shook
[2:06:20] Pentecost what did is it here we go we
[2:06:23] are so close to the coming of the Lord
[2:06:25] Jesus until the very spirit that was in
[2:06:28] him is working in the church doing the
[2:06:31] very same thing he did when he was here
[2:06:33] on Earth it never been anywhere back
[2:06:35] from the time of the Apostles till this
[2:06:37] time why it Narrows Narrows what is it
[2:06:40] then he says this here just like your
[2:06:42] hand coming into a shadow negative
[2:06:45] negative what is it it's a reflection so
[2:06:47] you say a shadow you put your hand well
[2:06:49] I can't show it here but there's a
[2:06:50] shadow and the shadow is a reflection of
[2:06:53] the hand it's negative the shadow is a
[2:06:56] negative so watch this now it's a
[2:06:58] reflection what is Luther a reflection
[2:07:01] of Christ what is Wesley a reflection of
[2:07:03] Christ now we are at the end time they
[2:07:06] know the church was to receive power
[2:07:08] that would work in the church the same
[2:07:09] works of Christ because the shadow
[2:07:11] becomes deeper and deeper and deeper so
[2:07:13] as your hand get closer to the shadow it
[2:07:14] getting closer to be one do you get it
[2:07:17] now the shadow is coming it's coming to
[2:07:19] a reality negative negative negative and
[2:07:22] cut neck with the hand is positive all
[2:07:24] right they know the church was to
[2:07:26] receive power that would work in the
[2:07:28] church because as the shadow becomes
[2:07:30] deeper and deeper reflects more you take
[2:07:32] a shade further away from the shade the
[2:07:34] least reflection you get of the shade
[2:07:36] after a while the shades get closer and
[2:07:38] closer to the tree and the shade is the
[2:07:40] same thing now the spirit of God that
[2:07:43] work under justification under Luther
[2:07:45] Wesley performing the Holy Ghost under
[2:07:47] Works under Pentecost the church and
[2:07:49] Christ become one and soon they connect
[2:07:52] together the last link she will go to
[2:07:54] the sky shouting up will come Wesley
[2:07:57] Luther all the rest of them back in
[2:07:59] those days we are the end time here we
[2:08:01] go they don't want to get to that is
[2:08:03] what the Holy Ghost does the Holy Ghost
[2:08:05] by justification a light shadow of it
[2:08:07] the Holy Ghost by sanctification a
[2:08:09] little deeper shadow of it the Holy
[2:08:11] Ghost by baptism a deeper Shadow now the
[2:08:14] Holy Ghost by the restoration of his
[2:08:16] very person in here oh glory to God the
[2:08:21] this is beautiful he called Luther a
[2:08:23] shadow Wesley a shadow Pentecost a
[2:08:26] shadow but he called this here what the
[2:08:29] restoration of the person in here
[2:08:31] performing signs and wonders like you
[2:08:34] dig got Give the Lord some
[2:08:38] Praises could you take some more this
[2:08:42] ministry will end soon talking about his
[2:08:45] ministry and the expected son will
[2:08:48] appear himself yes
[2:08:52] amen the church has come through
[2:08:54] justification through Luther
[2:08:56] sanctification through the WAN enter the
[2:08:59] Bap where he goes through the
[2:09:00] Pentecostal and now winding up to The
[2:09:04] Headstone
[2:09:05] Ministry oh give the Lord some
[2:09:08] Praises so the prophecy is to come up to
[2:09:11] the headstone Ministry the stone that

[2:09:24] up to The Headstone Ministry typing all
[2:09:27] the time right here into that perfect
[2:09:28] negative Shadow becoming positive then
[2:09:32] Jesus Will Come and catch this church
[2:09:34] someday those who believe it separate
[2:09:37] yourself from unbelief oh praise God so
[2:09:42] listen to this friends hallelujah
[2:09:45] hallelujah the world is heading for a
[2:09:47] funeral service and the bride is heading
[2:09:49] for a wedding supper three and a half
[2:09:52] years of Darkness three and a half years
[2:09:54] of Hell on the earth three and a half
[2:09:56] years shadowed by the tribulation and
[2:09:58] the bride is being shadowed with the
[2:10:01] coming of the Lord under a condition of
[2:10:04] abiding in Christ he that have my word
[2:10:07] he that believeth on me and so on he
[2:10:09] that abides in me and my word in him

[2:13:16] brother Bram drilled Down Deeper through
[2:13:19] his sacrificial death at Calvary and his
[2:13:22] resurrection positionally places Church
[2:13:25] in that realm that the same invisible
[2:13:28] God could come into

[2:13:38] God could come into you and make his

[2:14:10] that and I wish you could see that too
[2:14:14] so but I'm talk about Sin couldn't stay
[2:14:15] in the church like anas a the spirit
[2:14:18] will quickly call it out no matter what
[2:14:20] it is how little it will be done see
[2:14:22] woman men sitting here under the power
[2:14:24] of the Holy Spirit the spirit of God
[2:14:25] moving perfectly moving this someone
[2:14:27] done something wrong in the congregation
[2:14:29] they would come quickly and confess it
[2:14:30] before the spirit got a hold of it to
[2:14:32] confess it before they come and tell it
[2:14:33] because they know right then it's going
[2:14:35] to be called so then that operation is
[2:14:37] the holy spirit operation calling things
[2:14:40] out that's not a man that's discernment
[2:14:42] dropping down when Peter came to the man
[2:14:44] at the gate called Beautiful he said
[2:14:45] perceive you are Faith to be healed so
[2:14:48] Peter could actually feel the power of
[2:14:49] faith in that man rise up and walk in
[2:14:51] the name of Jesus Christ hold the man up
[2:14:54] and pull him up and the man begin to
[2:14:55] walk not just walk he's had to jump and
[2:14:57] leap everybody know the man was
[2:15:00] that was a shocker and when them demons

[2:29:35] horrible disease of
[2:29:36] tuberculosis and the little girl she
[2:29:38] done the muing the cooking the washing
[2:29:40] taking care of her mother while the rest
[2:29:42] of them Loof around and played and went
[2:29:44] swimming finally her mother died and
