well as anyone under the sound of my voice tonight in this room maybe you have a physical need maybe you have a spiritual need maybe you have a family need maybe you have a financial need i think we all come here tonight because we have some kind of a need and we want to acknowledge the fact that god is more than able to meet us at the point of our need and our needs are nice so shall we pray gracious heavenly father we thank you for your love for your mercy for your grace lord that there's nothing we could have ever done could do tonight or will ever do lord that would qualify us to deserve anything from you lord we could only connect to you and we could only show forth a measure of love to you because you first loved us lord it's so many things we have to go through in life to come to an appreciation of what love really is because you are love and we come tonight because there's a gap between the way we live and the way you want us to live and the more we close that gap is the deeper of an understanding of this great mystery of love as it unfolds to us lord just as it were lord walking into your into your presence lord lord to see the the fire and the lord the seraphims and the angels in your presence lord to come into contact with you and to know father that we are nothing lord that great prophet isaiah as the prophet would say will come into your presence father and recognize who is me so we come tonight father in a war is me mindset and condition knowing that lord we are a needy people we're in need of a touch tonight we are in need of our understanding to be opened we are in need of healings lord physical healings mental healings healings for different situations and lordy acknowledging that we can open the doors of our hearts and our lives and our situations and to allow you to walk freely in so we welcome you tonight into our presence we welcome you tonight into our homes via this medium as it were lord to break from lord this dimension of technology lord to allow your holy spirit to move farther because if two shall agree touching anything we could have whatever we ask for so we unite tonight father as one mind as one people lord having a purpose and an objective lord for you to speak to our hearts so we can leave this meeting tonight better christians better men better women better sons better daughters so father may you lord walk all the pages of the bible lord and help each one those are already here those that may join on the way father we are so grateful the lord that we have come to know each other and more importantly come to know you father by the revelation that you are placed in our hearts father your century a prophet the message would fall into the hands of the predestinated and father we are so grateful tonight lord for the opening of the word this revealed word this fought light as it were that opens our understanding to every scripture that we could go into the wood tonight and lord be encouraged with an insight that theologians still debate about so father may you speak to us tonight and help us along the way take me out of the way in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen and amen certainly like to greet one on all tonight in the precious name of our lord and savior jesus christ uh we don't take it for granted uh to be able to come together like this and it's it's every time we come together it is a great privilege it is a great honor to be able to come together and fellowship around the word of god looking for us to get stronger and to grow and sometimes it's for reproof sometimes it's for encouragement sometimes it's for teaching sometimes it's for admonition but it's all love and it's god's love expressed to us in different ways so that we could see either true characters in scripture or through words shared in different ways that we could be better christians you know and time is is swiftly moving on and we see the world events and and these things and and and uh as beloved would have preached i believe was last week or so um the issue is not what's happening around us the real issue is what's happening in us i want to say that one more time the issue is not what's happening around us the issue is what's happening um in us you know you know and i i initially had a thought for tonight um you know kind of meditating and then only late this evening you know the lord showed me something and i want to kind of go into that um a bit tonight but i do want to kind of speak sometime soon on this topic of of being alone and dealing with the issue of who you are when no one else is around i think it's something that we need to kind of talk about a little bit you know we talk about jacob being left alone you know away from family and support systems and these things and i've come to a deep realization that real christianity is really when nobody else is there you know when nobody who could hold you accountable because a lot of us we are held to a level of accountability by people around us be it on the workplace sometimes it's the rules on the job holders to an account and if the rule makers on the job are no longer there then you do things any way you want because the the the lawmakers as it who are not there you know so if you are at office late in the evening and nobody is there and you decide to put your foot in the microwave or decide to do some craziness because you know nobody there watching that is who you are a foot in microwave person you know you have to understand what is inside of you that drives you you know and then i had another question tied to that can you live with yourself can you live with you you know brother branham said when he was speaking about you know i'll give you a new heart i'll give you a new spirit and i'll put my spirit in you he made a really powerful statement along the lines of you have to get a new heart and a new spirit because he says you can't even get along with yourself you say you can't even get along with your neighbor how we could even get along with god and he brought this powerful type to be able to relate to god that's why you have to get a new heart a new spirit and he places his spirit inside of you you can't say because i know you say you cannot get along with god you can't get along with your neighbor and he said you kind of get along with yourself and sometimes we don't spend time really thinking about it and and realizing that sometimes you having a war with yourselves you know you kind of agree with your own self this we're not dealing with the yv husband nature and the co-worker the neighbor we may be delivering we're dealing with and you can't even agree with you one day you ask somebody to you the other day you are somebody else to you you know so we'll spend some time on that at some other point but tonight by the grace of god i have a thought i want to share um to encourage you a little bit you know and the title for tonight is we faint not we faint not we feint not and i want to start just by background i'm not going to be too long with you but i want to start in isaiah 40 if you will isaiah 40. and the bible says isaiah 40 has thou not known it's a question in other words you don't know this has thou not known has thou not heard that the everlasting god the lord the creator of the ends of the earth fainted not so it is impossible for the everlasting god the lord the creator of the ends of the earth it is impossible for him to fiend neither is he wary there is no searching for his understanding and then the scripture goes on in verse 29 he give it power to the fiend and to them that have no might he increase its strength and then the bible goes on even the youth shall faint and be wary the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be wary they shall walk and not faint we will notice that in each of these four verses of scripture there's this mentioning of this word fainting see in the first scripture you read isaiah 40 28 it speaks of the everlasting god the law the creator of the ends of the earth that it is impossible for him to faint and then the next verse talks about giving power to defense and the word faint is titled losing consciousness so somebody fiends when they lose consciousness or you're about to feel and faint you're losing your sense of awareness you lose your sense of where you're at if you ever experience somebody you feel in somebody ask them they ask you what happened because they lost consciousness and they and they might lose cut just for a minute a few seconds a few minutes but the reality is in that period when you lose consciousness you're not aware of your surroundings you're not aware of your you lose control over your body so somebody who faints it's a it's a very delicate thing because some people faint and they fall in a bad way and they and they hit their head and they hurt themselves in different ways fainting is also a separation or detachment for what's happening present tense you get disconnected you shut yourself off your you separate yourself from the consciousness of being aware of what's happening right now and the next verse you read even the youth challenge and the youth is supposed to be representing strength and representing fitness and representing health so the even the youths the way it is presented is like a shocking discovery that even the youth will faint so it's not just a matter of you being tired and you're wary and he disconnected and you end up seeing well i've given up but even the youth shall have their struggles so i want you to put that faint as in giving up losing consciousness no longer being aware you're feeling so tired that you want to get disconnected and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up the wings as eagles they shall run and not be wary they shall walk and many reinforces and will not fit and i want to use it as a background to us tonight to now use the words of paul in corinthians to speak about we faint not in other words i want to type this fainting as losing consciousness giving up being disconnected having a sense of of your you don't want to deal with the situation at hand so you faint and there are many people that come to church and they're really in a condition where they are fainted you know they're really not participating because you know when when you're faint you're you're just not president your body could be there but if you're feeding your body there but you're not hearing what's going on you're not seeing what's going on you're not aware of what's going on and it's a dangerous state to be because one of the reasons people faint is because they say oxygen not reaching into your to to your brain your your kind of a circulation issue all of these things contribute to you feeling faint maybe you didn't eat properly all these things affect you that leads you to being faint but i want to go to second corinthians 4 and for the bulk of our time tonight we'll spend time here tonight we faint not paul is speaking in second second corinthians 4 therefore seeing we have received this ministry do you believe tonight we have received a ministry do you believe you're called for ministry do you believe you're called for a purpose therefore seeing we have received this ministry as we have received mercy we faint not so paul is saying because we have received this ministry because we have received mercy we faint not so it means that fainting giving up losing consciousness zoning out not wanting to confront the issues of life as a believer is not an option for us because compared to what isaiah is saying about men will faint and these things paul is now saying we faint not he's now speaking to those who have received this ministry this is not being addressed to every and anybody he is specifically dealing with we who have this ministry and we have received mercy we faint not we are not going to give up we are not going to backslide we are not going to throw in the towel we are not going to separate we are not gonna run and hide from these situations we faint not but this is what we have done we have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not working in craftiness nor handling the word of god deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of god i want to read these first two verses in the amplified so we can kind of understand what paul is trying to bring out here therefore since we have this ministry just as we receive mercy from god granting us salvation opportunities and blessings we do not get discouraged so i wanted to see that this word fiend that we're reading here in the amplified it now brings some more light to where we're going now we do not get discouraged nor lose our motivation so that is what is meant by we faint not because many times believers get discouraged believers lose their motivation anybody with me tonight you lose easier for fighting it's not that you don't believe it's not that you don't want to make it it's not that you have doubt in your heart but sometimes you just feel a little down you feel a little discouraged you feel a little tired you feel a little bit wary but here's saying we do not get discouraged nor lose our motivation so it forces us to reframe or have a paradigm shift as it were about how we approach things because once we understand this ministry we can't allow ourselves to get demotivated we can't allow situations to get under our skin so much that we don't want to do what we're supposed to do verse 2 but we have renounced the disgraceful things hidden because of sheep not walking in trickery or adulterating the word of god but by stating the truth openly and plainly we commend ourselves to everyone's conscience in the sight of god powerful let's go verse 3. but if our gospel be hid it is head to them that are lost that's a powerful statement i want to read that one more time but if our gospel be hit it is hit to them that are lost in the amplified but even if our gospel is listen to this in some sense hidden behind a veil it is hidden only to those who are perishing i want to unpack this a little bit are you hiding your testimony because paul is declaring that his gospel his message his life his ministry is on display that anybody could see it except those who are not allowed to see it those that are lost are the ones who are blinded from seeing it but those who are allowed to see it should see it anybody with me it reminds me about open preaching when you go into our workplace you throw your hatchet you throw your your your your grenade because you want a testimony you want to to bring yourself to an accountability that you're living for something and one of the challenges we face now is people don't want to live for anything but here it is paul is comfortable to say but if our gospel is hid it is hit to them that are lost in whom the god of this world had blinded the minds of them which believe not in and i want to say just friends and this here should be a place where you begin to thank god for even being here and seeing this because paul is saying the god lowercase g which is satan of this world had blinded the minds of them which believed not in other words they can't even believe if they wanted to because they have been blinded they could never see the truth you could explain it you could preach it you could show them you could but they will never see it because they have been blinded aren't you glad your eyes are open tonight and you glad that i saw from the presence of god has been placed upon me that he could see that it's a separation between this natural world and a supernatural world that you are really a supernatural being that comes from god and going back to god and there's a supernatural god operating through supernatural people many people so caught up in news and science and technology blinded by science blinded by technology blinded by information because knowledge increase and they do even know they're blind can the church say amen so we're still there but if our gospel be hid it is only hated them that are lost and he is defining those that are lost in whom the god of this world g o d lower case g o d god of this world had blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god should shine unto them so what this shows is that the devil is not a inactive or the devil is not a a a a a a participant in this disengagement he is going around blinding people let me make that resonate a bit he is actively blinding people paul said lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god should shine upon them in other words if it had not been for the devil blinding people the glorious light of this gospel would have a greater impact is that is that so sometimes this this understanding helps us to be able to deal on confronted situations including our families because you can actually be praying wrong at times if you don't understand the issue and i draw a parallel to when elisha when when when they say elijah was seeing what is going on in the king of syria do you remember that we went through that and when they came to get him and jahazi the young servant see but look at how much around us and elisha what do you say he said lord open up this boy eyes because he don't see any spiritual things this young boy wasn't in need of healing he wasn't in need of of a missing limb to be restored he was in need of his eyes being opened because he was blinded his eyes being open allowed him to see what he couldn't see previously and the reality of it is this it cannot be words that would unlock the eyes of your children it has to be the power of god that would unlock the eyes of your family to see the truth anybody with me so again reinforcing this so there are two things we're trying to get here your gospel is supposed to be on display because paul is saying if our gospel be hid it is only hate to them that are lost who they can't even see if they wanted to because they have been blinded by satan's lies his deception his technology his careers all of his time consumption social media technology auditing to blind them that they cannot see that there's a resurrected christ and a ministry on display on the earth through a bride called by her anybody with me lest the light of the glorious gospel who is the image of god should shine unto them paul goes on for we preach not ourselves and for those who have been here for some time we know how much but over takes the shotgun to shoot against these man-made kingdoms we're not preaching ourselves but christ jesus the lord i want to reinforce this because this is what holds us as a people this is what holds us as a church it is all about christ anybody with me the reason we are here is not because we want to be part of a church and because no it is because of christ he is the reason for us he loves when we talk about him he loves when we fellowship about him and we have to make sure that he is in his place every prophet every apostle every teacher every evangelist every king every priest whatever the role a title is has to point towards christ we are not here to even lift up the prophet we are here to point to christ but abraham's message was to point to christ people spend a lot of time spending time on the prophet and this minister and that minister here it is paul who but ibraham would have taught was the gold standard by which we measure every office that came after and every messenger that came after said we preached not ourselves but would always say i don't have to be here tomorrow i'd want to be here next year but this gospel is real christ is real for we preach on ourselves but christ jesus the lord and ourselves your servants for jesus sake for god listen who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hallelujah had shine in our hearts we were just talking about the light shining that the devil walking to blind you and friends you have to understand the devil at all of his tricks you know the blinding of your eyes is making your vision so blurry you can't see what's happening in front of you instead of seeing the promise you see in the political realm until i see any promise you're seeing what is happening economically instead of seeing you promise you've seen what's happening in society instead i see any promise and you're you're you're before long you're you're losing focus on what is most important how many people have been in the message for years and you can't see them now why they end up blinded anybody with me but paul is saying for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness had shine in our hearts so his showing is not even our effort to know but the god who commanded the light let there be light to shine out of darkness had shine in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ isn't that powerful let's go but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us so we are not here boasting of anything but it is the power of god and not of us in that verse seven in the amplified says but we have this precious treasure the good news about salvation in unworthy earthen vessels of human frailty my lord so that the grandeur and surpassing greatness of the power will be shown to be from god his sufficiency and not from ourselves friends do you know there's nothing you could do to deserve this there's nothing you could do to earn this this certain vessel this vessel that that is a pest house that's where the brandon would say this vessel had always wanted to give trouble this vessel that is hard to bring under subjection if it wasn't for the light of this gospel what testimony would we have and paul is acknowledging this paul is saying i'm doing better than anybody if it wasn't for the light of the god that commanded light to cut to the darkness i would be lost also i would be blind also i'm building into something verse 8 and and this is where he's building it because he says no we are troubled on every side is there anybody most of you have your cameras off so you could you could acknowledge if you don't act on legend he said we are trouble in every side yet not distressed anybody anybody can identify you need to add the yet not the stress part in them don't leave the sentence that we are troubled in every side you need to add yet not distressed plenty trouble but not distressed he said we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken anybody can testify about this cast down but not destroyed this was such an encouragement to me i don't know about you but this is an encouragement to be trouble on every side we're in a time of trouble it's trouble everywhere trouble with the economy trouble with your life trouble with your family trouble with your neighbor someone really catch over your house a little brother say the devil always attacking the car i told somebody you have a demon assigned the car i say well you are special category trouble on every side but what is it is to stress you out to get you so overwhelmed and and that is why when david said we bring a sacrifice of praise it means something when you don't really have a you don't feel like you have a reason to pray you ever feel like you're so tired so stressed out and then it becomes such a contrary thing to say lord i praise you and i thank you it is the hardest thing to give god thanks and praise when you get bad news you know it is not an easy thing friends when they get bad news depressing news and they say lord i thank you i just praise you anyhow i just glorify your name listen that goes against in the heat of your emotions in the heat of being disappointed or upset and you know that is what making us sacrifice our praise because they're costing you your human response it's costing you having a pity party so before you try the pizza party and order the balloons and the cake for the pizza party shut down the pity party early until the praise god anybody with meat tonight paul is not saying we don't have issues i want us to i want this to resonate paul is not saying we don't have problems or we don't have child and testing that situation he is saying we are and we as a present tense term we are troubled on every side i look to the left is trouble i looked at you right in trouble i look in front is trouble i look behind this trouble i look up his trouble i look dawn is trouble but he has no distress what does it take us to reach that state where in the face of that much trouble we can say i'm not distressed though he slay me yet still i'll trust him oh god give us more believers who can look at trouble and not be distressed and you know just by declaring this your situation begins to change but i want to even go more important than that sometimes it's not even your situation needs to change you know but you change in the situation and all of a sudden things change let me say that one more time many times you're looking for god to change the situation when the real change that is needed is for us to change in this situation and then all of a sudden we see the situation differently to what it really is an opportunity for character development character formation no wonder paul can say we faint not because we we have rare reasons to find you know oh come on now if you want to list how much reasons you have to give up and say well i don't want to do this thing anymore i i know why i still come in the church and it's all these years people can list all kind of reasons but paul saying because we have received this ministry because of that and we understand what this great call is that here without us cannot be made perfect we faint not we acknowledge the fact that we have trouble on every side but we are not distressed we are perplexed perplexed mean confused sometimes i get confused you don't get confused you don't get perplexed you don't wonder what's going on but how and why and thing and that was job and how and why and perplexed but not in despair i want you to begin to speak it walk in it because sometimes somebody is super spiritual and that is an external super spiritual thing yeah he's super spiritual i want to welcome everything is all right and and and on top the mountain and i gave the example last sunday and closing out my brother said are between revivals i like that kind of honesty are between revivals are working on my next revival hallelujah i walk in towards my next revival what trouble is supposed to come and if we accept the fact that trouble is guaranteed to come and what god really is trying to do is change us in the trouble because that is the refining of the gift that is the character formation that's how a diamond is formed under pressure he pulled his form under pressure oh god sends some more pressure anybody with me on that one we're saying lord yes lord yes lord send more pressure because the more pressure is is is is the equality of the pull the more pressure the people expand on it and it takes tremendous pressure to form a diamond you think i like pressure i listen i don't like it you know i don't know anybody who like depression but if you understand the ministry hallelujah therefore seeing we have this ministry and the expectation of what this ministry brings the understanding of what this ministry is supposed to produce and the power that is coming with this ministry that requires a certain kind of character you imagine by the clearance if power comes and you get so in trouble on every side that you end up getting the stress with the power what you will do with distress power power under stress power in despair power that's forsaken power that's destroyed because this is what paul is trying to bring us a consciousness of that there's a higher expectation of our conduct in the face of trouble oh anybody with me tonight this is not the kind of jump and shout kind of teaching but it's to prepare your mind and your heart and your spirit and your approach so because the reality is friends if you're training to become a pilot or a navy seal or solely or something the training ground is not the real thing you know think about it friends you have to train a pile out how to deal with a plane going down and a pilot may go through his entire career with the plane never going down but there's training that the pilot has to go through just in case and the training must be so real that if the real thing happens they wouldn't be so out of it that they wouldn't know what to do i wanted to appreciate the impact of this so it means then to train a fighter pilot or a pilot or something like that you have to take them through such a grueling process of testing and trials because a trial is a test so that when the real situation come if it were to come it would not be unfamiliar to them it's the same reason to be able to go out in space to put you in a chamber here and eat with all the gravity and your float and your float and your float so that when you go up there you won't throw it off in this space and never come back so they take it to a training a pressurization or familiarization of certain things so that when the real thing comes it is not foreign to you are you with me so count it in a joyous way friends when we look at this we are troubled in every side don't give up yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our body for we which live are always delivered unto death for jesus sake i want to read this entire thing in the amplified so that we can see it using some other words from verse eight again now in the amplified we are pressured in every way friends the only way god could know how you will respond in a given situation with power is a test you on similar situations before you get the power you and i we don't know what's in us unless experiences help bring it out i want to say that one more time you might say to me but i don't ever lose my temper i may not get angry you don't know if certain buttons are pushed in your life how you will respond you might think you do you know how many stories they tell people who say well he's a quiet man you know he was a quiet woman and she was a quiet and then but but something happened when they fell there was a trigger that brought out another side of that person that they that that person would say i didn't even know that i could do it but situations bring out stuff in us the power that god has reserved for this bride is so nuclear in nature it's so powerful in nature that now the scripture can say here but we are pressured in every way that's life pressure that god allows it's not god not in control of them the pressure is allowed we are pressured in every way hedged in but not crushed perplexed listen to the amplified unsure of finding a way out but not driven to despair you know how much times in life you find myself trying to figure something out how i'm gonna approach this how am i gonna do this i haven't been this way before i'm not sure should i do this should i not do this should i talk to somebody hunted down and persecuted but not deserted to stand alone struck down but never destroyed always carrying around in the body the dying of jesus so that the resurrection life of jesus also may be shown in our body let's go verse 11 for we which live are always delivered unto death for jesus seek that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so then death worked in us but life in you we having the same spirit of faith according as it is written i believe and therefore have i spoken we also believe and therefore speak knowing that he which raise up the lord jesus shall raise up us also by jesus and shall present us with you for all things are for your sakes that's powerful for all these things in the amplified are for your sakes that the abundant grace my true the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of god which cause he said again we feel not so poor re unfortunately we faint not which is just the title of this short exhortation tonight for which cause in other words with all that i just said for this cause we faint not giving up is not an option backsliding is not an option turning back is not an option losing hope is not an option wondering if you're gonna make it it's not an option for which cause we faith not but though our outward man perish though this flesh give in trouble hallelujah therefore in the ambulance therefore we do not become discouraged spiritless disappointed or afraid all of that is the word to describe for which cause we faint not therefore we do not become discouraged spiritless disappointed or afraid though our outer self is progressively wasting away though our outer man paris yet the inward man is renewed day by day hallelujah day by day there's a renewal in the inner man this in one man that's why we come yet tonight to get renewed to get reminded to get encouraged to feed this man on the inside the inside man with food you're feeding outward man with something today whether they eat healthy or they need healthy or feeding out old man we come tonight to feed the inner man the inward man with real food food that's tied to your destiny your purpose your call your life your predestination can the church say amen and now listen to the context i'm almost done just one other place we're gonna go after this for our light affliction after all of that paul calls it light affliction anybody repeats tonight he said for our light affliction can we look at our hardship and try to go that light affliction you see what this mystery of god is making is making a change of vocabulary and people are saying but look how he catching it and look out you see this light affliction posing for our light affliction which is but for a moment work it for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory in the amplified for our momentary light distress this passing trouble is producing for us an eternal weight of glory of fullness beyond all measure surpassing all comparison or transcendent splendor and endless blessedness verse 18 while we look not at the things which are seen but are the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal you believe that this evening may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word so just to close us out for a bit i want to go to the book of romans you're going to go to romans 12. it's an encouragement to you still on this we feed not we're not giving up we're not letting down we're not backing up we're not getting discouraged we're not losing hope and now this is more of a challenge now to us so not only is it that we will not faint but there's an expectation of our conduct or behavior and more than ever it's about this personal life and a revelation understanding of this personal life so here it is still paul speaking now romans 12 verse 1. just a few more minutes and we're done i beseech you therefore brethren that beseech is the urge it's like the beg i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that he present your bodies are living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service in the amplified therefore i urge you brothers and sisters by the mercies of god to present your bodies dedicating all of yourselves set apart as a living sacrifice holy and well pleasing to god which is your rational logical intelligent act of worship that's in the amplifier all of this is tied to not just not giving up but now you're pushing forward i beseech you he's challenging them now to go higher to climb higher to not just deal with issues around your life but there's a higher expectation of us as we near this finish line of your pursuing friends because more and more plugging into what would orbit preach the reality is many times we get caught up with the externals and what's happening around us and we're not looking at ourselves so paul is saying here's what i want you to look at your life look at how you live look at how you talk look at how you walk look at how your your carry yourself how are you presenting your body are you a living sacrifice are you are you is there an aroma coming from your life a fragrance coming from your life that god is pleased with that is holy that is acceptable unto god what is it which is your reasonable service meaning meaning friends is not a difficult impossible to attain goal anybody with me don't feign from this you know don't back down from this standard i'm challenging you tonight encouraging you probing using the words of a port i beseech you i urge you and it goes on and be not conformed to this world but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god listen to that in the amplified and do not be conformed to this world any longer with its superficial values and customs but be transformed and progressively change as you mature spiritually by the renewing of your mind focusing on godly values and ethical attitudes so that you may prove for yourselves what the will of god is that which is good and acceptable and perfect in his plan and purpose for you now i want to unpack a few things here friends and this is the challenge that we face when brother branham was here he said take a shotgun to the tv because he saw what was coming on television as a as a distraction as a destruction as an influence on the lives and minds and hearts of the people years have gone on that the tv is not just tv anymore it's on your phone it's the it's social media it's content it's information and it's it's and the reality is many of us don't even understand how social media and technology and information and what we consider social norms and customs how it is actually changing us how our appetite for content our sensitivity for truth and righteousness and holiness has changed because the bars have been dropped so much by so much content i don't know who this is for but if you find yourselves living on social media more than having an anxiety would something is wrong with your life you're not going to make it you know be not conformed to this will conform means take the shape of so you're trying to fit in you're trying to be a part of you don't want to be an oddball you don't want to be an exception so so you want to be in whatever is the thing that's going on now and you have to know you whatever it is that you're trying to be like are you trying to be like guard each other it's easy to come at the night and speak about the promises and it's easy to come tonight but i really want to talk about you tonight and me us us as individuals because we are the product of our decisions every single day our decisions and our actions every day is equals us did you make time to pray today how much time did you make to pray are you holding yourself to a level of accountability or are you conforming to the way the world operates people don't want to hear these things you know did you read the bible today just i talked about yesterday i talked about the plan for tomorrow i'm talking about today did you make time to pray today did you make time to read the bible today did you make time to to meditate on the word today what about yesterday what about the day before what about the day before that and when you analyze your time and i'm i'm coming to our point here friends when you analyze your time and where your time is spent what is the equal sign for using your time because time we all have the same amount of time when a day comes and years ago i was doing a study and i realized that there are certain people who have made a decision to not read the newspaper to not use social media this is not christians these are people who are just so interested in goals and their life goals and achievements and things that they say they don't have time for social media they don't have time to even read the news you don't have time to watch television i see motivational speakers saying don't waste time watching tv and movies and these things because you can't achieve your personal life goals because when you do that you help them put money on a movie maker's account and then use it you know i'm saying they don't have this isn't natural listen i read spiritual yet but the real question becomes because for somebody who is being challenged in the natural to live their lives a certain way to achieve certain things has to make decisions on how they use their time if you don't know certain scriptures but you know i posted on other things who is responsible for that is it the ministry's responsibility if you don't spend the appropriate time with your children then make sure you know sitting who is responsible for that how are you using because the resource you have you talk about spending time with god spending time on the things of god even spending time on your family spending time for your business could you really afford to to spend time watching movies and and content and these things what is the real value of that and when you bring it to a spiritual perspective to temporal things against e2 and all things and if you were to do a balance sheet or profit and loss statement around what you do every day are you adding to the account that's on the eternal side or are you adding into the account of the temporary side i'm not seeing anything wrong and watching and using them i'm talking about having the right balance because you want to make progress where it matters the most you don't want to be here well i believe and yeah yeah but but and the reality is anything could move you because you're not grounded because you're not spending the time to do it comes back to discipline almost two years ago i did a teaching on the discipline of the word and the reality is success all success natural and spiritual has to do with discipline i want to say it one more time all success has to do with discipline go to joshua meditate on your word day and night and you should have good success the issue is not just meditating it's a discipline on doing it consistently it's two pieces there it is what the meditation was on and the process of the consistency of do it day and night do it consistently you want success do it consistently day and night and see the result of it are we challenging ourselves to be now more consistent more diligent i don't know who this is for i don't know how it is helping you but i trust it's an encouragement to you about the discipline of living a christian life the discipline of prayer the discipline of supplication the discipline of intercession the discipline of being the discipline of bridle in your tongue and it perplexes me how people in the natural can make choices around their lives and believers who are called a higher calling to this great ministry as policy can can be so indisciplined i challenge you don't think that this or no let's go on almost done for i say it through the grace given unto me with street to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly is a sober conversation tonight to think soberly do you spend time thinking soberly because the opposite of thinking soberly is thinking unknown influence of something the opposite of sober is is drunk you're under some kind of delusion some kind of influence but soberly bring the level of rationality a level of measure according as god had dealt to every man the measure of faith listen to this in the amplified for by the grace of god given to me i say it to every one of you not to think more highly of himself and of his importance and ability than he ought to think but to think so as to have his own judgment you'll see what he saw but he is sound judgment as god has a portion to each a degree of faith and a purpose designed for service friends you have a purpose don't ever walk around think you don't have a purpose we have to live by purpose live with purpose and if you really understand your purpose it makes you raise a sharp on doing the things that matter to your purpose and there are levels of it and at a foundational level it is to worship god it is a very reflection of his power to be god's advertisement those are some of the general purposes that we share so there's a part of this ministry of purpose that we share but then there are also specific purpose that is tied to you as a parent as a wife as a husband as a deacon as an elder in your job you don't know if on the job the purpose for you being there is to testify to somebody by your life but meanwhile you there having fun and tick tock you they are spending all their time on facebook and not in a position to have an influence on their life by being a display board that god trying to use you but you're not in your purpose you're coming to church you know but in the workplace you're not in your purpose anybody with me tonight verse 4 for we for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in christ and everyone remembers one of another so paul is saying listen everybody in here everybody in this room tonight have a purpose is one body many members we are connected each of us have a responsibility this body could only move well if every part of the body does what it's supposed to do and you have to understand that you have a role to play in the context of the church when you breastfeed with the believers you can't be an island because you can be a tour and we leaving the tour anybody going we all have to go and you can say well i'm a passive i'm a passive member what is that that doesn't exist i'm not really involved i just come and worship really where's your purpose because everybody ever ministry you know even the housewife have a ministry it could be intercession it could be praying it could be something but you have to know what is your contribution to the body listen the human body every piece of the body even if man don't understand and the scientists understand god designed this body a certain way that parts that man now figuring out have things to do with things realize everything about reason for being there because god doesn't happen when god designed the human body he didn't say well i go parting here and i will party i will try something here and let me attach this side no it's a purpose and and paul is bringing a parallel between the human body having different members of that body and this mystical body having a role and a purpose so there's nothing like a passive participant you have a role to play and if you have a role to play you have to be able to give an account and that is what people avoid giving an account for the part of this role of this mystical body that you have to play for some people their role is small a short period of time but it's a long period of time but they still have a purpose friends i challenge you don't faint don't faint at your purpose don't faint at your calling don't get demoralized and demotivated with your children with the situation with your business with your with whatever it is keep on track almost done so we being many are one body in christ and everyone remembers one of another having their gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us so all of us have different gifts to the grace given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith or ministry let us wait on our ministering or he that teach it on teaching or he that extorted on exhortation he that give it let him do it with simplicity he'd have to rule it with diligence he that showed mercy with cheerfulness all these are to the body let love be without this simulation in other words that this is something to me he is doing it because he was a greedy person so paul is cutting through that age and that time to even already let love be without the simulation abhor that which is evil this is christian living don't fail from this this is what we don't want to feign from i know it is easy you know just ourselves from the trouble and say okay well i'm not discouraged but but let us not feed also from this thing abhor that which is evil cleave to that which is good we're almost done be kindly affection one to another with brotherly love can we do a personal checklist and check all these things are we living these things and the reality friends is if we're not living these things knowing about russia unveiling ukraine really not bringing us closer you know because this is the checklist these are the things that god really measuring against i'm almost done be kindly affecting one to another with broadly love in honor preferring one another not thoughtful in business so even the business people here can't be stopped suffer in business you lay any business do it once he do whenever you want when you're on top of him because god is on top of things fervent in spirit you have a zeal you have an enthusiasm you're you're fervent you see we wish brother antoine happy birthday sunday at 86 years old he fulfilled his spirit serving the lord rejoicing in hope i know if you're still going to talk about it i think he will tell you all the issues because everybody have but he makes a choice he makes a choice that when he entered that house of the lord he ever sit in this position lord give us that same disposition the lord allow me to be at age 86 i want to be just so anybody with me be almost done patient in tribulation continuing instant in prayer distributing to the necessity of these scenes given to hospitality well i do like to talk to people now i like to be by myself yes because given to hospitality are you hospitable this is not to select people this is a corporate responsibility and it have people that have no hospitality that is not my portion really your dispositions must be hospitable be almost done bless them which persecute you it's not saying when i'm people who persecuted you but bless them who persecute you don't fade from this we faint not [Music] bless and curse not rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep in other words have a heart for your brethren have a heart be of the same mind one to one another mind not high things but condescend to men of low estate in other words true of your your fancy degree and your fancy perception of yourself and all these things paul said to be stronger became stronger than weaker became weak because there's one body anybody with me being unwise in your own conceits rick recompense to no man evil for evil well because he domained that that is why i go in and that is not christian behavior if you only know what you do you will understand why i'm doing this that is not christian behavior you can know all the mysteries if you can't live this you're missing the mark don't let's clean from this go back down from this church i'm almost done provide things honest in the sight of all men if it be possible as much as light in you live peaceably with all men if it is in your power in other words you're endeavoring to do all your code to maintain the peace you're not trying to turn off your war you're trying to be a peacemaker blessed are the peacemakers daily beloved avenge not yourself but rather give place unto rat for it is written vengeance is mine i will repeat say the lord in other words it is not your job to bring vengeance it has its place and it's not your place give place put it on the lord let him handle it therefore in other words with that consciousness if the enemy hunger feed him if he first give him drink for in so doing thou shall he calls a fire on his head be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good i'm finished for tonight i trust that these three portions of scripture we read from isaiah from second corinthians from romans would give us an encouragement to relook at our lives and not faint at the great responsibility that lays ahead of us i trust in some ways an encouragement to you that we have more climbing to do we can climb higher we can shake past our limitations we can pray not only for god to change situations that we are in but more importantly pray for god to change us for a week and we get stronger and we can look at from our different eyes and and and and getting scared from our eyes shall we bow our heads so would have prayed oh heavenly father this time in your presence lord outsider for regular church service to spend time lord in
