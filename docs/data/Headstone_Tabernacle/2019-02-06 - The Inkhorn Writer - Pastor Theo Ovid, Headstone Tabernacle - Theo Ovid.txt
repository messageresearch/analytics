the north and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand and one man among them and the wind and the glory of the God of Israel had gone up from the cherub whereupon he was to the cheshire of the house and he called to the man clothed with linen which had the writers inkhorn by his side and the Lord said unto him go to the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh after him to the city and after these things I saw four calling the four winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree and I saw another angel ascending from the east having the seal of the Living God and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea saying hurt not the earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants of God in their foreheads and I heard the number of them which were sealed and they were sealed a hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel may God bless his word you may be seated praise the Lord it's good to be in his presence tonight our title the inkhorn writer that's the title of tonight the ink horn writer and an inspiration sealed in or sealed out on a contact Scripture will tell you whether Scripture Sunday evening first Corinthians 12:13 for by one spirit we are all baptized into one body I'm Alabama pretty sprayer he said dear Lord Jesus we are summoned again in your name with great expectation for your point of the quickening power of God to bring us into recognition of our position and please and our responsibilities of being appalled people separated from the world dedicated to God grant Lord tonight that the blessings of God will guide us and they wreck us and the things we do and see that it might bring honor and glory to your name so he was under expectation for the Orion of the Krypton power what are you on the expectation for tonight Oh hallelujah you have to be under expectation for that quick and power from the inside man Branham you know you would like to know what I think the greatest need of the church today would you like what I think where I think the lacking is is no salt reveal the people are not broke up enough listen to those words the people are not broken up enough there is no burden seemingly you give me someone that so talk about lost souls but they cry and a wanton a revival so bad till they can hardly eat this simply can't you can't continue if you would read a history of the world and religious history you will find out it always take that kind of spirit to bring a revival what kind of spirit brokenness broken spirit broken are you feeling to pour out you want to repent you want to make things right you want to be reconciled to God you want to humble yourself to the cross you want to lay at Christ's feet digs that kind of spirit to bring a revival not arrogance not tried not you in your own self and you do your own thing people not caught up and I'll have a burden about Jesus Christ when you have fall in love with the Lord you want to do the thing that pleases God so that your children for it's not the family for it's not what you feel first is what God is what Jesus one first so Jesus become the team of your life Jesus become the center point of your life everything is wrong we were all wrong Jesus not this is me notices don't ends about Jesus it's not about you Oh hallelujah so let's see said that's right and then he could disappear it when Zion travailed and I think I well giant reveal I think is a better world why is a big echo here when Zion travailed why she bought four children you have to be taught up the atmosphere or anything you have to be torn up so some time God allow things to happen to break our spirits the embarrass and Seamus and mashes up so when we get broken we could cry because they've got to leave you intact you are fine everything is everything everything we cannot have your money or your house you have your card and everything we're gonna fine you don't need good because things will come to mess with you but then God have to crush that brick that something up to happen to break your spirit and if your spirit is not broken he will break it before there is going to be a revival praise God I believe that there is going to be revival and you will have to get in that spirit to get into the revival or praise then you know do you believe that what about saying you get around when there are arguments you get into the type of atmosphere if there's something in the church someone who is disobedient and acting or glee in the church and causing trouble you will never be able to have a revival as long as that kind of atmospheres are wrong so all the rocks that offend God will move out all the people that want to be ugly going to move them out run them out put them out because one going to have a right atmosphere for revival or glory the body will bust the rocks and off his holy mountain because God going to have a glorious church without spot without wrinkle and no human I will stop that church hallelujah no pastor human no elder human not peaking human no office on human no believer human no human spirit when to stop that church from coming forth because amount of the Lord had spoken it oh praise the name of the Lord believe that so so watch if somebody acting ugly in the church I'm causing trouble you will never be able to have a revival as long as that kind of atmospheres are wrong you have to have everybody if you notice when the Holy Spirit came on Pentecost they were all in one place in one Accord waiting for the promise and when we get like that the revival will be there there oh praise God hallelujah and the reason I think we have just had protracted meetings instead of a revival cause we do not have a revival nation as yet we have revival like the didn't a Wesley revival Scotland all these revival is on Wesley they had great breaking up and worldwide revival by John Wesley that's when I think of a revival I noticed in my ministry and this is about Abraham talking now if the people will spiritual people and yet they will watch what God will do and signs and something that he will perform under people set and safe well that's very fine and you'll notice God will do something else now and they will say that's very nice we appreciate that well it's a good god well it's your duty god you did it as a duty no real burden they just take it for granted what blessing you you have held and strength you take God for granted did they got fluffy in a line on a hospital bed flat then you recognize Oh God it would want to take it for granted that's why you ought to have a attitude of gratitude let me say it you have to have you should have an attitude of gratitude you don't need a complain because you a face to the Beast system yet USA's depressed yet you have quantity wilderness yet the daughter take you all day yet so right now you should have an attitude of gratitude that God will open your eyes to see this endtime message or glory does got to see if you will stay with the word until your time come hallelujah you're gonna wait till your time come we only waiting you know but one day the t gonna turn the clock is stopped ticking now you know time is running out all glory to put is gonna be reminder hallelujah just when the worst earthquake to strike America struck the revival holy was in Azusa that stop hallelujah 1906 I believe it was there was 1906 hallelujah what a great little quick and people was blaming God for that it was a great destructive earthquake with many fires but there was another earthquake in the spiritual realm that wasn't lit it up a different kind of fire it was holy war sire it was a bonfire it was the as we go to revival and I believe tonight there's gonna be another earthquake but this time will be the bright revival it's gonna be a Holy Ghost revival he said what we see should make a church that would make a revival that people will fly in from everywhere say the seven thunders of Revelation 10 that is not even written it's being manifested or glory to God so I am under great expectation tonight Oh glory to glory man we believe that what about him says now if there really was a revival on the air when those things would take place every soul will grasp it quickly there will be no end to it it will just go from one to another from one to another it will keep moving of course you know I'm American like you are but in Africa down here where they're supposed to be hidden land it was kinda wouldn't make us feel ashame of ourselves to see how they received the gospel when they see one supernatural thing performed thirty thousand receive Christ as first unsaved at one time that was he least 30,000 there's no question it was just over that's all and I will tell you this in this body burn I think our people has relied too much on education and theology and so forth and has let it take the spirits place so no is the message ludovic knowledge and information and revelation and understanding and topics and discussion and fellowship and people have no feet no atmosphere loaded with theology and the theology in end up a substitute for the spirit that's supposed to be here present for the spirit are supposed to be working Oh hallelujah let me drop this to you i believe in ezekiel the 9th chapter that what we read I'm pretty sure I may be wrong I'm not quite sure is equal 9 chapter when the Holy Spirit went for first it was a man when thought from behind the gates with slaughtering weapons to destroy so they say these angels was coming to destroy it's one among them was that one with the inkhorn but the writer right side isn't that right and that was of course scripturally applied was before the destruction of Jerusalem and there was a man came forward with a white robe and in corn by his side and the Commission was given to him by God to go to the city no listen to this and set a mark upon the forehead and he call it he said he read after readin the ceilin of the Holy Spirit they're not understanding and getting a revelation and you know they would come to me you know talking about that no he's talking about a man do you have that Mac he's talking about a Mac this is not I see you should have this or a pastor said no no no this is the Scriptures no he says no go true listen set a mark upon the forehead the sealing of the Holy Spirit a mark upon the forehead of every man a woman that sighed and cried for the abomination did in the city so that's the quality of spirit that's the quality of attitude sighing and crying for the abomination now I want to ask you if he was coming to Chicago tonight how many places would he find tonight that in the home they are laying seven for revival just in such travail of soul that they can't stand it any longer they just don't know what to do I wonder how many would he mark in Chicago tonight of this city of almost 5 million people in it what would he mock I imagine you could calm them on your fingers hardly don't you think so the people with that type of burden and yet that was exactly he wasn't a mark no one but that type are you that type do you want to become that time do you want God to come and put that burden on you that you want to be saying to crying and groaning and travailing according to the script we read when Zion travailed Zion brought forth if there is no travail and not in coming 4 therefore God after bring on a travel of soul at revealing your spirit beyond where you just have your needs met and things being met and things working out for you something have to go beyond that that you can grasp the burden of God Oh hallelujah praise God you see people individuals inside they have the individual interest and burden and conditions we who in ministry not fortunate to be in your position because we have the burden of the entire church so when you study in you and your family we can study our own family we have to study the entire church the burden is different the responsibility is different the weight is different hallelujah so you can look for all the individual attention if this just was a thousand people how much hand we will shake how much people we go go home by and college of width it can't work it can't work you have to good up your loins and become a Christian and make yourself a Christian you have to do that you am born a Christian yeah born Holmgren edition of the righteousness Rasta be blessed Jesus a blessed a day that a hunger and thirst after righteousness I won't want to bless you tonight that when you leave here you have a hunger in your soul that you can't even explain because God had to create an act and butter man and said Lord created me revival let me hunger let me taste what after creates water created in you if it is nothing you you only going to church a church member just a church member he wasn't a mock no one but that type of people you see what I mean he said we got to get mellowed up before God hallelujah now Jesus a man went out and another man went out another one worked not a man went out and work and one man went out the eleventh hour when he stopped at the eleventh hour he gave every one of them the same portion the eleventh hour the one that why why did he the everyone working luta worked under looted exposition the methodist shouted diagonal Wesley died in grace we live in another age not back there mother used to go on an ox cart we go in a Ford v8 in Ford almost jet-propelled we are living in a different age we are living in a different dispensation we live it in the day there we go of the restoration of the powers of God not Bible text alone power of God because that is what we as user Street introduced for years his Bible debts hallelujah the Catholic Church I take away the bad from the people and when and when they had no Bibles so the priest was interpreting the word to them God had the German say invent the printed press because the bag was about to be restored so when they when the printing press the Bible can print and then Wesley spread the print then quad invent Rick science invent the audio tape because when a man was coming that we could get the days of the voice hallelujah god no what's he doing when he won the word printed he cut them printed when he won the word spread he got their spread when he wanted and tear because a man take now he wanted to be seen Oh Boeing aborted that's why we have video that's why we are streaming because God wants is that the Holy Ghost will go across the world overnight all the night this Holy Ghost will go across the world Oh hallelujah it will sweep across the world the latter rain will sweep the world will give the Lord some praises although Loreena dog so these four angels these engines will angel of destruction but injustice smiles was a good word for me times no longer than that these engines came to destroy destruction angels they come in to destroy to help the earth to hurt the sea hallelujah amen inglis committed for instruction then these four engines what hold back hold back what Berman said know what hold it until what until what all the four winds hold back the destruction in just of the whole back destruction destruction coming you know but holding back you know cause he was but you hold it back hallelujah earthquakes falling back hallelujah this product falling back until what until the eleventh hour people would come in he knows that that eleven about gentle workers you see what God see you are this what if I will say you are you are the eleventh hour Gentile workers that bought everything was written for you everything is being held up for you all the destruction or glory of God Oh hallelujah because I see an angel is coming no no man angel I seen an angel or glowing a goddess here again not no man injured I've seen an angel I see leader coming to Syria the angel from these or do you remember the cleaner hallelujah oh boy in Oh God hallelujah thank you Lord the angel from the east oh my my my hallelujah glory to God hallelujah holding the four winds and heat and the wind that should not blow on the earth or the sea nor on any tree I saw another man either from the east having the seal of the Living God Oh hallelujah because destruction come into the earth but if I'm had a vision he saw it coming it was his seventh vision where America was blown up you'll get it who will praise God so hear what he says eleventh hour people will come in the last corner of the Gentiles mother work their data work their grandmother would back this is our age the eleventh hour will wash top on the eleventh month in the year in the eleventh day of the month the eleventh hour of the day world wars was stopped in the November the 11th at the eleventh hour nobody can explain how it stopped that time but God was showing a sign of the 11th hour workers Gentile workers coming in isn't that right he said in an 11-minute at the hour that eleven orbit might come in to receive the same baptism of the Holy Ghost that they did back there in the beginning let me say it again because this is not Christmas in the message but I'm gonna preach it hallelujah hallelujah dilemma our workers is to receive the same baptism of the Holy Ghost that they had at the beginning that's why William Branham was sent to turn our ass back to the faith of the fathers they can't get the wrong it priests whatever they want to preach we have to go back to the father's works is feared express or glory to God once the faith of the fathers is restored you have to have the expression of the works that the fathers had not taught the father sad order the law some prisons hallelujah to receive what the same baptism of the Holy Ghost what is sin we explain that Sunday same a same not the explanation of the Holy Ghost not a understanding and a theological and theology Holy Ghost we adapt not that but the same when when God finished with Peter he was staggering when God finish with Mary she was staggering when God finished with James and Angie and all them brothers in the upper room there was time like don't men be warned that same one but make your junk like junkman or cattle or - oh we don't wanna murder Holy Ghost be monumental holy those we want the same Holy Ghost no intellectual Holy Ghost no explain and Holy Ghost Oh hallelujah I am taking that hallelujah I ain't letting no man feed me with that God same talk hallelujah hey man I want you convinced I want you to be convinced it's the same Holy Ghost I want you to be convinced what Peter had and Paul had is what you have to have I want you to be convinced that you don't want nothing less conduct no left nobody explain that away from you nobody under Thomas mysteries for much revelation how much understanding there is something called power God [Applause] [Music] [Applause] listen listen listen to receive the button Holy Ghost I get back there in the beginning to bring back the power and the resurrection of the Lord Jesus seen signs seem wonders similar goals what is it the wars are struggling here struggling they're struggling here struggling the atomic bombs everything else they are being built up but they can't do it they can't do it until the Jews gets a visitation of the baptism of the Holy Ghost not not teaching sinner I heard a voice said how much was sealed I heard 144,000 were sealed from this tribe and that child sealed and before they could be sealed there's a Gentile right to be sealed with the same Holy Ghost not talked sealed they can't do it until the Jews get the visitation of the backing of the ghost the angel said hold it till we see the sevens not the brightest the Gentiles never was a seven we are sons and daughters of God that's sevens the Jews are Abram God silver so you are the 11th hour workers hallelujah and God is falling back what the Trina 1/2 years tribulation from you because the foolish virgins going to clean off your tribulation Oh glory you wouldn't be escaping the three-and-a-half years to the leash honey I have the seal of God that were deceived come for the escape key and a half years tribulation oh that is not a shout tonight that's enough storm is this hallelujah glory ligado inkwon rider is mercy before judgment or glory record Italy lat Oh hallelujah hallelujah so before any tribulations and whatever come brought up the seal you first believe that all glory to God oh yeah blowing along so let me just break in here this as an interjection from Azusa and this is all testimony from it and yeah but Terry talked about the choir singing I had a heavenly music on different things listen to this especially the enchanting strange of the so called heavenly choir of hymn song under the evident direction of the Holy Spirit both as two words and tune trill my whole being is a testimony from Azusa Street it was not something that could be repeated at will but supernaturally given for each special occasion and was one of the most indisputable evidences of the presence of the power of God perhaps nothing so greatly impressed people as this singin at once inspiring by a holy or or feeling of indescribable wonder especially the hearers were in default attitude this one I get to divine love was wonderfully manifest in the meetings they were not even allowed an unkind word said against the opposes or the churches the message was the love of God it was a sort of first love of the early church returned it was a sort of first love of the early church returned the baptism as we receive it in the beginning did not allow us with all body baptism of the Holy Ghost did not allow us to think speak or hear evil of any man that was religion not that word repeated the baptism of the Holy Ghost did not allow us to think speak or hear evil of any man the spirit was very sensitive and tender as a dove [Music] are you like that hippie mystery my real mystery Oh hallelujah not arrogant and proud and loosen lip and silver your aunt and this is me talking this is not that the spirit sensitive as a dove one managed and the other said I would rather live six months at that time than 50 years of ordinary life I have stopped more than once within two blocks of the place and prayed for strength before I dare go on the presence of the Lord was so real two blocks and here are sent for what for strength to reach the place because the power of God is upon him I mean we don't hear now the presence of the Lord was so real cause of people were seen dropping in to prostrate position in the streets before they ever reached the mission they were would get up speak in tongues without any influence on the essence of people God had accomplished this would GES LAN reports that some who came to investigate were baptized and the Holy Ghost in their legends scores of personal and eyewitnesses the concept s that many who came to ridiculed immittance were knocked to the floor where they seemed the rest of it unseen opponents sometimes for hours did these people come to ridicule demons they will come you know oh yes madam said the when he sprayed fall it raised up other spirits and season was sin Eric put the Civic disrepair genuine Holy Ghost revival Elizabeth these people okay these people generally arose convicted of sin and seeking God one foreign-born Reporter has been assigned by his people to recall the circus-like atmosphere in a comic relief fashion so he comes looking for kicks he come in to give a report he attended a nighttime meetin citizen find it back in the midst of the meetin a young woman began the test if how God had baptized away the Holy Spirit when she suddenly broken two tongues after the meetin the reporter sought her out and ask her where she had learned the language of his native country she answered that he didn't have any idea what she had said and that she spoke only English he then related to her that she had given an entirely accurate account of his sinful life all in the language of his native tongue Oh blessed be the name of the Lord so it wasn't a game in those days now wasn't a plaything and by her mom says the Holy Ghost be back in the church and there'll be a nice and Sapphira I'm gonna deal with him one more he said we'll be a perfect Church cocoapod TechNet Church it would be a powerful church holy course in the church or Gloria but people can hide under word word word but they can hide under spirit or give the Lord a shout come on give the Lord some praises let me say it again they could hide in the mysteries they can hide in the teaching we could hide in a word word word word word but they kind of hide on the spirit because it's preferable discernment and the spirit will expose or give the Lord a praise offer worried Oh God let me jump up on you you ready you ready God will do in one year what all the theologians he'll to do in 2,000 years he said give me a church full of the Holy Ghost was the only Oh full of the Holy Ghost Barbara doing one year Oh blowing oh god I am worried I am worried at all because fires coming powers coming all glory to God hallelujah what we're doing one year but all the solutions failed to do in two thousand years or mine so brother branham in ten virgins he was specialist he said put you before unbeliever fo4 formal

keep in mind and this saved church is two classes in this church right here and this save church with of a message Church in this message if we just have tea classes any save Church which is a type of Christ one of them was a sleep inversion the other one had oil in their lamp hallelujah glory to God now in the days of the coming of Titus after Jesus left the Holy Spirit was that man with the ink on at his side hallelujah the Holy Spirit was that man with the ink on at his side and he went to Jerusalem to set a mark upon people now I want you to notice something church member and you claim the Holy Spirit he said don't seal any of them but they're not scientists on the city now where is anybody so burdened about the world now and the condition people so selfish they can concern about people in the church much as for the wilderness conditioned Souls going to hell and there's no testimony from you so where the hell and you can even witness whoa God save you somebody testify to you that is why you are here tonight you can't even testify to anybody and you're a Christian no you are coach member you come to attend you go back on a Christian is to be christ-like Christ came to get sinners hice come to redeem Peter come James come Andrew come you wanna see a man in history - Jenna I'm not lying to you I gotta tell you the truth iboga set you free don't steal any atom and Damned where's anybody so blatant about the world know when the condition you sound Methodist and Baptist so what difference does that make oh not that constant burden for the loss that sweetness don't never let anything rise up and put bitterness in your soul people angry and bitter in their soul never get them longtime the Christian League gone no matter how bad anyone ever treats you anything don't be guilty of letting nothing anchor in your soul it will grieve the Holy Spirit away from you it certainly will cover the church without Holy Spirit Gwen home the world hosts by going to work with the Holy Spirit what what can i life is that that would be sinners ever known they do I respect you come to church to get the Holy Spirit that your life could be guided by the Holy Spirit not by your human spirit only well your arguments really to inner listen you have a human spirit you know you have a will of your own just a not my will but your will be done you have a human spirit by not the Holy Spirit that if you yield to the Holy Spirit and currently you can share it to his word because the spirit anywhere is one let's continue my opinion like is unknown now to see whether this message we got is connected with it or not the very hour that Israel was sign in to be a nation is the very same hour the very same day the very same month I was at Greenville Indiana and the angel appeared to me and sent me out on the field with this he met me down the river and told me that would take place then commissioned me 11 years later at the same hour that Israel was sign our nation it is all connected together the in then he made a statement he had me keep preaching it and thing like that the angel the Lord is under it now he is moving around fixing everything for the common of the Lord no 1914 over went to war there have been never be peace since control is swinging swinging and swinging and and they are doing the very same thing yet and they was doing what Holden he said oh boy have mercy holding that great thing that I saw in the vision the whole team become a destruction holding the atomic hole and awards that they don't destroy themselves until the team come to destroy until Israel returns back and get herself together and then the messenger go to Israel and she'll be sealed with the seal of the Holy Spirit after the Gentiles is called out the pure his namesake then Israel oniy receives a tree and six three years and six month Daniel said so there's given space is given for the Gentiles when it comes to this age he call it the times of the Gentiles not even fixed just ecologist the times of the Gentiles and when that time of the general is over the door is shut not one more Gentile to be seized and then quark over to the Jews Oh could I read owner of it then there's three and a half years left for the Jews now if we get over the ocean level we'll pick it up at the end of that Elijah and Moses returns again and preacher the Jews two men anointed with that spirit or maybe them themselves they never die so they kill them the lien the street called Sodom we our Lord was crucified Jerusalem and after treat is a life Spirit came into them and they went up and raised up and then about a third of the earth was blown to pieces at that time squatters are there you mean this is real the mint is going to happen he said a third of the earth was blown up to pieces at that time no here the Jews that come in to preach to the world cannot would not blow up on another or kill one or destruction come until the Jews come down to that place and here sets the Bible he saw four angels and watch what they got to receive they have got to receive the Holy Ghost Oh hallelujah praise God Ephesians 4:30 the Holy Spirit sealed until the day of your Redemption and they cannot do nothing until those Jews return oh praise God hallelujah 11:00 tonight the last even we picked up and find out that the first church how it started off it was started there Pentecost where the Holy Spirit poured out upon the believers and we saw the reaction of these believers and how they acted upon them nobody talks about that they explain away the Holy Ghost but the Hara action and they did and signs and wonders follow them we find out at the close in church age about 200 years they sprung up a heresy among them that doctrine was the induction of the Nicolaitans we find out it was deeds to begin with in the next churches become a doctrine then they become persecution and Dark Age then the other side it come Protestant Church Martin Luther watch and he's seen the Spirit of God lead amount instead of letting the people steal free he organized a church and made an image lightning unto the Beast you surely miss Bertram what God seen people say that to an eternal God see an image onto the beasts unless let's go further a political power lighten on to it instead of letting the people walk as God gives light they organize under a discipline that they have to stay to that discipline what happened in the message what happen it is people had one doctrine and teaching and people following doctrine and teaching hallelujah and that and and that is supposed to put them any bright like I said on Sunday there is no private bright nobody can take a church outside and like I see brighter Jesus Christ and then Minister intended by that Jesus Christ that doesn't exist the pride of price is that is the body by one spirit the baptizes and that one body nobody can hijack Debray another byte in a corner look at hijacked church members anytime you could have told him the church members but that ride that Jesus right first Thessalonians 4 the Lord Himself descended on her with a shout to get that right he sent a message to get that bride well glory to God if God called you like this message ho glory to God you up you are privileged you are privileged because the bride will not be manhandled the black gonna be flesh of his flesh one of his word spirit of a spirit or glory dog or demon God listen listen God need right out into the Methodist Church the Methodists are a revivalist up the world the holy spirits with them teaching sanctification and the first thing you know the organizer change amid an image onto the Beast a political organized power to bind the people that is what that anointing does it binds the people to a system and not the Holy Ghost that is what we are fighting halleluiah systemís Beynon is a power you know it'll make an unfallen taco bell's of power because dying the people the people kill me the people can't worship the people can't break out there was no signs there was no oneness there is no merit there was no power the church is dead on now power a different kind of power you see below see that's power you don't see it as a power base the power I'm read it to you he said the first thing you know watch God move Ward the first thing you know when they did that the organized that church mean I imagined to the Beast that's right a political organized power to bang the people of God to a Creed instead of being free to worship and walk in light as light was tuned in their part did you realize Christian friends that the Antichrist which is the mark of the beast aha now we come to another Mack put a mark the inguinal right to have a Mac and the beasts have a mark is just two months it's not 24 months is not tattooing all over it's just too much mass of God and mass of the beasts I was saying that they just - I like that it's simple just two marks it's not 24 markers of mafia-style max take whatever math you want is there too much math of God mark of the beast not of God mark of the beast sealed in Orsino Oh hallelujah Oh to the Lord a shout I will say again either you are ceiling or see Lopez normally there is no in-between or capella new earth shall worship the beasts whose names are not written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world all glory does God we are crazy we're not crazy or Bolena Lord we are not crazy this is the message to face the word back to the Bible dr. Pentecost back to the Holy Ghost dr. dynamics and we are emphasizing dynamics we emphasizing the spirit oh my do you realize Christian friends that the Antichrist which is the mark of the beast the Antichrist everyone knows that the Antichrist did that his mark is his power abby's is a power there is a power in the Catholic Church I wanted to understand what the prophecy there is a power in the Methodist Church so it's not like they have no power oh it's what kind of power because the confessions of millions is the power keeping them people inside idea whether to our Father and Sheila nari it keeping them there did not move in every Sunday morning finally vine have them under control DePaul the Methodist Church here but around that is the beast power the Baptist churches is in the Pentecostal church you were witness all of them it's peaceful you can't change over with this unless the name on the book is stained your witness because a doctrine that binding the foliage of a witness the following Baptists tie the head ring the bell that is it it's the power hallelujah but we have to get our power too [Applause] our power has to be the same power that PETA had because this one Lord is one fit and as one baptism or give the Lord a show one Lord one faith one baptism is the Holy Ghost baptism and those guys had it you wanna have it because the only one is the Jewish one don't nobody feel happy that I've had a kind and we really modern age and we have a kind - no no no we would see one Lord one faith one baptism that's why brother Branham didn't commenting on you fate you can turn your hats because only one feat bring back to defeat Oh hallelujah praise God praise God in many many men or glory to God hallelujah praise God but a Branham and this way I get who get the inspiration from if I could see that way see the Antichrist but about God bless you I love you and if you want to see a real genuine gifts are not impersonation if you want to see real solid Christians walking so salty tell the goodies to stand for them to be like them you can't go down on the street and tell what is Christian anymore that's right the old good on the street they were at the scene they talk the same all the time around I can all kind of jokes everything like that when God said you'll give a con for every idle word that you speak what happened because brother you are letting the devil come in and put it the first thing you know prophecy the time will come when God will give a message and you'll be sealed in out the kingdom of God not joint church people joining anybody Towson's he said a message gonna come I'm that message going to either actually see you or see you he said we need the old-fashioned gospel back in the church back to the Word of God look at this nonsense and foolishness cut off oh my around the country the things that's done here in our country something coming here not long ago you can't even mention Pentecostal run our country anymore of a count of it come in with thousand time thousands of dollars taken from the poor people to buy airplanes and so forth never was a little airplane bought all the kind of stuff and get up on the platform bringing a flappers hung and down enough jewels and their fingers a cent for missionaries that was to the sea and preach the gospel then poor people get stabbed in to hear the will of God we call us our Christians he said brother there is something wrong we have time for everything else no time for prayer meetings the home is all butchered up the girls and boys are all going around lacking on the country mothers and fathers is unconcerned yet Pentecostal what we need a night is a home altar in the house a place where God where the Bible is read and the children are taught the word of the Living God all glory to God hallelujah so the wise Virgin going to be in travail all glory to God the wise virgin go be in travail to get the extra oil because the fullest version they all gonna run out Oh glory to God to get a temporary blessing he said the Holy Spirit Oh glory to God amen what but when they come to do lunch a man time what is arm the lumbar weakened it path the pin oil and patent fire if well George if they do have the pattern fire the casino do you know that that lamp like ocean so you have to be doing pata you in oil and an expert on fire that could give light isn't that right but after a while the lambda suit up you see the sit up then you would long-term where we have a lamp really do you take the lamp and you take the newspaper and clean it out the chimney lamp you clip the wick and then light it over fresh you get nice light good light so lamb common time you have the chicken cleaning lamb and cut the wick or God luncheon and tangle or that father up in your life and smoking up your life that you can't give the light you're supposed to again that's how they get keynote or glory of God but your life ought to be an oil and you have to be on fire fire on warning only one in this man right hallelujah glory to God we believe that hallelujah so butter I'm talking about it's not enough to to great pains coming to the end time the mark of God and the seat of the beasts isn't that right and the seat of God any minister no is a baptism of the holy ghost remember what the mark of the beast is the mark of the beast is Connor Esau we check that bit right didn't he so we bitterly trying to restore that grit right again but there was no place of repentance when you reject the Holy Ghost you seal yourself outside of God's mercy now you say brother branham you if you can tell us our diseases and so forth you are prophet well I am still the simplest and that's right I still got the scripture said it's exactly right it's the truth it's hearing people say there be a mark it's already marked just reject the Holy Ghost and your mount receive the Holy Ghost and your map that's right receive it once and see what take please receive at once that's the mask of God and you are sealed to your eternal destination like the crowd on the road the inspector comes and I know if you didn't get the Holy Ghost last night that went in there check up tonight the inspector of the Holy Ghost is here inspecting you over I use the work at the Pennsylvania Railroad we load a car with cans the inspector coming wrong shake everything to see if there were any looseness and that's the way corners his church he shake it to see what's the matter with it to seek and there's any looseness in you before he pours his spirit into you and if the church is a little shaky he would pour his spirit into it if you still love the world I want to do the sins of the world you will never get the holy was up on that you might get a confusion you may get stammering lips you might get speaking in tongues but you still that don't mean you have got the Holy Ghost when you got the Holy Ghost you are sealed by God to your eternal destination and when the inspector come and check that God oh good that car you shut the door and put a seal on it and when God sees you're ready so lot for him he fills you with the Holy Ghost you are sealed by the Holy Ghost until your destination oh praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God so we are waiting for the finishing of the seven sealing the prove who we are all glory to God the bride get caught up at the finishing of the seventh seal and the fullest version would be exposed for the Trina have your Tribulation Period or glory that God resists and the Holy Ghost and they will not even know it until it early and hit them hallelujah Jannes and Jambres tribulation work at them the resistant Rachel oh my hallelujah glory to God that's the reason I spoke against the church there's only one church and that's a body of Christ but these lodges that is called churches blasphemous name why blasphemy it's just to be contrary or speak against what God said and God said come and be born and they say come and join and when the baptism of the Spirit is for she took over for water wave and the Catholic Church he said and the Protestant church and emotion in the Pentecostal church instead of the person of Christ coming in with all that building instead as a personal crisis terminal with all that pyramid building we had the other day after your faith virtue and 30 knowledge Peter said these things lowly that's the Holy Ghost shake and virtual knowledge and depth that's the Holy Ghost or give the Lord some praises that is what the Pentecostals was short of oh my let's continue quickly the green injure of the Covenant Jesus Christ taught not robbery to be equal with God the first Exodus he bought him from a natural and to a natural man from Egypt the keeneland the second axis important out of a spiritual condition into the baptism of the holy ghost and this third one now he's bringing up a much fresher baptism of the holy ghost to that eternal and in the
