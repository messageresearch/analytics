second Peter 1:2 to 7 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and Word was God for His 14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of his only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth second Corinthians this one do we begin again to commend ourselves or need we are some others epistles of commendation to you or letters of combination from you ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in the tables of stone but in fleshy tables of the heart and trust that we have true Christ a God word not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God who had made us able ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit and give it life I read in second Peter reading from for his two Grace and peace be multiplied unto you to the knowledge of our Lord of God and our Jesus our Lord according as his divine power I'd give them unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that had called us to glory and virtue whereby a given to us exceeding great and precious promises that by DS amaravati cos of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this given all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and the knowledge temperance and the temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity may God bless his word you may be seated praise the Lord Amen god bless you once again and I want to tongue by the Isaac about Anthony for minister in the last couple of services we certainly appreciate that and last Sunday was a tremendous blessing to me be partakers of the divine nature his divine nature you invited to be a partaker of his divine nature that was nothing but the word but Isaac that was the absolute Word of God when I first come to this message I always believed that anybody could crack the pyramid that's gonna be it the secret was how to get inside there it was always a secret because the pyramid is what Bible there are three Bibles you know that right one under stars do react and the second was what pyramid and the third was this violet we have but a pyramid as a mystery insider dear isn't that right anyhow we want to get into the word and I trust the Lord blesses us bless the wood today and a licking for God to confirm his word their hearts and in your lies you love him this morning it's always a privilege to comment to the host of y'all don't take it for granted take it as a privilege you will always have this privilege so the title I have this morning is the living word the word need flesh the living word the word made flesh I love the songs this morning Lord I want to be a Christian in my heart more love more power isn't that right we have to get dear it will take love to enter inside ideal let's go this week President Putin made another major announcement to his Parliament or whatever it is and he claims that Russia now has an invincible nuclear weapon that can strike any part of the world that cannot be intercepted and he give an animation in it on the screen of a video showing Russian warheads speeding towards Florida and missiles out maneuvering obstacles in the southern Atlantic Russia has a new class of weapons President Putin said on Thursday that could make America defences obsolete listen to what this prophet said in the uncertain song we live in a day of uncertainty we live in the day when there's everything almost that we can put our hands on natural is unseated there's so much uncertainty till the nations are quaking there is uncertainty in our national security there is no nation safe anymore we could either be the victims to Russia by midnight tonight or either be in bits it depends upon what Russia wants to do about it we are talking about our scientists they are men that they can put 200 miles in the air in a little machine that come right over and setting right on top of this nation I send a message down and said either surrender we pull the lever that's all of it they don't have to wait till tomorrow to do it they can do it right now so put it this way the things are set I think they call this bomb that they have Seaton - I don't know if you know the first one that they had that can reach America and so on Colette season 1 so that is season 2 they have right now and it's it's fixed the prophecies are dear and that's why the Prophet said we are striving to enter into the kingdom of God before the plague strike a lot of foolishness would disappear as the pressure comes on as the Bible speaks of a time of trouble such as never was since there was a beginning of times but they're gonna be here isn't that right so we want to make sure that we put our best into the service of the Lord to receive what he has from us because only one place that can strike and that's the word only one place that cannot strike and that's the Word of God there is no hidin place hallelujah can't say gone to this nation or this country there is no item please but yeah yes Christ is that vehicle to take you out of here amen so are you ready for the word this morning amen but a man a man Jubilee a say for this world as we see this morning has to be fulfilled it is God's thoughts made manifest by his word and brought to a reality now in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the word was the beginning but before it was a word the word is a thought made manifest before you speak your thing is not right so God had to think it before he could make it a word and when he spoke it the word it materialized so you come from thought to word to material Isaiah 51 55 11 so my world that God father of my mouth it shall not return to me void but it shall accomplish that which I please it shall prosper in the things that I sent it so God would can't feel we know that once God said it it has to come to pass because it comes from his thinking his thoughts and if God spoke about your deliverance your brick true whatever it is that can feel he himself can't even cancel it or glory to God because it's mulch pocket it can't come back empty your deliverance cannot come back empty your healing can come back and your freedom your victory can come back because it come out the mouth of God not the motive man Mulder man will fail but once the motive God speaks head or glory to God hallelujah not man's word he said my world shall return to me void Oh hallelujah so core of the sentence word in this hour to call out the people his name Jacob Ryan isn't done right so in the beginning was the word the Word was with God or because in the beginning was Elohim and the waters middle him isn't that right and it's the same thing just unfolding like the attribute is your thought and Gordon the big and eternal he wasn't even God he was eternal he wasn't even God because he was eternal he was Elohim the self existent one isn't that right and then he was worshipped and then he became God after creates any Angels he wasn't even that he was LM eternal but in him was thoughts here we go that he wanted to become material he wanted to become sail out material for glory Liguria sons locked up in him he had ports locked up in him and he wanted to become material and the Bible says and the word became flesh and dwelt among us so the thought comes from thought the word then the word becomes flesh and when the word become flesh is material so Jesus wasn't just flesh he was the word made flesh that's what you want to be Oh glory to God you are gonna be the living world the word itself made flesh Oh glory the poor until all this was a message riding me for a while and it will tie right into what but Isaac spoke last service in particles of this vine nature so let's go he was even that he was Elohim the eternal but her name was thoughts he wanted to become material and what did he do he spoke a word and the word was materialized dönitz here we go that's the whole picture from Genesis to Revelation it's nothing wrong it is Elohim materializing so he can be touched so he can be felt so full court was above us in the Fatherhood God was with us in the son Jesus Christ and God promised to come into you he always wanted a dwelling man he always wanted you to be his house to be an actor and he's one of our people that he go to live in Oh glory to God are you are you ready this morning oh this is a good menu this morning oh this is a full seven-course menu this is not soup it's a little more than that this morning hallelujah praise God praise God are you ready and then then he said in the Millennium there'll be LOM sitting on the throne that's right with all his subjects i wronged him that he predestinated before the function of the world from things that are out to be your bullet here was pre-planned shot on that one don't tell me or what the ones that bought you and you're coming if I didn't want you and your mother didn't want you and it was a mistake forget that yeah you're good here was pre-planned when that sperm hit that egg listen is a million and ton load as firms and that's one egg and you as among all of them some fell so some corn so some missile some jump over so but court pre-plan your birth on this earth he won't mistake you are not here by chance do not even a little service by chance get the Lord a shout in the hope your birth was pre-planned missus it every one of you knows that our borders we plan did you know that your being here never originated as a myth or thought everything was or pre-planned by God before the foundation of the world that you would be here the inside night God knows and to be infinite you know every free will be on the earth you know much time in the batter's eye that's infinite our phantom mind our our finite minds cannot fathom it and if we know the Word of God we know where we are living we know the are we live in it we know what lays ahead we see what we have past the book of God is the revelation of Jesus Christ his work to the ages that was up to the book of Revelation then his promises that is to come so all of his promises are true give the Lord a shelter not all of his promises are true and God cannot speak anywhere without that being confirmed every word that he says has to come to pass under Paris at all that Bella near shall worship the Beast except those whose names written before the foundation of the world so you have to know this morning that God put your name in the blood section Lamb's Book of Life before the phone tip that's why if the shout this morning that's why not because your bills not because the roof came in not because you can't break down but because your name is on the book jesus calling disciples don't rejoice because the devil is subject to you but rejoice because your name is written Laurie the dog give the Lord a shock you have no husband rejoice you have no wife rejoice you have no children rejoice Prince plug it on that job yet you rejoice they don't wanna give me your pistol rejoice rejoice in the hole and come money don't forget that glory the godly choice because your name is written you're not my boyfriend rejoice their other children rejoice in the Lord some shows giving some praises he is really warrior God hallelujah [Applause] maybe Caesar let this Tabernacle be filled with praises the Bible said their praises the result of rejoicing isn't a time lock of the righteous no come here with like none of you have a witness and then no gesture here and here no you got to be participating this is your service this is your worship this is your God be talking about what glory to god this is your expectation this is your revival you are bringing it you are stirring it or go you are one can add you actually if any atmosphere that the Holy Ghost can come down you are doing there maybe season so here the predestinated plan in plain view just as other seed the Word of God is a seed must have good grown prepared beforehand if you saw a seed and throw it out there on the ground but do not good the bush will pick it up you treat among pistols and torture but choking ah pretty soon and Jesus parable said so how are you here we go so the drum has to be made ready first are you ready so God in sovereign grace prepares the heart face and he prepared you before the foundation of the world to receive him and this age he foreknew you and biased for knowledge and/or Dean you to eternalize he knew you therefore he prepared you I was prepared for the battle since before the foundation of the world that's why I'm fightin heat of thought Wesley fought and you not gonna sit there and stare you going to fight for the kingdom of God suffer violence and the violent take it by force the kingdom is preached and every man every man every man or you're preaching back to me this morning or give the Lord a praise offer Rory I'm gonna be seein God saw every one of your sins every one of your failures every one of your shortcomings have you one of the character flaws and he still predestinate you and put your name on the book you know what you're gonna do next week no other you next year you know all what's already done but he still put your name and who God justifier come on now I feel like I feel that run who God justified no man could condemn or give the Lord a shout in the home [Applause] who [Music] Gulen a church man you don't know pastor ban you belittle bishop but don't let a man die on you you are free Son of Man set free free indeed holy God this is fire on the word this is the anointed of the word we are saying what the tapes say we are preaching the revelation of the Son of Man you may be seated who you think was veiling that prophet what was stated they think I'm a desert if you don't idle words what Spirit spoken words that's what we can't just bring our own thoughts and ideas it has to be spirits words because I know that's why I know if I stay with this world don't bless me i watch god bless romantic close victory up on the donkey's cut bread but they can't take the blessing that sort of loose stuff upon your life the feast here with the world Oh glory to God let the dogs back but this time I'm moving on let the dogs back but we're moving on we have a rapture to go through little wedding supper to attend the Millennium we have a wedding supper or Killaloe a rapture come on now Oh hallelujah we have something to be excited about we go God hi Jesus [Applause] let's continue from spirit of truth I might not call her the names that box is too much that's like one tip I give it respect is the play tip and we to be players players up tips like if like if Gordon has to be T players not me I'm safer preacher you're causing to puppet the priests who want to play by the bottom the energy that's fine we played too but that's not it : no this is what we have to do I would like to tell you how much books I have to cover to get what I'm prettier today right now I bought about how about six already alright let's continue one of the great problems for God don't chew the years as the history of the church goes is to find somebody that he can completely get in his control everybody wanna be somebody but not somebody for God because God somebody is mash up men broken men God Mendes mistreat and what is break them you know you have to break them to make them because gonna leave them they were act just like Manda's with the greed and the selfishness and the politics that is man as he neared young man you remove one crop the next one is that occasional end up crooked because that doesn't mean the heart of man is desperately wicked spider who can know it but God so that's why go sit good man I'll give you a new heart you need a new one let's let's take a transfer give me your old one give you a new heart I'll give you our new spirit and I'll put my spirit into your spirit cause you connect with my word okay the Lord a shout in the house so the issue has always been a man surrendered to God JC people want supernatural and signs and wonders and purifying lights and so on they won't go to come down and so on to say I am right and all others is wrong and God is not on that God not I'm trying to vindicate a church or a man he's here about vindicating his word if I die in the morning the word is still true if I die in the morning the promise is correct this word will be confirmed oh give the Lord a Shh all right he know what he needs one man he always used one man at a time we started a few nights another group you just want one that's all he needs cause two men have two different ideas he just takes one man and watch he just makes one man he represent himself true that one person never did he do it otherwise and he's got one person today and that person is the one we just read after the Holy Spirit that one send me the man he had one person that is the Holy Spirit he is the person that God has sent forth the spirit of Jesus Christ into the earth the Spirit of God the manifest and declare Christ to his church just to continue his life to the church he Christ was the Living Word of God yes why because he was expressing God to himself he was soul completely surrendered to the word till he and the world was the same and that's exactly what the church ought to be today that the Word of God is the same what is he saying we have to become the very Living Word of God itself isn't that right so therefore you have a choice today to receive the word inwardly and willingly as opposed to be outwardly informally you have a choice to receive the word as from God or if it was a man trying a little thing was a man trying something well he trying something but if it's a Word of God you have to receive it in early and willingly because they receive the word you become the word itself so butter Branham was brain father we thank thee that I would I would his truths we tangley for the Holy Spirit who is the Living Word here tonight to manifest any divine blessings that God Almighty has promised and now Lord Jesus to see that you were conceived here and is lit by the Holy Spirit and he wrapped himself in a blood cell broke the cell open Calvary no man takes his life alarum his life freely and the blood cell was broken here we go because the spirit could be made free from the blood coming into the body again coming through the blood it was given and his body came water blood and spirit just like a natural bird water blood and spirit and I pray tonight if there's someone here who has never come into the body of Christ watch now to become a full believer sealed unrecognized by the Father God that this would be the right night that they will receive it granted Lord to thy mercy we ask oh praise God so the true call of God is the broken blood cell of Christ that released the Spirit of God to pull you into the body and by one Spirit we are baptized into that body not into a church in a church a fellowship but that spirit pulls you into the body of Christ where you are placed into the body of Christ so he Christ was deity himself made flesh on earth the manifest his love to the people under take away sin of the earth he came here in order that he could anchor depth in his own body because that was the curse the day you eat thereof the day you die so death was the curse upon the earth so he came to anchor death like a stinger he came to pull debt and unlatch it in his body I posit that where is your sting grave where's the victory because Jesus come on Brit because of debt that we'd have to fear death no more but we could free that's why I come that you might have life and have it more abundantly Oh give the Lord some praise as people listen listen he came here in order to anchor death in his own body you can anchor sickness in his own body or glory to God the kiss that ought to have been on you he took it upon himself and had to die like a man in order to redeem you back in the full fellowship with the father full fellowship or chlorine Oh God that's the power of love that's the power of redemption for God so loved the world he gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life what praising him on the Lord my god what a marvelous thing our hearts can't conceive what a thing that was what he did we are too slow or mine little sluggish the vowels have been stopped up they've been paralyzed by unbelief and fear and doubt it can't work flow free like it should do it unless unless we let the Holy Spirit so dominate our lives till it pushes those vows then life begins to stop operated Oh glory to God the mechanics is there you know but the vows cut up but but we want the Holy Spirit to so dominate our lives that the fast are the kind of moving

keep you hooked if the Lord a shout the spirit kind of lead you wrong well glory to God amen Oh glory to God so the word have to come into your flesh on your feet and then it becomes life and then you become a living example then you are epistle of God read by all men Oh glory to God looting them disciples in the early days our Bibles the bad was even written yet the New Testament was written yet and then Old Testament was big long screws so they can't walk along with a coat I'm big screws wrong a rule in the prophecy no they were the living will itself when the speak was the word it was the Word made flesh Oh hallelujah Oh glory to God you believe that Thank You Laura so the mind in Christ you take the word just like he did because he was the word and the man of Christ in you you are the word you are the gods live in word representatives of him here on the earth continue the work the church should be that way so the Bible is manifested again like in the early days of the disciples they had no scripture what they were preaching what scripture because they were the Living Word and we'll come back to that you know after court knowledge yes they'll come on all we do have the caution or we will be decodes be caught made flesh or chlorine a continuation of the Living Word or glory Christ veiled in Tabernacles walking on two feet in Trinidad you may see that yet but it won't happen Oh glory to God however recognize Christ you're gonna walk like him you're gonna talk like him you're gonna live like him you're gonna love like him you're gonna forgive like him ain't gonna he like him you're gonna act like him that's how you know Christ Oh God no I'm not Amida butsu mañana got plenty - I'm a talking murder mystery see my hello so he was Hitler and find like a blasted ministries no it's not a blossom mist regional is the emphasis and mysteries without a life that is that is a challenge to me because if it is mysteries then the most mysterious pressure he had to have it it's just that Paul already handled that by said oh you know all mysteries and have all knowledge and don't have charity you're still back to square one you just like a man we're talking no mysteries say talking Greek a cocking lactating you're talking what kind of thing and people had just resumed all they know the nutrition and there's a you know as a mighty man because he could talk mighty and you had doing something was what we're getting service I was I was blessed you click you see what we shot last week you put a pig in a cage you put your pig on a legalism you lock him up you Pig musty be be be quiet he lock up in the cage and here on a truck going to the slaughter they pick just didn't make any noise night but loosen it first mud poorly season it he said this is mines this is what I'm claiming because he's a pig he do have a lamb nature the pig goes back to limited because he's bound by legalism and that is why some people love legalistic preachers because keep them in a kid's left turn and they love that could Amanda's the control yourself to the man that's why people like communism they control yourself so they want a man to control them you see the God's law is internal man's law is external that's right now jail and prison for people can be hit yourself lock up arrest throw in jail judge thanks for the people that cabbie you deserve but really and truly God want the law to be internal but you know how to behave yourself that's what the cost will come to bring about behavior because you behavior is what set you to adoption it's not just son is the right kind of a son so we never much son always the right kind it have all kind of son Rascals son ropes son Rennie good son but God one day right pain that what kind of ministers men that not call halfway call when I'm talking to some of them cut it off but they're doing this stuff on a hot the fact did you reckon Hyundai destroyin Paul in Paul is ported calling them enemies of the cross but one thing I rejoiced is a crisis breached this is the enemy's country people the enemies of the cross he said but his consolation that Christ is preached at least at least something about Christ but them as well practice dogs and already call them real characters but this is the gospel and we have the same thing No so watch here we go I already so Christ the Bible's manifested again like an Elise of Christ cause are you ready you are a predestinated seed just like Christ was you know heard what we said before your heart is prepared you're built has been pre-planned and now you're here that you are a predestinated seed just like Christ was and when the rain falls under seeded the life produces itself when the Holy Spirit falls so forget about her in the rain coming there is another issue is if you have the seed because their life will produce itself when the rain falls or give the Lord a shout so the most important thing is for you to receive seed on top of world on top of world what seed promises by these promises you become a partaker of course divine nature by what by promises so for the random came that introduced us to precious promises I promise you this I promise you that I promise you the Holy Ghost I promise I promise I promise I promise that's what you're receiving you under promise your child of the kingdom your child a promise just think those guys in Egypt okay God made a promise to bring them out into our landfill Millican honey isn't that right praise God I'll and fluid milk and honey nice actually some of me really powerful why milk and honey milk come from a cow honey come from birds and birds and from bees and birds and bees need flowers and everything else so he was actually saying that land would be prosperous with vegetation with animals with flocks on everything either way for us milk and honey gonna be dear no listen didn't acts for the promotional God give the problems come on now they didn't ask to the promised God released the promise I'm gonna bring y'all bless you milk and honey Oh glory to God Amen this struggle to the wilderness the struggle the struggle the struggle the struggle until they came to knish Minea he tell the ministers listen take 12 mins spies and spy on a line and come back and bring a report to the people that they will know I am true I am faithful I am honest I'm genuine about my promises ten men come back to lead to other brothers see about behind just runkiller ten men come early and Ibaka Evo report what was the evil report listen the land is a good land but we can't take it because we saw Giants somebody after the giant sea you know didn't see us but we sure saw them and they bigger than you think and that brought our dread over the whole camp and stunt their faith in God Caleb and Joshua came back late and went to meet the camp and depression no praise and worship everybody mumbling and grumbling and shoo-shoo in his side and everybody went dark lose like in the morning I'm Caleb and Joshua them in the spirit no with grape juice or and all the clues working wet on soup done with grape juice from the land up was flew in with all them stuff and Balram said Caleb was the shortest man and the whole camp he got on a box and said we are well evil now I love how God has do this stuff you know they talk about giants and he showed this man come and serve and I often say we well over let us go up once I take this life and I could imagine I can imagine the Cambodian but look at shorty I can imagine you can say monkeys here yes Giants and he'll say let's go up at once we are wherever doctors feet you think he didn't see Giants ooh kill em sorry Giants too but he was hearing from the Giants he was hearing what God said and when you hear what God said Giants don't intimidate you for every Goliath there is a stone or get the Lord a shout Lori are you here with me for every Goliath there is a stone and when you understand what God said that coordinate of man that would lie you not gonna be intimidated by any child hallelujah so you are predestinated seed just like Christ was say after me I am a predestinated seed shed again I am a predestinated seed that's who you are Oh glory to God a predestinated seat that's right the delicateness of you while you were drinking smoking running around you still have to come because Jesus at all that the father had given me he'll come or give the Lord a show get the Lord a praise stop condemning yourself stop condemning yourself god call you the devil is a liar or glory to God every seat at the comfort [Music] you are predestinated seed just like Christ was and when the rain falls on the seed the life produces itself when the Holy Spirit falls what did Jesus tell him in acts 1:8 you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost come upon you power for what but what to pray follow the little holy life power to overcome power to forgive power to repent power to pass the battle ha hallelujah praise God big Pokemon power after the Holy Ghost what you supposed to be looking for the Holy Ghost that's your promise so when I fell on those seeds that he chose when before the foundation of the world they were predestined I see Peter who denied him three times we told us he was predestinated I wanted to bring it real to you Peter who denied I don't know him I don't I don't even know simple yeah you ain't Church no no no not not me wrong man when he said a curse that is not him maybe not here because Kristen Lucas then Peter wept I am saying to you he was a predestinated see this is the part I want to get to this emotional seed for going here disciples 120 this Harlem says up in the upper room these seeds the word and the word was laying on dear without life in it when there were any upper room they were the word without life waiting for the Holy Ghost waiting for dynamics waiting for the power but they were the word because Luke 24 Jesus opening understanding to the scripture and open the word to them they knew who they were or they were predestinated seeds there was sons of God original seeds tribute thoughts of God let's continue let's continue and the world was laying there without life in it and all of a sudden they came from a song from heaven as the waters began to gush down and it actually fell all the house where they were sitting and the seeds begin to grow to begin to manifest itself the Word of God be made manifest in other words joy to was an effect what did Joe say shall come to pass that I poured my spirit upon all flesh young men shall see visions all men shall dream dreams that was a prophecy from joy or glory to God Isaiah 28 with stammering lips and other tongues that speak to these people so Jesus seasoned on with these promises so when the Spirit fall it was fallen in connection to the prophecy of joy I forgive that's right Peter came and said this is that that the Prophet Joel because before become materialized it has to be spoken all glory of God and before it is spoken it's got to be the pots of God or give the Lord a show certain thoughts of God drop-down prophesy angel Rafi Sinai sire and there goes the Upper Room [Applause] what about you and I this morning halleluyah halleluyah my my my it began to manifest itself the would have got being manifested you see there's no profit you see now why I have been so Seles of the kind of seed that I planted for the body what what if we saw back on now what if we saw confusion what we if we show again some other children some acid that is in other words we can gain stolen dropping on this one that doesn't give us adoption Lord revealed to me years ago a crashing somebody doesn't put you up so I beat up this one and beat that one that doesn't put you up bless people other people oh yes inspire people save them it love them isn't that right watch you see why I've been so zealous of the kind of seed I planned for the body the rain is going to fall pretty soon no I mean the real rain and it's got to have C to fall on he's I hope I live to see it well God didn't allow him to live to see it but we gonna see it when the real rain fall on DC's here fallen faith and virtue and knowledge on temperance all these laying inside of you right now right now a pyramid has been built inside of you it's the word inside of your pyramid is already inside of you or glory to God and seed form or glory reen have to fall on that green have to fall on that green have to fall on that Jesus was God's seed and he had to wait for the rain and he was going down to John to be baptized and when he birthed baptize the dove the ring the power the dynamics in the fullness come upon Jesus and he become the anointed son this is my beloved son this is Jesus no carpenter's son as it was doing carpentry this is Jesus if he is a silence from age 12 to 30 this is the same Jesus everybody seen making door and making cupboard and make whatever it is the Cap'n's oh isn't that right with this carpenter walking down to the Jordan River John baptizing and got jumped was told the one who you see the death come down and remain so if somebody dove hit and fly off you know like anyone because maybe somehow they don't get them and fire off but this one the dog have to remain that's the one so when Jesus came even who he was but when he saw that does he know that's the Messiah he said you should baptize me she said that might be so but we have to fulfill all righteousness wash this land brother or chlorine or club-record Islam is about to be crucified Oh glory to God and John baptized him and Jesus let by the spirit let by the spirit into the wilderness to overcome the lust of the eyes to overcome the lust of the flesh to overcome the pride of life to overcome the attacks of the devil and all he did was to say this written what was he saying that for for you for me it is written because it has to be spoken for it to be written and once it is written that word cannot be defeated the world will defeat the devil anywhere anytime anyplace under any condition that's the word or give the Lord a shout Jesus defeated the devil not by powerful by the way [Applause] I'm known we could tell the devil it is written I'm gonna be fill it as written I'm a predestinated see that it's written I'm an attribute thought of what it is written my mouth was pre-planned it is written my half have been repaired pre-prepared to receive this word it is Ricky Oh glory to God I be healed by strike I was healed I'm already here I'm walking into my healing I'm walking into my deliverance that's why I'm gonna praise on pushing him this morning Oh glory to God hallelujah Oh glory so Jesus he was the Living Word why he was God's Word main manifests lemon were not spoken word only but Living Word the Bible said and the word became flesh it became a living word he was a living wood he was God's Word we manifest oh how I like to get into that cords wood made manifest in other words meat noon gourds wood made known in other words he was the one that God lived in to make his wood known Christ Express here we go what the word talked you see a lot of ministers let us talk about house manifest his sons makin the word known making God known and they're making it known as if it's more revelations more mysteries but listen what the Prophet said here he said what Christ expressed what the word talked [Music] [Applause] Christ after overcoming the devil returned here we go in the power of the Spirit when to the temple from the place where it is written because it must be spoken for us right so he found Isaiah 61 and he's read the scriptures the Spirit of God is upon me for he has anointed me what to open the eyes of the mind the heal the brokenhearted and to do this until there and appreciate acceptable that was the prophecy but then when that word become flesh he stepped out when they rejected him I'm a who are you Denny one this day this crypt is fulfilled and I was

son is that nothing happens a boy under Troy mode and then he said he the second reason it I Castle there was in other words is it good I become a rejecter stone and the because of manifests what the prophecy said where the bride will do the same right nowI bearing a reproach for the word i reproach of barrenness because we can produce all what what said yet because we written on the real rain but

the mountain he prophesied that to them and what happened praise God the Emperor came and surround the mountains they couldn't go nowhere but the disciples know what Jesus prophesied and all of a sudden they seize a day or something like that and the Emperor had to pull back and when he pull back the elected run out because he said when you see Jerusalem and compassed with armies flee to the mountains or everybody else who state and in general come back and then blood was shed cheerin was kill everything else the prophecies can fail God can't lie the world is true put God first let's continue so Christ was the expression of the word that was rude so we talking now beyond the letter now we're talking about beyond I'm in a message I have books I have tapes we talking about beyond I play tapes beyond that now you talk about you becoming the would manifested you so surrender that God could use you we not all my the preacher now he's a different thing all he had to take this to but you everyone become the very word manifested oh my hallelujah praise the Lord tonight he said we are getting into there's reason up amongst the groups counter comparison somebody trying to act like it and live a different life can't drink and can smoke a woman can live anybody want to still watch television and the things of the world and still columns and Pentecostals they are trying to impersonate gen a genuine it's never been revealed to them yet when it's revealed is glorious and something takes a whole out of you when you walk all the way you can't imprison it impersonation was dead Moses vo he was the Living Word to the people and today the people that are feel at the same thing they are written epistles read of all men not a new epistle but the Epistle that's been written made manifest it's doles who believe the word and the promise of this day that gourd is point of his spirit upon all flesh and that is written epistles I when a person tries to kindly impersonate that it backfires because their life shows what you are so what is the word of what is a manifestation of a thought it's an expression of a thought right before you see anything subconsciously you tink it before you speak it he taught and he spoke a word and the word has made manifest and every word in the Bible is God towards lead in seed form and that's just the law he put it that's why Gordon come down as a man he's a virgin shall conceive which is the seed of the woman isn't that right though he's not right he come as a see Jesus isn't a right so every word in the Bible is God taught Slayton seed form and if receive into human being spoke by the same taught that materialized the Bible it brings it into pass how powerful could the church be the Bible says let his mind I was in Christ being you as a man thinketh in his heart so is he now you're taught if they become expression okay oh he's got nothing to you know me like God shall let there be a world before it could be a word it had to be a thought so God in the creation created the world by his thought and then spoke it then he expressed it then it become material oh my and if that same spirit I said let there be light and there was light said let there be trees and there was trees and if that seemed mine that was in Christ being you and you say let there be no cancer then it would be gone let the blind eyes be open then it would be so it's you're taught or glory to God so what we're looking for now is the main of God to drop down that the toughts of God could come down however you speak is not our word it's God's thought expressed which is this word that can fail or give the Lord a shout do you see it now we're not talking about a suggestion we're talking about God stinking comment dong into your heart when you speak you're speaking the thoughts of God which is the Word of God half feet and God isn't that right now you can express it by mental conception but if it becomes a real revelation of God you see it before it happens and you express it in Word form and that word takes a whole and becomes material a tort Express and how God if your heart and your mind is so in filled with God's Spirit until your thoughts become his thoughts when your mind and your leaden and your guidance becomes a direct place a direct inspiration of the Holy Spirit that's moving in your water being what kind of people should we be if the very Holy Spirit has you so empowered so embodied that you don't use your own thoughts you don't use your own mind you don't use your own opinion but chords but the Holy Spirit has you so built until your thoughts and your beam is God's Spirit expressing itself through you what kind of church should we be this is the kind of chest you should want this is how you should want us to be minister everybody expression God Manti no hollowed out oh god you know Oh glory to God and the Spirit of God could express himself to the flesh of that man would mean flesh the Living Word what kind of people would be this morning if this Branum Tabernacle this morning was so filled with the presence of God why you wouldn't even use your own mind didn't even use your own thoughts it has no alternative of your own just to be led by the spirit they that are sons of God are led by the Spirit of God and when the human element moves out or chlorine of God and the Spirit of God since that vacancy one goes out and something comes in the human element goes out and the Spirit of God fills the vacancy when you empty yourself out then will be the church we have its power in the resurrection of the Lord Jesus will walk in his steps in his power in his torch then your thoughts will become words and words will become material oh no wonder the purpose said oh we lay hands upon the set now but then we'll be speaking the word or chlorine of God no more laying on hands just the power of God the heel blind see lame walk Oh glory to God after church is coming for that's the super church is coming for Oh glory no God listen watch they refused the things of the world what the torch is just to safeguard their thoughts move on they refuse the sins of the world they move in the spirit live in the spirit walk in the spirit and so fulfill the law of Christ then the love of Christ in the human heart moving in the Holy Ghost that great wonderful church will go forward power and deity because deity will be revealed in human beings how by the Holy Spirit bringing to the past the thought of their mind I want to read a quote again because deity will be revealed in human beings not by mystery mystery mystery and teaching teaching teaching on world world world and mechanic mechanic we had a four years deity will reveal human beings by the Holy Spirit bringing to pass the thought of their mind the fish was dead for half an hour and the purpose a little fishy I give you back your life in the name of Jesus Christ and the fishes flip over and gone this way before the doctors hand touches my wife the tumor will go down and he wasn't even in the country that would pass through time barrier distance hallelujah and go right between the doctors knife under two months put it right down Oh hallelujah whoo speaking God speaking Oh hallelujah he's speaking for his wife and his God speaking because he tapped into the thoughts of God and we have a word from the Lord let this mind I was in Christ be in you so that's all that is part of your redemptive rites come on now come on now [Applause] yeah you know some fathers that half fight with his sons and some mothers have fight with the daughters and they all kind of all kind of petty - all right God doesn't have that when when God's sons begin to manifest sin he is feel proud he's feel good about it god I cannot fight you activator just like him you talk about Adam was supposed to be a God of the earth come on G isn't that right he had dominion over the earth he could control the earth because that is what we were pleased here for and Jesus demonstrated that power and control when he said peace be still when he could take water isn't that right until it into wine and bypass all the processes he piped all the grapes all he personally Orlick fermentation if I pass all that act and he could convert it into wine because He is God he can handle the processes and bring it true and he can handle your processes and bring your true so the prostitute all the filthy woman whatever it is he could handle them and bring them true and convert them and change them into the ladies Oh glory to God that's why they could be genuine Christians you could think the drunkards on the drug addicts and bring them straight true there's nothing is too hard for the Lord he demonstrated because they are all woman like Sarah and transformed as a brief word Isaac nothing is right for the Lord or glory of God a little shepherd boy like David he can anoint him to be king and they were all ready yet nothing is too hard for the law doesn't happen up you don't have to be ready you don't have to be ready as long as the promises yours you don't have to be ready see a man at the promise you don't have to be ready you don't have to be ready but you will be ready you may be seated all these precious promises you were slamming into his disciples they couldn't handle it yet give them a taste of power watch you can empower on the calm upon the comment if never subjected us require quite fill us with joy because it your name in the book next next time sabes comments it's Lord we see somebody pushing your name but

push right next to Christ you see I have a better copy they could drink it let them drink that cup you all right side on the left side you see I am NOT in charge of who would and right side and left side there are some issues among them but when they went in the upper room under the promise of the Holy Ghost all our sons Oh glory to God ha all our sons waiting for the promise of the father he said behold I send the promise of my father upon you tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high friends you come in the church come on the expectation for power from on high I didn't promise it God did God can't lie to you you're gonna have Oh Gloria lagoon amen let's continue oh praise the name of the Lord so this gospel praise but the promise is the every surgeon unless on the road if you left your home tonight a sinner I'll walk over to the brown time I could go out giving opportunities at night there was wanting lays between you in the promised land what is the promised land the Holy Ghost what live between Josh on a promise on Jordan oh praise God so watch the promise watch o all down to the the promise is the baptism of the Spirit which is promised to the Old Testament and knew to behold I send the promise of my father upon you Peterson under the Pentecost that is the promise the promised land here we go is to live in this land of Holy Spirit that is God's promise for the church is to live in the power of the Spirit it's another world it's another land you have to come out of the conditions you have been in to come out and live in the promised land to receive the promise remember the promise you shall receive power from on high after this the Holy Ghost come upon you nobody have any excuse to come for anything else you can come to see this one on that one yeah come to see somebody's clothes you come to get the promise from on high are you with me do you see what they come for what would I do in the upper room they were praising and blessing God continually because the Holy Ghost Carmel and dry the Holy Ghost come down on deadness it has to have an atmosphere and the atmosphere of worship and praise that is what the Holy Ghost come down into isn't that right but abandom you believe this to be the Bible God's Word okay I'll back up this is on as I wasn't Moses I'll be with thee just no bill first this is a take a look at the 11th of September 1960 remember here we go I want you to get this you can only be saved by your personal feet you can only be healed by your personal feet you believe this to be the Bible God's Word you believe your pastor to be a man of God whatever church you go to if you don't usually leave it that's what the Prophet said don't believe the man is a man of God should leave it watch get to a man that is a man of God then if you believe him believe he's telling you the truth then accepted your own personal faith and Christ saves you no matter how good your pastor is how godly saintly your mother is how real the Word of God is how much you cry how much you pray it's your feet that saves you your personal feet and that is why I have the commnity you what you say what you believe what you act on him and your worship now the same thing applies no matter God's Word that we said in the last days to straight summers no I brought natural Israel and spiritual Israel together we are looking for the Joshua of this name here we go which is the Holy Spirit do you get it so just run as I mind somewhere I will give the judge for the clean name Joshua Joshua is the Holy Spirit to lead us to the land he has to speak to somebody because he's a spirit I've told you what he told me no you believe and be healed this is beautiful because called what God was veiled in brother Branham speaking this is I told you he said now you believe and be healed did you notice that the Moses the great miracle performer brought Israel down to the land brought him up to the promised land but did not place the inheritance to them he did not give them inheritance he led him up to the land but Joshua devises Atlanta the people is that right and Christ here we go brought the church up to a place where the position was made possession was made to them was given to them just rolling the cross but the Holy Spirit is the one who sets the church in order the Joshua of the day puts the church in order given to each one gifts places position and he's the voice of God speaking in the inner man that Christ has saved the Holy Spirit and then he talked about Joshua and Caleb they heard a murmur and the people or it can be done can be done and Caleb run out in the midst of the people and quiet them yes it can be just what stood by him certainly it can be God given to us amen what was it he had the secret behind Caleb and Joshua they were positionally born in Christ they had a knowledge of the word and the word became manifested remember every one of those Israelites had the would preach to them but it only took effect upon Caleb and Joshua to realize what it was all about so that is the revelation Joshua and Caleb even though they were part of the whole bunch they were clearly had a position in Christ and they had revolution was all about and when your aversion was about nobody could show you off nobody could set you back Oh glory to God because cut to you what your inheritance is isn't that right so if the emphasis here sets us like just four positionally if from here manases there and God here Benjamin dear so no Minister could place the church or place me or place somebody I can place you God has to please you as his sons and daughters do you believe that how God set some in the church through their labor pains they kept tremendous sometimes when a church here we go church are you ready oh don't tell me no we are a home stretch I know we just call extra time but I'm not notice I'm not getting tired right could this have our function to bring this thing today praise God amen watch when a church is groaning under the persecution of the outside world and that's gonna come push the Christian gonna come and you see a whole different thing in this message yes believe in our Lord Jesus that the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as real to us as it was the Penta curse how they groan and cry under labor pains but when they are born one and positionally born to into the kingdom of God then the Holy Ghost has set in the church some apostles some prophets some teachers some passes some evangelists there's a faithful ministry not before I want to say it again this is a wood from the Prophet this is dusty at the Lord God has two porn and positionally born ten God sets in the church not a man say he's a pastor and therefore he that makes him a five home minister no or

to say this choice have it destroyed Duchess all of it nice foolishness it will not be a church it has to be the word manifested so you are written epistles and Baram says they were ignorant and unlearn but they were written epistles read that they have been with Jesus called Jesus was manifested instead of true them here we go Christ filled in their flesh manifested made alive like he was in Moses oh praise the name of the Lord Oh glory to God do you see that so go to heaven then watch I went into Christ and I'll go to angolan to the bride so when announcing the fire Hakeem Lyon they were judged because God had a neutron in the heart of Peter isn't that right no everybody can be a preacher but you got a voice hallelujah if they can't preach the people a sermon you're still a preacher if you're a preacher you're called to the pulpit to preach if you're not you're still a preacher but live the people a sermon let your sermon be lived and it's the voice of God not to bring a reproach then we reject it they will say if there's any amount of God it's that man a woman live your sermons those how to preach them if you're not called to be a preacher you'll get mixed up and messed up your tongue to people up to Unruh in them and yourself live your sermons the preachers quota preaches and to live it if you can live it then stop preaching it but you're supposed Olivia Munn's then barber mom said voices how we need in chess in Seville thousands of lived voices hallelujah praise God the thunder of God turning out in sweetness and holiness and purity undefiled eyes walking around the earth today without a blemish yes sir real Christians that's the Tunde against the enemy the devil donkey outlawed Ujala the devil talking much it jump up and down what hurts the devil is to see sanctified holy life consecrated to God see anything to him call him anything just as sweet as can be we're right on that chose him away that's the Tunder that shakes the devil some say well if he could preach like Billy Graham or about somebody a great integral speaker who sometimes the devil just laughs at that he don't pay no more than she's met and met him you got holy theology you want all the seminary trained and ever just sit back and laughs I mean holy they really laughing laughing at geology but when he sees that life he can laugh at that because you know what I'd like did back there in the right look at all these houses back there that mean that channel but the Epilepsy saying come out of him there will come an endeavor and a deficit in this and no aren't you making a podium of yourself they were talking to them now you see what you're doing Jesus told you he commissioned you to cast me on another one you can do it but brother when they seemed come one come walking quietly he didn't have to see nothing the devil was already scared right there he knowed he had to leave cause he had come a life not a sermon but a life not mysteries a life not more revelations a life he said come out of him that done it quietly he know what he was talking about oh praise the name of the Lord please God God is not my simplicity and a revelation of Jesus Christ in the most illiterate person oh please isn't that right know what I rock accepted your life is gone and he has the preeminence and you show the preeminence to the people and they see the very life and works inside so in other words you see it has to come to a manifestation we put too much emphasis on the mechanics it has to come the dynamics by lack of this revelation is why are so many different divisions and so much mockery so much divisions because the people lack the revelation the teachers lack the revelation so who can really boost and say I have it who can claim money that's why I ask years ago which Minister need which church which man have the minister of Jesus Christ none so all the big claims on this fighting and big sword fighting and agree and championship together they're only laughing you know because devil s in nothing to make him move yet but I'm say when they start me a permanent devil didn't tell you know them excited is when Peter said silver gold have I none nothin Peter go attracts you know not gonna be a plate tip you know nobody was talking when he said silver and gold have I none such as I have I give it unto you that is money there is no no this is
