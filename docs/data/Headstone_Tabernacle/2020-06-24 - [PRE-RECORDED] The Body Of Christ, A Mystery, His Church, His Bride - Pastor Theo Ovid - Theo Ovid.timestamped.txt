[19:02] Oh
[19:07] I like an attorney Bibles the Ephesians
[19:12] up24 Colossians chapter 1 and first
[19:17] corinthians chapter 12 first capture
[19:19] freedom reading Ephesians chapter 4
[19:27] verse 11 to 16
[19:35] and it gives some apostles some prophets
[19:37] some evangelists some pastors and
[19:39] teachers for the perfecting of the
[19:42] Saints for the work of the ministry for
[19:44] the edifying of the body of Christ till
[19:48] we all come in the unity of the faith
[19:49] and of the knowledge of the Son of God
[19:51] unto a perfect man unto the measure of
[19:54] the stature of the fullness of Christ
[19:56] that we hence what we no more children
[19:58] tossed to and fro carried about with
[20:01] every wind of doctrine by the three of
[20:04] men and cunning craftiness whereby they
[20:06] lie in wait to deceive but speaking the
[20:09] truth in love may grow up into him in
[20:12] all things which is the head even Christ
[20:15] from whom the whole body fitly joined
[20:18] together and compacted by that which
[20:21] every joint supplieth according to the
[20:24] effectual working in the measure of
[20:26] every part make an increase of the body
[20:29] unto the edifying of itself in love
[20:34] Colossians 1 reading verse 16 to 18
[20:40] speaking about Jesus and he is the head
[20:43] of the body the church who is the
[20:45] beginning the firstborn from the dead
[20:49] that in all things he might have oh
[20:54] sorry
[20:55] from 16 I'm sorry first Colossians 1:16
[20:59] for by him all things created that in
[21:04] heaven and that an earth visible and
[21:06] invisible whether they be Thrones or
[21:08] dominions or principalities or powers
[21:11] all things were created by him and for
[21:13] him and he is before all things and by
[21:18] him all things consist
[21:21] and he is the head of the body the
[21:24] church who is the beginning the
[21:28] firstborn from the dead that in all
[21:30] things he might have the preeminence and
[21:33] last krypter from 1st Corinthians
[21:35] chapter 12 wanna read verse 13 it says
[21:41] for by one spirit are we all baptized
[21:44] into one body whether we be Jews or
[21:46] Gentiles
[21:48] whether we be bond or free and I've been
[21:50] all me to drink into one spirit let us
[21:53] pray father God we thank you for your
[21:55] word and I pray a bit interpreter to the
[21:57] hearts of the people father God you know
[22:00] what your place upon me and I pray that
[22:01] you give it to me that I give it to them
[22:03] may blessed land confirm a word with
[22:06] signs wonders miracles and deliverances
[22:08] in Jesus name I ask it amen amen you may
[22:11] be seated praise God hallelujah
[22:28] and my inspiration is from Matthew 16
[22:35] when Jesus asks the question who do men
[22:38] say either son of mine am and then he
[22:41] asks his own disciples who do you see
[22:43] that I am and Peter said thou art the
[22:46] Christ the Son of the Living God and
[22:47] Jesus answered this is verse 17 of
[22:50] Matthew 16 and jesus answered and said
[22:52] unto Him blessed a dowse I'm about Jonah
[22:53] for flesh and blood hath not revealed it
[22:56] unto thee but my father which is in
[22:58] heaven
[22:58] and I say on the deed our Peter here we
[23:02] go
[23:02] and upon this rock I will build my
[23:06] church
[23:09] okay a backdrop but a Branham from a
[23:14] message called life the cars and that
[23:19] day will be shaped like an egg running
[23:22] back like this form here and it'll be
[23:25] controlled by some kind of power that
[23:27] won't even have to use the steering
[23:29] wheel at times just set up and it go
[23:33] like that see before the annihilate the
[23:36] annihilation you remember that
[23:39] that's on record a woman will take over
[23:43] woman will take over I've always said it
[23:46] will take overnighted States right here
[23:48] the worship of a woman from 17 week of
[23:51] Daniel now the 15 the Branham 9 into the
[23:54] tree had seven visions which he said
[23:57] must come to pass before Jesus come
[23:59] again he's talking about the fifth
[24:02] vision the sixth vision is the woman the
[24:05] seventh vision is when America was
[24:06] bombed up and smoke and so on
[24:10] listen to the fifth vision science will
[24:13] progress in such a way until they will
[24:15] make a car that will not have to be
[24:17] guided by a steering wheel and the cars
[24:20] will continue to be shaped like an egg
[24:22] until the consummation the untying
[24:26] I seen an American family going down the
[24:30] road in a broad way riding in a car with
[24:34] their backs turned towards where the
[24:37] wheel should be it looked like they were
[24:39] playing checkers of cars
[24:40] he says it's controlled by remote
[24:44] controlled by Rader
[24:46] they won't even have to have any
[24:47] steering wheel in it just set your dial
[24:50] like a dial your phone your car takes
[24:52] you right onto it a cataract or nothing
[24:55] no other kinds the magnets keep the rest
[24:57] of them away from you
[24:58] see they got it I predicted this 30
[25:00] years before it happened
[25:01] and the reason I'm reading this because
[25:05] this week passed about four years ago
[25:07] Google who have been working on
[25:11] driverless cars cars that you don't need
[25:13] to drive and so on they just released a
[25:16] prototype and they have demoed it it's
[25:18] just like an egg just like the Prophet
[25:20] said just cook like that gonna eat and
[25:21] they said it's like that shapes so it
[25:24] have no blind spots and they dismiss the
[25:27] steering wheels they say they don't need
[25:29] any steering wheel they no pedal they
[25:31] don't need no brakes
[25:32] you just because they be computer and
[25:34] the the reader whatever and so on will
[25:37] control the whole thing now Google I've
[25:39] been doing this for a couple of years
[25:40] now and they have a car chalked up 700
[25:43] thousand miles without one accident the
[25:46] caucus stuff for the red lights move on
[25:47] a child's are wrong all the sensor that
[25:50] there in other words you don't need to
[25:51] drive it and it's safe and and human
[25:53] beings who look em in the road and so on
[25:54] I'm seeing this because butter Brandon
[25:57] said this is going to be before the
[25:59] consummation or before the annihilation
[26:01] it's already here they don't need a
[26:04] steering wheel and I saw it the person
[26:05] was driving it that a blind person or
[26:07] somebody else and it just pressed it
[26:09] just one up the press you set where you
[26:11] go in the press and they say your phone
[26:12] will build a quality car bring the car
[26:14] to use is impressive what the Prophet
[26:16] says is kind of mind-blowing so I said
[26:18] I'll drop that in you and this is what
[26:20] the new said if you're an uneasy of the
[26:22] this is just what to treaties ago at the
[26:25] idea of rising in a vehicle that drives
[26:27] itself just wait till you see Google's
[26:28] new car it has no gas pedal no brake no
[26:31] steering wheel google has demonstrated
[26:33] its driverless technology for several
[26:35] years by retrofitting Toyota's Lexus is
[26:38] another cars with cameras and sensors
[26:39] but now for the first time the company
[26:42] has unveiled a prototype of its own cute
[26:44] little car that looked like a cross
[26:46] between a Volkswagen Beetle and a golf
[26:48] cart
[26:50] they won't have any steering wheel
[26:52] accelerator pedal or brake pedal because
[26:55] they don't need them Google said in the
[26:57] black spot unlike previous models these
[26:59] cars won't have human drivers monitoring
[27:02] them all the time
[27:03] Google said the cars can detect objects
[27:05] up to 200 yards away in all directions
[27:07] adjust your speed tune and brikene
[27:09] accordingly no driver no brakes so God
[27:15] sent the Prophet and it doesn't matter
[27:21] how long it takes to come to pass
[27:23] whatever that prophet said it's gonna
[27:25] come to pass because the Prophet goes up
[27:27] in the spirit goes into the future comes
[27:30] back and ball does see at the Lord he's
[27:32] not tell you what's not gonna happen
[27:33] he's telling you what already happened
[27:35] because he sees my vision brings God got
[27:38] to come to pass and that prophet said I
[27:40] believe the bride is called you already
[27:41] see you call I believe is sealed into
[27:44] the team of God
[27:45] you already see you sealed or Chloe God
[27:48] how many believe that this morning
[27:50] hallelujah praise God that means that
[27:53] you are gonna be delivered all glory to
[27:56] glory man hallelujah
[27:58] separation I will build my church the
[28:02] rebuilding of the church by the spirit
[28:04] in the last days but a Brannon preen
[28:08] their God one by one we are called one
[28:12] by one we have to meet the challenge to
[28:14] walk down to the valley of the shadow of
[28:15] death is due to every one of us as
[28:18] mortals but tonight you have offered us
[28:21] your petition that if we will believe on
[28:23] him and be baptized in his name you
[28:25] would take us in then in this body the
[28:28] body of Christ not in church but in the
[28:30] body of Christ that body has already
[28:33] been judged it will not have to come to
[28:35] judgment God poured out his wrath upon
[28:38] that body and that body is free from sin
[28:40] and being in him puts us free from sin
[28:44] by his atonement that died for us and in
[28:47] dear we have fellowship one with another
[28:49] while the blood of Jesus Christ God's
[28:52] Son keeps us clean from all sin and
[28:54] judgment God at this little altar of
[28:57] every heart present here and around the
[28:59] nation may the waters from the altar of
[29:01] god gosh down upon this long upon your
[29:04] church and water it Lord for the season
[29:07] just about finish give it life the
[29:10] waters of life that it might be able to
[29:12] lay in the presence of the Sun to be
[29:15] ripened for your great gana

[29:19] must dry so I cannot pray for it it must
[29:22] die so it is dead but I pray for the
[29:25] replied that's forming into the body of
[29:28] Christ
[29:29] Clawd grant that the fresh waters of God
[29:32] will keep its cheek bade with tears of
[29:34] joy and understanding until the combined
[29:38] comes to take it home in Jesus name I
[29:40] commit to you the results is yours

[34:23] knowledge we all know it
[34:25] listen I want you to get this it's the
[34:28] Word of God and denominational system
[34:32] there are two systems at work Esau and
[34:36] Jacob one after the spirit and the other
[34:40] after the flesh and they are fighting
[34:42] one another it's been so denominational
[34:46] and the word and then he said now it's
[34:48] always been that way and the reason
[34:50] they're bearing birth pains because as I
[34:52] fighting her
[34:53] there's Esau a man of the world verily
[34:56] just good fellow clean moral but he
[35:00] don't know nothing about the birthright
[35:01] he's born at me and Jacob I don't care
[35:04] what he is what he wants the built right
[35:07] he's the spiritual one and true today is
[35:11] in the womb of the church that's the
[35:13] great big system trying to be formed
[35:15] called the work on the churches and from
[35:18] the world that Jill is coming for two
[35:19] children the word here we go must
[35:22] deliver the word bright church come on

[35:53] we go
[35:53] damn that fell asleep in all ages
[35:59] we'll make up that bride that come out
[36:03] on the word that they come to put that
[36:06] they come out on your feet coming out to
[36:09] your head she gets greater the more you
[36:12] have as the body grows up so the body of
[36:15] Christ grows up and then finally the
[36:17] head will come to it and it's all linked
[36:20] to the head the head does the pulling so
[36:23] what I want to say to you today is this
[36:25] where I'm standing on this platform
[36:29] let's put this platform as the top of
[36:33] brotherly kindness there that means we
[36:38] are on the top of the ages that means
[36:42] the majority of bride that makes up the
[36:47] body is already called come on oh come
[36:53] on oh god is not know getting a list and
[36:58] so better start to make up the body
[37:00] this is finishing the body this is
[37:03] finishing of the seventh seal this is
[37:06] finishing he promised together all
[37:09] things and Christ
[37:11] in heaven at an act so let's look at it
[37:18] now the majority of the brain is below
[37:25] it was so bad that God allow the Prophet
[37:29] to put a little light to represent the
[37:32] bright and last is Christ is the head
[37:36] let's say this is the head coming down
[37:39] here now so the head is coming down we
[37:42] are in between which will put us in the
[37:45] rainbow the holy spirits lot with the
[37:49] head coming down and bright below the
[37:53] majority of them then we have to be
[37:55] stones called out to be fitted and when
[38:01] around setting this way to make the
[38:03] headstone that he could come into it
[38:06] make him dead below without us the can
[38:11] be perfect because we complete
[38:15] [Applause]
[38:26] Loreena God hallelujah hallelujah my god
[38:33] Oh glory to God when I begin to see this
[38:38] in the spirit realm when I began to see
[38:42] the magnitude of what God was doing all
[38:46] along how he called the Jews as a people
[38:50] and he came unto his own his own
[38:53] receiving not so he had to turn from the
[38:56] Jews and code to the Gentiles and Paul
[39:00] was an apostle to the Gentiles and he
[39:03] said across Britain to the partition
[39:06] between the Jews and the Gentiles and
[39:10] now by one Spirit we are baptized into
[39:15] one body the body of Christ his church
[39:20] [Applause]
[39:33] when I'm talking about the wheat Taco
[39:36] Bell the same boat in the same for you
[39:38] water by the same water same sunlight
[39:42] one is the word one is not the word
[39:46] under two a-fightin there have been
[39:49] fighting since the first traffic
[39:50] Reformation they are still fighting
[39:52] there we are
[39:53] there you are what system are you in Oh
[39:57] hallelujah or glory to God
[40:01] just imagine now if you would have lived
[40:04] back in the other day under the joltin
[40:07] of God's prophets and woods that comfort
[40:10] what side would you want to be on back
[40:12] there you got the same choice today she
[40:16] is fixed in to bring forth the perfect
[40:18] word back there and the word is coming
[40:22] for a word bride and as a woman is part
[40:25] of a man taking from him so the church
[40:28] will have to be a word abiding church
[40:31] every word of the Bible not systems not
[40:36] dogmas no watch
[40:38] they build so many systems around the
[40:42] word until then the Prophet come it
[40:45] shakes them notice whenever God comes on
[40:52] the scene it rocks the system because
[41:00] [Applause]
[41:13] from God God given vision God given
[41:17] purpose God give him a son because he
[41:20] hear from God
[41:21] [Applause]
[41:27] gonna be season no watch so when the
[41:32] Prophet come share birth pains
[41:34] what was it back to the word back to the
[41:38] life systems doesn't have a life it's
[41:43] only God's would have life systems are
[41:48] built around it it doesn't have life so
[41:53] if the system say everybody else falls
[41:55] on unit system then you see everybody as
[41:57] force is a system say everybody blue
[41:59] then you see everybody blue because the
[42:01] system said that but what does the word
[42:03] say then people who in the system have
[42:10] questions about the word but the bride
[42:13] have no questions because as a husband
[42:15] who made the reveal world once the world
[42:20] is revealed that's your husband don't
[42:22] wanna kiss him they want to hug him you
[42:25] want to hold him because that is your
[42:28] husband come on Sam and somebody Oh
[42:32] give the Lord some bull ring get the
[42:35] lights on bro

[42:40] so watch came on his own rejected go to
[42:45] the Gentiles what sitting up in his last
[42:47] day we don't raise up the tree with all
[42:50] eyes talented or knock what they do they
[42:52] kick out Christ he's outside
[42:54] he said any man hear my voice not church
[42:57] now individuals Oh glory to God Oh
[43:01] hallelujah we're gonna deal with that in
[43:04] the evening service if any man hear my
[43:06] voice and open up I'm gonna minister to
[43:09] him what Chloe did what he will open his
[43:11] mouth to the escaped ones
[43:14] [Applause]
[43:19] why why why because gonna come a famine
[43:22] in the last days for the hearing of the
[43:26] word of God then cor go to speak tyreq
[43:30] from God living here direct from God
[43:34] formal openness mouth Judy escape ones
[43:39] not to deceive ones
[43:41] no no escape ones escape the reception
[43:45] Oh hallelujah her glory they're gone so
[43:50] therefore systems are built along the
[43:53] life but only the word that give life
[43:55] watch something a little group will come
[43:57] out and believe in north time there's
[43:59] eight people caught Rock the remnant and
[44:02] destroy the rest of them to Rockaway but
[44:05] a banner preached a message qualified
[44:06] definite
[44:07] definite identifications of the true
[44:09] Church of the Living God and when God Oh
[44:13] pops certain things for me I didn't know
[44:16] it was spoken so it was a real
[44:18] excitement to find where the prophets
[44:21] pocket Oh glory to God listen to brother
[44:24] Branham he said the word church and in
[44:28] this is I want to speak to you what is
[44:31] the church who set it up what is this
[44:35] message how do we become a member of it
[44:37] and can we get the heaven without being
[44:41] a member of it and that's how we
[44:44] approach this message and we just go
[44:48] along now the first place the word
[44:51] church itself
[44:52] means they called out now Israel was not
[44:55] the church as long as they were in Egypt
[44:57] they were the people of God but when God
[45:00] call them out of Egypt they become the
[45:02] Church of God so God was always
[45:04] interested and having Church in his
[45:07] program of vision of church because they
[45:10] would have called out now that still
[45:11] remains the same today the word church
[45:13] means called out ones those that are be
[45:15] called out separated made different not
[45:20] only Old Testament the church was known
[45:21] as the kingdom of God I love that Saul
[45:27] as king and David as king and kingdom
[45:29] means king over domain that's like a
[45:31] kingdom king ruling in the domain king
[45:35] was the head the people were under him
[45:38] when it switch to the church Christ is
[45:40] the king and he is the head of the body
[45:43] the church but in the church he become
[45:46] the cap to you the pyramid come on out
[45:52] then the bride becomes his body are you
[45:59] with me so the bride is not just a bride
[46:02] the bride is not just sales people the
[46:05] bride is the body of Christ
[46:10] my my mind and that body is a mystery
[46:14] that body that we appreciate about today
[46:22] is a mystery let's continue now watch in
[46:28] the Old Testament a church was called
[46:30] the kingdom of God I'm talking from the
[46:32] chronology of the Bible Old Testament
[46:35] the church was called the kingdom of God
[46:37] in other words God is a king the
[46:39] church's domain and in the New Testament
[46:41] it is called a Masonic Empire he say
[46:45] like that
[46:46] Masonic in in other words where the
[46:49] Messiah rules and reigns no
[46:51] denominational barriers or nothing the
[46:54] Messiah rules in his Empire is not
[46:57] wonderful
[46:58] the Masonic Empire therefore the church
[47:02] here we go
[47:03] is not an organization let's go down
[47:07] deeper now the church is not a gardener
[47:11] people the church is the people of God
[47:16] that's been called out of the world to
[47:20] serve in another Kingdom Oh hallelujah
[47:28] this centrist member scattered to serve
[47:31] well in another Kingdom that's why Jesus
[47:34] said My Kingdom is not of this world if
[47:36] my kingdom was of this world my nan
[47:39] would cite for me but my kingdom is not
[47:42] of this world forget the loss of glory
[47:45] take the loss on praises people and we
[47:49] belong to that techni
[47:52] Booya hallelujah hallelujah my God my

[48:19] anyone I want to repeat that all nations
[48:31] are controlled by the devil all
[48:36] governments are ruled by the devil the
[48:40] Bible said so they fight the war and
[48:43] they will tell Jesus come as one King
[48:49] demon who inside the station fight a
[48:51] Mexican demon and the next nation and
[48:53] they fight his demons having their own
[48:55] show that has nothing to our kingdom

[51:53] heavenly spirit their spirit is no more
[51:55] Americanized it's no more germanized it
[51:58] is heavenly lized
[52:00] but I'm saying that the new word it is
[52:02] heavenly lies for the kingdom of God
[52:04] because we had another Kingdom a kingdom
[52:07] of God where decency holiness and power
[52:12] exists we have access to our King we
[52:16] have an interview with him whenever you
[52:18] want to call upon him we have no other
[52:20] intercessors no other mediator between
[52:24] the king and us but one man Christ Jesus
[52:27] so we are living in a kingdom it is
[52:30] called the Messiah kingdom in other
[52:33] words where the Messiah rules in every
[52:35] life in his Dominion ruling the lives of
[52:38] his people a call or people in every
[52:41] walk of life gather em together in a
[52:43] group that he calls it his church his
[52:46] called out ones it's a beautiful thing
[52:49] so Israel was the people of God until
[52:53] they were called the Church of God isn't
[52:56] that right and now the Church of God
[52:57] today is the same thing called out of
[52:59] everything of the world called out of a
[53:01] religious cult called out of every
[53:03] religious denomination calling of every
[53:05] religious organization to walk with God
[53:07] not being governed by a bishop but being
[53:12] gone by Christ in this Messiah kingdom
[53:15] that we live in Christ is the king now
[53:19] Christ here we go is the head of this
[53:24] so when I don't want headquarters you
[53:26] know we're talking about Nora he's he
[53:29] head in headquarters Christ is the head
[53:32] of this Christ is the head of this
[53:36] Messiah Kingdom and you cannot organize
[53:39] a kingdom of which Christ is the head I
[53:47] want to help you in on that you cannot
[53:50] organize a kingdom on which Christ is
[53:53] the head
[53:54] you cannot denominator Kingdom which
[53:57] Christ is the head because Christ is
[54:00] king and you cannot take the
[54:02] intellectuals of man and make an
[54:04] organization to which Christ will come
[54:06] on he is not a CEO he is not a CFO he is
[54:14] the king of his domain of his kingdom
[54:20] even the massage Empire
[54:26] or we shall call him king of khang oh
[54:32] [Applause]
[54:39] you are free this morning my card you're
[54:43] free this morning I feel the freedom in
[54:46] here this morning Oh glory no thought is
[54:49] a great pain to be free no change
[54:53] finding you
[54:54] nobody holding you down nobody holding
[54:58] you back we have no enemies on the
[55:00] outside no church keeping us back let's
[55:19] go huh therefore you cannot take the
[55:23] intellect of a man and make an
[55:25] organization to which Christ will govern
[55:27] therefore here we go butter brown any
[55:30] companies any people's any groups of men
[55:35] that tries to organize the kingdom of
[55:39] God is going contrary to the king if
[55:43] they're going to control you the king it
[55:45] will be against the king and if it's
[55:48] against the king it would be Antichrist
[55:51] [Music]
[55:51] [Applause]
[55:56] what about it that's pretty rough if I
[56:01] had a little more voice we would make
[56:03] that player
[56:04] it is Antichrist or Antichrist I wanna
[56:09] say it it's the same thing oh don't we
[56:12] give the Lord some praise it and if
[56:22] you'll be able to me a few minutes I
[56:23] prove it now we talk about two boots
[56:28] right one is the word I want to analyze
[56:30] spirit true organization no organization
[56:33] the spirit but a Birnam an antichrist
[56:38] spirit tries to take the people and call
[56:43] them from organization to organization
[56:47] organizing them together which never was
[56:51] the will of God now people had always
[56:53] fuss at me because I struck so hard at
[56:56] organizations it isn't the people in
[56:59] there I am striking at it's the
[57:02] dominating spirit that makes the people
[57:06] think that we are the people
[57:08] [Applause]
[57:12] the people think that but there's a
[57:19] mystery of the body of Christ that they
[57:23] miss completely because you do join that
[57:26] you are baptized into that
[57:32] so people that put you out of the
[57:34] company out of their churches out of
[57:37] their circles but they can't put you out
[57:39] of the party
[57:50] but random God's people is a caller
[57:55] people I believe they're in every
[57:59] denomination they could be Catholic they
[58:02] could be put Testament
[58:04] there could be Jewish there could be any
[58:06] kind of church
[58:07] but the real church here we go is the
[58:10] mystical body of Jesus Christ we kept
[58:20] them down into business Oh hallelujah
[58:23] upon this rock that's why we are
[58:33] standing because God has given us a rock

[1:25:08] Oh hallelujah the kingdom has nothing
[1:25:11] were only so what was God great
[1:25:19] mysterious in his mind is no put in the
[1:25:23] heart of the believer that is the body
[1:25:26] of Christ what was God once great
[1:25:29] mystery in his mind before the
[1:25:32] foundational world is know made manifest
[1:25:35] God's great mystery what has now been
[1:25:39] unfolded in Jesus Christ given down to
[1:25:43] his church what was not once in God's
[1:25:45] mine is now in the body of Christ Jesus
[1:25:49] making love to the church his bride
[1:25:52] whispering secrets to her you know how
[1:25:58] your tell your wife things you know the
[1:26:00] girl you're gonna marry you love her so
[1:26:01] much I tell her secrets she get next to
[1:26:03] you and love you and everything you know
[1:26:04] it is that's what God Christ is doing
[1:26:08] the church he is letting her know the
[1:26:10] secrets just the secrets
[1:26:12] not these flutters I mean it's wife by
[1:26:15] having the revelation of a secret memo
[1:26:17] to them by His grace how the grace of
[1:26:19] God comes to God's people and Paul said
[1:26:21] in the last days there shall be people
[1:26:24] heady highminded lovers of pleasures
[1:26:26] more than lovers of God choose breakers
[1:26:28] false accusers and continent despisers
[1:26:31] of those that are good heady highminded
[1:26:33] having a form of godliness led away by
[1:26:35] divers lust never able to come to know
[1:26:38] none of the truth these men resisted at
[1:26:40] Janet's and Jambres I was able to
[1:26:42] produce a church produce a group of
[1:26:44] people but their folly will be made
[1:26:47] manifest when Jesus take his bride and
[1:26:49] sets her up there this is her they
[1:26:52] follow shall be made known so there are
[1:26:54] those who follow you may know right at
[1:26:55] the very end my look at having the
[1:26:59] revelation of the secret made known to
[1:27:00] them His grace Oh bless had been in the
[1:27:03] Lord and now you can see the anti
[1:27:05] message why is rejected it's no
[1:27:08] denomination the revelation of his
[1:27:10] mystery no denomination look God in his
[1:27:14] body Christ Christ in his body the brain
[1:27:17] God made manifest in Christ Christ made
[1:27:21] manifest in the bride
[1:27:22] and God took from the body of Adam the
[1:27:25] woman and Christ made manifest in the
[1:27:27] brag what took on the body of Christ is
[1:27:29] flesh his body which is his word
[1:27:31] bringing a bride that won't fall by
[1:27:34] denomination no sir she's coming back

[1:27:39] beaming manifest I hope every man hears
[1:27:41] this deep and every woman she is a
[1:27:44] second Eve she's not breaking and
[1:27:46] spoiling her skirts of purity and
[1:27:47] holiness to a husband she will stay with
[1:27:50] his word listen regardless what anybody
[1:27:54] says and when the Holy Spirit told the
[1:27:56] Prophet pick up a pen and write he says

[1:36:34] your brother
[1:36:35] I have no selfish motives my motive to
[1:36:37] achieve anything personally I am only
[1:36:39] zealous for the Lord God and I see this
[1:36:43] with all my heart the very thing that
[1:36:45] you were called out of you have gone
[1:36:47] back into it again as the so good a
[1:36:49] while on a daughter dances from it the
[1:36:52] vomit made a dog sick in the first place
[1:36:54] why if organization and creeds has got
[1:36:57] the people so burned up and God has
[1:36:59] quality they're free people and your
[1:37:00] turn right back is a sin to you notice
[1:37:03] somewhat Sampson had him doing tricks to
[1:37:05] entertain them that's just about the way
[1:37:07] it is he says it got instead of the holy
[1:37:10] spirit and when someone raises up and
[1:37:12] gets arrogant the Holy Spirit is
[1:37:14] obligated to God to shut that thing up
[1:37:16] oh praise the name of the Lord
[1:37:18] they can't be original if watch is it
[1:37:22] that's the way the churches can't be let
[1:37:24] one church get something not in the city
[1:37:26] the other just can't stand it until they
[1:37:28] get it they're not original anymore God
[1:37:31] word is original it's the word it has to
[1:37:34] bring for its kind it's kind in its
[1:37:37] season how do we get into this church by
[1:37:40] one spirit we all baptized into one body
[1:37:43] oh my soul would cry hallelujah to God
[1:37:46] oh praise God him
[1:37:48] when I think that God puts in his tooth
[1:37:50] the best that he can find God takes his
[1:37:53] children and test them with acid tests
[1:37:57] then he places them into the body of
[1:38:01] Christ because they are tested come on I
[1:38:07] expect you to run that one hallelujah
[1:38:14] that's the plumb-line acid test
[1:38:19] he said they believed they went to
[1:38:21] trials they had the experience there are
[1:38:24] witnesses of his they know what they're
[1:38:25] talking about not just intellectual
[1:38:27] conception but I've been born again of
[1:38:30] the precious Holy Spirit and time tested
[1:38:33] and tried until their souls up like
[1:38:35] flint towards Calvary yes that time
[1:38:38] tested they are witness on his power or
[1:38:41] glory in the last day revelation of
[1:38:42] seven seals revelation 6 in the last day
[1:38:45] revelation we find out loudest and the
[1:38:47] last messenger during the time of his
[1:38:49] prophecy the seven seals will be open
[1:38:51] the seven mysteries the seven for
[1:38:53] mysteries we left off to every age and
[1:38:55] so forth but we are promised
[1:38:57] according to revelation 10 Malachi 4
[1:38:59] that there will come an Ephesians to
[1:39:01] this what does it means you're gonna
[1:39:03] come to one Lord one faith one baptism
[1:39:06] one body when you see that buddy you're
[1:39:10] gonna want to be after that buddy being
[1:39:13] here in the church is nothing what if
[1:39:16] the main thing is to be in the body this
[1:39:18] church here is to get that you could get
[1:39:20] the word that's something to come upon
[1:39:22] your life that you could dig a desperate
[1:39:24] as the Lord baptized my soul put me into
[1:39:27] heavenly places
[1:39:28] hallelujah let the white light pass
[1:39:30] through my bill leave a portion of
[1:39:32] yourself in me fill me with your spirit
[1:39:35] Oh glory to God amen so Ephesians is not
[1:39:39] the local church Ephesians is the bride
[1:39:42] body
[1:39:43] international
[1:39:45] Oh hallelujah the fight for ministry is
[1:39:48] not just a local church the faithful
[1:39:51] ministry is for international it's for
[1:39:54] the bride body the bride body not
[1:39:58] churches not conventions the bride body
[1:40:02] or the body of Christ focus the loss on
[1:40:06] praises people Oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:40:09] glory hallelujah amen
[1:40:13] but a Branham almost through a screen
[1:40:16] rounded but about Christ michigo reveal
[1:40:18] Christ is revealed as a little world if
[1:40:20] anybody misinterpret Jesus Christ in the
[1:40:21] Bible of not being God himself making
[1:40:24] the second person he says that this will
[1:40:26] upset every word in the entire Bible it
[1:40:30] may break the first commandment thou
[1:40:31] shalt have no other God before me he
[1:40:33] said no watch for Jesus himself is the
[1:40:38] interpretation of the Bible and he is
[1:40:42] made manifest in the age that the part
[1:40:45] of his body is being made manifest so
[1:40:49] even though he's the word we have to
[1:40:51] connect with what part of the body is
[1:40:53] being manifested because the feet and
[1:40:57] the legs and the chest was already taken
[1:41:00] up we come like the neck part and he is
[1:41:04] the head part and all the rest of the
[1:41:07] body is underground written for the
[1:41:09] voice of the resurrection even the Trump
[1:41:11] to call them from the dead but I say
[1:41:15] that the voice of the Archangel which is
[1:41:17] promised to come upon the brain which
[1:41:19] will bring on the intelligence to bring
[1:41:22] us to a place well you could see it
[1:41:24] because you have to see it before you
[1:41:26] process it
[1:41:28] come on say him and somebody you have to
[1:41:32] see it before your possess it in other
[1:41:41] words you may be seated
[1:41:44] they didn't have the full seat all along
[1:41:46] and your Carberry part seed so Luther
[1:41:49] had part
[1:41:50] Wesley had part all them fellas had part
[1:41:53] but a Branham came to gather all the
[1:41:55] parts to present a whole seed which is
[1:41:59] the word so by the time he came on the
[1:42:01] scene son of man ready to unveil himself
[1:42:04] and the son of man is his saw of the
[1:42:06] seed but the seven errors committed come
[1:42:08] from eternity the God of all is
[1:42:10] scattered with all the loose ends and
[1:42:13] tied back into the world to bring down
[1:42:16] the Holy Ghost
[1:42:17] but the Holy Ghost couldn't come on as
[1:42:19] Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost Pomona's
[1:42:20] promises and Peter said by these
[1:42:23] promises we become partakers of the
[1:42:26] divine nature having escaped the
[1:42:29] corruption that is in the world you lost
[1:42:32] so for the escape once we have these
[1:42:35] virtues to fight for the content for the
[1:42:39] press for hallelujah
[1:42:42] by one Spirit we are baptized into that
[1:42:45] promoter
[1:42:47] [Applause]
[1:42:49] oh my I'm gonna fetch mrs. Khan please
[1:43:00] you don't receive the Holy Ghost to
[1:43:02] become seed but a Branham because you
[1:43:06] are seed so listen eNOS it struck my
[1:43:20] soul about the body the body of Christ
[1:43:23] people could put y'all to their company
[1:43:25] or the churches they could take your
[1:43:28] tips or to their churches they could
[1:43:30] take your messages all to the library
[1:43:31] that's fine
[1:43:32] anybody could do whatever they want to
[1:43:34] do that's no problem nothing against
[1:43:36] that but they kind of take you out of
[1:43:39] the body of Christ and one person in the
[1:43:42] body can fight an exhibition in the body
[1:43:44] one ought to be in the body and next one
[1:43:46] alter the body elect don't persecute
[1:43:50] elect that is an impossibility my finger
[1:43:55] a factor in my foot and I know that I
[1:43:58] will my mouth
[1:43:59] my nose is there to smell my mouth is
[1:44:01] yet to speak my ass is data here and my
[1:44:04] eyes are still seeing I won't say my
