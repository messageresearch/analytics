us to redeem us to restore us father me of healing virtue flew here tonight not just for a physical healing but spiritual healing healing to homes and hearts healing to families bless your service tonight and may you be magnified and be glorified in all what we do one say we ask in jesus name amen god bless you for the bible as i get it to interest in john chapter 20 and revelation chapter two two portion of scripture reader tonight greet you in jesus name welcome hallelujah amen so good to be here tonight we also so welcome to all those who are connected to us while we have the internet we say welcome to this evening service o praise the name of the lord reading from saint john chapter 20. i want to read from verse 19 to 22 and revelation 2 we just read two verses one and two reading from saint john chapter 20 verse 19. then the same day at evening being the first of the week when the doors were shut with the disciples where the disciples were assembled for fear of the jews came jesus stood in the midst and said unto them peace be on to you when he had so said he showed unto them his hands and his side then were the disciples glad when they saw the lord then said jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father had sent me even so send are you and when he had said this he breathed on them and see it unto them receive receiving the holy ghost and from revelation chapter 2 unto the angel of the church of ephesus right be staying saith he that whole let the seven stars in his right hand who walk it in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks i know thy works and i labor and i patience and how though cancer bear them which are evil and i was try them which say they apostles and are not and has found them liars may god bless the reader of his word you may be seated who prays the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord tonight for a title i have received the holy ghost the dynamics the spirit i have an inspiration word revealed will of god word reveal will of god so the title is received in the holy ghost the dynamics the spirit let me give you john's prophecy from matthew chapter 3 verse 11 to 12 this is john i indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he had cometh after me is mightier than i whose shoes i am not worthy to bear he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire amen fan is in his hand he will thoroughly purge his floor and guard his wheat into the ghana but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire that was john's prophecy so john prophesied that fire was coming john prophesied a power was coming it is still you shall receive power it is still the spirit promised it is still dynamics to your mechanics isn't that right but a brand name there it's he said we must first find the will of god before you can do the will of god you must first know what his will is in the matter then don't turn it loose like the lady said she's trying to get beyond that song barrier then the plane just picks up speed and goes unlimited and when you can pray until you have passed the doubt barrier then you are running free you can go on nothing can bother you then because you are running free you are past the unbelief it has been settled it's all over isn't that right so for instance if i had a loaf i want a loaf of bread i'm starving a loaf of bread would save my life and i would ask for the bread and some man will give me a 25 cents that's the purchase price of a loaf of bread i can just be as happy as holding the 25 cents in my hand as i can with the loaf of bread because it's the purchasing power notice i haven't got the bread i haven't but i've got the purchasing power which is the faith so deep faith restored back give you the purchasing power for what god promised you hallelujah notice these disciples they didn't have the holy ghost here but they needed to be comforted and jesus said peace be unto you i will stop your worry stop your complaint stop your fuss hush your first peace be unto you as my father sent me so send are you jesus drop a promise on them and he wasn't ready for it yet but he knew that belongs to them he knew that the father that was in him was going to be in them he knew they would receive a promise oh hallelujah hallelujah he was so sure that they was going to be filled he said as my father sent me so sent are you and the father that sent him was in him he was telling him the spirit power that no resides in me going to be in you peace be unto you stop your worry stop wondering if you're going to get the holy ghost receiving the holy ghost and he breathing on them oh hallelujah the breath of god came over there oh give the lord some praises people oh hallelujah oh hallelujah they didn't have it yet but they had the 25 cents they didn't have the bread here but they had the 25 cents oh do you love him so when you pray until you get the assurance you can be just as happy as if the cancer is gone shout just as loud because they got the purchasing power the fate that moves the thing then you are perseverant no one can tell anything different it doesn't matter you're crossing some barrier oh hallelujah praise the name of the lord do you believe that you know the bible in thessalonians 5 21 prove all things hold fast that which is good and when anything is proven it will be proven right or wrong and when there's anything in question it should be proven until you find out what is right and as you find what is right it said hold fast in other words grip it don't turn it loose hold fast none of us hold it tight hold fast at that which is good after it has been proven right and anything that's proven not right to the loose as quick as you can get away from it don't never hold on to the wrong thing now it is possible that staunch christians find people hold sometimes to the wrong thing thinking it is right but then these things should be proven whether they are right or wrong and it's the duty of all of us as we are expecting to go to heaven when jesus come it's the minister's duty when a question is brought up that he sells this out and then proves it before the people that they might understand because no one wants to be found wrong holding the wrong thing now we have a scripture and jesus said all scriptures must be fulfilled then we should prove all things and hold fast hold it tight with a dead grip all faster that vision is good i remember in school i learned something many of you learn the same lesson when you have solve a problem work it out you can take the answer and prove it by the problem in other words two plus three is five and you could you know you could flip it back and forth but all will be five four and one is five isn't that right you could always get a confirmation that you have the correct answer say how many ever did that all of you of course then you don't have to worry whether your answer is right or not the problem answer has been proven by the problem the answer has been proven by the problem therefore you got it right so if every one of you on your slate or sheet has been proven the answer proved by the problem then you got it no one can say you're wrong and if you do your work neatly and correctly and the way it should be done your answer has been proved you can sit back and rest with the assurance that you're going to get an a on that on that sheet of paper that you turn in because it has been proven by the problem you can flip it anywhere so it can't just be one scripture it had to be lined up online here little dear level it must be able to run from genesis to the book of revelation isn't that right so god in every age fulfill and prove the work that he settled for that age and every time that god word has been proven in the age the majority has turned it down you can only have faith here we go as god give you faith faith is a gift of god whatever how religious you may be it must be have faith and your faith can only rest on watch if you're a christian upon the proven word of god so your faith can't just rest on words it has to rest on proven words hallelujah you fake i rest on a dream or somebody tell you it's got to be what god said it got to be the revealed word the word that god has unveiled or unfolded we believe that so from the voice of god he said there are so many voices on the earth today it's absolutely a hard thing because it's dead in the voice of the supernatural there are so many intellectual voices great voices of mighty men who are intellectual and in the intellectual condition even shake nations they are not just overnight people but they shake nations bringing great organization together florally and a person would be confused how these things could go on and prosper and their voices that raise up and do these things and it causes the voice of god to be placed way back somewhere the true voice of god now here we go and the voice of god they say how will we know it's the voice of god because for today it wasn't a vindicated prophet now today how do we know it's the voice of god because it's it's the manifestation of the prophet's word that is how you will know it is god's voice in other words we have to come to the spot where we can say this is that that the prophet william branham speak of then we enrique said this is that that will be a manifestation of the prophet's word my word don't count but the prophet will does god said i am he that hold it the seven stars in my right hand oh give the lord some praise as people so god himself was holding these messengers in his right hand his voice was speaking through them oh praise the name of the lord do you believe that hallelujah so but abraham said and the true voice of god only brings back that real living supernatural god with a supernatural word with the supernatural manifestation of the true word he said there's so much of the other realm but that that almost deadened that but it will listen it will come forth oh praise god say their voices go into the land praise god since buddha branham left the scene all kind of interpretation and so on has gone to the land isn't that right but god promised that they'll come a real supernatural voice of god which will be a manifestation of the prophet's word you mean the voice of god is god himself yes the bride will be given a voice so in revelation chapter four he said the voice of the throne before the truth was seven stars the voice of the stars not one voice voices what was it god speaking to the church oh hallelujah so god voice god have to speak to the church oh do we believe that the voice of the seven ages the voices speaking with thunder and lightning nowhere these days they still want to say hell in the pulpit he said we need men of god men who want all back now everybody can't be a preacher but you got a voice hallelujah hallelujah everybody can be a preacher but you got a voice and if you can't preach the people of sermon if you're a preacher you're called to the pulpit to preach if you are not you are still a preacher so everybody in here preachers he said no watch you're still a preacher but leave the people a sermon let your sermon be live and it's the voice of god what's that a live sermon or give the lord some praises not a preached sermon but a live sermon is the voice of god oh let's give the lord a shout to pray oh hallelujah hallelujah say it again how do we know is the voice of god it will be a manifestation of the prophet's word and the prophet said unleash him that's the voice of god you cannot stop any voice that's the thunder oh they're gonna shake that devil you cannot stop a life a life hits alive ponders a life cannot be defeated with the pork concrete the plant gonna still spring up or out of your belly shuffle rivers have lived in water life is gonna come light is gonna come you're gonna come forth oh hallelujah let your sermon be lived and it's the voice of god that will bring reproach to them and reject it wow you mean your life could be rejected that's right and we're not talking about words now we're talking about their life watch they will say yeah the testimony they know people testimonial there's not they will write they will fax they will email no what the people will say is no one can put a finger on his or her life they are sweet let me have that honey they are sweet living if ever there was a man of god is that man or woman leave your salmon don't try to preach it if you're not called to be a preacher you may get all mixed up and mess up and you'll get the people tangled up you'll ruin them and yourself also just live your sermon the preacher is called the preachers and delivered to if you can't live it then stop preaching it now when we come back to the word distance if we're coming back to the bible distance can't live it stop preaching it because the life is more important than the gift of teaching or preaching let me say it again because the life is more important than the gift of teaching or preaching oh hallelujah praise god all right all we need in jesterville thousands of live voices the thunder of god turning out in sweetness holiness purity undefined lives oh you don't hear about these things no more yeah about teaching doctrines hidden mysteries revelations all kind of stuff but this you don't hear about that no more

and open the eyes of the blind heal the sick we need david untrained in theological schools we need a man who knows nothing a little plowboy some little guy with stupid shoulders come walking down the road with the power of god not with more mystery than more teaching no we had ever 40 plus years we need somebody to step out by faith with genuine power holy ghost power virtue power permanent power greatness and power and you want to see it for yourself [Applause] [Music] i'm continuing here in the army when the nations first provided the helmet little rookie didn't want to wear it it seemed unnecessary but when he got in the battle he needed it god don't provide anything less you have need of it a little rookie with a 90-pound pack on his back training that's right he got a new suit on you know he don't see any necessary packing that 90 pound pack in the back with picks and shovels and hand grenades everything else but let him get in the battle once time will come you must you must have it that is why here we go the oral wise god equipped his army with the baptism of the holy ghost he knowed these elect intellectual giants would stand in this last day he know they would stand and they would be able to explain by their great wisdom cause of satan peter said like a roman lion but i am not going to leave you comfortless i'm going to come to you he equipped his army with the baptism of the holy ghost luke 24 49 behold i send the promise of my father upon you bacteria in the city of jerusalem until you be endued with power from one hand and after death the holy ghost is to come upon you then you shall be witnesses unto me in jerusalem acts 1 8 plum to the uttermost part of the earth this is what you come to church for this is why you are here tonight not just to say amen but to receive power to receive receiving the holy ghost receive either spirit receive the dynamics i didn't promise it god promised it to you [Applause] oh hallelujah but abraham god knowed what his army needed and that's the reason he equipped them with the holy ghost he knew he had they have to have them he knowed to be effective witness here we go to be an effective witness of his resurrection they would have to have the holy ghost mark 16 in other words demonstrate the power when last have you heard that the gospel is not just word only the gospel is to demonstrate the power so we are yet to see the gospel preached because when the gospel begins to be preached its mechanics and dynamics together that's why jesus told disciples as my father sell me so send are you oh blessed be the name of the lord in other words watch this you have no three year course to go in the university to get the gospel notice what i'm the peter he denied christ so he had no depression and frustration isn't that right he was feeling a bad disciple you're talking about disciple how you're feeling or not everybody know you the antichrist he's not feeling good about himself hallelujah all i'm afraid isn't that right they're in the upper room and they shut the doors no air condition but the door shut because them fellas nervous and they are frightened but they know god speed upon them receiving the holy ghost they know they're under the breath of god jesus did them that to set them up under expectation for a manifestation you have to get set up for it you have to know the breath of god is upon your life you have to know that you were born for wreck you were raised up for it you are called for it you are predestinated to it oh give the lord some praise as people jesus all glory hallelujah hallelujah jesus never telling them today he never tell them the hour he said wait until until until he set them up until because it's coming it's on its way you're going to receive it god promised it i spoke it receiving the holy ghost and if god said it my word shall not return unto me foil oh give the lord some praise as people god can't lie [Applause] [Music] demonstrate the power of the holies that's what gonna come down to demonstrate the power of the holy ghost satan know the true church have happened mark 16 manifesting in it the true church going to have signs wonders and miracles the true church gonna have the no excuses the true church gonna have a living christ him moving in and out oh glory hallelujah or praising the lord glory hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise the lord former resume of the ages speaking churches book brother branham you'll see that he ready make reference to the scripture we read version 2 1. listen carefully notice revelation 2 1 describe the lord jesus as in the midst of his church holding the messengers in his right hand because his bride has fallen because the church corporate is now a mixture of true and false he does not leave it it is his that's beautiful he knows that true and false but he does not abandon the church i am he that walk in the midst of the seven golden slams so i miss true and false he's still walking i miss true and fault he's still there now watch for none of us live unto himself but diet or diet himself whether believer we live unto the lord whether we die we die unto the lord whether we live there for or die we are the lords for to this end christ both died rose and revived that he might be the lord both of the dead and the living on the cross here we go he bought the whole world of people they are heroes he is the lord of the living and the dead as pertaining to ownership not relationship hallelujah in other words the whole world is in his hands he owns everyone isn't that right he walk in the midst of that body and has been in it life and death what was planted in the first age will develop in the second age and all the ages until it come to maturity and harvest thus in the smelling age we expect an enlargement and enlightenment of the church corporate history through a revelation of the spirit in this age the hatred of the false vine increases they have separated themselves from the company of the true they went out from them they were liars they call themselves what they are not but god did god destroy them no let them alone both will go to the harvest but lord they shall be destroyed for they are destroying thy people they are killing them no let them alone but to my bride i say be thou faithful unto death love me even more oh are you with me tonight we learn in no uncertain terms that the false vine is the vine of satan their gathering is of him satan they meet in the name of god and lie that they are christ they preach they teach they baptize they worship they partake of various rights given by christ to the church yet they are not of god but since they say they are god will hold them responsible and in each age he speaks of them and to them amen oh hallelujah they remind us of balaam he had a prophetic office he knew the proper approach unto god as demonstrated by the sacrifice of clean beasts yet here we go he was not a true word prophet he was a prophet but not a word prophet oh let's go down now for when god told him not to go and honor balak with his presence he sought to go anyway for he was motivated by his lust for goal and prestige so god let him go the perfect will of god give way to the permissive will of god because of the heart's desire so that is why you have to come to the revealed word will of god your heart desires out of it because i'm going to mess you up because when dalam asked god god said don't go but he wanted to go he gone and asked god to see the lord what you always say second time what she go perfect will turn to permissive will and bilaam could tell anybody god told me to go i have a testimony god spoke to me and just said that god spoke of them and to them yes hallelujah scary isn't it watch this the perfect will of god give way to the permissible of god because of the heart's desire of belong god actually said go ahead did god change his mind no sir god had his way regardless of balaam going balaam did not annul the will of god god had his way regardless it was balaam who was the loser for he bypassed the word and any time somebody bypassed the word that's a loser isn't that right because god cannot bless error or bless anything that bypasses the word isn't that right today we have the very same thing woman preachers organizations false doctrine people worshiping god manifesting in the spirit going right on as the day lamb claiming that god has spoken to them even when the commission receives opposite to the revealed word and i will not deny that god spoke to them but it was just like when he spoke to bill and that second time as he knew that balaam wanted his own heart desire above the word and he gave it to him yet all the while in the end having his own way even so today and this is taught from even so today god will tell folks to go ahead in their own hearts desires but they have already rejected the word but the will of god will be done regardless i hope you see this and listen to this caution it will not only clear up much of what is seen in all ages but it will especially help in this last age which has so much manifestation and external blessings when the whole period is so against the word reveal will of god amen that's where i get it from when the whole period is so against the word revealed will of god that is why you have to be in the word for god's will to be revealed to you there should have known jesus was the messiah jesus told them moses spoke of me these people were reading scripture every sabbath table when the manifestation come they rejected it amen because they had their own thoughts of how the messiah was going to come and god is his own interpreter you can tell god don't bless this one bless this one don't bless this one he want to bless who he wants to bless hallelujah i feel god want to bless someone here tonight [Applause] so now to be an effective witness of god you have to have the holy ghost because without the holy ghost you can't make it live isn't that right praise the name of the lord so therefore jesus breathed upon them received holy ghost why to put them on the expectation listeners questions and answers brother branham dear brother branham what is the difference when jesus breathed on the disciples and said receiver the holy ghost and when they had to go to the upper room to tarry and sell it was a promise he gave them he breathed upon them his promise he said receive the holy ghost it was a promise they went to the upper room to wait for the promise to be fulfilled the same thing is when we lay hands upon you to be healed then you go about your business waiting for the promise to be fulfilled that's all like wait till them seven thunders utter the voices of that group we have to wait until the promise be fulfilled then like peter we come out of all day says that that the prophet william random speaker it's now fulfilled it's history are you with me oh glory to god amen i love you lord hallelujah praise the lord from conferences brother branham and get so many conference was the only one that could die he company all then when the great time come he had to make a final decision no doubt the father said are you still ready to go through it with it my son remember jesus was saying if it's possible let's go pass so the father is talking
