to the Book of Isaiah amen praise God just share a word tonight and leaning on the Holy Spirit now Isaiah chapter six kinda have to context here but when we see what the Lord will do tonight but Isaiah 6 and then I'll go over to see a book of st. John afterwards in the New Testament but from Isaiah 6 I want to read from Busan one familiar script yeah but it says in a year that King Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple above it stood the Seraphim each one had six wings with twain he covered his face and with twain he covered his feet and his Twain he did fly a man and one cried unto another and said holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the posts of the door moved are the voice of him that cried and a house was filled with smoke then said I whoa is me for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts a man the real king amen then flew one of the seraphim's unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said lo this had touched my lips and thine iniquity is taken away and I seen his purge also I heard a voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and who will go for us then said I here am I send me and he said go and tell his people a man well he said go and tell his people here indeed but understand not and see indeed but receive not a man now let's turn over to book of st. John amen chapter 14 and I read from 16 also see in John 14 and reading from verse 15 just to touch on something here 14 st. John 14 and verse 15 it says if you love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father and he will give you another comforter and he may abide with you forever even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seemed is cioth him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you a man I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye shall see me because I live you shall live also that day you shall know and I am in my father and en me and I am you he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him amen now skip on on to chapter 16 lastly and now we want to pick up who's 12 a man just 12 and 13 so you may have seen John 16 verse 12 it says I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now howbeit when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come may go on our blessing - ring of his ruin him and his bow heads one more time father me Lord we've just read your word Lord and we Lord we know that no man could put it to petition to this scripture father Lord your spirit 'take the vinery v lord father lord is what we want to hear tonight so father we pray now that you bless the word Lord father and Lord as we endeavor for a few minutes to preach Lord and the Lord Fellowship around your woody prayer presence come now Lord on anointing scriptures tonight father to our hearts Lord we pray and ask it in Jesus name Amen an email praise go and you have a seat amen 11:00 tonight amen hallelujah praise the Lord Amen well it's good to be in a hospital Lord tonight a many man praise God Amen I have a title and my title is the Spirit of Truth man also I have a subject my subject is the voice of God amen and amen and amen glory to God you loved him tonight a many man well it's good to be in a house of God tonight the man were here to receive faith from God faith come by hearing the word hearing the Word of God that's what the prophets said amen not by hearing a voice of man or the voice of politics or the voice of this Bible prophet said there's so many voices in the world today but what we need tonight is to hear the voice of God amen because if the voice of God speak to us something different will take place something different will happen a lot of people not hearing the voice of God but they haven't other voices other influences other things happening around us and there's so much of it now there's so much of influences now and there's so much of turmoil that is very easily or very easy to get destructive isn't it right very easy to get pulled away so much happening in politics over the world today and with Trump and the president he says this and he does that and goes back on this treaty and and these things and all these things are perplexed cities great distress of nations of Bible says Amen and these things are not strange to us but yet we're in the midst of it where we're not off the world but where in the world a man is now right and there's challenges there's things that we have to face a man but what I feel a world wants to speak to us tonight that there's a spirit of truth that Jesus keep talking about now this spirit of truth and he said that yet a little while the world will see me no long and that's that speaks of a condition a condition that Jesus standing in that present that time there in the past but he was looking way down off into the future where we are and he was actually seeing a time where the world was no longer going to see Jesus are you understanding what I'm saying tonight we're talking about our condition the world were coming to where they were no longer see God where they're gonna no longer hear from God where people would no longer be influenced by positive and by the Spirit of God the Spirit of Truth and the spirit of honesty and uprightness and and holiness and purity and righteousness it's almost stripped almost away from the denominations and we look at how the condition of the world is going today even the religious realm even the political realm on whatever you look at it it there's a slow and steady decay and there's a slow and steady decline email is there a darkness coming upon the face of the earth cross darkness comment upon the people or court promised yet a little while even the will will see me no no but you are going to see me Oh Halle that gives me a choice that autumn put a smile upon her face tonight to know that there's a solid promise from car tonight that there's a people in the land that we have people in Canada there may be a people all on the road in France and Europe and Africa wherever they will hear a voice of call the Prophet said once more this way will hear pilot from car hallelujah just like they're tearing that from the days of the Apostles when Peter came out of the upper room who do you think was speaking when he slammed open the door all the time they were afraid all the time they were perplexed here it was Jesus are gone from them but he given him a promise but they were too afraid to go out in the street and so on he said teri in Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high these were wanted men a man because Holland is now right Jesus was gone from them and hallelujah they prophesied to be part of a rebel group and there they were hiding hiding away up in the upper noon waiting what are we waiting for waiting on the power of God God brought a situation where they couldn't do anything in their own strength the people was against them the Sadducees us against them please go to Iran in Holland is 9 but here come now the Spirit of God the pillar of fire and anointing a presence come upon them I went that took place when that happened he just slammed open the door said these people are not drunk as you suppose but this is Sat but the prophets broke off in that day that I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh and that's what we are looking for tonight we need the Spirit of God the spirit of truth to guide us into all truth that's prayer will not to tell you to error no no no no that spirit will not lie to you because I swear I could only say what the world says and you know it's a spirit of truth when it says Amen to this world Oh hallelujah hallelujah the spirit of true tonight will tell you that there's going to be a revival this world of true tonight will tell you that you're going to be here you're going to be delivered you're going to be restored your family is coming that is the Spirit of Truth Oh hallelujah it will say Amen to the wear every single time hallelujah we believe it now we see and it's coming on now and we feel as present almost and there's a famine in our land not for books and tapes but for the hearing of the true Word of God being preached is now right being exalted a man is now we thank God for ministry God has put here among us to stay with the word to stay with what God said by fate that's what we are doing tonight we are earnestly contending for the faith we are not giving up this is not a time for giving up this is not a time for letting go Valhalla but this is a time for holding on now is our salvation nearer than when we first believed like this moment we are met closer to the Holy Ghost right tonight we are closer to always higher on tonight we are closer to see a missing limbs being restored or it doesn't feel like it but tonight we are one day closer we are one step closer we are one second closer to seeing our family delaila to see in our husbands delivered to see our wives deliver to see our children a lever to see all places being may well Oh hallelujah he said of my people can humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then they're gonna hear from heaven that's what we want to match we don't want to hear from man we want to hear from heaven tonight we want to hear a voice of God in the last days to speak to us halleluyah halleluyah the face of God is always positive it always speaks positive it never speaks negative it never pulls you down it's always bad to pull you up pull you up from where you are and to really deserve to be God like on his believe in children as on two egos not Shemp or even help us in tonight's not little birds but on two Eagles Eagles have the ability to soar into the heavenlies Eagles are built a certain way to take the pressure of the uncommon strong they got what it takes and tonight these Christians that pod call in the last days usually call usually for new he call and really justified and we already clarified tonight you have what it takes to face the devil wherever you are tonight or somebody say man amen you've got what it takes or harder to pray more to seek the Lord more to go further the way to go harder until we get past the sump area and then nothing gonna hold us back oh I know this philosopher know weariness the hail of smack most people hold us back hallelujah praise amen amen am i shocked hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that's what we're meant for meant to saw meant to fly but the bottom said he'd one time thing he went to a zoo I know a place or whatever that had a bird there we go and it was caged up isn't that right he was looking at it and he said a big bird caught up and he mounted up and he ran to us up he was beating himself against the cage war just tried to get out prophet said he said that bird wasn't meant to be like that it's all right people might have been there taking pictures and looking at up close maybe it's something it won't be able to see up close like that because they're always so far up on highway but here was one captured in a cave got caged a man and he couldn't get out the Prophet said it was he wasn't meant to be caged up like that that bird was meant to saw that bird was meant to fly and sometimes that's how we get when the enemy ties us up and gotten all tied up in all kind of cares of life and things of the world and sometimes legitimate things creep over creeping things and begin to creep into a prayer life and creep into our family life and creep into what we are a man what we ought to be in Christ it's also crippled or slowly and we may not notice it at first but slowly the enemy playing tricks and the enemy doing things to try to manipulate and try to to deconstruct and try to destroy our Christian walk a man but tonight by the Spirit of God amen we're here to cut them loose tonight I'll let you go I'll let you know that you ought not to be caged up like that but you are an eagle tonight you are born to soar into the heavenlies to scream out I catch the wind or holla fearless oh how the eye of a magnet prays calling or a magnifying glass a man you could see far off into the distance you could see your promises hollow you could see your prey down the road that's who you are tonight that's what God wants us to be tonight and the enemy's job is to try to confuse us to try to bind us to things to try to bind us to temporal things and they're legitimate things sometimes it's work-related sometimes it's whatever you know you have your plans and so on but yet the Prophet said plan for the next 20 years but live like he's coming tomorrow we got to live every moment like he's coming to know because you don't know the hour or the moment when he's going to come that's why you've got to be ready but when the pod cream comes it's all I'm trimmin bear Oh hallelujah holiday when the bridegroom comes wanna make sure your ropes all right make sure you are ready to go out and meet him make sure you've got the extra oil you've got what is required you've got what is necessary so go out and meet him and the midnight cry we're gonna go out one of these days this was no longer all the bills all the things that they will no longer be able to hold us all of the things that we find so hard cause it's going to a work of transformation in your life in your hearts in your walk in your talk until you come just like Jesus until you get more like Jesus less like the real and what is taking place is actually taking place inside of your soul you've got it right here where is the revival preacher the revival is in me viola when the people are gonna get a revelation that you gotta bring the revival and if you pray if you call on God if you really want to hear from God you have the ability as the Bride of Christ to pull from the pillar of fire and get whatever you need if you need Shh pull from the pillar of fire tonight if you need healing point from the pillow I pull it off from the preacher pull it off from him say I need it I won't judge I got to have it be gonna pull pull pull hallelujah hallelujah that's how it was the prophet's ministry we saw it he's standing on a platform and he's there ministering to somebody it's not nice he say you know people come up in a line they might be full of faith coming up but then as he got closer to him if he's kind of died down they kind of get in the natural or moons waiting in line to come to meet a prophet and then he has to go minister to them and tell him your name is so and so and so forth but then while that's taking place there may be someone in the audience there who's got a knee sometime they don't even have a prayer card but their faith it's going past a strong barrier their faith is growing program where faith is growing pass the prayer card and the prayer line and what man shut up your faith is growing you're nuts their faith is bucking on heaven's door Lord Jesus remember my son remember my wife whoever whatever diabetes high blood pressure or all kind of needs out in the audience but I plan on will be there ministering on all this had to be pulled here he said I like just went over this way then he pours weed is he waited like a Zeppelin but you see that brother over there he's praying for this stand up where you see the healing the Holy Ghost is right next to you pray scroll what do you think is happening people stage was pulling for the pillar fire pulling for their needs pulling for what they wanted tonight you can pull from the pillar

fall for the devil's lie not to fall for the devil's on mistakes not to fall for the brothers tricks but to be strong in the Lord and in the power that might put on the whole armor of God tonight that
