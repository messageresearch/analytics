[17:01] 22
[17:03] and mark 16 verse 14 to 20.
[17:16] matthew 3 verse 16.
[17:29] and jesus when he was baptized went up
[17:32] straight way out of the water
[17:34] although the heavens were open upon him
[17:37] and he saw the spirit of god
[17:39] be sounding like a dove lighting upon
[17:42] him
[17:43] and lure a voice from heaven saying this
[17:45] is my beloved son
[17:47] in whom i am well pleased or pleased to
[17:50] dwell
[17:51] in it's in john chapter 20
[17:54] read verse 21 and 22.
[18:03] and then then said jesus to them
[18:08] peace be unto you as my father had sent
[18:12] me
[18:13] even so send are you when he had said
[18:16] this
[18:17] he breathed on them and says unto them
[18:21] receive thee the holy ghost
[18:25] last scriptures are mark
[18:31] on reading from mark chapter 16
[18:35] and you want to read from verse 14.
[18:39] afterward he appeared at 11 as they sat
[18:42] at meat
[18:43] and operated or rebuked them with their
[18:46] unbelief and hardness of heart
[18:49] because they believed not them which had
[18:51] seen him
[18:53] after he was risen and he said unto them
[18:56] go into all the world and preach the
[18:59] gospel to every creature
[19:02] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[19:04] be saved
[19:05] he that believeth not shall be damned
[19:08] and these signs shall follow them that
[19:11] believe
[19:12] in my name they shall cast out devils
[19:15] they shall speak with new tongues they
[19:18] shall take up serpents and if they drink
[19:20] any deadly thing it shall not hurt them
[19:24] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[19:26] they shall recover
[19:28] so then after the lord had spoken unto
[19:30] them he was received up into him
[19:32] and sat on the right hand of god and
[19:35] they
[19:35] went forth and preached everywhere
[19:39] the lord working with them and
[19:42] confirming the word
[19:43] with signs following amen let's bow our
[19:45] heads
[19:46] forward i pray father we thank you for
[19:48] your presence
[19:50] and your power that we feel is among us
[19:52] right now
[19:53] and you promise where the twos and trees
[19:54] are gathered together you'll be
[19:56] nominated
[19:57] god you know the needs of their people
[19:59] minister to their needs and
[20:00] help them help us the bride bodies the
[20:03] sickest body on earth
[20:04] we pray virtue will go out of families
[20:07] to marriages
[20:08] to homes to the children to each
[20:11] represented here those that are
[20:14] connected to us and the internet may
[20:16] have blessed them also
[20:17] and may the spirit be released upon
[20:19] their lives in jesus name we ask it
[20:22] amen and amen you may be seated praise
[20:24] god
[20:31] i have a title this morning anointed
[20:35] with god hallelujah i have a subject
[20:39] fully surrendered to god
[20:42] i have an inspiration ambassadors
[20:46] of the throne amen
[20:49] ambassadors of the throne
[20:54] an individual christian note my words
[20:58] christian not jewish member christian
[21:02] represent the kingdom of god
[21:06] amen you
[21:09] listen carefully as a christian amen
[21:13] represent god's kingdom amen
[21:17] amen amen hallelujah
[21:22] not your family
[21:25] not your kind
[21:27] [Music]
[21:29] the kingdom because what jesus come to
[21:32] preach was the kingdom
[21:34] amen he never tried to establish a
[21:36] church jesus church and
[21:38] oh no no he come to establish a kingdom
[21:41] he told him my kingdom is not of this
[21:43] world
[21:45] if my kingdom was of this world my men
[21:47] would fight for me
[21:50] hallelujah so he he was trying to bring
[21:52] them to a higher kingdom
[21:54] to a higher life to a higher thinking
[21:57] altogether
[21:58] he said i've heard an old past eiffel
[22:00] iron truth for tooth but i
[22:02] say unto you don't go down to that
[22:05] barbarian level
[22:07] don't go down to that i do and you let
[22:10] your nature be loosed
[22:11] i want to take it to another level
[22:13] because that nature is a higher one
[22:16] hallelujah that life is a higher life
[22:19] the law is for the lawless but i call
[22:20] you to hire
[22:21] by the power of grace to release you to
[22:24] get back to where you were before
[22:26] which is back to eden which is back to
[22:28] your sonship
[22:29] which is back to your culture which is
[22:31] back to your inheritance
[22:35] so the mind is a gateway to the soul
[22:38] that's why before you
[22:40] you do something it has to come true to
[22:41] your mind
[22:43] and by time it kept your heart you're
[22:44] caught because it's what somebody
[22:47] have in their heart their mouth could go
[22:49] this way but it's what they have in
[22:50] their heart
[22:52] so he said your mind open up the door or
[22:54] closes the door
[22:56] and listens to your conscience listens
[22:59] to your memory
[23:00] listens to your affection so if your
[23:02] mind could shut down that
[23:04] you could say i don't you know if you
[23:06] don't feel the praise god this morning
[23:08] you shut that down
[23:09] so you don't even bother with your
[23:10] feelings you raise your hands and he
[23:12] hung up
[23:13] [Applause]
[23:14] you're feeling so good you're feeling
[23:16] sick you reject that
[23:18] and you put your feeling in one side you
[23:20] put your
[23:32] upside down he don't know what to think
[23:34] about you afterwards that can't handle
[23:37] you
[23:38] you see you want to come like moses when
[23:40] when when moses was finished with
[23:42] pharaoh
[23:42] moses pharaoh said take your flocks take
[23:45] your people take
[23:46] all take it and go

[24:12] prepared to confront
[24:16] let me say it again you can't defeat
[24:19] what you're not to prepare to confront
[24:22] you have to confront yourself
[24:24] look in the mirror and deal with you
[24:26] deal with your anger your temper your
[24:28] attitude your hastiness
[24:30] your impatience you lost deal with it

[24:50] going to put your foot on the devil's
[24:52] neck you're going to put your foot in
[24:54] those shallowest times

[25:01] for that

[25:35] so the battle rage since the garden of
[25:37] eden
[25:39] in the human mind is not even your
[25:41] battle
[25:42] because this battle started in heaven

[25:51] and there was war and there was one in
[25:54] heaven michael fought in a dragon fort
[25:57] battling heaven you know and then they
[26:00] kicked them demons out and it fell on

[26:49] amen
[26:53] all right and the background that was

[33:14] that they want to do that because the
[33:15] lord

[33:17] said the lord is at my
[33:19] right hand i shall not be moved oh

[33:27] the amount of two or three witnesses
[33:29] let everything be established so you
[33:31] can't just take a evil report about
[33:33] someone
[33:34] and there's no evidence or witnesses
[33:36] you'll be receiving an evil report
[33:38] isn't that right that's why if somebody
[33:40] offend you or something
[33:41] don't go and tell somebody go to that
[33:42] person suppose you're misinterpreting
[33:45] them
[33:45] like i give a reference one time you can
[33:47] see somebody come on that bar with some
[33:49] water
[33:50] or something some bottle a next minute
[33:52] report come he wasn't about drinking you
[33:54] didn't see him drinking
[33:55] that's right man that's right but
[33:57] there's a report
[33:58] but he put some car may have broken down
[34:00] and when they got some water upon the
[34:01] radiator
[34:03] but because it was seen that way and
[34:05] instead of verifying information
[34:07] somebody run with that
[34:08] and next minute he was drinking he was
[34:09] drinking a sim card
[34:11] that's assumption that's come saying
[34:13] like everything in the garage is a car
[34:15] but supposed to learn more
[34:20] there are four wheels it was in the
[34:22] garage
[34:25] that don't mean it's a car so you can't
[34:28] just
[34:28] take things like that you have to have a
[34:32] love for truth
[34:39] i want to say it again you have to have
[34:40] a love for truth
[34:43] not gossip not back now
[34:47] not just talk for truth because the
[34:50] truth is what sets people free
[34:58] but i can't give a testimony about the
[35:01] woman with the fried bread
[35:02] and he didn't finish it off he finished
[35:03] it off in london he's got the tape and
[35:05] we're going to put it on your website
[35:06] try to get it but he was telling the
[35:08] woman listen if the doctors take off
[35:10] your womb
[35:11] i think you i don't see you have the
[35:12] faith if you can't have faith for the
[35:14] fibers to be healed
[35:16] how you have faithfully for the room to
[35:18] be restored
[35:21] when they got a long story short the
[35:22] woman was healed
[35:25] totally and completely he said don't
[35:28] believe the facts the facts say you have
[35:29] five boys
[35:31] the fact is right
[35:36] you can't deny the facts but god is
[35:39] right
[35:40] god is a healer
[35:47] you see i want you to rise to the
[35:49] challenge to shake off your past
[36:00] you leave the life of the people they'll
[36:01] put you in a box because they might have
[36:03] fight that you're going ahead
[36:05] or you're going higher you're going
[36:06] further they will hinder you
[36:08] they will box you in so you can't bother
[36:10] with people trying to put boxes around

[39:39] god too much of fear
[39:42] [Applause]
[39:45] listen you could be fearing the wrong
[39:47] group
[39:49] and you're looking for the right group
[39:51] but i read for you there is no right
[39:53] group
[39:54] in the sense then that god has set no
[39:56] church up there's no certain
[39:58] organizational group can say we have it
[40:00] the resident doesn't have it that's a
[40:02] spirit you know
[40:04] that's right yeah that's the superior
[40:06] written thing
[40:13] if this church right now
[40:17] could be put together and knitted
[40:20] together with such that
[40:21] every person would be in one accord with
[40:23] not one
[40:24] shadow of doubt anywhere there would not
[40:26] be a feeble person in our midst in
[40:29] another five minutes
[40:34] there will be nobody here desiring the
[40:35] holy ghost but what would receive it if
[40:38] you can get that certain thing fixed
[40:51] if i could change your mind i could
[40:52] change your behavior
[40:54] if the world could change your mind you
[40:55] could change your life
[40:57] but you have to want that change be
[41:00] transformed by the renewing
[41:04] of your mind your mind have to change
[41:08] before your heart to change
[41:10] that's why god start to write it's a new
[41:12] heart i'll give you a new spirit
[41:14] and then i'll put my spirit inside your
[41:16] spirit what it is changing your mind
[41:18] changing your thoughts changing the
[41:19] desires
[41:21] amen and we said god invading your very
[41:23] life
[41:29] all right when jesus came on the scene
[41:33] god always vindicates the truth
[41:36] that's the reason today we can't have
[41:37] faith faith is not based upon
[41:39] man's theology faith is based upon the
[41:41] solid
[41:42] rock of god's eternal world before
[41:45] continue i want to say back something
[41:47] we talk about right spirit and wrong
[41:48] doctrine better than
[41:51] right doctrine and wrong spirit that's
[41:53] true but god didn't send a prophet for
[41:56] us to have
[41:56] right spirit and wrong doctrine he's in
[41:59] a prophet that we have the right spirit
[42:01] and right doctrine
[42:03] i want to nail that down so i'm not
[42:05] advocating this right spirit right
[42:07] spirit no no no
[42:08] god and a prophet with thus saith the
[42:11] lord
[42:12] and that prophet said the spirit the
[42:14] bride
[42:15] and the prophet will be saying the same
[42:17] thing
[42:20] and what they say will have already been
[42:23] said in the world
[42:26] you can't take away from it it's toxic
[42:29] of the lord
[42:31] hallelujah hallelujah
[42:34] so watch so jesus a carpenter's son
[42:37] physically speaking when he came to the
[42:39] earth here he was known
[42:41] of the day that john baptized him god
[42:44] vindicated him
[42:46] god spoke from the heavens john saw him
[42:48] coming down in the form of a dove and
[42:50] said this is my beloved son
[42:52] in whom i am pleased to dwell the right
[42:54] translation here is in whom
[42:56] i am pleased to dwell in
[43:00] jesus immediately
[43:03] anointed with god amen amen
[43:07] he was just a man till that time
[43:12] now he becomes a god man
[43:16] [Music]
[43:18] so the anointing of god brings you to
[43:21] become
[43:22] one man a god man hallelujah you see god
[43:25] is a spirit
[43:27] and christ means the anointed one
[43:30] a man anointed with god
[43:35] oh give the lord some praises people
[43:40] and just as a man could be anointed with
[43:42] god a man could be anointed with
[43:44] the devil
[43:48] listen to this jesus was god he had a
[43:51] big job he went over to the meenak in
[43:53] gadara
[43:54] who has been a wild man for years a
[43:56] young fellow we were told had lost his
[43:58] human reasoning
[43:59] lived in tombs with an evil spirit what
[44:01] a place for a man to live in a graveyard
[44:03] is very fitting for the devil to be
[44:04] among dead things
[44:07] so he lived out there and was so
[44:09] terribly afflicted with these demons
[44:11] he broke chains his strength was here we
[44:14] go
[44:14] a super strength did you ever see a man
[44:18] that had been stricken by the
[44:19] evil spirit like that he is several
[44:22] times his strength
[44:23] i have noticed them in the meetings when
[44:26] groups of police couldn't even hold them
[44:28] they would tear them police to pieces
[44:31] and carry on
[44:33] because hey why he is fully surrendered
[44:37] to the evil one
[44:38] it took possession of him and had not
[44:41] his own
[44:42] understanding he only did what the evil
[44:44] spirit put in him to do
[44:46] then i taught with complete surrender to
[44:49] the
[44:50] devil a man can be five times his
[44:53] strength
[44:55] what could complete
[44:58] surrender to god
[45:01] do to a man what would it do to
[45:05] that's weak in the body that can't walk
[45:09] if we could completely yield to the holy
[45:11] ghost
[45:12] god will give us a super strength to
[45:15] rise
[45:15] in the name of jesus christ is he that's
[45:19] in you that he's in the world
[45:20] the strength of god that's in you is
[45:23] greater than any affliction that can
[45:25] come upon you there is nothing can
[45:27] overtake you
[45:28] but you're gonna supersede it because
[45:31] you are full of super power
[45:33] and that superpower is the holy spirit
[45:36] that
[45:36] dominates your life
[45:39] if you are a christian
[45:47] that means everybody here could be
[45:48] healed
[45:50] every sick i could get a touch
[45:52] from heaven
[45:53] you could shake it off yes
[46:08] and jesus he was not god he was all god
[46:12] he created the winds the waves if other
[46:14] things had to obey him he was the
[46:16] creator notice
[46:17] let us remember he also created our
[46:19] bodies
[46:22] he created winds he created waves he
[46:24] created seas he created fishes
[46:26] and he created our bodies let man come
[46:29] from the dust of the earth
[46:31] and god for man first was a spirit man
[46:33] genesis 1
[46:34] then a dust man genesis 2 and god put
[46:37] the spirit man in the dust man
[46:39] that's you and i here this morning
[46:41] hallelujah so he
[46:42] created our bodies just like they create
[46:45] fish and moon and stars and everything
[46:47] else
[46:49] won't our bodies have to obey him
[46:54] come on now come on now help me somebody
[46:57] oh hallelujah
[46:58] so now he's coming on the power of
[46:59] herself
[47:02] that's why when the spirit hit jesus he
[47:04] was he went into the willingness to
[47:06] overcome the lust of the eyes
[47:07] overcome the lust of the flesh overcome
[47:09] the pride of life because before god
[47:11] empowers a man with full power he has to
[47:13] be able to overcome himself
[47:16] no excuses
[47:19] oh give the lord a shout that's
[47:22] nothing but that's gospel that's nothing
[47:25] but the truth
[47:26] people looking for power and have no
[47:27] character no power for them
[47:29] [Applause]
[47:36] waiting god holding back power and
[47:38] because god's stingy
[47:39] and god playing hard to get
[47:42] i had to give he's holding back power
[47:44] again you know
[47:46] you've seen characters know without paul
[47:47] would it be holy basically
[47:49] if they get paul on top of that they be
[47:51] worse
[47:53] oh hallelujah the prime minister's
[47:55] president all the time in opposition the
[47:56] one way
[47:57] so they're coming power to change a
[47:59] different cap fit the head
[48:01] hallelujah there's man all about the
[48:04] poor the struggling the scrunting
[48:07] and some blessings come around them they
[48:09] on top of the world
[48:11] if rainfall they drown their nose up in
[48:12] here
[48:16] and god looking for somebody the more
[48:18] god blesses the more humble
[48:20] they become the more you could bow my
[48:23] god because god was so great he humbled
[48:24] himself and came to us
[48:26] and god wants you to live that out
[48:28] praise god do you believe that
[48:31] so watch he created our bodies won't our
[48:33] bodies obey him you surrender your
[48:34] thoughts to him
[48:35] you surrender your life to him you
[48:37] surrender your faith to him
[48:38] and watch that body will be what he says
[48:42] if you are drunkard and you can't quit
[48:43] drinking surrender that life to him
[48:45] and what you will drink no more if you
[48:48] are a habitual smoker and try to give it
[48:50] up and can't do it
[48:51] just surrender that to him and watch
[48:52] what happens he will make
[48:54] that body come in subjection to the word
[48:58] oh hallelujah but you have got to
[49:00] surrender it to him
[49:02] but people worship the spirit upon them
[49:05] praise god sometimes people don't even
[49:06] want prayer because they want to
[49:07] continue what they're doing
[49:09] so they don't really want no deliverance
[49:11] they really don't want to break through
[49:13] they know it's right the no church nice
[49:15] to go toe and they will come and get
[49:16] blessed but they don't really want that
[49:18] breakthrough yet
[49:18] because they have the things to do they
[49:20] have their friends to keep up
[49:22] they have the places they want to go and
[49:23] this course for a price he said any man
[49:26] follow me
[49:29] let him deny himself
[49:33] take up his cross
[49:34] [Applause]
[49:38] oh glory to god do i hear i shout in the
[49:42] house
[49:47] jesus said if i even come after me
[49:50] people are waiting on the lord within
[49:51] the lord reading lord you see my man
[49:52] come you want him
[49:53] you go after him so seek after him he

[49:58] face god i want you i want a reality i
[50:01] had enough i hear scriptures are your

[50:07] come on save me somebody
[50:13] when last have you argued with god
[50:20] amen because he can't give god talking
[50:23] back to you
[50:25] there had to be a discussion to go into
[50:27] argument but god tell abram i am thy
[50:29] shield
[50:30] and i exceeded great reward and abram
[50:33] said god what what kind of reward are

[55:45] i have the keys of debt and hell why i
[55:48] have
[55:48] overcome here we go and conquered both
[55:52] death and hell that is what the graves
[55:54] and debt itself
[55:55] for you jesus

[57:28] you know what i've overcome it all i
[57:31] will overcome death
[57:32] hell you'll grieve when he was in the
[57:34] earth many men settled to conquer
[57:37] napoleon set up to conquer the world he
[57:39] did at age 33
[57:41] and at the age 17 to 25 napoleon was a
[57:44] prohibitionist
[57:45] he didn't believe in drinking he went to
[57:46] france and and he didn't like it he
[57:48] didn't like france but he conquered
[57:50] he went forth and conquered france he
[57:52] took them frenchmen and conquered the
[57:53] world
[57:54] at the age of 33 he sat down and cried
[57:57] because there was nobody else to conquer
[57:59] and he died an alcoholic
[58:04] says he boss now he's king no
[58:13] and it's pressure to keep maintaining
[58:14] that crown
[58:16] uneasy lies the head that wears that
[58:20] crown
[58:23] he couldn't even conquer himself amen
[58:27] other countries but then when that booze
[58:29] take him so
[58:30] he just had a boy down hallelujah
[58:34] couldn't conquer himself
[58:36] but another man come into this world a
[58:38] young man
[58:39] he died at 33 talking about jesus he
[58:42] conquered
[58:43] everything that could be conquered when
[58:45] he was the earth he conquered passions
[58:47] pride sickness devils when he died he
[58:51] conquered death
[58:52] when he arose he conquered the hell he
[58:54] went in
[58:55] conquered everything that was against
[58:57] mankind
[58:58] divine press of god and crushed it he
[59:01] conquered death
[59:02] he conquered the grave he conquered
[59:04] sickness he conquered formalities
[59:06] everything else
[59:07] and overcoming all rose on the third day
[59:09] and conquered listen
[59:11] all the atmosphere above
[59:17] that cut that mist between god and man
[59:20] and connected heaven and earth together
[59:22] [Applause]
[59:24] give the lord a shout
[59:26] [Applause]
[59:29] the atmosphere was laden with devils and
[59:32] jesus conquered all of that
[59:33] so right now we're feeling victorious
[59:36] celebrations from heaven
[59:38] right now this morning give the lord
[59:40] some praises
[59:42] right now you are feeling victorious
[59:45] vibrations from heaven
[59:51] [Applause]
[59:52] glory fear not
[59:58] hallelujah
[1:00:00] cut every obstacle from the human beings
[1:00:02] that they might be connected like in the
[1:00:04] garden eden
[1:00:05] i was going to choke it but i'm going to
[1:00:07] say it
[1:00:09] man is omnipotent
[1:00:14] you don't believe that but he is
[1:00:19] but here's the fine print of that
[1:00:21] statement
[1:00:23] [Music]
[1:00:25] a man fully surrendered to god
[1:00:31] it's omnipotent
[1:00:36] oh give the lord some praises that's my
[1:00:38] subject a man
[1:00:42] fully surrendered to god is omnipotent
[1:00:46] and when omnipotent speaks
[1:00:50] the miraculous takes place
[1:00:54] hallelujah give the lord a shout on that
[1:00:57] one
[1:00:58] when my omnipotence speak lazarus
[1:01:03] come forth i don't give the man dead how
[1:01:06] many days how he's rotten
[1:01:13] [Applause]
[1:01:17] said one time on a challenge of fate
[1:01:20] that's a great statement
[1:01:21] for a person to make and i want to give
[1:01:23] you in this manner
[1:01:24] you think of yourself now you messed
[1:01:25] this baptist pentecost or whatever you
[1:01:27] are
[1:01:28] if we are the content for that fate and
[1:01:30] we believe that jesus rose from the dead
[1:01:32] this same man that makes the challenge
[1:01:34] that time i said you can't prove
[1:01:36] one thing that there is a god outside
[1:01:39] the supernatural
[1:01:41] for when omnipotence speak the
[1:01:43] miraculous take place
[1:01:45] omnipotence can't speak without being
[1:01:48] miraculous
[1:01:50] so how can a man claim
[1:01:54] to be fully surrendered to god and there
[1:01:57] is no miracle
[1:02:01] almost sound like he's lying or he's not
[1:02:04] talking the full truth
[1:02:06] a man fully
[1:02:10] surrendered to god is omnipotent
[1:02:14] so when jesus was going and looking for
[1:02:16] fig from the victory kiss the tree
[1:02:19] and next day the tree was dried up they
[1:02:22] said master it drive from the roots
[1:02:24] and jesus said somebody said jesus said
[1:02:28] when jesus said it is it he said you
[1:02:31] shall say
[1:02:32] to the mountain be moved and don't doubt
[1:02:35] in your heart
[1:02:36] you can have what you say
[1:02:40] [Music]

[1:03:17] that before

[1:03:41] they're sitting on the premises instead
[1:03:43] of standing on the promises

[1:14:39] hear it and know
[1:14:40] that his god is dusted and lord if it
[1:14:43] isn't just is the lord then it's your
[1:14:44] impression

[1:14:56] you thus here jack mo
[1:14:57] and jackpot hasn't said nothing to me it
[1:14:59] has to come first from god
[1:15:01] not impress it's got to be god
[1:15:04] then it will happen for it is thus saith
[1:15:07] the lord
[1:15:08] woman came to brother branham and she
[1:15:10] couldn't have couldn't have a child and
[1:15:11] so on she couldn't get pregnant and so

[1:15:36] resting upon the woman you know
[1:15:38] not even resting upon her face you know
[1:15:39] it's what god has declared

[1:15:48] god asks if you're going to restore
[1:15:49] anything no you won't know he said i
[1:15:51] will restore
[1:15:52] to you all the years
[1:16:07] [Applause]
[1:16:12] and the holy spirit if a man is anointed
[1:16:15] of god
[1:16:16] will direct you to follow the holy
[1:16:18] spirit and the bible amen
[1:16:19] for he is the one who does these things
[1:16:22] jesus christ
[1:16:23] in the form of the holy spirit oh my
[1:16:27] god praise god so from the resume of the
[1:16:30] church ages he said thus to the lord
[1:16:31] joel 2 38 says be glad general zion
[1:16:34] rejoice in the lord
[1:16:35] for giving you the former rain
[1:16:37] moderately and it will cause the condom
[1:16:39] for you to rain the former natarine in
[1:16:40] the first month
[1:16:41] and the floor shall be full of wheat and
[1:16:43] the fat shall overflow with wine and oil
[1:16:44] and i have restored to you the years the
[1:16:46] lucas has eaten the canker worm the
[1:16:47] caterpillar
[1:16:48] palmer will my great army you shall eat
[1:16:50] and plenty and my people shall never be
[1:16:51] ashamed
[1:16:52] now it says god is going to restore the
[1:16:55] lutheran age didn't restore the church
[1:16:57] it started the reformation isn't that
[1:16:59] right watch
[1:17:00] now this very moment we are in the
[1:17:01] complete fulfillment of matthew 24 24.
[1:17:04] and so much if it possible do you see
[1:17:06] the very elect
[1:17:07] and who is it that they attempt to
[1:17:09] deceive the very elect the spirit of the
[1:17:11] antichrist
[1:17:12] in the force anointing one and last days
[1:17:14] these false ones have already come in
[1:17:16] jesus name
[1:17:17] claiming that they've been anointing of
[1:17:18] god for this last day they are fourth
[1:17:20] messiah's anointed ones
[1:17:22] they claim their prophets but they are
[1:17:25] one with the word never they have added
[1:17:28] or taken from it no one denies that
[1:17:30] spirit of god manifesting his gifts upon
[1:17:32] them
[1:17:33] but like balaam they all have their
[1:17:35] programs make their pay for money
[1:17:37] exercise gifts but deny the word and
[1:17:39] bypass it for fear
[1:17:40] that the controversy might diminish
[1:17:42] their chances for greater gain
[1:17:43] yet they preach salvation and
[1:17:44] deliverance through the power of god
[1:17:46] like judas
[1:17:47] with a ministry impacted by christ but
[1:17:49] because they are wrong seed
[1:17:51] consequently they have the wrong spirit
[1:17:53] motivating them
[1:17:55] and watch this part i want to get to the
[1:17:57] outshine the electing effort and zeal
[1:18:00] but it is now audition not of christ for
[1:18:02] it looks for big crowds big programs
[1:18:04] starting signs among them
[1:18:06] they preach a second coming and so forth
[1:18:08] but deny the advent of a prophet
[1:18:10] messenger
[1:18:10] though in power and signs and true
[1:18:12] revelation equipping them all
[1:18:14] yes it is part this false spirit in the
[1:18:17] last days is so close to the real
[1:18:19] can be distinguished here we go
[1:18:22] only by its deviation from the word
[1:18:26] amen amen not by anointing not by shouts
[1:18:30] not by
[1:18:30] jumping not by singing not by specials
[1:18:32] not by worship
[1:18:34] but by deviating from the word
[1:18:38] that's why we say the prophet and the
[1:18:40] bride and the spirit says the same thing
[1:18:42] and what they say will be already in the
[1:18:45] word
[1:18:46] are you with me watch they can
[1:18:48] distinguish only by his division from
[1:18:50] the word
[1:18:51] or whenever it is caught in being
[1:18:53] anti-word it falls back on one argument
[1:18:55] we already are shown to be false we get
[1:18:57] results don't we
[1:18:59] we have to be of god because we get
[1:19:01] results
[1:19:02] oh my oh my are you with me
[1:19:07] watch watch god had called moses he
[1:19:10] didn't want to go
[1:19:11] those prophets had things it was a hard
[1:19:14] thing to do they didn't want to be going
[1:19:16] out
[1:19:16] and be scorned that they wanted to have
[1:19:18] fellowship and go with the rest of them
[1:19:19] i don't want to do this
[1:19:21] but god has spoken and i must deliver it
[1:19:23] whether it like it whether they
[1:19:24] crucified him whether they stone him
[1:19:25] whatever it is god has spoke to his
[1:19:27] heart
[1:19:27] obedience is better than sacrifice watch
[1:19:31] it was in his heart he must do it it was
[1:19:34] his life he couldn't hold it there was
[1:19:36] something here we go a pulsation that
[1:19:38] pushed them
[1:19:39] they couldn't bless or curse it god had
[1:19:42] so much complete control of them
[1:19:44] till he was their voice their action
[1:19:48] these prophets so look at elijah elijah
[1:19:51] said
[1:19:51] not even rain or dew will fall till i
[1:19:54] call fair
[1:19:55] amen he shut the heavens could you
[1:19:57] imagine a man doing that
[1:19:59] i shut the heavens not even jew or rain
[1:20:02] will fall till i call for it
[1:20:04] this guy was so anointed with god that
[1:20:07] their word was god
[1:20:10] hallelujah then vermont prophecy give me
[1:20:13] a church
[1:20:15] that's so completely anointed with god
[1:20:18] till their every action and move is thus
[1:20:20] say the lord
[1:20:21] walk in that she kind of glory i will
[1:20:23] show you a messiah
[1:20:24] anointed one of god standing up on the
[1:20:26] earth today oh
[1:20:28] hallelujah oh brother give me a church
[1:20:30] full of the holy ghost
[1:20:31] god will do in one year what all
[1:20:33] theology fails to do in 2000 years
[1:20:35] you wait till the anointing of the
[1:20:38] church strikes home
[1:20:40] to that faithful little remnant after
[1:20:42] the doors of the gentiles close
[1:20:44] god will anoint his church then he was
[1:20:46] filled to be filthy still
[1:20:47] whose right to the director still oh my
[1:20:49] what a time oh my
[1:20:51] oh my oh my hallelujah
[1:20:55] so praise god so joseph
[1:20:58] was given a quota many colors and the
[1:21:00] brethren hated him
[1:21:02] he became to bring them peace but they
[1:21:04] misunderstood him
[1:21:05] they hated him without a cause they
[1:21:07] didn't try to stop to see what he was
[1:21:09] trying to achieve
[1:21:10] they just judge him because listen he
[1:21:13] didn't agree with them
[1:21:14] amen they don't agree with them they
[1:21:17] judge you
[1:21:18] he makes himself so and so on so look at
[1:21:20] moses he couldn't help train himself
[1:21:22] there
[1:21:22] he didn't do it hypocritically when god
[1:21:24] tell moses get away there i'm going to
[1:21:26] destroy his people moses put himself in
[1:21:28] the gap and say lord before i destroy
[1:21:29] them destroy me
[1:21:30] amen moses wasn't playing you know
[1:21:33] moses was looking for photoshoot in him
[1:21:35] he was genuine
[1:21:37] spirit of christ in him said before you
[1:21:38] take them people take me first
[1:21:40] it was the spirit of christ in moses
[1:21:44] oh hallelujah are you with me he never
[1:21:47] did it for self-glory
[1:21:49] watch if they would have looked to the
[1:21:51] word
[1:21:52] they would have seen his purpose he will
[1:21:54] always do that to glorify the father
[1:21:56] neither will any servant of god take
[1:21:58] glory neither would any servant take the
[1:21:59] gift of god and try to glorify himself
[1:22:02] i want to read that again a servant of
[1:22:03] god will not take glory
[1:22:05] nina would any servant of god take a
[1:22:07] gift of god
[1:22:08] and try to glorify himself the spirit of
[1:22:12] god
[1:22:13] working in men make men
[1:22:16] act like god no wonder jesus said it's
[1:22:19] not written here god's not a small gene
[1:22:21] a big g
[1:22:22] and if they are called god to whom the
[1:22:25] spirit of god came to
[1:22:26] how can you condemn me when i say i'm
[1:22:28] the son of god they were gods commanding
[1:22:31] because they would hear yeah why here
[1:22:33] why yeah why because
[1:22:34] they had completely surrendered
[1:22:36] themselves to the spirit of god
[1:22:38] and they were working for the glory of
[1:22:40] god
[1:22:43] david said you come with me and shield
[1:22:44] and spare but i come to you in the name
[1:22:46] of the lord
[1:22:47] you have the right objective you have
[1:22:49] the right motive isn't that right
[1:22:51] so when a man is anointed with the
[1:22:54] spirit now let us go real deep
[1:22:57] under the fifth rib on the left side
[1:22:59] when a man
[1:23:01] are you ready everybody alive everybody
[1:23:03] up
[1:23:04] when a man is so anointed with the
[1:23:06] spirit when a man is anointed of the
[1:23:09] spirit of god
[1:23:09] his habits his actions and
[1:23:12] everything is moving in him sometimes
[1:23:14] he's misjudged
[1:23:18] look at david would say my god my god
[1:23:20] wild dog forsaken me
[1:23:21] that was the spirit of christ and david
[1:23:24] and when he raised
[1:23:25] his psalm how could they even say that
[1:23:27] it was the spirit
[1:23:28] saying my god my god somebody said
[1:23:30] listen that hypocrite up there who hands
[1:23:32] his peers who feed his peers that's the
[1:23:33] intellectual
[1:23:34] but one what this element of spirit
[1:23:36] would know that was the spirit of god in
[1:23:38] him crying out
[1:23:39] when a man is anointed here we go again
[1:23:42] of the spirit of god he has got the
[1:23:45] action of god
[1:23:47] are you ready and the action of god is
[1:23:49] never to break
[1:23:50] us up amen the action of god
[1:23:54] is to draw us together for we are one
[1:23:58] in christ jesus god's purpose is to
[1:24:01] bring us together to love one another
[1:24:06] do you get that the action of god is not
[1:24:09] to break up
[1:24:09] [Applause]
[1:24:11] break up husband and wife break up
[1:24:12] families break up churches break up this
[1:24:14] break up that then
[1:24:15] the action of god the action of god is
[1:24:17] to bring together.
[1:24:21] he is making a bride he is hewing the
[1:24:23] chips now chopping off the world
[1:24:25] watch he's cutting you down now cutting
[1:24:28] you down to his wood only
[1:24:29] cutting all the creeds and dogmas and
[1:24:31] everything away from you trying to get
[1:24:32] back a bride for the son
[1:24:34] another masterpiece part of the word how
[1:24:36] could you become bright you have to cut
[1:24:38] shave shape you to be his bride you
[1:24:41] can't come up with your old
[1:24:43] own self he wants to cut the church out
[1:24:46] just like he
[1:24:46] cut the sun out like he did the bride
[1:24:49] and groom to be his bride
[1:24:50] you must be part of him you must leave
[1:24:53] the world
[1:24:54] you'll aim and praise god hallelujah
[1:24:57] he wants a masterpiece today are you
[1:24:59] willing are you ready my christian
[1:25:01] friend
[1:25:01] are you really sure that your life is so
[1:25:03] reflecting up for christ
[1:25:05] no matter what the world say you have
[1:25:06] lost your mind you've gone crazy
[1:25:08] you went and joined the church of holy
[1:25:10] rollers don't pay attention to that
[1:25:12] if you're not truly saved in that body
[1:25:14] and the word of god in you
[1:25:16] and reflecting itself and the life of
[1:25:18] christ reflecting out of you brother
[1:25:20] sister
[1:25:20] don't take that chance i don't care what
[1:25:22] you are what kind of experience you have
[1:25:24] let that work reflect through you each
[1:25:26] day because
[1:25:27] god in this last day is taking a bride
[1:25:30] for his son jesus christ
[1:25:32] not a church for his son a bride for his
[1:25:36] son
[1:25:36] and that bride is made up of members who
[1:25:38] are part of him
[1:25:40] who is part of that word so you could
[1:25:42] never get fight with the word
[1:25:43] because you are going to be the word
[1:25:45] itself so when the word hit you you
[1:25:47] could only say amen
[1:25:49] that word is you you are part of that
[1:25:51] word
[1:25:53] isn't that right so therefore you give
[1:25:55] birth to the tree on the day of
[1:25:56] pentecost isn't that right
[1:25:58] luke 24 49 and do it powerful on high
[1:26:01] and there he give birth to the tree the
[1:26:03] holy ghost pentecost
[1:26:04] justification signification department
[1:26:06] only goes and then christ
[1:26:08] come to dwell in it to bring forth the
[1:26:10] fruits fruits
[1:26:11] justification sanification baptism holy
[1:26:14] ghost
[1:26:14] then the prison of the holy ghost comes
[1:26:17] in that
[1:26:18] to bring forth the fruits oh my
[1:26:21] so all through the ages all these
[1:26:23] organizational vines
[1:26:24] or branches rather and what god keep
[1:26:26] doing cutting them off
[1:26:28] they produce a baptist branch methodist
[1:26:30] branch pentecostal branch keep cutting
[1:26:31] the door because that's not the original
[1:26:32] branch
[1:26:33] god didn't make no pentecost baptist
[1:26:35] church methodist church catholic church
[1:26:36] he didn't make those things men
[1:26:38] set up those things so as the vines and
[1:26:40] branches push out because baptist after
[1:26:42] his kind catholic of this kind methodist
[1:26:44] after his kind everybody after his kind
[1:26:45] but whatever time too but we give the
[1:26:49] lord a shout
[1:26:50] hallelujah every seed have to pray for
[1:26:52] it after his time
[1:26:54] god have a kind too oh hallelujah

[1:27:04] resurrection
[1:27:05] with divine fruit of organization watch
[1:27:07] they will go into organizational group
[1:27:09] and they won't come with the food of the
[1:27:10] vine so we cannot point you to this
[1:27:12] church
[1:27:13] or pointed to an organization or
[1:27:15] pointing to a system you have to be
[1:27:16] pointed to jesus christ

[1:29:45] and i believe these things was to
[1:29:46] accompany the resurrection of jesus
[1:29:47] christ
[1:29:48] ministry watch i am
[1:29:53] okay okay
[1:29:56] loving him we have faith we have love
[1:29:58] but if we have love
[1:30:00] we have faith perfect love casts out
[1:30:03] fear and when fear is gone faith is
[1:30:06] perfect
[1:30:08] when fear is gone
[1:30:11] feet is perfect
[1:30:15] when fear is gone fit is
[1:30:18] perfect you fear gonna lose your job
[1:30:20] your fear will not get the job
[1:30:21] your fear you will this will happen
[1:30:23] that's what happened faith is not made
[1:30:25] perfect but fear
[1:30:26] you throw that fear out and you put
[1:30:28] faith in god and god holds tomorrow
[1:30:31] so everything going to be just right as
[1:30:32] god ordained it to be
[1:30:34] then you move in the fate of god believe
[1:30:36] in god isn't that right
[1:30:38] so but the brandon was passing through a
[1:30:40] field that had a killable
[1:30:43] a not killable is just a title for bulma
[1:30:46] but his name is that killer
[1:30:48] because he killed before so he
[1:30:51] have reputation and but around forget
[1:30:55] that killable was in that field and he
[1:30:58] leave his gun back and so on he's
[1:30:59] walking to the field
[1:31:00] let's continue i turned first i fell for
[1:31:03] the gun it wasn't there
[1:31:04] i'm glad it wasn't i'll probably kill
[1:31:07] the bull
[1:31:08] and paid for it i felt for the gun
[1:31:11] it wasn't there i looked at the fence it
[1:31:13] was too far for me
[1:31:15] there was no trees around for me to get
[1:31:17] to there was
[1:31:18] nothing but to face death i said lord if
[1:31:21] the time has come for me to die
[1:31:23] i want to face it like a man so i showed
[1:31:25] my shoulders down i said if this is it
[1:31:27] if i must die by this bull then i must
[1:31:29] die and
[1:31:30] something happened amen
[1:31:34] i know this song like a child but it's
[1:31:37] the truth
[1:31:38] somehow instead of despising that beast
[1:31:43] i had a love for it and i thought
[1:31:47] that poor thing laying out in the field
[1:31:49] i come
[1:31:50] in on his territory i disturb him
[1:31:53] he don't know no more than to protect
[1:31:55] himself he threw his horns up
[1:31:57] dug the dirt up fell into his knees you
[1:31:59] know what they do before the charge
[1:32:01] and i told that animal i feel so sorry
[1:32:04] sorry i disturbed you i said you can't
[1:32:06] talk to anyone now
[1:32:07] now remember what go tell adam right
[1:32:08] have power over animals and the beast of
[1:32:11] the field and everything else
[1:32:12] this is god talk adam that this is
[1:32:14] genesis
[1:32:15] and this is a man in the 20th century
[1:32:17] and i feel better pulled
[1:32:19] and this is what's happening and i said
[1:32:22] i'm sorry to disturb you i don't want to
[1:32:24] kill you
[1:32:24] i'm a servant of god i'm on my way to
[1:32:26] pray for sick people
[1:32:28] i forget about these signs i was talking
[1:32:30] just like that now
[1:32:31] and there was something another had
[1:32:33] happened
[1:32:34] something has happened now so growing up
[1:32:36] now i wasn't scared of him
[1:32:39] i was no more afraid of that bull than i
[1:32:42] would my brother
[1:32:46] so first something happened he's had a
[1:32:48] lovely bird
[1:32:49] and then something happened again no
[1:32:51] fear you ever see a little child
[1:32:54] with a dog or an animal no fear
[1:32:57] when a big man will frown from a big dog
[1:33:00] the child walks straight up to that dog
[1:33:01] no fear good when the ball made his
[1:33:05] charger come to me
[1:33:06] he come within 10 feet and he stopped
[1:33:10] threw his feet out he looked so depleted
[1:33:14] he looked this way that way he turned
[1:33:16] went right back around
[1:33:17] and laid down and i walk oh no no sorry
[1:33:21] sorry um that is where the church is
[1:33:24] you're always scared it's not going to
[1:33:26] happen that's the reason it don't happen
[1:33:31] when fear love casts out fear when
[1:33:34] you've got love fear is gone
[1:33:35] but as long here we go there's a bomb as
[1:33:38] long as you've got fear
[1:33:39] love cannot operate
[1:33:46] as long as you have fear love
[1:33:50] cannot operate so but around had spoke
[1:33:53] to the bill and tell the world go back
[1:33:54] and sit down and so on right
[1:33:55] and the bull made his charge look
[1:33:57] depleted and he turned
[1:33:59] and went right or back around lay down
[1:34:01] there
[1:34:02] where he got up at i walked across the
[1:34:04] field went out the pasture
[1:34:06] he laid there look at me it was love
[1:34:08] that took the fear away
[1:34:10] and god seen me through now
[1:34:13] in the next part after i got all the
[1:34:16] pastor
[1:34:17] and that left me i was shook like a leaf
[1:34:24] hallelujah did you hear that
[1:34:29] that that whatever come over him
[1:34:33] when he come over to that he was shaking
[1:34:35] like a leaf
[1:34:37] while i was in the presence of him that
[1:34:39] fear had left
[1:34:44] what was it the anointing of god amen
[1:34:47] when i come upon him he's a different
[1:34:49] man what is he
[1:34:51] a god man
[1:34:54] [Applause]
[1:34:55] a man just like adam
[1:34:58] let's continue oh my so but abram says
[1:35:02] here
[1:35:03] watch you are man
[1:35:06] outside you is one man inside of you is
[1:35:08] another man inside of you is
[1:35:09] supernatural
[1:35:11] outside is physical god angel is the
[1:35:14] very same word
[1:35:15] you can't separate god messenger or god
[1:35:18] angel
[1:35:19] which has the greatest authority an
[1:35:21] angel from heaven
[1:35:22] on angela the pulpit which has it the
[1:35:24] angel of the pulpit
[1:35:26] if an angel from heaven comes and
[1:35:27] preached any of the gospel to you
[1:35:29] that that which i have already preached
[1:35:31] let it be a curse so the angel
[1:35:33] anointed with the holy spirit with the
[1:35:35] word stand next to god
[1:35:38] watch oh my god
[1:35:42] he said watch all powers of heaven is
[1:35:44] given into my hand
[1:35:46] oh if the great holy church
[1:35:50] jesus said all paul's heaven has given
[1:35:52] me to my hand go i'll be with you always
[1:35:54] whatever you bind on it i'll burn it by
[1:35:56] heaven whatever loosen it i lose in
[1:35:58] heaven if the great holy church
[1:36:01] only realized its power to do these
[1:36:04] things but there is so much doubt and
[1:36:06] fear
[1:36:06] and trembling wondering if it will could
[1:36:09] it happen
[1:36:10] as long as that exists the church can
[1:36:12] never stand upright but when here we go
[1:36:14] every talk of fear is vanished and the
[1:36:16] holy spirit is completely in control of
[1:36:18] the church
[1:36:19] then all fears are gone and the church
[1:36:22] has the power
[1:36:23] and they have everything that heaven
[1:36:26] owns behind them
[1:36:28] they are ambassadors of the throne
[1:36:31] oh hallelujah praise god do you see that
[1:36:35] now
[1:36:35] all fear gone then you become an
[1:36:38] ambassador of the throne
[1:36:39] when the government set up i sent out an
[1:36:41] ambassador it represents the country
[1:36:43] it represents all the countries behind
[1:36:45] you all the authorities behind you
[1:36:47] and when you become a pastor of the
[1:36:49] throne of god the whole heaven is behind
[1:36:51] you all the authorities behind you
[1:36:53] you're not representing yourself you're
[1:36:55] not representing your own kingdom
[1:36:57] not representing your own family you
[1:36:58] represented the kingdom of the most high
[1:37:01] you are ambassador of the throne of god
[1:37:03] and from that turn proceeding
[1:37:05] and voices oh glory to god and when the
[1:37:08] true anointed of god speaks

[1:43:47] tangerine to produce tangerine
[1:43:49] i thought you said it was an orange tree
[1:43:51] yes but did it quit
[1:43:52] bearing oranges no when the original
[1:43:55] tree

[1:44:04] oh orange another original branch is
[1:44:08] coming forth
[1:44:11] i let the interpretation have been
[1:44:12] grafted in grafted in crafted in
[1:44:14] grafted in grafted in but if that orange
[1:44:17] tree
[1:44:18] put forth another original branch
[1:44:21] it will produce the original fruit
[1:44:26] are you ready when that tree
[1:44:30] puts forth another original branch there
[1:44:32] will be a book of acts
[1:44:33] behind it not a book a talk
[1:44:39] sit down a minute the bible called the
[1:44:42] book of acts
[1:44:43] another book of talk is the acts of the
[1:44:46] holy ghost and the apostles
[1:44:48] and if that branch put forth another
[1:44:49] tree is is another book of acts written
[1:44:52] behind it
[1:44:53] what you're talking about silvan gold
[1:44:54] having none such as i have i give unto
[1:44:56] you
[1:44:57] peter had something he was cursed but he
[1:44:58] denied christ he denied christ three
[1:45:01] times and whatnot but when that power
[1:45:02] hit him

[1:45:30] [Applause]
[1:45:32] no watch go watch watch i am divine okay
[1:45:36] i'll skip that
[1:45:37] watch now how do we get into that body
[1:45:39] by one spirit first corinthians 12
[1:45:41] and by one spirit we're all baptized
[1:45:42] into one body and the spirit
[1:45:45] is the life of christ is that right the
[1:45:47] life of christ
[1:45:48] and the life of any seed which he was
[1:45:50] the word seed
[1:45:51] brings the seed to life and if that
[1:45:55] life is laying in the seed the seed is
[1:45:58] the word
[1:45:58] and this baptism of the holy spirit
[1:46:00] comes upon it it belongs to bring
[1:46:03] that seed to life
[1:46:06] hallelujah oh my oh my
[1:46:09] god hallelujah so the seven angels
[1:46:13] messages blew up the seven seals
[1:46:15] calling the our gentile workers to
[1:46:17] receive the same pay
[1:46:18] the first hour receive the even time
[1:46:21] message restore back that same thing
[1:46:22] again
[1:46:23] if that tree put forth another branch it
[1:46:25] will bear the original fruit
[1:46:27] and there's got to be a restoration of
[1:46:30] all these things at the end of the vine
[1:46:32] so what this is a branch this is a plant
[1:46:34] here this is a stem
[1:46:35] i'll have all kind of branches but right
[1:46:37] to the top our original branch is going
[1:46:39] to pick up
[1:46:41] and that's we're going to get oranges
[1:46:43] out watch
[1:46:44] there's got to comfort a restoration an
[1:46:47] evening light
[1:46:48] to light up and make it right it will
[1:46:51] come out of the vine
[1:46:52] not a denomination that grafted into it
[1:46:55] by the original production of the word
[1:46:57] and it comes from the evening time and
[1:46:59] watch
[1:47:00] no matter how much you preach here we go
[1:47:03] whatever you do
[1:47:04] it cannot be ripened it cannot be
[1:47:07] manifested
[1:47:08] it cannot be vindicated only by him who
[1:47:10] said i am the light of the world
[1:47:12] so there has got to comfort our power
[1:47:13] here we go the holy spirit himself
[1:47:16] to write or vindicate or prove to make
[1:47:19] manifest what he predicted would happen
[1:47:22] so right now we're in talk mode
[1:47:24] prophesying again from version 10 8 11
[1:47:28] until god come to manifest his word so i
[1:47:30] can't prove nothing up to anybody
[1:47:32] or say i'm better than this one no i'm
[1:47:34] waiting because power gonna come
[1:47:37] neutral has it power where's he got his
[1:47:39] power the pentecostal got the power
[1:47:41] we're gonna get ours
[1:47:42] and we are waiting upon that and the
[1:47:44] power is not the thing really
[1:47:46] is the seed is the main thing because
[1:47:49] power come and the seed is not right
[1:47:50] what's going to happen
[1:47:51] amen amen
[1:47:56] so many says if the lord receives evil
[1:47:58] spirit from me from drinking
[1:48:00] from gambling from lying or stealing
[1:48:03] i'll save him
[1:48:04] amen but that's up to you
[1:48:07] you've got something to do did it
[1:48:09] overcome shall i narrate all things
[1:48:11] see how quiet you get when it's up to
[1:48:16] you
[1:48:30] to get clean you also get clean with
[1:48:33] that broom
[1:48:36] and you're picking up the paper and you
[1:48:37] sweep in here and you're cleaning here
[1:48:38] that's how you always get clean
[1:48:40] god can give you strength to clean your
[1:48:42] homes but if you expect an angel to come
[1:48:45] down to our history with your sweeping
[1:48:47] keep on waiting hallelujah
[1:48:50] all right you you you'll be keeping on
[1:48:53] praying it's just that that prayer will
[1:48:54] not be answered
[1:48:56] in other words you're wasting time get
[1:48:58] cracking and get it cleaned up
[1:49:01] [Applause]
[1:49:02] don't mean to rebuke anybody that's up
[1:49:04] to you it's something you got to do
[1:49:05] they'll overcome we'll inherit all
[1:49:07] things day that overcome your power to
[1:49:09] do it
[1:49:10] but you must be willing to lay it down
[1:49:12] she has made herself ready
[1:49:14] you see god could not push you to a pipe
[1:49:16] and pull you out on the other side and
[1:49:18] say
[1:49:18] blessed that he said overcome it you had
[1:49:20] nothing to overcome he just pushed you
[1:49:22] through
[1:49:22] but you've got to make decisions for
[1:49:24] yourself
[1:49:26] i had to make decisions for myself and
[1:49:28] in doing that
[1:49:29] we show faith and respect to god oh
[1:49:33] hallelujah praise god but god is the
[1:49:36] creator living in you
[1:49:38] given you all the power and you are in
[1:49:40] possession of anything that he had
[1:49:41] so it is in you to abstain from evil to
[1:49:44] do good
[1:49:45] to shun evil the fruit of righteousness
[1:49:47] to walking from temptation all
[1:49:48] malice hatred strife envy and so forth
[1:49:50] come away from it
[1:49:51] for it takes him from your heart
[1:49:55] oh holly dear brother sister if you
[1:49:57] haven't got the bathroom holy ghost this
[1:49:58] morning
[1:49:59] run into the kingdom of god as quick as
[1:50:01] you can
[1:50:02] oh hallelujah the disciples had power
[1:50:05] but enough faith to move the power
[1:50:07] and that's what the matter with the
[1:50:08] church today the people today it's not a
[1:50:10] lack of power
[1:50:11] no it's a lack of faith to move the
[1:50:13] power what is it
[1:50:14] you have got to get the word and what
[1:50:17] you have got to get with the word
[1:50:19] and get yourself killed out i am
[1:50:21] persuaded that many of us friends there
[1:50:23] we go
[1:50:24] have received the holy ghost but we
[1:50:26] receive enough holy ghost
[1:50:28] to make us that place where we don't
[1:50:29] want to lie we don't want to steal
[1:50:31] we don't want to do anything but god
[1:50:34] wants
[1:50:34] to fill every fiber of his church he
[1:50:38] wants to fill your thinking
[1:50:39] he wants to fill your mind he wants to
[1:50:41] fill a bit of you
[1:50:42] so if you're watching movies movies
[1:50:44] movies what chance god have
[1:50:45] to put anything in your mind because you
[1:50:48] caught up in that movie world
[1:50:49] you caught up in that magazine world you
[1:50:51] call it in that novel world
[1:50:53] and god have no place to inject himself
[1:50:55] but as you die out and all the nervous
[1:50:57] that have moved this way
[1:50:58] the movies start to move out there and
[1:51:00] go start to move in movies move out
[1:51:07] his presence in the individual with a
[1:51:10] personal vindication of himself
[1:51:12] expressing himself the living word that
[1:51:15] is promising itself through you
[1:51:17] it's not a group i'll take one and leave
[1:51:20] one
[1:51:21] amen it's a personal vindication of a
[1:51:24] pregnant
[1:51:25] child of god i'm longing for the old
