[13:54] and revelation chapter 1 verse 1 to 3.
[13:57] there's two portion of scriptures
[13:59] ephesians 4 11-13 and revelation 1 1-3
[14:13] ephesians 4
[14:15] verse 11 and he gives some apostles and
[14:17] some prophets and some evangelists
[14:19] some pastors and teachers for the
[14:21] perfecting of the saints
[14:23] for the work of the ministry
[14:25] for the edifying of the body of christ
[14:28] till we all come in the unity of the
[14:30] fate
[14:31] and of the knowledge of the son of god
[14:33] unto a perfect man
[14:35] unto the measure of the stature
[14:38] of the fullness of christ
[14:40] revelation chapter 1
[14:42] i want to read from verse 1-3
[14:47] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[14:50] give unto him
[14:52] jesus christ to show unto his servants
[14:56] things
[14:57] which must shortly come to pass
[15:00] and he's sentenced signified by his
[15:02] angel unto his servant john
[15:05] who'll be a record of the word of god
[15:08] and of the testimony of jesus christ and
[15:10] of all things that he saw
[15:13] blessed is he that read it
[15:15] indeed that hear the words of this
[15:18] prophecy
[15:19] and keep those things which are written
[15:21] therein
[15:22] for the time is at hand
[15:24] let us bow heads almighty god may you
[15:27] inspire us
[15:29] edify us
[15:31] reveal yourself to us
[15:33] come among us
[15:34] manifest your love to us
[15:37] we are helpless this morning
[15:39] we are needy this morning and we call
[15:41] upon your matchless name
[15:43] your awesome power to make known your
[15:46] word to your people take me out of the
[15:48] way
[15:49] hindi and calvary's cross i may be
[15:51] glorified in our midst and jesus might
[15:54] ask it amen and name you may be seated
[15:56] praise god
[16:06] well this morning i have a title
[16:08] the passion to know the word
[16:12] that's the title this morning the
[16:13] passion
[16:14] to know
[16:16] the word
[16:17] i have a subject
[16:19] the knowledge of the son of god
[16:23] another inspiration
[16:25] god said so
[16:28] our context scripture from psalms 119
[16:32] verse 9 says wear it thou shall a young
[16:34] man cleanse his way
[16:37] by taking he thereon to according to thy
[16:40] word
[16:41] with my whole heart have i sought thee
[16:45] oh let me not wander from thy
[16:46] commandments
[16:48] thy word have i hidden my heart
[16:51] that i might not sin
[16:53] against thee think that scripture would
[16:55] read in again this from psalms 119 verse
[16:58] nine where it all shall a young man
[17:00] cleanses me how that young man to be
[17:02] cleansed by taking heed there to
[17:06] according to thy word
[17:08] with my whole heart have i sought thee
[17:10] oh let me not wander from thy
[17:12] commandments
[17:14] thy word have i hidden my heart
[17:17] that i might not sin against thee
[17:20] so his word you could actually hide it
[17:21] in your heart
[17:22] you could treasure it nobody can see it
[17:25] on you it's inside of there you are
[17:27] covered inside your heart
[17:28] david said with my whole heart i sought
[17:30] out today now passion means a strong
[17:34] feeling or enthusiasm or excitement for
[17:37] something
[17:38] that's what a passion is it's enthusiasm
[17:41] a strong feeling that causes you to act
[17:44] in a dangerous way that's when you have
[17:46] passion
[17:48] passion is emotions as distinguished
[17:49] from reason when somebody have a passion
[17:52] it looks like they have reasoning they
[17:54] are zealous
[17:55] they are enthusiastic
[17:56] they are on fire
[17:58] they have an output
[18:00] they are animated they have joy there's
[18:03] an intensity to go with it you don't
[18:05] have passion half dead you don't have
[18:07] passion have sleepy that's not passion
[18:10] you are sleepy passion you excited about
[18:13] it you can't wait to get there
[18:15] god when they said unto me let us go in
[18:17] the house of the lord
[18:19] and we talk in this moment a passion to
[18:21] know the word of god a passion to know
[18:24] what god said that you could tell that
[18:26] every god said so
[18:28] come on say him and somebody you got to
[18:30] know what you have to tell that devil
[18:33] because when you're confronted by that
[18:34] devil you don't know you don't know what
[18:36] to tell that devil the devil will slap
[18:38] you up tap you up and push you in the
[18:40] corner but when you know it is written
[18:42] come on it is written when you know it
[18:44] is written it is written oh i want fire
[18:47] to break upon your soul that there will
[18:50] be a deep in your soul crying for the
[18:52] word of god
[18:54] hallelujah praying for the knowledge of
[18:57] the son of god
[18:59] hallelujah blessed is he that read it
[19:03] and here at the words of this book oh
[19:06] give the lord a shout of praise people
[19:10] hallelujah
[19:12] praise the name of the lord
[19:14] now the scripture we read in ephesians
[19:16] in the amplified he said and his gifts
[19:18] were varied he himself appointed and
[19:21] give men to us
[19:23] some to be apostles
[19:25] special messengers is the amplifier some
[19:27] prophets
[19:29] inspire teachers and expounders some
[19:32] evangelists preachers of the gospel
[19:34] traveling missionaries some pastors
[19:36] shepherds of his teachers
[19:40] his intention was the perfecting
[19:43] and the fully equipping of the saints
[19:46] his consecrated people that they should
[19:49] do the work of ministering
[19:52] towards building up christ's body
[19:55] the church
[19:56] so the real church is christ
[19:59] body
[20:00] it's not men church
[20:02] no it is my church the one that jesus
[20:05] said he's gonna build
[20:07] that is his body
[20:08] so when we talk about church we're not
[20:10] talking about this building or this
[20:12] bunch of people we're talking about by
[20:13] one spirit we are baptized into one body
[20:16] and that body is called the church come
[20:20] on same as somebody so this is a
[20:22] gathering of people we say this is
[20:24] church but the real church is the body
[20:27] of which he is the head
[20:29] come on say man somebody
[20:31] not pope francis
[20:33] no he is the head
[20:35] of that body
[20:36] hallelujah not some bishop in rome or
[20:38] any other bishop from any other part of
[20:40] the world he is the head of that body do
[20:43] you know him
[20:44] oh hallelujah do you know him you've got
[20:47] to know him hallelujah okay
[20:50] [Music]
[20:51] here this part
[20:52] that it might develop
[20:55] until we all attain oneness in the fate
[20:59] and in the comprehension
[21:01] of the full and accurate knowledge of
[21:04] the son of god
[21:06] that we might arrive at really mature
[21:09] manhood
[21:10] the completeness of personality which is
[21:13] nothing less than the standard height of
[21:15] christ's own perfection
[21:17] the measure of this touch of the
[21:19] fullness of christ and the completeness
[21:21] found in him
[21:23] till we all come into the union of the
[21:25] faith the knowledge of the son of god
[21:27] unto a perfect man unto the measure of
[21:29] the statue of that's what we're talking
[21:31] about with full maturity
[21:34] fully grown
[21:35] that they could handle your stuff
[21:37] no more immature no more childish no
[21:40] more playing nintendo and playing games
[21:43] and so forth praise god and the plane
[21:45] coming back down say a big man and he
[21:46] says hold forward triple trip whole
[21:48] triple trippy times going like that ding
[21:50] ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding
[21:51] ding ding
[21:55] the complaint of god
[21:57] and you will see where the title comes
[21:58] from
[21:59] but the brandon was reading version two
[22:01] for never rest i have someone against
[22:02] thee because thou has left thy first
[22:04] love
[22:05] hallelujah
[22:07] you see i like your labor
[22:09] i like how you hate them who uh and hate
[22:13] the nicolaitan spirit i like how you're
[22:15] challenging them say the apostles are
[22:17] not on a phone to be liars you're
[22:19] exposing liars they're pulling a rank on
[22:21] you you're checking them out by the word
[22:23] of god hallelujah nobody pulling wool
[22:26] over your eye no you know the word
[22:28] because paul taught them they used to
[22:30] tell them you're not preaching what paul
[22:31] preached they're not preaching what paul
[22:33] preached paul is the messenger of the
[22:34] age he's a star he's the in the right
[22:36] hand of almighty god you got to say what
[22:38] paul said if you're not single paul say
[22:40] you are false
[22:42] amen
[22:43] [Applause]
[22:45] that's how these two that's how these
[22:47] ephesians believers were like that they
[22:49] were in the word
[22:50] they know the word oh glory to god they
[22:53] had a passion to know the word
[22:56] that is another word they just come to
[22:59] church they want to be just in the
[23:00] message they want to become the message
[23:02] do you know your message
[23:05] [Music]
[23:08] so god have a complaint against them
[23:10] you left the first love
[23:12] that works
[23:13] that building that deakin ushers and
[23:15] elders did everything you could think
[23:17] about but the love was not there
[23:20] hallelujah because for god it has to be
[23:22] about love
[23:24] you have to love him
[23:25] to truly save him
[23:27] isn't that right
[23:28] listen to the prophet now okay here we
[23:30] go
[23:32] to understand this you must realize
[23:35] that this no he's referring to the same
[23:37] statement nevertheless i have somewhat
[23:39] against thee because i was left thy
[23:41] first love
[23:42] to understand this
[23:44] you must realize
[23:46] the spirit is not speaking to the
[23:48] original saints of ephesus alone
[23:52] this message is to the entire age
[23:55] which lasted 120 years
[23:57] the message then is to all the
[24:00] generations in that span
[24:02] now history keeps repeating itself
[24:05] in the generation of israel we see
[24:06] revival in one generation
[24:08] only to see the fires phasing on the
[24:10] next
[24:11] in the third generation the embers may
[24:13] be glowing slightly
[24:14] fought there'll be no vestige of the
[24:16] original flame then god have to light
[24:19] the fire again
[24:20] and the same process is repeated what is
[24:23] he saying god's fire start off he go
[24:25] lower he go lower then he had to find it
[24:28] because you see no fire
[24:33] again
[24:34] fire flare up
[24:36] zeal enthusiasm passion love of god and
[24:39] then fire cool down
[24:41] cool down
[24:42] and that repeat over and over
[24:44] so listen to how we describe it
[24:46] then god lights a fire again same
[24:48] process is repeated it's simply the
[24:50] manifestation of truth that god has no
[24:52] grandchildren
[24:54] amen
[24:55] salvation is not passed by natural birth
[24:57] any more than there's any truth or
[24:59] positive succession
[25:00] it isn't in the world
[25:02] you start out with truly born again
[25:04] believers
[25:06] and then the next generation are no
[25:08] longer just plain christians but they
[25:09] have taken a denominational name
[25:12] there are no baptists methodists that's
[25:14] exactly what they are too they are not
[25:15] christians
[25:16] you have to be born of the will of god
[25:20] not the will of man not because your
[25:22] mother in church is a christian your
[25:23] father in church christian is to be
[25:25] christ-like
[25:29] [Applause]
[25:32] some of the most evil people
[25:34] is in his message
[25:35] say good lord
[25:39] that's not bad behavior people you know
[25:40] they're not boxing people they're going
[25:42] to the other side now
[25:43] they need to
[25:44] believe this but the evil
[25:46] evil spirited
[25:48] now watch
[25:49] they're not christians you have to be
[25:50] born of the will of god not of the will
[25:52] of man to be saved but these folks are
[25:54] all coming together by the will of man
[25:56] now i don't say that some of them not
[25:57] end of all right with god no but the
[26:00] original fire has died down
[26:03] this is where i get it from now and i
[26:05] see three messages out of the day
[26:07] the fervent desire to please god the
[26:10] passion to know his word
[26:12] the cry for reaching out in the spirit
[26:14] all begins to fade
[26:17] and instead of the church being on fire
[26:18] with the fire of god it has cooled off
[26:21] and become formal
[26:23] that is what was happening to the
[26:24] ephesians
[26:26] they were getting a bit formal the
[26:27] abandonment of god
[26:32] was dying out
[26:34] and people here we go want to careful
[26:37] about what god taught of them
[26:39] as they begin to be careful about what
[26:41] the world
[26:42] taught of them
[26:44] so then you have to do it here a certain
[26:46] way because you ain't nobody laughed at
[26:47] you
[26:48] that addresses it no way because then
[26:49] when you laugh at you and you see
[26:51] muslims you see people in the gong it
[26:53] could be hot and the only the eye alone

[37:22] he focus himself listen away from the
[37:25] lust of the world
[37:26] he focused himself away
[37:28] from the beauty and power he had with
[37:31] his own wisdom he had within his own
[37:33] potential to receive
[37:36] something you can make money here make
[37:38] money here achieve this here at what
[37:39] cost
[37:41] at what price
[37:43] sometimes it just isn't worth it
[37:45] we have to learn the sin no
[37:47] your time is too precious you have to
[37:50] say no to people who waste your time
[37:57] i know one executive user asked one of
[37:58] his partners how much time is saying no

[38:03] say no becoming more the better

[38:10] track you from your goals
[38:12] everything
[38:14] everything comes to distract you you
[38:17] want to do this this call this text this
[38:20] person said this this person wanted but
[38:22] this is what you want to do
[38:24] where am i going to shut down this and
[38:26] shut down that and shut down that you
[38:27] can't focus
[38:29] paul said i i pressed towards
[38:32] the mark of the high calling but he said
[38:35] forgetting the things that i passed
[38:37] because he passed a strap you
[38:39] into looking back what you miss what you
[38:40] lose but you're not seeing what you're
[38:42] going after but he took my press forward
[38:45] i press towards the mark i i lean
[38:47] forward i strive
[38:49] i give a push in your spirit i am not
[38:52] what i'm supposed to be so i'm striving
[38:54] i'm not perfect yet but i'm striving i'm
[38:56] not ready yet but i'm striving therefore
[38:58] i can't be tidy i can't be i'll just
[39:00] bail bow and under no i've got to press
[39:02] my way i feel tired yes but i shake it
[39:05] off
[39:05] praise god the snake bit me but i shake
[39:08] it off
[39:09] shake it off in the fire disaffect me
[39:10] but i shake it off i get this mind
[39:13] battle but i'm shaking it off
[39:15] because i've got to go where i'm
[39:16] supposed to go i've got to make it
[39:19] come on sam and somebody
[39:22] hallelujah
[39:23] oh glory glory glory
[39:25] so he focused that out until he's seen
[39:27] the blessed people by the promise of god
[39:30] by the promise of god
[39:31] but he focused in because he knowed what
[39:35] that god promised abraham he would be
[39:37] visit his people
[39:38] and he knew he was rather for that
[39:40] purpose so he focused it all out
[39:42] pharaoh did not have that potential
[39:45] he was offered it but he refused it and
[39:47] when you refuse that you can't focus
[39:50] a powerful statement
[39:52] you cannot accept the devil's word until
[39:54] he reject god's truth
[39:57] so before you go into rebellion mode you
[39:59] young people boy you break all your red
[40:01] lights because they don't listen to
[40:02] modern father that's the bible say honor
[40:04] your mother and father that your days
[40:05] might be long before you do all of that
[40:07] you have to go in rebellion mode
[40:09] where you don't want to hear god
[40:11] you don't want to hear reason you don't
[40:13] want to hear the word you don't want to
[40:14] hear those that go on in front of you
[40:16] that have experience
[40:18] that pain and burn on the stones and
[40:20] rock ahead
[40:21] because you haven't seen the rocks yet
[40:23] you prepare to go yourself
[40:25] because you really want to do your own
[40:27] thing
[40:28] you really want to do your own thing and
[40:30] you feel you know because you are young
[40:33] and you're strong
[40:36] as something that strong could work
[40:37] against you
[40:38] you end up strong will foolish
[40:41] strong will
[40:42] instead of surrendering your will to god
[40:45] and that's why you have to be able to
[40:46] surrender thy will be done
[40:48] thy will be done
[40:50] on earth as it's in heaven and the only
[40:52] way you can get a revelation of god's
[40:54] will is by getting his word because his
[40:56] word reveal his will
[40:57] so if you're not in the word you cannot
[40:59] even know the will of god

[45:50] permission to fly
[45:52] it's built into them
[45:54] it's built into flags

[46:39] relationship of christ
[46:42] you see if they get the relationship
[46:43] with christ you wouldn't bother with how
[46:46] brethren i can operate

[46:54] had is your hoods
[46:56] that's your human spirit i don't want to

[47:20] give me a farmer give me a preacher give
[47:23] me any man that will put god first i
[47:26] will show you a man that is successful
[47:28] despite everything the devil can put in
[47:31] front of him
[47:34] i will say it again he said give me a
[47:36] man give me a farmer give me a preacher
[47:39] give me a housewife give me any person
[47:42] that will put god first i will show you
[47:45] somebody that is successful despite
[47:48] everything the devil could true at
[47:51] oh you should be shouting on that one
[47:54] you should be shouting that one because
[47:57] you should be warned to be that one
[47:59] that puts god first
[48:04] that's right
[48:06] how could you put god first when you're
[48:08] doing your own thing
[48:10] how could you put god first when you're
[48:11] not in the word
[48:13] how could you put first god first when
[48:14] you don't have a passion to know the
[48:16] will of god you know what jesus said i
[48:19] must be
[48:20] about
[48:22] my father's business
[48:24] my father's business to finish the work
[48:28] that means as far as prison was in the
[48:29] world
[48:30] when jesus went into the temple he
[48:33] didn't just read any scripture the bible
[48:36] said he found a place
[48:38] where it was written
[48:40] how could he find that if he wasn't in
[48:42] the word he wasn't the word he knew
[48:46] where to find it he knew when to find it
[48:49] he knew when to read it he know when to
[48:51] fulfill it that is what
[48:54] he was so on point he was so
[48:58] caught up
[48:59] with word and thought of god and
[49:02] expressing god's thoughts that when they
[49:04] say the heavens will pass away but my
[49:07] words
[49:08] could never pass
[49:10] that's how conscious he became
[49:12] of the power now mind you
[49:15] the prophets had that authority also
[49:18] when elijah cursed the church and the
[49:19] bears came after them because he said
[49:20] god had to honor them with his word
[49:22] because was the word of a prophet
[49:24] prophet is the more peace of god so they
[49:26] have to be careful what they say that
[49:28] curse was a curse a blessing was a
[49:30] blessing or when they released your
[49:31] blessing nobody could take that back
[49:33] when there is a curse nobody could take
[49:35] that back
[49:36] so when the prophet blesses you you are
[49:38] blessed
[49:39] come on same as somebody when that word
[49:41] is released from his mouth you have it
[49:44] that's when christ came along the mighty
[49:45] angel and seven thunders uttered the
[49:47] voices when that voice is uttered to you
[49:50] nobody could take that away
[49:53] from you
[49:55] oh glory and god show you who you are
[49:58] when god show you your sonship there's
[50:00] no devil to take that away satan is
[50:03] jealous this morning
[50:05] because he can't be who you are
[50:07] he can't get what you are proud to
[50:09] receive he has no inheritance in this
[50:11] kingdom
[50:13] oh hallelujah the kingdom is the word
[50:15] already in you and the kingdom is the
[50:17] word turning into power
[50:21] oh give the lord praise his people
[50:24] hallelujah

[50:30] oh glory to god his word is truth
[50:33] always the truth his believing children
[50:36] believe for it and cry for it until his
[50:39] word is vindicated his word is always
[50:42] his will and if you want to know what
[50:44] the will of god is find it in the bible
[50:48] once it's god's word it is will it's
[50:50] god's will for you to testify it's god

[1:02:14] hallelujah that's what i want to be
[1:02:17] i want to be whatever
[1:02:21] he wants me to be
[1:02:24] i love him
[1:02:26] and if he should cast me into hell i
[1:02:28] will still love him
[1:02:31] if i go with the same spirit i have now
[1:02:38] you kind of look at me strange
[1:02:40] i've seen four or five of them young men
[1:02:42] young wives fine women i know them boys
[1:02:44] love their wives i said to them here's
[1:02:45] the way to test it if your wife
[1:02:49] before you were married
[1:02:51] say you before married life you've been
[1:02:53] dreaming you were married you really
[1:02:55] wasn't married but your dream you were
[1:02:57] and you woke up and went and talked it
[1:02:58] over with your girlfriend and said you
[1:03:00] know i dream we were married and we had
[1:03:02] children
[1:03:04] we're living happy and waiting for the
[1:03:05] come of the lord and everything else
[1:03:06] and this girl said to you you know i
[1:03:08] love another man better than i love you
[1:03:11] i would be happier with the other man
[1:03:14] could you from your heart
[1:03:16] love her
[1:03:18] well enough to say
[1:03:21] god bless and rest upon you my dear
[1:03:23] go with this other man amen amen
[1:03:26] that's serious stuff
[1:03:29] that is not skim milk
[1:03:33] you see you see how the immense light
[1:03:34] light light happens
[1:03:36] god this is serious stuff
[1:03:39] now check that
[1:03:40] each of you man or woman
[1:03:43] if your love is correct
[1:03:46] you
[1:03:47] would do
[1:03:48] that
[1:03:50] for you are interested in her welfare
[1:03:54] you see there are so many
[1:03:55] selfish people
[1:03:57] what come with their mothers i myself
[1:03:59] and i comment again
[1:04:02] so their stories i myself i
[1:04:05] what i want what i feel what i want
[1:04:07] they're selfish they don't give to those
[1:04:09] and it's strange things something
[1:04:10] open to me about selfishness selfish
[1:04:12] people get jealous
[1:04:14] because there's one all for themselves
[1:04:16] when they see somebody have more than
[1:04:17] them or better than them they get a
[1:04:18] fight
[1:04:19] and they can get more selfish to get
[1:04:21] what they have
[1:04:24] so god could hardly bless somebody that
[1:04:26] is selfish because he blessing us up
[1:04:27] right there
[1:04:29] the blessing is stopping us from because
[1:04:30] shuts down there
[1:04:32] when god finds somebody that could give
[1:04:34] he challenges things through them amen
[1:04:36] and the more they can give the more they
[1:04:37] get to give and god just using them
[1:04:40] because they come like a channel of
[1:04:41] god's love and presence god know if he
[1:04:43] dropped too much upon that selfish
[1:04:45] rascal that rascal will keep it for
[1:04:46] themselves it goes nowhere
[1:04:48] so god would like to get people that
[1:04:50] could he could flow through there is my
[1:04:52] spirit flowing freely there is my life
[1:04:56] there is my love flowing there is my
[1:04:59] grace flowing there is my power flowing
[1:05:03] because christianity is not living for
[1:05:04] yourself is living for others come and
[1:05:07] give the lord a shout that's what he's
[1:05:08] telling ideas
[1:05:12] you don't come here for you you coming
[1:05:14] for somebody else
[1:05:15] it makes life worth living
[1:05:18] oh hallelujah tried to testify a joy to
[1:05:22] invite somebody at the service a joy to
[1:05:24] witness about his love
[1:05:27] amen
[1:05:28] not complain about your husband and the
[1:05:29] others who have none
[1:05:32] complain about your wife and some might
[1:05:34] have none yeah

[1:08:05] you love him this morning
[1:08:07] all right let's continue jesus said
[1:08:09] verily i said unto you this generation
[1:08:10] shall not pass away did all these things
[1:08:11] be fulfilled
[1:08:13] heavens will pass away but my words
[1:08:14] shall not pass away
[1:08:16] revelation 22 i testify under every man
[1:08:19] whether baron said that spree spoke
[1:08:21] bishop still prospered or whatever that
[1:08:23] here at the words of the prophecy of
[1:08:24] this book if any man shall add unto
[1:08:27] these things god shall add into him the
[1:08:28] plagues that are written in this book
[1:08:31] he said what about your dogma
[1:08:33] what about your unscriptural creeds
[1:08:34] you're listening to all the nomination
[1:08:36] there's not one excuse if any man shall
[1:08:39] take away from the words
[1:08:42] of the book of this prophecy god shall
[1:08:44] take away his part out of the book of
[1:08:46] life and out of the holy city brother
[1:08:48] branham do he be a preacher
[1:08:50] do he be a church member all his life
[1:08:52] though he be a bishop of a pope
[1:08:54] whosoever shall take one word
[1:08:56] that's one word
[1:08:58] do you realize it was one word that he
[1:09:00] doubted caused all this trouble
[1:09:02] one spoken word of god doubted caused
[1:09:05] every sickness every disease every
[1:09:07] hospital to be built every operation to
[1:09:09] be performed
[1:09:10] just one word mixing you've got to take
[1:09:13] the way god spoke it
[1:09:15] and won't mix with nothing
[1:09:17] jesus said if you have faith like a
[1:09:19] mustard seed a mustard seed don't mix
[1:09:22] is that kind of faith just one word
[1:09:24] isn't that right blessed be the name of
[1:09:26] the lord
[1:09:27] so watch
[1:09:28] and we went at you with that the seed
[1:09:30] started first and then slightly doubted
[1:09:32] and in syria and then he went on to mary
[1:09:36] so today
[1:09:37] confused about the evidence of the holy
[1:09:38] ghost satan can imprison any kind of
[1:09:40] gift of god but he cannot bring that
[1:09:42] word word by word
[1:09:44] that's where you feel in the garden of
[1:09:46] eden that's where you always feel and
[1:09:48] that's where the tape unfortunate ones
[1:09:50] they can be anointed with the spirit
[1:09:52] speak in tongues shall preach the gospel
[1:09:54] and still be a devil
[1:09:58] did you hear that church
[1:09:59] anointed and still be a devil but now
[1:10:02] the same thing is this if here we go if
[1:10:05] you are son of god and if i am a son of
[1:10:08] god or daughter of god we were in god at
[1:10:10] the beginning
[1:10:11] and when jesus became the fullness of
[1:10:13] the word then we were in him in german
[1:10:16] form
[1:10:17] when he was crucified he was crucified
[1:10:20] in his body
[1:10:21] when he rose from the dead we rose with
[1:10:23] him
[1:10:24] and since we recognize that we are now
[1:10:26] set in heavenly places
[1:10:28] in christ jesus because we are sons and
[1:10:31] daughters of god we are god's children
[1:10:34] we are attributes of god and when jesus
[1:10:38] became all the world that we were part
[1:10:40] of him
[1:10:41] there you are and there is no devil no
[1:10:43] powers can ever move it
[1:10:45] that's the typos of the soul
[1:10:49] no devil could move that
[1:10:51] no minister could move that no bishop no
[1:10:54] pope could take your name out of the
[1:10:56] lamb's book of life because you are the
[1:10:58] words of the book
[1:11:00] hallelujah
[1:11:02] that's why the book has to open
[1:11:04] because you are the words of the book
[1:11:07] come on say amen somebody
[1:11:09] you were gene torch in the back part of
[1:11:11] his mind but the words are taught
[1:11:13] expressed
[1:11:15] so the thought had to be spoken
[1:11:18] oh glory to god
[1:11:20] to come into a manifestation and god
[1:11:22] said my word shall not return unto me
[1:11:26] void but it shall accomplish your
[1:11:28] purpose i shall vote to accomplish
[1:11:32] [Applause]
[1:11:34] oh
[1:11:35] hallelujah
[1:11:36] [Applause]
[1:11:39] hallelujah
[1:11:40] so i don't care how much you can preach
[1:11:42] how much you love this and love that's
[1:11:45] one of the oldness of the spirit you
[1:11:46] can't love with your body your love with
[1:11:48] your spirit that's one outlets of the
[1:11:51] spirit you can love and even love god
[1:11:52] and still not be right you can cast out
[1:11:54] devils and preach and do these things to
[1:11:55] not be right but in the beginning was
[1:11:57] the word
[1:11:58] the word was with god in the words god
[1:11:59] was god you see the word touching your
[1:12:02] very soul
[1:12:04] that's why jesus could go to the water
[1:12:05] well and see what's what's in her soul
[1:12:08] the world sees she was a prostitute she
[1:12:10] was living with this man and that man
[1:12:11] but jesus saw beyond all of that and saw
[1:12:14] the seed in that woman
[1:12:15] and the word went to call the word
[1:12:18] the word when they called it thought the
[1:12:20] word went to call the attribute
[1:12:23] [Applause]
[1:12:26] hallelujah
[1:12:28] so when the mighty angel came down he
[1:12:30] had to have a man
[1:12:32] on the earth that he could step into to
[1:12:34] speak the word that adam was supposed to
[1:12:36] speak because adam was supposed to make
[1:12:39] and multiply and get back more sons and
[1:12:42] daughters of god but because adam fell
[1:12:44] we had to go back to a whole cycle and
[1:12:46] now don't come the book the mighty angel
[1:12:49] one with the sweat black wings one with
[1:12:51] the seventh seal seven thunders or tiny
[1:12:53] voices to bring back sons go to the
[1:12:56] angel and take the book eat the book and
[1:12:58] prophesy you gotta have a passion to
[1:13:00] know the word a passion for that book
[1:13:03] give me the book
[1:13:05] [Applause]
[1:13:12] hallelujah
[1:13:13] oh glory to god
[1:13:15] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:13:17] oh glory to god hallelujah praise god
[1:13:20] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:13:22] they are some denominational churches
[1:13:24] that are ultimate to their believers
[1:13:26] this is my church this is my church this
[1:13:28] is my church they love their
[1:13:30] church the catholics love their priests
[1:13:32] love the nuns love rome
[1:13:34] love pope francis
[1:13:36] that is their pope
[1:13:42] but
[1:13:44] to me
[1:13:45] under the ones that i hope i'm leading
[1:13:46] the christ
[1:13:47] and by christ the bible is our ultimate
[1:13:51] let every man words be alive
[1:13:54] and they might be true no wait we talk
[1:13:55] about some of our church baptist
[1:13:56] churches but they're spending church
[1:13:57] jesus all right the first time the word
[1:14:00] church was used was when he said upon
[1:14:02] this rock i will build my church
[1:14:05] it was upon spiritual revelation of who
[1:14:08] of jesus christ
[1:14:10] not on some men
[1:14:12] not of some group it's the revelation of
[1:14:15] jesus christ
[1:14:16] [Applause]
[1:14:19] bringing us into the knowledge of the
[1:14:20] son of god
[1:14:22] yes you know jesus pushed money
[1:14:25] hallelujah
[1:14:30] if you want to read it and record the
[1:14:32] scripture
[1:14:32] revelation one one two three the bible
[1:14:34] is the revelation of jesus christ
[1:14:37] now we come down to something the bible
[1:14:39] is what
[1:14:41] the bible is what
[1:14:43] so the bible is not just a history book
[1:14:45] a book of laws and ethics and behavior
[1:14:47] and whatever these are people not even
[1:14:49] christians are being very nice
[1:14:51] nice behave respectful humble and
[1:14:52] witness
[1:14:54] praise god but the bible is the
[1:14:56] revelation
[1:14:57] of jesus christ
[1:14:59] not on some group not some bishop not
[1:15:01] some pope a revelation of jesus christ
[1:15:05] isn't that right
[1:15:06] so the bible is the complete revelation
[1:15:09] of jesus christ wrote by the prophets
[1:15:11] elijah all that they were in him all
[1:15:14] that you are all that i am is in him
[1:15:17] words
[1:15:18] witnesses of the word so it's not a book
[1:15:20] of systems
[1:15:22] moral ethics neither is it a history
[1:15:24] book or book or theology it is not
[1:15:26] it's the revelation of jesus christ god
[1:15:28] himself revealed from word
[1:15:30] to flesh
[1:15:32] that's why i said and the word
[1:15:34] became flesh
[1:15:35] and dwelt among us
[1:15:37] this thought this word this expression
[1:15:40] actually become flesh that we could
[1:15:42] handle it
[1:15:44] because he touched me who touched me the
[1:15:46] word
[1:15:47] made flesh
[1:15:49] oh hallelujah isn't that right
[1:15:51] god
[1:15:52] here we go
[1:15:53] god himself
[1:15:55] revealed
[1:15:56] from word to flesh that's what it is the
[1:15:59] bible is the word and god is the flesh
[1:16:02] and the god is the word rather and jesus
[1:16:04] being the flesh is the revelation
[1:16:07] how god was manifested in human flesh
[1:16:09] and revealed to us and why he became the
[1:16:11] son of god he's part of god the body is
[1:16:14] part of the son isn't that right so
[1:16:16] let's go to the history it was written
[1:16:18] by 40 different writers 40 men wrote the
[1:16:20] bible over a space of 600 years apart at
[1:16:23] different times predicting the most
[1:16:24] important events that ever happened in
[1:16:26] world history
[1:16:27] and no author but himself watch and
[1:16:29] there is not one error in the entire 66
[1:16:32] books
[1:16:33] no order but god himself could be so
[1:16:34] accurate
[1:16:36] not one word contradicts the other
[1:16:39] these men wasn't the same age some most
[1:16:41] times and they have not contradicted
[1:16:43] each other that's the book we have
[1:16:45] called the bible
[1:16:47] going to find out that it's god in print
[1:16:48] form
[1:16:50] that book is god in print
[1:16:52] god
[1:16:53] in print
[1:16:55] devil hates that book and in that book
[1:16:57] two books he especially hate genesis in
[1:16:59] revelation because genesis is his
[1:17:01] beginning
[1:17:02] and revelation is his ending
[1:17:04] oh hallelujah praise the name of the
[1:17:06] lord
[1:17:07] praise gosh abraham says now watch watch
[1:17:10] luther was the feet
[1:17:12] pentecostal the tongues lips
[1:17:14] no is the eyes prophetic
[1:17:16] look at that
[1:17:17] luther was feet pentecostal was known by
[1:17:20] what speaking in tongues
[1:17:22] and then after the tongues is what the
[1:17:24] eyes
[1:17:25] that's prophetic
[1:17:26] malachi 4. now watch there is nothing
[1:17:28] else left here to come but himself to
[1:17:31] step into that the next is the
[1:17:33] intelligence
[1:17:35] so after the i
[1:17:36] is intelligence and we have no
[1:17:38] intelligence of our own we have no sight
[1:17:40] of our own he says then is the complete
[1:17:43] body of christ being revealed in the
[1:17:45] form of a bride
[1:17:46] that's taken out of his sign so when god
[1:17:49] was saying i'll restore he was restoring
[1:17:51] the bright body
[1:17:52] that christ would come and connect with
[1:17:54] it as the head
[1:17:55] that is the invisible union of the bride
[1:17:59] connecting to christ
[1:18:01] then you're going to see the visible
[1:18:02] union of the bride but you have to be an
[1:18:05] invisible union where you connected to
[1:18:07] god by the holy ghost
[1:18:09] hallelujah nobody in the world know
[1:18:12] where you're at because you are in the
[1:18:14] body
[1:18:15] you are not even in trinidad
[1:18:17] amen you're not capsule all by yourself
[1:18:20] you're in a body the body of christ so
[1:18:23] you walking but you're in a different
[1:18:24] world
[1:18:28] hallelujah
[1:18:29] and that's how jesus communicated when
[1:18:31] herod said you know i could do something
[1:18:32] for you he said no no no
[1:18:34] if my kingdom was in this world i could
[1:18:36] send for help i could call angels to
[1:18:37] help me you you can't help me this you
[1:18:40] don't even know what going on inside of
[1:18:41] here my father put you there amen
[1:18:43] hallelujah the picture was bigger than
[1:18:45] that you know was jesus in a different
[1:18:47] room altogether you see the problem is
[1:18:49] we are living in past present future and
[1:18:52] god altered that you can remember the
[1:18:54] past you're in the present you could
[1:18:55] think about the future we're going to
[1:18:56] happen and you're worried and it can
[1:18:57] soon and your heart stress out and
[1:18:59] whatnot but god is above all of that
[1:19:01] your past presence and future is present
[1:19:03] to him
[1:19:07] to him there's no past presence and
[1:19:09] future that's why he could declare the
[1:19:10] end from the beginning you have to wait
[1:19:12] for the end he could come at the
[1:19:12] beginning and declare your end
[1:19:15] come on now
[1:19:16] he's seen it straight
[1:19:18] [Applause]
[1:19:20] you worried about next week and he
[1:19:22] already know what next week
[1:19:25] amen if i could go up in the realm and
[1:19:27] go next week and bring it back for you
[1:19:28] you will see what god see already for
[1:19:30] you

[1:19:43] before we know all things work together

[1:19:52] purpose

[1:31:45] the bible
[1:31:47] the word of god
[1:31:49] is god in print form
[1:31:52] because no man is better than his word
[1:31:54] he is no one on his word and if you take
[1:31:57] my word for anything then don't have no
[1:31:59] dealer with me because you can't believe
[1:32:00] me that's the same thing
[1:32:02] and i believe this bible is the word
[1:32:04] the bible is god in print form
[1:32:07] and i believe the bible is a seed and
[1:32:09] those words are seeds
[1:32:11] and it is god in print form and you
[1:32:14] receive it into your heart
[1:32:16] and david said thy word have i hid in my
[1:32:19] heart that i might not sin against thee
[1:32:22] you could take the word and hide it and
[1:32:24] the devil can't touch it because the
[1:32:26] word is a designer of the thoughts and
[1:32:29] intents of the heart the devil cannot
[1:32:31] discern your heart
[1:32:33] he can mess with your head but he can't
[1:32:36] mess with your heart
[1:32:42] [Applause]
[1:32:45] see when you have it in your heart
[1:32:47] the devil can't get it
[1:32:49] you're under cover
[1:32:50] you're like a secret agent inside of
[1:32:52] there
[1:32:55] oh hallelujah thy word
[1:32:57] is in thy heart and it's in thy mouth
[1:33:01] oh a word of power a word a blessing a
[1:33:03] word of peace inside your heart that's
[1:33:05] why you ought to be careful what you see
[1:33:08] it was so powerful that jesus said if
[1:33:10] you shall say to this mountain and be
[1:33:12] move and don't talk in your heart you
[1:33:15] could have what you say
[1:33:16] sons of god walking with such a powerful
[1:33:19] word that if they speak it it could
[1:33:22] materialize if it comes from their heart
[1:33:25] anything you ask in my name i will do it
[1:33:29] that the father may be glorified in the
[1:33:31] sun
[1:33:32] we are coming into that sin john 14 20
[1:33:35] at that that you shall know i am in the
[1:33:38] father you and me and i and you we're
[1:33:40] talking about as my father sent me so
[1:33:43] send are you and the father was in him
[1:33:46] to minister to the people and to reveal
[1:33:49] himself
[1:33:50] through christ
[1:33:52] [Applause]
[1:33:55] [Music]
[1:33:56] [Applause]
[1:33:58] that's why god called you to be a
[1:34:00] peculiar people
[1:34:02] strange people
[1:34:04] for his namesake
[1:34:06] when you cannot rejoice him
[1:34:08] as the elect of god

[1:45:54] the bible is a perfect book
[1:45:56] if it wasn't they never talk about david
[1:45:58] adultery they never talk about noah
[1:46:00] drinking they never talk about all the
[1:46:02] sins of the brothers in the bible
[1:46:04] because the bible is a perfect book
[1:46:06] it have truth in it
[1:46:08] if they all have sinned and come short
[1:46:11] of the glory not some but all
[1:46:14] there is none righteous no not one
[1:46:17] the bible teaches that
[1:46:19] so we are all free this morning
[1:46:31] i can't finish this today it's too much
[1:46:32] i'm going to come out
[1:46:34] hallelujah
[1:46:39] [Music]
[1:46:53] to the smartest theologian
[1:46:55] he could hide himself set right there in
[1:46:58] the scripture and you can look all day
[1:46:59] long and never see it
[1:47:01] look for a lifetime and never see it he
[1:47:04] can hide himself there
[1:47:07] god in the world
[1:47:09] can find himself showing the word
[1:47:12] that there's not a theologian in the
[1:47:13] school could find him
[1:47:15] yet he is sitting right there
[1:47:17] you say is that right brother branham
[1:47:19] how about the pharah season style you
[1:47:20] see how about every age he's done it
[1:47:22] he's done it in every age noah smart
[1:47:24] intellectual age how he hid himself in
[1:47:26] his promised word did his moses heal
[1:47:29] himself and does elijah hid himself he
[1:47:31] said he came on his own he's going to
[1:47:32] receive him not so walker sit in his
[1:47:34] word waiting for the believer
[1:47:37] to open it
[1:47:39] waiting for the believer to to reveal it
[1:47:41] to him
[1:47:43] if you don't go oh he can reveal himself
[1:47:44] to you when god waiting for you to park
[1:47:46] the bible
[1:47:48] practice spoken word book begin to get
[1:47:50] into it and study and pray and the words
[1:47:52] of the jump up whoa then it brings
[1:47:54] stimulation of revelation then that
[1:47:56] brings prevailing power upon your life
[1:47:58] so all is weak and you're struggling and
[1:47:59] you do not make it all of a sudden you
[1:48:01] get prevailing power because god began
[1:48:04] to reveal himself to you right out of
[1:48:06] the world
[1:48:08] because you're showing you have a
[1:48:09] passion to know the word of god you're
[1:48:11] interested in the will of god you want
[1:48:14] to be about your father's business you
[1:48:15] don't just want to be hanging in church
[1:48:17] you want that breakthrough
[1:48:22] he hides himself from the smartest
[1:48:25] you say well this is dr father's holy so
[1:48:27] and so i don't care who he is
[1:48:29] god hides himself from him and revealed
[1:48:32] a babe starters will learn
[1:48:34] the babies of god is predestinated seed
[1:48:36] so think think
[1:48:38] the mighty god setting in his own word
[1:48:41] blinding the smart educated people of
[1:48:43] this present age
[1:48:45] and they think is a bunch of fanaticism
[1:48:47] and look at him there standing hiding
[1:48:49] the pentecostal baptist matter this
[1:48:51] reveal himself publication all kind of
[1:48:53] signs and so forth you said brother
[1:48:55] jones brother so and so he's a great man
[1:48:57] he will see it oh no
[1:48:58] he revealed to whomsoever
[1:49:01] he will or this brother yes in the
[1:49:03] message he all in the message
[1:49:06] but sometimes the old one does get like
[1:49:08] that guy with samuel day
[1:49:10] dim sighted ending
[1:49:13] not seeing right
[1:49:14] somebody is red blind
[1:49:16] they're so long they get blind
[1:49:17] they say oh they get numb they get kind
[1:49:19] of
[1:49:20] you know all right kind of dirty kind of
[1:49:23] old
[1:49:24] where they don't know what they're
[1:49:25] supposed to know
[1:49:26] but god revealed it to whom severe will
[1:49:28] so you can't say guacare to that sister
[1:49:30] or that brother you can't say quack this
[1:49:32] one because this happened no no to
[1:49:34] whomsoever
[1:49:35] he will
[1:49:36] oh musician come on please i think i
[1:49:38] know have up here
[1:49:40] god is known by simplicity and of
[1:49:42] revelation of jesus christ
[1:49:44] to the most illiterate person
[1:49:47] not your theology
[1:49:48] it's a revelation of jesus christ
[1:49:51] upon this rock i've been my church no
[1:49:53] other rocks accepted no other things
[1:49:56] accepted no other roman rock nor the
[1:49:58] protestant rock nor the school nor than
[1:49:59] nothing but exactly the revelation of
[1:50:02] jesus christ through the new birth
[1:50:05] he is born in there
[1:50:06] and he injects his own life and your
[1:50:08] life is gone and the life of christ is
[1:50:11] projecting itself through you
[1:50:14] showing the preeminences to the people
[1:50:17] and the prophet said this
[1:50:18] the ministry
[1:50:20] comes to perfection
[1:50:22] when christ is manifested in nature
[1:50:28] we're not talking about a sermon
[1:50:30] we're not talking about what you could
[1:50:31] write down as a note
[1:50:33] we're not talking about what you're
[1:50:34] saying never see it that way we're not
[1:50:36] talking about that we're talking about
[1:50:37] christ
[1:50:39] is reproduced
[1:50:40] in natural
[1:50:43] that means the word amen has become
[1:50:45] flesh
[1:50:47] by lack of this revelation of what of
[1:50:49] jesus christ is why we have so much
[1:50:51] different divisions
[1:50:55] not revelations causing divisions
[1:50:58] but the lack of revelation is why we
[1:51:01] have so many different divisions among
[1:51:02] us so much mockery so much division is
[1:51:05] because the people lack that revelation
[1:51:08] they lack the revelation the teachers
[1:51:11] who like it
[1:51:13] the teachers
[1:51:14] lack the revelation because if the
[1:51:16] teachers had the revelation they will
[1:51:18] point the people to jesus christ
[1:51:21] and not to themselves or their groups or
[1:51:24] their church
[1:51:25] hallelujah that's why so bless the
[1:51:27] preacher in india the savinity of the
[1:51:29] local church
[1:51:31] timothy 3 16 all scripture is given by
[1:51:34] inspiration
[1:51:36] of god
[1:51:37] and is profitable for doctrine reproof
[1:51:40] correction and instruction and
[1:51:41] righteousness that the man of god may
[1:51:43] stand perfect
[1:51:45] thoroughly furnished in our good works
[1:51:46] amen all scripture is given by
[1:51:49] inspiration
[1:51:51] god is a person amen
[1:51:53] are you ready yes yes god can speak
[1:51:57] god can talk
[1:51:59] god can write amen god wrote with his
[1:52:01] finger the ten commandments
[1:52:04] isn't that right god can talk he talked
[1:52:06] to moses on the mount in a burning bush
[1:52:08] he talked to john in the form of a dove
[1:52:10] this is my beloved son whom i'm pleased
[1:52:11] to dwell in he spoke to jesus on
[1:52:14] transfiguration he spoke to jesus before
[1:52:16] whole multitude
[1:52:17] so watch he said on the writing that not
[1:52:20] one jot or tittle shall ever pass away
[1:52:22] until it's fulfilled
[1:52:23] until it's manifested
[1:52:25] then it'll come to pass
[1:52:27] now a title means a small mark
[1:52:30] in other words
[1:52:31] not one punctuation
[1:52:34] one expression
[1:52:36] shall ever fail in the word of god
[1:52:38] because it's god
[1:52:42] god manifested in the form of human
[1:52:45] flesh
[1:52:46] they only interpret the prophets
[1:52:49] as god would permit them to interpret
[1:52:52] amen and if you want first peter 20 this
[1:52:55] is of no private interpretation
[1:52:57] so nobody not supposed to say i think it
[1:52:59] mean this
[1:53:00] the prophets alone have the
[1:53:02] qualification to interpret the word
[1:53:05] not a pastor
[1:53:07] not a preacher the prophet
[1:53:09] alone
[1:53:10] has the authority to interpret the
[1:53:12] scripture
[1:53:14] the preachers have to come under the
[1:53:15] prophet
[1:53:16] and say what the prophet says because
[1:53:18] the prophet spoke for god
[1:53:20] [Applause]
[1:53:22] so the man of god the prophet gets the
[1:53:24] thoughts of god speak the word of god
[1:53:27] for the entire age so if he is the toast
[1:53:30] he is that word is for the thousand
[1:53:32] years
[1:53:33] the prophet may die whatever times he
[1:53:35] died but the word still remains
[1:53:37] so the bible said version 10 7 in the
[1:53:39] days of the voice
[1:53:41] but abram is not here but the voice is
[1:53:43] still here
[1:53:45] we are still living in the tales of the
[1:53:47] voice
[1:53:48] it's the voice of god in the last days
[1:53:50] but the pride will be the voice of god
[1:53:53] but the prophet and the pride in the
[1:53:54] spirit will be saying the same thing
[1:53:57] and what they say has already been said
[1:53:59] in the word
[1:54:00] so there is no mistake about it there is
[1:54:03] no argument with it god word can't lie
[1:54:06] if god said he will heal you he will
[1:54:07] heal you
[1:54:08] if god said he will fill you he will
[1:54:10] fill you
[1:54:11] don't do like sarah and slightly don't
[1:54:14] believe god with all your heart
[1:54:16] oh hallelujah
[1:54:18] go glory to god
[1:54:20] just a little more prophets did not
[1:54:22] always understand what they were writing
[1:54:24] or what they were saying or they would
[1:54:26] know wise i've said it
[1:54:28] they couldn't they could understand it
[1:54:30] they were moved by the holy ghost
[1:54:32] moved by the holy ghost
[1:54:34] holy men moved by the holy ghost so when
[1:54:37] isaiah said a verse you shall conceive
[1:54:39] if he was thinking the truth he never
[1:54:40] write it because that's impossible but
[1:54:43] he had to write it
[1:54:44] hallelujah because court said it
[1:54:46] in other words
[1:54:48] once god speak it it's got to come to
[1:54:51] pass there will be a revival in trinidad
[1:54:54] there will be a prize revival
[1:54:56] once there's a pride in trinidad there's
[1:54:58] a pride revival in trinidad and seven
[1:55:00] thunders will be the pride revival in
[1:55:02] trinidad and around the world god said
[1:55:04] so
[1:55:05] seven thousand faith god said so that's
[1:55:08] the pride revival god said soul you're
[1:55:10] gonna have dynamics in the mechanics god
[1:55:12] said so you'll get back your joy god
[1:55:15] said so
[1:55:16] they will get you inheritance god said
[1:55:18] so
[1:55:19] hallelujah hallelujah but you've got to
[1:55:22] know what god said yes
[1:55:25] hallelujah
[1:55:26] glory
[1:55:27] so the prophet writer
[1:55:29] the prophet writer
[1:55:31] must be constant foolish by the author
[1:55:33] he must live constantly in the presence
[1:55:35] of the altar to know what the book is
[1:55:37] going to be so these men were not
[1:55:39] intellectual men
[1:55:40] these are men that was inspired
[1:55:43] oh elijah he wasn't much to look at
[1:55:46] when he come down that dusty road but he
[1:55:48] had dust here the lord his bald head
[1:55:51] gleaming
[1:55:52] at midday noon but when he stood there
[1:55:54] and seen that even jew or rain will fall
[1:55:56] till i called for it my calling and
[1:55:59] prophet come people tremble because they
[1:56:01] know god was coming
[1:56:03] they know the word was coming they know
[1:56:05] thunder and lightning was coming because
[1:56:07] that was on the mountain and god said
[1:56:08] don't let the god speak let moses speak
[1:56:12] isn't that right of course i'm going to
[1:56:14] lose prophecy bring the word to them
[1:56:15] amen oh hallelujah and we have a 20th
[1:56:18] century prophet my god how would you
[1:56:21] like to live back there with elijah
[1:56:23] oh with jeremiah or with ezekiel and
[1:56:25] these men come out of nowhere stomp down
[1:56:28] into a village and prophesied
[1:56:33] god could write
[1:56:35] there was writing on the wall
[1:56:37] hallelujah time up thank you jesus amen
[1:56:40] you're found in a balance of wanting
[1:56:43] man rejoicing king clanging and drinking
[1:56:45] and whatnot and he didn't know it was
[1:56:47] finished
[1:56:48] oh hallelujah god could write
[1:56:51] god could speak amen that's right god is
[1:56:53] the word
[1:56:54] so god knows exactly what he said in his
[1:56:56] word he know exactly what could be in
[1:56:58] the last days you know the spirit of men
[1:57:00] and lusts of power he not agreed that
[1:57:03] gonna be the last days he know the
[1:57:04] authority listen we have this all along
[1:57:07] dictators naturally yeah precedent for
[1:57:09] life prime minister for life conquering
[1:57:12] people for years they can't conquer
[1:57:13] their servant country
[1:57:16] god will not allow that
[1:57:18] god took jesus the example seats and the
[1:57:20] first thing god did is the ceremony
[1:57:21] willingness
[1:57:22] not selling to get a banner and we even
[1:57:24] like the pope francis
[1:57:27] and everybody we even had pope francis
[1:57:28] no
[1:57:30] he went into the wilderness to become
[1:57:31] the devil amen then he went into the
[1:57:34] scriptures to find where it's written
[1:57:36] because he was the written son that was
[1:57:37] mary had a son come on it's written and
[1:57:40] then he begins his ministry looking to
[1:57:42] fulfill scripture and needs pastor
[1:57:44] samaria
[1:57:46] fulfill scripture his life was
[1:57:48] fulfilling scripture
[1:57:49] oh hallelujah
[1:57:51] so that's why the prophet had his mind
[1:57:53] set
[1:57:54] constantly in what god said not what man
[1:57:56] thought what the age taught what the
[1:57:57] church taught what the kingdom taught
[1:57:59] what god taught he only expressed god
[1:58:01] thoughts to words because our words are
[1:58:03] taught when he's expressed oh blessed be
[1:58:05] the name of the lord
[1:58:06] hallelujah praise god
[1:58:09] all other words i don't care where they
[1:58:11] are placed
[1:58:12] how who they come from what denomination
[1:58:14] they come from how smart the man is is
[1:58:16] to be absolutely ignored
[1:58:21] so we don't hear the pre-time magazine
[1:58:23] music magazine and what in newspaper
[1:58:25] we're not here for that we had to preach
[1:58:27] the word of god
[1:58:28] because paul said though we are an angel
[1:58:31] of heaven preach anything let him be a
[1:58:34] christ
[1:58:36] in other words listen to the prophet
[1:58:37] voice now
[1:58:38] if an angel come down from heaven
[1:58:41] a bright shining angel
[1:58:43] would stand he said boy that would be a
[1:58:45] bit for this day wounded a bright
[1:58:47] shining angel come here and stand and
[1:58:49] say things with conjuring wood you say
[1:58:51] satan get away from me
[1:58:56] only don't say it
[1:58:57] do you want to see the bright shining
[1:58:58] ninja
[1:58:58] [Music]
[1:59:07] i don't want your shiny news
[1:59:09] i just want to know what you say
[1:59:10] if he's sick and dread to the wood tell
[1:59:12] him go back where you come from
[1:59:14] get behind me satan because this message
[1:59:17] is on the word
[1:59:18] is that bright and shiny
[1:59:19] is the word
[1:59:21] are you with me
[1:59:22] okay so if he's a bishop whatever he is
[1:59:25] don't you never believe him if he
[1:59:27] doesn't speak exactly with the word with
[1:59:29] the bible watch him he will carry with
[1:59:31] the bible now he will carry to a certain
[1:59:33] place and then hook it right there and
[1:59:34] when the bible is saying something and
[1:59:36] he bypasses that watch him right there
[1:59:38] oh hallelujah praise his wonderful name
[1:59:42] oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:59:45] oh glory to god praise his holy name
[1:59:49] thank you lord jesus
[1:59:51] hallelujah give him from praise these
[1:59:52] people
[1:59:54] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:59:56] blessed be the name of the lord glory to
[1:59:59] god amen
[2:00:00] hallelujah probably how will we know the
[2:00:03] messiah
[2:00:05] the people that believe in him there's a
[2:00:06] feast of the trumpets unless they are
[2:00:08] constantly in the wood
[2:00:09] to know what he is
[2:00:11] so you can't just be going wrong with
