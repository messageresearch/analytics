[40:59] issue let's turn over to Ephesians about
[41:02] the sixth chapter Ephesians and looking
[41:04] here what Paul said about getting the
[41:06] church
[41:07] ready sixth chapter Ephesians beginning
[41:11] at
[41:12] the 14th verse of the sixth
[41:15] chapters stand therefore having your La
[41:19] GED about with
[41:21] truth having on the breastplate of
[41:25] righteousness your feet shot with the
[41:28] preparation of the gospel of peace and
[41:31] above all things take the shield of
[41:35] Faith where with you shall be able to
[41:38] quench the fiery Dart of the wicked and
[41:42] take the helmet of salvation and the
[41:44] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[41:47] God see Paul's dressing up a man for the
[41:50] battlefield for the March God and
[41:55] beginning
[41:57] delivering of Israel he said now you
[41:59] want to get ready for the March when you
[42:02] come the blood put on your
[42:05] shoes GT up your lawn get your staff in
[42:08] your hand and get ready for the
[42:12] call I like that a man now when he comes
[42:16] into Christ he gets his gospel shoes on
[42:20] just preach the gospel the helmet of
[42:22] salvation ons the breastplate of
[42:25] righteousness GS up these laes they
[42:28] usually in the old Soldiers when they
[42:30] put on those ornaments of War they had a
[42:34] big belt that buckled it together
[42:37] holding over their lawn these shields to
[42:39] keep the enemy Spears off what a real
[42:44] lesson that is to us and when the the LA
[42:47] begin to get weak hang down the shield
[42:51] that heighten up on the Val bring him up
[42:54] tight again what a perfect picture today
[42:56] when you begin to feel like you're
[42:57] slacking her the devil says is no use
[43:01] reach down and tighten up the Bell a
[43:03] little bit pull up the sword little
[43:05] tight in the hand go forward I like that
[43:08] be ready for the
[43:10] March every man walking under that blood
[43:15] that night was commanded to stay there
[43:17] not go out until the orders come to
[43:21] March and every man is born of the
[43:25] spirit of God comes into Christ has
[43:29] everlasting life puts on his shield his
[43:32] breastplate standing ready and forbidden
[43:35] to leave until orders to
[43:38] Mark oh isn't it marvelous aren't you
[43:41] glad you got it all harnessed up tonight
[43:43] youed
[43:44] cers used to have a song leader at the
[43:46] Tabernacle a theme song was to fight his
[43:49] own old Christian soldiers face to face
[43:52] in stery with armor gleaming color
[43:55] streaming the right and Wrongs engaged
[43:57] today the fight is on but be not weary
[44:00] be strong and in his might whole fast if
[44:03] God be far far we'll sing the Victor
[44:06] song At Last many of them old Saints has
[44:09] gone to the grave but one of these days
[44:11] Yonder in a new world when they come
[44:13] forth into the promised land the banner
[44:16] of the Cross will be over us and we'll
[44:18] sing the Victor song when we said at the
[44:21] wedding supper that night around the
[44:22] table that great table maybe 100,000
[44:25] miles long with the blood was F sitting
[44:28] around there I want to go down on the
[44:30] table and shake hands with every one of
[44:31] them amen just shouting you want to hear
[44:34] me shout wait till get over there watch
[44:37] me I ain't big enough yet for this first
[44:41] notice on the March now get ready we're
[44:44] going here's a sad picture before we get
[44:47] over to a regular lesson is found in the
[44:50] 38th verse there listen and amidst
[44:55] multitude went up with their flock that
[44:58] is where Israel made a mistake the
[45:01] supernatural had been done and
[45:03] unconverted people followed because of
[45:07] the supernatural finally got him into
[45:10] trouble and on down we not sh about the
[45:13] 42nd verse in the 43rd verse the Lord
[45:17] speaking to Moses said that no one but
[45:22] those who were
[45:24] sacrificed could eat the sacrifice
[45:26] brother but those who were
[45:28] circumcised no strangers no Outsiders no
[45:32] one should take it but those who are
[45:40] circumcised and what is this grace that
[45:43] we have today in this day beloved
[45:46] friends that when in the church
[45:49] everybody that belongs to the church
[45:52] takes communion and that's wrong only
[45:56] those who are
[45:58] redeemed that's all who are
[46:01] worthy Isaiah spoke and said the tables
[46:04] of the Lord would be full of
[46:07] vomits said who canot teach Doctrine
[46:10] them that are wean from the breath said
[46:13] precept must be up precept line up line
[46:16] here little and there little and hold
[46:17] fast to that one's
[46:20] good God speaking knowing that the day
[46:24] that we're living in that the church
[46:26] would be so politically till we let
[46:29] every s people come in long as they had
[46:32] their name on the church books they were
[46:33] members they taken communion and the
[46:36] Bible said he that eats and drinks it
[46:38] unworthy is guilty of the body and the
[46:40] blood of the
[46:43] Lord St John 13th chapter Jesus speaking
[46:48] 2 Corinthians 11 chapter Paul said years
[46:52] later that he that eats and drinks this
[46:54] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[46:58] and the blood of the Lord let a man
[47:01] examine himself he says before I'm
[47:03] quoting
[47:04] scripture that's right he that eats and
[47:07] drinks unworthy eats and drinks
[47:08] damnation to himself not Discerning the
[47:10] Lord's body and for this cause many are
[47:13] sick and weakly among you and many
[47:15] sleep be sure that you're standing right
[47:18] with God here it is in the shadow that
[47:22] no one but the circumcised no matter how
[47:26] work how much he helped the Jewish
[47:28] church he had to be a
[47:31] PR had to be a real circumcised
[47:36] believer before he could take the
[47:38] communion or he the Passover oh how far
[47:43] we got off the line
[47:45] today now let's go quickly then and God
[47:49] Dr in out tonight we're turning now to
[47:51] the 13th verse of the 14th chapter God
[47:54] gave him the pillar of fire to go before
[47:56] them I think they had a picture here
[47:58] tonight and I say it with reverence to
[48:01] my honest opinion while we're here in
[48:04] this group tonight I believe that is
[48:06] with us tonight the same Pillar of Fire
[48:09] that led the children of Israel is going
[48:11] for performing the same times and
[48:14] morning and any teacher here or scholar
[48:17] of the Bible knows that the angel that
[48:19] followed Israel and guided them to the
[48:21] promised land was the angel of the
[48:24] Covenant which was Jesus Christ and
[48:27] today Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[48:29] today and forever is falling before this
[48:32] group that you want to call Holy rulers
[48:34] if you want to are going
[48:37] on leading from Victory onto Victory
[48:42] praise Dro in them nations in them days
[48:44] they were despised and hated and
[48:47] rejected and turned down by the Nations
[48:49] and call
[48:51] everything so is it today with the True
[48:54] Believer
[48:56] you in your churches you know when you
[48:58] take a stand for Christ and speak for
[49:00] truth the whole church says look at him
[49:03] he's lost his mind he's gone
[49:07] crazy don't pay no attention to that
[49:09] call along you're all honored up now the

[54:34] day that's right but we preachers all
[54:39] know Divine Healing now let me see what
[54:43] what St Moody finny Knox Calvin some of
[54:46] them said about it they were all right
[54:47] in their days but we're moving on going
[54:51] forward we got something else Jesus said
[54:55] in the parable there are the stor when
[54:57] the store went forth and sold seeds and
[55:00] some the enemy come around sold some
[55:01] weeds in the wheat he said let them grow
[55:06] together you're always pointing how
[55:09] Wicked the world are getting but you

[55:49] blemish amen I'm so happy about that now
[55:55] if I am in that church Amen brother BR
[55:58] how do you get into it by letter no how
[56:02] do you get into it by
[56:04] birth borned into it I've been in the
[56:09] Brandon family it be 45 years the sixth
[56:11] day of this coming April and they never
[56:13] did ask me to join their family I was
[56:15] born to Brandon I'll always be a brand I
[56:20] find a Christian in Jesus Christ I'll be
[56:23] a Christian because God has ordained us
[56:26] so by election he called us to the grace
[56:31] of his own beloved Son we accepted him
[56:33] and got eternal life by one
[56:38] handshake by one membership by one
[56:43] letter by one Spirit we're all baptized
[56:48] into one body Jesus Christ and there
[56:52] become fellow citizens of of the Kingdom
[56:56] I was thinking today as I was away
[56:59] praying and how that this is the day
[57:04] that we're going to have to answer for
[57:07] I'm not going to have to answer for the
[57:08] generation that was before me or the
[57:11] generation that will be after me but in
[57:13] the Judgment I'm to stand with this
[57:16] generation now I said look at there a
[57:18] woman's picture on the sign beer
[57:21] drinking something other said she was
[57:23] breathless or something I said guess in
[57:25] life let's do all right there you are I
[57:29] said what a disgrace of all the
[57:31] preaching I said sometimes it seems that

[57:47] give a witness unto the resurrection and
[57:50] the power of Jesus Christ let them
[57:53] forsake it and turn their back Garf will

[1:05:30] after the blood and the atonement was

[1:06:28] of Christian Living because the Seminary
[1:06:31] ped out a few preachers and set them

[1:08:43] back by a strong East Wind all that
[1:08:48] night and made the sea a dry land and
[1:08:52] the waters were divided and the children
[1:08:54] of Israel went unto the midst of the sea
[1:08:58] upon the dry ground if you'll notice
[1:09:01] while the children of Israel who had
[1:09:04] come out of darkness and accepted the
[1:09:07] light when they got in trouble the light

[1:18:34] go I walk into a place up here in Ohio
[1:18:36] where I've been just about to pass my
[1:18:39] opinion of judgment I've been eating in
[1:18:41] a little junkard restaurant was having a
[1:18:43] great meeting I had to stay several
[1:18:44] miles out in the country at a little
[1:18:46] Motel I've been eating in a dunker
[1:18:48] restaurant nice lovely people and on
[1:18:50] Sunday they closed and went to church I
[1:18:52] had to go across an ordinary little
[1:18:54] common American place to eat my dinner
[1:18:56] when I walked into the door to my
[1:18:58] surprise there stood a state police with
[1:19:01] his arm around a girl playing the slot
[1:19:03] machine now gambling is illegal in
[1:19:06] Ohio and there a law man himself
[1:19:09] breaking the law and perhaps a man at my
[1:19:12] age perhaps married to the family
[1:19:14] somewhere with his arms around some
[1:19:16] young lady sitting there I look back
[1:19:18] across the restaurant some boys sitting
[1:19:21] back there drunking a young lady not
[1:19:23] acting morally at all I look sitting
[1:19:25] down to my right side here to a booth
[1:19:27] which I was ready to sit down there said
[1:19:29] an elderly lady somewhat around 58 60
[1:19:31] years old old as my mother setting there
[1:19:34] her skin all wrinkled up the little
[1:19:35] bitty clothes on all was turble and her
[1:19:38] toenails painted purple lips painted
[1:19:40] purple the horest looking s you ever
[1:19:43] seen her hair cut real short and Fram St
[1:19:45] like that and she was drinking that's
[1:19:47] the two men with her sitting there
[1:19:49] horribly looking drunk one of them
[1:19:51] laying across the place of the table and
[1:19:54] when they excused themselves and went
[1:19:57] out to the restroom I said there I
[1:19:59] thought oh God how can you stand it how
[1:20:03] can you look at such as that when even
[1:20:05] in my heart and I'm as bad as I am it's
[1:20:08] still I wonder of my little SAR and
[1:20:09] Rebecca have to raise up in such a
[1:20:11] generation to see that coming on Lord
[1:20:14] why don't you just wipe it off the face
[1:20:16] of the Earth why don't you just do it
[1:20:18] Lord I sat down there and just started
[1:20:20] weeping I saw evasion I saw as it was
[1:20:23] the world whirling around in the air and
[1:20:26] there stood a rainbow around that world
[1:20:29] and someone that was speaking to me said
[1:20:32] that's the blood of Jesus Christ around
[1:20:35] this world that keeps him from destroyed
[1:20:36] if God can see sand the day you eat
[1:20:38] there of that day you die every man
[1:20:41] under that blood there has is a free
[1:20:44] moral agent to take your choice but if
[1:20:46] you ever die and your soul sares beyond
[1:20:49] the mercy of that blood you're already
[1:20:51] judged before you get there there's
[1:20:53] nothing left for you then I seen myself
[1:20:56] I seen my Lord Jesus standing there with
[1:20:58] a crown of thorns on his head and the
[1:21:00] tears running down mixed up with blood
[1:21:02] as it w washed off of his beard and I
[1:21:05] seen my sins coming before him and every
[1:21:07] time it would come before him like
[1:21:09] that shaking the pH scking his brow more
[1:21:13] his bagger back he say father forgive
[1:21:15] him he don't know what he's doing and
[1:21:17] again I would do something and then his
[1:21:19] blood was like the bumper on the car
[1:21:21] protecting the car a shielding me from
[1:21:24] the wrath of God
[1:21:26] undeserving I'll come to him slowly
[1:21:29] knelt down to him I said looked down and
[1:21:31] land from and there was an old book of
[1:21:32] sin in my name wrote across the top I
[1:21:35] said Lord will you forgive me certainly
[1:21:37] he said with loving eyes reached to his
[1:21:39] side got some blood out and rolled on it
[1:21:42] hardened he thr it back to see of
[1:21:44] forgetfulness he said now I said Thank
[1:21:46] You Lord he said now I forgive you and
[1:21:48] you're condemning her oh that changed
[1:21:51] the picture for me I come out of it I
[1:21:54] walk over there and sit down to her and
[1:21:56] begin to talk and she had some rough
[1:21:57] life back before I said was you never a
[1:21:59] Christian she said I was raised in a
[1:22:01] Christian home I said what happened she
[1:22:03] told me about him Mi you with her
[1:22:05] husband and how her children and so
