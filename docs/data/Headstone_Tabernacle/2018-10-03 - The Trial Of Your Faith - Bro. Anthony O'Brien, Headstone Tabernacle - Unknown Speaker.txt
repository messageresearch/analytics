chapter 1 I'm gonna read from verse 3 and it says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you amen harlot that's your promise tonight who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time where any greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be yeaay and heaviness through manifold temptations why that

of your trial right in the middle of your struggle right in the middle of you can't feel like you can make it courts gonna drop in some poly tonight give you some fate for a battle hate overcome is now right buddy Jason hallelujah hallelujah is now please go sit open tonight a man so my title is taken from this scripture a man I was quicken to me tonight and I just want to share it with you freeze gone in a way that would encourage your fate tonight my title is the trial of your faith a many many men the trial of your faith praise God is narrow and a trial of your faith and I love how the Bible describes the trial of your faith amen and we talk about having a house or having something valuable we talk about having a big bank account some people have big aspirations but I love how the Bible emphasizes this trial of your faith being more precious and that of gold that perisheth Oh heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall never pass away what God tonight is going to establish in your heart in your life in your soul in your walk in your talk what image God is forming in you tonight by the trial of your faith it's going to be more precious and anything in this world nothing in this world compares to the trial of your faith tonight or we're going to have a new appreciation we're gonna have a new love for the trials of our fates Oh hallelujah hallelujah we go through this and we go through that but tonight you're going to see how precious it is to be tried by car hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah it proves the nights that you are not just ordinary people but you are chosen people a royal seal a chosen hallelujah generation to shop for the praises of his glory the devil don't know who you are tonight but you're gonna step out from under that seventh seal oh honey Claire a new season an eclair a new time I declare a new tale you're gonna be like pizza when he stepped out under the tail a penny costs and set these people are not drunk as you suppose this what you're hearing this noise that you're hearing this worship that you're hearing but this is according to that that was spoken by the prophets oh there's gonna be another people a royal people a royal feed royal seed of Abraham they are here tonight you fought to death you fought to hell you fought to the grave you fought to all kinds of trials but we made it tonight Oh somebody shout somebody praise God we are modern overcomers tonight because of he that limited us it's greater than our trial greater than all chests greater than all circumstance greater than all situations greater than how you feel greater than how you came here tonight all God is greater oh god is more pause chorus Victoria somebody lift him up tonight [Applause] [Music] gives us a reason to be happy to come to service excited because we are not expectation for quarters about - - we've been me intro for night but Troy comment in the morning the trial is not forever but the trial is only to prove what is inside of you but a Panem said why would God choose a prize in this evil age it is to try to prove to the devil to prove to Satan to prove to Lucifer that you are not like Eve - are not be deceived but you're gonna step out right in this scientific age right in this age of lot easier with all the internet and with all the cellphones and with every distraction there is right in this last thing God's gonna call up people for his name's sake say man God's gonna call our young people for his name's sake they will be filled with the Holy Ghost they will do great wonders signs and wonders and miracles and the pillar I'll go before them hallelujah I believe tonight glory to God glory to God oh that's why we came that's probably excited that's why you're not expectation hallelujah because we have a more sure word of prophecy we're not just expecting a little blessing we not just expecting a little sprinkle but we have a promise I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams young men shall see visions it's specific it's appointed it's anointed it's a more sure word of prophecy tonight but uh Nicholas you're gonna be totally respawn halle-loo you're gonna be a young man again you're gonna dance and shout and jump higher and you jump before people even 11 tonight are you on fire tonight praise God he may for the trial of your feet be more precious than gold you put so much emphasis on natural things people put so much emphasis on temporary stuff but your blessing or rather your your calling is not based upon these natural things but it's peace upon the call of God in your life it's not a natural thing it's not a temporal thing here at Columbine it is dead but he that is spiritually minded that is life and peace Oh hallelujah and he that walks not after the flesh but after the spirit of God then they are the sons of God so I know who I'm talking to tonight because he didn't come here because of natural things but there's a spiritual call in your heart a spiritual call in your life a spiritual call in your soul jesus said my sheep hear my voice a stranger's voice they will not follow we know what voice called us when we were in the world we know what voice call us when we were past live when we had no face when we felt like giving up but there was a voice that was calling us up here calling us calling us into the heavenlies that proves that you are son of god because the pride has the ability tonight to hear from car certain Irina hear from a man but when we pick up this Bible oh there's a voice that calls us for Homer when you read the scripture when the scripture is anointed to us that's Courts points calling us home calling you out of your situation come on out out of your circumstance out of this natural plane into a spiritual plane follow your trial become like nothing your testings are like nothing when you begin to lift your hands and even get to worship your God you begin to enter into an atmosphere that makes all these little things paint away cause he comes on everything he is all all in all he's a reason why shouts he's the reason why I came to church tonight I came for reality I came for deliverance that's what I need oh is that what you need tonight oh it's not what you came for it's not what your faith is hauling on to Oh your feet must rest on God's solid promise with a many man glory to God the trial of your feet it's not precious I can't get off that scripture of gold that perisheth and then are we going to talk about that goal seeing that do it be tried and fire it will be found unto praise and honor and the glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ Oh hallelujah hallelujah we behold him we become all like him hallelujah we behold in a glass the glory of the Lord we are being changed into that same image from glory to glory to glory even as by the Spirit of the law it is not man doing the work but every day you walk with God you get closer to God and he comes closer to you you're supposed to get into his image into his likeness become a resemble God begin to talk like God and the more of the world you give up but I Branham said that button of light that comes into your heart must expand and as you pull out the world something inside of you is pressing something inside of you is getting bigger it's getting bigger it's getting bigger you begin to push the world out come on we're gonna push hallelujah the delegates have out we're gonna push the demons out push out everything that's not like God and you begin to change and transform and transfigure why because the sea has the power to transform itself into whatever it's supposed to be so if it's a sea praise god of discrepancy it's gonna come to life in its own way but if it's a seed of God you better believe tonight that it's going to find its way home it's going to produce something something that looks just like its father and tonight if we be seeds of call predestinated by God and what are you going to produce you will produce the same life the same size the same wonders the same miracles the same things that Jesus said when he heal the sick you're gonna heal the sick too because as attributes was locked up in the seed it's gonna come to life [Music] Oh hallelujah those attributes come to life but it doesn't just happen overnight it's a process and that's what we want to talk about tonight the process that takes you from point A to point P is now we know that God has a desire and an expected end for us harlot is not Harlan is not when God foreknew you in his mind he had an image of what you are going to be when you come to your fullness when you come to your fruit when you come to your maturity when that seed and you go to taking on life and go to bearing fruits God has an actual picture of what that's supposed to look like and the devil always try to present his picture his picture is what you look like now what you feel like now what you're going through now what frustrates you now what easily besets you now but that will only is not that will not always be because that is not God's picture of you when God saw you in the beginning that picture of you was perfect that picture of you was seven perfect spirits God manifested himself right in your simplicity right in your humility God's gonna find a nesting ground in your heart in your soul in your life God's gonna go to school with you he's gonna go to work with you he's gonna go under chop with you and he's gonna live out the things that you used to do you won't do them no more because it will be caught working his way out out of your heart into your life oh that's what we want tonight for the world to see Jesus in us the eleventh anang trial ever feet so what's a trial a trial is a test somebody say test it's 5% somebody said test a trial is a test of the performance the qualities or the suitability of someone or something so before God could ever put somebody in power or before God could anoint somebody with power like he wants to he's got to first test that person test them on their performance oh he's got to test them on their qualities to see if they fit the description of the right kind of a son oh you're not hearing me tonight God has to test he has to put that person on trial to see if they really got what it takes to go all the way and you better believe tonight that the devil's caught some of you on a test to see if you really are who you say you are Oh hallelujah prey is allowed to ruin things and to turn things upside down to try to get you out of the atmosphere to try to stop you from calling the church tonight to try to stop you from being a Christian from trying to stop you from holding on but the devil is a liar tonight because greater is he that is inside of you tonight right you sitting right here right now greater is he not heat and it's in the world Oh hallelujah greater is He that's trying to stop you great is he just trying to pull you down I like the word pulling this way in that play but Paul's force pulls you up put how many wanna go up tonight how many wanna call tonight [Applause] pulls you up one pulls you taking you higher higher than you've ever been David's had knowledge so high for me I cannot attain unto it hallelujah couldn't do it in himself it would take car to put you up there it would take car to put you up in those virtues it would take car to put you up in that pyramid hallelujah I'll not you to in the chosen wasn't you to in the placing you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain not only are you gonna bring forth fruit oh you're not hearing me tonight God promised over your life obey what you see is like a dead life or what feels like a nun food for life what promise God's Word what he breeds over your souls are not what we are speaking from this word is a promise of life is a promise of help it's a promise of restoration it's a promise of strength Oh hallelujah ask what you will tonight if you want stretch speak to the Ratana if you want to liver and speak to a rock tonight that rock is here tonight Oh [Music] halleluyah halleluyah it's a test of performance it's a test of the quality and it's a test us of the suitability of the individual or whatever it is that is being tested so before you could qualify hallelujah for this race you gotta be tested oh honey you gotta be proven you're gonna be tried by God hallelujah not by man hallelujah we're not talking about the trials we give ourselves now that's a different kind of trial I'm talking about a trial because you didn't pay a bill that's you not paying your bill that's not what I'm talking about ma I'm talking about when he said he could turn the church against you I'm talking about what a prophet said when he turned your neighbor against you he do this and he do that hallelujah threw him in a bed of sickness that's the kind of trial I'm talking about I'm talking about a trial and you're wearing when you feel like hope is gone and you can't feel anything you feel like you can't feel the anointing it's not right the Prophet went through those types of trials he went five years without the anointing lost his daughter lost his wife and God tried him this wing tried him back way is now you tried to reach up to a drop down you wanna hear nothing and still have to go on he was still God's prophet he was still God's Son he was still God's chosen one it didn't change that the dark skies are not a sign of course approval Oh somebody say man now hallelujah you're topless is not a sign of God's approval neither is a pride sighs skies a sign of his acceptance but his acceptance is when you accept you in the beloved when you are placed positionally in the party and you know who you are and who you are then you could go into the illness with confidence you could go into the desert with confidence knowing that if he is with me and if he is leading me I will need to be wearing neither will I faint at the promise of God oh but he is keeping me come on now he is anointing me come on now Oh hallelujah is keeping me Alleluia in my tri spell in my weary times so that's what makes a difference between genuine Christianity and people who just come to church for a show for a charm of a baton or maybe just to shake hands or to make people think that well everything's okay with me it's more than just that this is what really proves you now when that tryna scums in when the tax cars pull over how do you know who your God is Oh hallelujah hallelu in the chest car when the trial come to you know who God is in the test you have to know him in the chest you have to know him in the trial in order to stand you've got to got something that's more than go in your soul something that's more precious what is it a fate that's tried by fire a feat that's more precious than that of gold what is it it's also a person or an experience a trial talking about it's a person I experience our situation a situation that tests a person's endurance or forbearance isn't that right hallelujah and God permit trials called permit situations to come always hallelujah to try what is in us to try what is inside of us it is not a God hates us it is not a god hallelujah doesn't want to hear from us but he wants to see what you're going to do it's like a child you can't hold a child's hand all the time there's got to be a time when you let go of the hand and see what they will do and in that moment they mate might feel like they need a hand but God wants you to be independent God wants you to walk surely knowing that he is with you and he will not leave you or forsake you but you've got to have confidence in your call of God in your life that you could walk hallelujah praise in Jesus name when nobody's looking when nobody's watching you can still pray come on hallelujah when you call to your family when you go to your loved one you could still be a Christian you can still be a son a daughter of God when you can still dress right when you can sell Christ when you can still live like a Christian right in the midst of the world that's when you are overcoming I can't here tonight oh I can't here tonight Oh somebody praise him tonight God want to prove something in us God want to show you what's inside of you but he can't do that in the cushy nest halle-loo that you first come up in Harley it's gone all the feathers under-fluff isn't that right talking about our eagle's nest hallelujah and the chicks grew up in there and it's all pampered and it's warm and it's nice and mother brings all of the Eckler their wombs for us to eat and we feel so good inside and God is feeding us and we're fat and sassy it's not right but it comes to time and go out to pull out the feathers ha larry pulls out tunes and that's upside down hallelujah oh it sticks sometimes oh it hurts sometimes but God's trying to get you out of the cushiness into where he needs you too Pete you are not meant to stay in the nest you are meant to born and soar like an eagle you are born to soar like a bird in the sky so into the heavenlies straw into the eye of the strong fearless reckless and fate that is who you are tonight come on I can hear that is who you are tonight in the midst of the trial in the midst of the strong core put something inside of us to ensure the rugged times to ensure the pressure to ensure the pain but that is what makes you stronger that is what makes you more powerful that's what's going to raise you up hallelujah it's not gonna get easier brethren it's not gonna get easier brother it's not gonna get easier sister the world is going to travail the world is going in to put peens you better get next to yourself we have to press for revival we have to press only upon outpouring of the Holy Ghost it's not gonna come to you on a silver platter but every Sun every torture that cometh to God must be tested must be tried must be proved on oh but when they are born and positionally born then Carla sat in the church and God's gonna give you power then you're gonna get see the stick here you see the 10 rays you see the blind see you seen a quick walk Oh your family will come back or every son that is lost that is packs little pod will go after every one every one of your sons every one of your tortoise corn is gonna break the chain that affect us on Alpine in them don't you lose hope tonight Oh God's voice is able to go past the darkness and to find every predestinated sheep I don't care where they are tonight where they are in the world they would have called we'll find them don't would have got a little hump after this hole and bring everyone back whose name is found written in the book get the Lord a shout hallelujah I can't stop God when God is getting ready to move you can't stop God but God's getting ready to break when God get ready to sweep when caught get ready to flex and move holler the world trembles the mountain smells like wax before the Lord our God is looking for he's alright kind of people who are ready for this revival or and a minister can't bring the revival it takes a people in your home in your life in your situation whatever you bring the revival wanna know what your prayer which are anointing with the inspiration you bring the revival you bring the shouts you bring the offerings of praise into the house of our God holla you are the reason Jesus come he come to bless he come to see you Oh hallelujah well have no need of a physician but if you are sick too much he is your physician if you are broken tonight he is your healer if you are weary tonight he can fill you tonight if you are empty tonight he can satisfy the longing soul tonight [Applause] go hey man Bible said the sons of God came before God to worship God it's so came the devil you accuser of the Brethren got out to devil a question he say what are you doing these days what you up to devil said I'm walking to and fro 20 years now I reckon homes wrecking lands Bible said the devil is as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour how many countless lives has he wrecked has he broken and destroyed isn't that right that can't be the work of God God don't reckon destroy God come to mend a broken heart God come to hear praise God God come to take the broken pieces of your life what you feel could never be fixed what you feel could never be put together he is able the great master architect could find every minut piece that was lost radiation that was scattered the devil take this piece and throw it away and he laughs thinking that you could never find it thinking that you'll always be incomplete but he all-knowing God knows how to search the reigns of the heart to find a missing piece and to put you back together again Oh hallelujah hallelujah I wondered ever give up on you come on when the world give up on you when this one give up on you I went that one give up on you jesus never gave up on your soul that's why he left his home and glory to die for a sinner like me because he knew he had the power to put me back together again though I was broken though I was lost and undone without God or his son here eh somebody say reach you reach down his hand for me he reached out his hand for you when you couldn't speak for yourself he spoke for you and he said not guilty not guilty you stand forgiven the cross or how we ought to praise Him tonight we don't praise God enough for the blessing that we already caught you are all in a wrench on your praise and worship tonight so you better pay up tonight pay up tonight oh you didn't deserve it but he died for you he didn't deserve it but he shed his blood for you oh how we ought to praise Him and worship Him everyday every our devil said have you considered myself and Joe see him he's a blessed man he's a wonderful brother he shake my hand sometimes he don't know but he treat everybody the same hardly wonderful guy but I see how the header on him so I didn't really interfere with him because he got a protection barrier he got something keeping him in the midst of the trial something is keeping him blue a thousand fallen his left side ten thousand on his right he is not moved because he's got a hedge around him he's got a protection around him when you are God's child there's something special about you there's a special anointing that goes with you it's that same anointing that was with Caleb and he said it the Lord be with me I shall be able to try out the Philistines it's another spirit which you hallelujah that's overshadowing you that is protecting you that is keeping you from the table keeping you from all is harm from all his tricks you don't even know half of the things you escape but I was caught keeping you in your situation keeping you on the streets keeping you in the bank you almost got robbed you almost got killed you almost got the shrine but God mercy said no your blood was like a pumper pumping off the sin pumping off your failures bumping off your circumstance pumping off your situation pumping off things from affecting you [Music] it's okay to praise him it's okay to worship Him it's okay to bow down before his feet it's okay to thank him Oh in the good times giving thanks and the bad times to the sing oh devil said well you got a hedge God said fine I'll take away that hinge it's nice do anything you want you to him but don't take his life and I love that words because it means that a devil once he would have taken his life if he could have he would have taken his life if he had a chance then Joe would never have a testimony for God but God said to what you want try him this way try him that to him you could take his family take his loved ones take his money take his car take his house take his microwave but don't you take his life Oh hollow because in his life I will be proven in his life I'll be glorified right in his life hear what the people are gonna see poor boo they're called walking hard living Oh hallelujah louia hallelujah hey man what a job see though he slay me yet I trust him isn't that right Sam 105 19 says until that time that his wood came talking about Joseph it's not the word of the Lord tried him Oh hallelujah tried by what the word of the Lord the word that he had spoken to him since before he was not being tried by that very same word and God loves to set up the situation to make it look contrary to what he had spoken hallelujah and God who knows the end from the beginning Maps this whole thing out but where you are doesn't feel like what God said God said you're gonna be perfect God's ain't gonna be just like me he said you're gonna walk like me you're gonna talk like me the sick are gonna be here the dead are gonna be raised and your present situation may not heal like that but that has nothing to do with the word of God spoken it has nothing to do with the prophecy that has been spoken over your life Oh what God said concerning you Paul would perfect don't you worry tonight tonight take a hold of fate take a hold of God's promised word for your life Oh hallelujah God is able to bring to pass what he promised to bring to pass what he spoke hallelujah hallelujah but we know all things will work together for good to them that love God and to them who are called according to his purpose and if you know tonight that you are called not according to the purpose of man no forget about man forget about what people say but what did God say concerning your life Oh hallelujah what the cards say Oh hallelujah look to the promise of God forget about the world forget about the things of the world forget about what you feel but what it forget about what's going on oh it's not look to what God's promise were that's what faith is it's a substance of things hoped for and it's the evidence of things can't see that you can't see so faith is when you can't see it it's not based on the things you can see it's about the things you can't see so forget about what you see what about the things you can't see the Prophet Peter magical looking on to the unseen Oh Hannah is now right Oh hallelujah a little why Jesus said in the world will see me no more but you are gonna see me how can that be because God put something inside of your soul a reality a substance something that keeps you something that holds the reins despite the situation despite the trial despite what you're going through something inside your soul says so he slay me yet I trust him but I can't see a way out he doesn't give me more than I can bear Oh hallelujah he make a way of escape in every situation in every circumstance in every trial Maryna quote here from the Prophet I won't be longer with you on a message how can I overcome he said now we're expected to be tested isn't that right I'll say that again now we're expected to be tested oh praise God in many many men what a difference honey not the test is not a surprise but you got to expect it because your son of God you are special somebody your message Jesus Christ we can't just pass through here like praise God where nobody no no no the devil want to see if you like wheat but Jesus said I pray for you that your faith fail not or but the trial of your faith will produce a character will produce a bold that is more precious than gold that perishes but it's a spiritual goal oh it's a character the nature of Christ that gives you the ability to walk like Christ to talk like Christ to pray like Christ to forgive like Christ or hollow to achieve and to believe oh we expected to be tested he said that's a good lesson for my brother back there also say he that cometh to God must first be tested tested the Prophet said what with the word Oh that's God's test oh so we're not talking about self-made trials amen and the bad decisions that we make what we're talking about being tested by the word now holla the Holy Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil Oh hallelujah that's different hallelujah that's when God Himself that's when the Tov come down to lead the Eagles through the wilderness or to the low places through the valleys Ojai but though he slay me yeah now trust them it's not about what you feel but it's a wall of patronage it's not about what you're going through no no but it's a wall of patronage Oh hallelujah the God that set your destination up he's gonna take you to it from glory to glory to glory doesn't matter what condition your family is in darkness terrorize the prophets that live or wrong all a little sink or float is now right let this life that is in Christ live in me Oh hallelujah help me to pray it out season until every one of these virtues are living in me is my prayer is that your prayer tonight is that your testimony tonight or I to pray it out she said to praise without ceasing the price without ceasing until God is living in your heart living in your life living in your soul what we realize now is that we've gone beyond talk now we've gone beyond shaking hands and join in church you've got to have a genuine reality it's got to be something real in your soul something vibrating on the inside that's what the bull could understand that's what the bees could understand it's got to be a living reality oh don't you worry I'm almost closing it's got to be a living presence in your soul I'll live and walk I live in talk a real Jesus Christ moving in your heart moving in your life that's what making the difference hallelujah baby fine repeat between everything else between John and church and then paint adds all that is fine but a prophet said let us go on to perfection there is something that we have to achieve and coming to church as part of it but that is not it that is not it that is not the destination no no no no cause destination is that we could become sons and daughters of God that's what the finished product is supposed to look like so church is only a process come on now church is only a journey but that's not the destination God's purpose God's intent was for his word to be put inside of you so that you could walk like him so that you could look like him so that you could defeat the devil in your wilderness honor with any tree while attacks the city I sell to the flesh but you can still overcome it is written it is written it is written you overcoming in your home overcoming in your life overcoming in your walk overcoming in your prayer life you overcome in the devil every one of his tricks and pushing him back that's what it's all about that's what it's always been about sons and daughters of God so that's why he gives you the Holy Ghost and places you in there and you are predestinated of birth from above tonight to place you into the body of Christ that's not going to come from a man but that's gonna come from the Holy Spirit itself it's gonna place you as a son and as a daughter of God and tunicate your corner and into the family of God that's super holy spirit that pill of piety fight himself and coming to your heart and explode and change your walk change your talk change your life change your attitude change the way you walk change the way you talk change your approach and make you a creature of supernatural things and what is happening God give you another spirit now now now now you can overcome now we can take you into the trial first you're sealed is now plus you're sealed into the party of God by the Holy Spirit but from God hallelujah is not but then after that you're tested your tribe you're proven that's a pop some people don't like but tonight we are saying that that is more precious than coal a parachute that is precious tonight the Holy Ghost praise God Oh hallelujah hallelujah what to place you in there hallelujah he wants to be the outlet for the guy to take you all the way from faith to charity unfuck faith he takes you upward takes you up put the virtue I'll put the knowledge I'll put the temperance I'll put the patience I'll put the godliness I'll put the brotherly kindness Oh hallelujah what is happening you are being changed from this bottle into immortality the rapture is actually take in place in your soul in your walk in your life you are actually changing or somebody say man you are actually changing when that happens something inside your soul is changing Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah more like Jesus left like the world more like your father left like the world more like the pyramid less like the world oh no what a glorious transformation tonight oh how many want to be change tonight how many want to be transformed tonight transfigured into the image of God yeah yes a man predestinated the beginning isn't around oh my the word that's got God's test musician could come he said he believed it the congregation says he man he said he that cometh to God must be tested it's not oh I'll say it again see kakashi a man he said he that cometh to God must be tested that only shows a true child then see must be tested he said when the test comes on he said you can't overcome unless there's a test gave to you oh yes the only way for you to overcome for you to prove that you are who you say you are that you are who God says you are it's when the tests come it's when the trial comes oh hallelujah is when the pressure comes hallelujah honey when it when it seems like everything is pulling away holla but that's when God steps in that's when God shows up he's never late he's never early he is always on time unless there's a test gift to you now when a test is given is to see whether you can overcome or not and Jesus said to him that overcometh the test he said the tests here the Prophet said is the greatest thing that ever happened to you isn't that what we're seeing tonight a man oh my said I believe is written in the scripture Peter said there are trials are worth more to us than precious gold the Prophet said it's a testing time oh I feel that way tonight God's gonna prove you before this world you're gonna prove to the devil that you are not like Eve that you will not be deceived it'll play something softly that you won't power down to the world that you won't give up your fights or I'll that you won't give up on fates ohana but God hallelujah in you it's gonna overcome the trial God in you will overcome the tests will overcome every situation will overcome every valley or I'll bring you to the mountaintop for you to worship and praise your God he's the same God on the mountain tonight he's caught in the valley he's caught in your trial he is caught tonight he is God alone from before time began before there was a moon it was a star he was always caught so it doesn't matter what you feel doesn't matter what you go through he will always be caught tonight he is a part of every trial the god of every circumstance the core of every situation and though he slay me yet I'll trust him though he put me through this put me through that you're gonna say hallelujah anyhow a many man you feel away tonight it's a testing time a prophet said it's one good evidence to us that God is with us when we're tested what do you get out today for all children of God are
