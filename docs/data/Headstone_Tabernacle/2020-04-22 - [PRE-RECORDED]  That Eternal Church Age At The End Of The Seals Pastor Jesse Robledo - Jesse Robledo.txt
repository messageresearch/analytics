think I would say Ghana is far far away he men and just to be in Trinidad is a humbling experience to know that there's a people that love the Lord and to know that as the people that sacrifice for God's people amen to see better ovie making the trips to Ghana every now and then and to have to travel to training that is quite a humbling experience he will never say no to come in and this far far away from Ghana amen we started the journey on Sunday and arrived on Tuesday so that tells you how far it is ever but we are happy to be here [Music] Hania God is gracious to us I'm here with my wife sister Jane macchina and on behalf of her in the church we bring greetings to our precious brother ovate but eyes are round Tony and the the church and sister Ann Marie and to say we are happy to be amongst God's people remain she is just the love of God and that love found us now we couldn't find out long ago we're born in seen cut off from the love but Allah found us and I love me the way amen and so I have a scripture this morning to greet you that is taking from first John chapter 3 you don't have to get it it says behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us the store opponents this is a beautiful part that we should be called the sons of God came on therefore the world knoweth us not young people the world would knew you because you're not of the world because it annoyed him not beloved on the eighth day on the new day on the new beginning now are we the sons of God hallelujah if the devil has the lies you tell the devil now I am a son of God and now I am a total of home to go has bestowed his love over me hallelujah I have been arrested by the love of God I can't go to the right I can't go to the left I'm standing in the middle of the roof standing with the word standing without word in love you come hallelujah but the devil will tell you I know you're perfect look at you've made a mistake and it does not yet appear what we shall be Satan hallelujah I might have made a mistake yesterday it does not yet appear what I'm gonna be but in the back power goes mine I am perfect hallelujah I am standing there because it's a love panel over me and when divine love is projected brother whatever can stop you sovereign grace takes over I'm walking under the banner I'm walking under the Shekinah glory or the grace of the Living God hallelujah that's why when Paul understood this law Paul as the pressure what shall separate me from this law what so separately from this law shall tribulation shall cutting me off shall force anointed nothing present you passed nothing future will separate me from this love of God it is not my love it is not a poop laughs it is the love of God that chose me that found me that planted my feet on the rock to stay one

hooked up not by your real but by his real Oh blessed be the name of a living God hallelujah it does not get up here what we shall be but we shall be but we know that when he shall appear on the evening with the spirit of his spirit flesh of his flesh hallelujah a reflection of his very evening faith all the way to charity when he shall appear the headstone connects him with the body when he that love shall appear Oh blessed be the name of a living God there's going to be broadly kindness manifested when he shall appear the bridal was small Peter voice of God on the earth reflecting the seven spirits of God or when he shall appear when the headstone aligns with the body which shall be like him we shall be it is very image to be manifested great to be manifested knowledgeable

is not we shall see him as he is what are you love him this morning he made I'm about to leave this place amen but I just really could before I leave whether Brahm said they will you may be seated the way of a true prophet amen paragraph 207 is that when anything denies that word I'm against it Amen when anything the nice that word I am against it I believe you are against it that's why we are gathered here today on the world not on systems not on organization not on men's ideas but a promise that there shall be a bride what that is the word a promise that the seven thunders shall gather to cry together where there is the word hallelujah seven thunders we show the bride how to prepare well that is the word that is why we are here hallelujah are looking for a glorious time hallelujah

have already been blessed father and if I should do nothing more than read the scriptures Lord this morning father I enclose a Bible truly we can say we have already been blessed so father I pray that you bless your people in a special way father may the words that would be spoken flying good ground on in the hearts of the people we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ a you love him hallelujah amen you may be seated raise this wonderful name amen I have a saying that we speak at home god is good all the time and you reverse it all the time God is good hallelujah I don't know about you but he's been good to me he's been good to me hallelujah the Lord has tasted me sore but he has not given me unto death hallelujah and I am alive in Christ Jesus amen because he lives I live off soul praise this wonderful name amen hallelujah what a blessing to be among the believers here today and I am so privileged and so honored amen to be here especially the theme of this convention certainly it when I got the invitation and of course something just struck me and you know as a minister many things just kind of you could reach something and you've heard it many times before but something oh the word of the Lord and due season how good it is praise this wonderful name because we know the time that we are living in time has got to yield and give way to eternity we don't have much more time time as we know it a man will soon amen yield itself to eternity and for this reason I'm so happy that to be identified with this group amen and my good friend brother Theo Ovid we've been friends for many many years many years amen went out you know in the field in the earlier years and so forth and I one thing I love about our host pastor here he has no I don't sense no objective no motive no nothing just the motive is just to see just God's people blessed and I am very happy to put my shoulder to the wheel with men like that you see there are too many people that are building their own kingdoms here today hey man but we're not here to build kingdoms we're here to be witnesses amen you see the Holy Ghost was set to be a witness hallelujah without the Holy Ghost you cannot be a witness amen and I'm going to tell you something it's you shall be witnesses unto me and me is the word hallelujah not uh not an interpretation not a man's I did the Holy Ghost will always Amen the Word of God and you recognize it to be the word because a Holy Ghost in you has always got to Amen the Word of God hallelujah to the lamb a man so I'm just so happy to be part of this great gathering here this afternoon or rather this morning amen and I'm sure there are I just want to make something very clear you know because there is a great you know things that goes around that we you know people think they are exclusively bride or they are exclusively this is what you know their God you cannot contain God in this go [Applause] [Music] God is all over the world and I always say you know I remember there was a story that I used to read a genie you know you can't you can't stuff God in a genie bottle and release him when you want him no no no no no our God is a big God hallelujah he is from eternity to eternity praise God hallelujah and he has a pride everywhere hallelujah even if I recognize or know the minister I don't have to know the minister the minister has to know God and God has put in the church some apostles some teachers some evangelists hallelujah that's not the work of man that's a work of God yo repeat Oh God Amen hallelujah oh I feel good this morning hey man hallelujah so I have enjoyed every service and the ministers have testified and preached and surely my heart has been blessed I have no words you know you find try to look for the you know words in the dictionary to properly explain what is going on with the head this is this is unspeakable you can't speak joy unspeakable and full of glory amen so praise this wonderful name I'm so thankful him and I want to thank and take this moment to thank brother ovet for the invitation amen to coming to come back to Trinidad is always a blessing for me to come amen and to share my testimony and my testimony I love this message you know my heart that's my testimony I gave my heart to the Lord when I was 14 years old hey man I've been around the block a little but a few times and so this is my life I have nothing else you know if I would have found something better I would have gone with it amen so I'm 57 now so you can imagine you do the calculation how long I've been around so therefore I have seen many things and one thing that I do appreciate is the sincerity of real God called men their objective their motive is to do their best to get people back to the world back to the Word of God we have received a message in this endtime amen and we now have brother Graham said the perfect interpretation of the word with the line vindication he says a lot of people say that they have the word but you see that's all good but God is going to manifest and prove because the head part can only rest on a true body and that body has got to be the word amen and the head identifies the body as I have often said so you know there are many claims it's ok find it's not a problem I don't argue with no man well the brown said I argued with no man hey man you preach the word and you just go on and love everybody because you see the trial that we many times face today from you know if you don't know a person for example if they run you down it's not a problem you don't know them but it is those that really are your friends and your associates and things and then they that's the challenge you know that's the challenge and we have got to be mature enough and understand that these are trials to mold us and make us to be more like Jesus Christ a man is written in the scripture where did you get these stripes in the house of my enemies no friends hey amen so praise the Lord I'm so thankful for friends should I say that have helped me grow in Jesus Christ amen hallow every trial every tribulation listen to me right here right now nothing happens without God permitting it to happen and if God has permitted it praise God there must be a purpose for it that the purpose might be fulfilled and accomplished go ribbit Oh God you want to have faith and virtue and knowledge and temperance God cannot listen character is not a gift it is a victory you want virtue knowledge temperance patience God has special design trials for you hallelujah to give you the character of Jesus Christ praise God hallelujah hey man I'm so happy whoa blessed be his wonderful name and once again brother Ovid your family and the entire church I don't ever want to be little or or take lightly what has gone on behind the scenes because we realized that there's a lot of work that goes on behind the scenes and I want to say from the depths of my heart that I that I do appreciate amen all the labors of love behind the scenes and they brother Ovid I think you've got this down to a science you know I mean just a smooth check-in and the smooth is just so wonderful praise the lord god bless you and i appreciate men like brother Ovid and the family and the church here god bless you richly is my prayer you have made us very comfortable and welcomed amen so is is beyond my expectation and of course we say God richly bless you and if I would say this very quickly it is you know Paul said in Romans chapter 1 and verse 8 he said I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world your faith is spoken throughout the whole world amen so stay with it it may not be many remember Jesus Church wasn't many he had 70 and and those 70s couldn't really accept the Word of God amen and when he turned over to Peter will you go also a Peter had a man eternal life in him he had representation glory be to God he said where can I go I've gone everywhere where can I go so you alone have the words of eternal life and that's just the way I feel this message is correct praise God that's my testimony don't be to God I don't have to argue with nobody praise this wonderful name thank you brother Chandler amen representation by predestination hallelujah [Applause] my my you know if you don't have representation Amen and this day and age I doubt very much if you'll get too far you see because it's the grace of Almighty God it's nothing that we have done amen tell me what righteousness have you done to earn what you have here today absolutely nothing and I'm so thankful that you know we have not chosen God he has chosen us a man and we're not holding on to God he's holding on to us we don't have the strength to hold on to God glory be to God and I'm so thankful and that's why the scripture says all that the father has given me shall come and I will not lose not one for he's gone so brother Isaac also to last night possessing your individual inheritance and I was telling brother Isaac last night Damon what a wonderful masterpiece it was regarding Caleb now remember Caleb represents the believer you know amen so you know Joshua the Holy Spirit you know in tight but Kalyn he had his eyes on a mountain he had his eyes on something that was promised to him as an individual he didn't represent the tribe is an individual affair amen and today if you receive the Holy Ghost it's an individual experience who can't explain it to somebody else hallelujah amen is something that God has done for you personally amen hallelujah and it will speak for itself praise this wonderful name Amen and I like what the brother Isaac said you know in brotherly kindness he said the Brethren hey men that went with me a man he could have been on that mountain you know 40 plus years ago but the Brethren and we all know that the brethren brought an evil report hey man that's what the brother Bram says we have got to bring a good true report because Joshua and Caleb came back with the evidence the others did not they could only explain what they saw and what they felt and what you know but vision hallelujah revelation Moses described the land fluid milk and honey and they saw it and that was enough for them hallelujah and they came back with the evidence amen and we're now living by the evidence hallelujah of that new land hallelujah there is no way I can doubt it now praise God Amen Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever praise God is so food now amen this is so food this weekend God richly bless you amen and so our time is limited and we want to turn straight to the word and may we can we can stand to our feet now as we turn to the Word of God I trust that these few words would be a blessing to you amen and I want to under you to understand that as I said heaven and earth will pass away but my word will never pass away and if we just read a scripture today that in my opinion is enough I bring greetings from my wife I thank God for The Specials by the way and all the testimonies that went forth if I should forget somebody or whatever it's not intentional it's just our time is limited here and I just want to be obedient to I asked brother Ovid what I want to be in church order you know and back home I have a reputation of being well a little lengthy so I don't want to do that here hey men so but I do agree bring greetings from my wife a man she wanted to be here of course she is working last week she was off but this week she had to go to work and if I had worked out where the meetings were last week she would have been able to come but I do bring greetings from our little assembly in Valley Stream New York a man who as a group there that's waiting for the coming of the Lord a man you're waiting for the coming of the Lord amen hallelujah so god bless you in brother Solomon I had a chance to speak to him just briefly on the bus and I heard his testimony god bless you I I amen you see I listened but I also feel a person spirit in which I like I like brother Solomon name and God richly bless you and prosper your ministry where when you go back home you see the bride can no longer be deceived you know amen because a word is in the bride and the word that's in the bride has got to compare now what what is going on around in the world today amen and you see your womb is closed because you have received the seed amen of this message you can't receive anything else glory be to God hallelujah to the land I'm so thankful amen so quickly let us turn first of all let us I'm gonna give you my title the eternal church age at the end of the seals Amen that eternal church age at the end of the seals and so many have spoken about the eighth day and you know people's quotes are being taken I hear I see ministers going around and just like oh my God my my even my message is chopped up now but you know my message is chopped up but we'll see how the Lord God we can't exhaust God's blessing he always has something for us and a title as I said before I read a scripture that eternal church age at the end of the seals so let us read if we can I have two portions of Scripture Saint John 14 I'll be reading the first four verses and also revelations chapter 21 and I think it's it fits it's very fitting for the theme that has been announced and we want to just stay on that line and that theme brother John Oh had mentioned something in his testimony there's got to be a place prepared for the word to be made manifest we know that is a body a body has now prepared me so there is a preparation you see so let us let us start here verse one let not your heart be troubled ye believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you now listen I go to prepare a place for you you see Jesus when he was walking with man could not make this preparation because the Holy Spirit had not been released but he had to go but on a day of Pentecost on the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost poured out he began his preparation he began his preparation and we have to understand his house amen this preparation we're talking about is your tabernacle I go to prepare a place for you and if I go I love this and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also and whether I go ye know and the way ye know next scripture verse found in revelations chapter 21 and I trust that I can kind of bring this across in a way that it had come to me because we have to understand that the eighth day is coming but let us look at how is written in revelations chapter 21 in verse 1 now we know that we shall reign on the earth the earth as you know it today you're not going to come back to the same earth there's got to be done something done to this earth because then we're phasing into a new day now let's see what John's says here and I saw a new heaven oh no what happened to the old I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first earth and the first for the first heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the temple of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their father and God shall I love this man and God shall wipe away all the tears from their eyes and there shall be no death no sorrow no crying hey men neither shall there be any more pain for the former things under the seventh day and all the in a period of time hour passed away he man this is the new law of the new day you see he men and he that sat upon the throne behold said behold I make all things new and he said unto me write for these words are true and faithful for an he said unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end I will give unto I will give let me see if okay I and I will give unto him that is athirst amen of the fountain of water of life verse 7 he that overcometh shall inherit a man shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son may the Lord added blessing to the reading of his word let us just bow our heads in a word of Prayer our Heavenly Father Lord we have read your word dear God and I pray dear God that these words that would be spoken this morning Lord I pray that it would go forth and fall on good ground father we know that the Spirit of God always follows the word dear God and I pray that only you we know that can make it a hundredfold and bring it to pass the time has come Lord is not just to preach the word we want to see the word manifested in our hearts and our lives dear God so father I pray that you would bless each and every one though for the next few minutes I pray dear God that you would Lord may every see go forth and it find good ground in the hearts of the people we commit ourselves into your hands in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen you may be seated how many are happy let's give the Lord a hand to praise amen hallelujah glory glory glory amen hallelujah so excuse me a second I am using this this power PowerPoint and um it's just kind of not working for me a little bit but amen brother Branham said we have lived through seven Church ages and we all know that in every church age there were over comers every church age there were eighth day people hey man every Church age they were eighth day people that were predestinated to overcome in that age you take up all Irene is Martin Colombo and everything else it and down to this age and I hear sometimes so many people complain about the trials and tribulations and things that they they think that God made a mistake in putting you here listen I want to tell you something you're not a mistake there is no oops with God God doesn't make mistakes oh well you know amen he has over comers in every age hallelujah and if he has over comers in every age or something to overcome that's what makes you the believer the eighth day believer eternity hallelujah you come from God and you go back to God again and listen to me hallelujah you have representation as brother Peter Taylor said you see the believer that was in God before the foundation of the world amen he was spirit man way back in the beginning we see and he come to earth as spirit man we all know those things we all know these things but then God even you had to come in a in a place of time because eternity is like a circle you know we all know that brother Branham said that is a circle but when sin came in it put a hickey or a kink in this great circle hallelujah and God was determined to fix this circle it was sin that dropped out hallelujah amen to enter to try to interrupt the Eternity but God is from eternal eternity to eternity hallelujah glory be to God - God has overcomers in every age glory be to God amen and they are the ones at this time and this final age will receive a Sevenfold reward amen there's no overcoming for there for people who give up this is an overcoming amen there's no reward for people who who who just say I cannot make it anymore oh my my my my but listen amen I want you to understand now what brother Graham says here in the Seventh Seal now we all know that the seventh seal seventh under message has been unfolded and revealed by a prophet how many can say amen to that all right but now let's let's look at what the seventh seal amen we know that the seventh seal had a beginning and has an end how many to know that to be the truth the seventh seal has a beginning and it has an end brother Graham says in the seventh seal he said we must remember that the seventh seal is the end of time the end of all things is that right the things written in the seventh sealed book sealed up of the plan of redemption amen from before the foundation of the world amen it all it's every bit ends see it is an end it is an end to this struggling nature hey hallelujah it is an end to a struggling nature it is an end to everything it is an end to the trumpets it is an end to the vials it is an end to the earth a man thank God because God has a new earth and a new huh it's the end of the earth hallelujah amen see is it's it's the end of all things time runs out the Bible said so see revelations 10 of chapter 10 and verse 1 and through seven time runs out and the angel said there shall be time no longer amen and the days that these great things that are happening but now here is what needs to be understood now the Prophet revealed the Seventh Seal he revealed every mystery that's what I believe every mystery you don't have to say or you hear preachers say well you know somebody has got to come behind come behind who I don't understand what you're talking about because you're not talking my language now David I'm from I'm from the eighth day maybe I don't understand your language man glory be to God hey man the Prophet said hallelujah according to the revelations chapter 10 in the days of the voice when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God shall be finished glory be to God and I want to say this if you can receive it I want to say this jesus said of John now listen jesus said of John if you can receive it he was more than a prophet you mean to tell me there was Moses and Elijah there was all kinds there was Jeremiah there was all all prophets Rafi to Old Testament but Jesus himself testified amen any prophet therefore runs a coming of the Lord is more than a prophet glory be to God hallelujah what a commission what a Amen what a responsibility glory be to God amen but John listen John never said that of himself Jesus himself was testifying up John if you can receive it hey man hallelujah glory be to God amen glory hallelujah now I will say here today if you can receive it this messenger of Malachi for yes he was a prophet but he was more than a prophet [Applause] if you can receive it if you can speak 8th day language hallelujah more than a prophet praise God and you see throughout the internet they're criticizing there you know the Bible says there come a time where they will not be able to endure sound doctrine and to endure means to hold on to hallelujah which means at one time they had it but but you know time did you know no maybe I'm gonna let this go I am look I feel like Jacob today I'm not gonna let this go until you bless me no repeats are gone hey man listen either this is right or it is wrong you cannot sit in the fence you've got to make up your mind hallelujah your God will be my god when you're buried I will be buried hallelujah glory be to God hallelujah hey man hallelujah so brother Robledo if the Seventh Seal is the end of all things Amen why are why this and why this why we're still here why is nature still struggling why this I'm gonna show you hey my head brother branham oh he doesn't leave anything unturned you know huh hey hey man I like that he said he continues to say that the Seventh Seal is like a rocket we we just we just celebrated the 4th of July back in America and you know I was one night I was going to sleep and I hear boom boom boom boom boom boom boom and I would look out the window and brother there's all kinds of fireworks going on and you take one rocket goes up and boom it goes into 20 and 2 and the 20 goes into 40 and the 40 goes into 80 is still unfolding the seventh seal is still unfolding it will unfold to the coming of the Lord it is all fold a meant to the wedding supper I don't wanna fold amen to the new hallelujah hey man don't unfold hallelujah it's still unfolding it's not done yet God is not done with you Amen now let's see it just to prove this point when God takes you in a rapture Amen when God takes the bride to the rapture do you think that nature is gonna stop struggling no it's still under time hallelujah I hope you understand this now amen that's a the Seventh Seal it just ends a time see for the world it's the end of time time for this time for that see it ends the time for this the time for that is the ending of everything and everything ends at the Seventh Seal in other words time will be no more and the next thing is number eight because there's only seven days in a week amen and when you add one more its eternity glory beats our God remember that the Jubilee year was only you know seven Sabbath's but they had to be add one more year Gouri and that was a year of Jubilee glory be to God hey man and all I like what brother Isaac said oh you're taskmasters and all that made you do this and you have to do this and you have to do that oh this coming out trumpet walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk and only the believe it only the predestinated will be able to hear that trumpet go away be to God amen hallelujah I'm gonna tell you something there some people don't want to go free their comfort their comfort in what they are now their car look I I can never be satisfied with what I am now hey man I have no kingdom of my own aha I don't build any Kingdom Lord I want to see you look upon your face hey man dare to look a man to be forever and sing forever of your saving grace now let me tell you something another quote here statue of a perfect man then we'll get into preaching now we are approaching the Seventh Seal amen we just finished the seven church ages now this and people think I don't believe these things via rumors about this I mean look I've been around a long time ago and I know what I believe that I don't what I don't believe a man listen and this is a message on teaching that ties the ties them from seven to eight hallelujah amen glory be to God the ties a man in that's going to be redeemed by the blood of the Lord and is going to be in that church age hallelujah that eternal church age glory be to God Oh hallelujah at the end of the seals see hallelujah when the last when you get the rocket going up and it blows and blows and blow and you're wondering where's my family oh don't worry about it and one of those explosion there's your family amen hallelujah all don't worry and one of those exposures is a spoken word of God Amen house of hell give way to the name of the Living God amen don't think it's over it's just getting started amen you wait to the anointing strike the Church of the Living God hallelujah the word of God will be made manifest hey man and I'm gonna tell you something can I can I speak what's on my heart can I sleep what's on my heart can I speak goes on my heart don't worry be to God people don't know what the anointing is I'm gonna make it clear to you because I have scriptures and I have quotes and things Amen people fail to know what the anointing really is hallelujah brother Graham said that the greatest anointing that struck the earth was when Jesus walked into the temple he picked up the scrolls of Isaiah and he read the portion that pertained to him nobody was shouting nobody would you see people get confused with noise and think they have all that there is to have but the anointing or not listen please I'm not against shouting and glorify God I'm just making a point listen I want you to understand you can shout but at the end of the day you've got to understand that the anointing comes to make the word made flesh [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory be to God and he said the Spirit of the Lord is upon me amen he has anointed me hallelujah that preached to the poor and so forth amen glory be to God and he put the scroll away and brother Branham said oh you take these Pentecostals they would just love and run around that temple and shout and speak in tongues and everything else but that was the greatest anointing the anointing comes upon the word to make it live it is them the dynamics who are mechanics hallelujah and brother Bram says you wake to the anointing really strike this church amen I doubt very much if it's just gonna make us shout and glorify God although that is the after-effects Amen but we would rejoice because the word is becoming flesh hallelujah hallelujah amen glory a man listen so therefore without the statue of perfect man a man you will never make it you will never be able to be tied into that eternity change a man and I believe the thunders with all my heart you know why because brother Branham said it amen and I have to believe what he said hey man but you see here in brother Branham says in the seal of God he lived here once with us on earth in the form of a man God lived in his son Christ Jesus as the god man and he returned into glory leaving this world a little while in the world seeth me no more yet ye shall see me for I will be with you even in you to the end of the world now listen the person of the Holy Spirit returning in the form is that jesus said I come from God and I go back to God listen he said he came out of eternity eternity is number eight amen he wasn't in time God was eternal and he's still eternal but he had to drop into this kink that the devil caused and through sin but here is what's so beautiful about this amen you can be seated a moment amen I come from God and I go back to God he came from eternity and stepped down into time a man went out back and went went out of time back into eternity I love that so now when Adam sinned you see in the beginning God said the day that you eat thereof you shall die the day and to God a day is a thousand years we all know that and we read in the Bible that nobody lived a thousand years but who was looking close but he didn't but no God doesn't forget his promises you know he takes care of its promises don't worry about it amen because he created man here to be eternal in the beginning there was eternal hallelujah Adam was eternal Eve was eternal become from God and they got what we're supposed to go back to God but Eve let down the bars unbelief came in and they caused a kink amen and that is what broke fellowship between a man the early Adam and Eve and God but God had to fix that you know because he himself had to drop down into this little loop Oh hallelujah to make sure that he pushes it back up back into eternity and the reason for the thousand-year reign listen to me the reason for the thousand-year reign is to prove that God had paid the price of restoration somebody's gonna leave a thousand years go repeats ah God hallelujah at the wedding supper praise God Oh Satan will be bound a thousand years will have no tempter then Oh God takes care of his word Oh hallelujah lower these our God we would be rejoicing and of course the Great Tribulation is is taking place for three and a half years and Satan is bound and so forth but in this at the same time God Oh is preparing a place for you and I listen but it won't be the heavens that we know today it won't be the earth that we know today the earth that we know today has water has seas has trouble and so forth but Jesus what John was speaking about a new earth for the old things has passed away glory be to God you talk about Oh hallelujah amen see you can be seated if you can't a man and we live through all these types here but when you hit the eighth number eight see you go back to eternity you don't come from laws and rituals and orders as the brother already wrote a man or rather read you come by predestination hey men I'm going to say I'm gonna stop and say something here without predestination and God is not unfair you know he told Jeremiah before when you were in your mother's womb I knew you and I had ordained you to be a prophet to the nation's Jacob and Esau before they breed the single breath Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated hallelujah how can he do that because he knows his own God is not unfair and I'm gonna tell you the greatest revelation that any man any Christian can have today is their true revelation of predestination hallelujah to know that you come from God and you're going back to God again don't be to God hey man so let's take a story I've said this many times before the devil wanna he's the accuser you know he's the accuser there's nobody else named accuser outside of the devil he likes to accuse and there is is no redemption in accusation and to accuse he just wants to he's judge jury and he wants to just make you look bad but put you in the front paper and so forth that's an accuser you see but Jesus told the woman neither do I accuse you because his love was was a love of forgiveness and in her heart was a see she was in vain she was caught in adultery this is why I said don't we don't have the ability to judge any man any body we don't have the ability to judge any person the only reason God's judgments are true and they are pure and they are final is because he knows all things you present your case to a jury and all of you trying to get is some evidence evidence something DNA anything amen and sometimes you get a bunch of it and sometimes you get a little bit of it but then you go to court amen and it's the proof Amen that you present whether that case it is is a rule for you or against you Amen but God [Applause] [Music] God knows all things amen but God knows all things and that's how he could judge and this is why he before Jacob and Esau lived one day he knew he knew that hallelujah oh that a man Jacob would have respect unto the birthright hey man oh and everything that Jason that's the only thing he wanted amen was that birthright but Esau he made light of it let us never make light of our birthright this is the Holy Ghost it is your birthright never make light of adoption never make light of perfection never make like this is your inheritance glory be to God hallelujah glory oh praise be to God but when your predestinated now the act the accuser let's get back to the accuser you did this you did that to be predestinated means to be way back before there was a star before there was a moon before there was an earth before there was anything an atom before there was anything moving you were in the back part of God's mind and listen I want to tell you that he did not think of you in your condition now because he doesn't think in complete thoughts now he saw you as a perfect image just like him casting out Devils healing the sick preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ a man standing for this message glory be to God team Han that's how he saw you huh a man and this is why when the Devils enjoy you not data well listen devil he's still working on me don't worry buddy don't worry you just hang around a little bit hang around a while and you'll see he'll keep his word oh you're not in the book you're not in the book or what do you mean you're not in the book you know the devil don't even know you whether you're in the book or not because because when the book was written he was even he wasn't even in existence so what he is doing he is guessing he is trying to make you doubt that you're in the book so you have to challenge your devil said ok devil let's go back let's go back you want to take me back 5 years no no that's not enough let's go back twenty and thirty or thirty and then way before it was a star there was a boom wait before where were you when the sons of God shouted with joy and the morning stars sang together I was there hallelujah that's why Joe one day oh when he got the revelation amen the devil took everything from him he took his family he took his wealth he took everything but go one day God had a real man to man talk words with Joel get uptight for Joel get up stop complaining speak to me like a man oh I like rubbing rugged talk with the Lord speak to me like a man where was now when I laid a foundation of the world and when Joe got a revelation and he saw himself way before the beginning he said I know my my Redeemer liveth though a hallelujah the Lord taketh and he giveth Oh taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord [Applause] cuz the devil thought that he was only serving God because he was being materially blessed the Lord giveth and he taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord and I'm gonna tell you something this preacher you're seeing today it doesn't matter if I have a car at home it doesn't matter if I have whatever it is if it doesn't matter if I have just dust in my pocket Amen I know my Redeemer liveth hallelujah praise be to God hey man you've got to have a fixed faint let's continue hey man you made me see it oh I love that Hey now you want to know what your call to amen there is a genuine holy convocation and we're entering into the seventh church age the church age of Pentecostal age do you see it we've entered we've entered in that holy convocation we're entering into that real genuine eternity where the church is cold you're not called to a church you're not called to a denomination you're not called to a group our calling is to the eighth day eternal convocation amen but into eternity aiming with their eternal King I'm gonna tell you something about this with their eternal King one day MO rather Abraham Amon after the Battle of the Kings Amen hallelujah he met a man that was called Melchizedek Oh hallelujah and you know something about nelq acidic and you know this is why brother Branham spoke a mystery that was a mystery you know a man who was this Melchizedek oh my they tried to they tried to look for records of his existence where do you come from who is your mama where you appeared but the Bible says he had no beginning he had no in hallelujah and he was a king of Salem no record hallelujah I don't care what records they keep in time here I'm only interested in the record that he keeps up there hallelujah hey man glory be to God hey man you come from God and you go back to God again and Abraham paid tithes to this Melchizedek amen and after a while he disappeared amen he stepped out of eternity amen and went back to eternity and he left no record Oh hallelujah hey man the glow repeats our God Oh glory be to God he was King Melchizedek a man king of Salem Amen let's let's look at another quote here just a moment amen see as as I said eternity is like a circle let's get back to that we all come down we are eternal when the Holy Spirit comes into your heart and brother Graham said that's the only way we can get back to eternity because the Holy Ghost is eternal and you know what it's called Zoe the very life of God the very person of God listen man I'm not just looking for a blessing I'm looking for the person of God ehh halleluya he dropped down in time but during that time he had to put blood across the chasm they are across the the whole length of time to redeem it so push it back up amen Jesus was when he come in a flesh [Music] Amen and dropped into time it did not stop him from being eternal no but he just come down into time now he didn't come into time just to just pay us a visit he came into time to redeem those that have fallen into this little mood hallelujah glory be to God and to redeem all those Amen hallelujah and to bring it back up not for everybody but for the Elector predestinated seen of God before the foundation of the world jesus said I don't pray for the world but I pray for those that God has given me no repeats our God hallelujah he had a mission he had a purpose he had a hey man you come from God and you go back to God again glory be to God Amen blow read so therefore the change Amen this little loophole was broken but he come down to redeem Amen oh that was in that a match so he come from eternity listen to me he come Jesus come from eternity and step into a space of time and he come amen and made of flesh amen and through here in the order sanctified and a streak of blood went across this place to redeem it and to connect it back to God again all for the eternity do you see that amen so therefore he come in a step and step into this body of time could you imagine the God of glory he's eternal he steps into time he puts on a body he was the mystery of God revealed because all that God was he poured it into Jesus Christ [Applause] [Music] he was the mystery of God revealed and the church has got to be the mystery of Christ revealed the world wants to see Jesus the world is longing to see Jesus where will they find him it's Jesus in you and I don't explain don't expect the world to understand you you are a mystery to them hallelujah just like Jesus was a mystery to the to his age now if this God of glory you would expect him to have stadiums of followers He healed the sick he raised the dead he did everything and all the sign of the Messiah he manifested God in human skin why because eternity was in him the flesh was just time hallelujah amen this is why I have to tell you you haven't seen me yet I haven't seen you I see your flesh glory be to God but in you hallelujah the real you oh the real you let me say it again the real you I see flesh I see you in a suit I see you walking around in a dress whatever but I haven't seen you glory be to God amen the real human comes from God and goes back to God again you don't know me I don't know you amen of course we know each other before the foundation of the world but listen the world will never understand you so don't expect the world to understand you now okay this is my time can can you give me just 15 minutes is that okay brother feel this - okay he preached on okay I have to stop here but just I just want to get to a point here see notice it is also upon the eighth day the last day of the feast see the tabernacle notice after that after the last piece after the last Church age after the last completed seventh day upon the earth after the millennium after the Millennium that this holy convocation come oh so we have to understand a thing I'm so happy you see because brother Graham said we're still worshiping under the Feast of Tabernacles all the way through the Millennium that's gospel but the eighth day you see because there's still time a thousand years are allotted there's still time amen but when the seventh seal his last explosion time will be no more it's the end of the world as the end of a shrugging nature is an end of all things that we know it today we know that when we go in a millennium praise God and to the wedding supper and have a millennial reign is still under time because God wants to prove that God promised that you will live a thousand years he keeps his promises oh but after that i john saw the new jerusalem coming down for the old earth had passed away glory be to God the old earth has passed away no more water not even Sun necessary because he was a light of the new city hallelujah to the lamb amen you talk about a representation Oh hallelujah that's what we come from amen see remember this is a Feast of Tabernacles this is what I was saying gathering a place see amen we're in the Millennium the Bible says they build houses and they show and have it of course there be peace but Satan will be that bound what for still time [Laughter] no time Oh hallelujah but I'm gonna I'm gonna close with this like brother Isaac said a man you know we're coming back and we shall reign on the earth on a new earth not the filthy one we see today because the Old Earth and the old heaven has passed away it has served this time but this new earth this new heaven is for eighth day people hey this New Jerusalem has eighth day loss hallelujah you see in this seventh day we have pains and we have trials and we have dis oh you see and then they say you go to the doctor and so forth you call it all kinds of names but brother Graham say it's just a demon you can call it cancer still a demon amen but Satan will be bound a thousand years and at the end we come back after the Millennium the new landlords policy king and queen mrs. Jesus Christ and we shall judge the earth hallelujah the books were open listen to me the books was open but I'm so thankful that the redeemed of God their names have been transferred to the Lamb's Book of one where our wedding certificate is [Music] that's why we can stand up as bribe because we have a wedding certificate oh the devil said oh I remember you did this okay let's play the tape

I feel sorry for you huh you're not gonna make it you better know who you are you better know where you stand huh glory be to God Oh never did it in the first place glory be to God hallelujah you know what I like here's what I like there's a quote that brother branham said that every sin has got to be judged we all know this I hope I hope I hope you've you're in the message man every every sin has got to be judged he said but when we make mistakes and we sin not willingly that sin still has to be judged these that but one is put under the blood of Jesus Christ that sin is broken down he's broken down the chemists chemistry of that sin is broken down and this is a good thing that I like the prophecy he sends it back to the one who made you do it hallelujah glory be to God a man who can lay anything to God he left man Satan you're gonna be judged a man glory be to God we are in that eternal Church age or we're getting into that eternal church age glory be to God [Applause] hallelujah
