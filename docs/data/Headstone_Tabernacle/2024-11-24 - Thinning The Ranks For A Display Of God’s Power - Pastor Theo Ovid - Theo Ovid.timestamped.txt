[55:15] whose side you're on we know we're on
[55:18] the Lord's Side and you know brother Ram
[55:20] said one time if if you lose your teeth
[55:22] you got to gum the devil you know so you
[55:24] got to keep standing so certainly a
[55:26] great privilege I bring greetings from
[55:28] many Believers from far and wide they
[55:30] send their love and appreciation to The
[55:31] Headstone
[55:33] Tabernacle
[55:34] amen and I was out for three weeks so
[55:39] bov just asked me to bring a greeting
[55:41] and to give a trip report so uh the
[55:45] first meeting was about three weeks ago
[55:47] I was at brother stephanus K Brena in
[55:50] Germany so greetings from brother
[55:51] stefanus from his wife from the Coen
[55:54] Brena family from the ch Church
[55:57] there and there were Believers that came
[55:59] from Brother jeano's church and brother
[56:01] Gerard Perez from LCA London was there
[56:04] brother Zoe Thompson so they all send
[56:05] their love and their greetings and we
[56:07] had a tremendous time in the
[56:10] Lord uh brother jarard would have opened
[56:13] up uh the meeting that we had and it was
[56:14] a truly a tremendous uh blessing
[56:17] speaking about the names in the book and
[56:19] such an encouragement to the people of
[56:21] God and then uh the next day there was a
[56:24] a youth meeting question and answers and
[56:27] then I preached that night about Divine
[56:29] connections and being connected to God
[56:31] and the Holy Spirit moved among the
[56:33] people and then Sunday morning a man
[56:35] after God's Own Heart and truly God is
[56:37] doing something all over the world the
[56:39] spirit of God is moving and uh we see
[56:43] God uniting from the east from the West
[56:45] so there were Believers from different
[56:47] places there and truly the Lord blessed
[56:49] and then uh brother stepan stephanus and
[56:52] I uh flew from Germany over to the Nai
[56:55] convention in Nigeria it was my first
[56:58] time being in nawi I've been to Nigeria
[57:00] in different meetings but first time in
[57:02] nawi and what a time we had in that
[57:04] naway meeting I tell you the worship the
[57:07] fire the inspiration there were eight
[57:10] services and the worship in the first
[57:12] service and the last service was the
[57:14] same worship the shouting and praising
[57:16] in the first service and the last
[57:18] service was the same there was one day
[57:21] that you know you had to ask the
[57:23] question on the third service is is this
[57:26] the same day that we are in because the
[57:27] energy in the third service in the
[57:29] evening is just as strong as the first
[57:31] service in the morning but is a joy in
[57:33] the people's heart to serve the Lord
[57:35] It's a joy to know where you come from
[57:37] it's a joy to know where you're going
[57:40] amen so um eight services and a
[57:42] tremendous time so I bring greetings
[57:44] from Brother Isaac of who is the host
[57:46] Pastor there in the Navy convention and
[57:48] all of the ministers and that were there
[57:52] um brother Isaac he spoke as well as
[57:54] brother stephanus brother Gideon from
[57:56] Uganda brother kamita brother Olu um
[58:00] brother ekek and all the churches that
[58:02] are that were represented in that
[58:03] meeting many many I think there were
[58:05] over 50 or 60 Pastors in the convention
[58:08] so it was quite a meeting I think maybe
[58:10] close to Six 700 Believers in the
[58:13] meeting so we had a tremendous time and
[58:15] uh it's a joy it's a refreshing to know
[58:17] that you're not standing alone and that
[58:19] there are many others who have not bowed
[58:21] to the things of this world and they
[58:23] under expectation for the manifestation
[58:25] of the the sons of God and the burden
[58:28] and inspiration of the meeting was the
[58:29] unity of the faith the unity of the
[58:31] spirit and we know that God is doing the
[58:33] uniting it will not be a uniting under
[58:36] man but it will be uniting under the
[58:38] headship of the Holy Ghost and we are
[58:40] looking for God to unite us not by man
[58:42] and you know as you see the world is
[58:44] uniting and the world is coming together
[58:46] and how technology is being used and I
[58:48] think I I I ministered some weeks ago
[58:51] and speak about the spirit of nimrod
[58:52] that's on the earth now that when God
[58:54] looked down there in Genesis Genesis is
[58:57] the seed of everything to see how
[58:59] through the unity of man they were
[59:00] trying to build a tower to get to God
[59:02] and God said I have to destroy this
[59:04] thing and he did it by breaking up their
[59:06] language and by destroying their
[59:08] language he broke it completely and he
[59:10] said if he did not do that the unity of
[59:12] man was going to accomplish whatever
[59:14] they set their hearts to that's how
[59:16] powerful Unity is and the only time we
[59:18] saw a reversal of that is back there uh
[59:21] around the day of Pentecost when they
[59:23] preach and everyone heard in their own
[59:24] language and now we see with technology
[59:26] trying to break down the language
[59:28] barrier so that with AI and all these
[59:30] things man could be one again and if God
[59:32] did it that way the first time he's
[59:34] obligated to do it again to destroy the
[59:36] man-made system if God treated with
[59:39] Sodom and gomorra a certain way the
[59:41] first time he has toed Sodom and
[59:42] Gomorrah a second time so all of these
[59:45] things to show that there's going to be
[59:47] a Unity that where God is head of this
[59:49] Unity where Christ is head of his church
[59:51] and it will not be man on display it
[59:53] willn't be man's ideas but it will be
[59:55] God himself have calling from the east
[59:57] from the west from the north from the
[59:58] south and the sovereignty of God means
[1:00:00] he doesn't need anybody permission to
[1:00:02] call you to pick you to choose you to
[1:00:05] heal you to redeem you to bless you to
[1:00:07] transform you to restore your joy your
[1:00:10] peace your worship your Victory the seed
[1:00:12] in your soul wasn't placed there by man
[1:00:15] but the God who plac the seed in you is
[1:00:17] more than able to bring that seed to
[1:00:19] life and he's going to do whatever he's
[1:00:20] going to do and he's speaking to
[1:00:22] individuals so I'm under great
[1:00:24] expectation for what God is about to do
[1:00:26] can the church say
[1:00:28] Amen so after the the meeting in Germany
[1:00:32] and Nigeria I ended up in Lagos
[1:00:35] afterwards and then I preached from the
[1:00:37] de's church so that was a tremendous
[1:00:39] blessing as well so it was just back to
[1:00:42] back we're trying to do as much as we
[1:00:43] can one brother said to me if the Lord
[1:00:46] causes you to die here you need to die
[1:00:48] empty whatever you do give it all to the
[1:00:50] Lord you know so from meeting after
[1:00:52] meeting service after service so we had
[1:00:54] a tremendous time brother DA's church
[1:00:57] and the last service which was last
[1:00:59] Sunday I preached about the U's church
[1:01:00] so um greetings from mother da and the
[1:01:03] church there in his portion of uh Lagos
[1:01:08] and of course greetings from Brother Olu
[1:01:10] and the church in Lagos brother hu
[1:01:13] Church they send their love they send
[1:01:15] their appreciation they send their
[1:01:17] greetings so I'm here this morning to
[1:01:19] thank you for your prayers for your
[1:01:20] support for the encouragement and I was
[1:01:23] saying to brother ID every message
[1:01:25] message uh so was six messages I
[1:01:27] preached I said every message came from
[1:01:29] here because under the atmosphere the
[1:01:31] inspiration the church is pulling and
[1:01:33] sometimes you prepare something but
[1:01:34] something is said under inspiration and
[1:01:36] you realize that that it it is God doing
[1:01:39] something amongst us and allowing that
[1:01:41] to be used in a way to be a blessing to
[1:01:43] others we have no agenda of our own we
[1:01:45] have no Mission I didn't invite myself
[1:01:47] to these these different conventions
[1:01:49] that took place but the Lord is doing
[1:01:51] something and we are so grateful to be a
[1:01:53] part of this body this mystical body
[1:01:55] this bride buddy and I said it in the
[1:01:58] Navy convention when we get on the other
[1:02:00] side it will not be a Nigeria group over
[1:02:02] there or a German group over there or a
[1:02:04] Trinidadian group over there it's one
[1:02:06] body it's one Lord It's one Faith it's
[1:02:08] one
[1:02:10] baptism Hallelujah and I said to them
[1:02:13] that the problems of the elders the
[1:02:15] problems that were in the wilderness we
[1:02:16] younger generation have nothing to do
[1:02:18] with that so we are not continuing the
[1:02:20] wars of 40 years ago 30 years ago 20
[1:02:23] years ago we have one Mission the
[1:02:25] Promised Land we have one desire of the
[1:02:27] Holy Ghost we have one passion to see
[1:02:30] God move on the scene I said I'm one
[1:02:33] preacher who's tired of church
[1:02:35] Hallelujah I'm looking for a
[1:02:36] manifestation of God I'm looking for a
[1:02:38] reality I'm looking to see the sick heal
[1:02:41] backsliders restored I'm looking to see
[1:02:44] the lame walk I'm looking to see the old
[1:02:46] become young again I'm looking to see
[1:02:48] the tears that have been shed be wrapped
[1:02:51] up into the joy of the Lord because the
[1:02:52] joy of the Lord is our strength and
[1:02:55] weeping me endure for a night but joy
[1:02:57] comes in the morning so I'm looking to
[1:03:00] see Souls on fire for God hallelujah it
[1:03:04] will not be man doing the work but it'll
[1:03:06] be the Holy Ghost I thank God that you
[1:03:09] are not even the believer that I am not
[1:03:11] even the believer but the prophet of God
[1:03:13] said the word in you that seed in your
[1:03:15] soul that's the believer that's who
[1:03:18] responds to the word of God even when
[1:03:20] you backslide that word in you is still
[1:03:22] a Believer even when you make mistakes
[1:03:24] that word in you is still a Believer
[1:03:27] when you feel sick you feel tired you
[1:03:29] feel frustrated that word speaks better
[1:03:32] for you oh
[1:03:34] hallelujah amen as we get ready to
[1:03:36] change out of the service I want to
[1:03:38] encourage you friends your sins and your
[1:03:41] mistakes would be one thing if it wasn't
[1:03:43] for the blood Hallelujah if God wanted
[1:03:46] to hold your sins against you there'd be
[1:03:48] no need for blood but because he knew
[1:03:51] you'd make mistakes and because he knew
[1:03:53] you would struggle he put blood there so
[1:03:56] that when he looks through the blood he
[1:03:58] sees you different there'd be no reason
[1:04:00] for blood if God didn't know there'll be
[1:04:02] a need for blood oh come on now somebody
[1:04:04] preach back to me if God didn't think
[1:04:07] about your mistake think about your
[1:04:09] failures think about your ups and downs
[1:04:12] he wouldn't put blood there but he put
[1:04:14] blood and when he sees that blood he
[1:04:16] could pass over you can the church say
[1:04:19] Amen Give the Lord a shout of Praise
[1:04:21] there's two things I love God for it's
[1:04:24] the blood and the sea of
[1:04:26] forgetfulness it's only in church people
[1:04:29] remember what you did but thank God
[1:04:31] there's a sea of forgetfulness that he
[1:04:33] wants to forget your mistakes he wants
[1:04:36] to forget your failures because when he
[1:04:39] looks at you he sees you in just two
[1:04:41] ways the way you are in his thoughts and
[1:04:43] the way you're going to be he does not
[1:04:45] look at your present condition because
[1:04:47] he knows you rotated off of God so may
[1:04:51] the Lord richly bless you it's good to
[1:04:53] be home we are closing in the end of
[1:04:56] this year and before we leave this place
[1:04:58] we're going to give the devil a knockout
[1:05:00] punch we are not leaving this world
[1:05:03] barely making it we are leaving this
[1:05:05] world with a shout with a joy with a
[1:05:08] praise and as for me and my house we
[1:05:10] will serve the Lord we will bring our
[1:05:13] families I don't care where your son is

[1:05:17] don't care where your husband your wife
[1:05:19] your family as for me and my house he
[1:05:22] said the promise is unto you and to your
[1:05:24] children so may the Lord richly bless

[1:09:15] appreciate the um the greetings and the
[1:09:18] update from overseas pray for brother
[1:09:21] Isaac I think some was Dean of God we're
[1:09:24] looking to see what the Lord will do
[1:09:25] yesterday we had our last uh things plac
[1:09:28] into life and godliness Andrew took that
[1:09:31] to share something on financial
[1:09:32] breakthrough very interesting session
[1:09:35] they had and he read the scripture from
[1:09:37] Second Kings about this with woman and
[1:09:41] this part was really striking go borrow
[1:09:43] these vessels abroad from all th
[1:09:44] neighbors and empty vessels borrow not a
[1:09:47] few and he went through some stuff there
[1:09:49] was quite interesting I told him that it
[1:09:51] remind me when I was doing literature
[1:09:53] and um when you have the exam papers and
[1:09:56] they give you one little line and you
[1:09:58] they have six pages from that little
[1:10:00] line I us ask myself how Shakespeare
[1:10:03] didn't know Shakespeare mean all of that
[1:10:06] from one to line the amount of stuff
[1:10:08] you're explaining of all that and this
[1:10:11] was really something else and he was
[1:10:12] talking about networking and how if
[1:10:15] you're bad talking your neighbor you're
[1:10:17] fighting up or whatnot you can't go on
[1:10:19] borrow nothing you can't ma for anything
[1:10:21] but this year say borrow a vessel is not
[1:10:23] a few to do what to get the oil the last
[1:10:26] part was very interesting I'm not want
[1:10:27] to tell you everything because we
[1:10:29] recorded this first one we recorded we
[1:10:30] had it upstairs here and we're going to
[1:10:32] put it up uh maybe to tomorrow we're
[1:10:34] going to put up on the on the YouTube
[1:10:36] channel and she came and told the man of
[1:10:38] God and said
[1:10:41] go and and he said go sell the oil pay
[1:10:45] thy debt and live thou and thy Children
[1:10:48] of the rest so it was quite interesting
[1:10:51] talk about um look written personal
[1:10:54] audit recognize potential borrow vessels
[1:10:56] even empty vessels not a few in other
[1:10:59] words don't limit what you could access
[1:11:01] that you could get God's blessing shut
[1:11:03] the door and pour the mystery of the oil
[1:11:05] sell the oil pay your debt and live
[1:11:07] under rest very very interesting session
[1:11:09] I feel it is necessary as I tell them
[1:11:11] especially of Christmas coming up now
[1:11:13] and all those jingle bells ringing and
[1:11:15] all those and the spirit of spending and
[1:11:18] so on like that and um you know God want
[1:11:21] you to be diligent and applying yourself
[1:11:25] and can't repeat the same Mystics you
[1:11:26] paint last year painting again this year
[1:11:28] yeah I wouldn't go down with that and so
[1:11:30] you can't repeat the same Mystics and
[1:11:31] then you have no money to do this no
[1:11:32] money to do that but we are grateful to
[1:11:35] God for his time and the season we're
[1:11:37] living in right now before I read the
[1:11:39] scripture I just want to say that
[1:11:41] President Putin launched what he call an
[1:11:43] experimental missile in
[1:11:46] Ukraine this missile he said the West
[1:11:48] doesn't have any answer to it it is 10
[1:11:51] time the speed of
[1:11:52] song that mean before you hear it it
[1:11:54] kill you
[1:11:56] you hear what I say before you hear my
[1:11:58] voice you're dead it is 10 times the
[1:12:01] speed of song this missile I think it go
[1:12:03] up as far as outer space almost and come
[1:12:06] down and that last part that comes in
[1:12:09] inside of that have about six or S
[1:12:11] little fellas inside that that that
[1:12:14] pinpoint to go to areas and the live of
[1:12:18] what happened in Ukraine is like fire
[1:12:20] falling from the sky there's no response
[1:12:22] to that what they have now could reach
[1:12:25] any part of the earth in 30
[1:12:28] minutes I repeat that they have missiles
[1:12:32] that could go any part of the earth in
[1:12:34] 30 minutes and the West have no response
[1:12:38] for that and brother brandham preached a
[1:12:40] message called the invasion of the USA I
[1:12:43] think it is in that message he was
[1:12:45] talking about when the voice says you
[1:12:47] have to surrender and what not what else
[1:12:48] will you just do he was implying that
[1:12:52] there will come a time when they have no
[1:12:54] challenge to what is coming to them
[1:12:56] because the Judgment of USA is
[1:12:58] set now you could think it doesn't
[1:13:01] affect us it does whatever happen in
[1:13:04] This Global Community will affect the
[1:13:07] entire world and that's why you have to
[1:13:10] strengthen yourself and stop complaining
[1:13:13] hush your mouth and stop complaining
[1:13:15] about the petty things you go through
[1:13:17] because a tough time still lays ahead so
[1:13:20] you have to have faith in God for this
[1:13:22] season here to push forward not faith in

[1:14:36] forever and the bread that I will give
[1:14:38] is my flesh which I will give for the
[1:14:40] life of the world the Jews therefore
[1:14:42] strove among themselves said how can
[1:14:44] this man give us his flesh to eat then
[1:14:46] Jesus said unto them ver very unto you
[1:14:49] except he eat the Flesh of the son of
[1:14:51] man and drink his blood you have no life
[1:14:53] in you whosoever eateth my flesh drink
[1:14:55] it my blood had eternal life I will
[1:14:57] raise him up at the last day for my

[1:15:21] your fathers did eat mana and a dead he
[1:15:24] that eateth of this bread shall live
[1:15:25] forever let's continue these things said
[1:15:28] he in the synagogue as he taught in
[1:15:30] Capernaum and many therefore of his
[1:15:33] disciples when they had heard this said
[1:15:37] this is a hard saying who can hear
[1:15:42] it when Jesus knew in himself that his
[1:15:46] disciples murmured at it he said unto
[1:15:48] them does this offend you what and if he
[1:15:51] shall see the son of man Ascend up where
[1:15:54] he was before
[1:15:55] it is the spirit that quickeneth the
[1:15:58] flesh profiteth nothing the words that I
[1:16:00] speak unto you they are spirit and they
[1:16:03] life but there are some of you that
[1:16:04] believe not for Jesus knew from the
[1:16:06] beginning who they were that would
[1:16:08] betray him and who would betray him and
[1:16:11] he said therefore said I unto you that
[1:16:13] no man can come unto me except that was
[1:16:16] given unto him of my father and here
[1:16:18] this verse 66 from that time many of the
[1:16:21] disciples went back and walked no more
[1:16:24] with him Judges chapter
[1:16:27] 7 reading 1 to7 then J then zerubba who
[1:16:32] is Gideon and all the people that were
[1:16:34] with him rose up early and Pitch beside
[1:16:36] the well of harod so that the host of
[1:16:38] the midianites were on the north side of
[1:16:41] them by the hill of Mor in the valley
[1:16:44] and the Lord said unto Gideon the people
[1:16:47] that are

[1:16:53] the are too many for me
[1:16:55] to give the medit into their hands lest
[1:16:59] Israel VA themselves against me saying
[1:17:03] my own hand had saved me now therefore
[1:17:07] go to Proclaim in the ears of the people
[1:17:09] saying whosoever is fearful and Afraid

[1:17:15] millad and the return of the people 20
[1:17:18] and 2,000 and they remained 10,000 and
[1:17:22] the Lord said unto Gideon the People Are

[1:17:35] shall go with thee of whomsoever I say
[1:17:38] unto thee this shall not go with thee
[1:17:40] the same shall not go so he brought down
[1:17:42] the people unto the water and the Lord
[1:17:44] said unto Gideon
[1:17:46] everyone that lath of the water with his
[1:17:49] tongue as a dog laped him shall thou set
[1:17:53] by himself likewise everyone that Bowe
[1:17:55] it down upon his knees to drink and the
[1:17:58] number of them that lapped putting their

[1:18:04] the rest of the people bow down upon
[1:18:06] their knees to drink water and the Lord
[1:18:08] said unto Gideon by the 300 men that
[1:18:12] laed will I save you and deliver the

[1:20:58] hallelujah hallelujah praise God thank
[1:21:01] you Jesus all right let's go you may be
[1:21:04] seated the Pharisees and the leaders of
[1:21:07] that day Hallelujah always tried to
[1:21:10] belittle him before the people that's
[1:21:12] right that was just a way that the devil
[1:21:15] had a working all the Pharisees and
[1:21:18] teachers of his day constantly try to be
[1:21:21] little
[1:21:22] Jesus they all to throw off they could
[1:21:26] give to him they done it they watched
[1:21:28] him constantly to find where they could
[1:21:31] find a fault they never spoke of his
[1:21:34] good things they always finding
[1:21:36] something that they could belittle him
[1:21:38] about you see look at here if he was a
[1:21:40] man of God he wouldn't do this way if he
[1:21:42] was a man of God he wouldn't do that way
[1:21:44] they were trying to cast a shadow upon
[1:21:47] him to get the people to disbelieve him
[1:21:50] that's the work of the devil that old
[1:21:52] scheme never ceased there's many times a
[1:21:55] minister will make a mistake and if he
[1:21:57] comes into a neighborhood a precious
[1:21:59] brother who's trying to do what's right
[1:22:01] to lead people right everything the
[1:22:02] devil can point to the unbeliever or the
[1:22:04] so-called Christian in that neighborhood
[1:22:06] to throw off on the man he will do it
[1:22:08] you know the re Christian ways to hide
[1:22:10] everything you can from a brother don't
[1:22:12] tell his bad things just tell his good
[1:22:13] things just tell you what you know about
[1:22:15] him that is good if anything is bad let
[1:22:18] it alone the poor fellow has enough
[1:22:20] against him anyhow don't try to take a
[1:22:22] pole and show a man for further into the
[1:22:25] ditch the Christian attitude is to pick
[1:22:27] him up and take him out of the ditch you
[1:22:31] have Wicked Christians you know or I
[1:22:33] should say the wicked so-called
[1:22:34] Christians somebody in Dish the Chen eat
[1:22:37] it e
[1:22:40] itlu they want you to stay there but you
[1:22:43] know what in their mind they down there
[1:22:45] they want to bring you down to where
[1:22:47] they are because some body who is higher
[1:22:49] will pull you up oh give the Lord some
[1:22:51] Praises Give the Lord a shout in the
[1:22:52] house
[1:22:57] the Christian attitude is to pick him up
[1:22:59] and take him out of the ditch don't
[1:23:01] never try to shove him down Never Shout
[1:23:05] Out never don't never try to shove him
[1:23:07] down he's done already try to help him
[1:23:11] up
[1:23:14] amen and too many of us today too many
[1:23:17] people today I might say try to do that
[1:23:19] if they could just get something and
[1:23:20] another that was real bad so you see and
[1:23:23] and that's why in the pray prayer prayer
[1:23:24] meeting on Friday I talk about the the
[1:23:26] the moat and the
[1:23:27] beam and the Bible talk about somebody
[1:23:30] seeing a little m a little splint in
[1:23:31] somebody eye and they look it take it
[1:23:33] out and they have a big beam a big wood
[1:23:36] in front the they can't see good Jesus
[1:23:38] said take out the beam out your eye you
[1:23:41] hypocrite and then you can see clearly
[1:23:42] to take out the moat out of your brother
[1:23:45] eye some people they don't want to take
[1:23:47] out no moat out your eye know they want
[1:23:48] to show people their MO look look mo mo
[1:23:50] mo mo
[1:23:52] mo them feel they come the Bo identifier
[1:23:55] fault identifier sin identifier all your
[1:23:58] faults they want to point out the object
[1:24:00] of getting your beam out that's why the
[1:24:02] question was do you see clearly to get
[1:24:04] the beam out mean you could see clearly
[1:24:06] to effectively help your
[1:24:08] brother he said th
[1:24:10] hypocrite you so loud are talking
[1:24:13] now hypocrite I not s hypocrite
[1:24:17] hallelujah hallelujah first get that
[1:24:19] beam out then see clearly set of people
[1:24:22] talking and criticizing and whatnot and
[1:24:24] man my God and the same condition he mo
[1:24:27] oh my for instance if you Brethren and
[1:24:32] and I read the scripture where the Bible
[1:24:34] says if somebody's at a fault you with
[1:24:36] wisdom you who have a restore that one
[1:24:38] in gentleness in meekness because you
[1:24:41] and all could get trapped so you can't
[1:24:43] you can't restore somebody in arrogance
[1:24:45] or like you on top or you Superior or
[1:24:48] you're more and that's not the approach
[1:24:49] Hallelujah watch for instance if one of
[1:24:51] your bre make a mistake do something
[1:24:53] wrong which you subject to do it I am
[1:24:54] too every one of us as we go along let
[1:24:57] us remember we are brothers we are
[1:24:59] brothers if we got any fighting let's
[1:25:02] fight one another bring it together
[1:25:03] bring it before our Breen and settle it

[1:25:07] continuous fight husband fighting with
[1:25:09] wife wife husband brother against
[1:25:11] brother and this one God don't want
[1:25:13] interest in fighting the devil when the

[1:25:33] you see how they moving all right let's
[1:25:36] go Matthew 13 Jesus speaks in verse 24
[1:25:41] another Parable he put forth saying the
[1:25:42] Kingdom of Heaven is liken unto a man
[1:25:44] that swed good seed in his field while
[1:25:47] men

[1:25:51] while you're awake you know while men
[1:25:53] slept his enemy came and so tears among
[1:25:56] the wheat and went his way and when the
[1:25:58] blade was sprung up brought forth fruit
[1:26:00] there appeared tears also so the

[1:27:35] Angel is coming to bring the separation

[1:27:42] the Lord he is the one is going to tell
[1:27:45] which is right and which is wrong God
[1:27:47] said he will send his angels at the last
[1:27:49] times praise God to make that separation

[1:54:42] back a bride for the son another
[1:54:45] Masterpiece part of the
[1:54:48] word Jesus couldn't take the place
[1:54:50] remember when they read that day in the
[1:54:51] book he read just part of the prophecy
[1:54:54] left the rest of it for the last day we
[1:54:56] are supposed to take that part what part
[1:54:58] is that to declare the day of Vengeance
[1:55:00] of our God but God say vengeance is mine
[1:55:03] I'll repay we not in a position to take
[1:55:05] Vengeance it has to be the ministry of
[1:55:07] Jesus Christ it can't be man taking
[1:55:09] Vengeance it's God veiled in a people a
[1:55:12] bride that will pick up that scripture
[1:55:15] see let's go are you with
[1:55:18] me he has to cut

[1:55:29] disappear you correct them woo we they
[1:55:32] take a time off from
[1:55:34] church nobody can tell them nothing and
[1:55:37] that's why I keep telling young people
[1:55:39] years
[1:55:40] ago if your parents don't straighten you
[1:55:42] out and correct you life
[1:55:45] will put licks on
[1:55:49] you so we not doing our children a favor
[1:55:51] by not correct them and straighten them
[1:55:53] out you are helping them a long life
[1:55:55] journey by correcting them and
[1:55:57] disciplining them that's what you're
[1:55:58] supposed to do and you like a one young
[1:56:02] man want to leave like his father his
[1:56:03] father this his father that I say listen
[1:56:05] if your father failed you you must not
[1:56:07] fail your children you still have to get
[1:56:09] empowered because someday you might be a
[1:56:11] parent and if you don't get self
[1:56:13] discipline what you discipline and tell
[1:56:15] the child if you don't get this
[1:56:16] straightened out how you straighten out
[1:56:18] your own child we have to start
[1:56:20] somewhere all right so you see
[1:56:22] he has to cut he wants to cut the church
[1:56:25] out just like he did the son out like he
[1:56:28] did the bride and the groom to be his
[1:56:31] bride here we go you must be part of
[1:56:34] him watch this part not part of a
[1:56:38] Creed I believe this our church believe
[1:56:40] this no not part of that not part of the
[1:56:43] church I Bel l in this Tabernacle I Bel
[1:56:46] to this Tabernacle this my pastor not
[1:56:48] that not part of denomination but part
[1:56:51] of him am do you get that and if you are
[1:56:56] part of him you could live anywhere to
[1:56:58] you in France to in Germany to you in
[1:57:00] Italy you don't have to be in Trinidad
[1:57:02] God could put you anywhere anytime any
[1:57:04] place under any condition you would live
[1:57:05] a Christian life because you are part of
[1:57:09] him could we give the Lord some
[1:57:11] [Applause]
[1:57:13] Praises so your location doesn't make
[1:57:15] you a
[1:57:17] Christian not because something in a
[1:57:19] garage is a car
[1:57:23] it could be a lawn
[1:57:24] m not because a man in the castle he's a
[1:57:27] king it could be a
[1:57:30] joker man say living in the castle he'll
[1:57:33] be comedian inside the place do you
[1:57:35] understand that so not because somebody
[1:57:37] in church they a
[1:57:39] Christian they get it this
[1:57:41] time they get it this time all right so
[1:57:45] watch this now not part of a Creed not
[1:57:48] part of the church not part of the
[1:57:50] nomination but part of him am HED out of
[1:57:53] any other kind of form won't work I like
[1:57:56] that I see some ministers making the
[1:57:58] church in their own image and likeness
[1:57:59] not God like they have a vision of their
[1:58:02] what is wanted and the church show and
[1:58:04] the church Spirit church and the
[1:58:07] church devil to touch a church because
[1:58:09] dead
[1:58:11] already not heed from a kind of form you
[1:58:16] have got to be heed from the word that's
[1:58:19] why you can't look at somebody say oh

[1:58:27] me next minute she
[1:58:30] gone she was never part of it and you're
[1:58:32] looking at she and following she and she
[1:58:36] off
[1:58:38] right so you can't watch she or he you
[1:58:41] have to watch
[1:58:46] this you see I get TI to this very early
[1:58:50] as I told young men Proverbs was my key
[1:58:51] script
[1:58:52] that fathered me that guid me as a young
[1:58:54] man this was me kept you from the
[1:58:56] perverse woman everything this Proverbs
[1:58:57] inside everything out of here I get TI
[1:59:00] to this this what kept me this what give
[1:59:03] me the commitment the dedication
[1:59:05] devotion this this this

[1:59:18] world cut off of you and just leave the
[1:59:21] word only to live in you the great
[1:59:24] sculpure is counting on
[1:59:27] you I
[1:59:29] wish I'll just go these words are so
[1:59:33] precious I don't know what you think
[1:59:34] about it the great sculpture is counting
[1:59:38] on you willing to stand and have
[1:59:41] yourself shaped into the likeness of his
[1:59:44] requirements that his word requires in
[1:59:48] the last days I pour my spirit upon All
[1:59:49] Flesh your son and daughter shall
[1:59:50] prophesy Christ
[1:59:52] is the identified Masterpiece of the
[1:59:55] word made flesh you are asked to
[1:59:58] identify yourself in him by the same
[2:00:01] word to be a masterpiece for the bride
[2:00:05] now Brethren God has a masterpiece then
[2:00:10] to present to the world now he wants a
[2:00:13] masterpiece
[2:00:15] today are you
[2:00:17] willing are you ready my Christian
[2:00:19] friend are you really sure that your
[2:00:22] life is so reflecting for Christ no
[2:00:24] matter what the world say they say you
[2:00:26] lost your mind you're gone crazy you
[2:00:27] went and joined that bunch of Holy
[2:00:29] Rollers don't pay attention to that if
[2:00:32] you are truly saved and in that body and
[2:00:35] the word of God in you and reflecting
[2:00:37] itself and the life of Christ reflecting
[2:00:39] out of you brother sister don't you take
[2:00:41] that chance I don't care what you are
[2:00:44] what experience you have let that word
[2:00:47] reflect through you each day because God
[2:00:50] in his last day is taking a bride for
[2:00:53] his son Jesus Christ could you give the
[2:00:54] Lord some
[2:00:58] Praises so this story of Gideon is a
[2:01:01] reflection of how God called for
[2:01:04] separation in order to get into
[2:01:07] battle get out the ones who are afraid
[2:01:10] get out the ones who just drinking out
[2:01:13] of 10,000 9,000 700 people was
[2:01:17] rejected and there's 300 remain and God
[2:01:21] says by this by this separated bunch in
[2:01:26] other words put a mark upon those who
[2:01:28] laughing like
[2:01:29] dogs put something on them mark
[2:01:32] them could you imagine God marking You
[2:01:36] Now by your attitude to prepare you for
[2:01:39] the battle Oh Glory to God these men
[2:01:43] don't even know they are being watched
[2:01:45] these men don't even know they're being
[2:01:47] marked hallu but God said I will test
[2:01:50] them there for you
[2:01:52] because Gideon you to take them out of
[2:01:53] battle and you want to have the right
[2:01:55] kind of men before you you know the
[2:01:57] Bible talk about traitors in the last

[2:10:18] something he will do it nothing going to
[2:10:20] stop him am God's power to
[2:10:25] transformo some years ago on patrol
[2:10:27] going up a corn field I would he said
[2:10:30] there some some a limb blew off a tree
[2:10:33] and fell over a stalk and the stalk was
[2:10:36] trying its best to get up straight a
[2:10:37] stick fall on it it was deformed because
[2:10:40] something happened to it we find out a
[2:10:42] wild creeper in the field which many of
[2:10:43] you in Kentucky and I skip and the
[2:10:46] creeper would grab over and grab a hold
[2:10:48] of that corn and wrap itself gradually
[2:10:50] so easy so slightly that what sin does
[2:10:54] that what little lie does that what
[2:10:55] little things does a little small little
[2:10:57] Vine and it get ticker and ticker and
[2:11:00] next minute you're
[2:11:01] held
[2:11:03] bondage and that corn wrap itself so
[2:11:05] gradually easily so slightly you could
[2:11:07] hadly tell it was wrapping and finally
[2:11:09] get stronger and stronger it pulled the
[2:11:10] corn till it's deformed it pulled it
[2:11:12] against itself wrap it around its own
[2:11:14] Vine deforming it it's a corn it's a
[2:11:17] Believer message people but deformed yes
[2:11:22] we are still in the image of God but
[2:11:24] some are so deformed as sons of God that
[2:11:27] walk contrary to his word that he had us
[2:11:30] and provide for us to walk the world
[2:11:32] twist us out of way and pull us close to
[2:11:34] it sin has done this evil thing to the
[2:11:36] Sons and Daughters of God the deformer I
[2:11:39] know this seems strange to speak of it
[2:11:41] to deform but that's what he is he's
[2:11:43] deformed or perverted or change over or
[2:11:47] made something different yes it is the
[2:11:49] same seed but it's deformed a deformed
[2:11:53] seed instead of having love have hate a
[2:11:55] deformed seed still packing jealousy a
[2:11:58] seed packing jealousy green green Green
[2:12:00] Eyes Of
[2:12:03] Jealousy are we find out this deformer

[2:20:59] will not believe even some true
[2:21:02] ministers will

[2:21:41] demons they go out into places they get
[2:21:45] among men ministers they get among
[2:21:48] church members they get among good
[2:21:51] people and they cause them to come into
[2:21:53] an illusion and they say things and do
[2:21:57] things and teach things and practice
[2:22:01] things that are contrary to the word of
[2:22:03] God Amen you said what is it is enticing
[2:22:07] Spirits coming down trying to substitute
[2:22:10] something for the word of God God has no
[2:22:13] substitute for his
[2:22:15] word it is eternal and forever hear this
[2:22:19] one God has nothing to substitute faith
[2:22:23] faith has no substitute hope will never
[2:22:26] take the place of faith faith is alone
[2:22:29] Faith stands alone faith is one thing
[2:22:32] hope is another thing hopes hopes for it
[2:22:36] faith has got
[2:22:38] it oh give the Lord a shout faith is the
[2:22:41] substance of the things that you're
[2:22:43] hoping for
[2:22:45] hallelujah praise
[2:22:48] God one is intellectual faith
[2:22:50] and the others that direct Revelation
[2:22:52] from God it will never takes its place
[2:22:55] amongst a lot of people where emotions
[2:22:57] and so forth there come tatling
[2:22:59] backbiting all kind of ungodly thing he
[2:23:01] said somebody saying this is not right
[2:23:03] that's not right if you chase it down
[2:23:05] nine times out of 10 the very person
[2:23:07] making that St is not right God hates
[2:23:11] Discord among Brethren be reverent be
[2:23:14] holy love God and stand by him
[2:23:18] my Hallelujah
[2:23:21] watch so you don't know you do know
[2:23:24] you're not right with God when you're
[2:23:27] still backbiting lying doing everything
[2:23:29] you can't be right with God I don't care
[2:23:31] how much churches you belong to until
[2:23:33] your soul becomes converted he said now
[2:23:38] watch he said when he gets into God he
[2:23:41] watches his life with God's word and
[2:23:44] realize he is lined up with every bit of
[2:23:46] it watch something his thoughts is pure
[2:23:49] his intention are pure his alternative
[2:23:52] is right and he knows he's line up with
[2:23:54] the God's word all hell can't move him
[2:23:56] he's lined up with the word of God he's
[2:23:58] got Divine love Purity in his heart for
[2:24:01] every man and woman he's abstained from
[2:24:03] the things of the world oh praise the
[2:24:05] name of the Lord and B he's talking
[2:24:07] about when Jesus talk about uh uh Eat My
[2:24:10] Flesh and drink my blood he say he never
[2:24:12] explained it too many parasites yet so
[2:24:14] he wanted these parasites of ministers
[2:24:16] to get rid of them so he throw the bum
[2:24:19] accept it my my blood them parasites you
[2:24:21] say too many parasites parasites got up
[2:24:23] and walk away no more but Abraham says
[2:24:27] he says watch this now God has been
[2:24:29] trying to get over to the church without
[2:24:32] seeing it right out it's a thing
[2:24:35] something you ready almost done sometime
[2:24:39] we have to say things in such a way that
[2:24:42] it might tin down it might bring some to
[2:24:46] go out some to leave some to ponder over
[2:24:51] but that is done purposely it must be
[2:24:54] done that way then it might be some
[2:24:57] would say you mean God would purposely
[2:24:59] do a thing like that he certainly did he
[2:25:02] does that yet he said one day when he
[2:25:05] had thousands around
[2:25:06] him begin a play when you're thousand
[2:25:09] around him he said except you eat the
[2:25:12] Flesh and drink my life um drink the
[2:25:14] Flesh and and something like that what
[2:25:15] kind of statement do you think the
[2:25:16] medical doctor or nurse or any
[2:25:18] intellectual person eat his flesh he
[2:25:19] cannibal
[2:25:20] and his whole audience walk away from
[2:25:23] him friends butam prophesied there'll be
[2:25:27] a persecution of the church the church
[2:25:29] will be closed down and I'm thinking
[2:25:31] about it what persecution does during
[2:25:35] the Dark
[2:25:36] Ages the real Christians were those who
[2:25:39] died during the Dark Ages they were torn
[2:25:43] aunder they were head were cut off they
[2:25:45] were burned at the stake they did them
[2:25:46] all kind of even wickedness but they
[2:25:48] were the real Christians the other
[2:25:51] church members who saw that they said no
[2:25:53] no no no no I out of that persecution
[2:25:57] brings a
[2:25:58] separation from those who are sincere
[2:26:01] and true and committed so this
[2:26:05] persecution is like going to be like a
[2:26:07] final separation a separation to
[2:26:09] separate those who really believe from
[2:26:12] those who don't believe friends this
[2:26:15] message is
[2:26:17] real this message is true
[2:26:20] but the bandam says that if these things
[2:26:22] doesn't happen he's a false prophet he's
[2:26:24] not a false
[2:26:25] prophet Los Angel could sink at any time
[2:26:29] do you know that changes
[2:26:31] everything Russia lose a weapon that's
[2:26:33] why I bring the news I'll bring it to
[2:26:34] you I wanted to get a little video clip
[2:26:36] to show you what it looked like but I
[2:26:38] didn't get you with that but the thing
[2:26:40] about it we are going through
[2:26:41] treacherous
[2:26:42] Waters and I want you to take the gospel
[2:26:44] to heart not the ritual of coming to
[2:26:48] church there are too many religious
[2:26:50] Church message folks they love church
[2:26:53] they love songs they love music they
[2:26:55] love specials they love going to church
[2:26:58] but they're not applying what they're
[2:26:59] hearing to their
[2:27:02] lives let's all
[2:27:06] Stand All My Life
