praise tonight hallelujah hallelujah thank you the Lord Anthony thank you so much for that inspiring singing let's B with a prayer we have a prayer request for cl you Heavenly Father we thank you for your presence tonight and this great opportunity that we could take this time aside for this small portion to come together in prayer i' present kzia clock before you that you'd visit her and touch her from the CR of her head to the S of her feet the platelets go up and may all be well Lord in Jesus I ask it and as we approach your word may we be be with us in a special way in Jesus name amen amen it's a blessing and privilege to be here and thank all of you for joining this virtual room it's an opportunity it's an opportunity we may not always have this opportunity but it's an opportunity for the moment we want to take full advantage of it now I want to read a scripture from Matthew chapter 6 ver 6 on Romans 12 verse one Matthew 6:6 reads but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou has shut thy door pray to th thy father which is in secret and thy father which Sees In Secret shall reward the openly these is Jesus words we know it can't fa Romans 121 I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable to God which is your reasonable service may God bless his word now this morning I sent out uh from the pastor's desk and I I said these words which I want to repeat this tonight today as you fast and pray May there be a restoration a renewal a return to your first love as the scripture says nevertheless this is from Revelation uh 2:4 nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because th was left thy first love so it's something that God is seeing about our love for him not just love going to church all of the Breen all love singing specials all hearing the word but first love love for him and I said this all social media by Design is intended to grab your attention the cares of Life by Design is intended to weigh us down the enemy's trick is to distract you causing you to lose focus on God and the surrendered calling on your life this destruction can lead to making many idols and serving other gods and I I put the scripture from Leviticus 261 ye shall make no Idols no griev image neither rear you up a standing image neither shall you set up any image of stone in your hand in your land to bow down unto it for I am the Lord your God and we discover a word inordinate inordinate means unusually or disproportionately disproportionately large and excessive and I extract that from the scriptures inordinate affection excessive love for anything or a disproportionate attachment to anything can lead to idolatry and the scripture given is Colossians 3:5 mortify Therefore your members which are upon the Earth fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil cusp sense and covetousness which is idolatry but Bram said anything can be of God anything can be of God to the word God you can make an idol of God you can make a piano of God you can make anything of God return to your first love okay so let's go on tonight for the BR don't you like getting alone with God to be alone he says I can tell him all my trouble is all alone and that's the way he wants to get you alone to himself your prayers as much as you um you for instance out in the public here we go when you are praying like in the church or around the altar get alone you will pray a different prayer when you are by yourself than what you do when you're in public slip alone all of you go out and just have a secret place a secret meeting place where you and the Lord meet several times and brother Isaac spoke about the war of the altars the war of sacrifices and the war of the priests what this time of prayer is or this secret place is you finding your altar an altar unto God let's continue so in the time of fellowship and communion that is where God spoke to me that is the way we want to get into the spirit of it you like to pray through and get in the spirit that's the only way you can do it shut yourself off from the rest of the world and get alone with God and that's the reason that you like to do that because when the first couple came on Earth Adam and Eve that's what they did in the cool of the evening they came in from their Vineyards and got down under the trees the great C as it was as the sun perhaps was setting streaking down through the bushes God came down in the cool of the evening and fellowed with Adam and Eve oh my that comes right on down knowing yet when you get in contact with God when men when you come in contact with your friend and God is your friend so you love to commune with him and talk with him you know there's something about getting alone to yourself many people never pray until they come to church many people think that's the only place to pray is at church but the Bible said for to pray everywhere lifting up holy hands and then when we get by ourselves we usually pray different than when we would be praying a church it is a secret prayer that Jesus spoke saying enter ye in the secret closet and close the door and when you have did so pray to your father who sees in secret and he that sees in secret shall reward thee openly so tonight I don't want to just take it as a scripture but I want to take it as an order as instructions from Jesus himself let's continue when we are praying like that there seems to be something to the prayer that takes all the hypocrisy out of it it seems like we get in a better connection with God to get alone and there have been many times in my life and perhaps in your life that you just have to get alone once in a while with Jesus I've took my car drove down the road just studying after I got to the highway where it was free and off to some Countrywood till I will come so fill with his mercies and goodness till I'll stop the car and held the wheel and WEP like a baby that is being alone many times I've climbed up into the mountains where every man Tau I was going hunting up go up there and sit on a rock and just look up to the sky until it looked like my whole innermost being become filled with something that you could just feel everything of the world seemed to pass away for those precious hours alone with God and it is dear that is when the greatest Revelation and inspiration comes it is when we alone with God we will take more time on that I'm sure and we would live a better life more Victorious Life of Christ now the title I have for tonight is the kind of Christian that you ought to be that's the title of this exhortation tonight but brand you see when you pray don't stand like the Hypocrites do he says the way to have secret prayer that is what he said do now listen to this now don't let the washing hinder don't let the work hinder don't let nothing hinder don't let nobody know what you're doing just go before him get up in the wood somewhere get out on the side of the road go in a secret Closet close the door when the kids get at school then getting on your knees you have heard all kind of voices everywhere just get down and stay there here we go until those voices are silenced and you begin to lift up it will change you it will make you different like it did little Samuel it will do something to you if you will just do it now now it will make you what you should be this is a quote it will make you the kind of Christian that you ought to be what is he talking about if we could say long enough to shut down the voices you have the voice of WhatsApp um uh this thing Tik Tok um Instagram Facebook all these social media phone calls talk text all these things all these distractions voices to get them silenced long enough now I want to ask you a question what good does it do to us to come to church and set in the meeting and Ponder and maybe discouraged because we didn't get a prayer card or maybe be discouraged because of some little ill thing a neighbor did or discouraged about one little matter or the other that keeps Christ away from you so discouragement depression frustration anxiety he cannot come in that environment he say it is when you are thinking on him that is when the disciples after the resurrection was going down the road to Emos as they were speaking about that's when he appeared to them we got our minds on too many things of the world if we could throw those things off our mind and think about him and his soon coming we'll be there'll be more Revelations and Power in the church but we keep thinking about things what am I going to do tomorrow what will I do next week will I hold my job will this be all those things are in the hands of God think on Christ and you know usually when we are thinking about God and keeping our minds on God that God come close to us and I think that's one of the great Troubles of the people of this day we have too many other things on our mind even when we come to a healing service we seem to think well are going to get a prayer card tonight or perhaps I'll not be prayed for we will never be able to accomplish much as long as we keep those kind of thoughts oh if we didn't have so much other things on our mind you know sometime we go to church and thinking about tomorrow I got to do this next day I've got to do this when we come to church we ought to lay aside every thought and everything of the world and enter into a fellowship with Christ and worship meditating worshiping in our hearts giving songs and praises to Him thinking of his goodness and what he means to us worshiping the spirit singing spiritual songs making Melodies In Your Heart even the Bible said if there's any Afflicted let them sing songs be happy be in meditation always here we go expecting God at any moment to appear to you are you doing it just now before this healing service talk about Mary as she was thinking not noticing who was around her little lady perhaps with a PE of sandals she was thinking all of a sudden that feeling got so great around her she just raised her hands and when she did standing was a light and standing by the light was Gabriel the Angel the Archangel of God hear these words now almost true if you want angels to appear to you keep your mind on God and off the things of the world go about your business go to your church go to washing of dishes wherever you are keep your mind on him all day and all night long then God will do something you are drawing close to him you have got the world shut out now you and he are together I was talking this one is beautiful I was talking to a noted evangelist brother TL he said I was thinking brother Bram of how that my whole objective is to save souls and give all my time to save Souls of Christ he said then I happen to think but what about my own love and Devotion to Christ you see that there so in other words he think about going out and evangelizing and so on like Souls but then he asked himself what about my love and Devotion to Christ Christ loves him too he loves us we put a lot of time and things but God want us to come apart and sit down and worship him and talk with him and talk it over I love that that is sweetness that's the greatest time of anybody's life it's just to sit down and meditate take everything off your mind if you would do that there wouldn't be so much of nervousness around the country if we could just think on God and then he use the scripture Draw N unto me I'll Draw N unto you now that blind woman Anna could be led to that spot with natural eyes to see the fountain filled with blood look he will be able to lead you tonight that's got good Sight To the Cross to see with your spiritual eyes here we go don't look for the applaud of the world you won't have it but be willing to sacrifice your prestige everything you are sacrifice it to the kingdom of God sacrifice your time for prayer sacrifice your life sacrifice your card game sacrifice all the things of the world give it over to the devil let him have it it belongs to him you walk with Christ how about the close you say brother Brandon I'm no PR I don't Al together mean sexually prostitution is on a higher level and this is mindblowing listen to this wisdom you can prostitute your time how much time do you give to him prostitute your own selfish motives going around saying well I belong to this church I am better no you are not still reading you can prostitute otherwise than sexually the holy spirit will speak to your heart and you will say I want nothing to do with that you are blindy prostitute what's the matter with you committing adultery with the world that's what you're doing you say I belong to church I'm so cold and indifferent you say pretty prayers oh I hate that phic thing you pray and make every Comma just perfect every period just perfect you pray so you can't talk to God like that you are listening to what you are saying and punctuating your prayer oh God help you to turn loose once and pray stop saying prayers and that's what I have to share with you tonight to become the Christian that you want to be stop listening to your prayer stop punctu in your prayer stop seeing prayers and pray let's bow ah heads heavenly father I thank you tonight it's glorious to come here among your people and call upon your name and to seek your face we thank you for life we thank you for health and strength we thank you to be still alive Lord and we see the countown is on Lord this is the generation that would see your coming this is the generation that will see Nation Rise Against Nation earthquakes disasters all kind of conditions and the end is not yet on until this gospel be preached as a witness here we are as we see prophecies unfolding right before our eyes help us tonight as a people as your people you say if my people that is called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and turn from their Wicked Ways oh God there is so much destruction doesn't have to be sinful destruction could be ordinary destructions like how the disciples look at the temple and Jesus said there will not be one stone upon another it could be natural things natural life God we spoke about inordinate affection an excessive love for things it could be yard it could be flowers it could be piano could be whatever we put in excess and disproportionate love and attention and affection to becomes an idol it it replaces you and you ought to be the center of our Lives oh God recalibrate us tonight may we be refocused tonight back to that first love we could do Works without love we could Act without love we could work in church without love we want to have that fi that worked by love Lord bless the people tonight open up a door to them as they go in their secret closet right now where they are in their home they're in that closet tonight whether in the drawing room the bedroom whether they standing sitting kneeling they are in their closet in their own house may reward them and bless them as your words as your word declare that if we hide our away in you you would be with us granted father in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen and I want
