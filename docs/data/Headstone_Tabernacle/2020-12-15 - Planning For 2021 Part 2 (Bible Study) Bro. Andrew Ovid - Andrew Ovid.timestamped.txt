[13:08] lose his soul
[13:09] to what shall a man give for his soul in
[13:12] exchange for his soul
[13:13] so we are grateful to god tonight and
[13:15] tonight we
[13:17] also want to announce that this is our
[13:18] final zoom meeting for this year
[13:21] um we're looking forward for next year
[13:24] uh
[13:24] i want to have maybe a prayer meeting on
[13:26] the 9th of january and our first
[13:28] bible study in the 12th so just to let
[13:31] you know um we have our convention
[13:33] coming up our
[13:34] uh virtual convention from ghana that
[13:37] will be next week
[13:39] and you know we will see how things go
[13:41] we have to work on it and prepare for it
[13:42] and
[13:43] just be us up in prayer uh it's
[13:47] really a powerful time we're in and um
[13:49] tonight
[13:50] i want to share something with you and
[13:52] we have a special guest
[13:54] guest speaker tonight or or somebody to
[13:56] share something special for us tonight
[13:58] and uh i hope you'll be blessed and
[14:00] inspired by it but before he comes
[14:03] i want to read a scripture and that
[14:05] scripture is found in numbers chapter 13
[14:07] chapter of numbers one verse the titu at
[14:09] first
[14:11] if you have your bibles you can turn to
[14:12] it numbers
[14:14] 13th chapter 30 verses said and caleb
[14:17] still the people before moses and said
[14:19] let us go up at once and possess it
[14:23] for we are well able to overcome it
[14:26] and something struck me and i i
[14:30] find it just something worth sharing and
[14:31] talking about and
[14:33] last week the bible study was about
[14:35] planning
[14:36] god is the god of planning and order the
[14:38] first day second day to the day fifth
[14:39] day sixth day and were
[14:40] arrested he said what about order he
[14:43] orders things
[14:44] you want our steps to be ordered
[14:47] planning is is the way
[14:48] of life to execute uh what we
[14:52] need to get done and
[14:56] i'm thinking about how planning have a
[14:58] lot to do with decisions
[15:00] the power of decisions not so much the
[15:04] feelings
[15:05] but decisions and as christians
[15:09] we tend to go a lot by feelings by
[15:12] emotions by dreams by
[15:14] you know you're looking for the
[15:15] anointing and whatnot and it struck me
[15:18] that the anointing is not coming into
[15:20] your house to sweep your flow
[15:23] your anointing is not coming in your
[15:24] house to wash your wares
[15:26] your anointing of the coming house for
[15:28] you to paint like not every company
[15:30] and any on the back on it outside the
[15:32] house gonna change color
[15:34] it's not unless you're in magic or
[15:36] something like that it's not happening
[15:38] god give them the land and dear
[15:41] responsibility
[15:43] was to possess it and i realized
[15:46] that people could sit back relax rock
[15:50] back
[15:50] looking for the spirit looking for um
[15:54] whatever to do things that they are
[15:57] empowered to do
[15:59] by the power of decision and the power
[16:01] of will
[16:03] and it was an astonishing thing to look
[16:06] and see that caleb
[16:08] after spending time with grapes and
[16:11] everything else
[16:11] in the land with these other 12 guys
[16:15] could come back and see them in such a
[16:16] depressed and terrible mood
[16:19] that he could say let us go up at once
[16:22] and possess it for we are well able to
[16:25] overcome it
[16:26] i think that that was not feelings he
[16:28] wasn't feeling
[16:32] he was seeing let us go up at one
[16:36] at once as a decision conscious
[16:40] of one thing for sure god said so
[16:44] and i want you to think about that
[16:46] tonight about
[16:49] you making a decision to obey god
[16:52] you're making a decision to do what is
[16:53] right and sticking back
[16:56] not saying i am weak and i'm weak and
[16:58] i'm waiting for strength
[16:59] i need strength no when are you going to
[17:03] decide
[17:04] to walk away from what you're supposed
[17:05] to walk away from
[17:07] when are you going to decide to take
[17:08] stock of your life
[17:10] because when your life in shambles i
[17:12] know i said shambles
[17:14] you know there is no order there is no
[17:16] structure there is no
[17:18] vision and as a church
[17:21] uh where god brought us from to where we
[17:23] are
[17:24] this journey hasn't been an uh
[17:27] unstructured journey
[17:29] it's a structure that god works with in
[17:32] egypt
[17:32] he has to get them to the promised land
[17:34] there's an order of how he's going to do
[17:36] that
[17:37] when moses died he wanted it to continue
[17:40] he said now moses my servant is dead now
[17:42] joshua
[17:43] you take the people over every place you
[17:45] put your foot is yours
[17:47] and so on there was a structure there
[17:49] was an order
[17:50] when i beat you to shout shout don't
[17:53] mess with the
[17:54] garments don't mess with the the goal i
[17:56] will burn it have nothing to do with it
[17:58] i'll be with you there is always a
[18:01] certain order with god
[18:03] kill the americans hitting jebusites
[18:05] when they small take them out because
[18:07] they will get big and they're going to
[18:08] put pressure on you so deal with them
[18:11] and this is what
[18:12] i want to get with you tonight but ivan
[18:14] says that when this battleground this
[18:17] this mind this
[18:18] this battleground was chosen god choose
[18:20] the bachelor was chosen was the mind
[18:23] human mind and here's why he says the
[18:26] human mind was chosen for the place of
[18:28] battle
[18:29] where it was to begin that is because
[18:31] decisions
[18:32] are made from the mind ahead so if you
[18:36] make a decision
[18:37] to pray every day that's a decision and
[18:40] you begin to act
[18:41] by will on that decision then there's
[18:44] nothing could stop you from praying you
[18:45] know because that's your choice
[18:46] just as you choose to go into
[18:48] supermarket or you choose to do this so
[18:50] i choose to do that
[18:51] you could choose to do certain things
[18:53] like you choose to
[18:54] be here it's not a spirit sweep you up
[18:57] and and you say well um
[18:59] oh i'm feeling like i'm gonna be in in
[19:02] bible study tonight
[19:04] no it's not that you made a choice i
[19:06] want to hear
[19:08] i want to receive i want to learn i want
[19:11] to grow
[19:11] i want to understand because remember we
[19:14] are not
[19:15] born in obedience we are not born
[19:18] with the mind of god or intelligence of
[19:20] god we are not
[19:21] born uh uh are we alone of him
[19:25] because he said learn of me this is what
[19:28] god brought the child of israel out of
[19:29] egypt for
[19:30] to learn of him this god that
[19:32] demonstrated in supernatural power
[19:34] how much power he gonna demonstrate
[19:35] again if they don't know his will and
[19:36] his word
[19:37] if they don't know what will please him
[19:39] what will offend them what will upset
[19:40] him
[19:41] the hardest to get the word so for now
[19:44] because faith was locked up
[19:45] he gave them laws and that law thou
[19:48] shalt not though shalt not no sharpness
[19:50] behave yourself
[19:53] your mother all of that was just what
[19:54] laws because
[19:56] he himself his blessings
[19:59] has an order with it he cannot break his
[20:01] own law he can't break his own word
[20:03] he told adam and eve the day you get
[20:05] there of that day you die
[20:07] so therefore god had things set up in a
[20:09] certain way and
[20:11] that plan is about to be executed no
[20:14] because decisions are made in the mind
[20:16] you
[20:17] have to understand the difference
[20:19] between
[20:20] waiting on the anointing and you have
[20:22] things to do
[20:24] you know it come like um as pastor
[20:27] you deal with different people different
[20:29] individuals and sometimes you give
[20:31] guidance and people outrightly reject
[20:33] the guidance i can't do that
[20:34] i'm not doing that they're not doing
[20:36] that but in service they feel annoying
[20:41] and they're all excited about the
[20:42] anointing they're all excited about the
[20:44] inspiration
[20:45] that's fine but after the anointing
[20:48] after the inspiration are you falling
[20:51] through
[20:51] in obedience into god's order of things
[20:55] this is where it is important to
[20:57] understand the power
[20:59] of planning the power of planning means
[21:02] that there's a structure in front of you
[21:05] like a vision
[21:06] and that structure is what you're asking
[21:08] god to help you guide you to set up that
[21:10] structure
[21:11] or that order or that plan and then
[21:14] you begin to follow a plan now if the
[21:16] plan going off key god could show you
[21:18] know not this way
[21:19] not this way not this way not this way
[21:21] and bring guidance
[21:23] but if there's no plan how we can
[21:24] fulfill it there is no plan there's no
[21:27] ambition
[21:27] there is no goal there is no zeal there
[21:30] is no target
[21:32] they have to have a target and i
[21:34] remember somebody asking but the brand
[21:35] i'm thinking was brother perry green or
[21:37] one of them was asking him something
[21:38] about
[21:39] if this is will of god if it's the will
[21:41] of god is will of god
[21:43] and the answer to that was do whatever
[21:46] in your heart and if it's going off
[21:47] track
[21:48] god will let me just to tell you when
[21:50] something like that
[21:52] and friends i believe the hour has come
[21:55] for some crucial decisions to be made
[21:58] decisions not feelings
[22:01] decisions joseph
[22:04] made a conscious decision not to fool
[22:08] along with bautista's wife
[22:10] he had every opportunity to do that and
[22:13] he made a choice
[22:15] he ran for his life he could have stand
[22:18] up like a man
[22:19] and and play games and whatnot but he
[22:21] choose to run it was a choice
[22:24] he did not want to displease god he
[22:27] wanted to
[22:28] kept him keep himself and he wants you
[22:31] to keep the world
[22:32] that choice and decision that he made
[22:35] land him in prison
[22:36] but guess what this is where god wanted
[22:39] him because
[22:40] god wanted to meet the butler and the
[22:41] beaker and god wanted him to be in
[22:43] position
[22:44] for the next blessing for the next
[22:48] session because he was going to bring up
[22:51] all the vision and explain the vision
[22:53] of years of plenty and years of famine
[22:58] and that is why fear could say you know
[23:00] what joseph we need somebody
[23:03] who could manage this vision we need
[23:05] somebody
[23:07] who could deal with the challenges that
[23:09] is yet before us
[23:10] and i want you to do it because you
[23:13] interpreted the vision
[23:15] you're going to have plenty are we going
[23:17] to have fun
[23:18] when you have plenty how do you store
[23:21] how do you plan when you have plenty
[23:23] because some people
[23:25] they when they have some some little
[23:27] thing i wouldn't call it plenty
[23:29] they spend and they operate like if it
[23:32] will never finish
[23:34] now joseph was put in a position
[23:38] to execute this program for pharaoh and
[23:40] it did a tremendous job
[23:43] each one of you here tonight god has
[23:46] blessed you if he hasn't blessed you yet
[23:48] in that position
[23:50] he will bless you in a position to see
[23:53] what you will do and how you will do it
[23:56] you say i don't have plenty
[23:57] well let's see
[24:01] how you could manage little because the
[24:04] bible declares he who is faithful and
[24:06] liberal
[24:08] will be faithful and much yeah some
[24:10] people they can't man in a hundred
[24:11] dollars
[24:12] but hoping for ten thousand dollars and
[24:15] the hundred dollars is given
[24:16] just to see how you would manage that
[24:19] your attitude towards that
[24:21] so tonight uh uh we want uh
[24:24] the uh get a special blessing tonight
[24:27] because we believe we have scripture
[24:28] support for
[24:30] prudent financial management and i want
[24:33] to invite
[24:34] uh brother andrew ovid who he
[24:37] worked in a bank he has been wrong in
[24:40] seals and everything else
[24:42] and i am inviting him to share something
[24:46] with us tonight
[24:47] concerning uh if i could call it prudent
[24:50] financial management
[24:52] i know it wouldn't be it cannot be a
[24:54] detailed session as
[24:56] as we would like but sometime in future
[24:58] maybe we're going to have something in
[24:59] more detail but at least
[25:00] this is a start isaac started last week
[25:03] sharing about planning how god
[25:05] wanted to be in planning and you know i
[25:08] remember
[25:09] amber shea knows it like we have a plan
[25:12] that we drop
[25:13] i a number of years ago in addition to
[25:15] the church that
[25:16] we have right now already drawn and i
[25:18] thought
[25:19] even we wouldn't even let the believers
[25:21] know about that we have no money to deal
[25:23] with that but guess what
[25:25] we have a plan i love planning
[25:28] i like to see a plan planning
[25:32] you do have to have money to have a plan
[25:34] a plan is a thought an idea
[25:36] that is written down that is structured
[25:38] that if things work out you could
[25:39] execute
[25:41] because what if you do get money you
[25:42] look at the funds you do get what you
[25:44] need
[25:44] and you have zero plan so i'm saying you
[25:48] are empowered by
[25:49] being a son of god in the image of god
[25:51] to have plans i have thoughts
[25:53] because god he had thoughts and he
[25:55] wanted to express these thoughts he
[25:57] wanted to manifest the plan
[25:59] and he taught them his mind and he did
[26:00] that so tonight i want to
[26:03] invite brother andrew and he's going to
[26:06] come on now and share some things with
[26:08] us
[26:11] hi good night to all and
[26:14] and god bless you i trust that what i
[26:16] share would be a blessing to you all
[26:18] um and definitely definitely
[26:23] i think that um the time
[26:26] of the year is is a good time for us to
[26:30] be able to
[26:31] chat a little bit about it and um
[26:35] definitely i have some scriptures put
[26:37] aside here
[26:38] that will be a blessing to us all and
[26:41] [Music]
[26:43] um well i'll just get started right so
[26:47] um it is christmas time
[26:50] and it's a time that's very dear to all
[26:53] of us
[26:55] but it's also a time where persons
[26:57] basically
[26:59] i'm like i like to say they come out
[27:00] like wild ants out of a nurse
[27:03] right you only i'm like the only thing
[27:06] that has changed is that they're wearing
[27:07] masks right now
[27:10] but the spending the spending
[27:13] that is going on i mean it baffles me
[27:17] right so just before i go into the
[27:19] scriptures i just want to
[27:20] touch a little bit about spending right
[27:23] because
[27:24] um there are there are a lot of um i'm
[27:26] like habits that we
[27:28] we could gain from the bible that
[27:30] actually helps us
[27:32] with prudent financial planning as
[27:35] as it goes along there were actually
[27:38] many many um
[27:40] many passages in the bible where there's
[27:42] there's been talks of
[27:44] men of great substance and gold and
[27:46] silver and cattle and wealth
[27:48] throughout the bible man of god um and
[27:51] i've been in some chats with some
[27:53] christians and sometimes it's
[27:54] it's a it's a tug of war it's a pull and
[27:56] a push
[27:57] because they sometimes believe that um
[28:00] christians not supposed to be
[28:02] not supposed to have right and
[28:05] well of course some people have their
[28:07] own i'm like ideas of it
[28:09] i'm like of it but there's definitely
[28:11] scripture right so i want to just start
[28:13] with
[28:14] one here which is proverbs 3
[28:17] proverbs 3 um verse 9
[28:20] and it's it says honor the lord with thy
[28:23] substance
[28:24] and with the first fruits of thine
[28:26] increase
[28:28] so shall thy bands be filled with plenty
[28:30] and thy presses shall boost out with new
[28:33] wine
[28:34] right so only spending for christmas
[28:38] it um it really does baffle me how
[28:40] persons make decisions the way that they
[28:42] do
[28:44] because sometimes you will see something
[28:48] it may be on sale and so on and stuff
[28:50] like that no i'm
[28:52] i'm in the business of sales so i know
[28:53] the impact that this could have on
[28:55] somebody psychologically
[28:57] and so on and stuff like that but
[29:00] when i when i am chatting with my team
[29:03] and so on and stuff like that these
[29:04] stories do come out
[29:06] so you saw something you were never
[29:10] gonna buy it in the first place
[29:12] right you were never gonna buy it in the
[29:13] first place however though
[29:15] it's on sale it's 20 percent off it's 50
[29:19] off according to what it is that they
[29:21] put out there you're saving yourself 500
[29:25] but the catches you don't know that you
[29:28] have
[29:29] um to spend twenty five hundred dollars
[29:31] to get at five hundred dollars in
[29:32] savings
[29:34] now if it is that you look at it you
[29:36] were never gonna spend it in the first
[29:38] place
[29:41] and most persons don't actually process
[29:43] that so when they think that they're
[29:44] saving
[29:46] five hundred dollars they could have
[29:48] been saving twenty five hundred dollars
[29:49] because it's something that
[29:50] we're never gonna buy in the first place
[29:53] right so
[29:54] these are things and choices that we
[29:56] need to think about
[29:58] because just like we spoke about joseph
[30:00] and we spoke about the
[30:01] the seven years of plenty and seven
[30:03] years of famine
[30:05] i i believe as well that you never know
[30:08] when it is that you're in the times of
[30:11] famine
[30:12] until until the famine hits which means
[30:15] that you need to be stowing up grain
[30:18] so who it is that is throwing up grain
[30:20] for january and
[30:22] june and for next year december who it
[30:25] is at the store and upgrading for the
[30:26] future
[30:27] and we need to be able to think because
[30:29] i'm like brother branham taught us to
[30:31] live like he's coming
[30:32] tomorrow but plan like he's coming next
[30:34] 20 years
[30:35] right the bible also says that a good
[30:37] man leaves her
[30:39] leaves her inheritance for his
[30:40] children's children
[30:43] right so this basically speaks about
[30:45] generational wealth
[30:47] so it speaks about us putting aside
[30:49] something for
[30:50] unlike for the future now many of us
[30:53] have
[30:53] some challenges some challenges putting
[30:56] aside
[30:56] for the present
[31:00] so we need to be able to take to take
[31:04] counsel and guidance
[31:05] right basically the the session that we
[31:08] had the bible study that we had
[31:10] last week was really a good platform on
[31:12] planning
[31:14] right because it spoke about console it
[31:16] spoke about
[31:17] it spoke about wisdom and spoke about
[31:18] keeping god in your plans
[31:20] and i believe that there are some
[31:21] scriptures that we
[31:23] sometimes we miss some um some things
[31:25] and and it's only when it is that we
[31:27] read it and we look at it
[31:28] we're like wow right these things these
[31:31] things are really significant
[31:33] to the way that things go on presently
[31:36] right so um
[31:40] i want to just touch a little bit of
[31:42] scriptures in
[31:43] proverbs right so first i want to go to
[31:46] proverbs 13 11.
[31:50] so if it is that you could find it with
[31:51] me so proverbs 13 11
[31:54] right it goes wealth gotten by vanity
[31:57] shall be diminished but he
[32:00] that gathered by labor shall shall
[32:03] increase
[32:04] right and in the english standard
[32:06] version it goes
[32:07] wealth gain hastily will dwindle but
[32:10] whoever gathers little by little
[32:12] will increase it right and i believe
[32:16] that that scripture is really really
[32:17] significant it's really significant to
[32:19] me
[32:20] because um as
[32:23] growing up sometimes you want to be able
[32:26] to put aside for the future
[32:28] and the way the way that i used to get
[32:30] paid was daily so
[32:32] you have to little by little inch up
[32:34] otherwise you're gonna
[32:36] you're gonna practically end up like
[32:37] with nothing right so if it is that you
[32:39] don't know how to put aside something
[32:41] little by little you're going to end up
[32:43] with nothing
[32:44] right so it goes well gain hastily will
[32:47] dwindle but whoever gathers little by
[32:49] little will
[32:50] increase it will increase wealth right
[32:54] so pretty much we we
[32:57] spoke about a diligent a diligent um
[33:01] approach or a diligent hand
[33:04] will will reap like the abundance and
[33:07] also luke 16 10 speaks about he that is
[33:10] faithful and little will be faithful and
[33:12] much
[33:13] right so basically the formula is that
[33:16] little by little
[33:17] right now keep in mind that what is
[33:20] happening
[33:20] out there right now all these christmas
[33:23] sales and christmas promotions and so on
[33:25] and stuff like that
[33:26] and the way that the consumerism works
[33:28] in this world
[33:29] right everybody's actually trying to
[33:32] gain money little by little
[33:34] so they are happy nobody's nobody's
[33:36] doing anything nobody's selling
[33:38] i'm like anything out there at a loss
[33:41] right everybody's trying to actually
[33:42] gain for their business little by little
[33:44] so whether whether they drop the price
[33:46] to twenty dollars to ten dollars to five
[33:49] dollars
[33:50] they actually they actually have that as
[33:52] part of their revenue stream as part of
[33:54] their revenue strategy
[33:55] and you have to know what is your plan
[33:58] to begin to reserve
[34:00] your to begin to stop your green you
[34:03] have to know what's your plan to begin
[34:04] to budget
[34:05] so we're going to touch into budgeting
[34:07] in a little bit
[34:08] right but i just want to touch on
[34:09] another scripture here
[34:11] which i believe that we are familiar
[34:13] with in proverbs
[34:15] right so proverbs 6 verse 6 it says go
[34:18] to the ant
[34:19] thou sluggard consider her ways and be
[34:22] wise
[34:23] which having no guide over say or ruler
[34:26] provided her meat in the summer and
[34:28] gathered her food
[34:30] in the harvest right
[34:33] so pretty much what it also says
[34:37] is that hard work and putting aside
[34:40] putting aside basically little by little
[34:43] you need to be conscious of how it is
[34:45] that you plan for the future
[34:46] and basically some of the some of the
[34:48] generation that is out there
[34:50] they they act like if it is that money
[34:52] never dries up
[34:53] like if it's it's if it's an open pipe
[34:56] and it's all
[34:56] and it's always going to be flowing
[34:59] right and we need to be conscious of
[35:01] of of the need for stoner brain because
[35:04] there's also the story of the good um
[35:06] samaritan which is a story that's
[35:08] very dear to me because in in my heart i
[35:11] want to be
[35:12] i want to be in a position that i could
[35:13] give right
[35:15] so we don't know if the ones the ones
[35:17] that would have passed before
[35:19] yes yes it may have been certain
[35:21] challenges but did they have that
[35:24] um like did they have substance that
[35:25] they could give and we want to be in a
[35:27] position
[35:28] that we could we could give so
[35:32] um so there's also
[35:35] something that i want to speak about
[35:36] because of course well man you may know
[35:38] that i've been in banking
[35:40] right and um there's a lot of questions
[35:44] that have a lot to say about banking
[35:46] and there um there's actually script
[35:48] here to support
[35:49] a lot of stuff that goes on in banking
[35:52] right
[35:53] so for example let me just touch on this
[35:55] here real quickly
[35:58] right and proverbs 22 7
[36:01] right so let me just get it here in this
[36:03] version very quickly
[36:07] so proverbs 22 7 it goes the rich
[36:10] roulette over the poor
[36:12] and the borrower is servant to the
[36:14] lender
[36:17] right so and i know that a lot of
[36:19] successful persons
[36:21] right they actually believe in one
[36:24] major principle rule this the they
[36:27] subscribe to
[36:28] is don't over spend your income
[36:31] right or don't spend before you get your
[36:34] income
[36:35] right and those are things that we need
[36:37] to pay attention to because
[36:39] and this will everything is behind a
[36:42] behind a mask
[36:43] meaning that you don't you don't
[36:44] actually know what it's going on
[36:46] until until they're in it right because
[36:48] they make things look so appealing they
[36:50] make things look like
[36:51] i mean the bank really really does
[36:53] appear to be your friend and they want
[36:55] to help you to achieve your dream
[36:57] and whatnot and stuff like that but
[36:59] behind it they are
[37:00] in it to literally make money they are
[37:03] in it
[37:04] to make money off of money so i mean the
[37:06] bank is just printing money right
[37:08] but we don't want to go too much into
[37:10] that right but there's
[37:12] there's a really really nice scripture
[37:14] that i want to go to
[37:15] right so it says the thoughts in
[37:18] this is proverbs 21 verse 5 the thoughts
[37:21] of the diligent
[37:22] tend only to plenteousness
[37:25] but ev but of everyone that is he is the
[37:28] only one
[37:30] right so it so it guides us to not be
[37:32] hasty in life and
[37:33] pretty much well i mentioned that
[37:35] scripture before wealthy and hastily
[37:37] will dwindle but whoever gathers little
[37:39] by little will
[37:41] will increase it right so little by
[37:43] little
[37:44] is really really the formula right um
[37:47] just to touch on a lot of what it is
[37:50] that we deem as success and
[37:51] i mean i read up a lot of um a lot about
[37:54] millionaires
[37:55] right i read up a lot about it because i
[37:57] actually believe
[37:58] well a lot of the principles that they
[38:00] tap into
[38:01] are right here in the bible as well they
[38:03] are pretty much biblical
[38:05] right so when i do read about the
[38:06] millionaires right
[38:08] there's some percentages and there's
[38:10] some stats that stand out to me
[38:12] and one is that 80 of them actually
[38:15] start off at zero
[38:17] right they actually start off from
[38:18] nothing so they don't they don't
[38:21] start off with a million dollars to
[38:22] become a millionaire they actually start
[38:24] off with nothing
[38:25] right so in my studies it's got
[38:29] it's it's basically guided me to see
[38:32] how christians can make progress little
[38:34] by little
[38:35] and pretty much the hastiness um like
[38:38] the hastiness of the young generation
[38:40] that we have
[38:43] that's always looking for quick and for
[38:45] also
[38:46] something fast we know that that's not
[38:49] gonna last because the script just spoke
[38:50] about it
[38:52] right um and in studying that in
[38:55] studying
[38:56] like you're wealthy and the decisions
[38:57] that they make you're gonna see some
[38:59] differences and we need we need to begin
[39:01] to process these things logically
[39:03] now because of because i've been all
[39:05] around the country and travel
[39:06] and so on and stuff have have you ever
[39:09] noticed
[39:10] um that in some of the places that we're
[39:13] familiar with
[39:14] well i'm not sure if if it is that we
[39:16] are familiar with it
[39:17] but in like um valsein and lunch park
[39:20] and palmies and gulf view there's
[39:24] there's absolutely no luxury boots
[39:27] there's no lotto boots have we ever had
[39:29] i'm like have we ever thought about it i
[39:31] know that we do we don't play la tour
[39:33] and we do gamble and so on and stuff
[39:34] like that but
[39:35] it's still something for us to think
[39:40] about
[39:46] i know right i know i know that i know
[39:48] that we don't really think about it like
[39:50] that
[39:50] but seriously if it is that you drive
[39:53] through val say you know you try
[39:55] you drive through gulf view or you drive
[39:57] through lunch park
[39:58] you're not going to see any lots of
[40:00] woods right
[40:02] now i i actually believe
[40:05] if it is that these wealthy persons
[40:07] believe
[40:08] that that system with that system of
[40:10] getting rich quick or that lottery
[40:12] system
[40:12] if it is that they believe that it used
[40:14] to work
[40:16] they could afford to spend money on
[40:18] thousands of tickets they could pay
[40:20] people to stand up in line
[40:22] to increase the line they could make
[40:24] those things profitable
[40:25] but i think that they don't believe that
[40:28] it worked
[40:29] so that's why in those places where it
[40:31] is that we consider
[40:33] like the wealthy live there's no luxury
[40:35] boots
[40:36] however do like i said i've been
[40:39] i've been around the country between
[40:42] between um
[40:43] pinto and santa rosa there's about
[40:45] there's about five
[40:47] between mover junction and about five
[40:49] minutes in there's about 10. right
[40:52] um there's a village right off of
[40:55] maracas right off of
[40:57] maracas beach i was stunned and i was
[41:00] shocked there's a lot of boot in the
[41:01] heart of it
[41:02] i went as fast bish just last week
[41:05] the hub they tell me go down by the hub
[41:07] that is where it's busy
[41:08] right it's a lot of buddha right there
[41:11] adi hub
[41:12] right which which gets me to thinking
[41:15] when it is that i read these scriptures
[41:17] i'm like the millennials or the younger
[41:19] generation
[41:21] they don't they don't understand the
[41:22] concept of putting aside little by
[41:24] little
[41:25] they understand the concept of
[41:29] i'm gonna try a thing here in haste i'm
[41:31] gonna move quickly i'm gonna
[41:33] try something quick right so i
[41:36] i have never heard persons saying
[41:40] that they've gotten rich because of
[41:42] doing
[41:43] certain things or or that their wealth
[41:45] has got
[41:46] has come from doing certain things
[41:48] basically
[41:49] right i've never heard i've never heard
[41:52] somebody say that the turning point in
[41:54] their life was when it is that they were
[41:55] able to play that lot to money mark and
[41:57] whatnot and stuff like that in fact i've
[41:59] heard a story
[42:00] about a guy like from lav until that one
[42:02] year later he was
[42:03] absolutely flat out broke again from
[42:05] winning igato which
[42:07] which is which is lightning basically
[42:09] struck him
[42:10] coming out of the water on a on a rainy
[42:12] day on the beach that is
[42:14] that is what when any lotto is like
[42:16] pretty much
[42:17] right but we need to understand where it
[42:20] is that descriptors
[42:22] lead us into planning into into making
[42:24] prudent decisions until little by little
[42:27] we could put aside certain things right
[42:30] so i'm actually going to touch on this
[42:31] really quickly
[42:33] one of the number one reasons or one of
[42:35] the number one things that actually
[42:37] hinder
[42:38] young persons today is actually
[42:41] loans is actually credit facilities
[42:45] right so we actually have a lot of young
[42:48] persons who
[42:50] spend money before they have it
[42:53] and we know we know that um we live in
[42:56] our social society meaning meaning that
[42:58] we live in society
[42:59] so we love to be social and we value
[43:02] feedback
[43:03] and it's one of the things that i'm glad
[43:05] that we could have these bible studies
[43:07] because we we
[43:08] we're all in the same zone we're all in
[43:10] the same room we could communicate and
[43:11] we could
[43:12] we could be able to feed off of certain
[43:14] thoughts but the truth is that we value
[43:16] feedback
[43:16] we value feedback so much that you want
[43:19] to ask like your neighbor
[43:20] what they think about what do you think
[43:22] about the new lights that you know put
[43:23] up
[43:24] what do you think about the new color
[43:25] that you that you're that you paint your
[43:27] house
[43:28] what do you think about the car that
[43:29] you're now pull up in right on support
[43:31] and support and we value this feedback
[43:33] and it actually drives us to make
[43:35] impulsive decisions because
[43:37] we wonder
[43:42] basically the points that we come into
[43:44] life
[43:45] we want to show everybody the success or
[43:49] way it is that we've
[43:50] we've arrived at or we wanna we wanna
[43:52] achieve certain things in a shorter time
[43:54] frame
[43:55] and basically society right now forces
[43:58] young persons forces persons to
[44:01] basically play that game
[44:03] as in you see somebody now start working
[44:06] their first year
[44:07] and by time by time the second year you
[44:09] know that they're driving a brand new
[44:10] car
[44:12] right by time the second year they're
[44:14] driving a brand new car they have a
[44:15] credit card they're talking about
[44:17] vacation loan
[44:18] and so on and so on and stuff like that
[44:20] but they haven't done the basics
[44:23] so the basics is what i call um well we
[44:26] we we talk about it i don't know if it
[44:29] is that um
[44:30] that has been discussed and fine-tuned
[44:32] but basically the basics is
[44:34] one is that you have to have what you
[44:36] call a rainy day fund
[44:40] right so i don't know how much persons
[44:42] know the concept of a rainy day fund
[44:44] right so a rainy day fund is the first
[44:46] among that you could put aside so
[44:47] whether
[44:48] a thousand dollars two thousand dollars
[44:50] right that is for a rainy day
[44:52] that you had a really really bad day and
[44:55] you were able to hit a pothole that were
[44:57] able to blow
[44:58] two tires at the same time
[45:02] right and that you could you could
[45:04] actually handle the expense from that
[45:06] from your rainy day fund so something
[45:07] pops up
[45:08] we know stuff always pops up in life and
[45:11] we want to be prepared for it
[45:13] right so one is that you have a rainy
[45:15] day fund now this is for when something
[45:17] pops
[45:18] up now after that ring day fun
[45:21] then we are talking about i don't know
[45:22] if it is that you ever heard prisons
[45:24] mention you need to have six to eight
[45:26] months living
[45:27] living expenses put aside or six to
[45:29] eight months salary put aside
[45:31] right so if it is that you need to
[45:32] transition from job to job
[45:36] right so actually that there is is a
[45:39] foundation for what
[45:40] for what is still the financial piece
[45:43] which means that you don't want to be
[45:44] real and you don't want to do
[45:45] something that you that you don't want
[45:47] to do right
[45:48] so basically um i believe that
[45:52] that everybody has an opportunity to
[45:55] have financial peace
[45:57] when they start off right but the
[46:00] decisions that we make
[46:01] right it comes like we are running a
[46:03] hundred meters race but the decisions
[46:05] and the choices that we make
[46:07] tend to verse left and right
[46:10] so we so we need to understand what are
[46:12] the impact of those decisions as we plan
[46:16] so for example if it is that you started
[46:17] working and you were able to
[46:19] to have that rainy day fun in place and
[46:21] you put aside some funds
[46:23] right and then you were able to have six
[46:25] to eight months living expenses for just
[46:26] in case that you need to transition
[46:28] just in case that's something else i'm
[46:30] like happiness no
[46:31] that is not that is not a savings
[46:36] that is emergency right
[46:40] after those things then your savings
[46:42] begin
[46:44] so when it is that persons are saving
[46:46] now now the young people now have a
[46:48] concept of saving now
[46:50] they would save six thousand dollars and
[46:52] then
[46:53] black friday sale it's a six thousand
[46:55] dollar tv that they purchase
[46:59] that is that is not a concept of saving
[47:01] because it's almost better that you
[47:02] didn't save
[47:04] because the money the money is
[47:05] disappeared anyway
[47:07] right and then and then you're back at
[47:08] square one
[47:10] so what it is that you want to have is
[47:12] you want to store upgrade
[47:13] so that just in case because we don't
[47:15] know what we don't know what 20 21 holes
[47:18] we don't know what 20 22 holes
[47:19] we don't even know some of us are not
[47:22] thinking about
[47:23] january meaning that when when you see
[47:25] them running like violence in their mass
[47:27] making purchases
[47:28] buy any stuff for their house putting up
[47:31] lights on me
[47:32] and splashing paint and so on and stuff
[47:33] like that i mean it's crazy it's really
[47:36] really crazy
[47:37] i try to just stay stay far from it
[47:40] right because i i get kind of
[47:41] claustrophobic with the among the
[47:43] persons that are on the streets right
[47:44] now
[47:45] um right so but the thing is when it is
[47:49] that you process it
[47:50] some of these persons in the moment
[47:53] they are not considered in january
[47:56] they are not considered in january any
[47:58] moment
[48:00] right i i i speak to young persons
[48:05] persons who have goals and ambitions and
[48:08] yes they work very hard
[48:10] but these young persons right now
[48:12] they're talking about four thousand
[48:14] dollar phone
[48:15] six thousand dollar phone now mind you
[48:19] i i deal with some of these young
[48:21] persons right now
[48:22] they send in call me requests from these
[48:24] six thousand dollars soon
[48:28] meaning that they don't even have money
[48:30] on these phones
[48:32] which is ridiculous
[48:36] so we need to know we need to know what
[48:39] what expenses are actually worthwhile is
[48:42] it
[48:43] does it does it make sense right
[48:46] so when it is that we look at the
[48:47] impulsive nature like i don't know if it
[48:49] is that you all are conscious of it
[48:51] but the government would have announced
[48:53] the removal of the tax concession on
[48:56] motor vehicles
[48:57] for january and what has happened
[49:01] i mean i never thought that i would see
[49:03] it but but there's a
[49:05] there's a popular roland rule of company
[49:06] by me and the lots are being emptied
[49:09] and filled and emptied and filled and
[49:13] cars are just disappearing off of the
[49:15] lut so
[49:16] listen to the logic that is happening
[49:18] here right process the logic that is
[49:20] happening
[49:21] i'm seeing persons with perfectly good
[49:24] cars
[49:24] right meaning that i just saw somebody
[49:27] who has
[49:28] who bought a brand new car they have
[49:30] that car about two years now
[49:32] so she has a brand new car but because
[49:36] the car that she likes is gonna be
[49:38] thirty thousand dollars more
[49:40] next year she spends fifty thousand
[49:44] dollars
[49:45] on another car that she doesn't need
[49:47] because she already has a brand new car
[49:53] and these decisions are what actually
[49:56] push us
[49:56] further away from being financially
[49:59] secure from from having financial peace
[50:02] like i call it
[50:03] or from being able to stop enough brain
[50:06] that when it is at your neighbor come
[50:07] and they ask you for something you have
[50:09] something that you could extend
[50:11] that you could lend that you could give
[50:14] but right now we actually have a
[50:17] pandemic of persons
[50:18] not making logical decisions but russian
[50:21] to make purchases
[50:22] because they believe that they are
[50:23] saving something when it is that if it
[50:26] is that you think about it
[50:28] you were never gonna spend that money in
[50:30] the first place
[50:32] you were never gonna buy a car in the
[50:33] first place the car only began to appeal
[50:36] to you when it is that you realize it's
[50:37] gonna be more money next year
[50:39] but supposing next year you are able to
[50:42] save a million dollars or your business
[50:44] yields your million dollars
[50:45] you could have any car that you want you
[50:47] could you could make decisions like you
[50:49] want them or if it is that you have
[50:51] things put aside
[50:52] but you can't be paying a loan on one
[50:54] car and because another
[50:56] another something appeals to you that
[50:59] you're rushing by it
[51:00] so for example um uh
[51:03] i'm like a colleague of mine told me
[51:05] there was a two thousand dollar pot set
[51:08] right they dropped the price of fifteen
[51:09] hundred dollars after she finished work
[51:11] she rushed home to get fifteen hundred
[51:13] dollars to buy the pot set
[51:15] she's upset right now because a month
[51:17] has passed
[51:18] and he puts it still in a box
[51:22] right but these are the decisions any
[51:25] choices
[51:25] that we're not thinking about because
[51:29] you're saving 500 but you're spending
[51:34] 1500
[51:36] right fifteen hundred dollars that you
[51:37] were never gonna spend in the first
[51:39] place
[51:40] so when it is that you're able to think
[51:42] a little bit more logically about your
[51:44] choices and this is why it is that you
[51:46] need to be conscious of stone up green
[51:49] um i just want to talk to you really
[51:51] quick about budgeting
[51:52] right because budgeting is something
[51:55] that we that we
[51:56] may not know or we may not speak about
[51:58] but but budgeting
[52:00] helps us to keep in line right so
[52:03] when it is that you do have so for
[52:05] example your salary comes in your salary
[52:07] is a one-liner
[52:08] right your salary comes in then what now
[52:11] comes out
[52:12] you have probably about 20 lines of
[52:16] different things that comes out and then
[52:18] and then at the bottom
[52:19] which has like the equal sign for some
[52:21] persons there's a big zero there
[52:23] at the end of the month
[52:26] right so we need to understand the plan
[52:28] that budgeting
[52:29] plays and how it is that we can learn to
[52:32] budget
[52:33] so for example there's a saying that the
[52:35] wealthy persons
[52:36] they basically pay themselves with or
[52:39] they are able to put aside or they are
[52:40] able to save us
[52:42] so for example on my budget or on my
[52:45] list
[52:46] you will see one on number one and
[52:47] number two and number three
[52:49] and then all the rest could come like in
[52:51] order
[52:52] in terms of relevance after that right
[52:55] but we have persons making meaning that
[52:58] i am seeing it like actively
[53:00] every day there are persons making
[53:02] decisions and then
[53:03] not understanding meaning that they are
[53:05] persons making decisions
[53:07] doing purchases and then they don't have
[53:10] money
[53:11] enough money to travel to work they
[53:14] don't have enough money
[53:15] to buy lunch while it is that they're at
[53:17] work because they have budgeted poorly
[53:21] right so we spoke about the rainy day
[53:23] fund
[53:24] and and basically like emergency fund
[53:28] right your rainy day fund is basically
[53:30] topped up when it is at your salary
[53:31] coming so just in case that something
[53:33] does pop up
[53:34] right and two two tires boost at the
[53:37] same time
[53:38] or your glasses break and you need to
[53:40] dip into the rainy day fund
[53:42] then that's topped up when it is that
[53:43] your salary comes in because what you
[53:45] don't want to do
[53:46] is you don't want to be reeling from
[53:48] different things that happen
[53:49] and basically disturbing your budget
[53:52] so what i have the first line should be
[53:56] should be um third in charity
[53:59] and like offering then you should have
[54:02] like savings mapped out so you have your
[54:04] savings
[54:05] so you could have a savings line as as
[54:08] early as you suck
[54:09] line should be a savings so if you want
[54:11] to save 500
[54:12] or you want to save 100 it should
[54:14] actually be taken out
[54:15] and put aside what it is that we tend to
[54:18] try to do
[54:19] is we tend to we tend to pay pay bills
[54:22] here do this here do this here i want to
[54:24] do this
[54:25] and when it is that we don't know we're
[54:26] trying to save what's left which is
[54:28] normally zero so you have to understand
[54:32] if it is that you want to save
[54:33] you need to be able to do it in an
[54:35] upfront manner because
[54:36] because it's not easy it's not going to
[54:38] happen by itself
[54:40] it's not going to translate into savings
[54:42] by itself right
[54:44] so you need to be able to plan that out
[54:46] and you need to put aside some of your
[54:47] savings first
[54:48] now of course stuff do pop up but when
[54:51] it is that you do that with the
[54:52] with the type of i'm like intent that
[54:55] you have
[54:55] you will realize that you're able to
[54:57] make progress because some persons
[55:00] could add up time now time and money is
[55:02] valuable
[55:03] right some places could add up the
[55:05] amount of time
[55:06] and they could say well if it is that i
[55:08] had saved twenty dollars
[55:09] for every month that i've worked i would
[55:12] actually have a bigger savings fund than
[55:14] what it is that i have presently
[55:16] right and the reason that you have
[55:17] situations like that is because police
[55:19] are not able to put aside their savings
[55:22] or what they believe is savings is not
[55:25] savings because it's not savings when it
[55:27] is that you put aside money
[55:29] and then it's spent on something else
[55:31] that is not a savings
[55:33] right that is that is something that you
[55:36] are saving for
[55:37] but it's not part of your savings right
[55:39] so we need to be able to understand that
[55:41] right so the last thing that i wanted to
[55:44] start so i want to basically wrap up
[55:46] here by just
[55:46] touching a little bit about um proverbs
[55:51] six right so proverbs six we we spoke
[55:55] about go to the ant
[55:56] consider hallways and be wise but i want
[55:59] to start from proverbs six
[56:00] verse one it says my son
[56:04] if thou be surety for thy friend or thou
[56:07] has
[56:07] stricken that in hand with a stranger
[56:10] all right i wanna skip
[56:11] to verse three do this now my son
[56:15] and deliver thyself when thou had come
[56:18] into the hand of thy friend
[56:19] go humble thyself and make sure thy
[56:21] friend
[56:22] right so basically um the old you old
[56:26] english like for surety just in case
[56:28] that you're not aware is for going into
[56:30] debt
[56:31] right so it's in my son if thou be
[56:33] surety for thy friend
[56:35] or if thou has stricken thine hand with
[56:37] a stranger
[56:38] so for example a stranger could mean the
[56:40] bank
[56:41] so going into debt with a bank so the
[56:44] bible is actually telling you what you
[56:46] can do it's saying
[56:47] do this now so verse 4 it says
[56:50] give not sleep to thine eyes nor slumber
[56:54] to thine eyelids
[56:55] right so it's a lot of jargon there
[56:59] right or or it appears to be complex
[57:02] give not sleep to thine eyes
[57:04] nor slumber terrain to thine eyelids so
[57:07] basically what this says
[57:09] is hard work you can go and relax
[57:13] yourself
[57:14] and sleep if it is that you know that
[57:16] you're in debt basically
[57:18] so for example we know in trinidad that
[57:20] we have cases of it
[57:22] you'll lend somebody money and so on and
[57:25] it taken ages to pay you back
[57:27] and then you see them up the road eating
[57:29] an ice cream cone on a friday night
[57:31] after they eat some hot dog and burger
[57:33] and so on and stuff like that and you're
[57:34] like
[57:35] when am i gonna get it right so what
[57:38] it's saying here is for give not sleep
[57:41] to thine thing eyes nor slumber to thine
[57:44] eyelids
[57:45] right and then verse five it goes
[57:47] deliver thyself
[57:49] as a row from the hand of the hunter
[57:52] and as a bird from the hand of the
[57:55] fowler
[57:56] right so it says deliver thyself as a
[57:58] rule from the hand of the hunter
[58:01] and from the and as a bird from the hand
[58:03] of the fowler
[58:05] right so basically what it's saying now
[58:08] i don't know if it is that
[58:09] that you may have seen um i'm like an
[58:12] animal channel sometimes but sometimes
[58:14] they have these
[58:15] these gazelles and these days and
[58:16] whatnot and stuff like that
[58:18] and you know that they're not just
[58:19] videotaping just please
[58:21] i'm like to say normally they plan those
[58:23] things because they know that they are
[58:24] predators very close
[58:26] that are looking to hunt and anytime
[58:28] that there's a day
[58:29] even when it is that you see it in
[58:30] movies and stuff like that you hear a
[58:32] little crackle
[58:33] and there the head basically goes up and
[58:36] they
[58:36] already in sprint mode they're already
[58:38] looking to get out of whatever
[58:39] circumstance that's coming their way
[58:40] because they not show
[58:42] um what is going on right so
[58:46] it says deliver thyself as a role from
[58:48] the hand of the hunter and has a bullet
[58:50] from the hand of the fowler
[58:52] so what happens is as soon as he bear or
[58:54] whatever creature hears the noise
[58:56] they basically speed off they basically
[58:59] begin to run for their life
[59:01] because they know that their life may be
[59:03] in jeopardy so
[59:04] what this is saying here in proverbs is
[59:07] if it is that you are gone
[59:08] into debt now it's not it's not saying
[59:10] that um that you shouldn't
[59:12] there there are cases this this
[59:14] generation actually does have it tough
[59:16] there are decisions that you need to
[59:17] make and sometimes you may need to
[59:19] right but what it's saying is if it is
[59:21] that you would have wandered into debt
[59:23] so just in case that you made a mistake
[59:25] and you get caught
[59:27] because they say that you could win a
[59:28] flat screen tv when it is that you sign
[59:30] up for this fifty thousand dollar loan
[59:32] and they say that you can get a free
[59:33] t-shirt when it is a you take a twenty
[59:34] thousand dollar vacation loan
[59:37] and they say that you have a chance to
[59:38] win a uh uh
[59:40] um ipad when it is that you sign up for
[59:42] this credit card and so forth and so
[59:44] forth and so forth
[59:45] what it's actually saying here is
[59:48] even if it is that you wandered into
[59:50] that you should be running out
[59:52] as fast as you can right you should be
[59:56] running out as
[59:57] fast as you can right
[1:00:01] so basically that is that is why it is
[1:00:05] that you
[1:00:05] that it banks pretty much they try to
[1:00:08] prevent you
[1:00:08] and whatnot and stuff no they are
[1:00:10] necessary stuff i mean
[1:00:12] it's it's hard for you to own a home
[1:00:14] right now with all the banks
[1:00:16] but there are other things that you need
[1:00:18] to be able to plan for and in fact the
[1:00:20] number one thing right the number one
[1:00:23] thing that actually
[1:00:24] affects young people today i could tell
[1:00:26] you is that
[1:00:27] as soon as they begin working after one
[1:00:30] year or two years
[1:00:31] they are they going to take out a brand
[1:00:33] new car
[1:00:35] right so i'm just going to touch on how
[1:00:37] this works really really quickly right
[1:00:38] so i know the mats in my head because i
[1:00:40] normally work it out i normally
[1:00:41] calculated
[1:00:42] so a 200 000 car right actually at the
[1:00:46] interest rates that are present
[1:00:48] would work out to about 264
[1:00:51] 000 when it is that you go over the
[1:00:53] spread of these seven years
[1:00:55] right but just for numbers sake just to
[1:00:57] keep it easy for us here
[1:00:58] let's just use 250. so a 200 thousand
[1:01:02] dollar car which is brand new
[1:01:03] and and just be mindful right the
[1:01:07] the reason that the bank could afford to
[1:01:09] give zero percent done
[1:01:11] on a car is because they know that it's
[1:01:14] a safe bet
[1:01:16] they know that it's really really safe
[1:01:17] for them to be able to grant you a car
[1:01:19] and sign on the loan i mean like they
[1:01:21] have like the insurances in place
[1:01:23] they basically mapped out the plan in
[1:01:25] place they they know what it is that
[1:01:26] they are doing
[1:01:27] right somebody who takes out a car they
[1:01:29] are sure to pay for it
[1:01:31] right like the only thing that has a
[1:01:33] lower unlike interest rate than a car
[1:01:35] is is house online basically right so
[1:01:38] akai is a safe bet for the bank
[1:01:39] so they could afford to do zero percent
[1:01:42] financing
[1:01:43] which gives the opportunity for a lot of
[1:01:44] young persons who have not won
[1:01:46] had like a rainy day fund or have like
[1:01:49] the emergency fund
[1:01:50] they are now able to qualify and sign up
[1:01:52] for this brand new car
[1:01:55] i'm like in essence they are spending
[1:01:57] future money
[1:01:58] money that they haven't had as yet they
[1:02:01] are booking themselves up for the future
[1:02:05] in the process so you spend two hundred
[1:02:08] thousand it's a two hundred thousand
[1:02:09] dollar car
[1:02:10] you're spending two hundred and fifty
[1:02:12] thousand dollars over seven years
[1:02:14] but at the end of the seven years it's
[1:02:17] now worth a hundred thousand dollars
[1:02:19] resale value
[1:02:21] so that's a hundred and fifty thousand
[1:02:23] dollars that's that's automatically lost
[1:02:25] because of the value of the car because
[1:02:27] of them depreciation right now
[1:02:30] some persons will say that hey i could
[1:02:33] live with that because it's the
[1:02:34] convenience of a car
[1:02:35] and so on and so on and stuff like that
[1:02:38] but
[1:02:39] there are still stuff that they are not
[1:02:40] seeing
[1:02:42] right so just like um just like in
[1:02:44] proverbs as well they say
[1:02:46] um who would build a tower not commonly
[1:02:49] cost
[1:02:50] right so for example persons don't
[1:02:53] calculate
[1:02:54] the unlike insurance 37 years
[1:02:58] they don't calculate tires over seven
[1:03:00] years they don't calculate like the
[1:03:01] upgrading rims that they want to get
[1:03:04] the upgrade any any song system that
[1:03:06] they want to do
[1:03:07] the extra tint that they want to change
[1:03:09] after three years
[1:03:11] they don't they don't consider how much
[1:03:14] gas that is gonna cost them over the
[1:03:15] lifetime of these seven years yes
[1:03:17] gas is going to be there i'm like
[1:03:19] whether it's our old car or nuka
[1:03:22] but considering you spend 250 000 for a
[1:03:25] 200
[1:03:27] 000 car you get back a hundred thousand
[1:03:29] right
[1:03:30] you're thinking that hey at least i got
[1:03:32] back something right
[1:03:33] but you're still not calculating that
[1:03:35] there's a lot of factors still
[1:03:39] so so in essence this is why it's such a
[1:03:41] setback and we don't know it
[1:03:43] because it's easy for money to disappear
[1:03:45] that way not just like the depreciation
[1:03:47] of the car
[1:03:48] but it's easy for you to have spent
[1:03:50] another hundred and fifty thousand
[1:03:52] dollars
[1:03:53] because if it is that i run running mats
[1:03:55] very very simple
[1:03:56] on on gas and i say it's 500 a week
[1:03:59] five by four that's two thousand two
[1:04:02] thousand by twelve
[1:04:03] uh that's twenty four thousand twenty
[1:04:06] four thousand by seven
[1:04:08] that's a hundred and sixty eight
[1:04:09] thousand so just in gas alone you
[1:04:12] basically wiped away like the extra
[1:04:13] hundred thousand that you believe that
[1:04:15] you're getting back
[1:04:16] right but it's get it gets better than
[1:04:18] that remember that i was talking about
[1:04:20] society and the fact that we like
[1:04:22] feedback
[1:04:23] there's a there's a great chance that
[1:04:25] after seven years
[1:04:26] we're not looking to cash in on the car
[1:04:28] and begin to walk the street then
[1:04:30] we're looking for upgrade we're looking
[1:04:33] we're looking like the elevated status
[1:04:35] at that point in time
[1:04:36] so you know what we get into another
[1:04:40] car loan which actually gives us a
[1:04:42] further setback of income
[1:04:45] right and this is basically the web that
[1:04:48] a lot of
[1:04:48] millennials or a lot of young persons
[1:04:51] are getting caught up into because it's
[1:04:52] so easy it's so cool
[1:04:54] for them to say hey i got shorter new
[1:04:57] car
[1:04:58] but they need to be able to count the
[1:04:59] cost because whatever
[1:05:01] income that you have coming in now if it
[1:05:03] is that you sell it out in the future
[1:05:05] that means that you are giving up on
[1:05:08] your economic future
[1:05:09] because you are making decisions now
[1:05:11] that will impact you later on in life
[1:05:13] right and these are choices that we need
[1:05:15] to be able to live with and these are
[1:05:17] considerations that we need to make
[1:05:19] right so nothing wrong with assessing
[1:05:21] that hey
[1:05:22] akai is to take me from point a to point
[1:05:24] b i could sacrifice because you know
[1:05:26] what there are other decisions in life
[1:05:28] that may
[1:05:28] matter more there's other i make
[1:05:31] decisions like having
[1:05:33] i'm like the emergency fund now we spoke
[1:05:35] about now
[1:05:36] mine might know nothing is wrong with
[1:05:38] somebody having a fantastic car
[1:05:40] a great car we thank god for it we bless
[1:05:43] god for it
[1:05:44] but we have a lot of young persons that
[1:05:46] are in situations now
[1:05:49] and they blame the government right the
[1:05:51] government not providing enough housing
[1:05:54] the government not providing enough tax
[1:05:56] relief the government
[1:05:57] this the government should be doing more
[1:05:59] right and so on and so on
[1:06:01] and we basically complain complain but
[1:06:04] body body body choices the decisions
[1:06:07] that we had to make that would have
[1:06:08] changed things
[1:06:10] right we didn't make those tougher
[1:06:11] decisions
[1:06:13] right so so nobody nobody will remember
[1:06:15] when it is that you drove a
[1:06:17] grover beta team for five six years when
[1:06:20] it is that you bring out a brand new car
[1:06:22] after after having an emergency fun and
[1:06:24] after have any financial piece when you
[1:06:26] drive out your brand new car
[1:06:28] they're gonna forget about all those old
[1:06:30] things right they're gonna forget all
[1:06:32] about it
[1:06:33] so this is why you need to be able to
[1:06:35] budget you need to be able to stop green
[1:06:38] which is essential it's much more
[1:06:40] essential than
[1:06:41] given upgrade for the future
[1:06:46] right so we need to be able to take
[1:06:48] consideration of these things
[1:06:50] so there's persons there's persons that
[1:06:52] take vacation loans
[1:06:54] i mean i'm like in our society they take
[1:06:56] they take loans for a lot of a lot of
[1:06:58] stuff
[1:06:59] a lot of stuff that they may not
[1:07:00] necessarily need to
[1:07:02] now think about it the same math that i
[1:07:04] would there you take a loan at a
[1:07:06] particular value you're gonna be paying
[1:07:07] back more
[1:07:09] right and it's what substance or what
[1:07:12] value that you actually get right now
[1:07:14] for business it might be totally
[1:07:15] different
[1:07:16] for business purposes and whatnot and
[1:07:18] stuff you need you need to think about
[1:07:20] that differently
[1:07:20] but whereas consumerism is and we live
[1:07:23] in a very consumerous
[1:07:25] nature meaning that we purchase to
[1:07:26] consume and if it is that you clean up
[1:07:29] your house around christmas time
[1:07:30] there's a lot of stuff that i wish that
[1:07:32] i didn't buy
[1:07:35] there's always a lot of stuff around
[1:07:37] your home that you wish that you didn't
[1:07:38] buy
[1:07:40] right so
[1:07:46] so basically like in closing i just want
[1:07:49] us to be conscious
[1:07:50] and i hope i hope that we're able to
[1:07:52] have a future conversation about
[1:07:54] about how it is that we could we could
[1:07:56] apply some budget and maybe some
[1:07:58] templates and and so on to really help
[1:08:00] the younger persons
[1:08:02] navigate because just just like there
[1:08:04] are a lot of temptations and so on in
[1:08:06] this world
[1:08:07] they are they are definitely a lot of
[1:08:10] peer pressure there's
[1:08:11] there's temptation there's there's
[1:08:13] always a temptation for you to spend
[1:08:15] money right and we need to
[1:08:19] to evaluate and look at it and look at
[1:08:22] down the road because many of us are not
[1:08:23] thinking
[1:08:24] january six months down the road one
[1:08:26] year down the road five years downgrade
[1:08:28] when it is that the bible tells us that
[1:08:30] a good man leaves an
[1:08:32] inheritance for his children's children
[1:08:34] right that
[1:08:35] that already means that we should be
[1:08:36] thinking dongnu that we should be
[1:08:38] thinking generational
[1:08:39] that we should be thinking about
[1:08:42] safeguarding
[1:08:43] safeguarding yourself safeguarding your
[1:08:44] future so just in closing
[1:08:47] i believe that this is this is this is
[1:08:50] where it is that i want to
[1:08:51] close right here in saying again
[1:08:54] i believe that we all start on a very
[1:08:57] very straight line meaning that when we
[1:08:58] start off
[1:08:59] our careers financially
[1:09:03] right there is a actually a more
[1:09:06] straight part or there's a straight part
[1:09:08] to the finish line more than you think
[1:09:10] there's actually a really straight part
[1:09:12] to the finish line
[1:09:14] right but the decisions that we make is
[1:09:16] the ones that make us
[1:09:17] very left and right and sometimes we end
[1:09:20] up spending years to
[1:09:21] to get burned and just spent up in mud
[1:09:23] and realizing that that there are
[1:09:25] certain decisions that we should not
[1:09:26] have made and so on and stuff like that
[1:09:28] so i tend to i tend to mention to
[1:09:31] to my people and so on try not to make
[1:09:33] the same mistakes in life twice
[1:09:37] there's so much stuff to do try not to
[1:09:39] make the same mistakes over and over so
[1:09:40] once you learn
[1:09:41] learn from one once
[1:09:44] you'll learn from it so that you can
[1:09:46] move on and you can make progress
[1:09:48] right so this straight line right
[1:09:51] actually gives us that path with a
[1:09:53] financial piece
[1:09:54] it's up to us to basically stay on that
[1:09:56] straight line
[1:09:57] so based on that i actually did some
[1:09:59] calculation because
[1:10:01] i i really love math because maths must
[1:10:04] kind of help me to navigate
[1:10:06] budgeting and so on and stuff like that
[1:10:07] and once i know maths is like
[1:10:09] linked to finance and to increase and we
[1:10:11] need to be aware of the flux
[1:10:14] and any cattle that we have in stock
[1:10:16] according to what it is that the bible
[1:10:17] says
[1:10:18] that means that you need to be in charge
[1:10:20] of your finances right
[1:10:22] so so i've run some maths
[1:10:25] if it is that somebody at the age of 20
[1:10:27] years old
[1:10:28] right was earning three thousand dollars
[1:10:31] from the age of 20
[1:10:32] to the age of 50 they would have
[1:10:34] actually earned over a million dollars
[1:10:37] right and that's at the at the average
[1:10:40] salary of three thousand dollars
[1:10:42] now we know that there's a lot more
[1:10:43] reasons we'll control far more than that
[1:10:45] now i don't expect business to save a
[1:10:47] hundred percent of your salary
[1:10:49] right but just think about if it is if
[1:10:51] it is that you could have
[1:10:52] held on to 50 if it is that you could
[1:10:55] have held on to
[1:10:56] 25 right by making wise financial
[1:11:00] decisions
[1:11:00] right then that that would actually give
[1:11:03] you
[1:11:04] some more financial peace in terms of
[1:11:06] thinking about grain that you would have
[1:11:07] stored up for when
[1:11:08] for when the farming comes up right
[1:11:11] there's actually
[1:11:12] stats that shows that um like within
[1:11:14] like the us
[1:11:15] there's more persons that are fearful of
[1:11:19] the fact that they have not planned for
[1:11:21] unlike retirement
[1:11:23] there's a lot of reasons that know that
[1:11:24] they have not saved
[1:11:26] i'm like enough and there's even more
[1:11:27] persons that are fearful of it
[1:11:29] right so we need to understand what role
[1:11:32] that it plays
[1:11:33] in terms of where it is that we go there
[1:11:36] there are scriptures that could actually
[1:11:38] guide us in terms of moving a little by
[1:11:40] little
[1:11:41] inch by inch foot by foot is how it is
[1:11:44] that we could gain grounds
[1:11:46] right and basically we can make progress
[1:11:50] so uh so i hope that what it is that i
[1:11:52] shared has been a blessing to you
[1:11:54] and i'm looking forward for if it is
[1:11:56] that we do have future discussions
[1:11:58] um on on this particular subject because
[1:12:01] while it is that we prepare for the
[1:12:03] spiritual
[1:12:04] right definitely we need to have our our
[1:12:06] affairs and finances in order in terms
[1:12:08] of planning in terms of budgeting
[1:12:10] because we want to be in a position that
[1:12:12] we could be a good samaritan
[1:12:14] we want to be in a position that when
[1:12:16] january comes
[1:12:17] and is the middle of january and some
[1:12:20] certain places don't have money
[1:12:22] to travel to work that you're able to
[1:12:23] external land in hand and so on and
[1:12:25] stuff like that
[1:12:26] we we can't all all be in the same
[1:12:28] position
[1:12:29] thinking impulsively and
[1:12:33] so what so what i'm like if it is that
[1:12:34] you have to put up the same christmas
[1:12:36] tree from last year
[1:12:41] so what if it is there you go get the
[1:12:43] splash paint this year
[1:12:45] you'll still make it through right
[1:12:49] right so thank you so much i want to
[1:12:52] pass you over
[1:12:53] um to the pastor thanks so much for the
[1:12:55] session and i hope that has been
[1:12:57] um that it's been a blessing
[1:13:05] praise the lord thank you for andrew and
[1:13:07] this time i want to put the pastor
[1:13:08] joined by
[1:13:09] isaac he has been the main anchor for
[1:13:11] the bible studies for this year
[1:13:13] and but isaac god bless you god
[1:13:16] thank you thank you brother andrew and
[1:13:18] um god bless you church
[1:13:20] and um i don't know i feel like
[1:13:24] um it's the end of the school team
[1:13:27] when will it say this is the last one
[1:13:28] for this year i feel like uh
[1:13:31] i don't know a principal or
[1:13:33] [Laughter]
[1:13:35] you know and i really want to thank um
[1:13:37] everyone for being here tonight i want
[1:13:39] to really appreciate brother andrew that
[1:13:40] was
[1:13:41] really really an inspiration and it's
[1:13:44] just really mind-blowing
[1:13:46] uh to me how god has really blessed us
[1:13:49] and you know i was just thinking there's
[1:13:52] so much in scripture
[1:13:54] and um i was sharing with brother ovid
[1:13:56] you know somebody shared something with
[1:13:57] me and when i saw it i was like whoa you
[1:14:00] know so i just want to share this with
[1:14:01] you quickly
[1:14:02] before i kind of just kind of sum up um
[1:14:04] this bible study process but in
[1:14:06] luke 2 um saint luke
[1:14:09] 2 and this
[1:14:12] i want to take it from
[1:14:14] [Music]
[1:14:16] uh luke 2 verse 40
[1:14:19] speaking about jesus and i'm just going
[1:14:21] to give some closing comments
[1:14:23] uh before we wind down so saint luke 2
[1:14:26] and verse
[1:14:26] 40 and the child this is speaking about
[1:14:29] jesus grew and
[1:14:30] wax strong in spirit filled with wisdom
[1:14:34] and the grace of god was upon him so
[1:14:37] this is young jesus
[1:14:39] now his parents went to jerusalem every
[1:14:41] year at the feast of the passover
[1:14:44] and when he was 12 years old so this is
[1:14:47] the 12 year old jesus
[1:14:48] they went up to jerusalem after the
[1:14:50] custom of the feast
[1:14:52] so the custom of the feasts would mean
[1:14:54] that they were used to doing this
[1:14:56] and when they had fulfilled the days as
[1:14:58] he returned
[1:14:59] so they would have left the child jesus
[1:15:01] carried behind in jerusalem
[1:15:04] and joseph and his mother knew not of it
[1:15:07] but they supposing him to have been in
[1:15:10] the company so it was a group so they
[1:15:12] made
[1:15:12] the assumption that jesus was you know
[1:15:14] within the group as they were leaving
[1:15:16] they went a day's journey and they
[1:15:18] sought him
[1:15:19] among their kin spoke and acquaintance
[1:15:21] so as if it was a caravan and jesus
[1:15:23] hadn't been one of the buses so
[1:15:24] you know and they're looking for him and
[1:15:26] when they found him not they turned back
[1:15:28] again to jerusalem seeking him
[1:15:31] and it came to pass that after three
[1:15:33] days they found him in the temple
[1:15:35] sitting in the midst of the doctors so
[1:15:37] the king james version will call it
[1:15:39] doctors or the
[1:15:40] translation will speak to teachers both
[1:15:42] hearing them and ants
[1:15:43] and asking them questions and all that
[1:15:46] heard him were astonished at his
[1:15:48] understanding
[1:15:49] and answers and when they saw him they
[1:15:52] were amazed
[1:15:54] and his mother said unto him son why
[1:15:56] hast thou
[1:15:57] thus dealt with us in other words why
[1:15:59] why are you move so with us
[1:16:01] behold thy father and i have sought thee
[1:16:03] soaring so
[1:16:04] you know we we they're stressed out
[1:16:06] trying to find out where you at what's
[1:16:07] going on why
[1:16:08] why you move so and he said unto them
[1:16:10] how is it
[1:16:11] that you sought me wistia not that i
[1:16:14] must be about my father's business
[1:16:17] and they understood not the saying which
[1:16:19] he speak unto them
[1:16:21] and he went down with them and came to
[1:16:22] nazareth and was subject unto them but
[1:16:24] his mother kept all these things
[1:16:26] in her heart and jesus increased in
[1:16:28] wisdom and stature and in favor with god
[1:16:31] and man and really when you watch
[1:16:34] luke's account of you know and this is
[1:16:37] the
[1:16:37] season you know we know jesus wasn't
[1:16:39] born in december but this is still the
[1:16:41] season when
[1:16:42] people you know recount you know quality
[1:16:45] christmas story or or
[1:16:47] you know or the birth of jesus but when
[1:16:49] you look at luke's account and luke was
[1:16:50] a doctor so he's
[1:16:52] he's very detailed in how he is
[1:16:54] narrating and expressing this
[1:16:56] after the birth of jesus this is the
[1:16:58] first
[1:17:00] you know call it public appearance was
[1:17:02] the first encounter we have of jesus are
[1:17:04] we seeing something
[1:17:05] you know and it is a statement that must
[1:17:07] be about my father's business but i want
[1:17:09] to
[1:17:10] not even focus on that i want to focus
[1:17:11] on the context of it
[1:17:13] and the reality was jesus was asking and
[1:17:16] answering questions on something and
[1:17:18] that something was scripture
[1:17:19] because that is all that there was to
[1:17:21] relate about
[1:17:22] so the very first time we have jesus
[1:17:24] saying something or an encounter
[1:17:26] was jesus was basically in a bible study
[1:17:28] it was a bible study
[1:17:30] between jesus and the learning men of
[1:17:32] the day discussing scriptures and here
[1:17:34] it is jesus at 12
[1:17:36] is asking questions he's answering
[1:17:38] questions and he's astonishing
[1:17:40] not just those who were there but his
[1:17:41] own family as well
[1:17:43] and i'm in and i'm bringing that to
[1:17:44] before to really highlight how god has
[1:17:47] blessed us with these bible studies
[1:17:49] because bible study is something that
[1:17:51] god himself loves
[1:17:53] jesus didn't go with his parents to
[1:17:55] leave jerusalem
[1:17:56] because he wanted to have some time
[1:17:58] discussing these scriptures
[1:17:59] asking questions sharing things with the
[1:18:02] with with the learning men of the day
[1:18:04] and there's so much
[1:18:06] richness there's so much truth there's
[1:18:08] so much power
[1:18:09] in scripture that is such a a blessing
[1:18:12] and we cannot exhaust it
[1:18:14] and what is mind-blowing i said to
[1:18:15] brother over because i i spoke with
[1:18:17] andrew
[1:18:18] you know and i had that conversation
[1:18:19] with him about planning and we're just
[1:18:20] looking at the new year and stuff like
[1:18:22] that and
[1:18:22] you know as we were talking and he
[1:18:24] started share you know some things you
[1:18:25] were seeing i i called brother
[1:18:26] and i say you know i want to ask andrew
[1:18:29] to say a few words you know and
[1:18:31] and um and it really such a blessing
[1:18:35] and to see and i share with over that
[1:18:37] you know when the disciples had to pay
[1:18:39] their taxes
[1:18:40] jesus didn't tell them one pray he told
[1:18:41] me one fish and then the fish had the
[1:18:43] coin
[1:18:44] and i started to look at scripture and i
[1:18:47] said you know the bible
[1:18:48] speaks about our health the bible speaks
[1:18:50] about our families
[1:18:51] the bible speaks of our walk with god
[1:18:53] the bible speaks about your daily life
[1:18:56] the bible speaks about your temperament
[1:18:58] your bible speaks about your interaction
[1:19:00] the bible speaks about maturity and
[1:19:02] maturing the bible speaks about your
[1:19:03] inheritance
[1:19:04] the bible speaks about your purpose your
[1:19:06] bible speaks about your calling
[1:19:08] the bible speaks about god's for
[1:19:09] knowledge the bible speaks about the
[1:19:11] fact that all things work together for
[1:19:13] good
[1:19:13] so so the bible itself as as as the core
[1:19:18] instrument of life and to understanding
[1:19:20] that that we
[1:19:21] could speak scripture from a position of
[1:19:23] authority
[1:19:24] through the ministry of a prophet who
[1:19:26] was to bring that fought light
[1:19:28] to tie up all the loose ends to reveal
[1:19:30] every mystery so when we go into
[1:19:32] scripture
[1:19:32] it is clear to us we are so privileged
[1:19:35] uh to be able to see what we see so i am
[1:19:38] i am excited i am very very happy and i
[1:19:40] believe that
[1:19:42] god has shown us all so many things in
[1:19:44] this year
[1:19:45] and this 2020 has been a turning point
[1:19:48] for us
[1:19:49] and i look forward uh to what god will
[1:19:51] do by his grace in 2021
[1:19:53] and yes brother andrew we will we will
[1:19:55] do many more sessions
[1:19:57] because i believe that god wants us to
[1:19:59] be complete christians
[1:20:00] he is entrusted with iran i'm said in
[1:20:02] every aspect of our lives and i think
[1:20:04] that is a real powerful statement
[1:20:06] so god is interested in every aspect of
[1:20:09] our lives
[1:20:09] if he can county hear on your head he's
[1:20:12] interested in every aspect of your lives
[1:20:14] and if
[1:20:14] it is written in scripture the bible
[1:20:16] said all scripture
[1:20:18] is given for encouragement for guidance
[1:20:21] for however you want to look at it so
[1:20:23] there's no verse in the bible that is
[1:20:25] there by accident in fact but ibrahim
[1:20:26] said
[1:20:27] if you don't see jesus in every verse in
[1:20:30] every word
[1:20:31] go and read it again because he is there
[1:20:33] you know so i really feel inspired and i
[1:20:35] really feel strengthened and i really
[1:20:37] believe
[1:20:38] that when you look back to i think it
[1:20:39] was daniel was one of the first studies
[1:20:41] that we did
[1:20:42] and then we went through so many uh in
[1:20:44] the new testament we went through a
[1:20:46] series in the book of kings and
[1:20:47] there's so many wonderful wonderful and
[1:20:50] i want to encourage you in
[1:20:51] in this season you know relax and go
[1:20:54] treat again take notes
[1:20:56] and and encourage yourself in the lord
[1:20:58] and we look forward for our wonderful
[1:20:59] wonderful time
[1:21:00] uh you know both for the rest of this
[1:21:02] year and into the new year so as
[1:21:04] it said um we didn't announce it before

[1:22:00] of that vision and i certainly want to
[1:22:03] continue to pray for the church so at
[1:22:04] this time let us just bow heads
[1:22:07] for word of prayer gracious heavenly
[1:22:09] father we thank you tonight
[1:22:11] lord and in this closing of this chapter
[1:22:15] of these zoom meetings for 2020 and lord
[1:22:19] to cap it off lord with
[1:22:21] lord how you are so interested in every
[1:22:22] area of our lives lord and to know that
[1:22:25] we have to be better decision makers
[1:22:28] lord it applies in the spiritual it
[1:22:30] applies in the natural it applies in our
[1:22:32] marriages
[1:22:33] it applies in our affairs on the job it
[1:22:35] applies in our finances
[1:22:38] lord and to see lord as whether andrew
[1:22:41] was speaking
[1:22:42] you know there was a study we did on the
[1:22:44] discipline of the word
[1:22:46] you know and i said you know this whole
[1:22:48] thing of budgeting and these things
[1:22:50] it comes down to having a discipline it
[1:22:52] comes down to
[1:22:53] not being distracted it comes down to
[1:22:55] having a focus it comes down to
[1:22:57] giving thought before action of not
[1:23:00] being
[1:23:01] hasty of not flying off the handle of
[1:23:04] having
[1:23:04] confidence and trust in you to know that
[1:23:07] it was little by little they were
[1:23:09] supposed to possess the land
[1:23:11] that land that joshua and and it was
[1:23:13] what there was little by little and to
[1:23:14] see the
[1:23:15] the the pattern of scripture the
[1:23:17] unfolding of your mind
[1:23:19] that our character is formed in steps
[1:23:22] add to your faith virtue and the virtue
[1:23:24] knowledge and it's not all at once but
[1:23:26] it's a step by step
[1:23:28] of adding and adding and adding and
[1:23:30] dying and dying and
[1:23:31] making progress and sometimes it's a
[1:23:34] grind sometimes
[1:23:35] it is not all about flash but it's about
[1:23:37] that discipline because it's a race and
[1:23:39] we understand the race is not for the
[1:23:41] swift but it is for those that endure to
[1:23:43] the end and
[1:23:44] lord we thank you for the vision and the
[1:23:47] inspiration
[1:23:48] lord to use the technology during this
[1:23:51] pandemic
[1:23:51] lord to be able to lord give to this
[1:23:54] sacrifice this commitment this effort
[1:23:57] lord to the bible studies and the zoom
[1:23:59] prayer meetings and the
[1:24:00] online services and all of these
[1:24:02] different things lord that

[1:24:06] may you be their reward father lord how
[1:24:09] you

[1:24:13] lord at 12 years old there you are
[1:24:16] discussing scripture
[1:24:17] understanding questioning giving answers
[1:24:20] and to see
[1:24:20] that you were described it as you had to
[1:24:22] be about your father's business and
[1:24:24] here we are tonight about our father's
[1:24:26] business lord
[1:24:27] searching in the word how we should live
[1:24:30] how we should act
[1:24:31] lord because you have given us a rule
[1:24:33] book a playbook of you have given us
[1:24:35] lord your thoughts in word that we can
[1:24:38] lord
[1:24:39] understand your mind on every matter at
[1:24:41] any point in time we could see your
[1:24:43] thought on the different matters
[1:24:45] so help us lord through your word lord
[1:24:47] as we come to the end of this class of
[1:24:49] 2020 if i could say that lord that
[1:24:51] we could graduate from this class lord
[1:24:54] with a change in our thinking a change
[1:24:56] in our behavior
[1:24:57] a change in our thought process that we
[1:24:59] could be more sincere we could
[1:25:01] be more consecrated we could be more
[1:25:03] dedicated so lord may you bless your
[1:25:05] people
[1:25:06] lord as we go through this this season
[1:25:08] lord of of this christmas and the new
[1:25:10] year and this time
[1:25:12] of reflection and it was a burden in my
[1:25:14] heart to
[1:25:15] see a time of reflection a time of
[1:25:17] introspection
[1:25:18] and the same lord if we had a time we
[1:25:20] could we could take every topic we could
[1:25:22] take
[1:25:22] we could take every every issue and we
[1:25:24] could we could dig deeper and deeper and
[1:25:26] deeper so we

[1:26:03] to us that our effort is not in vain and
[1:26:05] the labor is having an effect lord and
[1:26:08] lord
[1:26:09] to know that when this year started we
