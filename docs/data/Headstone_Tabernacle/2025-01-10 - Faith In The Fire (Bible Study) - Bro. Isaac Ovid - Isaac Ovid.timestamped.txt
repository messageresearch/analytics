[15:39] precious name of Jesus Christ and the
[15:41] church says
[15:43] amen and amen so we are together again
[15:48] it has been uh quite some time that we
[15:51] have had one of these sessions and by
[15:53] the grace of God we are looking to have
[15:55] a time with the Lord um by the grace of
[15:57] God we intend to have these Bible
[16:00] studies every other week so it should be
[16:02] prayer meeting Bible study prayer
[16:03] meeting Bible study you you get it there
[16:05] so
[16:07] um
[16:09] uh I want to it's it's it's it's it's
[16:13] somewhat uh touching because I I have a
[16:16] thought tonight on fire and I got a note
[16:20] a short while ago um of a home I think
[16:23] the Phillips home in Gonzalez that was
[16:25] consumed by fire today and um it is just
[16:31] the timing of the message and we want to
[16:33] certainly remember them in prayer I'm
[16:35] not sure what the situation is there but
[16:37] I remember being in that home as a young
[16:39] boy so we want to remember the family um
[16:41] in
[16:42] prayer and I was thinking about fire and
[16:46] how fire is such a consuming thing and
[16:48] how fire is such a powerful thing and um
[16:52] my title for this Bible study tonight is
[16:55] faith in the fire because life and and I
[16:58] believe may have said it a few times
[17:01] that if you don't become unbreakable
[17:05] life will break you you know life is
[17:08] designed a certain way and even God
[17:11] operates a certain way fire is something
[17:12] that's really powerful and it's it's
[17:14] it's part of what God is so I have a few
[17:17] scriptures here to speak about fire and
[17:19] then I want to go to a specific context
[17:21] in the Old Testament but just to kind of
[17:24] lay uh a foundation tonight we have in 1
[17:28] Peter 4 12 where Peter is saying beloved
[17:31] think it not
[17:33] strange concerning the fiery trial which
[17:37] is to try you as though some strange
[17:41] thing happened unto you and as we are in
[17:45] 2025 I believe it was oest night I had
[17:48] the honor of speaking to the church and
[17:50] I was speaking about reframing your
[17:53] thinking to address that difference in
[17:56] what is happening to me versus what
[17:59] happening for me and what we see here is
[18:01] Peter reframing the thinking of those
[18:04] he's addressing by saying think it not
[18:07] strange in other words I want you to
[18:09] rethink something he said think it not
[18:11] strange he's addressing he's directly
[18:14] addressing their thinking he's saying
[18:16] think it not strange concerning the
[18:19] fiery trial which is to try you so
[18:23] there's a purpose behind the fiery trial
[18:25] as though some strange thing happened to
[18:27] you so our trials our situations our
[18:31] oppressions and and we have heard this
[18:33] before but we are being reminded by the
[18:35] word tonight that it's not a strange
[18:37] thing in other words the opposite of
[18:40] strange is actually a familiar thing
[18:42] meaning we by now should be a customed
[18:45] to dealing with pressure dealing with
[18:47] situations dealing with surprises
[18:50] dealing with things that we have not
[18:51] experienced before because this is all
[18:54] to try us and when you're putting
[18:56] someone on a trial example you put
[18:58] somebody in a job you put somebody in a
[19:00] position you put somebody into a new
[19:01] environment to try them in that role the
[19:05] whole objective of a trial or a test is
[19:08] to see if you can handle
[19:10] something it there there is no value in
[19:13] testing you on the same thing over and
[19:15] over again I I I want to repeat that
[19:17] there is no value in testing you on the
[19:20] same material again imagine if you go to
[19:23] form one and then you move from form one
[19:25] to form two and they give you the form
[19:26] one test again and you move from form
[19:29] two to form three and they give you the
[19:30] form one test again and he move from
[19:32] form three to form four and they give
[19:33] you the form one test again there's no
[19:35] value in that because as you move from
[19:37] step to step the test or the trial that
[19:41] is to try you is supposed to move in
[19:44] parallel with what you are being exposed
[19:46] to in parallel with what you are
[19:48] preparing for So within context here we
[19:51] see in Peter saying there is a fire or a
[19:53] fiery trial that is the trial that's
[19:55] designed for all of us tonight
[19:59] and then I want to go now to the Old
[20:01] Testament Isaiah 43:2 when thou passest
[20:04] through the waters I will be with thee
[20:07] that's a comfort now Isaiah 43:2 when
[20:11] thou passest through the waters I will
[20:13] be with thee and through the rivers they
[20:16] shall not overflow thee when thou West
[20:20] Through the Fire thou shal not be burned
[20:22] what an
[20:24] encouragement that no matter what the
[20:26] situation you are going through whether
[20:28] you're going going through the waters
[20:29] I'll be with you you're going through a
[20:31] river that trying to push you here or
[20:33] there they shall not overflow thee so
[20:36] there are limits to the trials that come
[20:38] your way so in other words the trials
[20:40] and the situations and the obstacles and
[20:42] the opposition is not meant to destroy
[20:45] you it's not meant to make you fail it's
[20:47] not meant to overwhelm you it's not
[20:49] meant to make you drop your hand in the
[20:50] air and say I don't want to serve God
[20:52] anymore it is designed to bring out the
[20:56] best in you and God is saying in all all
[20:58] of these things I will be
[21:00] there so the question tonight is are you
[21:03] seeing God in your trial are you seeing
[21:06] God in your fire are you seeing God in
[21:09] your
[21:10] flood are you seeing God in each of
[21:13] these
[21:14] situations Deuteronomy 4:24 for the Lord
[21:18] thy God is a consuming fire he him he
[21:20] himself is fire can the church say Amen
[21:23] all right first Peter 1:7 this is just
[21:27] for a foundation before we get into
[21:29] into what we want to address tonight 1
[21:31] Peter 1:7 that the trial of your faith
[21:35] being much more precious than of gold
[21:38] that perisheth though it be tried with
[21:41] fire might be found unto praise and
[21:44] honor and Glory at the appearing of
[21:48] Jesus
[21:50] Christ First Corinthians 3 verse
[21:53] 13 Every Man's work shall be made
[21:57] manifest
[21:59] I want to pause there for a minute every
[22:01] man's work shall be made
[22:04] manifest in other words there's a
[22:07] proving time there's a revealing time
[22:09] there's an unveiling time there's a
[22:11] manifestation time of of your work of
[22:14] who you are of what you represent of
[22:15] your efforts of what you have been
[22:17] working on there's a display that is
[22:19] coming that will make visible all of
[22:23] your prayer life all of your study all
[22:26] of your academic Pursuit all of your
[22:29] career Pursuit all of your spiritual
[22:31] Endeavor whatever you count as your
[22:33] works every man's work shall be made
[22:36] manifest for the day shall declare it
[22:38] because it shall be revealed by
[22:41] fire and the fire shall try every man's
[22:44] work of what sort it is in other words
[22:47] it is only through fire we can really
[22:49] see the stuff you're made
[22:53] of so if you want to prove the metal of
[22:56] a man if you want to prove the substance
[22:58] of of a woman if you want to prove the
[23:00] caliber of someone put them under
[23:02] pressure put them in a fire and we will
[23:06] see the work that they are the quality
[23:10] what material they are made of because
[23:13] if it's a flaky flimy material the fire
[23:16] will just make it just just destroy but
[23:18] but if it's if it's gold then the fire
[23:21] starts to filter out impurities because
[23:23] it's not being proven as gold that's
[23:26] stried in the fire
[23:29] Revelation 3:18 I counsel thee to buy of
[23:33] me gold tried in the
[23:36] fire that thou mayest be rich so the
[23:38] counsel here is not just to buy
[23:42] gold it is gold that has been tried in
[23:46] fire because take gold and put it under
[23:49] the pressure put it under Fire put it
[23:52] under the condition of more heat anybody
[23:56] with me tonight you will understand if
[23:58] it's quality or
[24:00] not so what we are being encouraged here
[24:03] by the word and by the scripture because
[24:05] it's it's faith in the fire we are being
[24:07] encouraged tonight to level up to to to
[24:11] climb higher because we want to make
[24:12] sure that the substance the quality the
[24:15] experiences we have if we see it for not
[24:19] what is happening to me but what is
[24:21] happening for me can I handle more
[24:25] because more pressure is only going to
[24:27] bring on more
[24:28] you know how many times in life people
[24:31] have the option and the opportunity to
[24:33] give
[24:35] up every day we are faced with the
[24:38] opportunity to give
[24:40] up I want you to dig into that a little
[24:43] bit every single day there's an
[24:46] opportunity to give up to give up means
[24:48] you lose your cool and you blow off a
[24:51] handle and the version of yourself you
[24:53] thought you left a long time ago shows
[24:55] his head again that's giving up giving
[24:58] up can mean walking away from a marriage
[25:00] giving up could mean walking away from
[25:02] your testimony but something holds you
[25:04] and says don't give
[25:06] up there's a businessman somewhere who
[25:09] is on the verge of should I give up or
[25:11] not there's somebody who is holding on
[25:14] and and the whole issue of giving up
[25:15] means the intensity of the fire has
[25:18] pushed them to an edge and the message
[25:21] tonight is to keep having faith in that
[25:24] fire because if you can have faith in
[25:27] the fire knowing that God will be with
[25:29] you in the fire you're going to make it
[25:33] through every success every achievement
[25:37] was made with the opportunity or the
[25:39] option to give up I want to say that
[25:42] again somewhere along the journey
[25:44] whether it is invention Discovery trial
[25:48] and error we look at someone like Elon
[25:50] Musk and Space X and all the attempts to
[25:53] get the rocket up and it was got it
[25:55] wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong and then
[25:57] it start to get right
[25:59] mistake mistake mistake mistake and then
[26:01] success fire fire fire opportunity to
[26:04] quit opportunity to give up opportunity
[26:06] to walk away opportunity turn up and
[26:08] this is the challenge now when we say
[26:10] they don't make them like they used to
[26:11] make years ago because years ago people
[26:14] had no choice to fight because if we
[26:15] didn't fight that was it but now people
[26:18] feel comfortable with giving up people
[26:20] feel comfortable with saying I
[26:24] quit this is why even in the Army
[26:27] there's something call a desert you
[26:28] deserve the Army is a it's like a they
[26:30] will lock you up because if everybody
[26:34] quit in in the middle of the war you
[26:36] imagine you going to war and this people
[26:37] start to abandon you brother poell
[26:39] imagine you about to attack and you're
[26:41] about to charge and at he point you
[26:43] about to charge people have to walk away
[26:45] from the fight and is you alone on the
[26:47] attack how you'll feel you know what
[26:49] happens if you not solid you give it up
[26:52] to you know because you recognize is you
[26:55] against the Army all by yourself so the
[26:58] encouragement tonight friends in 2025
[27:01] because it is harder it is tougher it is
[27:04] more difficult it is more challenging it
[27:06] is more overwhelming more people are
[27:09] talking about the pressure and the
[27:10] strain and the stress and the anxiety
[27:13] and being overwhelmed and it's all this
[27:15] and what it is is the world itself
[27:18] before the actual purification fire that
[27:21] is that that that that the prophet spoke
[27:22] about this whole world will be consumed
[27:24] by fire we are going through a fiery
[27:27] experience to separate those who are
[27:29] going to make it from those who will not
[27:30] make it can the church say
[27:36] Amen so tonight as we go a little
[27:40] deeper I found myself looking at three
[27:46] familiar characters in scripture we have
[27:49] never spent time talking about them too
[27:53] much because they were part of a bigger
[27:56] narrative and we focus the bigger part
[27:58] of the narrative so we are really
[28:01] heading tonight to the Book of
[28:03] Daniel and within the Book of Daniel as
[28:06] we know uh there are a number of
[28:09] characters in The Book of
[28:12] Daniel and we talk about the the Hebrew
[28:15] boys right the three Hebrew boys
[28:18] Shadrach mesach and Abednego and we
[28:20] would have had a couple
[28:22] references uh to them the subject of the
[28:25] main part of where we will be tonight
[28:27] will be in in Daniel 3 but is worthy of
[28:32] touching where it actually all began
[28:35] which is in Daniel
[28:37] 1 which is really the Exile that period
[28:41] of Exile where Daniel shad mishak and
[28:45] abeno were being unwillingly forced to
[28:49] move from their homeland of Israel
[28:53] almost across 1,000 miles of desert more
[28:58] than likely in Chains more than likely
[29:01] in conditions that they did not hope to
[29:04] be in like to be in chose to be in
[29:06] desire to be in but be it as it may they
[29:10] had to deal with life as life dealt with
[29:12] them so to speak and despite the
[29:15] opposition despite the situation despite
[29:18] what they were something happened that
[29:20] allowed them to maintain their testimony
[29:23] even though things were not the way they
[29:25] would have liked it to be and I want to
[29:27] say that again because many times we
[29:29] have a picture of how we like things to
[29:31] be and we end up with excuses and we end
[29:34] up with blaming people because of you
[29:37] know if it was different I would have
[29:38] been different if I had a little more
[29:40] money I would have been different if I
[29:42] had a different family maybe if I had a
[29:44] different whatever you know but here it
[29:46] was being forced against their will
[29:49] Daniel and the three Hebrew boys are
[29:51] pushed into a spot where they are being
[29:54] tried by fire and then we'll get into
[29:57] the actual literal fire so just by way
[30:00] of
[30:04] background I want to just touch
[30:09] on Daniel 1: 1-3 we would have touched
[30:13] this a few years ago just as a
[30:14] background to before we jump to Daniel 3
[30:16] itself in the third year so we in Daniel
[30:19] 1 verse one in the third year of the
[30:21] reign of jeim king of Judah
[30:24] Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon came to
[30:28] to Jerusalem and besieged
[30:30] it and the lord gave jeim king of Judah
[30:34] into his hand with some of the Articles
[30:37] of the house of God which he carried
[30:40] into the land of Shina to the house of
[30:42] his God and he brought the Articles into
[30:45] the Treasure House of his God which is
[30:48] the god of bell who was a chief god of
[30:50] the
[30:51] Babylonians then the king instructed
[30:53] asanas the master of his unics to bring
[30:56] some of the children of Israel and some
[30:59] of the king's descendants and some of
[31:01] the
[31:03] Nobles as a background a few Generations
[31:07] earlier the nations of Judah had turned
[31:09] away from God so this here is really
[31:12] Judgment at work it's the hand of God
[31:15] allowing things to happen to unveil the
[31:18] entire Master Plan of Redemption and all
[31:20] the pieces of the puzzle as it were on
[31:22] God's chest board and the nation of
[31:24] Judah had backslid and followed other
[31:26] gods so God judge them and allow the
[31:29] Babylonians to conquer them ancient
[31:32] Babylon as we know is modern day
[31:35] Iraq and I would have said before Saddam
[31:37] Hussein when he was alive was quoted as
[31:39] saying he's a modernday King
[31:42] Nebuchadnezzar a lot of the young men
[31:44] were taken back to Babylon and Daniel
[31:47] was one of them verse four young men in
[31:50] whom there was no blemish but goodlook
[31:54] gifted in all wisdom so so the king is
[31:57] not looking for vagabonds he's not
[31:58] looking for people who have no purpose
[32:00] people who not trying to be something
[32:02] people are not trying to be you know on
[32:05] top of their game they were gifted in
[32:06] all wisdom that's a powerful statement
[32:08] gifted in all wisdom possessing
[32:11] knowledge and quick to understand look
[32:14] at the description we we touched on this
[32:16] before but it's worthy of repeating
[32:18] again in 2025 what kind of learner are
[32:21] you what is your approach to wisdom what
[32:23] is your approach to
[32:26] knowledge can we repeat this
[32:29] again young men in who there was no
[32:31] blemish but good-look gifted in all
[32:34] wisdom young and wisdom normally don't
[32:37] go hand
[32:39] inand so this there was something unique
[32:42] about these young men that they would be
[32:45] young yet gifted in all wisdom they
[32:47] would be possessing knowledge this has
[32:50] to be more than spending time scrolling
[32:52] Facebook and Instagram and Tik Tok and
[32:54] spending time watching TV series and
[32:57] movies and
[32:58] even watching the news being politically
[33:00] aware because it says possessing
[33:02] knowledge quick to understand gifted and
[33:04] wisdom and who had the ability to serve
[33:07] in the king's
[33:09] Palace do you have the ability to serve
[33:12] in the king's Palace do you have the
[33:14] protocol of the understanding of
[33:16] protocol the the the knowledge of how to
[33:18] approach
[33:19] people so in other words the promotion
[33:23] and the value we see on Daniel and the
[33:26] three Hebrew boys this was their resumes
[33:28] you
[33:30] know can we can we look at this can we
[33:33] can we talk about this a bit the Daniel
[33:36] who we admire started somewhere the
[33:38] Hebrew boys we admire started somewhere
[33:40] they starting somewhere was a a
[33:43] interview of sort because there had to
[33:45] be a process to identify them the
[33:47] command of the king to asanas was to
[33:50] bring some of the children of Israel and
[33:53] some of the king's descendants and some
[33:55] of the Nobles the word I want to
[33:58] highlight is some some of the children
[34:00] of Israel some of the king's descendants
[34:03] and some of the Nobles in other words
[34:05] don't bring everybody find some and when
[34:08] you want to find some of something you
[34:10] don't choose the the lower end of the of
[34:13] the pick you try to get the best of the
[34:17] pick and I've said it to the CH before
[34:19] when I was in school and they had
[34:20] football in school and something like
[34:22] that and they picking people for the
[34:23] football team they would say well we
[34:25] picking you first picking you second
[34:27] when they finished pick first second
[34:29] third fourth my name was not
[34:31] there I was not part of the sum who was
[34:34] picked because I was not qualified to be
[34:36] a football player anybody is with me
[34:38] this evening so the point I wanted to
[34:41] identify here is that these young men
[34:44] who were picked who were part of the
[34:46] sum who were qualified to even advance
[34:51] in their career both naturally and
[34:54] spiritually had a foundation that was
[34:57] Rock call
[34:59] it what are you doing with your time
[35:01] because this description is not
[35:03] accidental we could argue that no
[35:06] blemish might have been
[35:07] hereditary we could argue goodlook could
[35:10] have been the grandfather or the
[35:13] grandmother maybe gifted in all wisdom
[35:16] maybe it's environment but possessing
[35:18] knowledge quick to understand ability to
[35:21] serve in the king's Palace that is a
[35:23] function of you being in a position of
[35:26] mentorship and experience and fire and
[35:29] that's your wrong way this is the right
[35:30] way people don't like to hear as your
[35:32] right way as your wrong way people like
[35:34] to hear as we say in Trinidad we like it
[35:38] so but this is forcing a paradigm shift
[35:41] a reframing of our thinking that as a
[35:44] Christian as a Believer you could be
[35:47] quick to understand you could possess
[35:49] knowledge you could have the ability to
[35:51] serve in the king's Palace and not a
[35:53] Israelite King not a king of Judah only
[35:56] not a king of the North or the King of
[35:58] the South but serve in any King's
[36:01] Palace anybody with me tonight we're
[36:04] building something and whom I'm still
[36:07] reading verse four they might teach the
[36:09] language and literature of the
[36:13] Chans so these young men had to be more
[36:17] than well I know Jewish history and I
[36:19] know the history of the north and I know
[36:21] the history of the South and I
[36:22] understand Abraham and Moses and Joshua
[36:25] and and and and David and other to be
[36:27] able to flexible enough to learn
[36:29] something
[36:30] new because it's a requirement of the
[36:32] role it's a requirement of the
[36:34] environment it's a requirement of the
[36:36] conditions can the church say
[36:39] Amen Daniel was a young man probably
[36:42] around 16 years old or so and he would
[36:45] stand before royalty these were young
[36:48] men we are
[36:49] addressing stand before royalty in the
[36:52] king's
[36:54] Palace so it's around 16 or so
[36:58] by around 19 he's expected to serve
[37:00] before the king so I think it was around
[37:01] three years or so they would have spent
[37:03] their three years of training as it was
[37:05] so around 16 or so he was put in a
[37:08] captivity because in verse five it says
[37:10] and the King appointed for them a daily
[37:13] provision of the king's Delicacies and
[37:14] of wine which he drank and three years
[37:17] of training for them can you take
[37:21] training so that at the end of that time
[37:24] they might serve before the king in
[37:26] other words the king saying
[37:28] and I want us friends I'm speaking here
[37:31] tonight and I'm trying to get to my
[37:33] subject and I can't get to the subject
[37:35] because I want us to look again at the
[37:37] resume and then the training these men
[37:40] were already gifted they already
[37:42] possessed knowledge they already quick
[37:44] to understand they already had the
[37:46] ability to serve in the king's Palace
[37:48] they were clearly qualified to learn the
[37:51] language and literature of the Chans and
[37:53] they still had to go through three years
[37:56] of training
[37:59] so that at the end of that time the
[38:01] Bible says they might serve before the
[38:03] king in other words the king came with
[38:04] all of the
[38:05] resume and this is the challenge we see
[38:07] today in the workplace there are young
[38:09] people who come out of University and
[38:12] they have no work experience so they
[38:13] don't have the training because a degree
[38:15] is not the training a degree is some
[38:17] knowledge that has not been tested it
[38:19] has not been proven you don't know what
[38:21] it is to sit in front of a director and
[38:23] be challenged on your thinking being
[38:25] limited or otherwise and you may
[38:27] assumptions based on a lack of
[38:29] experience you have to go through some
[38:31] training and as the same thing in the
[38:33] army of the Lord you have potential you
[38:35] have ability you have knowledge you
[38:37] bring a certain skill set but every
[38:39] single son that come to God must be
[38:40] tried must be tested must build
[38:43] experience you can't come today and be
[38:45] able to sit in certain seats you're
[38:49] unqualified anybody with
[38:52] me it's a is a is a shifting of mindset
[38:56] a shifting of thinking that is necessary
[38:58] and this is one of the reasons why
[39:00] people end up
[39:02] failing because they're not ready for
[39:04] training they are very eager and anxious
[39:07] to go and do things and then they wrap
[39:09] up or end up into failures that could
[39:11] have been avoided because they were not
[39:14] placed in the environment to properly
[39:16] grow anybody with
[39:20] me verse 6 of Daniel 1 and now from
[39:25] among those of the sons of Judah would
[39:27] Daniel hananiah Mel and
[39:31] Azariah to them the chief of the Uno
[39:34] gave names he gave Daniel the name belto
[39:38] shaza to hananiah Shadrach to Michel
[39:43] mesach and to Azariah
[39:48] Abednego Hebrew names are very
[39:53] important because to them they signified
[39:58] Destiny the blessing and how God was
[40:00] going to use them you would remember
[40:02] when we preach about Joshua and
[40:05] Ephesians and the placing of the birth
[40:09] place of the name back then how they
[40:11] would grown and travail epim and the
[40:14] naming happened in the birth because the
[40:16] name was an identification of where they
[40:18] would be in the land are we are we
[40:23] here so naming is important and I want
[40:27] to to look so it it meant and when you
[40:29] study history the names themselves it is
[40:33] very evident that the strategy of
[40:36] renaming them was not
[40:39] random because their names had specific
[40:43] meanings and the new names they give
[40:46] them had specific
[40:49] meanings
[40:51] So
[40:53] Daniel means my judge's Elohim
[40:58] Bel Taza the name they change it to
[41:01] means B is my
[41:04] judge so it changed who the judges from
[41:07] Elohim to their
[41:10] deity in other words they trying to
[41:12] redefine his identity are you with me
[41:17] hananiah who is the one uh to Daniel to
[41:22] Hanah Shadrach Hanah means under
[41:24] yahweh's grace Shadrach means under
[41:27] aku's
[41:31] command Michel who is what God is mishak
[41:34] who is what Aku is so each of these
[41:36] names they were given them was with an
[41:38] understand in other words like what is
[41:40] your name what is your name okay so I
[41:41] given you a different name and the name
[41:44] they are giving you is an attempt to
[41:46] change by name your
[41:49] identity it is an attempt to change your
[41:51] purpose it is an attempt to change your
[41:54] calling and I would have said this 5
[41:56] years ago you could rise above the
[42:00] labels or the names that people put on
[42:04] you because names could be powerful
[42:07] sometimes and and a name is not just the
[42:09] name you call or the name you are given
[42:11] or the name that you go by but people
[42:13] end up being caught up in names of even
[42:16] situations so somebody can name you or
[42:18] label you a
[42:20] failure people walk around with names of
[42:24] alcoholic that that's a name it's an
[42:26] identifi you know the alcoholic man who
[42:28] was live in that house without needing
[42:31] to call his government name as we say
[42:33] you know who who they talking
[42:36] about because names carry with it an
[42:40] association of behavior of qualities of
[42:42] characteristic of history of Destiny of
[42:46] purpose everybody with me so I'm just
[42:50] laying on background here because I
[42:52] don't want to spend too much
[42:54] time on this aspect
[42:59] but verse 8 but Daniel purpose in his
[43:01] heart that he would not defile himself
[43:03] with the portion of the king's decies
[43:05] nor the wine which he drank therefore he
[43:08] requested of the chief of the Uno that
[43:10] he might not defile
[43:13] himself and here we see Daniel is making
[43:16] a choice he's making a decision in a
[43:19] place that's not his own in an
[43:20] environment that is on his own with the
[43:23] opportunity because many of us in
[43:25] Opportunities or situations where nobody
[43:27] is monitoring us nobody's policing us
[43:29] nobody's overseeing us we take a crack
[43:32] we take a try we take we we end up into
[43:35] a road that we shouldn't be in because
[43:37] we don't have internal discipline and
[43:39] internal accountability and because we
[43:41] haven't gone through enough to trust God
[43:43] to be and and I want to just pause here
[43:45] for a minute friends if you really trust
[43:48] God love God you will serve him or
[43:52] no the challenge is there are people who
[43:56] claim to believe and they ready don't
[43:57] believe because if you believe God is
[44:00] real and you believe this word is real
[44:02] and you believe this word is truth and
[44:04] you believe there's a purpose for your
[44:05] life and you believe you are
[44:06] predestinated and you believe you are
[44:08] called and you believe you're an
[44:09] overcomer and you believe you are called
[44:11] to something greater and you believe
[44:13] that that that there's there's another
[44:16] place there's another dimension there's
[44:17] another realm that only perfect love
[44:19] could take you there then why would you
[44:21] lower yourself on a daily basis to the
[44:23] kindal things of this world anybody with
[44:25] me tonight
[44:27] So Daniel in the king's environment with
[44:31] access to the finest thing could still
[44:33] say no I don't want that no I don't want
[44:35] that no I will not have that no I reject
[44:37] that why the label they put on him the
[44:40] environment he was in was not more
[44:43] powerful than the seed in him that let
[44:45] him know who he
[44:47] was and this applies to us as young
[44:50] people it applies to us as adults it
[44:53] applies to us as parents to understand
[44:56] that the seed in us is what should
[44:58] Define our Behavior our attitude our
[45:00] conduct our word what we eat where we
[45:03] live how we deal with situations how we
[45:05] deal with conflict how we deal with
[45:07] challenges how we deal with issues can
[45:10] the church say
[45:12] amen I like that scripture Daniel
[45:16] purposed in his
[45:18] heart by the will of the Lord by the
[45:21] grace of God I want you to do a Bible
[45:22] study soon on aligning a few words mind
[45:26] heart
[45:27] purpose and will there are four
[45:29] different
[45:30] things and if these four things are in
[45:33] Conflict you live a miserable
[45:36] life mind heart purpose and will here we
[45:42] see Daniel purposed in his
[45:45] heart purpose is a powerful thing if you
[45:48] do not know your purpose you will be
[45:50] abused you will be
[45:53] abusive Daniel purpose in his heart so
[45:57] he's connecting purpose and heart so
[46:00] take note of these four words you can
[46:02] start to study it because it maybe the
[46:03] subject by the grace of God of my next
[46:05] Bible study mind heart purpose and will
[46:09] half the problems we get into is when
[46:11] our mind and half not in
[46:13] alignment issues in homes with parenting
[46:16] is many times mind and heart you love
[46:19] him or no your mind say disciplining but
[46:20] your heart feel too
[46:22] sorry and that conflict creates a state
[46:24] that the child will get the right
[46:26] correction because your heart soft your
[46:28] mind knows you wrong thing but your
[46:30] heart your heart
[46:32] weak that's why the Bible say as a man
[46:35] think in his heart alignment mind and
[46:38] heart will and purpose Lord if it's
[46:40] possible this is Jesus let this come
[46:42] pass nevertheless not my will but D be
[46:45] done his thought was walk away but he
[46:48] understand will so you have to connect
[46:49] mind heart purpose and will here we see
[46:53] Daniel purpose in his heart connecting
[46:55] Purpose with heart that he would not
[46:57] defy himself with a portion of the
[46:59] king's
[47:00] Delicacies the king's Delicacies could
[47:02] be anything you know much Delicacies
[47:04] come into us every
[47:06] day all kind of different
[47:09] Delicacies and it's not the the the man
[47:11] in his street is it King's Delicacies
[47:13] know people want to get access to the
[47:15] king's Delicacies but Daniel purpose in
[47:19] his heart that when he see the king's
[47:23] Delicacies the purpose in his heart was
[47:26] more powerful than the attraction of the
[47:28] king's
[47:30] Delicacies this is not thing you need to
[47:32] pay for is being offered to him the
[47:34] king's Delicacies meant it was prepared
[47:36] for the king you know how much people
[47:37] want to eat like the King live like the
[47:40] king be like the king you know how much
[47:42] discipline and conviction you must have
[47:45] to see food going to the king and say I
[47:48] don't want
[47:49] it anybody with me purpose in your heart
[47:53] friends to be a Christian purpose in
[47:56] your heart to be a real man a real woman
[47:58] we have so few of them the one or two
[48:02] that do it stand out but always said
[48:04] years ago the difference between
[48:06] ordinary and extra extraordinary is just
[48:08] the extra because so many people are
[48:11] ordinary just a little extra make it
[48:13] extra ordinary we live in such a world
[48:15] of mediocrity and complacency and
[48:18] accepting things as they are that the
[48:20] moment you do one or two or three things
[48:22] different you breaking
[48:24] records anybody tonight you could break
[48:27] records tonight your faith could break a
[48:30] record tonight your confidence could
[48:32] break a record tonight your joy could
[48:34] hit a new level on the on the on the
[48:37] measuring scale tonight your confidence
[48:39] in the Lord could hit a whole new level
[48:42] on the confidence scale tonight your
[48:44] sleep could be better tonight on the
[48:46] confidence scale because your hope and
[48:48] your trust and your faith is in the Lord
[48:52] I don't know if this is helping somebody
[48:55] tonight but I believe it I believe it
[49:00] is could you take some
[49:04] more what are you purposing in your
[49:08] heart because if you have a purpose in
[49:11] your heart towards your family towards
[49:14] your work we've said it before we this
[49:17] is a an an interesting conversation to
[49:20] be at the beginning of 2025 because half
[49:23] of the people who had New Year's
[49:24] resolution and bring it break it already
[49:27] how you people who set their hearts to
[49:29] do certain things that don't go through
[49:31] the window know already but if you
[49:32] purpose in your heart that this year you
[49:35] want to serve God like you've never did
[49:38] before and it's a purpose in your heart
[49:40] and you approach every day I salute you
[49:43] for being here
[49:45] tonight I salute you for not taking it
[49:47] for granted I salute you for being
[49:50] diligent and aggressive about your heart
[49:54] about your the destination of your soul
[49:57] all right so let's jump to our
[50:00] substantive scripture tonight Daniel 3
[50:04] and we will spend the rest of the
[50:06] session
[50:07] there by the grace of
[50:10] God so here we we we jump in The
[50:13] Narrative of the story in Daniel Daniel
[50:15] 3 finds us in a very interesting spot
[50:17] we're in the Book of Daniel but in the
[50:19] entire of this chapter of Daniel 3
[50:21] Daniel is not
[50:23] here Daniel is noticeably absent because
[50:27] the picture of this narrative does not
[50:30] include
[50:31] Daniel and that is interesting because
[50:33] if you look at the Book of Daniel Daniel
[50:35] is the main
[50:37] character and I it almost speaks
[50:39] interestingly that here it is because
[50:42] many of us if the main character is
[50:43] there there's a boost there's a
[50:44] confidence we roll in the pastors around
[50:46] the the leaders around the captain of
[50:48] the ship when you see the captain like
[50:50] there's there there are times you know
[50:52] you you're on a plane and you see the
[50:53] captain walk the aisle if ever
[50:56] experience the captain of the plane or
[50:59] the pilot walk the
[51:01] aisle you're G nervous like there is the
[51:05] the the autopilot that they has put the
[51:07] plane on but you get a little
[51:09] nervousness when you see the pilot
[51:12] walking the aisle eating food because
[51:14] the question I have is who is
[51:16] flying the plane because if the pilot is
[51:20] not in the
[51:21] cockpit who is flying the plane so
[51:24] there's always a comfort when the lead
[51:27] or the main persons around but in this
[51:29] chapter 3 of Daniel the word Daniel
[51:31] doesn't even
[51:32] appear Nebuchadnezzar the King Daniel
[51:36] 3:1 made an image of gold whose height
[51:39] was three score cubits which is around
[51:42] 90 ft that's massive and the bread
[51:45] thereof of six Cubit which is 9 ft
[51:47] that's massive and he set it on the
[51:50] plane of dura in the province of Babylon
[51:53] so it's a incredible
[51:55] structure his tree would tell us that
[51:57] this would not have been solid gold more
[52:00] than likely it was a wooden structure
[52:01] overlaid by
[52:04] gold then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent
[52:07] to gather together the princes the
[52:10] governors the captains the judges the
[52:13] treasurers the counselors the sheriffs
[52:17] and all the rulers of the provinces to
[52:19] come to the dedication of the
[52:25] image which neb the king had set up so
[52:29] this here is idolatry at its
[52:33] maximum it have small idols and it have
[52:35] big Idols this is a massive Idol and the
[52:39] king in the spirit of idolatry calls for
[52:43] basically based on this description
[52:45] every possible leader whether in
[52:47] government in the police whether in the
[52:49] Army whether in the Judiciary wherever
[52:51] you are from the captain look look at
[52:54] the prince royalty the governors which
[52:56] is govern to the captains military the
[52:58] judges that's Judiciary to the
[52:59] treasurers that the Ministry of Finance
[53:01] to the counselors well that could be
[53:02] anything all kind of different things to
[53:04] the the sheriffs all the rulers to come
[53:07] to the dedication so everybody who has
[53:08] any kind of title anybody who above a
[53:11] certain pay grade is in this
[53:15] thing then the princes the governors and
[53:17] it's repeating it the captains the
[53:19] judges they giving you a context of how
[53:22] serious and how much attention they
[53:25] place on idolatry I
[53:27] if there's a lesson to get here I want
[53:29] you to understand the level of attention
[53:31] being placed to idolatry because this is
[53:34] what is being described here in his
[53:36] purest sense here we're dealing with
[53:39] worship being set up is really worship
[53:41] we talk about the Hebrew boys didn't bow
[53:43] down but here it is there a dedication
[53:46] service and all of the dignitaries are
[53:48] being brought here then the princes the
[53:51] governors the captains the judges the
[53:53] treasurers the counselors the sheriffs
[53:54] and all the rulers of the provinces were
[53:56] gathered together unto the dedication of
[53:59] the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king
[54:01] had set up and they stood before the
[54:04] image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up
[54:07] then an
[54:09] Herald cried aloud to you it is
[54:13] commanded o people Nations and
[54:17] languages that at what
[54:20] time you hear the sound of the Cornet
[54:23] flute half sackbut Soldier dulmer and
[54:27] all kinds of music he fall down and
[54:31] worship so we always say bow down but I
[54:35] want you to look at the word choice here
[54:37] follow and worship the golen image that
[54:40] Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up and
[54:44] whoo fth not down and worship it shall
[54:48] the same hour be cast into the midst of
[54:52] a burning fiery furnace
[54:56] so here we have a situation where
[54:58] there's a call for worship but there's
[55:01] also a consequence of non
[55:07] worship here we have a whole set of
[55:09] attention to the instrumentation the
[55:12] music there's a call and response so
[55:15] when you hear music behave a certain
[55:19] way I find it's just an interesting
[55:21] parallel because here we are in Trinidad
[55:23] here now and we about to go into the
[55:25] carnival SE season call and response is
[55:28] a big part of Carnival everybody put up
[55:31] your hand everybody do this everybody
[55:32] jump everybody wave every call and
[55:34] response there's some music there's a
[55:36] behavior that's expected it's
[55:38] worship everybody with me
[55:42] tonight so I want you to understand that
[55:45] what we go through now and go through
[55:46] here is nothing new you know it's the
[55:48] same spirits that set things up here you
[55:51] have a stage you have a idol you have
[55:53] people getting told whenever you hear
[55:55] the music start stop what you're doing
[55:57] and worship and if you don't worship
[55:59] you're going to the fire the very
[56:05] hour let's go whosoever fth not down and
[56:09] worship it shall the same hour be cast
[56:12] into the midst of a burning fiery
[56:14] furnace verse
[56:16] 7even therefore at that time when all
[56:19] the people
[56:20] heard the sound of the Cornet flute hap
[56:23] sackbut Sury and all kinds of music all
[56:26] the people the Nations and the languages
[56:29] fell down and worshiped the golden image
[56:32] that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set
[56:36] up verse 8 wherefore at that time
[56:39] certain charans came near and accused
[56:43] the
[56:44] Jews they spake and said to the King
[56:47] Nebuchadnezzar oh King live forever you
[56:49] have to admire how this approach these
[56:51] days say oh King live forever thou oh
[56:55] King has made a decree
[56:57] that every man that shall hear the sound
[56:59] of the Cornet flute H sack but Sury and
[57:02] dulma and all kinds of music shall fall
[57:04] down and worship the golden
[57:06] image and who so fth not down and
[57:09] worship it that he should be cast into
[57:11] the midst of a burning fiery furnace
[57:14] there are certain
[57:17] Jews and you know the prophet speaks
[57:19] about seron upstream and being at
[57:21] rainbow trout and going against the
[57:23] grain and the the fact is the moment you
[57:26] don't line up with what the enemy want
[57:28] there's somebody out there trying to
[57:29] disrupt your day disrupt your life
[57:31] interrupt it so so here it was this is
[57:34] not the king notice this is this is
[57:36] there are certain Jews whom thou Hast
[57:39] set over the
[57:41] Affairs so so these brothers are solid
[57:45] Brothers they are in positions of
[57:48] influence and they just have business
[57:50] with the King
[57:52] degree Hallelujah
[57:56] he said there are certain Jews whom thou
[57:58] has set over the Affairs of the province
[58:00] of
[58:02] Babylon Shadrach mesach and Abednego
[58:05] these men so these these certain Jews
[58:09] you know you know there are people who
[58:10] talk a certain way there are people who
[58:14] are like what going on and when you dig
[58:16] and dig is already one person or two
[58:19] people people who like to speak for like
[58:22] I hear a word like a few people already
[58:24] like when you're dig and diger dig is
[58:25] one person so here there are certain
[58:28] Jews who you know already lining up and
[58:32] when and as you say here when he Magus
[58:34] is really Shadrach Mish and abedo these
[58:37] these men these men oh King have not
[58:40] regarded
[58:41] thee in other words these men in the
[58:44] amplify says pay no attention to
[58:46] you I love
[58:49] it they serve not thy
[58:53] Gods nor worship the gold image which
[58:56] thou has set up friends I want to
[58:59] encourage you tonight no matter how high
[59:01] you rise in business in career in
[59:04] society in living in this terrestrial
[59:06] plane here let this be the description
[59:10] that they say about
[59:12] you that you pay no attention to the
[59:15] things of the world you do not serve
[59:17] their gods you do not worship their
[59:20] golden
[59:21] images our God is a living God he not a
[59:25] stationary static God it don't take a
[59:27] bit of music is our God don't need music
[59:30] to trigger worship we can worship
[59:32] anytime any place under any condition
[59:35] the hour cometh and now is when true
[59:37] worshippers will worship we don't need a
[59:39] call and a response to worship he
[59:42] deserves worship all the time this God
[59:44] is talking about does only get worship
[59:46] when they play all them lists of
[59:48] instruments anybody with me
[59:52] tonight verse 13 then nebuchad in his
[59:56] rage and fury commanded to bring
[59:59] Shadrach Misha and abedo now now this is
[1:00:04] interesting because this speaks volumes
[1:00:07] I want to pause here for a minute it is
[1:00:10] very evident because the king broke his
[1:00:12] own law
[1:00:13] here I want us to catch just for a
[1:00:16] minute because according to the
[1:00:19] Constitution the same time you don't bow
[1:00:21] you're supposed to go into the
[1:00:24] fire the fact that these men had to come
[1:00:26] to the king men they had to seek the
[1:00:28] king's permission as well in other words
[1:00:30] these men had to be so valuable in state
[1:00:33] in government in leadership that they
[1:00:35] had to tread carefully around them I
[1:00:37] want us to understand the context of the
[1:00:40] setup the conditions that had to exist
[1:00:42] here if you read in narrative they said
[1:00:44] the moment you don't bow there had to be
[1:00:47] a condition where they were standing
[1:00:48] there they didn't bow and they felt
[1:00:50] cautious we can't just lck them men up
[1:00:52] in
[1:00:54] know because we don't know how King will
[1:00:56] respond if he hear Shad Mish go get
[1:00:58] burned I want us to understand the
[1:01:00] context here the it is very clear the
[1:01:03] lawmakers of the day could not have
[1:01:05] taken immediate action on these stream
[1:01:07] men are you so
[1:01:10] valuable that people have to tread
[1:01:12] carefully around
[1:01:16] you did anybody catch
[1:01:19] that even the king himself I want us to
[1:01:22] understand this if the King was just
[1:01:24] going by the letter of the law he said
[1:01:25] well if you have anybody who didn't bow
[1:01:28] burn
[1:01:29] them but the Bible is saying here
[1:01:33] that the king in his rage and fury he
[1:01:36] had a choice at that time to send them
[1:01:38] to birth he commanded to bring them in
[1:01:41] other words he wanted to reason with
[1:01:45] them the only time you reason with
[1:01:49] somebody who goes against your role your
[1:01:51] rule of law because they are important
[1:01:53] to you and look at the conversation
[1:01:56] then they brought these men before the
[1:01:58] King Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto
[1:02:01] them is it
[1:02:03] true oh Shadrach mesach and Abednego do
[1:02:06] you not serve my
[1:02:08] gods nor worship the golden image which
[1:02:11] I have set up and the King goes on
[1:02:14] almost to plead for them now if ye be
[1:02:16] ready that at what time you hear the
[1:02:19] sound of The Corned flute half sagbut
[1:02:22] Sultry and DOA and all kinds of music
[1:02:24] you fall down worship the image which I
[1:02:27] have made well in the Amplified it
[1:02:29] basically
[1:02:31] says uh but if you do uh that if you are
[1:02:35] ready when you hear the sound of all the
[1:02:37] instruments which have made very good in
[1:02:39] other words the king is saying if you're
[1:02:41] ready
[1:02:43] now I want you to catch if ready now
[1:02:46] music I have a problem we could let byon
[1:02:49] be by
[1:02:54] guns but what is represents is the enemy
[1:02:57] trying to figure out if there's a way to
[1:02:59] still get you to worship the idol in
[1:03:05] know and he follows that
[1:03:10] with well but if you worship not you
[1:03:12] shall be cast the same hour into the
[1:03:15] midst of a burning fiery furnace and who
[1:03:18] is that God I like that question he say
[1:03:21] who is that God that shall deliver you
[1:03:23] out of my
[1:03:24] hands and I always say this God is a
[1:03:27] defender of his name the moment you
[1:03:30] challenge somebody challenge you they're
[1:03:31] challenging God and when they challenge
[1:03:33] God God is very well able to defend
[1:03:36] himself verse 16 we're almost done
[1:03:39] Shadrach mesak and Abednego answered and
[1:03:41] said to the king oh Nebuchadnezzar we
[1:03:44] are not careful to answer thee in this
[1:03:48] matter in the amplify that also says we
[1:03:51] do not need to answer you on this point
[1:03:53] in other words we don't owe you or
[1:03:56] response on this
[1:03:57] matter in other words the purpose in our
[1:04:00] heart is you might value US you might
[1:04:02] have position rank quality you know our
[1:04:04] resume but on this matter on this
[1:04:07] particular matter on this particular
[1:04:10] issue if it's the way the water and the
[1:04:13] electricity and the things and all the
[1:04:15] other things that's a different
[1:04:16] conversation but on this matter when it
[1:04:18] comes to worship on this matter when it
[1:04:20] comes to my God on this matter when it
[1:04:23] comes to to to to to who I God we are
[1:04:26] not careful to give you any kind of
[1:04:30] response if it be so our God whom we
[1:04:33] serve is able to Deliver Us From The
[1:04:35] Burning fiery furnace and he will
[1:04:38] deliver us out of thine hand O King but
[1:04:40] if
[1:04:42] not and I think if it's anything we
[1:04:44] could hold on to because this now is
[1:04:46] fate at a different level because many
[1:04:50] of us we say our God will deliver and if
[1:04:52] we don't see signs of it we starting to
[1:04:55] think our approach but these brothers
[1:04:58] were rooted and their purpose was strong
[1:05:00] and said if not be it known unto thee Oh
[1:05:05] King we will not serve thy Gods nor
[1:05:09] worship the golden image which thou has
[1:05:12] set up and I think as Believers we have
[1:05:15] to go beyond the we will not bow down to
[1:05:19] to if not in other words you have to be
[1:05:22] prepared for the consequence of If You
[1:05:25] Don't See a sign of Deliverance you
[1:05:27] still standing your ground because they
[1:05:28] were prepared to pay the price for their
[1:05:31] conviction and that's in challenge with
[1:05:33] many of us we are not prepared to pay
[1:05:35] the price of our conviction we are not
[1:05:37] prepared to say if God doesn't show up I
[1:05:39] am not moving from my
[1:05:42] conviction anybody with
[1:05:44] me verse 19 then was Nebuchadnezzar full
[1:05:48] of
[1:05:50] Fury and the form of his Visage changed
[1:05:54] against Shadrach m going AB B go and
[1:05:57] this is something interesting here
[1:05:59] because this is more than just his face
[1:06:01] change it is almost as if his his whole
[1:06:05] view of them changed it's almost like he
[1:06:07] was seeing them for the first time
[1:06:10] anybody with me he knew these men these
[1:06:13] men served in his Palace but it's like
[1:06:15] he start to see them for the very first
[1:06:17] time recognizing these men are not with
[1:06:19] me you
[1:06:20] know they were their
[1:06:22] God therefore he spake at that point now
[1:06:26] bear in mind at this point he didn't
[1:06:28] send them out with the music to Bow
[1:06:30] that's their response their response to
[1:06:33] his word is what made him give the order
[1:06:35] everybody W with
[1:06:38] me therefore he spake and commanded that
[1:06:41] they should heat the furnace one seven
[1:06:43] times
[1:06:45] more than it was one to be heated
[1:06:48] meaning seven times hotter than usual
[1:06:51] and I've preached this before and he
[1:06:52] commanded the most Mighty Men his elite
[1:06:56] soldiers his very best of the best that
[1:06:59] were in his army the Bible said he
[1:07:01] commanded the most mighty men that were
[1:07:04] in his army his top people to bind
[1:07:07] Shadrach Meshach and ameno and to cast
[1:07:09] them into the burning fiery
[1:07:11] furnace then these men were Bound in
[1:07:13] their coats their hosen and their hats
[1:07:16] and their other garments and were cast
[1:07:18] into the midst of the burning fiery
[1:07:21] furnace therefore because the king's
[1:07:24] commandment was urgent
[1:07:26] and the furnace exceeding hot the flame
[1:07:29] of the fire slew those men that took up
[1:07:32] Shadrach mishak and abedo in other
[1:07:35] words the very best of the King's Men
[1:07:38] died trying to put Shak mesak Ando into
[1:07:43] the fire the king
[1:07:45] lost his most elite soldiers because he
[1:07:48] was playing with the wrong
[1:07:51] ones verse 23 and I want to underscore
[1:07:54] that friends
[1:07:56] you see when Moses said the Egyptians
[1:07:58] you see today you will see them no
[1:08:00] more you will realize the enemy doesn't
[1:08:03] know when to stop
[1:08:06] you in the situation with the Egyptians
[1:08:10] they drive straight into the water and
[1:08:12] were swallowed up here it is the king
[1:08:16] underestimated these Hebrew boys and
[1:08:19] underestimated their God underestimated
[1:08:21] the situation and he lost his best men
[1:08:24] and these three men shadra mesach and
[1:08:26] abedo fell down bound into the midst of
[1:08:29] the burning fiery
[1:08:31] furnace then Nebuchadnezzar the King was
[1:08:34] astonished and Rose up in haste and
[1:08:37] spake and said unto his counselors and
[1:08:41] Rising he has a small little secret
[1:08:42] about life did not we cast listen all of
[1:08:47] up to this point is only the king all of
[1:08:49] a sudden when things start to go wrong
[1:08:51] he look around to these men around him
[1:08:53] did not we cast three men bound into the
[1:08:57] midst of the fire all of a sudden it
[1:09:01] shift from the King's Command to we are
[1:09:04] the ones responsible for this
[1:09:07] Fiasco the nature of humans to blame
[1:09:10] somebody right did not we cast three men
[1:09:12] bound into the midst of the fire they
[1:09:15] answered and said to the king true oh
[1:09:17] King he answered and said l i see four
[1:09:20] men
[1:09:21] loose Lord help us walking in the midst
[1:09:24] of the fire so this was not the Tre boys
[1:09:28] there tied up and and the fourth man
[1:09:31] standing up they were having brother
[1:09:33] Powell a whole Fellowship in the fire
[1:09:36] the Bible said they were walking in the
[1:09:38] midst of the fire this wasn't standing
[1:09:40] up hoping this thing this fire sto
[1:09:43] hoping this thing work up these brothers
[1:09:45] end up having a whole after service
[1:09:48] Fellowship as it were I would love to
[1:09:51] hear the conversation they were having
[1:09:53] in the fire
[1:09:56] what the whole concept of walking in the
[1:09:59] midst of your fire having faith in the
[1:10:01] midst of your
[1:10:03] fire can the church say
[1:10:06] amen he see and then said lo I see four
[1:10:09] men loose walking in the midst of the
[1:10:11] fire and they have no hurt and the form
[1:10:14] of the fourth is like the Son of
[1:10:16] God then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the
[1:10:19] mouth of the burning fiery
[1:10:21] furnace and spake and said Shadrach me
[1:10:25] isak and Abednego ye Servants of the
[1:10:27] most high God if is one thing you have
[1:10:30] to acknowledge is the
[1:10:33] transformation at least in verb verbage
[1:10:36] or wording of the king I can't speak to
[1:10:39] whether his heart was changed but that
[1:10:41] experience of seeing that here the
[1:10:44] king's conversation after this he came
[1:10:46] and spake in the Shad M Ando ye Servants
[1:10:49] of the most high God come forth and come
[1:10:53] hether then Shadrach mesach and Aben
[1:10:56] came forth from the midst of the fire
[1:10:58] and the princes Governors and captains
[1:11:01] and the King's counselors being gathered
[1:11:04] together saw these men upon whose bodies
[1:11:07] the fire had no power my my my my my my
[1:11:12] my can I say that again on Whose bodies
[1:11:14] of fire had no power you mean that you
[1:11:18] could live such alive that the fire have
[1:11:20] no power over your body that sickness
[1:11:23] have no power over your body that doubt
[1:11:26] have no power over your body that
[1:11:27] unbelief have no power over your body
[1:11:30] that depression have no power over your
[1:11:33] body they were witnesses that the fire
[1:11:36] had no power nor was an hair of their
[1:11:39] head
[1:11:40] sin so it wasn't as not a here had
[1:11:44] neither were their coats changed so they
[1:11:48] had the same clothes on that they went
[1:11:50] on with nor the smell of fire had passed
[1:11:54] on them
[1:11:57] church when you walk through the fire
[1:11:59] he'll be there with
[1:12:02] you this is taking it to a whole Next
[1:12:04] Level because some of us when we think
[1:12:07] about this we think well when I walk to
[1:12:08] the fire God is with me but you still
[1:12:09] will see I was burnt these brothers were
[1:12:11] not
[1:12:12] burnt when you walk through the fire
[1:12:15] with God nobody even knew you were in
[1:12:17] the fire until they talk to you until
[1:12:20] they experience a change you until they
[1:12:23] feel the strength of your character
[1:12:24] because
[1:12:26] friends walking to the fiery furnace
[1:12:29] many of us or some of us might say well
[1:12:32] King here this I will bow know because
[1:12:35] as they got closer to the fire brother
[1:12:37] popwell they start to feel the heat you
[1:12:38] know seven times
[1:12:41] hotter it is amazing to me how these
[1:12:44] three brothers kept walking together
[1:12:46] that we didn't hear about the three
[1:12:48] Hebrew boys who became two that one
[1:12:50] decide to stop walking and start to
[1:12:52] scream and say I want to go back home
[1:12:53] and I go bow down all night because I
[1:12:55] don't want to thisp fire they were they
[1:12:57] were purpose in their heart that they're
[1:12:59] not going to bow down they did not know
[1:13:02] the outcome can I say that again they
[1:13:04] had no idea how this was going to play
[1:13:07] out they did not know if God is going to
[1:13:09] come but they were prepared if God
[1:13:11] didn't come and the way God came was
[1:13:13] beyond the best way they could have even
[1:13:16] thought it was because here it was their
[1:13:19] bodies the fire had no power there was
[1:13:22] no hair of their head singed neither
[1:13:24] were their coats ex change not the smell
[1:13:26] of fire had passed on them then
[1:13:29] Nebuchadnezzar spake and said blessed be
[1:13:32] the god of Shadrach mesach and Abednego
[1:13:36] who had sent his
[1:13:38] Angel this is deep because this King
[1:13:40] that to speak about certain things that
[1:13:43] that that he really shouldn't know
[1:13:45] about he had sent his Angel and
[1:13:48] delivered his servants that trusted in
[1:13:51] him and have changed the king's word and
[1:13:55] change means to refuse the king's word
[1:13:57] and yielded their bodies that yield
[1:14:00] their bodies means surrender their
[1:14:02] bodies meaning they were willing to pay
[1:14:04] the price are you willing to pay the
[1:14:06] price of
[1:14:08] sacrifice that they might not serve no
[1:14:11] worship and a and a and a see the differ
[1:14:14] say words serve no worship any God
[1:14:17] except their own
[1:14:21] God friends if there's an idol
[1:14:25] in your life on the 10th of January
[1:14:29] 2025 it's time to cast it down if you
[1:14:33] have been bowing complying yielding
[1:14:37] responding to Idols Idols could be money
[1:14:42] it could be people it could be things it
[1:14:44] could be technology we have preached
[1:14:46] many times you can make anything your
[1:14:48] God you could even make a spirit your
[1:14:50] God you could make depression your
[1:14:52] God you remember that man who was
[1:14:54] beating up ministers in the days of the
[1:14:56] prophet and when he came in the prophets
[1:14:59] meeting the ministers ran out the
[1:15:01] platform and he Prophet stood there and
[1:15:04] he said you're going to fall over my
[1:15:06] feet and when the police officers came
[1:15:09] they say is there any help for him or
[1:15:11] whatever and he Propet say he worship he
[1:15:14] worshiped the spirit you can worship
[1:15:19] anything but here it is the king is able
[1:15:22] to identify and I my encouragement to
[1:15:24] you as a prepare to close out this
[1:15:26] session with a few verses Left let it be
[1:15:29] said about you that under no
[1:15:32] circumstances will you serve or worship
[1:15:34] anything else but the true
[1:15:40] God verse 29 therefore I make a decree
[1:15:45] that every people nation and language
[1:15:46] which speak anything a Miss against the
[1:15:49] god of Shadrach mesach and abedo shall
[1:15:52] be cut in pieces and their houses shall
[1:15:54] be made down hill because there is no
[1:15:57] other God listen to The King's words now
[1:15:59] there is no other God that can deliver
[1:16:02] after this s in the amplifi it says it
[1:16:06] there is no other God who is able to
[1:16:07] save him this way he said is the way he
[1:16:11] said this way after this sort the way
[1:16:14] this God operates there's there's no
[1:16:17] comparison there's no other God who
[1:16:18] could save like this
[1:16:20] God then verse 30 the king promoted Lord
[1:16:24] help us
[1:16:26] promoted Shadrach mishak and abendigo in
[1:16:29] the province of Babylon so after this
[1:16:32] whole thing them fellas leave this
[1:16:34] experience with a higher job a higher
[1:16:38] pay a higher
[1:16:40] position you could imagine the respect
[1:16:43] in their jobs when they say you was the
[1:16:44] one in the fire who never get burn
[1:16:46] nobody could challenge your pay at that
[1:16:48] point you know nobody can challenge your
[1:16:50] office at that point no because people
[1:16:52] know at that point your God is a mighty
[1:16:54] God nobody Crossing Shad Mig and abedo
[1:16:57] after that experience because they know
[1:16:59] that their God fight for them can the
[1:17:01] church say
[1:17:02] Amen we need to live such a life that
[1:17:05] people know that your God is on your
[1:17:08] side can we say that one more time
[1:17:11] people must know that your God is on
[1:17:13] your side he said if you stand for me
[1:17:14] I'll stand for you he said my people
[1:17:16] shall never be ashamed
[1:17:27] well we thank the Lord for
[1:17:30] tonight and for his
[1:17:32] word and for his
[1:17:36] grace and I pray that in some
[1:17:39] way that you take some lessons out of
[1:17:43] this in
[1:17:46] closing because this is the common theme
[1:17:49] between both Daniel and the Hebrew boys
[1:17:51] they clearly purposed in their heart if
[1:17:55] you take anything from this tonight
[1:17:57] Beyond dealing with the reality that
[1:18:00] fires a part of our
[1:18:06] experience in the message the
[1:18:08] handwriting on the wall brother bam said
[1:18:10] and Daniel was going to purpose in his
[1:18:13] heart he would be true to God and God's
[1:18:17] word and while he was down there the
[1:18:20] Lord could use him why could he use
[1:18:23] Daniel because had purposed in his heart
[1:18:27] and if you want to be used of
[1:18:30] God is there anybody who wants to be
[1:18:32] used of God tonight if you want to be
[1:18:35] used of God purpose in your heart that
[1:18:39] you love him and serve him and
[1:18:42] everything will be fine I want to read
[1:18:44] that one more time why could he use
[1:18:48] Daniel because he had purpose in his
[1:18:51] heart if you want to be used of God
[1:18:54] purpose in your heart that you will love
[1:18:56] him and serve him and everything will be
[1:19:01] fine can we bow our heads for a word of
[1:19:07] prayer our gracious Heavenly Father we
[1:19:10] thank you tonight for these many
[1:19:13] examples in scripture and we could take
[1:19:16] day after day meeting after meeting and
[1:19:19] never
[1:19:20] exhaust Lord what you have placed in the
[1:19:23] word to encourage us with different
[1:19:26] situations and Lord just coming to this
[1:19:28] session tonight and thinking about fire
[1:19:32] and thinking about trials and thinking
[1:19:33] about testings and situations and Lord
[1:19:37] there's such a cry among the people for
[1:19:39] so many things to know that we could
[1:19:41] have a comfort and peace in you and if
[1:19:44] we could just purpose in our heart to
[1:19:46] serve you everything would be fine Lord
[1:19:48] we thank you for the inspiration and we
[1:19:51] thank you for those who have gone before
[1:19:53] that we could look back and take faith
[1:19:54] and courage we pray dear God that you
[1:19:56] would strengthen your people tonight
[1:19:59] every brother every sister every man
[1:20:01] every woman every child every Young
[1:20:03] Brother every young sister Lord that we
[1:20:05] could withstand the attacks and the Ws
[1:20:08] of the evil one and we could stand in
[1:20:11] our day Lord and knowing that we will
[1:20:13] not bow down we will not worship any
[1:20:16] other God and even if you don't deliver
[1:20:18] father we will still stand our ground

[1:20:40] ourselves bowing down to all kinds of
[1:20:42] things that have nothing to do with you

[1:20:47] then it became something more and
