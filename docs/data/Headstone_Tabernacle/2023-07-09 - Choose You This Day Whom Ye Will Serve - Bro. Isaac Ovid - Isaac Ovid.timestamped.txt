[51:34] this service over to you in the mighty
[51:36] name of Jesus Christ and the church says
[51:39] amen and amen I'd like to welcome one
[51:42] and all this morning in the precious
[51:44] name of Jesus Christ
[51:45] if you have your Bibles
[51:48] I'd like to tune to just one portion of
[51:51] scripture reading from The Book of
[51:53] Joshua
[51:55] reading Joshua reading chapter 24
[51:59] and reading verses 15 and 16.
[52:14] reading Joshua 24
[52:17] reading verse 15.
[52:21] read it in verse 14 rather now therefore
[52:23] fear the lord
[52:26] and serve him in sincerity
[52:29] and in truth
[52:31] and put away the gods which your father
[52:34] served on the other side of the flood
[52:37] and in Egypt
[52:38] and serve he the Lord
[52:41] and if it seem evil unto you to serve
[52:44] the Lord choose you this day whom you
[52:45] will serve
[52:47] whether the gods which your father serve
[52:49] that were on the other side of the flood
[52:52] or the gods of the amorites in whose
[52:55] land ye dwell
[52:57] but as for me and my house
[53:00] we will serve the Lord
[53:02] may the lord of the blessing to the
[53:04] reading of his word
[53:06] you may be seated
[53:13] as we all know why we are in convention
[53:15] weekend
[53:16] on the great expectation for God to do
[53:19] something really powerful in omits and
[53:21] we are taught through scripture and
[53:23] reinforced by the prophet that you get
[53:25] what you expect
[53:28] you have a little expectation you get a
[53:30] little blessing but you have a great
[53:32] expectation you get a great blessing you
[53:34] have a great expectation you get a great
[53:36] reward you dig a valley and there's just
[53:39] one ditch you're not so much water you
[53:41] could hold but you dig a value full of
[53:42] ditches then you could leave with
[53:44] everything that you came to receive and
[53:46] that's not just the convention but
[53:48] that's every service that's everything
[53:49] that you do in life it is an alignment
[53:52] with your expectation with your hope
[53:54] with your level of focus and your
[53:56] attitude is what brings the results can
[53:59] the Church Say Amen
[54:01] so for a title this morning just to
[54:04] share something with the church before
[54:06] the convention and my burden here is to
[54:09] help you along the way knowing that God
[54:12] is going to bless his people over this
[54:15] weekend and I know in my heart that
[54:18] brother random taught us you have to do
[54:20] something for something to happen
[54:22] so we could only do all the best that we
[54:25] could do and then we depend on God to do
[54:26] the rest we can do all the effort all
[54:28] the sacrifice the praying the
[54:30] contribution the fixing up and all these
[54:32] things and it's just up to God to do the
[54:34] rest it's not that we sit along doing
[54:35] nothing hoping for something to happen
[54:36] but we are doing everything we can do
[54:38] looking for God to do the rest and to
[54:41] use his servants that will be
[54:42] ministering to us in a mighty way both
[54:44] who will be greeting and ministering
[54:46] both local and abroad
[54:48] so for a title this morning choose you
[54:51] this day whom you will serve
[54:54] and a subject put away the strange gods
[54:58] and an inspiration as for me and my
[55:00] house we will serve the Lord
[55:03] and I actually preached this message
[55:05] when I was in Ghana last month and I
[55:07] felt led to bring it back to the church
[55:09] directly
[55:11] now we read from the book of Joshua and
[55:13] we know Joshua is a parallel to the book
[55:15] of Ephesians it's a book of possession
[55:17] it's a book of inheritance and we know
[55:19] that this theme of this convention is
[55:21] contending for the Fate so it's about
[55:23] fighting for the Fate fighting for your
[55:25] promise fighting for your inheritance
[55:27] and with the Branham just to lay a
[55:28] foundation and I'm not going to be too
[55:30] long with you because we have a number
[55:31] of things to do after service but ride
[55:33] with me for the time that we have
[55:34] together are you with me this morning
[55:36] from the message question and answers
[55:38] but the Branham said the promised land
[55:40] is to live in this land of Holy Spirit
[55:43] that's what this is all about is to live
[55:45] in the land of the Holy Spirit that's
[55:47] God's promise for the church is to live
[55:49] in the power of the spirit it's another
[55:51] world so we are not just here to have
[55:53] church but we want to enter into another
[55:55] world Hallelujah that's what I'm looking
[55:57] for this weekend in the convention to be
[55:59] in another world I want to be
[56:00] transported to another place I want to
[56:03] be caught up in higher places I don't
[56:05] want to be in the humanistic realm I
[56:07] don't want to be coming looking for

[1:07:31] said I'm not going to be long but ride
[1:07:32] with me

[1:07:41] this is these are instructions this is a
[1:07:44] warrior week you know this is this is it

[1:07:48] Rapture you know so if it's ever a time
[1:07:50] to get your son is now you know ever
[1:07:52] time to get your wife is now ever time
[1:07:55] to get an order it's now every time they
[1:07:57] clean up your life is no
[1:07:59] whoa
[1:08:02] whoa demons on the run you know demons
[1:08:05] trembling you know Hallelujah some say
[1:08:08] they wish they didn't come this morning
[1:08:09] to the service or no because they
[1:08:11] thought it was just an ordinary service
[1:08:13] Hallelujah them demons spirits and
[1:08:15] powers that sometimes attach themselves
[1:08:17] to you and they survive all these years
[1:08:22] but this morning we're turning up the
[1:08:23] heat
[1:08:24] we making the place seven times hotter
[1:08:27] we're not bothered by the fire we want
[1:08:29] it hotter because only Under Pressure
[1:08:32] only what is of God will last in no
[1:08:34] pressure oh you don't hear me this
[1:08:36] morning
[1:08:38] thanks again
[1:08:51] friends it's not difficult to manage
[1:08:53] things when things are easy and normal
[1:08:58] Hallmark of a great leader of a great
[1:09:01] manager of a great mother of her great
[1:09:04] father is when you're under pressure
[1:09:08] when you're on the Fire
[1:09:10] when you're under stress
[1:09:12] because that's the only time the real
[1:09:14] you to show up
[1:09:18] when they have money in the bank account
[1:09:20] they can buy what you want that you
[1:09:21] really you are showing up you know
[1:09:25] you see any money run out
[1:09:28] then you reel you
[1:09:32] will make himself known
[1:09:36] when I get caught
[1:09:37] in a mistake or situation
[1:09:40] and they didn't expect to get caught
[1:09:43] but now you're caught in a back against
[1:09:45] your wall
[1:09:48] and you have to answer and and the real
[1:09:50] you Solomon lie and say well it wasn't
[1:09:52] me I didn't
[1:09:55] if the pressure wasn't created he
[1:09:57] wouldn't
[1:09:58] expose what's there
[1:10:01] so life is designing a way to increase
[1:10:03] the pressure because what is
[1:10:06] transferable
[1:10:07] is only a character
[1:10:11] the measure of who you are not this just
[1:10:14] 16 elements but the real you
[1:10:16] has to be tried in the fire
[1:10:19] walk through the test walk through the
[1:10:22] trial and say though you see me yet
[1:10:24] still I trust him
[1:10:27] daughter skin worms destroyed his body
[1:10:31] I'm not gonna change for anybody
[1:10:36] I have no food on my table no but my
[1:10:38] testimony I'm not gonna compromise my
[1:10:41] testimony for anybody
[1:10:43] not for family not for friends not even
[1:10:45] for popularity not just to be a icon or
[1:10:48] class or to be different but I
[1:10:50] understand where I come from and where
[1:10:51] I'm going
[1:10:55] and that could only come when you have a
[1:10:57] true revelation of who you are and who
[1:10:59] call you
[1:11:00] because that speaks up a vertical
[1:11:03] relationship between you and God not you
[1:11:05] and the church not you and your husband
[1:11:07] wife children anybody else but you
[1:11:09] answering to God lord here I am send me
[1:11:12] because God wants to say unto you as my
[1:11:15] father sent me sauce and I you
[1:11:18] and that character in you must look like
[1:11:21] Jesus
[1:11:23] anybody in the house this morning
[1:11:31] I'm almost getting to my text
[1:11:34] could you take some more how are we
[1:11:35] doing this morning
[1:11:42] that was a rhetorical question
[1:11:48] if you could take some more remember
[1:11:50] when I was very very young
[1:11:51] grandmother give me some food
[1:11:54] and you say you want some more and it
[1:11:55] was not like they kind of want more like
[1:11:56] you could have an option he had to eat
[1:11:58] it
[1:12:01] she is sit down there and finish eating
[1:12:03] food no it's now young children and
[1:12:05] people have choice I know it was
[1:12:11] eat it
[1:12:14] because you will know how that reach
[1:12:16] here
[1:12:17] you ain't know the work and the struggle
[1:12:19] and there are no choices well I have
[1:12:21] feelings no no no you're ready for more
[1:12:23] take take some more
[1:12:27] because the sacrifice that went into
[1:12:29] putting it there they want to hear well
[1:12:31] I really like it so you know
[1:12:35] but no people do spoil
[1:12:38] they don't understand the sacrifice
[1:12:40] I saw a video recently somebody he
[1:12:42] actually he has his son in his kid go
[1:12:44] and look outside and look at the tree
[1:12:45] and see if you see money growing on it
[1:12:49] because you don't seem to understand the
[1:12:50] effort and he sacrifice to provide for
[1:12:53] the house that you feel you have a right
[1:12:55] to say a certain things and do certain
[1:12:56] things
[1:12:59] it's a balance but but he children today
[1:13:01] different from 10 15 20 30 40 years ago
[1:13:04] it's a level of ungratefulness and
[1:13:06] entitlement
[1:13:13] I saw a video some time ago of a young
[1:13:15] lady who
[1:13:17] I try to understand if it's real or not
[1:13:19] because they're trying to because to me
[1:13:20] it sounds so mental
[1:13:21] and she said she wants to sue her
[1:13:23] parents
[1:13:24] better punch
[1:13:25] for bringing her into the world
[1:13:28] because she never asked to be here
[1:13:38] so I tried to you know they always say
[1:13:40] the match that Madison
[1:13:41] I tend to understand at what point was
[1:13:43] the parents supposed to consult her
[1:13:45] about conceiving her and what where was
[1:13:48] this supposed
[1:13:51] So when you say when heavy prophecy the
[1:13:54] world is becoming totally insane
[1:13:56] you don't have to look too far to see
[1:13:58] that you know
[1:14:00] when children want to sue their parents
[1:14:02] for disciplining them and when you dig
[1:14:04] deeper the discipline is to bring you
[1:14:06] into subjection and into character and
[1:14:08] to avoid mistakes and failure but
[1:14:11] Rebellion is as a sin of Witchcraft
[1:14:13] locked up in the heart of man
[1:14:19] you know that everybody is a sinner
[1:14:21] witchcraft rebelling against parents
[1:14:24] rebelling against order rebelling
[1:14:26] against
[1:14:28] but this is how I am and
[1:14:35] the devil has Twisted minds and you see
[1:14:38] it through technology through all these
[1:14:40] things to zap you to distract you from
[1:14:42] God
[1:14:45] because they have smaller Gods lower
[1:14:47] class G's and we'll get to it in the
[1:14:49] scripture we choose you to stay whom you
[1:14:51] will serve
[1:14:53] but as for me and my house
[1:14:57] we will serve the Lord
[1:14:59] not in my house
[1:15:02] not in my house not in my house not in
[1:15:04] my house not in my house Hallelujah we
[1:15:06] need Christians who will take a stand
[1:15:09] you realize how much people are taking a
[1:15:10] stand for all kind of things now
[1:15:13] people taking stand for what they
[1:15:14] believe
[1:15:15] they can stand for their conviction this
[1:15:17] is always supposed to be and we want our
[1:15:19] rights and we want this in them
[1:15:21] show me some Christians who fighting for
[1:15:23] their conviction
[1:15:27] fighting for the right to be holy
[1:15:30] the right to be pure the right to say
[1:15:33] I'm a Christian I don't need to dress
[1:15:34] like the world I don't need to conform
[1:15:36] like the world I don't need to drink
[1:15:37] like I don't need to smoke like I don't
[1:15:39] need to put on makeup like the world I
[1:15:41] don't need to be worldly
[1:15:45] because I know who I am and whose I am
[1:15:50] can the Church Say Amen
[1:15:56] in the same message Redemption my power
[1:15:58] but he didn't say no I'll go in and
[1:15:59] sweep it all out and build you up some
[1:16:01] nice cities and set you down on Easy
[1:16:03] Street
[1:16:04] he doesn't do it that way
[1:16:06] so the prophet is saying God will come
[1:16:08] and make up your bed in the morning you
[1:16:10] know
[1:16:11] you wake up in the morning Lord
[1:16:13] when I get the bloody where's the wash
[1:16:15] no it doesn't work like that
[1:16:18] he said he doesn't go and sweep it all
[1:16:20] out and build you up some nice seat and
[1:16:21] set you down in this easy street he
[1:16:23] doesn't do it that way he gives it to
[1:16:25] you and you got something to do
[1:16:28] so fathers you have something to do
[1:16:30] mothers you have something to do young
[1:16:33] people you have something to do unless
[1:16:35] you have something to do deacons you
[1:16:37] have something to do
[1:16:41] and everybody soldiers you have
[1:16:43] something to do it's a duty it's a
[1:16:46] responsibility it's a responsibility and
[1:16:49] it's a duty you're not a solar today
[1:16:51] well tomorrow I'm not really reporting
[1:16:52] it no you're Soldier all the time
[1:16:55] even when you're not in uniform it's
[1:16:57] still on duty
[1:16:59] you're just undercover is either in
[1:17:01] uniform or you're on the cover but
[1:17:03] you're still a soldier you're still on
[1:17:05] the orders you're still on the training
[1:17:07] can the Church Say Amen
[1:17:16] oh
[1:17:17] he's good enough to give you land
[1:17:20] and he's and he'd help you and be with
[1:17:23] you but go take it
[1:17:26] and if you are sick tonight crippled
[1:17:28] blind deaf dumb whatever you are go take
[1:17:31] it God said it was yours it's your
[1:17:34] possession God give it to you
[1:17:37] Hallelujah
[1:17:39] Blessed Be
[1:17:41] the name of the Lord I'll skip some of
[1:17:42] this
[1:17:43] because this is
[1:17:45] familiar territory to you and I really
[1:17:47] want to get to something to make sure
[1:17:49] it's in before we close out today's
[1:17:51] service
[1:17:53] and when you read Joshua 1
[1:17:56] we read it send me this get it here
[1:17:59] quickly
[1:18:07] now after the death of Moses the silver
[1:18:09] of the Lord it came to pass that the
[1:18:11] Lord spake unto Joshua the son of none
[1:18:14] Moses Minister saying Moses my servant
[1:18:16] is dead
[1:18:17] now therefore arise go over this Jordan
[1:18:20] thou and all his people unto the land
[1:18:23] which I do give to them even to the
[1:18:26] children of Israel every place that the
[1:18:29] soul of your foot shall tread upon that
[1:18:30] have I given unto you as I said unto
[1:18:33] Moses from the Wilderness and this
[1:18:35] Lebanon even unto the Great River the
[1:18:37] river you fit is all the lands of the
[1:18:39] Hittites are not to the great sea toward
[1:18:41] the going on the sun shall be your Coast
[1:18:43] there shall not any man be able to stand
[1:18:46] before thee all the days of thy life as
[1:18:49] I was with Moses so I will be with thee
[1:18:52] I will not feel thee nor forsake thee be
[1:18:55] strong enough for good courage for under
[1:18:57] this people shall thou divide for an
[1:19:00] inheritance a land which I swear under
[1:19:02] their fathers to give them only be thou
[1:19:04] strong and very courageous that domains
[1:19:08] observe to do according to all the law
[1:19:11] which Moses like servant commanded thee
[1:19:13] turn not from it to the right hand or to
[1:19:17] the left that dominance Prosper with
[1:19:20] whatsoever thou goest Hallelujah
[1:19:24] hallelujah oh and that's the same
[1:19:27] scripture that applies us you know this
[1:19:29] law this message just promise that we
[1:19:31] have we are not supposed to depart from
[1:19:33] it from the left or to the right and we
[1:19:36] are supposed to have courage to stand to
[1:19:38] possess it and every place you put your
[1:19:40] foot that land is going to be your land
[1:19:43] can the Church Say Amen
[1:19:47] so let me get to my text
[1:19:50] we read from Joshua 24.
[1:19:53] and I just want to read the two verses
[1:19:56] again and then get back to the
[1:19:58] background for context
[1:20:01] so Joshua is speaking now now chapter 24
[1:20:04] of Joshua is the last chapter of the
[1:20:09] Book of Joshua
[1:20:11] this is Joshua's going away message
[1:20:16] this is after many battles and victories
[1:20:20] many struggles much pain
[1:20:28] I'll rewind I'll just go to Joshua 24
[1:20:30] and verse 1. if you have your Bibles you
[1:20:32] could just run through it with me
[1:20:35] as you build up to those verses that
[1:20:37] we're ready to start
[1:20:39] Joshua 21 verse 1 and Joshua gathered
[1:20:42] all the tribes of Israel
[1:20:44] to shechem
[1:20:46] and called for the Elders of Israel and
[1:20:49] for their heads
[1:20:50] and for their judges
[1:20:52] and for the officers and they presented
[1:20:55] themselves before God
[1:21:00] and I preached on part of this some time
[1:21:02] ago and I have some notes written here
[1:21:06] that when you look at bible characters
[1:21:08] in history many of them have different
[1:21:10] attributes but in the case of Joshua we
[1:21:13] never picked your Joshua as the man to
[1:21:16] stand up on a Sunday and give a sermon
[1:21:19] we knew Joshua as what a warrior a
[1:21:21] fighter are you for also against us they
[1:21:24] are not much opportunities of speeches
[1:21:26] you will see through scriptures with
[1:21:27] Joshua
[1:21:29] he was more of a boots on the ground
[1:21:31] type A Soldier a leader who knew how to
[1:21:34] run an operation
[1:21:36] he's a tactical Commander
[1:21:39] he was a general whose War Stories were
[1:21:41] told and retold
[1:21:44] but as his life started to wind down
[1:21:49] This Man of Action turned into a sort of
[1:21:52] spiritual guide
[1:21:54] maybe it was his understanding of the
[1:21:57] people always on easy hunch about what
[1:22:00] could happen when he was no longer
[1:22:01] around to lead them because he knew he
[1:22:03] was about to go
[1:22:05] or the simple fact that those he had
[1:22:07] shared in the Glory Days of the
[1:22:09] Canaanite Camp were feeling away just
[1:22:11] like he was now Joshua was an older man
[1:22:15] he must have known that as he and his
[1:22:17] comrades left this world the memories of
[1:22:20] God's wonders May slowly fade
[1:22:23] replaced by the everyday noise of life
[1:22:27] and the influence of the Canaanites
[1:22:29] around them and the easy pull of the
[1:22:31] world young people would star them down
[1:22:34] a slippery slope away from God
[1:22:37] and there Joshua stood calling for the
[1:22:40] people
[1:22:42] on the edge looking back I could imagine
[1:22:44] on a life well lived
[1:22:46] his purpose fulfilled
[1:22:48] God had given him a job to do
[1:22:52] and he did it
[1:22:54] when Moses passed on Joshua had picked
[1:22:57] up the torch
[1:22:58] bravely stepping up to God's challenge
[1:23:02] the Book of Joshua his life's Testament
[1:23:05] was proof of his faithfulness
[1:23:09] as he faced his own mortality he was
[1:23:12] Secure in the knowledge that he had made
[1:23:14] the right choice
[1:23:16] to serve the Lord
[1:23:19] his journey was over but his legacy
[1:23:23] would live on
[1:23:25] his only wish his only desire his only
[1:23:28] prayer was for the people to stay true
[1:23:30] to the path that he had set out on
[1:23:33] together
[1:23:34] and he wanted to remind them to
[1:23:37] encourage them to push them to keep on
[1:23:39] going
[1:23:40] and that's what I'm doing this morning
[1:23:42] trying to remind you to encourage you to
[1:23:44] push you to keep going
[1:23:47] the last three chapters of Joshua gives
[1:23:51] us a glimpse of his role in chapter 22
[1:23:54] it was a farewell speech to the tribes
[1:23:57] of Reuben God and manager as they were
[1:24:00] about to set off across Jordan
[1:24:02] he brought up the past and urged them to
[1:24:04] stick to the rules set by Moses
[1:24:07] in chapter 23 it's a call to action to
[1:24:10] the Future Leaders and you can read it
[1:24:12] the people who would take over after he
[1:24:14] was gone
[1:24:16] it echoed the sentiments of his earlier
[1:24:18] sermon but with extra wisdom for those
[1:24:21] who would take up the mantle of
[1:24:23] leadership
[1:24:24] and finally in this chapter 24
[1:24:27] Joshua would give one last sermon one
[1:24:31] last encouragement one last message to
[1:24:35] the entire assembly at shechem not long
[1:24:38] before he would Breathe his last breath
[1:24:41] Joshua the soldier turned preacher still
[1:24:45] leading his people right to the very end
[1:24:50] he stood and he brought the people to
[1:24:52] shechem
[1:24:53] and shechem is interesting it's more
[1:24:55] than a dot in a map
[1:24:58] it's a place of decision a place of
[1:25:01] Destiny it was a place that held special
[1:25:03] meaning and the backdrop of one of the
[1:25:07] most important
[1:25:09] some of the most important events in
[1:25:11] Scripture
[1:25:13] like a crossroad in a novel where
[1:25:16] characters come to find their purpose
[1:25:18] Joshua brought the people to a special
[1:25:21] place
[1:25:22] if we go back in Genesis
[1:25:25] shechem was the place when Abraham would
[1:25:28] become Abraham
[1:25:32] God shows up and made a promise and
[1:25:35] Abraham Builds an altar so shechem the
[1:25:38] promise was laid from Abraham to Abraham
[1:25:42] when Joseph was sold into slavery
[1:25:47] it was a chicken
[1:25:50] and the amazing thing is that even
[1:25:52] though Joseph ends up in prison
[1:25:55] and he told them to when you're going
[1:25:57] back you remember you say carry my bones
[1:25:59] with you
[1:26:00] Joseph was buried at shechem
[1:26:05] so Joshua had gathered the people at
[1:26:07] this place of great spiritual
[1:26:09] significance
[1:26:11] and I come full circle
[1:26:14] to begin to give his last address
[1:26:18] can the church see amen
[1:26:21] Joshua 24 and verse 2 and Joshua said
[1:26:24] unto all the people thus say the Lord
[1:26:26] God of Israel your fathers dwelt on the
[1:26:30] other side of the flooding all time even
[1:26:32] Terror
[1:26:33] the father of Abraham and the father of
[1:26:35] Naco and they served other gods
[1:26:42] and I took your father Abraham from the
[1:26:45] other side of the flood
[1:26:47] and led him throughout all the land of
[1:26:49] Canaan and multiply this seed and gave
[1:26:51] him Isaac
[1:26:53] and I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau and
[1:26:57] I gave unto Isa Mount zero to possess it
[1:26:59] but Jacob and his children went down
[1:27:02] into Egypt and I sent Moses also an
[1:27:05] Aaron and I plagued Egypt according to
[1:27:08] that which I did among them and after
[1:27:10] what I brought you out in other words
[1:27:12] God is speaking to Joshua to show them
[1:27:14] what I've taken you through
[1:27:16] in other words you have a reason to be
[1:27:18] happy you have a reason to Rejoice
[1:27:20] because I've been taking you through
[1:27:22] some stuff
[1:27:23] for your whole life and verse 16 I
[1:27:26] brought your fathers out of Egypt and he
[1:27:28] came unto the Sea and the Egyptians
[1:27:31] pursued after your fathers were chariots
[1:27:33] and Horsepen unto the Red Sea
[1:27:36] and when they Cried unto the Lord he put
[1:27:39] Darkness between you and the Egyptians
[1:27:41] and brought to Sea upon them and cover
[1:27:44] them and your eyes have seen what have
[1:27:46] done in Egypt and he dwelt in the
[1:27:48] wilderness a long season
[1:27:50] and I brought you into the land of the
[1:27:52] amorites which dwelt on the other side
[1:27:55] of Jordan and they fought with you and I
[1:27:58] gave them into your hand that he might
[1:28:00] possess their land and I destroyed them
[1:28:03] from before you
[1:28:07] arose and Ward against Israel and sent
[1:28:10] and called Balaam the son of beer to
[1:28:13] curse you you see how much stuff they
[1:28:14] went through
[1:28:15] but I would not hearken unto bailam
[1:28:18] therefore he blessed you still so I
[1:28:21] delivered you out of his hand and you
[1:28:23] went over Jordan and came unto Jericho
[1:28:26] and the men of Jericho fought against
[1:28:29] you the amorites and the parasites and
[1:28:31] the Canaanites and the Hittites and the
[1:28:34] gurga sites the heavy and the jebicides
[1:28:36] and I delivered them into your hand
[1:28:40] and I send a hornet before you with
[1:28:42] drape them out from before you even the
[1:28:44] two kings of the amorites but not with
[1:28:48] thy sword it wasn't your strength it
[1:28:50] wasn't your ability nor would I bow can
[1:28:53] I get some money monitors please
[1:28:54] and I gave you get I have given you a
[1:28:57] land for which he did not labor and
[1:29:00] cities which he built not and he dwell
[1:29:03] in them and of The Vineyards and Olivier
[1:29:05] Alias which he planted not do you eat
[1:29:10] now after all of that
[1:29:13] Josh what challenges the people
[1:29:16] know therefore fear the lord
[1:29:20] and serve him in sincerity
[1:29:22] and in truth and put away the gods which
[1:29:26] your father served on the other side of
[1:29:28] the flood and in Egypt and servedo Lord
[1:29:32] and if it seem evil unto you to serve
[1:29:35] the Lord choose you this day whom you
[1:29:37] will serve whether the gods which your
[1:29:40] father served that were on the other
[1:29:42] side of the flood or the gods of
[1:29:44] yamorites in whose land you dwell
[1:29:47] but as for me and my house
[1:29:49] he will serve the Lord
[1:29:52] now I want this to look at this closely
[1:29:54] friends
[1:29:56] this choice being presented to the
[1:29:59] people
[1:30:00] was not a choice between serve God or
[1:30:05] serve the devil
[1:30:07] I want to look at his choice a little
[1:30:09] closely
[1:30:10] he said choose you this day whom you
[1:30:13] will serve whether the gods which your
[1:30:16] father served that were on the other
[1:30:18] side of the flood or the New Gods
[1:30:23] of the amorites
[1:30:24] in other words Joshua was challenging
[1:30:27] the people to see if they really want
[1:30:29] God
[1:30:33] and the challenge is to the church under
[1:30:35] the young people do you really want God
[1:30:38] in other words
[1:30:40] you could go back to your backs in ways
[1:30:42] in sin
[1:30:43] if you want that or you can even save
[1:30:46] the new gods
[1:30:47] which is having a form of godliness
[1:30:53] so people have given up the all gods
[1:30:55] they're not smoking they're not drinking
[1:30:57] they're not any word but they're in
[1:30:58] church serving New Gods
[1:31:04] Joshua was testing them
[1:31:07] and this is a challenge I'm presenting
[1:31:09] to you Church
[1:31:11] you're scared long you're not saving the
[1:31:13] old God but in your heart there's a new
[1:31:16] God
[1:31:24] so you have a choice this morning Joshua
[1:31:26] chew it out he wants to know who really
[1:31:28] serious
[1:31:31] let me read it one more time
[1:31:33] he said no therefore hear the Lord
[1:31:36] because that's a problem people don't
[1:31:38] have fear for the Lord
[1:31:41] because fear brings respects the fear of
[1:31:44] the Lord is the beginning of wisdom so
[1:31:45] he said fear the lord and serve him in
[1:31:49] sincerity
[1:31:50] and in truth if you know better do
[1:31:54] better if you know better live better if
[1:31:57] you know better act better
[1:32:00] serving in sincerity
[1:32:03] and in truth and put away the Gods
[1:32:07] put away these styles put away Fashions
[1:32:11] put away these cigarettes put a very
[1:32:13] lion put a very fornication but the very
[1:32:16] adultery but already pornography but
[1:32:19] already felt 11 put a very well in music
[1:32:22] put it away
[1:32:25] he said put away the gods with your
[1:32:28] father served on the other side of the
[1:32:31] flood
[1:32:34] Egypt
[1:32:35] in other words in Egypt it were bats
[1:32:38] living in Egypt but a George
[1:32:42] he said your father served Gods when
[1:32:44] they were in Egypt and the others had to
[1:32:45] be flood put them away and serve the
[1:32:47] Lord
[1:32:48] and he said to them now in verse 15 I
[1:32:50] want you to dial it in nowhere because
[1:32:52] this is the problem in the message
[1:32:57] and if it seem evil unto you
[1:33:00] have a problem with serving the lord
[1:33:03] fools you this day whom he will serve
[1:33:05] whether the gods your father
[1:33:07] who were just
[1:33:09] just tell all these new gods
[1:33:12] of the amorites in whose land you dwell
[1:33:15] these gods of social media
[1:33:19] these gods of Christian music are not
[1:33:21] really Christian
[1:33:22] these gods of associations that is not
[1:33:25] that they were an airing and makeup and
[1:33:27] pants but it is in their heart they're
[1:33:30] really going to hell still it's a new
[1:33:32] form of God but it's still not the true
[1:33:34] God
[1:33:36] and Joshua declares publicly but as for
[1:33:39] me and my house
[1:33:44] we will serve the Lord
[1:33:47] so what Josh what did he presented three
[1:33:50] options
[1:33:52] the gods of your past
[1:33:55] so when people backslide they already
[1:33:56] backside into the gods of the past
[1:33:59] all these new gods that take a bit of
[1:34:01] time because watching a set of movies on
[1:34:04] Netflix
[1:34:06] watching us as a TV well and not any
[1:34:09] world I'm not drinking and not smoking
[1:34:11] and not fornicating but this is a new
[1:34:13] God
[1:34:14] of the land and who you dwell but you're
[1:34:18] still not giving the attention to God
[1:34:20] so where you really want to be at this
[1:34:23] morning
[1:34:24] you want to go back from where you came
[1:34:26] in the world
[1:34:27] you want to play games in church or you
[1:34:30] want to leave it all behind and serve
[1:34:32] the Lord
[1:34:40] it's a thought-provoking situation you
[1:34:42] know
[1:34:44] because many will miss it not because
[1:34:46] they were living in the world no they
[1:34:48] left that but these new gods are the new
[1:34:50] problem
[1:34:52] the gods that take up your time to your
[1:34:54] car pray
[1:34:57] you know you're supposed to pray you
[1:34:59] left you always didn't pray but now
[1:35:00] you're in church and you're supposed to
[1:35:01] be praying but you're not praying
[1:35:02] because you're serving New Gods
[1:35:08] anybody with me
[1:35:13] on the outside you'll know you're not
[1:35:15] looking like the world but on the inside
[1:35:17] is worldly music Willie desires will the
[1:35:20] affections will the operation that's why
[1:35:21] the Bible say having a form of godliness
[1:35:23] but denying the power
[1:35:28] I hope this helps somebody you know
[1:35:30] because God is not going to help you and
[1:35:33] bless you if you don't make a choice
[1:35:35] God is not choosing for you so Joshua is
[1:35:39] saying it's your choice choose you today
[1:35:41] who you will serve
[1:35:43] you love the world to come any message
[1:35:45] but you still have the world in you and
[1:35:47] the reality is by the Clarence Satan is
[1:35:50] smart
[1:35:52] he know he can present a cigarette to
[1:35:54] you he know he can present alcohol to
[1:35:56] you but he will find New Gods unlimited
[1:36:00] New Gods but upon you present this this
[1:36:02] this distraction this thing and and all
[1:36:04] it do is taking away your focus
[1:36:10] we will serve the Lord
[1:36:13] where are you standing this morning
[1:36:18] in the message choosing of a bride
[1:36:21] but Abraham said in many things of life
[1:36:23] we are given a choice
[1:36:26] the way of life itself is a choice we
[1:36:30] have a right to make our own way choose
[1:36:33] our way that we want to live
[1:36:35] and in the product of your life is a
[1:36:37] choice
[1:36:39] and you can't blame anybody about it
[1:36:43] education is a choice
[1:36:45] I always say people go to school for
[1:36:47] five years and leave it nothing who's
[1:36:49] the blame
[1:36:50] and for everybody who have an excuse I
[1:36:52] could show you somebody who had it worse
[1:36:54] who because they chose to do it did it
[1:36:57] so I can accept excuses
[1:37:00] somebody wrote a book the book of
[1:37:02] excuses you know
[1:37:04] and they have almost every possible
[1:37:06] excuse in that book
[1:37:09] but you know God has no excuses accept
[1:37:11] no excuses
[1:37:12] when Moses stood and said talk I can't
[1:37:15] write a car email
[1:37:17] he said when it done let me know when
[1:37:20] you finish
[1:37:21] because you're still going
[1:37:23] because for everything you say a car do
[1:37:26] and a car doing a car do when you finish
[1:37:27] write it all down burn it afterwards
[1:37:29] because you're still going
[1:37:31] you still have to live like a Christian
[1:37:33] after all is said and done
[1:37:44] it's a choice
[1:37:45] you have to choose to be a Christian
[1:37:48] you have to choose a dress like a
[1:37:50] Christian live like a Christian act like
[1:37:53] a Christian forgiveness is a choice
[1:37:55] love is a choice worship is a choice
[1:37:59] prayer is a choice
[1:38:02] December Branham we can choose whether
[1:38:04] we're going to be educated or whether we
[1:38:06] are not going to be educated that's a
[1:38:09] choice we have that's a prophet's words
[1:38:11] right and wrong is a choice
[1:38:14] every man every woman boy and girl has
[1:38:18] to choose whether they're going to try
[1:38:20] to live right or not live right it's a
[1:38:23] choice
[1:38:28] goes on your Eternal destination is a
[1:38:31] choice
[1:38:33] and maybe tonight today some of you will
[1:38:36] make that choice of where you'll spend
[1:38:38] eternity before the service Ends Tonight
[1:38:42] there'll be one time and if you turn God
[1:38:44] down many times there'll be one time
[1:38:46] you'll turn him down the last time
[1:38:48] there's a line between mercy and
[1:38:50] judgment and it's a dangerous thing for
[1:38:53] a man or a woman boy or girl to step
[1:38:56] across that line for there's no return
[1:38:59] when you step across that deadline
[1:39:01] so today tonight it may be the time that
[1:39:04] many will make their decision where they
[1:39:06] will spend the endless
[1:39:08] eternity
[1:39:10] friends it's a choice
[1:39:13] you can choose to save or you can choose
[1:39:16] suspend
[1:39:17] it's your choice
[1:39:19] you can choose the lead or you can
[1:39:22] choose to follow
[1:39:25] you could choose to teach or you can
[1:39:27] choose to learn
[1:39:29] you could choose to create or you could
[1:39:31] choose to consume
[1:39:33] you could choose to give or you could
[1:39:35] just choose to receive
[1:39:37] you could choose to forgive or you could
[1:39:39] choose to hold a grudge
[1:39:41] it's your choice no matter service you
[1:39:43] have to ever drop your odds drop your
[1:39:45] oils drop your people choose to renew it
[1:39:51] the renewing odds and grudges that they
[1:39:53] can't remember why they have the
[1:39:54] alternate
[1:39:57] they can't remember why they can't talk
[1:39:58] to somebody
[1:40:01] but it's a choice
[1:40:03] you could choose to take risks or to
[1:40:05] stay safe
[1:40:07] you could choose to embrace change or to
[1:40:09] remain static
[1:40:11] you could choose to listen or to ignore
[1:40:14] you could choose to be proactive or
[1:40:16] reactive
[1:40:17] you could choose to ask for help
[1:40:20] or you could choose a struggle alone
[1:40:24] you can choose a share or you could
[1:40:26] choose to keep things to yourself
[1:40:28] yourselves to work or you can choose to
[1:40:30] stay home and be lazy it's a choice
[1:40:33] you could choose to accept
[1:40:35] responsibility or deny responsibility
[1:40:41] you could choose a trust or doubt
[1:40:43] you can choose to compliment or
[1:40:45] criticize but Abraham say if you have
[1:40:46] nothing good to say stay quiet now
[1:40:48] say something nice say something kind
[1:40:50] but no some people they can't do that
[1:40:53] and they make a choice to say whatever
[1:40:54] comes to their mind
[1:40:57] you could choose to be optimistic or you
[1:40:59] could choose to be pessimistic listen
[1:41:01] nobody has these switch to control that
[1:41:04] in you you know it's your choice
[1:41:07] so you cannot say it's because so and so
[1:41:10] happen it's why I saw this morning
[1:41:13] it is still your choice
[1:41:17] it is still your choice
[1:41:20] you could choose to admit mistakes and
[1:41:24] say I was wrong I'm sorry or you could
[1:41:26] deny them or Justify them which is what
[1:41:28] most of us do we don't want to admit be
[1:41:31] wrong
[1:41:32] we have a reason well I hear Indian or
[1:41:35] but the reason why I did it so is
[1:41:36] because I saw and yet you're not willing
[1:41:39] to because you can't grow and change if
[1:41:40] you're not willing to admit that I made
[1:41:42] a messed up
[1:41:45] I consider myself an epic failure
[1:41:48] and I'm not negative or pessimistic
[1:41:50] about it
[1:41:52] but feel as a part of life
[1:41:54] every day I feel and every day I'm
[1:41:57] making mistake but God's grace keep
[1:41:59] picking me up his grace keep picking me
[1:42:01] up his grace keep picking me up
[1:42:07] and if you approach life because in this
[1:42:10] human journey is a life full of
[1:42:12] stumbling when a child for a long trying
[1:42:14] to learn to walk he don't get I really
[1:42:17] depressed yes I fall long
[1:42:19] for two days here try to walk again
[1:42:22] curl up on the bed because he fall along
[1:42:24] no he just get back up and fallen again
[1:42:26] get back up for a long game until after
[1:42:28] already get his balance better and then
[1:42:30] walk start to turn to thing and then he
[1:42:32] can't even catch them
[1:42:34] you they're trying to keep up with them
[1:42:35] because they know when from that to
[1:42:37] walking to run into running away
[1:42:42] but they have dealt with failure
[1:42:46] and we sing the song We Fall Down but we
[1:42:49] get up
[1:42:51] so how hard is it to say you know what I
[1:42:53] made a mistake and I want to repent
[1:42:55] I want to make things right I don't want
[1:42:58] to go back into that mistake again
[1:43:00] that's what brother Brandon said when uh
[1:43:02] a pig fall in the mud he said wait no
[1:43:04] it's a long time I feel this mud boy
[1:43:06] I forget I forget all this what is a
[1:43:09] feeling though
[1:43:10] but when I when alarm fall in the mud
[1:43:12] he's gonna cry
[1:43:14] because you don't want to be in that
[1:43:15] condition
[1:43:16] so the issue's not falling down to
[1:43:18] people fall along and when they feel the
[1:43:20] monster they say oh boy
[1:43:22] but if you fall in the mud and you
[1:43:24] recognize this is not for me then your
[1:43:26] heart saying pray for me encouragement
[1:43:28] somebody promise somebody hold me are
[1:43:30] fighting back I try my I don't want to
[1:43:32] say that that's a choice
[1:43:39] you could choose to take
[1:43:40] responsibilities and many many fathers
[1:43:43] have to take responsibilities
[1:43:45] take responsibility many mothers have to
[1:43:48] accept responsibility
[1:43:52] children have to take responsibility
[1:43:55] because if you can't admit you could do
[1:43:58] better something wrong with you
[1:44:00] because we could all do better
[1:44:03] could we do more for the Lord
[1:44:05] could we do more for each other if the
[1:44:07] answer is yes then what's holding us
[1:44:09] back it's a choice
[1:44:11] it's because we choose to do other
[1:44:13] things that don't create value in the
[1:44:15] economy of God can the Church Say Amen
[1:44:20] you could choose to be unkind or unkind
[1:44:23] but Madam taught us this you could
[1:44:25] choose to fight or flee you could choose
[1:44:27] to be patient or impatient
[1:44:30] you could choose to encourage or
[1:44:32] discourage
[1:44:33] you could choose to heal you know you
[1:44:35] could give word to somebody that will
[1:44:37] create healing
[1:44:38] or you could choose to hurt somebody
[1:44:42] you could choose to build up or you
[1:44:44] could choose to tear down
[1:44:46] you could choose to live for today or
[1:44:49] plan for tomorrow what did the prophet
[1:44:50] teach us live as if God is coming now
[1:44:52] but plan for 20 years
[1:44:54] you could choose a sure gratitude or
[1:44:57] ingratitude half of the people who
[1:44:59] complain and they didn't even thank God
[1:45:01] for waking them up this morning
[1:45:03] and the Bible says in everything give
[1:45:05] him thanks
[1:45:07] that's a choice to be grateful Lord I
[1:45:09] Thank you is just a hundred dollars I
[1:45:12] have but thank you for giving me the
[1:45:13] hundred dollars
[1:45:14] I'm so thankful now guys man how to use
[1:45:17] it your whole perspective on life
[1:45:19] changes it's a choice
[1:45:24] because the moment you complain about
[1:45:25] this complaining we can see faith I know
[1:45:27] there's nothing you cannot for Joy thing
[1:45:29] but you know why I'm teaching this
[1:45:31] because this weekend is a choice you get
[1:45:34] what you expect onto this weekend and
[1:45:36] your choice but the effort the prayer
[1:45:38] the sacrifice and you make towards this
[1:45:40] convention
[1:45:43] a choice to be honest or dishonest

[1:46:03] to worldly music
[1:46:05] are you being honest with yourself
[1:46:07] are you being real with yourself because

[1:46:48] selfless

[1:53:04] man had the opportunity to walk up to
[1:53:06] Jesus and have a conversation with Jesus
[1:53:11] and he asked the question
[1:53:14] good Master what

[1:53:53] and Jesus looked at him sorrowful and he
[1:53:56] gave him a choice
[1:53:58] and he was unable to make the right
[1:54:01] choice
[1:54:07] Esau gave up his Birthright for a plate
[1:54:10] of food
[1:54:11] that was his choice
[1:54:22] in a message by faith Moses
[1:54:29] but Madam said when I see a woman coming
[1:54:31] down the street with a long skirt and
[1:54:34] her hair done up neatly and a decent
[1:54:37] looking dress on
[1:54:38] and I see another young lady maybe the
[1:54:40] same age with a little pair of shorts on
[1:54:43] she may be in looks twice as pretty as a
[1:54:45] woman with a long hair according to the
[1:54:47] looking of the world but I'll take my
[1:54:49] side with a girl that's just like a
[1:54:51] Christian
[1:54:52] though they would be laughing at her and
[1:54:54] calling her fanatic yet I'll take my
[1:54:57] side
[1:54:58] she may not be as pretty as the other
[1:55:00] girl featurely but she sees something by
[1:55:02] faith she sees him who is invisible who
[1:55:05] is guiding her life when I see a man on
[1:55:07] the job being called Deacon or preacher
[1:55:10] or fanatic because he refuses to smoke
[1:55:13] and to drink beer and to go to the
[1:55:15] dances like the rest of them and he's
[1:55:17] called a fanatic my heart goes out for
[1:55:20] him he is my brother down in this Egypt
[1:55:22] soil that makes our heart long to
[1:55:25] embrace and say Brothers we are pilgrims
[1:55:29] and strangers of this land and I long to
[1:55:31] fellowship with you Moses had to make a
[1:55:35] choice Choosing by faith
[1:55:38] how many young men would have jumped at
[1:55:40] the opportunity to be the son of
[1:55:43] Pharaoh's daughter how many young men
[1:55:45] would have jumped at the opportunity
[1:55:47] that Moses had to enjoy all the
[1:55:50] pleasures and the glamor of the world to
[1:55:52] become the king of Egypt to have the
[1:55:54] whole world at his feet
[1:55:56] what a foolish thing that a young man of
[1:55:58] his day must have taught when Moses
[1:56:01] chose to take his place with The
[1:56:03] Afflicted and the suffering people of
[1:56:06] God why did he do it by faith when he
[1:56:09] lifted up his eyes he looked beyond the
[1:56:11] glamor of this world he looked beyond
[1:56:13] the pleasure of sin and the Bible said
[1:56:16] he endured us seeing him who was
[1:56:18] Invisible by feet he made a choice to
[1:56:21] serve that God regardless of what took
[1:56:24] place
[1:56:25] says it has not changed many of us could
[1:56:29] go to what we would call a better
[1:56:30] building we could enjoy maybe the
[1:56:32] fellowship and pleasure of sitting in a
[1:56:34] better Pew we might be more popular to
[1:56:37] drink and to smoke and to dress and to
[1:56:39] act like the world but what's the matter
[1:56:41] you have lifted up your eyes and by
[1:56:44] faith you see him who is invisible and
[1:56:46] you took your stand with the rejected
[1:56:48] and so-called Holy Rollers of the day
[1:56:50] for by faith we see him who is invisible
[1:56:53] choosing to suffer the persecutions and
[1:56:56] The Afflicted
[1:56:58] I wouldn't say to people like this
[1:57:00] should choose to be afflicted I don't
[1:57:02] say that you should choose suffering it
[1:57:04] would not be the human thing to do but
[1:57:07] if suffering lays in the path of Duty
[1:57:09] then let's take it as it comes I don't
[1:57:12] want you to do something for somebody to
[1:57:14] make fun of you I wouldn't want you to
[1:57:16] say different things I belong to a
[1:57:18] church that doesn't believe and so and
[1:57:19] so and think that I won't say for you to
[1:57:22] get out here and Carry On and do
[1:57:23] something that was Radical I wouldn't
[1:57:25] want you to do that so that somebody
[1:57:27] would say that you are fanatic you bring
[1:57:29] it on yourself but if it lays in the
[1:57:32] path of your duty towards God let the
[1:57:35] world see what they want to see you live
[1:57:37] on you make a choice every man and woman
[1:57:41] has to make this
[1:57:45] what if Pharaoh could have saw what
[1:57:47] Moses saw he saw the sufferings of the
[1:57:50] people he knew what the price was to pay
[1:57:52] but by faith he chose it rather than to
[1:57:55] have the pleasures of sin
[1:57:57] there's maybe a little young lady
[1:57:58] sitting here as glamorous young woman
[1:58:01] the world would like to say to you do
[1:58:03] thus and thus you are beautiful your
[1:58:05] body is pretty shape you should show
[1:58:07] that but my sister raise up your eyes
[1:58:10] and look beyond that to him and set it
[1:58:13] an Abomination for a woman to put on a
[1:58:16] garment that pertains to a man
[1:58:21] if the men are the people in your
[1:58:23] community if the woman that you
[1:58:25] associate with said cut that long hair
[1:58:27] off it would be cooler I'm reading the
[1:58:28] prophet's words
[1:58:30] it would be this that or the other or it
[1:58:32] would be better don't you listen to that
[1:58:34] you lift up your eyes and by faith saw
[1:58:37] him that said the woman's hairs are
[1:58:39] glory and she shall not cut it if they
[1:58:42] say it'll be popular you will stand in
[1:58:44] better with your job or with your boss
[1:58:46] if you take a sociable drink or if you
[1:58:49] would smoke cigarettes like the rest of
[1:58:50] the woman or you would stand in more
[1:58:52] social in your neighborhood but if it
[1:58:54] raise your eyes look to him who said
[1:58:57] defiled his body and I will destroy it
[1:58:59] by faith we believe those things it's
[1:59:02] nothing that you've seen it's something
[1:59:03] you believe by faith and in this Faith
[1:59:06] walk there comes a time when there has
[1:59:09] to be a choice
[1:59:11] everybody's still with me I'm almost
[1:59:13] finished I want to drive this home
[1:59:15] friends because if you want to get the
[1:59:17] Holy Ghost and you want your
[1:59:18] breakthrough it is very much I read the
[1:59:21] quote your Eternal destination is a
[1:59:24] choice
[1:59:25] choose you today Young Brother young
[1:59:27] sister who you will serve
[1:59:31] let me that sad mistake that we make
[1:59:36] a lot of times we choose for our own
[1:59:38] good we choose things that would be
[1:59:40] better and I'm preachers before because
[1:59:42] a lot the Bible said righteous lot was
[1:59:46] vaccine in spirit in the book of Peter
[1:59:50] with the Abomination and lots he was
[1:59:53] strong enough to withstand the
[1:59:55] environment but his wife wasn't strong
[1:59:57] enough his children were not strong
[1:59:59] enough and the decision the choice he
[2:00:02] made was not just impacting his own life
[2:00:04] it destroyed his family
[2:00:10] so the choice you make is not just about
[2:00:12] you friends
[2:00:14] there are others who are depending on
[2:00:16] you making the right choice
[2:00:18] and that's why I challenge your fathers
[2:00:21] challenge the mothers challenge the
[2:00:23] leaders they are second order
[2:00:25] consequences of the choices you make
[2:00:28] that's why Joshua could stand and say as
[2:00:31] for me and my house I am taking
[2:00:34] responsibility not just for me but as
[2:00:37] for me and my house
[2:00:39] we will serve the Lord
[2:00:50] in the message choosing of a bride and
[2:00:54] many time men and women hear God's truth
[2:00:56] and see it Vindicated and proven truth
[2:00:59] but yet they don't want to hear it in
[2:01:01] other words they don't really want to
[2:01:02] hate there's some other reason
[2:01:08] there's some of the choosing that they
[2:01:10] have
[2:01:12] than to face up the truth and facts
[2:01:16] therefore The Heirs can be close to the
[2:01:19] gospel they'll never hear it again my
[2:01:22] advice to you this is a 1965 my advice
[2:01:26] to you when God speaks to your heart you
[2:01:29] act right then
[2:01:38] Elijah gave them a choice
[2:01:42] you remember just before the fire came
[2:01:44] he said why Stan you hold why hold you
[2:01:48] between two decisions
[2:01:51] your one foot in church your other foot
[2:01:53] in the world you're one foot in the old
[2:01:55] gods the other foot in the new gods and
[2:01:57] then don't have a firm conviction that I
[2:01:59] want to serve the Lord
[2:02:02] and it's embarrassing when parents can't
[2:02:05] take a stand because the children take
[2:02:07] the lead off of that
[2:02:10] either right or is wrong
[2:02:12] [Music]
[2:02:16] if God is God serve him
[2:02:19] with all your heart with all your mind
[2:02:22] without your soul with all that in you
[2:02:24] and God will honor that he will bless
[2:02:27] that he will reward you for it
[2:02:29] [Music]
[2:02:35] Elijah gave them a choice choose you
[2:02:38] this day whom you will serve if God be
[2:02:42] God serve him
[2:02:44] but if God be God serve him if the
[2:02:47] airing on your makeup and the costume
[2:02:49] money pornography and the sex and the
[2:02:50] alcohol and the music and this thing if
[2:02:52] you want I will go
[2:02:54] but if you want God
[2:02:56] if you want Redemption if you want
[2:02:58] Deliverance if you want eternal life if
[2:03:01] you want to oh come on now somebody help
[2:03:02] him if you want the peace that's a
[2:03:05] passive understanding Jesus my peace I
[2:03:08] give to you my love is for you my reward
[2:03:12] is for you my kingdom is for you
[2:03:23] verse 16 of Acts of Joshua 24.
[2:03:27] and the people answered him
[2:03:30] so Joshua presented a choice to them to
[2:03:34] see all you really want this message you
[2:03:36] really want this gospel you really want
[2:03:37] to be a Christian
[2:03:40] choose you this day the all God's choose
[2:03:43] where you come from the Baptist Church
[2:03:45] he did whatever it was
[2:03:47] you want to go back there or you want to
[2:03:49] live in this I'm a right world and adapt
[2:03:51] to their foolishness
[2:03:54] so in verse 16 the people respond
[2:03:58] and the people answered and said God
[2:04:00] forbid
[2:04:01] that we should forsake the Lord to serve
[2:04:04] other gods
[2:04:08] for the Lord Our God here it is that
[2:04:10] brought us up and our fathers out of the
[2:04:13] land of Egypt from the house of bondage
[2:04:15] and which did those great signs in our
[2:04:18] sight and praise and preserved Us in all
[2:04:21] the way wherein we went and among all
[2:04:23] the people whom through we passed and
[2:04:26] the Lord drave out from before since the
[2:04:28] people talking even the Amorite was
[2:04:31] dwelled in the land therefore will we
[2:04:33] also serve the Lord for he is our God
[2:04:41] so Joshua listens to that response
[2:04:47] because the response sounded good
[2:04:51] it's a nice answer
[2:04:53] but Joshua wasn't buying it
[2:04:57] words
[2:04:59] or they're talking nice
[2:05:00] well you're talking some quotes and
[2:05:02] scriptures and it's the Lord who took me
[2:05:04] through but I really want to get along
[2:05:06] into your heart
[2:05:09] so verse 19 Joshua probes
[2:05:13] God gave us the probe of the Holy Ghost
[2:05:15] today to see what really in your heart
[2:05:18] because you are who you are when you are
[2:05:20] alone you are you you are when the Allah
[2:05:23] Minister because they never answer
[2:05:24] because they were in the presence of
[2:05:26] Joshua
[2:05:27] they were in the presence of church so
[2:05:29] they were given a nice answer so he
[2:05:31] wants to go deeper
[2:05:33] and Joshua said to the people now I want
[2:05:36] you to remember their response let me
[2:05:39] read it one more time they choose you
[2:05:41] they respond by saying God forbid
[2:05:45] that we should forsake the Lord and
[2:05:47] serve other gods and they go to this
[2:05:48] whole thing it was the Lord who took us
[2:05:49] and Josh was in the verse 13 he cannot
[2:05:53] serve the Lord for he is a holy God
[2:05:58] he is a jealous God
[2:06:00] he will not forgive your transgressions
[2:06:02] nor your sins
[2:06:07] if he forsake the Lord and serve strange
[2:06:10] gods
[2:06:12] strange gods
[2:06:14] Gods we can't identify
[2:06:16] everybody have a strange God in the
[2:06:18] house sometimes your job is our God your
[2:06:21] car is a God the internet is a God and
[2:06:24] movies are God a movie star
[2:06:28] people following on social media rappers
[2:06:31] and R B singers strange gods
[2:06:35] who inspires me who inspires you strange
[2:06:39] gods
[2:06:41] where you get it from you're following
[2:06:43] this one you're following this one that
[2:06:45] one is a hero
[2:06:47] new trends
[2:06:50] strange Gods he said if you forsake the
[2:06:53] Lord and serve strange Gods then he will
[2:06:55] turn and do you hurt and consume you
[2:06:57] after that he had done you good
[2:07:03] so Joshua's problem with the Clarence
[2:07:06] if you already really want to have a
[2:07:07] time this convention if all you really
[2:07:09] want to break up the fallow ground if
[2:07:11] you really want the windows of Heaven to
[2:07:13] open he said If my people will humble
[2:07:15] themselves and pray and seek my face and
[2:07:17] turn from their Wicked Ways then they
[2:07:20] will hear from Heaven if that's the kind
[2:07:22] of people that you are
[2:07:31] and the people said unto Joshua verse 21
[2:07:33] knee but we will serve the Lord
[2:07:38] so they come with another testimony by
[2:07:41] the currents after the hearing that
[2:07:43] they're saying we are more committed is
[2:07:44] anybody committed to serving the lord
[2:07:46] anybody in the house committed they said
[2:07:48] well no because that means a lot that
[2:07:51] that means a lot
[2:07:52] if you're really serious if you're not
[2:07:54] serious I can't force you to be serious
[2:07:57] but if you're already serious about
[2:07:58] serving the law is anybody really
[2:08:00] serious about serving the lord
[2:08:03] because that is where the question that
[2:08:05] he was challenging on if you're really
[2:08:08] serious about this thing he said because
[2:08:10] if you're not serious God will kill you
[2:08:13] he will judge you he will strike you
[2:08:14] down that's what Josh was saying to the
[2:08:16] people if you forsake the Lord and serve
[2:08:19] strange Gods knowing what he has done
[2:08:21] for you he will turn unto you hood and
[2:08:23] consume you after that he had done you
[2:08:25] good
[2:08:27] hasn't he done you good hasn't he taken
[2:08:30] yours in a married clay hasn't he put
[2:08:32] your foot on a rock to stay
[2:08:37] let's Cast Away the strange gods
[2:08:44] I'll ask the question again is there
[2:08:47] anybody serious about serving the lord
[2:08:49] because as for me and my house we will
[2:08:53] serve the Lord
[2:08:59] [Music]
[2:09:00] don't make that statement lightly now
[2:09:02] don't just say it because it's a thing
[2:09:04] to say in this service
[2:09:07] because God will hold you to this we're
[2:09:09] going to get it to the next verse God
[2:09:10] will hold you to this thing now
[2:09:13] it's a contract
[2:09:17] it's a contract so if you don't really
[2:09:19] mean it check yourself
[2:09:21] check your heart
[2:09:22] check your life check your declaration
[2:09:25] do you really want to serve the Lord do
[2:09:28] you really want to be a Christian do you
[2:09:30] really want to give it all up and
[2:09:31] surrender do you really want the Holy
[2:09:34] Ghost do you really want Holiness and
[2:09:36] Purity and Faith virtue knowledge
[2:09:39] Temperance patience godliness broadly
[2:09:42] kindness do you really want this and the
[2:09:45] benefits that come with this like your
[2:09:47] family being set free if that is what
[2:09:50] you want then let him know let him know
[2:09:53] that's what you want
[2:09:56] Jesus is on the main line you could tell
[2:10:00] him what you want
[2:10:04] Joshua wasn't as trying for them to come
[2:10:07] to an understanding of it he wanted them
[2:10:10] to make a declaration
[2:10:12] you have to say it I won this thing he
[2:10:14] said you really want to serve the Lord
[2:10:16] he said we will serve the Lord
[2:10:33] verse 21 and the people said unto Joshua
[2:10:35] nay but we will serve the Lord
[2:10:39] if you are serious this morning I want
[2:10:42] you to lift your hand and say I will
[2:10:43] serve the Lord
[2:10:48] I want you to say it one more time I
[2:10:50] will serve the Lord
[2:10:52] only the serious if you're not serious
[2:10:55] you don't need to participate in this
[2:10:56] thing if you're not serious you could go
[2:10:57] downstairs if you're not serious you
[2:10:59] could leave but if you're if you're
[2:11:00] really really serious I want you to make
[2:11:02] this statement again I will serve the
[2:11:03] Lord
[2:11:06] I want to say it one more time I will
[2:11:08] serve the Lord
[2:11:12] verse 22 and Joshua said unto the people
[2:11:15] ye are witnesses against yourselves
[2:11:18] in other words you are saying it in the
[2:11:21] presence of yourselves you are now
[2:11:23] holding each other accountable to that
[2:11:25] statement you just made that I will
[2:11:27] serve the Lord oh God
[2:11:35] [Music]
[2:11:36] don't say it if you don't mean it but it
[2:11:40] is say that they really mean and I will
[2:11:41] serve the Lord he said you are witnesses
[2:11:43] against yourselves that you have chosen
[2:11:47] you the Lord to serve him and they said
[2:11:50] we Are Witnesses
[2:11:52] so do we have any Witnesses in the house
[2:11:55] this is a different kind of service now
[2:11:58] so I'm singing I I'm gonna serve the
[2:12:00] Lord and I'm a witness
[2:12:03] do we have any Witnesses in the house
[2:12:05] you're witnessing for your brother in
[2:12:08] other words I see but the answer me
[2:12:09] making a statement I'm his witness
[2:12:12] is my witness I'm your witness we are
[2:12:15] witnesses to each other that we are
[2:12:18] going to serve the Lord we are witnesses
[2:12:20] to each other that we are making a
[2:12:22] choice to turn back the strange Gods to
[2:12:26] throw away the filthy garments to throw
[2:12:29] away the ways of the flesh to put under
[2:12:32] our feet every unclean Spirit every
[2:12:35] doubt every unbelief in the mighty name
[2:12:38] of Jesus Christ
[2:12:41] [Music]
[2:12:43] we are contending for the faith we are
[2:12:46] fighting for every inch of ground we are
[2:12:49] taken back this is the first wave of the
[2:12:51] attack
[2:12:53] we will serve the Lord
[2:12:55] [Applause]
[2:13:08] [Applause]
[2:13:13] I'm almost done
[2:13:16] for this 22. you can replace something
[2:13:18] very Softly and Josh was sending to the
[2:13:21] people and Joshua that type of the Holy
[2:13:24] Ghost ye are witnesses against yourself
[2:13:26] in other words by the judge I'm counting
[2:13:28] on me to help hold me accountable and
[2:13:30] I'm Gonna Keep you accountable we Are
[2:13:32] Witnesses against ourselves
[2:13:36] iron sharpening iron
[2:13:40] because we have to make this thing
[2:13:42] together
[2:13:43] I'm not leaving nobody behind I'm not
[2:13:45] leaving nobody behind we're taking
[2:13:47] everybody with us as to me and my house
[2:13:50] we will serve the Lord your family has
[2:13:53] got to come I'm gonna help you but you
[2:13:55] got to help me you got to help your
[2:13:57] brother next to you you got to have your
[2:13:59] sister next to you but we will serve the
[2:14:01] Lord and I'm your witness and you are my
[2:14:04] witness so I'll pray for you but I need
[2:14:07] you to pray for me and I need to pray
[2:14:09] for your sister I don't need to pray for
[2:14:11] your brother
[2:14:11] [Applause]
[2:14:16] [Music]
[2:14:22] thank you
[2:14:24] verse 22. and Joshua said unto the
[2:14:28] people hear Witnesses against yourselves
[2:14:30] that ye have chosen you the Lord to
[2:14:33] serve him and they said we Are Witnesses
[2:14:35] and I can declare this morning I am a
[2:14:39] witness
[2:14:40] now therefore in verse 23
[2:14:43] put away said he the strange gods
[2:14:47] which are among you
[2:14:49] [Music]
[2:14:52] and incline your heart unto the Lord God
[2:14:56] of Israel
[2:14:57] I want you to catch this here it's a big
[2:15:00] point in a small verse they made a
[2:15:03] declaration
[2:15:04] he said you are witnesses but he knew
[2:15:07] that their statement was the first step
[2:15:11] of the way that there were still issues
[2:15:13] in their lives that had to be addressed
[2:15:16] so after the statement and after the
[2:15:19] fact that they agreed and after the fact
[2:15:21] that they had an understanding he said
[2:15:23] no therefore
[2:15:25] let's fix the issues he said put away
[2:15:28] the strange Gods which are among you and
[2:15:32] incline your heart unto the Lord God of
[2:15:35] Israel
[2:15:38] and the people said unto Joshua the Lord
[2:15:41] Our God will we serve and his voice will
[2:15:45] we obey
[2:15:46] [Music]
[2:15:54] verse 25
[2:15:57] so Joshua made a covenant with the
[2:15:59] people that day
[2:16:00] and set them a statute and an ordinance
[2:16:04] in shechem in that place in that place
[2:16:08] where Abraham became Abraham in that
[2:16:11] place where Joseph was sold to slavery
[2:16:14] in that place where his bones were
[2:16:16] buried Josh was stood on that sacred
[2:16:19] proud and made a covenant with his
[2:16:22] people
[2:16:24] [Music]
[2:16:28] thank you and Joshua wrote these words
[2:16:32] in the book of The Law of God
[2:16:34] and took a great Stone
[2:16:36] and set it up there under an oak that
[2:16:40] was by the sanctuary of the Lord
[2:16:42] and Joshua said unto all the people
[2:16:44] behold this Stone shall be a witness
[2:16:48] unto us for it have heard all the words
[2:16:52] of the Lord which he speak unto us it
[2:16:56] shall be therefore a witness unto you
[2:16:59] lest ye deny your God
[2:17:05] [Music]
[2:17:06] so Joshua was putting a claws inside the
[2:17:09] claws he said you declared it we
[2:17:13] witnessed it but he said the stone here
[2:17:16] also heard it these benches also heard
[2:17:19] it this altar also heard it oh God you
[2:17:23] don't hear me this morning this building
[2:17:26] heard it and if if we don't praise God
[2:17:29] then the rocks will cry out if we don't
[2:17:32] praise God the benches will cry out
[2:17:34] [Music]
[2:17:37] [Applause]
[2:17:40] so not only are your brothers and
[2:17:42] sisters Witnesses but the benches the
[2:17:46] stones this ground this Tabernacle is a
[2:17:50] witness of your declaration that you
[2:17:52] will serve the Lord it will stand as a
[2:17:55] rebuke to you if you walk away but to
[2:17:58] you who are hungry it will stand as a
[2:18:00] reminder of the Covenant
[2:18:03] that we made this day
[2:18:06] [Music]
[2:18:16] so Joshua
[2:18:18] let the people depart
[2:18:20] every man
[2:18:22] under his inheritance
[2:18:24] and church
[2:18:26] I'm finished it's time for me to depart
[2:18:29] it's time for you to depart under your
