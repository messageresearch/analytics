this is God Heritage and we are blessed to be part of this Harvest end time Harvest praise God to reap a bride for Jesus Christ to extend that elasa Ministry go get that bride oh blessed be the name of the Lord and before brother Stephan has come to us we have a greeting from Brother sham he'll come a minute but just want to share something with you and this is from 2 Timothy 3:16 it says all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction and righteousness and that in the Amplified they say every scripture is God breathed given by his inspiration profitable for instruction for Repro and conviction of sin for correction of error and discipline in obedience and for training in righteousness in holy living in Conformity to God's will in thought purpose and action and the thing about the gospel coming forth every scripture being God breathed is how the word is received and 1 Thessalonians 2:13 says for this cause also we thank we god without ceasing because when you have received the word of God which you heard of us you receive it not as the word of a man but as it in Truth the word of God which effectively worketh also in you that believe and in Amplified it says here and we also especially thank God continually for this that when you receive the message of God which you heard from us you welcome it not as the word of M men but as it truly is the word of God which is effectually at work in you who believe exercising it superhuman power in those who adhere to and Trust in and rely on it so this word that's being spoken is effective this word is effective depending upon how you receive it and you could rece receive it formally and outwardly or you could receive it willingly and inwardly and if you receive it willingly and inwardly it could have an Effectiveness in your life because the the many who heard it didn't re it it wasn't effective to them because they didn't have faith to receive it so how God want you to receive the word is willingly and inwardly not forly and outwardly and I am believing God this morning this evening that the pillar of fire would come down upon these sons of God and will speak to you the elect remember it's not about the minister it's about you the bride remember it's not about who is behind the pulpit is what the inspiration could speak remember God is God he is not God of your church he is God almighty praise God and he is no respect of persons he know your needs he know your tears he knows your fears he knows your weakness he knows your struggle he know just what you are here for and he's going to deliver and I'm believing that Pillar of Fire going to rest upon the sons of God and speak direct to you praise God praise God so it's a blessing and privilege you may be seated you want to play a song you sing something for me it's a blessing and privilege to have brother shm here he just celebrated 80 years he's a soldier a son a man who have been standing for this gospel this word for many many years and you see him there he wasn't always this age But as time roll on we get older but I said you know you could a man could be old that doesn't mean his fate is old a man could be old a man could be walking whatever that doesn't mean his Fai is crippled up God put Faith in Sons one of these days we will have a body change one of these days no more gray hair no more back pain no more aches it's a blessing praise God we going start something s so brother sh going to greet you and say a few words Hallelujah and bless you and then we're going to have the speaker come on and bless you this evening put a sh the r like me [Music] oh was but I see Amazing Grace amaz [Music] amen God bless you kindly take your seats this week amen my beloved bre Grace and peace be multiplied to you on this very special occasion as we come together for this International Convention I would like to first of all commend very highly brother too the host pastor who together with his associate ministers and the Believers of The Headstone Tabernacle who have all worked very hard to make these meetings possible my deepest respects to all the Servants of God present especially those who have traveled great distances to be here my prayer is that the Holy Spirit would anoint you and inspire you to deliver what has been laid upon your heart amen and of course I must greet the elect lady the lovely Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ [Applause] without whom these Services would be all in vain amen amen it is my esteem honor and privilege to address the gathering this afternoon in the absence of a provided team I sincerely hope hope that my few remarks would be relevant and appropriate as many of you would know I have been around the message for quite a long time over the past five decades I have made certain observation some of which I would like to use as a basis for my contribution from the breaking of the seals in 1963 to where we are presently it has been approximately 61 years and so I believe it is feir to see that our walk with this great message started many years ago it has been more than 60 years since the opening of the word and so I believe it is only reasonable to wonder how close or how far amen we are we are from our god-given goal you see friends it is my personal conviction the bride today is not as close to her Perfection as she ought to be given the length of time she has been exposed to the revealing of the word and when we consider the flashing red lights of the Lord's coming all around us not to mention the handwriting that is on the wall how could we not be concerned would it take us another 61 years to get to where we need to be what are the things that are hindering us from hitting the Target and achieving Our God given objectives should we be satisfied to continue the way we have been going when there are so many unfulfilled promises in the word of God which demand our urgent attention after all these years we are still awaiting the Fulfillment of Mark 11:23 St John 1412 the Greater Works the adoption of son of the sons of God the manifestation of the sons of God the bride's Revival which includes the restoration of missing limbs by the power of the spoken word and while we may and while many around the message says that our setbacks are due to doctrinal differences or doctrinal issues and problems relating to Doctrine I would like to suggest to you this afternoon that what we are facing is really a life problem right where the corrup of the people is not developing as it ought to be over the past 60 years many God inspired ministers have been expounding to the people The unsearchable Riches of Jesus Christ exploring in great details every major doctrinal truth of the message yet there are many little results which we can point to very little manifestation a whole lot of Dynamics and very little a whole lot of mechanics with very little Dynamics but saints of God I would like to present for our consideration the following quotation which I believe will help us to better understand what is responsible for the imbalance that we have been witnessing I am quoting from the message humble th July 63 paragraph 72 brother Vil speaks for 70 minutes on Mark 16:15 to2 and other scriptures entitled why has Mark 16 not worked and how according to the scriptures to make it work and here the prophet went on to tell us in paragraph 74 I was thinking here a one little illustration to back of what he said now we look to this watch to find out the time what time it is unless at every instrument in that watch is coordinating means to work together effectively and harmoniously with one another we will never know the correct time is that right amen and that takes all of us together if we want to see the third pool really do something for God is coordinating with every one of us together to Humble ourselves before God so here we see the prophet making a connection between the third pool and the humility that is required of the True Believer then he goes on to say in paragraph 77 you know people want power and really they don't know what power is see they don't really know what goes with it the Way Up Is Down always if you want Power see how humble you can get just get away from all your worldly thinking and humble yourselves before God and then you have got more power than the man that runs all over the building and makes a lot of noise see because you have been able to conquer yourself and commit yourself to Christ you see to humble yourself before him that's really power paragraph 78 you show me your church that's humble real humble not arrogancy a church just sweet humble I will show you a church amen that has the favor and power of God in it hallelujah amen which is Grace on the part of The Giver made accepted that's right that's the thing it takes humility humbling yourself before God letting God just work through us then as you continue to read read it in paragraph 103 of the same message the prophet goes on to say look at Jesus nothing but one bundle of Love see amen he was God manifested Amen he God expressed himself through him no wonder Miracles and things happen happened his humble life consecrated lives to God from being God to be a man here on Earth to express God for himself that's what made him what he was I always said what made Jesus God to me was the way he humbled himself he was so great and yet amen could be so small that's right you see friends it was for this reason that God's servant and Prophet to us Amen in his teaching on the SM chur a man without corruptor can't rain because power apart from corrup is satanic but Power with corrup is f to Rule now my friends if maybe I could briefly address another area of concern I believe that both ministers and Believers alike must demonstrate a deeper respect amen for each other and must treat each other with respect recognizing that in the kingdom of God Amen we all have our part to play I Am quoting from revelation of Jesus Christ chapter 4 paragraph 118 the prophet is saying tell me what to stop brother now everybody can be a preacher but you got a voice amen and if you can preach the people a sermon if you're a preacher you call to the pulpit the preacher if not you still are a preacher but live the people of sermon let your sermons be lived amen and it's a voice of God that will bring reproach to them who rejected amen they said no one could put a finger on his or her life amen they are sweet living if there was ever a man or woman of God it's that man or that woman see live your sermons Don't Preach amen if you are not called to be a preacher you get all mixed up and anyhow messed up and you you will get people tangled up and you won't know amen you'll ruin them and ruin amen yourself so just live your sermon the preachers called to preachers and to live it if you can't live it then startop preaching it but you are supposed to live your sermons all right Hear Voices amen oh how we need in in Jeffersonville live voices even in Trinidad we need some live voices amen the tunder of God thundering out in sweetness and Holiness and Purity UND Divine lives amen walking around into you today without a blemish yes sir real Christian that tunders against the enemy the devil don't care how loud you holler devil don't care how much you can jump or how much you can do this or that but What Hurts The Devil is a SE that Sanctified [Applause] holy Hallelujah What Hurts The Devil it's a seed that t Sanctified holy holy life consecrated to God say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be move right on oh my that throws him away that's the Thunder that shakes the devil paragraph 121 when he sees that life so clearly friends from what the prophet is saying here amen it's equally as important as the seven tunders Doctrine amen and saints of God just as important is a seven tunder life which must follow as I've often said Doctrine and life must go together Doctrine and practical Christian Living must be combined for the right Doctrine will always produce a righteous life arising out a Christlike character hallelu amen let me run it to quickly maybe I can remind you of what the prophet said in paragraph amen what the prophet said in the message is rising of the son 65 paragraph 30 Satan doesn't care how religious you are how right you are in your Doctrine if you miss that life you won't come up anyhow no matter how religious how good how many churches you belong to amen it doesn't matter to one thing unless you are born again and again in the message tou of a perfect man 62 paragraph 351 and that brings the faith of Jesus Christ The Virtue of Jesus Christ the knowledge of Jesus Christ The Temperance of Jesus Christ the patience of Jesus Christ the godliness of Jesus Christ the brotherly kindness of Jesus Christ these are all the Divine qualities of Jesus Christ and the love of God which is Jesus Christ he's the head that controls you you are the feet is the foundation Faith amen controlled by the head amen there is the perfect man of God when he possesses these virtues because they are perfected in him paragraph 354 amen and this being when it's completed is the Church of God that's going in direct you and this being when completed is a servant of God amen amen in the church that's going in the rupture Glory see what I mean there you are that's the full thing amen and this quotation shows us that the criteria for the Believers is the same criteria for the servant of God in paragraph 346 of the same message we hear the prophet saying now that is the house that God dwells in not a building with a bell on the top of it a high table amen see but a body hast thou prepared me a body that God can dwell in amen God can walk in God can see in God can talk in God can work in amen living instrumentality of God God walking on two feet amen and you Glory the footsteps of the righteous Hallelujah is ordered of God God walking in you you are written Epistles R of all men and if the life that's in Christ be in you Hallelujah you will bear that life that Christ bore so in closing you see friends as I conclude this sh remind this afternoon the prophet of God reminded us amen the prophet of God reminded us at this token amen we are also supposed to have to display is nothing short of the literal life of Jesus Christ and no and at no time should we ever underestimate me amen the power of the life so many tremendous things were spoken in the to in the token message which brother Bram considered to be his highlight message of his entire Ministry paragraph 324 332 we hear him saying our character is God's character what is it a little push over no so God is a god of judgment amen he's a god of correct it must be on underline nothing less will do that's the kind of corrector you are because you the character of your father and then in paragraph amen 333 I close he went on to say what the life yes watch it the life is took from the blood see the life itself it took see the life it took from the blood the blood was applied and the life could not come back on the believer then for the life of an animal amen but see listen to this but see instead of a human being it's a super super super human being see Hallelujah that makes the human being not only a human being hallelujah oh my not only a human being but he's a son and a daughter of God of the super super super super super life that was in him comes back upon you a church member amen hallelujah a denominational go Hallelujah to a born again Christian filled with the spirit the life of godj just flowing from you like Sparks from an anvil as you walk full of virtue amen and love gentl gentleness as the Holy Spirit moving thank you Lord speaking oh my there you are L last but not least the prophet clinches the point in paragraph 346 saying let me be a brother to a brother let me live an example of what Christ said a man should be let me be a brother to a brother a brother to a sister let me be a minister to a minister let me be an example of examples let me show to the world that this word is Christ the only way I could do it is to come into him I can do it in myself you can do it in yourself but let the word of God and you become one then it lives out your walking Epistle of Jesus Christ he God complete control of you to make every word live in closing May our Lord Jesus Christ bless these meetings and may He so use his servants in a very special way that when we come to the climax of these meetings there'd be a greater demonstration amen of life and Doctrine both mechanics and Dynamics not just power amen but Power with corrup which is the only Power that is f [Applause] toall we appreciate our brother sh Ali Rend sh Ali hallelujah oh oh let's let's sing that song is the sweetest name I know as we lift our hands oh

afternoon pray praise the Lord and for this opening born again and placed by the spirit for the word to manifest itself in you praise the Lord so you're going to be born by the spirit and you're going to be placed by the spirit for one reason that the word manifests itself in you praise the Lord for the life to come forth because the word is spirit and life and if you receive the word you receive spirit and life and it cannot stay dead the word but the word has to come alive praise the Lord so it brings the spirit down praise the Lord praise the Lord Brother stephus from where do you have your title the seat of discrepancy in 64 65 brother Brenham says therefore there cannot be nothing shadowy praise the Lord nothing shadowy in this message no Shadows Hallelujah nothing shadow just a genuine un adulterate word of God he said that's Son of God sons of God and Daughters of God praise the Lord no Shadows but real true Sons and Daughters of God who is not born by the will of men praise the Lord you are not born by the will of man you are not born by your father you're not born by your mother you're not born by the pastor you're not born by the preacher but you are born from above praise the Lord hallelujah who is not born by the will of man nor by shaking of hands or by some form of of baptism but you are born in the spirit of God brother Bram says you are born in the spirit of God so you're born into a place and that place is the spirit of God so you're born not in the world you're born not in a tribulation but you are born in the spirit of God that's your pre place that's your place that's your Dwelling Place praise the Lord praise the Lord but you're born in the spirit of God how by the Holy Ghost so the Holy Ghost B gives you a birth and it first places you in the Holy Ghost praise the Lord and the word manifesting itself through you praise the Lord so here I got my title for so there's a reason for the birth there's a reason for the place for the word of God to manifest itself in you do you love him praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord so brother brandham in the message the invisible Union of the Bride he says the word the word that's going to be manifest itself in you he said the word the part you are to play praise the Lord you have a part to play and in the scripture it's written your part in the message is written of your part and we heard praise the Lord the promises of Malachi 4 this morning praise the lord we heard him it's written praise the Lord the word the part you are to play was in God before the foundation of the world praise the Lord your part that you're going to play if you're young if you're old It Was Written already before the foundation of the world it was in God and God had s and God expressed some SS praise the Lord and you are coming here to fulfill your part and your part is not what Satan says your part is not what your neighbor says your part is not what your boss says your

predestinate you to fall he didn't predestinate you to sin he didn't predestinate you to go in the world but he predestined you to be Sons and Daughters of God praise the Lord he prested you when you are falling that you're going to stand up again your predestination is positive praise the Lord positive when you're sick you're going to be healed positive positive positive brother Bram says if Satan is attacking you he says do the opposite [Applause] [Music] [Applause] if he comes with a negative thought do the positive sing the SS of God praise the [Applause] lord it's an opening service praise the Lord and I have a burden it may be a platform for the great person to come down praise the Lord Brother brand him in 1960 he had an opening service in a convention in the message what it takes to overcome all unbelief our faith and he speaks about he says yesterday they had they had a day you may be seated he said they had a day at a rep Republican party and they choose Mr Nixon

Trump they're going ahead so brother brandom says the rep Republican party choose Mr Nixon they preached for several days praise the Lord so they are preaching and we are preaching he said they're building a platform for Mr Nixon and on their campaign and they finally when the party elected the man that they s that they wanted to run for presidency of our beloved United States He said finally when they elected the man he said the crowd cheered and joy and screamed and jump up and down because they had elected the man that they come in that campaign to El talk about the natural now let me talk about the spiritual praise the Lord now brother brandham says we have come here tonight and I say we have come here in the afternoon to elect a man praise the Lord not a minister but to elect a man and that man is the Lord Jesus Christ and brother PR says I'm I'm trying to build a platform for him tonight praise the Lord this ministers we are trying to build a platform for him tonight for him in the afternoon for him in the morning and we want to elect him praise the Lord praise the Lord I'm trying brother BR says I'm trying and I say in the afternoon I'm trying to brother brandham I'm

cleansing Soul Hallelujah it washes away all stain Hallelujah it cleanses the platform praise the Lord that the person can step in tonight [Applause] Hall we are preaching the word and the Bible says they will preach the gospel and the gospel came in demonstration of the power of the spirit praise the Lord that's the person that is coming in while the preaching is going on now in the message speak to the Rock praise the Lord Brother Braham says the gospel came to us not in word only did it came to you in word only did it came in word only or is there a spirit coming on he said but through Power demonstration of he says the Holy Spirit would come and demonstrate the gospel so it's not the minister demonstrating the gospel but it's the holy ghost coming on the platform demonstrating the gospel bring the word alive brother PR says bring the word to a living reality praise the Lord hallelujah praise the Lord the Holy Spirit he will bring it to pass a living reality praise the Lord and that's

it will come when you're born again and placed in the body when you're placed in the spirit of God it will come it will be there praise the Lord [Music] hallelujah now brother shal yes you may be seated and I have this quote in my notes when he comes how will it be how was it with our prophet in a message 65 praise the Lord in July 25th the prophet has was looking back on a long tra he had a few more months to live praise the Lord and brother Bram started to testify about a being coming into his life and I share the experience with you how the prophet experienced it and I believe it will be a blessing to you brother Bram said I wasn't the one that appeared down on the [Applause] river he said I was only standing there when he appeared and I pray every Minister that stands here while he preaches he starts standing when he is near I pray for every believer you're just standing near when he [Applause] appears brother Brandon says I'm not the one that performs these things or for tell these things that as perfect as they are brother says I'm not the one he says I'm only one that's near when he does it a son and daughter of God can say the same thing I'm only here when he appears I'm standing just next to him but he does it praise the Lord I'm only one that's near when he does it I was only the voice that he used to say it praise the Lord Lord how humble the prophet was he said I'm only a voice that he could use praise the Lord I wasn't what I knew it wasn't what I knew it wasn't the knowledge that brother bandam had it wasn't the things that he knew from the scripture he said it wasn't what I knew it was just I just surrendered myself to that he spoke through so it was the mind of God coming through him praise the Lord he not even knowing what he was saying but God using a wressle praise the Lord and speaking through him praise the Lord praise the Lord let me get through it it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no he said it was the manifestation of the son of man praise the Lord see how humble it was he said it was not me but it was the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that God unfolded praise the Lord talk about a three-fold mystery unfolding in the prophet brother branam and he was the wave shief what about you I was just standing near him when he appeared a three-fold mystery unfolding in The Bride of Jesus Christ all that what Christ was he poured it into the church I just was standing near him thank God for his grace but he choose me he choose [Applause] you it's not a man it's God the angel was not a son of man he Angel was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is Christ he is the one that you are feeding on so it's not a minister you're feeding on but it's him you're feeding on brother brandham says you are not feeding on a man his words will fail he said but you are feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man praise the Lord you're feeding and I'm just sending there but let the Holy Spirit come down and confirm the body word praise the Lord so I believe this meetings we are feeding from the unfailing body word of the son of man what do brother Bram said unfailing unfailing cannot fail it will accomplish the purpose that it's sent for and failing the body word is unfailing you will fail I will fail but the body word can never fail praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord Now give me a few examples David Daniel old David let's say Daniel let's say David it was not David that slew Goliath but David was one that was just standing near him when it [Applause] happened he just did the right thing by a personal revelation of the unfailing body word David had a revelation of the unfailing body word what was it I will bless those who bless you and whosoever curses you I will curse and David all his Brethren all Israel missed that Revelation they all missed it what they are but the bride will find out who she is praise the Lord Lord if you curse them you're cursed if you bless them you're blessed praise the Lord hallelujah and David got a revelation praise the Lord praise the Lord and so David he took the sling he took the stone but watch what happened God took over God took over David was was just one who was standing near when it happened praise the Lord talk about the anointing talk about the power of God coming upon David coming upon a slingshot coming upon the stone taking the stone and direct it in the head of Goliath praise the Lord praise the [Applause] [Music] [Applause] lord we talk about the Dynamics to the mechanics in this meeting watch the dynamic taken the mechanic and perform it and bring it to [Applause] life let me give another illustration you know Daniel and it makes it so simple because someone might still thinking but D but David had the sling and he shot a stone so I take Daniel it was not Daniel that held the lion's mouth it was not Daniel it was not him but he was just standing near when it happen praise the Lord we're building a platform for the great person to drop down and we just stand next to him praise the Lord when it happened when he would bring it to life every promise Daniel he just did the right thing by a personal revelation of the unfailing body word Daniel had a revelation praise the Lord all Israel that went with him praise the Lord they bowed down and and prayed and to the king but Daniel praise the Lord he was obedient to the word Exodus 20:3 thou shallal have no other gods before thee and it was open to Daniel what it meant he knew there was an almighty God and he's a jealous God he wants the glory for himself he wants the worship on himself he wants the praise to himself there's only one God pray to [Applause] him and in Deuteronomy 18 ver1 and if you Faithfully obey the voice of the Lord your God and being careful to all his Commandments that I command you today Daniel the Lord your God will set you high above all nations of the earth So Daniel had a revelation he had a revelation if he will not worship him if if he will not pray to the king he said there's a promise that the Lord God will set him overall praise the Lord don't fear praise the Lord hallelujah praise the Lord and when he was thrown in the Lion's dead he was just standing near when he appeared Hall that's three Hebrew boys praise the Lord praise the Lord they were hanging on to the unfailing body word what was written in Exodus 20 verse4 he said Thou shalt not make unto thee any Graven image Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them praise the Lord praise the Lord now in Isaiah 343 verse2 when you go through the rivers they will not sweep you away when you go through the fire you will not be burned praise the Lord and the three Hebrew Bo they had a revelation if they will go through the fire praise the Lord it shall not burn them and the Flames will not hound them Hallelujah was it them was it the three Hebrew boysall or were they obedient to the body word did they have a revelation of the body word praise the Lord they say if he fails he fails but we don't bow down anyhow but God cannot fail praise the Lord so here they went in a fiery furnace and when they went in they were just standing next to him when he appeared praise the Lord praise the Lord it was him bringing the promise to pass [Applause] what is the pride saying tonight what is he saying this afternoon it was not us it was not us we just had a revelation and acted upon it praise the Lord the body word just found us but it was not us I heard a cry of Mama Eagle did you heard a cry of Mama Eagle was it you or was Mama Eagle I just recognized who I am I surrendered my own life I received the word when he came praise the Lord I Sanctified my life to him praise the Lord now Sanctified life then I was just standing near him praise the Lord praise the Lord when the spirit of God God baptized me I was just standing near him I

speak how this great person is coming Hallelujah James 4:8 draw nigh unto God and He will draw nigh unto you praise the Lord now when you draw nigh to him you have to know where he is is that right or you might draw to any kind of Direction here or a direction here or a direction here but Draw N unto him so we know there's different places and different Realms and just want to bring it out as the as the Lord has given me praise the Lord and how we can draw nigh to him and what happens praise the Lord and I believe it will be a blessing to you he says this realm where we are living in we are living in a body and we are living in a realm of five senses is that true see taste feel hear praise the Lord five senses that can control the body and we are living in a realm where there's five senses the inlets of the of the spirit praise the Lord they are operating and this is a realm we are living in I would call it the zero realm zero level zero realm and by Nature we are born in that realm praise the Lord and you don't find Christ in that realm of your five senses Hallelujah so never go after your senses what you feel or whatever you don't find a person in there praise the Lord so the person must be in another realm is that right in that dram what you find is Vindication of his presence you find healings you find deliverances you find satisfaction you find vindications of his presence when he dropped down and was standing near you praise the Lord Vindication of him passing by in this realm it's wind ation his fruits is Vindication of his presence of his being it's in this realm you see vindications but the person himself is in another realm praise the Lord now in the message God perfecting his church 54 he said the first and brother Bram speaks about three Rs down and three Rs up he said now the first thing when you start down he said the first you find a ram here he's got the unsaved in it praise the Lord and I just is the unsaved ones in the round below brother brandham says it's the souls in prison that never repented if they would have only repented in the days of Noah they wouldn't be found in that place brother BR says demon possessed men spirits of th those fallen angels that repented not y back in the beginning that's the first realm down now brother Bram said the next realm is demons and the next is Hell itself and he says the world is influenced the world is influenced and you see it all over why is there where from where the influence is coming the world is influenced by these demon powers through this Trinity through these three Realms the world is influenced now brother Brenham says and the Christian are influenced by a spirit too they're influenced by the Holy Spirit I was just the one standing next to him influenced by the Holy

Christians praise the Lord the realm of the Holy Spirit is for Christians praise the Lord he brother BR says the ram where the righteous man is by the blood of Jesus Christ that is influenced and Born Again by the spirit of God Amen so the Born Again influenced by the spirit is finding himself in another realm no more in a realm of five senses but in another real and it says the next layer is angels and the next Heaven Is God so you have Holy Spirit angels and God and the Holy Spirit come past angels and came down to redeem sinner on level zero praise the Lord praise the Lord but he has a

brother Bram praise the Lord now let me connect said when he was speaking about the about the sleeping Saints praise the Lord hallelujah and I believe we're going out with a shout this afternoon praise the Lord now something is going on in a spiritual realm when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I want to nail it down the baptism of the Holy Ghost because something is happening in the spiritual realm something is happening in that Realm question and answers brother brandham says he says when you are born again he said you are not born of physical like a baby was but what's happened the spiritual Birth has come to you when you're born again a spiritual Birth has come to you you were standing just near and he came to you home praise the Lord praise the Lord now brother Bram says and while the spiritual birth is growing into your heart brother Bram says a spiritual birth it is a growing process into your heart praise the Lord add to your face knowledge Temperance add this virtues it's a growing into your heart it has a start but it will have an end and it's growing into your heart now watch out what brother Bram says and this and while he says while this process is going on this spiritual birth is growing in into your heart of God there is at the same time he said there's a physical or a Celestial body growing on the other side there's a Celestial body growing the spirit the bird is coming into you and you're growing in the stature of Christ praise the Lord in your heart the stature of Christ is growing and brother BR says why you are growing he says your Celestial body is growing too in which realm is he growing in a place where the Christians are who are influenced and Born Again by the Holy Spirit praise the Lord there is a physical our Celestial body growing and it has a purpose so you're this is growing here and over here's the celestial body growing he says it is growing to receive that spirit Hallelujah so brother pram says a Christian doesn't die he's just changing his habitation but it starts with the birst it starts with to be born again by the spirit it starts with the baptism of the Holy Spirit praise the Lord and it says then it starts to grow over there was the question in the book of Acts have you thank you Isaac received the Holy Ghost since you believed why because Paul knew he was translated he knew when you receive him he said the same time you receive him there's somebody something starting on the other side your cesal body is born and it's starting to grow from that time on [Applause] hallah GL while the new birth is growing here brother Bram says your copany is growing where is the celestial body growing in the realm of the Holy Spirit I say praise the Lord now brother Bry continues in question and answer 64 he said and when the life leaves this body now which life when that life that he gave you is leaving this body he he says it goes to that body to that Heavenly Body he said just as in other words let me say that in the same way just as when the body is presented on Earth the spirit comes in and when the spirit goes out of the body of the Mortal body there's a body waiting over there and your spirit brother say is is just the same way when you're born on this Earth praise the Lord and and you born in a Spirit came into the body brother branis the angel is there and giving you the spirit putting in it to the body and bring it alive and brother said in the same way the spirit will be transferred into that body praise the Lord brotheris for we know that after this Earthly Tabernacle be this solved we have one already waiting praise the Lord praise the Lord what did Brother bam said he said praise the Lord let me go back he said the spiritual birth is growing into your heart of God here and there is a physical Celestial body growing to receive that Spirit praise the Lord Brother Bram says in the message of four seal he says and I think any born again Christian is kind of an oddball to the world because you have changed you are from another [Applause] world you are not from this world but you are from another world your spirit is from across the CM praise the Lord praise the Lord now in John Jesus says and I give unto eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hands praise the Lord hallu praise the Lord hallelujah brother stephanus what do we have to do in this convention how we can we draw near him how can Psalm 23 become alive brother says the holy spirit is trying to get you to get to you the presence of his being here in his meetings in his afternoon the Holy Ghost showing you so beautiful Psalm 23 a reality what is it trying to do he's trying to get to you the presence of his being hereall look this way all too many read the Bible where it says acts 238 and I'm coming to closing repent and be baptized everyone you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remissions of the sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost how many know that scripture every Christian knows that scripture and brother Bram says and they just pass right on it they don't see it you wonder why people don't let themselves baptized in Water by the name of the Lord Jesus Christ brother Brandon says they don't see it so many pass right over it now brother brandom here has a secret he says if they saw it by getting into the spirit if they saw it young people if you can see that by getting in the spirit of this word they would know that if they want to receive the Holy Ghost that's right excess if you want the excess praise the Lord they would know if they want to receive the Holy Spirit they need to repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and then God would be Duty bound Duty bound he cannot change his mind Duty bound because it's his word and the Holy Spirit is bound to the word Duty bound to fulfill his word by filling them with the Holy Spirit praise the Lord but why so many didn't get baptized he says because they didn't get in the spirit of the word they never get in his Spirit or it would have happened to them exactly as the words say brother BR says pray to God for Revelation by his Spirit that's the first step get into the spirit while this meeting is going on the Promises is preached we can't start to play The Promise is starting to preach get into the spirit
