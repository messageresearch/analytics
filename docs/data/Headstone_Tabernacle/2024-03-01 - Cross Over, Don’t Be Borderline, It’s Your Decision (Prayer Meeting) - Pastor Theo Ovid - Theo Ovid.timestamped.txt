[16:51] is God Amen okay so tonight just for a
[16:55] few
[16:56] moments I have something to share with
[16:58] you cross over don't be borderline it's
[17:01] your
[17:02] decision cross over don't the
[17:07] borderline it's your decision now we
[17:10] find out that the journey that Israel
[17:12] took the journey we have that God put in
[17:15] our lives the journey was out of Egypt
[17:18] and to this Promised Land the land of
[17:20] Canaan that was natural and type okay we
[17:24] come out of the world and we are seeking
[17:26] a c who making buers God we are pressing
[17:28] know towards this thir Exodus out of
[17:31] this world the prophet
[17:35] speaks he says here you know what's the
[17:37] matter with the church today don't get
[17:39] in the spirit enough we are too much in
[17:42] ourselves if you get out of yourself
[17:45] long enough we get in a regular routine
[17:47] who cares about your routine I wish you
[17:50] get out of the routine long enough to
[17:52] get save anyhow get Sav get out of the
[17:55] routine we don't care about the routine
[17:57] get in this Spirit then you can see
[18:00] things done and this is the trouble
[18:02] today people just natural ordinary going
[18:04] to church go back home have no burden
[18:06] have no concern just in the message
[18:11] routine now let's
[18:14] go don't you do not want to be
[18:17] mistaken Satan has a power and that
[18:21] power is De he has a power of De Satan
[18:27] is the one who takes your
[18:30] life listen when God will let him do it
[18:35] but God can hold your life and
[18:40] Satan cannot take it until God lets him
[18:44] do it he can only use that power of God
[18:48] will let him use it isn't that wonderful
[18:50] and I find this is so so powerful so
[18:53] people do this and do that and then
[18:55] somebody dead no doesn't work so God
[18:58] have to allow Satan to take someone's
[19:01] life he had power talk about Satan and
[19:04] the power of death but he has no power
[19:07] beyond that just death ends his power
[19:09] after death here we go Faith sees the
[19:12] resurrection a god of Resurrection
[19:15] That's The Power of Faith to believe so
[19:18] he is standing listen tonight behind
[19:21] every
[19:23] trial every son that cometh to God must
[19:25] first be tried scor chastised and if you
[19:28] get a little heartache after you get
[19:30] born again a little trial that upsets
[19:31] you somewhere and you run back into the
[19:33] world it shows you wasn't a child to
[19:35] begin with you become a legitimate child
[19:37] not a child of God if a man once anchors
[19:40] his heart against the heart of Calvary
[19:43] all devils in hell will never Shake him
[19:45] no more he claims God so a man who
[19:48] cannot stand chastisement is a
[19:51] illegitimate child he claims God to be
[19:54] his father when he is not just tossed by
[19:57] every B of Doctrine not stable so when
[20:00] somebody not stable everything tossing
[20:02] them and whatnot they don't know where
[20:03] they standing they don't know what
[20:05] they're talking about but when a man is
[20:07] Born Again of the spirit of God he knows
[20:09] exactly where he's at now listen to this
[20:15] part they came to kenish Bania and this
[20:18] Kish Bania is where they sent out these
[20:20] 12 Spies and we know the story just in
[20:23] summary 10 of them brought a negative
[20:25] report K and Joshua came back afterwards
[20:28] and of course the whole Camp that's what
[20:30] a spirit does a spirit that comes into
[20:33] the church a spirit comes into a family
[20:35] Spirit come to our business a SP come to
[20:36] any environment negative Spirit it it it
[20:40] actually multiplies and affect others
[20:42] and there are people that recipients of
[20:45] negatives so Caleb and Joshua came back
[20:47] to meet the whole Camp of Israel in a
[20:50] negative mode a depression mode zoomed
[20:53] out zoomed in the own world and that's
[20:56] what K say let us go up at once and
[20:58] possessed that land it was as something
[21:00] in K's heart he brought word that was in
[21:03] his heart so this is the prophet saying
[21:04] you know when they come they were the
[21:06] border of the promised land and God
[21:09] wanted to confirm to them that this
[21:11] third P third phase this Dynamics and
[21:13] the mechanics all this power is correct
[21:16] it is what is Promised bring back
[21:18] evidence to the people so Caleb and
[21:19] Joshua brought back big grapes and
[21:21] evidence but the people who saw the
[21:24] grapes taste of the grapes and came back
[21:26] they say we can't take it because we saw
[21:28] giants and here they were on the border
[21:31] of the promised land you say hallelujah
[21:32] on the border and here's where they made
[21:35] a bus big mistake they stopped at the
[21:38] border let me say you say to you tonight
[21:42] I love you but there's too many
[21:45] borderline preachers today staying on
[21:48] the border God Don't Want You On the
[21:51] Border cross over and I have you get all
[21:54] in the promise is just beyond we find
[21:57] out
[21:58] that we have a lot of borderline
[22:00] preachers here we go that will preach
[22:02] just part of the truth and won't accept
[22:05] the rest of it all believers Brethren
[22:09] God doesn't want us on the borderline he
[22:11] doesn't want a borderline Pastor he
[22:13] doesn't want borderline Believers and
[22:15] borderline Believers is people who are
[22:17] on the edge they're not all in they're
[22:21] not all in to God they're not all in in
[22:23] serving God loving God they're not all
[22:26] in in putting their fear share and do in
[22:29] the church they're not all in but God
[22:31] want you all in he want to cross Jordan
[22:34] that's Deb that's the what you that debt
[22:36] is debt to what you think what you feel
[22:39] what you experience what your history is
[22:41] the background of your family and how
[22:43] you know you're shy or you're strong or
[22:45] you're bold it doesn't matter what we
[22:47] need to do is have a decision in our
[22:49] hearts to Cross Jordan and I'll show you
[22:52] why all right we find out if you are
[22:57] living on the board tonight come on over
[23:00] cross over Jordan there are great GPS
[23:04] over dear he said we got Joshua and
[23:06] calebs that went over the border and
[23:08] brought back evidence that the land is a
[23:11] good land the Full Gospel the Bible
[23:14] Divine Healing rejoicing happiness peace
[23:17] everything that the Bible promis every
[23:19] fruit is in this land it is yours at the
[23:22] asking but the first thing you have to
[23:24] do is to Cross Jordan so this is not a
[23:27] land to look by binoculars not a land to
[23:30] say a piece of paper and land no no no
[23:32] and we by Fai no no no there's a Jordan
[23:35] to cross you can't stay over there in
[23:38] the wilderness and expect to get it
[23:40] because the grapes don't grow like that
[23:42] over there so watch this now he said to
[23:46] send spies out each one of them of the
[23:48] 12 sent them across and 10 of them said
[23:51] we can't do it so this 10 is in the
[23:54] multitude so I want you to understand
[23:57] the multitude shoes are
[23:59] negative 10 out of 12 we can't do it so
[24:04] if you a person with Shifty eyes looking
[24:06] to the left looking to the right see how
[24:08] this one moving and that one moving
[24:09] everybody moving so you have no
[24:11] Revelation if you follow everybody
[24:13] moving so you have to get a revelation
[24:15] of what God promised and what God have
[24:18] said CB said we can do it that's true
[24:22] like for Jericho they have wall of the
[24:24] people so big but you see 10 of them
[24:27] with teans
[24:28] they were looking at what they could see
[24:30] intellectually but Caleb and Joshua was
[24:33] looking at God's promise and God told
[24:35] the prophet to write let us stand like
[24:37] Joshua and Caleb stop looking at your
[24:40] feelings at your conditions at your
[24:42] situations and and things around you
[24:44] with your eye taste smell SM touch
[24:47] whatever around you and look to what God
[24:49] promised I already given it to you you
[24:52] go and take it and that's what the
[24:55] matter with people tonight in Divine
[24:56] Healing it's yours God promis you to
[24:59] walk Breen you believe it you have to
[25:01] take it God promis you life brother do
[25:03] you believe it take it God promis you
[25:05] Joy brother do you believe it take it I
[25:07] will give it to you it's yours now here
[25:10] we go it wouldn't be right for God to go
[25:14] and Dish all the things out he give them
[25:16] the land they have got to do some house
[25:18] cleaning it is yours but he ain't going
[25:21] to come and poke it down your neck you
[25:23] have got to take the land yourself he
[25:25] give it to you and it is you your rise
[25:28] and possess it and this rise and possess
[25:31] it is also a
[25:32] choice and this I is a choice and he
[25:35] said hallelujah it's your choice and
[25:37] that is what if you want to murmur like
[25:39] the others then did you'll wander in the
[25:41] wilderness a long time longer till
[25:45] tomorrow night still sick but if you're
[25:47] ready you take it tonight it's yours
[25:49] what kind of choice you're going to make
[25:51] I will take Jesus on his promise and
[25:53] tell the Devil he's a liar now you
[25:56] notice the Bible said the spirit speaks
[25:58] expressly in the latter days some shall
[26:00] depart from the faith in this message
[26:02] given he to seducing spirits and
[26:05] doctrines of devils and they be lovers
[26:08] of Pleasures more than lovers of
[26:11] God so even though God said the promise
[26:14] is ours and go take it there's a process
[26:18] to go and take this thing and Joshua
[26:21] knew that God promised the land before
[26:25] them so he told them sanctify and get
[26:28] ready for we are going to cross over and
[26:30] how I thank God that we get a little a
[26:34] little once a month pray and fast and
[26:36] you feel free to do more than once a
[26:38] month but it's is to hold things steady
[26:42] because Jesus said not if you fast but
[26:44] when you fast he says sanctify
[26:46] yourselves and get ready we're going to
[26:48] cross over so it's not cross over and
[26:50] anything goes cross it's not like that
[26:53] if there ever was a call to the church
[26:56] to sanctify yourselves and get away from
[26:58] the things of the world we are ready to
[27:00] cross over there's the point if you
[27:02] figure you have still your glue up in
[27:04] the world and you still want stuff out
[27:06] there then you don't want to commit to
[27:09] make a decision to drop everything and
[27:11] cross drop everything sanctify yourself
[27:14] that's a choice you have to make the
[27:17] pastor can make it for you the church
[27:18] can make it for you your husband or wife
[27:20] can't make it for you you say are you
[27:22] ready tonight to throw away sanctify
[27:25] yourself from all unbelief
[27:28] this is your choice are you ready to
[27:31] sanctify yourself to you people tonight
[27:33] if you can't have faith enough let's
[27:35] move on towards Jordan tonight maybe you
[27:37] have never passed this way before let's
[27:39] pass this way tonight you say I never
[27:42] did it before I'm going to try tonight
[27:44] this all go in know words stop thinking
[27:46] about you and what you want and your
[27:49] family and what the church is and church
[27:51] not with you and this and that and you
[27:53] have this issue and all kind of that's
[27:55] foolishness that is only your human
[27:56] Spirit you will not fac no Lions then
[27:58] you go to cast you no Lake um the fiery
[28:01] furnace what test have you been through
[28:03] it's just you and yourself you and your
[28:05] pride you and your selfishness you and
[28:08] your own desires all right but said this
[28:12] here no was
[28:13] them no one never knows what those
[28:16] Visions does to me they are awful harder
[28:19] than me and he's speaking about his own
[28:21] visions and stuff then he said these
[28:23] words so the church is not in its right
[28:27] state
[28:27] yet we have to remember that it is not
[28:32] matured so we just have to linger and do
[28:36] the best we can and there is no one can
[28:40] bring it to maturity only the Holy
[28:43] Spirit as we listen to it and I don't
[28:46] believe it will ever come by man it will
[28:49] have to come by God and you know this is
[28:52] such a powerful thing I have met older
[28:56] folks that are immature men that are
[28:58] immature women that are immature wives
[28:59] that are immature husband are immature
[29:02] fathers mothers immature and the thing
[29:05] about
[29:06] maturity you can't teach
[29:08] it I want think about that you hear
[29:12] people talk tough and it's like good
[29:17] Lord when are they going to get mature
[29:19] to cut the crap out to cut the pettiness
[29:22] out to cut the foolishness out to get a
[29:25] little deeper I'm not talking about
[29:27] spiritual now just talking about
[29:29] natural
[29:30] and and from a natural standpoint it
[29:34] takes mature it takes time and
[29:38] experience for some people to get
[29:41] mature to accelerate that you could
[29:44] understand while uh Paul said when I was
[29:49] a child I speak as a child I understood
[29:53] as a child but when I became a man I put
[29:57] away with
[29:58] childish because it's a different
[30:00] operation you know a child yeah yeah
[30:03] they promise a child and the child
[30:04] wonder he child when the child will get
[30:06] something is a stampede is a is a mash
[30:09] up the place is a car on we all have
[30:12] children and they go to this tantrum and
[30:15] we see Believers put on some Tantrums
[30:18] because they get what they want and how
[30:20] it's supposed to work out they would
[30:22] even Rock back on we know all things
[30:23] work together for good to them that love
[30:25] God they not go in there they are angry
[30:28] they're upset they mad and and
[30:32] everything else all in their human
[30:33] Spirit have nothing do with God has do
[30:35] with in the spirit of the Lord has
[30:37] nothing to do with that it's just Flesh
[30:39] and Blood name to be mature Paul talk
[30:43] about I become all things to all men
[30:46] that by all means I might save some
[30:47] sometime ago I was talking about Paul
[30:49] talk about I know what it is to be
[30:50] hungry I know what is to be full all
[30:53] these things are part of the package it
[30:55] doesn't have to be how your spirit of
[30:58] entitlement feel it's supposed to be so
[31:00] it's supposed to work for you but you
[31:01] have no concern about your brother and
[31:03] sister it's supposed to work for your
[31:04] family but you have no burden for
[31:06] another family and most of the times we
[31:08] have seen it over and over when you help
[31:10] others God come and help you when you
[31:11] bless others God come and bless you when
[31:13] you serve others God come and serve you
[31:15] it's it's it's it's God is just he loves
[31:19] Justice he loves to see the right thing
[31:21] you love to see and give the right
[31:23] reward this is the god I re to amen all
[31:26] right so let's you could wrap this up
[31:28] here so the church is not in the right
[31:31] state yet we said that oh go all right
[31:32] so let it's close now you want to know
[31:34] why I read the script about Rebecca all
[31:37] right
[31:38] so elezar go and get a bride for Isaac
[31:43] and you know what he did he prayed and
[31:45] it just goes to show how he must pray
[31:47] over all things and I'm about to read
[31:49] something that is powerful so hang in
[31:52] there bear with me he said now you know
[31:56] we have been forced to make
[31:58] decisions there's times when we have to
[32:01] come to the place where we have to say
[32:02] yes or no that's just human life there
[32:06] are time where we cannot stand neutral
[32:08] and if God shall permit I don't believe
[32:10] we'll ever be leave this church tonight
[32:13] in the same condition that we did if the
[32:15] Holy Spirit shall come and do his work
[32:17] among us we are forced to say yes or no
[32:20] we cannot remain the same this is the BM
[32:22] I'm going to read here now you
[32:24] see God don't
[32:27] make all of our decisions this is the
[32:31] B so you waiting on God you won't God
[32:35] show you this God show you that show you
[32:38] the other and God waiting on you to see
[32:41] what decisions you would
[32:43] make God Don't Make all our decisions
[32:48] and there are many times that God
[32:51] doesn't tell His prophets just what to
[32:54] do because here we go they they have to
[32:58] make the decision if there is no
[33:00] decision that we have to make just wait
[33:03] every move on God then there is no
[33:06] overcoming on our part and sometimes
[33:10] talk about the prophets they make the
[33:11] wrong
[33:12] decision so the time has been allotted
[33:15] here we go to every man to make his
[33:18] decision whether he's a preacher
[33:21] decision coming to him or a prophet
[33:24] decision coming to him or a church
[33:26] member or whatever more he's got to make
[33:30] a decision now elasa was confronted with
[33:33] a great problem like ministers do there
[33:35] was a lots of woman he could choose from
[33:37] his choice was urgent so he had us to
[33:40] move quickly and he said don't gamble
[33:43] tomorrow tomorrow may never come for
[33:45] you it's the most Rel you talk about
[33:49] investment right people who really
[33:52] concerned about their money and the
[33:53] investment would invest in some fly by
[33:55] nighting just the other day some Fly by
[33:57] Night people Los money a fly by
[34:01] nonsense but no they will invest their
[34:04] savings and their money and something
[34:06] that is reputable something that have
[34:07] stability something have years wrong so
[34:10] he's talking about investing your soul
[34:13] and if people know to invest money in
[34:15] and they want to know that it's a proper
[34:17] bank or whatever whatever whatever to
[34:19] invest your soul and your future in
[34:22] eternity he say invest in an
[34:24] oldfashioned Pentecostal experience it
[34:27] has been time tested and proved to be
[34:29] the truth 2,000 years haven't changed it
[34:32] and the same dividends that was paid off
[34:35] at Pentecost is still being paid off by
[34:38] this film The Gift of the Holy Spirit
[34:40] the power of healing to see visions and
[34:43] Angels appear to you we are on
[34:46] Borderland tonight the Bible said I
[34:48] would all things you prosper and being
[34:51] good health is yours God promis it and
[34:54] the promise to you as good as it was to
[34:58] Israel I have given it to you I have
[35:01] sent an angel before you to guide you
[35:03] into this place and I'm Clos
[35:05] him the same God made the promise of
[35:08] Israel made it to you and he's the same
[35:11] yesterday today and forever send the
[35:13] same signs one of the Miracles he a
[35:15] going to come and push it down on you
[35:17] you're going to have to take it and as
[35:19] soon as you claim it there stand an old
[35:22] Amor standing there kick him out of the
[35:24] way if it's unbelief against us God's
[35:27] word kick it out of the way the promise
[35:29] is yours so tonight friends I want to
[35:32] challenge
[35:33] you to consider making decisions instead
[35:38] of you waiting and you're sluggish and
[35:40] you're slow take
[35:43] action make
[35:45] decisions Cross Jordan and when you hear
[35:49] Cross Jordan tell yourself cross J
[35:52] tonight I going I'm going all in it
[35:56] doesn't make no sense we hang around the
[35:58] bord because only when Joshua cross over
[36:01] God could tell Joshua this day I will
[36:04] magnify you before Israel he couldn't do
[36:08] that before Jonah our inheritance is not
[36:11] in argument and debate with any message
[36:13] believer in this message with no
[36:14] foolishness that not our inheritance
[36:16] lies our inheritance is in the Holy
[36:18] Ghost no man controls that no man has
[36:22] that the prophet said the maturity only
[36:25] the Holy Ghost could produce that so all
[36:27] this manufacturing we are the bride and
[36:30] and I'm the the bride all them kind
[36:32] of a kind of drama that people have been
[36:36] patched up with fooled and deceived
[36:39] thinking they sitting down in some
[36:40] church in the message thinking that they
[36:42] bride because they are there they have
[36:44] been deceived and lied to we have to
[36:48] understand how many of Israel was dear
[36:51] following them 10 ministers saying we
[36:54] cannot take it and Joshua and KB KB
[36:58] stood up there and said let us go up at
[36:59] once not later not next week not next
[37:02] year at once and they were giants there
[37:05] and both sides knew it the 10 who
[37:07] brought the negative new Giants joshu
[37:09] knew they Giants but them saying away
[37:12] with the Giants this is what God
[37:14] promised and I see that same thing
[37:15] tonight God promised a genuine Holy
[37:18] Ghost Revival a genuine breakthrough
[37:20] that will come to individuals Revelation
[37:23] come to individuals you are a majority
[37:25] in God you in your house tonight you are
[37:29] powerful in your little room tonight
[37:32] your knees are powerful your prayer is
[37:35] powerful God is waiting for you to make
[37:38] a decision to say you know what I am now
[37:40] surrendering my entire life to God I'm
[37:43] not looking for boyfriend first and then
[37:44] pray God afterward looking for
[37:45] girlfriend first looking for husband
[37:47] looking for wife looking for money
[37:48] looking for increase and job and
[37:49] everything no I'm putting God first and
[37:52] he will sort things out do you know
[37:55] somehow Rebecca got something that she
[37:58] could
[37:59] respond she didn't even know that she
[38:02] was being
[38:03] inspired to offer that man water and his
[38:07] camels just as he
[38:08] prayed and and that man wasn't an extra
[38:11] man he was a
[38:13] servant he was
[38:15] a so you can't pray about your children
[38:18] specific I know general I'm not a
[38:21] general prayer I'm not talking about
[38:23] bless me Lord bless my family not that
[38:25] I'm talking about
[38:27] specific down to the
[38:29] detail look I'm
[38:32] closing look when he got to the
[38:35] house Rebecca see nothing yet his mother
[38:39] and brother talking all right I recn God

[39:29] walls like how you s up the men to build
[39:32] the temple God stir them up the love of
[39:35] many waxing cold gross Darkness covering
[39:37] the Earth and there's a entitlement and
[39:40] a largy and and a sluggishness that is
[39:44] in the message we want to reject that we
[39:47] want a church on fire we want a bunch of
[39:49] people on fire they're going through
[39:51] hell they're going through all kind of

[1:32:13] we close I just have a few words just as
[1:32:17] we close before we close in prayer Final
[1:32:19] close words uh I just is just come to me
[1:32:22] to share this with you as we close to
[1:32:25] not to make a decision is to make a
[1:32:28] decision doing nothing is a
[1:32:31] decision not acting on the word is a
[1:32:34] decision when you make a decision you
[1:32:37] are
[1:32:38] responsible you are in charge of that
[1:32:41] decision when you don't make a decision
[1:32:44] the condition and the situation around
[1:32:47] you will make the decision for you and
[1:32:51] I'll give give you an
[1:32:53] example that if you have a tire and you
[1:32:56] know the tire going down you have a
[1:32:58] little on it sometime people want to run
[1:33:00] the tire down to as close as possible
[1:33:02] what you call pun face you don't want to
[1:33:05] buy the tire yet now if you make a
[1:33:07] decision to purchase the tire on time
[1:33:11] and change that tire then the driving
[1:33:14] goes smooth if you don't make that
[1:33:17] decision and mov by feet with a tire
[1:33:20] that barely have
[1:33:22] grues on it then you could end up in a
[1:33:25] real hassle shut down with a flat tire
[1:33:27] somewhere in the middle of nowhere
[1:33:29] because you didn't make a decision that
[1:33:32] you could have taken so to me it doesn't
[1:33:35] make no sense letting life and life
[1:33:39] whims and fancies and situations and
[1:33:41] people around and Circumstance make that
[1:33:43] for you you make that decision yourself
[1:33:46] you know I was thinking about what was
[1:33:48] here tonight and how Joshua had to Cross
[1:33:51] Jordan with the people not just the
[1:33:54] people Crossing Jordan but Joshua
[1:33:57] himself had to cross Jordan and I was
[1:33:59] thinking about in the upper room not
[1:34:01] only Mary was there and Mary Magdalene
[1:34:04] and Peter and John all the disciples all
[1:34:06] the pastor Prophet evangelist the whole
[1:34:08] 5old Ministry and congregation was in
[1:34:11] the upper room all was the Cross Jordan
[1:34:14] we still need the C it's a cost it's a
[1:34:18] price you have no idea what what it is
[1:34:21] to be a pastor what it is to be in
[1:34:23] Ministry what it is to be called to
[1:34:26] serve and the sacrifice that is required
[1:34:28] whether it's family whatever it is it
[1:34:31] cannot be a selfish thing it canot be a
[1:34:34] my own thing it's a sacrifice it's a
[1:34:36] calling it's a
[1:34:38] responsibility and to yield and
[1:34:40] surrender to that call it has cost it's
[1:34:44] a price and nobody will really know you
[1:34:48] the congregation people wouldn't really
[1:34:49] know what it cost cost for someone who
[1:34:53] have committed and surrendered to serve
[1:34:55] the Lord and to serve his people it's a
[1:34:58] price and it's harder on the minister
[1:35:01] because he has some serious decisions to
[1:35:04] make not everybody would agree not
[1:35:07] everybody would support but he still
[1:35:09] have to make decision can I please
[1:35:11] everybody that fleshly people carnal
[1:35:13] people selfish people um natural people
[1:35:17] all kind of people and they come to
[1:35:19] church and you still have to minister
[1:35:21] the word of minister to his people with
[1:35:22] the love of Christ and the concern of
[1:35:25] God with compassion and with mercy and
[1:35:28] and extent to them and everything else
[1:35:31] we choose not to Broad beat and be uh be
[1:35:35] be terrible and manipulative and
[1:35:37] controlling we choose to to to to extend
[1:35:41] ourselves and to present ourselves we
[1:35:42] choose to shun arrogance and pride and
[1:35:45] go lying with jealousy and and and and
[1:35:47] and and have a party with hatred and
[1:35:49] Malice and strife and these guys we
[1:35:52] choose that and it's a choice we have to
[1:35:54] make a choice to forgive a choice to let
[1:35:57] things go a choice to raise above the
[1:36:00] fears of the people a choice to look at
[1:36:03] their struggles and everything else and
[1:36:04] believe that they going to have
[1:36:05] breakthrough believe that the parents
[1:36:07] will make decisions we see parents
[1:36:09] failing we can't make decisions for the
[1:36:11] parents the child is in your house
[1:36:14] decisions you make is your decision
[1:36:17] because it's your house you can't tell
[1:36:18] me the child doing this and child doing
[1:36:20] that no you allowing that
[1:36:21] you choosing to allow that is decisions
[1:36:24] that we all have to make and sometimes
[1:36:28] children don't understand when they get
[1:36:30] to be adults and they get older and they
[1:36:32] get their own families then they might
[1:36:34] get a different picture of what it was
[1:36:36] to manage a home and a family so may God
[1:36:39] bless you thanks again for listening but
[1:36:42] I want you to know not making a decision
[1:36:46] is a decision you decide not to make a
[1:36:49] decision and there's a cost that goes
[1:36:51] with doing that the cost is the
[1:36:54] consequences of not choosing and making
[1:36:58] the right decision sometime it costs
[1:37:01] generation let us bhead heavenly father
[1:37:04] I thank you for this word tonight and I
[1:37:07] pray that it will be engrave in your
[1:37:09] people's heart to see how Saints of old
[1:37:13] made great decisions Abraham choose to
[1:37:16] come out lot choose not to look back
[1:37:20] each one had decisions to make even
[1:37:23] Jacob he had to make a decision he want
[1:37:25] that Bo right he had to choose to get
[1:37:28] that Bo right B necessary and he got it
[1:37:32] and you say you love that man I love
[1:37:35] Jacob he wrestled he made a choice to
[1:37:39] hold on all night long and his he was
[1:37:42] changed he got a new name go Jesus each
[1:37:46] one the disciples they have to follow
[1:37:49] they have to choose to follow Peter even
[1:37:52] though he ran away even though he denied
[1:37:54] even though he felt shame and
[1:37:56] embarrassed and cried and wet he knew
[1:38:00] the word spoke after converted strength
[1:38:02] the Brethren he knew he was going to be
[1:38:04] converted he knew inside was going to be
[1:38:06] changed oh Jesus let us not rest Lord
[1:38:09] until inside is changed their are
[1:38:12] marriages here husband and wives mothers
[1:38:15] fathers homes
[1:38:17] longstanding but the change is necessary
[1:38:20] the Chang is needed not the changes in
[1:38:23] just going to church but the inner
[1:38:25] change the inner man to be changed and
[1:38:27] transformed by the father almighty God
[1:38:30] may this be a sobering time for each
[1:38:31] person Lord as we come together this
[1:38:34] coming Sunday May your presence be
[1:38:36] preeminent May the anointing Break Forth
[1:38:39] May the Fire Fall the SAS come with the
[1:38:41] closing of the altar to burn and to
[1:38:44] cleanse and sacrifice oh God sanctify
[1:38:46] the church sanctify lives sanctify the
[1:38:49] people sanctify the ground
[1:38:51] may they come to church and knowing
[1:38:53] they're coming on holy grounds and may
[1:38:55] the far fall may be such that the
[1:38:58] minister can't Minister because of the
[1:38:59] glory of God may be such like when
[1:39:02] Solomon Lord when he finished the glory
[1:39:04] fill the Tabernacle fill every house
