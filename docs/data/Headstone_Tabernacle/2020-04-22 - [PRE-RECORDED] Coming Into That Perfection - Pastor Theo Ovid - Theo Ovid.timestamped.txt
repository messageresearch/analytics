[15:21] prophecy there is a process to get to
[15:25] that prophecy Matthew two three and six
[15:29] when Herod the King had heard these
[15:30] things three wise men come in the city
[15:34] instead of all where is he
[15:36] born King of the Jews because we see a
[15:38] star in the east

[16:36] come to talk about marriage he never
[16:39] come to discuss some things with no
[16:40] men's association that Denis Tornillo

[17:14] [Applause]
[17:19] and then preachers both hoo-hoo-hoo
[17:23] talking about and in and Moses message
[17:32] so when Herod the King got these reports
[17:36] these these shaken nation dynamical
[17:40] effect this thing that a ship the
[17:42] mission slow quick let's go right up to
[17:44] the king you know to the top level when
[17:47] Herod the King have heard these things
[17:49] he was troubled not only and all
[17:52] Jerusalem with him
[17:53] Oh hallelujah
[17:58] oh my you don't wanna see again comin
[18:02] all Jerusalem will be shaken will be
[18:07] shaken what's happened a bride this
[18:10] covenant is that
[18:13] [Applause]
[18:15] Oh hallelujah last week when that which
[18:20] is perfect is come go to a pot pack is
[18:24] accepted on kill you know what I'm
[18:28] seeing part is okay on pill but when
[18:32] that which is perfect is come dropping
[18:34] part the preserving perfection
[18:38] oh how you with me now do you see it
[18:43] when they got it together all the chief
[18:45] priests the scribes and Pharisees the
[18:46] guy together so no doubt they got it
[18:48] together because I hear something he
[18:51] demanded of them where Christ should be
[18:53] born no did this that should be the top
[18:57] of the town they should have know that
[19:00] because it had all the courts that Moses
[19:02] scrolls that all the word that 400 years
[19:05] the talk about Moses head and all this
[19:07] head and the prophecy said but no I'd be
[19:11] man come tell me when he was above new
[19:13] born in Bethlehem of Judea for thus it
[19:19] is written by the process the court in
[19:21] Scripture if I be taught in Hanna Judah
[19:27] I've known the least of the princes of
[19:28] Judah for all talisha come a governor
[19:30] that's a room where people Israel that
[19:36] is the prophecy
[19:38] unless occurred a process and I came to
[19:44] pass in those days that the window the
[19:46] decree is a Luke chapter 205 from Caesar
[19:50] Augustus that all the world shall be
[19:52] taxed
[20:01] and this tax most ways made my Cyrenius
[20:03] government of Syria and all went to be
[20:06] taxed everyone in his own City and
[20:08] Joseph also went up from Galilee out of
[20:12] the city of Nazareth into Judea into the
[20:16] City of David which is called Bethlehem
[20:18] to be taxed with Mary his exposed wife
[20:23] being great with child so the prophecy
[20:26] said Jesus can be born in Bethlehem but
[20:29] Mary is not in Bethlehem how does the
[20:33] prophecy fulfill what is the process
[20:38] that takes it to fulfillment it's one
[20:43] thing to another prophecy but what about
[20:45] the process the process means taxation
[20:48] they talked the process means order have
[20:51] to come down to get Mary to move from
[20:53] that position to your position what
[20:56] about the prophecy over your land
[20:58] [Applause]
[21:03] to every prophecy Daniel there's a
[21:06] process could we give the Lord a shout
[21:08] in the house
[21:09] [Applause]
[21:18] prophecy John 20:21 Jesus and unto them
[21:21] peace be unto you as my father sent me
[21:23] even so send I you when he had said this
[21:25] he breathed on them receiving the Holy
[21:28] Ghost prophecy recvd Holy Ghost somebody
[21:40] wanna test someone he told me receive a
[21:42] little ghost didn't tell em you are evil
[21:43] he goes he didn't receive any who legal
[21:47] but look at the process Luke 24:49 says
[21:52] and behold I send the promise of my
[21:54] father upon you but tarry ye in the city
[21:57] of Jerusalem until you be endued with
[22:00] power from one hang and he let them far
[22:04] as the Bethany lifted up his hands bless
[22:07] them and it came to pass while he
[22:09] blessed them he was parted from them and
[22:11] carried up into heaven and they worship
[22:14] and returned to Jerusalem with great joy
[22:16] and they were continually in the temple
[22:19] praising and blessing God that was the
[22:23] process it can be power coming down and
[22:26] you know part of the process it can be

[36:22] difference this morning
[36:23] [Applause]
[36:32] every season I doubt very much I would
[36:39] be but the finish this yesterday so
[36:43] Sylvie did notice one time to be
[36:46] continued next week in court I know God
[36:53] is not just concerned about you getting
[36:58] to the finish line but how you get there
[37:06] because some people take shortcuts
[37:13] first Corinthians 9:24 227 states know
[37:19] ye not that they which run in a race run
[37:21] all but one receiveth the prize so run
[37:26] that should be obtained and every man
[37:30] that striveth for the mastery is
[37:32] temperate in all things now they do it
[37:35] tucked in a corruptible crown but we an
[37:37] incorruptible deer for I mrs. Paul know
[37:40] this is not I talking bad about Paul
[37:43] this is Paul giving his own testimony
[37:46] this is Paul's testimony copy CML what
[37:50] say I deer for sure run not as
[37:55] uncertainly so fight I not as one a
[37:58] piece of the air but I I pour I keep my
[38:04] body and bring it into subjection this
[38:09] is process now
[38:11] to get to the end product of the Reese
[38:14] to win this race I keep my body and
[38:18] bring it on the subjection least by any
[38:21] means when i have preached to others i
[38:24] myself should be a castaway paul was
[38:29] playing was insane hi brother Paul you
[38:32] remember you respect the Apostle Paul he
[38:35] wasn't talking that he was bringing it
[38:37] on real he was saying you know what if I
[38:40] don't get this right I'll be a castaway
[38:42] so I want to get this thing right now
[38:45] the amplified says now every athlete who
[38:50] goes into training conducts himself
[38:53] temperately and restricts himself in all
[38:57] things they do it they win a reach that
[38:59] was louisa who we do it to receive a
[39:02] crown of eternal blessedness that cannot
[39:04] wither therefore I do not run
[39:07] uncertainly without definite aim I do
[39:11] not balk like one bit in the air I'm
[39:12] striking with an anniversary these are
[39:15] air boxes on you if you don't women
[39:18] there's nobody there so all you doing
[39:24] you doing motions and there's no Vienna
[39:27] media you have no bull to fight yellow
[39:30] mania man you have no yeah haven't got
[39:33] nothing or do you fight not and some of
[39:35] us that we you know fight up with
[39:36] ourselves God comes in your trial
[39:40] because you still caught up in you gotta
[39:45] to get you okay you to send you in a
[39:46] trial
[39:47] you have invited with your own self
[39:50] shipping is a every walk on the porch on
[39:52] it and it chipped on yourself before now
[39:54] nobody took that Lana you're walking so
[39:56] crazy that you're tripping your own self
[39:59] they're coming simple proof for me
[40:01] brother no graduate vividly Paulson dear
[40:13] for these amplified I do not wonder
[40:15] certainly without definite aim I do not
[40:17] box like one beat in the air and strike
[40:19] him with an with with with without an
[40:21] adversary but like a boxer I buff it my
[40:25] body handle it roughly discipline it by
[40:29] hatchet subdue it for fear that after
[40:32] proclaiming the others are gospel and
[40:34] things pertaining to it I myself should
[40:37] become unfit and I have not stand the
[40:40] test be unapproved and rejected as a
[40:43] conquer feet that is not that is not
[40:49] skin look
[40:53] second Timothy two one two five read the
[40:56] Bible in prayer every day a little grew
[40:59] Timothy now therefore my son be strong
[41:02] in the grace that is in Christ Jesus and
[41:05] the things that other was heard of me
[41:07] among many witnesses the same commit on
[41:09] the faithful men who shall be able to
[41:11] teach us others also doubt therefore and
[41:14] your happiness as a good soldier of
[41:16] Christ listen to us now no man that wore
[41:21] it entangling himself with the affairs
[41:24] of this life that he may purpose that he
[41:27] may please him who has chosen him to be
[41:29] a soldier and if a man also strive for
[41:35] masteries yet here we go he is not
[41:38] crowned except he strived lawfully
[41:45] are you still with me now so it's not
[41:48] just winning the race but it's how now
[41:53] let's take a look at the amplified of
[41:55] these rules take with me your share of
[41:58] hardship and sufferings which you are
[41:59] called to endure as a good first-class
[42:02] soldier of Christ Jesus like that
[42:04] first-class soldiers no soldier when in
[42:08] service get entangled in the enterprise
[42:11] of civilian life our soldiers in
[42:15] Saturday will understand that soldier
[42:17] has not a civilian soldier is a soldier
[42:19] isn't that right his aim is to satisfy
[42:23] and please the ones who enlisted him
[42:29] competitive games he is not lawfully
[42:32] crowned unless he competes lawfully
[42:34] fairly according to the rules lead down
[42:41] are you with me
[42:43] Baram says this Napoleon was defeated
[42:46] because he never played by the rules of
[42:47] the game and remember this that's a good
[42:50] lesson for the Church of the Living God
[42:51] if we don't play the game according to
[42:54] the rules we'll be disqualified at the
[42:56] end you have to keep the rules of the
[42:59] game to win and if the rules of the game
[43:02] in this place is a man to be born again
[43:04] to enter the fellowship of Christ in His
[43:07] Church we might be the greatest
[43:09] nomination on earth if we haven't played
[43:11] the rules we'll be disqualified
[43:13] we have got to come right straight with
[43:15] God oh praise the name of the Lord we
[43:20] got rules it isn't our rules
[43:23] it is his rules and we have got to abide
[43:25] by
[43:26] we are running the race according to his
[43:29] rules
[43:29] you see Napoleon aldo being a great
[43:32] warrior a great conqueror he conquered
[43:35] the people under fear and that's not the
[43:37] rule of the game the rule of the game is
[43:39] a conquer by love they see what happened
[43:45] all these churches where is Ruby dragon
[43:47] fear by the pontiff the bishop there is
[43:52] no other force in all the world as
[43:53] witness love and I'm almost sure as we
[43:56] as people have put too much emphasis
[43:58] upon rules don't mean to be rude and we
[44:01] have made ourselves and put too much
[44:03] stress upon those rules or the final
[44:04] self disqualified now here this bum what
[44:08] if Martin Luther would have played the
[44:09] rules of the game there would never been
[44:12] a Methodist Church what if the
[44:15] Methodists are pleased by the rules of
[44:17] the game they were never never been a
[44:19] pet what are you saying that the church
[44:21] would have been growing into maturity
[44:22] into that perfection into that son of
[44:25] God isn't that right
[44:27] but because the rules were not broken
[44:30] gonna have to get somebody else let's
[44:34] read on what is the messages I've played
[44:36] the rules of the game right they're
[44:37] never in a Pentecostal Church but if we
[44:39] feel the player the rules of the game
[44:42] right
[44:43] gourville disqualifiers and raised up
[44:45] out of these stones children to Abraham
[44:49] so when Luther fell what say you know
[44:52] what somebody else bring Wesley I'm
[44:55] gonna try with them to see how they're
[44:56] gonna run and then when they broke he
[44:58] gripped me Brizzy Pentecostal
[45:00] when they broke he had to bring william
[45:01] branham to bring back the word because
[45:04] when the dynamics when the dynamic
[45:06] struck the Pentecostals it did not
[45:09] prevent the perfection
[45:11] did you hear what I'm saying the spirit
[45:15] fell among the Pentecostals and it
[45:17] couldn't bring them to perfection
[45:18] because it didn't have the word
[45:21] hallelujah they had the gifts they still
[45:24] have them but it didn't go on to
[45:26] perfection and Paul said let us go on to
[45:30] perfection we have got to get there now
[45:33] we have to journey to it we have to get
[45:36] to it we have to see it we have to
[45:38] behold it because the bride is called to
[45:40] it
[45:41] [Applause]
[45:47] so God wants the game played right and
[45:53] we must do it so it doesn't make any
[45:56] difference how much we feel like we are
[45:58] progressing on until we get back to the
[46:01] rule of the game so I know like the
[46:07] rabbit and the whole one on and a whole
[46:09] together wit right that I hold it good
[46:10] rabbit have to come out it is one or the
[46:12] new song in Saturday just weed feel we
[46:16] are reaching the right by the wood
[46:20] because what about Oliver I said this is
[46:32] a brother if God has given you a talent
[46:35] stay with that talent no matter what you
[46:38] try to do if that talent isn't operated
[46:42] no matter how great it is if it isn't
[46:45] operating appointed rules you'll be
[46:46] disqualified so it's a little more than
[46:50] being talented and I want you to see
[46:53] amen to that
[46:54] it's a little more by being that than
[46:56] being gifted little more than that it's
[46:59] not much more than that and that is what
[47:02] you have to be interested in the process
[47:03] what goes with talent what goes with
[47:07] gift or she say this with what God
[47:09] expect to go with talents or what God
[47:13] expect to go with gifts
[47:15] so you said everyone knows in Olympics
[47:18] after the exercise no matter if you're
[47:20] right first in the race if you haven't
[47:22] played by the rule you're disqualified
[47:24] just last week the Olympic Committee I
[47:28] didn't even know they do that they keep
[47:31] blood samples of athletes from all the
[47:34] different years and stuff because of
[47:36] Technology they are accurate way of
[47:38] measuring and knowing if somebody had
[47:40] drugs in their system so they no pull
[47:44] out and disqualify people that took
[47:46] Platt in the Olympics 15 years ago they
[47:49] take back the gold from them that's a
[47:51] quality silver went winner and say you
[47:54] have the goal now
[47:56] and the interview one of em says all the
[47:59] missus been on the podium
[48:00] foot foot for the goal because you see
[48:03] at that time they got silver but no
[48:07] Andalite is shown on the condition back
[48:11] there and reveal the dis person was
[48:14] taken enhancement drugs to give them a
[48:18] more spiritual means only to realize
[48:22] that the inspector the drug inspector
[48:27] examining the process examining the way
[48:31] they run all these are common disqualify
[48:34] them and put the metal under somebody
[48:36] else or could we say Amen somebody this
[48:39] is this is strong this is deep this is
[48:43] real and it's coming near you or give
[48:48] the law some praises people
[48:51] [Applause]
[48:54] so now you will see when people motive
[48:57] an objective what is the real deep
[49:00] desire when that come to the fore
[49:01] they're high you're gonna see the
[49:03] sincere that's why Baram says it take a
[49:05] humble heart dedicated to God to bring
[49:07] Jesus Christ into the present tense
[49:09] God will not use arrogance go and not
[49:11] use pride the Bible talk about the dick
[49:13] come in which I be burned and all the
[49:15] proud and all of you we can say by just
[49:17] double all the proud and all that do
[49:19] wickedly said that table a dreadful they
[49:21] come in but behold I send you Elijah the
[49:23] Prophet before that great and terrible
[49:25] day of the Lord do you love them this
[49:27] morning it's not a mind-blowing thing
[49:29] that they could go back 15 years 10
[49:31] years
[49:31] check back the blood sample and see
[49:33] exactly what was in that blood and say
[49:35] you know what you don't deserve the goal
[49:37] because you took something and not
[49:38] supposed to take you didn't go to the
[49:40] right process you are disqualified I
[49:42] don't want to do that I want those
[49:44] trouble at the Riverside Oh glory to God
[49:47] hallelujah praise God so therefore you
[49:50] utterly aside the weight under sin
[49:53] that's what easily beset you and you
[49:55] want to run with patience the race that
[49:57] is set before you Oh glory to God you

[50:15] have been called to run with patience
[50:17] [Applause]
[50:19] Oh glory to God hallelujah my patients

[50:28] find the church here we are tonight in
[50:30] the shadows of the common of the Lord
[50:32] son of God we find a church in an anemic
[50:34] condition we ought to be a great strong
[50:37] mighty wires are the shield of the faith
[50:40] that would shake our nation God give it
[50:42] to us that's how the truth supposed to
[50:44] be strong mighty I'm so far shaken up

[51:22] then I might become him that's what he
[51:25] took my place that I could take his
[51:26] place why I think Jesus went to hell
[51:31] because our Casilla he took our sins
[51:33] upon himself so since end of the hell

[1:00:39] entire luck and nothing there we go
[1:00:42] God's will for us is perfection God's
[1:00:47] will for us is perfection and that
[1:00:51] perfection is patience
[1:00:53] it's written on God and wisdom for God
[1:00:57] this is the process of character
[1:01:01] development so we talk about perfection
[1:01:04] stature a perfect man faithful ministry
[1:01:07] coming to perfection but there's a
[1:01:09] process to get to that perfection but
[1:01:13] I'm saying this morning we are coming
[1:01:15] into that perfection Oh glory to God
[1:01:20] hallelujah hallelujah Oh glory to God
[1:01:25] anything that tough here's what coming
[1:01:29] listen to this prophecy but about this
[1:01:33] dream this is Cleveland Ohio your 28th
[1:01:38] of August 1950 our Heavenly Father I'm
[1:01:44] so happy today to be here at Cleveland
[1:01:46] this great city one of the major cities
[1:01:49] of our beloved nation and to be here to
[1:01:53] give testimony of thy Son Jesus who has
[1:01:55] died to redeem this lost race of people
[1:01:58] throughout the world and now as we are
[1:02:00] gathered here together this afternoon
[1:02:03] the pall of your spirit upon us I
[1:02:06] believe every man woman boy girl from
[1:02:09] every church every Creed II nomination
[1:02:10] race color forget all about the past now
[1:02:14] let's look to the future let's look to
[1:02:18] that continuing city that is to come
[1:02:21] Cleveland is home to many thousands yes
[1:02:24] millions over a million people here God
[1:02:26] we pray that men and women will never be
[1:02:29] satisfied until they meet peace with you
[1:02:31] so we can go to that continuing city
[1:02:35] looking upon the giant ice cream
[1:02:37] in the city looking upon the fine
[1:02:40] buildings and structures but there will
[1:02:43] be a time when there won't be one stone
[1:02:46] left upon another we believe that these
[1:02:52] cities in this great major conflict
[1:02:56] that's coming will be locked with atomic
[1:02:59] powers and millions will die in oil
[1:03:05] blown to bits even the earth shook from
[1:03:10] its orbit going into the Sun great heat
[1:03:12] shall squats men as the Scriptures see
[1:03:16] in the book of Revelation help us God
[1:03:21] to get our mind on you to settle down to
[1:03:25] go into this bloody trail I review it
[1:03:28] Lord to the best of my knowledge you
[1:03:30] help me as I start back from the
[1:03:32] beginning when you put your hand on your
[1:03:34] former servant may all mine miss six
[1:03:36] today may others and young boys and
[1:03:38] girls who coming on
[1:03:39] may they be stepping stones to bring
[1:03:41] them to thee made it profit from my
[1:03:43] errors of suffering that they may know
[1:03:46] you in the power of your resurrection
[1:03:49] before we ask it in the name of thy
[1:03:52] beloved child a message called the
[1:03:57] resurrection of Lazarus 29th of July
[1:04:00] 1951 by the Bronner notice before God
[1:04:04] does anything on the earth he always
[1:04:06] sends a message of warning getting
[1:04:07] things ready I kind of feel religious
[1:04:10] right now I believe there's a move going
[1:04:12] on God is warning as it wasn't lesson or
[1:04:16] getting the people ready something is
[1:04:19] about to happen
[1:04:20] the atomic powers and things are bought
[1:04:22] ready to boost in upon us millions will
[1:04:26] die in a split second but oh my god
[1:04:28] getting his church ready for the rapture
[1:04:31] the coming of the Son of God hallelujah
[1:04:35] this is what the prophet saw 1933 he got
[1:04:39] seven visions which he said must come to
[1:04:41] pass before Jesus comes again six vision
[1:04:45] so seven vision he saw America bombed up
[1:04:48] blew up
[1:04:49] or what how could that be 1950 they
[1:04:53] didn't have the technology the weaponry
[1:04:55] the efficiency of the bombs and missiles
[1:04:58] and so like they have known it had to
[1:05:00] wait for the process for things to be in
[1:05:03] position that that can be executed what
[1:05:07] about the brain
[1:05:08] Pratt is a super Church prophecy super
[1:05:11] Ray's prophecy hallelujah all this

[1:41:44] to preach Oh Harlan but let me just
[1:41:46] shares with you I'm afraid there's going
[1:41:50] to be a lot of disappointments at the
[1:41:52] judgement because you know Paul said
[1:41:54] over in Hebrews they wandered about in
[1:41:56] sheepskins and goatskins and destitute
[1:41:58] and afflicted look at the Elijah in his
[1:42:00] cave how that if we see him come out to
[1:42:03] a door today with beard on his face boy

[1:42:08] drip-along him
[1:42:08] we probably run more yard some of our
[1:42:10] intellectual brethren he specify the
[1:42:16] brethren that will do that but you see
[1:42:19] you don't know what's beating behind
[1:42:22] that little old skin there the Holy
[1:42:25] Spirit will be tabernacle there see you
[1:42:28] must never do that we must be brothers
[1:42:32] treat a man no matter if he is in wrong
[1:42:35] still treat him nice
[1:42:38] be nice to him if you haven't got that
[1:42:41] spirit there's something wrong
[1:42:44] Jesus was nice the doors who are ugly
[1:42:47] them to him you must be Christians full
[1:42:51] of love ready to help any race color
[1:42:54] creed anywhere anytime we must be that
[1:42:59] way
[1:42:59] that's Christians that's the way Christ
[1:43:02] would have us and to be a Christian is
[1:43:04] to be christ-like just about two more on
