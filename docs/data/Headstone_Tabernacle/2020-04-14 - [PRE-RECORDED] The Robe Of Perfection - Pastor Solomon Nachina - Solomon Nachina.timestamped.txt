[56:31] masterpiece started somewhere is got to
[56:34] finish somewhere hallelujah they started
[56:38] with Paul the first church the seed the
[56:41] word the word manifested the

[57:06] Christ coming back again hallelujah what
[57:10] is it it is Christ coming back again how
[57:16] is he coming back he made promises now
[57:20] notice it started out as the original

[57:26] see that and so was in a sewer sold and
[57:29] he was the sower the seed was the word
[57:32] and any see that is that abides alone
[57:35] does nothing is got to fall into the
[57:38] ground to bring forth to touching a king
[57:42] hallelujah so Paul went to the ground
[57:45] but it remained there it had to bring
[57:48] for another see veggie weariness came on
[57:51] the scene it couldn't stay there to
[57:53] bring for another see and the prophet
[57:55] said he went on down up to LA Asia
[57:57] brotherly kindness hallelujah but out of
[58:01] that God had to call him right now
[58:03] amen because all of them went into the

[58:36] so the headstone the capstone comes upon
[58:41] that bride not loud Asia because out of
[58:45] loud Asia comes the bride to get our
[58:49] wedding garment
[58:50] now that wedding garment is not for
