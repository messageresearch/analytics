[28:03] so if you can open with me to romans
[28:06] chapter 8
[28:07] verse 18 paul said for i reckon that the
[28:11] suffering
[28:12] of this present time are not worthy to
[28:14] be compared
[28:16] what to be compared with the glory which
[28:19] shall be revealed in us
[28:21] so there's going to be a glory revealed
[28:23] in us amen so all the
[28:24] sufferings all that you're going through
[28:26] the difficult things you're going
[28:27] through now
[28:28] amen there is a glory ahead
[28:32] and the the the blessing or the the
[28:35] the might of that glory is greater than
[28:38] the suffering you're going
[28:39] through soon and very soon we're gonna
[28:41] be like him
[28:43] we're gonna walk like him talk like him
[28:45] speak like him
[28:46] and that is the glory that paul was
[28:48] talking about
[28:49] no no no no condition no plague on this
[28:52] earth can be compared with that glory
[28:55] and we are certainly pressing on towards
[28:57] that mark
[28:58] to receive that glory amen verse 19
[29:01] there is therefore the endless
[29:02] expectation of the creature
[29:04] waited for the manifestation of the sons
[29:07] of god
[29:08] hallelujah and that's what all the
[29:10] creation is waiting for
[29:12] going back to eden just like a true son
[29:15] of god
[29:16] born in the image of god praise god god
[29:19] bless you amen
[29:20] hallelujah may the lord bless the
[29:21] written of his word amen
[29:24] wherever you are you may be seated so we
[29:27] thank god
[29:28] that we have an assurance paul said
[29:31] there's a glory that is going to be
[29:32] revealed in us
[29:34] that the evil has not seen before
[29:36] nothing in this world can be compared
[29:38] with that glory amen satan will bring
[29:41] all plagues will bring all challenges
[29:43] but it's a glory that is going to be
[29:45] revealed in us and i'm looking at the
[29:47] glory i'm not looking at my condition
[29:49] the plagues on this earth the situation
[29:51] i'm going through my trials my troubles
[29:54] my thirst
[29:55] it is fine but i know that's a blessed
[29:57] assurance
[29:58] there's a glory going to be revealed
[30:00] that is greater than all this
[30:02] and the anus of creation the animals the
[30:05] trees praise god they are all in
[30:07] expectation
[30:09] that a child of god will come to that
[30:11] glory will come to that manifestation
[30:13] and when we get to that manifestation oh
[30:16] praise be to god
[30:18] the bible said it puts us back into
[30:20] speaking conditions
[30:22] we're going to speak like adam's book in
[30:24] the garden when you speak god will back
[30:26] you up
[30:27] hallelujah and that condition can only
[30:30] come when the son of god is manifested
[30:32] when you are adopted amen that means god
[30:36] trusts you whatever you say is the mind
[30:38] of god
[30:39] you cannot say anything that god hasn't
[30:41] said jesus said
[30:42] except i see my father do it so i do
[30:46] and when the man comes to that
[30:48] manifestation of a son of god
[30:50] you don't you don't speak a mess you
[30:52] speak what the father has bid you to say
[30:55] praise god hallelujah was saying here
[30:59] in the adoption tape 1962 adoption part
[31:02] 4
[31:03] the prophet said tell me my brother tell
[31:05] me my sister
[31:07] when was the time that the son of god
[31:09] was ever to be
[31:10] manifested outside of this time now oh
[31:13] this is the time for the manifestation
[31:16] this is the hour this is the moment
[31:19] there can never be any other time than
[31:21] this time so tell me
[31:22] my brother tell me my sister when was
[31:25] the time that the sons of god
[31:27] was ever to be manifested outside of

[32:28] deliver
[32:30] praise god nature amen so the nature
[32:34] itself is groaning waiting for the time
[32:37] of the manifestation
[32:39] so why before the atonement was made
[32:42] before the holy ghost was ever poured
[32:44] out before
[32:45] all the old testament on down there
[32:48] there couldn't have been
[32:49] manifestations oh praise god they
[32:52] couldn't have happened in a time amen
[32:54] in the old testament there could not be
[32:56] in this manifestation
[32:57] ram said it had to wait till this time
[33:01] oh what a moment so bride of christ
[33:04] our time is the greatest moment oh it's
[33:07] the golden age

[33:15] conditions
[33:16] they are plagues praise god oh but god
[33:19] is making a way
[33:20] hmm oh the devil cannot stop us
[33:24] we have a hope that one day we would
[33:27] walk like him talk like him speak like
[33:30] him
[33:30] you'll have the signature of papa amen
[33:34] when you sign the bank cannot refuse you
[33:37] because you have the authority to sign
[33:41] oh hallelujah amen so the prophet said
[33:44] here
[33:45] before the holy ghost was ever poured
[33:47] out before the old testament down there
[33:49] there couldn't have been manifestation
[33:51] they had to wait till this time
[33:53] now all things have been brought coming
[33:56] shaping up to a headstone oh
[33:58] praise god you see it so we are shaping
[34:01] up
[34:02] into what the headstone to the
[34:05] manifestation of
[34:06] sons of god coming back hallelujah
[34:11] oh another son of god back on the earth
[34:14] again
[34:14] coming back and the spirit of god coming
[34:17] into these men
[34:19] oh praise be to god not a church spirit
[34:22] not some group spirit not some
[34:24] organizational spirit
[34:26] but we are going to move with that
[34:28] spirit of god
[34:30] if that same spirit that raised up
[34:33] jesus christ from the dead dwells in you
[34:36] oh my god it's gonna have a quickening
[34:40] in this mortal body and that's what we
[34:42] are receiving
[34:43] in this adoption season the dynamic the
[34:46] spirit of god
[34:48] coming into these men so perfectly
[34:52] until their ministry will be so
[34:55] close like christ oh you see it
[34:58] oh my so every individual i will have a
[35:00] ministry
[35:01] you'll be like christ so close like
[35:03] christ till
[35:04] it will join him and his church together
[35:08] oh there's a prophecy now oh my
[35:12] so just to encourage you amen those
[35:15] that have joined those meetings and this
[35:17] convention
[35:19] don't give up amen this plague is just
[35:22] for a season
[35:23] there's a glory going to be revealed in
[35:25] us and that's what i just read we're
[35:27] going to have the spirit of christ jesus
[35:29] in us come and confirm that this
[35:32] is my beloved son in whom i'm well
[35:35] pleased to dwell
[35:36] hear ye him oh glory be to god
[35:41] when you speak god will back you off
[35:44] when you speak he will back you up
[35:46] church
[35:46] oh glory be to god amen
[35:50] oh man let me read just just this last
[35:53] one here in the serpent seed
[35:54] the prophet said god hid it from the
[35:57] eyes of the wise and the prudent
[35:59] you see it this manifestation of the son
[36:02] of god
[36:03] it doesn't come by reading just the
[36:05] quotes
[36:06] no it's a god hear it from the wise and
[36:08] the prudent
[36:10] oh hallelujah it's a revelation a secret
[36:14] and promised to reveal it to the sons of
[36:16] god in the last days
[36:18] so this adoption perfection
[36:20] manifestation
[36:22] oh my god himself walking on two feet on
[36:25] the air
[36:26] he hid it from the wise and the prudent
[36:28] so when the sons of god were made
[36:30] manifest
[36:31] when god's sons start rejected with that
[36:34] rejoice with him before the foundation
[36:36] of the well
[36:37] when the great revelation of the godhead
[36:39] and the things will be brought
[36:40] down into the last days he would
[36:42] manifest these things
[36:44] to the sons of god not to anybody but
[36:46] towards
[36:47] the sons of god so you know that
[36:49] scripture teaches that
[36:50] and in the browser and here we are
[36:53] that's the reason that god is opening
[36:56] these things to us
[36:57] god is bringing his sons into
[36:59] manifestations
[37:00] oh church amen our time is right
[37:05] speak and go forward god is bringing his
[37:08] sons into what
[37:09] manifestations he's going beyond the
[37:12] limitation of
[37:13] human knowledge oh i love what the
[37:16] prophet said
[37:17] or adoption goes beyond the
[37:19] manifestation of human knowledge
[37:21] human cannot understand it it goes
[37:23] beyond the limitation of human knowledge
[37:25] when you try to figure it out you make a
[37:27] mistake why did god do this for this why
[37:29] did god choose this one
[37:31] oh my he did it according to the good
[37:33] pleasure of his will
[37:35] to bring this one to that manifestation
[37:37] or to adapt to you
[37:39] oh to make himself manifest in you he's
[37:42] going beyond
[37:43] the limitation of human knowledge way
[37:46] into the spiritual revelations
[37:48] and bringing it down oh praise god
[37:51] so don't be afraid when they question
[37:54] you
[37:54] say you don't know it's by grace don't
[37:58] be afraid to speak amen
[38:00] so god we shall bless you amen god bless

[45:21] are living in
[45:22] very unusual times but through it all
[45:26] god has been so good to us and we
[45:29] certainly do appreciate
[45:30] his blessings that has been with us that
[45:33] has been with our people
[45:35] been with our families and one thing
[45:39] when a man has the baptism of the holy
[45:43] ghost
[45:44] he doesn't walk by what he sees he
[45:47] doesn't walk
[45:48] by how he feels amen he is
[45:52] hooked into the word of god
[45:55] for the word will defeat satan anytime
[45:59] time
[45:59] any place under any condition
[46:03] so i'm delighted for uh the invitation
[46:07] given me by brother solomon
[46:11] nachina i believe that's how it's
[46:14] pronounced
[46:15] i trust that i did not uh mispronounce
[46:17] that
[46:18] but uh i want to send greetings to
[46:22] brother solomon
[46:23] and the church the great uh life
[46:26] tabernacle church and i believe it's

[46:38] people want to know how is new york

[46:41] by the grace of god we are alive and
[46:44] well and we are looking for
[46:47] the coming of the lord amen and that is
[46:50] the hope that
[46:51] that lies within us that we have
[46:54] a reason to look for forward to
[46:58] tomorrow the next week amen until the
[47:01] lord comes
[47:02] we will continue to work in the vineyard
[47:05] amen doing all that we can
[47:07] amen to put our shoulders to the wheel
[47:09] in such a
[47:10] convention like this be it virtual be it
[47:14] in person no matter what we are here to
[47:17] be a blessing to
[47:19] one another we certainly do uh
[47:22] miss seeing your happy faces
[47:25] your smiling faces and i'm still
[47:28] after several months on line
[47:32] trying to uh connect up of course with
[47:36] the zoom platform and various means
[47:40] uh through the websites and so forth
[47:43] it's still very difficult to preach to
[47:46] computer hardware it certainly is it
[47:49] doesn't
[47:51] it just doesn't respond
[47:54] i am kind of feeling it is better to
[47:57] preach the hard cases
[47:59] live in the church than it is to preach
[48:01] to computer hardware
[48:03] but nevertheless we are alive and well
[48:06] and i want to greet each and every one
[48:09] no matter uh wherever you are going to
[48:12] be listening from
[48:14] whether it's europe africa
[48:17] around the world south america north
[48:20] america amen our god is uh
[48:23] an awesome god and this gospel we know
[48:26] has
[48:26] reached the further point the furthest
[48:29] points of the earth
[48:31] and we know that is a sign that when the
[48:34] gospel reaches
[48:35] the ends of the earth then the end
[48:39] certainly will come i want to thank uh
[48:42] once again
[48:43] and great brother uh solomon for having
[48:47] me
[48:49] have this opportunity i am delighted i'm
[48:52] a little late
[48:53] in getting this video over to the team
[48:56] in trinidad i do apologize
[48:59] but i trust that i'm not too late so
[49:03] here goes my sermon and my remarks
[49:07] it's very difficult to show any kind of
[49:09] emotion
[49:10] behind a desk and we have been doing so
[49:13] for the last several months
[49:15] but god i believe is opening
[49:18] uh an avenue opening a door for us to
[49:21] return to our respective churches
[49:24] and to once again resume services and
[49:26] i'm just feeling in my heart
[49:28] that once we return it will not be long
[49:32] friends i believe is a time for our
[49:34] families
[49:34] i believe is a time for our loved ones
[49:38] uh because see god always sends his
[49:40] warning
[49:41] before judgment see and we realize that
[49:45] the world
[49:45] as it exists today cannot
[49:49] continue it is impossible uh the world
[49:52] sees it just in a panic stricken state
[49:56] it is certainly uh shows the signs that
[50:00] the
[50:00] end is near but while the end
[50:03] is nearing we could talk a long time
[50:06] about the things of the world and what's
[50:08] happening
[50:09] but we're not here to do that amen
[50:11] brother braham said we can talk about
[50:13] how bad the world is getting but let's
[50:16] focus
[50:17] in also let's uh also mention what how
[50:20] powerful the church is getting
[50:23] all along amen so we thank god for his
[50:26] grace and we know that
[50:27] everything that is taking place in the
[50:30] world today
[50:31] is for a reason it has strengthened our
[50:34] faith
[50:34] it has rededicated our uh lives to
[50:38] the word and we are more faithful now
[50:41] than we have
[50:42] been before knowing that if god
[50:45] can take us through this storm he
[50:47] certainly can take us through
[50:48] uh storms to come so i want to also
[50:53] excuse me take this opportunity to
[50:56] thank the technical team in trinidad
[51:00] uh i know it's not easy their
[51:04] their work in the background to make
[51:07] sure that the tapes in the
[51:09] videos are spliced together and also the
[51:12] translators
[51:14] who are working behind the scenes to
[51:16] translate the messages
[51:18] into various different languages so as
[51:21] many people
[51:23] can understand it could understand it so
[51:26] we appreciate all those uh they have put
[51:28] their
[51:29] uh shoulder to the wheel to make this uh
[51:32] happen so we salute the technical team
[51:37] in trinidad god richly bless you and all
[51:41] those that are behind the scenes i
[51:44] understand that
[51:45] as i said we could have a
[51:49] a face-to-face meeting it has its
[51:52] challenges
[51:53] but a virtual meeting also has
[51:57] its challenges it's time zones and
[51:59] things when is it
[52:00] when is it good for people to view it so
[52:04] nevertheless we are happy to share
[52:08] our testimony from new york city of what
[52:11] god is doing
[52:13] here and i trust that god has kept you
[52:16] safe and blessed in the lord
[52:19] wherever you are and may god
[52:24] continue to bless you and protect you
[52:27] amen as we move forward because we know
[52:31] as i said it is uh not too long
[52:35] uh now to the rapture so
[52:38] we thank the lord god bless every single
[52:41] one technician
[52:43] the translators and everyone who would
[52:46] be
[52:46] listening i like how brother branham
[52:50] back in 1965 uh he
[52:54] was uh that new technology had come in
[52:58] with the phone hookup and he was
[53:01] greeting
[53:02] the people uh in the east
[53:05] greetings from uh
[53:10] indiana to tucson to
[53:13] out in california and their group
[53:17] who are waiting for the coming of the
[53:21] lord
[53:22] new york connecticut and their
[53:25] pastors and their group who are waiting
[53:28] for
[53:29] the coming of the lord and i like that i
[53:32] could say the same thing
[53:33] wherever you are in europe amen in asia
[53:37] in south america wherever it may be
[53:40] africa
[53:41] those that are waiting and looking
[53:45] for the coming of the lord we greet you
[53:48] we salute you
[53:49] amen and we pray that god would say
[53:52] something during these services
[53:56] that would be a blessing to you to your
[53:59] churches
[54:00] and if you trust and pray that if you're
[54:03] defeated in your life or the struggles
[54:06] of these
[54:07] this world has gotten you down to a
[54:09] point where you are
[54:11] no longer one to come to church and you
[54:13] are a little discouraged you're full of
[54:14] fear
[54:15] i pray that god the holy spirit would
[54:19] speak something to our hearts and to
[54:22] encourage us to
[54:23] boost our faith knowing
[54:26] that god is in control praise the lord
[54:30] so we greet you as i said
[54:33] from new york city on behalf of
[54:37] the original faith gospel tabernacle we
[54:40] are so delighted to participate amen
[54:43] uh during this virtual meeting so god
[54:46] bless you
[54:47] i do not want to keep you too long i
[54:50] always say that i always say it to my
[54:52] church
[54:53] and sadly most of the times
[54:56] i am wrong in my target my stop time
[55:00] i trust that i could uh just be
[55:04] an hour or so and i know your time is
[55:07] valuable and uh i trust that
[55:10] something would be set here today that
[55:13] would
[55:13] be a blessing to you
[55:17] amen um just before
[55:21] i get started because i have a tendency
[55:23] of forgetting to
[55:24] give my little message a title
[55:28] i want to title it for these few
[55:31] uh moments tried unto perfection
[55:36] by the word tried unto
[55:40] perfection by the word
[55:44] may the lord had a blessing now as we
[55:47] read the scriptures
[55:48] these scriptures may god add a blessing
[55:51] to the scriptures
[55:52] reading to uh from psalms 105
[55:56] and we will also be reading from
[55:59] habakkuk
[56:01] psalms 105 i trust everyone as well
[56:05] whether you are listening in the comfort
[56:07] of your home
[56:09] or your job wherever it is amen
[56:12] uh feel free to worship the lord
[56:15] amen we're preaching to believers
[56:19] who are waiting for the coming of the
[56:22] lord
[56:23] psalms 105 and remember thy title tried
[56:27] unto perfection by the word
[56:30] as we get right to our subject
[56:33] and we don't want to drag the time on
[56:37] because we want to save time and make
[56:40] sure that we don't
[56:41] overdo it psalms 105
[56:44] and we'll start with verse 17 he sent
[56:48] the man
[56:49] before them even joseph who was sold
[56:53] for a servant whose feet
[56:56] they hurt with fetters
[56:59] he was laid in iron until
[57:04] the time that his word
[57:07] came the word of the lord
[57:11] tried him and that is where i got my
[57:14] inspiration for a title until
[57:19] the time that his word came
[57:22] the word of the lord tried him
[57:26] so we realize that by the grace of
[57:29] almighty god we
[57:31] have been called elected predestinated
[57:35] called out of laodicea from every walk
[57:38] of life
[57:38] from denominations from false churches
[57:42] from interpretations from the highways
[57:45] and byways
[57:46] and we're not called simply to just
[57:50] attend a church our calling has purpose
[57:53] our
[57:54] calling has uh
[57:57] there's a reason why god has called you
[58:00] and we trust and pray that
[58:01] by the time this service is through that
[58:04] we would understand
[58:05] that everything is pre-planned
[58:09] your destiny is pre-planned and your
[58:12] destination see
[58:14] predestination has already
[58:17] uh a destination pre-planned for you
[58:20] and i and the theme of these meetings is
[58:24] adoption
[58:25] uh perfection the placing of sons which
[58:30] we have spoken about so
[58:32] many times before but we know that this
[58:35] time
[58:36] is the dispensation of adoption
[58:40] no other age had that dispensation
[58:44] even only when brother branham come on
[58:46] the scene
[58:47] was it time for the manifestation of the
[58:51] sons of god
[58:52] that was a dispensation that was
[58:54] predestinated
[58:56] for our time so if we recognize
[58:59] our message and our day then we can
[59:02] benefit amen from the promises that god
[59:05] has in store
[59:06] for us so we will be speaking on joseph
[59:10] because i wanted to bring it from uh
[59:13] adoption
[59:14] but from the perspective of joseph and
[59:17] his life and how he was tried
[59:19] and he had to mature during his
[59:22] uh days of trying
[59:26] amen and nothing was out of
[59:29] order everything was predestinated
[59:32] exactly how god had
[59:36] written it before the foundation of the
[59:37] world we're just living
[59:39] out our part that has already been
[59:43] uh predestinated for us to live by so i
[59:47] trust that the comfort
[59:48] of knowing that amen that we cannot be
[59:52] lost
[59:53] if we have
[59:56] the seed of god in us and god has
[59:59] baptized
[1:00:00] us with the holy ghost amen what is in
[1:00:03] us the spirit of god is
[1:00:06] zoe that's the life of god and we
[1:00:10] can no more die than god himself
[1:00:13] can die amen we are eternal creatures we
[1:00:17] come from god
[1:00:18] and we go back to god again what an
[1:00:21] assurance for the believer
[1:00:23] but now until the time that his word
[1:00:25] came
[1:00:26] the word of the lord tried him turn with
[1:00:30] me to havoc
[1:00:31] i'm sure you are familiar with this
[1:00:34] scripture
[1:00:35] amen and because it speaks of a vision
[1:00:39] so if i would just back up a little bit
[1:00:44] joseph growing up he was a spiritual
[1:00:48] young man he saw visions he dreamed
[1:00:51] dreams not only
[1:00:52] did he see visions and dream dreams he
[1:00:55] could
[1:00:56] interpret visions and dreams and so
[1:00:58] forth
[1:00:59] so he was a spiritual uh man
[1:01:03] and brother branham said that joseph
[1:01:06] represents the spirit phil
[1:01:09] church and that is what i am speaking
[1:01:13] about
[1:01:14] tonight uh is
[1:01:17] joseph rep is is the spirit-filled
[1:01:20] church i'm not speaking about any
[1:01:22] particular uh
[1:01:24] i don't want people to think uh anything
[1:01:27] we're speaking about the church the
[1:01:29] spirit-filled church the church that has
[1:01:31] been been in bondage for many years
[1:01:33] amen but now coming to perfection she's
[1:01:36] been tried by the
[1:01:38] word amen in every trial is dissent
[1:01:41] for a reason we all have trials but yet
[1:01:44] our trials
[1:01:45] may differ from person to person because
[1:01:48] our trials are custom designed uh
[1:01:52] for us as individuals because the other
[1:01:55] person
[1:01:55] may not like be lacking in the character
[1:01:58] that you are lacking
[1:02:00] the other person may not have the
[1:02:02] character that you have
[1:02:03] etc so god has custom designed
[1:02:07] these trials amen to bring
[1:02:10] us to one place and that place is
[1:02:12] perfection
[1:02:14] by the word so now let us read
[1:02:17] habakkuk chapter 2 and verse 2
[1:02:20] and the lord answered me and said write
[1:02:23] the vision
[1:02:24] and make it plain upon tablet that he
[1:02:28] may run that readeth amen for the vision
[1:02:32] is yet for an appointed time
[1:02:35] so you see joseph's
[1:02:38] vision was for an appointed time
[1:02:43] he could have had those dreams every
[1:02:46] night
[1:02:46] but yet they would not have come to pass
[1:02:51] until the appointed time
[1:02:54] but he kept the vision and this
[1:02:57] is what is important for us to
[1:02:59] understand
[1:03:00] catch the vision and stick with the
[1:03:03] vision
[1:03:04] we shall come to perfection we
[1:03:07] shall be adopted we shall be
[1:03:10] filled with the holy ghost that is the
[1:03:12] bride's prophetic
[1:03:14] vision and it's gonna take some time the
[1:03:17] vision
[1:03:18] will not take place until an appointed
[1:03:21] time let us read verse three again
[1:03:23] for the vision is yet for an appointed
[1:03:26] time
[1:03:26] but at the end it shall speak
[1:03:30] and not lie though it tarry amen
[1:03:33] wait for it and thank god we are waiting
[1:03:36] for
[1:03:36] every divine promise that has been left
[1:03:40] uh us by this precious prophet of
[1:03:43] malachi
[1:03:44] 4 this is the pure word
[1:03:47] that has been restored unto us we now
[1:03:50] have the perfect interpretation
[1:03:53] of the word with divine vindication
[1:03:57] so uh though it tarry wait for it
[1:04:00] because it will surely come
[1:04:03] and it will not tarry i like that
[1:04:08] one part says um though it tarry
[1:04:12] wait for it and the other part says
[1:04:14] because it will surely come
[1:04:17] and it will not tarry amen may the lord
[1:04:20] add a blessing to
[1:04:21] the reading of his word let us bow our
[1:04:23] heads in a word of prayer
[1:04:25] and if you any of us have any of you out
[1:04:28] there have a request
[1:04:29] in your heart whether you are sick in
[1:04:32] body whether you need a spiritual
[1:04:34] deliverance
[1:04:35] whatever it is that you have need of god
[1:04:38] is
[1:04:38] able here in the local church during the
[1:04:41] last several months we've had some
[1:04:43] special requests people
[1:04:45] uh uh kneeling in death uh
[1:04:48] door uh somebody who was in a coma for
[1:04:51] several uh after having an accident
[1:04:55] and a young man was in a coma the doctor
[1:04:57] didn't know
[1:04:58] what he would make it and the church
[1:05:01] prayed and
[1:05:02] miraculously by the grace of god
[1:05:05] day after day after day he became better
[1:05:08] and better
[1:05:09] amen and we have seen so many different
[1:05:11] requests during this time see
[1:05:13] we should be praying more we're home i'm
[1:05:16] not home i'm working
[1:05:18] but uh every day those of you who are
[1:05:21] home
[1:05:21] don't waste your time but take advantage
[1:05:24] of it
[1:05:25] get closer to god amen read your bibles
[1:05:28] and read the spoken word books because
[1:05:30] see uh we're going to need these
[1:05:33] uh the word being in us this weapon and
[1:05:36] the word what did god give
[1:05:38] us is the greatest weapon he gave
[1:05:41] us himself and he is the word and the
[1:05:44] word will defeat satan
[1:05:46] anytime anyplace under any condition
[1:05:50] and we if god is with us then who
[1:05:54] can be against us so let's bow our heads
[1:05:56] if you have a request
[1:05:58] if you have unspoken requests
[1:06:01] you need deliverance you need a job and
[1:06:03] we're realizing during this
[1:06:04] economic time and uncertainty many many
[1:06:07] many
[1:06:08] thousands have lost their jobs worldwide
[1:06:11] and they
[1:06:11] are crying out to the lord
[1:06:15] for a great change in
[1:06:18] that god will give them the mercy and
[1:06:20] grace to be able to provide for
[1:06:23] their families and this is not just a
[1:06:25] local
[1:06:26] situation that has taken place here in
[1:06:28] the united states it's all over
[1:06:30] so many people are challenged
[1:06:32] financially
[1:06:34] challenged uh daily through with their
[1:06:36] health and everything else
[1:06:38] but we want to ask uh god to
[1:06:41] give us favor amen and if we
[1:06:44] ask earnestly god is able to
[1:06:48] answer prayer let us bow our heads in
[1:06:50] the word of prayer our father
[1:06:53] we come before you this evening
[1:06:56] lord and we ask you father for your
[1:07:00] grace and your mercy
[1:07:02] you promise oh god that you uh
[1:07:05] if we would cry to you and and ask
[1:07:09] earnestly oh for the prayer
[1:07:12] of the righteous man the earnest
[1:07:16] prayer of the righteous man availeth
[1:07:18] much
[1:07:19] and if your people are praying in the
[1:07:22] north in the south and
[1:07:23] east in the west dear god surely we will
[1:07:26] hear
[1:07:27] from heaven so i pray dear god that
[1:07:30] whatever their request
[1:07:31] may be whether it be healing whether it
[1:07:34] be deliverance whether it be
[1:07:36] for a loved one whether it be for a job
[1:07:40] someone's looking for a job i pray dear
[1:07:42] god that you would grant it lord
[1:07:44] anoint our faith that we may believe be
[1:07:47] able to believe and grab
[1:07:49] a hold of the promised word not just
[1:07:53] intellectually lord but with faith that
[1:07:56] would grab the word and apply it to our
[1:07:58] lives
[1:07:59] and know that it belongs to us so i pray
[1:08:02] dear god that you would bless
[1:08:04] these few words that will be spoken to
[1:08:06] your people
[1:08:07] and i pray that lord that when it's all
[1:08:10] over
[1:08:11] may our hearts be warmed by the holy
[1:08:14] spirit
[1:08:14] and lord surely testify like those that
[1:08:18] were walking
[1:08:19] lord with you on the way to emmaus did
[1:08:22] not
[1:08:22] our hearts burn within us as he
[1:08:26] appeared to them on the road oh as he
[1:08:29] the word
[1:08:30] uh fellowship with them oh god we ask
[1:08:34] you that it will fellowship with us this
[1:08:36] afternoon we ask in the name of jesus
[1:08:39] christ amen amen
[1:08:41] god bless you amen tried unto
[1:08:44] perfection by the word amen
[1:08:48] so this subject i could take some time
[1:08:52] on this subject because it's a subject
[1:08:56] that never really gets
[1:08:58] out of season it never gets old because
[1:09:01] we are tried and we are tested every day
[1:09:05] the problem is is how we interpret
[1:09:07] sometimes
[1:09:08] the trials that come our way many times
[1:09:11] people think that well everything is
[1:09:13] going wrong
[1:09:14] and god is angry with me everything is
[1:09:17] going wrong because
[1:09:20] this has never happened to me but we
[1:09:23] realize that our
[1:09:24] trials are more precious
[1:09:27] than gold amen everything that we go
[1:09:31] through
[1:09:32] has a specific purpose
[1:09:35] to bring out a specific purpose in our
[1:09:38] lives
[1:09:39] so we are thankful that the word
[1:09:43] is trying us even in this year 2020 2020
[1:09:48] has been a real
[1:09:49] trying year for many
[1:09:52] around the world amen but by the grace
[1:09:55] of god here we are
[1:09:57] we're still praising the lord we're
[1:09:59] still thanking god
[1:10:01] amen so getting back to the fame of the
[1:10:04] meeting adoption
[1:10:05] and the manifestation of the sons of god
[1:10:08] being positionally placed
[1:10:09] amen where god wants us to be
[1:10:13] for years we have wandered and wonder
[1:10:15] where we should
[1:10:17] uh what we should be
[1:10:21] we cannot be self-appointed god
[1:10:24] has positionally placed some apostles
[1:10:28] some teachers some evangelists
[1:10:30] amen for the perfecting other saints
[1:10:34] for the work of the ministry for the
[1:10:35] edifying of the body of christ
[1:10:37] that is not your choice that's god's
[1:10:40] choice
[1:10:41] and god elects each and every person to
[1:10:44] a specific
[1:10:45] office according to his grace and his
[1:10:48] mercy to you
[1:10:49] now of course not everybody is in fifo
[1:10:52] ministry you have the laities you have
[1:10:54] the helps and governments and so forth
[1:10:56] and but everybody in my
[1:11:00] uh humble opinion and my travels that
[1:11:03] have traveled over the years
[1:11:04] it seems like everybody wants to be
[1:11:07] apostle this apostle that and they want
[1:11:09] you
[1:11:10] to really recognize their title that
[1:11:13] uh they themselves gave themselves
[1:11:16] apostle this
[1:11:17] apostle that i cannot tell you the
[1:11:20] amount of letters i
[1:11:21] i receive amen with and then signed off
[1:11:24] by apostle this an apostle that nobody
[1:11:27] wants to be a pastor
[1:11:28] nobody wants to be an evangelist nobody
[1:11:31] wants to be a teacher as it were
[1:11:33] or or pastor nobody wants to be they
[1:11:36] want to be an apostle
[1:11:37] sin but see god is a person
[1:11:41] god is the supernatural being that
[1:11:44] places those gifts
[1:11:45] in the church and when he places those
[1:11:48] gifts
[1:11:49] in the church he also vindicates it the
[1:11:53] same see we cannot make it up
[1:11:55] it's got to be god amen doing it
[1:11:58] so oh how our god is desiring to finally
[1:12:02] see
[1:12:02] the church find her rightful position
[1:12:06] where he could use her in the way that
[1:12:08] he used his own son
[1:12:10] jesus christ and we realized
[1:12:13] that uh as i have frequently told
[1:12:17] our church that jesus had a will
[1:12:22] you see and we are to
[1:12:26] follow the will of god so when we
[1:12:30] uh are praying
[1:12:33] jesus prayed in the garden when he was
[1:12:36] about to be crucified
[1:12:37] the burden was heavy and he said lord
[1:12:41] if it's possible let this cup
[1:12:44] pass from me that was jesus
[1:12:48] the human part the human element
[1:12:51] of god that was in jesus he was praying
[1:12:55] because he knew the pain
[1:12:57] that was awaiting him he knew the
[1:13:00] sacrifice that he had to make
[1:13:02] but he said nevertheless not my will
[1:13:05] but thine be done amen so when we submit
[1:13:10] our will to his will
[1:13:13] amen then god can truly use us because
[1:13:16] we're not seeking our own
[1:13:18] uh objective our own motives or things
[1:13:21] like that we are
[1:13:22] following in the will of god and we how
[1:13:26] god
[1:13:26] desires to have the church in perfect
[1:13:30] harmony in position not one trying to
[1:13:33] take the other one's place
[1:13:35] amen pushing them out of the way they
[1:13:37] just can't wait for that one to
[1:13:38] make a mistake for them to knock them
[1:13:41] off their position so they can take over
[1:13:43] people
[1:13:45] criticizing one another running one
[1:13:47] another down
[1:13:48] and yet we claim that we are
[1:13:52] ready for the rapture i say not
[1:13:55] friends because any material
[1:13:58] any message that does not
[1:14:01] encourage you to bear the fruits of the
[1:14:04] spirit
[1:14:05] amen it's the incorrect message
[1:14:08] no one this message never taught us
[1:14:11] how to hate this message never taught
[1:14:14] us how to backbite and hate our brothers
[1:14:18] and sisters no
[1:14:19] we learned that from somewhere else not
[1:14:21] this message amen this message is a
[1:14:24] message
[1:14:24] of love and grace amen and brother
[1:14:27] branham said nothing but perfect love
[1:14:30] will make it to the other side so
[1:14:32] therefore
[1:14:33] if we ever hope and pray
[1:14:37] to get to the other side one thing we
[1:14:39] have to have
[1:14:40] is charity charity amen
[1:14:44] uh is the love of god amen charity
[1:14:48] is perfect so that's what we're striving
[1:14:52] for
[1:14:52] by the grace of god so we're on the eve
[1:14:55] i believe
[1:14:56] in this dispensation of the
[1:14:58] manifestation of the sons of god
[1:15:00] amen and god is going to display a
[1:15:02] church
[1:15:03] display his god called men
[1:15:07] his glorious church that has been
[1:15:10] uh cast aside for years and years and
[1:15:14] years
[1:15:14] and yet she is growing unto perfection
[1:15:18] see nothing i'm gonna tell you something
[1:15:21] right now
[1:15:22] nothing will be able to stop that which
[1:15:24] has already been spoken
[1:15:26] there shall be a bride there shall be
[1:15:29] the manifestation of the sons of god
[1:15:31] amen you wait to them thunders utter
[1:15:34] their voices to that group that can take
[1:15:36] the word and hand it there
[1:15:37] amen it'll slice and cut and so forth of
[1:15:40] course we have preached that
[1:15:42] amen these are seeds to preach but one
[1:15:45] day
[1:15:45] amen at the appointed time all of this
[1:15:48] will be
[1:15:49] manifested it won't take long it won't
[1:15:51] be long it won't last long
[1:15:53] but it will be here because he said it
[1:15:56] would be
[1:15:57] amen so therefore this word is already
[1:16:01] vindicated in my
[1:16:02] uh humble opinion that's just the way i
[1:16:05] believe
[1:16:06] it a simple keep it simple i believe it
[1:16:08] that way but when we inject
[1:16:10] our interpretations when we inject our
[1:16:13] own ideas about it and expect
[1:16:15] everyone else to follow your idea
[1:16:19] then that is when we are getting off the
[1:16:22] word so
[1:16:23] we realize that it's going to take a
[1:16:25] special kind
[1:16:27] of people a special kind of
[1:16:30] of a breed see it's going to take a
[1:16:32] special kind of people who can
[1:16:34] walk alone with god and not be
[1:16:37] influenced
[1:16:38] uh by the outside world
[1:16:41] or the pressures of the church we
[1:16:44] realize here
[1:16:45] not only is there pressures on the
[1:16:47] outside world
[1:16:48] but pressures in the church there are
[1:16:51] too many people
[1:16:52] sadly even pastors who who are
[1:16:55] respecters of
[1:16:56] other men in the church they're fearful
[1:16:58] to speak
[1:16:59] truth because they're afraid maybe their
[1:17:02] deacon board may not
[1:17:03] agree with what it is that they are
[1:17:05] preaching and they
[1:17:06] will water the thing down and they don't
[1:17:09] have the faith to step
[1:17:11] out and say what god told them to say
[1:17:14] amen has thus saith the lord but god
[1:17:17] those days are over
[1:17:18] because the manifestations of the sons
[1:17:21] of god
[1:17:21] this is the time and these individuals
[1:17:25] will walk alone with god and if
[1:17:29] we ever expect to uh get anywhere church
[1:17:33] it is an individual affair
[1:17:36] and yet it's not that we are isolating
[1:17:40] ourselves from
[1:17:41] anyone else the word comes by
[1:17:44] revelation and if it comes it came to
[1:17:47] peter it came to paul it came to all the
[1:17:51] apostles by revelation
[1:17:53] and i'm very uh happy when i read the
[1:17:56] bible when paul
[1:17:58] said i never went to jerusalem and
[1:18:01] was never taught this by man he went to
[1:18:04] arabia
[1:18:05] so who taught paul amen the gospel
[1:18:08] of jesus christ it was the holy spirit
[1:18:12] amen that taught paul the gospel
[1:18:16] and when he finally saw the other
[1:18:18] brethren
[1:18:19] amen not having seen each other in the
[1:18:22] flesh
[1:18:23] they agreed with one another and they
[1:18:26] had
[1:18:26] fellowship under the word of god
[1:18:30] and you see this is what is going to
[1:18:33] bring
[1:18:34] the true unity of the faith not an
[1:18:36] intellectual understanding
[1:18:38] but a genuine revelation of
[1:18:42] the word amen every word amen and that
[1:18:45] is what brings and keeps the unity of
[1:18:48] the faith
[1:18:48] and every man in their position humble
[1:18:52] walking humbly before god not
[1:18:55] boastful not blessed god charlie one man
[1:18:58] show
[1:18:58] no no no no see but they will stand on
[1:19:02] their convictions and they
[1:19:03] walk alone so now brother branham said
[1:19:07] in a message here jesus christ is the
[1:19:09] same yesterday today and forever he said
[1:19:11] uh in this time jesus had done
[1:19:14] great things in these early days
[1:19:17] in his early ministry he was
[1:19:21] misunderstood as most everyone
[1:19:24] did you ever come to think of it
[1:19:28] that most men who ever
[1:19:31] do anything great for the kingdom
[1:19:34] of god stands alone
[1:19:39] any person that amounts to anything
[1:19:43] and does anything great for the kingdom
[1:19:45] of god
[1:19:46] stands alone did you ever think of it
[1:19:49] see
[1:19:50] you have to stand by yourself
[1:19:53] jesus stood alone and all down through
[1:19:57] the ages other men who stood alone
[1:20:01] finney calvin
[1:20:04] knox and to abraham lincoln that's right
[1:20:08] stood alone men who
[1:20:11] who do great things men of
[1:20:14] vision amen men of vision
[1:20:18] will stand alone men who walk by
[1:20:22] revelation will stand alone
[1:20:25] it doesn't matter what the deacon board
[1:20:27] says it doesn't matter what mama says or
[1:20:30] or what the so-called uh
[1:20:33] bishop says no we stand alone
[1:20:36] amen with god and these are men
[1:20:39] of vision see men of spiritual
[1:20:42] understanding stand alone and i think
[1:20:46] that uh that's because that jesus had
[1:20:49] to stand alone himself so we realize
[1:20:53] that it's not so much a group revelation
[1:20:57] amen when god reveals to you it's hard
[1:21:00] for you to re
[1:21:01] explain revelation to any other
[1:21:04] person because revelation is
[1:21:07] for you personally amen it goes beyond
[1:21:10] the intellectual mind
[1:21:12] and into your heart amen is something
[1:21:14] that you
[1:21:15] know that you know that you know is
[1:21:18] going to happen and when it comes to you
[1:21:20] by revelation that it becomes a fixed
[1:21:24] idea your heart is fixed is anchored
[1:21:27] amen so now we know then as we
[1:21:31] uh approach this subject through
[1:21:34] uh the story of joseph will understand
[1:21:37] how joseph had to stand alone he had
[1:21:40] nobody's
[1:21:41] uh help amen he had a vision
[1:21:44] he was given dreams early on
[1:21:48] amen and he would share those dreams
[1:21:52] with his brethren and even his father
[1:21:55] and his family and he
[1:21:57] suffered for it because they thought
[1:21:59] that he
[1:22:00] was out of his mind and he was uh trying
[1:22:03] to say
[1:22:04] that they're all going to bow to him and
[1:22:07] who
[1:22:07] after all who are you see but joseph
[1:22:11] was not puffed up he was just merely
[1:22:14] sharing his vision that god
[1:22:18] showed him all those dreams and we
[1:22:20] realized that two dreams brother brown
[1:22:22] said
[1:22:22] is in fact a vision so he
[1:22:25] shared that testimony and the bride of
[1:22:27] jesus christ have shared that testimony
[1:22:30] we receive revelation we receive these
[1:22:33] promises
[1:22:34] amen seven thunders give faith seven
[1:22:36] thunders is a bride's revival amen
[1:22:38] adoption time
[1:22:39] this is the dispensation of adoption no
[1:22:42] other age
[1:22:43] it wasn't in luther's days it wasn't in
[1:22:45] wesley's age it wasn't in any other age
[1:22:48] but this age because nature is groaning
[1:22:52] for the manifestation of the sons of god
[1:22:55] we see
[1:22:56] all the the actual volcanoes and the
[1:22:59] the the hurricanes and the typhoons
[1:23:02] and the fires that are taking place
[1:23:04] around the world
[1:23:06] nature is upset something has taken
[1:23:09] place
[1:23:10] we all know what it all means it's the
[1:23:12] it's time for the manifestation
[1:23:14] of the sons of god because nature is
[1:23:16] groaning nature
[1:23:18] is testifying amen that this
[1:23:21] is the time for born sons phil
[1:23:24] sons amen place sons to finally
[1:23:27] stand up and take their position amen
[1:23:31] uh and and be the man
[1:23:34] of god that god wants us to be
[1:23:38] men who go under inspiration these are
[1:23:41] men of vision
[1:23:41] men of vision and spiritual
[1:23:43] understanding they all
[1:23:45] have had to stand alone because jesus
[1:23:48] did the same
[1:23:49] jesus did the same so now uh this is why
[1:23:53] we need
[1:23:53] more god called men
[1:23:56] more god called men and it is
[1:24:00] sad to see in this message today
[1:24:04] recently i spoke of uh
[1:24:08] to my church how there's a great such a
[1:24:10] great division
[1:24:13] among believers and it's so
[1:24:16] sad to hear and see especially when it
[1:24:19] comes to
[1:24:20] politics there are people that gotten
[1:24:23] so involved in politics that
[1:24:27] they are upset with each other they
[1:24:30] don't hardly
[1:24:31] speak to each other over which president
[1:24:34] was elected which president won who lost
[1:24:38] what do i care amen the bride should not
[1:24:43] care one bit if this world was
[1:24:46] of our world jesus said
[1:24:50] this world is not of my this kingdom
[1:24:53] this world is not of my uh world
[1:24:57] if it was so therefore my subjects my
[1:25:00] servants would fight for it we're not
[1:25:02] fighting for this world
[1:25:04] amen we receive a kingdom which cannot
[1:25:07] be
[1:25:08] moved so it doesn't matter who wins who
[1:25:10] loses whatever
[1:25:11] i have decided long ago to vote for
[1:25:14] jesus christ amen because he has never
[1:25:18] let me down
[1:25:19] everything that he promised you take a
[1:25:21] politician you take
[1:25:23] anyone elect official they'll promise
[1:25:25] you this they'll promise your
[1:25:27] that your your your your your your
[1:25:29] neighborhoods are going to be re uh
[1:25:31] rebuilt and this like that and whatever
[1:25:33] your benefits
[1:25:34] will be greater on your job and so forth
[1:25:37] they promise and promise and promise and
[1:25:39] tell me who has
[1:25:41] ever come forth for you but when
[1:25:44] jesus makes a promise this is why i
[1:25:46] voted for jesus long ago when he makes a
[1:25:49] promise
[1:25:50] even his promises are true they he
[1:25:53] cannot lie
[1:25:54] everything he said shall come to pass if
[1:25:57] it has not
[1:25:58] already this is why i don't get involved
[1:26:00] with politics it doesn't matter
[1:26:02] and so it's so disturbing to me how so
[1:26:06] many people
[1:26:07] i'm not sure why i'm saying these things
[1:26:09] i hope i'm not
[1:26:10] uh taking too much time i don't
[1:26:13] understand how many
[1:26:14] uh message people got so hooked up into
[1:26:17] this political
[1:26:18] uh thing thinking that a single man
[1:26:22] is going to make this world better or or
[1:26:24] or
[1:26:25] or or or be used to do x y and z
[1:26:28] i'm going to tell you something god will
[1:26:31] complete
[1:26:32] his work with one individual
[1:26:36] or the other individual or whatever it
[1:26:37] is amen
[1:26:39] he doesn't need our help amen because
[1:26:42] god's law and his plan of redemption
[1:26:46] is already fixed so no one
[1:26:49] man they thought because the president
[1:26:52] was uh somebody who mentioned prayer
[1:26:55] and mentioned this and the that the
[1:26:57] other that he was a christian and all
[1:27:00] the evangelicals there have gone
[1:27:02] here have gone crazy they have they have
[1:27:05] uh
[1:27:06] gone into a meltdown mode and me so many
[1:27:09] people
[1:27:10] also have made fun of the way they have
[1:27:13] behaved
[1:27:14] evangelicals see i the reason being
[1:27:18] is the religious world the reason they
[1:27:20] are in that condition is because they
[1:27:22] rejected the true
[1:27:24] message of the hour amen there cannot be
[1:27:28] no uh president that is going to
[1:27:31] establish
[1:27:32] any kind of kingdom in this world
[1:27:35] brother branham said if he had abraham
[1:27:38] lincoln or or
[1:27:39] in every state if he had a godly man in
[1:27:42] every state filled with the holy ghost
[1:27:44] it still would not be able to come back
[1:27:46] why
[1:27:47] because here we have no continuing city
[1:27:49] but we seek
[1:27:50] one to come i tell you get ready get
[1:27:52] ready get get get ready get ready get
[1:27:54] ready it's time to go home
[1:27:56] amen we are not of this world so
[1:27:58] therefore amen if you
[1:28:01] stop talking to your mama or your papa
[1:28:04] and got into political
[1:28:06] things that you should not have gotten
[1:28:07] into amen pray that the devil comes off
[1:28:10] of you because
[1:28:11] i tell you what that is the devil we
[1:28:13] have enough uh
[1:28:14] problems in this message to be divided
[1:28:16] over politics
[1:28:17] amen so this is why see
[1:28:21] god we need god called men to stay with
[1:28:24] the word of god
[1:28:26] now uh today i want to speak on such a
[1:28:28] man
[1:28:29] that strive to reach it his uh
[1:28:32] destiny and until
[1:28:36] that time until that time
[1:28:39] the word of the lord tried
[1:28:42] him amen brother branham says in the
[1:28:46] revelation of jesus christ
[1:28:48] now joseph when he was born
[1:28:52] he was hated by his brethren is that
[1:28:55] right
[1:28:56] now i want to show you joseph
[1:28:59] represents the spirit-filled
[1:29:02] church let me repeat that
[1:29:06] joseph represents the spirit-filled
[1:29:09] church
[1:29:10] joseph was hated of his brethren
[1:29:14] because he was spiritual joseph
[1:29:17] could not help because he could see
[1:29:21] visions amen that's a gift we were born
[1:29:25] with all the things that god uh
[1:29:30] all the gifts that god you're not you
[1:29:33] can't
[1:29:33] obtain a gift you're born with a gift
[1:29:36] amen so therefore
[1:29:38] see uh joseph could not help
[1:29:42] because he could see visions he could
[1:29:45] not help because
[1:29:46] he dreamed dreams he he could interpret
[1:29:49] dreams
[1:29:51] he that was in him see
[1:29:54] he could not display anything else
[1:29:57] but that but what that was in him
[1:30:01] see so joseph was just displaying
[1:30:04] what was in him he could not be anyone
[1:30:07] else amen and we realized in type this
[1:30:10] is why the father gave him a seven
[1:30:13] color coat he meant a rainbow coat
[1:30:16] because it was a type of that
[1:30:18] nature that was in joseph amen
[1:30:22] and remember joseph represents the
[1:30:24] spirit-filled church
[1:30:25] even he that was he that was
[1:30:29] what was in him see uh he could not
[1:30:32] display anything else
[1:30:34] but what that was in him well then his
[1:30:37] brothers hated him
[1:30:39] without a cause but his father loved him
[1:30:42] because his father
[1:30:43] was a prophet amen so uh
[1:30:47] let's go through this just a second
[1:30:49] joseph
[1:30:50] amen struggle to find his
[1:30:54] purpose in life and many of us wondering
[1:30:57] what is our purpose what is our position
[1:30:59] in christ jesus
[1:31:01] where do we fit in the body we all
[1:31:04] struggle with that and trying to figure
[1:31:06] out
[1:31:07] lord where do you want me uh
[1:31:10] to be the best i can be within the body
[1:31:12] well therefore
[1:31:14] i will say that is not our choice uh and
[1:31:17] that is uh we just need to
[1:31:18] yield amen ourselves to the holy spirit
[1:31:22] and pray
[1:31:22] and he will uh put us in a place that
[1:31:26] he feels we are most uh
[1:31:30] qualified see but until
[1:31:33] god created a need a crisis
[1:31:36] an emergency that desperately required
[1:31:40] uh your god his god-given gifts no one
[1:31:44] else
[1:31:45] uh can handle the crisis of the
[1:31:47] emergency in other words
[1:31:49] here's what i'm saying joseph had a gift
[1:31:53] but that gift could only be used at a
[1:31:56] certain time and
[1:31:58] we realize that uh there is a need
[1:32:01] and where there ever there's a need
[1:32:03] there's got to be an answer
[1:32:04] to that need to fulfill that need so
[1:32:07] therefore
[1:32:08] when joseph was struggling and trying to
[1:32:10] figure out well i just had these dreams
[1:32:12] i shared with my brothers and so forth
[1:32:15] amen so when he uh
[1:32:18] those visions that he had those dreams
[1:32:20] that he could not help him at that time
[1:32:22] you see because he was being
[1:32:26] uh it was being revealed to him and i
[1:32:29] don't think it was revealed to him
[1:32:31] in fullness amen that he was born
[1:32:35] a leader amen and he was just
[1:32:39] innocently sharing it with his brethren
[1:32:41] and his family and whoever
[1:32:43] would hear it amen he was
[1:32:46] born a leader amen and the church
[1:32:50] of the living god the spirit the the
[1:32:52] spirit spirit-filled
[1:32:54] church we're not slave we were born to
[1:32:57] be
[1:32:58] kings and priests we are born to be
[1:33:00] leaders
[1:33:01] hey amen we're not born to serve the
[1:33:04] world
[1:33:05] amen we're not born to serve the devil
[1:33:08] we're not sir born to serve his the evil
[1:33:11] works amen we are born to
[1:33:14] rule we are born to rule over this earth
[1:33:18] we are born to to have authority over
[1:33:22] evil spirits that is what we are born
[1:33:25] for amen anything shorter than that amen
[1:33:28] we are
[1:33:29] living under our privileges so we
[1:33:32] realize now
[1:33:33] let us continue amen i'm watching the
[1:33:36] clock i don't want to keep you long
[1:33:37] amen i trust that you love me after this
[1:33:40] amen god predestinate things see
[1:33:43] uh to uh predestinate things
[1:33:47] amen and things happen
[1:33:51] only to meet the challenge so now let me
[1:33:54] make this clear proving his word
[1:33:55] he says now i want you to notice
[1:33:59] he does it uh that way in every age
[1:34:02] he does it every time by the same method
[1:34:05] so you see
[1:34:06] god if you want to see what really god
[1:34:09] is going to do read in your bible and
[1:34:12] see how he's done it
[1:34:13] in the past and we we will see how he
[1:34:16] does it in the future because
[1:34:18] this is the same thing that he the same
[1:34:20] method brother brown said
[1:34:22] that he uses he has to take
[1:34:25] believers and then in order to have
[1:34:28] believers to meet that word he's got
[1:34:32] to predestinate it uh
[1:34:35] predestinated to that age so every
[1:34:38] believer is predestinated to a specific
[1:34:42] age amen so they're predestinated to
[1:34:46] meet
[1:34:46] the challenges of the age in which they
[1:34:50] are placed amen do you see that see
[1:34:54] he's got to predestinate this thing
[1:34:57] uh to be there to meet the challenge
[1:35:00] of the age so therefore
[1:35:04] every age has a challenge every age
[1:35:08] has a trial every age has a testing
[1:35:12] uh uh an element of being tested
[1:35:15] so he knows that there is going to be a
[1:35:19] challenge in a certain age
[1:35:21] so he predestinates believers
[1:35:24] to be manifested in the age of that
[1:35:28] challenge and we know that the reason
[1:35:31] they are predestinated
[1:35:32] they're predestinated to overcome the
[1:35:36] challenge
[1:35:36] of their age amen this is why the book
[1:35:40] of revelation says
[1:35:41] he that overcometh he that overcometh he
[1:35:44] that overcometh i'm not talking about
[1:35:46] overcoming the things of luther and
[1:35:48] wesley and
[1:35:49] pentecost and way back in another age
[1:35:52] this is the most difficult age
[1:35:56] amen that we are living in now the devil
[1:35:59] himself amen has been turned loose
[1:36:03] i mean it's so bad amen
[1:36:07] we're not fighting against flesh
[1:36:10] and blood but against principalities and
[1:36:13] powers and
[1:36:14] devils that we have not seen
[1:36:18] yet on the face of this earth why but
[1:36:21] now do we
[1:36:22] run away from these trials do we run
[1:36:25] away from the
[1:36:26] boogeyman no god has predestinated
[1:36:30] a people for every age amen
[1:36:34] just like joseph was manifested
[1:36:38] in his day what was his purpose
[1:36:41] it was to preserve life so his purpose
[1:36:44] was to preserve
[1:36:45] life then there had to be a risk of
[1:36:48] losing
[1:36:49] that life in his age in order for him to
[1:36:52] be able to preserve the life
[1:36:55] amen that the devil wanted to uh
[1:36:58] to do away with everybody so now i hope
[1:37:01] that you're following me just
[1:37:02] just a second in every age there is a
[1:37:05] challenge and yet god predestinates a
[1:37:07] people
[1:37:08] he meant to meet the challenge of that
[1:37:09] day did you get it did you feel it do
[1:37:11] you see it
[1:37:12] do you understand that's what happened
[1:37:15] today
[1:37:15] he predestinated this by
[1:37:19] his for knowledge listen all of this
[1:37:22] that happened to
[1:37:23] 2020 this is all ready predestinated
[1:37:27] listen we're
[1:37:27] trained for this already amen
[1:37:30] and we should be standing and saying
[1:37:33] satan is that all you've got
[1:37:36] amen you can't defeat me with covet you
[1:37:39] can't defeat me with the economic
[1:37:41] disasters amen paul said amen there is
[1:37:44] no nothing shall separate us from the
[1:37:47] love of god
[1:37:48] no famine no nakedness of sword nothing
[1:37:52] present nor things to come
[1:37:53] shall be able to separate us from the
[1:37:56] love of god
[1:37:57] that is the believer's testimony
[1:38:00] praise god hallelujah i'm talking about
[1:38:02] the bride believers now i'm not talking
[1:38:04] about
[1:38:04] make believers when he predestinated in
[1:38:07] malachi 4
[1:38:09] see it's got to happen when he comes
[1:38:11] over
[1:38:12] and produce predestinates anything to
[1:38:14] happen in his word
[1:38:16] uh see he had to prove his word to be
[1:38:20] so when he predestinates anything to
[1:38:23] happen
[1:38:24] and says it will happen he knows that
[1:38:27] seed will be there just at that time
[1:38:31] amen when he sees disaster he plans a
[1:38:34] certain disaster for every ager
[1:38:36] challenge for every day
[1:38:38] for that age he knows that that believer
[1:38:40] that seed will be there at that time
[1:38:43] what for to stand as a testimony that
[1:38:46] jesus christ
[1:38:47] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:38:50] because in
[1:38:50] every age god has his witnesses
[1:38:54] amen witnesses of his resurrection that
[1:38:56] god is not dead but he's alive
[1:38:59] amen he is alive he knows that seed will
[1:39:02] be there
[1:39:03] just at that time he's uh he
[1:39:05] predestinated
[1:39:07] a bride so in this day a bride will be
[1:39:10] there
[1:39:11] amen in this age in this most difficult
[1:39:14] challenging age god has already
[1:39:17] predestinated a bride
[1:39:19] to be here why to be defeated
[1:39:22] to run back in denominations no that's
[1:39:25] not the reason
[1:39:26] he predestinated bride to be manifested
[1:39:29] so she's going to be there she's going
[1:39:32] to be
[1:39:32] in uh to be raptured she's going to be
[1:39:35] there
[1:39:36] he's predestinated by foreign knowledge
[1:39:39] see
[1:39:40] there's nothing going to stop it
[1:39:44] amen and that is the believers
[1:39:47] amen to the word of god amen nothing
[1:39:51] when you grab a hold of that word
[1:39:54] the promises that god has uh so
[1:39:57] beautifully revealed to us all
[1:40:01] the mysteries the hidden mysteries amen
[1:40:04] many people say the mysteries are not
[1:40:06] open amen listen
[1:40:09] in the book of revelations chapter 10
[1:40:13] amen in the days of the voice of the
[1:40:15] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:40:17] sound what does it say
[1:40:18] the mystery of god should be finished
[1:40:22] and brother branham anointed that
[1:40:24] scripture
[1:40:25] amen for his for his own ministry
[1:40:29] the mysteries of god should be
[1:40:32] finished just because you don't see it
[1:40:35] it doesn't mean they're not
[1:40:36] finished amen you maybe be blind to it
[1:40:39] amen so therefore the malachi 4
[1:40:43] was vindicated by the mysteries
[1:40:47] of the book amen when he opened the
[1:40:50] seventh seal when he
[1:40:52] opened amen and uh revealed to us the
[1:40:55] coming of the lord the seventh under the
[1:40:57] seven seals and so forth
[1:40:58] amen that we're preaching vindicated
[1:41:02] prophet amen because this angel of
[1:41:05] revelations
[1:41:06] 10 amen when he shall begin to sound
[1:41:09] the mysteries of god should be finished
[1:41:12] amen as was written in the bible
[1:41:16] so therefore we're not looking for
[1:41:18] another messenger to try to make
[1:41:20] this more clear it's clear in itself
[1:41:23] amen brother brown said the seventh seal
[1:41:27] is is like a rocket that goes up amen
[1:41:30] uh like firework and it explodes
[1:41:34] and one explosion creates two explosions
[1:41:37] and two
[1:41:37] turns into four four into eight and
[1:41:39] eight into sixteen
[1:41:41] and it goes on and on keeps exploding
[1:41:43] amen what
[1:41:45] what are those explosions they are
[1:41:47] mysteries
[1:41:48] being manifested amen and the seventh
[1:41:51] seal
[1:41:52] is still exploding it will explode until
[1:41:55] the coming of the lord
[1:41:57] this mystery being made real this mr b
[1:42:01] made real but it's all ready unveiled
[1:42:05] if you can believe it because if brother
[1:42:08] branham ever have to come back
[1:42:10] to reveal anything amen then we where do
[1:42:13] you place that
[1:42:14] in the word there's no type there's no
[1:42:16] shadow there's nothing
[1:42:18] for you to be able to teach that
[1:42:20] doctrine amen
[1:42:21] neither can you preach amen i am the
[1:42:24] holy ghost that is the most
[1:42:26] uh doctrine of error that i have ever
[1:42:29] heard
[1:42:30] i am the holy ghost we are filled with
[1:42:33] the holy ghost
[1:42:34] how can we be fi how can we be the holy
[1:42:37] ghost
[1:42:38] when jesus told his disciples
[1:42:41] to go into the upper room amen after
[1:42:44] they had
[1:42:45] received amen the holy spirit of promise
[1:42:49] that was a promise that they received
[1:42:52] when he breathed upon them they received
[1:42:54] the promise
[1:42:56] amen of it was sealed by the word
[1:43:00] but they still had to go to the upper
[1:43:03] room
[1:43:03] and be filled with the holy spirit
[1:43:07] and the holy spirit it may come down on
[1:43:09] the day of pentecost
[1:43:12] broke uh and divided himself
[1:43:15] amen among the 120
[1:43:19] it was god uh the holy spirit in one man
[1:43:22] jesus christ in its fullness then it
[1:43:25] divided himself
[1:43:27] amen among the of the bride of jesus
[1:43:29] christ and whenever somebody tells you
[1:43:32] you are the holy spirit what it is i'm
[1:43:35] going to tell you
[1:43:36] is uh the devil trying to take that
[1:43:39] desire
[1:43:40] out of you to even seek the holy spirit
[1:43:43] amen we
[1:43:44] must be signing and crying for the
[1:43:48] baptism of the holy spirit
[1:43:50] it's not uh an intellectual something
[1:43:53] that you
[1:43:54] hear it's an experience that comes into
[1:43:57] your heart amen
[1:43:59] and you'll never be the same praise god
[1:44:02] you can't
[1:44:03] just teach the holy ghost that you have
[1:44:05] it already or you
[1:44:06] are that's a good baptist doctrine
[1:44:10] brother branham said
[1:44:11] it's not a bride doctrine it's a baptist
[1:44:15] doctrine and we're not amen
[1:44:18] the womb our spiritual
[1:44:22] bride womb has been sealed no other seed
[1:44:26] can enter there it's too late satan
[1:44:29] the word is in the bride
[1:44:32] amen there is no false seed amen that
[1:44:35] can
[1:44:36] enter into that bride won't praise god
[1:44:39] because she's already
[1:44:40] expecting the perfect amen
[1:44:43] manifestation of the word amen
[1:44:47] by the perfect word so you see men
[1:44:49] always will
[1:44:50] look to make things even more
[1:44:53] interesting
[1:44:54] with more appeal amen and that's how
[1:44:59] eve was deceived because she wanted
[1:45:02] a greater light she wanted something
[1:45:05] different she got
[1:45:06] bored with uh
[1:45:09] just what she had i tell you what i'm
[1:45:12] not bored
[1:45:13] amen it's a new experience every day
[1:45:16] amen i'm satisfied with this message of
[1:45:19] malachi 4.
[1:45:20] amen it keeps me going every day and in
[1:45:23] fact
[1:45:24] every time i read a book hear a tape i
[1:45:27] get more and more
[1:45:28] i can exhaust god amen it's a
[1:45:32] one baptism many feelings
[1:45:36] one baptism but many refillings and
[1:45:38] feelings and feelings
[1:45:39] amen but you can never ever
[1:45:42] misplace the holy ghost by telling
[1:45:45] people that they
[1:45:46] are the holy ghost that's an error folks
[1:45:49] and that will always be an error amen i
[1:45:52] know
[1:45:53] i knew that for years i didn't say
[1:45:55] anything
[1:45:56] but i knew that based on conversations
[1:45:59] i've had
[1:46:00] with certain individuals i knew that for
[1:46:02] years that's false
[1:46:04] amen and i knew when it started to ride
[1:46:06] in like that
[1:46:07] amen watch where it takes you you had
[1:46:10] this time uh
[1:46:12] also of of the movement going back to
[1:46:15] israel oh they're gonna take the
[1:46:16] message to israel and uh the
[1:46:20] turning from the gentiles uh
[1:46:22] dispensation over to the jews and we're
[1:46:24] gonna
[1:46:25] do this and we're gonna do that that all
[1:46:27] phases out
[1:46:29] you don't hear much about that anymore
[1:46:30] why brother branham
[1:46:32] uh see that god already has his moses
[1:46:36] and elijah
[1:46:37] ready amen to visit amen
[1:46:40] the jews with the mighty holy ghost
[1:46:43] revival
[1:46:44] he doesn't need our help not even
[1:46:46] brother branham could have gone
[1:46:47] there amen although he believed that
[1:46:50] they would have received the sign
[1:46:52] of of the prophet that
[1:46:56] that every uh jew always believed their
[1:46:59] prophets and of course the signs
[1:47:01] and brother branham had uh the holy
[1:47:04] ghost with
[1:47:04] signs following amen he did believe that
[1:47:07] they would receive it but it wasn't
[1:47:10] his ministry it wasn't his calling
[1:47:13] so just stay within your ministry
[1:47:16] stay let us just stay loving one another
[1:47:19] and trying to
[1:47:20] uh finally uh unite together the unity
[1:47:24] of the faith
[1:47:25] one lord one baptism one one
[1:47:28] faith praise god see we have a hard time
[1:47:32] just doing that
[1:47:32] but meanwhile we're gonna try to save
[1:47:34] israel too we can't even save ourselves
[1:47:37] amen so anyway okay i don't know why i
[1:47:39] said that but
[1:47:40] so now let's uh wind it down
[1:47:45] if i can i'm sorry i'm taking this long
[1:47:48] uh let's wind it down with
[1:47:51] joseph the next few minutes
[1:47:54] i'm going to speak about joseph because
[1:47:57] we spoke about
[1:47:59] how god always predestinates somebody
[1:48:03] to meet the challenge of
[1:48:07] their time see there's a word
[1:48:11] and there's a messenger there's an age
[1:48:14] and there is uh people
[1:48:18] amen to receive the messenger of that
[1:48:21] age so now we're speaking about
[1:48:24] our word our promise
[1:48:27] our time adoption time amen through this
[1:48:31] very beautiful type of joseph
[1:48:34] we just realized that joseph was loved
[1:48:37] by the father
[1:48:38] and yet hated of his brethren in genesis
[1:48:42] 37 we we i don't want to go and read the
[1:48:45] whole thing but
[1:48:47] the father loved uh
[1:48:50] joseph and expressed it in a way
[1:48:53] that he gave him a seven color
[1:48:57] coat beautiful coat and
[1:49:00] we know that was just a type amen
[1:49:03] because no one else could
[1:49:04] really use that coat but joseph because
[1:49:08] joseph was spiritual
[1:49:10] he was uh in tight uh
[1:49:13] manifesting jesus christ in type amen
[1:49:17] joseph was not
[1:49:18] jesus but he was a type of jesus nothing
[1:49:21] against
[1:49:22] joseph realize that but we realize that
[1:49:26] the father
[1:49:28] gave him the garment of a seven
[1:49:31] color rainbow coat testifying
[1:49:35] of the very virtues that was in joseph
[1:49:38] and he made him a coat
[1:49:39] and his brothers were jealous because
[1:49:43] they did not receive the same coat not
[1:49:46] only that
[1:49:47] but uh he was a spiritual uh
[1:49:51] young man joseph was a spiritual
[1:49:54] young man loved by his father hated by
[1:49:58] his brethren
[1:49:59] and this is why it's more important
[1:50:01] friends that we
[1:50:03] know that we are loved by our fathers
[1:50:07] a father rather than be loved by our
[1:50:10] brethren
[1:50:11] and this is why i have often come into
[1:50:13] the pulpit many times
[1:50:15] i said i would rather tell the church
[1:50:18] what the lord tell told me to say
[1:50:22] amen rather than and and if they are
[1:50:24] offended i rather they be offended with
[1:50:26] me
[1:50:27] then my father be offended with me
[1:50:29] because if i do what my father tells me
[1:50:31] to do then i'm
[1:50:32] uh doing the works of my father so we
[1:50:35] realized how
[1:50:36] joseph was so pleasing to uh
[1:50:40] jacob that uh amen
[1:50:43] he had this special relationship with
[1:50:46] his
[1:50:46] uh son joseph and he loved him because
[1:50:49] he was a child of his old
[1:50:51] age but now let's continue this story
[1:50:55] because joseph was a dreamer he dreamed
[1:50:58] he couldn't help but he was a dreamer
[1:51:01] amen and
[1:51:02] he had several dreams of course
[1:51:06] that were very similar and
[1:51:09] we know that the prophet said that
[1:51:12] two dreams similar dreams or two dreams
[1:51:15] of the exact same interpretation
[1:51:17] is actually a vision so what joseph
[1:51:20] was actually living in was a vision and
[1:51:23] yet
[1:51:24] it was out of season amen it showed
[1:51:27] that he was to rule he couldn't rule
[1:51:31] his brethren at that time they hated to
[1:51:33] he even hear
[1:51:35] what he had to say so we realized
[1:51:38] that after he innocently
[1:51:41] shared his uh dreams and testimonies
[1:51:45] with his brother
[1:51:46] his brothers got so angry amen that day
[1:51:51] uh one day when
[1:51:54] his their brother joseph was looking out
[1:51:57] for them
[1:51:58] and they saw and they conspired to
[1:52:01] number one remove and take and steal his
[1:52:05] coat
[1:52:05] and number two cast them into a ditch
[1:52:08] amen
[1:52:09] then the false doctrine
[1:52:12] was started that
[1:52:16] joseph was dead it started with the
[1:52:20] brethren
[1:52:21] and could you imagine they slayed
[1:52:24] an animal put the animal blood all over
[1:52:27] joseph's coat
[1:52:28] amen and they preach this falsehood to
[1:52:32] jacob and the rest of the family and
[1:52:34] they mourn
[1:52:35] the death of joseph and yet
[1:52:39] they stay silent because they were all
[1:52:41] privy
[1:52:43] to that lie and remember the
[1:52:46] spirit-filled
[1:52:47] church is not dead she's alive
[1:52:51] surely god has a crop somewhere she may
[1:52:55] not be visible
[1:52:56] but god is growing a crop somewhere god
[1:52:59] is
[1:52:59] training a people god is training a
[1:53:02] group of people around the world amen
[1:53:04] that's gonna come to perfection
[1:53:06] by the word amen even you see the
[1:53:09] popular people that i don't see
[1:53:10] nothing i don't see nothing happening
[1:53:12] and everything that the prophet said is
[1:53:14] not
[1:53:16] why should i stay in a message church
[1:53:19] when nothing has taken place
[1:53:21] but surely god has a
[1:53:24] church somewhere that's coming to
[1:53:26] perfection
[1:53:27] by the word of god amen so that
[1:53:31] so therefore when we see how
[1:53:35] they cast them into a ditch
[1:53:39] i'm going to hurry up now because my
[1:53:41] time is running out
[1:53:45] joseph was born
[1:53:49] a spiritual man a prophet a seer a
[1:53:52] dreamer
[1:53:53] an interpreter of dreams spiritual and
[1:53:56] he was hated
[1:53:57] by his brethren loved by the father a
[1:53:59] perfect type as i said
[1:54:01] of the church they hated him without
[1:54:05] a cause and many times you wonder
[1:54:08] why uh groups of people
[1:54:12] they get blasted they get uh
[1:54:16] evil things said against them you wonder
[1:54:18] why
[1:54:19] i'm just trying to do the will of the
[1:54:21] father
[1:54:23] and people have taken and and gone into
[1:54:26] public platforms and
[1:54:29] this is why i don't have
[1:54:33] a facebook account the church has one
[1:54:36] but i personally don't
[1:54:38] amen you know why because all the
[1:54:40] grievances and things like that are put
[1:54:42] on
[1:54:43] facebook and and we're blasting one
[1:54:46] another
[1:54:46] showing this video of you blasting
[1:54:49] someone
[1:54:50] and you calling somebody a black mamba
[1:54:52] you calling this one
[1:54:53] uh uh that one you think god is pleased
[1:54:57] with our behavior
[1:54:59] do you think god is pleased with that
[1:55:02] amen
[1:55:03] you may feel good about oh yeah i zinged
[1:55:05] them among that one but the holy spirit
[1:55:08] amen the tutor that is looking
[1:55:11] and follows you everywhere one thing you
[1:55:14] cannot tell the tutor
[1:55:15] okay uh you have to stay out of this
[1:55:18] uh i want you to follow me into this
[1:55:20] place no the tutor
[1:55:23] follows you everywhere and the tutor
[1:55:25] cannot be bought out
[1:55:26] because he reports back to the father
[1:55:29] exactly
[1:55:30] what you have done and what you uh
[1:55:34] will do amen our behavior
[1:55:37] our nature has come so short of that
[1:55:40] which
[1:55:40] we profess to have we're supposed to
[1:55:43] have
[1:55:44] by now amen faith virtue knowledge
[1:55:47] tempers patience at least a measure of
[1:55:49] it and and striving to be
[1:55:52] uh positionally placed but the first one
[1:55:54] to cross you you want
[1:55:56] their head you chop their head off and
[1:55:58] you blast and you put this one into hell
[1:56:01] and take them out of hell
[1:56:02] of the next week and and they're in
[1:56:06] purgatory i'm glad that you're not god
[1:56:09] hey man i'm glad that god is god because
[1:56:12] our god is a god of mercy
[1:56:14] if we were to if god was to judge us the
[1:56:17] way we judge one another we
[1:56:19] would be finished friends amen and it's
[1:56:22] going to show you in this type of joseph
[1:56:24] that uh we are going to continue to
[1:56:28] speak on here so joseph
[1:56:31] was sold to
[1:56:35] midianite merchants
[1:56:39] they put him in a hole they were going
[1:56:42] to
[1:56:42] kill him and yet uh the elder said no
[1:56:47] let's not kill him uh but before
[1:56:50] he could go and reach joseph
[1:56:54] joseph was already sold amen to the
[1:56:57] midnight merchants amen for
[1:57:00] 20 pieces of silver jesse again once
[1:57:03] again
[1:57:04] uh the perfect type
[1:57:07] of jesus christ i hope you're following
[1:57:09] me now
[1:57:10] but now here is what i want to
[1:57:13] say in it all in this
[1:57:17] rejection of joseph in this
[1:57:20] uh real fierce rejection of who joseph
[1:57:25] was
[1:57:26] and what he was trying to
[1:57:29] share with the brethren they hated him
[1:57:32] they hated him
[1:57:33] and yet they put him in a hole and
[1:57:38] sold him to the first merchants that
[1:57:42] came around the midi night merchants
[1:57:44] for 20 pieces of silver and the
[1:57:47] merchants
[1:57:47] took him where they were where were they
[1:57:50] traveling
[1:57:51] they wasn't traveling see they had to be
[1:57:54] merchants that were traveling to egypt
[1:57:57] because god knew amen where to take that
[1:58:02] gift because he knew that that
[1:58:04] gift would be the deliverance
[1:58:07] of egypt in the time
[1:58:10] at an appointed time you see so the
[1:58:14] midianite merchants thought that they
[1:58:16] were just
[1:58:17] transporting a slave
[1:58:20] in their caravan but they didn't realize
[1:58:24] that they were transporting the prince
[1:58:27] of egypt
[1:58:27] and the one that would help deliver
[1:58:31] one of the mightiest men that could
[1:58:34] exist
[1:58:34] in egypt at the time that is who the
[1:58:38] midianites were
[1:58:39] transporting to the proper place
[1:58:42] because joseph could his ministry could
[1:58:46] not
[1:58:46] grow in canaan his ministry could only
[1:58:49] be made manifest
[1:58:51] in egypt because he was a man of vision
[1:58:55] he was a man that was uh ready and
[1:58:58] fixing to to lead but he had to lead
[1:59:02] somebody he had to see there had to be a
[1:59:05] need
[1:59:06] for a specific leader at the time
[1:59:09] and of course this is why
[1:59:13] sometimes we hate the trials because god
[1:59:17] we want to go from being born again
[1:59:20] straight into the leadership position
[1:59:22] without trial without a test without
[1:59:24] anything no you have to be molded you
[1:59:27] have to be
[1:59:28] child trained you have to be tested and
[1:59:31] tried the word of the lord must try you
[1:59:34] until his word came the word
[1:59:37] amen tried uh joseph
[1:59:40] so when we realized that when joseph or
[1:59:44] reached egypt then he was uh sold to
[1:59:47] potiphar as a servant but one thing that
[1:59:49] was
[1:59:50] uh beautiful about this story is that
[1:59:52] joseph
[1:59:53] was anointed joseph was blessed of god
[1:59:56] joseph had a different spirit with him
[1:59:59] amen why because god amen he was he was
[2:00:03] spiritual
[2:00:04] he was blessed everything that he
[2:00:06] touched amen
[2:00:07] was blessed of god and when
[2:00:10] potiphar took him into his house amen
[2:00:13] his house immediately amen become
[2:00:17] blessed the anointing changes in
[2:00:20] in his entire house and he was blessed
[2:00:23] there was a joy in the house and things
[2:00:25] were
[2:00:26] uh looking up amen and of course then
[2:00:30] then come the trial potiphar's wife
[2:00:33] accused him now you see you talk about
[2:00:36] being tempted
[2:00:38] you're gonna have uh three wild attacks
[2:00:41] money
[2:00:41] women popularity and there joseph
[2:00:45] was facing that first attack amen
[2:00:48] woman amen who uh desired him potiphar's
[2:00:51] wife
[2:00:52] desired joseph but he overcame
[2:00:56] amen and this is what i tell my young
[2:00:58] people don't
[2:00:59] stand around waiting how long you can
[2:01:02] forebear
[2:01:02] amen run for your life that's what
[2:01:05] joseph did to overcome
[2:01:07] amen don't go into these shady places
[2:01:10] and stay and see i'll see i'm not
[2:01:12] tempted as much as
[2:01:14] i sh i could be no run the other way
[2:01:17] that was his victory that was joseph's
[2:01:20] victory don't stand around
[2:01:22] trying to figure out how long you can
[2:01:24] hang around in in the devil's uh
[2:01:26] uh territory run for your life and guess
[2:01:30] what it cost him
[2:01:31] his job it cost him his job
[2:01:34] even but he overcame the trial amen he
[2:01:38] did not fall for potiphar's wife
[2:01:41] amen and that trial cost him
[2:01:45] and put him in jail oh some of us don't
[2:01:49] want to trial some of us have to go
[2:01:51] through the period of time where we uh
[2:01:54] after we overcome we think well bless
[2:01:57] god god is gonna
[2:01:59] uh give me a blessing and we find
[2:02:02] ourselves
[2:02:03] sometimes in another trial in a deeper
[2:02:06] hole
[2:02:07] as it were but you see
[2:02:10] what god was doing he was
[2:02:14] testing joseph until
[2:02:18] his prophecy amen until the vision
[2:02:22] came amen to pass he had to try
[2:02:26] amen that gift and mold that gift
[2:02:29] that gift was not ready yet to rule
[2:02:33] he was it was not ready amen
[2:02:36] to uh take the position of authority
[2:02:39] so god chose to put him first
[2:02:43] in uh to allow to put him
[2:02:46] in prison uh we realized that part of
[2:02:50] her
[2:02:50] amen put him into prison
[2:02:53] take thinking that he had uh desired his
[2:02:57] wife
[2:02:57] and of course once again he was accused
[2:03:01] amen and they hated him without a cause
[2:03:05] so he ended up in prison and i have
[2:03:08] loved this
[2:03:09] type so many times before what did he do
[2:03:13] in prison in a time that if anyone
[2:03:17] could have had uh
[2:03:20] a complaint it was joseph he could have
[2:03:24] had a complaint
[2:03:25] he could have asked god lord what did i
[2:03:27] do to deserve this
[2:03:29] what did i do that my brethren sold me
[2:03:31] for 28 pieces of silver
[2:03:33] lord what did i do but just
[2:03:37] ran away from potiphar's wife i didn't
[2:03:39] want to sin
[2:03:40] amen what did i do and i end up in
[2:03:43] prison
[2:03:44] amen what he ended up was in god's
[2:03:47] training ground
[2:03:48] sometimes you have to go through the
[2:03:50] hard trials
[2:03:51] sometimes you have to go through those
[2:03:53] moments where
[2:03:55] where it seems like god is far away
[2:03:58] from you but god has ordered this trial
[2:04:01] remember
[2:04:02] amen so he went into prison and
[2:04:05] guess what the holy spirit was still
[2:04:08] upon him
[2:04:09] god prospered him god blessed him
[2:04:12] and so much that he took over the prison
[2:04:15] amen and this is why i always say satan
[2:04:18] if you're gonna put me in prison or
[2:04:20] if i'm permitted to go in prison i'm
[2:04:22] gonna take over that
[2:04:23] prison i am i want you to be reminded
[2:04:26] that
[2:04:27] i am amen i call the shots
[2:04:30] amen if i'm gonna dwell in this prison i
[2:04:33] call a shot
[2:04:34] so joseph had a nature had an ability
[2:04:38] had
[2:04:39] a character to rule and every place he
[2:04:42] was
[2:04:42] placed he ruled amen he took over the
[2:04:46] prison
[2:04:47] amen the the the the prison guards
[2:04:51] okay listen we leave everything unto you
[2:04:54] amen you run it the way you want to run
[2:04:56] it oh my my
[2:04:58] so god blessed him in the prison and one
[2:05:01] day
[2:05:02] he came across amen two
[2:05:05] of uh pharaoh's
[2:05:09] servants one was a baker and the other
[2:05:12] ones
[2:05:12] one was a butler a baker and a butler
[2:05:16] now i want you to see
[2:05:18] the beautiful story and i'm closing soon
[2:05:21] how now he's gotten a little closer to
[2:05:25] the throne
[2:05:26] amen he went at first
[2:05:29] he was introduced to potiphar okay he
[2:05:32] was
[2:05:33] uh pharaoh's uh
[2:05:36] captain of the guards okay but now
[2:05:40] he meets two individuals that are
[2:05:43] actually
[2:05:44] servants of pharaoh and
[2:05:48] he's coming a little closer now
[2:05:52] to the throne and we realize that with
[2:05:55] god's gift in joseph those two
[2:05:59] uh servants had dreams
[2:06:03] and of course the butler had a dream and
[2:06:06] the baker had a dream and
[2:06:09] they needed they were troubled in their
[2:06:12] spirit
[2:06:13] and joseph one day going around the jail
[2:06:17] he asked him why are you so sad today
[2:06:20] can you imagine joseph going around jail
[2:06:22] asking the president why are you so sad
[2:06:24] today
[2:06:25] oh joseph must have had a inner
[2:06:28] happiness
[2:06:29] that the others did not have why you so
[2:06:32] sad
[2:06:33] amen and that's one thing about a son of
[2:06:35] god god
[2:06:37] will give you something even in your
[2:06:40] trial
[2:06:41] that you will not be affected by the
[2:06:44] outside world
[2:06:46] listen if you are a christian a true
[2:06:48] born again
[2:06:49] christian god amen you're sealed in and
[2:06:52] the outside world is sealed out
[2:06:54] you're not affected by the outside world
[2:06:57] and
[2:06:58] and we see that in joseph he was in
[2:07:00] prison he wasn't affected by the outside
[2:07:03] world
[2:07:03] amen he even asked those two uh
[2:07:06] servants why are you so
[2:07:10] sad and they told them we had dreams and
[2:07:13] now here
[2:07:13] is the gift that god uh was training
[2:07:17] all along and he told them the
[2:07:19] interpretation of
[2:07:21] those uh two uh dreams that they had one
[2:07:26] [Music]
[2:07:27] was interpreted to life and the other
[2:07:30] one
[2:07:30] to death the baker
[2:07:33] he was to lose his life and
[2:07:36] the butler would be restored and we know
[2:07:40] the story
[2:07:41] i'm gonna wind down now because i don't
[2:07:43] want to keep you much longer
[2:07:44] we all know the story how the
[2:07:48] butler when he joseph told him
[2:07:52] that he would be restored amen and
[2:07:56] when you go back to pharaoh
[2:07:59] please remember me and speak
[2:08:03] kindly amen of me to pharaoh
[2:08:08] and uh that's what he did but the butler
[2:08:11] came back
[2:08:13] he forgot joseph for another
[2:08:17] two years the gift of god was still
[2:08:20] being honed in prison
[2:08:24] honed in prison and a rumor going around
[2:08:28] throughout the land of canaan that
[2:08:29] joseph had died and meanwhile joseph was
[2:08:31] in prison
[2:08:32] being tested proven until
[2:08:36] just fixing to come back into
[2:08:39] a view into public into power amen
[2:08:43] but listen to this why
[2:08:47] it wasn't the butler who forgot
[2:08:51] god took it out of his memory because
[2:08:54] at that time there was no famine in the
[2:08:59] land
[2:09:00] at that time there was no emergency
[2:09:04] pharaoh was not troubled and
[2:09:07] his testimony about joseph would would
[2:09:10] not be
[2:09:11] effective even if he told pharaoh
[2:09:14] listen there's a man in prison that his
[2:09:17] name is
[2:09:18] joseph and he can interpret dreams and
[2:09:20] so forth
[2:09:21] oh no no he was busy celebrating he was
[2:09:24] uh
[2:09:25] drunk and so forth he wasn't in the
[2:09:27] right frame of mind to receive that
[2:09:29] report
[2:09:31] two years pass now pharaoh
[2:09:36] had the dreams now it wasn't
[2:09:39] the dreams that saved pharaoh it was the
[2:09:43] interpretation
[2:09:44] of the dream that saved egypt see
[2:09:47] because
[2:09:48] pharaoh would have perished perish with
[2:09:50] his dreams
[2:09:52] but the gift is what brought the truth
[2:09:54] out
[2:09:55] of the dream so when pharaoh dreamed the
[2:09:58] dream and he called
[2:10:00] his ministers to discuss it and not a
[2:10:03] one of them could
[2:10:05] could tell them what it was it was a
[2:10:07] great mystery
[2:10:08] and then the butler remembered
[2:10:12] he remembered why
[2:10:15] there was a time of of emergency pharaoh
[2:10:19] was troubled all of
[2:10:22] egypt was troubled when pharaoh is
[2:10:24] troubled then all of egypt
[2:10:26] is troubled his uh aids in the
[2:10:30] in the palace are troubled with uh
[2:10:33] pharaoh but what happened
[2:10:36] as i finish this simple thought
[2:10:40] and yet so true he said i forgot to tell
[2:10:44] you
[2:10:45] i am so sorry that uh
[2:10:48] when i was put in jail because i
[2:10:52] displease you pharaoh i was put in jail
[2:10:55] and i
[2:10:55] met somebody in jail oh
[2:10:58] who interpreted my dream now it was an
[2:11:02] emergency
[2:11:03] now there was a need now there was a
[2:11:06] situation that needed to be addressed
[2:11:09] amen and god had trained
[2:11:13] the gift for the need amen
[2:11:16] for that hour so you see when the
[2:11:20] squeeze
[2:11:21] comes down when there is a need amen so
[2:11:24] urgent that it has to uh
[2:11:28] manifest the truth of god in a
[2:11:31] manifestation of the sons of god don't
[2:11:33] worry amen brother brown said
[2:11:37] the third pull it won't be used
[2:11:40] in a very big way until
[2:11:44] the time comes amen when the squeeze
[2:11:47] comes down
[2:11:48] watch the third pull then watch the
[2:11:50] manifestation of the sons of
[2:11:52] god born sons fill sons place sons
[2:11:56] come into position they have been
[2:11:58] trained for these
[2:11:59] years and years and years for such a
[2:12:02] time as this
[2:12:04] amen you say it's getting worse well the
[2:12:07] sons of god are getting more powerful
[2:12:09] the daughters of god is getting more
[2:12:11] powerful they are trained for this
[2:12:13] position they're trained for this uh uh
[2:12:16] job
[2:12:16] amen so when joseph was called amen by
[2:12:21] pharaoh oh my
[2:12:24] he waited for that call for many years
[2:12:29] and he stood in the front of pharaoh and
[2:12:32] pharaoh told him his dream
[2:12:35] he said they tell me that you have a
[2:12:37] gift
[2:12:38] to interpret dreams amen
[2:12:41] he said no not i'm not i can not me
[2:12:44] that can interpret dreams but
[2:12:48] the god that's in me amen can interpret
[2:12:52] uh the dream so therefore tell me your
[2:12:54] dream
[2:12:55] and god used that gift
[2:12:59] amen at the right time
[2:13:02] to fill a need that was needed
[2:13:07] amen he told him of a 14-year prophecy
[2:13:12] seven years of plenty seven years of
[2:13:15] famine
[2:13:15] was coming and not only that
[2:13:19] he joseph himself told pharaoh
[2:13:23] and wrote out a resume this is a man
[2:13:25] that you need
[2:13:27] to do this job he should uh
[2:13:30] be spirit-led he should know what he's
[2:13:32] doing he should do this he should be
[2:13:34] able to qualify to do this he should be
[2:13:36] he should qualify to do that the other
[2:13:39] he wrote the resume
[2:13:41] and no one else could have filled that
[2:13:44] job but
[2:13:45] joseph himself why because
[2:13:48] there was a need at that time
[2:13:51] amen until his word
[2:13:55] came the word of the lord
[2:13:58] tried joseph so now it
[2:14:01] finally had come joseph had
[2:14:04] arrived to his destiny he was born
[2:14:07] to rule amen he ruled
[2:14:11] in the prison he ruled in potiphar's
[2:14:14] house
[2:14:15] but now god was lifting him up higher
[2:14:18] a little bit much higher than before
[2:14:21] even because now
[2:14:22] we were talking about the right hand man
[2:14:26] of pharaoh oh my and nobody could have
[2:14:30] fit
[2:14:31] that uh slot but joseph himself
[2:14:35] amen when god is training his people
[2:14:39] god is training his men for the last
[2:14:42] great kill nobody can take your place
[2:14:45] because you have been trained for this
[2:14:48] purpose you have been trained for such a
[2:14:51] time as this
[2:14:52] amen let the devils turn loose but
[2:14:55] god has a people god has a church
[2:14:59] god has a a a group of people that will
[2:15:02] be
[2:15:02] able to withstand every attack every a
[2:15:06] while
[2:15:07] attack of the devil amen and we're
[2:15:10] coming to that friends
[2:15:12] so therefore when pharaoh said oh what
[2:15:14] other men can we find to take this job
[2:15:17] but
[2:15:18] the man who's standing in front of me
[2:15:20] you told me about this
[2:15:22] you told me what he needs to be there is
[2:15:23] no one
[2:15:26] that qualifies for this job but you
[2:15:30] and i'm gonna tell you something my
[2:15:31] friends amen
[2:15:33] it's time for the manifestation of the
[2:15:35] sons of god and god has been
[2:15:36] training his people in the backside of
[2:15:38] the desert
[2:15:39] amen we have been forgotten among many
[2:15:42] other uh
[2:15:43] people we are considered no longer in
[2:15:45] the message
[2:15:46] amen there's rumors going around oh oh
[2:15:48] they died
[2:15:49] long ago they're oh they're finished
[2:15:52] whatever oh no
[2:15:53] god is is training
[2:15:56] and honing those sons of god in the
[2:15:59] backside of the desert just
[2:16:01] waiting for the opportunity amen to
[2:16:03] manifest that
[2:16:05] gift that god has placed in the bride of
[2:16:08] jesus christ
[2:16:09] and that bride that gift is not just for
[2:16:11] just healing
[2:16:12] i'm talking about god himself
[2:16:17] tabernacle in these vessels
[2:16:21] walking the literal manifestation of the
[2:16:26] sons of god that when they see you they
[2:16:28] see the father
[2:16:30] jesus christ wants to get in your human
[2:16:33] skins

[2:16:46] your daughter is is his wayward and
[2:16:48] needs god just
[2:16:49] speak the word amen and brother branham
[2:16:53] as an example seed's son he demonstrated
[2:16:56] the spoken word with five manifestations
[2:17:00] we see creation we see salvation we see
[2:17:03] uh all kinds of sun power over the
[2:17:06] elements sun stands still
[2:17:08] come out and shine uh
[2:17:12] four days so he commanded the weather to
[2:17:14] move forward see that's the
[2:17:16] manifestation of the sons of god
[2:17:18] in full display but it will not
[2:17:22] be in full use until there is
[2:17:25] amen a real need for it so friends
[2:17:29] you may have gone through a period of
[2:17:30] your time in prison
[2:17:32] you've suffered you've paid your dues
[2:17:35] but don't worry
[2:17:36] every step every day is getting you
[2:17:38] closer to the throne
[2:17:40] you're coming out of prison the church
[2:17:42] is coming out of prison
[2:17:44] amen and it'll be a mighty manifestation
[2:17:47] of the sons of god
[2:17:49] amen and i'm going to tell you something
[2:17:52] to show you
[2:17:53] amen i am i'm gonna just
[2:17:56] go down to the end i'm done i'm finished
[2:17:59] i can't keep you any longer
[2:18:00] but to show you how god had to
[2:18:04] mold and shape joseph
[2:18:08] and put him through trials in such a way
[2:18:10] that
[2:18:11] it molded and and mellowed him out
[2:18:16] his brothers lied about him his brothers
[2:18:19] sold him for 20 pieces of silver
[2:18:23] and in fact preach false doctrines to
[2:18:26] his own father who suffered for years
[2:18:29] and
[2:18:29] mourned his loss can you imagine for
[2:18:31] years and yet he was alive
[2:18:34] he had a right to be upset with his
[2:18:36] brothers he had a right to
[2:18:38] be uh vengeful
[2:18:41] and say you know they don't deserve to
[2:18:43] live but when they saw when joseph
[2:18:45] saw his own brothers on the line
[2:18:49] to get food when the famine was
[2:18:53] heating up throughout the land of canaan
[2:18:56] and they was coming from all parts of
[2:18:58] the world
[2:18:59] to uh be fed because
[2:19:02] israel rather egypt
[2:19:06] had the corn had everything had this uh
[2:19:08] store houses
[2:19:10] uh full of food and joseph was in charge
[2:19:15] the dream was no longer a dream the
[2:19:18] dream was a reality
[2:19:20] amen joseph had reached his destiny
[2:19:24] he was born for that purpose
[2:19:27] amen so you see if there was a
[2:19:30] famine and there needed to be a
[2:19:32] deliverance okay the famine is going to
[2:19:34] come
[2:19:34] but also a deliverance is going to come
[2:19:37] as well
[2:19:39] amen the world is longing to see jesus
[2:19:44] it's getting late they will see jesus
[2:19:46] and the only jesus
[2:19:48] they they will see is that jesus in you
[2:19:51] when he saw his brethren and he didn't
[2:19:53] want them to know
[2:19:55] who he was and he spoke in the egyptian
[2:19:58] language
[2:20:00] and of course they could not believe
[2:20:05] that he was joseph he looked different
[2:20:08] he talked different he talked a
[2:20:09] different language
[2:20:11] but joseph knew and in his heart
[2:20:15] what did he have to do at the end he
[2:20:18] didn't have to do it
[2:20:20] but he still had love for his
[2:20:23] brothers who sold him he still had
[2:20:27] love for his brothers and he
[2:20:31] was a spiritual man knowing that he
[2:20:33] would have never
[2:20:35] gotten to egypt unless they put him on
[2:20:39] that caravan
[2:20:40] of the midianites so god
[2:20:44] ordered the entire program
[2:20:48] and joseph being spiritual he understood
[2:20:50] that he said you had to do
[2:20:53] what you had to do amen but i realized
[2:20:57] i forgive you how's my daddy is he still
[2:21:00] is still
[2:21:00] alive how's my brother is he still alive
[2:21:04] oh what a wonderful time
[2:21:07] of restoration and fellowship it must
[2:21:10] have been
[2:21:10] and friends no matter how
[2:21:14] or what we have gone through people may
[2:21:17] have talked
[2:21:18] bad about you they may have
[2:21:22] cast your name aside dirtied up your
[2:21:25] name
[2:21:26] they could do that but they can never
[2:21:29] dirty you up in front of god because god
[2:21:34] knows
[2:21:34] your heart god knows what you're
[2:21:36] striving
[2:21:38] to do amen let men say what they want to
[2:21:41] say
[2:21:42] let people say what they want to say you
[2:21:45] keep your eyes on jesus and ask him
[2:21:48] always on a daily basis lord keep me
[2:21:52] in this uh trial
[2:21:55] keep me in this trial because the word
[2:21:58] of the lord
[2:22:00] will try you until your word comes
[2:22:04] amen what is your word a word of what
[2:22:06] you're predestinated to be
[2:22:08] that's what your word is i mean god said
[2:22:11] in the beginning that you
[2:22:12] are going to be x y and z that's what
[2:22:15] you are going to be so
[2:22:16] therefore that's your destiny and
[2:22:19] believe me
[2:22:20] amen god said we are
[2:22:24] now are we the sons of god doth not yet
[2:22:26] appear what we shall be
[2:22:28] but we know when he shall appear we
[2:22:30] shall be
[2:22:31] like him and there's many prophecies
[2:22:34] amen the
[2:22:35] church of the living god will stand like
[2:22:38] a mighty
[2:22:39] marching army there is going to be a
[2:22:42] church
[2:22:42] amen and she's going in the rapture as a
[2:22:45] testimony

[2:22:49] yesterday today and forever
[2:22:51] we all have been manifested in this age
[2:22:54] amen
[2:22:55] but there's no challenge there is no
[2:22:58] trouble there is nothing no
[2:23:01] principality no power that can separate
[2:23:04] us from the love of god
[2:23:06] amen because we are predestinated
[2:23:10] overcomers in this day amen

[2:24:22] after that son was adopted his name

[2:25:07] sickness will be arise
[2:25:11] and it will be that way see the blind

[2:26:02] with saying amen uh brother branham
[2:26:06] sons and daughters we need
[2:26:09] adoption and like joseph had to be
[2:26:12] tested
[2:26:12] for years for years for
[2:26:16] years his character needed to be honed
[2:26:19] here
[2:26:20] home there and at the end he had to
[2:26:24] express love to his brothers
[2:26:27] amen that's the real christian not
[2:26:29] somebody who just speaks good words
[2:26:32] and will cut your head off after the
[2:26:34] message
[2:26:35] no love by their fruits
[2:26:38] you shall know them because if what we
[2:26:41] are believing
[2:26:42] does not produce amen the fruit of the
[2:26:45] spirit then we
[2:26:46] are believing something that is
[2:26:48] incorrect amen
[2:26:50] what we believe should manifest
[2:26:53] and bring forth the fruits of the spirit
[2:26:56] and when joseph
[2:26:57] was standing there in his glory and his
[2:27:00] power
[2:27:00] the right hand of pharaoh and yet he
[2:27:02] still have forgiveness in his heart
[2:27:05] for his brothers i forgive you and he
[2:27:07] brought them all
[2:27:08] amen out of that land of canaan back
[2:27:10] into egypt and there they dwelled for
[2:27:13] years amen under his security and
[2:27:16] the the bountiful uh
[2:27:20] abundance of egypt they were all able to
[2:27:23] partake
[2:27:24] of it of course we know that
[2:27:27] after that uh they were put into
[2:27:31] bondage for 400 years or so after that
[2:27:34] because they came
[2:27:35] a pharaoh who knew not joseph and that
[2:27:38] is a whole
[2:27:39] chapter amen that oh to get into
[2:27:43] at some other time god bless you i
[2:27:45] enjoyed
[2:27:46] this uh sharing this little thought with
[2:27:50] you i trust that god would be
[2:27:52] with each and every one of you and
[2:27:54] understand
[2:27:55] uh i'm sorry for the choppiness of the
[2:27:58] message
[2:27:58] i was just trying to type out how
[2:28:02] joseph had to struggle and struggle and
[2:28:05] be
[2:28:06] tested and every test
[2:28:09] was designed to bring them one
[2:28:12] step to the right hand
[2:28:15] of pharaoh there's no mistakes there's
[2:28:18] no mistakes
[2:28:19] amen joseph spent every day that was
[2:28:22] predestinated for him to stay
[2:28:24] in the prison he spent every there's no
[2:28:28] mistakes in god amen so god
[2:28:31] richly bless you we trust that god's
