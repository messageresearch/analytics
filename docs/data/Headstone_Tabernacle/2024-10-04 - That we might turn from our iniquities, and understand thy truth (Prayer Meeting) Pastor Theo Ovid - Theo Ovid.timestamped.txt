[11:57] us we are living in troubless times we
[12:00] living in Bible times we are living in
[12:03] times of fulfillment of prophecies we
[12:06] are living in time that the sages and of
[12:08] the ages look forward for this hour
[12:11] Daniel himself saw a stone cut up
[12:13] without the hands of man we live in in
[12:15] such a Time father God to our hearts
[12:17] tonight our spirits tonight by Your Word

[12:35] ask it
[12:37] amen God bless you welcome
[12:41] so excuse me glad to be here
[12:45] tonight and
[12:47] um before I read the scripture I have a
[12:50] word here to Trav your mind word called
[12:54] complacency that word is a feeling of
[12:56] calm satisfaction with your own
[12:59] abilities or
[13:01] situation that prevents you from trying
[13:06] harder so that is when somebody feeling
[13:08] real cool everything is fine they okay
[13:12] Daniel 9 want to look at some scriptures
[13:14] here night and the title I have of this
[13:17] exaltation to you is that we might turn
[13:21] from our
[13:22] iniquities and understand thy truth I
[13:26] extract that out of the text that we're
[13:28] going to read to here tonight Daniel 9
[13:31] 1-22 in the first year of darus the son
[13:33] of Asus the seed of the mes which were
[13:36] made King over the realm of the Chans in
[13:39] the first year of his Reign I Daniel
[13:42] understood by books the number of years
[13:46] whereof the word of the Lord came to
[13:47] Jeremiah the prophet that he would
[13:50] accomplish 70 years in the desolations
[13:53] of Jerusalem and I refer to this in my
[13:56] from the pastor's desk concering this
[13:58] time of prayer and fast verse three and
[14:01] I set my face unto the Lord God to seek
[14:04] by prayer and supplication with fasting
[14:08] and sa and ases now bread to us is like
[14:12] the stuff of Life man shall bread alone
[14:15] bread is what we feed on or food and
[14:18] that would give us the energy so when
[14:21] you and I when we make a sacrifice to
[14:23] turn on the putt it means something to
[14:26] God that's how it should be so Daniel
[14:29] said I set my face unto the Lord to seek
[14:31] by prayer and supplication with fasting
[14:34] sa Andes and I prayed on the Lord my God
[14:38] and made my confession and said oh Lord
[14:41] the great and Dreadful God keep the
[14:43] Covenant and mercy keep in the Covenant
[14:45] and mercy to them that love him and to
[14:48] them that keep his Commandments we have
[14:50] sinned not we are fine not we are cool
[14:54] being the bride we have sinned and have
[14:56] committed iniquity have done Wicked
[14:59] and have rebelled even by departing from
[15:02] thy precepts and from thy judgments
[15:04] neither have weened unto thy servants
[15:06] the prophets which speak in thy name to
[15:08] our Kings and our princes and our
[15:10] fathers and to all the people of the
[15:12] land oh Lord righteousness Belong To
[15:14] Thee but unto us confusion of faces as
[15:17] of this day to the men of Judah to the
[15:19] inhabitant of Jerusalem and all Israel
[15:21] that are near that are far off through
[15:24] all the countries whether thou Hast
[15:25] driven them because of their trespass
[15:28] that they have trespass against thee Oh
[15:30] Lord to us belong a confusion of Faith
[15:32] to our Kings to our princes and to our
[15:34] fathers because we have sinned against
[15:37] thee to the Lord Our God being belong
[15:40] mercies and
[15:41] forgiveness though we have rebelled
[15:43] against him neither have we obey the
[15:45] voice of the Lord Our God to walk in his
[15:47] laws which he set before us I servant
[15:49] the prophet yes ye all Israel have
[15:52] transgressed by you even by the pon that
[15:56] they might not obey thy voice there too
[15:59] the curses pour out upon us so Daniel
[16:02] wasn't playing with words and playing
[16:03] games with God he knew what happened and
[16:06] the oat that is written in the law of
[16:08] Moses the servant of God because we have
[16:10] sinned against him and he had confirmed
[16:14] his words which he speak against us and
[16:16] against our judges that judge us by
[16:18] bringing upon us a great evil for under
[16:21] the whole Heaven had not been done has
[16:23] been done upon Jerusalem and it is
[16:26] written in the law of Moses all this
[16:27] evil has come upon us yet yet made we
[16:30] not our prayer before the Lord Our God
[16:33] so when you see disaster evil wickedness
[16:35] things not working out for you it's time
[16:38] to call upon God he said and we obey not
[16:42] his voice verse 15 and now Lord Our God
[16:46] thou has brought thy people forth out of
[16:48] the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and
[16:50] has gotten the renowned at this day we
[16:52] are sinned we have done wickedly oh Lord
[16:55] Accord to all thy righteousness I Bes
[16:57] the let th Ang and thy Fury be turned
[17:00] away from thy City Jerusalem thy Holy
[17:03] Mountain because of our sins and for the
[17:05] iniquities of our fathers Jerusalem and
[17:07] thy people have become a reproach to all
[17:09] that about us oh my God incline thine
[17:12] ear so you can see the fervency in
[17:14] Daniel here he wasn't just praying the
[17:16] regular Road prayer he wasn't just
[17:18] saying back words half tied half dead un
[17:20] tired it was serious because he
[17:23] recognized we are coming to a
[17:25] convergence we come to a junction coming
[17:28] to a whole ch beat whole rhym oh my God
[17:31] incline thine ear and hear open thine
[17:33] eyes and behold our desolations and the
[17:36] situation called by thy name for we do
[17:38] not present our supplication before thee
[17:42] or our righteousness but for thy great
[17:45] mercies oh Lord hear oh Lord forgive oh
[17:47] Lord AR and do defer not for th own sake
[17:50] oh my God but I C like people are called
[17:53] by their name and whilst I was
[17:57] speaking and praying and confessing my
[17:59] sin and the sin of My People Israel and
[18:02] presenting my supplication before the
[18:04] Lord my God for the Holy Mountain of my
[18:07] God ye while I was speaking in prayer
[18:10] even the man Gabriel whom I've seen in a
[18:12] vision at the beginning being caused to
[18:14] fly swiftly touched me about the time of
[18:16] the even oblation and he informed me and
[18:19] talked with me and said oh
[18:21] Daniel I am now come forth to give thee
[18:26] skill and understanding
[18:29] oh blessed be the name of the Lord I've
[18:32] now come forth to give the skill on
[18:34] sensor tonight that we might turn from
[18:37] our iniquities and understand thy truth
[18:41] this is what God want from us a turnning
[18:44] a turning from what we have been doing
[18:47] and our attitudes and so on and to
[18:50] Servant
[18:56] okay Deuteronomy 30
[19:00] 11:14 this is a very great
[19:04] scripture Deuteronomy 13 says for this
[19:07] commandment which I command thee this
[19:10] day it is not hidden from thee neither
[19:13] is it far off it is not in heaven that
[19:17] thou should say who shall go up for us
[19:19] to heaven and bring it unto us that we
[19:21] may hear it and do it neither is it
[19:23] beyond the sea that thou should say who
[19:26] shall go over the sea for us and bring
[19:28] it under to us that we may hear it and
[19:29] do it but the word is very nigh unto
[19:33] thee in thy mouth and in thine heart
[19:35] that thou mayest do it and this year
[19:38] from Deuteronomy 3014 Amplified and the
[19:41] word is very near you in your mouth and
[19:43] your mind and your heart so you can do
[19:46] it I don't know how much you have
[19:49] realized or you're watching the news
[19:52] Iran have sent a set of missiles over to
[19:56] Israel so now you have
[19:59] I don't know sometime ago I talk about
[20:01] the Psalms 83 battle the psalm 83
[20:04] conglomeration and Associates of Jordan
[20:06] and Iran and Iraq and Saudi Arabia and
[20:09] the whole bunch of those Arab Nations
[20:11] around
[20:12] Israel but the flame with Hamas that has
[20:17] just started it's spreading it will
[20:19] spread and always wondered how Russia
[20:21] will get into it well Russia is partners
[20:24] with Iran so that's how Russia foot
[20:28] going to be in this whole thing so
[20:30] friends we could sit here in Trinidad
[20:33] and say this war doesn't concern us
[20:35] Ukraine or Russia uh Israel and what
[20:38] going on there but it would concern us
[20:40] it would affect us and I hope that what
[20:42] we share tonight would would help
[20:45] you but
[20:47] Braham and this something we keep saying
[20:49] over and over so many says if the Lord
[20:52] with take evil spirit from me from
[20:54] drinking or from gambling or from lying
[20:56] or stealing I will Ser him but that's up
[21:00] to you youve got something to do they
[21:04] that overcome shall inherit all things
[21:07] they that overcome you have power to do
[21:09] it but you must be willing to lay it
[21:11] down see she has made herself ready you
[21:15] see God could not push us through a pipe
[21:17] pull us to the other side and then
[21:19] saying blessed he overcome it you had
[21:21] nothing to overcome you just push you
[21:23] through but you have got to make
[21:24] decisions for yourself I have to make
[21:27] decisions for myself doing that we show
[21:30] our faith and respect to God by doing
[21:33] what making decisions whether it's our
[21:36] wife whether it's our husband whether
[21:38] it's our children whether it's our
[21:40] family many times we are caught up in
[21:43] our emotions concerning our families but
[21:46] do you think God is in that emotion with
[21:48] you you think about it once your child
[21:53] is past the age of accountability that
[21:55] child is a
[21:57] solidar that's how God see God don't
[21:59] have grandchildren God not in the
[22:01] emotional frame that we have to let them
[22:03] get away with murder and let them get
[22:05] away with all kind of nasty attitude
[22:06] with no correction with no word coming
[22:09] to them how could things change how
[22:11] could we if we don't rebuke sin if we
[22:14] don't bring things to people knowledge
[22:17] and understanding how do we give them a
[22:19] chance to repent how do we give them a
[22:21] chance to make things right so we have
[22:25] things to do
[22:31] and I believe that God blessed the
[22:33] service on Wednesday and but Kelly s s
[22:36] me a little note and was really
[22:38] something I was speaking and he said
[22:40] went and he was talking about something
[22:43] huge was said near the end on I said
[22:46] when Samson understood what was going on
[22:48] he began to pray and through those
[22:51] suckless eyes tears started to come down
[22:53] and he said once more he could only pray
[22:56] once more because he had it before that
[22:59] is powerful and while it was coming to
[23:03] me to see it I was seeing it at the same
[23:05] time he could only pray once more before
[23:08] he had it before he couldn't pray once
[23:10] more and he never had it and the
[23:13] Dynamics of this church will be
[23:15] refilling of the Holy Ghost that they
[23:17] have worked in a small measure you can't
[23:20] ask for what you don't know about you
[23:22] must give a measure God must give a
[23:25] measure that we can work with are you
[23:27] asking for that measure so so before the
[23:30] dynamic strike before the power strike
[23:32] before all what is Promised third P this
[23:34] that the other he promised a measure
[23:37] that we could work with it come like new
[23:39] heart new spirit his Spirit the new
[23:42] spirit is get along with your neighbor
[23:43] some some people so rotten they come to
[23:45] the Lord yes but snake inside their
[23:47] heart they s down in church for years
[23:49] and you try to understand why are they
[23:51] like that that there's a reason why they
[23:53] are like that they have not yet been
[23:55] converted have not yet been changed so I
[23:58] certainly appreciate that quot that
[24:01] nemiah
[24:05] 81 and this scripture was I'll just read
[24:08] it nemiah 81 and all the people gathered
[24:11] themselves together as one man into the
[24:13] street that was before the water gate
[24:15] and they spake unto Ezra The Scribe to
[24:17] bring the book of the law of Moses which
[24:19] the Lord had commanded to Israel and
[24:21] Ezra the priest brought the law before
[24:23] the congregation of both men and women
[24:25] get this part and all that could here
[24:29] with understanding and he read therefore
[24:32] before the street that was before the
[24:34] water gate from the morning until the
[24:36] midday morning till midday he was
[24:38] reading for them before the men and
[24:40] women and those that could understand in
[24:42] know words God don't want dum dum heads
[24:44] God don't want people foolish and stupid
[24:46] and don't want to understand what going
[24:48] on that the Bible said be wise not fools
[24:51] understanding what the will of the Lord
[24:53] is do you know what the will of the Lord
[24:54] is for you do you know what the will of
[24:57] the Lord is
[24:59] and his program or you caught up in your
[25:01] business or your family concern or you
[25:04] caught up in the cares of life because
[25:06] that is that come to choke you you will
[25:08] be choked you would bring for the fruit
[25:10] if you allow that everybody have cares
[25:12] of Life everybody have challenges of
[25:13] life is here we are to live God put us
[25:16] in a mountain somewhere by ourselves
[25:18] where we don't encounter this and that
[25:20] and the other we have to go to the
[25:21] market we have to go to the grocery we
[25:22] have to pick up children we have to do
[25:24] this we have to do that all of that is
[25:26] normal living but with all of that he
[25:29] want us to have the antenna that
[25:31] actually connected to him all right here
[25:34] this part I want to get to and Ezra The
[25:37] Scribe stood up upon a Pulpit of wood
[25:40] which they had made for that purpose and
[25:43] he call some names and whatnot and Ezra
[25:46] opened the book in the sight of all the
[25:47] people for he was above all the people
[25:49] and when he opened it all the people
[25:51] stood up and Ezra blessed the Lord the
[25:54] great God and all the people answered
[25:56] amen amen lift up their hands and they
[25:59] bow their heads and Worship the Lord
[26:01] with their faces to the ground but
[26:02] there's the part I want to get to and
[26:04] the Levites caus the people to
[26:07] understand the law and the people stood
[26:09] in their place so they read in the book
[26:12] of The Law of God
[26:14] distinctly and give the sense and cause
[26:18] them to understand the reading and
[26:21] that's why we keep saying over and over
[26:22] this message being revealed unfolded or
[26:26] unfolded should make things
[26:28] clearer and plain it shouldn't be more
[26:32] complex write Division and make it
[26:35] complex write the vision and make it
[26:37] mysterious no write the vision and make
[26:39] it plain the issue with Elohim the issue
[26:42] with God is that he was so mysterious he
[26:45] had a challenge how do I get to this
[26:48] people then we accustom with uncle aunt
[26:52] grandmother grandparents and so like
[26:53] that that is at the human level but
[26:55] remember God is not a man so he could
[26:58] only operate within his own laws then I
[27:01] got this from Brother Kelly sou he sent
[27:04] me a note this morning and I felt that I
[27:07] should use that tonight you said good
[27:09] morning brother ID at times I have felt
[27:11] that people don't pray about or for
[27:14] adoption the bride's Revival the line
[27:18] Etc because they feel that their part is
[27:23] simply to live a Christian Life and God
[27:26] will do these things in his time in
[27:29] other words his spirit is picking up the
[27:33] complacency that people have in this
[27:36] message where they do have to pray for
[27:38] adoption they do have to pray for
[27:40] transformation or F virtue they just
[27:43] live a normal Christian Life make some
[27:44] money buy some groceries change your car
[27:47] paint over the house change the roof and
[27:48] so on and you're good to go it's not
[27:50] happening
[27:51] so sorry that happened so but continues
[27:56] because they feel that part is simply to
[27:59] live a Christian Life and God will do
[28:01] these things in his time I have heard
[28:03] this expressed before and it Disturbed
[28:05] me in Reading More on Charles finny I
[28:10] found this powerful thing he said
[28:13] concerning this Frame of mine and I
[28:15] thought I would share it and this is
[28:18] what fin said there are many prophecies
[28:22] yet unfulfilled in the Bible which
[28:25] Christians are bound to understand as as
[28:28] far as they are capable of understanding
[28:30] them and then make them the basis of
[28:35] believing prayer love it in other words
[28:39] your understanding open and then you
[28:41] could go and effectively pray because
[28:43] you're not playing like a dumdum or
[28:44] you're praying like a Catholic or
[28:46] praying for somebody or you want to or
[28:48] on to Mary and you're done with that and
[28:49] you're serving a god like a god of hood
[28:51] or stone but no you have an
[28:53] understanding and that's why I read the
[28:54] scripture D I understood by books what
[28:57] Jeremiah Was talking about and I
[28:59] recognize time is short I recognize time
[29:02] is shaving down right so therefore I
[29:05] will act what he did he sought the Lord
[29:09] with prayer and fasting so let's
[29:12] continue as far as they capable of
[29:14] understanding them and then make them
[29:16] the basis of believe and prayer do not
[29:18] think as some seem to that because a
[29:21] thing is for told in Prophecy it is not
[29:25] necessary to pray for it or that it will
[29:28] come whether Christians pray for it or
[29:30] not there is no truth in this God says
[29:33] in regard to this very class of events
[29:35] which are revealed in Prophecy and he
[29:38] quote Ezekiel 36:37 nevertheless for all
[29:41] these things will I inquire of by the
[29:44] house of Israel to do it for them so
[29:47] brother Brandon said it this way that
[29:50] God wanted us to have a part to play so
[29:53] Jesus told his his disciples he said you
[29:57] pray to the lord of the Harvest that he
[29:59] will send laborers into the Harvest he
[30:02] is the lord of the Harvest but yet he
[30:04] asked them to pray so it almost appears
[30:07] as if on Earth the weapon of warfare of
[30:11] prayer is more powerful than we dare
[30:15] admit or we need to find out the power
[30:19] of prevailing prayer or the power of
[30:22] believing prayer or the power of praying
[30:24] the promise because when Jesus opened
[30:26] the understanding to the scriptures they
[30:28] were commanded to go in the upper room
[30:30] understanding was not enough opening the
[30:33] word was not enough they had what was us
[30:35] to you and on power the so-called
[30:38] executive and glorious teachers in this
[30:40] message want to make the people believe
[30:42] that the teaching is all you need so you
[30:45] get nailed down by teaching and you sit
[30:48] back relax enjoy the ride sit back in
[30:51] complacency but that is not what brother
[30:54] Bram is speaking about here let's
[30:56] continue brother Bram
[30:58] is I'm recognizing message someone said
[31:00] the other day brother
[31:02] R brother Rell a precious brother of
[31:04] mine standing against the wall he
[31:08] says it was discussing in the room the
[31:10] other day brother Rodell was disturbed
[31:13] about the condition of time and the
[31:15] feeling of the spirit in the churches
[31:17] today or begin to drop down ministers
[31:20] coming from everywhere and interviews
[31:23] out here asking what has happened
[31:25] brother B what has happened and brother
[31:27] r ask me the question are they living
[31:30] off the spirit of Satan or what now hear
[31:33] this it answers so many things I said no
[31:38] the suckers live off the strength of the
[31:41] vine it lives because the citrus fruit a
[31:45] lemon will grow in an orange tree but it
[31:47] will not bear oranges though it lives by
[31:50] its life and the church soal only is a
[31:54] grafted sucker living under the same
[31:57] name of religion
[31:58] under the name of the church Catholic
[32:00] Protestant just suckered pulling from
[32:02] the strength of the vine and yet bearing
[32:05] the fruit of what they are because they
[32:08] wasn't converted let's stop right there
[32:11] so let's bring it to home now let's
[32:13] bring it to the church now let's bring
[32:15] it now to explain why it is people still
[32:19] producing their own fruit unchanged and
[32:21] you don't know why they are not
[32:23] converted they're drawing from the
[32:25] church they're drawing from the
[32:26] atmosphere they drawing from specials
[32:28] and singing and everything else they're
[32:30] going to church that's the ritual part
[32:31] of it but there is no transformation
[32:33] whatsoever they are the same person they
[32:35] were 20 years ago 15 years ago 100 years
[32:37] ago they are the same no change they
[32:41] don't want to change they complacent
[32:44] they are satisfied with
[32:47] themselves God have mercy brother bam
[32:50] says they wasn't in the original
[32:53] predestinated plan of God and that's the
[32:56] reason they have to deny the word and
[32:58] bear other kind of fruit the real
[33:01] genuine tree is in its roots was
[33:04] predestinated to bring for oranges on an
[33:06] orange tree Jesus said I am the vine we
[33:08] are the branches and if that tree ever
[33:11] puts forth another Branch it will bear
[33:13] the original Fruit there's got to be a
[33:16] restoration of all these things right at
[33:18] the end of the vine so if you realize
[33:21] that God has called you and you have a
[33:24] higher calling to cry out and call upon
[33:28] God to bear fruit you cannot let
[33:30] grapefruit lemon and whatever else and
[33:33] limes in the church hinder what you are
[33:36] called to do and that is why we have to
[33:39] disconnect from how to say it boy from
[33:43] people that really they're not there to
[33:45] encourage you along they are there to
[33:47] drag you and pull you because they are
[33:49] not in that frame of God and and and and
[33:53] and there's nothing we could do about it
[33:55] and there's a some there's a scripture
[33:56] about a fool you beat a fool is still a
[33:58] fool you can't change that you know so
[34:00] so so we not here to abuse and beat up
[34:03] people and what we want to see is who is
[34:06] willing enough to take this word and die
[34:09] take this word and surrender take this
[34:11] word and allow the word for you to be
[34:13] subjection subject to the word then in
[34:15] that sense butam says he says what um it
[34:20] will come out of the vine not a
[34:22] denomination that's grafted into it but
[34:24] a original production of the word is got
[34:27] to come fort and there will be light in
[34:29] the evening time yeah this bum you see
[34:32] it always have fine print when people
[34:34] say this stuff and you don't get the
[34:36] fine print to understand how do you get
[34:38] there you miss the whole thing it takes
[34:41] light to Ren it and then he said no
[34:43] matter how much you preach whatever you
[34:45] do it cannot be Wren it cannot be
[34:48] manifested it cannot be Vindicated only
[34:50] by him who said I am the light of the
[34:52] world so there has got to come forth a
[34:56] power this is it right here this is what
[34:59] we have to emphasize there's got to
[35:01] comfort a power de holy Strait himself
[35:04] to righten or to vindicate or to prove
[35:08] or to make manifest that what he
[35:10] predicted would happen in this day so
[35:12] here it is we have Cela um heading down
[35:17] into the White House Biden looking to
[35:20] exit right America coming to a
[35:24] junction war in Ukraine and Russia
[35:28] war in the
[35:29] East floods
[35:32] hurricanes things are shaken up and if
[35:36] these things not starting to shake you
[35:37] or get you to understand it is not
[35:40] business as usual but God help us I'm
[35:42] going to
[35:44] close this is astonishing scripture I
[35:46] bouns up here Proverbs
[35:49] 289 he that turn it away his ear from
[35:54] hearing the law even his prayer shall be
[35:58] Abomination so in other words a person
[36:01] who don't want to listen to the word who
[36:04] don't want to hear the word like how
[36:06] Ezra to read it out to them give
[36:08] understanding bring Clarity that person
[36:12] prayer becomes an Abomination the
[36:13] amplifi said he who turns away his ear
[36:16] from hearing the law of God and man even
[36:18] his prayer is an Abomination hateful and
[36:22] revolting to God Proverbs 158 the
[36:26] sacrifice of the wicked is an AB of the
[36:28] Lord but the prayer of the upright is
[36:30] his
[36:33] Delight I close last scripture and we
[36:37] finish Zechariah
[36:39] 7 verse 10 it says and oppress not the
[36:42] Widow nor the fatherless The Stranger
[36:46] nor the poor let none of you imagine
[36:48] evil against his brother in your heart
[36:52] but they refus to Heen and pull away the
[36:55] shoulder and stop their ears that they
[36:58] should not hear ye they have made their
[37:00] hearts as an Adam Stone least they
[37:03] should hear the law and the words which
[37:06] the Lord of hosts had sent in his Spirit
[37:10] by the former prophets therefore came a
[37:12] great wrath from The Lord of host
[37:16] therefore it has come to
[37:18] pass that as he cried and they would not
[37:22] hear so they cried and I would not hear
[37:26] sayeth the Lord of host
[37:28] so the conclusion is this when you
[37:31] refuse to hear the word of the Lord when
[37:34] you want to hear your prayer answered he
[37:38] will not hear you God have
[37:41] feelings God has get
[37:44] F God is get
[37:46] tired that is why God tell Samuel what
[37:49] happened why you still talking about
[37:52] Saul I had enough of him I have found a
[37:57] better man don't waste
[37:58] time I understood somebody shared with
[38:01] me that after the anointing left Saul
[38:04] Saul sat down on that tone for 38 years
[38:07] without the anointing of God we read the
[38:10] scripture about Samson on Wednesday
[38:12] night it is scary Samson didn't even
[38:16] catch that the spirit of God was no
[38:18] longer with him and he was just like any
[38:22] ordinary man wasn't Samson ability it
[38:25] wasn't Samson must and strength it was
[38:28] the spirit of God and as long as we
[38:33] Pummel our way in our own human spirit
[38:36] that going to burn out
[38:37] eventually that will get tired and weary
[38:41] we have to go in the spirit the power is
[38:43] might let us bow our heads heavenly
[38:45] father I thank you tonight I was so
[38:47] excited about sharing this tonight God
[38:50] help us Lord help each son and daughter
[38:53] here to turn from their iniquities
[38:58] but turn in their mind in their Spirit
[39:00] to reject the world and the things of
[39:03] the world and the attraction of the
[39:04] world and all the tensels that the devil
[39:06] have to offer in so many different ways
[39:09] may they see Lord how the enemy trying
[39:12] to get through a back door a window God
[39:15] help us to close all the doors when we
[39:19] leave our homes and houses we want to
[39:21] make sure everything is locked there is
[39:24] no entrance that we we forget to lock
[39:27] and then something is stolen we are
[39:30] robbed we are cheated God help us
[39:33] tonight to search our hearts help us
[39:35] tonight to cry out unto you and break
[39:38] out of Ley and break out of complacency
[39:42] and what amazing what brother Kelly has
[39:45] shared concerning phiney and and talking
[39:48] about prophecy and people not praying
[39:50] and sit back and saying well God will do
[39:52] it but when you prophesy to Abraham that
[39:56] your people will
[39:57] in a Strange Land and for 400 years and
[40:00] a mighty hand he would bring them out
[40:02] but then when that time Came In the
[40:04] Flesh when that time came in fulfillment
[40:07] reality they begin to cry out unto you
[40:11] to send a deliverer and then you came
[40:14] down and said I've heard the cries of my
[40:15] people and I've come down father wake
[40:18] this Israel up wake this elected up wake
[40:22] wake them up Lord because the enemy is
[40:24] at the gate just as is Israel being
[40:28] surrounded and being attacked by
[40:29] missiles so the bride will be attacked
[40:32] by all these thousands and thousands of
[40:34] demons loosed against the BR the battle
[40:37] is about to begin and the prophet taught
[40:39] us that when the supernatural Break
[40:41] Forth then all hell breaks loose right
[40:45] now people clanging sword with coats and
[40:48] argument which is sometime the only
[40:50] weapon they have debate and strife but
[40:54] you want to empower a bride you
[40:56] prophesied that there will be a church
[40:58] with Jesus walk in it you prophesied the
[41:01] shout of the king will be in the camp
[41:03] you prophesied that there will be a
[41:05] church where there will be signs and
[41:06] wonders and miracles that will be across
[41:08] the world you prophesied a Dynamic
[41:11] Church a glorious Church a church that
[41:13] will be a conquering Church undefeated a
[41:16] church that cannot be conquered or
[41:19] walking in the spirit and power of God
[41:21] tell of Fire by Night Cloud by day
[41:24] Jehovah of the old Jesus of the new Lord
[41:27] oh the Lord himself going everywhere
[41:29] with them confirming the word with signs
[41:31] and following oh God tonight I pray
[41:34] father that you heal is sick and our
[41:35] midst I pray father you confirm your
[41:37] word to the lives of your people father
[41:39] I pray tonight be a turning point a
[41:41] junction point oh God in the lives of
[41:44] these children here gathered before you
[41:46] you have no grandchildren you have sons
[41:48] and daughters you don't want them in
[41:49] ignorance you want them walking in the
[41:51] like Moses did what he did and kill a
[41:54] man and ran and he wasn't clear about
[41:56] his calling he wasn't cleared by the
[41:58] pillar of fire and by the direct call of
[42:00] God but when he met that burning bush it
[42:03] transformed him when he met that burning
[42:05] bush something completely changed and
[42:07] radicalized his entire life that he was
[42:09] willing to go back to a place he never
[42:11] thought he would go back before oh Jesus
[42:13] come now and do something special for
[42:15] your people is not what we stop so much
[42:17] is what you have done what you are doing
[42:20] and you are causing us to see by Your
[42:22] Word what we must do we can't sit back
[42:25] and say God take all this evil if God
[42:28] will take out this if God will take out
[42:29] that no we have to press we have to
[42:32] fight we have to wrestle oh God let that
[42:35] fight coming to the people tonight oh
[42:37] God may it be like when the walls are
[42:39] been rebuilt and one had had a sword and
[42:41] the other one had brick and mortar and
[42:43] some were watching and fighting and
[42:44] watching and laying brick let us bring
[42:46] back the foundation let us lay back that
[42:48] wall let us bring back the hedge of
[42:50] protection the hedge of prayer oh God
[42:53] may you inspire your people to get an
[42:55] anchor Point whether it's morning
[42:57] and evening or particular time of the
[42:59] day whether it's lunch time 10 minutes
[43:01] here 10 minutes there but that they will
[43:03] be consistent with it to know that they
[43:05] are talking to the Living God just as we
[43:08] talk to each other just as we talk to
[43:09] our family and friends on the phone on a
[43:11] daily basis we should be talking to you
[43:13] on a daily basis just as we communicate
[43:15] with others on a daily basis we should
[43:17] be communicating with you on a daily
[43:18] basis and hearing from you on a daily
[43:20] basis oh God May the Bible become a read
[43:22] book a fresh book a fresh anointing Lord
[43:25] I've always heard the Bible of come
[43:27] meanings and I'm seeing it so real now
[43:29] how you could take any Scripture and
[43:31] interpret it in someone's lives it might
[43:33] look like it apply to Israel but it
[43:35] could apply to an individual it look
[43:36] like it apply to Abraham but it apply to
[43:38] the brother this or sister this it look
[43:40] like apply to Joseph but it apply to
[43:41] brother this and sister this is your
[43:43] word you have the full coverage of it
[43:46] from alpha to Omega from the beginning
[43:48] to the end it is dear every answer we
[43:51] have need of is in the scriptures oh God
[43:54] may your word become flesh Among Us may
[43:56] we find a whole of you father may your
[43:58] spirit of prayer and supplication strike
[44:00] your people like never before touch the
[44:02] calebs touch those are weary and tired
[44:04] long in the vineyard reward them Father
[44:07] bless them Lord Quicken them Lord May
[44:09] healing virtue flow may your anointing
[44:11] break for in your homes May Revival fire
[44:13] break for in the homes and lives of the
[44:15] people I ask it in Jesus name amen and
[44:17] amen God bless you Saints thanks again
[44:19] for being here I trust that God would
[44:22] inspire you as you get on in prayer in
