just took me to one portion of scripture reading Psalms 85 and verse six Psalms eighty five and verse six somes 8506 will thou not revive us again that thy people may rejoice in thee will thou not revive us again that the thy people may rejoice in thee may the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning amen and certainly on behalf of the pastor this morning I want to certainly wish everyone a wonderful and blessed Christmas season time of family a time of reflection and we understand clearly that historically Jesus was never born on December 25th but we do understand that it is it is also a time when even though the world reflects on that birth within the context of their understanding we also have a deeper understanding of what his birth and his life and his death and his burial and his resurrection means to us so in all our going and all our coming let us not forget the real reason for the season and to keep Jesus at the center of our lives the center of our hearts the center of our affairs you know as we approach this week just for a few announcements there will be no midweek service this week our next service in fact we just have two services left in 2018 so make every effort to make it and also encourage and write someone tell someone last services will be this coming Sunday at 10 a.m. and then Olli as night 10 p.m. into the new year to start 2019 in the house of the Lord and in the presence of the Lord and with believers of like precious faith who traveled this journey not by our own choosing but because he chose us our love for him cannot even compare because he loved us before we could even understand what love was and before we even were aware of ourselves he loved us before and that itself is a blessing amen so I'm not gonna be preaching this morning as we know beloved is in South Africa and they're having a tremendous time a few hours ago actually because they are six hours ahead of us a few hours ago the Sunday morning service but all be preached so we already have it so he's gonna speak to us this Sunday morning and when you appreciate the pastor this morning and I woke up something woke me up at around 3:00 a.m. 4:00 a.m. and I tell myself let me just check what's what's what's turn and as I connected to the service it's fire all over the place and but Obon is there preaching like he's 19 years old you know so I'm at a great expectation for what look what God will do for us today in the tabernacle but I came across this story that I wanted to just share with you and hopefully it will help somebody to old and particularly their young people there are many inspiring stories connected with the writing of our hymns you know we sing so many songs and sometimes you never really understand what happened what letters somebody writing the song Amazing Grace what let's somebody write in a song it is well with my soul or the song that we sing and we sing it you know because we live in it and it but it is real to us but sometime when you look deeper to see what took place I just want to share this with you there are many inspiring stories connected with the writing of our hymns but it would be difficult to find a more unusual one than what happened to William McKee when at the age of seventeen he left his humble Scottish home to attend college his godly mother gave him a Bible in which she wrote his name and a verse of scripture away from home he began well but as time went by he drifted further and further from the way he had been raised he began drinking heavily at a low point to satisfy his thirst for skee he carelessly pawned the Bible his mother had given him many years went by eventually McKay completed medical training and took up his work in a city hospital there one day the Lord met him in a special way I imagine it started out like any other day doing rounds writing reports but in one room he had an encounter that changed everything it was a sad case the patient was nearing the end no hope for him bring me the book he cried I need my book and the words seemed to echo in the flinty soul of dr. McKie a while later he was told a fellow had died and the doctor went back to the room curious to find out what book have been so precious that holding it once more had been a dying man's greatest desire soon his search uncovered a Bible but not just any Bible there inside the front cover in his mother's hand was his own name William Hutton McKee it had been many years since he had seen it but there could be no mistake someone had reclaimed the Bible from that pawn shop and it had become a priceless treasure to a dying man McKay went to his office and closed the door he opened the Bible slowly turning the Warren and weddin weather pages many contain specially marked verses his mother hoped he would read he was alone in that room for many hours but when he emerged a long night of sin had been blasted away by the life-changing light of heaven with a newly tender heart and a desire to reclaim wasted years he resigned his place at the hospital after training he went on to serve the Lord as a pastor and it was William McKee who wrote the song hallelu I'm the glory mist and hallelujah ha the glory revive us one more time [Music] ah [Music] look breathe for the last time [Music] ah by the glory refined Oh and coming in a lot of praise Amen so brother Nicholas at this time let's switch over to Bernoulli's message in South Africa middle Lord bless you I know you will be blessed amen praise God praise God can you give the low they had a trace penalties rights to all feet let's just wish a live this morning for the opportunity of this resurrection only to come and worship Him to come and praise Him hallelujah Alleluia praise God isn't it wonderful to be a Christian to be in the message of the hour brother there's a light of this day hallelujah that's where the faith is Lane and brother that's a faith you am writing you it might be as small as a mustard seed but there's enough power in that faith that's able to change your body it's able to hear you it's able to raise you up into another sphere this morning so I come this morning I'm not tired hallelujah I come from my blessing I come to conquer I come to receive let's surf be the name of the Lord so do you feel that way this morning just turn around shake someone's hand say God bless you welcome to house of the Lord [Music] [Music] where is this wonderful name by my mama what a joy the shot of the key is in the camp my whipping press will be best with the best weed in place hallelujah god bless you you may be seated at this time so we just want to greet you all again in the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ man I feel so anointed I feel so excited I felt old but I'm not old anymore brother that noise you know gorgeous comes upon you and the old bones it's a to begin to ache you know more because we in the presence of Almighty God and that's why we shouted that's why we jump and that's why we praise the name of the Lord Buddha you know the devil a seat when you worship you want you to sit there all quiet all day but when you get up in worship it shakes the devil brother and that's what we come to do in this meetings to show the people who shine we are amen and that's how I feel brother Pam said one time there was a man he was deaf he couldn't hear the services the preaching but he'll come to every meeting and sit in the front and and a brother this man will serve and worship and jump and they said but how can you appreciate the services when you can't even hear and through some sign language they asked him and he answered back he says I come to the house of God to show the paranormal siren and we are yeah it broke the brother to say that devil inside we are so I'm not gonna suspect we have to praise God we are to worship email and you watch when you worship Him

tremendous and we're looking for a great time in the Lord this morning amen so appreciate the messages being spoken or what I shall faint time-tested a time-tested feet and also for a Jessie's message a manifestation of the original feet so this morning wanna go straight to the word we want to stand if you want to go to Ephesians chapter 4 wanna read from verse 4 to 13 1 a good Jew chapter 1 want to verse three unsaid march up the sixteen we wanna read from verse fifteen to twenty readin Ephesians four reading from verse 4 there is one body and one spirit even as here call in one hope of your calling one Lord one faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in your but under every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ wherefore he saith when he ascended on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men know that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first a little or possibly that he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above heaven that he might fill all things and he gives some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists have some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come into the unity of the face of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ we would add Jude Jude 1:3 beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you want to exhort you that you should then thusly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints are we go to st. mark 16 reading from verse 15 and he said of the demin go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he does believe in his baptized shall be saved either the V but not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tall they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them confirming the word with signs following amen may God bless his holy word you may be seated so this morning I have a title unity of the original faith restored by Malachi 4 that's my title this morning unity of the original field restored by Malachi 4 and I will thought contending for the original feet defeat and I believe in my heart and I'm looking forward for it that there is going to be a unity of disease that's what the Bible said that the five four minutes are gonna be here until we all come into the unity of the faith so all the issues in the message we're supposed to be sorted out by another Ephesians and Merritt Ephesians was to bring us all on the same page because when the country Ephesians we come to the Lord one faith one baptism it has nothing to do with interpretation doctrine and Ben's idea is going to be one more it will be one be seated brainstorm Loreena borderland so what about of an adoption he's talking about sons and he's talking about the right kind of a son not just sons they're all kind it have a backslidden sons Rena his sons disobedient sons rebellion sons all sounds what adoption is the right kind of cells not the right sermon the right kind of songs he is not adopting the sermon he's end up in the man he's got a pup in the position he said nothing the man you know you have to find the man but he adopt be then you may be seated my mom says no on the gang when the Sun is a Tucson I'm Sol and God bless him and try them and I'm going with the settlement visionary said it's no secret we all see it when a man feels that God loves him he takes him out somewhere to himself I've been the front of angels here's something for him he listened out in the presence of God and gives him and fills them and Satsuma that is the H the aluminum marina God Alleluia praise God so in 1906 the Pentecostal revival Saturn and 30 years later it was spinach 1956 an angel the stop left option season to stop their pops on edge when you can set up sun's gone sense Vincennes and make that sense I'm seminar you want to see him sent 1946 with the turn of the angel of the Lord it must seem that of a new function of time and Chloe okay ever seen a new thymus you see them you are not this is the primary this is the many seasons hallelujah glory to God I am NOT in South Africa I'm a hidden places this is where we measure Kingman not attached [Applause] in the kingdom gospel preached and the gospel is not our promise member abbien expectations with it say Mary Stuart I said the Midlands but sit beside a Methodist but many custom is not shittin in order the coming of the Lord Jesus will be so powerful that Patti will come as a disciple church the rest of them from the baby there will be an election schibetta banner 1954 he said so tonight I'm somebody like this one I mean yes we are living in a time of the restoration of the gifts it's fundamentally design churches it's the Nazarene it makes the Pentecostals but just the same God is Romanian listen imminent the rapture and faithful research when athene what that's right so tonight listen I represent that Senate the faith that was once delivered to the scenes and the real of a divine gift this is very important human decision he was saying tonight I represent that village by way of the gift what he's doing here he said the gift is demonstrating and showing something represent interference but the faith is common because the factor only come by the breaking of the seasons if we stop activate or in a cocktail visual what they had it's not a Vietnam it is d hate we want to emphasize that part original one not dependent on one another how naughty ones that are worn and on the TV I know not that that is not original original is alpha additional revenue I said so okay pouring of God you may be seated and this rate is the papacy of this regional this fate is based upon forgiveness so what we ask them this edge here is a bubble on the top so let's analyze that is like what miss you and I and we have challenged you we are challenged because we have to come what is this or get the Lord our show [Applause] Moby's easy but abandon the ABCs work number than a restaurant and he saw this woman and he began to condemn and say Lord is that's the kind of place might jog on the raise up in and so on like that and God tap it on his shoulder put him aside give him a vision showing when he was more his sins coming up to God and the blood of Jesus like a bumper bouncing at all and they I can't God will forgive me but Kappa merciful death fulness and God said I forgive you and you condemn her so he himself has to be built into the kindness into the spirit of forgiveness it's not just saying I forgive you it's a spirit it's an amazing it's a fish here there's something I have to be real Jesus a Miss Mary because they're dependent charity let me see a we have five feet to pull down the capstone if we have to leave it in the rapture we have to put on the cap because charity never faileth [Music] [Music] even Jesus even Jesus manifested it Jesus this is Flip Wilson now make at least one forgiveness go glory to God I think is it a message for the ground Bambi's PowerSchool mom says rapture and fate will only be revealed to those who forgive their brothers [Applause] [Applause] I'm too late we'll only be revealed the donors who forgive their brothers or more in a lot you may be sneaky hallelujah hallelujah and you know what the purpose of the church is below when the church finest decency that the church raises this entice the other members of the body towellette cent can rejoice - yes baby no come on rejoice because the King asked us it has been restored and clearly went all and once that feel to restore you're going to begin to see a unity of the face you will see the pressure to get the car together or chlorine argon you may be seated or glory to God a unity of the face so I say this may Charlie one man show is over years ago we went to a leave but a repeat of my remember dad's your into Nigeria and there was a guy in a hotel he's calling charlie one-man show he sat there he had something in his head yet an organ here he had a kid I hear you got something else here I miss playing this I'm blowing this unclean this call it Charlie one-man show do you have all different an instrument all around him and he alone doing everything all glory that day is over it hablo saudi one-man show Paul has given grace but every kid that finds a place no one man have to fight for ministry there my man you can cut your small to put your - in one man this omnipotent a museum all-powerful and it is pastors teachers evangelists prophets TV the season the Spirit of God is not something it can't be fooled into you the spirit can't be fooled into you so all this teacher can teach dispirited to you he said that there's something that has predestinated into you by the hand of Almighty God your experiences cannot be schooled or taught into you it is predestinated not a better Branham walk into the house of God Luke I am making love in the church Holy Spirit drop down whatever you see whatever you see whatever you see if someone going absentee death of century core technology options so that I come against you and the Lord Justin what do you see you see why poor doin a bit more because it's right now we are saying the wrong thing what differences he said I forgive you [Applause] no no no we can't even cuz I can attest because it'd be for children people on one time with the tool which is we can't even get that kind of test without even death upon swelling women test to come inside the church because you're not dressed right oh she's a sinner [Applause] [Applause] we may be seated when we lust for knowledge it's a sin to do so it's a strong statement this from a message Seaton Seaton but a brand now someone's treated this message in lust for knowledge but the Bible prophesied that their people in last have itching ears you want to know is elitist mystery that they could understand and Christ is the mystery of God revealed I have written preached so much stuff and I'm not saying nothing about the life stuff is because poorab Adam said and I thought the court yet he said the mysteries was revealed that we can see the plainness of God I know how to behave ourselves in the present day that we live in now the mysteries are not received information saved it's revealed that we can see the blameless of God and know how to behave so turn back to our behavior that God must approve so Purim says the thing of it today we don't try to establish the Word of God in the people's heart we tried to establish ourselves or churches that trying to establish the doctrine of the church and the person whose heart we are commanded to establish the Word of God you may be seated Paul said I could Paul I didn't come to you with enticing words of man that you have faith my dress under knowledge of the man I come to you in power and manifestations of holy course that your faith might rest in God so Paul was careful that the people not impressed with his knowledge information and revelation as a person having confidence in the power that got to museum Colin do you get abused that man of God and team - Johan and - given your spirit and see your soon by the power of Almighty God Alleluia and the word is the conductor of the Spirit so perhaps might repair to a soul and the spirit of Florida will complete the voice he said establish the Word of God take all the unbelief and SW the king of God in on my heart and the kingdom

what we do for God will always last and we want to do all that we can do while we can do it you know there will come a time but the random told us that there'll be no more services there are no more preaching one day the Bible will be closed for the last time the last song will be sung so they're coming this distance closes coming friends this time is coming to an end so while they're still breath ins trying to do all we can do for the kingdom lettuce and never to do all that we can do so may the Lord richly bless you once again have a wonderful blessed Christmas have a wonderful time with your families and christmas is a time of a lot of food and different things be careful be careful don't let you know I was thinking in the back and say you are a temple of the Holy Ghost you know put that temple under too much pressure where too much time and too much chicken and too much you know but do have a wonderful Christmas and as you spend your time make sure that you keep Jesus at the center of it all it's cent of your homes and of your family you know over the years many people lost that prayer also and even if you have to make the altar by yourself make your pre-order if you could make it with your family beautiful make the prayer automatic family but keep Jesus the reason for the season I look back over the years and we face 2019 I remember being in secondary school and back then we will look in towards the year 2000 y2k and teenagers don't even know where that is now but back then we didn't know what was going to happen and I used to tell my school friends I don't think we're gonna make it past 2000 wrapped come and was it form one form to form tree I was preaching then the rap tears come in and to see how time has unfolded I'm but a random tortoise he said plan as if he's coming in 20 years but live as if he's coming tomorrow you know so as we come to 2019 many of us in the message never thought we'd see 2019 and we don't know how much time is left but we do know that time is short so we want to be conscious friends to do all that we can do for his kingdom and that Great Commission that Borobudur is reaching about that Jesus said to go into all the world and this gospel must be preached as a witness before the end could come so we're looking for the end but before the end could come this gospel will be preached and the preaching of the gospel is not in word only but it is empower it is in demonstration it is in signs it is in wonders it is in your behavior being change that when you look out you recognize hey the person I was in 2018 I'm not that person anymore so may the Lord richly bless you and me you have a blessed week see you on Sunday Lord willing and I know last night remember the Anthony [Music] the 11 today praise the Lord all
