often amen so we will be in a word tonight amen and the best we can we know that God will do the rest if we can only get started amen please God I have a title tonight amen once more Lord amen that's my title my inspiration is wild samson was born a man that's my inspiration praise God hallelujah one small own and I mean it to be as a inspiration tonight praise God we know that it's a sad situation when we go back in the Bible and we see what Samson went through amen and how he was deceived a man how he had given his heart to a woman a man he gave his strength to God but he gave his heart to a woman and he fell by that way is not right and he had to go through persecution and trial and he had to go through a lot of stuff he even lost his two eyes isn't that right praise God hallelujah but when the Bible wrote Samson's account it said by faith Samson overcame the Philistine praise God hallelujah even in his in his trial court still got the victory even in his darkest hour in his most brutal hour it was caught finest hour hallelujah praise gone doesn't matter what you are going through tonight praise God he might be going to a trial might be going through a test might be going to a shadow time holiday but that's courts finest hour that's when he shows himself alive by many infallible proofs and he is caught Almighty but he will not give up on his promise Oh hallelujah hold to God's unchanging hand God is able tonight to restore to baptize to sear oh he is caught tonight he can do whatever he wants to he can steal if he wants to he can deliver if he wants to praise Cory merry men hallelujah amen amen hallelujah so we know there's many conditions around tonight many circumstances and each one of us here tonight have something to pray for each one of us here tonight have someone to pray for we have a condition to pray for there's many conditions in the church where our God is able to deliver us from them all I know my core disabled he's a God of Abraham he's a car of Joseph he's a car of Moses he's a quorum Malachi for profit he's took caught up this church here tonight and we praise the living car that is who we come to see tonight we come to see him and not another we are not satisfied with the blessings of yesterday the Prophet said you know the blessings of God but you don't know the power of God we want to see his power tonight once more Lord oh yeah pour out your spirit tonight and pop ties everyone amen so tonight we take this title here as an inspiration to our hearts it ought to be an inspiration to every one of us he man to cry out before gone once more Lord if he did it once before he could do it again if he did it for pizza he could do it for you tonight just have faith in God hallelujah if he did it once before he could do it again it's 9:00 but Isaac said it on Sunday what a powerful message a man salvation Redemption adoption perfection email holiday appreciate it tonight hey man god bless him tonight amen and such a message and in that message you were seeing him in the beginning part there you would say this not taking us stranger God could do it again pretty knock a man hallelujah a walk with God I was not isn't that right he was a type of the church and he was raptured to preach the true church and he was raptured and if God could do that there he'll do it again for a let cool hallelujah Amen tiny lady there be a rapture to the church or thinking not strange I could do it ha lonely there will be a bride that she will not see text or but she be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye hallelujah hallelujah Oh glory glory glory glory glory isn't that right so that's how we could cry one small on hallelujah because God is able to do it Harlan is no strange King hallelujah Adam praise going on it wasn't a perfect condition you could call for the mountains call to the lakes you could speak whatever you wanted to that's the condition of the church it's going back to that's the condition rather the bride is going back to the true church the true bride but true believer hallelujah it's pressing with all that is within us to strive to enter in to that place to her place to your place of adoption to your place of perfection that Court has for you in this last hallelujah hallelujah because there's a place for us and in that place we have authority in that place we can speak to the enemy Halloween night praise God somehow we pray for the sick and they get healed sometimes the prophets say they may get delivered sometimes but when that time comes we commander temples get out of here pray Scotty man sons of God of come back in authority to take back their rightful place hallelujah hallelujah I'm in the kingdom of God some apostles some prophets some evangelists to take their rightful place Oh hallelujah to see the Philistines go to backing up whoa tonight I'm excited to see the Philistines put the packing up all those travels not giving us trouble not giving us worries not given us mind baffles one of these days you're gonna crush those serpents under your feet tonight Oh Paolina Church to kick the devil out to kick Satan out to kicks it out to kick hallelujah everything that belongs to the devil Oh glory to God hallelujah oh mighty mighty mighty mighty hallelujah glory glory glory glory one smaller hello yeah hallelujah that if he's in church was a church walking in power just walking in a clorium car signs wonders and miracles following holiday is nice Palestine has been called on in that church there's an an assets of fire in that church once more law God's gonna part his spirits it'll be another church just as glorious as that one unless she's gonna comfort in the last days God promised is now right freeze corny man so one small or that's what Samson three something a lot of stuff that he wasn't proud of but this wasn't a time for that because the Philistines were having their glory hallelujah and he wasn't weeping and wailing no no no he was looking after looking at the unseen hallelujah praise God look into a promise holler if he kept the Covenant holla holla cord had to keep his part of the bargain of the agreements Oh night whoa hallelujah anytime may time profit reaches message once more Lord and just once more it's now right I'm typing the church he typed Sampson as a church at fella wing is now right she went there she was in her glory and we know that Sampson come forward he was keeping the Covenant all the time is now and under that praise God our agreement praise God he will rotate miracles isn't he what type of Keith of Gaza and went with it isn't a post and all the Bible said hi pick up the whole thing the whole thing hallelujah praise God is not well and I'm Keith I was keeping the devil behind closed bars behind seat behind those walls praise God will raise up a mantle rip those keys out and cause reason upper Church in his last name to take the key to the enemy hallelujah high speed how the heat of his enemy that's a prophecy and he loved Samson a Son of God raised up for such a time as this to possess the very case that God spoke with his own prep hallelujah that he would possess pour raise up a man to do exactly what God said hallelujah isn't that right and the Prophet prophets had many things about this bride she would have touched it a lot and keep still she will have his potentials she will do his word only God is going to raise up another people in the land we're gonna speak hallelujah with a forty and power and pick up those promises encouragement from Sunday amen let us go on to perfection let us go on to adoption praise God amen hallelujah prophet said knowing God died for sins knowing that he's done this knowing he's done that that's wonderful but let us go on to perfection let us call to adoption let us go on to possess the land that we know is our own someone else land we talking about this is your land we talking about Oh have we caught an interest tonight in what belongs to us the Holy Ghost belongs to us so I belongs to us this belongs to us glory amen amen amen hallelujah hallelujah the devil's job all this fire was to bring unbelief so that you would tout the word since you could touch your promises because it spy these promises that we can become partakers of his divine nature what the devil do in the beginning he attack the word well it's not when we pull them we shall eat of every tree but none of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil he said you shall not surely die right there he talked the word and got ease confidence holily broken in the world it's not right so if you ever line up with the word tonight line up with the pure Word of God not what a man thinks not what a man speaks but what course speaks cause every man was a lie and let bath ports would be true and tonight you can ask whatever you will and it shall be given unto you be a ton unto me according to type whoa whoa hallelujah praise Cory money man Oh glory glory glory glory glory going hallelujah amen amen hallelujah amen Brees gone just for a few wood boards before we get into prayer tonight that's how we gonna come into prayer tonight and confidence in God's Word and God's ability to do what he said that's what makes him core tonight the fact that he could speak it and he could keep his promise is what makes him car it makes him different from anyone else hallelujah in one day we have a thought the Bible said in that parody all thoughts perish but we caught his thoughts I eternal so then whatever he's thinking it's eternal but when that thought comes into expression you can't go back to being a fault anymore it's already come out then something's got to take place when that expression becomes a word when it is spoken the miraculous has got to take place because it's already spoken it's already been released God cannot take it back every word that he has spoken shall come to pass hallelujah that's how he operates [Music] children [Music] glory glory glory hallelujah so what he was a man Samson might was a powerful figure did some really glorious stuff but in the midst of all of that he was messing around Bible say with a woman we know as Delilah is now a man a man we know that behind the scenes and she might have looked pretty she might have looked gorgeous but behind the scenes the enemy was using her to try to capture Samson that's a problem many things we find nice and look good and all that glitters is not gold because the devil sometimes uses that stuff to try to get to you to try to cut you off Harlan is not build your hopes on things eternal tonight and hold to God's unchanging hand hallelujah sometimes you gotta get rid of some stuff because the enemy might be using that stuff to try to get to you praise God hallelujah it's night leave a little while and it turns from a weed into a thorn in time this'll never suddenly becomes our bread patch and the next thing you know you're standing in Temari hallelujah standing and pick up where it's going to come see your way out honey because you let that thing grow Halle is 9 a man my dad here tonight my dad is a green thumb a man I'm not a farmer I'm not a plant man I don't profess to be but I'd see him get up every morning and he can't start weeding the plants and washing doing water and he told me he said if there's a day I don't do that the next day I come there's gonna be some little sprouts coming up here and if the next day I don't do it they're gonna get bigger and they're gonna get bigger until all of a sudden my lawn is gonna overgrown with some stuff that I didn't plant here that I don't want here so a man he's telling me it's a daily choice that he is making a conscious effort to read the area to make sure it's clean Halle is nice and he said it's just like prayer you got to pray every day you got to see the Lord every day you're gonna make a conscious effort you gotta make a choice every day to maintain your portion to maintain your Lots pull out the weeds because if you don't they'll grow over you they also come here pray scrawny man a man model said I die daily Oh how's my daily coming daily going on to the Lord holy and every day getting stronger and stronger and stronger Oh hallelujah hallelujah what are you doing like a prophets name when the butter like comes inside you because I expand its expand then what happens you said you got to pull some trash out you gotta make room now for this light inside of you to begin to expand and expand and expand because the more things you put out it's a more room you kill for God to grow inside of you you come on less of the world and more like Jesus more like Jesus and less of the world until all of a sudden one day you'll wake up and realize that God is in you Oh Halle one day you'll wake up and realize that the devil is a little bit smaller today than he was yesterday you realize a trial that situation that circumstance it's past smaller today and it was yesterday how because greater is He that is in you tonight than he that is in overall greater than your trial greater than your situation greater than your circumstance Oh is all caught tonight keep the Lord shut up ray oh my you may you may so Samson was messing around tell her lie this way and she bound him and did what he said now you see all of that I still continue don't get rude it's now I didn't start right away those little games little infantile things but it began to grow into something begin to get more and more treacherous and the Philistines on the back end was kept trying to get Delilah so what is the secret you've got to find a secret is now a hallelujah amen amen hallelujah prophesied to church give away a secret well isn't that right a holy life a consecrated life a dedication to God he's giving up the secret is now Oh hallelujah is all right amen Pop's that the church God in such a condition praise God honey almost have a look like the world rests like the world like the world pre-scored we're gonna talk like them holidays see things like they would say pre-scored not being mindful or conscious of his presence while practicing his presence is there a breeze Bobby gets O'Connor and they get so fleshy amen amen and it don't invite the Holy Spirit of God into your life a man you've got to see the right thing oh honey when you talk about him then he comes closer to you anytime you're gonna talk about Jesus just watch that spirit come down anytime beginning to share the world hallelujah with your brother with your sister we're gonna testify what's that electricity supernatural presence we get the spark we can take nights however you can just share a word for word what upon the word holiday and anointing comes hotter because the wood is gone and when you speak his word its presence that's why its presence is here tonight because we're standing on the world not on a man's torch not on a man's ideas not on a man's opinion not getting mixed up hallelujah and Carl things hallo everybody sing on that word and believing as he promised man holla isn't that right according to his promises isn't that right hallelujah the Prophet said you man that of the hope baptism of Holy Ghost on how a man ought to be born again by the Spirit of God today scarcely anything is said about that well but that's the most important parts hallelujah you've got to receive your bird colony you've got to receive your ninety one small Lord is our cry tonight just the same painting that Peter receives and that Mary receives and that John and Phillip and the rest of them you've got to receive your same portion tonight you've got to receive your own lake of fire hallelujah hallelujah it's not good enough to not succumb to church you've got to receive the choke on the life hallelujah the same penny because Peter same price tonight Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah it's not just believing that ever believe and tremble we will say when you believe you receive it no no that's not a problem after you come to the world after you you it might happen at the altar but your shoes holy water caught up bad people oh I've come down to deliver I've come on to restore I've come down to see you that simple of fires got to come inside of you tonight hallelujah hallelujah that simple of fire it's promised a common 12 in your heart in your life in your soul in your spirits that's what we come for tonight that is why we cry one smaller fire no that's why when Ananias and Sapphira come in the church lion telling lies he said you have not lied to me but you have lied to the Holy Ghost where was the Holy Ghost was it on top was it I know it was inside they said you didn't lie to me you lied to the Holy Ghost and right there they died hallelujah they pay the price called hallelujah wanted to keep this church clean hallelujah and that same anointing is coming back again hallelujah normal on the outside but they had switched over from the natural to the spiritual one of these days we are gonna switch over from the National to the spiritual you better have to talk on to recognize that card is speaking to you all the punchline it'll be so simple try buying a man is I mean many times people don't realize when the profit or a suit over he was speaking and they took it to my maybe as idle words but God was speaking writing them it's a humble profit come in the Presidency good evening friends we're gonna share the word who was it God filled in a man like never before chorus filled in a man and called what one more be feeling a pride oh how people like never was before since there was a nation called a reason for people holla holla on to his name a man they were happy at the Lord or keep still oh my my my

church grinding at the mill hallelujah but we've got a promise tonight while Samson was palm while Samson was in this condition another shock of hair crowd Oh hallelujah praise hallelujah isn't that right hallelujah while Sampson was in this condition another shocking hit ground hallelujah is now it's time to go back he started to remember the days of his glory he's time to remember how we felt the presence of God and tonight doesn't matter what condition you I am just begin to remember just we're gonna reach back tonight to your hidden power I'm you're gonna feel those locks growing back again or tonight there's a group tonight or holiday port is getting ready mcpot is getting ready to fill to seal to anoint those blocks are gonna grow back one more time oh seven steps to perfection what's gonna raise a church he's gonna rebuild the church by the power of the Spirit great strength and one of the miracles in a secret and all the time the Philistines see Samson it's finished it's wiped out the hero of the of the of the Israelite now me praise God has been taken down hallelujah preview don't worry about him no more praise go we don't have to grovel over him no more praise God he's all of a threat to us but in that condition and let God let that happen so that he could see what was in Samson so that what was truly in Samson could begin to pip its way back out again and God let a lot of things happen in the natural let a lot of things happen in your life in your family life in your circumstance in a situation in your trial in your storm could allow a lot of things that
