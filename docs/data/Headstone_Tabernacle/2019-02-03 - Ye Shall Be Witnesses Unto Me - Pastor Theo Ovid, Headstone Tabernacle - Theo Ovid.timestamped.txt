[55:48] wanted to know by bus the matchup
[55:50] defines sin John chapter one and Acts
[55:54] chapter 1 for scripture reading this
[55:56] morning
[56:05] we will mark five reading from verse 25
[56:10] on a certain woman which had an issue of
[56:13] blood twelve years had suffered many
[56:15] things of many physicians who spent all
[56:18] that she had and was nothing bettered
[56:21] but rather grew with when she had heard
[56:24] of Jesus came in the press behind and
[56:27] touched His garment for she said if I
[56:30] may touch but his clothes I shall behold
[56:33] and straightway the function of a blood
[56:36] was dried up and she felt in her body
[56:39] that she was healed of that plague and
[56:43] Jesus immediately knowing in himself
[56:46] that virtue had gone out of him turn him
[56:51] about in the press and said who touched
[56:54] my clothes and his disciples said unto
[56:57] Him those years the multitude thronging
[57:00] thee and says thou who touch me and he
[57:03] looked around about to see her that had
[57:06] done this thing and the woman fearing
[57:09] and trembling knowing what was done in
[57:12] her came and fell down before him and
[57:14] told him all the truth he said unto her
[57:18] daughter thy faith hath made thee whole
[57:21] go in peace and be whole of thy plague
[57:26] Saint John one we informed with eleven
[57:29] to fourteen he came unto his own and his
[57:34] own received him not but as many as
[57:37] received him to them gave he power to
[57:40] become the sons of God even to them that
[57:43] believe on his name which were born not
[57:46] of blood nor of the will of the flesh
[57:48] nor of the will of man but of God and
[57:51] the Word was made flesh and dwelt among
[57:53] us and we beheld his glory the glory as
[57:56] of the only begotten of the Father full
[57:58] of grace and truth
[58:00] on our last Scripture one verse was acts
[58:03] 1:8 familias scripture and ye shall
[58:07] receive power after the Holy Ghost has
[58:09] come upon you
[58:10] and he shall be witnesses unto me both
[58:13] in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in
[58:16] Samaria and to the uttermost part of the
[58:18] earth may God bless his word we may be
[58:20] seated
[58:21] praise the name of the Lord o blessed be
[58:24] the name of the Lord as we said on
[58:26] Wednesday night in going forward a once
[58:29] I'm preaching I'll be making reference
[58:31] to Azusa Street and some pointers of
[58:35] Azusa Street revival revival that took
[58:37] place in 1906 where the Holy Spirit God
[58:40] came down enough powerful way and what I
[58:43] didn't even realize that the brother
[58:45] Seymour he prophesied that there were
[58:48] going to be another revival it will be
[58:50] about a hundred years from now because
[58:53] I've revival has died out and then go
[58:55] send a prophet messenger because he
[58:57] needed that atmosphere for the Prophet
[58:59] messenger to come into it
[59:00] so 1906 by 1946 rival dead gone the
[59:06] angel of the Lord appeared unto brother
[59:07] Branham and give him a message to bring
[59:10] to a Gentile bride that is how you got
[59:13] called out because a Pentecostal was
[59:16] like shocked and brother Branham brought
[59:18] the word which was the seed so he we
[59:21] have a message what by a 20th century
[59:24] prophet and the message itself is dost
[59:26] see at the Lord
[59:28] the message itself is not word only the
[59:31] message itself is not teaching only it
[59:33] is not information only on books only
[59:35] that's what we have had for 4050 years
[59:38] the message is a little more than that
[59:41] my title tonight is ye shall be
[59:44] witnesses unto me that is Jesus words to
[59:48] his disciples ye shall be witnesses unto
[59:50] me and I have an inspiration virtual
[59:55] powerful service were cheap awful our
[59:58] witness is to see something experienced
[1:00:02] something to be there
[1:00:04] a person who is present say a car it
[1:00:08] cannot be a here see you have to be here
[1:00:11] to be a genuine witness and Jesus he's
[1:00:16] totally disciples you shall receive
[1:00:18] power after the Holy Ghost has come upon
[1:00:20] you and you shall be witnesses unto me
[1:00:24] not your own witness your witness and
[1:00:28] Christ hallelujah you are going to
[1:00:31] represent Christ you are going to see
[1:00:34] Christ and I realize this is the problem
[1:00:36] with many people today the burden is not
[1:00:39] Christ it's a selfish thing it's about
[1:00:43] you is about your story is about how you
[1:00:45] feel and how you think is not about the
[1:00:48] Lord but you are promised to become a
[1:00:51] true witness I witness unto Jesus and
[1:00:56] that is why when Pizza healed a man he
[1:00:59] said you think by my power this man is
[1:01:01] made whole but in the name of Jesus it's
[1:01:05] not me it's Jesus so Peter was bearing
[1:01:08] witness of Jesus and as Jesus reflect
[1:01:11] God you shall reflect Christ as Jesus
[1:01:16] reflects and reveal God you can reveal
[1:01:19] Jesus Christ because Christ is the
[1:01:22] mystery of God revealed
[1:01:26] halleluja is going to be priced in new
[1:01:30] amen praise the name of the Lord please
[1:01:33] God
[1:01:34] so pride and selfishness and I was given
[1:01:37] a thing that was in permitting that
[1:01:39] Seymour who started this revival as user
[1:01:42] Street revival is a Negro man and he had
[1:01:46] he was half blind so a one-eyed man and
[1:01:49] God called him the first church he went
[1:01:52] to was a kind of radical Church the
[1:01:55] church had black and whites worship him
[1:01:56] and in those times at a segregation
[1:01:58] White's here blacks here so he went to a
[1:02:01] church that didn't believe in that was a
[1:02:03] white pasta but he did not believe in
[1:02:05] segregation so therefore he was there
[1:02:08] for a while he went to another Church
[1:02:10] and this church no preaching and
[1:02:11] teaching the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:13] but that preacher white preacher he
[1:02:16] believed in segregation so he believed
[1:02:19] that black and white not supposed to be
[1:02:20] together but Seymour was a humble man
[1:02:23] and he wanted to hear what to beat what
[1:02:27] is being taught about the baptism only
[1:02:29] goes so he was contented to be sitting
[1:02:32] on outside the church separated from the
[1:02:35] congregation to listen from outside what
[1:02:38] the man was teaching hallelujah glory to
[1:02:41] God and he learned something from the
[1:02:44] both sides once I was preaching unity
[1:02:46] when he went back to them they don't
[1:02:48] believe any button will use but they
[1:02:51] believe in unity this I don't believe
[1:02:53] energy but additionally baptism labels
[1:02:56] so he was able to draw from both sides
[1:02:59] and come down the middle with unity and
[1:03:03] power of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:07] to activate a revival that we still
[1:03:12] feeling the effects of chlorine over
[1:03:16] because Mandan started revival is
[1:03:19] thought study reliable
[1:03:21] Alleluia the fire of the Holy Ghost was
[1:03:25] so hot over the roof people were seeing
[1:03:29] fire they were calling fire services to
[1:03:33] oak the fire that was on top that
[1:03:35] building or brewery record but it wasn't
[1:03:38] a natural fire it was a Holy Ghost fire
[1:03:41] and I am believing that same Holy Ghost
[1:03:45] that same fire but come W oh hang over
[1:03:51] the building come over you or give the
[1:03:55] Lord a show

[1:04:07] separate and selfish the spirit cannot
[1:04:11] come
[1:04:12] hallelujah what would happen if we come
[1:04:17] to a unity of defeat
[1:04:20] hallelujah what would happen if the
[1:04:24] walls of partition is broken down and
[1:04:27] people begin to see themselves as
[1:04:29] brethren sons of God
[1:04:34] sons of the kingdom a kingdom that
[1:04:38] cannot be moved hallelujah what a power
[1:04:44] is gonna be a man were either God but a
[1:04:49] Branham was talking about what we need
[1:04:51] to do is some fire in the boiler you

[1:21:56] we Samuel 18 and even behave himself
[1:21:59] wisely in all his ways and the Lord was
[1:22:05] with him
[1:22:07] wherefore when so sure that he behaved
[1:22:10] himself very wisely he was afraid of
[1:22:13] them there was no food they were already
[1:22:25] anointed David I want you to be king so
[1:22:29] wholly on a temporary position on that
[1:22:32] seat there's only a Matta
[1:22:37] [Applause]
[1:22:44] but his shower AC power
[1:22:46] [Applause]
[1:22:59] therefore when Saul saw that he behaved
[1:23:02] himself very wisely he was afraid of him
[1:23:05] but all Israel and Judah loved David
[1:23:08] because he went out and came in before
[1:23:10] him before them oh praise God bless may
[1:23:13] God bless this world Oh hallelujah
[1:23:16] hallelujah so let's continue verbum says
[1:23:20] from a rising listen no matter how much
[1:23:22] the halogens clean oh well you got your
[1:23:24] church set how much education you got
[1:23:27] how much the Bible until that wave sheaf
[1:23:30] until the Holy Spirit comes upon that
[1:23:34] person to quicken the word the gasoline
[1:23:38] represents the word it's the truth but
[1:23:41] without the Spirit
[1:23:42] it won't move we have put too much
[1:23:46] stress on the mechanics and nothing on
[1:23:49] the dynamic it needs the dynamic power
[1:23:53] of God the resurrection power of Jesus
[1:23:56] Christ upon the church to manifest and
[1:24:00] bring to pass that is gasoline so
[1:24:02] regardless how people are taught how
[1:24:04] much mysteries they are taught how much
[1:24:07] revelations they are taught it needs
[1:24:09] that fire
[1:24:10] it needs the power to know if it is
[1:24:13] gasoline because if it is water you
[1:24:16] scratch how much on top I decided early
[1:24:17] much Auto
[1:24:19] [Music]
[1:24:21] it may be in a gasoline can but daddy -
[1:24:24] whoo - Selena the can outside my
[1:24:28] gasoline putting tape I'm printing
[1:24:31] gasoline stickers they make a gasolina
[1:24:35] playing box I'm playing careful making
[1:24:38] gasoline oh no laughter I read acid in
[1:24:41] on the inside
[1:24:47] so Amanda Lepore carries apostle or coal
[1:24:50] carries a pasta or coal carries
[1:24:51] evangelist that make me mentally let me
[1:24:54] stick on the outside there's a child a
[1:24:57] spirit gonna to vindicate it that is
[1:25:00] ready that so the previous gasoline at
[1:25:04] already met and when their chocolate it
[1:25:06] was gasoline boom you're here explosion
[1:25:10] you're gonna see fire if it's gasoline
[1:25:14] it is like a silly people just sit and
[1:25:16] steer old order your favorite even
[1:25:18] gasoline upon you and that might hit you
[1:25:22] you have to do something but these are
[1:25:26] hundre go up at least had my shake a
[1:25:29] little bit
[1:25:34] even even if you stiff neck the whole
[1:25:37] bloody night Musel but something I mean
[1:25:44] listen one time there was buried a dead
[1:25:47] man and he has some rubbers and vendors
[1:25:50] coming and he lies a grave I was there
[1:25:53] and they chopped the dead man denies any
[1:25:55] mental math alike on because it was
[1:25:58] written in Paulo not that power that was
[1:26:01] gasoline gasoline gasoline then I might
[1:26:13] come back to life equipment power that's
[1:26:16] what you're here for tonight till we see
[1:26:18] power
[1:26:20] oh poor little dead within a scripture
[1:26:24] he came unto his own and his own
[1:26:27] received him not
[1:26:27] they rejected him but as many as
[1:26:30] received him as many you know every
[1:26:34] right as many as we see them to them to
[1:26:39] them to those people see their power
[1:26:43] [Applause]
[1:26:50] to become the sons of God
[1:26:54] but to become backslidden not to be
[1:26:57] defeated but to be songs of God how have
[1:27:04] you received them have you received the
[1:27:07] way then power is promised the Spirit is
[1:27:11] promised to you who are received Christ
[1:27:14] the wind
[1:27:16] let's have receive the word first all
[1:27:19] glory that God Alleluia so much so this
[1:27:23] church is emphasizing the dynamics if
[1:27:29] anybody are so worried doing so we
[1:27:31] emphasizing dynamics tell them we have
[1:27:35] 50 years of mechanics and we think we we
[1:27:38] ready no for dynamics tell them the rims
[1:27:41] polish this decal looking good tell us
[1:27:46] they were first paint job but the engine
[1:27:50] we wanted started
[1:27:52] [Applause]
[1:27:55] and when he got to do that

[1:33:35] moved him but oh Jesus to do the things
[1:33:38] that he did if he hit on 16 cylinders so
[1:33:43] in the bright for he said and syndra 14
[1:33:48] 12 he that believeth on me the works
[1:33:50] that I do shall do also I will give him
[1:33:53] a charge of my dynamics in his mechanics
[1:33:56] that is the interpretation of that
[1:33:59] scripture let me read it again die not a
[1:34:04] text I exhort on he oblivion me loose I
[1:34:07] do also no believe in means this and me

[1:37:56] 14:12 he that believeth on me the works
[1:37:58] that I do shall you also
[1:37:59] I'll give him a charge on my dynamics in
[1:38:02] his mechanics that the world will not be
[1:38:06] able to withstand it Jesus gives and
[1:38:13] greater works than these shall you do
[1:38:15] that's the Easter message the mechanics
[1:38:18] and dynamics together the mechanics with
[1:38:20] all dynamics no good
[1:38:22] neide a mix with all the mechanics no
[1:38:24] good it has to come together you can
[1:38:28] scream and shout and jump up and down
[1:38:30] all you want and unite this world no
[1:38:32] good you just cranking around the

[1:38:38] but there's no gasoline so the mechanics
[1:38:42] for gasoline in your bottle for gasoline
[1:38:46] in your system these are the secret is
[1:38:48] the word or the gasoline is in the right
[1:38:53] hallelujah there come the dynamics which
[1:38:56] is the stock which is the fire which is

[1:45:59] his church that is what holding about
[1:46:02] the coming of Christ known and the great
[1:46:04] millennium is this great supernatural
[1:46:09] power that readily is dormant in the
[1:46:13] church he is seeing the mysteries are
[1:46:17] revealed what for was the purpose to say
[1:46:21] we have mysteries or attrition to have
[1:46:23] as much missiles we have plenty
[1:46:25] mysteries tons of it no that's not the
[1:46:28] purpose
[1:46:29] no is to get activated this great
[1:46:34] supernatural power that's why what about
[1:46:36] him says the mission of the seven
[1:46:38] thunders he say exists a mystery that
[1:46:39] will bring back a power into the church
[1:46:42] will we leap and run over walls not miss
[1:46:46] it at all and say well we talk I'm a
[1:46:48] famous no no no is this the mystery
[1:46:50] doctor bring back come on sunken power
[1:46:54] bring not a bra
[1:46:56] into the tricks Wow laughter come into
[1:46:59] the church so after the mysteries we
[1:47:05] have to see that mystery connecting to
[1:47:08] power not poverty reveal more mysteries
[1:47:10] so help me God people stuck in some time
[1:47:13] walk mystery board is a mystery only
[1:47:17] still wrapped up in mechanics it's a
[1:47:20] mystery and they don't want to leave a
[1:47:22] general because we see we see when Jesus
[1:47:24] came he made these fantasies with the
[1:47:27] mysteries of the Old Testament and and
[1:47:29] they had long had tall hats long beards
[1:47:33] nice guns no books no signs of wonders
[1:47:36] no miracles or nothing so when Jesus
[1:47:38] come on Jesus either just blast them he
[1:47:41] see you by default cut he's only looking
[1:47:46] keen on Sarah like didn't Boone's onions
[1:47:47] oh he busted them and sudden manifest
[1:47:53] what they hated him because he was
[1:47:55] showing them up they say we are Moses
[1:47:58] children our fathers eat manna in the
[1:48:02] wilderness he son everyone dead he said
[1:48:04] mood for Moses what I am moisés on my
[1:48:07] day and so forth it was a side of you
[1:48:09] who he was the people who was Scripture
[1:48:13] in the world you rejected him and those
[1:48:16] sinners like pita fisherman Kozma much
[1:48:20] you all them guys tax collector these
[1:48:22] are the kinds of receive Jesus because
[1:48:25] their name was a nut book you can't be a
[1:48:28] Christian really unless Lord in you to
[1:48:31] be
[1:48:33] that's why you in charge this morning
[1:48:35] consider the privilege and honor to get
[1:48:38] the opportunity just hear this word
[1:48:43] [Applause]
[1:48:49] [Music]

[1:49:18] he's following you
[1:49:21] he follows you he knows every move you
[1:49:25] make and everything you do he is longing
[1:49:31] to hear you call him on the scene of
[1:49:36] course sittin job is to make sure your

[1:50:05] you have no real guidance and leadership
[1:50:07] and so on picture in the corner there
[1:50:10] and you find yourself suffering all
[1:50:12] alone it doesn't have to be
[1:50:15] that is why you nimona people that's why
[1:50:19] in a group where you can get the help
[1:50:21] and support and the encouragement and in
[1:50:24] nutrient and his shrink them this one

[1:50:31] hearing words there's a community that
[1:50:34] is here there's a family that is here
[1:50:36] there's a blood flow of these in the
[1:50:39] same blood is the blood of Jesus

[1:51:25] you are not okay speaking distance with
[1:51:27] him don't you have done wrong sinned
[1:51:31] turn our backs on him don't things we
[1:51:34] ought not to do yet he is with us Christ
[1:51:38] said he is we will be with us isn't it
[1:51:42] strange that God wants the people to
[1:51:44] have a pattern to it when Jesus look
[1:51:46] upon the harvest he said the harvest is
[1:51:48] right the laborers are few
[1:51:50] you pray the lord of the harvest look
[1:51:54] the vision we talked about burner Brown
[1:51:55] 12 year old girl she was the day that
[1:51:57] very day the Lord tucked the prophet and
[1:52:00] tell him pray for her that that doesn't
[1:52:02] happen
[1:52:03] so God couldn't stop it because I was
[1:52:05] destiny that was what was supposed to
[1:52:08] happen but if a prophet tree if somebody
[1:52:11] pray you could flip it
[1:52:16] so I could now see how prophesies could
[1:52:19] feel the clock there could be a prophecy
[1:52:22] against your life you could have won
[1:52:24] more retailers but God because I prayer
[1:52:27] God flip that over and time filled that
[1:52:33] assignment whatever assignment on your
[1:52:37] life prayer could come and cancel that
[1:52:40] prayer to change the mind of God or go
[1:52:44] in a God if you read a cancer in this
[1:52:47] morning you can have it you will even
[1:52:53] know the forces of that is an evil that
[1:52:56] coming your way and it traps and snares
[1:52:58] that's it and set up and you don't even
[1:53:01] know the reinforcement that got about to
[1:53:03] put on you because this coming we gonna
[1:53:06] be are at challenging week and God given
[1:53:09] special on shell and inspiration that
[1:53:11] you can face your weakness command the
[1:53:17] new come here and Ricky Ricky Ricky come

[1:53:20] [Applause]
[1:53:28] so they're like a real soldier ma'am
[1:53:31] I'll not not not put the peeling
[1:53:33] potatoes in him Bakunin but going on the
[1:53:36] battlefield
[1:53:37] hallelujah isn't it strange that God
[1:53:40] wants the people to have patented when
[1:53:42] to use look upon the harvest he said
[1:53:43] harvest is right the laborers are few
[1:53:45] you pray the lord of the harvest that
[1:53:47] was him you pray to me that I will send
[1:53:51] laborers into my harvest it is some part
[1:53:54] you have to do this thing about prayer
[1:53:58] is not just saying prayers is to connect
[1:54:02] the preen in such a way that you have a
[1:54:05] prayer life a prayer life is different
[1:54:09] from prayers or seeing prayers
[1:54:13] let me see it again a prayer life is
[1:54:15] different from seeing prayer a prayer
[1:54:18] life is a life of prayer you don't eat
[1:54:23] breakfast once a week so how are you
[1:54:25] pretty once a week the living with
[1:54:29] breakfast lunch and dinner
[1:54:32] he may ease up on the breakfast if add

[1:54:41] your crush their muddy dinner you see
[1:54:44] them real hard so what I'm saying is

[2:15:51] God goddess Wheaton Diarra
[2:15:55] to see his church come to that position
[2:15:58] regardless of the elimination regardless
[2:16:01] of creed color whatever it may be that
[2:16:04] his entire church will come to the place
[2:16:06] that they are displaying the total of
[2:16:08] the death of Jesus Christ you see it a
[2:16:11] little nice the top doctrine talk
[2:16:12] because we could argue because we do
[2:16:15] believe the same thing I found a quote
[2:16:17] bouncer we will never agree on the same
[2:16:19] thing until Jesus come or something like
[2:16:21] that did so it's not a matter green same
[2:16:23] thing somebody like sprite somebody like
[2:16:25] clips on my like big red and some I like
[2:16:28] orange and somebody drinking switching
[2:16:30] at all the apple juice and marry
[2:16:35] somebody don't know juice they want hot
[2:16:37] tea I favor a joy about coffee
[2:16:45] so that's about ten different things we
[2:16:47] called it and people have different
[2:16:49] choices they want this the one that God
[2:16:52] give you that right to be the pizza was
[2:16:54] a daring guy Laurie that you bid me to
[2:16:56] come much he wasn't like that
[2:17:00] James wasn't like that I'm brother again
[2:17:02] I fight boy not like that number you see
[2:17:04] Peter
[2:17:07] but you know when ignited his trial they
[2:17:10] possess a I had I don't know that
[2:17:11] monitor so be careful who you want to be
[2:17:15] like it
[2:17:17] what's be careful because SAT for peter
[2:17:21] Yarrow because they go honey maternal
[2:17:22] gotta take him in nine guys to and
[2:17:24] crying and unconcerned until I take all
[2:17:27] a tune so the object is the purpose of
[2:17:36] God and the objective of God but a
[2:17:40] family said from Genesis to Revelation
[2:17:42] the whole mind
[2:17:44] that is for the world to become like is
[2:17:51] the objective word to become flesh and
[2:17:55] the word become flesh as God he said the
[2:17:59] one was invisible until it became flesh
[2:18:03] so you're careless seek God until it
[2:18:10] become flesh then that God becomes
[2:18:12] active because we have a place a room a
[2:18:17] house he can operate in
[2:18:21] bye and true or go in a guard say it go
[2:18:26] take up you as his host he could speak

[2:20:57] certain order good
[2:21:00] but they're known as the spirit holy
[2:21:03] spirit the canopy of life the token
[2:21:09] hidden hallelujah hallelujah we're going
[2:21:14] abroad who else could be challenged
[2:21:18] depth without the token with the token
[2:21:21] you could challenge that itself because

[2:33:55] delivered from your own fight hallelujah
[2:33:59] so traditions make the word of none
[2:34:03] effect the world no longer hardly struck
[2:34:06] upon the people because they was doing
[2:34:08] it like ritual you see and go don't like
[2:34:11] rituals because with our ritual your
[2:34:14] heart is not in it you do it because it
[2:34:17] has to be done it's like a task it's
[2:34:20] like a job you do it because you are
[2:34:22] asked you do it because you are told but
[2:34:25] there's no love in it it's just like
[2:34:30] husband and wife if there's no love
[2:34:32] there is just you know keeping a house
[2:34:34] it's no longer really a home it's just a
[2:34:38] house and people just talk your wife
[2:34:42] make the meal you merely make with no
[2:34:44] love in it so the muties are certainly
[2:34:46] it is - loves whoever the dust is it is
[2:34:53] - love in the mirror loving it Andy
[2:34:55] Rooney bhaji and rice or Bajoran bread
[2:34:58] it is good because they all it up and
[2:35:02] that meal was prepared with loving it so
[2:35:04] when you put love between the two slices
[2:35:06] of bread with some tomatoes in it it do
[2:35:09] like it's a Buddha because it's our love
[2:35:12] between them two slices you put some
[2:35:15] ketchup and some pepper and some garlic
[2:35:17] sauce on that ah you never believe you
[2:35:21] have known bitten silently why because
[2:35:27] it happy love inside of it and this is
[2:35:30] how it's supposed to be with you and
[2:35:31] Christ
[2:35:32] in your life in your walk it's supposed
[2:35:36] to have loving it and when I would love
[2:35:38] for the Lord if God said no instead of
[2:35:40] loving it
[2:35:40] they put some extra check they put some
[2:35:42] spice you put some praises you put some
[2:35:45] worship you put sometimes given and they
[2:35:47] say Lord you know best because that is
[2:35:54] wrong you sure you love God by
[2:35:57] conducting yourself with joy and mister
[2:35:59] trials he in his wisdom sends your way
[2:36:03] so you are blessed you are blessed Davis
[2:36:08] a man or go do service runner to handle
[2:36:18] please what about an oxygen no let us
[2:36:28] all serve the question is not something
[2:36:31] like today as bad as we have to see it
[2:36:35] we have got to face facts somewhere
[2:36:37] there is something wrong he said why
[2:36:41] this church ought to be a million miles
[2:36:44] of the road to wait is known Jesus is
[2:36:48] waiting on his church to get ready his
[2:36:50] bride has made herself ready listen to
[2:36:53] this wisdom we we have got the
[2:36:55] potentials the Holy Spirit is here God
[2:36:59] is here the power to heal the sick the
[2:37:03] power to do all these things that Christ
[2:37:04] did I have seen it demonstrated myself
[2:37:07] by the Holy Spirit so the potentials are
[2:37:10] here so that is why the Prophet said
[2:37:12] what we see manifested temporarily will
[2:37:15] be manifested in the fullness when the
[2:37:18] press come down so he saw by
[2:37:21] manifestation the power that will be
[2:37:25] hallelujah and God demonstrated to the
[2:37:28] Prophet by speaking to the storm Mike
[2:37:29] speaking for his wife's tumor heal and
[2:37:31] creation over the elements he
[2:37:33] demonstrated orders and say all of this
[2:37:35] package is for the bride
[2:37:37] but if comment down the road because he
[2:37:41] expect my down the road all the
[2:37:43] character will be in us he expect down
[2:37:45] the road will be like Jesus so it won't
[2:37:48] be abusing one another and the holiday
[2:37:50] will be living like Christ and giving

[2:51:41] judge a man by his motive and objective
[2:51:43] what he's trying to achieve and then if

[2:51:47] thing you can work with that man because
[2:51:50] his objective is right oh yeah he may
[2:51:52] have his lips and slide along the way

[3:04:05] to you
[3:04:06] oh my so I'm gonna skip quickly
[3:04:10] something but if I'm talking about the
[3:04:12] beasts and any time the devil put up our
[3:04:15] white horse red horse dealers cores
[3:04:17] release a power also to come back to the
[3:04:19] enemy so when God so the first
[3:04:21] Antichrist was riding with a teaching
[3:04:23] was teaching his writing with the God
[3:04:25] sent the teaching of the word the Lion
[3:04:29] of the tribe of Judah which is the word
[3:04:33] made manifest by the Holy Spirit that is
[3:04:37] what God news to compact what the devil
[3:04:39] had to offer he lose what the word made
[3:04:43] manifest by the Holy Spirit that was the
[3:04:46] Lion of Judah oh praise God thank you
[3:04:49] Jesus in the scripture hallelujah so
[3:04:52] remember he keeps his blessings and he
[3:04:54] keep his kisses every promise God keeps
[3:04:56] you have to choose which one you want
[3:04:58] his blessings by believing or his
[3:05:01] cousins by polluting it if you pervert
[3:05:05] it and believe the perversion side of it
[3:05:07] you're cursed if you believe it no way
[3:05:10] he wrote it and hold on to it then you
[3:05:11] are blessed
[3:05:12] oh my hallelujah praise God brother BAM
[3:05:18] said this no he said we find out in
[3:05:21] Revelation 3 there's to be treat your
[3:05:23] changes in this age did you know that he
[3:05:25] said then he talked about elements to
[3:05:27] his three elements justification some
[3:05:29] vacation a Holy Ghost and he cost three
[3:05:31] messengers the common in the last time
[3:05:34] now we find out that the rain listen the
[3:05:37] Holy Spirit being poured out in the last
[3:05:39] days you believe is to be poured out
[3:05:40] upon what upon what somebody is sowing
[3:05:44] seeds to bring forth his latter-day crop
[3:05:46] so the Holy Spirit is the fall upon what
[3:05:49] upon seeds I will restore see at the
[3:05:52] Lord what will I do I will bring her
[3:05:54] back to her own regional condition
[3:05:56] listen carefully I will bring her back
[3:05:58] to her original doctrine I will bring
[3:06:00] her back to original Word I will break
[3:06:02] every dimension to pieces I will bring
[3:06:04] her back to my word so maybe I better
[3:06:06] shut up boy stop I will bring her up and
[3:06:08] when you get away from the world you got
[3:06:11] away from God you got away from the
[3:06:13] principles you got away from the Holy
[3:06:14] Spirit
[3:06:15] you got it from everything the devil
[3:06:17] will give you something false but it
[3:06:19] will never be a record of it so any time
[3:06:21] people get off the word devil dared to
[3:06:23] give them something false all praising
[3:06:25] of the Lord the Bible is to be finished
[3:06:27] the Gentile dispensation is to be
[3:06:29] finished with the church age when this
[3:06:31] anointed messenger arrives of course he
[3:06:34] will plant the seed of the entire Bible
[3:06:35] from from the serpent to the messenger
[3:06:37] of the former rain so butter Branham
[3:06:39] came to plant the seed of the entire
[3:06:41] Bible and the Bible is in three levels
[3:06:44] the zodiac the pyramid and this physical
[3:06:46] Bible so he came to plant the Bible
[3:06:49] which is the pyramid inside of you and
[3:06:51] today you have a pyramid inside of you
[3:06:55] which is the seed of the entire Bible
[3:06:57] the secret the word in the brain so all
[3:07:02] these mysteries all these unfallen of
[3:07:04] the word is the Bible sealed inside of
[3:07:07] you the mystery of God come built from
[3:07:10] God as the word of God and that is what
[3:07:12] is taught and preached and that is what
[3:07:14] inside of you or glory to God so listen
[3:07:17] I believe that Christ has a church and
[3:07:19] the church is the field we are getting
[3:07:22] to it and you have got to get the word
[3:07:24] in the field before the Spirit can do
[3:07:26] anything so all these years
[3:07:29] girl was getting the word into the field
[3:07:31] you had a field and the word is the
[3:07:34] conduct of the Spirit save God or later
[3:07:36] on the plumbing and the less wire the
[3:07:39] current can flow to it so all these
[3:07:41] years God was watering up the church and
[3:07:43] God is about to pull along the breaker
[3:07:47] hallelujah because the inspector when
[3:07:50] you buy a house you have that inspector
[3:07:52] ha ha ha man expect the house if the
[3:07:54] inspector doing slightly hose the hose
[3:07:56] get man down
[3:07:56] especially now if they have a false
[3:07:58] electrician or unless you son that
[3:08:00] didn't get a certificate or some kind of
[3:08:02] bogus or half watching HSN he come
[3:08:05] across the wires and make it wrong then
[3:08:07] you flip this thing so paps post bond on
[3:08:10] hallelujah
[3:08:11] so there are inspector to inspect the
[3:08:13] wiring or glory to God then they get
[3:08:16] approval to get connection to resource
[3:08:20] to the power source or blow in a bed so
[3:08:26] when the inspector come down I look down
[3:08:28] and see all the wires in order we ready
[3:08:30] for connection I feel today we're ready
[3:08:34] for connection forward to connect you to
[3:08:36] the sauce Oh

[3:08:42] finished this I'm gonna wrap up I
[3:08:44] know you're hungry

[3:40:41] direction and the inspiration of the
[3:40:43] hour so service at 3:00 p.m. so we
[3:40:46] encourage you to stay back for that
[3:40:49] service it will not be the Lord's Supper
[3:40:51] we will have an excitation UMaine as we
[3:40:54] continue to press towards the prize

[3:41:05] every effort to be here and if you can't
[3:41:07] be sure to connect to the service on the
[3:41:11] livestream and this coming Friday we
[3:41:14] will have a prayer meeting again here at
[3:41:15] the Tabernacle so we under great
[3:41:18] expectation for that we had a tremendous
[3:41:21] time on Friday for those who were here
[3:41:23] the Holy Ghost was all over their
[3:41:25] building what a tremendous time we had
[3:41:28] and Wednesday night was also really
[3:41:29] really powerful so we Tang God for what
[3:41:31] he's doing in this season certainly want
[3:41:34] to take this time to salute all the
[3:41:36] technical team that's been working
[3:41:39] behind the scenes summer were here for
[3:41:40] about 12 hours or sold 1012 hours
[3:41:43] yesterday doing some work behind the
[3:41:44] scenes and we have a vision of
[3:41:47] perfection vision because God wants
[3:41:50] things done a certain way and as we
[3:41:53] endeavor along that path of learning and
[3:41:56] growth and of setting them before growth
[3:41:58] always comes at the price or the cost of
[3:42:02] being uncomfortable
[3:42:04] you have to be prepared for discomfort
[3:42:07] for you to go away you've not gone
[3:42:09] before most of us it's comfortable to
[3:42:12] stay in your comfort zone that's why
[3:42:13] it's called your comfort zone but if you
[3:42:15] want anything more than you have now you
[3:42:17] have to be prepared to be uncomfortable
[3:42:19] you have to be prepared to do more than
[3:42:22] you've done before and as we're over
[3:42:24] we're speaking about Azusa Street see
[3:42:26] more than the five hours that's that's
[3:42:30] the sacrifice that doesn't come easy
[3:42:32] seven hours of praying every day that's
[3:42:34] that sacrifice that's effort things have
[3:42:37] to move around to make time to to spend
[3:42:40] that quality time with God so there's a
[3:42:42] cost as a price and with everything we
[3:42:44] do with the musicians with the technical
[3:42:46] team with the live-streaming with
[3:42:48] different aspects of it and we certainly
[3:42:49] tango out for that and we really
[3:42:51] appreciate we have been getting some
[3:42:52] tremendous help from our brothers at
[3:42:55] connects with us assembly so we really
[3:42:56] appreciate their support and their
[3:42:58] blessing and better
[3:42:59] Timmy de Allen but a good show member
[3:43:02] Acadian and the brothers over there
[3:43:06] lending of their hearts on their
[3:43:08] fellowship to be with us to really you
[3:43:10] know continue to fight for this great
[3:43:13] body there's only one body friends and
[3:43:15] by one spirit we are baptized into that
[3:43:17] one body and when we get over there and
[3:43:19] be one bribe one body canach it's a man
[3:43:23] so we love what God is doing and will
[3:43:26] continue to serve him with our all with
[3:43:28] our everything with our breath with our
[3:43:30] lives that our strength with our
[3:43:31] substance to do all that we can do while
[3:43:34] we can do it because there'll come a
[3:43:36] time when we won't be able to do
[3:43:38] anything there come a time we will have
[3:43:40] no more church services we become a time
[3:43:42] we will not be able to gather like this
[3:43:43] but while we can gather like this wanna
[3:43:45] put two hundred five hundred seven
[3:43:48] hundred percent not even a hundred
[3:43:49] percent you want to put your all into it
[3:43:51] knowing that you are investing in
[3:43:53] eternity you are investing in the
[3:43:55] eternal things that can never pass a
[3:43:57] week and the church say Amen
[3:43:59] maintenance team group three please meet
[3:44:02] with brother Andy Henry after the second
[3:44:04] service and just a reminder about the
[3:44:07] fellowship you tree treats Carnival
[3:44:10] Monday Tuesday that our period there
[3:44:13] from the Sunday before Carnival actually
[3:44:16] right there Sunday Monday Tuesday marrow
[3:44:20] we've already made announcements about
[3:44:23] it but just to remind you that it is
[3:44:25] used oriented but all are welcome and
[3:44:27] we're gonna have a service on Monday
[3:44:28] night you'll have a service on Tuesday
[3:44:30] morning we will have some activities
[3:44:33] some Bible quizzes some different
[3:44:35] studies those activities for the young
[3:44:37] people and stuff so we can get closer to
[3:44:39] God and get closer to one another
[3:44:41] it's better if it was speaking talked
[3:44:43] about this this family of God this this
[3:44:46] family that comes together every Sunday
[3:44:49] and in the week to grow together to
[3:44:51] learn together to sharpen iron sharpens
[3:44:55] iron as the Bible says and to manifest
[3:44:57] like you said the virtue of this age of
[3:44:59] forgiveness somebody has to mash your
[3:45:01] corn so you want to create as many corn
[3:45:04] mashing opportunities as possible so you
[3:45:06] can effectively manifest the virtue of
[3:45:09] the each you know so trials testing
[3:45:11] situations must come to allow you to
[3:45:14] forgive and you can't have the
[3:45:16] opportunity forgive if you lock yourself
[3:45:17] in a room and nobody ever interacts with
[3:45:19] you so God created this unique situation
[3:45:21] for us to come together and bring our
[3:45:24] different personalities and backgrounds
[3:45:26] under the headship of the Holy Spirit
[3:45:28] and under that headship that headship is
[3:45:30] the benchmark for measuring how we grow
[3:45:33] and how we mature until we all come into
[3:45:35] the unity of their feet until we all
[3:45:37] come into the measure of the stature of
[3:45:39] the fullness of Christ can the church
[3:45:40] say Amen hallelujah so we would also
[3:45:44] like to encourage you if you are
[3:45:45] participating in this special retreat
[3:45:49] for your people we like very much if you
[3:45:51] can start to make your contributions
[3:45:52] from the D to the sisters below to
[3:45:55] downstairs one hundred and fifty dollars
[3:45:57] as a contribution towards this by no
[3:45:59] means is this
[3:46:02] contribution or all-inclusive cost is
[3:46:04] really a contribution it really will
[3:46:06] cost more than this to be able to put
[3:46:07] this together so beyond this course we
[3:46:10] certainly want to appreciate those who
[3:46:11] would contribute food items and their
[3:46:13] leo and their time and their substance
[3:46:15] to ensure that this is a success and
[3:46:17] there for some reason you have not put
[3:46:18] your name down just yet please do so we
[3:46:23] really want to you know spend this
[3:46:25] quality time strengthening one another
[3:46:27] as we approach the coming of the Lord so
[3:46:32] may the Lord richly bless you looking
[3:46:35] for some great continuation of what God
[3:46:38] has planned for us so stay on fire stay
