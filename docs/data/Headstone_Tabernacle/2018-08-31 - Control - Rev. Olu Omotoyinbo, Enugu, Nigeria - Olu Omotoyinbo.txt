main so I want to switch over to our colleague testimonies because I know today in the evening the prayer meeting and it just to give let you know that God is still in action praise God may we have an idea doctor is he performed what is called an incredible surgery in California sometimes either last year this year he discovered a problem with a foetus the fruit juice is just a baby dusty developing in the womb and he was able to bring out this baby of president this baby switcher buck this baby and put the baby back again in the mother's womb for his scotum a human you may not know what I'm talking about an inspired him and then I own doctor have confidence he himself that he would do this surgery and every two of you arise so his total is one of the one of the wanna make all a great news in medicine that the baby was put back again in the mother's womb as the healing was taking place in the mother the healing was taking place in the baby seven days the sutures were removed the stitches remain removed and the mother here the baby healed [Applause] and what took place was that the woman had gone ahead to deliver this baby that was a vindication that if serger was right but we have dr. Jesus you know it was so fascinating that you were clapping for this great thing this young man has done but what he did was he operated on what was a life now let's talk about the doctor that our press on what is dead and then brings it back to life only doctor Jesus can do that he's done it before he still doing it and he will still do it again oh let's give the Lord a clap of praise hallelujah delivery secret please go to Maine and we know their scriptures Jesus gave us I said greater greater things than these shall you do because I go to my father and the Malachi first said that we can not do something greater than what Christ has done rather more of it will be done that is the interpretation do you believe that so we are going to see more of what Jesus has done we cannot do more of what he never had done and we cannot do greater things of what he had never had done but all that he had done the same we should do more and more shall we do ray is gonna make he here the sick amen and we can see his T healing the sick and we are seeing more and more and more of them he raised the date Prince Karimi and we are going to see more and more and more ovation of the day praise God amen hallelujah amen so I want to read this to you but I'm going to compress it this is a testimony the brother came to me on the great excitement and he said I was not here last year his brother Stephen here s why this is a minister so see a deacon praise God I mean you were here last year it was no here last year but a Stevens pastor is brought a Filipino sinking when he gave me this testimony already true and I took my time out a bit to sit with his pastor you know to cross-check this and I want to tell you that what I have here and I want to tell you is confirmed as truth it was from the mouth of two or three let it quickly establish I also have evidences from their hospitals the x-rays and the report from the doctors also here praise God Amane so it can be verified we also have another testimony of the similitude which was mentioned along the way by our brother Paul on a July when he was preaching yesterday and he made a reference of the one that was testified from brother of Roger base church and I feel I would like before I read this to cover the for debate to really come and tell us this testimony you can hear from the from the horse's mouth praise God MA and I want to say sister comfort of Korea are you here Laurie oh please you will know more about this sister god bless you brother Isaac just in a nutshell tell us what God has done out in a week god bless you I want to give a testimony to the glory of God we have read in the Bible that God can heal God can raise the dead and we saw that up with the Ministry of Branham what is better history Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and so happens the comfort is here herself as I give this testimony again this was a second of August in 2017 that was last year on a Wednesday and recording happens so fast second foot she came to my house herself but I noticed that she was not under myself and the way the team was going in the way she was talking I could really make out what what was really happening it he said I didn't take it very serious but at a point I noticed that the system was just going like that going like that as she was talking test that is no more in this world so I was confused now I don't know what to what actually was happening and I spoke with how we prayed I try to send her out and the next thing she did was she came back she kept back a Westray to the judge and she entered the church the church premises she fell down flat inside the church the church compound I was screaming out of her voice was screaming so myself I had that fahadh ha I came out again and went to squash it was lame and I prayed for her I took her up God my wife we took her to my house and she ledge was there on a bed and what you were just going like that so I have to call her husband to come because she was really getting down so within few minutes she couldn't talk to us again we're talking were calling her and she wouldn't respond she was also going fed in a way threatening way fed and the husband came rush in caught her caught her she couldn't respond so I got some brothers and I took a husband who have to take her to the teaching hospital because the cases is beyond what we can handle at home we have prayed so I'm gonna have a prayer meeting that evening in church and it was actually about the time we should start the evening service so I felt I went to the church I felt how can we be in church and we're having a prayer meeting and then from the same compound somebody will take it to hospital doesn't mean that caught us no more and separate us and what cannot be honest it so after stop the brothers has said please wait while the parameter will finish the parameters before you return so we went into the church has booked the church at all and certainly judge briefly and then went to the press section at a point during the procession then I saw her saw him her song run in sunny church and jump on a beacon so Ashley Annie was it was just jumping on it ticking screaming so I knew that something must have happened my wife was at home and with with her and her husband I saw about children so I believe it caught a blister who was behind me I said moved to my house within then something must have happened a so but I had got to the house after said that he came behind him about time they go to the house this is not a stone and this happened right on my wife's arms so my wife has to drop her run out of the house and was screaming you know and when they came back he merely to tell me that the comforter has passed on I said that's why of course you know how a few the point I was confused what do I do so that's ok will be Caprica check her to hospital so the bloody car I've brought a body and put aside the vehicle and I said you take her to the teaching hospital go to the hospital why we go to church to pray then we went a web slide back inside the church I stopped the prayer meeting the Pope Leila stop the prayer meeting and I announced to the church that does an emergency Adams the comfort is seriously down and just put it like that so um friends I saw the acts for another ants work on faith what did George prayer it wasn't just like when we pray like when nobody talked and we call it players and taste like that but this was really the people cried out to God and by this time the body was been taken to the hospital and when it got a decision was between they'd come out and looked at her she was then just dead so they just abandon her there put her there and and we and no attention was given to her what he just was praying this hotel lasted for up to an hour and before I have to excuse myself from the charge I went and called them at the hospital and they said as a comfort just that their Britain [Applause] our God is dear God [Applause] they took out an emergency and we got to attend to her and so far the doctor called me about 2 a.m. that Wednesday night and was asking me if there if she fell from somewhere because I was around where the watching was happening tissue for I said because the brain the dome was swollen and there are certain conditions no does miracle Sam Sann hammered a medical doctor but while you're speaking in a medical term sense this night at but I said no she did not fall but the brain actually was swollen but they were surprised that upon all that happened there was no single brain damage God restore her and God hear her as the comfort is here and living testimony her and watching the shows that a God of Elijah is still alive I'm here the same yesterday today and forever god bless you let me see the Oz maybe this plan college somebody about two weeks ago us us written that's a to three weeks ago on a Sunday afternoon I receive a call from a pastor he boasted his name is but a Malachi and it was excited the surprising the God of Elijah is still alive our God sphere does those things he used to do in those old days you know he was so excited and it was telling me how a brother and officer in the church they were in the church service for this Sunday and this brother at the point they saw him sitting and just like his lump on it on a sheer so that at first he thought he was slipping but after some time he was still like that so they have to get close to him and getting close to him they noticed that his brother has passed on right inside the church so it truly hoped listening to in the world their brain said they all come to the altar and begin to cry out to the Lord brain and acts in the Lord for to restore the broadest life is that after a long time of brain nothing happened so they waited and waited and waited and Martin happened so then they now decided to take him to the hospital and let into the hospital the hospital attendants refused to attend to attend to him because it was as a complete dead body so then they advise them if you want to do anything but early go to a winner and then he said much there was no need so but I still believed they still have faith and thalia greatest surprise at a time that we're about to move the body to the to wear a let be to go to the mark this water open his eyes I mean doctors and in losses we are so amazed they didn't know what happened but that was a god of Elijah he is the same yesterday today and forever case not a code of history is the present tense god what he did yesterday he can do today hallelujah the brother is alive today as the confidence in he is yet this morning as a living testimony god bless you [Applause] [Music] what manner of man is Jesus [Applause] what my man is Jesus [Music] you know he rested there [Music] yeah Oh give the love it it's out the phrase briefs can't evade ma you maybe see that we're not doing yet we're not done yet so we have 1 2 we're coming to three let's give the Lord a clap of Dreams [Applause] you know these are very long Fe so if I keep reading it is gonna tell me some hours but I have read it and read it so I want to compress it phrase got a man I believe but our Steven will really accept my proposal to compress it praise God a man but a Steven and wife had been married and he talked about how it was very very difficult he was of an Anglican Church when the Lord God showed him the revelation of the message and He gave His life to Christ and then started worshipping God and like God will always sure the man his wife and stuff the enemy for them all throughout I know what he's talking about when you have another church you want to be a now a born-again Christian anyone you know you face a lot of tribulations and more from the father concerning the wife so he was able to scare true by the grace of God a difficulties trying to get a wife married and they moved on praise God MA but I'm much more consigned to tell you the story about how the wife died and God raised Ibaka gaint alive you know when the Bible say that enemy would come like a flawed but let me tell you God allows the enemy to come like your flaws he will get to one river he was some kind of rain down God will allow it the devil would take the key and open up and then the rain he never makes any rain but he's gonna move in the midst of the rain to cause a flood but don't worry there is that promise he will raise a standard against the enemy so the enemy came like a Florida against our brother's wife she was on her way to the bank and then was kind of like in the vehicle he was she got into but she didn't know that these are very bad people gangsters so it was like they were taking her away for one reason or the other so this sister was screaming from the vehicle and then when these people realize it was what we call a can a pepper in Nigeria so when the people realize that somebody was in distress call from that vehicle so and then the people inside a vehicle felt that room maybe we may be caught or something of that nature what they did was they pushed this sister in motion and she fell on a hard road and hit her head on the ground and broke this car she went into shock was bleeding and there was no brother no sister there but somehow the police came around the same and then they try to find out and they they did they discovered the document around her and then without they started to make a call so when the Medi score the broader was not close by and then when he got the news there was you know as the husband you will feel like you could just appear and disappear and they arrived where the wife worse [Applause] for those of you never had experience I have had this kind of experience whereby something happened to my wife and and I will feel like I could from wherever I am and just can you know translate praise government you know under the condition he was not yet to know then he was able to call her brother who was close by to run to the scene and I brought I got there and then give back the report it was a bad one so he had to call his pasta incidentally this was happening when we are having the convention here so he called his pastor and his pastor his pastor's wife by the grace of God as I said when he called his past or his pastor is just coming in now that's what a Philippines in care prays Clara main so a prayer request was offered here and the situation was prayed over it was the pastor's wife that rude now requests quickly there was respect the saints of God from here or offered prayers you know sometimes when people come down here and then prayer request is being said and things like that you don't know the power that follow your prayers you don't know how heaven the key is being on the door has been unlocked and gods sending down answers now while we are doing this here the devil has done his own so they were able to rush this sister to the hospital and she was what we call dead on arrival DOA so he could not be received to be managed and then within this scenario brother a key had heard about this also brother a K prayed also but a K is that room but contrary because she was still in that situation no breathing on a thing all of a sudden life came back again praise God a man and then went to do x-rays that give the courage to the doctors they had to do x-rays and authoress and they discovered damage and then the doctor was wondering he could not see because with the situation of what has happened there would not have been any suit of any any any chance for her to be back again to life and I want to tell you it was just like this scenario I also saw myself of a pastor friend of mine in Abuja but I really would a the devil came and shredded her sir let him down the doctors were there I was walking up and down with them we could not find no diagnosis but our brother was going he came at a time I see you rejected him at a point everybody said it was all over accordin apologies he said well that is not we can do but God who is so reaching missing got so reaching Missy he started the environment he proved that he was taken and at the braiding were praying one thing about it is that is not just on looking or shuttin up and down I've never seen people that really have faith they're bred in over there they said no it can never happen it will never happen because when we are sick our posture does not rest he will ensure that we something has been done and then how comes that we are going to literally really lose him and as they prayed on all of a sudden the kidneys that part op came back to life the hats that was completely going down collapsing and I mean the the Hat came back again alive the man that was

the little prey [Music] [Applause] [Music] god bless you good morning if you ever Bibles and lecture the very attention to Genesis 1 and sin Luke chapter 4 Genesis 1 I'll read verse 26 through verse 28 I'm sure the scripture we all know very well certainly many of us can really you know with our eyes closed but let's go and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so God created man in his own image and the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth amen armsan look when it's you I'm gonna read a pretty lengthened portion from there you know the Bible said that I got some kinda scriptures which I'll show you in a minute but the Bible said that Jesus Christ as a son lent obedience by the things that he suffered so Harry is one of those scriptures as a matter of fact a major one where Jesus Christ is learning obedience now when you see that when you read that it doesn't mean he was disobedient and then he he had to suffer to lend to know like that if you do wrong you will you know that's not what it means that's not what it means it means that the things that is suffered the challenges the things that came across his path his suffering his pains the circumstances he learned that obeys the word under those circumstances really pays off every circumstance every challenge everything that happened let him understand was an experience was an opportunity for him to learn the way you obey the word those circumstances have got to obey the word also that's what it means amen so your challenges your circumstances is not a kill you but an opportunity to learn obedience to land that this world works this world every circumstance in my life will abate if I obey the word and let the word have his way the circumstances have no choice but to obey the word here's the master of every circumstance he speaks and every circumstance stands at attention the master is here watch how Jesus Christ as a son and is I example citizen how he learned obedience by every circumstance every pain every suffering every temptation every challenge so look for verse one array through 22 is the lengthen one but I'll try to run through it and Jesus been full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan and was led by the spirit into the wilderness being forty days tempted of the devil those are the things he's suffered your temptations your sufferings amen I mean those days he did even nothing and when the world ended he afterward hungered and the devil said unto Him when he appeared most vulnerable if thou be the Son of God command these stones that will be made bread and jesus answered him saying it is written learning obedience to the word obeyed the word himself and took the what to apply to the situation to the temptation to the suffering knowing that every temptation every sin every situation will obey the Word of God and you are learning that obedience is better than sacrifice amen and Jesus said it is written the man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God the devil is not done yet the traditions are not done yet your challenges your sufferings are not your pains are not done yet and the devil take him up and high mountain should on to him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time you know like you know flash in your mind your thoughts your thinking path and your thinking process just shows you everything in a moment of time what you could be how you can you know just just take a chance and compromise on that what a little bit or do something that nobody sees it you know just do something it doesn't matter I got understands and in a moment of time just shows him and in his mind in his thoughts because you're it presents you as a third God does and the devil also presents you as a thought amen and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time and the devil said unto him all this power will I give thee and the glory of them for that is delivered and to me and to whomsoever I will I give it you think that they ever don't know scripture I will give them to you not just that and the glory of them now you know man had fallen from the glory of God so the devil was sniffing that this man here is come to restore men back to the glory of God so you wanted him to attain that Laurie of God because he's scared stiff that that glory of God is not gonna be funny for him when man comes right back to that glorious Adam having the gun of Eden the devil knows is in big trouble then your finger devil is in trouble now wait until adopted sons begin to rise up and the devil knows because sleeve this man had a lot to do with it so exchange one glory for another glory my glory is waiting on the road don't know that I'll give you this glory right now the glory of the majesty to own all of these things here everybody in the world worships you great temptation in suffering do I do I not do I do I not but submit to the obedience to the world submission to the world under the control of the world father not my will but thine be done no I won't take what the devil's telling me I will take what your word says I'd be obedient to their word and he found strength and virtue was his submitted to the control of the world like that now what the gracious words that came out of his mouth and jesus answered and said unto me get thee behind me Satan for it is written thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve finding strength in the word for every one of your situations a man being in obedience to that will let the world step out of the way they really give both the bum said he still learn how to get yourself out of the way and let the word have his way to let go and let God have his wonderful way your brothers will vanish your night will turn today when you learn the greatest gift of all to step out of the way and let the word harvest let the what fight your battles Amen what demon what spirit was that conscience what challenge what pain was suffering can stand against the word he's the mighty champion like ordinary just sang the undisputed a man on defeated champion of law amen verse 9 not done yet more suffering and he brought him to Jerusalem and set him on a pinnacle of the temple and said unto him if thou be the Son of God cast doubt cast thyself down from vens from there just cast yourself down for and for it is written verse 10 he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee so is a war of courts now quotes the devil learns fast here Lent the thing that would you know you'll learn what you're opening doors people who do those things are get to in a minute people who do those things know like that you have to learn what the competition is doing and I can if it would gin Simon and is working don't be don't don't be proud copy it as bona fide you can make it better and that's what the devil did here real powerful tactic so this thing is working against him this man is bringing in the world the world the world so let me also bring you the world so he went into the world not that he respects the water he has no respect whatsoever for the world but just the water got to use to manipulate to cheat to deceive that's why he was about but he more than marriage match this was not any man this was a man that had been trained to let obedience by the things that he suffers to know that every temptation every trial every pain every every circumstance that seem so calm against you is an opportunity by God to learn obedience to live that the work does work that what God says he will do and when you land this time around next time it becomes easier to believe that's what it is here these what works this word works amen so that there will begin a core to wharf courts that's why we don't get into any of course in anybody but the panem said it would believe it that's 0zt if we are still searching keep on searching move on man go on segment we have found a man our resting place in the revealed Word of God sent from that from God through that Elijah Prophet Malachi for for it is written he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee very smart you know all those things you remove something from the always gravies no other ways then you check this way I'm trying to do jump from the pinnacle here father is this your way is this your will I want to be obedient to every word and go see my son not my way not my will but Jesus was the word himself and that's what you're getting too to keep thee he remove in other ways and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone and Jesus answering said unto Him it is said thou shalt not tempt the LORD thy God and when the devil arraigned there is all the temptation he departed from him for a season but he learned some more things to know that this what works befits the devil anytime under any condition even when you are weak and vulnerable like Jesus was it would always defeat the devil amen verse 14 and Jesus returning the power of the Spirit into Galilee and then why not a frame of him through all the region round about and he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went to the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the Prophet Isaiah's and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he anointed me to preach they are to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he left out on the day of vengeance of our God which in all those news Bible readers message students the bomb tour because there was no this is rightly dividing the world I'm making the word present tense because the day event declaring that the Avengers was left to these in time bright and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them the one that synagogue were thrusting on him and that's why I believe when you come a church leave all this side talk thrust in your eyes and him not the mist on the pulpit but the word that's been spoken because Jesus Christ is the mystery of God every word every mystery revealed amen and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears and all bear him witness now one that I have the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth amen I made a lot a dish pleasant to read no his only words go richly bless you let's bow our heads and water pray our Heavenly Father thank you for this blessed our blood the time of fellowship that you have been giving us these past few days I pray now Lord that your Holy Spirit will help each one of us here I pray he will help me especially Lord as when they ever to go into your world to bring a context to your people helped me a lot to say only what want me to say and shut my mouth when I'm setting off I mean

kind of chat oh my child is mine is one word control and and I got a few corner scriptures as a matter of fact in all truthfulness they're more than a few Hebrews 11 32 to 40 which is where you find the heroes of faith in the Bible for charm will fail let's talk of Gideon and Barack and all of that then also Colossians 1:9 229 white speaks about Christ in you the hope of glory and then Hebrews 5 verse 8 verse 9 where talk about as a son he learned obedience by the things he suffered and then revelation 3 on verse 21 he that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I overcame I also overcame and I'm submit with my father in his throne amen my inspiration Christ in you the hope of glory and a subject if you can call it that the anointing supreme power in control amen sabrina greetings are my wife and my family and a question of our church legal that's here it's your the convention and to thank our precious bullets as a good job' for the blessing to be here again for bringing us here again - enugu arm 20:18 is about the caliber was twenty thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen this is a Fijian ANOVA and number five is Girish and I'm sure that all of us have explained the grace of God these past few days here brother Charles I want to thank you for I know the pain to go through to do this I know the pains that you were that it broadened for God's people is not possible to do this so thank you about Jars for bringing us here from all over the world stirred ire thank you so much and the family and the little flock and then a pair of crab assembly in a new book thank you so very much I know you do go over bother me up yours a little flock and they don't have so much help in the estimates that because a young group but God who is rich and faithful and an enable his army in the many power of Christ assembly to get us together and make us all feel so welcome Thank You Kimball a challenge or a pleasure man I want to you know with all the pastures many shares the believers the churches that are here thank you for helping to make the convention thank you and thank you for this spirit of fellowship that we fail these past few days that we always play the new GU for the conventions this past few years it's always such a switch time of fellowship believers together from everywhere just fellowship in no warmth of the barrier has broken down no attitudes just the word and a common belief that God sent us a prophet the great larger profit of Malachi for a man for all my mission brothers who have gone forth thank you so much for your message each time from Allah a key and down through last night brother of it thank you so very much and again I'm just trying to talk to you and on this a bit of a clock of control this morning now control that say what that are fun very intriguing for a long time especially as it comes and applies to you know Christianity this was in the message because we are all here we're all about control now you may not understand I believe that but our legislature a few minutes we hear all about control that's why you were here that's one here that's why we get a church that's why we do the things that we do if we really mean to be in the rapture because you know what and and not just those were the message most any human being you see us in our lives struggling for control it's even the business war you seen the spots war you see all over every facet of human existence you see men less women in him that once control a man can you say Amen now I'm just talking to you okay just talking all right the preachers have gone ahead so I'm just talking and I think you're right I think you're a good class you have listened so but don't let it become so academically like scratch your head when it becomes like that then I know it's time to just sit down but control you love control I love control me I don't love control I lie you know where this is coming from God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion control control it's in Bill is inflating man this control you want to have dominion you want to protect your space are you can somebody relate can you relate that's that's words you can wriggle out of that even when you feel you're the nicest person you let everybody have their way give her their space not true if a man made in God's image Christian unbeliever control now when God made man he made him in his own image but like I said many times many times we want to make God in our image we want God who been an image who would be like horse is only in our church our group that's God that's it got in your own image but God make him a nice image you try to cope with him and cope with his world he doesn't have to look like your group every believer doesn't have to look like your group or your church but when it must be like our group our church our pastor our deacons you got a God in your own image that's not how God did it what made man in his own image after his likeness what he likes you may be seated just talking to you a man so this man II met it put him in the beautiful garden of eden and give him three things but the Benham said would you not know these things the prophet a great prophet i stripped from the man of God William Branham II taught us these things now we've been on the Commission we warned many times I mean even this is this convention here don't you ever for one minute think that this message is failing or that's a law there is nothing like that but if you ever let the devil get you to feel nothing is going on nothing is moving you are defeated you might as well go going home somewhere this measure is stronger now than it's ever been because God is getting ready maybe see that God a man you are stronger today than you were yesterday I'm not talking about what you feel I'm telling you it no soul the devil is more scared of you today than it was yesterday [Applause] amen so you'll be seated so God made man in his own image after his likeness but we wanted God in our image after our likeness what we like and then we'll find the court on the scripture to make God Satan to me by the pen I'm sage that's a God in your own image so when God made these men for the Branham tourist in breda from the scriptures and let us see it that God give this man three things because when he fair is that Adam lost three things number one he lost his fellowship with God number two he lost his return alive and number three in his eternal life he lost an inheritance a man in his eternal life let me expensable to you here fellowship with God is his right as a son of God it's not like is this a right understand of God you don't have to do anything extra to earn eternal life addition of God neither do anything extra to learn fellowship with your father even in the natural and natural your son what is a good boy or a bad boy he's your son he has access to you all the time amen it has your life flowing through him well I disown that boy too late your life is flowing through him same way with God can somebody say Amen the devil is no match or glory because greater more powerful is he that is the youth and the devil in the world lying to you try to stop you but he cannot do it you can add orange the other pure virtuous sinless brother Jesus Christ amen man amen you may be seated [Applause] trying to keep it up on my time here because some of us are Chipotle key I I need some training because break a judge in less than one hour put me on that pulpit what it doesn't one hour

talk to the spiritual so anyway got made Manny's image again these three things and when man fell he lost these three things so we know from there he had these three things before he fell fellowship eternal life and inheritance in his talent now then here John we said but what it was was the authority the power the control over the earth that was the inheritance your son is your son but you know when you are writing your wheel to give your children the inheritance it depends on certain things and brother Branham taught us in God's economy that song has got to be the right kind of a song because this inheritance is powerful these returns pressing on the same level as God himself so you have got to be the right kind of a song firstly before he will give you this inheritance in life now Adam didn't know how to prove to be the right kind of a son because God made Adam not a child but a man in his own image made him a mature perfect man in cause image as though he had gone through the process to be the right kind of a son and given this inheritance in life but when Adam sinned unfair they lost all three and God immediately because Adam is a son is a son you can do anything about that what was in divorce his children he will never divorce you no matter how beaten up how black and blue you Vietnam he will never divorce you if we can just find your way back to the cross you will find your way back home but devil can keep you and put away by your father you always was a son you always your be a son hallelujah Laurie you may be seated [Music] but the the thoughts in the the inheritance in life got in Norwich topic immediately you restore the frost to those ways who writes as a soon it not to be the red candle so not to be any type of Sun it's in a life flash with his father but the inheritance is the only given to the right care of children with God felt atom yeah built atom up to that smoker when Adam fell said no this is no longer the right kind of song I cannot him that will that inheritance to have my domain to himself alone I cannot give him that but I restore back his inheritance I mean I restore back his fellowship is eternal life you'll never be lost you'll always be my son and so from that time the church has been how to come back to that inheritance that's supreme control on the face of the earth that's why you wanna have this craving for control of the instead of us we want to come back to rulership we want to come back to sonship you want to come back to sonship authority to speak and our words are backed just like that amen glory so follow my story so that's where the craving to come from God Sandman out I'm gonna say I'm not going to restore this control the inheritance back to you until I see you and see you under the control otherwise you'll prove to be the right kind of a song amen and when I see that I will call you aside give you three more words here is my son much spirit flowing freely and that's always tell there like for the OVC last night a main course or regional plan for you mantis 10 like the original mind the gun of Eden possessing on Timmins 20 spoken what authority power to control the earth total all the elements amen hey man against the Amen so when Adam fell borough's back to this spot here and that's why I said you mean all of us something on instead of us look longing for control you see it everywhere you see in your home life you see it at school you see between husband and wife you see within the children you see in the business world the husband wants to control his wife do I want to control the children Bejoy to control their parents what must happen to a husband this job want to control that church this must want to control the whole church control it smell of us it's part of who we are amen but we we have got control figured out wrong big-time big-time because God is a God of control God has little if it's just hanging everywhere he's a God of control but the devil has put a battle rap on that what control it means like you any prison means they control everything you do it means you can't do anything you are just held there and you just have to like stay in a straitjacket no that's what we think but that's opportunity how did Adam get here to have these three things it's an alive fellowship and inheritance how did you get there you have to go all the way back to Gus grid three four mystery which is Christ in you the ultimate abilities Christ in you to put Christ in you and give you hope for that glory that Adam had in the can of Eden Lorie Cory are you following me alright the preachers of preach so um and I hope I'm not too fast I asked by etching will you come with me he said no and I am preaching and I'm I'm tearing the brothers out so fast and they are wanting to run after me sobriety now sermon his cubicle I said button come on let's go I said no I love it here one time I preach somewhere and and I was being so fresh and there was translation I was being so fast and you know the words were jumping back and forth and you know right what is the rookie he doesn't know is out of his game he had of his all of his league in this place here so they had to rearrange the hall to accommodate my pitching staff you will think I will lend so when I went there I was very conscious now like that you've got to be measured and speak really slow so and I thought I did my best did my best so when we finish which is a finish as the brother the Chancellor hired I do was it okay inside he said you killed me I fell on his neck I said I'm so sorry brother you know so but let's hear I understand I understand but you know how did Adam get to help this year it's God's great 3/4 mystery which was God having the preeminence ease the control over Christ by the word and Christ off-price having control by his word over the brown collie preeminence ease but it's control controlling the bread lab rat learns to obey the word all the time and here is a secret when you learn to be something to the world every second missile around you will lend the same thing to the circumstance around you cannot stand against the watch the what will create a hole in the wall is there must be hole in that wall Oh hallelujah now the three for me she's not just catch phrase because I hear these days L name logos bright that's fine but don't take the water out of context Malakai him and reveal what the three for me she's nobody needs to shed more light on it nobody's to explain anyway hello him logos Brad what it means it's the Elohim God having premises and control over Christ the bride the word and Christ having premonitions over you the bride and number three is not the bride is Christ and the bride going back to Eden which is crashing you the hope of glory amen amen so here's a secret here so they can Avedon in the game of Eden here was Adam walk out of the theophany in the beginning made his spirit man on the face of the earth and how was Adam spirit man Adam and later judges to seven this female was put in the body of flesh and man became a living soul and this man Adam went open down the gun Avedon in the image of God with absolute control over the earth God was the god of the universe but his son Adam was the god of the earth in absolute control over the earth but how that worked how that works which you know but you're so repeated - you have that what was that God had control over Adam and so Adam could control the earth one had to come first God her to have preeminence is over Adam frosty and control over the earth automatically followed that's what we don't follow a sign don't look for signs signs follow the believer the believer has come to preeminence ease has come to control by the word amen amen amen amen so Adam there he was in total complete subjection to God on his world the world in his soul Sharon split of Elohim in his soul Genesis 1:26 228 with a command commissioned to subdue to rule to control the earth and so Adam was under the control of God and because of that you could control the but the very moment the very moment that Adam went away from the control of God the very minute like brother Delia things are said like that not going to happen when Eve you know these will be nothing happening and you watch for the vanity always about when Adam fell when Adam fell when Adam failed once Adam soul at his birthright and God lost control over Adam immediately Adam lost control of the earth in me it was instant the day you either of that danger will die and instantly I'd I knew something change something change on the spur Adam knew that you know we all love control I mean you get adopted and you won't love it you'll be happy that's all the life Adam ever knew have you ever thought about Adam before you came on the scene the only man on the face of this earth no fellowship no way to grow no matter who is father and mother and you know laying things no no nothing he was just alone and then go made it for him and they had fellowship with God and it was in absolute control over the earth touch all over the earth but once he did this sin and listen to the devil in the form of this happen through his wife go lost control over Adam and rather the same time instantly and I'm lost control over the earth you cannot eat a cake and have it Eve copy God seven so like we all do wrong so he he tried it again he snitched on me one organs but you will know you know you will know when something goes you know so he tried to like this removed this way I moved away nothing happened little excess that control like before I want to walk on the water and if I were himself sinking he run back you know that control was gone away from him I noticed that he was naked which wasn't an issue before he looked at his wife she's naked you know these not proper so he went right away to try and get that control back let's do something let's do something no that's how yeah we never admit until we are pinned to the world and we are pinned to the wall and we have to first to admit that the still of falling man don't do that and so he went and the fig leaves uncovered himself on its own so you say here also instead of beginning a free means something went wrong he you know like like something you stretch and find out the power is gone just gonna kick off the cheetah should I call me actually just money which I just look who is talking just when his way say lion come here the general straddle the of a tiger just coming like that graceful like that and I'm sorry getting afraid he said no something's gone wrong here I've gotta hide these animals will cheer me up I gotta hide from all these animals because they would be out they had the land roar he got afraid he said I was afraid so I hid myself fear came in he was afraid with loss of control his war just turned upside down that's why you and I want control control put stays in place control gets you in order control set things the way you think you want them to go like atom when we feel out of control we just don't feel right because God made us to control to be the controller on the earth so when we feel out of control that's another subject while we feel out of control I just want to you know stay here on you know Genesis and Adam you know I'm selling out to the devil through his wife's reasoning you got I wasn't deceived when you feel out of control when you feel not in control things just don't feel right unlike Adam we get control wrong Adam to fix this frame of loss of control look at what he did look at what he did it made figleaves wrong action God came down I don't know where out there he said I had the vault work in the garden and I was afraid of all these animals running around here and Aniyah done something wrong and I hit myself wrong action but Adam who tore your photo you were naked have you eaten the fruit that I did simple answer yes simple answer yes Adam said yes but an explanation not a laughing matter matter and said you know it's because of the woman that you yourself gave me I was in fine you know I see dementia I didn't found without her but you gave her to me you gave it to me wrong action simple answer yes everybody was win you was he did wrong he was caught red-handed but the blame is not mine alone out of control playing the blame game it's my wife it's my husband he's my brother is my sister he's the pastor is Julian oh come on now come on now [Applause] Bhavana me nigeria okay I mean idea this is on top for me so I know that's what I want but always coming around wasn't that trouble is coming because he can see things that just you know cause whatever but you know I don't mean to be controversial I apologize about that up front but I don't like living in denial I don't like delicious deceive myself I like to call it spirit spade and if I'm wrong and wrong I can get over your head and because your pastor is talking you can keep quiet but God is not gonna keep quiet garden respect no possible response children and but mom's never gonna be dead listens here anyway so Adam put a blame game you know when it was like everybody's wrong because of what you have done you can never all up to what you did the only way you owned up everybody must take a blame for it because he felt out of control the blame game the victim mentality everybody's against me if not for my wife if not for my husband not for the judge even though for the country if not for the president just blame everybody for your circumstance because he fails was totally out of control and we got control wrong totally figured out wrong lost control we want to get it back and gone wants us to get it back so how do we get control back O'Reilly what's the right way to get back this control how do we get control right we go back to God go back to God he's the God of all control he said in the Bible let everything be done decently and in order God do it all by himself thoughts on his mind and became the logos poured all he wasn't to the logos where that Angels the word created angels angels worshiped him and when in just watched them then there was a revolt in Heaven's something went wrong there's no panic in heaven the word is in control is a God of control things go wrong it was all well thought out it's all in God's program things can never go wrong nothing can go wrong but what God would allow it and the world control that they will control it war in heaven through Lucifer out and he's won for angels and human our wine heaven became human battles and got him on the earth and created the heavens and the earth the god of order and control I wish I had the picture to show you the the grid you in France that he created but let me give a simple statistic the skies the heavens bubbles it declared some writing declare the glory of God and the firmament shows his handiwork and in the stats that you see at night there are billions and billions and billions of them many of them are bigger than our earth and those tears are wrong planets and it grew a planets form a galaxy and it galaxy has its own and the planets rotate around that zone now our own galaxy our own galaxy and most of these galaxies are spinning around me no we don't feel it because of God's great wisdom but this earth this earth is an and the galaxy Dewayne is spinning around at the breakneck speed of four hundred and ninety thousand miles an hour this our galaxy this this galaxy that were in is spinning round spinning round spinning round for an eight thousand miles an hour we don't feel it and even at that great breakneck speed to for our gadget to make one single rotation you don't know how many years on it it wouldn't at least two hundred million years for our galaxy to make one single dish around the Sun and God keeps all that they're absolutely controlled in order of the McGowen one like that [Applause] and he hung those things in space by his word here's what keeps him on the check his word is the controller that controls all of business and keeps them in their space Laurie glory to God and you know what you know what there but over a billion all the galaxies not planets over a billion or the galaxies out there like our galaxy uncle credit these heavens and the earth and the hanging space there at this speed Ranelagh I don't collide he's a God of order I had that was not right under control and it control them by his word are you following me control them by his word and this great God come right down to you and I and could add them in the Garden of Eden this great God what is man that thou art mindful of him or the Son of man that you will visit him acquainted man in the cabin of Eden and put a man the same way he wants to control this man and by the panem tell us and you know when he came down gen 1:26 that was God coming down his control tower in Adam are the control tower was by the word the seven spirits of God in Adam soul and in the physical do you see this control of God right down to everything that God does he's a God of console in Adams body your body is so controlled so controlled you have a control center in your head control the whole human body every cell has a control center everything is so controlled he's a God of control and that control brings an order so God so God when he gave Adam to control the earth he was sitting right an Adam spoon in Adams heart with his control tower it chose man's had to be his control he was seated there in the form of his seven spirits and Adam was subject to this control and then the earth was to me to Adams control amen glory to God a man can you share hallelujah are you following our story it's a beautiful story of redemption now like I said the devil gives a rap went about control I wish I'd want to control me it's very young people want to control me I'll lose my freedom they'd let me watch them what I do know here was God controlling Adam in the Garden of Eden God was absolutely in control what in this control like by the daily preach and choices watch in this control in this control why did God tell Adam of all the trees you go eat but this one don't eat but it's your choice I give you a choice not inside God's control got left room for a choice that for Adam to be or not to be for Adam to obey model be that's why so we get control one number one we control you get a do it here parents control the children you know do this here do this here or God didn't do that the controller is not your word those spirits are lost when don't respect your word the rest man I recognize gets word is that same don't control your children but God controlling his son Adam he told him this is what I'm going to do but if you choose the other way no their consequences with your choice so God's control leaves a room for a choice I [Applause] know why you know why nobody grows on the very controlling atmosphere nobody goes why you Anna Church everything is control sit down stand up you can't even think for yourself when you're at home sit downs cannot okay you do this here the church the pastor deacons do this here and the pastor's get away to take it away from them and do everything by himself and they the deacon you know you will never grow the same way in a home somewhere at home we don't give the people a chance to be and not to be too to grow to make their mistakes to learn that's what choices are there the process of choices lets you go through thinking it through if I go this way if I go this way these are the consequences if I go that way these are the consequences just talking to you and I hope you are listening if I go this way these are the consequences if I go through the consequences no I will go this way and not that way and in that process is a maturing process through the thinking process that's why God gave us choices to think through your choices and in control he lets us have room to be or not to be he doesn't crowd out our space so it's a lie when the devil says husain is all about controlling you controlling people's minds no in god's system of control you have a choice to obey or not to obey in the devil stem of control he gives you no choice even when you don't want to do wrong he forces you to do wrong you know like the prodigal son it's the I don't like this Oh Mia too much computing this one here I'll go to my father say father I'm tired of this control here I'm gone on his valiant said no you're not going proving that he was wrong in the first instance father let him go and the control he was getting the way from running away from from his father did he meet you where he went did he meet the control he went on was so all his substance he was free freedom to do what he wanted to know this control gives you freedom not to live like a freedom to do the right thing freedom to shun the wrong and do the right thing that's God's control and you'll give your children that same opportunity to have the choice to do the right thing or do the wrong thing when they get to that age of accountability if the choice is the choice Oh glory to God amen amen so Adam when he sinned and he lost control you want to get to control right back I need to wrong things and that's like I said that's what we all do we want control and we do the wrong things it becomes my way or the highway makes a domineering dominant you know nobody must be our way and no other way that's not good we have control and you'll never come to adoption like that more you will never Oh glory I'm not making sense I'm almost done I'm almost done so God will lend for me how this control comes about can I have the first my first picture there all right hello him have thoughts on his mind and that makes sense right and then arrow him put his thoughts into a body called the logos a body like this body but with the better seen it's supernatural body and all that and these thoughts narrowing became what seats in the loggers Adam was that funny narrow him you - a narrow him I was it for the narrow him so what got in in Genesis 1:26 was he took Adam seed in the logos the Bible says God created man in his own image of that seed he created a perfect man and that became the spirit man in Genesis 1:26 - 28 and you were still they as a throat a seed word in the Lourdes and what Adam was to do was so standing in the timeless season call you out and here you would have come God take your seat from the loggers and this is your seed and your serum your seat and your seed and God took it out and created the purpose of creation that's the only the quitter that can do that that can take a seat and walk in and fall it into the image of God 7 perfect spirits that's what he did in Genesis 1 2028 Genesis 1:26 was not the theophany it was it feel funny seed that was created and unfasten it to the image of God and ventures to 7 it took that spirit man put of flesh around him well this you're funny this seed was Adam soul and put inflation on him and just used two services go from man just 1:26 was the creation that's the creation this happens on the inside and then fun man on the face of the earth no man can do the Christian on the inside only God but man can do the farming on the outside like brother Charles was talking about the Nigerian doctor they can work on the flesh they can work on the body they can American shadow to a prosthetic limb and you have things they can cottonseed up but no man can cut open here the soul only God can do the walk of creation on the inside [Applause] next picture this was Adam before the fall in his soul was seven perfect spirits that was a spirit man and that's been my was a control tower the control tower was not Adam it was the world got controlling by his word and I was under the control of the ward in his soul and man just became a living soul when he put flesh on him the saw the what image lived out through the flesh man became a living soul but watch it when Adam fell what happened I don't you need to understand this you know what the battle has been for you and I the devil knew with the word and Adam soul he has no chance so what he did he came and began to attack his spirit it ever can never get your soul began to attack his spirit where you have your affection memory reasoning imagination conscience began to attack it has God said to reach the other world has God said if God said no that's not what it is here this was the Comptroller the world in the soul and he speaks the spirit listens it speaks the body listens and man became a living soul the soul lived through this flesh this spirit could not stand in the way but the devil came and succeeded in getting me here and government to reason the word has God said no God hasn't said and all that and then when man fell he fell short of the glory of God this was the glory of God inside and this Gloria Gorman's fell this world became shortened it came from in his stature or the fullness became a little seed in his saw the control tower was with the use of a little seed and that never got in here introduced another control tower to began to reason the word so after the fall the control tower the what image became a little seed and thus a man have seen and fallen short of the glory of God the glory of God that you're funny in seed form in your soul seven perfect spirits the nature of God in your soul the fall became ready used because man fare reduce to this little button amen so the control tower did not did no longer have the power that he had to control the spirit and the flesh because the devil got in here with his own control Lucifer's control tower the human mind which is your brain to reason things out can you say Amen amen so brother sister that's been our story can give me the third one I'm almost done really all right that's been our story this is your human mind the brain the physical brain is the body but that is the spirit that makes you work and that's with your human mind so the human mind works with the brain and like I explained before right here is your emotions right there the front of the brain is where you have the reasoning and when you live in your human mind at the level of your human mind what you are doing is that your reason and your emotions at work all the time all the time the control tower is to shut up your soul is no longer controlling like that when you are living in the humanistic realm your soul which is the control tower for God instead of shut up and this is the devil's control tower your reasoning and your emotions your intellect is the lecture of mine you read the Bible and then your intellect your mind know this can happen the doctors say that can never happen and all of that I know what you you can check this out not me saying that because all your sensations come through here emotions are given an upper hand all the time when you see at this level here your emotions will always win against your reasoning that's why when you know you know something is wrong to do while your emotions get you solar control you are so angry you know I should be angry like that your emotions win all the time between your emotions and your wrists your intellect your emotions you are wired the originals will get the upper hand all the time so when the fall happened the devil religious to live at this level war of emotions versus your reasoning have God said yes and no God say we shouldn't do it but no you will become whatever and put his hand in here the emotions felt good and the motions massage your reasoning the motions that are given an opera hand all the time whatever controls your emotions controls you so funny man that's his teach and God said I will not give you back that inheritance in life until I can get men back to the spot to where the control tower will be set back in his heart in that had compartment and that controls how we control the intellect will control the emotions control the body like it did in Adam before the fall that's been the Gospel story to get mom back to that spot to where God can take charge again and control your reasoning control your emotions control your flesh body that's been the Gospel story and that's why I sent you a prophet a man you may be seated Oh glory now can it send it back to the picture before this one right so here we are these where we are headed for but this is where we are when we come in to this world a little seed in us seed of God is a little seed but it's not the control tower normal the control is taking place here from your reason and emotions than your flesh and your your insolate and all the time your emotions always win because that's why man has become like one of us to know good and evil and he said to him that knows what is good and does it not to him it's in that's how we seen you no good and you don't do it because your emotions control you they catch your your feelings first and they guide what you do and we act and then think later so that's been the wall well when you become a Christian when become a believer this sit in the soul is walking up and that is journey to go back here we are going back where we fell from they will not leave you comfortless is that I will come again he will come and save you say to the weary one your God has surely come he will come and save you or let's drive it home now and go out of here glory may be see the glory so when you become a Christian this Syriac wets out ghost control tower begins to come back into the human soul because God controls by his world not by the parents words not by the pastor's words by his words he controlled the universe all of those galaxies are there by his words he doesn't cried over them like a helicopter it is the Sun staining his flesh he's just wandering there he doesn't know his word because what has no power in itself it meant to make this pass on the moon and the Sun and the galaxies to hang in their spaces thus one has the power why one does not have the power to keep your children our control to keep the stress on your children under control Laury Laury [Applause] you may be seated just talking to you so guts in the process of taking control back over Adam and when Adam is totally again under the control of God the earth will automatically come on the Adams control will be back here will be back here seven perfect spirits the image of God or what image in Adams soul undaunted into his flesh again and man will go up and down the earth again like Adam just see the Lord or keep still and that's what the devil fights that word so bad he pollutes the water he deletes the word interpreter word but thank God down through the ages we have examples examples of heroes in the Bible who correct dreams of the water God clever of the day and age even in the Old Testament and this was selling their soul and had under total control and when this word is in the soul and after that control the flesh is subject circumstance run is subject this one in the soap messages every circumstance [Applause] hallelujah let's call some on the scene Moses the prophet Moses then he was is been spoken about in this vision I don't have to go through all of that but here was Moses at the Red Sea God I told him lie below visible as man come back and watching me on this mountain and God said go back by the way of Midgar and by the way the ratio was ahead of them God didn't tell him that when he got let's see a circumstance the things in what's gonna suffer and he'll was death and uncover all of them speaking had against him you lost your commission did you come did you come here before by the way of the Red Sea Conroy's went to Egypt he didn't go by the Red Sea it was come back to the cemetery why didn't you go back the same way God spirit let him at will meet God and there was the Red Sea there but you are sworn by himself thy seed share who says every guard every guard shall be possessed you believe that or a glory may be seated oh brother I'm not doing too badly may be seated it was Moses the Prophet the word came to him on the war dropped in his soul sunlight in his soul the word for that day for that age from the presence of God the glory of God in his soul amen the control tower was still in Moses soul and every challenge that he met was an opportunity to learn obedience by the things he was suffering there was data Koren speaking against him don't speak back against them don't go the way they're going father was AHA me to the ward is in control the what led him through midcal to the Red Sea what do I do father what did they would say Moses cried out to God God actually got angry at him I don't want to panic God one who feel lost God the one to feel overwhelmed run through the perilous the heroes of faith this was thrown at us guess that yeah this no damn even in the Lions Den down because the world will possess every dirt of every enemy Oh God crying back to Moses white ground to me speak and go forward are you ready to speak we are gonna get to it under the blood of bulls and goats Moses spoke on the ratio open up another parables and gods Moses spoke and the rest it closed up unfair one in strong men what drowned of the myths of the sea why is shadow if for tests or way will be like when the water God is sitting as a controller in your soul again like I said an atom so old hallelujah our Elijah how about Joshua he needed some light to follow the Amalekites to follow the Midianites is the Lord he was few more lot of sunlight with the one in his soul the word for the day and age in his soul he knew the seed shall possess every gauge you can run through the Bible Gideon
