[25:44] Matthew chapter 16 reading from verse 13
[25:53] when Jesus came into the coasts of
[25:55] Caesarea Philippi he asked his eye for
[25:58] saying whom do men say that I the Son of
[26:00] Man and they said some say that our John
[26:04] the Baptist saw me last as Jeremiah's
[26:06] one of the prophets he said unto them
[26:09] but whom say either I am Simon Peter
[26:11] answered and said thou art the Christ
[26:13] the Son of the Living God and jesus
[26:14] answered and said unto him blessed the
[26:16] dog Simon bar Jonah for flesh and blood
[26:19] hath not revealed it unto thee but my
[26:21] father which is in heaven
[26:23] I said to d-dad our Peter and upon this
[26:26] rock I will build my church and the
[26:27] gates of Hell shall not prevail against
[26:30] it and I will give unto thee the keys of
[26:32] the kingdom of heaven whatsoever thou
[26:35] shalt bind on earth shall be bound in
[26:36] heaven whatever - I'll loosen it shall
[26:39] be loosed we didn't change dr. - wanna
[26:44] read from verse 15 and if a brother or
[26:48] sister be naked and destitute of daily
[26:50] food one of you say on the name depart
[26:53] in peace be warm and filled
[26:54] notwithstanding ye give them not those
[26:57] things which are needful to the body
[26:59] what does it profit even so faith if it
[27:02] hath not works is dead being alone ye a
[27:06] man may say thou hast faith and I have
[27:07] works show me thy feet without I works
[27:09] and I will surely my feet by my works go
[27:13] believers that there is one God don't do
[27:15] as well the devil's also believe in
[27:18] tremble but will thou all know will thou
[27:21] know o vain man that faith without works
[27:23] is dead was not Abraham our Father
[27:27] justified by works when he had offered
[27:28] Isaac
[27:29] upon the altar see is the whole feet
[27:32] what would works and by works was feet
[27:35] me perfect and the scripture was
[27:37] fulfilled which saith abraham believed
[27:40] God it was imputed unto him for
[27:43] righteousness and he was called the
[27:46] friend of God you see then how that by
[27:50] works a man is justified I'm not by
[27:52] fetal me
[27:53] let us pray father we have read your
[27:55] word and we thank you for your word we
[27:57] are grateful for the Scriptures his
[28:00] being me to live in Israel and I pray
[28:03] tonight that the word become flesh and
[28:05] dwell among us father me to take the
[28:07] word and maybe like a direct arrow to
[28:09] the house of the people I mean Antonia
[28:12] saw the media a transformational service
[28:15] where their lives be completely
[28:16] transformed by this blessed Word of God
[28:19] and Jesse my ask it amen and amen
[28:22] you may be seated or praise the name of
[28:24] the Lord it's always a blessing and a
[28:27] privilege to be in the house of God that
[28:30] I have a tighter the action of faith
[28:33] praise God figure my hearing here in the
[28:35] world is not right last service we had
[28:39] here in receiving and acting on the
[28:41] world tonight we talked about the action
[28:43] of faith and have an inspiration the
[28:45] call of God I believe each one of you
[28:48] here tonight have a call of God upon
[28:50] your life it's not man that called you
[28:53] is call that culture not your family
[28:57] call you it's a calling of God I want
[29:00] you to dr. unkind side your spirit
[29:02] inside your heart that there's a call of
[29:05] God upon your life he didn't call him
[29:08] when he was good and nice and yours
[29:10] righteous he called me when he was
[29:12] filthy and he was no good it's a call
[29:14] for for just as you are
[29:16] and you came just as you are but he
[29:19] didn't leave you just as you are he
[29:22] began to tidy you up and clean you up
[29:23] because they was born in sin on a common
[29:26] ship iniquity or all filthiness
[29:30] Deanna rotten and so on but he said you
[29:32] are my child and I coming back for you
[29:35] I'm coming I'm coming to redeem you
[29:37] praise God I'm not somebody's just a
[29:39] bless you know but to come to bring you
[29:41] back because you were somewhere before
[29:43] and the scripture clearly states who we
[29:46] for new Accord so if you have to be in
[29:49] God's foreknowledge to get the calling
[29:52] of God let me say it again you have to
[29:54] be you have to be king courts for
[29:56] knowledge to get the calling of God so
[29:59] that is my Jesus had the ability to say
[30:02] Peter come and to come because he knew
[30:05] those guys means us on the book he came
[30:08] to Coleman direc all hallelujah
[30:11] that was Jesus word made flesh call in
[30:14] DC Cyprus but he released his spirit
[30:17] because he has a man standing there
[30:21] in Jerusalem and in Israel and so on
[30:23] like that he could do so much I know
[30:25] more but when his spirit released it
[30:27] released to only hold it seven spirits
[30:31] released for the whole earth the fine
[30:34] every predestinated seed I think the
[30:38] internet have billions of people how
[30:39] much billions not millions billions
[30:41] connects it to the internet that is man
[30:44] science and technology accomplish that
[30:47] but guardo need Internet God need just
[30:50] his spirit once the Spirit began to move
[30:52] it could reach but honestly the Holy
[30:55] Ghost will drop to go across the world
[30:57] overnight overnight the entire world
[31:00] over may with a wonderful glorious
[31:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[31:06] overnight I am standing here to you
[31:09] tonight are we a few in them but that
[31:11] has nothing to do with this am nipa
[31:14] tenth power that is a ball to be
[31:16] released you your ordinary but you
[31:20] don't know what about to take place
[31:21] something creates something magnificent
[31:24] something powerful about to break out
[31:26] nothing
[31:27] fit or glory the new man could stop it
[31:30] not your pascai even stop it the most of
[31:33] the Lord had spoken it he spoke to the
[31:36] prophesy will restore that I've done
[31:38] with you you can't stop the restoration
[31:41] that blood prophesy over your life or
[31:44] glory look what I will restore to you
[31:45] the years you can't even stop that God
[31:48] promised a bumper crop go something to
[31:50] bring back the oil in the wine
[31:52] what promise will bring back the figs
[31:54] will produce in its strength that mean
[31:56] you're gonna have production
[31:57] you wouldn't be bearing it on fruitful
[31:59] but you'll have a living fate
[32:01] I'm gonna invert you live in knowledge I
[32:04] live in temperance and live in patience
[32:06] and live in Parliament's and live in
[32:08] brotherly kindness this thing is gonna
[32:10] live
[32:11] whatever I'm said the house of God will
[32:13] live again this bride she will deliver
[32:15] him the devil cutter dog Rome cutter
[32:18] tongue but God said I'm gonna restore
[32:21] your glory to God hallelujah praise God
[32:24] Oh give him some praises tonight do you
[32:28] believe this is a word for you tonight
[32:29] or glory nobody and I want to see the
[32:32] action of it in your spirit in your soul
[32:35] in your hat Peter couldn't help it
[32:39] because inspiration move upon Peter you
[32:42] may be seated praise God or glory to God
[32:45] hallelujah question Jesus that's the
[32:48] question who do men say I am some say
[32:52] there's some say that and it easy to
[32:54] talk about what people say you could
[32:57] Rara and talk whole night about what
[32:59] people talking about but when he asked
[33:02] the disciples who do you say I am they
[33:05] got caught you go all of a sudden they
[33:09] realize they don't know they just know
[33:12] he's a messiah
[33:13] he's a master teacher he's healing the
[33:15] sick this one or whatever whatever but
[33:17] they don't know who that man really is
[33:18] now all of a sudden inspiration move up
[33:20] on Peter anointing move upon Peter
[33:23] fire drop upon Peter because he's a
[33:26] channel to get inspiration because he's
[33:30] a son he's a seed he don't have the Holy
[33:34] Ghost yet but he could get revelation he
[33:37] don't have the Holy Ghost yet
[33:39] but he could be inspired he don't have
[33:41] the Holy Ghost yet but the call of God
[33:43] is upon his life that's why Jesus came
[33:45] to him and Peter shopping at channel
[33:48] toward the Christ the Son of the Living
[33:50] God and Jesus said flesh and blood did
[33:54] not reveal that to you so revelation is
[33:57] supernatural go give the Lord a shout
[33:59] revelation is not natural leverage and
[34:02] supernatural you could study that is not
[34:04] revelation that is trouble you could get
[34:06] information that's in Revelation
[34:08] revelation when the Spirit reveals it I
[34:10] went this web reveals it if conceit
[34:12] confirms it or get the Lord a shout so
[34:16] we're not talking about knowledge we're
[34:18] not talking about intellectual
[34:19] information we're talking about divine
[34:21] revelation that's why the probability's
[34:23] divinely revealed mystery troops not
[34:27] just revealed but divinely revealed not
[34:29] man interpreted not man revealed but
[34:33] divinely revealed when you hear from
[34:36] heaven or glory know God seven thunders
[34:39] will unlock the heaven when they're
[34:41] spoken by revelation revelation to speak
[34:44] this word divine revelation or glory to
[34:50] God please go
[34:53] [Music]
[34:57] I might have three something here for
[35:00] you but I Brandon he's saying here I
[35:02] feel this isn't meant for me I would I
[35:06] feel no you're welcome spirit that you
[35:08] are believer and I want you to come just
[35:10] closer to me I'm not trying to read your
[35:12] mind sir at all you don't believe that
[35:14] do you
[35:15] no cause that would be something that
[35:17] you had on your mind I pray that God
[35:19] will go back and do something that's not
[35:21] even on your mind so you wouldn't know
[35:23] he said no there's something wrong with
[35:26] you no doubt he said you wouldn't have
[35:28] gotten that prayer card you you come
[35:30] here to be prayed for you confess your
[35:32] fate by believing that he would heal you
[35:34] know what I'm trying to do now is speak
[35:36] to you to contact your human spirit your
[35:40] feet you see your feet operate this gift
[35:44] your feet brings it down on me so the
[35:50] Prophet was going down but discernment
[35:52] to activate the faith because the faith
[35:54] is what gonna bring this thing down on
[35:55] him Oh
[35:58] not a one thanks be to Allah Jesus
[36:00] Christ who brought again the Spirit of
[36:02] God and the resurrected Christ who is
[36:04] present tonight to heal all that is in
[36:07] need he is here friends I have no way of
[36:10] bringing him to you only your feet
[36:12] brings him present I want to show you
[36:18] the importance of you having feet
[36:20] sitting there and having the expectation
[36:23] sitting there you're not just going to
[36:25] hear the preacher expand and hear a
[36:27] teacher teach an information you here to
[36:30] be a participant here to get in the
[36:32] spirit
[36:33] we hear they receive from God Peter was
[36:36] one of the disciples but Peter got
[36:37] involved he got caught up somehow he
[36:39] gets in touch channel where the Spirit
[36:41] could drop down upon him and you can set
[36:44] up at the Christ so you could get in
[36:46] that channel because understand this all
[36:47] these diapers were here all of them or
[36:50] call but Peter drop into my channel that
[36:53] the father opened up to him or gets all
[36:56] together sitting in front of you wins
[36:58] but you a new who oh I decided you
[37:00] forget that you are individual
[37:03] revelation doesn't come as a group
[37:05] there's no group revelation or cancel or
[37:07] - oh I want to say that again there is
[37:09] no group
[37:09] it's a personal revelation that Christ
[37:13] has revealed himself to you and Jesus
[37:16] went on further said upon this rock I
[37:18] will build my church before the
[37:20] Democratic show-off the church because
[37:23] he kind of get what's in your heart
[37:25] yo what's in your heart is sealed he
[37:28] cannot go there because only the word
[37:30] could discern the thoughts and intents
[37:32] of that they'd ever kind of discern the
[37:34] intents of your heart or you should be
[37:38] shouting on that one without like that
[37:40] they're rotten listen to see what you're
[37:41] speaking he don't know what's in your
[37:45] heart it's only when you speak he said
[37:48] yeah what'd you say God wasn't given
[37:53] every revelation of the serpent was
[37:54] getting a revelation so when I serpent
[37:56] talk to Eve what did God say oh I don't
[37:57] know he's not talking to me
[38:00] and then he saw it fit to explain and
[38:04] explained and explained and she she
[38:06] still didn't have a revelation because
[38:09] if even a revelation she never explained
[38:12] she will tell that so don't go and ask
[38:14] him yourself because I get it from my
[38:16] husband my husband got the word and when
[38:20] I came for I didn't know nothing about
[38:22] actually my husband reveal that and
[38:24] spoke that and unsold that God said we
[38:27] can eat of every she but not that one so
[38:30] if you want to know what actually go and
[38:31] get the one who revealed that comes in a
[38:32] nut tree go to them that sell go and buy
[38:36] go and get the anointing then you're
[38:39] sitting on just long enough where is the
[38:42] fire where is the oil where is the figs
[38:46] that's what the Prophet came to turn on
[38:48] expect back to the faith because the
[38:50] faith will pull down the power the faith
[38:53] will pull down the fire the faith is not
[38:55] just pork in word for 40 years
[38:56] mechanics only one day we're gonna wake
[39:00] up and said you don't even have to need
[39:02] you know the mechanics one day going to
[39:04] turn a key and when that heat turn you
[39:07] don't have to know knee mechanics we
[39:09] just read in the time and season they
[39:11] get the same pay
[39:14] what glory love God I don't want nothing
[39:18] less than my pizza hat don't tell me
[39:20] they say what we have had preaching

[47:13] that's an error god help those who can't
[47:16] help themselves if you could help
[47:20] yourself you wouldn't need God's help
[47:22] but God has mercy on those who cannot
[47:25] help themselves

[52:24] Spirit told him pick up the pen and
[52:26] write that put that dog in the last day
[52:30] is the problem come to the headstone
[52:32] will be a super Church a super is I seen
[52:36] there's the headstone
[52:38] and apparently so much like him there
[52:40] will be in his very image so the image
[52:42] of God will be back on the earth
[52:45] restored first created image these are
[52:54] atoms before we go back to even see
[52:59] unseen atom again but not a fallen one
[53:02] atom again before we go back to Eden
[53:05] Adam again in Satan's Eden and I'm again
[53:10] conquer him again being backed up let us
[53:16] make man and have dominion and Bertram
[53:18] came to reveal what that man consists of
[53:20] and once that man is restored the
[53:23] connection the plugin diploma reconnect
[53:26] back all the wires connect back and
[53:29] there's a main switch that be written on
[53:31] there's a brick and god flip that switch
[53:34] and the power because all the current
[53:36] runway all the Audion lines run right he
[53:39] could flip the switch and then if count
[53:41] for intro yeah is my spirit flowing
[53:46] freely okay the Lord some praise it so
[53:53] no 540 legends the Holy Spirit the would
[53:57] doing some why irony on your life
[54:00] because when we fell all the wiring and
[54:03] plumbing meant of key so we couldn't
[54:05] have that channel of the flow of God and
[54:08] all this gospel to clean and justify and
[54:10] sanctified is the makeup preparation but
[54:14] you could become a channel of God that
[54:16] the spirit could flow through and when
[54:18] God did get a channel he could do so
[54:20] much then Devils can move until they
[54:23] find somebody to move a teeth and spirit
[54:25] upon a man make him a thief murder and
[54:28] spirit come upon a man or cultural
[54:30] spiritual
[54:31] come upon people make them and do a
[54:33] certain thing but when the Spirit of the
[54:35] Lord comes upon my hair
[54:37] I will dance like David dancing I would
[54:40] thin men like something Taconic it and
[54:43] lift it up and put it away where is the
[54:45] Spirit of God was upon Samson the string
[54:47] of gold upon Gideon the spirit upon Jeff
[54:50] died upon Samson upon or upon Moses upon

[55:09] that's why he built that temple but
[55:12] these guys were in Jude with the power

[1:14:32] stature not somebody gets converted
[1:14:35] tonight and tomorrow they go and preach
[1:14:36] the gospel we grew up in the mannered in
[1:14:39] the de stature of Christ Elijah was
[1:14:41] tired he was weary and God giving my
[1:14:44] rest under a juniper tree Quran says God
[1:14:47] tell him eat because a journey is very
[1:14:50] hard he said oh how we need in this

[1:27:13] and all these countries are different
[1:27:15] cultures and environments and
[1:27:16] backgrounds going past all like that
[1:27:18] because all them culture from them was
[1:27:20] just a flashback so you might not eat
[1:27:25] this kind of food that they eat here or
[1:27:26] wherever it is it's not the food making

[1:28:16] my mind or glory about this man who only
[1:28:21] win by inspiration watch and that's the
[1:28:24] way the church if it's in order second
[1:28:25] order it's got the mechanics ready it
[1:28:27] only needs the dynamics tonight if we
[1:28:30] get the mechanics ready get our hearts
[1:28:32] right the things that we can do that's
[1:28:34] the mechanics the things that you can do

[1:28:49] only what that's why he said no minutes
[1:28:53] like a beggar revival somebody want to
[1:28:56] pray that run a beef and plate itself
[1:28:57] they cap in the Reviver you had a come
[1:29:00] on you people I pay you ought to get

[1:29:10] deceived they were here with an
[1:29:12] awareness that you have to be restored

[1:29:20] my you understand that not if this
[1:29:23] evening
[1:29:24] you're walking here like you don't know
[1:29:25] who you are like a confused like you
[1:29:27] have amnesia you're coming here like Eve
[1:29:31] restored that God will be proudly
[1:29:33] deceive he said this Eve will not be
[1:29:36] like that first easy
[1:29:37] he will not be deceived he couldn't
[1:29:39] stand so say there's a whisper and hiss
[1:29:47] hiss he didn't even fall at all he said
[1:29:52] isn't it is to be spirit what what and
[1:29:55] only God could do that that is the drop
[1:29:57] into your heart defeatist a I am now

[1:30:01] to God and he caught my inspiration he
[1:30:04] had a way of moving and self out and
[1:30:06] letting God move in he know what he was
[1:30:10] justified it was a gift it was a gift
[1:30:13] for the people not for job but for the
[1:30:14] people and that's what all divine gifts
[1:30:16] are to see of God people music they're
[1:30:20] ready to close job was the prophet of
[1:30:25] this day and the only thing Joe
[1:30:27] redundant God had done to job was always
[1:30:30] giving wisdom on his word and
[1:30:31] inspiration he could get no inspiration
[1:30:33] but he knows all his mechanics he had
[1:30:36] offered them an offering he had done
[1:30:38] everything you know to do was right and
[1:30:40] he couldn't get the wood from God and
[1:30:42] the devil couldn't move in you know that
[1:30:45] job couldn't hear from God but they
[1:30:48] never could move that is when you have a
[1:30:52] rock that's just when you have divine
[1:30:54] revelation you can hear from God but the
[1:30:57] devil can move you to believe him recap
[1:30:59] less you believe them when it's all back
[1:31:01] you believe them when you can help
[1:31:03] yourself even even when there seemed to
