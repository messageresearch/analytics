[33:08] to the word portion of service now so if
[33:10] you have your Bibles we'll just take it
[33:12] real quickly uh to a few portion of
[33:14] scriptures that we have tonight amen so
[33:18] we thank God for his love and we see the
[33:20] end of the air finally coming to its
[33:23] closing chapters and so we know that it
[33:26] has has been his grace and mercy amen
[33:29] that has brought us this far so we
[33:31] certainly thankful to God
[33:34] Amen praise
[33:36] God and um so this last Wednesday night
[33:39] service of the year and just praying
[33:42] that we God out with a shout amen
[33:43] tonight so I have a thought here and
[33:46] it's these scriptures now that we'll
[33:48] read as we get a context for it Joel
[33:51] chapter 2 uh we also want to read from
[33:54] Isaiah chapter 40 and last lastly our
[33:57] scripture for this evening would be
[34:00] Ephesians 6
[34:02] okay
[34:05] um now I was inclined to
[34:10] read the whole scripture here in Joel
[34:14] because
[34:16] um I was inspired by the Joel Army
[34:19] scripture here how he talks about in
[34:22] Joel 2 and um I know it's a lengthy
[34:24] scripture so we'll try to get through it
[34:27] um we'll just see how it goes amen so we
[34:30] just have it as Joel 2 and we'll just
[34:32] read through all right so from verse
[34:34] one it says blow ye the trumpet in Zion
[34:38] sound an alarm in my Holy Mountain let
[34:41] all the inhabitants of the land tremble
[34:44] for the day of the Lord cometh for it is
[34:47] nigh at hand a day of darkness and of
[34:50] gloominess a day of clouds and thick
[34:53] Darkness as the morning spread upon the
[34:55] mountains or great great people and a
[34:58] strong there hath not been ever the like
[35:01] neither shall there be anymore after it
[35:04] even to the years of many generations a
[35:07] fire devoureth before them and behind
[35:09] them a flame burneth the land is as the
[35:12] Garden of Eden before them and behind
[35:14] them a desolate Wilderness yay and
[35:16] nothing shall Escape them the appearance
[35:19] of them is as the appearance of horses
[35:21] and as Horsemen so shall they run like
[35:24] the noise of Chariots on the tops of
[35:27] mountain shall they leap like the noise
[35:29] of a flame of fire that devoureth the
[35:32] stubble and as a strong people set in
[35:35] battle array before their face the
[35:37] people shall be much pained all faces
[35:40] Shall Gather Blackness they shall run
[35:43] like Mighty Men they shall climb the
[35:45] wall like Men of War they shall March
[35:47] everyone on his ways they shall not
[35:50] break their ranks neither shall one
[35:52] trust one another they shall walk
[35:54] everyone in his path and in other words
[35:58] everyone in their place amen not
[36:00] Crossing each other's path praise God
[36:02] but knowing amen the the the road that
[36:04] they set upon amen and they when they
[36:06] fall upon the sword they shall not be
[36:08] wounded they shall run to and fro in the
[36:11] city they shall run upon the wall they
[36:14] shall climb upon the houses they shall
[36:16] enter into the Windows like a thief the
[36:18] Earth shall Quake before them the heaven
[36:21] shall tremble the sun and the moon shall
[36:23] be dark and the Stars shall withdraw
[36:25] their Shining and the Lord will utter
[36:28] his voice before his army Hallelujah for
[36:30] his captain is very great and for he is
[36:33] strong that executed his word for the
[36:36] day of the Lord is great and very
[36:38] terrible and who can abide it therefore

[51:00] for the word of God to come to you oh to
[51:04] the foolishness of preaching to what
[51:06] seem heretical to the world to a way
[51:09] called heresy God made a way to get you
[51:13] wherever you was laying in the Baptist
[51:16] Church laying in the Methodist Church
[51:18] laying in the Catholic church or
[51:19] wherever you was out in the world doing

[51:29] affect you oh spiritually speaking
[51:32] hallelujah oh
[51:35] Hallelujah isn't that
[51:37] right faith faith is not
[51:42] belief there's actually a difference

[51:53] right or I believe in it it enough to
[51:56] give life to it isn't that right amen
[51:59] you can do that in your mental praise
[52:01] God but faith is not logical faith has
[52:04] no reasoning behind it there's no reason
[52:06] why it doesn't make sense but something
[52:09] went past your flesh something went past
[52:12] your human Spirit something went down in
[52:14] the circuit of your heart oh Hallelujah
[52:17] and you believe because you got in
[52:20] contact with something that you know
[52:22] what greater than you oh your mind
[52:24] couldn't conceive
[52:25] oh but there something happening on the
[52:27] inside inside inside your heart inside
[52:31] your soul some change begin to take
[52:33] place it's not rational it's not
[52:36] reasonable it's not logical it's Faith

[53:15] up in the morning why you choose to put
[53:17] on your clothes why you choose to come

[53:21] something on the inside the devil didn't
[53:23] put it there and the devil can't take it
[53:25] away it might not be rational to drive
[53:28] all the way to sangri Grande but there's
[53:30] something in your soul something in your
[53:33] heart that's crying out for life and

[56:06] great word test oh Hallelujah isn't that
[56:09] right can you stay with that word and we
[56:11] see throughout all the years many have
[56:14] fallen away many have fallen Away by
[56:16] Creeds by Dogers by interpretations by
[56:18] intellect many are Falling Away by their
[56:20] feelings Falling Away by their ideas
[56:23] Falling Away by how they think their
[56:24] things as supposed to be there's a way
[56:26] that seem it right unto a man but the
[56:28] end thereof is death you cannot walk
[56:30] according to your feelings the Bible
[56:33] does not exonerate anybody who walks
[56:35] according to feelings you've got to walk
[56:37] according to your faith oh somebody say
[56:40] Amen oh hallelujah what God put inside
[56:44] of you not even your human reasoning not
[56:46] even your human beliefs or what you
[56:48] perceive as value no no no it's a
[56:51] spiritual Faith that's got to come into
[56:53] you and say I believe believe oh
[56:56] Hallelujah thou artart the Jesus Son of
[56:58] the Living God Thou Art the Christ son
[57:01] of the Living God that's not human
[57:02] belief that's divine revelation strikes
[57:06] your soul and reveals a written word and
[57:09] shows you amen who is that up there who
[57:13] is that speaking to you who is that
[57:15] anointing you what is that you're
[57:17] feeling amen oh Hallelujah glory to God

[57:37] they cannot Prevail against Revelation
[57:41] oh because Revelation is prevailing
[57:43] power oh do you believe it amen praise
[57:46] God Amen GL sometimes I was looking at
[57:49] optical illusions it's a very
[57:51] interesting thing I don't know if you
[57:53] ever seen one praise God but there are
[57:55] optical illusions there are things that
[57:57] are drawn or created in a certain way
[57:59] that makes it look like you're seeing
[58:01] something you're not seeing praise God
[58:03] isn't that right sometimes you draw
[58:05] lines wavy like this and when you look
[58:07] at it long enough it look like the Lin's
[58:09] jumping but the lines are standing still
[58:11] but it's something your eyes is doing
[58:13] it's trying to adjust and settle on the
[58:15] picture that it is seeing and all these
[58:17] things are really to prove that what you
[58:20] sometimes what you think you're seeing
[58:21] you're not really seeing what you think
[58:23] you looking at you not really looking at
[58:26] your vision is is is is kind of cheated
[58:28] because because a natural vision is just
[58:31] your two eyes God give you praise God to
[58:33] be here on Earth and the older you get
[58:35] is the stronger your glasses will have
[58:37] to get because your eyes begin to fail
[58:39] you after a while praise God and you
[58:41] won't see as much as you were able to
[58:43] see 10 or 20 years ago praise God things
[58:46] are fading things of this world will
[58:49] fade away but we know something that
[58:50] will never pass away and that is the
[58:53] word of God hallelujah he you can't
[58:56] trust your natural eyes if you can't
[58:58] even trust your natural eyes oh
[59:00] Hallelujah to see then what are you
[59:01] really seeing oh how people see a lot of
[59:04] things people look for a lot of things
[59:06] according to the fashion of their own
[59:07] thoughts or fashion of their own minds
[59:10] but we need a people tonight that are
[59:12] willing to walk by faith that are
[59:13] willing to walk according to the word of
[59:16] God that are willing to take that word
[59:19] oh Hal and stand by it and stand upon it
[59:22] and believe it Hallelujah we regardless
[59:25] of the Dark Skies the dark skies are not
[59:27] a sign of God's disapproval and the
[59:30] bright skies are not a sign of his
[59:32] acceptance his acceptance is you and the
[59:34] Beloved oh his acceptance is when he
[59:38] pours the holy ghost into you and
[59:40] baptize you with fire that's his
[59:43] acceptance not some human intellect not
[59:45] shaking hands and joining church not a
[59:48] certificate not a business card but the
[59:51] fire of God has got to come into your
[59:53] heart and Bur burn the demons out burn
[59:56] the lust out burn the lies out burn the
[59:59] filth out and put God in a man and then
[1:00:02] you'll see the difference oh Hallelujah
[1:00:05] and until that happens then we need that
[1:00:08] group to step forward amen oh and claim
[1:00:11] their
[1:00:11] inheritance amen amen do you believe it
[1:00:15] tonight Hallelujah GL we need that group
[1:00:19] to step forward yes
[1:00:22] sir Hallelujah we live in an age
[1:00:25] now I I believe there's a cry for
[1:00:30] leadership there's a cry for
[1:00:32] leadership there's too
[1:00:35] much Madness going
[1:00:38] around there too much craziness it's too
[1:00:42] much of Flesh running around too much
[1:00:44] man running around with their own ideas
[1:00:47] of things with their own their own
[1:00:49] interpretation of life and how they
[1:00:51] think others should live and by that
[1:00:53] interpretation it dictates their
[1:00:55] decision making and it dictates the
[1:00:57] environment that they create for others
[1:00:59] Hallelujah and in most cases it's toxic
[1:01:02] because it's driven by lust of men lust
[1:01:04] for power lust for big things lust for
[1:01:07] money Lust For popularity all these
[1:01:09] things are supposed to be dead to the
[1:01:11] believer the prophet said so but it's
[1:01:13] very much alive today in the world you
[1:01:16] go out in the business World education
[1:01:17] World politics wherever it's corrupt
[1:01:19] it's ungodly pray we need leaders to
[1:01:22] step forward we need God made man we
[1:01:25] need God made women to step out of the
[1:01:28] pages of the Bible and live something on
[1:01:30] this world that'll make a difference
[1:01:33] when you walk it'll make a difference
[1:01:35] when you speak it'll make a difference
[1:01:37] when you go to work when you have
[1:01:39] conversations the rainbow of God to be
[1:01:42] flashing out of you displaying his love
[1:01:45] displaying his Beauty displaying his
[1:01:47] kindness displaying his
[1:01:49] forgiveness all these wonderful
[1:01:52] qualities of the pyramid life
[1:01:55] is what we are striving for tonight to
[1:01:58] be positionally placed to have these
[1:01:59] things in us so that we could mean
[1:02:04] something
[1:02:06] huh it'll make the difference in year
[1:02:09] and the more dark the world gets the
[1:02:11] more corrupt the world gets the more
[1:02:13] evil the world gets the more we ought to
[1:02:15] strive towards this and when this begins
[1:02:18] to shine in on us it'll be the contrast
[1:02:21] between light and darkness cuz as the
[1:02:23] world gets darker and more into their
[1:02:25] Folly and more into their foolishness we
[1:02:28] become brighter in the scatness of his
[1:02:30] glory we become shining in His image the
[1:02:33] image as of the only begotten of the
[1:02:35] father full of grace full of Truth oh
[1:02:39] can we say Amen tonight you are called
[1:02:41] to glory and to Virtue amen amen don't
[1:02:46] you forget it tonight amen so we got to
[1:02:48] do two things take the word so we are
[1:02:50] not taking the word right taking also
[1:02:52] means take up like to take up a
[1:02:54] Authority isn't that right but God's not
[1:02:57] going to hand authority to you until you
[1:02:59] have the character to take it until
[1:03:01] you're fit to take it isn't that right
[1:03:03] yes sir brother bam said God cannot send
[1:03:05] a Revival until he's got man in shape to
[1:03:09] pack that Revival until he's got man in
[1:03:11] shape to take that word and die to
[1:03:14] themselves take that word and deny their
[1:03:16] own ability take that word and deny
[1:03:19] their own lust and deny their own selves
[1:03:22] and deny what they want and what they
[1:03:23] think and die to themelves upon the
[1:03:26] cross and say God change me Lord make me
[1:03:30] more Christian make me more like you the
[1:03:32] prophet said make fit servants make
[1:03:34] better servants oh Hallelujah isn't that
[1:03:38] right we can come into His Image and his
[1:03:41] likeness oh Hallelujah but many are not
[1:03:43] asking for that a lot of people are
[1:03:45] caught up in themselves caught up in
[1:03:47] their flesh ACC on what they think and
[1:03:50] unfortunately it falls upon the leaders
[1:03:53] is is that right Hallelujah isn't that
[1:03:55] right and as the leaders do so does the
[1:03:57] environment that they create isn't not
[1:03:59] right but said a startling thing I think
[1:04:03] one of the Friday prayer meetings also
[1:04:04] we had uh uh I believe yeah to that same
[1:04:09] to that same to that same air to that
[1:04:12] same word that we need we need leaders
[1:04:14] to rise up and to
[1:04:17] claim what God is what God wants to do
[1:04:19] in this last day to live something to be
[1:04:23] like Christ before the people amen amen
[1:04:26] isn't that right okay I'm going on let's
[1:04:29] see so the devil all right so that comes

[1:04:38] hand it there you take it up pick up the
[1:04:41] word for your day your hour your season
[1:04:43] isn't that right you recognize your day
[1:04:45] and your message and handing the day is
[1:04:47] about that Authority isn't that right
[1:04:49] knowing how to correctly place that word
[1:04:51] amen isn't that right Prophet said out
[1:04:53] all the gifts so out there praise God
[1:04:55] healing delivering isn't that right one
[1:04:57] of the greatest gift is to be able to
[1:04:58] rightly divide the word isn't that right
[1:05:01] rightly divide it and that comes by
[1:05:03] Revelation and by testing training
[1:05:06] knowing what God wants to do with the
[1:05:07] word isn't that right isn't that right
[1:05:10] and that bride she'll know what God

[1:14:27] Lord that was a personal revelation to
[1:14:30] him amen nobody else they should have
[1:14:33] dreamed to was just Joseph and he was
[1:14:36] happy about it he was excited about it
[1:14:39] and on top of the fact that he was his
[1:14:41] father's favorite now God was showing
[1:14:43] things to him oh it couldn't get any
[1:14:45] worse for the Brethren it couldn't get
[1:14:47] any words for the brothers they got
[1:14:51] jealous isn't that right yes it's man of

[1:14:58] get coat with rainbow colors he get
[1:15:01] special ring special this special that
[1:15:03] prayer now your special dream oh it was
[1:15:06] just the the straw that broke the camels
[1:15:08] back Hallelujah they couldn't take it oh
[1:15:11] they were rough with anger isn't that
[1:15:13] right and when he come looking for them
[1:15:15] cuz uh the father sent for S him said go
[1:15:17] look for your brothers when he went out
[1:15:19] looking for them
[1:15:21] they they got so mad at him is you they
[1:15:23] sent to get to us to daddy boy you all
[1:15:27] people they sent to fetch us no couldn't
[1:15:30] take it anymore so they sold him away is
[1:15:32] not right we know the story now in that
[1:15:35] dream all of the grains of corn is not
[1:15:38] right bowed before the Grain in the
[1:15:40] center isn't not right and all the the
[1:15:42] Sheep sorry had had to circle around his
[1:15:44] sheath and they had bowed isn't that
[1:15:45] right all the stars had bowed he already
[1:15:47] it was already laid out in the tapestry
[1:15:49] of time what was supposed to take place
[1:15:52] um in the future amen but what he was
[1:15:56] going through that in that present
[1:15:57] moment did not look anything like the
[1:16:00] dream that he had
[1:16:02] seen isn't that right by the time he got
[1:16:05] to Piper's house he was an immigrant
[1:16:08] speaking another language in another
[1:16:10] place nobody knew him and his father
[1:16:13] couldn't speak for him either and
[1:16:15] couldn't say he was a favorite so he's
[1:16:17] supposed to be treated differently he
[1:16:18] had to work to earn his place isn't that
[1:16:22] right he had to do he had to work he had
[1:16:24] to slave just like everybody else he had
[1:16:28] to earn his keep oh hallelujah
[1:16:30] hallelujah praise that right but he had
[1:16:32] the right attitude he did the right
[1:16:34] thing and God blessed him for it oh H
[1:16:37] cuz even in the midst of that situation
[1:16:39] even though he was quite mad with his
[1:16:40] brothers I'm sure he hadn't gotten over
[1:16:42] it then took years for him to come to
[1:16:44] terms with what had happened to him the
[1:16:47] wounds were still fresh praise God when
[1:16:49] he was in Piper's house but somehow in
[1:16:51] the midst of all of that dread
[1:16:53] he found a way to have the right
[1:16:56] attitude and to do the right thing
[1:16:58] because he was trained a certain way
[1:17:01] brought up as a proper child in his
[1:17:03] father's house he knew how to work and
[1:17:05] how to help the others when he was
[1:17:06] finished with his work and when pter for
[1:17:08] saw it he was pleased give him a
[1:17:10] promotion say help them with this help
[1:17:12] them with that praise God fix this and
[1:17:14] if you know how to do that let me try a
[1:17:16] hand until all of a sudden praise God
[1:17:18] isn't that right he was doing things and
[1:17:20] getting through isn't that right is
[1:17:23] finding favor praise God Amen now he
[1:17:25] could have stayed there but that's not
[1:17:28] div Vision he could have stayed there
[1:17:30] and put his house it be fine he'd have a
[1:17:31] good job you know he could go to work
[1:17:34] and go to the market and you have a
[1:17:35] change in his pocket to get some things
[1:17:37] and put if I give him a little Chariot
[1:17:39] to drive every now and then if you need
[1:17:41] to make a run to the drugstore and
[1:17:43] everything's fine like he could stay
[1:17:45] there but that's not the vision that God
[1:17:48] have for him to be in so God had to
[1:17:51] cause some discomfort yes to get Joseph
[1:17:54] to run from that place of ease of Zion
[1:17:58] he had to cause something to happen amen
[1:18:00] is that he allowed Piper's wife to get
[1:18:02] some other thoughts concerning him we
[1:18:04] all know the story isn't that right and
[1:18:06] she and she wrongfully accused him and
[1:18:08] he ended up in prison isn't that right
[1:18:11] praise God hallelujah but even there
[1:18:13] Hallelujah God's favor his hand was
[1:18:15] still upon him oh I just admire how
[1:18:18] Joseph had the right attitude despite
[1:18:20] the situation that he ended up in he
[1:18:23] always maintained the right attitude
[1:18:26] praise God even though his word did not
[1:18:28] come that same word tried him at every
[1:18:31] point of his life it tried him here it
[1:18:33] tried him on the prison tried him in
[1:18:36] Po's house tried him on the street tried
[1:18:39] him praise God Amen and his
[1:18:40] conversations with others God had a
[1:18:42] destination for for Joseph and he
[1:18:45] himself didn't fully understand well
[1:18:48] isn't that right until one day isn't
[1:18:51] that right Butler and the baker you know
[1:18:52] the story
[1:18:53] they get the dreams and know he tells
[1:18:56] Baker well your time is up Butler well
[1:18:59] you going to be reinstated but here what
[1:19:02] when you reach back I'm so sure this
[1:19:04] dream's going to come to pass that when
[1:19:05] you get there let them know I am here
[1:19:09] remember me don't don't forget me now
[1:19:11] don't forget the guy who told you about
[1:19:13] your
[1:19:13] promotion remember me and as soon as the
[1:19:16] butler reach inside there and they give
[1:19:19] him back his keys and his apartment and
[1:19:21] his shoes and his f clothing he forgot
[1:19:24] Joseph isn't that right typical human
[1:19:27] beings oh he forgot all about he forget
[1:19:30] about prison he forget how long his bed
[1:19:32] was he forget how hard you see human
[1:19:34] beings we love to distance ourselves
[1:19:36] from pain as f as possible anything
[1:19:39] associated with pain we like to distance
[1:19:41] ourselves from it so as much as prison
[1:19:44] was distanced from the butler's mind
[1:19:45] Joseph along with the pain and
[1:19:47] everything he throw it in a box and
[1:19:49] fling it far and say leaving that behind
[1:19:52] I get back my job now fellas praise God
[1:19:54] isn't that right and poor
[1:19:57] Joseph and God allow all of that because
[1:20:00] he's trying Joseph he's trying Joseph by
[1:20:02] the word he give him Joseph could pray
[1:20:05] poured his complaint before the Lord as
[1:20:06] David said and said here I am in prison
[1:20:08] Lord this is not what you told me what
[1:20:10] is going
[1:20:11] on I'm sure there were many nights like
[1:20:14] that he spent many days like that isn't
[1:20:17] that right I think it was some years
[1:20:19] after that the Butler and the baker
[1:20:21] story was ended over praise God not
[1:20:23] right he was still in that prison pining
[1:20:25] away waiting nobody knows what for but
[1:20:29] only God and his eternal mind knows the
[1:20:31] destination he have for Joseph and he
[1:20:34] had to have a man trained to handle a
[1:20:36] level of power that he was about to
[1:20:38] place him into oh he had to have a man
[1:20:40] trained he had to have a man dried out
[1:20:44] seasoned out tested tried proven oh
[1:20:49] Hallelujah to handle this level of power
[1:20:51] you're going to give it
[1:20:53] take a humble man to get the position
[1:20:56] that Joseph had in in Pharaoh's in
[1:20:58] Pharaoh's
[1:21:01] Egypt takes a trained man you can't be
[1:21:03] flying off the handle you have to be
[1:21:05] able to handle power you have to have
[1:21:07] wisdom understanding you have to care
[1:21:10] for others looking out for others isn't
[1:21:12] that right on some have compassion
[1:21:15] forgiving others praying one for another
[1:21:18] always isn't that right take certain
[1:21:20] levels of attributes to be in the
[1:21:22] position that God wants you to be in
[1:21:24] tonight God has a destination for you
[1:21:26] but he takes you through the process of
[1:21:28] these things to bring out of the pain of
[1:21:31] your circumstance to bring out character
[1:21:33] to bring out something in you oh as you
[1:21:36] die out to yourself now you're becoming
[1:21:38] more like Christ now you begin to
[1:21:40] understand things begin to see things
[1:21:44] differently see things through his eyes
[1:21:47] not through our own praise God
[1:21:49] hallelujah I thank God that he allows us
[1:21:52] to see
[1:21:53] certain things isn't that right he
[1:21:55] allows us to he puts us in a position
[1:21:57] that we could see I love that because
[1:22:00] God could deliver you anytime you think
[1:22:02] about it this way I don't mind don't
[1:22:03] mind if I talk a little
[1:22:05] bit God puts God allows you to go
[1:22:07] through things and he could deliver you
[1:22:10] at any time you know he could just snap
[1:22:11] his finger and change the situation you
[1:22:13] know I mean this is God we're talking
[1:22:14] about he could he could just change it
[1:22:16] just like that yes but then the question
[1:22:18] we have to ask ourselves is what have we
[1:22:20] learned from the experience we went
[1:22:22] through
[1:22:23] amen he's in control he's always on the
[1:22:25] throne don't ever forget that don't ever
[1:22:27] don't think that praise God the devil
[1:22:29] like for us not to think that he's he's
[1:22:30] not in control but he is always in
[1:22:33] control the problem is us we are not in
[1:22:36] control we are the ones who are supposed
[1:22:38] to be in his hands stay but a little but
[1:22:41] we will fall we are the ones who are
[1:22:42] supposed to be so dependent on him so
[1:22:44] looking to him so praying upon Him
[1:22:47] always watching ever always and cautious
[1:22:50] with our words and with our actions and
[1:22:51] on our deeds and checking up with
[1:22:53] ourselves on the word of God to see if
[1:22:55] we're living the way we ought to live we
[1:22:57] are the ones who need to
[1:22:59] change and we are the ones who God is
[1:23:01] putting through the experience so that
[1:23:03] we could learn
[1:23:05] something cuz that is the real
[1:23:08] treasure what you've learned from the
[1:23:10] experience that God put you through what
[1:23:12] have you learned from it because if he
[1:23:14] snaps your fingers and he just change
[1:23:16] situation you jump up and say hallelujah
[1:23:18] he saved me yay big rotorious whatever
[1:23:20] whatever and you learn nothing
[1:23:23] amen amen takes time see per Perfection
[1:23:27] takes time so that's where the honing
[1:23:29] comes that's where he put you over the
[1:23:31] table and he hone you hone you hone you
[1:23:34] hone you hone you hone you and it takes
[1:23:36] a long time and he's cutting and he's
[1:23:38] shaping and every day is painful more
[1:23:41] painful than the next but he's doing
[1:23:42] something in your life you just got to
[1:23:44] sit still in love long enough for him to
[1:23:47] do his work so that when you come out on
[1:23:49] the other side you're not the same as
[1:23:51] when you went
[1:23:53] but you're perfected by
[1:23:55] Christ perfected by
[1:23:57] circumstance that he is wisdom sends
[1:24:01] your away isn't that right I think about
[1:24:04] Hannah now she come in the temple
[1:24:06] sighing and crying and weeping and
[1:24:09] burning and oh she's under pain and
[1:24:11] pressure of her Circumstance the other
[1:24:13] wife is terrorizing her she's Barren she
[1:24:16] can't bring forth a child and she's
[1:24:17] there in the temple weeping and wailing
[1:24:20] sighing and bitter isn't that right all
[1:24:23] of a sudden the priest come up to her
[1:24:24] he's not right say why you why are you
[1:24:26] crying for what's what's the problem
[1:24:28] what what's going on what are you drunk
[1:24:30] what what's what's it what's the issue
[1:24:32] then she begin to tell the story what's
[1:24:34] been going on with her and her situation
[1:24:37] she begin to pour her heart out before
[1:24:38] him and all of a sudden he give her a
[1:24:41] word he say go go no more bitter pray go
[1:24:43] in the Peace of the Lord isn't that
[1:24:45] right everything's going to be all right
[1:24:47] and the Bible said from that time she
[1:24:49] changed her attitude from that time she
[1:24:52] went no more bitter she went no more sad
[1:24:55] she took the word from the priest oh
[1:24:57] Hallelujah and she went home
[1:24:59] rejoicing now she went back to the same
[1:25:03] wife she went back to her same comrade
[1:25:05] who's still giving her trouble she's
[1:25:07] still in the same situation she's still
[1:25:08] barring she still don't have any
[1:25:10] evidence that anything is going to get
[1:25:12] better but her attitude
[1:25:15] changed she took something what' she
[1:25:17] take she took the word oh H isn't that
[1:25:20] right and the Bible said after why the
[1:25:23] Lord visited Hanah oh hallelujah
[1:25:25] hallelujah hallelujah but something in
[1:25:27] her change and that's what's got to
[1:25:29] happen to us we are resisting we're
[1:25:31] fighting we're beaten up against the
[1:25:33] line and God's trying to reel Us in and
[1:25:36] God just have us there whole in that
[1:25:38] line holding that line until you tie out
[1:25:40] until you surrender until you you
[1:25:43] realize you're hooked Line and Sinker
[1:25:45] and you can't go nowhere where you keep
[1:25:47] fighting fighting I don't want to do
[1:25:48] this I want to do this like a child
[1:25:50] praise God and God have to be there
[1:25:51] patient with you waiting because he

[1:27:28] the word isn't that right isn't that
[1:27:30] right they took the word and they had to
[1:27:33] die out to themselves and when that
[1:27:35] happened God positionally placed them
[1:27:38] gave them power and sent them out and
[1:27:40] now they were able to hand it there amen
[1:27:42] speak the truth and love they were able
[1:27:44] to hand it there display power and
[1:27:46] anointing and presence but it's because

[1:28:00] their humanness and crushed their their
[1:28:02] whole pride and arrogance and everything

[1:29:53] interpretation isn't that right praise
[1:29:55] God hallelujah isn't that right and what
[1:29:56] we' had in this message has been what we
[1:29:58] call an misinformation
[1:30:02] campaign that word has been tossed

[1:30:55] see so we've got misinformation campaign
[1:30:57] crafted by Satan these are my words it
[1:31:00] to deceive the people away from
[1:31:02] receiving the holy ghost from adding to
[1:31:04] their faith virtue knowledge and so
[1:31:05] forth like isn't that right the B uh
[1:31:07] Prophet said here Christ in the mystery
[1:31:08] of God revealed he said God is known by
[1:31:10] Simplicity of revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:31:13] to the most illiterate person see not
[1:31:15] your theology it's the revelation of
[1:31:18] Jesus Christ he said and Upon This Rock
[1:31:20] I'll build my church
[1:31:22] no other rocks are accepted no other
[1:31:24] things are accepted no other Roman Rock
[1:31:27] no other Protestant Rock no other school
[1:31:29] no other nothing but on exactly the
[1:31:32] revelation of Jesus Christ through the
[1:31:34] new birth he borns it in there and he
[1:31:37] injects his own life and your life is
[1:31:40] gone see what I mean now can't of your
[1:31:42] life jumping up fighting against God's
[1:31:44] life he's got to be able to inject his
[1:31:45] life into you your life goes out and his
[1:31:48] life comes in by these seven things
[1:31:51] isn't that right amen and the life of
[1:31:53] Christ is projecting itself through you
[1:31:56] with the preeminence to the people that
[1:31:58] they see the very life and works and
[1:31:59] signs and wonders that he did is doing
[1:32:02] the same thing through you Prophet said
[1:32:05] outside of that the rest is not even
[1:32:07] call to it at all oh my Hallelujah see
[1:32:11] what I mean now got to meet God's
[1:32:13] requirements Hallelujah isn't that right
[1:32:15] got to be born again got to go through
[1:32:17] place of trying got to be positionally
[1:32:20] placed then he sets in the Church some
[1:32:22] Apostles some are prophets some pastors
[1:32:24] teachers evangelist for the Perfection
[1:32:25] of the Saints praise God isn't that
[1:32:26] right Hallelujah then the whole thing
[1:32:28] begins to unfold when we come into God's
[1:32:30] program when we come God's provided way
[1:32:34] oh Hallelujah do you believe it amen all
[1:32:36] right outside of that it's not even
[1:32:38] called right see say said Watch God's
[1:32:40] greater unfolding he said and by lack of
[1:32:42] this Revelation is why we have so many
[1:32:45] different divisions among us because
[1:32:47] they didn't take the word they took
[1:32:49] something else they took their
[1:32:51] interpretting of what they thought it
[1:32:52] was and messed the whole picture up
[1:32:55] unfortunately isn't that right my lack
[1:32:57] of Revelation that's why we have so many
[1:32:59] divisions among us and so much mockery
[1:33:01] and so forth so much division among us
[1:33:03] because the people lacked that
[1:33:05] Revelation see they lack that Revelation
[1:33:09] the teachers Prophet say so he rested
[1:33:12] that responsibility of giving a correct
[1:33:15] Revelation upon the teachers cuz once
[1:33:17] the leadership is messed up it trickles
[1:33:19] all the way down pray God it affects the
[1:33:22] group the community the church the
[1:33:23] families you see so it starts with
[1:33:26] leadership amen so God wants a right
[1:33:29] leaders in place isn't that right praise
[1:33:31] God Amen all right my he said that group
[1:33:34] okay so let's talk about that group so
[1:33:36] today we believe that there's a group
[1:33:37] being prepared by the word of God
[1:33:39] they're being trained to take that word
[1:33:41] and hand it there with authority and
[1:33:42] power Prophet said here's the only hope
[1:33:44] I have this morning to wind up my
[1:33:45] message is while Samson was bound a new
[1:33:48] shock of hair growed out he said God

[1:35:21] members of this glorious church that God
[1:35:23] is raising up in the last day oh it's
[1:35:26] made up of individuals because the Holy
[1:35:28] Ghost pours out upon individuals and he
[1:35:31] fits you into the headstone and you
[1:35:33] become a member of the machine of his
[1:35:35] body and the and the Dynamics Hallelujah
[1:35:38] sweeps over you praise God and brings
[1:35:40] the mechanics to life brings it all
[1:35:42] praise second Peter 1 14-7 brings it to
[1:35:44] life in you praise now become a living

[1:35:51] do you believe it tonight my God that's
[1:35:54] what it's been about
[1:35:56] amen it's the rising of the sun Prophet
[1:35:59] said there's been churches churches
[1:36:00] Brides brides churches churches Brides
[1:36:02] but there's got to come one musician can
[1:36:04] come get ready but there's got to come
[1:36:05] one Hallelujah there's got to come a
[1:36:07] real bride yes sir there must come one
[1:36:10] that's not only got the mechanics but
[1:36:12] the Dynamics of it that makes the church
[1:36:14] live move in the power of his
[1:36:17] resurrection and here the prophet said
[1:36:19] until we come to that place
[1:36:22] until we find that place he said what
[1:36:24] good does it do to polish the hubs what
[1:36:26] good does it do to give our fael for
[1:36:28] some s simonized job when there's no
[1:36:31] Dynamics in it no matter how the
[1:36:34] mechanics prove to be right there's got
[1:36:36] to be Dynamics to make it work amen amen
[1:36:41] hallelujah hallelujah not just the word
[1:36:42] only but the power of the spirit
[1:36:45] demonstrations of the holy spirit that
[1:36:47] makes that word live that proves to the
[1:36:49] world that what we believe
[1:36:51] is Right praise God Amen that is God's
[1:36:54] word Hall that we're able to take that
[1:36:56] word all these years and now we can hand
[1:36:58] it there we could speak the truth in
[1:37:01] love we could place it correctly oh and
[1:37:04] say this is that that the prophet Joel
[1:37:06] spoke of this is that that the prophet
[1:37:08] Malachi for spoke of Amen isn't that
[1:37:10] right this is it here this is the
[1:37:12] Fulfillment oh hallelujah hallelujah and
[1:37:15] there's going to be a group that's
[1:37:16] raised up for such a time as this to
[1:37:19] manifest that word isn't that right oh
[1:37:22] my that's what proved it he said that's
[1:37:24] what Easter proved he said he wasn't
[1:37:26] only the word he was God himself the
[1:37:28] Dynamics in the word that made the body
[1:37:30] of Christ that was cold stiff and dead
[1:37:32] in the grave shake to life and raise
[1:37:34] again isn't that right so it wasn't just
[1:37:36] the body but there was a life in there
[1:37:37] is there the life behind the name that
[1:37:40] made the demons trouble that made the
[1:37:41] body raise up praise God the secret was
[1:37:43] a life oh Hallelujah is not right and
[1:37:45] the secret is the life today the Life of
[1:37:48] Christ in you amen is not right by the
[1:37:50] seven Thunder praise God word life in
[1:37:52] you is what raises you up is what will
[1:37:54] raise that cold church tonight praise
[1:37:57] God to newness of Life praise God
[1:37:58] because you could take that word and
[1:38:00] hand it there praise God Amen oh my oh
[1:38:03] all right let me hurry up here I am he
[1:38:05] that was dead so dead Till The Sun said
[1:38:08] he was dead the moon said he was dead
[1:38:09] the Stars say he was dead all nature
[1:38:11] said he was dead and now the whole world
[1:38:13] has to recognize Prophet said that he is
[1:38:15] alive again because he raised it up
[1:38:18] isn't that right he was not only
[1:38:19] mechanics God's word but he was the
[1:38:22] Dynamics to prove it isn't that right I
[1:38:25] love this part he said here you can
[1:38:26] pleas something softly he said until
[1:38:27] that church becomes both Dynamics and
[1:38:30] mechanics and the spirit of God that
[1:38:31] moved him to do all the things that he
[1:38:33] did he said he uh uh he hit on 16
[1:38:36] cylinders he said so will the bride he
[1:38:39] said amen for he said St John 14:12 he
[1:38:41] that believeth on me the works that I do
[1:38:43] shall you do also I give him a charge of
[1:38:46] my Dynamics in his mechanics and the
[1:38:49] world will not be able to to withstand
[1:38:51] it oh hallelujah hallelujah praise God
[1:38:54] is not right he said uh I'll raise him
[1:38:56] up in the last day is not right he said
[1:38:58] you could scream you could shout you can
[1:38:59] jump all down you want to and deny this
[1:39:01] word he said it won't do any good you
[1:39:04] have to take that word and you have to
[1:39:07] hand it there he said you're just
[1:39:08] cranking around the Pistons if that's
[1:39:09] the case got the spark got the spark
[1:39:11] here to fire but no gasoline to fired by
[1:39:14] it Prophet said it will only work as
[1:39:16] they come together amen he said one will
[1:39:19] sit still and the other will go up
[1:39:22] that'll prove the difference isn't that
[1:39:24] right between those who can take the
[1:39:26] word and those who can't take it isn't
[1:39:28] that right oh my the only thing that
[1:39:30] there is see yet they might they might
[1:39:32] both look alike they both claim to be
[1:39:34] churches both claim to be bride but one
[1:39:36] has the mechanics and Dynamics and
[1:39:38] brings it to pass of what he said is the
[1:39:41] truth isn't that right oh hallelujah
[1:39:43] hallelujah isn't that right glory to God
