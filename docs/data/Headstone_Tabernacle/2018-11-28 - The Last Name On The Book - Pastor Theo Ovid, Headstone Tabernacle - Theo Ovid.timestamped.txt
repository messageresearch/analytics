[12:07] what one day I guess a better banner use
[12:09] a Christian why he had a correct
[12:14] behavior his I can remember story one
[12:17] time man who was a newspaper publisher
[12:22] and he decided to go on the streets and
[12:24] buy one of his papers and woman who was
[12:27] selling papers was so terrible towards
[12:29] him and whatnot and the man's and
[12:30] somebody noticed that he brought the
[12:32] papers and asking but why you tolerate
[12:35] that he's I don't allow people's behave
[12:37] an action that to change the attitude
[12:39] that I have he was in control he was in
[12:42] charge it all was his newspaper is what
[12:45] ha ha haven't makin a living at the side
[12:46] of the road selling the paper that she
[12:48] was carrying all and carrying on and
[12:49] caring but he didn't let it affect him
[12:51] that is when you're getting mature that
[12:54] is when he gets in write them the Bible

[15:32] Man set free is free indeed Oh glory to
[15:37] God from the third seal when that last

[16:25] slain and raised again or sitting on the
[16:26] throne and back in behind the tree like
[16:29] this in the season for all those souls
[16:32] that would come so the intercessory work
[16:35] of the lamb was waiting until these
[16:38] souls come in then when the last one was
[16:41] here it was completed God still held the
[16:45] book of redemption who was in prison
[16:48] under the sixth seal there were trumpets
[16:50] open this one quickly he had left the
[16:52] mercy seat his work of redemption was
[16:54] finished he came forth and took the book
[16:56] on the right hand of him that sat upon
[16:57] the throne and time was no more and
[16:59] admittedly I angel appeared you see in
[17:02] this book here we go was what was
[17:05] redeemed so he put all those names to be
[17:10] redeemed in a book and sealed it that

[18:06] Laurel everything that he has redeemed
[18:08] was written in that book and all sorry
[18:12] all that he died for was written in the
[18:14] book and he could not leave his military
[18:16] seat until he had thoroughly redeemed
[18:19] and he couldn't redeem it at the cross
[18:21] because they were predestinated in the
[18:23] Lamb's Book of Life you have to stay on
[18:25] and make intercession until the last
[18:28] person was finished that's why God is
[18:30] merciful that's why God is gracious
[18:32] that's Mike Warren so forgiving because

[19:05] globe we don't know who is you I have a
[19:08] book to take off people name or cross on
[19:09] anybody name don't know who is all but
[19:11] you see I got the father given to me if
[19:13] you know your name is on that book you
[19:16] have a writer singing show until God
[19:18] praises I don't care what problem is
[19:21] going to that have nothing with you
[19:23] praise and I'm giving God glory I look
[19:25] at the doctors give up on you
[19:26] that has nothing very good doctor say
[19:28] yeah one more week
[19:30] give God praise tonight because God
[19:33] could cancel all of that and change all
[19:35] that but a man say Redemption only come
[19:53] when the Redeemer died they were
[19:57] potentially under the blood of lambs not
[19:59] the Redeemer had not redeemed yet until
[20:01] the Redeemer came
[20:02] John look around here sat on the throne
[20:04] with the book in his hand have been
[20:07] seated with seven seas and the whole
[20:08] plan of redemption was in it it has been
[20:12] lost by the foot by the human race Adam
[20:14] I knew and it went back where season
[20:17] couldn't take it he just calls himself
[20:18] to lose it and where did the book go to
[20:20] didn't belong to the human race the
[20:22] blessings didn't belong there here the
[20:24] human race has lost it it went back in
[20:26] the hands of the original owner that is
[20:28] why the voice said who can take the book
[20:29] who is will so the book of Revelation is
[20:31] a real mysterious book that book
[20:33] witnesses before the function of the
[20:34] world who is what is take the book until
[20:36] loosely seven seals no human could take
[20:38] it no more special Pope as Bishop
[20:40] Minister so called faithful pastor
[20:43] probably not no I'm not wanna could take
[20:45] the book anyways Rascals
[20:46] O'Hara's got to take that book the Kami
[20:48] look upon a book no human could take
[20:50] that book but a human had to be the
[20:52] Redeemer a kinsman redeemer one her back
[20:55] into mankind is not right so the world
[20:57] had become flesh and as old Jesus pick
[20:59] up this robot flesh to become the
[21:00] kinsman redeemer the horn take the book
[21:03] and we didn't you and I and he could
[21:04] only access the book to Calvary all
[21:07] glory to God true death or glory price

[30:32] before the foundation of the world here
[30:35] comes the lamb watch him oh praise the
[30:38] name of the Lord
[30:40] the lamb came for what he had redeemed
[30:44] so it's almost like if his past tense so
[30:48] you're not just gonna be justified as
[30:49] that it will be redeemed that means you
[30:51] will be conformed to the image of Jesus
[30:53] Christ so forget your present image
[30:55] right know that you can handle your own
[30:57] self when you look you skill at you you
[31:02] can handle you you are too much for you
[31:04] and yet there's a prophecy hanging over
[31:07] you that's you you deceive you wanna be
[31:11] conformed to the image of his son Obion
[31:14] you are predestinated so that that means
[31:18] it is predetermined that you won't
[31:20] become that not delicate stop it nothing
[31:24] past nothing present nothing future
[31:26] withstanding this week what could stop
[31:29] William Rand I'm coming for when the
[31:30] Bible prophesy behold I send you Elijah
[31:32] his drunken father his drinking parents
[31:35] or family not even the family condition
[31:37] could stop it
[31:38] or give the Lord a shout sometimes we
[31:41] make so much excuses about environment
[31:43] you may be seated
[31:43] whether I'm in Argentina that African
[31:46] man let's leave when they wanted to buy
[31:49] him this is does he eat different no
[31:50] does he sleep different no but I want
[31:53] I'm not going to sell him why because I
[31:55] understand the story this man health
[31:57] way back in Africa his father is the
[32:00] king of the tribe and he knows he's the
[32:04] son of a king
[32:05] that leaves three on the floor doesn't
[32:07] affect his son or his revelation that
[32:10] he's a prince and I'm saying when you
[32:12] get that your condition where they are
[32:14] money where they have roof where they
[32:16] have morals when it rather better sleep
[32:17] on that doesn't change who you are or
[32:20] glow because who you are is not
[32:22] subjected by the condition along you or
[32:24] glory lily is always a lily but they
[32:27] pressured about the mock under my eye
[32:29] will tire sweep down all trash in the
[32:31] muck
[32:32] but the lily keep pushing up what kind
[32:33] of full coming on that river but the
[32:35] lily keep pushing up pushing up pushing
[32:38] up that flower gonna come to the very
[32:39] top
[32:40] Oh hallelujah praise God alright in the
[32:44] book he's coming to receive what he has
[32:47] redeemed oh my hallelujah

[32:56] never died in happens haphazard way he
[32:58] come for a purpose that purpose it will
[33:00] fulfill the commandment of God that he
