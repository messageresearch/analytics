[20:57] [Music]
[21:11] empty
[21:13] [Music]
[21:15] space. If
[21:17] not, let us bow our heads. Father, this
[21:19] is our testimony this morning, where
[21:22] would we be this morning but for your
[21:24] amazing grace? Let us shine light in our
[21:27] path that we could see where to walk in
[21:30] a dark and terrible hour. Father, we
[21:33] bless your name and we thank you for
[21:35] evening light. We thank you for the
[21:38] light of the gospel. We thank you for
[21:40] 20th century prophet that you sent to us
[21:43] before the terrible day of the Lord. Oh,
[21:45] we appreciate your mercy and your grace
[21:48] extended to us. We wretched, miserable,
[21:51] but your love Lord reached down to pick
[21:54] us up out of the miry clay. Father, we
[21:58] bless you. We invite you in our midst to
[22:00] have the preeminences, have the
[22:02] oversight. Look into our lives and God
[22:05] may not leave you the same way we came,
[22:07] but may you visit us in a special way.
[22:11] In the name of Jesus, we bless your
[22:13] wonderful name. And father, I pray you
[22:16] visit Morin Mitchell in a special way
[22:17] also with your healing, virtue, and
[22:19] touch. In Jesus name we ask it. Amen.
[22:22] You may be seated. Oh, pray. Keep on
[22:24] playing verse the song. Where would I
[22:26] be? That's my testimony.
[22:28] I don't know about you, but that's my
[22:29] testimony. I don't know where I will be,
[22:32] but for the grace of God. You love him
[22:34] this morning.
[22:36] Oh, I don't know about you, but I come
[22:37] here to
[22:40] worship. How many come here to worship
[22:42] this
[22:44] [Music]
[22:47] morning? Hallelujah. While you sit in
[22:50] your seat, just think about
[22:52] him. Meditate upon his love. Meditate
[22:54] about his grace. Meditate about his
[22:57] supernatural presence and power. Amen.
[23:00] Amen. Thank you, musicians. Amen. Where
[23:02] would I be? Where would we be this
[23:04] morning?
[23:06] If grace places us where we are, who are
[23:09] we to knock somebody out, beat somebody
[23:13] up, sit down on somebody's head, walk on
[23:17] somebody's back, curse somebody.
[23:20] Hallelujah. And we are only where we are
[23:21] but the grace of God.
[23:24] We are in the palm of his hands. If you
[23:26] move it, we fall. So be careful. You're
[23:29] in the palm of his hands. If you shift
[23:31] it, you're going to fall. That's right.
[23:32] So, you are here by the grace of God.
[23:38] [Applause]
[23:40] Do you know what a revival is? A revival
[23:43] is a move of God in power.
[23:48] Amen. Not man moving. Hallelujah.
[23:52] God moving. Amen. Amen. That's what the
[23:55] prophet said. A revival is what? Say it
[23:57] after me. A move. A move of God
[24:01] in power. In power, not in talk,
[24:04] in power. In power. Power to cast out
[24:07] devils. Power to heal the sick. Power
[24:10] for sinners to come at the altar. Power
[24:13] people around the altar without even
[24:15] making an altar call. That's a move of
[24:17] God. Amen. Not a man move but a God
[24:21] move. And when God decide to move, no
[24:24] man could stop him. No man could hinder
[24:27] him. When God decide to move on your
[24:29] life or your family life, nothing going
[24:32] to stop it because your season has come.
[24:37] Your hour has come. And when your hour
[24:40] come, nobody could change that, stop
[24:42] that, rearrange that. But God bless. No
[24:46] man can curse. Amen.
[24:49] Oh, I am happy this morning. Where would
[24:53] I be? Where would you be? But for the
[24:55] grace of God, you have something to
[24:58] shout about. You have activity in your
[25:00] limbs. You could still stand up. You
[25:03] could still raise your hands. You can
[25:05] still shake your neck a little bit.
[25:07] Praise God. Hallelujah. Praise
[25:11] God.
[25:13] Glory. Hallelujah. You still have
[25:16] something to shout about.
[25:19] Sit down a minute.
[25:22] You may have failed God. You may have
[25:24] sinned. But I don't think you have
[25:26] committed the unpardonable sin. So there
[25:29] is still room for blood. There is still
[25:32] room for redemption. There is still room
[25:34] for restoration. I don't think you will
[25:37] be here if you had committed the
[25:38] unpardonable sin. Because you're here
[25:41] this morning. It mean there's a desire
[25:42] in your heart to be reconciled to God
[25:46] and to get closer to God. And once
[25:49] there's a desire in your heart, there's
[25:51] a God that could meet you and meet that
[25:55] desire that's in your
[25:58] heart. Amen.
[26:01] So last Sunday we had by these
[26:04] precious revealed promises. Amen. Was
[26:08] the title the subject was partakers of
[26:10] his divine nature and the inspiration
[26:13] was possessing your individual
[26:16] inheritance. Amen. This is the challenge
[26:18] here. That last one possessing your
[26:21] individual inheritance. Amen. Because
[26:24] what people have learned for the past
[26:25] 100 years or church these church ages
[26:27] thing is is group thing is is church
[26:31] thing. And and and sad to say it doesn't
[26:34] have that. Amen. At the end of the day,
[26:36] you have to say like Caleb, now
[26:39] therefore, give me my mountain. Amen.
[26:45] Amen. There's a couple of things inside
[26:47] of there. Now, therefore, right now,
[26:52] give to me, not them. It's my own. My
[26:56] means ownership.
[26:58] Mountain we have to take. Notice that
[27:01] give me my plane. We just walk flat in
[27:03] it. It's a mountain. You have to look
[27:06] up. You have to climb. You have to make
[27:09] an effort. The mountain not falling on
[27:11] you. You have to take it. It's not
[27:14] coming to you. That is one mountain
[27:16] that's not moving. That is mountain must
[27:19] be taken. So you have to say I want it.
[27:21] It's mine. Faith is mine. Come on.
[27:24] Virtue that's mine too. What about
[27:26] knowledge? What about temperance? What
[27:29] about patience? What about godliness?
[27:32] This divine nature. It's a mountain.
[27:35] Hallelujah. And the higher you go is the
[27:37] less people you see. Give the Lord a
[27:39] shout.
[27:42] You may be seated. Glory. The higher you
[27:45] go. The less people you see because it
[27:48] gets steeper. It gets sharper. You get
[27:51] more cuts. You get more bruises. You get
[27:54] more honing. You get more trials because
[27:58] you bring forth fruit. He has to prune
[28:00] you to bring forth more fruit. You have
[28:03] to get much fruit. Is there people in
[28:06] the house this morning? That want to
[28:08] give the Lord a shout?
[28:11] Oh, hallelujah. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[28:16] Okay.
[28:17] So, your behavior is what sets you out
[28:20] to adoption. All right. Amen. That is
[28:23] why it's not only ministers going to be
[28:25] adopted. There going to be some sisters
[28:28] that going to be adopted also.
[28:32] Praise God. And that those sisters, they
[28:36] are not going to be preaching sisters.
[28:38] They're going to be living sisters.
[28:39] Living
[28:42] this not like Mother Teresa, you know,
[28:44] this is not this dead saint thing, you
[28:45] know. This is living saints. Hallelujah.
[28:48] Praise God. Do you believe that? Sons
[28:50] and daughters going to be adopted.
[28:53] Do you believe that? Amen. Hallelujah.
[28:57] So this is just recapping but I want to
[28:59] just strike something small. I was just
[29:02] thinking about it on put interviews and
[29:04] I might not have it all together but
[29:05] I'll just say what come to my mind.
[29:08] Sometimes going to interview everybody
[29:09] have the same qualification have a
[29:10] degree who have subject and so on but
[29:13] then they filter you further than that a
[29:16] little deeper than that because that is
[29:18] just intelligence passing papers and
[29:20] whatn not and job skills and stuff like
[29:23] that. There's something called a
[29:24] psychometric test. It's a big word. It's
[29:27] not a common word, but it's designed to
[29:29] test your behavior and tendencies. Amen.
[29:32] Because the people want the best people
[29:34] for their company. They want to have the
[29:36] best fit. So having the best
[29:38] qualifications doesn't mean you have the
[29:40] best fit. You may not be you may be
[29:42] antisocial. They may not want to mix
[29:44] with others. You may be like to work
[29:46] solo and that job may cause for a
[29:49] non-solo worker. You have to interact
[29:51] with many many people. So they have
[29:53] these tests and they give stories ask
[29:56] you where you fit in the family if you
[29:57] get in an accident and this happen how
[29:59] you're going to behave and you don't
[30:00] know what they're looking for you just
[30:02] give answers and sometime people fail
[30:05] that even though they have the degree
[30:06] and they have the qualifications but
[30:08] because of different personality issues
[30:11] and pro they want to profile you that is
[30:14] what they look for then they could
[30:15] snatch you up into the company and get
[30:17] the very best and the company only could
[30:19] be great as the people in it are great.
[30:22] The company could only be powerful as
[30:24] the people in it are powerful. So these
[30:26] companies, they want the best. So let's
[30:28] flip it now. Our God, he run the
[30:30] company.
[30:32] [Applause]
[30:35] A company of saints.
[30:37] Hallelujah. A company of believers.
[30:41] People are qualified. They have books.
[30:43] They have tapes.
[30:46] You may be seated. They know what the
[30:48] prophet said. Yes. You know what? In
[30:50] this book and in this tape and and that
[30:52] book, they're qualified. But then it
[30:53] have something called the psychometric
[30:54] test. God doesn't have that name. It
[30:57] have the behavioral test. Have a
[30:59] virtuous test. Have a test on character.
[31:02] So then the interviewer come and give
[31:03] you this trial and that trial to see how
[31:05] you going to behave. If you're going to
[31:07] pass that test, oh hallelujah. It's not
[31:10] who going to talk the talk. It's who
[31:12] going to walk that talk. Oh, glory to
[31:14] God. That life really shakes up, you
[31:16] know. Oh, hallelujah. Oh, praise the
[31:20] name of the Lord. Do you believe that?
[31:22] So, I wanted to get that to you. It's a
[31:23] little more than written word. It's a
[31:25] little more than saying I believe. It's
[31:27] a little more than that. We said the
[31:30] same power. This is quote somebody brand
[31:31] just summarizing for last week just to
[31:33] connect to this Sunday. Same power in
[31:35] Jesus rest in placed sons in the body of
[31:39] Christ. Specific placed sons. But the
[31:43] brand the Joshua commission took us over
[31:45] into the new Holy Ghost land on the back
[31:48] of the book. He said, "Break to us the
[31:50] seals." On the back of the book because
[31:53] Joshua entered in his land to divide
[31:55] inheritance of the people. So he put the
[31:57] back of the book the seven thunders as
[31:58] the new land of promise. Amen. Holy
[32:01] Ghost lamb. Hallelujah. He went even
[32:03] deeper. He said we are now living by the
[32:05] evidence of the new land of the son of
[32:08] man. So the Solomon is the evidence of
[32:12] the new land and the son of man is the
[32:15] word revealed. Amen. So he Malachi 4
[32:18] came to introduce the son of man. Yes
[32:20] sir. The son of man was veiled in a son
[32:22] of man. Amen. So it's on books. It's on
[32:24] tapes. His mysteries hidden right there
[32:26] being unfolded to his elect. So we are
[32:29] now even in 2016 living by the evidence
[32:32] of the new land. We are now I'm say it
[32:35] again. We are now we are now living by
[32:39] the evidence of the new land. Somebody
[32:41] crossed over. Somebody went back and
[32:44] bring a testimony. It have spoken word
[32:46] in it. It have stopping the elements in
[32:48] it. It have creation in it. It have
[32:51] before the doctor's hand touches my wife
[32:53] the tumor will go down. It have that in
[32:54] it. It have little fishy I give you back
[32:57] your life. It have resurrection in it.
[32:59] Somebody went over and brought a witness
[33:03] that we are not normal people. We're not
[33:05] ordinary people. We belong to a
[33:08] different class. We belong to a God
[33:10] class.
[33:12] [Applause]
[33:16] Oh, give the Lord a
[33:18] shout. You sit there looking at me
[33:20] normal, normal, normal. And you are
[33:22] different class of people all together.
[33:25] Praise God. The Bible said the people
[33:26] that know their God shall be strong and
[33:29] do great exploits. My God, you can't sit
[33:32] there like you are nobody. Praise God.
[33:35] Wanted the best. That's why he leave you
[33:36] for last. Oh, he leave the best for
[33:40] last. Tell somebody that he leave the
[33:42] best for last. Tell somebody that.
[33:45] [Applause]
[33:55] [Applause]
[34:02] I know some of you getting a fight to
[34:03] say amen. You know, because you don't
[34:04] believe you're the best. But that's not
[34:06] you judging that. It's not you judging
[34:09] yourself. It's not you call yourself.
[34:12] It's who he found you. He called. You
[34:14] can't feel like the best. There's not a
[34:16] feeling job. Jesus never said feelest
[34:19] thou this. He said believe us thou this.
[34:22] So I'm not asking you to believe you are
[34:23] the best. I'm asking you to believe God.
[34:27] [Applause]
[34:36] You say, "But when I'm in trouble,
[34:37] that's why he called you." You say, "But
[34:40] I'm troublesome." That's why he called
[34:41] you. He wasn't calling you because
[34:43] you're troublesome, you know. He called
[34:44] you because your name on the book.
[34:48] That's all. That's all. You ain't call
[34:50] it because you have gray hair, black
[34:52] hair, because you're tall, you're short,
[34:53] whatever it is in this family, he could
[34:55] have put you out of space. You still
[34:57] have to come.
[34:59] You're not hearing what I'm saying. I
[35:01] don't care if your mother was a
[35:02] prostitute and your father was a
[35:03] drunkard. He still had to come. I don't
[35:06] care who God put you as your parents
[35:08] because you can't choose them. Come on
[35:10] now. You couldn't choose your mother or
[35:12] your father. Oh, could we get the Lord a
[35:14] shout? Neither could you choose who your
[35:16] father
[35:18] is. Hallelujah. says, "I come from God.
[35:21] I go back to God." You're going to get a
[35:24] revival. You're going to get a revival.
[35:27] It belongs to
[35:29] [Applause]
[35:33] you. You may be seated. Oh, hallelujah.
[35:38] Praise God.
[35:40] Still trying to find myself here. Amen.
[35:43] So this promised land is to live in the
[35:46] land of the Holy Spirit and the guide
[35:49] was released by the prophet for 1966.
[35:54] That guide that he preached on was to
[35:56] guide us to a wonderful glorious baptism
[36:01] of the Holy Ghost where there is virtue
[36:04] and knowledge and temperance and
[36:06] patience and godliness and brotherly
[36:09] kindness. No, come like a child riding a
[36:13] bike. You have to have extra wheel,
[36:14] three wheel, extra wheel cuz the child
[36:16] don't know how to balance yet. After a
[36:18] while, the two wheels at the side, one
[36:20] wheel gone and then the other training
[36:22] wheel gone and the child is on his own.
[36:24] Then it's no more a conscious effort to
[36:26] ride. It's a unconscious effort. Jump on
[36:30] the bike and ride. But the child didn't
[36:32] automatically get there. It had extra
[36:35] wheels to train him that he become
[36:38] accustomed to this movement. Well, you
[36:41] can't just get them virtues and just get
[36:43] there. You have to have some training
[36:45] wheels that exerciseing wheels that you
[36:48] can exercise the virtue and exercise the
[36:50] patience and exercise of God and
[36:52] exercise. You have to have some training
[36:54] wheels. You have to have an effort to
[36:57] ride that bike. And after a while, it
[37:00] will be operating in you from your
[37:03] subconscious level where you're not
[37:05] trying to be nice because you're a
[37:07] Christian and you're supposed to be
[37:08] nice. No, no, no. You're just nice
[37:10] because you're just nice. Oh, God. Give
[37:13] the Lord a shout in the house. Oh,
[37:16] hallelujah.
[37:18] You may be seated. Hallelujah. So, we
[37:21] talking about what we are preaching
[37:23] becoming ingrained in your spirit. Amen.
[37:26] In other words, the word start to become
[37:28] flesh. Said it start to ooze out inside
[37:31] of you. Hallelu. Do you understand what
[37:33] I'm saying? You choose not to be a
[37:36] church member. They're just listening
[37:38] and just listening like they're just
[37:40] listening.
[37:43] But you are elect
[37:45] that the word that you're hearing
[37:47] becomes a conductor of the spirit to get
[37:51] into your life. Because what you're
[37:53] hearing is at a mental level, but
[37:55] there's a channel, hallelujah, that
[37:57] drops down from the mind to the heart.
[38:02] So, Brother Brandon said, "The mind is
[38:04] the womb to the soul." So, you're not
[38:06] really here to be entertained. You're
[38:08] not just here to be informed. You're
[38:10] here to be in the spirit that the spirit
[38:14] could reveal his word to you.
[38:17] Oh, give the Lord a shout of praise. You
[38:20] may be seated. Are we going to go to the
[38:21] scriptures? So don't waste one minute of
[38:24] this service.
[38:25] [Applause]
[38:28] Let's do like give the last service
[38:29] you're going to hear. Hallelujah. The
[38:32] wrath of God is about to strike. And
[38:34] this is the last service. You want every
[38:36] word. When you leave here, you can pray
[38:38] for your children. When you leave here,
[38:39] you can say, "Devil, get out right now.
[38:42] You have to hear what I'm saying. I
[38:44] don't have the power, but I have the
[38:45] authority to cast you out.
[38:52] Let me be seated.
[38:54] At this point, before we approach the
[38:56] scriptures, you have no enemies outside.
[38:58] Amen.
[39:01] Don't blame your wife, your husband,
[39:02] your brother, sister, father, mother,
[39:04] uncle, auntie, boss, neighbor, nobody.
[39:07] It's just you.
[39:10] You and your demons,
[39:11] [Music]
[39:13] you and your struggles, you and your
[39:16] battles that you going to have victory
[39:18] over. Amen. Because before Jesus was
[39:20] loosed under his road of adoption, God
[39:22] loosed him in the wilderness first. Not
[39:25] with no crowd, not with a bunch of
[39:26] deacons backing in. Jesus, you can make
[39:28] it. You can make it. Jesus, I'm with
[39:29] you.
[39:31] He was led by the spirit into the
[39:32] wilderness to overcome all by himself.
[39:36] Say after me, all by myself. All by
[39:38] myself. That's how it's going to be.
[39:40] Give the Lord a shout in the
[39:41] [Applause]
[39:45] house. When he overcome himself, God
[39:48] could trust him
[39:51] in power.
[39:54] [Music]
[39:57] Hallelujah. Here are the principle and
[39:59] laws. Brother man say usually when
[40:01] somebody get blessed, they get puffed
[40:03] up.
[40:05] Blessing hit them. There's somebody. God
[40:09] only a little drop in. God testing them.
[40:12] A little drop, a little blessing. Now
[40:14] that drop from God is a big drop, but
[40:16] it's instead of that drop, you have a
[40:17] whole pint, a love and blessing to pour
[40:19] upon you. A little drop and all of a
[40:21] sudden you stop coming to church. You
[40:24] know what I mean? You're up there
[40:25] somewhere.
[40:27] So God looking for somebody, the more he
[40:29] blesses,
[40:30] is the more humble
[40:33] they become.
[40:35] And for the ministry, he say take a
[40:37] humble heart dedicated to God to bring
[40:41] Jesus Christ into present tense. So all
[40:44] the promises are there waiting for faith
[40:47] in somebody's heart to make it come
[40:48] alive.
[40:50] Are you going to make it come alive? But
[40:52] a Brandon said a minister cannot bring a
[40:54] revival. So super preacher, super
[40:57] personality, that's finished.
[40:59] Hallelujah. Waste of time. Try to hold
[41:01] on to a man, waste of time. Don't even
[41:03] try that here. The the revival have to
[41:07] come by the people.
[41:09] You have to bring the revival. You got
[41:11] to know what's in you. You have to be a
[41:14] revivalist.
[41:16] You have to come to make something
[41:17] happen. You have to come to start the
[41:20] fire. If you had to hot the coals on the
[41:22] stove, hot it on the stove. But
[41:25] afterwards, it have to catch a fire. You
[41:27] have to
[41:29] blow. But do something. Don't let that
[41:32] fire go out. Don't let the fire I don't
[41:35] care if a little a little thing burning.
[41:37] So, a little smoke, a little Amen. Come
[41:39] and blow on it. Wave on it. Say amen on
[41:43] it. Shout on it. But my God, don't let
[41:46] the devil out the light that's in your
[41:48] soul.
[41:52] Oh, yeah. Shouting out.
[41:55] You may be seated. Ah,
[42:00] I'm going to get scriptures. I'm on my
[42:01] Trying to get fast as I could.
[42:05] Amen. Hallelujah. In the early church,
[42:09] God was a God of the audience.
[42:11] God of the people.
[42:14] They took God from the audience and put
[42:15] it on a man. Eventually, he become a
[42:18] pope.
[42:19] God say I hate it. I hated the deeds of
[42:24] the nicolatans where the lady is
[42:27] conquered and something came back to me
[42:30] with brother Brham on the platform on
[42:32] the discernment. Watch this. He's on the
[42:35] platform. People get numbers and how to
[42:37] fight for numbers to get numbers to get
[42:39] in the prayer line. You're up top of the
[42:41] platform. All of a sudden he's going to
[42:43] somebody and say the pillar fire move
[42:44] over there. That woman across there so
[42:45] and so. You know it struck me. God is a
[42:47] God of the audience. Amen. God allowing
[42:50] nobody to interfere. Once the audience
[42:52] pull that fire, they they have to get
[42:53] it. So the prophet is up here, but the
[42:57] audience fire pulling. So he he have to
[42:59] move with the fire. And I'm saying God
[43:02] is a God of the audience. You could pull
[43:04] that fire. You could pull that
[43:06] anointing. You could pull your healing.
[43:09] Don't bother.
[43:11] Don't bo about the preacher. Give the
[43:14] Lord a shout in the in the house.
[43:20] Glory,
[43:23] glory,
[43:24] glory, glory,
[43:27] hallelujah,
[43:29] watch this. Even though the person on
[43:31] the platform, God put prominence to what
[43:35] was happening in the congregation with
[43:37] faith pulling on the pillar of fire.
[43:40] Your faith could pull on that fire. That
[43:43] God could give you what you have need of
[43:46] before you even go home. The sick person
[43:49] that you have home, they could be healed
[43:52] by your faith. Oh, could we stand this
[43:55] morning? Oh, blessed be the name of the
[43:58] Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We want to
[44:00] go into the
[44:02] scriptures. Deuteronomy 29 29.
[44:07] Colossians 1
[44:09] 26-29, Revelation
[44:13] 4:1-5. And my title this morning is
[44:15] God's
[44:16] purpose
[44:18] expressed through the acts of believers.
[44:23] God's purpose expressed through the acts
[44:26] of believers. My subject is what God's
[44:29] great goal is. I phrase it that way. The
[44:33] way Brother Abraham said it, I could
[44:34] have said, "What is God's great goal?
[44:37] But I put it what God's great goal is.
[44:41] Inspiration becoming a partaker of his
[44:44] divine nature. So let's read Deuteronomy
[44:48] 29 verse 29. God bless you. Welcome.
[44:51] There are some believers here from the
[44:53] world. I think I see water down there.
[44:54] God bless you. Welcome to our Sunday
[44:56] morning service. Reading from uh
[45:00] Deuteronomy 29:29. The secret
[45:03] things belong unto the Lord our God. But
[45:07] those things which are revealed belong
[45:10] unto us and to our children forever that
[45:14] we may do all the words of the Lord.
[45:18] Colossians 1 reading from verse 26. Even
[45:22] the mystery which had been hid from ages
[45:25] and from generations, but now is made
[45:27] manifest to his saints, to whom God
[45:30] would make known what is the riches of
[45:33] the glory of this mystery among the
[45:35] Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the
[45:38] hope of glory, whom we preach, warning
[45:41] every man, and teaching every man in all
[45:42] wisdom, that we may present every man
[45:45] perfect in Christ Jesus, where unto I
[45:47] also labor, striving according to his
[45:50] working, which workketh in me
[45:53] mightily. And Revelation chapter 4, you
[45:56] want to read from verse 1 to 5. After
[45:59] this, I looked, and behold, a door was
[46:02] open in heaven, and the first voice
[46:04] which I heard were as it were a trumpet
[46:05] talking with me, which said, "Come up
[46:07] hither, and I will show thee things
[46:10] which must be hereafter." And
[46:11] immediately I was in the spirit. And
[46:13] behold, a throne was set in heaven, and
[46:15] one sat on the throne. And he that sat
[46:17] was to look upon like a jasper, and a
[46:19] satine stone, and there was a rainbow
[46:22] round about the throne, in sight like
[46:23] unto an emerald. Round about the throne
[46:25] were 420 seats. And upon the seats I saw
[46:28] 420 elders sitting, clothed with white
[46:30] reignment, and they had on their heads
[46:32] crowns of gold, and out of the throne
[46:34] proceeded lightnings, and thunderings,
[46:36] and voices, and there were seven lamps
[46:38] of fire burning before the throne, which
[46:41] are the seven spirits of God. Let's
[46:43] pray. Father, we thank you for your
[46:45] word, God. May you inspire the word to
[46:47] our hearts this morning. We wait on you.
[46:49] May the pillar of fire drop down here
[46:51] this morning and speak life to your
[46:53] people, oh God. In Jesus name we ask it.
[46:56] Amen. And amen. You may be seated. Oh,
[46:58] praise God. That title again, God's
[47:00] purpose expressed through the acts
[47:03] of his believers.
[47:07] Amen. Amen.
[47:10] Habac 2 says, "I will stand upon my
[47:12] watch and set me upon a tower and will
[47:15] watch to see what he will say unto me
[47:17] and what I shall answer when I am
[47:20] reproved." The Lord answered me and
[47:23] said, "Write the
[47:25] vision, and make it plain upon
[47:29] tables, that he may run that readth it.
[47:33] For the vision is yet for an appointed
[47:36] time, but at the end it shall speak and
[47:38] not lie. Do it, Terry. Wait for it, it
[47:41] shall surely come. Amen.
[47:44] Hallelujah. Write the vision. And make
[47:48] it plain. Well, that's what brother
[47:50] Brandon came on to do. Write to the
[47:53] bride a vision. Amen. And over 40, 50
[47:56] plus years, the vision was supposed to
[47:59] be made plain to the people. Amen. That
[48:02] we could run. Yes sir. That we could
[48:04] act. Hallelujah. Not that we could just
[48:07] read but that we can do. These are
[48:11] action words. The secret things belong
[48:13] to God. But the things that are
[48:15] revealed. All these promises belong to
[48:18] us and to our children. What's the
[48:22] purpose? That we may do all the words of
[48:26] the Lord. So the object is not just
[48:29] forformational purposes. The object is
[48:32] to get us into action
[48:34] the object is to influence us to perform
[48:38] and to achieve and to fall into a
[48:40] channel of God's purpose and God's
[48:43] accomplishment that we can act as
[48:46] believers. Walk as believers, talk as
[48:51] believers, live as believers, not
[48:54] unbelievers, not make believers, but as
[48:57] believers. Do you believe that? Amen.
[49:00] Oh, glory to God. Amen. Hallelujah.
[49:03] Hallelujah. So, brother Brenam after the
[49:05] seals. Yes. After all these great
[49:08] mysteries, he came up and said this
[49:11] message going to summarize everything.
[49:13] This one message. And he preached the
[49:16] message called the token.
[49:21] Amen.
[49:23] The greatest message and inspiration to
[49:25] preach, he said, was the token. I want
[49:27] to just bring some things back. There's
[49:28] a purpose that we're doing this. Amen.
[49:30] This morning, think about it now. It had
[49:33] trumpets, vials, thunders, seals,
[49:36] mysteries, and yet he zoomed into a
[49:40] target. Amen. Of the token, when I see
[49:44] the blood, all right, I'm going to pass
[49:46] over you. And that's the even time
[49:49] message is to apply the token. He he is
[49:53] searing to a bullseye. It have a lot of
[49:56] loose ends. A lot of things with what
[49:59] happened in the Garden of Eden and
[50:00] information and the Pope and Rome and
[50:02] Los Angeles and all of that and all that
[50:05] is frills around the target. But the
[50:07] target, the bullseye, what you're aiming
[50:10] at, what you're longing for, what you're
[50:12] pressing on to is the token.
[50:16] Oh, could we give the Lord a shout
[50:19] in the house? No, no, no. Paul said it
[50:22] this way. Amen. He didn't say I press
[50:25] towards the mark. He didn't say that.
[50:28] All right. He said forgetting the thing
[50:30] that I passed.
[50:33] I press. You want to press, you have to
[50:37] forget.
[50:40] [Applause]
[50:42] Did you hear me? Did you hear what I'm
[50:44] saying? Amen. If you want to hit target,
[50:47] you can't be hitting target and you're
[50:49] looking so you're looking so you're
[50:50] looking so
[50:55] come like you're in the Olympics and
[50:56] you're running and you're looking so is
[50:58] a race.
[50:59] You're taking time off to drink some
[51:01] juice. You're looking to come last.
[51:03] You're not looking for you want to say
[51:04] you already run. Listen, ahead of us is
[51:08] just two things. Rapture or
[51:13] tribulation. Amen. She get inside.
[51:18] But if you want to stay here, that's
[51:20] fine. I move it. No. I'm not staying
[51:24] with you. No. Hallelujah. I'm not
[51:27] staying with no church and no
[51:28] tribulation. I appreciate there be no
[51:30] tribulation saint trying to understand
[51:33] why I missed it. No, no, no, no, no. I'm
[51:35] not doing that. I'm preaching because
[51:37] there's a rapture.
[51:43] be seated.
[51:45] And there's a rapture because listen,
[51:47] listen. This is important. There is no
[51:48] way out.
[51:51] [Applause]
[51:54] You could put two thing in your ears and
[51:55] hear music whole day that can't get you
[51:58] out. You could sing message songs whole
[52:00] day that can't still get you out. You
[52:03] could put some books and sleep on it.
[52:05] That still can't get you out. There's
[52:07] only one way out. faith, virtue,
[52:10] knowledge, time and temperance,
[52:13] patience,
[52:15] godliness. The same way Enoch went out,
[52:20] Enoch
[52:21] walked with God.
[52:24] And was not
[52:26] Hallelujah. Not with church. He walked
[52:29] with
[52:30] God. Oh, give the Lord some praises,
[52:33] people.
[52:39] Some of you need some props to walk. You
[52:42] have to have this friend. You have to
[52:44] have this family member. I You have to,
[52:47] you know, it's not God first, it's
[52:48] family first, family second, family
[52:50] third. You have to walk with God alone.
[52:53] Amen. Friend,
[52:55] or no friend, sink or drown. Get this
[52:59] bomb. Whether I maintain my family or
[53:01] not, let me maintain Christ. Because
[53:05] that's the mystery. What's the mystery?
[53:08] Christ in you.
[53:11] Hope of glory. This mystery that was
[53:14] hidden from ages now being made
[53:16] manifest. What is going to be? Christ.
[53:20] Where? In some book. No. In some prophet
[53:23] back there. No. Christ in you. So all
[53:28] what we are coming into is to produce
[53:31] Christ in you. the hope of glory. Are
[53:36] you with me? Let's go. Then the blood
[53:39] was a token for identification. The
[53:42] blood watch identify that the worshipper
[53:46] had slain the lamb. If there was no
[53:48] blood, it mean the lamb alive and
[53:50] kicking.
[53:51] The fact there's blood is because you
[53:54] killed the lamb. You put your hands on
[53:56] the lamb and you're all bloodied up.
[53:59] When I see the blood, I'm going to pass
[54:01] over you. You have to kill the lamb to
[54:04] get the blood. It means a price has been
[54:06] paid. It means you apply to the doorpost
[54:10] because the death angel passing, not the
[54:12] pastor, not the deacon, not the church
[54:15] elder, not some nice brother, not some
[54:18] precious minister, brother, pastor. It
[54:21] is death angel. He's not asking what
[54:23] church you belong to. He's not asking
[54:25] who your pastor is. But I see the blood
[54:28] I'm going to pass over you. Come on,
[54:30] help me somebody. Help me preach. That's
[54:32] why Ram zoomed in on the token. He
[54:35] zoomed in on the target.
[54:41] [Music]
[54:42] [Applause]
[54:43] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory.
[54:47] My so many people. Watch. All right. And
[54:52] he was not ashamed. He didn't care who
[54:53] saw it. He wanted everybody to see it.
[54:56] It was placed in a position that
[54:58] everybody passing by could see that
[55:00] token. Listen young people, young people
[55:03] in particular.
[55:05] Everybody could have seen that token on
[55:08] the doorpost.
[55:10] So many people want to be Christians.
[55:13] They want to do it secretly.
[55:16] Nobody would know that they were
[55:17] Christians. They associate, they run
[55:20] around with some of them think, well,
[55:21] you know, I want to become a Christian,
[55:22] but I don't want so and so to know about
[55:24] it. You see that's not Christianity.
[55:27] Christianity has to display its token
[55:30] publicly.
[55:31] [Applause]
[55:34] So it have no private Christianity. I'm
[55:36] a private person that Yeah, you a
[55:39] private person. But that is not what is
[55:41] being taught here. Christianity has to
[55:43] have the token. Praise God. It's a
[55:46] public thing. So you you is a public
[55:48] servant, not the government kind of.
[55:52] Amen. public life, at the office, on the
[55:56] street, when trouble is around, in the
[56:00] church, everywhere, the blood is a
[56:02] token. And the token must be applied.
[56:05] Must be applied. Say it again. Applied.
[56:08] Say it again. Applied. Applied. Now, we
[56:11] not even talking about apply. We talking
[56:12] about displayed. It coming to But before
[56:14] you can display it, you have to apply
[56:16] it. Hallelujah. They got hiss up. Baron
[56:20] said was common. Please take hiss up and
[56:21] just dip it in the blood and apply it on
[56:23] the doorpost. When I see the blood, I'm
[56:25] going to pass away. The blood was a
[56:27] token of identification. Identifying
[56:29] this person was redeemed. And they were
[56:32] redeemed before anything had happened
[56:36] by faith. They applied the blood. Before
[56:39] it actually happened. Amen. The blood
[56:41] was applied by faith believing it was
[56:44] going to happen because the wrath of God
[56:47] passed through the land. The blood had
[56:49] to be applied first. It was too late
[56:51] after the rat had fallen. Amen. So
[56:54] judgment is set. It's not coming. It is
[56:57] already set. It is fixed. The judgment
[57:01] of God arrow has already been loosed.
[57:03] There's only one way to be under the
[57:05] blood, under the token under God's
[57:08] covenant. He's not talking about your
[57:10] sins. He's not talking about your
[57:11] failures. He's not talking about your
[57:13] shortcom. He's not talking about that.
[57:15] He's talking about the blood. He's
[57:17] talking about the token. He's talking
[57:19] about the come. How many understands
[57:20] that?
[57:22] Same with a woman at a well. You meet
[57:24] the woman in a well. He wasn't coming to
[57:26] talk about her sins, her failures, how
[57:27] much man she had, how much man she with,
[57:29] who she with now. He wasn't talking
[57:30] about that. He come to tell her her name
[57:32] is on the book woman. If you understand
[57:34] your name is on the book, you'll be
[57:36] liberated. You'll be free. Yes, you will
[57:39] break out.
[57:41] [Music]
[57:43] you would realize you don't have to live
[57:45] that way no more. And who the son of man
[57:48] set free is free indeed. Come on, give
[57:51] the Lord some praises.
[57:56] Now watch. When I see the blood, I will
[57:59] pass over you. Amen. Nothing else would
[58:02] work. It must be the blood. Now the Holy
[58:07] Ghost is our token.
[58:12] Hallelujah.
[58:14] Did you hear that? The Holy Ghost is our
[58:17] token. I don't know what other people
[58:19] have as their token, but for us, the
[58:22] Holy Ghost.
[58:24] [Applause]
[58:26] [Music]
[58:28] Not this church is your token. Sorry.
[58:31] Amen. I am not your token.
[58:35] Amen. Hallelujah. I hope you get that
[58:38] good, right? Amen. Yeah. Hold on to me,
[58:40] pastor. He's my token. Not this man. Not
[58:44] this one.
[58:46] The Holy Ghost,
[58:48] is the token.
[58:52] And when you apply it, you apply it.
[58:55] Nobody can unapply it. Come on now.
[59:01] You applying it as an individual
[59:04] to your house.
[59:08] Somehow
[59:09] there are people that are not saying
[59:11] amen.
[59:14] I'm preaching the word.
[59:20] Amen means so be it.
[59:24] Amen. No, I'm not preaching down to you.
[59:27] You know what I'm hearing you hearing
[59:29] too. You know this is for me also you
[59:31] know. Uhhuh.
[59:34] You mean this is for you brother over?
[59:36] Yes. You you mean the playing field
[59:39] level? Yes. You mean we on the same
[59:41] page?
[59:44] Yes. You mean we all waiting on the
[59:46] promise of God? Yes. You mean we all
[59:49] waiting for dynamics? Yes. You mean you
[59:52] know up here and we are down here? No.
[59:54] You mean we all in the upper room? Yes.
[59:57] We be all under a promise of God. Yes.
[1:00:00] All looking for inheritance. Oh yes. Oh
[1:00:02] give the Lord a shout in the house.
[1:00:07] [Applause]
[1:00:14] The token today is the spirit.
[1:00:17] Brother Abraham said Paul I could give
[1:00:19] my body to be burned a sacrifice all my
[1:00:21] but goods to feed the poor. I have faith
[1:00:23] in mountains and so forth. I am nothing
[1:00:26] until the token has been applied. Until
[1:00:29] this token that I'm speaking about
[1:00:31] tonight, the love, brother Stephen,
[1:00:33] until the love now until this has been
[1:00:36] applied, I am nothing.
[1:00:39] God expect us to go beyond the love of
[1:00:40] our own brethren. Because Jesus bought
[1:00:43] his own disciples and tell them except
[1:00:44] you exceed the righteousness, Pharisees,
[1:00:47] you're just like them.
[1:00:49] They they love their own too. You have
[1:00:51] to love your enemies. You have to do
[1:00:52] better than them. You have to go beyond
[1:00:54] where you are. You can't just love your
[1:00:56] own family alone. Love your own kind,
[1:00:58] love your own what you think is your
[1:01:00] own. No, you got to love like God love.
[1:01:02] Come on now. Come on. Same as somebody.
[1:01:04] You got to be able to express the love
[1:01:06] of God. So all them husband and wife
[1:01:08] quaries where that going.
[1:01:12] All that fussing in the home. What what
[1:01:13] what that is about?
[1:01:17] Hallelujah. They're not even a test.
[1:01:20] Most of the time is a bunch of
[1:01:21] foolishness. Everybody want to have
[1:01:23] their own rights and nobody want to eat
[1:01:25] humble pie. Humble pie just too small.
[1:01:30] Humble pie doesn't make you humble. Must
[1:01:32] bake some more of that. Amen. Instead of
[1:01:35] the argument pie
[1:01:37] or the quarrel
[1:01:39] pie bake some humble pie. Hallelujah.
[1:01:43] Jesus taught it not robbery to be equal
[1:01:45] with God. Hallelujah. but humbled
[1:01:48] himself and became obedient to go to the
[1:01:51] cross. Everybody want to be somebody.
[1:01:54] Everybody want to show up the muscle.
[1:01:58] All right. So, I don't care. You might
[1:02:00] cast out devils. You might heal the
[1:02:02] sick, the prayer of faith. You might
[1:02:03] have done these things. But if that talk
[1:02:05] is not there, you are under the wrath of
[1:02:06] God. Amen. You might be a believer. Hear
[1:02:09] this. You might stand in the pullpit and
[1:02:11] preach the gospel.
[1:02:13] But Abraham was leveling it out. He said
[1:02:16] many will come to me. He given a
[1:02:18] scripture in that day and said after I
[1:02:21] cast out devils in your name that's
[1:02:22] Methodist, Baptist, Pentecostal. Jesus
[1:02:25] said depart from me you work iniquity. I
[1:02:27] never knew you
[1:02:30] but when I see the token I'm going to
[1:02:32] pass over you. Then he said the evening
[1:02:35] time message is to to apply the token.
[1:02:38] So if he brought a seven thunder seven
[1:02:40] seal message the purpose of that message
[1:02:43] for us to apply the token.
[1:02:46] The token is your assurance.
[1:02:49] It is your assurance guaranteed.
[1:02:51] [Music]
[1:02:56] Hallelujah. Guaranteed that everything
[1:02:59] going to be all right.
[1:03:01] [Music]
[1:03:03] Glory.
[1:03:05] You may be seated.
[1:03:07] Listen. Let's go back to Egypt. All
[1:03:10] right. Blood has been applied. All
[1:03:11] right. The children under pressure in
[1:03:13] the daddy's home. All right. question
[1:03:14] they were asking brother daddy are you
[1:03:16] sure
[1:03:18] he said son Moses said that God told him
[1:03:24] Moses is the messenger of the age Moses
[1:03:26] brought the word of the Lord Moses said
[1:03:30] took a lamb I took the lamb Moses said
[1:03:33] kill the lamb children I killed the lamb
[1:03:36] Moses said take the blood and put it on
[1:03:38] the doorpost children I did that and if
[1:03:42] I did what God at the devil could watch
[1:03:46] but he can't touch. He could come near
[1:03:49] but he can't come in. He could go over
[1:03:53] but he can't come here. Because God said
[1:03:56] when I see the blood I'm going to pass
[1:03:59] over. Give the Lord praise in the house.
[1:04:03] There's going to be a move of God.
[1:04:05] There'll be a move of the spirit of God.
[1:04:08] The spirit will be applied to your life.
[1:04:10] Come on. Jump into it. move into it. Oh
[1:04:18] hallelujah. You may be seated.
[1:04:22] Few houses lower down of some priests of
[1:04:26] some elders. All right. They say we in
[1:04:28] this thing a long time. We prayed
[1:04:31] Jehovah a long time. We ain't feeling
[1:04:33] led. All right. To apply no blood, no
[1:04:36] seven thunder blood, no seven sealed
[1:04:39] blood. We don't have to apply faith and
[1:04:41] virtue. and knowledge and temperance and
[1:04:43] patience. There were seven lamps of fire
[1:04:46] burning before the throne of God beside
[1:04:49] the seven spirits of God. God don't have
[1:04:52] seven spirits. It is one Holy Spirit
[1:04:55] manifested in seven parts through seven
[1:04:58] church ages. God divided the Holy
[1:05:00] Spirit. But in the last day, he has
[1:05:03] gathered it up to bring back the token,
[1:05:07] to bring back his spirit. Go give the
[1:05:09] Lord a prayer.
[1:05:12] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:05:14] Glory to God.
[1:05:17] Do you see it?
[1:05:19] Glory to God. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:05:24] Hallelujah.
[1:05:26] Hallelujah. Hallelu. This is the
[1:05:28] message. This is William Brham's
[1:05:31] message. The
[1:05:35] token.
[1:05:39] Okay. Amen.
[1:05:43] Hallelujah. Satan has thrown a all kind
[1:05:46] of counterfeits, all right, of shaking
[1:05:48] hands, all right, and evidences and
[1:05:49] everything like that. Forget it. Amen.
[1:05:51] The hour has arrived. That the token
[1:05:54] itself, not some counterfeit or make
[1:05:57] believe or anything. The token has got
[1:05:59] to be there. Watch now. The Holy Spirit,
[1:06:03] the life that was in the blood is a
[1:06:07] token unto you. Amen. The Holy Ghost is
[1:06:09] the token. What's the token? The Holy
[1:06:12] Ghost. What's the token? Say it out
[1:06:15] loud. What's the token? The Holy Ghost
[1:06:18] is the token. Hallelujah.
[1:06:21] Now, the spirit is the token. And then
[1:06:24] he quote, "You shall be filled with the
[1:06:25] Holy Ghost. Not many days hence." That
[1:06:29] was the theme of every apostle. It was,
[1:06:31] "Have you received the Holy Ghost since
[1:06:33] you believe? Repent every one of you. Be
[1:06:35] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:06:37] the remission of your sins and you shall
[1:06:39] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
[1:06:41] Apply it, church. Don't fail, will you?
[1:06:44] Now, don't don't don't let the sun set.
[1:06:47] Don't don't don't rest day or night.
[1:06:49] Hallelujah. Don't take any chances. It
[1:06:52] won't work, children. It won't work. You
[1:06:56] must have the token. These are not my
[1:06:59] words. These are the prophet's words
[1:07:01] speaking to Brandham Tabernacle. He's
[1:07:04] telling them it won't work. Let's go on.
[1:07:07] You say, "I believe. I believe the
[1:07:09] message." That's all right. But that's
[1:07:11] good, but you must have the token. He
[1:07:16] said, "Do you hear brand tabernacle?"
[1:07:18] You must have the token displayed. So
[1:07:22] then he went from token to it displayed.
[1:07:25] It means faith have to come out, virtue
[1:07:27] have to come out, knowledge have to come
[1:07:29] out, temperance and it have to come out.
[1:07:31] It has to come from the inside to the
[1:07:33] outside. They have to apply it on the
[1:07:35] inside and it will ooze out on the
[1:07:36] outside. And when I begin to come out,
[1:07:38] it's the word become flesh among us. And
[1:07:40] when the word become flesh, it brings
[1:07:42] the spirit. The spirit is evident that
[1:07:44] the word has become flesh. Oh, glory to
[1:07:47] God. God was the great function of
[1:07:49] spirit. He was so mysterious. He formed
[1:07:52] himself into the lowest body called the
[1:07:54] word a theophony. Oh, hallelujah. He
[1:07:57] wanted to express himself. And then in
[1:07:59] the beginning was the word. The word was
[1:08:01] with God and the word was God and then
[1:08:04] the word became flesh. So this divine
[1:08:07] spirit function of spirit wanted a way
[1:08:09] to get into man.
[1:08:11] [Music]
[1:08:12] [Applause]
[1:08:16] Oh glory
[1:08:18] spirit too mysterious. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:08:22] Amen. You say you must have the token.
[1:08:24] Do you hear? You must have the token
[1:08:26] this place. Without it all your
[1:08:28] believing is in vain. Amen. You live a
[1:08:30] good life. You listen to what the word
[1:08:32] say. You go to church. You try to live
[1:08:33] right. That's fine. But that's not it.
[1:08:35] Amen. When I see the blood, that's a
[1:08:38] token and token here. Watch. He said
[1:08:40] Moses time. He had to see the actual
[1:08:43] chemistry because the life had gone. It
[1:08:45] was an animal. Amen. But now the life
[1:08:49] itself is the token,
[1:08:52] not the books and tapes. Amen.
[1:08:55] People get fight with me when I talk
[1:08:56] about books and tapes. As if I I'll get
[1:08:58] books and tapes. Oh, I could be a kids
[1:09:00] book on tape. I read it from the books.
[1:09:02] I read it from the tapes. But I'm saying
[1:09:05] having the books on tape and the Bible
[1:09:06] on top of your head, that's not the
[1:09:08] token. Amen. Knowing where said this and
[1:09:11] paragraph and page number and whatnot,
[1:09:12] that's not the token. Amen. You know,
[1:09:15] people used to r that off. Until the
[1:09:18] program come on the
[1:09:22] computer. You don't need to have that
[1:09:24] all in your head. You could just do a
[1:09:25] research. That's right. Like long time
[1:09:28] you you have all them encyclopedia by
[1:09:29] encyclopedia set some big books and you
[1:09:31] do so and spin page like the whole day
[1:09:33] spinning pages like that.
[1:09:36] No Google just replace all of that.
[1:09:39] Amen. Amen. That's the age we're living
[1:09:41] in. God bring the pop the message right
[1:09:44] into your hands. You have a phone right
[1:09:45] there. You can just get the message any
[1:09:46] quote you want right inside your hands.
[1:09:48] But you think God want it inside your
[1:09:49] hands to read read. You have to run. Had
[1:09:53] to come flesh inside of you. That's the
[1:09:55] problem. Everybody reading, everybody
[1:09:57] knowing, everybody coing, but who going
[1:09:59] to live and thunder?
[1:10:01] When the devil see them coming, he say
[1:10:02] run, run, run. Look, they coming.
[1:10:03] They're coming. They come run. Look who
[1:10:05] coming.
[1:10:09] Somebody have a big spoken book stand
[1:10:10] up. So the devil moving. Devil come and
[1:10:12] stand right back to them. He have a
[1:10:13] spoken book too because devil believe
[1:10:14] and trembling. So he have books.
[1:10:16] Everybody have books. Devil line up with
[1:10:18] them too. But when that life start to
[1:10:19] come, the devil said, "Wait, wait, wait,
[1:10:21] wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[1:10:23] wait, wait.
[1:10:26] Hallelujah. That's the thunder that
[1:10:30] shakes the devil. Hallelujah. There's
[1:10:33] coming a short quick message to shake
[1:10:36] the whole nation. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:10:39] Praise God. Brother man, let me tell you
[1:10:42] today as a servant, unless the token is
[1:10:45] on the door, there is spiritual death
[1:10:47] going to strike. All churches are
[1:10:51] heading back for the council of
[1:10:53] churches. They are all going back to
[1:10:56] Catholicism and the only those who are
[1:10:58] genuine born again is going to stay out.
[1:11:02] Remember not your Pentecostal
[1:11:04] denominations cuz they're already in it.
[1:11:06] Show that they're dead. They perish.
[1:11:08] They put him outside the door and he's
[1:11:10] looking for the token because the only
[1:11:12] thing they relied on was speaking in
[1:11:13] tongues. Don't you rely upon no speaking
[1:11:15] in tongues. No nothing else but let the
[1:11:18] token itself be there. And he says the
[1:11:21] person of Jesus Christ his own life in
[1:11:25] you. So friends we have no room to
[1:11:29] gossip to be indifferent to to to lose
[1:11:33] time and be distracted. We have to have
[1:11:36] a burden to receive the life of Jesus
[1:11:40] Christ.
[1:11:42] What do you do when you apply to your
[1:11:43] house? What do you do? Move all the
[1:11:45] trash out. Get all the short skirts, the
[1:11:48] cards, the cigarettes, the televisions.
[1:11:51] You kick them out the door. When you
[1:11:53] apply the token, won't stand still for
[1:11:56] it. Take it out. All the dances,
[1:11:58] parties, rock and roll, vulcan
[1:11:59] newspapers, all the stuff of the world,
[1:12:01] get it out the door and say, "We are
[1:12:03] cleaning out the place around here." So
[1:12:07] to apply the token is to do something
[1:12:10] about your situation.
[1:12:12] Just like the coin of brotherly
[1:12:13] kindness, to find that coin, you have to
[1:12:15] clean up the place because that coin was
[1:12:17] lost and you want to find your brotherly
[1:12:18] kindness. You find you have no kindness
[1:12:21] whatsoever. Brotherly or sisterly
[1:12:23] otherwise. So the coin lost. So you need
[1:12:26] to find that coin. And Bam says she
[1:12:29] begin to sweep the floor and swept up.
[1:12:30] She kept until she found it. And when
[1:12:32] she found it, she called her sisters and
[1:12:34] her brother churches, "Come and rejoice
[1:12:36] with me. I found the coin. If they don't
[1:12:39] want to come and rejoice, that is their
[1:12:40] business. But you you found your coin.
[1:12:43] Hallelujah. They're not happy with you.
[1:12:45] Unhappy for you. That is their problem.
[1:12:48] But you are rejoicing because you could
[1:12:50] forgive now. You could you could drop
[1:12:53] your ought now. You could call for
[1:12:55] charity now. When you stand praying for
[1:12:57] him, the person, the token, the Holy
[1:13:00] Ghost, you have no oughts in your heart.
[1:13:02] Then you're ready for the Holy Ghost
[1:13:04] because God give the Holy Ghost to them
[1:13:06] who obey him. And the blood for the age
[1:13:08] is brotherly kindness. So God going to
[1:13:11] make sure have enough oats around you.
[1:13:12] Enough people to mash your corn. He have
[1:13:15] people to hurt you in different ways to
[1:13:17] see what you going to do. He's not
[1:13:20] testing them. He is testing you. Now
[1:13:23] hear what I'm saying this morning. Oh,
[1:13:26] give the Lord some praises. Let me say
[1:13:28] it again. He is not testing them. They
[1:13:31] are there to hurt you. They are there to
[1:13:33] inflict pain on you. And you are there
[1:13:35] to act like Christ. Father, forgive
[1:13:38] them. They don't know what they're
[1:13:39] doing. Oh, give the Lord some praises in
[1:13:42] the house.
[1:13:51] Jesus on the cross, nails in his hands.
[1:13:54] Father, bond them.
[1:13:58] Bunch of rascals. I raised the dead. I
[1:14:00] healed the sick. I feed them with bread
[1:14:02] and flesh. Look at them ungrateful
[1:14:04] people.
[1:14:06] [Applause]
[1:14:07] Hallelujah.
[1:14:09] No, no. He may have rights to do that.
[1:14:14] Good thing you're not a train.
[1:14:17] Good. Good thing is Jesus Christ.
[1:14:20] But in that pain in that suffering, he
[1:14:24] expressed something because it was the
[1:14:26] key for the resurrection. He is moving
[1:14:28] into power. He's suffering. He's in
[1:14:31] pain, but he's still living the blood
[1:14:33] for his age. Voice for his age.
[1:14:36] brotherly kindness because resurrection
[1:14:38] power is next. And when we hit that top
[1:14:41] step, we going into the presence of the
[1:14:44] king because brotherly kindness is the
[1:14:45] top of the pyramid giving it right to
[1:14:48] enter into the king's chamber like Queen
[1:14:50] Esther with the scepter of authority and
[1:14:54] dominion. Whatever you want, Queen
[1:14:56] Esther up to half my kingdom. Oh,
[1:14:59] hallelujah. Praise God. But you have to
[1:15:02] be on a platform of forgiveness.
[1:15:04] No arts.
[1:15:06] No grudges, no jealousy, no envy, just a
[1:15:11] cleaned out life, waiting for your
[1:15:13] lover, your husband, your mate, even
[1:15:17] Christ, the revealed word to come to
[1:15:19] you. Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. But
[1:15:23] the Bible say it will take more than the
[1:15:24] power of gifts. It will take more than
[1:15:27] joining church. It will take the birth
[1:15:30] of the Holy Spirit to break down our
[1:15:32] walls and to unite us together as one
[1:15:35] great Christian body moving for one
[1:15:37] objective. Hallelujah. And one goal.
[1:15:40] Amen. Let's continue. Hallelujah.
[1:15:44] From what what does it take to make a
[1:15:47] Christian
[1:15:47] life? God intended his church to be a
[1:15:52] powerful church. Amen. A glorious
[1:15:56] church. Yes, sir. A church that the
[1:15:59] whole world could look upon as a bride
[1:16:01] of Christ, well expected and exposed to
[1:16:04] live in such an atmosphere and conduct
[1:16:07] itself in such a way that God will be
[1:16:10] proud of this church to present it to
[1:16:12] Christ at the coming of the Lord. Amen.
[1:16:15] Watch. He said, "Now if the
[1:16:20] church, okay, God never intended the
[1:16:24] church to be governed by denomination,
[1:16:27] neither by creeds. If God only intended
[1:16:30] for the church to be governed or carried
[1:16:32] by creeds and denomination and
[1:16:34] intellectuals, then we do not need the
[1:16:36] Holy Spirit in the church. Its success
[1:16:39] will be placed upon intellectuals of the
[1:16:41] best of us. the better intellectual we
[1:16:43] would have, the more church progressive
[1:16:46] we will be. But in the word I find that
[1:16:50] God did not intend for the church to be
[1:16:51] governed by intellectual or by theology
[1:16:53] of man. But the Holy Spirit was given to
[1:16:56] the church to govern and control the
[1:16:59] body of Christ. Amen. So any man try to
[1:17:02] go uh govern the body of Christ, that is
[1:17:03] a real serious thing, you know, because
[1:17:06] he could govern bodies but not the body
[1:17:08] of Christ. Cuz that's a international
[1:17:10] bride body. Amen. That's a spirit body.
[1:17:12] As we said on Thursday night, when when
[1:17:14] you're baptized in water and you get put
[1:17:16] in water and you bury identify, God will
[1:17:18] take you on burying your spirit. Amen.
[1:17:21] Baptizing your spirit. When you come
[1:17:23] back up, you're soaking wet with spirit.
[1:17:25] Amen. All inside your spirit, your soul,
[1:17:27] your body, your being. Hallelujah. Your
[1:17:29] your your Amen. Your your your drench in
[1:17:32] the spirit of God. That's what God want
[1:17:33] to do you. Oh, do you believe that?
[1:17:36] Amen. Oh, praise the name of the Lord. I
[1:17:39] am positive sure this morning if men and
[1:17:41] women could only get into position to
[1:17:43] where their soul, their thinking, their
[1:17:45] attitude will be perfect in the sight of
[1:17:46] God, that would be one of the most
[1:17:48] powerful churches ever existed.
[1:17:51] Now, I know some of you know it, some of
[1:17:53] you may not from blasphemous names.
[1:17:55] Sister Shepherd had a dream about the
[1:17:58] Holy Spirit passing over her and waters
[1:17:59] and different things like that and a
[1:18:01] rock box and honey being poured into it
[1:18:03] and so on. And but Ram went and
[1:18:05] explained the dream and says no group or
[1:18:06] no church could hold the Holy Ghost. But
[1:18:08] the group as a group could hold the
[1:18:11] honey which is forgiveness. That way you
[1:18:13] can't get by hand by yourself. You can't
[1:18:15] shake your hand while God bless you.
[1:18:16] Forgive you. I drop yours. Has to have a
[1:18:18] group where you interact with people,
[1:18:21] where you get involved with people,
[1:18:22] where you get disappointment and so on.
[1:18:24] Give you the opportunity to say I'm
[1:18:26] sorry. Forgive me. I cannot see somebody
[1:18:29] go through the whole Christian life
[1:18:31] without saying I am sorry. I cannot I
[1:18:33] cannot expl I I don't accept that. I I
[1:18:36] cannot accept that. Even God repented
[1:18:38] and all and you can't repent. God
[1:18:42] repented when he do Nineveh. He's going
[1:18:44] to judge Nine. Nineveh repent and God
[1:18:46] repented of his intention. What he going
[1:18:48] to do for Nineveh? Hallelujah. So So in
[1:18:49] other words, so brotherly kindness,
[1:18:51] spirit of forgiveness give us the
[1:18:52] opportunity to say, "I'm sorry. Forgive
[1:18:54] me." And he gave you the opportunity to
[1:18:56] say, "I forgive you."
[1:18:59] I forgive you. You You should want to
[1:19:01] say that. I forgive you by thanks. No,
[1:19:04] not that part. Leave that part out.
[1:19:07] I forgive you but you shouldn't do me
[1:19:09] that.
[1:19:10] No, no. Do like what God do. Father,
[1:19:14] forgive them. Forgive as we forgive
[1:19:17] those who trespass against us. God going
[1:19:19] to forgive you. Just freely forgive.
[1:19:21] Drop it. Your visa don't stamp already
[1:19:23] on your way to glory. Oh my hallelujah.
[1:19:26] So watch I want to bring back something
[1:19:28] from there. Now he says now here is what
[1:19:32] wrong with the brand of tabernacle.
[1:19:34] There are two kinds of
[1:19:36] faith. There are two kinds of
[1:19:39] virtue. Two different kinds of
[1:19:41] knowledge. All right? Two different
[1:19:44] kinds of temperance. So we're not
[1:19:46] talking about painting the trainer
[1:19:48] itself with temperance and you have a
[1:19:49] sign mark temperance. I have temperance.
[1:19:51] No. Or you have a button mark temperance
[1:19:53] or time mark red. It means you have
[1:19:55] faith. It doesn't work that way. Or
[1:19:57] somebody breathing in
[1:19:59] faith virtue. It doesn't come in that
[1:20:01] way. All right. by breathing and all
[1:20:03] these exercises and so on. So it has the
[1:20:06] natural temperance, natural patience,
[1:20:08] natural knowledge. It have spiritual
[1:20:10] temperance, but I don't call it the
[1:20:12] temperance of Jesus Christ, the patience
[1:20:14] of Jesus Christ, the knowledge of Jesus
[1:20:16] Christ. After you get the blood
[1:20:17] transfusion,
[1:20:20] and blood transfusion mean they hook you
[1:20:22] up to the equipment and your blood going
[1:20:23] out and Jesus blood coming in. That
[1:20:27] brings in the blood of Jesus. It brings
[1:20:29] in the faith of Jesus, the virtue. In
[1:20:31] other words, you become a partaker of
[1:20:32] his divine nature by your blood going
[1:20:34] out. H. So he become to get the
[1:20:37] preeminent in your life. So listen how
[1:20:39] we bring it now. Patience. Quite
[1:20:42] pretending to be a nature-given faith.
[1:20:46] There's a nature-given faith and there's
[1:20:47] a need virtue. There are some people by
[1:20:50] nature they are patient. They're very
[1:20:52] patient. Even Job will be expressed
[1:20:55] impressed. But but it's not the patience
[1:20:57] of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen. It's
[1:21:00] just that is how they are. There are
[1:21:02] some people could listen and listen and
[1:21:04] listen and there's some people who could
[1:21:05] talk very very long. They cast a good
[1:21:08] morning in two words.
[1:21:11] They have to say it all over all over.
[1:21:13] And there's somebody who patience and
[1:21:15] the patient and time going patience
[1:21:17] patience going. That is not the patience
[1:21:19] of Jesus Christ. The patience of Jesus
[1:21:21] Christ surely have more things to do
[1:21:22] than that. That's right. Amen. So have
[1:21:24] natural patience and have Jesus
[1:21:26] patience. Amen. Now listen to how
[1:21:28] brother Brandon bringing it here. Now by
[1:21:30] hearing the word, it brings us to a
[1:21:33] mental recognition of God. But if this
[1:21:37] coming from above, if it ever strikes
[1:21:39] this, which is the Holy Spirit, a godly
[1:21:42] spiritual faith, then what does that
[1:21:45] faith do? That faith only recognizes the
[1:21:48] word.
[1:21:50] So when you hear the word, it's a mental
[1:21:52] faith. But when the Holy Ghost take that
[1:21:55] faith from here and drop it into here,
[1:21:59] what changes is that faith could only
[1:22:01] recognize the word. So somebody tell you
[1:22:04] you feel this and you feel that. It
[1:22:06] doesn't go by feeling. What does the
[1:22:08] word say?
[1:22:16] So no matter what anybody else says is
[1:22:18] only recognize the word because it's the
[1:22:20] word, right? So then the word itself is
[1:22:22] pouring into your faith, our mental
[1:22:25] faith becomes a spiritual revelation. I
[1:22:30] was a Catholic but when the Lord shine
[1:22:32] light on this message upon me, it was
[1:22:33] revealed to me and that lift me above
[1:22:36] all the criticism I got from my family.
[1:22:38] So my family couldn't family couldn't
[1:22:39] stop me from breaking out because it was
[1:22:42] a revelation. Now if it was
[1:22:44] intellectual, they could talk me out of
[1:22:46] it. If it's intellectual, anybody could
[1:22:48] talk you out of it. So just with a
[1:22:50] different talk your mind twist and you
[1:22:52] somewhere else you think somewhere
[1:22:54] somehow different but if you have a
[1:22:56] revelation you can't nobody can talk you
[1:22:58] out of it because Jesus said this way he
[1:23:01] said upon this rock I will build my
[1:23:06] church and the gates of hell is
[1:23:09] guaranteed not to prevail against it
[1:23:12] because the gates of hell will come
[1:23:14] against but it can't prevail.
[1:23:18] So whenever God give you a revelation,
[1:23:20] it doesn't mean no opposition. It just
[1:23:23] mean it can't
[1:23:26] prevail.
[1:23:28] Hell will fight it, but it can't
[1:23:32] prevail. That's why Jesus could tell
[1:23:35] them, "You can't touch me because my
[1:23:37] hour has not yet come."
[1:23:42] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He knew he had
[1:23:44] to be crucified. But he knew he had a
[1:23:46] ministry and they couldn't stop him
[1:23:48] before time.
[1:23:50] Hallelujah. And when the time came, he
[1:23:53] said, "My hour is now come." Oh, give
[1:23:56] the Lord some praises.
[1:24:00] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:24:02] So, let me tell you something. David
[1:24:05] said, "I was old. No, I was young. Now
[1:24:07] I'm old. I've never seen the righteous
[1:24:09] forsaken or in seed beg bread." You are
[1:24:12] not going to be bread. Forget about it.
[1:24:16] The devil's a liar. You are not going to
[1:24:19] be on the street. You are not going to
[1:24:21] be homeless. You are not going to be
[1:24:23] hungry. You're not going to be
[1:24:24] unprotected.
[1:24:31] Oh, hallelujah. Give the Lord a shout.
[1:24:42] may be seated.
[1:24:46] So the Holy Spirit coming down then he
[1:24:49] will give you a supernatural faith,
[1:24:52] spiritual faith. That faith only
[1:24:54] recognize the word,
[1:24:57] not ministers and and churches of just
[1:24:59] the word. Just take the word and slam it
[1:25:01] on that believer. They they'll say
[1:25:03] that's amen. That's the word. That's the
[1:25:06] truth. Because there's an anchor inside
[1:25:07] the soul. If the backslide is still
[1:25:10] there, Peter backslid, it was still
[1:25:12] there. Peter couldn't change it. He
[1:25:14] denied Christ. But there was a rock
[1:25:17] inside of him that the devil could not
[1:25:19] dig out, prime out, bulldoze out, ram
[1:25:23] out, jam out.
[1:25:30] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:25:33] Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:25:38] Wonderful. Hallelujah.
[1:25:41] Y stop belieing you. You know
[1:25:43] [Music]
[1:25:46] start to believe God.
[1:25:50] Gideon was believing Gideon.
[1:25:53] Until God say how to believe me. Gideon
[1:25:56] God tell Gideon a mighty man of valor.
[1:25:58] Gideon did not accept accept that. I'm
[1:26:00] the least of my father's house. My
[1:26:02] father has the least the tribe.
[1:26:03] Everybody least least least. Did God say
[1:26:05] finish? Yes. Mighty man of val.
[1:26:11] God had to tell that man that until it
[1:26:13] dropped from his head to his heart. God
[1:26:16] say, "You know what? Take more than
[1:26:17] that." Say, "By the sword of the Lord
[1:26:19] and of Gideon."
[1:26:21] Put your name in that battle. Put your
[1:26:23] name in that fight. Draw your sword.
[1:26:26] Hallelujah. Say you a son of God. Say
[1:26:29] you're a daughter of God. Say you'll
[1:26:31] overcome. Say you will break out. Reach
[1:26:34] out.
[1:26:41] [Applause]
[1:26:44] [Music]
[1:26:46] Some of you imprison your mind only in
[1:26:48] your mind. But I come this morning to
[1:26:50] bust you out.
[1:26:54] I come to break you out this morning.
[1:26:56] Break you out the prison of your mind.
[1:26:58] Break you out the prison of your
[1:26:59] limitations. I have no education. I
[1:27:02] can't read. I can't write. and this this
[1:27:03] I no good job and what not. Forget all
[1:27:04] of that. Break out all of that. That
[1:27:06] have nothing to do with the program of
[1:27:07] God. Bible say she he needs Patrick
[1:27:10] Samaria. Somehow connected this woman at
[1:27:12] a wealthy forgiven like a tire preach
[1:27:14] upon her about her. I will still be
[1:27:17] preaching about her. You you'll get
[1:27:18] weary hear me preach about her because I
[1:27:20] feel just like that woman. He needs pass
[1:27:23] through my way to find me. And since I
[1:27:26] see my name on the book, the devil in
[1:27:27] trouble.
[1:27:42] Please pastor Samaria. Hallelujah. To
[1:27:45] pick up a seed, to pick up a name in the
[1:27:47] book. Oh, hallelujah. Praise God. Praise
[1:27:50] God. Hallelujah. So now watch. Number
[1:27:54] one, coming down into a mental faith
[1:27:57] comes down the Holy Spirit. Yes. So for
[1:27:59] there's mental faith. But Ram say
[1:28:01] intellectually we hearing the message
[1:28:03] but it have to bathe down. It has to get
[1:28:06] into spirit. He said he said I believe
[1:28:08] we have received the message but we're
[1:28:09] hearing it intellectually. Books and
[1:28:11] tape everybody's reading, studying,
[1:28:12] listening and so that's fine. That's
[1:28:13] good. You have to do that. But then you
[1:28:16] have to get room for spirit to bay down
[1:28:19] and get this intellectual thing more in
[1:28:21] the spirit thing. But you're feeling
[1:28:23] good about yourself, about your life,
[1:28:26] about God. You love Jesus. I miss your
[1:28:29] trial. You love Jesus. You lost this.
[1:28:31] You still love Jesus.
[1:28:33] Still love the Lord. You're sick, but
[1:28:35] you love Jesus. You're not trying to
[1:28:37] duck hell. You love Jesus. You're not
[1:28:40] trying to escape because you have no
[1:28:41] testimony. You want to go to heaven. I
[1:28:42] want to go to heaven. Take me to heaven,
[1:28:44] Lord. Why?
[1:28:47] Well, I get in trouble in the
[1:28:51] job. I remember some teachers in my job
[1:28:53] used to say, "Oh, boy. All the
[1:28:54] Christians, only heaven." I said, "No,
[1:28:56] not this one." I say I want to be a
[1:28:58] testimony to you guys.
[1:29:02] I said that that dying and going on is
[1:29:04] easy enough. It's to leave your mark on
[1:29:06] earth.
[1:29:08] It's one life you have to live.
[1:29:11] You want a real testimony. And the
[1:29:13] testimony can only come when the test
[1:29:15] come.
[1:29:16] [Music]
[1:29:18] Right now you right now everybody are
[1:29:19] believers. Everybody believe you. But
[1:29:21] then when you go out Satan waiting to
[1:29:23] see to qualify how much you really
[1:29:25] believe. Amen. It's so easy. Amen. Just
[1:29:29] disappear on that one day.
[1:29:32] Because the secret things belong to God.
[1:29:35] But the things that are revealed belong
[1:29:36] to us. That's first thing. Once it
[1:29:38] revealed, it's ours. The prophet
[1:29:40] revealed it. That's ours. Nobody can say
[1:29:42] it's not yours. It's yours. Deuteronomy
[1:29:45] 29:29 said so.
[1:29:48] [Applause]
[1:29:50] So every revealed promise is us. Give
[1:29:52] the Lord a sh. Every revealed promise
[1:29:55] belongs to us.
[1:29:57] Do I shout in the house for that?
[1:30:03] [Applause]
[1:30:08] Things that are revealed unto us and to
[1:30:09] our children that we may do.
[1:30:13] [Music]
[1:30:16] So watch. Oh, we going good. Number one,
[1:30:21] coming down into your mental faith comes
[1:30:23] the Holy Spirit.
[1:30:25] making it a spiritual faith. Then that
[1:30:28] spiritual faith, this is imperman now
[1:30:31] recognizes only the word. Amen. Number
[1:30:34] two, then you have a spiritual you have
[1:30:36] the holy spirit seal all these things
[1:30:39] into you as the holy spirit covers this.
[1:30:42] Now here we go from your
[1:30:45] faith to the holy spirit what is he
[1:30:48] speaking about? We don't have the
[1:30:50] pyramid here but the pyramid have faith,
[1:30:52] virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience,
[1:30:54] godliness, brotherly kindness and on top
[1:30:56] brotherly kindness have holy spirit. All
[1:30:58] right. So he is saying from your faith
[1:31:01] the holy spirit that slot seals you in
[1:31:05] with Christ. Amen.
[1:31:09] Do you get that now?
[1:31:12] Faith, mental faith, tongue on the Holy
[1:31:14] Ghost. Spiritual revelation. Bam.
[1:31:16] There's a rock inside your soul. Amen.
[1:31:18] God could drop you in China, it is still
[1:31:20] there. Australia, it is still there. He
[1:31:22] could drop you in prison, it is still
[1:31:24] there. He could drop you wherever he
[1:31:25] drop you, it is still there. Nothing
[1:31:28] could move that. That's a rock. That is
[1:31:32] flesh and blood had not revealed it to
[1:31:34] you. But my father have revealed it unto
[1:31:37] you. That's a pastor share it with you.
[1:31:39] Some deacon play it for you. No, it's a
[1:31:42] revelation in your soul.
[1:31:44] Hallelujah.
[1:31:47] [Applause]
[1:31:48] Wonderful. Watch. Hallelujah.
[1:31:53] From your faith up to the Holy Spirit
[1:31:56] seals you with Christ. Then you become
[1:31:58] one. Amen. Christ and you live together.
[1:32:00] At that day you will know that I'm in
[1:32:03] the father. The father in me and I in
[1:32:05] you and you in me. Then here we go.
[1:32:07] That's a sealed unit of the Lord God.
[1:32:12] Now then, here we go. They are
[1:32:15] vindicated and placed.
[1:32:17] When that time takes place, they
[1:32:21] become vindicated sons. Amen. And
[1:32:25] vindicated daughters. Right now, we are
[1:32:28] just sons and daughters. But when that
[1:32:30] time comes, when that time comes, when
[1:32:33] that time comes, they become vindicated
[1:32:36] sons and vindicated daughters. This is
[1:32:39] my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased.
[1:32:43] Oh, give the Lord some praises. Jesus
[1:32:45] Christ, a man approved of God.
[1:32:55] This is not people claiming this and
[1:32:56] claiming that and saying this, this and
[1:32:58] saying that and raising their own flag.
[1:33:00] This is not that. This is God's approval
[1:33:04] by vindication,
[1:33:06] confirmation,
[1:33:08] manifestation.
[1:33:10] This is my son. This is my daughter. I
[1:33:14] am with her. I am with him. Oh,
[1:33:18] hallelujah. When you walk, God is
[1:33:20] walking.
[1:33:22] Hallelujah. Angel of the Lord encamp all
[1:33:25] around about
[1:33:26] you. You are
[1:33:29] protected. You are covered. Covered by
[1:33:32] his blood, covered by the token.
[1:33:40] Oh, glory to
[1:33:42] God. Your life becomes overshadowed with
[1:33:46] God.
[1:33:47] [Music]
[1:33:50] You may be seated. I want to bring back
[1:33:52] something I read last Sunday from man
[1:33:55] running from the presence of the Lord. A
[1:33:56] prayer. Amen. But when I was praying, he
[1:33:59] was saying, "May all the great mysteries
[1:34:03] that we are supposed to know at this
[1:34:05] age, Lord,
[1:34:07] be unveiled to
[1:34:08] us, and we will see the plainness of
[1:34:13] God." Amen. So that we will know how to
[1:34:17] behave ourselves and
[1:34:19] act correcting
[1:34:21] ourselves and bringing the members of
[1:34:24] our body into discipline to the word
[1:34:28] that we might know how to live in this
[1:34:31] present day at the approaching of the
[1:34:33] Lord Jesus. Let's take that slowly.
[1:34:37] May all the great mysteries that we
[1:34:39] supposed to know at this age be unveiled
[1:34:42] to us.
[1:34:44] What's the purpose? That we might see
[1:34:47] the plainness of God.
[1:34:52] Listen carefully now. This is my burden.
[1:34:55] God was so mysterious. He wanted to
[1:34:58] reveal himself.
[1:35:01] His purpose and objective and goal was
[1:35:04] to reveal himself,
[1:35:06] not for him to be mysterious.
[1:35:09] So he had to find a way to unfold this
[1:35:11] great mystery of what he was.
[1:35:14] So whenever he begin to reveal himself,
[1:35:17] it's supposed to produce the plainness
[1:35:20] of God.
[1:35:22] It's supposed to produce a God in
[1:35:24] simplicity reveal himself to his people.
[1:35:28] And he did that through Jesus Christ
[1:35:35] because Christ his life unveiled God.
[1:35:41] [Music]
[1:35:44] I wonder if you catch that.
[1:35:47] People take the mysteries as a as a
[1:35:49] intellectual swordfighting argumentative
[1:35:52] tool.
[1:35:53] I have one more machine than you.
[1:35:56] I know more mysteries than you. My
[1:35:58] mystery more hidden than your
[1:36:03] own. Like long time preachers are preach
[1:36:06] make some strange statements and say let
[1:36:07] me break it down. So why didn't they
[1:36:08] break down to begin in the first place?
[1:36:11] They make a long long highutin statement
[1:36:14] and and and the people lost. People
[1:36:16] lost. Let me break it down.
[1:36:20] I thought that was supposed to be
[1:36:21] happening. Right to
[1:36:23] vision.
[1:36:25] and make it plain.
[1:36:28] Brother Brandham said, "I hope God raise
[1:36:29] up men to make more sense to this."
[1:36:33] Hallelujah. Raise up mighty men to to
[1:36:36] make more sense to what the message is
[1:36:40] that when you see it, you can say, "Wait
[1:36:41] a minute. This is mine." You mean I
[1:36:43] could have it? You mean I don't wait for
[1:36:45] the preacher to lay hands on the sick?
[1:36:47] You mean these signs shall follow them
[1:36:48] that believe? You mean I could cast out
[1:36:50] devils? You mean I could run that demons
[1:36:52] pray out of town? You mean I could
[1:36:54] overcome? You mean I could be filled
[1:36:56] with the Holy Ghost? You mean I could be
[1:36:57] a vindicated son, a vindicated daughter?
[1:36:59] You mean I could get my inheritance? You
[1:37:01] mean I could go to the angel? You mean I
[1:37:03] can claim the book?
[1:37:06] [Applause]
[1:37:16] Hallelujah.
[1:37:19] I don't have the whistle like brother
[1:37:20] George Smith
[1:37:22] in Germany had a big whistle. Anybody
[1:37:24] sleeping? Said you there.
[1:37:28] I don't think I need that
[1:37:31] whistle. Re chapter 4. Brother, the same
[1:37:35] voice that summoned John come up. That
[1:37:38] same voice will summon the church
[1:37:40] someday. Amen. Amen. The same voice that
[1:37:43] sum summoned John to come up. The same
[1:37:46] voice that summons dead Lazarus out of
[1:37:48] the grave. That same voice of the
[1:37:51] archangel.
[1:37:52] Christ is the voice of the archangel.
[1:37:57] Who is the voice of the archangel?
[1:37:59] Some man in America. Some man in France
[1:38:02] or Germany or somewhere? No. Christ is
[1:38:06] the voice of the archangel.
[1:38:08] Yeah, brother. We got the doctrine of
[1:38:11] Christ. Amen. We believe he's the son of
[1:38:12] God. These things are wonderful. But
[1:38:15] leaving that, let us go on to
[1:38:18] perfection. Oh my. He said, "I wish I
[1:38:21] had the voice of an archangel now to
[1:38:24] bring this to a place where you could
[1:38:26] see it." Amen. So the voice of the
[1:38:29] archangel ministry, Yes, sir. which is
[1:38:32] the ministry of Christ, is to bring it
[1:38:34] to a place where you could see it.
[1:38:37] You have to see something bigger than
[1:38:39] you.
[1:38:40] [Music]
[1:38:43] You have to see something more powerful
[1:38:45] than you.
[1:38:47] You have to see redeeming love. You have
[1:38:50] to see restoration, grace. You have to
[1:38:52] see the power of reconciliation. You
[1:38:54] have to see the power of forgiveness.
[1:38:56] You have to see the quickening power
[1:38:58] could bring you out of what you in. Your
[1:39:00] cancer could be healed. your tumor, your
[1:39:03] diabetes, your high blood pressure,
[1:39:05] whatever condition, he's a healer.
[1:39:11] Peter, Peter cut off a man ears and
[1:39:13] Jesus take up the man ears off the
[1:39:14] ground and stick it back and he didn't
[1:39:16] lose glue.
[1:39:18] [Music]
[1:39:21] That man air was right back in position.
[1:39:23] Just a touch. Only a touch. Just a touch
[1:39:26] this morning. Oh, anybody want to touch
[1:39:28] this? Just a
[1:39:29] touch. Amen.
[1:39:34] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:39:37] So therefore, the voice of the archangel
[1:39:40] is to bring it to a place where you
[1:39:43] could see it.
[1:39:45] Thank you, Lord. The Lord is with a
[1:39:48] shout. Praise God. And the voice of the
[1:39:52] archangel. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:39:55] Could you take a little more? Of course
[1:39:57] you could take a little more. This is
[1:39:59] what you come here for. You come here to
[1:40:01] go home. You come here to take the word,
[1:40:02] man. Give me the
[1:40:04] book. Give the Lord a shout.
[1:40:07] Give the Lord a praise offering.
[1:40:10] Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:40:13] Glory. All I want is the word, you know.
[1:40:16] Hallelujah.
[1:40:20] Amen.
[1:40:22] God's purpose expressed through the acts
[1:40:25] of the believers. I ain't get to that
[1:40:26] yet, but we get to it. Amen. Cuz God
[1:40:28] wanted to destroy the Philistines in the
[1:40:30] race of a man named
[1:40:31] Samson. And Samson Bam says was no big
[1:40:34] muscular man going for the gym and he
[1:40:36] had big big hard muscles. Samson wasn't
[1:40:38] like that. A little rum little fella
[1:40:41] with some little ghouish looking curls.
[1:40:42] Seven of them. Nothing looking like this
[1:40:45] superman. This big S on his chest. He he
[1:40:48] didn't have that. All used to happen is
[1:40:51] the spirit come upon Samson.
[1:40:54] That's it. No books, no tapes.
[1:40:57] Feel like dancing right now. No books,
[1:41:01] no tapes. No books, no tapes. Just the
[1:41:04] spirit come upon him. Just the spirit
[1:41:07] come upon him. Samson know what to do.
[1:41:10] When they meet the lion, just the spirit
[1:41:11] come upon him. Samson know what to do.
[1:41:14] When they headed in the city, he take up
[1:41:16] the doorpost. He take up the hinge. He
[1:41:19] take up the whole the the whole gate
[1:41:21] with the post and put it on a hill. Just
[1:41:25] the spirit. When the spirit of the Lord
[1:41:27] comes upon my heart, I would sing like
[1:41:30] David sang. I will dance like David
[1:41:32] does. I will shout like David
[1:41:36] shout. Something when the spirit comes
[1:41:39] upon your life.
[1:41:43] [Music]
[1:41:46] You may be seated.
[1:41:48] What? Amen.
[1:41:51] What what did the spirit get a hold of
[1:41:54] to make these believers, brethren,
[1:41:56] prophets, saints of old act the way they
[1:41:59] act? What made Abraham believe God for
[1:42:04] 25 years? A old man, his wife, old have
[1:42:07] no children. And God say, Abraham,
[1:42:09] Sarah,
[1:42:12] she old, but Sarah,
[1:42:14] no curse, you know. Sarah, treat her
[1:42:17] right. You know, Abraham because it's
[1:42:19] true. Sarah
[1:42:23] so Abraham can't say well divorce she
[1:42:24] you know because she a making no bake
[1:42:26] she a making no cake she grumpy she want
[1:42:28] to cook
[1:42:30] no God don't tell him through Sarah so
[1:42:33] Abra in a bind so to speak God want him
[1:42:37] in that bind
[1:42:40] God want to produce a promise God want
[1:42:42] to show he could take nothing and make
[1:42:44] something God want to show he could take
[1:42:47] old and make young God want show. He
[1:42:49] could take your old condition and make
[1:42:51] it new. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He could renew
[1:42:53] you. Yeah. He could change you. He could
[1:42:56] rearrange you. That's God we serve. Oh,
[1:43:00] give the Lord a shout in the house.
[1:43:05] What season? What? What would make a man
[1:43:09] testify for 25 years? Go to the doctor
[1:43:12] to run him out and say, "Don't come
[1:43:13] back. Don't come back. Take your money.
[1:43:14] I don't want your money. Don't come
[1:43:15] back." Abraham say, "But God said, I'm
[1:43:17] going to have a son." He said, "I don't
[1:43:18] want to even check you no more." It's
[1:43:20] because it's God's faith in the man,
[1:43:23] God's seed in the man, without a
[1:43:25] scripture,
[1:43:28] [Music]
[1:43:30] without a book, without a quote, but God
[1:43:34] acting out his life through his
[1:43:37] believers.
[1:43:39] He's about to restore back his image.
[1:43:42] The devil is clueless because when man
[1:43:44] fell, he be to bring back his image by
[1:43:47] bringing Abraham faith, Isaac love,
[1:43:52] Jacob grace, Joseph perfection and he
[1:43:56] put a platform and on top of that he
[1:43:58] bring prophet after prophet after
[1:44:00] prophet beginning at Moses to build up
[1:44:03] the body work. Then John the Baptist
[1:44:05] come as the neck part and Jesus come as
[1:44:07] the head the cap of the old testament
[1:44:11] and become the cornerstone of the new
[1:44:12] testament. God was always building. His
[1:44:16] objective is to restore. His objective
[1:44:18] is to bring back the image. His goal is
[1:44:21] to bring back that perfect
[1:44:25] man back on the
[1:44:27] earth. He has done it.
[1:44:36] Not will do it. He has done it. Amen.
[1:44:40] You may be seated. Understand this.
[1:44:42] Amen. When Adam fell, Amen. the book
[1:44:46] that Adam had. All right. Or what he was
[1:44:48] to release because Adam was supposed to
[1:44:50] release the names. Yes. Of the sons from
[1:44:53] that book. Yes. Yes. By spoken word. So
[1:44:56] Adam's son was to be born like how he
[1:44:58] came forth as it was by spoken word. But
[1:45:01] because he fell it went into sex and
[1:45:03] that's how we get baby born and what and
[1:45:05] go through that process. But watch this.
[1:45:07] Jesus come back and say you must be born
[1:45:08] again of word and of spirit. So this
[1:45:13] second birth is back to Adam again.
[1:45:15] Where gene thought word activated inside
[1:45:18] of you. Hallelujah. Are you with me? So
[1:45:21] the book that Adam had this mysterious
[1:45:23] book of God went back in the hands of
[1:45:25] the original owner. This book of names.
[1:45:31] This book always had names. Adam was
[1:45:33] commissioned to multiply.
[1:45:36] Hallelujah. Bring forth on the earth.
[1:45:38] Make more sons like you. Express more
[1:45:42] sons like you. Having my purpose, having
[1:45:45] my objective, having the goal of God, I
[1:45:49] want more like that.
[1:45:53] [Music]
[1:45:54] [Applause]
[1:45:57] So when Adam fell, lost the book, the
[1:46:00] book went back in the hands of vision
[1:46:02] owner. The one that sat on the throne.
[1:46:05] Hallelujah. That book that Aman had is
[1:46:08] now in the hands of one that sat upon
[1:46:10] the throne. That book is to be loosed.
[1:46:13] Amen. That book is to be unveiled. That
[1:46:15] book is to be released because there are
[1:46:17] names that has to be called. Amen. The
[1:46:19] thing of it is the names has always been
[1:46:21] unfolded not knowing it was names. All
[1:46:24] the ages gone past is the book being
[1:46:26] unfolded because God promised in the
[1:46:28] last day the prophet will come and make
[1:46:30] known what took place all along. So the
[1:46:33] prophet come at the very end and say you
[1:46:35] know what there were names called in
[1:46:37] that age names called in that age name
[1:46:39] and name going to be called in this age.
[1:46:40] So the Lord is there with a shout
[1:46:43] revelation chapter 10 with the book
[1:46:45] open. Seven thunders throw the voices
[1:46:48] out because seven thunder will catch
[1:46:49] that bride. Seven thunders will get
[1:46:51] every name on that book, he knew when
[1:46:53] them voices go out, it will connect to
[1:46:56] the elect. It will connect to the
[1:46:58] predestinated. It will connect to the
[1:47:01] elected. Hallelujah. Praise God. That
[1:47:05] will be your land. That will be your
[1:47:07] inheritance. That will be your portion.
[1:47:10] John represented the bride. Give the
[1:47:13] Lord a shout in the house. You may be
[1:47:16] seated. Praise God. Praise God. Notice,
[1:47:19] notice it was the Lord himself.
[1:47:22] Descend with a shout, Jesus himself.
[1:47:26] Come down in his word because he making
[1:47:28] no mistake this time. No mistake this
[1:47:31] time about who is his wife, who is his
[1:47:34] bride. He going to be called by the word
[1:47:37] itself. That's why the word does
[1:47:39] something to you. You can't help it. You
[1:47:43] can't help it. You can't help it. You
[1:47:46] are hearing from your theophony. Oh,
[1:47:49] glory to God. You can't help it.
[1:48:08] [Applause]
[1:48:19] [Music]
[1:48:20] [Applause]
[1:48:26] Let me be seated. Hallelujah. Right now,
[1:48:29] Satan trembling. He's trembling because
[1:48:32] he he's concerned with you getting to
[1:48:35] know who you are. This is the problem.
[1:48:37] You see when Moses time come the those
[1:48:40] witchcraft people and those wizards and
[1:48:42] so on they know somebody born. They know
[1:48:45] the stars announce the herald of a child
[1:48:47] special child. They ask for counsel what
[1:48:50] what to do. What pharaoh say what to do?
[1:48:52] Say kill. They say kill kill every baby.
[1:48:54] Must catch up with him. You must catch
[1:48:56] up with him. Everyone for three years
[1:48:58] and under two years and kill everybody.

[1:49:09] stuffing a child, hiding child under the
[1:49:10] crib on on all about they hiding
[1:49:12] nothing. They said the Lord give we
[1:49:15] giving back to God. Make a act and among
[1:49:19] alligators that's how it's fatal. You
[1:49:21] see if your mind stud alligator who call
[1:49:23] me

[1:49:27] But these people because of faith you

[1:49:31] child have a light on him.
[1:49:36] Do you know you have a light over you?

[1:50:59] out here. You are Christian. You come
[1:51:02] from God. You're going back to God. You
[1:51:04] are elected. You are predestinated. Who
[1:51:07] he fully he called. Who he call, he
[1:51:09] justified. Who he justified.
[1:51:12] He had already glorified. Give the Lord
[1:51:15] a shout.
[1:51:20] [Applause]
[1:51:39] You may be seated.
[1:51:41] My this book is a mysterious book. It's
[1:51:45] a book of redemption. Amen. At the end
[1:51:47] of the age, the seven age will begin the
[1:51:49] song. He winds up all the loose ends
[1:51:52] which them fellas probes are. Now the
[1:51:55] loose end is not the message. Serpent
[1:51:57] seed baptize in the name of Jesus
[1:51:59] Christ. That not the message. That is
[1:52:02] loose ends. Things that supposed to be
[1:52:05] corrected before you come to your
[1:52:07] message.
[1:52:08] [Music]
[1:52:10] There's something called loose ends.
[1:52:13] Information. Daniel go thy way. The book
[1:52:15] is sealed to the time of the end.
[1:52:17] Knowledge shall increase. God will
[1:52:18] clarify issues and things that we did
[1:52:21] not know back there. He will clarify
[1:52:24] that. Knowing Kane is supen seed that
[1:52:26] doesn't help you for the rapture.
[1:52:30] Kane being super seed doesn't give you
[1:52:31] rapturing power. You know Kane is seed
[1:52:34] and serpent seed and supenced. What do
[1:52:35] you do with that?
[1:52:39] You are not that he's killing his
[1:52:42] family.
[1:52:43] Well, listen to the prophet now. When
[1:52:46] the seven angel begin to song his
[1:52:47] mystery, he winds up all the loose ends
[1:52:50] that he's fellow proved that. Are you
[1:52:52] ready? Amen. Are you ready? Anybody
[1:52:55] sleeping? Raise your hands. All right.
[1:52:56] Nobody
[1:52:58] sleep you. I don't whistle, but I'll
[1:53:01] check the raise your
[1:53:06] hands. Here we go. The mysteries come
[1:53:10] down from God. Amen. As the word of God,
[1:53:15] and reveals the entire revelation of
[1:53:18] God.
[1:53:20] The mysteries themselves come down as
[1:53:21] the word. So when the word is preached,
[1:53:25] the mysteries is being preached. Amen.
[1:53:29] Hallelujah.
[1:53:32] Now, God's great secret mystery that he
[1:53:36] had before the world began in the back
[1:53:39] part of God's mind. There was something
[1:53:42] he was trying to achieve. He had a
[1:53:45] motive in order to let himself be
[1:53:48] expressed.
[1:53:50] So, first he made the angels to worship
[1:53:52] him and that make him becomes God. God
[1:53:56] had a purpose and a hidden mystery.
[1:53:58] Amen. And that's what I want to speak to
[1:54:00] you this church this morning. The hidden
[1:54:02] mystery of God that he had in his mind
[1:54:04] unfolded back to this present hour. God
[1:54:07] great mystery is a secret. He kept it a
[1:54:11] secret. Not even the angels understand
[1:54:14] it. He didn't reveal it. That's the
[1:54:18] reason under when the seventh seal was
[1:54:21] opened, there was silence. Even the son
[1:54:24] himself don't know when it's going to
[1:54:25] happen. God kept that all to himself.
[1:54:28] Amen. John was even a forbidden to write
[1:54:30] it. The coming of the Lord. That's the
[1:54:32] one thing he hasn't revealed yet. How he
[1:54:35] will come and when he will come. Here we
[1:54:38] go. Therefore, this is where I want to
[1:54:40] get to. The entire Bible is the
[1:54:43] revelation of God's mystery in Christ.
[1:54:48] Here we go. The entire Bible is an
[1:54:52] expression of one goal that God had.
[1:54:56] Yeah. One purpose he wanted to achieve
[1:54:59] in the entire Bible. And all the acts of
[1:55:02] the believers. That's where I get my
[1:55:04] thought from. All the acts of the
[1:55:07] believers in the Bible has been in type
[1:55:10] expressing what God great goal is.
[1:55:14] And now is the last days. He has
[1:55:16] revealed it and he has shown it. God had
[1:55:20] a three-fold purpose. One, God wanted to
[1:55:22] reveal himself to the people. So God
[1:55:25] become from God become to me to take my
[1:55:27] sin upon him that he might make me him
[1:55:29] and go back to his great purpose as sons
[1:55:32] and daughters of God. The attribute that
[1:55:34] was in him. Now watch the coming of the
[1:55:37] Lord is a mystery. We don't know when he
[1:55:39] is coming, how he is coming, but we know
[1:55:41] he is coming. So was all the mysteries
[1:55:44] of God waiting for this last day. Here
[1:55:46] we go. After it's already been
[1:55:50] completed, then he reveal and show what
[1:55:54] he has done. Amen. Amen. Pause a little
[1:55:57] bit. Amen. After it's completed. Amen.
[1:56:00] Then he reveal what he has done. So he's
[1:56:04] not revealing it as it unfolds. When
[1:56:06] it's completed, he reveal it and
[1:56:08] identify it. So watch, he never give his
[1:56:11] mystery in full. Hear the bum. It's like
[1:56:14] comparing the seven seals. Now when God
[1:56:17] used Martin Luther for the coming out of
[1:56:20] that first church or that church age,
[1:56:23] then he used John Wesley, he gradually
[1:56:26] brought them out. Here we go. And was
[1:56:30] revealing in them that church age.
[1:56:35] So they were just living out, living out
[1:56:38] a mystery of a church age. Amen. And
[1:56:40] they didn't even know in them the
[1:56:43] mystery of the church age was being
[1:56:44] lived out as a church's messenger and
[1:56:47] they didn't even know it. It took a
[1:56:49] prophet to come at the end of time and
[1:56:51] say Paul, Martin, Luther, Wesley,
[1:56:53] Columbus, and so all of them.
[1:56:56] Because it's already completed. Then he
[1:56:58] could reveal every messenger for every
[1:57:00] age. Hallelujah. Are you with me?
[1:57:02] Hallelujah. So Luther, he preached
[1:57:05] justification and just pounded away. But
[1:57:08] he didn't know what his age was.
[1:57:11] Hallelujah.
[1:57:12] Where's the the same way right now? We
[1:57:14] are pulling away and we living in a
[1:57:15] bride age.
[1:57:19] Mystery being unfolded right now in you.
[1:57:22] Let's continue. Moses was veiled. The
[1:57:26] living word of God veiled behind human
[1:57:28] flesh. Brother, sister, it's been veiled
[1:57:31] through the ages according to the word
[1:57:32] of God. It will be open in the last
[1:57:34] days. Those seven seals will be broke
[1:57:35] and the full thing will come into view
[1:57:37] of the people. What took place all
[1:57:39] along? The hour of the seven angels
[1:57:41] message. All the mysteries of God should
[1:57:44] be made known in that Elijah. Amen.
[1:57:47] Amen. Amen. All the mysteries will be
[1:57:50] made known in that Elijah. So brother
[1:57:52] Brandon himself was holding the mystery
[1:57:54] of God. Amen. He was a son of man
[1:57:57] revealing the son of man. He was holding
[1:57:59] Christ. The seventh seal was veiled in
[1:58:02] him. Amen.
[1:58:05] Hallelujah. Oh hallelujah.
[1:58:08] So watch all the mysteries of God shall
[1:58:10] be made known in that Elijah. How that
[1:58:14] Christ is put out of his church. One he
[1:58:16] revealed a son of man again. How the
[1:58:19] church is to be put in order in the last
[1:58:21] days. No creed,
[1:58:24] no denomination. Just here we go. The
[1:58:27] word living in the individual.
[1:58:30] I want a bigger shout than that.
[1:58:33] He is saying how the church will come in
[1:58:35] order. We can't say we believe this
[1:58:37] tick, we believe that tick or we believe
[1:58:39] that tick. No, no, no ticks. It has to
[1:58:42] come down to the word living in the
[1:58:47] individual.
[1:58:49] Not who your pastor is, not where you go
[1:58:51] to church. That is irrelevant. It has to
[1:58:53] be the word
[1:58:56] living in you. So if a earthquake come
[1:58:59] and break up train that in 24 parts and
[1:59:02] there is no church to go to, it still
[1:59:03] have to be the word living.
[1:59:07] Amen. Oh, glory to God.
[1:59:10] People think election is something that
[1:59:13] has been hatched up here lately. That's
[1:59:15] one of the oldest teachings that we
[1:59:17] have. Election and calling. So Ireneius,
[1:59:21] here we go, was one of the angels of the
[1:59:24] church age. As we seen, as we studied,
[1:59:26] we believe, of course, now they were all
[1:59:29] mysteries. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:59:33] Did you hear that? They were all
[1:59:37] mysteries. Paul was a mystery. Arenas
[1:59:39] was a mystery. Columbus was a mystery.
[1:59:42] Seven mysteries.
[1:59:45] But they are to be revealed in the last
[1:59:47] day. It started off with Paul. So we
[1:59:50] understand that these messengers they
[1:59:52] were mysteries. They were mysteries hid.
[1:59:57] Let me read it
[1:59:58] again. Course they were all mysteries.
[2:00:01] They are all here hid right here in
[2:00:02] these seals.
[2:00:05] Could we give the Lord a shout on that
[2:00:06] day? This is not me trying to explain
[2:00:08] this. This is what the prophet is saying
[2:00:10] that these men were mysteries hidden the
[2:00:13] seals and the prophet came at the end of
[2:00:15] the age and reveal it. Look a mystery
[2:00:18] here. Look a mystery there. Look another
[2:00:20] mystery here. Look a mystery here. You
[2:00:21] talk about mysteries.
[2:00:26] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:00:31] Someday he comes forth to get this book
[2:00:33] that he's
[2:00:34] redeemed. And all that's in the book
[2:00:36] would be him. For that's the believer.
[2:00:39] The words in the book.
[2:00:44] Who is the believer?
[2:00:46] Who are the believers? the words
[2:00:50] in the book. And as Isaac preached, when
[2:00:53] we read our book, you see the voice of
[2:00:55] one crying in the wilderness.
[2:00:57] When God look at his book, he see John
[2:00:59] the Baptist.
[2:01:02] [Applause]
[2:01:04] Are you with me now? So we see
[2:01:07] scripture, God see
[2:01:14] individuals. In our book, we see a
[2:01:16] virgin shall conceive. But in God's
[2:01:18] book, you see Mary. Give the Lord a
[2:01:21] shout.
[2:01:26] So John the Baptist, he had to live out
[2:01:28] the scripture, the voice of one crying
[2:01:32] in the wilderness. So he had to go in
[2:01:33] the wilderness and step out as the voice
[2:01:36] of one. And he's fulfilling the
[2:01:37] scripture. A mystery is being unfolded.
[2:01:41] You hear what I'm saying?
[2:01:44] [Applause]
[2:01:45] [Music]
[2:01:49] Hallelujah. Amen. Then it says this is
[2:01:52] time. But Ram says, "Amen. Time shall be
[2:01:54] no more." He announces that time is
[2:01:56] over. What happens? Could that now be
[2:01:58] so, brethren? Seriously, think. If it
[2:02:01] is, then the pyramid is capped by the
[2:02:03] seven thunders. You remember the pre
[2:02:05] message? It's the capstone. What did it
[2:02:07] do? Here we go. He's going back to the
[2:02:09] perfect man. The Holy Spirit capped off
[2:02:12] the individual and sealed it. When we
[2:02:14] added to our faith, righteousness and
[2:02:16] godliness and faith, we kept adding
[2:02:18] seven things. Now, that's how he makes
[2:02:20] the individual, then he caps him and
[2:02:22] seal him with the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[2:02:25] Then he comes to say, if that be so,
[2:02:30] hear what this person has. He has got
[2:02:32] seven ages that he had seven mysteries
[2:02:36] that has been sounded away and they
[2:02:38] fought for to bring back and now the
[2:02:40] headstone comes to cap off the church.
[2:02:42] Does the thunders mean that my brethren?
[2:02:46] So when these virtues are in an
[2:02:47] individual, what that person have is not
[2:02:50] just virtues, they have seven mysteries,
[2:02:53] seven ages, seven lights, seven
[2:02:56] rainbows, hallelujah, seven voices,
[2:03:00] seven thunders, all that wrapped up in
[2:03:03] our individual, the devil is scared and
[2:03:06] shaken because these thunders overcome
[2:03:09] in every age. God releasing to you the
[2:03:13] overcoming power that got victory over
[2:03:15] the devil in every age. God gathers it
[2:03:19] up and put it in a bride and put that
[2:03:23] bride on the earth. We beat him in Paul
[2:03:25] age. We whip him in Ireia's age. In
[2:03:28] Columbus and Luther we put licks on him.
[2:03:30] In Lutheran Wesley we overcome in the we
[2:03:33] every age. There was a bunch of
[2:03:35] overcomers. What about our day? What
[2:03:38] about our age? when God is about to
[2:03:40] release the full power back into the
[2:03:43] church. Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[2:03:48] Oh, glory to God. Just a little more.
[2:03:50] We're going to wrap up. You may be
[2:03:52] seated. Notice before the throne was
[2:03:54] seven stars. Amen. The voice of the
[2:03:57] stars. Not one voice. Voice is plural.
[2:03:59] Amen. God. What is it? Hear the
[2:04:02] interpretation. God speaking to the
[2:04:04] church. So when you look at the
[2:04:06] scriptures, see voices and lightning and
[2:04:08] thunders. When the prophet look at it
[2:04:10] now that's God speaking to the church
[2:04:15] reflecting himself the bomb through
[2:04:18] seven spirits
[2:04:21] [Applause]
[2:04:23] hallelujah so the seven spirits coming
[2:04:26] about for God to reflect himself by red
[2:04:30] orange
[2:04:31] yellow violet seven colors seven rainbow
[2:04:35] rainbow around the throne of God through
[2:04:37] them seven virtues Through them seven
[2:04:39] lights, God reflecting himself and the
[2:04:42] reflection will be the perfection. The
[2:04:45] reflection going to be the token itself
[2:04:46] upon your life. When I see that
[2:04:48] reflection, when I see the person of
[2:04:50] Christ, when I see the token upon your
[2:04:52] life, I'm going to pass over all those
[2:04:55] virtues has to be in the bride. Oh,
[2:04:57] glory to God. It going to be inside of
[2:04:59] you. You are son of God. You will come
[2:05:01] to perfection. That's the purpose God
[2:05:03] put you on the earth to bring you to
[2:05:05] perfection. The church ages are over. We
[2:05:08] are in the bride age. We in the horn
[2:05:10] age. We in the caller age. We're in the
[2:05:13] elected age. We're in the age where that
[2:05:15] Joseph rainbow coat will drop over you.
[2:05:21] Glory.
[2:05:22] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. My
[2:05:26] the voice of the seven church ages
[2:05:28] nowadays they don't want to say hell in
[2:05:30] the pulpit. We need men of God, men who
[2:05:32] won't back. Now here we go. Now
[2:05:34] everybody can be a preacher. That's
[2:05:36] right. But you got a voice. And if you
[2:05:38] can't preach the people a sermon, if
[2:05:40] you're a preacher, you're called to the
[2:05:42] pulpit to preach. If not, you're still a
[2:05:45] preacher. Amen. But live the people a
[2:05:48] sermon. Let your sermon be lived. Here
[2:05:50] we go. And it's the voice of God that
[2:05:53] will bring reproach to them who reject
[2:05:56] it. They will say, that's the testimony.
[2:06:00] Now, you want to hear the testimony what
[2:06:01] they will say? They will say no one can
[2:06:04] put a finger on his or her life. They're
[2:06:06] sweet living. If there ever was a man of
[2:06:08] God is that man, that woman. See, live
[2:06:10] your sermons. Don't try to preach them.
[2:06:12] If you're not called to be a preacher,
[2:06:14] you'll get mixed up and messed up.
[2:06:16] You'll get people tangled up. You won't
[2:06:17] know. They'll ruin them and yourself
[2:06:19] also. Just live your sermon. The
[2:06:21] preacher is called to preach his and
[2:06:23] live it too. If they can live it, then
[2:06:25] stop preaching it. But you're supposed
[2:06:26] to live your sermons. All right. Hear
[2:06:29] was voices. Oh, then the prophet break
[2:06:31] out. Now, how we need in Jessville,
[2:06:34] thousands of lived voices.
[2:06:38] The thunder of God thundering out in
[2:06:41] sweetness, holiness, purity, undefiled
[2:06:45] lives, walking around the earth today
[2:06:47] without a blemish. Yes, sir. Real
[2:06:48] Christians, that's the thunder against
[2:06:50] the enemy. The devil don't care how much
[2:06:52] you la. The devil don't care how much
[2:06:53] you jump up and down, how much you
[2:06:55] shout. But what hurts the devil is to
[2:06:57] see a sanctified, holy life. consecrated
[2:07:00] to God. Say anything to him. Call him
[2:07:02] anything. Just as sweet as he can be.
[2:07:05] That chose him right off. Oh,
[2:07:07] hallelujah. The disciples were casting
[2:07:10] out devils or trying to cast out an
[2:07:11] epileptic spirit and they couldn't do
[2:07:13] it. And brother Ram dramatized how the
[2:07:15] devil's telling them not one of you
[2:07:16] could do it. Here come Jesus. Brother,
[2:07:18] when they see him coming down walking
[2:07:20] quietly, he didn't have nothing to say,
[2:07:23] have to say nothing. The devil was
[2:07:25] already scared right then. Amen. Jesus
[2:07:28] Jesus didn't know how to talk. But the
[2:07:30] devil see faith coming, virtue coming,
[2:07:32] knowledge coming, temperance coming,
[2:07:33] patience, godliness, brotherly kindness.
[2:07:36] The devil know time to go.
[2:07:39] [Music]
[2:07:42] He's just waiting for the word now.
[2:07:49] Oh, glory to God. Watch. The devil was
[2:07:52] scared right then. He know he had to
[2:07:54] leave cuz here come a life not only a
[2:07:58] sermon but a life. He said come out of
[2:08:00] him and that done it.
[2:08:04] The disciples didn't have the life yet.
[2:08:07] [Applause]
[2:08:12] Watch Noah rainbow composed primary of
[2:08:16] seven colors red orange and so on. Now
[2:08:20] if you notice seven rainbows mean seven
[2:08:23] color rainbow that meant seven bows.
[2:08:26] Seven bows. Seven churches reflecting
[2:08:28] seven lights. Each light wrapped into
[2:08:30] the other one. It start off with red.
[2:08:32] Red come orange. Orange a reflection of
[2:08:34] red. Then after orange yellow which is
[2:08:36] red and orange mixed together makes
[2:08:38] yellow. Then green. Green and blue makes
[2:08:40] black. Then come indigo. From indigo is
[2:08:42] violet and part of blue. Don't you see
[2:08:44] it? God in his seven color rainbow. His
[2:08:48] covenant he made through the seven ages.
[2:08:51] He would save the earth. Remember he
[2:08:53] made it with the earth. His color. Now
[2:08:56] watch this rainbow horizontally covers
[2:08:58] above half the earth. But watch around
[2:09:01] the throne. It's around the whole
[2:09:02] throne. The half has not yet been told.
[2:09:06] And when John saw him there is amber
[2:09:08] color. He surrounded and covered like
[2:09:09] like a halo. One color, one gold over
[2:09:12] all. But in there is seven church ages.
[2:09:14] And then he went on to talk about the
[2:09:15] diamond. Or the diamond had to be cut.
[2:09:17] And when they cut it, it reflect the
[2:09:19] fiery colors of his carrot. It reflects
[2:09:21] seven colors also. So Christ was that
[2:09:23] diamond. And when they cut the diamond,
[2:09:25] seven colors come out of that. One
[2:09:27] diamond, seven colors. Isn't that right?
[2:09:29] Oh, praise God. Hallelujah. He was
[2:09:31] wounded for our transgression. He was
[2:09:33] bruised for our iniquity. The
[2:09:34] chastisement of our peace was upon him.
[2:09:36] And by his stripes, we were healed. What
[2:09:38] did God do that perfect man? There was
[2:09:39] only one of them in the world. only one
[2:09:41] in the world. And God chiseled him off.
[2:09:46] That one perfect man. He let the rainbow
[2:09:49] light, here we go, of the seven church
[2:09:51] ages flash upon me to know he was
[2:09:54] wounded for my transgression. There's
[2:09:56] your seven color rainbow. He was bruised
[2:09:58] for your iniquity. Isn't that right? and
[2:10:00] through his dying wounds, forgiveness of
[2:10:02] sins, joy, peace, longsuffering,
[2:10:05] goodness, meekness, the seven spirits of
[2:10:08] God are the seven fruits of the spirit
[2:10:11] that would reflect back on the people.
[2:10:15] So, we're not talking fairy tales.
[2:10:18] Oh, glory to God. It has to reflect.
[2:10:26] The seven spirits of God are the seven
[2:10:28] fruits of the spirit that would reflect
[2:10:30] back in his people. He was bruised and
[2:10:32] shaped. Praise God. If I be lifted up
[2:10:35] from the earth, seven spirits, seven
[2:10:37] colors, seven church ages, seven
[2:10:39] ministers, seven lights, everything is
[2:10:41] seven. Seven voices, seven thunders, a
[2:10:45] seven thunder bride. We are we going to
[2:10:47] have a revival. Oh, glory to God. The
[2:10:50] rain will going to sweep across the sky.
[2:10:52] Go on say the Holy Ghost will go across
[2:10:54] the world overnight. Not no man going
[2:10:56] across the world overnight. The Holy
[2:10:58] Ghost will go across the world
[2:11:00] overnight.
[2:11:03] Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God.
[2:11:06] Hallelujah. So Jesus, he came to reflect
[2:11:09] the father and the father was the word.
[2:11:11] Now I feel religious right now. He came
[2:11:13] to reflect the father's word and he was
[2:11:15] the perfect masterpiece. He was the
[2:11:17] perfect masterpiece of God. Hallelujah.
[2:11:21] Praise God. Amen. Are you going to take
[2:11:24] some more? I'm right in the honey jar
[2:11:26] now. I can't stop. I'm inside of it
[2:11:28] right now. I'm all sticky with it now.
[2:11:31] Listen to this. All those seven spirits
[2:11:35] as we get in Revelations, they come out
[2:11:38] was made up God was perfection.
[2:11:42] All those seven spirits that come out
[2:11:46] made up God was perfection.
[2:11:50] Everything else outside of that is
[2:11:53] something that been perverted from that.
[2:11:55] And the only way we could come back to
[2:11:57] perfection is to get back to that
[2:12:00] perfection. Which is the seven spirits.
[2:12:04] Hallelujah.
[2:12:05] So dynamics,
[2:12:08] Elohim,
[2:12:10] seven spirits before the beginning.
[2:12:13] That's the dynamics that we are looking
[2:12:15] for to strike the bride.
[2:12:20] Do you see it? You shall receive power
[2:12:23] after red, orange, yellow, green, blue,
[2:12:29] amigo, violet, that rainbow, that seven
[2:12:33] spirit, that dynamite, that Holy Ghost,
[2:12:37] that token, that promise of the
[2:12:42] father that has to come upon you.
[2:12:48] [Applause]
[2:12:50] The only way we can come back to
[2:12:53] perfection is to come back to that
[2:12:55] perfection which is God. Then we come to
[2:12:59] perfection. Then we have eternal life
[2:13:01] without end. It's just eternal life. Oh,
[2:13:04] blessed be the name of the Lord. Praise
[2:13:07] the name of the Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:13:10] Brother Abraham said this last great
[2:13:12] step after Luther Wesley Pentecost must
[2:13:16] come into the
[2:13:17] perfection that the Holy Spirit has to
[2:13:20] live in that church so perfectly. It
[2:13:23] will make the head and body unite
[2:13:25] together. That's the body and and he is
[2:13:27] the head of the body. He promised that
[2:13:29] that great step. Almost done. Oh my.
[2:13:33] Amen. Amen. This whole big rainbow had
[2:13:35] become a theophony. Okay. through the
[2:13:37] seven perfect colors which is the seven
[2:13:39] spirits of God. They went from the great
[2:13:42] fountain or that great diamond that
[2:13:44] Jesus spoke of. That great diamond was
[2:13:46] chipped to reflect these colors. That
[2:13:48] whole big rainbow had become a theophony
[2:13:51] or made in the image like a man. Yet he
[2:13:53] wasn't a man. He didn't have flesh yet.
[2:13:55] He was a theophony. Oh my. I'm going to
[2:13:58] close to my musician. Come on, please.
[2:14:01] What am I talking about from adoption?
[2:14:03] Hey, Brandon Tabernacle, you had your
[2:14:05] chance. Here we go. When a man once is
[2:14:09] anointed with the Holy Ghost, Amen. Are
[2:14:13] you ready?
[2:14:14] To be adopted,
[2:14:17] into the family of God.
[2:14:20] So before adoption, a man have to be
[2:14:23] anointed
[2:14:25] with the Holy Ghost. Amen. To be
[2:14:27] adopted.
[2:14:30] Glory. Amen. To be positionally placed
[2:14:33] by the father and set into service out
[2:14:35] there into his purpose of life, what God
[2:14:38] called him to do, his walk must be holy,
[2:14:41] holy unto the Lord. Amen.
[2:14:45] Amen. Final quote I have here from I was
[2:14:47] with Moses last evening, last Tuesday
[2:14:50] morning about 3:00, something else
[2:14:53] happened. I was at home. Standing before
[2:14:56] me in a room was a divine one that spoke
[2:14:59] words that I did not understand. At the
[2:15:02] time that he appointed his at hand. I
[2:15:04] did not hear him too good but he was a
[2:15:06] divine one. He said seven more days you
[2:15:08] stand as Moses stood or will be as Moses
[2:15:10] was. Something that concerning Moses.
[2:15:12] That leads me to wonder you'll have to
[2:15:15] stand. I told my family I told them I
[2:15:17] told my loved ones that I saw this
[2:15:19] divine one yet he spoke as a man. I'll
[2:15:22] close with these words. Hallelujah.
[2:15:26] It is becoming clearer and clearer to
[2:15:29] me. All the
[2:15:31] mysteries, all the great revelations and
[2:15:33] knowledge and understanding is to bring
[2:15:36] us into a pathway of life. Amen. That we
[2:15:39] can partake of the life of God and the
[2:15:42] nature of God to express God and then go
[2:15:45] back to Eden. Amen. But more than
[2:15:49] that,
[2:15:51] adoption is to bring you into the
[2:15:53] presence of a divine one. Hallelujah.
[2:15:58] And Nazara got judged in church for
[2:16:00] lying to Peter. Peter was a man. Amen.
[2:16:04] That they could see. Hallelujah. Listen,
[2:16:08] Safh knew better. She knew the kind of
[2:16:10] man she was living with. He died. She
[2:16:13] didn't have to die. She didn't have to
[2:16:15] stand with her husband. She shall stand
[2:16:17] with the word. She lie also and she died
[2:16:21] and that was a man that had God veil on
[2:16:24] his throne. Amen. What about coming into
[2:16:27] divine one where brother Brandham said
[2:16:30] he never got accustomed to the presence
[2:16:32] of the angel. Where John said he fell as
[2:16:35] one dead and John lived with Jesus when
[2:16:37] Jesus was in the earth. But when John
[2:16:40] got in the book of revelation and Christ
[2:16:42] come in that glorified condition, he
[2:16:44] fell as one dead. Amen. All the prophets
[2:16:47] they experience like Isaiah fell as one
[2:16:50] dead. Isaiah in the presence of God. But
[2:16:53] wo is me I'm undone. When the vision
[2:16:56] spoke about brother Brandham with with
[2:16:57] with with with um so this is the time he
[2:17:01] said he was numb for days.
[2:17:04] He couldn't feel his hands numb for
[2:17:06] days. And that was off the vision.
[2:17:11] That wasn't even the angel yet. Hear
[2:17:13] what he said. adoption. God will visit
[2:17:16] you with an angel.
[2:17:22] Is your life ready for a visitation?
[2:17:25] Play something softly. Is your life
[2:17:28] ready for God to visit you with
[2:17:32] supernatural divine presence? And this
[2:17:34] is where I could see a man anointed. His
[2:17:38] walk must be holy, holy unto God. Amen.
[2:17:40] Or this takes us beyond church. No, this
[2:17:42] is not trying to please some sister or
[2:17:44] some brother or some elder or some
[2:17:46] deacon or some pastor. This is not that.
[2:17:49] This is you conscious that someday you
[2:17:52] have an appointment with the
[2:17:53] supernatural.
[2:17:55] And if you see the plainness of God,
[2:17:58] then it's you to make yourself ready.
[2:18:00] You to prepare your spirit and your soul
[2:18:03] and your mind and your heart atmosphere.
[2:18:07] Look, look at Abraham. Elohim, Michael,
[2:18:09] Gabriel, drop down. Three men
[2:18:11] walking. Abraham said, "My
[2:18:14] Lord." God came to Abraham and said,
[2:18:16] "Listen, I'm about to judge
[2:18:17] Sodom." And Abraham, because of what was
[2:18:20] in him, begin to plead to God. God, if
[2:18:23] there's 50, he said, "No, 40, no, 35,
[2:18:27] no, he couldn't find
[2:18:30] 10." Abraham pleases with God. He didn't
[2:18:32] say, "I am right. All them is wrong.
[2:18:34] Take me,
[2:18:36] Lord, but everybody else except me." No,
[2:18:39] it was Christ living out in these
[2:18:42] brothers. Christ in Joseph, Christ in
[2:18:45] Jacob, Christ in Noah, Christ in Joshua,
[2:18:48] Christ in Moses. God was living out
[2:18:51] mysteries all along. The people not even
[2:18:53] knowing it. A seed in them. David,
[2:18:56] Christ and David. Yes, he fell. He fell
[2:18:59] in sin. All was Christ and David. Christ
[2:19:01] and Solomon. All of them sons of God.
[2:19:05] Hallelujah. Norah end up drunk. This one
[2:19:08] end up not crossing over to the land.
[2:19:09] This happened to this one that ends up
[2:19:11] nothing from their sunship, their
[2:19:14] godship, their inheritance. They
[2:19:16] stumbled, they fell, they rose up. But
[2:19:19] it's all reflecting Jesus Christ.
[2:19:22] Hallelujah.
[2:19:23] [Music]
[2:19:25] I am conscious.
[2:19:27] To go to the next level is to prepare
[2:19:30] for the visiting of angels. Not little
[2:19:33] doves, not bigger doves, but angels.
[2:19:37] Angelic beings dropping down upon the
[2:19:39] people. Oh, another book of Acts, angels
[2:19:43] came to open the prison bars. Another
[2:19:45] book of Acts, angels filing the people,
[2:19:48] setting them free, bringing messengers,
[2:19:50] angels, angelic beings, supernatural
[2:19:54] beings coming among God's people. Are we
[2:19:57] ready for that? Are you expecting that?
[2:20:00] Paul said, "The angel of the Lord of
[2:20:02] whose servants I
[2:20:04] am. Amen.
[2:20:09] Oh glory.
[2:20:11] Oh Jesus.
[2:20:14] Steal the
[2:20:17] way. Let's all stand.
[2:20:21] Steal
[2:20:25] him.
[2:20:28] Still
[2:20:30] to Jesus.
[2:20:36] Why don't you steal
[2:20:41] away steal
[2:20:49] away? I don't have
[2:20:54] long to
[2:20:57] stay
[2:20:59] here. Nothing wrong with me somebody in
[2:21:01] Jesus name. But tonight, why don't you
[2:21:05] steal with
[2:21:10] me? Steal
[2:21:13] away. Oh
[2:21:16] Lord, steal your
[2:21:19] way to
[2:21:23] Jesus. My Lord, my Lord, my
[2:21:26] Lord,
[2:21:28] still with me.
[2:21:31] [Music]
[2:21:33] Still
[2:21:39] wait. I don't have
[2:21:44] long to
[2:21:47] [Music]
[2:21:48] stay. Why you worship him right now as
[2:21:50] the music play? Just worship him right
[2:21:53] now. My Lord call
[2:21:56] me. Call me by the thunder.
[2:22:00] The trumpet
[2:22:02] sounds when my
[2:22:07] soul.
[2:22:09] Hallelujah. I don't have
[2:22:12] long. We don't have long, saints. We
[2:22:16] don't have
[2:22:18] long to

[2:33:21] who was prayed for last Sunday. The
[2:33:23] doctors are very pleased with the
[2:33:24] surgery and her recovery which has been
[2:33:27] extremely good and rapid. She thanks the
[2:33:29] saints for their prayers and asks if we
[2:33:31] continue to bear her up in prayer until
[2:33:33] she's totally healed of the attack of
[2:33:35] cancer. And the church say amen.
[2:33:40] God is still a healer. He is still a
[2:33:42] restorer. He is still a way maker. He's
[2:33:46] still baptized with the Holy Ghost. He
[2:33:48] can still save you from your sin. He
[2:33:50] could still heal you from your past. He
[2:33:52] could turn your life around. He could
[2:33:55] bring back the pieces. He is a good God
[2:33:57] this morning. There's no God like him
[2:34:00] this morning. Can the church say
[2:34:03] amen? Can we bow our heads for a word of
[2:34:06] prayer? Oh heavenly father, we thank you
[2:34:08] this morning, Lord, that we could be in
[2:34:11] the house of God. There are so many
[2:34:12] places that, Father, we could have been,
[2:34:14] but it's only your grace that allowed us
[2:34:17] to be here today, Lord. You saw it fit
[2:34:20] to knock on the doors of our hearts,
[2:34:23] Father. Lord, the Bible says, "Behold, I
[2:34:26] stand at the door and knock." And Father
[2:34:28] God, we are open, Lord, this morning to
[2:34:31] receive from you. We thank you for the
[2:34:32] words that were spoken. And Lord, we
[2:34:35] take them into the sockets of our soul.
[2:34:37] Father, may they find good ground, a
[2:34:39] good resting place, Lord. And as we go
[2:34:42] through this week, Father, may Lord, we
[2:34:44] be in your spirit of the coming of the
[2:34:47] Lord, recognizing that each day brings
[2:34:50] us closer, Father, we pray a special
[2:34:52] blessing, Lord, on the service this
[2:34:54] coming Thursday. May the Holy Ghost pour
[2:34:57] out, Father, as we pray, as we prepare
[2:34:59] for Super Sunday this coming Sunday. May
[2:35:01] you be with your people, Father. Father,
[2:35:03] May you touch our pastor, Lord, today,
[2:35:05] Lord. And Lord, may you touch him in his
[2:35:07] body, Father. Lord, from the crown of
[2:35:10] his head to the soles of his feet,
[2:35:12] Father, may you touch and bless your
[2:35:14] people, Lord. May your Holy Ghost go
[2:35:16] with us, Lord, as we leave this house,
[2:35:17] but not from your presence. Grant
[2:35:20] traveling mercies in the precious name
[2:35:22] of Jesus Christ. And the church says,
[2:35:25] "Amen." and you may be seated for a few
[2:35:29] minutes just for a few announcements uh
