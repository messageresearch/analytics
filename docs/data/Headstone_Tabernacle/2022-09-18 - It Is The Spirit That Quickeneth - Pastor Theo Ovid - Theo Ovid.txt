morning be so blessed to be here if you have your bibles i'd like you to turn this in john chapter five we want to read one verse was 21 there in john chapter 6 we want to read one verse 63 and ephesians 2 i want to read verse 1 and 2. scripture reading this morning thank you so much certainly i appreciate those specials this morning blessed be the name of the lord sin john 5 21 for as the father raised the dead and quickened them even so the sun quickness whom he will and in john 6 63 jesus speaks it is the spirit that quickness the flesh profited nothing the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life final scripture reading from ephesians 2 verse 1 and 2. and you had he quickened who were dead in sin and dead in trespasses and sins wherein in time past he walk according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the ear the spirit that now work it in the children of disobedience may god bless his word you may be seated this morning i have a title it is a spirit that quickness i have a subject the quickness power let's go the word is dead until it is quickened by the spirit the word is dead until it's quickened by the spirit so watch now god always stands behind his word isn't that right so watch on on once it has to be revealed it's revealed to prophets we realize that all the mysteries of god is mean known to prophets and them alone let me repeat it again all the mysteries of god is made known to prophets and them alone sub fifo ministry and ministers and pastors have to draw from what god speak out of the mouth of prophets amos 3 7 says surely lord god will do nothing but reveal the secrets until servants the prophets now the power of revelation brings stimulation to the believer for the power of wine or natural wine is to stimulate so wine symbolizes revelation it have water has to turn into wine and wine brings stimulation and that is what revelation does a person that is slumped on watch when the power of revelation of the word gives stimulation of joy to the believer so when you see a dong and you're low and you're struggling you need a revelation when god speaks to you reveal himself to you and it brings joy to you as a believer that is something god has reserved for you divine revelation which comes as wine that brings stimulation and it brings joy to the believers so i don't care what condition you in and god break a revelation upon you all of a sudden you get excited you get stimulated please go this morning i'm not tired i just need a quick name and once that quick thing come all the tiredness go because the quickness power has now come upon you oh praise god you could be drunk and weary and drag yourself inside of here but once an anointing praise god that makes the difference what's that anointing praise god you can't live without it once that come upon you every day all the blues gone all the wearing is gone all the troubles go on because you're under the anointing the devil can't take that from you now that is belong to the sons and daughters of god oh glory to god jesus and the spirit is upon me for he hath anointed me jesus himself had to be anointed he was the son of god he was the word made flesh but the anointing had to come upon him and the anointing have come upon you just as they come upon christ it has to come upon you not by might no by power his spirit oh glory to god i want to tell you this morning is the spirit of quickness the flesh prophet that nothing all glory so forget your flesh oh great the spirit quicken you this morning quicken you and make you alive quicken you do his promised word oh glory to god amen you will be seated praise god hallelujah so this simulation joy to the believer stimulation of satisfaction stimulation of it's vindicated it is proved it's called in the scripture new wine we all refer to they are drunk they're drunk now guys when they start in the upper room they were staggering like that and the people watching them say but they drunk a new wine way too early this morning to be drunk how come they're sagging like that they were staggering under the power of revelation of the holy ghost filling them they were drunk like young men praise god you cannot praise god they halfway in heaven already praise god in the ordinary day in the spirit when you're in the spirit is different oh glory to god hallelujah better get warm up inside of here praise god you're gonna get stuck inside of here raising your hands saying amen hallelujah that's why the devil fight worship fight amens fight hallelujah fight the glory praise god be fighting you fight back fight right back god is worthy to be praised whether you have problems or you don't have problems god is worthy prayers whether you can't pay a bill god is willing in prayers whether the mortgage company come in and seize your house tomorrow god is still worthy to be praised give the lord a shout job said the lord give the lord take it away blessed be the name of the lord [Applause] glory to god amen this church we want worshipers inside of here the father seeking such to worship him they could worship in spirit and the truth they couldn't do that in no other age because no other age had the truth god sends seven ears of eternity to god all this scattered word to bring back truth in this day we supposed to know how to worship we supposed to know what we worshipping we want to know who we worship in or if anybody can worship must be this brighter jesus christ if you can't worship something wrong with you glory when the lamb took the book when the lamb opened the book when the lamb called your name you can't worship praise god praise god you better worship lord reader god john said all in heaven all under the earth heard i praise god i could never stop talking about worship this may look petty it may look small but this shakes hell's kingdom because you're praising god before it happened you're praising god before the wars come down around your mountain or give the lord a shout i will praise him anyhow in the good times praise his name and the bad times do the same glory we're not saying not to kill time because we have no message to preach you know we're saying this because it's important we're not trying to kill time behind you you know we claim time a bowling praise god praise god praise god praise god how could you get revelation if you're not in the spirit this is not information we talk about you know it's not no joy with information you know information stimulates a great matter in your brains in your head but revelation forget it when mary when the angel appeared to mary and say hail mary that would highly feel good lord of thee mary do you know all of that you know there we go never going to book a business and you'll come and say hail mary oh highly favored the lord is with thee blessed are those wonderful men and so forth mary only had one question not six not

hear that oh you talked about simulation she ran to her cousin elizabeth she ran she gets here how to move boy i had to tell somebody this thing this thing just revealed to me that i am that version isaiah was talking about i am the version that the prophecy was all about that's what the bible taught my name is right there a virgin shall conceive they was talking about me mary was stimulated with the revelation of who she was and the call upon her life and mary would run to elizabeth and say elizabeth i'm going to have a baby she'll feel nothing she has sensed nothing she had known but no physical and evidence whatsoever just because of revelation stimulation you have a testimony and i trust when this service is over you will have a testimony you're going to have revelation you're going to have stimulation oh glory to god going to anointing [Music] oh the flesh prophet did nothing oh give the lord a shout praise god you can't compare your bank account with this you can't

sideline christians and they can be second-class citizens and everybody else all these sodomites everybody getting promoted and recognized in the world today but don't worry god promised to unveil a bride right in satan's eden you see how satan mentioned god eden and cause mischief and havoc and chaos god wait for satan eden to unveil this bride he don't believe who you are just as he asked jesus if though be the son of god turn his stone to bread he had no discernment he had no revelation or inspiration as to who the son of god was and he has no resentment of who you are he think you are the cinnamon it was 20 years ago he think you are the baxter man he was but you are not that god saw your name in the book and because he saw your name he went to send a word after you to bring you out i don't care what you have been in god will still bring you up the devil is a liar i am telling you to your face the devil is a liar every time you open his mouth he's lying you're going to be delivered praise god that you're going to be broken you're going to break the bands out wickedness of your life you're going to get you'll get the house of hell the house of hell has to give way to the name of

the same god that caused the red sea to open up that same god that let the walls of jericho fall down that same god he's going to fight for you oh he's going to work for you or give him some praises the flesh prophet did nothing forget your stinking rotten flesh oh glory to god take the words that is coming to you jesus said the word that i speak their spirit and their life oh glory to god not confucius not plato not socrates not them philosophers not them newspaper not all mtv shows no no no that's not life they are talk they have information but not life only the word have life he said i come that you may have life and have it more abundantly money can only bring comfort but it can't bring joy oh glory to god money cannot bring life what you're fighting for you're fighting to live what you're living for you're living to die glory to god find yourself this morning oh glory to god come come that you might have life oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah i'll tell you something if you have to die tomorrow give the devil a run for his money today or give the lord a shout don't go out complaining and grumpy give the devil a run for his money oh glory to god [Applause] when you're gone the devil must say i'm glad he gone give me enough held on here glad he gone hallelujah and god glad you're gone too because another saint has made it home oh god we roam for 70 80 years on the earth and we make it home praise god we're not in space you know they're going home you know and they're coming back we're waiting for our practicum to perfection we have a purpose on the earth god doesn't work for haphazard he works with purpose and don't ever forget this thing time was given to fulfill purpose okay the lord our praise offering don't waste your time time was given to fulfill purpose there's a purpose for your life i don't want your shakers you know no say amen hallelujah say glory say hallelujah you're just not gone and the four beasts not and they're 24 hours they were nothing too no nothing say amen am i mean sober yet let the devil know whose side you're on glory that god never deafened them i think he was a deaf and dear man going to church every day listen to the sign language where you're going for he said i want the devil to know whose side i am on he can't hear nothing praise god he can't speak nothing but he he want the devil to know whose side you're on oh glory to god i want to give him my best shot oh glory to god if this is your last year make the best of it your last month with the best of this if you have to live for 24 hours give hell hell hell oh glory give the lord i shout praise god let's continue now i'll skip this here watch remember when the sixth chapter is what we read you see it is a spirit of quickness the flesh profited nothing the words that i speak unto you their spirits and their life the word itself is spirit it is spirit in word form that's why the word could turn the spirit that's why the foolish version cannot get the oil because they didn't have the word to turn into spirit oh give the lord a shout hallelujah praise god you have to have the word in you what's the secret the word is in the bride how did the word get in the bride we pumping it every sunday every wednesday every tape you hear every permission read every time you say amen every time you claim it that word coming into you [Music] [Applause] [Music] a thought has to be a thought before it can be a word or when a thought is presented or the word is an expression of a thought this is god's thought that he has placed in the word and when we receive it from him it becomes a word so revelation is god taught drop to you and bypass your mind drop into your heart because isaiah had caught god's thoughts and it's flick up in his mind avoiding shall conceive he was in the pause and say but that can happen you see how god in a bypass reasoning you say oh simeon an old man who's supposed to be in rock and chair the gift to give him for his retirement and you're not staying home he's still going to church because god revealed to him that he could see the lord christ i know christ coming inside this house christ is coming to be offered up in the temple so he's making sure he is dear because you have to witness this thing because god revealed him it's a revelation the old man dragging himself every sunday morning because god revealed to him he shall not see that that coming you know but he shall not sit until until uncertain they have to be full until there is a lie god has finished with you yet god has finished with me yet that angel has to take his time and take a stroll and go for our next wrongs or give the lord some praises until your time is finished until your purpose and finish note that angel are coming for you oh are you shouting on that one oh you're getting frightened you're coming you know oh glory to god the prophet said not even that go stop this pride you talk about the power going to be in this church not even death will stop this bride never in the history of the world have there been a people like this people this last day church no wonder he's a super race no wonder he's a super church glory hallelujah let me maybe seated praise god praise god but see how you get this this morning don't ask me that i what i get i just give i don't have no question i'm not even trying to figure it out myself i want to know how i could get this here this is a spirit of correctness it's turned into my soul preach that pray is the spirit of preaching it i get preached spirit spirits have to breathe spirit it's the spirit that quickness i care quickly so we run after a man for this man can quickly run him back to this man rather we find out this stimulates give joy because it's god's word and a new wine stimulates when it reveals the word it brings joy beyond measure sometimes we went through that it brings us joy till you're over flooded you receive people don't know what they what what they talk they don't know what to say is joy hallelujah i know there's a lot of fanaticism people carrying on i know sometimes they they do that when the music is jumping up and down everything else i've seen people in a day as long as the music is playing everybody's jumping screaming when will they stop it stop that's all right you said no watch i'm concerned about the people's lives right but now what you once you start bringing the word now the thing that is actually brings life is the word not philosophy not from time magazine not from ukraine and putin and the pope and rome that is not they're not they're not bringing life well i talked to our friend and the friend was telling me that i've seen it i've seen something so i'll go by your friend and see it so more friends the devil have to show his show and so on so and so and then how do you process it so i'm a friend i met so you know you will you you'll get plenty of resources but if you want life only the word giving you that come to the word now watch jesus told them luke 24 49 behold i send the promise of my father upon you and you go to jerusalem and wait until what was the promise of the father jewel 2 28 i'll pour out the spirit isaiah 20 19 there'll be stamina rips and other tongues they went up there as we went through this well i believe i've waited long enough let's just accept it by faith that was a good baptist doctrine but it didn't work with them brothers the first thing you know it has become it had to become a reality because people find they're waiting too long for this promise god i waited to go for the holy ghost i wasn't alone for this i waited too long for that but what it had to become a reality and they waited on their ministry here we go for the word to be vindicated and when you come to seek the holy spirit you do the same you have to wait you have to wait until god do something for you you can lock god neck god promise it god can't lie you could tell god you promised me the holy ghost and i want it oh hallelujah praise god you want what you promised oh glory to god amen all right now watch he said no what he said yes you can accept by faith you have to accept christ by faith that's exactly right but you accept the holy spirit by faith but then the holy spirit come and give the circumcision as a witness that you accepted your faith so the same thing we must do we must wait on the holy spirit till it's done something not necessary because we spoke in tongues not because we danced or we got emotional or we shouted until we are changed that's a key component that changed until something actually happened i don't care what form it comes in just so it happened that's the main thing okay let's continue now watch the written word brings forth of its kind you know you receive it in your heart and believe it you must read a word and be such a scholar till you know all the ins and outs of the word that will never do you no good until it first becomes quickened to you so like if you're praying or you're washing your wares or you're doing something you're sweeping the floor and something in your heart say go and pray now that's it that's the time to go and pray it's better you pray under the inspiration guided to pray for five minutes that you go and they say praying i pray oh are you laboring and you you're going through you're going through because sometimes god would whisper pray now sometimes somebody have a need somebody in trouble and god bring somebody to your heart and mind and pray for them and you begin to pray afterwards you hear this was happening and that was happening but there's a law deed upon your heart to pray for that individual you can't be praying for yourself all the time you know you have to pray for saints you have to pray for souls you have to pray for lies people in hell people people in church and in hell people in church are not happy they are christians who are not happy that's a sad thing that's a sad thing praise god i have no joy that's accepting praise god i say if i die i don't want the happiest man praise god i'm blessed i feel privileged i feel honor i feel i live a full life praise god that's how i feel i don't know how you feel i feel good about god i feel good about his grace about feeling good about his call i feel good at how he helped me all through these years he don't have to do one more thing for me to trust him or believe him i don't ever see a miracle i don't have to see a sign i love him still oh glory to god if you don't answer my prayer still love him i will still serve him or give the lord some praises glory to god yeah you ever see me coming with a long face praise god hallelujah pray maybe i smile too much oh glory to god but christians got not happy because they have they connect their life with external things and when those external things are not there or fulfilled then you know the happiness is not there but when you get happiness on the inside where whether you live under a tent or under a big size umbrella you still have the joy okay what i said when they live under a tent or oversized umbrella you still have the joy of the lord which is the strength you can still praise him anyhow oh glory to god we have to come free you know we can't leave here going to the raptured all these lords and us you know heavy and loaded on with care load it down with pressure you can't leave here i saw you know you had to walk like enoch the other one can get lighter and lighter and lighter praise god i'll never forget well knights you look use a love gadget love

loaded me up i i didn't get inside of it but it's amazing he was going and he lost the desire he thinks we can overcome and think we think and he thinks no he going and that means nothing because he on his way out praise the flesh prophetess nothing oh my so watch it will do you no good until it first become quickened to you and if you only know one word and it's quickened that's all you need did you get that you don't need all your words you know just one word and god quickened that oh hallelujah though mighty warrior mighty man of valor praise god that was quickened to gideon and when that was quick in the giveaway and that's all you need to beat gundam philistines and a word quickened to him and he had enough every time he crops about a reap every time you have his control then

and we have to put some licks praise god begin to fight like never before use what you have use what you've got this morning you have praise in your mouth use it you have a hand to raise up use it you have feet to stand up use it oh glory to god you ever had to praise him use it oh glory to god your shout in advance your praise god in advance before jericho walls fall down he said when i beat you

fall down or give the lord some praises before god break you out oh glory i could give another scripture when paul was in prison praise god at midnight at midnight he began to praise and worship god at midnight he expected to be overdriving sleeping but paul reject that and the right hour he began to praise and worship god and then the prison bars begin to open up oh glory god what is it the quickness power and then god ready for you your glory to god i'm gonna see your worship you're gonna break out oh glory to god and the quickening power going to unlock every thought that is binding you hallelujah my god my god let's continue today with great intellectual messages we can explain it till we can see the picture but that isn't what we are looking for tonight we are not looking for the mechanics we are not looking to have him explained we are looking for the dynamics of it do you understand what this church is looking for i'm not talking about no other church no other group what this church is looking for is the dynamics of it that's it we have got the mechanics of religions the bible so bottle eyes take like a great 16 35 coach train sitting on a track but if you haven't got the steam in it it takes a dynamic to perform with the mechanics what we need now is to see that what we have been taught listen to this and this is what i've been fighting for all these years and brother branham frame it in the words that only he could bring it out he said watch what we have been taught all these years is it the truth or is it not it's been explained over and over and over through the different seminaries and churches and so forth until we are looking to see who this person is until that church becomes both dynamics and mechanics and the spirit of god and move him do the things that he did if he hit on 16 cylinders so will the bride for he said in single 1412 he that believeth on me the works that i do shall we do also i'll give him a charge of my dynamics in his mechanics that the world will not be able to withstand it i'll raise him up in the last day praise god the dynamics and mechanics together the mechanics with our dynamics no good so all the mysteries and word word word with no dynamics no good the dynamics without mechanics no good because like you are a bacterial sparking so packs packs all these pasta where's the car you can't drive you have power you have all the battery look at that and you're sure enough the power on the battery but we're going to move over there you need the car the mechanics you need to put the battery inside of there both have to work together do you get it now now we see that enoch come under god's provided way with his word we find that the mechanics were so perfect in him that when his dynamics got to working in the angel it just took him off the earth first airplane flight to heaven praise be to jesus paul ii corinthians 3 do we begin to commend ourselves or need we have some others epistle of commendation to you or letters a combination from you you are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as you are manifestly declared to be the epistle of christ ministered by us in other words you are physical letter the word root on you you are written epistles you are the expression of what i'm preaching and what i'm teaching this is the policy you know written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart and such trust have we through christ to god word not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything of ourselves but our sufficiencies of god who have made us able ministers of the new testament then he qualifies that not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killet but the spirit give it life it is the spirit that quickness it was the same in the old testament paul being well trained knew the scriptures by the word you see the scriptures here we go no matter how well you know them let's slow down right there no matter how well you know them if the spirit doesn't quicken them then the letter kill it people dying because of letter writing church if there's no spirit equipment so you need to understand what you have to connect with you have to connect with the quickening power that quickens the world to you oh glory to god hallelujah praise god

success anointed quicken inspired what the devil like to bring is fear fear it won't happen fear god wouldn't be with you fear god god angry at you if you don't come forward god will be angry at you when he brought the evidence to the people notice i'm strained i'm going back and forth when he brought evidence to the people he thought they were going to rejoice and shout and go forward these men these ministers ministers with jackets and tires [Applause] tell the people that god is right but we can't take it so we could take it by faith we can take it in manifestation we're going to do my feet let me take it down i believe i'm adopted because that preface against again you what kind of fraud you're not thinking is that there's a lot of people falling there's a fraud you're not claiming adoption means full season in the man's body like it was in peter's body in so much that god had sent for cornelius ascend for peter and peter was in the body and life have to come from the body and peter was preaching and why peter yet speak these words suppose called neither was a disrespectful man [Applause] he couldn't receive god's servant this man was a gentile this man don't know nothing about peter he don't know if peter denied christ he don't repeat i was a fisherman all you know god told him sin for one peter peter in himself human will not go so go drop a vision of peter and say it is i don't eat on clean meat i don't eat on clean things but gotcha and shame listen where you going your mind don't want to go your flesh don't want to go but i want you to go because i have an elected seed in acts 10 name cornelius i have amanda why peter come on division wife i finished coke food yet near castle here carry on here make no dino trial dino beer lion or through their ideas and you're upset and i'll show you that set your back that's where your point can document chicken or something or cook it for yourself you know where your wife has been through for that day i don't want to go there hallelujah why peter breaking out the division here comes somebody knocking peter man long they're calling for you peter going down there i could imagine peter never experienced that before this bunch of people convinced of a bunch of people he was just he was devout he was an arms giving man god know they say a memorial was in heaven for the way the man used to give the man wasn't baptized he managed no scripture yet the man just a nice man a sanctified man a man whoever right can have a heart praise god and when peters have to talk and give testimony about jesus only crucify him praise god and everything else why peter yet spit this word holy spirit the quickness the holy ghost the dynamics the power the anointing that breaks the yoke the fetter that fell upon them that heard the word and they were filled with the holy ghost before they were even baptized in water or give the lord some praises that means when your heart right when you're half right when your heart right when your heart right god could do something special for you by his spirit he said not by might know my power but by my spirits hear the lord god want to do something special for you tonight just shake it check your mind to watch your mind trying to interpret what is happening here and i can't even interpret it [Applause] [Music] it's never come to us through word only the word got to be quickened and made alive in the demonstration of the power of the holy ghost ephesians 2 we read that scripture you had to quickened who were dead in sin and trespasses oh glory to god oh glory to god i want you to notice here of the prophet apostle paul how he made mention you as he quickly who were once dead you have he quickened who are once dead in sin and trespasses walking after the kingdom of the world after desire of the flesh fulfilling desire of the mind what caused this change here we go that's right what caused this change for one time being dead to be quicker quicker means to be made alive there was a change from debt to life there is no other so great as to change him from debt to life a man if he will die physically and could be healed physically what would be a great thing and nothing so great as when he is spiritually dead and god has quickened him to life you dead inside you this morning and welcome and quickly you in this service here that's one of the greatest that could happen to you god make you alive by his grace by his spirit [Applause] watch let's continue here god says his wood is a seed a soul it must fall in the right kind of soil the soil is fit it's a seed it must fall into this ground now if somebody backs in here 20 years and they receive this discovery they can be delivered there's no limit with god deliverance i don't care what sin you have been in god could take you completely out of that his hand is not too short to reach down and pick you up in the ditch that you're in but you have to recognize the dish that you're in and let god pick you up and raise you up and deliver you out of it oh don't tell me i can't get to the butcher could get out of it oh glory to god i realize people don't want to change because in love with themselves maybe they like that song the greatest love of all is the love of himself this is my conjunction some dude sing that song the bible said many lies they shall be lovers of their own selves there's no self-confidence something you know love herself job said i hate myself i have all my self i repent on those nashes when you come to this spot when you realize you're nothing goes well you're not in god's plan and program praise god praise god praise god then you want to getting god's plan and program thinking might be good now but what happened down the road quite devil plotting i'm playing you know oh yes everyday trickster he's a deceiver you know just remember that forget him the redhead and he pitched four counting forget that the objective is to deceive and deceive me you're thinking right and you're wrong that when you deceived adam was not deceiving what he was she thought she was right but she was wrong so don't don't don't choose your own thoughts take what the words say and god could take you and hold it like a rope to get out of what you're in are you with me let's run let's run here now if a seed must fall into the ground it cannot be quickened in other words the holy spirit he can't even come to it until it falls in a ranking of soil and he's the quickness of it so once the word that you hear and preach fall into your heart of faith holy spirit right over here because you see in the faith he's seen this sea he sees it in the soil and he's yet to quicken that word to you my god my god when i get my ex supernatural experience with god was 1975 and my god fire coming to my soul and after that there was anointing like i'm not in my heart and it started giving discernment and and and you know it's like you know somebody when somebody cuckoo one it's it's it's different it's a different life it's a different spirit is it from an atmosphere praise god and that helps a long life journey glory to god that's why we are grateful listen that that quick then power we ain't getting it yet is it another no it don't disappear you know even when you're dead it's still there we're gonna get into it you know one time elijah they bury him bone steer and they was trying to put a dead man in that grave and that dead man hit that bone and the equipment power that was still on the bones it doesn't stop you know this thing is thick of eternity you know when they drop that dead man the man bombs back to life because the quickening power was on the light of gold said that same spirit that praised jesus christ from the dead dwelling you that's going to quicken your mortal body oh glory to god give the lord a shout in the house glory to god of that same spirit same spirit hallelujah glory to god let's go jesus identification was to manifest the word of god which he was and the church identification today is to manifest the promised word of this day by the same spirit that manifested and quickened with them the same spirit quickens the world to the believer today and manifests the same thing showing that the token is on this person oh glory to god now i can see the importance of this praise god i ain't got it yet but you're gonna find all this strickland power it's evidence of the rapture praise god resident in your body it's like you get the rapture ticket praise god you have to have it you have got to get it and i hope this make it desperate oh praise god oh look i'm talking that and the next thing we have here the earnest of the resurrection he said lucky woman claiming they got the holy ghost i going out here wearing shorts and things and could you do it how could the spirit of god in you ever do such a thing he's not a filthy spirit he's a holy spirit now listen this is deep when you become subject to that spirit it shows your whole being suffering to that spirit and that spirit is nothing in the world but this seed word made manifest or quicken he said hallelujah or made a life the spirit is this word made manifest in you that's why it's important to receive the word because jesus said the words that i speak their spirit and their life what is it it's the earnest and man i see this so this is so glorious it is the earnest of the resurrection this body will be raised again because it has already started it was one subject to sin mind corruption but now it's got the illness it turned heavenly so when you get the holy ghost you have the anus of the resurrection itself you have a guarantee like if you fall on the dog that's why paul said dead raise your sting grave praise the victory none for you because i have something in me have the equipment power oh glory not faith could hold this bloody talk what can the lord have shouted in the house glory to god no fear of death no fear of the grave or death prayer register they're dead oh glory to god hallelujah praise god they're waiting they're waiting for us to come to perfection in order to bring on the resurrection well god promised to give you the earnest of it hallelujah the earnest listen to this bomb that's the illness that you are going in the rapture it is the earnest a sick personally they are dying nothing left but debt all that could happen i've seen shadows of people don't eat up with cancer and tuberculosis and see them personally a little while after perfectly normal and strong if there is no divine healing there is no resurrection divine healing as it is you can't tell me there's no signs and wonders and miracles promised to the last day church it's got to have science it's got to have wonders it's got to have divine healing i'll ride this trail once more there'll be one more ride oh glory to god even while we preaching this morning what could heal anybody keem your tumor kill a female condition pop your ear open pop your eye open what could do it for you you don't even have the hands laying on you right where you are power of god come upon you quick and power loosed upon your body oh glory god quick and power oh glory god touch you from the tongue over the head to the stool of your feet even demons leave you by this pregnant power a woman was vexed with her damn her daughter was sex for the devil and when she said the right words oh glory to god even the doors take comes from the master table she said the right thing and the dynamics of the holy ghost hit that devil plumb of the daughter oh give the lord a praise god praise god praise god the dynamics could hit that devil straight over you yes loose them satan let them go oh glory to god hallelujah praise god thank you lord if there's no divine healing there's no resurrection divine healing is the earnest of the resurrection and you are quickened and this quick and power brings your body into a raptured condition glory to god to this rapture ain't no hope and soul and you're wondering if you're gonna make me rapture anytime you're in that zone you're already not making it it can be wondering you know it have to have the same spirit that raise christ from the dead i have to come and dwell in you that you know you are quick and you're made alive praise god you're on your way to the rapture no devil could tell you in a way the devil not going to no rapture he's not going to no resurrection he can watch but yeah touch he can't go where you're going you're going where the devil cannot go he was kicked out of heavenly places oh glory to god hallelujah i know we get into the heavenly places are we going to be in heavenly places operated in heavenly places before we leave here oh glory to god amen thank you lord jesus hallelujah praise god praise god praise god the prophet says quicken them in the upper room it quickened them so much that when they started talk they couldn't talk in the normal tongue they're talking a heavenly language it was the quickening power of god it shook their mortal bodies till their mortal language was transfigured it was transformed into immortal language it was the quick then power praise god now they don't want to speak in tongues every speaking through your pentecostals but when that fire took them in the upper room they were speaking in other tongues after spirit gave them utterance and that coming back too tony's coming back signs and wonders coming back prophecies that coming back to give a healing give her faith give her wisdom give her knowledge give her these illness every gift could be back in the church every one of them not just five full minutes before mercy fight for ministry oh glory to god every ministry we'll give the lord some praises in the house we are backing down for any promise that god spoke in this bible there's going to be another book of acts give a shout on tabernacle there's gonna be another book of acts if this branch put forth another original branch it will spread the original fruit they spoke in your tongues [Music] watch this watch this he gave them promise every promise on the grounds of god's word that was promised in the bible that quickening power was given to them to quicken that promise to them missing limits will be restored that's a prophecy that's a promise the quicken thoughts to come to quicken us to quicken you to believe that the god that create man out of the dust of the earth to give new liver new heart new kidneys new spiral new whatever you have need of a new womb oh glory to god a neutral bone all glory to god whatever you have need of could be created oh glory to god one time one time a woman born blind but with no ice no ice in the circuit none company prayer line and when balram spoke the word fire come down and begin to form the eyes and in the midst of it foreign what color eyes you want she said i think blue is a nice color imagine you interrupt the formation of the eyes to ask what color what color eyes you want is that blue that brown with that black white color i don't want i want it so the woman could see clearly because the god of mid-eyes is alive today that's the colored open ears cut up on your ass today god could open your eyes today [Music] [Applause] there's a holy spirit today hunting on his hearts that will believe that message what and what and when you accept it in his fullness and god knows that you will do it he will give you the abstract to that then every promise that's made is in your possession and the holy spirit is there to quicken that to you what kind of people should we be how wonderful to see the god great holy spirit here in his power my god hallelujah now watch the disciples right you say i have the keys jesus i have the keys of death and hell don't fear anymore for every forwarding predestination seed of god come to life when that light spread across the earth of this glorious gospel it will bring forth the crop that god ordered to do i'm alive or quicken the word means the word quicken the greek words means something that's made a life after death not only that he will send the same life that quickened me the power that brought me from the grave i will send it upon you amen this is dramatizing jesus in the same power that brought me from the grave i will send it upon you to quicken you that way i am you may be also oh praise the name of the lord we must get them to christ we're this quick and powerful i'm wondering today if what's happening are we really getting the people to god or are we just getting them to church we must get them to christ where this quickening power it's good to go to the church sure but if that's far as we go it's not fine enough when you come to church that's good but go on to christ from the church because we must receive this quickening power if we ever expect to be in that general resurrection because that's the only thing will ever bring us from the dead oh glory to god hallelujah i have to have something to bring you out jesus knew it was resident in him that's why he said destroy this body in three days i raised up myself myself because it's something inside of me the quickness power and when jesus died at calvary the devil was clean cleaning glasses and toast in and rejoicing he's dead but jesus knew his body will not see corruption and before them three days up up from the grave he arrows praise god a woman come to see him oh to bring grave clot angel roll away the stone he said tell them i'm not dead tell them i'm risen from the dead go and tell my disciples i'm peter oh glory to god i'm not dead i'm alive i'm alive i'm alive you calculate dead man he rose from the dead oh give the lord a shout and he come back upon this church upon his believers to prove he's the same yesterday today and forever and the only way he could prove it is by his works [Applause] by the same signs same wonders same miracles oh my so the holy spirit is here on earth looking out for individuals that god has ordained to life in this age and as soon as it finds it it does just like it did on jesus christ the great super son of god now that quickening power that came upon jesus quickened him to manifest every promise of the word for that day so does the holy spirit that come upon us in this day is not a mockery holy spirit so when jesus got the anointing of the holy ghost after overcoming lucifer in the wilderness he said the spirit of god is upon me for he had anointed me he was reading the scripture he found the place where it was written but of whether that's why he found his scripture he found the place where it was written the spirit is upon me for he has anointed me oh glory to god glory to god to open the eyes of the blind the set of liberties and to preach the acceptable year of the lord oh glory to god you understand what happened you know the quicken power quickening that scripture isaiah 61 to jesus so he knew his scripture so when he stepped over there he raised the cast of devils now yes yes he reads to challenge every spirit yes yes yes he really praised god and when he went to the wedding as a guest wine ran out and they come to jesus they say ryan ran out he said well what'd i do with that and they say whatever he said just do it he said just draw water on the water pots and all them run when they just give us a man you run like a command in general just do it just do it whether we should just do it if god said raise your hands raise your hands he wants to shout just do it let god say worship just worship just do it he did they run and drop in the water pot i went inside the pool they see the water turned to wine and when they taste that wine they say but there's better people to leave the old wine for last but they keep the better my lunch and he said yes the best for last he said this mine is a good my man god bypass the grapes the person of the grapes god by past fermentation god bypass all the processes to make wine he bypass all of that and just flick the water into wine oh glory to god that's the god we serve this season and lord have mercy god leave the best for last god you leave you for last in this last age here oh glory to god i so privileged to have known you to know you god leave the best for last my god i'm preaching to the best

hallelujah oh glory to god thank you jesus give him praise give him praise hallelujah [Applause] thank you lord for the banham he's talking about okay i'll just say he said years and years after his death his meat had run away from elijah the skin worms that eat it up and they were packing a dead man one day and threw them on that bones and there was so much quicken power till the man come back to life again he raised him right from the dead praise god the quicken powers on the bones and remember we are flesh of his bless we are born of his bones we are his bride death won't bother that quick than power at all through the screen womb destroy this body that's what you said now you understand the position that you was talking from though this kind won't destroy my body yet in my flesh shall i see god since a little bitty boy i have stood here trying to proclaim this i know that in me nothing good have i nothing i have done but in me is that quick and power it quickened me one day from the things of the world as a young man under eternal life the things that happened i've seen visions foretold things he never let nothing fail i have spoke with other tongues i have prophesied i have done those things by the spirit of god that dwelt in me that's the quickening power and i know someday my redeemer is living now and someday when he comes these bones shall rise again and go and meet him in the air you may bury me in the sea you will pull me up whatever you want to that quick and power is eternal give a shout to that it's not temporal this quick and power is eternal i have had it for years it's in me it's in you the spirit that raised jesus from the dead dwells in your mortal body it will quicken you from the team of the world to the word of god only it has quicken you from this life to life eternal or give the lord some praises glory to god almost done hallelujah skip them a lot of things notice this first corner of god should be talking about jesus god's first corner wheat by god's quickening power god had quickened his life raised him from the dead and he was the first fruits of those that slept and the first fruit of any crop must be waved first corn first peas whatever first fruit just take the first of it and wave it before the lord as a wave offering that the rest come in that what do you even mean this is the first one to come to maturity and we wave in it that other sons come in two so jesus was the first fruit of them that slept all the saints sleeping he's the first fruit oh glory that god and he have been waved was the first one to come to maturity it was wave as a memorial of thanksgiving to god believing the rest of them would come it was a sign he was the first son of god to come to full maturity to be in god he was plucked up from the earth and waved over the people what a glorious lesson by the quickening power the first one he was brave on the day of pentecost where there was a song from heaven like a waving mighty russian wind was wave over the people all glory to god and is to be wave again in the last day according to luke 17 30 the son of man to be waved over us again isn't it who's the son of man in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god and the word of his flesh and dwell among us hallelujah is not right luke 17 30 and we are acquainted with that word again is wave over the people and hear what it is that the dead traditional man is dead and the son of god is alive again with the baptism of the holy spirit we're not talking about pentecostal baptism we talk about after son of man luke 17 30 come son of god holy spirit to baptize you into the kingdom or give the lord a shout oh glory to god notice here this revelation at pentecost their bodies were quickened to a new life notice they were cowards they only had mechanics they were sitting there saying i'm afraid of them i'm afraid to go out and make a claim i'm afraid and great bishop hunting out

group i'm afraid to claim a seventh on the revival people say revival pass already we're looking we're looking for something we're looking for revival yes the liars and deceive people and look for no revival they have tribulation to get but the bride has not a revival yet the bride have no manifestation of god to steal her we're not talking about revelation without plenty of act we talk about manifestation of god that is what has promised a manifestation of god almighty not some pastor bringing forth some word now it's called himself jumping on the camp glory look at when solomon was offering the offering to the temple the glory of god filled the tabernacle that's what we're talking about that the minister could not even stand the minister what mystery solomon could bring when the glory of god filled the tabernacle fill the whole house we'll give the lord a shout in the house no mystery can come when glory fill the tabernacle and your tabernacle will be filled with glory oh give the lord a shout but all of a sudden in the upper room these bunch of cowards the doors were shut they're so frightened they closed the door they feared preferred press come down they afraid to church close us down and the pope closes us down and this one how many press come down and who on the closest now nobody can close this down for books and tapes not no body clothing you know but when that fire when they closed down praise god the door shut and that power hit them so oh glory to god listen to this all of a sudden the dynamics come what did it do if not only and it began a revolution here it not only filled their spirit inside it quickened their mechanics their bodies were quickened they were no longer cowards all glory to god all of a sudden they're fearless i like the land of the tribe of judah oh glory to god how wonderful we are hail jesus you're my king oh glory to god they were fearless but the anointing of the land of the cyber tudor [Applause] [Music] glory my god i could see you may be seated when are the numbers hit you all you shy and call aliens quietly ending i could see you fearlessly praise god praise god fear peter step out you know peace of gosh

glory to god hallelujah glory to god glory to god hallelujah and peter's step up and said these people not drunk as you suppose but this is that three thousand souls out there written for quick and power three thousand souls out there waiting for dynamics to be released and when they think so 15 minutes none or two hours so man some people crank around three and four hours a month 15 minutes 15 minutes and then people say what shall we do to be safe he's repent have you won on you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ following missions of your sins and you will receive the same thing we just received oh gloria god you shall receive the holy ghost for the promises unto you until your children and the temple are far off even as many as the lord of our god shall call praise god praise god hallelujah oh glory to the language of kicking you say their thoughts were quickened their spirits were quickened their life was broken they were quickened all together they tried to talk and couldn't talk in any more human language they were so quick enough in the presence of god till they spoke in new tongues a heavenly language what quick then power o praise god and the son has got to be revealed again in a bride in the last days to quit in power hear this prophecy has got to come and quicken them out of these dead denominations and preach to a living word of the living god he prophesied his quran power we're talking about god to come i believe it's here this morning praise god the quickening power wasn't only in their soul it was all over them when they lay hands not pray just just lay hands upon the sick they have to recover do you get that they didn't even have to pray brother kindly it was so upon them all over them it was all over their bodies that's why they took cloth and rested upon paul a hallelujah and take it to sick people because the quickening power was upon paul's body so when your rest is on the body the clothes have the kicking power on it and you're taking this quick and power and rested in the presses on the blind presses the loop what what a glory to god hallelujah hallelujah this is real real quick and power real quick and power it is a spirit equipment oh hallelujah my god let me read this again musicians the quickening power wasn't only in their soul it was all over them not only the dynamics come in to quicken but the quicken the mechanics he is calling their bodies the mechanics their bodies were mechanics the pentecostal bodies were shocked that's why god had opened a whole new age the pride is because the holy ghost fell upon them but they couldn't come true because that was a shock but you are seed you are word oh glory to god the bride becomes the word itself so the spirit has to come upon the bride that's all the bible the spirit and the bride say come because the spirit will among the bride why because the bride becomes the word oh glory to god in the spirit amongst the word and writes the word you becomes the word and the spirit come upon you oh glory to god and write it down to the resurrection oh my hallelujah they were so quick and when i picked them power they went their lay hands and upon the sick whole glory though they were healed by the laying down of hands and the spirit quickening their flesh together with god they were also so quick and witten into the presence of god when a person died and their soul had gone off it called him back to life again one time paul preaching a man fell off all of the balcony he fought dead he went down pray and get the man back up live and conquer the preacher that was normal normal normal operation are dead raise that praise god a sick heal that a blind make that see death make him here don't make him speak let's continue okay the lord some praises it's jesus the same works he did continues to do operation in the church do you want to see that my god so if it comes into you you can say it it is so and if it be so these signs shall follow them that will quicken you okay we're in the home church here now so mine let's see some evidence that they've quit in power and what it did what it did let's notice stephen speaking stephen deakin stephen was so full of quickening power he was full of quickening power not have a full quarterfinal full of it i like what he says but follow the holy ghost no yeah the holy ghost halfway don't follow the holy ghost well it didn't make him scared he said you stiff neck and on circumcised of heart and ears you do resist the holy ghost as your father did then they start to put stone on him they say let's get rid of that guy when he died he stoned him and his poor head the stone's beaten against it he said i see heavens open why are they stoning him they quickly pour upon him peter was there feeling nothing he said but they feel nothing he's like see heaven's open he said quick then power was working i see heavens open and jesus standing at the right hand of god that is what the quickening power done for stephen oh glory to god hallelujah praise god hallelujah another fellow with a quick and power name philip he was so full of the quickening power he was having a great big meeting on samaria devils has been cast out he was baptized in the name of jesus they had a real meeting and the spirit spoke the dynamics come down and said leave this revival but what will the minister say don't make any difference what is he he was full of the quickening power he had the gasoline the dynamics has fallen upon him go out into the desert and he found that you not there ethiopian eunuch he obeyed god and obedience to god he was baptized in the name of jesus christ and watched the quicken power pick you up then and when praise go and philip was done praise god and obey god he was so full of the quickening power till it caught him away he was translated from the revival to the desert and get translated back without maxi without taxi without far without uber or give the lord some praises it was the quickness power that was moving him oh glory to god isn't that right it quickened philip till he hadn't been seen for maybe 150 miles somewhere in another country it quickened his mortal body how did he do it he was full of the quickening power he said oh church of the living god we can't stand along here with little sugar tits that we haven't been nursing wrong here today we have got to be full and prayed up with the quickening power until the quickening of the holy ghost we got to be caught up someday in the rapture over yonder praise god praise god there was a man be a closing there was a man named enoch he walked with every word for about 500 years he had a testimony having one time failed this word he was so full of the quickening power when the dynamics hit him on their mechanics he didn't even have to die he just took up home he started walking he was so full of the quickening power enoch with a perfect testimony all glory and he become so full of dynamics mechanics until when the quickness power struck him oh the quickest strike here yes when the pigman struck him the mechanics is just lifting them up oh my hallelujah praise god praise god hallelujah hallelujah look what we've seen in this day the christian powers come to us to open the seven seals what was it the intelligence of man no the quickening power of god see the quick and power foretold what will take place he is the one who opened those seals he is those seals for the whole word of god is christ christ is the seals that was opened what is the open of the seas then revealing christ oh praise god praise god and so it is today and this is the final quote praise god so it is today we try we don't try to become a big person we don't care what the people say about us our name ain't nothing it is his name our life it is nothing it is his life it is his power not our power there is only one thing that we love to do is to see him glorified how can it be when he is glorified in us by his resurrection that is in us we see him represented again today did you get that our desire is not to be glorified or desire is not some big meme all desire is not the buddha church or make some more sunday school or try to bring a hot tie or pushing or off a picnic party or bring stars and buttons and something else like that that's not our desire all his eyes are seen glorified not with self pride but in us our lives to prove he's alive and living in us if i can get myself out of the way so when william branham not even taught her not even taught of till we can see jesus glorify among us see him that's what these are gives us the quickening power gives us joy to know that we are with him both flesh and bone of him being pride of him seeing his vindicate methods proven to us he is recently there may the lord bless you could be stan and give god some praises thank you so much i appreciate you i love you and thanks for hearing this morning may god fill
