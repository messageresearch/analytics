[8:57] while we have the internet we say
[8:58] welcome
[9:00] to this evening service
[9:02] o praise the name of the lord
[9:05] reading from
[9:06] saint john chapter 20.
[9:09] i want to read from verse 19 to 22
[9:11] and revelation 2 we just read two verses
[9:14] one and two
[9:15] reading from saint john chapter 20
[9:17] verse
[9:20] 19. then the same day at evening being
[9:24] the first of the week
[9:26] when the doors were shut with the
[9:28] disciples where the disciples
[9:30] were assembled for fear of the jews came
[9:32] jesus
[9:33] stood in the midst and said unto them
[9:35] peace be on to you
[9:38] when he had so said
[9:39] he showed unto them his hands
[9:41] and his side
[9:43] then were the disciples glad when they
[9:46] saw the lord
[9:47] then said jesus to them again
[9:50] peace be unto you
[9:52] as my father had sent me
[9:54] even so send are you
[9:56] and when he had said this
[9:58] he breathed on them
[10:00] and see it unto them
[10:02] receive receiving
[10:04] the holy ghost
[10:06] and from revelation chapter 2 unto the
[10:08] angel of the church of ephesus right
[10:11] be staying saith he
[10:14] that whole let the seven stars in his
[10:16] right hand who walk it in the midst of
[10:19] the seven golden candlesticks
[10:22] i know thy works and i labor
[10:24] and i patience and how though cancer
[10:26] bear them which are evil and i was try
[10:29] them which say they apostles and are not
[10:32] and has found them liars
[10:35] may god bless the reader of his word you
[10:36] may be seated
[10:38] who prays the name of the lord
[10:41] blessed be the name of the lord
[10:45] tonight for a title
[10:47] i have received the holy ghost
[10:49] the dynamics the spirit
[10:56] i have an inspiration
[11:01] word revealed will of god
[11:05] word reveal
[11:07] will of god so the title is received in
[11:09] the holy ghost
[11:10] the dynamics
[11:12] the spirit
[11:15] let me give you john's prophecy
[11:18] from matthew chapter 3
[11:21] verse 11 to 12 this is john
[11:23] i indeed baptize you with water unto
[11:26] repentance
[11:28] but he had cometh after me
[11:30] is mightier than i
[11:32] whose shoes i am not worthy to bear
[11:35] he shall baptize you with the holy ghost
[11:39] and with fire amen
[11:41] fan is in his hand he will thoroughly
[11:44] purge his floor and guard his wheat into
[11:46] the ghana but he will burn up the chaff
[11:49] with unquenchable fire
[11:51] that was john's prophecy
[11:54] so john prophesied that fire was coming
[11:57] john prophesied a power was coming
[12:00] it is still you shall receive power
[12:02] it is still the spirit promised
[12:05] it is still dynamics to your mechanics
[12:07] isn't that right
[12:09] but a brand name there it's he
[12:10] said we must first find the will of god
[12:14] before you can do the will of god
[12:17] you must first know
[12:19] what his will is in the matter then
[12:22] don't turn it loose like the lady said
[12:25] she's trying to get beyond that song
[12:26] barrier then the plane just picks up
[12:28] speed and goes unlimited and when you
[12:30] can pray until you have passed the doubt
[12:33] barrier then you are running free
[12:35] you can go on nothing can bother you
[12:37] then because you are running free you
[12:40] are past the unbelief it has been
[12:42] settled it's all over isn't that right
[12:45] so for instance if
[12:47] i had a loaf i want a loaf of bread i'm
[12:49] starving a loaf of bread would save my
[12:51] life
[12:52] and i would ask for the bread and some
[12:54] man will give me a 25 cents that's the
[12:56] purchase price of a loaf of bread i can
[12:59] just be as happy as holding the 25 cents
[13:02] in my hand as i can with the loaf of
[13:04] bread
[13:05] because it's the purchasing power
[13:08] notice i haven't got the bread i haven't
[13:10] but i've got the purchasing power
[13:13] which is the faith
[13:15] so deep faith restored back give you the
[13:18] purchasing power for what god promised
[13:20] you
[13:22] hallelujah
[13:23] notice these disciples they didn't have
[13:25] the holy ghost here
[13:26] but they needed to be comforted
[13:28] and jesus said peace be unto you
[13:31] i will stop your worry
[13:33] stop your complaint
[13:34] stop your fuss
[13:36] hush your first
[13:37] peace be unto you
[13:39] as my father sent me
[13:41] so send are you
[13:43] jesus drop a promise on them and he
[13:45] wasn't ready for it yet but he knew that
[13:48] belongs to them
[13:50] he knew that the father that was in him
[13:53] was going to be in them
[13:54] he knew they would receive a promise
[13:57] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[14:01] he was so sure
[14:03] that they was going to be filled he said
[14:05] as my father sent me
[14:07] so sent are you
[14:09] and the father that sent him was in him
[14:12] he was telling him the spirit power that
[14:15] no resides in me
[14:17] going to be in you
[14:19] peace be unto you
[14:20] stop your worry stop wondering if you're
[14:23] going to get the holy ghost
[14:25] receiving the holy ghost
[14:27] and he breathing on them
[14:29] oh hallelujah
[14:31] the breath of god came over there
[14:34] oh give the lord some praises people
[14:37] oh
[14:38] hallelujah
[14:40] oh hallelujah
[14:41] they didn't have it yet but they had the
[14:43] 25 cents they didn't have the bread here
[14:46] but they had the 25 cents oh do you love
[14:49] him
[14:50] so when you pray
[14:51] until you get the assurance you can be
[14:54] just as happy as if the cancer is gone
[14:58] shout just as loud because they got the
[15:01] purchasing power
[15:02] the fate that moves the thing
[15:04] then you are perseverant
[15:06] no one can tell anything different it
[15:08] doesn't matter you're crossing some
[15:10] barrier
[15:11] oh hallelujah praise the name of the
[15:13] lord
[15:14] do you believe that
[15:16] you know the bible in thessalonians 5 21
[15:19] prove all things hold fast that which is
[15:22] good and when anything is proven it will
[15:24] be proven right or wrong
[15:27] and when there's anything in question
[15:30] it should be proven
[15:32] until you find out what is right
[15:34] and as you find what is right it said
[15:37] hold fast
[15:38] in other words grip it don't turn it
[15:40] loose
[15:40] hold fast none of us hold it tight
[15:43] hold fast at that which is good
[15:46] after it has been proven right
[15:49] and anything that's proven not right to
[15:51] the loose
[15:52] as quick as you can get away from it
[15:55] don't never hold on to the wrong thing
[15:58] now it is possible that staunch
[16:00] christians
[16:01] find people hold sometimes to the wrong
[16:03] thing
[16:04] thinking it is right but then these
[16:07] things should be proven
[16:08] whether they are right or wrong
[16:10] and it's the duty of all of us as we are
[16:13] expecting to go to heaven when jesus
[16:15] come it's the minister's duty when a
[16:18] question is brought up that he sells
[16:20] this out and then proves it before the
[16:23] people that they might understand
[16:26] because no one wants to be found wrong
[16:30] holding the wrong thing
[16:32] now we have a scripture and jesus said
[16:34] all scriptures must be fulfilled then we
[16:36] should prove all things and hold fast
[16:39] hold it tight with a dead grip
[16:41] all faster that vision is good
[16:43] i remember in school i learned something
[16:45] many of you learn the same lesson when
[16:47] you have solve a problem work it out you
[16:50] can take the answer and prove it by the
[16:51] problem
[16:53] in other words two plus three is five
[16:56] and you could you know you could flip it
[16:58] back and forth but all will be five
[17:00] four and one is five isn't that right
[17:02] you could always get a confirmation that
[17:04] you have the correct answer
[17:06] say how many ever did that all of you of
[17:08] course then you don't have to worry
[17:09] whether your answer is right or not the
[17:12] problem answer has been proven by the
[17:14] problem the answer has been proven by
[17:16] the problem therefore you got it right
[17:18] so if every one of you
[17:20] on your slate or sheet has been proven
[17:23] the answer proved by the problem then
[17:24] you got it no one can say you're wrong
[17:27] and if you do your work neatly and
[17:28] correctly and the way it should be done
[17:30] your answer has been proved you can sit
[17:33] back and rest with the assurance that
[17:35] you're going to get an a on that
[17:37] on that sheet of paper that you turn in
[17:40] because it has been proven by the
[17:42] problem
[17:44] you can flip it anywhere
[17:46] so it can't just be one scripture it had
[17:48] to be lined up online here little dear
[17:51] level it must be able to run from
[17:53] genesis to the book of revelation
[17:55] isn't that right
[17:57] so god in every age fulfill and prove
[17:59] the work that he settled for that age
[18:02] and every time that god word has been
[18:04] proven in the age the majority has
[18:06] turned it down
[18:07] you can only have faith here we go as
[18:10] god give you faith
[18:12] faith is a gift of god
[18:14] whatever how religious you may be it
[18:16] must be have faith and your faith can
[18:19] only rest on watch if you're a christian
[18:22] upon the proven word of god
[18:24] so your faith can't just rest on words
[18:27] it has to rest on proven words
[18:29] hallelujah you fake i rest on a dream
[18:32] or somebody tell you it's got to be what
[18:35] god said
[18:37] it got to be the revealed word
[18:40] the word that god has unveiled or
[18:42] unfolded we believe that
[18:44] so from the voice of god he said there
[18:46] are so many voices on the earth today
[18:48] it's absolutely a hard thing because
[18:50] it's dead in the voice of the
[18:51] supernatural there are so many
[18:53] intellectual voices great voices of
[18:56] mighty men who are intellectual and in
[18:59] the intellectual condition even shake
[19:01] nations they are not just overnight
[19:04] people but they shake nations bringing
[19:07] great organization together florally and
[19:10] a person would be confused
[19:12] how these things could go on and prosper
[19:15] and their voices that raise up and do
[19:18] these things
[19:19] and it causes the voice of god to be
[19:22] placed way back somewhere
[19:24] the true voice of god now here we go and
[19:27] the voice of god they say
[19:29] how will we know it's the voice of god
[19:32] because for today it wasn't a vindicated
[19:34] prophet now today how do we know it's
[19:37] the voice of god because it's it's the
[19:41] manifestation of the prophet's word
[19:44] that is how you will know it is god's
[19:46] voice
[19:47] in other words we have to come to the
[19:49] spot where we can say this is that that
[19:53] the prophet william branham speak of
[19:56] then we enrique said this is that that
[19:58] will be a manifestation of the prophet's
[20:00] word
[20:01] my word don't count but the prophet will
[20:04] does
[20:05] god said i am he that hold it the seven
[20:08] stars in my right hand
[20:11] oh give the lord some praise as people
[20:13] so god himself was holding these
[20:16] messengers in his right hand
[20:18] his voice was speaking through them
[20:21] oh praise the name of the lord do you
[20:23] believe that
[20:24] hallelujah
[20:26] so but abraham said and the true voice
[20:27] of god only brings back that real living
[20:31] supernatural god with a supernatural
[20:33] word with the supernatural manifestation
[20:35] of the true word he said there's so much
[20:37] of the other realm but that that almost
[20:40] deadened that but it will listen it will
[20:42] come forth
[20:43] oh praise god say their voices go into
[20:46] the land praise god since buddha branham
[20:50] left the scene all kind of
[20:51] interpretation and so on has gone to the
[20:53] land isn't that right but god promised
[20:54] that they'll come a real supernatural
[20:57] voice of god which will be a
[20:59] manifestation of the prophet's word you
[21:01] mean the voice of god is god himself yes
[21:04] the bride will be given a voice so in
[21:06] revelation chapter four he said the
[21:07] voice of the throne before the truth was
[21:09] seven stars the voice of the stars not
[21:11] one voice voices what was it god
[21:14] speaking to the church oh hallelujah so
[21:17] god voice god have to speak to the
[21:19] church oh do we believe that
[21:21] the voice of the seven ages the voices
[21:24] speaking with thunder and lightning
[21:26] nowhere these days they still want to
[21:27] say hell in the pulpit he said we need
[21:30] men of god men who want all back now
[21:32] everybody can't be a preacher but you
[21:34] got a voice
[21:36] hallelujah hallelujah everybody can be a
[21:39] preacher but you got a voice and if you
[21:41] can't preach the people of sermon if
[21:43] you're a preacher you're called to the
[21:45] pulpit to preach if you are not you are
[21:47] still a preacher
[21:49] so everybody in here preachers
[21:51] he said no watch you're still a preacher
[21:53] but leave the people a sermon
[21:55] let your sermon be live
[21:58] and it's the voice of god
[22:01] what's that a live sermon
[22:04] or give the lord some praises
[22:06] not a preached sermon
[22:08] but a live sermon
[22:10] is the voice of god
[22:13] oh let's give the lord a shout to pray
[22:18] oh
[22:19] hallelujah hallelujah say it again
[22:22] how do we know is the voice of god it
[22:24] will be a manifestation of the prophet's
[22:27] word and the prophet said unleash him
[22:30] that's the voice of god
[22:31] you cannot stop any voice
[22:34] that's the thunder
[22:36] oh they're gonna shake that devil
[22:39] you cannot stop a life
[22:41] a life hits
[22:43] alive ponders
[22:44] a life cannot be defeated
[22:46] with the pork concrete the plant gonna
[22:49] still spring up
[22:51] or out of your belly
[22:53] shuffle rivers have lived in water
[22:56] life is gonna come
[22:58] light is gonna come
[23:00] you're gonna come forth
[23:02] oh hallelujah
[23:05] let your sermon be lived
[23:07] and it's the voice of god that will
[23:10] bring reproach to them and reject it
[23:12] wow
[23:13] you mean your life could be rejected
[23:15] that's right
[23:17] and we're not talking about words now
[23:18] we're talking about their life
[23:20] watch they will say yeah the testimony
[23:23] they know people testimonial there's not
[23:25] they will write

[36:26] it
[36:27] god don't provide anything less you have
[36:31] need of it
[36:32] a little rookie with a 90-pound pack on

[36:39] see any necessary packing that 90 pound

[36:44] and hand grenades everything else but
[36:46] let him get in the battle once
[36:48] time will come you must you must have it
[36:51] that is why here we go
[36:53] the oral wise god
[36:56] equipped his army
[36:58] with the baptism of the holy ghost
[37:01] he knowed
[37:02] these elect intellectual giants would
[37:05] stand in this last day
[37:07] he know they would stand
[37:09] and they would be able to explain
[37:12] by their great wisdom cause of satan
[37:14] peter said like a roman lion but i am
[37:16] not going to leave you comfortless i'm
[37:18] going to come to you he equipped his
[37:21] army with the baptism of the holy ghost
[37:24] luke 24 49 behold i send the promise of
[37:29] my father upon you bacteria in the city
[37:32] of jerusalem until you be endued with
[37:36] power from one hand
[37:38] and after death the holy ghost is to
[37:41] come upon you
[37:43] then you shall be witnesses
[37:46] unto me
[37:47] in jerusalem acts 1 8
[37:50] plum to the uttermost part of the earth
[37:53] this is what you come to church for
[37:56] this is why you are here tonight
[37:59] not just to say amen but to receive
[38:01] power

[38:25] with the holy ghost
[38:27] he knew he had they have to have them
[38:30] he knowed to be effective witness here
[38:32] we go
[38:33] to be an effective witness
[38:36] of his resurrection they would have to
[38:39] have the holy ghost

[38:44] power
[38:45] when last have you heard that
[38:47] the gospel
[38:49] is not just word only
[38:51] the gospel is to demonstrate the power
[38:55] so we are yet to see the gospel preached
[38:58] because when the gospel
[39:00] begins to be preached its mechanics and
[39:03] dynamics together

[39:50] frightened but they know god speed upon
[39:53] them
[39:54] receiving the holy ghost

[41:56] of the ages
[41:58] speaking churches book
[42:00] brother branham you'll see that
[42:02] he ready make reference to the scripture
[42:04] we read
[42:05] version 2 1. listen carefully
[42:07] notice
[42:08] revelation 2 1
[42:10] describe the lord jesus
[42:12] as in the midst of his church
[42:14] holding the messengers in his right hand
[42:17] because his bride has fallen
[42:19] because the church corporate
[42:21] is now a mixture
[42:23] of true and false
[42:25] he does not leave it
[42:28] it is his
[42:30] that's beautiful
[42:32] he knows that true and false but he does
[42:34] not abandon the church i am he that walk
[42:36] in the midst
[42:37] of the seven golden slams
[42:40] so i miss true and false he's still
[42:42] walking
[42:43] i miss true and fault he's still there
[42:45] now watch for none of us live unto
[42:47] himself
[42:48] but diet or diet himself
[42:51] whether believer we live unto the lord
[42:53] whether we die we die unto the lord
[42:56] whether we live there for or die we are
[42:58] the lords
[42:59] for to this end christ both died
[43:02] rose and revived
[43:03] that he might be the lord both of the
[43:06] dead and the living
[43:07] on the cross here we go
[43:09] he bought
[43:11] the whole
[43:12] world of people
[43:14] they are heroes
[43:15] he is the lord of the living and the
[43:17] dead
[43:18] as pertaining to ownership
[43:21] not relationship
[43:24] hallelujah in other words the whole
[43:26] world is in his hands he owns everyone
[43:29] isn't that right
[43:31] he walk in the midst of that body and
[43:33] has been in it life
[43:35] and death
[43:37] what was planted in the first age will
[43:40] develop in the second age and all the
[43:42] ages until it come to maturity and
[43:44] harvest
[43:45] thus in the smelling age
[43:47] we expect an enlargement and
[43:50] enlightenment of the church corporate
[43:51] history through a revelation of the
[43:53] spirit
[43:54] in this age
[43:56] the hatred of the false vine increases
[43:59] they have separated themselves from the
[44:01] company of the true
[44:02] they went out from them they were liars
[44:06] they call themselves what they are not
[44:08] but god did god destroy them
[44:11] no
[44:12] let them alone
[44:14] both will go to the harvest
[44:16] but lord they shall be destroyed for
[44:18] they are destroying thy people they are
[44:20] killing them
[44:21] no
[44:22] let them alone
[44:24] but to my bride i say be thou faithful
[44:27] unto death
[44:28] love me even more
[44:31] oh are you with me tonight
[44:34] we learn in no uncertain terms
[44:37] that the false vine
[44:39] is the vine of satan
[44:41] their gathering is of him satan
[44:44] they meet in the name of god and lie
[44:46] that they are christ
[44:47] they preach
[44:49] they teach they baptize
[44:51] they worship they partake of various
[44:54] rights given by christ to the church yet
[44:56] they are not of god
[44:58] but since they say they are
[45:01] god
[45:02] will hold them responsible and in each
[45:04] age he speaks of them
[45:07] and
[45:08] to them
[45:09] amen
[45:11] oh hallelujah
[45:14] they remind us of balaam
[45:16] he had a prophetic office he knew the
[45:18] proper approach unto god as demonstrated
[45:21] by the sacrifice of clean beasts yet
[45:23] here we go he was not a true
[45:26] word prophet
[45:29] he was a prophet but not a word prophet
[45:31] oh let's go down now for when god told
[45:34] him
[45:35] not to go and honor balak with his
[45:37] presence he sought to go anyway
[45:39] for he was motivated by his lust for
[45:42] goal and prestige
[45:44] so god let him go
[45:46] the perfect will of god
[45:48] give way to the permissive will of god
[45:51] because of the heart's desire
[45:56] so that is why you have to come to the
[45:59] revealed word will
[46:01] of god
[46:03] your heart desires out of it
[46:06] because i'm going to mess you up
[46:10] because when dalam asked god god said
[46:12] don't go but he wanted to go he gone and
[46:14] asked god to see the lord what you
[46:16] always say second time what she go
[46:19] perfect will
[46:20] turn to permissive will
[46:22] and bilaam could tell anybody god told
[46:24] me to go
[46:26] i have a testimony
[46:28] god spoke to me
[46:30] and just said that god spoke of them and
[46:32] to them yes
[46:34] hallelujah scary isn't it
[46:36] watch this
[46:38] the perfect will of god
[46:40] give way to the permissible of god
[46:42] because of the heart's desire of belong
[46:46] god actually said go ahead
[46:49] did god change his mind no sir
[46:52] god had his way
[46:53] regardless of balaam going balaam did
[46:56] not annul the will of god
[46:58] god had his way regardless it was balaam
[47:02] who was the loser
[47:03] for he bypassed the word
[47:06] and any time somebody bypassed the word
[47:08] that's a loser
[47:09] isn't that right because god cannot
[47:11] bless error or bless anything that
[47:13] bypasses the word
[47:14] isn't that right today we have the very
[47:16] same thing woman preachers organizations
[47:19] false doctrine people worshiping god
[47:21] manifesting in the spirit going right on
[47:23] as the day lamb claiming that god has
[47:25] spoken to them even when the commission
[47:28] receives opposite to the revealed word
[47:30] and i will not deny that god spoke to
[47:32] them but it was just like when he spoke
[47:34] to bill and that second time as he knew
[47:37] that balaam wanted his own heart desire
[47:40] above the word and he gave it to him yet
[47:43] all the while in the end having his own
[47:45] way
[47:46] even so today and this is taught from
[47:49] even so today god will tell folks to go
[47:52] ahead in their own hearts desires but
[47:54] they have already rejected the word
[47:57] but the will of god will be done
[47:59] regardless
[48:00] i hope you see this
[48:02] and listen to this caution
[48:04] it will not only clear up much of what
[48:06] is seen in all ages
[48:07] but it will especially help in this last
[48:10] age
[48:12] which has so much manifestation and
[48:14] external blessings when the whole period
[48:17] is so against the word reveal will of
[48:19] god
[48:20] amen
[48:22] that's where i get it from
[48:24] when the whole period is so against the
[48:26] word
[48:27] revealed will of god
[48:30] that is why you have to be in the word
[48:33] for god's will
[48:34] to be revealed to you
[48:37] there should have known jesus was the
[48:39] messiah
[48:40] jesus told them moses spoke of me
[48:42] these people were reading scripture
[48:44] every sabbath table when the
[48:46] manifestation come they rejected it amen
[48:49] because they had their own thoughts of
[48:51] how the messiah was going to come and
[48:54] god is his own interpreter
[48:56] you can tell god don't bless this one
[48:58] bless this one don't bless this one he
[49:01] want to bless who he wants to bless
[49:05] hallelujah i feel god want to bless
[49:07] someone here tonight
[49:10] [Applause]
[49:17] so now to be an effective witness of god
[49:20] you have to have the holy ghost
[49:23] because without the holy ghost you can't
[49:25] make it live
[49:27] isn't that right
[49:28] praise the name of the lord
[49:30] so therefore jesus breathed upon them
[49:32] received holy ghost why to put them on
[49:36] the expectation
[49:38] listeners questions and answers brother
[49:39] branham dear brother branham what is the
[49:42] difference when jesus breathed on the
[49:43] disciples and said receiver the holy
[49:45] ghost
[49:46] and when
[49:47] they had to go to the upper room to
[49:49] tarry
[49:50] and sell
[49:52] it was a promise he gave them
[49:54] he breathed upon them his promise
[49:56] he said receive the holy ghost it was a
[49:59] promise they went to the upper room to
[50:02] wait for the promise to be fulfilled
[50:04] the same thing is when we lay hands upon
[50:06] you to be healed then you go about your
[50:08] business waiting for the promise to be
[50:10] fulfilled that's all like wait till them
[50:13] seven thunders utter the voices of that
[50:15] group
[50:16] we have to wait
[50:17] until the promise be fulfilled
[50:20] then like peter we come out of all day
[50:21] says that
[50:23] that the prophet william random speaker
[50:26] it's now fulfilled
[50:28] it's history are you with me
[50:30] oh glory to god amen i love you lord
[50:32] hallelujah
[50:34] praise the lord
[50:36] from conferences brother branham and get
[50:38] so many conference was the only one that
[50:40] could die he company all then when the
[50:43] great time come he had to make a final
[50:45] decision no doubt the father said are
