[31:37] okay god bless you uh
[31:40] i am very grateful to pastor
[31:45] and you theo allowed me this time
[31:49] i know he's taught me to go for about 10
[31:51] minutes to give my testimony
[31:55] or how i came to that message in fact
[31:58] i've heard so many times for brother
[32:00] theo
[32:00] long time ago but i never had the
[32:03] privilege of meeting with him
[32:04] even to see him and by god's grace
[32:09] in 2019 i was invited by the
[32:15] in the convention in enugu that's why i
[32:18] met with
[32:19] pastor theo we had some very nice time
[32:22] of
[32:23] fellowship and we enjoyed the world
[32:27] and since he asked me
[32:30] to just give a testimony for about 10
[32:33] minutes i'll try to do so
[32:34] in fact i feel like i am handicapped
[32:38] because here on the island of mauritius
[32:41] have been colonized first by the french
[32:43] people and
[32:45] we are i am more inclined to speak
[32:49] french and
[32:50] also we have our own dialect which is
[32:53] creole that's our island language here
[32:56] that's how we preach we don't preach in
[32:59] english therefore i
[33:01] i hope that i can get across to you
[33:05] with my english i want to tell you that
[33:09] i
[33:10] have never
[33:14] known the message the way that god has
[33:17] led me to it now
[33:19] in fact i was a very was very uh if i
[33:24] can use the expression i was very mad
[33:26] with the message people because the
[33:28] message
[33:30] was like a threat to
[33:33] my denomination i came from
[33:37] first the assembly of god i was
[33:40] maybe you don't know my religion i was
[33:43] i came my great-grandfather came from
[33:47] south india and from there we used to
[33:51] practice our religion
[33:54] i was sick for 16 years from birth
[33:58] i was sick with asthma it was
[34:02] quite a chronic asthmatic condition i
[34:06] thought i
[34:06] i would die with that one one of the
[34:09] those days you know
[34:11] my mother brought me to the first
[34:13] doctorate
[34:14] i was three months old and for
[34:18] 16 years i was sick i remember i
[34:21] couldn't go to school i couldn't
[34:23] really study as i should i couldn't even
[34:26] sit normally
[34:27] to study i have to just
[34:31] put my foot on the chair just to be able
[34:33] to gasp for breath
[34:35] and i've seen people die in front of me
[34:37] with asthma
[34:39] my dad had to rub me with some
[34:42] you know cream because i was gasping for
[34:46] breath
[34:46] we've done so many things in religion
[34:48] i've gone to
[34:50] my gods my dad made a vow
[34:53] to our god three years i've been
[34:57] i don't know that you know the practice
[34:58] we have to carry our guards
[35:01] walked barefooted it was a sunny day you
[35:05] know the
[35:06] road surface was very hot very difficult
[35:08] but yet
[35:09] with the valve that we made and the
[35:12] fasting that we observed
[35:15] it was like that we carry our guards
[35:18] it's very strange the way i'm
[35:19] saying to you that we have to carry our
[35:23] guards
[35:23] walk it's like a pilgrimage and then
[35:27] we even have to walk through fire that's
[35:30] the way that we serve our gods
[35:32] we had many gods and
[35:35] we have never come come across the bible
[35:40] in our life we never read that book we
[35:43] had our own religious
[35:45] book and then for the first time i was
[35:49] 16 years old
[35:50] some young people came home maybe about
[35:52] a month ago
[35:54] it was in 1975
[35:58] they came and testified about jesus
[36:00] christ and
[36:02] it was very strange for us my dad also
[36:05] was very sick
[36:06] for nearly 20 years 22 years he was sick
[36:09] he had he had to undergo many surgical
[36:13] operations but
[36:14] every time he was ready for the surgical
[36:18] everything was postponed and it was
[36:19] becoming skinny
[36:21] how the days were going by
[36:24] then one afternoon i came from school i
[36:27] was
[36:28] very very sick with high fever and i was
[36:31] gasping for breath i remember i could
[36:34] hardly breathe
[36:36] and when i reached home my dad told me
[36:39] do you want to go to church
[36:40] i thought he was talking about our
[36:42] church our you know
[36:44] tamil church
[36:47] but he said no let's go that those young
[36:51] people
[36:52] talk to us about jesus christ let's go
[36:53] and see
[36:55] reluctantly i followed my dad it was a
[36:58] friday i think on the 16th of may
[37:02] an evening service i went there
[37:06] and i was sitting
[37:09] like on the tenth row
[37:14] and listening i just came from school
[37:18] and listening to the to the preaching
[37:21] i'll be honest with you i was
[37:24] i was crying
[37:28] the pastor was preaching on the
[37:30] political song
[37:32] oh my that sermon
[37:36] i was asking myself why sitting there
[37:40] what is that book he's reading from
[37:43] extracting tears from my eyes
[37:45] i was really shocked and i was crying
[37:48] weeping and after the service
[37:52] he he called for a prayer line
[37:56] for those who were sick before i was
[37:58] that's the reason i went there
[38:00] my dad brought me there and i found
[38:02] myself in the queue
[38:04] when it came to my time the pastor asked
[38:07] me
[38:09] his name was nicole he asked me do you
[38:12] believe in mark 16.
[38:13] you know i i look at him
[38:16] like with surprise eyes you know because
[38:19] i never read the bible i don't know
[38:21] what he's referring to you know then he
[38:24] called the scripture to me
[38:26] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[38:28] they shall recover and he asks me do you
[38:30] believe that
[38:31] i can remember you know with that time i
[38:34] can't
[38:34] i can't tell you how it happened but
[38:38] with a childlike faith
[38:41] i just told him that
[38:46] uh yes and he prayed for me
[38:50] from that very moment i got healed
[38:53] completely
[38:55] of my asthma today i'm 62 years old that
[38:58] was 46 years later
[39:01] never been sick again and i did
[39:05] a term of three or four years in the
[39:06] assembly of god but i was looking for
[39:08] the truth
[39:09] something deep inside of me told me
[39:11] there was
[39:12] a deeper truth than that i got the holy
[39:15] ghost there you know i
[39:16] was pentecostal people speaking in
[39:19] tongues but
[39:20] when i read the bible said when the holy
[39:21] ghost shall come it shall
[39:23] lead you into all the truth
[39:26] that i knew that there was more truth to
[39:29] that
[39:31] and it would be a long story i
[39:34] just ended in the pentecostal church
[39:38] the upc and i was
[39:41] one of the mem founded members of the
[39:43] upc and one of the
[39:44] founder pastors and for nine years i was
[39:47] there
[39:48] and the message came to mauritius in
[39:50] november 1978 and the message was a
[39:53] threat
[39:54] to my church to the upc
[39:57] therefore i did all i can to fight the
[40:00] message i even
[40:01] pulled people out of the message
[40:05] and i'll tell you the result the
[40:06] consequences of that
[40:08] are fairly sick i got schizophrenia
[40:11] which is one of the worst cases of
[40:13] depression
[40:14] and i told my psychiatrist while he was
[40:16] giving me the tablets i told him i'm
[40:18] going to
[40:19] commit suicide he was scared and he gave
[40:22] me some other
[40:24] tablets higher dosage you know try to
[40:28] just to prevent me from doing that and
[40:31] that's when i came to the message
[40:34] i came from a trip from hong kong a
[40:36] non-stop fight on a truth on a tuesday
[40:39] 2nd of march 1993
[40:43] i went first time
[40:46] on the 7th of march to the message
[40:48] church there i
[40:49] i got a message today is around
[40:52] 28 years now the lord has helped me
[40:56] with a message i've been able to go to
[40:58] madagascar because i was a missionary to
[41:00] madagascar also
[41:01] in 1982 and 1996 i went there 14 years
[41:05] later
[41:06] and i preach until today there are about
[41:08] 24 years
[41:10] during three or four times a year i've
[41:13] been going to madagascar
[41:15] i've been able to go to many many
[41:18] several numerous areas in madagascar
[41:21] preaching the message bringing the books
[41:24] there
[41:25] even in the beginning i was doing the
[41:27] translation myself getting the people
[41:28] translated into malagasy language but
[41:30] today
[41:31] i'm very happy that vijaya voice of god
[41:33] has taken over
[41:34] with some very very nice job they are
[41:36] doing there having even
[41:38] somebody on the spot there to do the
[41:40] recording
[41:42] the voice recording and and to have the
[41:44] books translated
[41:45] a fantastic job and madagascar and is on
[41:49] fire
[41:49] i can tell you that i'm very happy to
[41:53] have been able to
[41:53] talk to you about my testimony how the
[41:56] lord led me
[41:57] and on the island where we are now we
[42:00] have
[42:01] a few message churches and the message
[42:04] has
[42:05] changed my life and has impacted
[42:08] many people in my head and even i've
[42:10] been allowed by the authorities
[42:12] no church in the in the history of the
[42:15] prisons here
[42:17] no church has ever been allowed inside
[42:20] the prison premises to preach the word
[42:23] i've been given the
[42:24] permission by the prime minister to go
[42:26] in and today in my church there might be
[42:28] about
[42:28] 15 ex-inmates i mean drug dealers
[42:32] notorious drug dealers criminals
[42:36] those who kill people and they're in my
[42:39] church
[42:39] they're living a decent life i'm just
[42:42] talking about the power of the message
[42:44] the power behind the message it's really
[42:47] a powerful message and
[42:50] i like the theme that brother theo has
[42:53] chosen about another ephesians
[42:58] and that code that he put about
[43:03] about redemption
[43:06] has got two parts i like that quote said
[43:09] you must come out of unbelief
[43:11] to be able to enter the world of faith i
[43:14] just thought about the
[43:15] political son he had to come out of his
[43:17] pink pen
[43:18] come home and there
[43:22] many things happened to him the father
[43:25] talk about the role
[43:26] you know the best robe it was like a
[43:29] kind of
[43:29] adoption to put a robe on him
[43:32] and gave him a ring a ring of authority
[43:37] he has taken his position in his
[43:39] father's house
[43:40] as a true son and that's our history
[43:44] and remember when this prodigal son came
[43:46] back home
[43:47] he left all the pigs behind
[43:50] there is no record that bring that he
[43:51] brought a little pig with him you know
[43:53] and
[43:53] that's what we have to do leave
[43:55] everything behind
[43:57] to enter this world of faith to enter
[44:00] this
[44:01] position as a son of god to be adopted
[44:04] to have another ephesians we have to
[44:07] leave everything behind
[44:08] and when he came home he got the best
[44:11] robe the fatted calf
[44:13] the shoes everything was prepared for
[44:15] him as a son
[44:16] even if he stole to himself i'll
[44:19] talk to my father treat me as one of the
[44:22] higher
[44:23] servants but he was his son he left home
[44:25] at his son
[44:27] that never changed his status as his son
[44:31] he was adopted in
[44:34] the house of his father as his son and
[44:37] just remember the privileges that he had
[44:39] being adopted that was his ephesians for
[44:42] him
[44:45] i don't know whether i have already
[44:48] gone my my my seven my ten minutes but
[44:52] praise god god bless you i thank brother

[50:51] greeting
[50:53] and then we'll go into the word after
[50:57] [Music]
[51:01] so yeah i just want to agree
[51:04] rather than the lord and
[51:07] just for this opportunity and privilege
[51:09] to to stand here
[51:14] i'm standing here on behalf of our
[51:16] pastor
[51:18] pastor raymond thompson and
[51:22] to to greet the convention with the
[51:24] virtual convention
[51:26] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[51:32] and we just want to thank the
[51:36] lord for this inspiration that brother
[51:38] theo's got
[51:40] and uh you know thank him for for uh
[51:45] you know just i think from my side maybe
[51:48] you know for all the years that he's put
[51:50] up these conventions
[51:52] the last a couple of times they had to
[51:54] be virtual since
[51:56] the old covert pandemic and it was such
[51:59] a blessing
[52:00] i had the privilege to travel with my
[52:02] dad like two occasions
[52:04] at headstone to experience those kind of
[52:07] conventions
[52:09] and it was always a blessing and we want
[52:11] to thank god even for the headstone
[52:13] ministry
[52:14] brother iva brother isaac anthony
[52:17] brother stephen
[52:18] various ministers day we want to
[52:19] appreciate the ministry of edston
[52:22] tabernacle as well
[52:24] and also
[52:28] just a greeting again on behalf of the
[52:30] pastor to all the ministering brethren
[52:32] that we'll be ministering and the
[52:33] ministers that will be
[52:35] greeting as well we just want to thank
[52:37] god for you and for your ministries
[52:39] and the blessing that it's been to the
[52:40] pride across the world
[52:43] so uh i'm standing here again like i
[52:46] said on behalf of the pastor
[52:49] as a church and as a family we wanted to
[52:51] you know
[52:52] give him that time uh
[52:55] just to mourn our mom we
[52:59] lost a little bit over a month now the
[53:01] church has lost
[53:05] the pastor's wife as well and uh
[53:09] so i'm just here standing in on his
[53:10] behalf
[53:13] and uh i felt when i was when when he
[53:15] spoke to me about it it was like uh
[53:19] i don't know if i can do it but you know
[53:22] i was thinking to myself
[53:23] the one thing that we should be doing is
[53:25] really just to hold up his arms in these
[53:27] times
[53:29] and the scripture says that you know the
[53:31] lord is lie
[53:32] to them that of a broken heart and a
[53:34] contrite spirit
[53:36] and so we believe the lord will give him
[53:38] the strength and
[53:39] very soon we're going to see him in the
[53:41] pulpit again
[53:43] so the message that i've got is
[53:47] a little bit from a different angle i
[53:49] know brother theo's
[53:51] inspiration is the dispensation of
[53:54] another ephesians so i really wanted to
[53:56] just bring it in from a different angle
[53:58] but not
[53:59] you know go into anything specifically
[54:01] or anything deep but really just to
[54:03] bring it
[54:04] as an exaltation so it's a message of
[54:06] exaltation
[54:08] we had these mighty men that's been
[54:10] preaching for years and years and i'm
[54:12] talking about 20 30
[54:13] 40 plus years uh that they've been
[54:16] preaching this inspiration
[54:18] so there's nothing new that we can come
[54:20] you know we had a vindicated word from
[54:21] the prophet
[54:23] so i'm here this today really just to
[54:26] exalt you and i trust and i believe that
[54:29] it will be a blessing
[54:31] to the bride across the world
[54:34] so let's stand to our feet let's just go
[54:36] into the scripture reading amen
[54:43] i've got two portions of scripture
[54:48] the first one is in ephesians 1.
[54:52] we'll read from verse 3 to 8
[54:55] and then ephesians 3 from verses 1 to 7.
[55:10] if you found the first scripture
[55:15] from verses 3 ephesians 1
[55:18] it reads blessed be the god and father
[55:21] of our lord jesus christ
[55:23] who have blessed us with all spiritual
[55:25] blessings in heavenly places in christ
[55:28] according as he hath chosen us in him
[55:31] before the foundation of the world that
[55:34] we should be holy
[55:36] and without blame before him in love
[55:39] having predestinated us unto the
[55:41] adoption of children by jesus christ to
[55:43] himself
[55:44] according to the good pleasure of his
[55:46] will
[55:48] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[55:50] when he hath made us accepted in the
[55:53] beloved
[55:55] in whom we have redemption through his
[55:57] blood
[55:58] the forgiveness of sins according to the
[56:00] riches of
[56:01] his grace we're in here the bounded
[56:05] toward us in all wisdom
[56:07] and prudence
[56:11] ephesians 3
[56:18] and we'll read from verses 1
[56:22] for this cause i paul the prison of
[56:24] jesus christ for you gentiles
[56:27] if ye have heard of the dispensation
[56:30] of the grace of god which has given me
[56:33] to you would how that
[56:36] my by revelation he made known unto me
[56:40] the mystery as i wrote before
[56:43] in few words whereby when he
[56:46] read you may understand my knowledge in
[56:49] the mystery of christ
[56:51] which in other ages was not made known
[56:53] unto the sons of men
[56:55] as it is now revealed unto his holy
[56:57] apostles
[56:58] and prophets by the spirit
[57:01] that the gentiles should be fellow is
[57:04] and of the same body
[57:06] and partakers of his promise in christ
[57:08] by the gospel
[57:10] wherever i was made a minister according
[57:12] to the gift of the grace of god
[57:14] given unto me by the effectual working
[57:16] of his power
[57:18] the lord add a blessing to the reading
[57:21] of his word let us bow our heads
[57:24] gracious eternal father we just want to
[57:27] thank you lord for this opportunity that
[57:28] we have to be found in your presence
[57:31] and lord we thank you father god just
[57:33] that we
[57:34] lord and realizing rather that it's not
[57:36] by our own efforts but it's by your
[57:38] grace
[57:39] and we pray father god jesus really just
[57:41] this word of exaltation that it may be a
[57:43] blessing to your people
[57:45] i pray father god jesus wherever it will
[57:47] be listen to over the livestream
[57:50] i pray father god jesus may you go lord
[57:52] and quicken the word to your
[57:54] children's hearts so father god i pray
[57:56] lord for the reading of the word as well
[57:58] may you bless it father god
[57:59] as we believe it's a vindicated word and
[58:02] we thank you father god jesus
[58:03] in jesus name amen amen you may be
[58:06] seated
[58:16] amen i'm not going to roll up my sleeves
[58:21] like the pasta would brother luke showed
[58:25] me there you must
[58:26] be able to shoot like fire
[58:29] so only the pastor can do that
[58:33] when he rolls up his sleeves you must be
[58:35] able to fire like he can
[58:37] so i'm not even gonna try that
[58:42] so just the title for today
[58:45] grace in the dispensation of another
[58:48] ephesians
[58:50] an inspiration possessing the holy ghost
[58:52] land
[58:54] and a subject we shall overcome
[58:59] amen grace in the dispensation of
[59:03] another ephesians
[59:05] and if we listen if we take it from the
[59:07] ephesians 3 that we just read
[59:10] paul identifies that ephesians
[59:14] as the dispensation of the grace of god
[59:18] now the prophet spoke to us and he said
[59:19] that there has to come another ephesians
[59:22] to this journey and if that first
[59:24] ephesians was a dispensation of grace
[59:27] then this ephesians will be
[59:30] another dispensation of grace to you and
[59:33] i yeah
[59:34] and that's what i wanted to take this
[59:36] morning and rather i wanted to use
[59:38] and take grace as the underlying theme
[59:41] for the sermon
[59:45] and if we look at grace what does grace
[59:46] mean
[59:48] it means unmerited favor
[59:51] in other words you didn't do anything to
[59:53] deserve it
[59:55] but you received it the prophet preaches
[59:58] a message where he says god
[1:00:00] who is rich in mercy he's the god who is
[1:00:03] rich in mercy and if we look at
[1:00:05] god and if we look at the grace of god
[1:00:08] we understand and we look at
[1:00:10] every action of god to you and i or
[1:00:13] towards you and i
[1:00:15] is by grace so in other words when he
[1:00:18] created his creation we need
[1:00:20] his providence towards you your
[1:00:22] salvation
[1:00:23] your future your destiny is all by the
[1:00:26] grace of god
[1:00:28] [Applause]
[1:00:34] john 3 16 for god so loved the world
[1:00:39] that he gave his only begotten son
[1:00:42] now we can turn around and say what did
[1:00:43] the world do to deserve his love
[1:00:46] what did you do to deserve his love
[1:00:50] and if we look at it you you come to the
[1:00:52] realization and you realize that
[1:00:54] god's love gives on grace terms
[1:00:59] and i want you just to follow me with
[1:01:00] this we're going to place it
[1:01:02] all away from the beginning of time in
[1:01:05] fact you can go
[1:01:06] back to the before the foundation of the
[1:01:07] world when he chose you in his mind
[1:01:10] that was god's grace to you
[1:01:17] in a message earnestly containing for
[1:01:18] the faith the prophet speaks there on
[1:01:20] jude
[1:01:21] and how that he was encouraging the
[1:01:23] saints not to to to to
[1:01:25] lose this so earnestly content for this
[1:01:28] faith
[1:01:29] and he speaks in a message and he refers
[1:01:30] to ephesians in paul
[1:01:32] the prophet says in that message paul
[1:01:34] was fixing
[1:01:36] to speak of grace through redemption
[1:01:39] he was fixing to speak of grace through
[1:01:41] god's election
[1:01:42] when he was addressing the letter to the
[1:01:45] ephesians church
[1:01:47] and the church was made up of
[1:01:49] individuals that made up the body
[1:01:51] of christ for that age and as we
[1:01:54] understand the dispensation is a
[1:01:56] divinely appointed
[1:01:57] age
[1:02:00] and when paul addresses it to that age
[1:02:03] he's addressing the body of christ
[1:02:07] and he speaks in ephesians of three how
[1:02:09] he received this great
[1:02:11] mystery of god so in other words paul
[1:02:13] received this great revelation
[1:02:15] of who jesus was and when he received
[1:02:18] this revelation why did paul come to the
[1:02:20] conclusion that
[1:02:21] this jesus was jehovah of the old
[1:02:25] testament
[1:02:26] so this revelation came through and he
[1:02:29] realized and the prophet says it was by
[1:02:31] grace
[1:02:32] that it was shown to paul and this
[1:02:35] big man of this threefold purpose of god
[1:02:38] was unfolded to paul and what did paul
[1:02:42] come to the realization by a revelation
[1:02:44] that god was manifested in christ christ
[1:02:47] wants to be manifested in his church
[1:02:50] from the day of pentecost and he says
[1:02:52] for that third step was in order to
[1:02:54] redeem
[1:02:56] lost eve back to our original condition
[1:03:02] and so that revelation came in that
[1:03:04] first church age
[1:03:06] in communion the prophet speaks about
[1:03:08] grace he says you know how five is the
[1:03:10] number of grace
[1:03:12] and he says in that message he says if
[1:03:14] god ever
[1:03:16] sends his power again to the church
[1:03:19] he says it will be by his grace in other
[1:03:22] words it won't be by the obedience of
[1:03:24] any man
[1:03:25] no obedience of any man it will be
[1:03:27] nothing that you and i will do
[1:03:29] but if he sends his dynamics power in
[1:03:32] this dispensation
[1:03:33] it will be because of the grace of god
[1:03:37] it won't be because of you and my
[1:03:39] obedience or what we will do
[1:03:42] to deserve this
[1:03:45] now let's trace this grace
[1:03:50] grace we can trace from
[1:03:53] the foundation of the world we can run
[1:03:56] it all the way through genesis you can
[1:03:58] run it through
[1:03:59] to the church ages you can run it right
[1:04:00] into revelation
[1:04:04] and the prophet in oneness he paints
[1:04:05] this picture
[1:04:07] he says how this great god of eternity
[1:04:10] that covered all of space and time
[1:04:12] he says he wanted to make himself known
[1:04:16] he wanted to become material he says in
[1:04:19] the very first step of him becoming
[1:04:21] material was
[1:04:22] genesis 1 26 let us make man
[1:04:26] in our own image
[1:04:29] and eventually he puts this man into
[1:04:31] material into a body of clay
[1:04:34] the prophet says and this was the father
[1:04:38] and he had this fellowship he had this
[1:04:41] oneness
[1:04:42] with his family which was adam and eve
[1:04:46] and he says and they had this oneness
[1:04:49] and this fellowship
[1:04:50] with the father the prophet says how
[1:04:53] because they had his nature they had the
[1:04:56] very nature of god
[1:04:57] in them and the prophet in oneness
[1:05:01] continues to paint this picture he says
[1:05:02] out death
[1:05:04] he says there was no death there was no
[1:05:07] heartaches
[1:05:08] there was no sorrow he says there was no
[1:05:11] sickness
[1:05:12] he says there was no heartache
[1:05:16] he says oh what a beautiful picture this
[1:05:18] must have been
[1:05:20] and when satan came in and disrupted
[1:05:23] this entire program of this
[1:05:25] existence of mankind
[1:05:29] when god himself then had come into in
[1:05:31] into
[1:05:32] to a body of flesh you are he came in
[1:05:34] the volume of the book
[1:05:36] the prophet says there in john 17 11
[1:05:38] when he prayed to the father he said
[1:05:40] father i want that same oneness
[1:05:43] that you and i now have with my church
[1:05:47] so in other words when he came in the
[1:05:49] body of flesh he demonstrated
[1:05:51] what adam and eve had and he said and he
[1:05:54] prophesied
[1:05:55] and he prayed that i want the same
[1:05:58] oneness
[1:05:59] with my body so when they had it in the
[1:06:02] in
[1:06:03] in pentecost you're gonna have it that
[1:06:05] oneness will have to be
[1:06:07] amen under this dispensation
[1:06:12] in one as the prophet turns around and
[1:06:13] he says and at that day you will know
[1:06:16] that i am in the father the father is in
[1:06:19] me and i
[1:06:20] in you amen and that will be the oneness
[1:06:23] restored
[1:06:27] in that first church they demonstrated
[1:06:29] that oneness
[1:06:31] and if we are living in another
[1:06:32] dispensation of that
[1:06:34] it will be by grace he says but the
[1:06:37] prophet turns around and he says but the
[1:06:38] church needs to realize
[1:06:40] who she is in other words you need to
[1:06:43] realize what your position is
[1:06:45] you need to get into your position he
[1:06:48] says turns around and he says and when
[1:06:50] that happens
[1:06:51] that prayer of john 17 11 will be
[1:06:54] answered once more
[1:06:56] in this day and age let's give the lord
[1:06:59] and praise
[1:07:14] now let's let's continue to look at
[1:07:16] grace
[1:07:17] the prophet's preachers he preached a
[1:07:19] message called the message of grace
[1:07:22] and in that message he says this you
[1:07:24] know that grace is old
[1:07:26] he says grace is as old as the world is
[1:07:30] he says and grace was first introduced
[1:07:33] to the human race
[1:07:35] when the human race was first created in
[1:07:37] the garden of eden
[1:07:40] he says then then he paints the picture
[1:07:42] he says on that dark
[1:07:44] morning when that little woman stepped
[1:07:48] across the dividing line
[1:07:51] she caused the husband also to step
[1:07:53] across that dividing line because
[1:07:55] the law was given that at that day that
[1:07:59] you eat there off
[1:08:01] that very day you're going to die
[1:08:05] and the prophet in that message he says
[1:08:07] now remember that first judgment seat
[1:08:09] was on the earth in the garden of eden
[1:08:12] and that judgment
[1:08:13] and the last judgment seat will also be
[1:08:16] on the earth in the end time
[1:08:21] so they realize that they had sinned
[1:08:24] they realized that they were naked and
[1:08:27] they eat
[1:08:28] from the presence of god
[1:08:31] now if you think about it why did they
[1:08:33] hide obviously because they realized
[1:08:35] that they were naked
[1:08:36] but they also realized that there was a
[1:08:38] penalty attached to the law
[1:08:41] so in other words the days that you eat
[1:08:43] there if you die
[1:08:45] but they were not yet introduced the way
[1:08:48] the prophet says it in that message
[1:08:50] to grace they were not aware of what
[1:08:54] grace will do for them
[1:08:57] he says and there they stood this couple
[1:09:00] they stood there condemned
[1:09:04] there would be no more human race from
[1:09:06] that time on
[1:09:07] now remember they didn't know about
[1:09:09] grace yet but as far as they
[1:09:12] knew because of the law that there would
[1:09:15] be no more human race
[1:09:17] why because there was a requirement for
[1:09:19] death
[1:09:21] the prophet says it was the darkest hour
[1:09:24] in their lives
[1:09:26] he says it seemed like all hope was gone
[1:09:30] but all of a sudden grace came pouring
[1:09:33] through
[1:09:41] grace said i'll give you a savior
[1:09:44] the prophet says oh god's amazing grace
[1:09:47] in the garden of eden
[1:09:51] he says i'll give you a savior and that
[1:09:52] very god that had put down the law
[1:09:55] was the same one that slew a lamb under
[1:09:58] the shadow of redemption
[1:10:00] for their sake he says grace
[1:10:04] gave them a promise at that same time
[1:10:08] that there was going to be a just one
[1:10:10] that was to come
[1:10:11] and he would come through the woman and
[1:10:13] you see that woman's seed
[1:10:15] will be the one that will brew satan's
[1:10:17] head
[1:10:20] now even though they had to leave the
[1:10:21] garden of eden
[1:10:23] grace provided them a redemption plan
[1:10:27] [Applause]
[1:10:29] and as we look at this picture we
[1:10:30] realize and we see how this plan is
[1:10:32] going to play itself
[1:10:34] out through the ages through the various
[1:10:37] dispensations of time
[1:10:40] because now they had to live immortal
[1:10:41] life and they were eventually gonna die
[1:10:44] immortal's death
[1:10:46] but grace provided him this plan that
[1:10:49] from dispensation to dispensation
[1:10:52] grace is gonna be following this
[1:10:54] redemption plan
[1:10:58] and he says now now look at what grace
[1:11:01] did for them
[1:11:02] because grace showed him this plan then
[1:11:05] it will play itself
[1:11:06] out through the ages and it will play
[1:11:09] itself
[1:11:09] out up until the dispensation
[1:11:13] of the fullness of time now the prophet
[1:11:16] says what is the dispensation of the
[1:11:18] fullness of time
[1:11:19] he says when death is no more when
[1:11:22] sickness is no more
[1:11:24] when heartaches is no more why because
[1:11:26] in the fullness of time
[1:11:28] he brings and he draws all of this up
[1:11:31] into himself
[1:11:33] at the fullness of time or the
[1:11:35] dispensation of the fullness of time
[1:11:36] now brother and sister to you and i
[1:11:38] isn't it glorious
[1:11:40] and in that message the prophet says
[1:11:42] god's amazing grace to look at this
[1:11:44] step back and look at it and marvel and
[1:11:47] see
[1:11:48] how it plays itself out through the ages
[1:11:52] so what i want to do this morning like i
[1:11:53] said it's really just a message of
[1:11:54] exaltation
[1:11:55] let's follow it through the ages
[1:11:58] [Applause]
[1:12:06] the prophet says in message of grace he
[1:12:08] says god's grace is sovereign
[1:12:11] and for you and i in layman's term
[1:12:12] sovereign means i don't have to ask your
[1:12:14] permission
[1:12:15] to do it in other words he does what he
[1:12:19] wants to do
[1:12:20] he didn't need satan's permission he
[1:12:22] didn't need lucifer's permission
[1:12:24] when he decided to save you when he
[1:12:26] decided to save me
[1:12:28] he didn't ask the angel's permission do
[1:12:30] you think that i should save thomas
[1:12:32] blaikis
[1:12:32] in this age in this dispensation
[1:12:36] he is sovereign he chose you and i
[1:12:39] before the foundation of the world
[1:12:41] [Applause]
[1:12:42] why because of his sovereign grace and
[1:12:45] as the scripture
[1:12:46] says he chose you in him
[1:12:49] and the prophet says in that message he
[1:12:51] says that's the reason why
[1:12:52] he could save the violence i can turn
[1:12:55] around it says no
[1:12:56] god but thomas practice is the worst yes
[1:12:59] he doesn't need my permission he never
[1:13:01] did need my permission
[1:13:03] why because he's sovereign and that's
[1:13:05] the reason why he chose you
[1:13:07] and when he chose you he elected you
[1:13:09] before the foundation of the world
[1:13:11] and because he elected you he called you
[1:13:14] at dispensation at this dispensation
[1:13:17] of grace and that's the reason why you
[1:13:19] and i are now
[1:13:20] under dispensation of grace in this
[1:13:24] ephesians give the lord and praise amen
[1:13:35] in adoption 3 he says i needed saving i
[1:13:38] could do nothing to save myself
[1:13:40] in other words you and i could do
[1:13:42] nothing because of the way we came into
[1:13:45] this world he says we came into this
[1:13:47] world speaking lies
[1:13:48] with our pacts turned to him you aired
[1:13:50] no hope
[1:13:52] you had no hope the prophet in adoption
[1:13:54] 3 he turns around and he says
[1:13:55] but god who for knew you
[1:14:00] did he fall know me he knew me before
[1:14:01] the foundation of the world
[1:14:03] and because he knew me before the
[1:14:05] funding he predestinated me
[1:14:07] and and because he predestinated you now
[1:14:10] now he's going to call you
[1:14:11] in your decreed season in your age in
[1:14:14] your dispensation
[1:14:16] and to those who is called is justified
[1:14:19] and to them who is justified is
[1:14:21] glorified
[1:14:22] [Applause]
[1:14:23] now turn back and the scripture says it
[1:14:25] this way now brothers and sisters
[1:14:28] what shall we say to these things
[1:14:31] [Applause]
[1:14:32] if god is for us who can be against you
[1:14:36] who can be against you if god is before
[1:14:39] you his providence
[1:14:40] his election his foreknowledge his
[1:14:43] predestination of you and i
[1:14:46] what shall we say to these things what
[1:14:49] shall we say to these things
[1:14:51] it's grace from before the foundation of
[1:14:52] the world all the way into your
[1:14:54] dispensation
[1:14:56] all the way into your age and god this
[1:14:58] is our god
[1:15:00] brings it to us
[1:15:08] my my
[1:15:16] the prophet says i was a cockapoo but
[1:15:18] all of a sudden i'm a weak grain
[1:15:20] how did that happen he says what is that
[1:15:23] he says that's his election
[1:15:26] and now i'm saved and now i'm walking in
[1:15:30] the grace of god
[1:15:31] the prophet says why because of your
[1:15:33] predestination and that's the reason why
[1:15:35] like the pastor had preached
[1:15:36] in the past predestination looks back to
[1:15:38] your full knowledge
[1:15:41] and he says for knowledge looks to your
[1:15:42] destiny now what is your destiny
[1:15:45] the adoption of sons and daughters of
[1:15:47] god that is your destiny
[1:15:50] and that's the reason why jesus christ
[1:15:52] when he spoke to his church he said
[1:15:54] don't rejoice because devils are subject
[1:15:56] to you rejoice because your names are
[1:15:59] written
[1:16:00] in heaven because your names are written
[1:16:03] in glory
[1:16:03] now again what did you and i do for that
[1:16:07] nothing nothing but god sovereign grace
[1:16:10] that he put your name on the lam's book
[1:16:12] of life
[1:16:14] and it's for that reason that peter was
[1:16:17] found in the upper room because he knew
[1:16:19] there was a promise
[1:16:20] of a dynamics and power coming in his
[1:16:23] state
[1:16:24] in his backslidden state in his fallen
[1:16:26] state he felt like he
[1:16:28] he failed god but he was predestinated
[1:16:32] to receive that dynamics and power
[1:16:34] [Applause]
[1:16:41] let's move on to abraham because we're
[1:16:43] following and we're running with this
[1:16:44] grace
[1:16:45] the prophet comes to abram in the
[1:16:46] message of grace he says you know that
[1:16:48] abram was no special man
[1:16:50] he come down from the tower of babel
[1:16:54] in fact he came from a family of
[1:16:56] idolaters
[1:16:58] and if you look at it historically his
[1:17:00] father was in fact the one that used to
[1:17:01] mold and
[1:17:03] fashioned idols in babel now the prophet
[1:17:06] in that message turns around and he says
[1:17:08] god called him from that
[1:17:09] he says that was god's grace he says it
[1:17:13] was not because he was a different man
[1:17:14] but it was
[1:17:15] all because he was a better man he says
[1:17:17] but it was the grace of god that called
[1:17:19] you
[1:17:21] he says and abram was saved by faith
[1:17:23] which is grace
[1:17:25] god saved him and it was not because of
[1:17:27] his behavior so abram could have been a
[1:17:30] good
[1:17:31] a good man a good self but it was not
[1:17:34] because of the behavior
[1:17:36] that he was called he was given a
[1:17:38] promise
[1:17:40] and the promise the prophet says that
[1:17:42] promise was altogether grace
[1:17:44] in other words it had no law mixed in
[1:17:46] with it
[1:17:48] and that shows you how determined god
[1:17:50] was to save that man
[1:17:52] or to save mankind he says he
[1:17:55] you are so determined to save him that
[1:17:57] he even made a covenant with himself
[1:18:01] in other words it was not like in the
[1:18:03] beginning the day that you eat there
[1:18:05] that day you die in other words
[1:18:06] if you do this i will do that he says no
[1:18:09] he made a covenant with himself but he
[1:18:10] made that man the beneficiary of that
[1:18:12] covenant
[1:18:15] so i'm going to swear by myself but
[1:18:16] you're going to be the beneficiary
[1:18:18] of this covenant and today because you
[1:18:22] and i are the
[1:18:23] abraham's royal seed you and i are the
[1:18:26] beneficiaries
[1:18:27] of that covenant
[1:18:29] [Applause]
[1:18:36] now as we move on let's get to
[1:18:38] redemption
[1:18:39] in a paradox the prophet preaches this
[1:18:41] and he says how joshua
[1:18:43] was the book of redemption of the old
[1:18:44] testament and we know that redemption is
[1:18:46] in two parts
[1:18:48] coming out of and going into
[1:18:51] he says moses represented the law which
[1:18:53] was brought and brought them out of
[1:18:55] egypt
[1:18:56] but joshua represented the grace that
[1:18:59] took them into the promised land
[1:19:02] and in paradox i'm going to read this
[1:19:05] quote this is really where i got the
[1:19:07] call it the theme of grace
[1:19:11] and we see as time played out or the
[1:19:13] ages played out abram was given a
[1:19:15] promise by god in other words
[1:19:16] this is your inheritance as far as your
[1:19:19] eye can see
[1:19:20] north south east west i give this land
[1:19:22] to you
[1:19:24] but your seed will so journey in a
[1:19:27] strange land
[1:19:29] but i the lord god will bring them out
[1:19:31] with a mighty end
[1:19:33] and in this message paradox he says this
[1:19:36] they started out really with grace to
[1:19:39] begin with
[1:19:41] before they had law they had grace while
[1:19:44] they were in egypt without the law
[1:19:46] no one was down there it was just
[1:19:49] priests and so forth
[1:19:50] but they didn't have any laws the law
[1:19:53] had not yet been given
[1:19:56] through moses but grace provided them
[1:19:59] a prophet so they were crying out for a
[1:20:02] prophet for this mighty deliverer
[1:20:04] the prophet says but grace provided them
[1:20:06] with that prophet
[1:20:08] he says grace also provided them with an
[1:20:10] atonement
[1:20:12] a sacrificial lamb that would bring them
[1:20:14] out
[1:20:15] and that atonement had been provided
[1:20:17] before there was
[1:20:18] any law then he makes this statement and
[1:20:22] this is where i got the inspiration from
[1:20:24] he says grace was before law
[1:20:28] it was during the law and it is after
[1:20:30] the law
[1:20:33] and this is where i got it from
[1:20:34] [Applause]
[1:20:37] and so we tracing them now they come out
[1:20:40] moses leads them out of egypt with a
[1:20:42] mighty end of deliverance
[1:20:44] the prophet says and took them through
[1:20:47] the red sea
[1:20:48] mighty miracles that they've seen
[1:20:52] he says and yet they came to a state in
[1:20:54] the wilderness where they used to they
[1:20:55] murmured and complained
[1:20:59] and the prophet says but there's a
[1:21:01] reason why he let them one day in the
[1:21:03] wilderness for so long
[1:21:05] he says because the promise of canaan or
[1:21:07] the promise of that
[1:21:10] inheritance was not to that generation
[1:21:13] but he needed that generation to bring
[1:21:15] forth
[1:21:17] the seed that it was from the promise
[1:21:18] was meant for
[1:21:21] and if you look at it only two from the
[1:21:23] original that came out had gone into the
[1:21:24] land in other words possessed the land
[1:21:27] but he was waiting for the joshua
[1:21:29] generation to come forth
[1:21:31] because he knew that they were
[1:21:33] overcomers they knew that they were
[1:21:35] believers
[1:21:38] and that's the reason why the prophet
[1:21:40] says he needed them to bring forth that
[1:21:54] seat
[1:22:00] now let's let's come all the way down to
[1:22:02] jesus christ
[1:22:04] the royal seed of abraham this was now
[1:22:07] he was born he was the promised one that
[1:22:11] was to come
[1:22:12] the woman's seed the
[1:22:15] audition church age the prophet says
[1:22:18] he is standing now in the midst of the
[1:22:20] church talking about
[1:22:21] christ standing in the midst of walking
[1:22:23] through the midst of the candlesticks
[1:22:27] and he says he stands there revealing
[1:22:29] who he is in this last age
[1:22:31] he calls himself the author of the
[1:22:33] creation of god
[1:22:35] this is another creation
[1:22:40] this has to do with the church this is a
[1:22:42] special designation of himself
[1:22:45] he is the creator of this church the
[1:22:48] heavenly bridegroom who created his own
[1:22:50] bride as the spirit of god he came
[1:22:52] down and he created in the virgin mary
[1:22:54] the cells from which
[1:22:56] his body was born he was this new
[1:22:59] creation
[1:23:00] man and god had met and joined he was
[1:23:02] the first of this new race
[1:23:05] he is the head of this new race
[1:23:07] colossians 1
[1:23:08] 18 and he is the head of the body the
[1:23:11] church who is the beginning
[1:23:12] the firstborn from the dead and in all
[1:23:15] things he might have the preeminence
[1:23:19] second corinthians therefore if any man
[1:23:21] be in christ he's a new creation
[1:23:24] all the old things have passed away
[1:23:26] behold all things
[1:23:27] has become new a new creation
[1:23:31] now so no longer is he dealing by the
[1:23:33] ways of the flesh now
[1:23:35] but now out of every kindred tribe and
[1:23:37] nation he has purposed
[1:23:39] a new creation he is the first
[1:23:42] of that creation now by his spirit
[1:23:46] he is creating many sons unto himself
[1:23:50] he says god the creator creating himself
[1:23:54] a part of his creation the prophet turns
[1:23:57] around and he says this
[1:23:58] is the true revelation of god
[1:24:02] this was his purpose and this purpose
[1:24:05] took form through election
[1:24:08] by his own decree elected the members of
[1:24:10] this new creation
[1:24:12] he predestinated them to the adoption of
[1:24:14] children
[1:24:16] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:24:18] will
[1:24:19] [Music]
[1:24:20] and there you see his sovereignty again
[1:24:23] in oneness now the prophet turns around
[1:24:25] and he says your debt is paid
[1:24:27] yes he says hallelujah to the lamb
[1:24:30] your death is paid every man and woman
[1:24:32] hearing me this morning and he says
[1:24:34] end to you that's hearing me by tape
[1:24:38] your penalty is speech
[1:24:42] he turns around in that message he says
[1:24:44] don't disbelieve god
[1:24:46] or believe disbelieve his word ever
[1:24:48] again
[1:24:50] when the word died in my place he was
[1:24:51] resurrected again
[1:24:53] he become preeminent in my life
[1:24:57] in my heart he says and and the prophet
[1:25:00] says it's over
[1:25:02] when was it over the day that he cried
[1:25:04] out with a loud voice and said
[1:25:06] it is finished so he done it
[1:25:10] hebrews 10 12 but this man after he had
[1:25:13] offered one sacrifice
[1:25:15] for sins forever sat down at the right
[1:25:18] hand of god the father
[1:25:20] and because of this offering he has
[1:25:23] perfected
[1:25:24] forever them that are sanctified and we
[1:25:27] give god praise and glory and honor
[1:25:30] and we thank him again for his marvelous
[1:25:34] grace
[1:25:35] toward you and i
[1:25:42] [Applause]
[1:25:46] adoption moses being a type of christ
[1:25:50] led the children all the way up to the
[1:25:52] promised land
[1:25:53] but joshua took them in divided up the
[1:25:55] land
[1:25:57] and gave them the inheritance
[1:26:00] jesus paid the price but led you all the
[1:26:02] way up to the holy spirit
[1:26:05] it says but it's god's holy spirit that
[1:26:07] will positionally
[1:26:08] place you into the body
[1:26:13] and therefore when you look at adoption
[1:26:14] you realize that adoption is not your
[1:26:16] birth
[1:26:17] because the sun is the sun he says but
[1:26:20] your adoption is your blessing
[1:26:23] the prophet turns around in adoption too
[1:26:25] he says i'm trying to get this to you
[1:26:27] sons of this last day
[1:26:29] in other words you sons of this
[1:26:31] dispensation
[1:26:33] he says that you were predestinated unto
[1:26:36] adoption
[1:26:37] in other words you were predestinated
[1:26:38] into a blessing now what is your
[1:26:40] pleasing it's to be sons and daughters
[1:26:41] of god
[1:26:43] with authority so that's your
[1:26:46] inheritance
[1:26:48] that's your sonship the prophet says
[1:26:50] that's your dominion that's the dominion
[1:26:51] restored
[1:26:54] and so that's the reason why jesus
[1:26:56] christ was raped raised from the dead
[1:26:58] and his spirit is now dwelling in spirit
[1:27:00] form
[1:27:01] in his church
[1:27:04] in other words he's given his church all
[1:27:06] of the powers the prophet says
[1:27:08] and the authority then he turns around
[1:27:11] the prophet turns around in that message
[1:27:13] he says but why are you afraid
[1:27:15] to move
[1:27:19] he says have you really crossed jordan
[1:27:22] in other words have you and i to make
[1:27:25] this come to life in our dispensation
[1:27:28] have we died out to ourselves have we
[1:27:30] died out to our own thinking our own
[1:27:32] abilities
[1:27:34] and let god step forward the prophet
[1:27:36] says you can walk
[1:27:38] walk hand in hand with him
[1:27:42] in the fellowship what will it be it
[1:27:44] will be christ in you
[1:27:46] the hope of glory he says it's the god
[1:27:49] holy spirit that's going to be moving
[1:27:52] once again immortal flesh
[1:27:56] that's that's the restoration that's the
[1:27:57] reason why he died
[1:27:59] yes and he too in order to him for him
[1:28:01] to send down
[1:28:02] the promise of my father and the prophet
[1:28:05] says it wants to restore that fellowship
[1:28:08] it was to restore that unity it was to
[1:28:10] restore that oneness
[1:28:12] then he turns around but now go possess
[1:28:14] that land
[1:28:15] go possess that holy ghost land
[1:28:28] this great warrior joshua now taking it
[1:28:32] out of the things of the world
[1:28:33] predestinated by god
[1:28:35] called of god elected by god chosen of
[1:28:37] god saved by god
[1:28:39] baptized into the body of christ by the
[1:28:41] holy spirit and made members of this
[1:28:43] body
[1:28:46] it's alive it's ready it's willing
[1:28:50] the prophet says my shadow will move
[1:28:52] every time anything of my body moves
[1:28:56] and he says and the holy spirit body of
[1:28:58] christ
[1:29:00] will move just as christ moves
[1:29:03] he says and if christ in heaven can get
[1:29:06] this
[1:29:07] spiritual body on the earth moving
[1:29:11] as he wants it to move he turns around
[1:29:14] and he says watch
[1:29:15] for things to happen what things
[1:29:19] is going to happen why because it's
[1:29:20] going to be the same life
[1:29:22] the prophet turns around he says if the
[1:29:24] life of christ is in you you're going to
[1:29:25] do the works
[1:29:27] of christ
[1:29:30] and a little bit further i got it under
[1:29:31] overcomers he says
[1:29:33] when christ himself came in contact with
[1:29:36] sickness he rebuked sickness
[1:29:39] he says when he came into contact with
[1:29:40] death
[1:29:42] he raised from the dead now if he can
[1:29:45] only get that spiritual body to move
[1:29:49] watch what things are going to happen
[1:29:52] [Applause]
[1:29:54] amen
[1:30:00] now in order to possess this holy ghost
[1:30:04] land
[1:30:05] in this dispensation of grace
[1:30:10] we need overcomers
[1:30:14] in adoption one he says canaan did not
[1:30:16] represent the age of the millennium
[1:30:17] because we know there was bloodshed
[1:30:20] but it only represented the age of the
[1:30:23] overcomer
[1:30:25] that was the dispensation of overcoming
[1:30:29] in other words they had to fight to
[1:30:30] possess the land
[1:30:32] they knew it was theirs they knew it was
[1:30:34] the inheritance but they had to fight
[1:30:36] to possess it so that applies then to
[1:30:40] you and i that we have to fight to
[1:30:41] possess this land
[1:30:45] and following the overcomers now he says
[1:30:47] even if you take it through the church
[1:30:48] ages and the dispensations of the church
[1:30:50] ages
[1:30:51] the prophet says this he says that he
[1:30:54] had overcomers in every age
[1:30:58] in other words he always had a witness
[1:30:59] he was never without a witness
[1:31:02] through the church ages then he comes to
[1:31:04] the laudition church age which is this
[1:31:06] a dispensation he says do you know that
[1:31:09] this little decent church age is the
[1:31:10] grandest
[1:31:12] of all the church ages he says why
[1:31:15] because it's the ending of time
[1:31:17] in the blending of eternity
[1:31:23] no wonder the sages and the uh and the
[1:31:25] patriarchs have all wanted to live in
[1:31:27] this age because this
[1:31:29] the prophet says is the grandest of all
[1:31:31] the ages
[1:31:34] yet it's the it's the age with the most
[1:31:36] sin
[1:31:38] he says satan is more powerful in this
[1:31:41] age than he was in any other age
[1:31:44] he says but he's got an elected group of
[1:31:46] people
[1:31:49] he says i've got an elected group of
[1:31:50] overcomers
[1:31:52] for this dispensation and
[1:31:55] here's a group of these overcomers
[1:31:59] and there's a group on on the live
[1:32:01] stream
[1:32:02] you are that elected group of overcomers
[1:32:05] that's gonna overcome this age
[1:32:08] we are living in the grandest age
[1:32:12] the grandest dispensation
[1:32:15] and god has got an elected group of
[1:32:16] overcomers the prophet says
[1:32:19] for this age
[1:32:20] [Applause]
[1:32:23] my my
[1:32:36] adoption four now moses was the type of
[1:32:38] christ he says he led the children
[1:32:40] up to the promised land but joshua took
[1:32:43] them in
[1:32:49] okay i need to move on the other page
[1:32:50] sorry
[1:32:53] now overcome means to stand the test
[1:32:58] the prophet in that message how can i
[1:33:00] overcome he says
[1:33:02] use your greatest example of an
[1:33:04] overcomer
[1:33:06] the lord jesus christ and this is what i
[1:33:08] spoke about earlier
[1:33:09] he says in every face of sickness
[1:33:11] because he was the messiah he healed it
[1:33:14] amen he says when he came into the face
[1:33:16] of death he brought back to life
[1:33:19] he says in the very face of his own
[1:33:21] death he prophesied that you can destroy
[1:33:24] this body
[1:33:25] but i will raise it up again in three
[1:33:26] days
[1:33:28] the prophet turns around and he says now
[1:33:29] there is your example
[1:33:31] of an overcomer how did he do that
[1:33:35] by the word the prophet says why because
[1:33:38] he was the word
[1:33:39] made manifest and that word made
[1:33:42] manifest said to you
[1:33:44] in the scriptures if he abide in me
[1:33:47] and my words abide in you you will ask
[1:33:50] what you will
[1:33:52] in other words he's given you the way
[1:33:54] and he's given you how to overcome it
[1:33:58] greater is he that's in you than ye
[1:34:00] that's in the world
[1:34:02] the prophet says that is how i overcome
[1:34:06] he says it's not me but it's his word
[1:34:08] that's in me
[1:34:09] and if his word is in me then that means
[1:34:11] that the word is god
[1:34:14] and he says that's how i overcome it
[1:34:16] will not be me the prophet says
[1:34:18] yes sir that's how you will overcome
[1:34:23] thank you jesus and then he turns around
[1:34:26] and he says now there's an
[1:34:27] ark yes sir and that ark is not your
[1:34:29] denomination
[1:34:30] yes that ark is not your good works
[1:34:34] but it's by one spirit which is the holy
[1:34:37] spirit according to romans 8 1
[1:34:39] we are all baptized into that body
[1:34:43] into that domain of that kingdom
[1:34:47] by one spiritual baptism the prophet
[1:34:49] says and once you get
[1:34:50] under that shed blood he says then you
[1:34:53] are an overcomer
[1:34:55] he says and what is it you resting and
[1:34:57] god is doing the overcoming
[1:34:59] for you give the lord and the praise for
[1:35:01] that amen
[1:35:02] [Applause]
[1:35:10] you know how can i overcome he says
[1:35:11] surely that joshua and caleb and him
[1:35:14] there was obstacles was great
[1:35:17] he says when the ten spies that came
[1:35:19] back they said that we
[1:35:21] look like grasshoppers they weren't
[1:35:23] lying
[1:35:25] why because they were professing what
[1:35:27] they saw the prophet turns in that
[1:35:29] message he says but joshua and caleb did
[1:35:31] not look at circumstance
[1:35:33] they did not look at what they saw they
[1:35:35] looked at what the word of god said
[1:35:38] what did the word of god say this is
[1:35:40] your land
[1:35:43] this is the land that i give you this is
[1:35:44] what you you you
[1:35:46] you overcome and the prophet says now
[1:35:50] the overcomer takes god
[1:35:52] at his word it does not matter what sign
[1:35:55] says
[1:35:57] and this is we can take it all the way
[1:35:59] back to abram
[1:36:01] but you are 100 years old how are you
[1:36:03] going to be able to conceive
[1:36:05] but abram's taken not at the promises of
[1:36:08] god
[1:36:09] because god said so so you take god at
[1:36:12] his word and that makes you an overcomer
[1:36:14] [Applause]
[1:36:22] we're almost there
[1:36:29] now to be an overcomer means that there
[1:36:31] has to be a reward
[1:36:32] [Music]
[1:36:36] the prophet says in every age there was
[1:36:38] a reward
[1:36:40] promised to the overcomers of that age
[1:36:44] of that dispensation the first church
[1:36:47] aids they were given a promise of the
[1:36:49] crown of life sorry
[1:36:51] of the tree of life the second church
[1:36:53] aids their reward was the crown of life
[1:36:56] the third church age they reward was the
[1:36:59] hidden manner and a white stone
[1:37:01] the fourth church age they reward was
[1:37:03] power and rule over nation over
[1:37:06] of nations and the morning star
[1:37:09] the fifth church age they reward was the
[1:37:12] white raymond and the name on the book
[1:37:14] of life
[1:37:15] the sixth church age was the pulley in
[1:37:17] the house of my father
[1:37:19] the loud nation church age he says the
[1:37:22] one that's the most lukewarm church
[1:37:25] the one that's rich it's increased in
[1:37:27] goods
[1:37:28] it's it's need of nothing but the
[1:37:32] and it's wretched poor blind miserable
[1:37:34] and naked
[1:37:36] and there has to be overcomers in that
[1:37:38] church what is your reward
[1:37:40] the prophet says the for to you the
[1:37:42] overcomer in this i give
[1:37:44] to you to sit with me in my throne
[1:37:48] and that's the overcomers reward
[1:37:52] for this dispensation
[1:37:56] revelations 3 21 says the following he
[1:37:58] says i grant to you
[1:38:00] to sit with me in my throne now in how
[1:38:03] can i overcome the prophet says
[1:38:05] what is the throne if you look at any
[1:38:08] kingdom what is the
[1:38:09] the king's throne the king's throne is
[1:38:11] his domain
[1:38:14] that he governs then he turns around and
[1:38:16] he says now
[1:38:17] your domain is as far as your borders
[1:38:20] will reach
[1:38:22] then he turns around and he says now how
[1:38:24] far does this king's borders reach
[1:38:27] he says from eternity to eternity
[1:38:32] and to you i will grant to sit with me
[1:38:36] in my domain from eternity to eternity
[1:38:41] and that's the overcomers reward for
[1:38:44] this dispensation
[1:38:54] my my
[1:39:02] you know how can i overcome he says do
[1:39:04] you know that the mother of james and
[1:39:05] john
[1:39:06] asked him for that position
[1:39:09] and he says he turns around and he says
[1:39:11] jesus responded to in other words
[1:39:14] that place or that position
[1:39:17] he says the prophet says was not even in
[1:39:19] existence yes
[1:39:22] he says but that position would only be
[1:39:23] granted to them that it was ordained for
[1:39:27] in other words you have a reservation
[1:39:30] in other words that seat is reserved
[1:39:33] only for you
[1:39:35] it could not be given to the mother of
[1:39:37] james and john
[1:39:40] for my one son to sit on my right and
[1:39:42] the other one on your on your left
[1:39:44] it was reserved the prophet turns around
[1:39:46] in that message he says
[1:39:47] there's a predestinated seed waiting out
[1:39:50] yonder
[1:39:52] that this position is reserved for
[1:39:56] and now we are living in that
[1:39:57] dispensation
[1:39:59] we have come all the way now to another
[1:40:01] ephesians
[1:40:02] [Applause]
[1:40:04] and and just as paul had identified it
[1:40:06] it's going to be by god's grace
[1:40:09] that he's going to overcome or he will
[1:40:11] grant it to you to overcome
[1:40:13] so that he can give you that reward
[1:40:17] he turns around and he says she will not
[1:40:19] fail
[1:40:20] and so to you and i is the overcomers of
[1:40:23] this day
[1:40:24] let's press on to the overcomers reward
[1:40:28] why because now we know what our reward
[1:40:30] will be
[1:40:35] and if you're an overcomer you have to
[1:40:37] be a believer
[1:40:40] the prophet says you must take the
[1:40:41] promises of god and you must apply
[1:40:44] he says you must walk in it and you must
[1:40:47] trust god to do it
[1:40:51] take him at his word
[1:40:52] [Applause]
[1:40:56] three kinds of believers he says job was
[1:40:58] a believer
[1:40:59] amen he says through his trials he
[1:41:02] believed
[1:41:03] through his persecutions he believed he
[1:41:05] says in the very face of the death of
[1:41:07] his children he believed why
[1:41:09] because he knew that he was fulfilling
[1:41:11] the requirement and he
[1:41:13] and he was of a sacrifice so in other
[1:41:16] words the prophet says that he did not
[1:41:18] die but he knew that he came by the way
[1:41:20] of the word
[1:41:21] for his day the prophet says and even
[1:41:24] though his children had died
[1:41:26] as sinners he says they were waiting for
[1:41:29] him in glory
[1:41:30] why because job was a believer and he
[1:41:33] was an overcomer in his dispensation
[1:41:36] [Applause]
[1:41:40] he said so the believer believes
[1:41:42] regardless of what it sounds like
[1:41:45] regardless of what anybody else is going
[1:41:47] to say about it
[1:41:48] regardless of how impossible it might
[1:41:51] seem
[1:41:52] the believer believes
[1:41:55] give the lord and praise amen
[1:42:05] now we have to come to another ephesians
[1:42:07] to this journey
[1:42:10] and there was a promise made according
[1:42:11] to revelations 10 7 malachi 4
[1:42:13] 5 luke 17 30 that there has got to come
[1:42:17] an ephesians to this journey now the
[1:42:20] prophet says
[1:42:22] there must come in ephesians that these
[1:42:24] seven-fold mysteries of the word of god
[1:42:26] must be unfolded in this day
[1:42:30] in this audition church age and the
[1:42:32] prophet turns around and he says
[1:42:33] we are here now
[1:42:36] so to you and i the believer believes we
[1:42:39] saw it happening in our age
[1:42:41] we believed it we received that word
[1:42:45] so that we can make it come to pass
[1:42:47] [Applause]
[1:42:53] he says in this great warrior joshua
[1:42:54] when moses sent those 10 spies over
[1:42:57] it was in the time of the harvest he
[1:43:00] says it was the grape time
[1:43:02] and he says that was a type of pentecost
[1:43:04] which was the first fruits
[1:43:07] now pentecost was the gathering in
[1:43:10] of the first harvest and when they they
[1:43:12] was at kedis barney at judgment
[1:43:14] when it was to be determined on whether
[1:43:16] they would go over
[1:43:17] and get the holy spirit or not into the
[1:43:21] land of promise where they promise you
[1:43:23] say
[1:43:24] now he says where they promised you say
[1:43:26] is that the promise
[1:43:27] the prophet says yes peter said repent
[1:43:30] be baptized every one of you in the name
[1:43:32] of the lord jesus christ for the
[1:43:34] remission of your sins
[1:43:35] and you shall receive the gift
[1:43:39] of the holy ghost now that promise was
[1:43:42] given unto you and to your children
[1:43:46] he says and to them that's a far off
[1:43:50] even in chicago and we can say even in
[1:43:51] our lorado park today
[1:43:53] as many as the lord our god shall call
[1:43:57] and we're living now by the evidence of
[1:43:59] this new land
[1:44:00] [Music]
[1:44:02] now in oneness he says now let's take it
[1:44:04] back to the disciples he says the
[1:44:06] disciples was walking with him
[1:44:08] for three and a half years he says they
[1:44:10] were walking hand in hand with jesus
[1:44:13] he says they slept with him they ate
[1:44:15] with him
[1:44:17] he says they watched and watched him do
[1:44:20] the miracles
[1:44:21] he says and yet they did not have it yet
[1:44:24] but for all of that time he says it was
[1:44:27] the son of man seeds that was being sown
[1:44:30] into them and when they received the
[1:44:33] promise
[1:44:35] wait there at the city of jerusalem
[1:44:39] until i send the promise of my father
[1:44:42] and you will be endured with power from
[1:44:44] an eye in other words
[1:44:45] you will send his dynamics power to
[1:44:47] quicken that seed
[1:44:49] to life and to you and i we've been
[1:44:52] living under that day for
[1:44:54] whatever amount of years you've been in
[1:44:55] you've been living
[1:44:57] on that son of man's seed
[1:45:01] and when he turned around and he said as
[1:45:02] my father have sent me so am i
[1:45:04] sending you now and we know how the
[1:45:07] prophet says this he says how did the
[1:45:08] father send him he says the father came
[1:45:10] into him
[1:45:11] and this is how he will send you an eye
[1:45:16] [Applause]
[1:45:19] so acts 4 32 the bible says that they
[1:45:22] were then in one heart in one soul in
[1:45:24] one mind
[1:45:25] the prophet says brother why they had
[1:45:27] been restored back to that original
[1:45:29] again
[1:45:31] and he's referring to the oneness there
[1:45:33] now the prophet says then now
[1:45:35] again you know we can talk about it and
[1:45:37] look at it
[1:45:38] through the ages they received the
[1:45:41] dynamics power for that day
[1:45:44] it's an age that has gone by yet they
[1:45:47] had to die
[1:45:48] immortals death eventually
[1:45:51] now the prophet says this in that
[1:45:53] message he says the only thing that they
[1:45:54] had left to be disposed of
[1:45:57] was an old city and then he turns around
[1:46:00] and he says
[1:46:01] that old body called a city or a temple
[1:46:04] and he's referring to the flesh he says
[1:46:07] that they had lived in the in here
[1:46:09] that had to rot because it has to die
[1:46:11] and corrupt
[1:46:13] he says but in spirit in life
[1:46:16] in purpose in vision and everything
[1:46:19] he says they were one with god
[1:46:26] now that same promise applies to this
[1:46:28] age
[1:46:30] and again i was thinking of it this way
[1:46:31] we might not all be destined to see the
[1:46:33] rapture
[1:46:35] he says but god will send that dynamics
[1:46:37] power
[1:46:38] why because again if you look at it it's
[1:46:40] really just this plan of redemption
[1:46:42] playing itself out
[1:46:45] and it doesn't matter whether we're
[1:46:46] going to die oh you're going to live to
[1:46:48] be able to see this rapture
[1:46:50] god's grace has been following me from
[1:46:52] the foundation of the world
[1:46:54] so he's got this thing planned out
[1:46:58] and all i can do is sit back and say wow
[1:47:01] god's amazing grace to you and i
[1:47:17] adoption for he brings it to the church
[1:47:18] ages it says how we were now called out
[1:47:20] from justification
[1:47:22] sanctification baptism of the holy
[1:47:24] spirit and the prophet says how
[1:47:26] justification
[1:47:28] under luther he says that was a work of
[1:47:30] grace amen
[1:47:32] when he caught the revelation he says
[1:47:35] when wesley
[1:47:36] uh caught the revelation of
[1:47:38] sanctification
[1:47:39] sanctification it was a work of grace
[1:47:41] restoration of the gifts he says the
[1:47:43] baptism of the holy spirit is a work
[1:47:45] of grace and now right into this time
[1:47:49] which is the coming of the headstone he
[1:47:51] says the church has got to be so
[1:47:53] perfectly like christ
[1:47:54] until christ and the church can unite
[1:47:56] together
[1:47:58] by that same spirit he says and if the
[1:48:01] spirit of christ is in you then it makes
[1:48:02] you live the life of christ
[1:48:05] it's gonna make you act the life of
[1:48:06] christ it's gonna make you do the works
[1:48:09] of christ
[1:48:11] he that believeth on me the works that i
[1:48:13] do
[1:48:14] shall you do also that's what jesus said
[1:48:18] the prophet says we got a ministry
[1:48:21] coming
[1:48:22] when he spoke this in in adoption 460 he
[1:48:26] says
[1:48:27] we have a ministry coming that's going
[1:48:29] to be just
[1:48:30] exactly like the life of christ
[1:48:35] and he prophesied that for this
[1:48:37] dispensation
[1:48:40] and you and i are now living in the
[1:48:41] manifestation of this prophecy
[1:48:45] he says what is that ministry going to
[1:48:46] identify
[1:48:48] it's going to identify the coming of the
[1:48:50] lord
[1:48:51] now when he turns around in that in that
[1:48:53] quote he says now god
[1:48:55] and the church is waiting
[1:48:59] for the church to find its position
[1:49:02] they without us cannot be made perfect
[1:49:06] they waiting on you and i to find our
[1:49:08] position
[1:49:10] so that you can manifest that ministry
[1:49:14] and when you manifest that ministry it
[1:49:17] will identify
[1:49:18] the coming of the lord why because she's
[1:49:20] gonna pull on or
[1:49:22] bring on the resurrection and very soon
[1:49:26] once that happened the prophet says it's
[1:49:28] going to be a
[1:49:29] short quick message that's going to
[1:49:30] sweep the world
[1:49:32] 40 days he says what will it be and
[1:49:35] eventually we will start hearing the
[1:49:37] knock on our door
[1:49:38] and that appearing i was reading in the
[1:49:41] scripture and i told abigail
[1:49:42] in a message the prophet says that
[1:49:44] appearing when you see your loved ones
[1:49:46] it will only be specific people
[1:49:50] it's not meant for everyone in other
[1:49:52] words when i
[1:49:53] and when we hear mom knocking on the
[1:49:55] door
[1:49:56] there we're gonna know the resurrection
[1:49:58] is on why because we're gonna see sister
[1:50:00] gale
[1:50:01] in a glorified body once again and we
[1:50:04] will know
[1:50:06] at that day that the coming of the lord
[1:50:08] has come upon us
[1:50:10] but god and the church
[1:50:14] the church by the body that has gone on
[1:50:17] before us
[1:50:18] is waiting for you to find your position
[1:50:22] and so that's the reason why we want to
[1:50:24] press on
[1:50:25] [Applause]
[1:50:27] that's the reason why we want to conquer
[1:50:29] that's the reason why we want to
[1:50:31] take this inheritance amen
[1:50:44] [Applause]
[1:50:50] my
[1:51:00] now the prophet says he's an adopted son
[1:51:02] in his ephesus and he speaks about
[1:51:03] joshua
[1:51:05] he says if you're an overcomer and if
[1:51:06] you're a believer you have to
[1:51:08] speak it so in other words when joshua
[1:51:12] needed more sunlight
[1:51:15] it did not help joshua to think about it
[1:51:20] because a thought will do nothing for
[1:51:24] you
[1:51:25] until you speak it and if you have the
[1:51:28] mind of christ you speak the mind of
[1:51:30] christ
[1:51:31] he says and then it materializes
[1:51:36] it would not have helped joshua on that
[1:51:37] day to think i wonder if i
[1:51:39] have to speak to the son if it will stop
[1:51:45] so he turns around and he says you have
[1:51:47] to speak it
[1:51:48] he says joshua was an adopted son in his
[1:51:51] ephesus
[1:51:53] and when he turned around and he said
[1:51:55] son stand still
[1:51:56] moon hang over agilent he says god was
[1:51:59] almost obligated to
[1:52:01] do it on his behalf why because this was
[1:52:04] an adopted son
[1:52:07] and he was in authority he says god had
[1:52:10] to interrupt his program in other words
[1:52:11] he had to interrupt nature itself
[1:52:14] and give him those extra minutes
[1:52:17] in order for him to to he granted him
[1:52:20] what he spoke
[1:52:23] now the bride has to become the final
[1:52:25] age or rather the final voice
[1:52:27] to the final age
[1:52:30] and if you don't speak it it won't
[1:52:33] happen
[1:52:34] why because you will have the voice of
[1:52:36] god you know she will be
[1:52:38] god's voice she will be god's mouthpiece
[1:52:41] and the way the prophet we know how he
[1:52:42] preaches he said when she speaks it it
[1:52:44] will flash like lightning
[1:52:45] and what she speaks will create itself
[1:52:55] now he says if you look at joshua he
[1:52:57] says god never forsook him
[1:53:00] god never failed him he's done around he
[1:53:04] turns around and he says god will not
[1:53:06] fail you
[1:53:07] god will not forsake you why because he
[1:53:10] promised you that he will be with you
[1:53:12] even in you until the end of time
[1:53:17] [Applause]
[1:53:22] in divine love and sovereign grace
[1:53:27] now in this dispensation of another
[1:53:29] ephesians you and i have to speak it
[1:53:33] like peter and john at the gate of
[1:53:34] beautiful when they said look on us
[1:53:37] silver and gold have i none but what i
[1:53:39] have i give to you
[1:53:41] rise up and walk he says satan didn't
[1:53:44] lift a finger
[1:53:45] that day when three thousand souls came
[1:53:47] to salvation
[1:53:49] he says but as soon as peter and john
[1:53:52] did that he realized now that that very
[1:53:55] same power
[1:53:57] [Music]
[1:53:58] was now in these men so in other words
[1:54:01] when jesus christ was on the earth
[1:54:03] he disrupted satan's kingdom
[1:54:06] by the spoken word and now he realized
[1:54:09] that these
[1:54:10] men has got the same thing so in other
[1:54:11] words they because they
[1:54:13] did the same things they realized that
[1:54:16] they were with jesus
[1:54:19] and now just throwing it to an end now i
[1:54:22] want to bring it to
[1:54:24] our first wave chief
[1:54:28] now if we're living by the evidence of
[1:54:29] the new land there was grapes that was
[1:54:31] brought to us
[1:54:38] to show us what this land is like
[1:54:39] [Applause]
[1:54:43] the prophet speaks about an incident he
[1:54:45] says when he was on the pulpit
[1:54:47] yes sir there was this maniac there that
[1:54:52] shouted insults and the man was going to
[1:54:54] come and hurt him we all know these
[1:54:55] stories right
[1:54:57] the prophet says in in divine love and
[1:55:00] sovereign grace he says
[1:55:02] and he was able to do what he was saying
[1:55:06] he's going to do
[1:55:07] in other words it was this big man that
[1:55:09] was going to break
[1:55:10] your bones and he was coming to threaten
[1:55:13] the prophet itself
[1:55:15] the prophet says and all of a sudden i
[1:55:17] love this man
[1:55:19] why because i was thinking that he could
[1:55:20] be someone's father
[1:55:23] oh and and and he says he loved him
[1:55:26] but this man was was determined to
[1:55:30] to come and uh hurt him and he says the
[1:55:33] prophet turns around in that message he
[1:55:34] says
[1:55:35] but all of a sudden i felt sorry for
[1:55:37] this man
[1:55:38] but he says this and i want to read it
[1:55:40] he says the holy spirit
[1:55:42] begin to speak and as the holy spirit
[1:55:45] spoke
[1:55:46] yes obviously we know how he
[1:55:50] he rebuked the devil in the man he says
[1:55:52] and all of a sudden the man fell across
[1:55:54] my feet
[1:55:55] he says it's it's wonderful to see what
[1:55:57] god can do
[1:55:59] when love is the mightiest force that
[1:56:01] there is
[1:56:02] so in other words when love projected
[1:56:04] sovereign grace took over
[1:56:07] now these are the grips yes exactly
[1:56:12] little fishy i give you back your life
[1:56:16] yes sir before the doctors touches my
[1:56:20] wife
[1:56:21] let the tumor be gone
[1:56:23] [Music]
[1:56:25] now if there was a there was a promise
[1:56:26] that that's given that there's going to
[1:56:28] be a ministry exactly like that ministry
[1:56:33] now i'm drawing to a close yes
[1:56:37] and i wanted to really just climax into
[1:56:38] this one with with this
[1:56:40] thank you the musicians can come up amen
[1:56:46] and we know the various stories in the
[1:56:47] prophet's life the boom
[1:56:49] we were speaking to the bull yes sir
[1:56:53] and apologizing yes sir to him
[1:56:56] amen and says to him that look uh
[1:57:01] you know the way the prophet puts it
[1:57:03] there he says it's i'm i'm here
[1:57:05] and he speaks to him in this way he says
[1:57:07] it's your creator and it's my creator
[1:57:10] and when he speaks to him with that love
[1:57:12] yes
[1:57:13] he says sovereign grace took over
[1:57:18] yes sir then in divine love and
[1:57:21] sovereign grace i wanted to read this
[1:57:23] quote specifically
[1:57:26] yes and we he speaks on the warnings
[1:57:28] here amen
[1:57:29] he says instead of hating those little
[1:57:31] fellows and trying to fight them
[1:57:33] i love them and i said little creatures
[1:57:36] of god i'm the servant of the lord
[1:57:39] i'm in a hurry and that's the reason why
[1:57:42] i hit the nest
[1:57:43] or the fence i said god's people comes
[1:57:46] in for me to pray for them and i am a
[1:57:48] servant of the creator
[1:57:50] who is also your creator now in the name
[1:57:53] of the lord jesus go back to your nest
[1:57:56] i won't bother you anymore you go right
[1:57:58] back to your nest
[1:58:00] and as god will have the judgment keys
[1:58:03] at the day of judgment
[1:58:05] those hornets was just humming as hard
[1:58:08] as they could
[1:58:09] you can play something look he says not
[1:58:13] one of them touched me and one took the
[1:58:16] lead and every hornet single filed and
[1:58:18] went right straight
[1:58:20] back to the nest and went inside the
[1:58:22] nest
[1:58:23] the prophet turns around and he says
[1:58:25] what was it
[1:58:28] now listen to what he says in this
[1:58:29] message
[1:58:30] [Applause]
[1:58:32] and this is very similar if you take it
[1:58:33] back all the way to the day of pentecost
[1:58:37] the prophet says i don't know something
[1:58:40] happened
[1:58:41] he says i don't know whether god
[1:58:43] converted their yearning to hear me
[1:58:46] or whether he changed my words to their
[1:58:49] language
[1:58:50] [Applause]
[1:58:51] [Music]
[1:58:52] my that was the manifestation because
[1:58:57] under this dispensation you can raise to
[1:58:59] your feet
[1:59:00] under this dispensation of grace he
[1:59:03] demonstrated exactly what had happened
[1:59:05] in the day of pentecost
[1:59:07] when peter stood up and said repent
[1:59:11] there was multiple different languages
[1:59:14] but they all heard what he
[1:59:16] said
[1:59:19] now here's the grapes of the of this
[1:59:21] land
[1:59:23] he says he changed my words to their
[1:59:25] language
[1:59:26] whether a projecting of that love that i
[1:59:29] had for them
[1:59:30] but something had taken place and the
[1:59:33] hornets went back into their nest
[1:59:39] and now we realize now that
[1:59:42] you know how god's grace had come
[1:59:43] through
[1:59:45] and for me again like i said i just
[1:59:46] wanted to run it all the way through
[1:59:50] and we have to come to the realization
[1:59:51] that we have to possess this land
[1:59:56] and the prophet says that grace provided
[1:59:58] us a lamb who took the book and opened
[2:00:00] the seals
[2:00:00] [Music]
[2:00:03] when john stood there crying because he
[2:00:06] realized that
[2:00:08] all of humanity is going to be lost
[2:00:11] there was no wonder it was found worthy
[2:00:14] no one on the earth no one underneath
[2:00:16] the earth no one in ages to come no one
[2:00:18] in ages gone past
[2:00:21] could do it
[2:00:21] [Music]
[2:00:24] and when the elder cried out john behold
[2:00:26] the line of the tribe of judah has
[2:00:28] prevailed in other words
[2:00:30] the prophet says god by his amazing
[2:00:33] grace
[2:00:35] provided that lamb to take the book
[2:00:38] to lose the seals thereof and that was
[2:00:41] you and i
[2:00:42] he says god break to us the seals that's
[2:00:44] on the back of the book
[2:00:45] now let us enter into this great place
[2:00:48] and in the last days there's got to be a
[2:00:50] place prepared for the word to be made
[2:00:52] manifest
[2:00:53] and we're now living by the evidence of
[2:00:55] the new land
[2:00:56] which is the son of man and we are
[2:00:59] feeding on the unfailing body word
[2:01:01] of the son of man adoption one
[2:01:04] let's press now into a position the
[2:01:07] prophet
[2:01:08] says a promise of the baptism of the
[2:01:11] holy ghost give the lord and praise amen
[2:01:16] let's just praise the lord and thank him
[2:01:18] for his grace and mercy upon our lives
[2:01:20] thank you for his grace that he sent the
[2:01:22] message your way
[2:01:23] thank him that he has opened up the seal
[2:01:25] [Applause]
[2:01:27] thank him that he brought the revelation
[2:01:29] of jesus christ
[2:01:30] the threefold purpose to you so that you
[2:01:33] and i can see it
[2:01:35] and that is god's amazing grace
[2:01:39] let's give the lord and praise amen
