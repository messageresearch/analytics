[10:42] our last two um a
[10:46] a a bible teacher about
[10:49] talent and treasure and some time
[10:52] and truly i was thinking i was talking
[10:55] to my wife
[10:56] and sharing with her how you know
[10:58] everything to us is unknown
[11:00] and many times we don't see that we tend
[11:03] to say we
[11:03] have this and we own this and so but
[11:05] everything is unknown our wives our
[11:07] husbands our children
[11:09] our jobs our own life all that we have
[11:12] is unknown
[11:14] we are already stewards of god's grace
[11:16] stewards
[11:17] mean that we are accountable and
[11:19] responsible for what is placed in our
[11:21] hands
[11:22] gifts and talents just think tonight
[11:24] whatever gift you're born with
[11:26] whatever gift you have engineer
[11:28] architect
[11:29] doctor lawyer doesn't matter what talent
[11:32] you have
[11:33] that time come from somewhere that
[11:35] talent come from god
[11:36] and god give you the ability to earn to
[11:39] learn to study to serve him to love
[11:42] him to appreciate him and he values your
[11:45] response
[11:46] he values your response tonight i have
[11:48] something i'd like to share with you
[11:50] tonight
[11:51] and um uh it's uh
[11:54] the soar the seed
[11:58] the ground that's what i want to share
[11:59] with you tonight last sunday we
[12:02] had a stream service about data paid
[12:04] upon the lord showing you their strength
[12:06] and
[12:07] uh in such a time as this you can't
[12:10] be anxious you can't be uh
[12:14] you know wanting this to happen right
[12:15] away and want it to happen fast
[12:17] you just have to wait and be patient
[12:20] and this will continue along that vein
[12:22] tonight so you have your bibles i'd like
[12:24] you to turn to genesis chapter
[12:27] one we want to read from 11 to 12.
[12:30] so keep your bibles nearby we have some
[12:32] scriptures and we want to go straight
[12:34] into tonight and see how the lord will
[12:36] lead
[12:37] so it's the sore the seed the girl
[12:40] genesis chapter 1 reading from verse 11
[12:43] and god said let the earth bring forth
[12:45] grass the herbal and seed
[12:47] and the fruit tree yielding fruit after
[12:49] its kind
[12:50] whose seed is in itself upon the earth
[12:53] and it was so
[12:54] and the earth brought forth grass and
[12:56] herbald and seed
[12:58] and it was so and
[13:01] and the earth was grass and herbies of
[13:03] his kind and the tree healing fruit
[13:05] whose seed was in itself after his kind
[13:08] and god so that it was good
[13:10] and lower down to 26 to 26
[13:13] and god said let us make man in our
[13:15] image after all likeness
[13:17] let them have dominion over the fish of
[13:18] the sea over the fall of the year
[13:20] over the cattle over all the earth and
[13:23] over
[13:23] every creeping thing that creeped upon
[13:25] the earth so god created man
[13:27] in his own image in the image of god
[13:29] created him
[13:30] male and female crazily them and god
[13:33] bless them
[13:34] and god said unto them be fruitful and
[13:36] multiply and replenish
[13:39] subdue it have dominion over the fish of
[13:41] the sea
[13:42] and over the fall of the air and over
[13:44] every living thing that moved upon his
[13:46] head
[13:46] now notice notice here
[13:49] that god when god give a command or give
[13:53] a pronouncement
[13:54] he covers the end from the beginning he
[13:57] actually give them
[13:59] the whole scope which was to be fruitful
[14:03] multiply replenish the earth subdue it
[14:07] have dominion over every living thing
[14:10] that covered up on the earth
[14:12] so that was a full comprehensive view
[14:16] of adam to be god over the earth
[14:20] but they had was to wait
[14:24] for further revelation of how this is so
[14:26] unfull
[14:28] and this is what we get from what
[14:30] brother branham shared so i'll be
[14:32] uh splicing in scriptures with what the
[14:34] prophet shared
[14:35] and he said now when god made every seed
[14:37] of this kind so that was a law
[14:39] god put there seed
[14:42] after it's kind so there's a kind of
[14:45] seed
[14:46] and every seed supposed to see in its
[14:47] own channel and reproduce itself
[14:50] and there was nothing like him god
[14:53] was a spirit so therefore god made man
[14:56] his own image
[14:57] or hear these words gold made every seed
[14:59] after his kind
[15:01] then when he made man in his image
[15:04] it was a seed of his word
[15:08] but jesus was made
[15:11] flesh he the flesh of the word of god
[15:15] and when we receive the word of god then
[15:17] we become god's word
[15:18] in our flesh the church should be in
[15:21] that condition
[15:22] so adam was a seed of the word
[15:26] jesus the flesh of the word the word
[15:28] itself
[15:29] made flesh so take note of that okay we
[15:32] want to go to genesis 3
[15:34] and this is after the devil trap eve
[15:38] we're going to read from verse 9 this is
[15:41] adam
[15:42] backslidden adam out of the spirit adam
[15:44] out of his position
[15:46] and god calling out to adam the verse 9
[15:50] of genesis chapter 3.
[15:51] if you want to find it and the lord god
[15:53] called unto adam and said on them where
[15:55] now
[15:57] and as well isaac shared with you that's
[15:59] not location
[16:01] that's where uh you from the realm that
[16:04] i leave you in
[16:06] and he said i heard a voice in the
[16:08] garden and i was afraid because i was
[16:10] naked and i hid myself
[16:13] and he said who told you the dog was
[16:14] naked has now eaten up the tree where
[16:16] i commanded thee the dog should not eat
[16:20] the man said the woman whom though gave
[16:22] us to be with me
[16:24] she gave me of the tree and i did eat
[16:28] and the lord god said unto the woman
[16:30] what is this that does
[16:32] done that woman said this sip and
[16:34] beguile me and i get eaten so they
[16:36] passed an e-book
[16:37] i don't say the woman the woman said his
[16:38] serpent and the lord sends the
[16:40] discipline
[16:41] because that was done this thou had
[16:43] cursed our cuddle
[16:45] above every piece of the field and this
[16:48] upright being
[16:49] upon thy belly shall go and thus shall
[16:52] thou eat all the days of thy life
[16:54] that is when he hit the dust this this
[16:56] is the words i want to get to
[16:58] and i will put enmity between d and the
[17:00] woman
[17:01] between thy seed and her seed
[17:05] and they shall bruise thy head and thou
[17:08] shall bruise
[17:09] his heel so the battle of angels
[17:13] not just became the battle of men but
[17:15] this battle
[17:16] come to the flesh level in which
[17:20] in genesis they have been identified
[17:24] two seeds between thy seed
[17:27] and her seed dye seed meaning
[17:30] the serpent seed and whose seed
[17:34] meaning from adam so right away
[17:37] this word that is a seed
[17:41] this word that is creative and god
[17:44] identifying
[17:45] this seed now on the earth in terms of
[17:48] a life and then verse 16 unto the woman
[17:52] he said i will greatly multiply thy
[17:53] sorrow
[17:54] and thy conception and sorrow and shall
[17:56] bring forth children
[17:58] and that desire shall be to thy husband
[18:01] and everywhere he said and he shall rule
[18:03] over thee
[18:04] and under adam he said because i was
[18:06] hacking unto the voice of thy wife
[18:08] as eaten of the tree of which i
[18:09] commanded sin and thou shalt not eat of
[18:11] it curses the ground for thy sake
[18:13] and soul shall not eat of it all the
[18:15] days of thy life
[18:16] thorns also and tissues shall they bring
[18:19] forth to thee
[18:20] and those shall eat the hulk of the
[18:22] field and the sweat of thy face thou
[18:24] shalt eat bread
[18:25] till they'll return onto the ground for
[18:27] out of it was though taking dust out
[18:30] until dust thou shalt return now let's
[18:33] hear a little bit from
[18:35] he said no adam was not deceived
[18:39] but his bride was not deceived and he
[18:42] said
[18:42] he gave him a bride a type of second
[18:44] adam he gave the first adam a bride she
[18:46] fell
[18:47] he gave the second album christ a bright
[18:49] she fell she is not an
[18:51] original she's a vibrator the bride
[18:54] today
[18:55] so-called i'm saying so-called is a
[18:57] byproduct see
[18:58] she calls herself the bride but what she
[19:00] is
[19:01] she is made up of a material of
[19:04] organization not of the word
[19:07] so much word in it to make it a kind of
[19:10] byproduct
[19:11] to make it hypocritical he believed most
[19:14] of the word
[19:15] but she doubted one part of it adam
[19:18] bride
[19:19] could not wait so she mingled her seed
[19:23] illegally do you see why i am contending
[19:26] for that word
[19:28] word by word i repeat it again
[19:31] do you see why i am contending for that
[19:34] word
[19:35] word by word i have told you i believe
[19:38] that is god's truth
[19:40] god has protected the bible he's got to
[19:43] judge the world by
[19:44] something through jesus christ which is
[19:46] the word the word made flesh
[19:49] so adam bride couldn't wait you see
[19:52] there is
[19:53] nothing to it they say it's phony watch
[19:55] he says
[19:56] okay i'll back up a little bit that's
[19:58] the way the bride today she wants to
[20:00] manufacture something
[20:02] to say i'm adopted or i am in this
[20:04] position and i am that position i have
[20:07] this authority
[20:08] and this corona virus flattening all
[20:10] these supermen and all these who are
[20:12] feeling that power what will flatten
[20:14] them like pancake
[20:15] because god will get glory at the end of
[20:17] it through his bride so it had no man to
[20:21] raise up to iron this and beat his chest
[20:24] god would not have that
[20:25] so he said no she wants to manufacture
[20:28] something
[20:29] she's got to work it up on a platform
[20:30] she's got to have everything see what is
[20:32] she doing
[20:33] manufacturing something the way it's
[20:35] going you can see there's nothing to it
[20:38] it's a phony if it wasn't forget about
[20:41] this world would be a flame with the
[20:45] power of god
[20:46] and the church will be on fire oh what
[20:49] dead would be raised
[20:50] and all kind of things would be taking
[20:52] place
[20:53] so all this quiet gospel that people
[20:55] want to peddle
[20:56] because they don't have the power to
[20:59] manifest and they will ridicule those
[21:01] who anointed and claiming and believing
[21:03] and expecting
[21:04] that this same holy ghost that was on
[21:06] pentecost is just as real
[21:08] they want to make much of it but it
[21:10] doesn't change the fact
[21:12] that god that the prophet identified
[21:15] that if it was
[21:16] here as promised then all kinds of
[21:18] things will be taking place
[21:19] all kinds of things will take place
[21:20] deadly debris and everything else now
[21:22] but what did she get sold up
[21:24] before christ could get her before he
[21:26] got to her to plant his own seed
[21:29] oh so jesus have his own seed that's
[21:32] right
[21:33] where did she have weed seeds she got
[21:35] wool denominational seeds
[21:37] and that's the reason why she's reaping
[21:40] her harvest right now
[21:41] i hope that this doesn't make you upset
[21:44] i hope it gets
[21:44] right down to the place where i trust
[21:46] that god has given it to you
[21:48] what was she after wisdom
[21:52] god give a commission that cannot perish
[21:57] replenish multiply that was god's
[22:00] eternal purpose
[22:01] and the matter today he says you want
[22:04] some kind of phony makeup with screaming
[22:06] jumping speaking in tongues instead of
[22:09] waiting here we go
[22:10] for the real word of god to be made
[22:13] manifest
[22:15] to the bride so because many
[22:18] don't want to wait people claim certain
[22:21] things
[22:22] and what we ought to do is to anoint the
[22:25] promises that god made lord you promised
[22:27] this
[22:27] you promised me deliverance you punched
[22:29] me i breakthrough you promised me
[22:31] victory
[22:31] you can't lie your word can't feel you
[22:34] said your word carry turn void
[22:36] so it's an attitude of uh placing god
[22:40] right on top of what he has promised now
[22:43] you didn't promise
[22:44] you didn't make the promise is he made a
[22:45] promise he said behold i send you elijah
[22:48] you can say god you send me elijah i
[22:50] receive elijah
[22:51] i receive the message oh i want this
[22:53] message to be alive in me
[22:54] i know i am not a child of the enemy i'm
[22:57] not a super
[22:57] seed i'm a child of god and lord you
[23:00] promised me these things and i am
[23:02] claiming them not only for me but for my
[23:04] family
[23:05] and you are blind yourself to the hot
[23:07] pants the mini skirt
[23:09] the smoking the drinking whatever
[23:10] negative whatever world they're in
[23:12] that has nothing to do with the promise
[23:14] and i'll prove it to you tonight
[23:16] whatever condition your loved ones are
[23:18] in right now
[23:19] right now that has nothing to do with
[23:22] the promise of god
[23:23] the promise is true the promise is real
[23:26] god cannot lie but we say amen tonight
[23:29] so watch he says instead of waiting
[23:33] for the real word of god to be mean
[23:35] manifested bright then kind that takes
[23:37] the word
[23:38] is god's true bride bringing forth
[23:40] children
[23:41] they can't die a child
[23:45] the bride brings forth on the word can't
[23:47] die
[23:48] because it's the word did you get it she
[23:51] can't die
[23:52] that child can't die because he's a word
[23:55] child
[23:55] he's a sea child he's an eternal child
[23:58] and i find that it's so wonderful
[23:59] tonight
[24:00] so you see now watch the
[24:04] seed word here we go cannot
[24:07] grow in the atmosphere then
[24:10] of knowledge as soon as
[24:13] knowledge mixes with fate it dies right
[24:16] there
[24:17] oh i want you to see that tonight the
[24:19] true
[24:20] seed word cannot grow
[24:24] in an atmosphere of knowledge and the
[24:27] bible talk about in the last days
[24:29] knowledge shall increase what we have
[24:31] now is the fullness of knowledge
[24:34] has been loosed on the earth and the
[24:37] false bride or uh the impersonator bride
[24:41] in a condition of knowledge claiming to
[24:43] be bright that's not it
[24:45] that is why the devil fight worship they
[24:47] verified
[24:48] you get it in the spirit it fight a
[24:51] genuine atmosphere
[24:53] even some of these songs i hear
[24:54] sometimes it's just heavily
[24:56] intellectual and just words they fling
[24:58] woods at music or fling music words
[25:01] and make it a song and call it a message
[25:03] song and it's just you have to listen
[25:05] and hear and almost saying he meant to
[25:07] be song instead of
[25:08] something that is inspired by experience
[25:11] that that resonate over the heart like
[25:14] in this last song uh some song that but
[25:17] the guinea was talking about that isaac
[25:19] happened to sing
[25:20] and the person why the children died and
[25:22] his wife survived
[25:23] like how does he talk about when his
[25:25] wife died
[25:27] and and and this hallows he was on the
[25:29] fields doing evangelism
[25:31] and they called him and say your wife
[25:32] died he's all lord somebody tell him
[25:34] don't say lord say precious lord
[25:36] and right there he started saying
[25:37] precious lord take my hands
[25:39] leave me on and help me let me stand i'm
[25:42] tired
[25:43] i'm weak i'm warned to stop these are
[25:45] the kind experiences
[25:46] and these songs that is not
[25:49] from intellectual
[25:50] pertinent words on a piece of paper and
[25:53] call it a song
[25:54] not beated in that way but waited from
[25:56] the the experience that people go
[25:58] through
[25:58] these are song that has lived through
[26:00] the years and they're still anointed
[26:02] they're still inspired like like blind
[26:04] fanny cosby i shall know him
[26:06] by the prince of the nails in his hands
[26:08] oh my all these bloodstone there's a
[26:10] fountain filled with blood drawn from me
[26:12] manual
[26:13] where sinners punch beneath the flood
[26:15] and lose all their guilty stings
[26:17] all these are such inspiring songs and
[26:19] when you sing them and
[26:20] and play them and get in the spirit with
[26:22] them it keeps you in an atmosphere
[26:25] and these are the kind of things i want
[26:26] to encourage i mean there are
[26:28] other songs wordified songs i call them
[26:31] they have its place they remind every
[26:32] message and the word and the knowledge
[26:33] and so on
[26:34] but what you really want is the things
[26:36] that get you in the spirit
[26:37] in the spirit because the world spirit
[26:39] is very dominant the prince of the power
[26:41] of the air is very dominant
[26:43] you're fighting music the atmosphere
[26:45] people the noise are wrong
[26:47] it's demon activity everywhere because
[26:49] satan have a last ride
[26:52] hallelujah so you are fighting against
[26:54] hell on the earth
[26:55] and that is why i have to press your way
[26:57] to get in the spirit and that's why i
[26:59] certainly appreciate you being here
[27:00] tonight
[27:01] to hear this word tonight that we are
[27:03] bringing to you
[27:04] so therefore the seed word cannot grow
[27:07] in our atmosphere of knowledge
[27:10] so what obama's dramatizing here he says
[27:14] uh you you shall not surely die you
[27:17] think that good loving father god would
[27:18] do a thing like that
[27:20] what did she do she listened to reason
[27:22] took his wisdom a tree delight one can
[27:25] desire of it to be wise right
[27:27] this is until uh and so on eve
[27:30] you see the seed that she was
[27:34] holding and would have finally become a
[27:37] mother
[27:37] by the will of god through a spoken word
[27:40] would have finally become a mother but
[27:42] she couldn't wait
[27:44] and went into that yeah you see it again
[27:47] the holy ghost seeds of the bible
[27:50] i'll say it again the holy ghost seeds
[27:53] of the bible
[27:54] cannot grow in an atmosphere of wisdom
[27:59] that kills every seminary in the country
[28:03] so how does that line up with the bible
[28:05] talking about the last days they shall
[28:06] be silly women
[28:08] leading with divers lost want to heap
[28:11] unto themselves teachers have been
[28:13] itching ears ever learning
[28:15] and never coming to the knowledge of the
[28:17] truth come like oh the prophet says
[28:19] when you see the message the rest is
[28:21] filler material
[28:23] when you really see the message so i'm
[28:26] not trying to get filler material
[28:28] to kill time we're not trying to kill
[28:30] time
[28:31] and stretch out like a long movie a long
[28:33] drink and keep pouring water
[28:34] no no we're trying to get to the core
[28:37] what
[28:38] is this about because god are certain
[28:41] laws
[28:41] are certain principles and if you see
[28:44] these principles and laws and live by
[28:45] them
[28:46] then your life will be on the right
[28:47] track it will be rightly channeled
[28:50] are you with me tonight so therefore eve
[28:53] was to believe the word as it was given
[28:55] to her
[28:56] you know i was doing something yet on
[28:58] the computer as the installer program
[29:00] and whatnot
[29:00] and i find myself following instructions
[29:03] what has given the internet do this do
[29:05] this
[29:05] and afterwards i realize that i
[29:08] am following instructions to the letter
[29:13] because if you don't follow the
[29:14] instructions you wouldn't get the
[29:15] results
[29:16] if they say do this type in this put in
[29:18] this here do this here
[29:20] erase this here do this here do this
[29:22] here if you do
[29:23] the instructions you'll get the results
[29:26] and then when i did that i said
[29:27] look at that look how we could follow
[29:30] instruction because i am not a computer
[29:33] scientist i am not a programmer i am not
[29:35] a writer of code and whatnot we don't
[29:37] know what the writing name we don't know
[29:38] what they have behind there you know
[29:39] we're just doing what they say
[29:41] press this say i agree to this do this
[29:42] do this do this
[29:44] and i'm telling myself why is it that we
[29:47] can't take the word of god just like
[29:48] that
[29:50] just like that god the promising revival
[29:52] i want it i'm looking for it i'm
[29:54] expecting it
[29:55] god you promised to be a healer not you
[29:57] know you know like
[29:59] i got born sick like it's god's will for
[30:01] me to be sick
[30:02] not that kind of talk i want you to say
[30:04] i i'm going to be
[30:06] healed oh god i must be paying for my
[30:07] sins no i don't want
[30:09] that kind of talk i want to talk a
[30:11] redemption blood
[30:12] deliverance this is what we want to hear
[30:14] this is what we wanted to claim
[30:16] this is when you ask god i can't hold i
[30:19] go dead
[30:21] yeah you've got that but no no you can't
[30:24] claim that right now
[30:25] you might even mix the rapture before
[30:27] that hit you so you can't go and anoint
[30:29] that god here people 90 years old 92
[30:32] years old god
[30:33] called abraham when he was old and bless
[30:35] abraham and change his body and so on
[30:37] so you have to be exercising your faith
[30:40] even in this chronic virus environment
[30:42] right you know and and we have to keep
[30:44] pressing on by god's grace
[30:46] so let's continue tonight so watch uh
[30:50] skip that now
[30:53] adam bright could not wait multiply and
[30:56] replenish the earth
[30:58] here we go and this part i want to get
[30:59] to it was on
[31:01] an uncommenting a promise remember i
[31:03] told you
[31:04] that god gave them the hopes whole scope
[31:06] multiply replenish subdue and different
[31:09] things like that the whole school
[31:10] but it was an uncommon promise and it
[31:13] come like god promised to pull when he
[31:15] first come down with
[31:16] 2.10 manifestation of god spoken word
[31:18] all these things
[31:19] but we can't run as if that is what we
[31:21] have now
[31:22] that is insane it doesn't work that way
[31:25] god
[31:25] told samuel anoint one of your son that
[31:28] jesse to be king
[31:29] but david got saying oh god
[31:38] you know that was going to end right
[31:40] they was going to take his head off
[31:42] so so in other words when god released
[31:45] the anointing of dominion
[31:47] the anointing of authority the anointing
[31:50] to be a manifested son
[31:52] the anointed to be adopted son because
[31:54] he has to do that first
[31:56] the anointing of your position
[31:59] of your calling have to come upon you
[32:02] another anointing is what helps direct
[32:05] you to where you're supposed to go
[32:07] but before you reach the fulfillment of
[32:10] where the anointing
[32:11] want to carry you and take you and place
[32:13] you you have to go to
[32:15] process and this here
[32:18] is the law of the seed
[32:22] the law of the seed because the seed
[32:25] itself
[32:25] goes through process you don't take a
[32:28] seed and say
[32:29] uh i'm looking forward for fruit
[32:32] tomorrow you know we just planted
[32:33] yesterday
[32:34] it doesn't work that way a lot of people
[32:36] wish it was that way
[32:38] but it doesn't work that way when you
[32:40] put down a seed
[32:42] you have to w-a-i-t
[32:45] you have to wait that's where patients
[32:47] come in
[32:49] because the sea demands that law of
[32:51] planting
[32:53] waiting unfolding and that unfolding is
[32:57] the
[32:57] life of the seed is unfolding isn't that
[33:00] right
[33:01] so this is the principle that god
[33:03] established since in
[33:05] genesis in the beginning so he said
[33:08] he told adam and eve multiply and
[33:10] replenish the earth
[33:11] it was an uncommenting a promise
[33:14] so it wasn't it yet i have it now no it
[33:17] was a promise
[33:18] she was not his wife as yet
[33:22] because he had never lived with her
[33:25] the bride of christ is not his wife
[33:28] yet so all these catchphrases and the
[33:31] eye and the bride and
[33:32] all these nice fancy words you see when
[33:35] you already get down in the scriptures
[33:36] you recognize
[33:37] that is not really what people think it
[33:38] is the bride of christ
[33:42] is not his wife yet the wedding supper
[33:46] is to take place okay now she got in a
[33:49] hurry
[33:50] she crossed her seed she mingled it with
[33:53] the sip and seed
[33:54] and what did she bring a child of death
[33:57] and she perverted every child
[33:59] after that after that amen so if you
[34:02] have a bible let's go to matthew 13 and
[34:04] we go to the new testament
[34:06] and we start to see how to unfold from
[34:08] here
[34:09] matthew 13 we want to read from verse 3
[34:11] of matthew chapter 13
[34:13] reading from verse 3. and he speak many
[34:16] things as a demon parable saying
[34:17] behold i saw went forth to sow when he
[34:21] sowed some seeds fell
[34:22] by the west side the fowl came and
[34:24] devoured them up
[34:26] some fell upon stony places where they
[34:28] had not much earth
[34:30] and fort way they sprung up because they
[34:31] had no deepness of earth
[34:34] when the sun was up they were scorched
[34:36] and because they had no root they
[34:37] withered away
[34:39] some fell among thorns and the torns
[34:41] sprung up and
[34:42] choked them some fell into good ground
[34:45] and brought forth fruit some a
[34:47] hundredfold
[34:49] some 64 some 34. what else to hear
[34:53] let him hear was stan and the disciples
[34:56] came and said unto him
[34:57] why speakers though unto them in
[35:00] parables
[35:01] he answered them because it is given
[35:04] unto you to know the mysteries of the
[35:06] kingdom of heaven
[35:07] but to them it is not given for
[35:09] whosoever hath
[35:11] to him shall be given and he shall have
[35:14] more abundance
[35:16] but whosoever have not from him shall be
[35:19] taken
[35:19] even that he had now when he amplified
[35:22] that scripture that verse 12
[35:24] it reads for whosoever has spiritual
[35:26] knowledge
[35:28] to him will be given will more be given
[35:31] and he will be furnishly richly so that
[35:33] he will have abundance
[35:35] but from him who has not even what he
[35:37] has
[35:38] will be taken away so let's continue to
[35:41] verse 13. therefore
[35:42] speak eye into them in parables because
[35:44] they see and see not
[35:46] hearing they hear not nearly understand
[35:48] and in
[35:49] them is fulfilled the prophecy of isaias
[35:52] which said by hearing you shall hear
[35:54] shall understand and seeing you shall
[35:56] see
[35:57] and shall not perceive for this
[36:00] people's heart you know why hear why
[36:03] exactly prophecy
[36:04] for this people's heart is wax gross
[36:07] and the ears are dull hearing and the
[36:10] eyes they have closed at least at any
[36:12] time they should see where their eyes
[36:14] here with their ears
[36:15] should understand with their heart
[36:17] should be converted i would heal them
[36:19] but blessed are your eyes for they see
[36:22] and your ears for they hear
[36:24] for very like unto you that many
[36:26] prophets and righteous men have desire
[36:28] to see those things which you see
[36:29] i've not seen them and to hear those
[36:31] things which you hear and have not heard
[36:33] them
[36:34] verse 18 hear ye therefore
[36:38] the parable of the sewer
[36:41] and then jesus went to break it down to
[36:43] them now i could say tonight blessed are
[36:46] your ears
[36:47] what you hear and your eyes what you
[36:49] have seen you are seeing god release
[36:51] a 20th century prophet with a pillar of
[36:54] fire
[36:55] you have seen god release a message in
[36:57] this hour
[36:59] and revelation that even in ages gone
[37:02] past did not have
[37:04] you have seen the fulfillment of what
[37:05] god told daniel go that way the book is
[37:07] sealed
[37:08] till the time of the year people take it
[37:10] for granted now
[37:12] about books and the tapes and revelation
[37:16] but the fact is all through the ages of
[37:18] waiting for this house
[37:20] the return of the book which is
[37:23] the title leader of the earth back on
[37:25] the signs
[37:27] and it's so strange and unique that god
[37:30] the only way god could get this book to
[37:32] us not just as
[37:33] written or as spoken but as
[37:37] a seed that's why god told
[37:40] go to the prophet said the end time
[37:42] messenger
[37:43] he would sow the seed of the entire
[37:46] bible
[37:47] and the secret is what the word
[37:51] is in the bride so therefore
[37:55] it took some time but god's interest
[37:58] was to get the word into you
[38:01] because the pentecostal and i remember
[38:03] preaching on it some time ago
[38:05] with dynamics which was power which was
[38:08] the anointing
[38:09] they couldn't come to adoption because
[38:11] they did not have the seed
[38:13] so it's not so much the iranian is
[38:16] what's seen in you because the rain is
[38:18] coming
[38:19] nobody can't stop that today was quite a
[38:22] rainy day here in trinidad
[38:24] nobody cast up the rain and said put an
[38:25] umbrella and block the old sky
[38:27] and block the rain no they ain't coming
[38:29] but it's coming on seats
[38:31] is which kind of seed it's what kind of
[38:32] seed because we have a soil
[38:35] we have the seed and we have the ground
[38:40] now the sower is connected with the seed
[38:42] because the sower is the one who sows
[38:44] the seed
[38:45] and when you hear son of man you know
[38:47] who he is right
[38:49] he's his sower he had the sow of the
[38:51] good seed
[38:52] and that is what jesus came in this last
[38:54] day to do
[38:55] he came to a prophet to bring
[38:58] seed not just seed but
[39:02] original seed which is the spoken word
[39:06] and you know you see men ministers
[39:09] pastors and
[39:10] whoever else gives a lot of
[39:12] interpretation and their ideas
[39:14] because they feel quoting from the
[39:16] prophet is not good enough
[39:18] it needs a long stretcher you know like
[39:21] rubber band and you pull it and you spin
[39:22] it and everything else
[39:24] but the thing of it is if we believe
[39:28] god was veiled in that elijah and spoke
[39:31] out through that man
[39:33] that means what came out of his mouth
[39:35] was spirit given
[39:37] or spirit spoken words the spirit itself
[39:40] spoke those words
[39:42] and the words itself are seeds let there
[39:44] be let there be
[39:45] let there be let there be so what you
[39:48] have been receiving is not the words of
[39:49] a man
[39:51] you are receiving the words of the son
[39:52] of man spirit given words
[39:55] know when here we go when these spirit
[39:58] come back to find out
[40:02] and to hunt for those seeds oh glory
[40:05] hallelujah when when the holy ghost
[40:09] comes back he will be looking for the
[40:12] very seeds
[40:13] that was spoken and released by the saw
[40:17] because brother branham he brought part
[40:20] of it was
[40:21] historical because a lot of mysteries
[40:24] was missed back there that has
[40:26] absolutely nothing to do with the bride
[40:29] that have to do with information of
[40:31] revelation
[40:32] that was not understood so if we talk
[40:35] about sip and seed
[40:36] and we talked about uh uh other
[40:39] mysteries that have back there
[40:41] or come like okay the seas have been
[40:42] open first seal
[40:44] white horse red horse ego pilos rightos
[40:47] red horse and so on like that
[40:48] that is history fought seal prophecy
[40:51] fifth seal
[40:52] jews six seals judgment what concerns
[40:56] us is this seventh seal not for the seal
[40:59] that's information it have revelation
[41:02] under there you have understanding over
[41:03] there you have inspiration under there
[41:05] but that's not that's not easy for the
[41:06] bride then
[41:07] the end time seal is the seventh seal
[41:11] so therefore the seed of the entire
[41:14] bible
[41:15] had to be released under the seven seal
[41:18] for the end time bride
[41:20] all the mysteries had to be gathered up
[41:23] into a revelation of the son of man
[41:25] so that is why he said malachi 4 came to
[41:28] open
[41:28] six seals it's all gathered up into a
[41:31] revelation of sonoma
[41:32] besoa so once we cover the path
[41:36] which is the historical path which is
[41:38] the church ages past
[41:39] then you recover the sun they come like
[41:42] you saw a man lost
[41:43] he get deleted he get erased that's the
[41:46] first age son of man saw seeds
[41:49] the seeds that he sow become flesh
[41:52] and was made manifest in the book of
[41:54] acts so it wasn't like
[41:56] a book seed it was like peter had spoken
[41:58] books on his and explaining and
[42:00] explaining and talking
[42:02] they were the living word they
[42:05] were the seeds itself they were
[42:08] the word manifested could we say amen
[42:11] tonight
[42:12] so therefore when it was the seat fell
[42:15] in nicer
[42:16] and fell into the ground under the
[42:19] promise of i will restore
[42:20] kangawan caterpillar lucas and pamela it
[42:23] took
[42:23] four moves justification sanification
[42:27] baptism of the holy ghost and the word
[42:28] itself it took luther wesley the
[42:31] pentecostal and it took malachi for
[42:32] prophet to come and bring the word
[42:34] itself
[42:34] to bring us back on point
[42:38] to prepare for reign or prepare for
[42:42] manifestation
[42:43] or prepare for fulfillment the seed
[42:46] we're talking about
[42:47] so let me just look at just hasten a bit
[42:49] now
[42:51] but um jesus i think reached verse 18
[42:54] here
[42:54] here you the idea for the parable of the
[42:56] soul when one heareth the word
[42:59] of the kingdom and understand it
[43:02] not then commit the wicked one cash it
[43:05] away
[43:06] that which was sown in his heart this is
[43:08] he
[43:09] which receives seed by the wayside so
[43:12] the first one
[43:13] is wayside you recite people wayside
[43:16] people
[43:16] recite church members you're hearing and
[43:19] the devil just snatching things from
[43:20] them
[43:21] and they are seize that by the wayside
[43:24] verse 20.
[43:25] he had received a deceit into stony
[43:26] places the same as he that hearing the
[43:29] word
[43:30] and are non-received but joy received it
[43:32] yet
[43:33] he had not rooted himself but drew it
[43:35] for a while enjoyed for a while and
[43:37] when tribulation or persecution arise it
[43:39] because of the word
[43:40] by and by is offended he also
[43:44] that receives seed among the torns is he
[43:46] that heareth the word
[43:48] and the care of those this world and
[43:51] this deceitfulness of the riches choke
[43:53] the word
[43:54] and become unfruitful but here that we
[43:57] see that
[43:58] seed into the good ground you see that
[44:01] here at the word
[44:03] understand it also bear fruit bring it
[44:06] forth
[44:06] 104 60 30.
[44:10] all right
[44:14] blessed be the name of the lord i want
[44:15] to go to luke 8
[44:17] we want to take it from dear because it
[44:20] brings a different
[44:21] uh picture same story but we just have
[44:24] the condensed part
[44:25] luke 8 reading from verse 14 to 18. you
[44:28] want to go and find it
[44:28] luke chapter 8 was 14 to 18 and after
[44:31] tonight we're going to put this
[44:33] uh this this on thing that we're sharing
[44:35] here
[44:36] on the whatsapp group that you could get
[44:38] you could always go put this over
[44:40] luke 8 14 to 18. jesus speaking and that
[44:44] which fell among tones so i'm going to
[44:46] start from the torns
[44:48] in luke 8. that was full among torns
[44:51] a day which when they are heard go forth
[44:55] and are choked with cares and riches and
[44:58] pleasures of his life
[45:00] and bring no fruit to perfection so so
[45:04] so so this didn't come out that way in
[45:06] in the last scripture we read there
[45:08] but this is what brought over here the
[45:10] torns
[45:11] all right the torns a day which when
[45:14] they are heard go forth and are choked
[45:16] now
[45:16] the it grows it start to produce
[45:21] but because of cares riches and
[45:24] pleasures of this life
[45:25] bring no fruit to perfection so this
[45:28] word fruit to perfection is loud
[45:32] it is big because you can't get nothing
[45:34] with the wayside
[45:35] they just fall and they're gone you
[45:38] can't get much with this tony
[45:39] don't talk about perfection wrong stony
[45:41] at all they shouting and jumping and
[45:42] happy happy happy and then they
[45:43] disappear
[45:45] the last two and there in mind
[45:49] we say in wayside we're saying stoney
[45:51] we're saying tony
[45:52] are we saying good wrong all of these
[45:56] four categories represent
[46:00] heart conditions
[46:03] or be grown
[46:06] so you have wayside ground stoning
[46:10] ground
[46:11] tony ground and good ground
[46:14] so all of these these four categories
[46:18] represent heart condition
[46:22] nothing is wrong with the word or
[46:24] nothing is wrong
[46:25] with the seed so let's continue
[46:28] verse 15 but but that on the good ground
[46:33] a day which in an honest and good heart
[46:38] having heard the word keep it
[46:41] and bring it forth fruit with patience
[46:44] no man when he lighted a candle covered
[46:47] with a vessel or put it under a bed
[46:49] but set it on a candlestick the day
[46:51] which enter may see the light
[46:53] for nothing in secret that shall not be
[46:55] made manifest neither
[46:57] anything hid that shall not be known to
[46:59] come abroad
[47:00] take heed therefore how you hear how you
[47:03] hear
[47:04] for whosoever hath him shall be given
[47:06] and whosoever hath not
[47:08] from him shall be taking even that which
[47:10] he seemeth to have
[47:12] the amplified of that last verse said be
[47:15] careful therefore
[47:16] how you listen for to him who has
[47:19] spiritual knowledge will more be given
[47:22] and from him who does not have spiritual
[47:24] knowledge even what he thinks
[47:26] and guesses and supposes that he has
[47:29] be taken away so here tonight
[47:33] we have the waysides
[47:36] these tonys the 20s and the good ground
[47:41] and i want you to understand tonight
[47:44] perfection
[47:46] is only coming out of the last group
[47:49] good ground this is brother branham
[47:53] and he's saying this from between exodus
[47:55] the seed
[47:56] that falls upon dry ground or upon rocks
[48:00] it will never do nothing hard stony
[48:04] heart
[48:05] that wants to be indifferent you ever
[48:08] encounter people who just want to be
[48:09] different they like to be different
[48:11] you say a they both be you say apple
[48:13] they bought you know they just don't
[48:15] want to be
[48:16] in harmony they want to argue they want
[48:19] to fight
[48:20] they want to be on the other side if
[48:23] they say up they sit down
[48:24] if they say in they say out they just
[48:27] want that
[48:28] just indifferent them they're not
[48:30] looking to harmonize
[48:32] they're looking how they could be so you
[48:34] know and this difference is what going
[48:35] to set them apart
[48:37] and in trying to be indifferent they're
[48:40] off-key
[48:41] they off-beat and then they probably
[48:43] talk about people who
[48:44] you don't want to be around they don't
[48:47] make you feel comfortable
[48:49] they don't make you feel welcome their
[48:52] spirit is not welcoming
[48:54] their spirit isn't different now their
[48:55] face might have a smile they
[48:57] might be normal they might be looking
[48:58] normal but what they give out
[49:01] their spirit atmosphere and that is
[49:03] where
[49:04] like the pentecostals quran says was the
[49:07] restoration of the leaves because when
[49:08] the devil eaten
[49:09] his back leaves the fruit first he took
[49:12] the fruit
[49:13] after the fruit was the leaves after
[49:14] these are the back which is the doctrine
[49:16] recovering
[49:16] and afterwards this life itself is what
[49:19] he eat so eat it right down
[49:21] so then afterwards go to the i restore
[49:23] so you have to bring back the doctrine
[49:25] which is the covering then you bring
[49:26] back the branches the leaves
[49:28] you get fruit yet you're clapping
[49:30] hallelujah glory glory glory
[49:31] so therefore the cactus behavior that
[49:34] people have when they have
[49:35] spikes on their lives and when they get
[49:37] close to them ouch
[49:38] because it's not a flow in life it's not
[49:41] an atmosphere
[49:42] of welcome this is the spirit of
[49:45] indifference
[49:46] so he said no but if it fall upon
[49:49] soft mellow ground of fate it will bring
[49:52] forth a
[49:53] christian bearing fruits of the spirit
[49:56] then he says some of the green wheat
[49:58] fell and grown the birds picked it up
[50:00] and others fell among torns and some was
[50:03] went on prepared ground
[50:04] or pre-prepared ground so he the last
[50:08] group
[50:08] program identified as pre-prepared grown
[50:12] now jesus you notice no man can come to
[50:14] me except my father draws him
[50:16] all the father give me will come he said
[50:18] now
[50:19] here is the predestinated plan is in
[50:22] plain view
[50:23] this should make his show tonight just
[50:26] as
[50:26] other seed the word of god
[50:30] is a seed and must have
[50:33] the grong prepared beforehand
[50:38] do you know that the seas season genesis
[50:39] was in the earth under darkness
[50:42] and when god said let there be light the
[50:45] light came and bring that seat alive
[50:48] so do you know that your heart has been
[50:50] prepared
[50:52] before let me better read it let me read
[50:54] it if there's to excite you i
[50:56] i don't know what will therefore if you
[50:59] sow seed just throw it any minute wrong
[51:01] it will do no good the birds will pick
[51:03] it up
[51:03] you threw it among tesla than torn it
[51:05] would choke up pretty soon jesus
[51:06] probably said so
[51:08] so the ground has to be made ready first
[51:12] okay your ground has to be made ready
[51:15] first
[51:17] and he says now he prepared you
[51:20] oh my
[51:23] so so god in sovereign grace
[51:27] prepares the heart first he prepared
[51:30] you before the foundation of the world
[51:34] to receive him in this age he
[51:37] foreknew you by his foreknowledge and
[51:40] ordained you
[51:41] to eternal life he knew you therefore he
[51:43] prepared you
[51:44] oh give the lord some praise and i just
[51:46] just stop right where you are right now
[51:48] and raise your hands and give god some
[51:50] praises he foreknew you
[51:52] that is why he prepared you to receive
[51:54] this word in this last day
[51:56] the baptist couldn't hold you you met
[51:58] this could know your catholic couldn't
[51:59] hold you
[52:00] and because i couldn't hold you you had
[52:01] to come out because your
[52:03] he prepared you and because he knew you
[52:06] oh my bless thank you lord thank you
[52:08] about tonight
[52:09] and then he said this here that is the
[52:12] reason
[52:13] you staggered out of these things and
[52:15] staggered into what you have
[52:17] now it was called leading you to the
[52:19] place
[52:20] where he has ordained for you to be if
[52:23] this groan isn't repaired beforehand
[52:25] it can't grow and that's the reason the
[52:28] seed of faith when you are preaching
[52:29] faith
[52:30] see the designers of the lord and see
[52:32] what takes place all the gifts of the
[52:33] bible
[52:34] people working themselves up how do i
[52:35] believe it and come up finally have
[52:37] disappointed
[52:37] the ground has to be for ordained and
[52:40] you know when it strikes it
[52:42] so i want to say it again perfection
[52:45] could only come
[52:46] to this last group and the lord told
[52:49] brother branham pick up heaven right
[52:51] and god give him these words he says
[52:54] what i'm trying to say to you the law of
[52:55] reproduction
[52:57] is to bring forth of its kind genesis 1
[53:00] 11
[53:02] in these last days the true bright
[53:04] church comes to the headstone
[53:06] will be a super race a super race super
[53:08] church
[53:09] as she nears the headstone here we go
[53:11] there will be
[53:12] so much like him in his very image in
[53:15] order
[53:17] to be united with him now we know what
[53:19] the image is right
[53:20] faith virtue knowledge temperance
[53:21] patience godliness vertical is charity
[53:24] such a perfect man right they will be
[53:27] one they will be the very
[53:28] manifestation of the word of the living
[53:31] god
[53:32] i'll just skip over them the first son
[53:34] was spoken seed word
[53:35] of god fulsome he was given a bride
[53:39] to produce himself see she fell
[53:43] the bride was given the purpose to
[53:45] produce himself
[53:47] again another son of god she felled
[53:50] by her breeding and it caused him to die
[53:54] the second son of jesus now a spoken
[53:57] seed word of god was given my bride like
[53:59] adam
[53:59] and before he could marry her she was
[54:01] formed
[54:02] she was put to free more agency like
[54:04] adam's wife to believe god wouldn't live
[54:07] and she doubted or don't die she did
[54:10] here we go
[54:10] then from yeah a little group
[54:14] of the true seed of the word god
[54:16] represent
[54:17] christ a beloved bride a virgin to his
[54:20] word
[54:21] notice he's not talking about church
[54:23] he's talking about the word now
[54:25] the true seed of the word and through
[54:27] them this bride
[54:29] and by them the bride will be fulfilled
[54:32] all that have been promised for his word
[54:34] in the virgin who knows no man made
[54:36] creeds
[54:36] or dogmas the word of promise is
[54:40] in himself like it was in mary
[54:43] god himself made manifest here we go
[54:46] hear the prophecy
[54:48] he will act himself by his own word of
[54:51] promise
[54:52] so to fulfill what has been written of
[54:55] him
[54:57] he said they will love him and will have
[54:59] his potentials
[55:01] for he is their head and they are his
[55:03] subjects subject to his head
[55:05] headship of christ as his notice what
[55:07] harmony
[55:08] jesus never did anything until the scene
[55:11] of the father
[55:12] of the father showed him first this
[55:14] harmony between god and christ in john 5
[55:16] 19
[55:16] so will the bride he show his word of
[55:18] life he shows
[55:20] her she receives it she never doubts it
[55:23] nothing can harm her not even that let
[55:26] me say it again
[55:27] this breath nothing can harm her not
[55:30] even
[55:30] death for if the seed be planted the
[55:33] water will raise it up again
[55:35] and i got a big great hallelujah here is
[55:37] the secret
[55:38] the word is in the bride
[55:41] and the mind of christ to know what he
[55:44] wants done
[55:45] with the word now that mind of christ
[55:48] there is the intelligence
[55:50] so that is charity that is dynamics
[55:54] that will be the capstone that will be
[55:56] the supreme anointing
[55:58] coming down upon the bride to show her
[56:01] what he wants done with the word
[56:03] and she does it in his name she has
[56:06] thus saith the lord then it is
[56:08] dramatized so the holy spirit waters it
[56:11] until it's grown and serve its purpose
[56:15] it is again so she has dusty lord one
[56:19] then it is dramatized so it's starting
[56:22] from seed
[56:23] so the holy spirit waters it one soul
[56:26] another water but
[56:27] god gives the increase waters it until
[56:30] it is grown and serves its purpose
[56:34] they only do his will this is the bright
[56:36] now
[56:37] they only do what his will no one
[56:41] can persuade them different they have
[56:44] thus said the lord
[56:45] what they keep still then they will do
[56:47] the works of god
[56:49] for it is is himself in them continuing
[56:52] his word to fulfill as he did compete in
[56:54] his days
[56:56] as he did complete in his days oh
[56:58] blessed be
[56:59] given some praises tonight give him some
[57:00] worship tonight oh blessed be the name
[57:03] of the lord
[57:04] no it's so unique in one of the texts i
[57:06] believe it was
[57:07] matthew same chapter 13 and we're going
[57:09] to get back to it
[57:11] right after jesus gave this parable and
[57:12] he explained this power of the soul
[57:14] he dropped another parable on them and
[57:16] if you want to find it that's matthew 13
[57:19] verse 24. very interesting how he did
[57:22] this
[57:23] so he identified the first probably
[57:27] red sword the power of the soul of these
[57:30] four heart conditions
[57:32] wayside hearts stony hearts
[57:35] tony hats and heart that is good
[57:39] the other scripture we pick up in luke
[57:41] showed that this the
[57:43] tony cannot bring fruit to perfection
[57:46] so we know that once you are loved
[57:49] listen carefully
[57:50] once you allow the cares of life riches
[57:53] pleasures
[57:54] to tie you up you're not really getting
[57:57] fruit to perfection
[57:59] you might get some kind of fruit yes but
[58:00] not what is required
[58:03] so what is required by god fruit of
[58:05] perfection something 34
[58:08] 64 100 fold but jesus
[58:11] brought another parable matthew 13
[58:14] reading from verse 24 to 30. and another
[58:18] probably put fortune is that the kingdom
[58:19] of heaven is like not a man
[58:22] which sword could see in his field
[58:25] but while men slept his enemy came
[58:30] and saw tears among the wheat i went
[58:32] this way
[58:34] when the blade was sprung up and brought
[58:36] forth fruit then appeared the tears also
[58:38] so the servants of the householder came
[58:40] and said unto him sir this is that
[58:42] thou so good feeling seed and i feel
[58:46] from whence then had it tears
[58:49] he said unto them an enemy had done this
[58:52] the silver inside of him without them
[58:54] that we go and guide them up he said me
[58:56] at least while you guard up the tears
[58:58] you root up the wheat with them let
[59:01] boat grew together until the harvest
[59:06] and in the time of harvest i will say to
[59:10] the reapers
[59:10] gather you together first tears buy them
[59:13] in bundles to burn them
[59:15] that guarded the wheat into my own bowel
[59:19] so this here is a different thing
[59:21] altogether
[59:22] this here is jesus sharing that another
[59:26] seed
[59:27] was introduced after the good seed was
[59:29] sold
[59:32] another seed was introduced after the
[59:35] good seed was sown
[59:36] this is what happened in genesis who put
[59:38] adam a seed
[59:40] a pull out eve a rib they fell
[59:43] and then all of a sudden you get another
[59:45] seed that is why
[59:47] with cain when seth was born
[59:50] the bible said and god has given him
[59:52] another son that set
[59:54] replaced ibel that died it wasn't that
[59:57] sep was
[59:58] kane's brother set replace either
[1:00:01] so whatever way of getting it right
[1:00:05] in terms of his purpose will stand
[1:00:08] regardless
[1:00:09] his purpose for your life will stand
[1:00:11] regardless regardless of what trap
[1:00:13] what smears what failures what
[1:00:15] shortcomings
[1:00:16] once your name is on that book and god
[1:00:19] has elected you in this hour for that
[1:00:21] eternal life
[1:00:22] nothing will stop the purpose of god in
[1:00:23] your life do you believe that tonight
[1:00:26] oh blessed be the name of the lord let's
[1:00:28] look at matthew chapter 13
[1:00:32] and let's continue verse 36 where jesus
[1:00:36] explained this parable
[1:00:37] verse 36 to 43 we're going to read
[1:00:39] matthew 13 and then
[1:00:40] then jesus sent the away went
[1:00:43] into the house
[1:00:45] and his disciples came on them saying
[1:00:47] declare unto us the power of the tears
[1:00:49] of the field
[1:00:51] he answered and said to them he that's
[1:00:52] what the good seed is the son of man
[1:00:54] bullseye make no mistake about good seed
[1:00:57] salaman
[1:00:58] in charge of that easy so anytime you
[1:01:00] see santa man you have good seed
[1:01:03] the field is the world and here we go
[1:01:08] the good seed are the children of the
[1:01:11] kingdom
[1:01:13] so do you see how god see you tonight
[1:01:16] as a good seed could we give the lord a
[1:01:20] shout on that one tonight
[1:01:21] right in your room right in your house
[1:01:24] he said watch
[1:01:25] the field is the world the good seat are
[1:01:27] the churn of the kingdom
[1:01:29] but the tears are the chair of the
[1:01:31] wicked one the enemy that saw them is
[1:01:33] the devil
[1:01:35] the harvest is the end of the world and
[1:01:38] the reapers are the angels
[1:01:40] as therefore the tears are gathered and
[1:01:44] burning the fire
[1:01:45] so shall it be in the end of this world
[1:01:47] the son of man
[1:01:48] shall send forth his angels and she
[1:01:51] shall gather out of his kingdom
[1:01:52] all thing that offend and them which do
[1:01:55] iniquity and they shall cast them into
[1:01:57] fullness of fire
[1:01:58] they shall be willing national teeth
[1:02:01] then shall the righteous shine forth as
[1:02:03] a son in the kingdom of their father
[1:02:05] what heir let him hear but a broner
[1:02:08] he said notice in verse 41
[1:02:11] the two are very close in the last days
[1:02:14] he could not depend on some student
[1:02:15] church to separate them
[1:02:16] methodist baptist pentecostal just no
[1:02:19] you say he was sent as angels to
[1:02:20] separate them
[1:02:22] an angel is coming to bring the
[1:02:24] separation
[1:02:26] the separation between right and wrong
[1:02:28] no one can do that but the angel of the
[1:02:29] lord
[1:02:30] he's the one that's gonna tell which is
[1:02:32] right which is wrong and god
[1:02:34] said he will send his angels as the last
[1:02:36] time not angels done true here but
[1:02:38] angels at the last time
[1:02:40] and he would gather together we know at
[1:02:43] the coming half this time an angel is
[1:02:45] really a messenger
[1:02:46] and we see there are seven angels of the
[1:02:48] seven churches
[1:02:49] to the church ages notice who he said
[1:02:52] that the swords were
[1:02:54] also what the seed was the sower was he
[1:02:57] the son of god
[1:02:58] who went forth so in seed an enemy came
[1:03:00] behind him which was the devil
[1:03:02] he sowed a seed of discrepancy behind
[1:03:05] the sowing of the right seed and friends
[1:03:09] that has happened to every age since we
[1:03:11] have had a world
[1:03:12] all the way from the beginning no he
[1:03:14] said the seed of
[1:03:16] god the word of god and jesus said in a
[1:03:19] certain place that the word is a seed
[1:03:21] and every seed will bring forth after is
[1:03:22] kind hallelujah
[1:03:24] now if the christian the children of god
[1:03:27] the children of the kingdom has become
[1:03:29] the seed of god
[1:03:31] then they must be the word of god okay
[1:03:34] if you stop right there it would look
[1:03:37] like just word
[1:03:38] seed almost like if it's text and just
[1:03:40] knowledge and information
[1:03:42] but this is what continues here i'll say
[1:03:44] it again
[1:03:45] if the children the children of god
[1:03:49] the children of the kingdom has become
[1:03:51] the seed of god
[1:03:53] then there must be the word of god the
[1:03:55] word of god
[1:03:56] manifested in the age that they're
[1:03:58] living in for the promised seed of that
[1:04:00] age
[1:04:01] god give his word at the beginning and
[1:04:03] each age
[1:04:04] has its seeds its time
[1:04:07] and its promises now when noah come
[1:04:10] forth
[1:04:10] he was the seed of god the word of god
[1:04:12] for that age when moses come
[1:04:14] he could not come with noah's message it
[1:04:16] wouldn't work because it was the seed of
[1:04:18] god at that time
[1:04:19] and when christ come he could not come
[1:04:21] at noah's age or noah's time message
[1:04:24] no so we have lived through luther's age
[1:04:26] resilience
[1:04:27] all done through the ages the
[1:04:29] pentecostal age and each age
[1:04:30] has given a promise of the word and the
[1:04:33] people
[1:04:34] of that age here we go that manifest
[1:04:37] that promised wood is the seed of that
[1:04:39] age
[1:04:40] let's think a little bit the people
[1:04:44] of that age that manifest
[1:04:47] that promised word is the seed of that
[1:04:51] age
[1:04:52] according to what jesus said here they
[1:04:54] are the children of the kingdom
[1:04:56] and then he made a statement the
[1:04:58] manifestation
[1:05:00] of the holy spirit operating through his
[1:05:03] children
[1:05:05] is those seed of the kingdom
[1:05:09] at that time all right so watch
[1:05:13] the sower come to sow a seed
[1:05:16] but that seed have to unfold that seed
[1:05:19] have to ripen
[1:05:20] mature die unfold
[1:05:24] until it becomes manifested
[1:05:28] and the manifestation of the holy spirit
[1:05:31] operating in those children are the
[1:05:33] seeds so all of a sudden
[1:05:35] it changes from what the source so
[1:05:38] to the seed being made manifest in your
[1:05:42] life
[1:05:42] could we say amen oh hallelujah
[1:05:45] do you understand that so after is not
[1:05:48] the seed
[1:05:49] in the bible it's not the seed and
[1:05:52] spoken with books
[1:05:53] the seed you become the seed manifested
[1:05:56] or
[1:05:56] the word manifested or you become the
[1:05:59] living word itself
[1:06:00] and that makes you deceived for the age
[1:06:02] be sewer
[1:06:04] the seed the ground now for this process
[1:06:08] to work this spoken word which is what
[1:06:12] came out the mouth in revelation 10.
[1:06:16] seven thunders after their voices it it
[1:06:19] roar out
[1:06:20] that is what catch the bride them
[1:06:22] thunders
[1:06:23] that is what gives the bright field
[1:06:25] those thunders that is what showed about
[1:06:26] how to repair
[1:06:27] those standards it came out from the
[1:06:29] amount of god not some man in america
[1:06:32] the mount of god the mighty angel the
[1:06:34] one with the sweat backwards
[1:06:36] the one with the seventh seer that
[1:06:38] spoken word
[1:06:39] is the seed that comes into you
[1:06:42] and that seed is just a perfection seed
[1:06:45] oh glory okay next year tonight
[1:06:47] that seed has to begin to work itself
[1:06:49] out
[1:06:50] to bring you into perfection because
[1:06:53] that is where this
[1:06:54] sewing is about no farmer is sowing not
[1:06:57] a reap
[1:06:58] no farmer isn't suing not to have a
[1:07:00] harvest every single farmer that's who's
[1:07:02] looking for others
[1:07:04] this is a law since in genesis nobody
[1:07:06] here planting and they expect nothing
[1:07:09] it's just that sometimes it fall on the
[1:07:10] wayside but it's taken
[1:07:12] sometimes they fall on the stones they
[1:07:14] jump up for a while and dry up
[1:07:16] sometimes fall among torns but what he's
[1:07:18] really interested in is the good ground
[1:07:21] because only good ground is the way you
[1:07:23] get fruit
[1:07:24] some 34 some 64 some 100 fold
[1:07:29] all may not bring forth at the same
[1:07:30] measure but
[1:07:33] fruit is guaranteed on the good ground
[1:07:36] listen it is guaranteed on your good
[1:07:39] groom
[1:07:40] oh could we give you some praises
[1:07:41] tonight i hope this encourages you
[1:07:44] and let's continue now
[1:07:47] now the green seed in the original fella
[1:07:49] nicea
[1:07:50] it was the first denomination notice
[1:07:53] here the life
[1:07:54] here we go that was in the stalk in the
[1:07:57] tassel
[1:07:58] now ends up in the seed so not what he's
[1:08:00] talking here now
[1:08:01] is the unfolding of the life the devil
[1:08:04] crushed the church
[1:08:05] through the dark ages it went on to grow
[1:08:07] devastated finish
[1:08:09] that time we know coming up the life
[1:08:12] they can turn forward
[1:08:13] to the tassel is tall now the original
[1:08:16] is the seed
[1:08:18] the pasta is not like the seed this talk
[1:08:20] is not like the seed
[1:08:21] but the life have to unfold and this
[1:08:24] life
[1:08:24] unfolding is the revelation of the seven
[1:08:27] churches
[1:08:28] so put it simply the revelation of the
[1:08:31] seventh church ages
[1:08:32] is the revelation of the unfolding life
[1:08:34] of the seed
[1:08:35] through seven ages where the seed goes
[1:08:38] on the ground
[1:08:39] and actually it unfold itself until they
[1:08:42] come back to the seed in the last days
[1:08:44] that is why this message had to be
[1:08:45] perfect this message had to be
[1:08:47] perfection
[1:08:48] you could have to come back to the
[1:08:50] original so only
[1:08:52] gift could bring this message in his
[1:08:55] last day was a prophet
[1:08:56] because the word of the lord come to the
[1:08:58] prophet and the spoken word of god
[1:09:01] which is original seed have to come from
[1:09:02] the mouth of god man
[1:09:04] shall live by bread alone but by every
[1:09:06] word that proceeded to the mouth of god
[1:09:08] so god's more peace was a prophet that
[1:09:11] had to be on the earth
[1:09:12] to bring spirit given word word that
[1:09:15] cannot be challenged
[1:09:16] because it does save the lord so what we
[1:09:19] have tonight
[1:09:20] is a dossier the lord message despite
[1:09:23] all the craziness on the internet
[1:09:24] and negan brother branham and negan what
[1:09:26] he did and negan
[1:09:28] message we despite all of that this
[1:09:30] message is true
[1:09:31] it will come to pass oh praise all the
[1:09:34] prophecies that were spoken
[1:09:35] shall surely come to pass so let's
[1:09:37] continue
[1:09:39] let's continue the life that was in the
[1:09:41] storm castle
[1:09:42] ends up in the seed the life that comes
[1:09:45] out of the original seed
[1:09:47] comes through different processes
[1:09:50] three different processes and then
[1:09:52] turned back
[1:09:53] in its original condition and then brown
[1:09:55] said hallelujah oh my
[1:09:57] i am the happiest person in the world
[1:09:59] that god will let me see this watch how
[1:10:02] perfect
[1:10:03] the word and nature works together the
[1:10:06] life
[1:10:06] that was in the husk in this talk in the
[1:10:10] tassel
[1:10:10] gathers up in the seed and the life that
[1:10:13] was in the stalk
[1:10:14] one went to make the other then he says
[1:10:17] this year
[1:10:17] justification made away for
[1:10:19] sanitification certification
[1:10:21] made a way for the baptism of the holy
[1:10:22] ghost and the baptismal holy ghost
[1:10:24] made a way for the holy ghost itself
[1:10:28] to come down right down
[1:10:31] imperfection and back to the word my
[1:10:34] my my my my oh give him some praises
[1:10:38] give him some praises tonight wow
[1:10:41] hallelujah
[1:10:43] thank you lord jesus thank you lord
[1:10:45] jesus blessed be the name of the lord
[1:10:48] hallelujah hallelujah oh blessed be the
[1:10:52] name of the lord keep worshipping them
[1:10:53] sins
[1:10:54] please be to jesus there is a lie
[1:10:56] tonight wow
[1:10:59] thank you lord thank you lord
[1:11:10] all of a sudden it seemed like
[1:11:11] everything that seemed to have just
[1:11:13] disappeared just like that
[1:11:15] this is really kind of weird but god is
[1:11:18] good
[1:11:19] all right we see what's happening here
[1:11:20] now
[1:11:24] right
[1:11:26] okay here we go so watch no okay so
[1:11:28] justification we may have with
[1:11:30] certification
[1:11:31] solidification made away for the
[1:11:32] bathroom holy ghost and the batman holy
[1:11:34] ghost made a way for the holy ghost
[1:11:36] itself
[1:11:37] to come right down in perfection
[1:11:40] and back to the word again to manifest
[1:11:44] itself
[1:11:45] so so so he's seeing that we have got to
[1:11:48] come to this
[1:11:49] where we get to connect back with the
[1:11:51] holy ghost itself not the gift of the
[1:11:53] holy ghost but the holy ghost itself
[1:11:56] so here we go now the tassel or the
[1:11:59] puddle then the husk then the husk
[1:12:01] comes the original seed not a seed it
[1:12:03] was the life
[1:12:05] of the seed growing through this to come
[1:12:07] to the seed
[1:12:08] do you see it what is it a resurrection
[1:12:12] coming back to a masterpiece again
[1:12:15] pentecost came out of wesley
[1:12:17] because presley was an organization
[1:12:19] pentecost came out
[1:12:20] as an organization then turned to one it
[1:12:23] had to
[1:12:23] to make the husk the true word of life
[1:12:26] on it was on this way
[1:12:27] to the original green through these
[1:12:29] stages to the stalk
[1:12:31] through the pollen into the husk and
[1:12:33] then it was made seed
[1:12:35] now let me wrap up here
[1:12:39] the stock castle husk
[1:12:42] they produce they were a holder
[1:12:45] of a certain portion of that sea life
[1:12:48] but when they
[1:12:49] organize life move out of it
[1:12:52] how many understand that when the
[1:12:55] churches denominate
[1:12:57] and life leave them there is no way for
[1:13:00] god to get back in
[1:13:02] because god could only move by the word
[1:13:05] so when a man put an interpretation to
[1:13:08] the word
[1:13:10] the spirit can't move it almost like if
[1:13:12] you switch
[1:13:14] from an electric wire and put a pipe put
[1:13:16] a pvc pipe
[1:13:18] current car flow to the pvc pipe so it
[1:13:21] comes like you cut the line
[1:13:22] and you replace the if the line to carry
[1:13:25] the current
[1:13:26] with some other line that is what
[1:13:29] interpretation does
[1:13:31] that is why the holy ghost was born at
[1:13:33] the
[1:13:34] river euphrates by queens and dogmas
[1:13:36] because god couldn't come back in
[1:13:38] the dogmas would not allow him to move
[1:13:40] back in
[1:13:41] the only way god can move back in is to
[1:13:43] get back on the word
[1:13:44] and that is why he talked about this
[1:13:46] angel
[1:13:48] right the manifestation of the holy
[1:13:49] ghost is that angel
[1:13:51] trying to get the people back to the
[1:13:52] word because he could only manifest the
[1:13:55] word he could only work through the word
[1:13:57] so all these years god have been trying
[1:14:00] to protect us
[1:14:01] from interpretation man's idea man's
[1:14:03] influence
[1:14:04] number six now number six i'd like to
[1:14:06] reign and rule
[1:14:08] over others i have no temperance himself
[1:14:11] so therefore that has been challenged
[1:14:13] and that's the whole nicolaitan spirit
[1:14:14] anointing
[1:14:15] the pope anointing the roman anointing
[1:14:17] the bishop archbishop and the iraqi
[1:14:19] anointing
[1:14:20] that looked over into the message and
[1:14:22] influenced so many lives
[1:14:24] wrongfully because you see the bride
[1:14:28] is not the bride of a man he's a wife of
[1:14:30] the lamb
[1:14:31] that's who you are tonight oh blessed be
[1:14:33] the name of the lord so let's go let's
[1:14:34] continue you know
[1:14:36] notice the seed is coming up that life
[1:14:39] is coming up
[1:14:40] not going back there'll be no more
[1:14:41] resurrection after this the life is
[1:14:43] coming up to go
[1:14:44] into its perfection a resurrection so
[1:14:46] you could now understand why brother
[1:14:48] branham says
[1:14:49] without perfection there's no
[1:14:50] resurrection think about it now
[1:14:53] not church now we have to come to
[1:14:56] perfection
[1:14:57] which is that joseph seed made manifest
[1:15:00] okay let me on your own church right now
[1:15:03] okay
[1:15:05] to understand this subject more clearly
[1:15:07] it will not be wise to approach it from
[1:15:09] the standpoint of the church through the
[1:15:10] ages
[1:15:12] up until now we have been thinking in
[1:15:14] terms of removal of names of individuals
[1:15:16] now we want to consider not the
[1:15:17] individuals
[1:15:18] but the groups represented in the church
[1:15:20] to do so
[1:15:21] we would liken the church through the
[1:15:23] ages to the weak plant
[1:15:25] a grain of wheat is planted to the end
[1:15:27] that a single grain of wheat
[1:15:29] will reproduce and multiply itself
[1:15:31] through a certain process
[1:15:33] during a certain period of time that
[1:15:35] single seed will die
[1:15:37] but in dying the life that was in it
[1:15:39] will come up into a plant
[1:15:41] which in turn will be the bearer or
[1:15:43] carrier of that life
[1:15:45] which is to come back to originality in
[1:15:48] a multiplied form
[1:15:50] jesus the great royal caesars died
[1:15:53] that much less one with the life of the
[1:15:56] church
[1:15:56] stands in the midst of the church for
[1:15:58] all 72 ages giving his life to the
[1:16:00] church
[1:16:01] the carrier or the bearer to the end
[1:16:04] his very life will be reproduced in
[1:16:06] bodies like unto his in the resurrection
[1:16:09] it is at the resurrection that the royal
[1:16:11] seed will see
[1:16:12] many royal seeds like unto himself and
[1:16:14] they will be even as he is for soul says
[1:16:17] john we shall
[1:16:18] be like him that is what john was
[1:16:20] referring to
[1:16:22] now the record of this week plan here we
[1:16:24] go
[1:16:25] whose end is to reproduce the original
[1:16:29] seed
[1:16:29] in multiple form is the book of life he
[1:16:32] talked about the record i repeat
[1:16:34] and this is the bomb the history or the
[1:16:38] record of this wheat plant is
[1:16:42] the book of life of which a part of the
[1:16:44] book of life
[1:16:45] is the record of eternal life a section
[1:16:48] of the book of life
[1:16:50] this is convincingly seen by examining
[1:16:52] the wheat plant
[1:16:53] a beer seed is sown soon a blade is seen
[1:16:56] but that is not the wheat yet
[1:16:58] then it grows into a stone that is not
[1:17:00] yet to eat
[1:17:01] life is there but not wheat then at the
[1:17:04] end of this talk
[1:17:05] is a little spike that sends out a
[1:17:08] tassel still a wheat plant but no
[1:17:09] weekend
[1:17:10] then the plant is pollenized we see the
[1:17:13] chaff grow
[1:17:14] this looks mighty like the wheat but
[1:17:16] it's not yet seed
[1:17:18] then forms the wheat in the husk it is
[1:17:21] now back to what is originally
[1:17:23] now the wheat is ripened the ripening
[1:17:25] which is harvested
[1:17:26] now jesus christ died he gave his life
[1:17:29] that life
[1:17:30] was to come back upon the church and
[1:17:31] bring many sons like him unto himself
[1:17:34] into the glory of the resurrection but
[1:17:36] as the wheat seed had to have a carrier
[1:17:38] there we go to bring forth multiplied
[1:17:41] wheat seed
[1:17:42] even so there had to be a church which
[1:17:45] would be the
[1:17:46] carrier of the life of christ as the
[1:17:49] blade stalked castle and husk
[1:17:51] were the carriers for the seed but
[1:17:54] not the seed itself oh excuse me
[1:17:58] so the church corporate through the ages
[1:18:00] has been the carrier of the true seed
[1:18:02] do not deceive itself that is why
[1:18:06] we can see the book of life is the whole
[1:18:09] week plan let's go it over again here is
[1:18:12] the original wheat plant that was
[1:18:13] planted
[1:18:14] it produced a blade that wasn't it it
[1:18:16] produced a stalk not it either
[1:18:18] become the husk which is wheat is to
[1:18:21] form
[1:18:21] that isn't it the tassel appears and
[1:18:24] then the pollen falls on those pistils
[1:18:26] part of that plant is quickened
[1:18:28] something of that original seed that
[1:18:30] came up
[1:18:32] through the rest of the plant turns into
[1:18:33] a seed why didn't the whole plant go
[1:18:34] into seed
[1:18:36] because it was created to that end as
[1:18:38] part of that plant can go back to being
[1:18:41] seed because
[1:18:41] just that part of that wheat plant is
[1:18:44] eternal life wheat
[1:18:46] you have a perfect type israel even
[1:18:48] egypt they all came out two million
[1:18:49] strong all escaped the sacrificial blood
[1:18:51] all the baptized at the red sea all came
[1:18:53] up in the water enjoying holy ghost
[1:18:55] manifestation
[1:18:56] all eat angel food all drunk of the rock
[1:18:58] that followed them yet except for a few
[1:19:00] they were not
[1:19:01] but carriers of the children who should
[1:19:02] follow them and go into the carrick
[1:19:04] canaan land
[1:19:05] all israel is not israel just a tiny
[1:19:07] minority but their names are blotted out
[1:19:09] to the book of life
[1:19:10] we have the same thing today in church
[1:19:12] names are going to be blotted out of the
[1:19:13] book of life no names
[1:19:15] will be blessed out of the book of
[1:19:16] eternal life but that is another record
[1:19:19] do contain in the book of life this is
[1:19:22] the record
[1:19:23] god had given us eternal life and that
[1:19:25] eternal life is in his son
[1:19:27] he that had the son had life eternal he
[1:19:29] that had not the son had not life
[1:19:31] eternal
[1:19:31] and those who have that life or in him
[1:19:35] before the foundation of the world they
[1:19:37] were chosen him
[1:19:38] before the foundation of the world that
[1:19:40] great royal seed
[1:19:42] jesus christ was planted he died and
[1:19:44] that life that was in him
[1:19:46] here we go oh glory this is great that
[1:19:49] life that was in him came up through the
[1:19:52] wheat plant
[1:19:53] and is reproducing itself in multitudes
[1:19:56] of wheat seeds
[1:19:58] having the same life in them and being
[1:20:00] like the original
[1:20:02] here we go because by spirit they are
[1:20:05] original
[1:20:06] not by book but by spirit
[1:20:10] they are original so to go back to
[1:20:12] perfection
[1:20:13] we have to go back to the original
[1:20:14] spirit which come by the original word
[1:20:17] which produced the original seed
[1:20:19] so the original seed brought the channel
[1:20:22] of the original word
[1:20:23] that the spirit could flow and that is
[1:20:25] why an adoption he says where god can
[1:20:27] say
[1:20:28] dear is my spirit flowing freely because
[1:20:31] the man have no
[1:20:33] hidden agenda no hidden motive newton
[1:20:35] object a
[1:20:36] hidden objective he manages that pipe
[1:20:38] and you would
[1:20:40] make him that type because he died
[1:20:42] himself and he become a pure
[1:20:44] channel of communication for inspiration
[1:20:45] to flow through so goku said there is my
[1:20:48] spirit flowing freely
[1:20:49] i'll find one i look i'll find the next
[1:20:51] one here we're gonna find the next one
[1:20:52] here look at
[1:20:53] that one here i'm gonna do with church
[1:20:54] then i'm gonna do it with camps in this
[1:20:56] camp
[1:20:57] and that next campaign you're hungry
[1:20:58] with that i have to do a man
[1:21:00] on god and the word of god okay so let
[1:21:03] me see look at him
[1:21:04] is he home straight here right now now
[1:21:07] here we are coming to conclusion
[1:21:09] as the eternal logos god was manifested
[1:21:13] in the sun
[1:21:14] and then jesus dwelt all the fullness of
[1:21:17] the goddess bodily
[1:21:19] and that eternal one was the father
[1:21:21] manifest in flesh and thereby gain the
[1:21:23] title of son
[1:21:24] so we here we go eternal in his thoughts
[1:21:27] in our turn became the many-membered
[1:21:31] spoken word seed manifest in flesh
[1:21:35] and those eternal torts now manifest in
[1:21:38] flesh
[1:21:39] are the sons of god even as we are so
[1:21:43] called
[1:21:46] we did not become seed by the reboot
[1:21:49] we were seed and therefore were reborn
[1:21:53] for only the elect can be reborn because
[1:21:56] we were seed
[1:21:58] as a reason we could be quickened in
[1:22:00] non-seed
[1:22:01] there is nothing to quicken or give the
[1:22:03] law some praise on that
[1:22:05] oh glory to god the holy ghost doesn't
[1:22:06] make your seed it's because you are seed
[1:22:09] you can be reborn all right
