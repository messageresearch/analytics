the last time we're singing Hallelujah we singing sing Hallelujah Hallelujah give him a shout of praise shall We rise to your feet I want to read from um Deuteronomy chapter 8 and Deuteronomy chapter 9 all right iy 8: 1-20 and then 9: 1-4 this is um uh because we're talking about the kingdom of God and what um was always the comp of the kingdom of God anyway we we'll get to you let me not keep you standing too long um Deuteronomy 8 and verse1 okay like I've explained over and over and like as you know if you like you know uh um get your Bible and study it and know what this the history and things are Moses wrote the first um five books of the Bible Genesis Exodus numbers and Deuteronomy and um the children of Israel you know wanted Journey to the promised land and the whole 34 or so chapters of Deuteronomy took place in a period of one to two weeks just one to two weeks because what it was was Moses was doing a review of their journey and their existence in the kingdom of God and they were now going to enter the land that's flown with milk and honey the Land of Plenty the land where there was going to be a flow and so he wanted to remind them of many things and in the book of Deuteronomy a lot of times it was said like and remember don't forget remember don't forget remember don't forget because God knows what's going to happen in the in the in the new land could make them forget him and so he won them ahead of time and all of these things took place in one or two weeks and this was like in the 11th month of the 48th year after they left Egypt and um they spend the the last week of that 11th month to mourn Moses and in the first week of the 41st year the record is that or history says that Israel entered the promised land Cross Jordan and entered the promised land may be [Music] seated all right so Deuteronomy 8: 1-2 all the Commandments which thank you very much musicians thank you all the Commandments which I command the this day shall ye observe to do that you may leave and multiply and go in and possess the land which the Lord swear unto your fathers and just keep in mind what he had told Adam you know because they're going to these were in types of what they had lost in Eden so God was you know showed in every tap and Shadow in the Bible so you have told Adam fruitful multipli of do you being dominion and this is the same thing here to possess and take it all over being Dominion in the land and rest two and thou sht remember all the way which the Lord thy God LED thee these 40 years in the wilderness to Humble thee now I want you to notice because I I may not get to you because I may think talking too fast not not really I have my thoughts to get to you but I'll try but you know this this is God telling them the purpose of the Wilderness the purpose of all their difficulties all their challenges and things in the wilderness years and thou shall remember all the way which the Lord thy God LED thee this 40 years in the wilderness to Humble thee and to prove thee to prove the means to test you to see what's in your heart to give you a challenge and see how you um get over that to prove you the test you um and to know what was in thine heart whether thou wouldest keep his Commandments or no and he humbled thee that was God doing that amen it wasn't because they were in the wilderness it was God doing it and he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger that they were hungry was because they were in the wilderness or because God couldn't provide food in the wilderness come on he brought water from a rock he sent Mana from Heaven he he he could have given them a fat cow proess every single minute but God withheld that for a purpose he had a purpose in withholding that to Humble them he actually let them go hungry for a purpose and he humbled thee and suffer thee to to hunger and and fed thee with manner this is God speaking and telling them what was going to the purpose the reason why not what others are saying but what the prophet Moses the mouthpiece of God was telling them and he humbled thee and suffer thee to hunger and fed thee with manner which thou knewest not you didn't even know how it came he provided for you neither did thy fathers known so it's not like my father got it for me no has nothing to do with that oh yeah it's my father my father is this he has nothing to do with that are you hearing me has nothing to do with that it's actually said call no man here father it doesn't mean we disrespect the parents but God's purpose is all to keep our eyes on him is he wants to be the source the only one in our orbit he wants to be the champion of Our Lives he say I'm a jealous God I don't want to share with anybody at all come on honey I want you for myself and myself alone amen your fathers knew didn't know this that he might make thee know that man do not live by bread alone bread only Jesus quoted this but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of the Lord do man live so all of this hunger all of these difficulties in the wilderness had one purpose to turn their eyes on the cross to turn their eyes on God to turn their eyes on [Applause] Jesus not to complain not to mumble Israel complained plenty but this is God telling them now the reason why they were sh of food sometimes they were sh of water sometimes he wanted he tells them he wanted to get to their hearts to that they might know that man does not leave by bread alone but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God can somebody shout hallelujah hallelujah amen amen listen verse four thy reignment works not all upon thee so it's not that I couldn't provide you fruit remember the Mana fell from heaven and they were to get it for one day alone if they try to get for extra day it's spoiled and there's a reason for that it's spiled oh boy so he's telling them for 40 years I took care of you so it's not that I couldn't give you food your garment didn't works all you had only one change maybe or two but it was sufficient because I came kept it from getting worn out your garments did not watch upon the neither did their foot swell this 40 years in other words you are not barefooted H you had your shoes on and your shoes did not for 40 years your shoes did not have holes under their feet I just preserve them for you amen that's the kingdom of God that's God's [Applause] Kingdom [Applause] verse five thou shall also consider in thine heart that as a man chasten his son so the Lord thy God chasteneth thee therefore Thou shalt keep the Commandments of the Lord thy God to walk in his ways un fear Him for the Lord thy God bringeth thee into a good land you're coming to a good land something good is about to happen is just ahead of you but before you go there I want to warn you I want to war you so that when you are full you will not forget [Applause] me so that I'll make sure I be sure I have you in my I have you under my control before I bless you with the blessings in the land of that's flowing with milk and honey because that land is just ahead of you all the unbelievers have been wiped out your daddies and all the mommies and all the unbelievers all the mix mon they have been wiped out but you are a new generation and we are crossing clean over into the land of promise but when you get there remember don't forget remember remember don't [Music] [Applause] forget for the Lord thy God bringeth into a good land a land of Brooks of water this is is describing the land to them a land of Brooks of water of fountains and depth that spring out of valleys and Hills this was in the land that's what Joshua and Caleb saw say it's a good land it's from me honey and I say it's a good land it's f with make honey hallah but those guys those 10 spies said they saw giants but Joshua and Caleb saw Springs and milk honey flowing in the land oh hallelujah amen the new land the son of man it's flowing with me can honey oh it is no secret I met the prophet the son of man I follow him a son of man veiling the son of man the new land amen the son of man [Music] [Applause] amen a land of Brooks of water of Fes and depths that spring out of valleys and Hills a land of Wheat and Bley and Vines and fig trees and pomegranates a l of olive oil and honey this is the milk and honey flowing here this was been spoken to people who for 40 years all they had was quails Mana that's all they had they had just enough just enough but now they coming to a land of abundance they're coming they're coming into abundance in the new land so because God knows what abundance can do to you he warning them ahead of time abundance can make you begin to trust in Vin reaches is warning them ahead of time verse n a land wearing thou shall eat bread without scarceness no scarcity No Lack is abundance in this land this is the milk and honey that's going to flow out of the land so you can imagine when they people go into the land and they saw enemy land en enemies there they f this is this is a scam this is 419 where where is the milk FL where's the milk and honey here um um Elan verse n Elan when thou shall eat bread without scarness th shall not lack anything in it a land whose stones are iron wow the stones are iron that's what he's saying a land uh um and out of whose heels thou mayest dig BRS is telling them where the milk and the horn is [Music] hidden when thou has eaten and at full then thou shall bless the Lord thy God for the good land which he had given thee beware when you are fool that thou forget not the Lord thy God in not keeping his Commandments and his judgments and his tattoes which I command thee this day you I told you many of you don't even have the money to finance you don't have the resources to finance sin So when you say loss for money loss for women L of poity this is a Deb to believer wait until you have the in your hand in your [Applause] pocket and that's why people once they get some small change their shoulders go up and they begin to forget the Lord their God all his T is the values [Music] change God made us so he knows what we are capable of he knows what the fall did to men they had of men when you come into plenty you see the attitude you see the arrogance you see they see what do you call it Swagger right see the Swagger change Swagger your Swagger should let me leave that alone let me leave that alone let me leave that alone all right but you get the picture right all right so verse 11 beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God in not keeping his Commandments and his judgment and his statutes which I command thee this day lest when thou has eaten a full and has built goodly houses and dwell therein that's the promised land that's the land of abundance it's a flow it's flowing it's not dripping it's flowing with milk and honey when you have built goodly houses this is the kingdom of God these are the principles of the Kingdom Hallelujah and build and dwell therein these were people who are dwelling in tents for 40 years this some these children he was talking to had never known what he felt like to have a Home of Their Own and they're not been told they're going to build goodly houses they're going to live in mansions of their own and knowing what those things can do to the human heart God's warning them ahead of time because God doesn't judge Man without warning him first verse 13 and when thy hurts and thy flux multiply fruitful multiply replenish subdue I mean replenish that's refill refill your inventory and and subdue so you can be you can come into Dominion H H uh verse 13 and when thy hurts and thy flocks multiply and thy silver and thy gold is Multiplied and all that thou Hast is Multiplied seeking first the kingdom of God and his righteousness first that's your lifestyle that's your vision that's all you are about it's not just in church that's your lifestyle do you hear me it's your lifestyle that's the style of your life the Styles change today is to today's Hep hip hop tomorrow is so music they go back again to like you know rap music whatever but they keep changing times and Seasons but you remain constant in your lifestyle the style of your life is constant seeking God chasing God God is your god is the god is the is the thir of your heart of your life is your Soul's desire every single second of every single minute of every single day 24 hours 7 days a week 52 weeks in a year 12 months in a year 365 days a year all the days of your life God is your lifestyle can you say [Applause] Amen not when you are in church is your lifestyle when you get among the boys your lifestyle is something different when you get among the girls your lifestyle is different you paint your face and you you you you have all that stuff around you boys and girls fathers and mothers to timing God like a spiritual prostitute keeping God and keeping the world keeping God and keeping a worldly lifestyle but your lifestyle is not your lifestyle is not coming to church your lifestyle is Jesus Is My Lifestyle that's the purpose that's what God is telling them just the way in the wilderness when you had nothing and you had to depend on me every day for your food for your meal you are going to just you knew you needed me because you were empty in your pocket when I bless you don't forget me because you are going to need me so much more because the Land of Plenty will offer you its own challenges too because there you going to the in the Land of Plenty you are going to be promoted to face bigger problems you're going to face Giants now there are no Giants in the wilderness but now you're going to face Giants don't forget me remember me remember me remembering the Lord remembering Jesus don't forget Jesus don't give me in some Corner remember the Lord that goes for fathers mothers sons daughters that go for every one of us from the poop it to the back door balcony basement everywhere that goes for every one of us remembering the Lord amen God is pleading pleading literally begging don't forget me the Creator begging is his worthless creation don't forget me [Applause] wow and when that hurts I think I read that already verse 14 let me RSE again when th hurs and thy floods multiply and thy silver and thy gold is Multiplied and all that thy H is Multiplied then thine heart shall be Li then then thy heart be lifted up and thou forget the Lord thy God which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage who led thee through the that great and terrible wilderness wherein were fiery serpents and scorpions and drought where there was no water who brought thee forth water out of the rock of Flint speak to the rock it could have just spoken and and a seven course menu will be there all your all your all your fantastic eies in v and Ley all that will just appear before he could have spoken all that but he didn't do it for purpose because you want them to know they needed him want them to be able to sing to him I need him now more than ever before I need him now more than I ever did in my life oh I need Jesus now more than ever more than ever I need Jesus that's what he was trying to drum into them who fath in the wilderness with manner verse 16 which the father s knew not he's repeating that to them again that he might humble thee and that he might prove thee to do the good at thy latter end are you at your latter end you think it's too late no it's never too late it was all God's hands look nothing happens to you everything happens for you if you only know the reason the purpose why those things happen and it's all in the Bible the Bible tells me so the Bible has all the answers it's not a story it's not just a story the story of redemption it is real brother it is real sister the story of redemption oh brother amen now watch but thou shall remember the Lord thy God oh oh no verse verse verse 17 to prove they the L the latter end so it's never too late get that there there are things anyway verse 17 and so when you have all these things going for you and you begin to say in thine heart my power and the might of my hand have gotten me this wealth God telling them you are going to a land of wealth not riches wealth the Bible warns against riches because the rich only think about accumulating money the wealthy think about getting wealth which is really the what there is not get is creating wealth sorry you got to forgive me I got to my jacket okay are these air conditioners on okay but it's okay I think I leave them the sisters can get cold too cold sometimes so I'll I'll manage all right um and thus seeing then have verse 17 that my power and the mind of my hand ha gotten me this wealth my degree my this my that my skills my my whatever my this have gotten me this wealth wealth I mean and when we didn't do that many times it's just you know very good very good pay or something not talking wealthy air but even when you talk wealthy air is one you don't get the the power of my hands got me this don't get there and you'll understand as I go on in the story all right but thou shall remember the Lord thy God for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth now that word get in the Greek really is to create at wealth because get when you say I get it from you it's like somebody's getting something and somebody's losing something get wealth get it like deprive somebody or something and I get it no it's the creation of wealth that's what they that's what uh um the Greek really expounds to you and I or the original you know um verse for it is he that giveth thee power to create wealth that you may establish his Covenant which is swear unto thy fathers at it as it is this day and it shall be if thou do do at all forget the Lord thy God and walk after other gods when you full and you are prospering and serve those other gods and and worship them I testify against you this day that you shall surely perish as the Nations which the Lord destroyed before your face so shall you perish because you will not be obedient un the voice of the Lord your God chapter nine here oh Israel thou are to pass over Jordan this day to go in to possess Nations greater and mightier than thyself see this see this great and fence up to heaven if Israel look use their eyes how would they even come at Jericho Jericho's walls were so thick it said that they could they could they could you could have a uh what you call it the safari car races of about six to eight Lanes on those walls of Jericho that's how massive they were that's right and it was walled up was so high also how are they going to get in there rck tag Army of about 2 million people 40 years and below and some two old men or a few old people Joshua and Caleb but the Zeal of the Lord of hosts his passion his energy which is come by the holy spirit will perform this it will be a no contest it will be just in his in a twinking of an eye in a spirit second stand that's the god that we serve can you praise Him Just Praise Him Just Praise Him in your own way just just raise your hands and praise him and thank him H just bless his name no I'm

going to meet verse two a people great and Tall Giants Giants the the children of the anakims God is telling them more getting more you may be seated getting back to tell them those spies said the children of the anakims that they are giants who are like grass sers before them and so God took their words you'll see those tall people there but I just told you when you get in the promised land and you have all these wealth it doesn't mean challenges of life are on a way no man that is born a woman is over a few days and his life is full of troubles so your challenges just you get promoted get all these great things in life but you're going to have challenges there you're going to have Giants there to slay you're going to have giant problems there you're going to have giant opportunities there what are you going to do with them run into your shell that's what he's telling them I am the Lord I'm leading the way oh Hallelujah a great people and T the children of the

giant problems maybe you have a giant in your life he doesn't have a Goliath but a giant a problem that you just think insurmountable that's who he talking about and what have you said before the Lord what have you said before the Lord these Giants are s like that God cannot Deliver Us from them or God cannot deliver them into our hands amen understand therefore this day that the Lord thy God is he which goeth over before thee as a consuming fire he shall destroy them and he shall bring them down before thy face so shall thou drive them out and Destroy them quickly as the Lord has said unto thee you will destroy them quickly not not it not going to take 30 years quickly [Applause] Israel had these promises yet they still failed just like we do verse four speak not thou in thine heart after that the Lord thy God had cast them out from before thee saying for my righteousness the Lord had brought me in to possess this land just like the work of your hands didn't get you the wealth your righteousness didn't get you the victories it's not because you prayed that's why you got anything it's not because you fasted that's why you got anything it's not because your great faith that's why people were healed there's nothing like that it's all because of Jesus it's because of Jesus Jesus died and God looks at him and he answers our prayers because he seen Jesus he's not seeing you and

you take care of them you back them up the only problem here is that we come from that Kingdom and we don't trust our government to take care of [Music] us therefore you may be seated speak not th in thine heart after that the Lord thy God had cast them out from before thee for my righteous that God brought me in to possess the land but it's for the wickedness of the Nations the Lord brought uh the Nations that the Lord do do the Lord do drive them out from before the like we were speaking last week go wanted Israel to be paric with him to fulfill his word to the amorites when their sins are full God will destroy them and give the land to Abraham's seed but Israel's unbelief in spite of this admonition in spite of all the preaching in spite of all the admonition people are so bent in their own evil ways not for the righteousness verse 5 or for the uprightness of thine heart does thou go to possess their land but for the wickedness of these nations the Lord thy God doth drive them out from before thee that he may perform the word which the Lord spake swear unto thy fathers Abraham Isaac and Jacob understand therefore that the Lord thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess you for thy righteousness for thou are a stiff necked people and he went on on like that may Lord his BL the of his holy words amen let me just read quickly con scripture I have Exodus 9:37 and mo went up to God this was where God was going to establish a covenant with Israel to he brought them out of Egypt to be a people a nation to himself a nation where God and his people and they're going to have a system of government where God was going to be their God and going to speak to them through his prophet and he was going to take care of them them all they had to do was follow him wholly there going to be a royal priesthood it was going to be a nation of priests it was when that failed when the people quickly fail that's when God turn over to the tribe of Levi Aaron's children and made them a tribe of of of priests but when Christ died and rose again what Israel refused to be the New Testament Church the bread of Jesus Christ now is 1 Peter 2:9 I think I think I read it last week for you I Ro show forth the glory to show forth his thus shall thou say to the house of Jacob and tell the children of Israel you have seen what I did unto the Egyptians and how I bear you on eagles wings and brought you unto myself now therefore if you will obey my voice inde did and keep my Covenant then you shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all the people for all the Earth is mine amen and you shall be unto me a kingdom of priests that's where it was not just a tribe of a kingdom of priests and an holy nation these are the words which thou shallal speak unto the children of Israel and Moses came and call for the Elders of the people and laid be and laid before their faces all these words which the Lord commanded commanded him and like Israel said all that the Lord has said we will do and quickly they violated it but Jesus restored the this back and made us 1 Peter 2:9 a kingdom of priests we are priests and Kings unto our God a holy nation a royal priesthood we don't need no set high priest to come before the Lord we don't need the th me we have the word of God and we have Jesus the high priest of our confession that can lead us into the god plan of God not once a year but any time any any hour of a day or night we are free to come into His presence we is royal priesthood A peculiar people what he wanted to display with Israel is not displaying with his bride but unfortunately many people in The Bride just like Israel of old all right so this morning um um um I spent long time already like 30 minutes reading the scriptures but we pick up from where we left last Sunday about the kingdom of God being a theocracy which is God's form and system of government can you see God God bring this people out God is a god of order he brought them out so there's a government there's a chain of command there's a hierarchy of command there's a line of authority not a line of superiority line of authority from God to Moses to the Elders of the people Aon and the Elders of the people down to their tribes God is a god of order God's system of government a theocracy and theocracy had always been God's um system of government since the gun of Eden because God desire was to be with his people God in Christ Christ in the bride God in authority and in Supremacy and in pinenes in their lives that's all you desire so this was the system of government even in Eden a theocracy we have a democracy today in Many Nations and you know I'll get to that so as CH went on from from Eden and the fall all nations develop all other forms of government the monarchy Empires federalism socialism communism democracy and number of those are still in existence till today because you see that when Israel went to Egypt Egypt was ruled by a king not a theocracy they had a human King and when Israel said to the prophet Samuel we want to be like the other nations so God's people had a different set of rules and government to govern and guide them guide their lives because they were supposed to be a peculiar people to him not odd and peculiar people but a peculiar peculiar as in special the hand and the grace and the favor of God was upon them and anybody saw them could see the favor of God upon their lives amen men could see them and glorify their father in Heaven like they saw Jesus Jesus was in the temple the favor of God was he was a peculiar human being he was a royal person the The Whispers went around the Tabernacle and they said blessed be the womb that bore thee it was that special what manner of man is this here what manner of man is this the home that carried you was special blessed be the that's what God wants us to be and the child grew and increased stature and in favor with both God and man that's what we're supposed to [Music] [Applause] be but whatever the Sy of government of those Nations they all have a common theme common theme whether was Fidelis monarchy um Empire status at the time of Jesus the empire was Rome ruling over and had like you know Governors over the different places whatever the system of government socialism communism democracy whatever the same of government they all have a common theme and that common theme was around some form of quote unquote disguised slavery of the mass majority of the population no matter what the Bible's words I'll show you and this disguised slavery is summarized in 1 Samuel 8 and that's the summary that God gave Samuel when Israel rejected him and requested for a form of government like the other nations have and Sam was sad that the people are rejected him and go said no Samuel it's not you they rejected you're not the king you're only the prophet and the judge but I'm the king I tell you and you tell them but it's not you the re ultimately I'm the one they have rejected just like they mmed against Moses and God said it's not Moses Moses said you are not Ming against me you are mming against God say it's God there God said someone step aside it's me they are rejected not you and the one came give let let let them have their heart's desire let them have their wish give them a king but let me tell them what the manner of King they're going to have let me tell them what the king whoever the king is saw or whoever whatever is going to be go through Israel's history whether it was Judah or Israel whatever the northern kingdom Southern Kingdom and watch how many of the Kings really serve God watch how many of the Nations the world really align themselves with God hardly any so he was talking not just about that day he was talking about of all times the kind of the kind of government they are going to have when they reject is making clear God's type of government and the human type of government whatever you want to call it US democracy social democracy you know uh um um tury democracy what ever you know Islamic whatever it's whatever system of government Russian communism Socialism or whatever they call it now you know whatever it is God summarized and gave them the characteristics of that government what that government was going to look like I won read you can read that you can read it 1 Samuel chter 8 the whole chapter vers 1- 22 I'll show you what they let tell them what they are going for when they reject my type of government and he told them is some form of organized slavery your sons your daughters and all that you can read it your time so but before Israel got to that spot where they asked to be like all nations God was their King they lived in God's economy they lived in God's theocracy system of government God was their ruler their king and the head of their government in each of their lives as individuals and in the home as a collective and in the nation as a nation God was their lord and King amen and God's form of government from Eden was always a theocracy before the fall and even after the fall God kept a theocracy in place with only minor variations to suit uh uh that was dictated the divisions were by the um Covenant we have with his people whether it was you know a conditional Covenant or it was a unconditional Covenant it was always there in place that theocr God the head and the people he is subjects not subjects like the Gentiles do but his subjects who will love him and he will be in love with a love aair in other words partners partners like husband and wife so in God's theocracy in God's form of government the people sered him with their whole hearts and lives they live by his righteous laws that was all they had to do that was all he required them to do that was all and in response to them doing that God supplied all of their needs for food for clothing shelter so this is the backdrop all have been saying about the wilderness and all that and all this is a backdrop for Jesus saying seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness let the kingdom of God be your lifestyle morning afternoon night in your sleep every time let the kingdom and the principles of the kingdom of God the righteousness of God Amen be your LIF child and when they do that God will supply all of their needs for food for clothing and for shelter and this arrangement of the theocracy worked excellently well in Eden Adam was in subjection to God God was in premen over him and he was in Prem over the Earth he had everything that he needed all I have needed thy hand I provided Great Is Thy Faithfulness morning by morning new mercies I see and this this Arrangement even after the fall that Arrangement was kept in place like I said and it was on for God's people until Israel God's chosen people rejected his theocracy his form of government and um opted for a for government by man whatever it is theocracy whatever they all the same thing some form of slavery the Communist say like that they are a collective they are like you know everybody has everything equal it's not true it's not true it's not true I read a lot of stories I read a lot of I read I read a lot of biographies autobiographies in the in the uh communist years the guys in government were living large they were living like they were living like they were living in the white house but the people on the street were living like popers for of slavery let's again to that we don't have to much time here don't want we have lot supp today all right but whatever the system of government it was all the same thing it was a form of slavery refined modified whatever it was slavery even the biggest Democrat in the world the US is a form of slavery the Americans say you just walk for Uncle Tom that's right whatever the St of government that's what it is anyway um um many examples abound in scripture both in the Old Testament and New Testament of God's people living in his theocracy in his economy and because when Israel rejected God and chose to be like all nations it devolved into in the individual having God living in God's Kingdom in his in his um uh under his form of of government a theocracy individuals not Nations now not Israel not Nations now and so the favor that will be on Israel for living the theocracy that favor now devolve onto the individuals who will live in God's economy but you got to know what that means to live in God's economy you got to know what that means because many of us claim we're living in God's economy but we're not we're living in our own economy and that's why nothing happens for us and we putay it on God and not judging you I'm just going to let you see like that so you don't think oh what I'm saying we been living in God no you have not been no you have not been no you no you have not been and I'll show it to you no you have not been so I want you to listen to me real good amen not because I'm s you don't know but maybe you have never really taken to you so let's follow um um the children of Israel as they in their Journey so will be able to understand what living in God's economy looked looked like then and what it looks like still today amen because the New Testament did not cancel out the old it only Amplified it it only expand it only magnified it but let's even see if it can get to the level the standard that they had which we supposed to live at an amplified magnified level beyond what they had so Israel you know uh let's follow their journey and they live in this theocracy just like their F father Adam lived in like their father Abram and the Patriarchs their forefathers lived in but quickly before we get to Israel Adam in the beginning lived in God's economy in a theocracy all Adam and Eve Leed to do and same thing same principle same set of rules same set of laws that governed it same thing that economy works in your heart the same way works in my heart some Nation practice democracy different from the next nation and they all practicing democracy you know our nation we have democracy we copy the American St of democracy tell me another one I sometime we CH to call it homegrown democrac why don't understand about people and that's what you guys a lot of you people did during the elections and you get into that racial bigotry thing people who belong to the nation the kingdom of God because of some politicians because of their tribe they stepped out of the kingdom of God and started attacking one another in the same home who come to the same lot table like we're going to do tonight all Adam and Eve needed to do was to serve God fully and holy because this system was the same thing is the same principle in Eden as it is in Your Heart Right Now Nigerian democracy under bhari is different from under tinubu American democracy under Donald Trump from under Biden because the principles they say are the same but the man runs it the way he fits his agenda one supports lgbtq one says no one supports big government one supports small government one supports Social Services one says no and they all practicing democracy but not God God is the same constant it doesn't change I am the Lord I change not what he said at the beginning is always the same he doesn't have a better idea than he had at the start because he's the perfect one that's the kingdom we belong to the kingdom of the most high the kingdom of the most high no shadow of variableness with it no variability no variableness no changing according to the Shadows in this Kia remains constant as constant as constant as constant can be as constant as the northern stair amen so all ad man even to do was to serve God fully and holy live in his righteousness that was always there seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all they needed everything they needed for living natural and spirit spiritual life was added to them because the operative verb the op operative spirit in this kingdom is a kingdom of addition is a kingdom of increase it's a kingdom of abundance that's the Opera what in this kingdom here is not subtraction it's abundance it don't take from you that's slavery they take from you you may not be a SL they take from you but in God's kingdom he adds to you serve him and he adds to you and his kingdom in your heart of his of his increase there shall be no End Amen we receive a kingdom which shallot be shaken everything is going to be shaken but a kingdom we receive cannot be shaken the kingdom of the most high God which kingdom has sent you fora as Moses with his crooked Seck he said the kingdom of the most high the kingdom of the most high oh Hallelujah I have a father wonderful father I boast about him I tell you about him glory glory you may feel sorry for me just hang around a while that's who my father is that's who my father is Glory I trust is your father too oh Hallelujah we have a father I will not leave you offence I will come to you I will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and I'll bring my kingdom into your soul Hallelujah and you'll know you are the Son and the daughter of the king of kings and the Lord of lords oh Hallelujah glory glory to God oh hallelujah amen you may be seated amen everything they needed both for life for godliness was added to them food a home a shelter a beautiful Garden of Eden for life was added to them the authority and the control of the earth that they needed to exercise on the Earth in God's stead as amatal God's creators innovators with wisdom on this Earth here was added to them for godliness oh hallelujah amen Adam's life before the fall demonstrated what God was like you may be seated Adam's Adam's life before the fall demonstrated the goodness of God the mercy of God Adams Liv with God and viewed God through the lens of goodness many of you view view God through the god of a strick father who just has a stick when you do anything wrong he's breaking your head Adam did not see that kind of a god Adam saw a father who was a good father he punishes sin but that's when you don't listen to his words when you don't listen to his warnings but in his basic relationship with his children he's a good God I say he's a good God isn't he amen wisdom is a good God isn't he he's a good God isn't he amen he's a good God right he is a good God Amen Joel he's a good God isn't he sure he's a good God Amen I ask you he's a good God isn't he he's a good God isn't him oh your goodness and mercy is running after is running after him I'm running after him come to be my last he's running after me what a relationship oh what a king what a love what a love story oh it's not just a story friends this is real brother this is real sister this is [Music] [Applause] real come with us come with us come with us we will do you good for the Lord has spoken good concerning the kingdom of God and the kingdom of God is within you is in your heart [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] may be [Music] seated So Adam demonstrated what God is like his goodness his Mercy his kindness his loving and tender care towards his children toward all of his creation and his provision for them and his ability to provide for them in super [Music] abundance and so Adam and Eve prospered I not lack one thing until the fall Abram and the Patriarchs they also lived in God economy under theocracy and they prospered all they do was chased after God not chased after these things that the Gentiles chased after chased after God and all these things that J has chasen after were added unto them it comes with a territory Moses and the Hebrew children let's follow this nation of Israel now and going to listen to me really really Clos and if it's if it gets to too late I'll close I mean I want you need to get this so you'll be able to understand where you are right now so you to understand how to make the kingdom of God work for you even in a tough economy even the if you work for them in the wilderness sure it can work for you [Music] here and how it will work for you and you begin to create wealth that's what the promised land represented for he gives you power to create wealth remember that the children of Israel the Hebrew children were slaves in Egypt Moses was the next to the throne he gave all that up and joined the M do as the slaves they was SL in Egypt but even at that God made sure they not live by Egypt's economy instead they live by a totally different set of rules in God's economy in the land of Goan you might not know it from the economics because they were slaves they were limited in what they could do on the economic front but in terms of the politics of the day in terms of the uh uh the wars of the day the the disasters the natural disasters of the day the judgments the plagues God showed the living totally different economy because while all the plagues were falling in Egypt the land of Goan was protected he didn't come near them a thousand can follow your right and 10,000 the left hand but it shall not come neither how many still believe that how many still believe [Applause] that the economic and political Wars and plagues all of disasters that were fing in Egypt did not touch them but notice notice this very one important notice even though and this is very important CU that's going to be a theme right down to this day even though they live by God's economy but but because they were slaves the economy of men the go government of man that Israel opted for later because they were slaves it's important that I point out to you that the economic circumstances because they were slaves were such that they never had enough they had food to eat because they go got make sure about that because they were in the wilderness they were boasting to Moses we would to go we went back to Egypt and to the gaks and G Al and onions of Egypt but they never said they never had enough which slave has enough no that's the system of these economies they never had enough but at least they had the licks and garlics and but once they had in the wilderness that's why when it comes to church their AR are so different when it gets to Egypt they're so grateful for the little that they have and they are boasting about it when it comes to God they say you you told us this you where's the milk FL with milk and honey hang [Music] [Applause] [Music] on hall hallelujah amen so even though they live in God's economy that ensured they had food but because they were slaves as it is in these economies they never had enough in terms of having their nement they never had enough which slave has enough but the God is El Shai you know what El Shai means a double breasted one Hallelujah the god of more than enough which is in the promised land not even in the wilderness they never had enough in terms of having their need men simply why because they were slaves they were God's people but they were slaves Hall and they were F simply by God's provision through the whims of others all the people determined their pay what they were worth what they got the food they ate their task Masters because that's the economy of man and they never had enough but at least God s to it that they were fed and then they moved out God's Mighty hand broke down the barriers the ch of bondage in Egypt and they moved out in the wilderness Journey to the promised land and Moes and the Hebrew children the children of Hebrews Contin to live in and by the economy of God in the wilderness still it was God's provision not what they had to do themselves not what they had to do themselves under the economy of man it was the whims of others what others thought they deserve is what they gave them the Egyptians gave them food even though they lived in God's economy when it came down to the Brass jaacks the plagues and things didn't touch them but because they were slaves they didn't have the capability or the capacity or the opportunity to provide food for themselves and so God ensured that they had enough I mean they had food but was never really enough because no slave ever has enough but in the wilderness even though they live I mean they they they came out and they were living under the economy of of God now directly directly and let me ask you what economy was there in the wilderness were they in any particular Nation they went through Nations that's why I uh let me leave that alone they went through Nation different nations different lands and every obstacle in their way they overcame including the Red Sea they overcame it and God it was God economy that they went through so but in this economy they were fed directly by God himself not from anything they had to do very important notice here notice fed by God himself nothing they had to do but it was God's economy or how could they have had food water clothing Health Care protection for 40 years shoes on their feet clothes on their back for 40 years didn't lack one single thing not one sequ one among them except when they sin and they serpent you know beat them and all of that but not one sign among them no flu no cold no covid no headache no cancer nothing not in the economy of God none of that stuff because he told them none of these diseases which are put upon the Egyptians shall come among you how many can still believe for that [Applause] today is the god of more than enough but here they were in the wilderness in the wildness they had just enough they came from Egypt never enough to the wildness just enough if the slave at in Egypt and he didn't have more food he had to wait for the next day but in the wilderness they had enough food they could gather all they wanted but it was just to last for one day the economy of God he'll take care of you he [Music] will but that's not that's not the end goal they never for 40 years no wonder David said the Lord is my shepherd I shall not War I shall not lack no good thing will will he with withhold from them that that trust him amen amen in the wilderness no supermarkets no grocery stores no restaurants nothing no no presidential spokesman no no Pala lives none of that stuff just God and his people alone in the Kingdom of the most high God the kingdom of God oh no no houses to liveing none of that stuff yet they were protected oh my God fed them supernaturally fed them have you felt that way many times amen the food is low this is that and God somehow comes through for you oh my what economy was that the economy of the kingdom of God got show me one nation in the world where the people none of them had a lack for 40 years show me one let's let's be fair one year one year no let's be fair one month show me one economy in the world throughout human history where not a single person in the land would have a need for health care for provision for food for shoes for clothes for one month no for one day show me one nation in the world in all history you won't find one you won't find one because there is none holy as the Lord there is none beside thee none none but notice notice notice and I'm trying to see where I can wind on the clothes notice even with all that Supernatural provision from God they had just enough not abundance just enough they had just enough food for the day and that was it if they try to be greedy and take more God made sure that he spul my gods Came Upon it there's a reason for all that except for the weekend for the Sabbath days the food will keep so it was God that was doing that amen you know the reason why they couldn't keep more and all that abundance the flow was not for the Wilderness it was a promise for the promised land because the Wilderness only represented Israel's training and Preparatory School in the kingdom of God they were called out and they were in training now because the promise is ahead of them that's always the pattern for the kingdom of God the Wilderness was the process that Israel had to go through before the abundance that the kingdom of God promised and the Wilderness is the process the training school of life that you and I have to go through before the abundance that the kingdom of God promised for you and I also the promised land that Israel was promised was the land of abundance in both life and godliness like I said already the book of Deuteronomy they were about entering the promised land now and Joshua was telling them about I mean Moses rather was telling them about all the things was doing a review like a debrief of all the past 40 years what God has done for them the God's purpose in sending them through the Wilderness let me see it was a training for them because God wanted their hurs before they will get the Land of Plenty God wanted to make sure they were spending their lives seeking first the kingdom of God and his righteousness making that their lifestyle before God will bless them before they would have the flow in the land of promise let's follow them to the land of that flow with milk and honey if you if you go through you'll see I said already but you see that the purpose of the trials the testings the hunger the humiliation how many times you been humiliated no fruit no rent whatever what and you say like that I knew it this religion means nothing to me but God let the Israel know I did that to humiliate you to Humble you so that you will turn to me your One Source we to have a cross to put somewhere in this church really so turn to me and face the cross and keep me in remembrance all the time when you at work when you are home when you are empty when you are low remember me when you are full especially remember me so he told he he told them like we read already and and I already explained the source of their trials The Source The Source trials the source of their testings the hunger was not the economy it was not the dry and non-existent economy of the Wilderness that dry and nonexistent economy of the Wilderness was only a tool in God's hands but economy was not the end it was a means to an end the end was God wanted to turn their eyes on him because when God needed to he gave them food in that same Wilderness he gave them water in that same Wilderness why did God keep the water away at the Waters of America until they asked why did he keep the food away until they asked him the source of all their tumor the economy was only a tool get me real good the economy is a tool is not the end the economy of the Wilderness was only a tool in God's hands the source of all their tumor of all their hunger the rocky times the Thirsty times the hunger the source of it was none other than God himself he said I made you hungry I humiliated you so that you will know that man does not live by bread alone but by every word that comes out the man of God so that you will have me in your heart that's the purpose no you don't get me the economy is there but you're not suffering because of the economy God allowed it why are you living at this time when the economy is like this [Music] why and just in case you think let me not get that let me let me just try to run quickly what I'm saying will be clear as I'm sure clear already but as we're going along because as though the rocky you know rough harsh and unpleasant circumstances they had to face in the wilderness was not enough on top of all that was Hunger was humiliation and all of these things here God is telling them was not because of the economy of the Wilderness because when God needed to he provided in spite of that economy he he overr overrode the hunger the Wilder I mean The Thirst the water lack of water they the drought he overr it when he needed to but he kept it the way because he needed to get to his children too many of you are wasting a crisis the crisis that you are in you are wasting it crisis when crisis comes is God's opportunity to get his children to run after him because that's the that's the best time that he can get your attention if he doesn't get your attention in times of Crisis he's not going to get your attention in terms of Plenty why waste a crisis why waste the crisis why waste the Nigerian economic crisis right now are you hearing me why waste the crisis why not use this crisis to run into Jesus why not use this crisis to fall in love with Jesus more than you ever before I keep falling in love with him over and over and over and over and over and over again why waste a crisis why waste any crisis at all crisis on your job where was the crisis let that crisis drive you into Jesus because that's the shortest time you are going to think about God not when your your belly is full and your table is full of something you are wasting this crisis you are wasting this crisis husbands are fighting their wives wives are fighting their husband there's no money there's no food you are wasting the crisis fall in love with Jesus run into Jesus hide in the [Music] Rock why waste a crisis the devil bring the crisis we let the crisis drive us to Jesus bring it on Satan Bring it on Bring it on bringing on with J to Jus because you know weeping men for night but joy comes in the morning the crosses is not going to last forever Joy is coming Joy is coming in the [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] morning yes hallelujah amen the part of the sitation in the wilderness in the midst of the crisis in the midst of this economic crisis or whatever the crisis you are in whatever it crisis the point of this of the sitation is that it was the hand of God he had a purpose in sending this specially designed trials each day of their lives while they walk through the Wilderness because they were living in God's economy what was it God was trying to get to their soul he was trying to use the purpose the economy was only a tool to withdraw from them so that they run to him many of you pray pray pray I want a job when you get a job the job is so important you even forget to pray with you too you don't have time now you just run away what it is here you are in the wild wild and that Wilderness is just a land of just enough it's not a land of abundance just enough if that's where you want to live stay there stay that but we are going to the promised land I said come with us we're going to the promised land the land of more than plenty more than enough is more than enough is El Shad the god of Plenty the all sufficient one God Almighty is more than enough oh Hallelujah H can I have 10 minutes amen amen you may be seated let's try to wind down here oh brother amen what was the purpose God was trying to get to their soul the inner man he was he was trying to get get to them with all this crisis to seek after him with their whole heart soul mind and strength first and foremost over and above all else to see him as their Source he will do everything so that your only provision comes because you look up to him I will look up into the heels for when cometh my help my source Cometh From The Lord which made Heaven and [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Earth you may be seated he was only trying to attract the attention fully and holy he was trying to get them to walk every single day with Jesus with him trying to build and grow their faith in him so they could walk with God because without faith is impossible to please God and Enoch walk with God because he had faith that pleased God so was trying to build their faith their trust in him don't look at these things around here look to me look to me look to me the source your Source level mind the resources I can bring water out of a rock I can send food down from heaven angel cake Hallelujah God was trying to get them to see him as the source of everything in their lives he was trying to get them to see that without him they could do nothing oh my that was the purpose of the hunger the humiliation the pain the seeming abandonment by God and that has been the purpose of your hunger your seeming abandonment by God but how have you used the crisis have you used the crisis to complain and Mumble that God's not taking care of you or have you even used the crisis to to run into Jesus I'm running I'm running I'm running into Jesus what have you been doing with your crisis what have you been doing with your crisis mumbling grumbling complaining like the mixed m in the wilderness or you are running to Jesus in the midst of your crisis listen Moses went through the same hunger a prince a prince a prince of Egypt went through the same hunger these were [Music] MERS a prince he did not complain about the younger because he knew the purpose while the hunger was there Aaron went through it uh Joshua kill on you never have them complain but this mixed multitude who have no regard for God at all every need every pain they complain about God where is God where is he we better go back to [Music] Egypt and that in the kingdom of God hallelujah hallelujah wow [Music] so they miss the purpose of the hunger they just got humiliated for nothing and they saw the humiliation as an end in itself but the humiliation the hunger was a means to an end and the president is they are running Justin trudo out of the land in in in in Canada right now they're on his neck the Canadian economy look Beyond any of those all of those things are just relative relative to what you have is better but in the context of what God wants for his children is too small too small doesn't even match up can you can I hear you say Amen no you don't believe it but if you believe it can I hear you say [Music] [Applause] Amen you know all this wave of

church Christmas greetings to the church and I want to take this quote from the prophet in the message that brother brandham actually preached on December the 22nd in 1963 God's gifts always find their places he said may the great Christmas present the first one and the only and the original and the only one there is Jesus Christ be a fresh in your heart tonight May the Holy Spirit come to you and bring you ministering gifts and things like we heard this morning from God a gift that you might live A Better Life that's what I want I would rather have the Life of Christ in me to live sweet and Victorious than I would have all the gifts of healing the gifts of prophecies all them other gifts Just Give Me Jesus let me live the life the life is what I want to live I want to live so others will know that's my desire at Christmas and I pray that's your desire and I pray that God will give you his desire so may the Lord during this Christmas we give you a great experience with the Supernatural and bless you and that through all of what's happening at this time you'll remember the Lord remember how he has kept you how he is keeping you and how he promised to continue to keep you
