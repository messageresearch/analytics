[26:07] Spirit will live itself true us and
[26:09] speak true us Lord may we remember in
[26:12] our minds as we walk along the street
[26:14] and rob arms of the world we are not
[26:16] supposed to be like those and we step
[26:18] aside and give them the police lord
[26:20] their rightful position on earth we take
[26:22] the backseat knowing we are delegates
[26:24] from another world we have a kingdom
[26:27] that is coming into power Lord and our
[26:29] great king will soon arrive and take
[26:32] over all the king that
[26:33] domine and he shall rule and reign with
[26:36] him here a thousand years forever but
[26:39] this in mind now we look forward to the
[26:41] answer for prayer we look to a
[26:43] confession if we have did anything sella
[26:46] meeting toward anything I was contrary
[26:48] to your great will let the blood of
[26:49] Jesus Christ cleanses lead us Lord as
[26:52] sister said tonight about unsworn by
[26:55] degrees and Lord nor we commit the
[26:57] service to you and the listening for
[26:59] your word of correction and we might
[27:02] know how to prepare for this great hour
[27:04] in Jesus name we ask what a prayer
[27:05] tonight Amen oh praise the name of the
[27:08] Lord and the script reread Paul wrote
[27:13] his letter to Philemon he was sitting in
[27:15] jail in a dungeon and a prison of the
[27:17] prisoner and Paul was not dressed in his
[27:21] physical condition even though he was
[27:23] physically in a prison he called himself
[27:25] a prisoner of Jesus Christ he actually
[27:30] eliminated the concept of what was wrong
[27:32] him as that ready hole in him and an
[27:36] identifying a greater power was holding
[27:38] him the Lord Jesus himself but the
[27:42] Prophet said we are born free moral
[27:43] agent and and and to make a decision
[27:47] what every season we wish to God justly
[27:50] does that he must put every man on the
[27:53] same basis free to make decisions and
[27:58] you know as the years roll by
[28:00] I see the decisions people make and the
[28:02] price that they didn't expect to pay for
[28:05] the decisions that they make decisions
[28:07] are tremendous the right ones it will
[28:12] come out right if you make the right
[28:14] decisions now we are born free
[28:17] he put know so he put man and free the
[28:21] big choices right and wrong sets before
[28:23] each one of us life and death we can
[28:26] make our choice it's up to you to make
[28:27] it and that's the way Adam and Eve did
[28:29] they made the wrong choice and put the
[28:33] whole race under the penalty of debt and
[28:35] then God came down at the Forum man and
[28:37] took that debt and pay the penalty of
[28:40] death his subjects are desired to be
[28:42] free could go free
[28:44] now he took us without the same is it
[28:47] Adam and Eve and death pull us to
[28:49] something I save you whether you want to
[28:51] be seen or not
[28:51] then he put Adam on even the wrong basis
[28:54] you see but each one of us has to choose
[28:57] you choose to come service tonight and
[29:00] you could choose to have the right
[29:01] attitude you could choose to leave at a
[29:02] breakthrough you could choose to leave
[29:04] her it's something from the word tonight
[29:05] that's your choice you choose and I
[29:09] choose to try the serenity lord catch
[29:11] the my night goal or what to present to
[29:13] you tonight to bring the word to you
[29:15] tonight that it will help you and edify
[29:17] you and strengthen you each one of us
[29:19] has to choose this day between death and
[29:21] life we can do it now your life will
[29:25] prove exactly what side you're on
[29:28] I don't care what side you see you on
[29:30] what you do every day proves what you
[29:33] are you heard the whole scene your life
[29:36] is so loud I can't hear testimony your
[29:39] actions is so loud I all believe in
[29:41] shouting and jumping but I always
[29:43] believe don't jump no higher than you
[29:44] live because the world is gonna watch
[29:47] that you must just jump as high as you
[29:50] live because somebody is watching you
[29:52] people don't come to church some of them
[29:55] don't because this seems so much a
[29:58] corruption in church until they don't
[30:00] have nothing doing it many times is flat
[30:04] you can hardly blame them because of
[30:05] people act the callings of Christians
[30:08] they are the greatest stumbling block
[30:09] that the rulers got is a man and woman
[30:12] who profess to be Christian and lift
[30:14] something different from the profession
[30:15] he says that the disappointments when
[30:18] judgment wouldn't be for the drinker the
[30:20] gambler the adulteress when they hear
[30:22] this sentence read depart to everlasting
[30:25] fire he won't be disappointed but that
[30:27] fellow who's trying to hide himself
[30:29] behind some kind of church profession
[30:30] that's the boy is going to be
[30:32] disappointed in the day of judgment that
[30:35] professes to be a Christian and live
[30:37] somewhere away that's the greatest
[30:39] stumbling block we got is for professor
[30:41] that's he's a Christian and live
[30:43] something different here we go
[30:45] always not sometimes always always don't
[30:51] judge your life by how much power you
[30:54] have to perform there
[30:56] we don't judge ourselves by how much
[30:59] knowledge you have of the word but
[31:03] always judge yourself look back taking
[31:07] inventory of what kind of fruit that
[31:11] your life you Presley live is not better
[31:14] and somewhere along the somewhere along
[31:18] the line it seems that this word life
[31:20] has been pushed in a corner and
[31:23] information and knowledge and revelation
[31:25] and mysteries has come forward but I
[31:29] think what Isaac was preaching Christ
[31:31] could be presented as wood and he is the
[31:33] wood Christ can be resented that spirit
[31:36] or he's a spirit Christ could be
[31:38] presented as a person he's a person also
[31:40] what do you want him to be to you
[31:42] tonight hallelujah he spoke about a
[31:46] little kid I never saw him here before
[31:49] when by his grandma and he went to his
[31:52] house and he saw a mirror and he saw a
[31:55] little boy in a room he see a little boy
[31:56] in front of him the little boy was
[31:58] running also he stopped a few minutes
[32:00] and what the little lad was doing he
[32:04] turned his head the boy tune is head he
[32:05] scratches hit the boy scratch his head
[32:07] finally walk closer to investigate and
[32:09] he turn around and his mother watching
[32:11] him he said grandma why mother that's me
[32:15] why he saw a reflection of himself
[32:19] whatever he was doing the mirror was
[32:21] doing too and that is how we have to
[32:23] become when you look in the world you
[32:26] have to begin to see a reflection of
[32:28] your life we too are reflecting
[32:32] something our life is reflected now
[32:36] Jesus he ignored the scribes and the
[32:39] Pharisees and yet his life was
[32:42] scriptural oh we think about that he
[32:46] completely ignored it yet
[32:49] he was perfectly with the scripture but
[32:51] not in the way they knew it what side
[32:55] would you have took your life that you
[32:57] live now reflects just how you would
[32:59] have done then because you are still
[33:01] possessed with that same spirit if you
[33:03] take that side now and then you
[33:05] have done it then because he's the same
[33:07] spirit and you know was in them people
[33:08] then the devil never takes his spirit he
[33:11] just goes off from one man unto another
[33:13] and God never take his spirit neither it
[33:16] grew from one to another so that is why
[33:19] Jesus cuz it as was in these are Noah so
[33:22] shall has been a diesel in Solomon
[33:23] because jesus knew the same devils and
[33:25] demons and spirit now as the noise days
[33:27] will be chopping on in this lasts a year
[33:29] and if no one make it you wanna make it
[33:32] if he not make it you wanna make it or
[33:35] glory to God all em heroes of hit-making
[33:37] you wanna make it because God has
[33:39] released a spirit to make sure you call
[33:41] these like old we believe that do you
[33:45] believe that this is real enough oh yes
[33:48] you are being influenced influencing it
[33:53] in the earth from above and below or
[33:56] glory to God you are privileged to have
[33:58] a in France I'm above strike you that
[34:02] you can hear this message and hear this
[34:04] word so the holy spirit upon Christ come
[34:07] upon his disciples all down and still
[34:09] upon the people God never takes his
[34:12] spirit but we are left with a choice so
[34:14] Paul wasn't regretting anything he
[34:16] wasn't sorry was a prisoner he was
[34:19] addressing the church and wrote this
[34:20] letter because the Holy Spirit was
[34:23] causing him to write that he could
[34:25] express it by scene waters are wrong him
[34:28] he was in jail but that wasn't what he
[34:30] was speaking of he was a servant of
[34:33] Christ a minister with him he was
[34:34] speaking that he was a prisoner to the
[34:36] word of Jesus Christ because Christ is
[34:39] the word all glory to God a prisoner to
[34:43] the world I don't care what Bishop say
[34:44] what as Bishop saying what the Pope says
[34:47] what the president say what the Prime
[34:49] Minister say what the ministers
[34:51] Association say a prisoner to the Word
[34:53] of God are we gonna get that back down
[34:56] or plural Iran real manner God real
[34:59] woman are thought prisoners to the Word
[35:01] of God you may be seated priest
[35:10] hallelujah
[35:11] he had ambition great ambition Tomiko he
[35:17] was trained for it he finished college
[35:19] he graduated he had clergy he had orders
[35:22] written and trusted to go on to the mask
[35:24] us to find those at wilted God and all
[35:27] that he trained for God had to take that
[35:30] out of him what his objective ones what
[35:34] is father I spent money for the
[35:37] ambitions of his father his mother you
[35:39] know some people we father and mother
[35:40] put all the burden upon his children to
[35:42] be this they want him to be this and it
[35:43] wouldn't be captain they spend their
[35:45] money they wanted doctor they son tibia
[35:46] engineer you daughter to be a doctor
[35:48] this want to be a lawyer and they put or
[35:50] think about it now all the investment
[35:53] and God say X all the money gone on him
[35:57] because what see I call you for that I
[36:00] call it for something else
[36:02] I have a higher calling for you Oh glory
[36:05] to God amen
[36:06] so all that he had to have been taken
[36:09] away from him that God had something
[36:11] else therefore he was a prisoner here we
[36:13] go from his objective of what he had in
[36:16] life and he has become a prisoner to
[36:18] Jesus Christ who was the word so only
[36:20] road to Damascus going down about 11
[36:23] o'clock perhaps in the day he was strict
[36:25] on hear the voices Saul why persecutest
[36:27] thou me and he looked and being a Jew he
[36:31] know the pillar five is what led eternal
[36:33] Israel Paul not stupid he know the
[36:35] Scriptures he noticed it will Testament
[36:37] Allah fire let the generation this have
[36:39] to be the same pillar of fire or glory
[36:41] to God hallelujah praise God he was
[36:45] intelligent
[36:45] praise God but you know what he did
[36:48] hallelujah
[36:49] praise God he said he knew he had an
[36:52] experience but here's another goodness
[36:54] in verse experience alone isn't enough
[36:56] it's got to be an experience according
[36:59] to the word all people are not crazy
[37:02] cuckoo all kind of crazy experiences no
[37:06] scripture to back it up and they come at
[37:08] the cuckoo revelation with their
[37:09] experience and they don't want to
[37:10] examine it you see I like
[37:12] what I like do I enjoy talking with the
[37:16] Angels see what do you just see I wanna
[37:19] wait until it is so Paul went to three
[37:24] and a half years almost years Arabia
[37:25] desert the check is experienced by the
[37:28] world forgot to unveil dish just to him
[37:32] so when he came back he came back my
[37:35] revelation by inspiration by experience
[37:38] and he challenged every spirit I was in
[37:40] front of him or gentle even the
[37:42] disciples or glory who walk with Jesus
[37:46] hallelujah
[37:47] [Music]
[37:51] so him seeing was he took three years
[37:54] and six months in the desert in Arabia
[37:56] taking the Bible it was in the Old
[37:58] Testament and going down there to
[38:00] compare the experience he had and see to
[38:02] a scripture and today servants of Christ
[38:05] we become harness an octa we are harness
[38:09] to the word it's like when you connect a
[38:12] horse that carriage your highness the
[38:14] horse I miss to the word you can't get
[38:17] away from the word at all because you're
[38:19] locked in whatever God's say you believe
[38:21] not an interpretation of what God says

[38:41] promises know what they call to know

[42:39] spirit saith the Lord we must be
[42:47] stripped first and people don't want to
[42:51] be stripped the Methodist brother wants
[42:58] to hole a little bit to his Methodist
[43:01] teaching because father Leo whoever the
[43:06] father is he catch some revelation on a
[43:08] mountain and he he unfold this thing

[43:23] want to say is not God could I smear
[43:26] Barisan thing it's not gold yes yeah
[43:29] illusion and I'm Tiger man seen a lights
[43:31] up in the air like a video and it's
[43:33] pronounced in like you know it was a
[43:34] flashback pocket

[43:43] walking I think why not they he forget
[43:44] he like didn't win back pocket unless
[43:46] the composition everything motion like
[43:48] moving like moving who the Baptist
[43:59] brother one hold a baptist teaching but
[44:01] you have got to be stripped of
[44:03] everything and just be born again are
[44:06] fresh and take it from there
[44:09] that's why baram says the last is gone
[44:12] dear speaking about the Pentecost they
[44:14] will only be cutting he put the
[44:16] Pentecostal age in the womb of the
[44:18] mother that's a direct quote he has a
[44:24] question a mother having a baby is three
[44:27] stages what a blood spirit and so on
[44:28] like that he said yes you are be cutting
[44:31] first and then born so when the babies
[44:34] and the room is big lucky sell upon sell
[44:38] word a temple when the baby come true is
[44:41] born and he said the Pentecostal is they
[44:45] were begotten that means in the age
[44:47] context they were in the womb because
[44:50] William Branham had the word to produce
[44:52] the bit which was the person of Christ
[44:55] the baby or give the Lord a shout
[44:58] hallelujah
[44:59] that is right their tongues and signs
[45:01] and wonders couldn't reduce adoption
[45:04] it's the word to produce the life the
[45:07] life brings the character the character
[45:09] will be tested and proven and then gocta
[45:13] said this is my son
[45:14] so the Pentecostal fail because the only
[45:17] had gifts signs and one of the miracles
[45:19] but they couldn't come to the life
[45:21] because the life come from it from the
[45:23] word and the word came to the prophet
[45:25] and they reject the prophet so they
[45:27] couldn't get the word to believe the
[45:28] lies but we are the world's over 50
[45:30] years where is that life that life is
[45:34] promised the professor he said as he
[45:36] said Sarah you're holding that seed long
[45:38] enough the Lateran is fixin to fall or
[45:42] give the Lord a shout
[45:44] you're not hearing the word in vain you

[46:07] dynamics is here in the form of the
[46:09] spirit of prophecy
[46:10] according to revelation 10 18 11 Tom
[46:13] must prophesy again and the testimony of
[46:15] Jesus spirit of prophecy
[46:17] so what I notice all these years with
[46:19] the spirit of prophecy

[46:50] nothing less than that same power same
[46:54] signs same life same wonders same
[46:58] miracles Oh glory to God

[47:07] happened and I lost something would
[47:09] happen if I mind stay with the word
[47:11] gonna share my continuation of the word
[47:14] or give the Lord a shout if I man stay

[47:19] continuation of the word hallelujah you
[47:25] gotta be stripped of everything and be
[47:27] born again afresh and let the Holy
[47:30] Spirit lead you can't say well my daddy
[47:34] said when he got in he went into the
[47:36] church he should come in a pasta
[47:38] he's a good lawyer member that might
[47:40] have been right for his race but we
[47:42] don't know the reefs we must come back
[47:44] to the Bible time for this day we have
[47:47] to come back to the Bible I love people
[47:50] say butter Browns Ibrahim said but they
[47:51] don't know waiters in the Bible this
[47:53] this message come revealed the Bible
[47:55] this reveal would have to slide check
[47:57] into the scripture or glory to God
[47:59] because Jesus came as it is written in
[48:02] the scripture he said he that believeth
[48:04] on me as the scripture hath said even
[48:06] Jesus had to find the scripture that he
[48:08] could announce the Spirit was upon me we
[48:11] have to find our scripture every mystery
[48:15] of a scripture behind it
[48:16] every me every demonstration every
[48:19] unfolding have a scripted behind it
[48:25] Gloria what are you at me tonight
[48:27] hallelujah these priests were honest too
[48:30] but you see that come over into another
[48:33] dispensation they feel the strip off
[48:35] they're all harnessed and put on a new
[48:37] harness the same thing we find today we
[48:40] did come to a denominational age we
[48:42] proved to the church ages the Bible and
[48:45] so forth but now here we go we come to a
[48:48] free age where the Holy Spirit Himself
[48:52] comes down and vindicates himself and
[48:56] makes himself known makes every promise
[48:59] that he promised come to pass what a
[49:02] great time he call it a fridge Oh glory
[49:06] to God and I believe was in the
[49:08] Philadelphia age praise God God set a
[49:11] open door not the Holy Spirit could
[49:13] begin to move in the church however he
[49:15] wants to that door shut yet he said
[49:18] whatever door I open I opened or
[49:20] whatever though I shut eyes shut when he
[49:22] shut the door you shut that door but
[49:24] that's an open door that door is still
[49:26] open tonight that thought of the Holy
[49:28] Ghost is still open tonight that you
[49:30] could be filled with the Holy Ghost
[49:31] no man can operate that door no man can
[49:34] shut that door no man inside that door
[49:37] God said behold I set before you an open
[49:38] door that door is still open tonight oh
[49:41] god I feel good saying that tonight that
[49:44] door is open tonight for whosoever will
[49:46] to come Oh glory to God hallelujah
[49:49] whosoever will
[49:53] [Applause]
[49:54] Oh hallelujah but a Branham says Paul he
[49:59] said he was honest he knew that his
[50:03] ambition drawed him among brethren where
[50:05] he are invited to come and yet he was
[50:07] pressed in the spirit to do something
[50:09] else maybe somebody said but I saw
[50:11] brother Paul we want you to come over
[50:12] here because we got the biggest Church
[50:14] we got the biggest congregation and your
[50:16] offerings will be great and so forth but
[50:17] being pressed in the spirit he told I
[50:20] got a brother over here I like to go
[50:22] over and see this brother get him to the
[50:24] Lord but yet the Spirit pressed him to
[50:27] go somewhere else he was a prisoner
[50:29] correctly so he was entitled ization
[50:32] well if you go Adam brothers you're not
[50:34] with me no more he wasn't tired he was a
[50:37] prisoner of Jesus Christ
[50:40] oh god what a Branham make us prisoners
[50:45] like that from our own selfish ambition
[50:48] from our own judgements and our better
[50:50] way of thinking to be a prison of Jesus
[50:53] Christ I think that was a great
[50:55] statement I'm a prisoner to Jesus Christ
[50:57] and remember he's the word no matter
[51:01] what anybody else thinks
[51:03] it's the word and if you're a prisoner
[51:05] to the word nor denomination can show
[51:07] you from it he says the bride he said no
[51:11] man could make her do otherwise he said
[51:15] the secret is the word is in the bride
[51:19] and she don't have the mind of Christ to
[51:21] know what he was done with the word no
[51:23] man could do to take them otherwise Oh
[51:26] hallelujah praise God we not talk about
[51:30] a man with the word knowing again a man
[51:32] that standing where they were constant
[51:34] with the word living with that word it
[51:36] must come to fruit Oh glory to God
[51:39] hallelujah praise God you know
[51:41] somebody's an old crack hypocrite then
[51:43] what new life not at all and some power
[51:46] coming behind them you know that is not
[51:47] that not be the perfect will of God

[55:55] my mind so tonight if we expand on
[56:00] Tabernacle come on become prisoners to
[56:02] our own selfish being to own ambition
[56:05] and we could completely surrender
[56:06] ourselves and be yoked to him no matter
[56:09] what the rest of the world thinks what
[56:11] the rest of the world does
[56:13] we are yoked with fetters of love we are
[56:16] prisoners my feet is so yo cat won't
[56:19] dance my eyes are so you up to Christ
[56:21] till when I see these models trapeze on
[56:23] the street it turns my head my heart is
[56:26] so you can love to him till I can't have
[56:29] love for this world anymore my will is
[56:31] so yoked to him
[56:33] then I don't even know know what my
[56:34] ambitions are wherever you lead Lord I
[56:37] will follow Lord I'll be a prisoner Paul
[56:41] was correctly a prisoner he wasn't
[56:43] making any wrong statement he was
[56:45] trained by the holy ghost to wait on the
[56:48] word no he had been trained one way but
[56:51] now go treat him another way he was
[56:53] trained by the horse pray to wait upon
[56:54] the Lord no matter what his ambition was
[56:56] say not born with this there's a
[56:59] training what a train you in the spirit
[57:02] trainer with the things of God you have
[57:04] to be trained
[57:05] Oh glory Lord God no God is looking for
[57:07] prisoners let's take the character Moses
[57:10] he was born deliverer he knew he was
[57:12] born deliverer oh praise God God always
[57:16] has to take a man that was sitting truly
[57:18] to be his prisoner
[57:19] a man has to surrender every ambition
[57:22] he's got everything his life his soul
[57:26] his body his will his ambition and
[57:29] everything else and become a complete
[57:31] prisoner to Christ who is the word to
[57:34] serve God listen to this you might have
[57:36] to walk on carry to your better judgment
[57:38] maybe in a certain organization you
[57:40] might have to think that they could lift
[57:42] you up and give you something great and
[57:43] you might flash and when you find
[57:46] yourself you are defeated after why
[57:48] until God get that man willing to become
[57:50] a prisoner here so they never feel and
[57:53] money and popularity man one popularity
[57:56] I wanted to go here and somebody call a
[57:58] year because you want you want to be
[57:59] more exposure you want a piece of Fame
[58:02] what my Lord God is looking for
[58:06] prisoners he's always done it you might
[58:10] say to the scripture a man has to be a
[58:12] prisoner to Christ against anything
[58:14] therefore you cannot be connected with
[58:16] anything but Christ stop see that again
[58:21] I will see it again you cannot be
[58:24] connected with anything but Christ whose
[58:28] side you're on
[58:32] whose side you're on these doctrines I
[58:36] know that dr. Assad who say oil is the
[58:38] wood the wood is Christ therefore you
[58:41] cannot be kind of end about Christ even
[58:43] your father your mother your brother
[58:46] your
[58:46] sister your husband your wife anybody
[58:49] you're only connected with Christ and
[58:51] him only then God can use you look Oh
[58:57] see you as that is it doesn't matter if
[59:00] the pastor for long dead you connected
[59:03] to Christ it doesn't matter B - it split
[59:06] in 15 pieces or trillion of expected to
[59:09] 20 pieces you are connected to Christ
[59:15] doesn't matter Pope Francis among young
[59:18] give everybody to a Lemurian - or father
[59:20] in a chaplet you connected to Christ
[59:24] only Christ the word is God you're not
[59:32] watching the next brother and that's
[59:33] just oh he does do it so he doesn't do
[59:35] it no what did he would say they're
[59:38] making excuses for your behavior because
[59:40] you watch it brother's doing this
[59:42] I'm sisters doing that and you think you
[59:44] could do it - or whether they would say
[59:46] don't do what they do do what they would
[59:48] say then you're locked in with Christ
[59:54] going on sometimes speak rough the
[59:58] people I'm trying to get you to cut
[1:00:00] loose this is been around you got to
[1:00:02] have a starting place like something
[1:00:04] called a woman Bob in the hair wearing
[1:00:06] these clothes and maintain the Christian
[1:00:08] profession you say that's a little thing
[1:00:09] when they gotta start somewhere so begin
[1:00:12] with your ABCs and cut truth the world
[1:00:14] looks and become a prisoner and then
[1:00:16] keep on cut loose until the last and has
[1:00:18] cut loose so you have to start to cut
[1:00:20] somewhere and eventually a cut more you
[1:00:24] cut more you cut more until you're fully
[1:00:26] loose loose from the world then your
[1:00:29] prisoner then and you becoming his grip
[1:00:32] so Moses Moses got training he could
[1:00:35] teach the Egyptians he could teach the
[1:00:36] psychologist he could teach the generals
[1:00:38] they what military was he was a great
[1:00:40] man people feared Moses because of his
[1:00:42] greatness
[1:00:42] scholarship he was a bishop maybe like a
[1:00:45] pope he's a great fellow a mighty man
[1:00:47] and he knows he was born to do this
[1:00:50] so there's a man have a anchor on the
[1:00:52] inside of what he was born and called to
[1:00:55] do God before he could get the man in
[1:00:59] his hand he had to strip him of his
[1:01:01] ambition you have to strip him of all
[1:01:03] his training he called he killed one
[1:01:06] Egyptian and when he did he thought he
[1:01:07] wasn't wrong he couldn't run any desert
[1:01:10] run in the wilderness you're just kind
[1:01:12] of strange go to have a message for them
[1:01:14] men did he get me to the desert because
[1:01:16] he took Paul in the desert and training
[1:01:18] go to desert Moses time he took him that
[1:01:20] desert kept in there for 40 years and
[1:01:22] stripped him of all the theology and his
[1:01:24] ambition what a time Oh glory to God
[1:01:27] wannabe strip people know this and I
[1:01:29] know this and along that message and
[1:01:31] that's why I always as I speak us anyway
[1:01:33] you know we have not been here before
[1:01:35] see it can't go by the history and past
[1:01:37] record you need a fresh experience Oh
[1:01:40] glory to God even when Joshua getting

[1:10:50] he was a prisoner prison of love yoked
[1:10:52] up in the bond of love like God Paul was
[1:10:54] yoked in the bond of love to God just
[1:10:56] like Paul booted him train to see me
[1:10:58] Moses dream to deliver the churn of
[1:11:00] Israel by a mighty hand we almost
[1:11:03] finished Paul trainer take them out by
[1:11:04] the hand of the Romans put them put em
[1:11:07] free but porter them went in the desert
[1:11:08] to come back different men both of them
[1:11:10] saw the pillar of fire what an em were
[1:11:12] prophets both of them they talked to the
[1:11:14] pillar of fire or glory that they were
[1:11:16] trained one way and God changed them to
[1:11:18] another and they had to become complete
[1:11:20] prisoners to not act in the way they
[1:11:23] wanted to act
[1:11:25] but act in the way God wanted him to act
[1:11:28] he's the same yesterday then forever
[1:11:30] I let me drop this bomb the Holy Ghost
[1:11:33] will not behave in one person and
[1:11:34] misbehaving on a policeman or give the
[1:11:37] Lord a shout on that one the Holy Cross
[1:11:39] have one behavior which is the word so
[1:11:43] the Holy Ones can behave in a brother
[1:11:44] I've missed me even another is that in
[1:11:46] the Holy Ghost once God the Holy Ghost
[1:11:49] so when I hear all these bread remedies
[1:11:51] for inspiration and revelation I am the
[1:11:53] Holy Spirit and see the behavior is not
[1:11:56] the Holy Spirit it's two difference
[1:11:57] cousins they then they things not the
[1:11:59] Holy Spirit is an enticing spirit a
[1:12:00] spirit impersonating in Christianity or
[1:12:03] glory to God hallelujah because the Holy
[1:12:06] Ghost have one day area the behavior of
[1:12:08] the word what Obama's a genuine
[1:12:11] Christian he lives something oh but he
[1:12:16] manifested Christ Oh glory to God and
[1:12:19] this is the final one we're gonna see
[1:12:22] the wrap up here with Joseph go glory to
[1:12:24] God Joseph born a prophet he could see
[1:12:26] visions he was a little boy he saw

[1:13:12] church keeping other people and these
[1:13:15] thing I he promised he's going to do to

[1:13:22] that fish ain't gonna come to pass he
[1:13:25] knew his dick was of God you got to know
[1:13:27] it so that you wouldn't let the
[1:13:29] circumstances are wrong you block and
[1:13:31] blind the vision of what is to be
[1:13:35] [Music]
[1:13:38] and these things were missing you wanna
[1:13:40] do them he said he would and we are
[1:13:42] living in that time we are here he's
[1:13:44] just trying to get us to be real
[1:13:45] prisoners locked him with him
[1:13:48] you know the whole song shutting with
[1:13:50] God I want to be shutting with God no

[1:13:54] total failure to himself all he knew all
[1:13:57] you understood he become a total failure
[1:13:59] it didn't work he was put in a situation
[1:14:02] there where nobody would listen to him
[1:14:06] no he liked to be in opposition
[1:14:10] revolution had nobody listening to you
[1:14:17] he was a prisoner he was he was put into
[1:14:20] that situation that unbelievers will not
[1:14:22] believe do you see what I mean his
[1:14:24] ministry was of none effect the people
[1:14:27] turning their head wouldn't be no
[1:14:28] attention what good would his ministry
[1:14:30] do he might stand in prison bars preach
[1:14:32] to them they walk on his street but he
[1:14:33] become a prison and God kept him a
[1:14:35] prisoner until doneall got rule up right
[1:14:39] and then he said here is my man where
[1:14:43] I'm say glory to Thalia
[1:14:46] finally God God came to him in prison
[1:14:49] like Paul like the rest of them he used
[1:14:51] the gift that he had to give him to get
[1:14:53] him out of there he brought him from his
[1:14:55] prison what do you do I only brought him
[1:14:57] his prison he was given power by the
[1:14:59] king and the King he set on the side of
[1:15:02] that he was under he was brought from
[1:15:04] prison house and given power in his
[1:15:07] prison he constantly remembered he was
[1:15:09] born for a purpose and when you and your
[1:15:12] prison just remember you were born for a
[1:15:15] purpose that you're gonna be healed and
[1:15:17] you won't be delivered and you wouldn't
[1:15:19] just die out and just leave this world
[1:15:20] just like that
[1:15:21] Oh glory to God a man in the prison he
[1:15:25] causally remembered he was born for a
[1:15:26] purpose he was gonna sit by the king all
[1:15:28] the rest of them was gonna bow a knee to
[1:15:30] him his vision told him so but before
[1:15:33] his vision could be completely fulfilled
[1:15:35] he had to become a prisoner and Christ
[1:15:38] makes us prisoners of love this sons
[1:15:42] and he give them the same power send
[1:15:45] John 14:12 he that believeth on me the
[1:15:48] ones that I do shall you do also even
[1:15:50] more than this Ollie do know the prison
[1:15:52] of the love of Christ becomes empowered
[1:15:54] by the king
[1:15:55] Oh hallelujah praise God verily if you
[1:15:59] say to respond to me move and don't
[1:16:01] doubt any heart but believe what you
[1:16:03] said it shall come to pass if he abided
[1:16:06] me so look over around just choppin all
[1:16:08] these promises out of here prisoners
[1:16:11] Joseph notice mission gone please before
[1:16:15] he come out before you had to be taken
[1:16:18] out and shaved a few things had to be
[1:16:20] shaved off before he could meet this
[1:16:23] king
[1:16:23] Oh God sometimes takes people like that
[1:16:26] and she is of you of the only ones off
[1:16:29] that they can't just do what they want
[1:16:31] to do you know what I mean they are not
[1:16:34] in liberty to do what they want to do
[1:16:38] because before they could comment the
[1:16:41] full power
[1:16:42] oh and be a love slave to Christ they
[1:16:45] have to be shaved off and then presented
[1:16:49] as a next message myself shaves off and
[1:16:52] then presented sometimes he takes them
[1:16:55] to the desert to do that to shave them
[1:16:57] off then bring them out the anointed
[1:17:00] ones to fulfill the purpose that your
[1:17:02] Deen for them to see see what I mean
[1:17:04] brethren we are the endtime remember all
[1:17:07] other times what he's done he's always
[1:17:09] take a man and make him a prisoner to
[1:17:11] him
[1:17:11] the forsake praise God Oh hallelujah
[1:17:15] the first take everything that you know
[1:17:18] forget all of his trainings he can't
[1:17:20] follow anything that man has got to do I
[1:17:23] cannot go in back he has statements you
[1:17:26] hear comments and so on and different
[1:17:28] things said but you have to ask yourself
[1:17:30] is that in the world did God say that
[1:17:34] because it has to be the word
[1:17:37] especially now remember what you called
[1:17:41] Cottagers was what started at Pentecost
[1:17:43] and they just deteriorate so bad that is
[1:17:47] a thing so allow a tall hat sprinkle
[1:17:51] some holy water that was once Pentecost
[1:17:54] him
[1:17:55] because fell away to that condition you
[1:17:58] know tell the Bible is irrelevant they
[1:18:02] do another read scriptures is what he
[1:18:03] pops it when the Pope said this country
[1:18:09] black it later just because he pops it
[1:18:16] but God said I will restore so he made
[1:18:22] sure Alpha and Omega the first church
[1:18:25] and the last Church would be the same
[1:18:27] church so you have to expect the same
[1:18:31] thing that pizza they had same power
[1:18:34] Peter a ha and we have a greater
[1:18:36] revelation than what the other church is
[1:18:39] has had because this is the end of time
[1:18:43] the breaking of the Seventh Seal almost
[1:18:47] done you know okay noted okay alright if
[1:18:56] you are following God and I'm submitting
[1:18:59] yourself to God then you become a
[1:19:01] prisoner to that God - that would - that
[1:19:03] will no matter what anybody else says
[1:19:05] you become a prisoner to it hallelujah
[1:19:10] I'm done
[1:19:11] we are the end time I would say this
[1:19:15] with reference and respect as the last
[1:19:17] couple of minutes is floatin by look
[1:19:19] what God - my opinion will do one must
[1:19:21] do and well doing this last day it's the
[1:19:24] fine listen tool for the harvest so
[1:19:27] there's not just prisoner prison as you
[1:19:29] know this is going on deeper now he's
[1:19:31] looking for what - ruse for the harvest
[1:19:34] he's got to find a tool to trash the
[1:19:39] floor and any farmer when he goes to his
[1:19:42] harvest he has to have a tool to do it
[1:19:44] with certainly he's got to have a sharp
[1:19:47] sickle of something to the trash out the
[1:19:50] grain and the harvest is right God take
[1:19:54] us in your hand make us bond servants of
[1:19:57] your love users for tool to bring the
[1:20:01] realization to the sinful cursors that
[1:20:03] we are living today that gee
[1:20:06] him yesterday forever for myself God let
[1:20:09] me be a prisoner if all my brethren

[1:20:24] God become filmed by the same thing it
