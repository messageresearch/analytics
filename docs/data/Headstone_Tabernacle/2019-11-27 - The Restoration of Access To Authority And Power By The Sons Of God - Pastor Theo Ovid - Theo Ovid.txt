take the rip the holy recorder puntito us anoint us tonight in Jesus and we ask all glory welcome tonight it's so good to be here thanks for coming out we just wanted water straight to the word Ephesians 2:1 or even verse one is a echo here and on one a 22 Hebrews 10 verse he left at 25 and revelation five wanted them so let's go Ephesians two reading from verse one and you mighty quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the Prince of the power of the air the spirit that worketh in the channel disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh that would conversation means we have life fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and who of nature the churn of rat even as others but God rich in mercy for his great love where it he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace are ye saved and it raises up together I made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of His grace in his kindness towards us to Christ Jesus for by grace are ye saved through faith and not of ourselves yourselves it is a gift of God not of works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them wherefore remember that he been in times past Gentiles in the flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called circumcision in the flesh made by hands that at the time he will beat on Christ being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel strangers from the Covenant of promise having no hope without God in the world but no in Christ Jesus ye who were sometimes far off a midni by of Christ for he is our peace who had made bought one and had broken down the middle wall of partition between us having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of Commandments contained in ordinances for to make in himself of tween one new man so making peace that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby and came and preached peace unto you which were foul and to them that were nigh and shew him we both have access by one spirit unto the Father now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow-citizens with the Saints on with the hosel of God and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets Jesus Christ Himself being the chief Cornerstone and whom all the building fitly framed together groweth and holy temple in the Lord in whom you also builded together for an habitation of God through the spirit Hebrews 10 whatever from verse 11 and every priest standard daily ministering and offering of times the same sacrifice which can never take away sins but this man did tell his enemies be made his footstool for by one offering here perfected forever them that are sanctified wear of the Holy Ghost also the witness of us for after he had said before this is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days saith the Lord I will put my laws into them in their hearts and in their minds will I write them and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more now this is God saying that no very mission of DZ's there is no more offering for sin are then therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus by a new and living way which he had consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having a high priest over the house of God let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure let us hold fast the professional feet without wavering for he is faithful that promise and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works not forsaking the assembling ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the Day approaching a final scriptures from Revelation chapter 5 and I saw on the right hand of him that sat upon the throne a book written within and the back side see with seven seals I saw strong angel proclaiming a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven knowing it neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I went much because no man was found worthy to open to read a book please look there on one of the other son let me weep not to behold the land or the tribe of Judah the root of David had prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne of the four beasts in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth it and all here he came glory and took the book on the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and the four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of the saints and the song a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God kings and priests and we shall read this boy his father we of reggio would tonight be a calm down Lord and confirm your word and interpret it to our hearts O God and sent a revival into the hearts and lives of your people here do that I hear those are hooked up with us tonight and do that but he has escaped and granted Lord and Jesus in my ask it amen you may be seated just give God praises as I sit down [Music] you must always give good reasons presence is evidence of feet and God halle-loo in time there's no prison no worship is a lack of feet cause Abram staggered not at the promise of God ROM believed but was strong in faith given preaches to God tonight our message a title the restoration of access to authority and power by the sons of God the restoration of access to the authority and power by the sons of God and I have an inspiration one word access I really wanted a title message access tonight I said leave the one word alone so tonight inspiration is one word access this powerful a big word access ok this is the Bob Ramiz premium for message making the value of ditches Heavenly Father you always hear the building is warm and it is time the time has come I remember once / dear Lord when you looked up and said father the hour has come we always come forward Oh God the hours come now for people to believe they all has come for falling away of the church we always come that religion would spread the world without salvation form of godliness denying the power thereof the odds come they always come for your church to rise this all has come you that you are the Rays of the dust and chic herself under come to self and realize positionally what she isn't that she is the Church of the Living God and has rights over everything every here we go he's praying DISA prayer the ring in every redemptive blessing that you promised to her dear who's tonight did you get that every redemptive blessing that your promises hints tonight we always come nor grant Lord that the orders come now at this hour for to pray for the sick Almighty God I pray that you would send your angel tonight I may go to this building and he's so many sick people and he's so many sick people that tomorrow there'll be a formal well stocked up everywhere testimony is going everywhere and people will be testifying of the glory of God let them know that the Church of the Living God is rising spreading for two wings for the great flight that is coming God may men move away from them wish from them we shine hope tonight until the perfect understand of God's plan and be healed tonight hear the previous event in Jesus name so he was saying they always come for the church to Maria hallelujah and I recognized that every redemptive rights belong to the right hallelujah you believe that so what a time we had Sunday in that message and Jesus praise God he had was now expressed and sure he had dominion over himself a lot of people want power but you have to be able to show you have dominion over yourself and that is heaven domine over the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh and pride of life so woman can lead you astray money cannot lead you astray popularity cannot lead you astray nothing can lead you astray the devlopment that touch inside of you yeah he can put his finger inside of you or praise the name of the Lord we believe that so he had self-control over his human spirit that's powerful self control over his human spirit now this word access touches all of it the issue has always been access to power and authority that has always been the issue Lucifer he wanted to be like the Most High and attempted a coup in heaven and even got some angels to make effort to system to be in a position of authority that he can be worship and when the Battle of Angels fell on earth man man was no longer spirit as in Genesis but no the spirit man was now in flesh as in Genesis 2 so Lucy first job was to get access to the main and place wisdom and knowledge ahead of the world he did that true evil who was a by-product of the original and true Eve Adam took a bite and fell the devil don't have to hit you direct he can use others to get to you the devil didn't approach Adam which was original he approached Eve was a by-product and caused Adam to fall when Adam fell man fell man fell from the sixth sense of fate the five senses of the flesh and spirit the flesh being taste touch feel smell in here and the spirit being imagination memory conscience affection and reasoning the sixth sense was the only sense given to contact God to relate to God and Satan knew if we could break the connection man will no longer have access and he Lucifer would remain in charge of the earth forever roman as the prince of the power of the air once he could bring a connection man would no longer be on line with god man would be pushed into an offline mode to be on his own in five senses access to heaven will no be denied the ease of access to animals was no longer dear he knew he once had it but no he was a wanderer and this hip was adam access to god and the five senses give adam access to the eight but what purpose to restore the feet back to the sons of god or could be they've got some praises did you see that tonight god purpose that you won't be offline but he'll bring it up online and you will have access to every redemptive right can you see no in the last days go to restore access granted back to the sun's not access denied because when Adam was kicked out the angel was sent to guard the tree don't let him touch that tree in other words he had no more access to that tree access was denied but God proved us that God will restore access access granted to the sons of God hallelujah in the last days we believe that what the bus he will bring back the sons back on lane into heaven stand on the bus can you see why God said that the bride will be a super church a super race because she'll be using us I restored super-sense the faith that was once delivered Court restore the foundation stone of right under the devil's nose he put their ground state even Isaac loves he put the take up grace I mean put to perfection right under the devil's nose but God was doing something in the spirit realm he was gonna restore the sons of God to have full access not partial access but full access to every redemptive blessing under full authority and power God Oh hallelujah we believe so but a man was saying this in the breach he said don't you notice that how the animal in depth troubles that the tree struggles everything in nature is groaning wean ourselves are groaning no there is something wrong we see it from creation both man on the earth and so forth he says something was lost it is groaning it is trying to get back to its original condition there must be some way to get back to the original condition and when a person struck with disease aches and pain one time it wasn't that way but they are groaning because something is wrong they are trying to get back to health and when nature and people as the Bible said are groaning they are not in the auto B condition we don't need anybody to interpret that for us it was eternalized they fell from they lost their claim it's analyzed by the fall of Adam and Eve who fell from eternalized to death in the camera even a tree never died before Adam animal wouldn't die before Adam but I was only wanting a kind of die and that's God because he's eternal and the only way we can ever keep from dying we hallelujah is happy life in us to be sons and daughters of God we believe that no Adam fell today he brought upon all creation and he was given a free moral agency it was killing him to make a choice now Adam and Eve in the beginning there was a tree of right and wrong before them and that same tree says before each one of us tonight God isn't doing it for Adam or Eve you say well it's there for no novice isn't it's your fault because you can't put it on Adam now you've got to present yourself because right and wrong is set before you we are on the same basis and Adam and Eve but when we are redeemed we no longer want our own choice when we are redeemed you're all choice get put aside it's not right they wanted to find out what it was that wisdom and they proved it and cause it costs debt but when a man of the redeemed he don't care for any scholarship he don't care anymore the things of the world the wisdom of the world he don't want no choice at all Christ have been his choice and that's all he's redeemed he's just no more wants to leave himself I love that part he don't want to leave himself he don't want nobody to talk him into where to go and what to do he wants to wait and find all the choice of his maker and he calls in the name of his maker when the maker tells him to go now when I am sin by heathen his wife reason instead of holding to God's Word that is what make Adam said his wife reason with Satan and then produced a productive Adam and Adam turn loose the world I'm sold out so I don't have the world he let go the word and take over evils of venom he lost also his inheritance 1/2 he lost his fellowship tree and right to life so when he lost his life he lost his inheritance in life because here we go he was a complete supreme control over it notice the original word from the Lord his last big man and let him have dominion on the earth notice revelation 5 when when the lamb took the book what was said we shall reign on the earth that was in Genesis let my not Dominion in Revelation the book hold the mystery of reigning on the earth so when he lost his life he lost his inheritance in life because he had complete control of the earth he was the god of the earth and God is the core of the universe but his son has this earth under his control control he could speak he could name he could stop nature so that was new what Jesus did peace be still that was new what brother Branham said son come on and shine for this that is not new Adam was doing it he had complete control he was a minor God under God our Father because he was a son of God oh that's big that is big yet operational he was a minor going under God because he was a son of God so our son of God has hidden tiny dust man this fresh man you know we don't much Son of God that he came because Jesus belong to attain you know when your season is fullness Jesus big brother and we have to be the same time like him that's why they say when we see him we shall be like him we will be of the same kind so don't look like a Jesus or foreigner just know know that you are far enough no no this blood give us access that we no longer strangers or foreigners but fellow-citizens having the same access right to every temple blessing that God has loosed or get the Lord some present this happen under a church membership what church should be wrong too much enjoyment this has nothing to do with that should be something go Oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah so when Martin for to meet the fort and Wesley forth and a Pentecostal thought it was frightened to come back to that every lesson that was fighting to go back so YJ goes on a process first our books and tapes and have messages there's only one of the hearts of the children to the father's this is from and this the same Congo restore that gives you the super sensor delivers a son to talk like a son to walk at the Sun to act like a son to be empowered by a son by language son [Music] so you say when but if the blood has cleansed it back what about no hallelujah what that son the second item did the work that I do shall you do also know if it has no buts jesus said the same works I do shall you do also not maybe not perhaps no I can alter time and no it's not that you know these are the same most I do shall you do also because the same son anointing I have you wanna have also the same cheaper since I have you will have also he said they shall lay eyes upon the sick and they shall recover he said these signs shall follow them that believe God never change that that's still inside the Bible science-loving tonight or calling about miracles tonight deliverance tonight healing tonight I have no kitchen to postpone it or get the Lord a shout i disown it you're telling me I carry for ii see on the heel of corsica that healed because jesus christ my battle tell me it's the same yesterday today and forever but put them at your knees you know or give the Lord a shot whether through the tree that gotta get up or glory the gone right now they talk to not the devil his children of the devil of your husband of the telogen family not the devil Oh tell your wife although I'm talking about you hold on IRA I'm talking about the God of War hallelujah praise God praise God [Music] so Adam lost his inheritance the earth it passed from his hand to the one is so low to Satan the earth but it so happened it passes all he did which was the book therefore his eternal life his right to the Tree of Life he's right to the earth was forfeited and went into the hands of Satan it passed into the hands of Satan so Satan is in touch and the Bible call him the Prince of the power of the air but his in charge is temporary because Jesus rejected his offer to bow down and come on the earth without paying the price or we shall be shortened tonight or glory over and the only reason Jesus didn't keep and taste-off is because he had power Jesus enters over the lust of the eyes over the lust of the flesh and the pride of life if Jesus did not power over the lust of the eyes when sense it and put on his full screen I'm sure Jesus all the pics of the world he was gonna give him because porn authority is what man loved us all how all they are family they built a house if he got the more money the more dance team or that because power give people access over others when a government take full power the column dictators rule as the man they control in your life I'm controlling what you eat and what your way and everything else power that's what man longed for that by sitting and a fool when he recognized Jesus overcome not stone a stone into bread and won't come the second one he say come come come it is also written instead I give my word orphan all he tried to give Jesus a offer but still connected to self he said the angel shall give us charge over thee that's written if you jump off the building and you know the engine will hold you up so so show yourself short form show your best dress the best sheet your best tie so who you are but Jesus is not the authority to obey the devil so he drop it on him thou shalt not worship the Lord he'll only wish to the Lord thy God and him only because all the devils worship you know you couldn't get it in heaven he tried to undercut Jesus on earth to see if he could get some terrorists Porsche he people get a governor yet you know but when jesus paid the price Jesus was telling the devil the sons of God is going to come back to have access grant in the last days I'm going to run you all they're going to drive you all different tests - you own it no stopping us now or get the Lord Asano's message believer I'm coming to be restored back into full access okay the Lord I show we are going back online hallelujah see what you see you say a sin Watson you could see what's in do people right showing off in an offline condition because you can't communicate but going to carry late in a Backson condition so you get to HOF you're currently can't communicate it's just you annum you're on your own you know a flying mode you cannot get access to heaven's grace and that's why Paul talked about having boldness to enter into the holiest of Holies by a human living we so course have to make a way for you to have access or glory to accomplish rune and coming into his presence now listen this is the sunset on your gonna get on I tell you this this is not dysfunctional we have a question to answer he said wish have more authority I ain't on the pulpit or angel in heaven this an angel in the pulpit because the engine approvals the Sun or candle or - how did you hear what we're talking about tonight why are the fall the reason the fall is if there was nothing lost to be safe he actually should be a father we know it and he attributed their healer there was nothing lost that was sick the only thing he could do was to make man on the Beast the free world agency knowing that he will do it God didn't do it he let man do themselves so God didn't push mine off he let man fall by itself and because man fall introduce a plan and you are the same way this morning you can accept life or ten life down but God made man just knowing he would do it not really not he shouldn't do it but knowing he would do it that he would display is abuse so there is nothing out of train everything is sticking exactly according to God's great and this only displays attributes to see lucky Oh glory this is displayed as attributes yeah we go to see let his children who really love him and believe him and every man has an equal right God be an infinite knew from the beginning what would be the end and what wouldn't be so therefore he wasn't willing but being infinitely afternoon that's why you could say he would have a church without spot or wrinkle because he knew it would he would have it God said that I don't care if your mother was a mad person your grandfather your grandmother it was crazy as ever you ain't will be crazy oh there's the Lord are shot in the house or glory dog thought either careful Robin be Jean you ever be Abuja or glory of God but put your name in the book you get them to live on booze run anything that ever smoke cigarette anything you get shopping your coming out even these hopes a hell effective way to the name of Jesus Christ my God if I was a baptism sorry I'll show you I said oh hell itself the host Adela bill there were good buys in that hopes the best block of that house it have no exit oh that a house to open a door to pull nobody out I went burn watch that hope so he

coming out let me prophesy this coming out no damage I'll stop them nothing me going online tonight not only have full access or get the Lord a show tonight [Music] [Applause] [Music] so God form a plan to execute the rescue of the sons of God from the grip of the power of these Prince of the air God had a plan and the devil wasn't privy to this plan or glory to God hallelujah hallelujah there is something that was always in you that could access the things of God and God knew that is how he could get the word connection to connect you to the channel to affect the restoration because to be restored you have to come into this channel of restoration or give the Lord a show give the Lord a praise I am talking about the restored your help whether you're sitting your body a little rethought you're leaving you're sick you are going for the rapture crippled you're going to the rapture blind dreams glory to God he said be highly upset 45 healing let alone the rapture we got to have a very

Caesar ain't takin no papers to people Commission adoption when we act up to replace somebody talking what we talking I will be talking double arson good ever sees you know you don't look them fellas

tonight no no message church member is that too much of that [Music] [Music] the angel said who is worthy is on the beach where is the book now the book Tom had she Devlin hoodie Adam had a book but they hand the public authority has to come from the book so the whole connection of this redemptive plan is connected to this thing called the book and we find out is a second sealed book having the key to this platform in which court were to use to get this plan in effect never know nothing about that isn't that right so there's Bachmann Buccaneer and so the original owner sheltered original owner because it was forfeited by a son and the first son of God and human race ready for fetus rights to listen to Satan it went back in the hands of the original owner one sat on the throne with the book open hallelujah and this book was the title deed I will take at the name of it the title deed to Redemption this book was right the title lead to retention or the key to bringing us back here is to where we were before not detectable of salvation no title deed of redemption we're not talking what I am saying she's our safe we're not talking about that tonight we talking about redemption bring us before [Music] God the manifestation is sons of God is sons that has been restored to full access for authority on Dominion this is men that got to trust men that got a beat up and and roll over

will be in an American a strange unit or get Dino strange thing rain and storm and all that is in the domain of the sons of God even cash even catches the Sun stand still just a same Sun sensor

in this little title deed to redemption of the ultimate hood let him come forward we will so this book holds the key so Brown says let him comfort if you will or no forever hold his peace and John said there was no man in heaven from worthy no man on earth from worthy no man baby ever lived died was wrong worthy and all of a sudden here come that bloody line hallelujah and he took the book and began to freak off the seat but about now here's the plan of it from the fucile the first thing happened there was a non-ferrous heaven food what happened I see the soup man what is that a mystery unfolded and when a mission fall a trumpet songs it declares war a plague for our children what is the war pad for the Angel of the church catches the mystery of God not fully revealed and when he goes he catch this mystery of God he goes forth to the people after the mission given to him he calls for to the people what does he do out there he begins a flickering message what does it do is start a war a spiritual war and then God takes his messenger but the Elector that each and leads them away asleep and then it drops a plague upon them who rejected it temporary judgment I remember reading just recently I think the black please kill nothing 40% of Europe millions and millions of people was killed by the doctrine that was a plague loosed by rats and so on but in every age gotten in judgment temporary judgment okay so watch and then God takes his messenger with a elect of the aged lease them away to sleep then he chops a big upon them rejected a temporary judgment after that the denominator and then he start off at another man like Wesley and so forth and then now all this happen and then he arrives the trumpet song he declares war and whether what happened finally is caught away when he's later we take for destroy them it's a great plan until it comes to the last angel this has no certain mystery but he gathers up all and I mean lost in them ages all the truth that wasn't fully revealed and the revelation comes and he reveals it he said they want to read it version 10 1 2 4 he takes the book of sins and breaks it know the mysteries of God is the Ministry of the seventh angel he's a mystery man he's a man bringing mysteries isn't that right I want to show you something here the angel of every age not captured in mystery not fully review for them but they catch it and went over the message but in the high level what we're really doing is calling the people and calling their names from the book no detail to understand that you see a man making noise and preaching and whatnot but can you rely on the book is being unfolded I mean just do it now because you are the words of the pocket ever don't know that now in every age the words of the book what's pelting out and the lack of the it was technical merit and getting back on line Oh Chloe don't get access Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah or blow it about the demo is totally clueless because God

but a man am let's continue my question but about number is it true that every Jew born since Christ came up received who 144,000 and added a predestinated wants to be sealed with the Holy Ghost what is the mission there were three questions here the first one is it true but every Jew born since Christ came that will receive he said no answer nothing will be saved only those whose names were put in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world Jew or Gentile that's all the book horns that mystery and the book is only only unfortunate now not each one's name but what the mystery of the book is while it is calling those names you understand that the book doesn't say leave Amos to be saved in the time of the church age or my never know it don't say that it just shows the mystery unfolds the mystery of what the thing is but we ourselves by faith believe it so under justification being Raveena unfolded and Luther don't even know I'm missing moon unfolded the people were justified they saw their name and they went on sealed under certification Weston was sealed on the solidification the pedicles over sealed under the patron egos and you have been seen by the word ready to be seen by the spirit or give the Lord a show because the word and spirit is one and the secret is the wood is in the pride so for all these years god I was kept in the wood inside of you

of the customer to push him back to running off whatever you devil and your government have to do they have to do those things that is not the issue our issue is getting online and get an income when heaven's plan for your life I'm gonna close vision comma please let me switch to the question which has the greatest authority on angel from heaven on engine of the pulpit which has it the angel at the pulpit Paul said if I angel come from heaven and preach any other gospel than which you're preached let him be accursed so the angel anointed with the Holy Spirit with the word stand next to God in the heaven with authority Authority all powers in heaven earth is given under my hand he said now whatever you bind on earth is born in heaven if the great Holy Church only realized its power to do these things but there's too much doubt and fear and trembling wondering if it will happen could it happen that's my brother George you want to be a doctor without power they want a private adoption nobody see nobody knew only they printed option card Reverend so-and-so adopted the cast signed not not in fact to take bounces when you adopted your signature is just as your father good as a fine because sign off on power sign often identified as a who is higher higher as in a talk adoption we're seeing I want to explain I got told you you could explain to the dry you could talk to try one less you get the driver's test and passed the exam is not a driver you could see all the road signs the roots and this means stop and it's bingo and green Mingo and red means stop on what that you know all these sub signs but you never went in the yard you never practice University don't be hot behind a car wheel last thing a drive without icicle when you were small you talking to a man who drive in trying to explain you mind say have you ever driven no the books listen to a listener you Judy I see how this do it or a street food ski and second Candace put it back down soon - Sonia do any motion yet always do it again you do soon and it should not emotional training the gears we like that our grandson resting so he like he'll condom yeah but when you see have the experience you know the driver that is why God have to give us experience in the supernatural that it will be get the shock you so one night brother branham came to his son Billy Paul and it's not a brother was lying on their they came to about Abraham and he put a pillow right Davey polished Billy he says a lot for me to do this exact words you see nobody business he said he ain't just standing right there he said when I move the pillow take a look and see oh this is Lord tell him brother branham to give his son an experience of not just seeing angel but to be aware of his presence so now he said you see what it is just take a look no but a Branham is a custom of the inga Billy is not so this is what a Billy Paul gets in his experience he pulled the pillow away he's the angel describing everything else and he says since that time he always knew before but a Branham said he is here he knew an inter came to build so you hear what I'm sayin no one I'm waitin on and he said what a bleep all say every time every single time before Burr and say he is here a new being to step into the building so he knew everything in charge and covered when the angels did know why would God capable of the reported experience for him to work with his father but there no intern in the same channel that the Prophet working in so he will know because he is involved in the prayer line give him our prayer card and something like that so I am seen in going forward God will give you experiences that will make you aware of his presence and him working with you that has nothing to do with the pasta okay the Lord has show that afternoon you are caught you and your prayer Oh hallelujah glory to God amen he said the same power that rested in Jesus Christ rest in pleased sons in the body of Christ he says he says take him out a certain place have a ceremony place and positionally what he is in the body of Christ then that person has the authority let me say this if it caught me to be a fanatic from this night on that very same thing that I'm speaking of will be done there will be a power put into the church and now it's coming in that the Holy Spirit will show among the people that they will speak the word and will create a self right here we haven't seen power like that coming to the church I'm going to dine oh man I didn't mean it could be so long tonight but tonight mr. Mike young so Jesus was God first corner weak and God raised him from the dead and he was the first fruit of them that set and he was a sheaf and that is right at the wave that chief for it is the first one that come to maturity I just jump over the scriptures the first one come to maturity you're taken away before the Lord what that says that says others coming to so Brom says he has to be wave again it was wave and idea Pentecost and it's to be wave again according to Luke 1730 this son of man who is the son of man in the beginning was the word the Word was a gourd and that word is to be wave over the people again watch watch this watches this is the message of the oh I know and that the Son of God is alive with the baptism of the Holy Spirit among us that is what has to be with the word that the baptism is among us of what the Holy Ghost the baptized you nothing your flesh in your spirit but in your soul because the seed is in your soul so the baptism coming for you Dom there as Christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets watch the bride he was the first woman that slept in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church there has to be a sheaf waved again in the last days so he is talking about himself isn't that right he's I'm sure you know what I'm talking about the first one that comes to my cure the first one that proved it was our wheat and I am sure he won't hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was wave over the people and the first time they will come forth for the bride age for a resurrection of dark denomination will be a message what will not measure discipline see seals mr.
