thank you Jesus glory to God Amen let's just turn to our Bibles to Luke chapter 24 St Luke chapter 4: 13 amen God bless you and salute to the pastor tonight in Jesus name praise God St Luke Chapter 24: 13 to 32 I reading tonight praise God father God I pray you bless your word as your people would read it now and Inspire it before we go down to pray tonight have your perfect will and way in Jesus name we ask it amen and amen praise God and behold two of them went that same day to a village called Emos which was from Jerusalem about three score fongs and they talked together of all these things which had happened and it came to pass that but while they communed together and reason Jesus himself Drew near and went with them but their eyes were Holden that they should not know him and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that you have one to another as you walk and are sad and the one of them whose name was cleopas answering said unto him art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem and has not known the things which have come to pass there in these days and he said unto them what things and they said unto him concerning Jesus of Nazareth which was a prophet Mighty in deed and word before God and all the people and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel and beside all this today is the third day since these things were done Y and certain women also of our company made us astonished which were early at the seula and when they found not his body they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels with said that he was alive and certain of them which were with us went to the seula and found it even so as a woman woman had said but they saw him not then he said unto them oh fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself and they drew nigh unto the village where where they went and he made as though he would have gone further but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward evening and the days is far spent and he went in to T with them and it came to pass as he sat at meat with them he took bread and blessed it and broke and gave to them and their eyes were open and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight and they said one to another did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures praise the name of the Lord may the Lord bless his word and anoint and Inspire to our hearts in Jesus name amen praise the Lord amen so God bless you tonight just a short exhortation before we pray tonight amen glory so earlier in this chapter Luke 24 the sisters had gone to the tomb but did not see the body of the Lord Jesus the Angels had told them he's not here he is risen and the angels reminded them of what Jesus had told them and that on the third day he would rise again and they remembered his words Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord and the sisters went ahead and told the news unto the rest of the disciples but guess what their words seemed to them as Idle tales and they believed them not my so right there those Brothers sank into unbelief still overcome by grief and sadness that their precious Lord and Master had been taken and crucified on a cross and was no more maybe they said these sisters are coming here with idle fairy tale thank you sisters but we need something more tangible something more solid something more convincing that we may believe all oh my Lord I miss fellowshipping with him when he was here we felt so comfortable and safe I wish he was still here I miss him so much my and here's Peter he was going through his own issues of denying Jesus he ran down to the tomb by himself with all his mind battles Lord I failed you Lord I denied you he stooped down by the tomb and peeped inside and saw the grave clothed lying in the Tomb but did not see Jesus what is going on what is going on and then coming down now to verse 13 two brothers who had heard the news were walking from Jerusalem to a village called EMAs and this was about a s miles long journey was a long walk from Jerusalem to EMAs they too were talking about what had transpired and how they were feeling and so on cleopas and the other brother then Jesus Drew near to them and started to walk with them along their Journey Jesus was walking with them Jesus was listening to them talk about him but somehow they did not recognize him the Bible said Their Eyes Were Holden that they should not know him what a situation to find yourself in here they are talking about Jesus sad that he is gone burden for him longing for him and there he is right there in your midst and you don't know it what a situation amen and this was getting a bit frustra frustrating as it were and Jesus breaks the silence what pity party are you Brothers engaging in why are you so sad cleopas said but haven't you heard about the great prophet Jesus are you a stranger the priests and rulers have crucified him and we had hoped that he was the one who would redeem Israel and who would deliver us all then Jesus rebuked them for their lack of Revelation and he began to preach to the two brothers and he shed light on the scriptures which pertained to himself in other words he was revealing himself to them by the word first later on by manifestation St John 5:9 it says search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and there they which testify of me search the scriptures to find the truth hallelujah didn't Jesus say I will rise on the third day why is are you so slow in heart to believe all all that the prophets have said all that Jesus had said ought not Christ to have suffered then go and enter into his glory so why then do you grieve and suffer in this way why do you do it all of this was explained before and Jesus preached for long while to them from Moses coming right down to that present time Hallelujah Glory somebody say Glory tonight hallelujah amen and while he was talking something inside of them was moving their hearts burned with it within them who is this stranger how is it that he speaks with such an authority such depth of Revelation such Clarity of the scriptures and just about that time they reached the village of emus my glory it was a long Seven Mile journey and Jesus is about to go in he bids them farewell he said thanks Brothers for the fellowship God bless you Brothers God bless you but I must go now but those Brothers knew something was special about this stranger and it was evening time and it was getting late somehow they could not not let him go don't go stay with us abide with us for it is late hallelujah hallelujah the Bible said but they constrained him oh glory to God hallelujah Give the Lord a hand of praise tonight hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen glory and this is my title tonight constru rining Jesus constraining Jesus over two months this has been on my heart hunging amen constraining Jesus I know that there are many lessons that can be learned from this passage of scripture Luke 24 but this is the one that the Lord placed upon my heart constraining Jesus don't go stay by me Lord don't go and one songwriter says stay right here with us filling us with your love Hallelujah can we say that tonight is that your desire oh Hallelujah glory amen that's your desire tonight to constrain Jesus Hallelujah and in verse 29 and 30 Jesus carried with them and had dinner with them and they told the stranger can you pray for the food can you bless the meal for us and he took the bread and blessed it and he broke it in a way that only Jesus did and he gave it to them oh glory to God tonight and in doing that he revealed himself to them he revealed himself by the scriptures all along but now he revealed himself by a manifestation by a demonstration by a supernatural manifestation as it will let me just read a quote from the prophet from the message the greatest news flash in history what a title the greatest news flash in history whatam says isn't it strange that it takes something Supernatural to make us understand that it's him teaching itself wouldn't do it he never commissioned the church to teach the word he said go preach the gospel or manifest the gospel Hallelujah and the gospel came not through word only but through Power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit can we say Amen tonight Hallelujah glory glory amen now their eyes were open and they knew it was Jesus and they said did not our hearts burn within us while he talked with us by the way while he opened to us the scriptures hallelujah hallelujah so he he showed them he revealed himself by the word but then now he he did it in a supernatural demonstration amen then he vanished now glory to God and I checked out the meaning of the word constrain and the dictionary said to compel or Force someone to follow a particular course of action say it one more time constrain means to compel or Force someone to follow a particular course of action it reminded me of Jacob and the angel I will not let you go until you bless me he constrained the angel Hallelujah I wonder if tonight somebody will constrain the angel amen I wonder if somebody will constrain the Lord Jesus tonight as he passes by constrain talks about some level of desperation in order to constrain him you have to be desperate constraint talks about some level of urgency Hallelujah God lord Jesus I'm constraining you tonight I have got to meet with you tonight pass me not oh gentle savior can we say that tonight hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah come into my humble home come into my open heart can we open our hearts to him tonight and welcome him constrain him for example if you know that you have a serious medical disease and this certain doctor is the only person with his expertise and skills to perform the operation and he's leaving the country tonight and you are dying I feel pretty sure that you will try to constrain him all right if you have to kidnap him I don't know what but when desperation kicks in you have to do something and tonight let's do something different tonight let's do something different tonight hallelujah amen when you realize tonight that you got to press in and get the Holy Ghost before those terrible plages strike my and you see the clock set at a few seconds seconds to midnight what are you going to do and let's see that tonight the clock the world clock the time clock is set at seconds to bid9 Let's press into the Holy Ghost before the terrible plagues strike I believe tonight you ought to push everything aside and get on to constraining Jesus Hallelujah come and fill me Lord whatever is in need come and heal me tonight Lord come and seal me tonight sealing time is on Oh Come and deliver me tonight how many want a Deliverance total and complete deliverance tonight not halfway Deliverance not partial but total and complete deliverance Glory Hallelujah glory to God don't take this prayer meeting lightly tonight Hallelujah don't take this time of prayer this time of consecration don't take it lightly tonight Hallelujah just going to read two more quotes and then we're going to pray go down to pray the first message Jesus Christ is the same yesterday Bram says may we go home like those from a M they walked with you all day you talked to them you expounded the scriptures but they did not recognize it was you then that evening when you made as you would go on by he tested them to see if they were really serious he did as if he was going to go he told them he was going but they constrain you that you should come in and abide with them oh God May the disciples tonight like Copus constrain you to come and abide with us Lord hallelujah hallelujah come and abide with us Lord and when you got in their little place you shut the doors and you did something like you did before you were crucified and their eyes were open for they knew that no one did it just like that they knew it was Jesus hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Glory another message Mary's belief the ram says he walked with them all day because it was a seven mile Journey it was a long journey he walked with them all day and then he made out like he was going somewhere else are going on by and they constrained him to come in BR said oh I like that constraining him to come in oh Jesus you're here in the church tonight but you must go home with me as an individual I want to take you to my home I never want to lose this feeling of your presence let me take you home and come in and abide with me I never want to lose that feeling Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah constraining Jesus so tonight Jesus is passing by your way notice did did not invite Jesus they were going their way and Jesus came and walked with them and tonight Jesus is passing by your way wherever you are tonight maybe in your car and your room and your wherever you are he's passing your way and maybe he has blessed you before you've served him and he has blessed you before maybe you were sick and he has healed you before but maybe tonight you want more you want a deeper experience with him not a shallow superficial thing but something deeper a filling or a refilling grab a hold of him tonight and constrain him don't let him just pass by easily grab a hold of him tonight and constra him Hallelujah glory to God I'll tell you something Jesus loves it when you show him that you need him and when you show him that he is the most important thing in your life he is actually a jealous God Amen so show him tonight that he's the most important thing in your life and whatever it is that you have need of Reach Out And Touch him tonight constrain him as he passes by let tonight be your night amen don't let him pass you by tonight as he go down to pray
