[56:11] expected me frustrated because this

[57:56] the way or call if this is the word
[58:01] hallelujah but a pranam I love this part

[58:16] is his perfection of his world and he
[58:19] shows you in you never chose him he
[58:23] brought you into Christ and you are
[58:24] secure with Jesus Christ just as perfect
[58:27] as Christ was before God so it's not
[58:29] your perfection is might not like my
[58:31] profession its perfection by his word or
[58:34] glory of God so God became from God to
[58:37] become me the take my sin upon him that
[58:39] he might make him me him back to this
[58:42] great purpose of son and daughters of
[58:44] God for he is the eternal father the
[58:47] attribute was in him so he had to be
[58:49] split so you see the whole tree fall
[58:53] purpose to express himself he has to
[58:55] express himself in a man to become a
[58:58] savior so
[58:59] first spirit thought Elohim then logos
[59:03] well theophany would buddy

[1:30:40] of that magnet not make perfect you're
[1:30:43] the capstone magnet right of Jesus

[1:31:20] that Alleluia
[1:31:23] let me see I wrapped up yes oh boy it's
[1:31:26] the body of the word which is Christ
[1:31:29] outside of that you are lost I don't
[1:31:32] care how good you are what your
[1:31:34] relationship is what your fellowship is
[1:31:37] what your organization is you're lost
[1:31:39] outside of that world being in you you
[1:31:48] become a prisoner to him the world is
[1:31:50] dead you have nothing more you see the
[1:31:52] rest of the people living the way they
[1:31:53] do but yet you do not do it because
[1:31:54] you're a prisoner you are used to him
[1:31:59] hallelujah my god I'm gonna leave the
[1:32:02] rest gonna come please my god it's a
[1:32:08] beautiful question but a Branum one of
[1:32:10] the tips of the seven churches if you
[1:32:12] mentioned that Judas have been justified
[1:32:13] sanctified what is genuine is it as a
[1:32:16] good one experience of grace that he
[1:32:18] received you also many other jewelers
[1:32:20] had his name and on the book of life and
[1:32:22] yet we know he went to Hades and was
[1:32:24] lost
[1:32:24] how can a person have their name on the
[1:32:26] book of life I said be lost or why does
[1:32:29] that God put a person name on the book
[1:32:30] of life when he knows that will be lost
[1:32:32] at the end he said that's a good one
[1:32:35] isn't it I think I will leave that one
[1:32:41] but the point about it every life is
[1:32:43] recorded in the book but your own is a
[1:32:46] new blood section that cannot be erased
[1:32:49] and that is enough to make you walk only
[1:32:52] Church skipping
[1:32:55] that's enough your name canopy with
[1:32:58] [Music]
[1:33:00] Satan says I'm trying to do so Lucia
[1:33:03] Lucia here tonight I am still there they
[1:33:08] have a seal on that man you see me in a
[1:33:11] meadow but he carries it that was
[1:33:13] stealin that name God seal your name he
[1:33:17] said father I have what they work with
[1:33:19] me before the world began them brothers
[1:33:21] do have a clue what Jesus talking about
[1:33:22] but he praying for them glorify them
[1:33:25] with a glory and apathy before the world
[1:33:27] began or glory look what that there may
[1:33:30] be one father as you are worried of God
[1:33:33] that they all may be wanting us you and
[1:33:36] me and ing and the church is probably
[1:33:45] one if the pastor so wanted call is
[1:33:48] caught out what is enough flood a
[1:33:50] rainbow falls fall fall fall fall when
[1:33:54] the thing is I'm creating water is
[1:33:55] racism
[1:33:56] after watch them the students fellowship
[1:33:58] Global rock the message world there's
[1:34:01] gonna be one more Rafi there's gonna be
[1:34:04] a unity of the faith I'm going to preach
[1:34:06] it it's not a one-man show a coupe to
[1:34:08] the side a nice pride what I was talking
[1:34:10] about as a cult in some corner some way
[1:34:17] we take the shoes I'm going once I
[1:34:20] change you see the qualities aside he
[1:34:24] call a man aside I'm antic natural site
[1:34:27] getting off them off everybody off
[1:34:29] everybody off
[1:34:30] he not telling them he is on y'know the
[1:34:34] psychology behind is not is onion off of
[1:34:36] off or under people see who caught his
[1:34:39] heart that is my own man because I were
[1:34:43] ears off this one I fought so hard for
[1:34:47] boy if I go to force with David and
[1:34:51] Solomon and you stop believable
[1:34:57] no no no no serious if you said a tick
[1:35:01] off false with these guys after one just
