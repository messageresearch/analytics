need to hear from you our hearts are hungering and thirsting tonight after righteousness have your own way bless the word that be read may you sanctify our hearts to speak it sanctify our hearts to receive it in Jesus I ask it amen God bless you and welcome if you have your Bibles like it turn to uh Acts chapter 10 we want to read uh two portions from in there 1 to6 and 30 to 48 and um we'll see what the Lord will do Acts chapter 10 there was a certain man in ceria named called Cornelius a centurion of the band called The Italian band devout man one that feared God with all his house which give much arms to the people and pray to God always he saw in a vision evidently but the nth hour of the day an angel of God coming to him saying unto Cornelius and when he had looked on him he was afraid and said what is it Lord he said unto him thy prayers and thine arms are come up for a memorial before God now send men to Jer and call for one Simon whose surname is Peter is very specific he lth with one Simon at Tanner whose house is by the seaside he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do let's go down to verse 30 Cornelius speaking to speak and talking to Peter cornelus said four days ago I was fasting until this hour and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house and behold a man stood Before Me In Bright clothing he said Cornelius thy prayer is heard thine arms are hard and Remembrance in the sight of God send therefore to Jer call H Simon who s is Peter he is lodged in a house of one Simon a Tanner by the seaside who when he cometh shall speak unto thee immediately therefore I sent to thee that thou well well done that thou had come now therefore are we all here present before God to hear all things that are commanded thee of God then Peter opened his mouth and said of a truth I perceive that God is no respector of persons but in every nation he that fearth him and work at righteousness is accepted with him the word which God sent unto the to children of Israel preaching Peace by Jesus Christ he's Lord of all and that word I say you know which was published throughout all Judea and began from Galilee after the baptism which John preached now God anointed Jesus of Nazareth so so so Peter is preaching now and God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost with power who went about doing good healing all that were oppressed of the devil for God was with him and we Are Witnesses of things which he did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem whom they slew and hung on a tree him God raised up the third day and showed him openly not to all the people but unto Witness chosen before God even to us who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead and he commanded us to preach unto the people and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be judged of the quick and the dead or the living and the dead to him gave all the prophets witness that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on all all them which heard the word and they of the circumcision which believe were astonished as many as came with Peter because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost for they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God then Peter then answered Peter can any man forbid water that these shouldn't be baptized now hear the words here now which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we in the Amplified the words of that in verse 47 says can anyone forbid or refuse water for baptizing these people seeing that they have received the Holy Spirit just as we have and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord they prayed at him to T certain days let's pray father we thank you for your word is exciting tonight to read these holy scriptures Lord make it alive to us real to us in Jesus name we ask it amen and amen you may be seated pray praise God is great to be here tonight uh rain rainy night but God is good okay I have a title the Holy Ghost fell upon them who heard the word Holy Ghost fell upon them who heard the word we know this man was just and devout give of arms and so on but I have an inspiration and these are the words from verse 47 Amplified theyed the Holy Spirit just as we have no different one the same holy ghost that got in the upper room Peter saw these people receive that same holy spirit all right so brother Bram says now he's talking about he is going to get a change of ministry and he said another one is going to happen and I'm grateful to God that the hour is soon at hand I believe it when God is going to help his children especially it will be for those who can't must the faith to raise up and get a hold of God like they should so he's defining that there are some of God's children who just can't seem to must up that fith and God going to help them amen now we know he's talking about his thir P right he said I believe the Lord is providing a way for us now to take care of them also some runs into the FI and they can just reach over and receive anything why that's the great fate some of them have Mustard Seed fate and has to wait so long to get through Hallelujah I believe the Lord is making a way for those people nowall do you believe that so you could see one size doesn't fit all and this is how God view this Kingdom but BR you can never be so good you can live a clean life you can go to church every day you can sacrifice every day you can give part of your money you can give all give up all the sins of the world and everything and live just as true and faithful as you can and you'll miss Heaven as far as E From The W it isn't by goodness are we saved Hallelujah but by his Mercy that we are brought goodness he said that is what God wanted to make Sons and Daughters goodness never makes them the spirit of God is what makes them so you could stop smoking stop drinking stop lying stop everything you're doing wrong and you still can't make it because that's you stopping that is you doing this and you doing that but what he is saying here is not goodness to make you it's the spirit of God to make you because if goodness could make you you don't need the spirit you just you just be goody to shoes just be a good man good woman Good Wife good husband and then you're making into the kingdom you don't need cross you don't need the blood you don't need the calvary you don't need Jesus your goodness is what pull you true he said that's not working here if the spirit I think last Sunday we say success not success bear witness of God is the spirit bear witness of God Amen if it wasn't so hear this part watch goodness never makes them the spirit of God is what makes them if it wasn't so he wouldn't have had to send the Holy Ghost so the Holy Ghost was sent to be a power to influence and transform your life Hallelujah that is why it's ridiculous having a form of godliness but denying the power to change they love to say Amen they love to to saying love special love to clap or whatnot but Power it has to have power to change you from what you are into what God want you to be that's the power of the Gospel that's the power of the word brother BR the coming of the Son of God is drawing nigh and only those who are charged by the Holy Ghost shout out charge tonight right those that are charged by the Holy Ghost who has Immortal Life living in them that's the type that's going to be drawn from here hallelujah oh glory to not church members those who are charged with the Holy Ghost Hallelujah glory to God you know when your cell phone going on you had to plug it in and get charge but God want you to charge up with the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost there is a Jo power not from the church here we go not from the pastor but from Glory this baptism of the holy ghost moving down in that live channel to draw up the church what it is is the power of God hallelujah giving you access to his life which is Zo Give the Lord some Praises tonight Hallelujah now God promised to meet the need of the hour he always does that and we need the voice of God today to meet the need of the hour to meet the time that we are living in after you promised it you can rest assure he will keep his promise and today one of the reason that the church is in the condition it's in is because of so many voices so many other voices to attract the church from the voice of God there are so many other voices that when it's God promised he would give us that if the other voices are contrary to the voice of God it must be the voice of our enemy to confuse us that we would not understand the voice of God when it spoke there are so many voices in the Earth today that it is absolutely a hard thing because it deaden the voice of the supernatural do you see it now every other voice is to deaden the voice of the supernatural because the devil want the intellectual church that the power can't move he want a dead church that the power can move he want a church that doesn't worship he want a church to have books and tapes and they believe they going to Rapture dead a DA you Satan don't even touch them because they dead already there are so many intellectual voices great voices of mighty man they not small fries now this is the dealing with the big guys mighty man who are intellectual and in their intellectual conditions even Shake Nations they are not just overnight people but they Shake Nations and persons would be a bit confused how that these things can go on and prosper and it causes the voice of God to be placed way back somewhere now the brother brandham is prophesying of what people will be seeing here and the voice of God they say how will we know it's the voice of God today because then it wasn't a Vindicated Prophet so he is going forward in time and looking back and saying what people would say because then it wasn't a Vindicated Prophet William brandham how will we know the voice of God today he said a true voice of God only brings back the real living Supernatural god with the supernatural word with the supernatural manifestation of the true word oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God so the true voice of God always tries to bring a manif Ed reality a present tense reality a present tense awareness that God is real he's alive he do heal he do deliver he's open blind eyes he set the captive free he open the prison doors that's the God we serve tonight when there is no way he could make a way do you believe that that he can make a way for you you don't have to remain sick in your body you could be healing your spirit you could be healing your body and you could be healing your Soul not only you but your family also your loved one also oh give the Lord a praise let's go the church feels it don't need the holy spirit because we have the seals now we have Mysteries now they don't need the Holy Spirit the churches will tell you that men will stand up and give you such an intellectual talk it could almost make you believe it they could make and he could make but says it is intellectual talks so smooth it will deceive the people it is Gospel it is men who handled the word in such a way that he could almost make any intellectual person if you're trusting intellectual they will condemn the Holy Spirit but that is the way of man oh praise God but Amos prophesied in Amos 8 he said behold the days come sayth Lord God I will send a famine in the land not famine for bread or thirst for water but for the hearing of the words of the Lord and they shall wand from sea to Sea from the north to the east they shall run to and fro the word of the Lord and shall not find it notice he didn't say a famine for the word but for the hearing the hearing of the word Oh Glory to God the hearing of the word then it wasn't a Vindicated Prophet now it's going to be a bride because the bride will get a voice the word will be in the bride and the bride will give me the voice she will be the final voice to the final age once more the world will hear direct from God hallelujah famine for the hearing why they can't hear the word of God why they want to receive the word of God Romans 10 says and how shall they call on him in whom they have not believed how shall they believe in him whom they have not heard how shall they not hear without a preacher and how shall they preach except he be sent some just went but they're going some that God will send oh God good Lord praise God it will be some sent ones sent ones to the Bride of Jesus Christ sent ones to the body of Christ Give the Lord some Praises so then Faith coming by hearing and if they can't hear the word brother the kangi how they get Faith to stand how they get Faith to overcome if they can't hear present than gospel and they talk about the prophet went here and the prophet went here he why went Arizona and when he turn west and we go east and he go north and he go south and he do this and he go do that that is just his testimony but Faith come by hearing the word Oh Glory to God Amen Faith come by hearing and hearing by the word of God hallelujah Mark 4:24 says and take heed what you hear amen with what measure you meet it shall be measured to you and unto you that hear more shall be given and he that ha to him shall be given and he that had not from him shall be taken even what he had Amplified he said unto them be careful what you are hearing the measure of thought and study you give to the truth that you hear so if you're hearing foolishness and fables you see what going on here now the measure of thought and study you give to the truth you hear will be the measure of virtue and knowledge that come back to you and more besides will be given to you who hear for him who has will be given more will be given and him who has nothing even what he has will be taken away by force they would lose what L they have so you can't stay here in famine land you have to be feasting on the unfall word of God feasting on the full body word of the son of man oh glory to God Hallelujah Luke 10:16 said he that despise hear it you hear it me we coming on to that now he that despiseth you despiseth me and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me that proves that God speaks his message through his servants always has that's right now B Braham says has Christ got all power Christ has all power in Heaven and Earth you believe that watch this he is the seed word in his body and he in us become the seed word in us all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was poured into the church and that's the power Hallelujah now remember the seed of Christ must come through his body not through a denomination but through a born again seed of the word amen it must come through that which is Christ seed how does my seed come through the body how does the apple seed come through the body Hallelujah seed is through the body and the church is the body of Christ Hallelujah the birth produces that new birth himself in the body so let's go back to Cornelius now oh give the Lord a house shout in the house he was just and devout he was a gentile he was hungering he was fasting he was giving arms and his prayer was heard a gentile man a sinner man an unconverted man was praying to God and God said I heard your prayer I see the arms I see how freely give and I come now to give you instructions how you must get the Breakthrough you're looking for Give the Lord some Praises Oh Glory to God now Peter was in the body and the SE germ was in Peter the full SE germ we not talking about a man with a thought we not talking a man with a text and a man with a message we talking about a man with the full sea germ it was resident in Peter God himself couldn't get do nothing for Cornelius he had to send for Peter Give the Lord a shout did you get that God himself couldn't attend to Cornelius because the seed must come from the body and Peter was part of that body so God told him send for one Simon not any Simon the Simon who Ser name is Peter the Lord I shout Oh Glory to God very specific because this Simon he living by a man Simon the tner don't send for Simon the Tanner send for Simon Peter oh give the Lord some Praises Give the Lord I shout you mean coming back to that oh yes oh yes oh yes oh yes oh yes so B say God's law is to receive a Vindicated servant verily very unto you he that receive it whom whomsoever I send receives me and he that receives me receive that that him that sent me a Vindicated servant brother there's a thousand right here and then he said these words you can only serve God as you do and believe the servants that God sends you can only serve God on Earth see as God's servants that are sent on Earth by divine inspiration interpret the word to you you believe that so when Peter begin to speak and Testify the Holy Ghost fell ministers don't like to talk about that they want the one without sensation but this holy ghost that they had here the same one that they received it fell on every one of them it just fall on themall and they were fill with the Holy Ghost and Peter said they receive it just as we not a different kind not a different experience but the same kind the same one and that's why I keep tell telling you it's the same is Old Time Holy Spirit and the devil won't go near it that's the reason the people the men spray it but it's good enough for me give me that old time religion give me that old time I'm having R right here if you don't want to I have it right here in front of you give me that old time religion oh it will make you stop your lying it will save you when you're dying it will start the devil flying but it's good enough for me oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah brother brandom watch the pure in heart shall see God but the reason we Builders were not getting anywhere the Chief Cornerstone was rejected and that's what the matter today the Chief Cornerstone we speak of it what our church believes what what you don't believe we teach it in pump it in everything like that but the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the power of God here what it's for to Let Freedom in amongst the people is rejected so that is what the Holy Ghost does it doesn't bind you to the minister it doesn't bind you to your church pew where you can't even raise up your hand you're stiff and the devil sitting on top of your top lip you can't say Amen because the devil have a weight on top your top lip Hallelujah have your mouth closed the Holy Ghost just loose your lip let's loose your tongue you're speaking another tongue Holy Ghost loose your hands your feet Hallelujah make you drunk like drunk men the Holy G Make You Dance in the spirit the Holy Ghost make you act different okay and out of your stin rotten Trinidad flesh the Holy Ghost come make it come out of that I always say amen and your hand sticking up so like if God want that keep your keep that for yourself oh give the Lord a shout them four Beast them 24 Elders cast on the crown Bing wordy and hosana and people talking about the name on what book what book Church book that's why you're dead as a door H if you see a name on the Lamb's Book no Pastor no Deacon no Elder could stop you from giving true lamb worship oh give the Lord some Praises because now we have truth and spirit Spirit oh the worshippers could worship the worshipper could arise right now the true worshippers coming forth now to Worship in spirit and in truth all these years we didn't have the truth but causing a prophet to reveal the entire Bible to bring back the truth back in the church we supposed to have a powerful worship every Church in this message should have a powerful praise unto God oh give the Lord a shout I don't care what you're going through Hallelujah worry wouldn't change what they're going through Hallelujah mental battles wasn't change what they true Give the Lord some Praises that is a liar hallelujah hallelujah glory to God glory to God hallelujah glory to God the baptism Holy Ghost and the power of God to Let Freedom in amongst the people so they don't want freedom they want intellectual talk you know what I'm saying there they train words and they train words here outside service Minister talking train words with the people so see the next me funny and that man might be p with full body German they can't send for him they don't reject him too you see that now you see the nastiness in this message with men so evil seed against this group and that group and this Minister and that Minister and they're not understanding God is suffereing he don't to ask permission to send somebody Matthew was a tax collector God not to call him who loves Tax Collectors they come and collect tax in but God call Matthew and make sure Peter in church and Matthew standing right behind Peter and when Jus said turn around greet your brother turn see Matthew turn back Jus said turn around and greet your brother Peter don't the Holy Ghost yet he grading turned around and but he to look at you in the eyes ow some taxes maybe two hen and two cow or something so they ow something like that but you know what God called them and they have to work it out God call them have to clean it out clean up what jealousy Envy jealous of somebody's measure I didn't give me message God give me a this message it is clear like daylight to me I seen it plain plain plain he said when you see the message the rest is f material so I'm not here to preach F material I'm not here to kill time and waste time I trying to get the kernel the core the core the thing that you could get some to hold on to tonight like a Lifeline then when you walk out here you walk out here with a Lifeline with some empowerment in your spirit not killing time and talking about Rebecca and the camel and she riding down and she going the mountain and down the mountain let Rebecca ride oh give the Lord a shout you have to get this word in your soul let Rebecca continue riding she on our way to Isaac oh give the Lord some Praises Give the Lord a shout in the house hallelujah praise God hallelujah I could hear Brother terance shouting in his house Hallelujah let's go we believe that you receive the Holy Ghost by an experience not no be it done me according to your word Mary to go upper room and and stagger so too after she say be it done me we a talking about that scripture yet like mislocated and dislocating the scripture we believe that you receive the Holy Ghost by an experience not by a mythical intellectual conception of the scriptures by an experience that you alone know and if you want to know whether it was the Holy Ghost watch how your life patterns after that it will tell what kind of spirit coming to you you feel at this and you had a dream and you had this and you had this how you living after was the same rascal you you need to get back at the altar and get the Holy Ghost go give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah glory to God watch he said you got to got watch he said the only thing is you just sign your name and a church book instead of staying there instead of staying there until you got an experience that God has changed you by the baptism of the Holy Ghost it takes and this a bum brother George I think it takes an experience to accompany fi amen amen that's a big one it take what experience an experience somebody have faith and no experience what is that what what what what brother say show me your fi by your Works show me your fi without works I show by more works I show you my fi because in other words Faith supposed to produce something faith is not an Airy fairy thing how you going on I go buy a car you have a black scent by feet Hallelujah that's talk that's Trinidad mou talking that you going to buy a house you have a down payment no by faith Hallelujah the people that build the houses not building by faith you know they concrete SE and sand and money if they don't have that concrete and money they can't build by faith is not that magic one build by faith when you do hand so your hand still still doing so is money loan and whatever it is to build the house that you want to buy your responsibility is to put aside some change to save to get a down payment to buy a house that is fit when you put away your money that is fet because you have substance to make a down payment oh give the Lord some Praises I want to go there tonight Hallelujah so it takes experience to accompany fi Hallelujah let's go down but BR let me tell you the some people here Methodist presan he said people who call he said you can't organize Pentecost Pentecost is an experience for whosoever will let come whether he's Baptist Presbyterian Methodist in other words whether in this church that church that church that church if them get the Holy Ghost they have one Behavior if the Believers in the different churches get the Holy Ghost these those Believers will be able to behave themselves all right he said I don't care what color he is how big he is how little he is how low he is how bad he is doesn't make any bit of difference it's for whosoever will it's God's cleansing process for his church he cleansed by what say it out loud fire that's how God cleans by he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with and with text no and with Mysteries he shall baptize with the Holy Ghost and with Revelations no you can't find that in the Bible Fire and Fire does burn Hallelujah fire does burn you know oh glory to God hallelujah let's go I'm still quoting the baptis Holy Ghost is a personal experience hallu Jesus once said except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom people who will come and tell us that those who have accepted the experience of the baptism of Holy Ghost I am not talking about those who take it by without sensation and rolling dice like go and play lot people lot Bo to play lot because they gambling hoping this m bus they hoping the number call I not I don't want that I want what them have because Peter was able to say but these listen these men is Gentiles you know they're not Jews you know and we're going to close off to show you how Peter get a rough time when the other Brethren heard that he went among them Gentiles they cust they want to know who you we are it those dogs gen we go among them and you would hear what Peter said in defense people who will come and tell us that those who accepted the experience of the Bap holy ghost that they are Fanatics and they are some ungodly name that the devil pinned them them to call them Holy Rollers I've preached all the world I've never seen a Holy Roller yet it's a name the devil tacked on the Church of the Living God he says watch it wasn't so from the beginning I'm a presbyterian it wasn't so from the beginning what was in the beginning a Pentecostal experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the way it began hallu Oh Glory to God do you believe that this night hallelujah praise God praise God you talk about Luther Wesley it's changed from Pagan is back to original grain he says now watch he says now what and today it's ripe he said it's the same Holy Ghost that's manifested today from glory and glory to glory and his back to his Original Seed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost with the same signs with the same wonders with the same baptism same kind of people acting the same way with the same power the same Sensation from glory to glory not acting messages the people message you I mean we you know we don't make that kind of noise some people complaining because we making much noise praise God I was tell somebody in Germany talking about you know we just make too much a noise some like the noise some don't like the noise because you know Germans we take it easy L Lutheran spirits still there PR they go to Luther Lutheran through Germany and they still had that Lutheran spirit inside of there but brother brandham he was preaching he said I preach with Paul on Ms Hill I was with John on the a of pmos I was with Luton resur Reformation I was with Wesley with a fire brand that snatched on fire against the Anan church and here am I tonight 1964 in Philadelphia Pennsylvania identified with the same kind of group with the same kind of experience I must be to be a Christian I must stay identified where the word of God is being manifested I'm identified with a group that feels the spirit of God I am identified with a group that knows he's unveil that knows he's the same yesterday today and forever that knows that this is not fanaticism it is Jesus Christ the same I yesterday today and forever I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ Oh Glory to he said to be a Christian I have to stay identified I'm identified no a group because they have a ton of mysteries and have to preach for 4 hours to explain the Mysteries away I'm not identify with that I'm identify with a group that feels the spirit of God knows that he's unfiled he's the same yesterday forever and this is not fanaticism if you see me jump here tonight that's not fanaticism I'm a jumping preacher Oh Glory to God give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God praise God praise God amen amen there's one thing lays between you and the promised land what is the promised land the Holy Ghost what lay between Joshua and the promised land was Jordan oh Hallelujah the promised land is what the Holy Ghost he said behold I S the promise of my father upon you Peter said the Pentecost the promised land is to live in this land of the Holy Spirit I think how much books a man have how much tapes you have amount of bad behavior I see with people and they're supposed to be in this message this glorious message is still misbehaving out there on and public and everything else but the promised land is to live in this land of the Holy Spirit that's God's promise for the church is to live in the power of the spirit it's another world it's another land you have to come out of the condition that you've been in and come out to live in this promised land to receive the promise oh give the Lord some praises the Lord I shout in the house when brother bam tasted of land that land he didn't want to let go he wanted that land all the

himself can I continue to ripen or to vindicate or to prove or to make manifested what he predicted would happen in this day and then he said the even light produces that so this is a prophecy of a even light for the bride Hallelujah not William Ram even light the even light for the bride which will be a power which will be the Holy Ghost himself to vindicate to prove to make manifest what he predicted oh praise God praise God praise God get ready musicians get ready hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God you wouldn't believe it we're almost there acts 11 verse 1 I want to read that for you Lord we just read from acts 10 acts 11 and the apostles and Brethren that were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God and when Peter was come to Jerusalem they that were of the circumcision contended with him in the Amplified so when Peter went Jerusalem the circumcision party certain Jewish Christians found fault with him separating themselves from him in a hostile Spirit opposing disputing and contended with him saying why did you go to the uncircumcised men and even eat with them that was the challenge by this is fine chur his brothers that you're shaking hands with every Sunday every Wednesday night but Peter here we go rehearsed the matter from the beginning and expounded it by order saying I was in a city of Jer praying and a TR I saw a vision a certain vessel descended it was a great sheath let down from the heaven by Four Corners it came to me upon the which I fastened my eyes and considered and saw four-footed Beasts of the earth wild beast creeping Things Fall of the air I Heard a Voice saying unto me arise Peter slay and eat I said not so Lord For Nothing common unclean at any time entered into my mouth but the voice answered me again from Heaven what God has cleansed thou shal not call common and this was done three times and were drawn up again into heaven and behold immediately there was three men already coming to the house where I was sent from CES unto me and the spirit B me not I call headquarters the spirit B me to go with them nothing doubting more of these six Brethren accompanied me and we entered into the man's house and he showed us how he had seen an angel in his house which stood and said unto him send men to Jer and call for Simon whose her name is Peter who shall tell the words thereby thou shal all thy house shall be saved and as I begin to speak the Holy Ghost fell on them as on us at the beginning oh give the Lord a shout oh give the Lord a praise in the house Peter was given a testimony and as they begin to speak the Holy Ghost fell on them as at the beginning then remembered I the word of the Lord he said John indeed baptized with water but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost for as much then as God give them the like gift as he did to us who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ what was I that I could withstand God he busted them he said the same gift we got them Gentiles got who am I to fight God you may be seated I'm on was done Verse 18 says when they heard these things they held their peace they shut up and glorify God saying then had God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life Hallelujah busted them so if you think you're having it easy because you have a testimony of being led by the Holy Ghost why you going among them non Thunders Brethren if was so and so they never go there they never go there that is them but I was led by the spirit to go this way amen but those Breen don't believe we believe that believe could believe you hold your peace CU you are not my Holy Ghost Jesus you are not my guide Jesus John 14 says if he ask anything in my name I will do it Hallelujah this is Jesus speaks if you love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father he will give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it sees him not you know it him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you prophecy yet a little while the world see me no more but you see me because I live you shall also at that day you shall know that I'm in the father ye in me and I in you he that had my Commandments and keepeth them he that loveth me he that loveth me shall be led of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him Judas said unto him not his scariot Lord how is it that thou would manifest thyself unto us not un the world Jesus answered unto him if I love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our board with him so what was the H given for to continue his plans through the church that's the purpose of the Holy
