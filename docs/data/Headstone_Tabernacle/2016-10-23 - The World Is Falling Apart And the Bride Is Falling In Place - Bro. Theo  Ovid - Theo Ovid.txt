scripture this morning Luke chapter 4 we want to read from verse 14- 21 Luke 4 verse 14- 21 scripture reading this morning thank you Lord and Jesus returned in the power of the spirit into Galilee and there went out a Fame of him throughout all the region round about and he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of The Prophet Isaias and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he had anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he had sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives the recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears let's bow our head one more time father we thank you for your holy word god may we find where it's written in your word about our place in Christ this morning come and confirm your word with signs wonders and miracles we ask in Jesus name amen and amen God bless you you may be seated Hallelujah GL praise the Lord I have a title this morning the world is falling apart and the bride is falling in place Hallelujah that's my tile this morning the world is falling apart the bride is Fallen its place have an inspiration it is later than you think that's my inspiration it is later than you think now the Bible is the word of God and Jesus used to go to that Temple to find scriptures or they would find scriptures to read notice the scripture we tonight that Jesus found the place where it was written amen before he even started out on this great ministry to effectively perform the works of his father he had us to find his scripture amen your scripture have to do with your purpose with your destiny what God has ordained for your life your life is not worthless your life is not a mishap your life is not like something just trips in through time and you're going through suffering and struggling no your life have a purpose behind that for a message of communion but brandom then God showed in Abraham what he would do for all Not only was the Blessed promise of the resurrection and eternal life given to Abraham but to his seed after him the elected of God Amen and be notice that Abraham out in the fields was adjourning his brother he called lot Israel his nephew at the time here we go at the time come for the testing oh yeah you're Christian you believe the Lord You're serving the lord you're doing good you're trying to be evil but don't nobody and you're expecting everything to work fine but there's a Time come where it's called a time of testing say testing testing that time come to everyone a time of testing a church get tested homes get tested marriage get tested Health get tested a time of test things that you don't even can explain sometime the winds are contrary you didn't start it you didn't cause it but things are just contrary all around you that's a testing time it just comes you didn't set it you didn't start it you didn't arrange it it just comes that's the time of testing God expect a certain attitude of you when your time come and God looking on no babies God looking for men and women God looking for sons and daughters you're looking for Rascals he looking for scamps no he looking for real sons and daughters of God though he slay me yet I'll trust him that's who he's looking for that's the men of God is how he's looking for he looking for young men that wouldn't back down young men that will be a standard for Jesus a stand up for the Lord is that right let's continue now but in the time of testing lot weakened under the testing he's a perfect picture of the caral believer so it have spiritual believer and it have natural caral believer all the interested in house and food and car and pay and money and just natural people come into church saying Glory hallelujah amen praise God God bless you forget about that that's that's just time that's that's wasting time it doesn't make sense being a canal believer being a natural person what is in it for me forget about that what's in it for the kingdom not for you it's about not about you it's about the kingdom because it's later than you think remember the only thing that counts here we go is what you do for the kingdom of God your car will not count your land will not count the money in your banking have will not count what will count is what you do for the kingdom and the kingdom is not in meat and drink but in power in the Holy Ghost come on now can somebody say amen hallelujah we are pressing into a kingdom that is why Jesus was a missa how to say it he came and he came in a critical time in the lives of these people because they were under oppression of the Romans and they were looking for a deliverer not just a deliverer to say h God bless you and blessed at the PO heart not that kind of looking for looking for somebody to conquer Rome somebody to have victory over all these Roman armies somebody to rebel against Rome and all a sudden after you get this popular rise up of this young man he said this kingdom is my kingdom is not of this world my God if my kingdom was of this world my men would fight for me I come to introduce a higher Kingdom a higher order a god class a higher class of people not a carnal natural fleshly ungodly not that come on help me preach back somebody don't just look at me this morning I'm not here to entertain you I'm here to work with you oh glory to God he said my kingdom is not of this world if of this world my men would fight for me there was a higher order Oh Glory there's a higher class there was a higher people a super race Oh Glory to God hler wanted it he couldn't make it Napoleon wanted it he couldn't get it but God going to have it a super race out of many peoples Nations tongues oh give the Lord I shout no wonder Daniel said the people that know their God shall be strong and do great exploits this world is falling apart but the bride is getting a step you heard what I said the world is falling apart it's rocking Oh Glory to God nothing going to change it am you know I field this morning you may be seated Hallelujah I don't care if

have fallen Hallelujah there's only one more and I can't the IND say babyon has fallen Babylon has fallen Babylon has fallen it's Fallen because another kingdom is coming and Daniel say I saw a stone cut out without the hands of man no Pastor cutting that stone no Apostle cutting that stone no Prophet cutting that stone that stone cuts out give the Lord a praise inside of here that stone cuts out without the hands of man Oh Glory that stone is on its way it's the Capstone it's The Headstone it's the chief Stone it's the ceiling Stone it's the stone that the bride is waiting for oh do I hear a shouting in the [Applause] house as the wheels begin to turn you would realize we have not believed fables you would realize that God sent a 20th century Prophet according to Malachi 4 behold I send you Elijah the prophet and he going to come before just before the terrible day of the Lord a terrible day is coming a dread day is coming has already started World War I that's finished World War II is finished there's only one more that's World War I because the Earth is in bird pains the Earth is in travail the Earth is shaken up because John saw a new Heaven and John so and new earth and for the new Heaven and new earth to come there got to be a Breaking of there got to be a bur pain there got to be a shaken and and before the earth begin to shake the bride have to get a shaken there have not been Revival to shake that bride but there's going to come seven Thunders and that seven Thunder going to rock that bride back into her position come on now you know she going to find her place oh give the Lord a shout in the house M I'm excited about Jesus I'm excited about these promises I'm excited about what God is about to do [Applause] lot we still Le lot you see God spoke to Abraham not lot yes lot came along and when you are called of God and spoken to by God With God whoever along with you getting blessed to so because lot hang around blessing falling off just dropping on lot don't even know where it coming from he gets so big he could choose to to go here and choose to go there and choose to go here and do his own thing because that's when people are they have nothing they suffering and God put some blessing upon them all of a sudden they're big shot they're arrogant nobody can talk to them they don't need God they don't don't forget where they come from but that's when you got to remember what where God brought you out he brought me on the mar clear he set my feet on a rock to stay I am what I am by the grace of alight God where would I be without but for his blood where would I be come on say Amen somebody we got to throw down the Temple of Pride the idol of envy and jealousy mess it up destroy it praise God humble yourself under the mighty hand of almighty God thank God for his grace thank God you could raise your hands this morning and open your mouth and give God praise there are people in the hospital bed they can't even lift their hand up you got Chings

come here we go here we go the testing come to stay on the barren land Jesus Abraham give him his choice lot lifted up his eyes saw the fields the valley full of grass it was also full of fine homes it was full of gy it was full of sin but lot being caral nature loving the present World more than the things to come choose to live a luxurious in this life than the life Hereafter and Abraham a perfect type of the True Believer who had been washed in the blood of the lamb whose affections were set on things above I will take the way with the Lord's despised few regardless if it cost me my popularity whatever it cost I will take the way with the Lord's few he choose to stay in the land here we go where God placed him under the testing time we talking about holding your gr under the testing time oh Hallelujah they always look greener on the other side but when God ah positionally place you that's your place Storm come that's still your place famine come that's still your place if you stay in your place and the famine come the famine will come and go because the famine is temporary the storm will come and go because the storm is temporary but David said I my the Lord is on my right hand I shall not be moved do 10,000 fall on my right side I shall not be moved come on now David said the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he leaded me beside the still wats he restoreth my

they scream Lou that is in fat they see L that is in part don't let this bother you we know what we worship we know who we worship we know why we worship Oh Glory to God [Applause] amen hallelujah hallu you may be seated the reason I'm not worried is because God can't lie and God said my word shall not return to me void whenever God speak it it can't get back empty and the reason I'm immune from the talk of men and the voices of men is because no man on earth have anything to do with my inheritance that has been reserved for me since Glory you not hear what I said you not hearing what I [Applause] said you might be seated in a minute notice but Isaac brought her so tremendously when Caleb came the front of the line of Judah Caleb wasn't walking by guest Caleb didn't walking because he feeling walk and he feeling have a soul that day every walk he was nearer to what he was fighting for every walk he was nearer in what he believed every walk he was closer to his possession inheritance notice what Caleb said Caleb tell Joshua you know what Moses said about the land about you and me since on the other side you not hear what I'm saying that land was given since before before the cross before the Cross Jordan you don't hear what I'm saying and I'm saying before the foundation of the world God give us a portion no devil ain't going to stop us we come too far to turn back now all hell was against this prayer line all hell came against this service I wasn't even supposed to preach this morning but the devil is a liar God ordained me to be here this morning okay the

[Applause] action Glory Glory may be seated you know what you fighting for I want you to help me you fighting to create an atmosphere the atmosphere is what makes the difference brother brandham came in a service and with five minutes whe people to come out the wheelchair he said the angel was present the atmosphere did it that's why you can't come here with your intellectual looking to find out and take down notes no take the tape afterwards and take all the notes you want but when you come to service you have to take note that you have been with Jesus forget all them paper notes get the tape get the tape get the tape it's on on YouTube channel headstone Tabernacle YouTube channel it's on Facebook take your notes off of that but when you come here I was in the spirit and suddenly I Heard a Voice a voice said come up here that's what you come here for you come here to get in the spirit that you get the voice of the Archangel that you get the voice of God am [Applause] [Applause] so Abraham choose to stay in his position in the time of testing amen I may have a vision some man had years ago sometime I used to speak about it about the horses a vision in the last day or the

be used by the master because the horse was no harnessed the horse say pull right pull left go forward that's a horse that could be used that's a horse that God could ride do I hear a shout in the [Applause] house you see that's why people don't look at what's coming they look at their money they don't see when they sick and the money can help them and the doctor say money can work and now they're looking for somebody to pray for them because oh God see that that that that's what come down to they don't want to say oh God because they have money they feel they could buy God buy the

beloved nation and to be here to give a testimony of thy son Jesus who has died to redeem this lost race of people throughout all the world Amen and now you have gathered us here together this afternoon to pour out your spirit upon us I believe May every man woman boy or girl from every church here we go listen to carefully to this prayer Hallelujah May every man woman boy or girl from every church every Creed denomination race color forget all about the past now so he is saying I don't care if you're Catholic if you're white if you're yellow you're pink or you're blue where you come from what church belong to this is what he is saying here now forget about the past let's look to the Future Let's look to that continuing city that is to come Cleveland is home to many thousands millions over a million people here God we pray that men and women will never be satisfied until they have met peace with you so that we can go to that continuing City amen he's still praying amen looking upon that giant skyscraper in the city looking upon the fine buildings and structures but there'll be a time when there won't be one stone left upon another we believe that these cities in this great major conflict that's coming will be rocked with atomic Powers am and millions will die in hours now I know this is not preached or spoken because people talking about coming to Jesus everything will be all right and and come to Jesus and everything will work out and nice and positive and whatnot but this is also the word amen it is later than you think let me continue Millions will die in hours blow to bits even the Earth shook from its offit going to the sun great heat shall Scorch men as the script says in the Book of Revelation now help us God to get our mind on you and settle down to go into this bloody Trail I review it Lord the best of my knowledge you help me as I start from the beginning and you put your hand on your poor humble servant and may all my mistakes today May others and young boys and girls who coming on May they be stepping stones to bring them to thee may they profit for my eror of suffering that they might know you in the power of your Resurrection for we ask it in the name of th beloved Child Jesus Amen Let put still with me everybody attentive everybody listening this is 1951 in Toledo Ohio now this is a year about a year later he's speaking in Toledo Ohio so first was uh uh uh Cleveland this is to when we were little children we live up in a hill in the place a little old kind of looking Affair half clapboard half weatherboard the house was was so strong lugs and weatherboard put over it I thought that house will never go away from there when I entered Toledo and went some of your streets where your lovely homes are the other day I was riding and stopped on an old truck was about half back I wouldn't say it's backslid his truck it's got 150,000 mi in it it just wor out it's not backslid so I went down those streeks and how beautiful it looked and I thought the lovely homes and the people just look like live in Paradise talking about Toledo Ohio and this is a lovely city right here near the lake would like to live here myself but friends there will be a time that there won't be any more Toledo here now that is not skin milk amen that's a prophet and a prophet is not somebody that predicts a prophet goes into the future comes back and speaks what he sees you can't change that because Prophet spoke it there'll be a time where there won't be no B left that's right one of these days an atomic bomb will strike this place there won't be anything left of it and you know that right we are living up in that age right now and it's later than you think amen amen amen from the resurrection of Lazarus he said now I believe that there's a move going on God is warning as it was in the days of Noah getting the people ready something is about to happen the atomic powers and things that are

amen because what we have now can make it waving books and tapes at what amen and people feel like against books and tapes but I'm reading from the books it's so foolish I'm preaching from the books i'me I'm making a point that after 50 plus years we can't shake no book in The Devil's face Jesus returning the power of the spirit Give the Lord some Praises people my God you making a feel to preach this morning glory to God remember to pray for me for IND you pray for [Applause] me after whipping that devil in the wilderness straighten them out but just as alone not a whiff of power not a whiff of anointing devil smelling he can't smell no blood off of Jesus he just had to say that man is different boy I couldn't catch him with power I couldn't catch him with lust of the eyes I couldn't catch him with the pride of life I couldn't catch him with the lust of the flesh that man is different boy when Jesus overcome by his written he walk into the temple under the Supreme anointing which is knowing what and how that's the Supreme anointing he know where he want to go he know what scripture he want to read he has to find the scroll he has to look through the scroll he found Isaiah he had to spin it on to get Isaiah 61 and begin to read the spirit is upon me they thought he was reading scripture but he was reading about himself he found his place he found his purpose he found his Destiny he found what he was raised up for do Shout the house and the bride was raised up to destroy the works of the enemy do I had a scream in the hes we were raised up to cast out Devils we were raised up to heal the sick we were raised up [Applause] [Applause] Hallelujah Hallelujah Spirit the spirit is upon me before you could go fulfill purpose you have to find the place where it is written you have to find your scriptures therefore if you're not in the word you can't find no place you hearing what a man saying but when you connect to your word who could take away your word who could take away your purpose you have to find your place my God I could see that mother have that child and that child going to get some Five Loaves and two fishes maybe they takes to some family that mother was inspired to bake Five Loaves and two fishes and that little boy was going to deliver Five Loaves and two fishes on his way he saw a crowd on the way he heard Jesus a little boy come to the front he didn't know his purpose he didn't know what was going to happen he didn't know what he had in his bag was going to feel 5,000 people and Jesus stood there preaching and the boy he was so entralled he was so engrossed in what the words being spoken time must have just run away all of a sudden Jesus said it it's late we can't send the people hungry what do we have and they said look a little boy here they look into his bag maybe the bread was smelling they look into his bag and said this boy have Five Loaves and two fishes but what are these among so many what you going to do with Five Loaves and two fishes I want to ask you this morning what do you have don't say what are these among so many my god look small but in whose hands they're going to place those Five Loaves and two fishes Jesus took it Jesus blessed it Jesus thanked the father for it he wasn't wretched he wasn't ungrateful you may be seated Oh Glory [Applause] change your pictures change your perspective Jesus Took Five Loaves two fishes Dan said boy I come to buy it that boy was there for that purpose and Jesus blessed it and sa just begin to share it you know the story everybody got something to eat

waiting for what's everything waiting for what's the whole creation waiting for it is waiting for the church to come into its position Hallelujah God is trying to place his church in position to manifest himself not manifest Church self not manifest Pastor self Apostle self Prophet self teacher self Evangel no no himself so at the end of it no man get no glory at the end of it God has to be glorified I'll give you an example when Peter went and said Silver and Gold Have I None such as I have I given unto you rise up and walk when the man rose up and walked people start see Peter like a god good good Peter Peter Peter Peter Peter had to Red them and say you think it's by my strength that this man is made whole amen he says faith in Jesus name you think it's my Holiness that produ in other words don't come on me and don't don't come with that Amen Brother come on don't come and bring no man worship don't come with that don't come and try to make me some angel or something don't

same time with you and he can't do nothing because he's 3 years old he's four years old he's 5 years old 12 years old 10 years old 20 years old he can't do anything you had to wait until his appointed time come God lose John the Baptist repent repent they know John is a he's a shaken man because he his name is John he know Lite or whatever it is all them and different things he not none of those things you have a different name he went C skin honey so he wasn't in the in the modern cars and and dressing and whatnot he just just different he was John chopping blasting when they getting baptized he said bring forth fruit think I looking for membership I don't come here with that Hallelujah John was a man on fire no signs no wonders just a voice crying in the wilderness and That Shook them up to the point where they ask him are you the Messiah or are you are we to look for him to come he said me Messiah he said I am just the voice of one you yes he said the one coming after me I not even wor to take out the man latches of his shoes am don't create me he at all he's a different one he come with fire if you think I'm hot I'm only introducing the fire that coming Hallelujah but John was making the Crooked partt straight the high mountains low J like a greater a big machine to straighten path because the Messiah have to have a path to come Messiah not coming into your life without a path made for him come on let me rep somebody that's when you come to church you come to get a path cut in your life that Jesus could come and step and walk straight down that path straight into your socket of your heart do shout in the [Applause] House John and mixing with nobody John a fellowshipping with nobody John having dinner with nobody he just blasting and going back in the wilderness bapti and go back in the wilderness that is John one day a man came up to John and when John saw him a Dove came and rest on that man John never saw that man before but the one who spoke to John told John the one that you see that Dove landing and remaining not only Landing because the dove do land on people and they take off because the attitude and the growling and the Wolf Behavior but that when you land and remain that's the one so when John saw that man coming down the water to be baptized and see that Dove come upon him he said I have need for you to baptize me but Jesus said that might be so but it behooves us to fulfill all righteousness the scriptures have to be fulfilled we have to find our place come on help me help me help me Jesus help me somebody so John knew that was Messiah then he told his Behold the Lamb of God hall now right there a dispensation has changed from the prophet to the prophecy right there a hold thing changed so simply nobody knew Jesus received the power in his fullness he is Led not with a bunch of disciples and people led by the spirit alone in the wilderness overcome alone that de devil come back in the power of the spirit alone and find his scriptures now he's about to go out into the kingdom amen as a worker to find the lost Sons the elected of God now he's anointed Messiah he's now anointed he couldn't go out without the anointing he already overcome that past finished he is now anointed for purpose you want me see that let let me get go down a little deeper in this here his purpose is to hit Calvary every step is along the way he raised the dead that's not his purpose he fed the multitude that's not his purpose he's doing things he healed the sick he raised the dead he's on his way one time he try to hold him he said my hour is not yet come you can't touch me don't touch me my hour is not yet come and when his hour came he said my hour is come and he looked steadfastly towards Jerusalem because his purpose was ready his purpose was fixed so he was looking and going Direction his purpose and your purpose is to receive power Holy Ghost Dynamics healing set your faith come on now come on help me preach you are not tired you are not tired am I am tired you are not tired don't give me that am [Applause] am Jesus ministry start up slow it build up different Miracles until Lazarus re the dead when Lazar dead that that that that s fell bunkers all them Phan scribes that was it they say we have to stop this man because the whole world will go after him and our church go am so to lock these people in that why some ministers is make the people get the people their fight and make the people buy their fight so they people fighting other people other ministers other churches and wonder past fight to the people so foolish the people don't know what they fighting for that come like Family Feud afterwards little grandson ask the grandmother we what we not talking to them again for say so so long I can't remember I I I I don't know what the issue is we just don't talk with them oh my goodness Amstead of foolishness when Jesus tell his only disciples one say how long are we to forgive seven times and he told was a big number you know say 70 * 7 that fell was impressive you know he say whole s times Jesus 70 times that forgive your brother your job is not to figure out whether the repentance is right wrong halfway cucko whatever your job is to forgive if they say forgive me your job is to forgive you are responsible to forgive whatever repentance to do that's up to them and God but if somebody come there say forgive me I'm sorry and what not your job is you're really sorry your was going to say it so you go say it so forget that oh give the Lord a shout I didn't mean to go there Hallelujah when you ask God for forgiveness how you ask it how you say it you say it so how you say you said so you just say it yes sir Lord sinner Sav me you you didn't know you were a sinner you thought you was a saint and you ain't a saint until God save you now you know you're saved by the grace of God then nobody can take it out to you salvation is given by God nobody can rob you no Bandits can hold say give me your salvation he can take your wallet he can take your ID card but he can't take a Salvation he can't take the seed out your soul that's why I love what God done he put the seed in the soul Satan can't get there Satan can't get there he can't tamper with that seed that seed is original that seed is predestinated you always was a seed [Applause] yes do you see that sir that why it was easy for Jesus say Peter come sir there was no guess work Peter did know what was in him it was easy for Jesus to wait for the woman at the well because he knew what was in her she did not know but he knew so he could call out woman I that speakto you I'm here oh glory to God because he knew his position his position was Messiah amen one of God he was the book with the names in it when the anointed Oh Glory when when the lamb took the book and came down the mighty angel with the book open that book is on the earth now and the fold Ministry and you one last call one final ride to call the last predestinated seed oh hold it sit down a minute listen to this hell has enlarged its mouth because hell has more to but before hell could do all his wrap up God have a brighter call say the devil could take somebody can't take all he could receive some but not all like some brother back s years ago drunk somebody tell him God that Prophet false he say I might be drunk by stripp it there is a true 20 Cy Prophet I might have Lick in my head but I a stupid God send a prophet brother I'm not taking that my God we might be drunk with new wine but we not stupid God send a 20 the prophet why you want us to be Baptist Baptist deceive you want to be a Catholic the Catholic deceive the devil deceive all all except except those whose names written on the land Book of Life and if your name is on that book you're going to respond to the word if your name is on that book that word going to hit you that word going to get [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you listen you may be seated here one of the Mysteries in the last days no ties no denomination just the work working in the individual that's a mystery hallelujah look I like what Isaac brought out about about Caleb he didn't come to talk on behal of Judah you know he come forward Judah behind there if Judah want to claim this and claim that Judah business he say you know what Moses said about me and you now therefore give me not Judah Mountain my Mountain that's what the bride have to come to Jesus is your husband not we husband come on now you you have to have a revelation of him being your husband therefore you are wife of the Lamb not Pastor wife Pastor wife is AD Marie that's my wife some preachers they believe the church is their wife you said you know the church is the wife you know one little quote take and bind the people to themselves so the whole church Mar to the man that is madness that is just false doctrine that is cultism you and my wife who who's Al I not taking on that responsibility I'm the pastor of the church Hallelujah glory to God I go deal with alary that is my wife but you are wife of the Lamb come on give the Lord some Praises [Applause] people you may be seated let me drop this bom on you but brandham said Jesus wife or bride will not be manhandled no man in the mix no man in the mix no man in the mix pure word virgin word [Applause] bright Oh Glory to God that's why mix up no dream and the Lord tell me this and the Lord said this and this and this and this am amen amen I don't have a message I preach another man's message hallelujah amen I'm echoing a message God is trying to place his church in position to manifest himself getting one that he can work through like this and say there is my spirit flowing freely Hallelujah not there is my Mysteries teaching thoroughly not there is my scriptures on Fallen perfectly no we had that for 50 plus years I want you to see that you know yes sir yes sir that the objective is to come to the spot where God could find not a group of ministers not the Min Association he's not using that one here one there one there that God can say there is my spirit flowing hallu when you begin to see that you begin to see the ministry of Jesus Christ because Jesus that virtue that's why the woman could re uh uh withdraw from him Hallelujah are you with me he had it in him but the BR might understand 8 ft from him and it is on deep call to the Deep you could feel the anointing am so when people came up to the prayer line and they came up they feel like a wall around the he said that's just his presence Hallelujah so when you're walking into him you're not just walking you're walking into a presence because God was veiled inside a de am a rainbow was around the throne amen Angels around there an atmosphere around there there is my spirit flowing freely so he would say he preaching he said you know what I'm waiting on I'm waiting on the angel of the Lord all of a sudden he say he is here now he is here means I have the authority now to take every Spirit under my control for the glory of God because I have backups [Music] [Applause] I have Angelic beings working with me so I know not have a devil could move until I say so you don't hear what I'm saying so when he said I take every Spirit under my control for the glory of God he means that he have full authority to handle those [Applause] Devils he cast out one Spirit here and that Spirit upon this person asking for help from another another person amen then say all who have diabetes stand up because got a diabetic Spirit he's telling all them out one time Glory Spirits diabetic demons different demons demon Spirits people would Shadow with cancer you see a dark Hood over them and when he finished the dark Hood leave Spirit leave person healed natural eye not seeing no Shadow natural eye seeing a sick man or a sick woman but the spiritual eye seeing demon powers so you don't know what the man fighting behind the pulpit a real spiritual man a man under the spiritual warfare it is War people walking with demons but the Bible said in my [Applause] name so that's why you come one way and some you leave a different way because demons leave your life say how people get saved the demons leave them and they want to receive Christ because Spirit Break upon their life so the word bust demons off of you you don't even realize how much you free you are getting some things leave you don't know how you can't explain because you can't see them they come and try to influence your life demons come out of hell bam said the lid of Hells have been covered that's what Anointed The Beatles with hell come upon them that's right and the Beatles was controlling the world with their music am them fell of England there Anointed with demon powers R in the world Hallelujah anointed of demons and as hell raiseed up God to open up Heaven Amen to loose Angels down to combat hell on the earth then B say heaven consists of the word so God unlocked heaven to bring down Heaven and Earth amen that's why we have Heaven here in the form of the word so when we preach the word we preach in Heavenly places devil have no room inside here we punishing Satan inside of here we tell him get behind Satan get out of here the sick is going to be healed the blind is going to be seen you may be seated we are telling the devil this is not another message church he could sit on the people and let them just steer thinking they have a book and they a brandham and they're going to the Rapture that's a lie it's not working that way the Rapture is a revelation oh give the Lord some praises hallelujah it's not working that way there's a pathway to this [Applause] thing May SE look at Elijah and elishah Elijah was

have we have a lot of that I mean manifestation sons of God when God manifest himself and he sends them out sent by God some just went but that man is sent Hallelujah by God Jesus Christ of Nazareth a man approved not by the M Association man approved of God Amen isn't that right all right we getting home stret here now like Israel back in the promised land she don't know how she got back there she was automatically placed back there why National Force put her in a place I'm going to say something National Force put Israel in a Homeland National Force will put the church in the workong the churches but the power of God will put the people of in the bride so any Pastor any preacher tell tell people that because they in the church they in the bride that's a lie that's not true because they in the message in the bride that's not true it takes the power in other words the message and what we believe is supposed to take us to power Faith supposed to take us to power Faith take us to the promise the promise take us to the power the power take us to what we have to fulfill Hallelujah so I don't want you to see yourself just in the message no you have to become the message the message living in you you have to become that Liv voice the Thunder that shakes the devil do you believe that okay praise the name of the Lord praise God praise God hallelujah brother brandham says he said I know pray for me that God will never let me go wrong it's not in my heart to go wrong I want to go right I want to do right because I realized as brother jackma told me one time brother brandham I wouldn't stand in your boots in all your experience a day of judgment because God is going to require of you a great answer because we give millions of people in your hand now if I know I'm going to stand there and answer for these people then what kind of gospel have I got to preach what kind of sincerity when I hold the purchase of his blood in my hand and as he give me a gift beyond a shadow of a doubt any sensible thinking person would know it has to come from God and with that if I lead people off on the wrong part just because a certain group said that God will require me to pay for it at the day of judgment praise the name of the Lord so he can't do that isn't that right oh hallelujah praise the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah praise God so I'm almost I'm I'm going to finish off here the new birth is Christ amen is a revelation God has revealed to you this great mystery and that's the new birth Hallelujah and what are you going to do when you get all that group together where the Revelation is perfectly in Harmony and God expressed in it through his word by the same actions the same things he did making the word manifest if the church only knew its position it will one day then the Raptor will come Hallelujah if the church knew its position you have got to get into your position then the Rapture will come oh hallelujah praise God Amen blessed be the name of the Lord Glory Hallelujah glory to God Amen million scream from the vision we are resting on that you said I preached every word that Paul preached million scream I'm resting on that now watch watch and that's the way I wanted to be when I crossed there I wanted to be that way just like that what Paul said don't want to add one thing to it don't want to take away from it just what the Bible said that's just the way I want to keep it going you see you people like that denomination on every side is going to raise up a barrier against it many times the Brethren think I'm against my brothers God knows different from that just as long as he knows what's truth I am not against Brethren listen carefully it's the system that is making us not to be brothers it isn't the word of God keeping us from being Brothers It's the system We join into that keeps us from being brothers that's right and that is where we stand oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah praise God so gyrus had a need and he had a need because his only child was dying and he said I'll wait now and I'll see him and so on now they say the church this pressure I'll tell you what did the prophet okay no the daughter was dying right then he had to go then it was time for action it's time for Action Brethren it's not time to argue about whether we should be baptized face forward or backward or whether we should belong to this church or that church it's time for the Holy Spirit to come into the church and get in action it's later than you think the hour is here it's not time to F about Creeds and doctrines and things like that it's time to get God's spirit and move on because the atomic bombs are hanging the missiles are everywhere the spotniks is in the sky and everything that Jesus said would take place the end time is now taking place the Holy Ghost is here yes the critics are rising amen so they ought to be no argument there ought to be a hungering a thirsting a crying a sign for God to break upon his people oh praise the name of the lordu hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the Lord hallelujah praise God praise God hallelujah glory to God thank you Jesus praise God okay let's close hallelujah praise God let me show you another reason why s hits This Book of Revelation he know that Jesus Christ is a chams yesterday today forever and he changes not he knows a whole lot more than 90% of the theologians he knows that since God is immutable in his nature he's also immutable in his ways does Satan know assuredly that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God In Action Mark 16 in action is the true church amen that Jesus claimed to be his own all else is false Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts amen but the book of Revelation shows that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it what making it lukewarm formal and Powerless think about it now half-hearted praise half-hearted worship lukewarm formal powerless yet people going to church that is Satan Hallelujah are 15% say Amen but it's still Satan God say I rather you're hot or you're cold Luke 1 he spew out of his mouth so God can handle lukewarm you see lukewarm is in between if you're cold we know you're dead if you're hot you're on fire but lukewarm God can handle it so God want a people on fire for God you know why you're on fire god open your eyes God open your understanding praise God you know what is going to take place you know the bmbs is about to fall you want to have a bum shelter which is to be in Christ Jesus don't 10,000 fall on my right side I shall not be moved because you're in the shelter in the secret place of the most high hallu he shall hide me in the Pavilion of his Tabernacle he shall hide me in the Cliff of the rock oh Hallelujah you want to be in that secret place oh glory to God listen to this listen to this he's making it lukewarm formal and Powerless it exposes Satan revealing his Works attempted destruction of God's people and discing of God's word right down to the time is cast in Lake of far he know know here we go if the people get the true revelation of the true church what she is what she stands for that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits working in the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit that Antichrist spirit is so close it will receive the very elect if possible that's why you have to be on the word because it's a razor ed between right and wrong it's got to be the word not your dream the word not this idea the word not this come to me it's got to be in the word something come to you bring it back to the word if it come to the word you can hold it if it's not the word kick it out is the devil send this I don't look how nice it is hallelujah oh glory to God Amen Hallelujah praise God thank you Jesus hallelujah thank you Lord GL Hallelujah that son took his money and went far but then after losing all his money friends because when the money ran out all the chicken and chips he could buy all the food he could buy he don't have no money anymore he afraid to tell them that money run out so instead of taking the full course menu as he accustom he said let's turn up and get some doubles feeling gu some doubles this evening and afterwards it come down to next to nothing then he end up eat and pick food but the beauty of this whole story he came to himself and that is when you get so cut up so pressed up so stressed out so pressured that you could take time to look at yourself in the mirror and come to yourself and say you know what this is not my place this position I'm in right now that's not what God ordained for me amen there's a better place yes sir I'll go back to my father's house I prefer to be a servant of my father's house and said oh my I would arise I go to
