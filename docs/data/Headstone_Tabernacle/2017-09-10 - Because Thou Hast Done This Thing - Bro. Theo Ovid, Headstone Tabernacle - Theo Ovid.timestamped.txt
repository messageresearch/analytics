[30:46] [Applause]
[30:56] solely solely the presence of God is in
[30:59] this place when greetin's a man from
[31:03] Africa from Uganda and what a tremendous
[31:06] time we had meetings day in Uganda
[31:09] some of you may know some a minute no
[31:11] but but John Shakuni pastor who's pushed
[31:14] pastor he lost his wife with about a
[31:16] month and a half ago and he was
[31:19] testifying and saying that many people
[31:21] thought he would have canceled meetings
[31:22] but man he had real feet and God blessed
[31:26] him and God bless the meeting is in a
[31:29] powerful powerful way and sometime you
[31:34] you you have no idea what some of these
[31:36] believers and people who are true saving
[31:39] the Lord in their countries and so on
[31:40] and and because of the opportunity to
[31:43] travel that we see it in or now we see
[31:45] how God bless feet and sacrifice God
[31:48] just can't bless laziness and sloppiness
[31:50] and you know the best he bless feast and
[31:52] sacrifice and over 1500 believers and
[31:58] over 100 passes was there we have
[32:01] ministers from both Uganda and Kenya
[32:02] other parts of Africa that came to this
[32:05] meeting it was glorious mighty old point
[32:07] of the spirit there's one time where a
[32:10] John Condy was preaching and then that
[32:12] was preaching actually was talking a
[32:13] little bit before service all of a
[32:14] sudden I just got silent just silent I'm
[32:16] never see anything like that he had all
[32:18] said he never saw anything like that
[32:19] silent like you can hear a pin fold he
[32:21] said but it is silent and all of a
[32:24] sudden the holy speaking in the poro
[32:25] it's not it's not the work of man his
[32:27] God's work of a study and that's before
[32:30] scripture before it was ready so it's
[32:33] really powerful to see how the unity and
[32:36] the seedings coming together come into
[32:37] place
[32:39] and you have to have a heart for this it
[32:41] has to be in your heart
[32:43] whatever succumb to true to you it has
[32:46] to be in your heart you can't be hoping
[32:48] you have to have our divine revelation
[32:50] and I trust this morning that this word
[32:52] that we're gonna be speaking to you
[32:54] would touch your heart and speak to her
[32:56] you're appreciated by the Stephen last
[32:58] Sunday compressible diva but a Stephen
[33:03] get deliver I appreciate not service
[33:06] Amen praise the Lord him and his words
[33:08] but eyes that come behind him about hope
[33:10] they die about denying yourself that's
[33:13] what people find it so hard to do they
[33:16] want God to meet them at their level
[33:18] they don't want a competent was level
[33:20] you want to be as it are live as they
[33:23] are natural and everything must work out
[33:25] just as you wanted just as you desired
[33:27] I remember course wouldn't find no fight
[33:29] no problem no challenges and and that
[33:32] must be your life and what's a big fat
[33:33] no he said every Sun that cometh to God
[33:36] must be tested must be tried he said
[33:41] that you have no spoiled children we
[33:44] spoiled our my god don't have any
[33:45] spoiled children demon so this morning
[33:47] we want to stand and we want to change
[33:49] your of service and going to the word I
[33:51] want to turn our Bibles to Hebrews
[33:53] chapter 11
[33:54] wanna read from verse 1 to 6 Genesis
[33:57] chapter 22 verse 15 the 18 Matthew
[34:02] chapter 7 verse 24 to 29 when I greet
[34:05] all those who connected to us any
[34:07] Internet would far and wide or bless you
[34:10] we're happy to hear be here to serve
[34:14] amen
[34:15] reading Genesis Hebrews chapter 11
[34:20] now faith is the substance of things
[34:22] hoped for the evidence of things not
[34:24] seen for by the elders obtained a good
[34:27] report to faith we understand that the
[34:30] worlds were framed by the Word of God so
[34:32] that things which are seen were not made
[34:34] of things which will appear by faith
[34:37] Abel offered unto God a more excellent
[34:39] sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained
[34:41] witness that he was righteous God
[34:43] testifying of his gifts and by a TBM
[34:46] dead yet speak at my feet
[34:48] Enoch was translated that he should not
[34:50] see death I was not found because God
[34:52] had translated him for before his
[34:56] translation he had this testimony that
[34:58] he pleased God but without faith it is
[35:00] impossible to please him for he that
[35:03] cometh to God must believe that he is
[35:05] that he is a rewarder of them that
[35:07] diligently seek Him Genesis chapter 22
[35:10] verse 15 to 18
[35:21] and the angel of the Lord called unto
[35:22] Abram out of him in the second time and
[35:25] said by myself have I sworn saith the
[35:30] Lord for because thou has done this
[35:33] thing and hast not withheld thy son and
[35:37] only son but in blessing I will bless
[35:39] thee and a multiplying I will multiply
[35:41] thy seed as the stars of the heaven as a
[35:44] Sun which is upon the sea shore and thy
[35:47] seed shall possess the gates of his
[35:49] enemies and I seed shall all the nations
[35:51] of the earth be blessed because thou was
[35:54] obeyed my voice last scripture Matthew
[35:57] chapter 7 reading from verse 24
[36:09] therefore whosoever here at these scenes
[36:13] of mine undo it now I would liken him
[36:18] unto a wise man who built his house upon
[36:21] a rock and the rain descended and the
[36:25] floods came and the winds blew and beat
[36:28] upon that house and it fell not for it
[36:31] was founded upon a rock and every one
[36:34] that heareth these sayings of mine and
[36:35] doeth them not shall be like likened
[36:40] unto a foolish man which built his house
[36:42] upon the sand and the rain descended the
[36:45] floods came the winds blew and beat upon
[36:48] the house and it fell and great was the
[36:52] fall of it and I came to pass when Jesus
[36:54] had ended these scenes the people were
[36:57] astonished at his doctrine for he taught
[37:00] them as one of an authority another
[37:04] describes this ba has what's once more
[37:06] father we thank you for your word and
[37:08] any man could reach scriptures but it
[37:10] will take the Holy Spirit to breathe in
[37:12] it and reveal it father we pray your
[37:15] commandant reveal an anointing and
[37:17] spirit and reveal a word to your people
[37:18] that deliver with a rock and their soul
[37:20] a rock in their heart a rock of
[37:22] Revelation father come and confirm it
[37:24] with signs wonders and miracles we ask
[37:27] in Jesus name or pour your spirit upon
[37:29] your people this morning amen and amen
[37:31] you may be seated
[37:40] this morning 1/2 of a title because da
[37:45] was done this thing as a title because
[37:50] da has done this thing another an
[37:56] inspiration the angel is here to drive
[38:00] you back to the Tree of Life the engine
[38:04] is here to drive you back to the Tree of
[38:06] Life other context scripture I like to
[38:09] read now which is from Revelation
[38:11] chapter 4 and a trees after this I
[38:14] looked and behold a door was open in
[38:16] heaven and the first voice which I heard
[38:18] was as well trumpet talking with me
[38:20] which said come up hither I will show
[38:22] thee things which must be Hereafter
[38:24] and immediately I was in the spirit
[38:26] behold a throne was set in heaven and
[38:28] one sat on the troll and he that sat was
[38:31] to look upon like Jasper and sardine
[38:33] stone and there was a rainbow rule about
[38:35] a troll in the cyclic on an emerald and
[38:37] wrong about it phone were fallen 20
[38:40] seats and upon the seats I saw four and
[38:42] twenty elders sitting clothed in white
[38:44] raiment and they had on their heads
[38:46] crowns of gold out of the throne
[38:47] proceeded lightnings thunders
[38:49] thunderings and voices and there were
[38:52] seven lamps of fire burning before the
[38:54] throne which are the seven spirits of
[38:57] God and before the throne there was a
[38:59] sea of glass like unto a Christian and a
[39:01] miss of the trone round about the throne
[39:04] were four beasts full of eyes before and
[39:07] behind first beast was like a lion
[39:10] second beast like a calf
[39:12] the two-piece had a face as a man the
[39:15] fourth beast was like a flying eagle and
[39:17] the four piece had each of them six
[39:19] wings about him they were full of eyes
[39:22] within and the rest not day and night
[39:24] saying holy holy Lord God Almighty which
[39:27] was which is and is to come and we find
[39:31] out that this book of Revelation we know
[39:33] is a book of symbols all the beasts and
[39:37] all the things that you're hearing is
[39:39] represent something it means something
[39:41] is not just idly placed here
[39:44] there's a purpose
[39:45] in every scripture every word that God
[39:47] speaks in that Bible okay here we go
[39:50] but a piranha from this is from
[39:53] Melchizedek Great Prince and King there
[39:55] are three elements that a man follows
[39:59] first is humanistic second is divine
[40:04] revelation and third is vision that is
[40:09] thus saith the Lord
[40:11] so the majority of humans walk in the
[40:14] earth follow the humanistic realm that's
[40:17] the realm of your five senses as a realm
[40:20] of your emotions and your feelings and
[40:22] this one hurts you and your trouble and
[40:24] everything else that just humanistic
[40:27] above that level is the realm of divine
[40:31] revelation so from a humanistic
[40:34] standpoint Sarah couldn't have a child
[40:36] from a natural standpoint Iran is too
[40:39] old but from a revelation standpoint
[40:41] Isaac is coming if he lives at the
[40:48] humanistic around he will doubt God he
[40:51] can't come to the spot to believe he
[40:53] will have that child but the Bible said
[40:56] abraham believed God to do that he had
[40:59] to jump over his humanistic
[41:01] [Applause]
[41:05] to believe in the divine revelation of
[41:07] what God said to him that he a mrs.
[41:11] shrine types could say God said so
[41:13] whatever piece you have God said so
[41:15] sorry I can't show you this but God said
[41:19] so unconcerned a man that would lie if
[41:23] God said it it's gonna come to pass then
[41:26] God said it it would materialize and God
[41:28] said he don't need no help to bring it
[41:32] to pass
[41:34] which realm are you following this
[41:37] morning hallelujah is only tree now your
[41:45] mother say or your father say or your
[41:47] uncle say your brother say or your
[41:48] grandmother say that's them saying what
[41:50] did God say well my feelings tell me and
[41:54] I feel so and I dream this last night I
[41:56] have nothing to do with that I want to
[41:58] know what God said I don't want to hear
[42:00] about your dream I don't want to hear
[42:02] what your feelings I don't want to hear
[42:03] what human spirit I don't worry about
[42:05] your emotions I want to hear what God
[42:07] said red sea in front
[42:17] mountains on both side zero coming
[42:21] behind I'm the people demanding what is
[42:24] going on Moses and mostly began to
[42:27] whimper and cry I'm going said why cry
[42:31] on to me speak and move our Moses back
[42:36] slipped and fell from faith into the
[42:39] human realm that walks it speaks it
[42:56] Leslie the Josh I lived I think look at
[43:00] the Lord a shout in the hood
[43:02] [Music]
[43:04] [Applause]
[43:06] uija somebody shouted
[43:13] now the human Instagram can't help you
[43:17] much Victor to live here I think this is
[43:21] a nice nice it is a feeling it's a
[43:24] feeling emotions affection and so on
[43:26] that's nice but to take beyond that they
[43:30] take a higher order you take a higher
[43:32] poll and that's the pull of divine
[43:35] revelation you see it again the third
[43:37] element is vision or IMAP Rinnegan the
[43:40] three elements that we put well in the
[43:42] first one is humanistic you like this
[43:45] ties the fashion in the world and think
[43:46] that I'm taking this one have that and
[43:48] it's all great and I'm a friend doing
[43:49] this and I want to do that too this one
[43:54] pulling you down one pulley I'll be a
[43:56] humanistic right and then the next one
[44:00] is revelation
[44:01] that's listen that's when something down
[44:04] in your heart anchors it and says it's
[44:06] going to happen then something good
[44:09] happen I remember and doing the
[44:10] government exams pastor get employment
[44:14] and you know they give you up the
[44:19] symptom to do the exams and so on and I
[44:21] know this girl know she study and study
[44:23] instead of my acting I did a few
[44:25] sun-filled but I didn't do it each time
[44:28] that she did it and something tell me
[44:30] I'm gonna pass this time and what I
[44:32] study is what come what she study did
[44:34] not come but I had faith in my heart
[44:36] that I was going to succeed and and I
[44:38] did that was something else
[44:41] it was almost like a phrase like a
[44:42] revelation that I'm gonna get true so
[44:45] I'm not coward at what I study I had to
[44:47] believe that what I am studying right
[44:48] now this coming in the people so it's
[44:51] not that I was I'm not gonna study and
[44:52] with the study a little thing before the
[44:54] exam and what that little thing that
[44:56] come don't do bond you know my study
[44:58] with
[44:59] go take a test and that totally matches
[45:06] vision which is the word of the Lord
[45:09] mid manifests when you see it and it's
[45:12] thus saith the Lord
[45:14] that's like what a bird but a primary
[45:15] matter when he was India thinking was
[45:17] India and some blind man or something
[45:22] like that only brought him forth and
[45:23] honey Lord showed nothing to be healed
[45:24] and he said if this man how much will
[45:26] give this life to Jesus Christ if this
[45:29] is what openness I said the blind man
[45:30] worship in his son and go opening Isaac
[45:32] Langman that was the said the Lord get a
[45:34] vision it couldn't feel and so on so
[45:36] that's the three elements it's not right
[45:37] the tail is vision that is the seer the
[45:40] Lord that is perfect that is positive
[45:43] and a frequent of vision isn't that
[45:46] right now back in Genesis everything
[45:50] started in the beginning there were two
[45:52] boys keen and evil not ten - two boys
[45:58] and God invite them to worship she may
[46:05] get is quickly
[46:09] the other fine I'll read it and in the
[46:11] process of time this is Genesis chapter
[46:14] 4 it came to pass that Cain brought
[46:16] forth the fruit of the ground as an
[46:20] offering unto the Lord and Abel also
[46:23] brought for the first of his flock and
[46:24] of the fat thereof and the Lord had
[46:26] respect unto Abel and his offering under
[46:28] the Cain and his offering he had not
[46:30] respect and kin was very wrong his
[46:33] countenance fell and the Lord said unto
[46:35] Cain why I thought why I had thy
[46:37] countenance for if thou doest well shalt
[46:40] thou be accepted and if thou doest not
[46:43] well sin line at the door and under deed
[46:45] shall be his desire thou shall rule over
[46:47] him and yeah we know the story can come
[46:50] and kill evil but God actually
[46:51] challenged him to come to the altar to
[46:54] make the offering one bring fruits of
[46:56] his interpretation on the other wonders
[46:58] take a lamb and kill it and that blood
[47:00] come out and God says send fire upon
[47:03] that offering and vindicated Abel's
[47:05] offering and that's why I read the
[47:06] script by faith Abel offered a sacrifice
[47:08] which God confirmed that he was
[47:10] righteous because he break into a realm
[47:13] where it wasn't his ability or worked or
[47:15] laboring in the field and planting and
[47:17] reaping it was a lamb he took a blood
[47:19] something that struck him isn't that
[47:21] right it was revealed him so but a
[47:24] Branham says those boys after seeing
[47:27] that been made mortal and was going to
[47:29] die here we go
[47:30] they tried to find favor with God the
[47:34] poor come making a sacrifice and if God
[47:37] only required religion then Cain was
[47:40] justified Kilmer's just as believing as
[47:42] evil believe king came with a sacrifice
[47:44] just as he became a sacrifice but Cain's
[47:46] sacrifice was by works he raised his
[47:49] garden he brought his fruit the best he
[47:51] could find but Abel was justified by
[47:54] faith because he come with a loud Oh
[47:56] could we give God praises for that
[47:59] hallelujah praise the name of the Lord
[48:03] watch now when Kane came and knelt down
[48:05] and built an altar our imagined they
[48:08] come to the east side of the gate
[48:09] and there is where the angel stood with
[48:11] his flaming sword remember what happened
[48:13] when they got run over God neither the
[48:15] angels were stayed with flaming sword to
[48:17] God
[48:18] The Tree of Life that man in that
[48:20] tradition wouldn't my take of the Tree
[48:22] of Life and I've eaten alive in that
[48:24] terrible condition so the angel was sent
[48:26] to guard it the block man from beating
[48:29] about it isn't that right
[48:31] so watch the angel stood with his
[48:34] flaming sword garden the Tree of Life by
[48:36] the way he was guarding the people away
[48:40] from the tree of life but now he is
[48:44] trying to drive the people back to the
[48:48] Tree of Life I do know the sea of life
[48:51] is right that's Jesus Christ
[48:53] isn't that right now Jesus was our tree
[48:56] of life the woman was the tree of debt
[49:00] we are the fruit of our mother she was
[49:03] the fruit tree my woman come dead and my
[49:06] woman come life which is true marry
[49:09] virgin born is not right but I please
[49:11] not to die but the man born of the
[49:13] Spirit of God never dies
[49:15] going to church making a sacrifice
[49:17] worshiping God if that's all that God
[49:21] requires he will be cruel to condemn a
[49:24] man that met that requirement but you
[49:26] see there's a way that seems right unto
[49:28] a man but the end thereof is that
[49:30] there's a way that God comes and that's
[49:33] the only way you are ever going to get
[49:36] there are you listening to me
[49:39] praise God that's the only way you're
[49:42] gonna get there no there is a way that
[49:44] go-go-go
[49:45] and will you and there's a way Lacroix
[49:47] provide for you and the whole Bible is
[49:49] built upon Revelation the entire Bible
[49:53] so when you come to church you already
[49:55] come to get in the spirit
[49:56] I'm not just getting information if it's
[49:59] human read information but when you come
[50:01] to church you get an opportunity for the
[50:03] Spirit to come upon you
[50:06] this information and transform it into
[50:08] revelation then it's not information to
[50:12] you it's reveal to you then you can
[50:14] worship then they could shout then you
[50:18] could bring your offering to the altar
[50:19] then fire to fall upon you listen is
[50:23] already the substance of what you're
[50:25] hoping for it's not yet but you believe
[50:28] it will be that's revelation it's not
[50:31] yet but you believe it will be you
[50:33] believe God bless you it's not yet what
[50:36] you believe it will be didn't come and
[50:38] hear you it's not yet but you believe it
[50:41] baby
[50:42] [Applause]

[50:54] natural men we call following a man's

[1:16:45] foundation you have whether your house
[1:16:48] will wear it or not many lives have been
[1:16:53] saved because of preparation for storms
[1:16:56] the many of life's lost because of
[1:16:58] failing to take heed to the warning of
[1:17:01] storms that's coming along ago a story
[1:17:05] had my believers in Florida they had
[1:17:07] great storm sweep to Florida typhoons
[1:17:09] off the sea big blocks into the city
[1:17:12] she's out everything I could stop down
[1:17:13] preach for our surges today all we know
[1:17:15] is that we have got an uncommon storm
[1:17:16] and the only woman I know can turn that
[1:17:19] storm have to be a Russian women that
[1:17:22] fell in their Pentacles
[1:17:24] he's a stockman acacho beach news in
[1:17:26] florida and there was a neighbor man who
[1:17:28] kept in contact with radio because of
[1:17:31] these storms he was a very non-christian
[1:17:33] he heard great typhoon was coming that
[1:17:35] way twisted on trees and everyone was
[1:17:38] warned to get to safety he thought of
[1:17:40] his neighbor who had a chicken farm has
[1:17:42] some like buildings with your chickens
[1:17:44] in there through the houses so for hens
[1:17:47] and they had in and his life was tied up
[1:17:50] with them chickens for a living he was
[1:17:52] quickly frantically up to the gate and
[1:17:54] stopped his car jump or said to the
[1:17:56] fellow take all the chickens put them in
[1:17:59] your storm shelter
[1:18:00] you rushed over to mine because there's
[1:18:02] coming a typhoon our storm they're gonna
[1:18:03] twist everything down like what he
[1:18:06] shared with his neighbor the man stood
[1:18:08] looking at her face and laugh at him
[1:18:10] he's in nonsense I have heard them
[1:18:12] predict such a thing before and they
[1:18:14] never have and the Christian neighbor
[1:18:16] was so excited he said but what if it
[1:18:17] does happen we here we must like along
[1:18:21] the line I've heard of this great happen
[1:18:23] and I was gonna happen
[1:18:24] and as gonna happen in these days but it
[1:18:26] behooves us to listen to every warning
[1:18:29] but this man said I will time for those
[1:18:31] foolishness I raise chickens I have no
[1:18:33] time for some cried out the neighbor
[1:18:36] said in the name of God Lido's chicken
[1:18:38] alone John come quickly you and your
[1:18:40] family if you don't want to believe it
[1:18:41] let your family come he said I will not
[1:18:43] have my children to be excited over a
[1:18:45] few reader warnings Mike you and I have
[1:18:47] decided we will live as I live
[1:18:49] my wife will listen to me because I am
[1:18:51] the breadwinner of this whole
[1:18:55] and she must listen to me I am the boss
[1:18:57] here and I will not have my children all
[1:19:00] excited to talk about some nonsense and
[1:19:05] the neighbor Tim he went to his home
[1:19:08] into his shelter all of a sudden the
[1:19:10] cloud was upon him before he knew it
[1:19:12] that's the way judgement strikes it
[1:19:17] comes so sudden you wonder how we can
[1:19:20] get there so quickly how I have seen
[1:19:22] cruel men who once Chris God fallen
[1:19:25] scream and say how could you treat me
[1:19:26] this way the holes Foundation swept out
[1:19:29] from under him in a moment it pays to
[1:19:31] take warning you might laugh at the
[1:19:33] messenger you might be able even be able
[1:19:36] to kill him but you cannot kill the
[1:19:38] message it will go on just the same why
[1:19:47] the storm struck the country it caught
[1:19:48] the chicken house the farmer they never
[1:19:51] found his body his wife frantically
[1:19:55] frightened they left close to the great
[1:19:57] Okeechobee leak and the waters began to
[1:19:59] rise is a typhoon lifted waters all the
[1:20:01] way from the bottom of the lake and
[1:20:03] that's what makes it so dangerous the
[1:20:05] boats rock how the waves come up and
[1:20:07] turn the boats beneath them the storm
[1:20:09] come up swirl picks them up for miles
[1:20:11] the water is sweeping until the mother
[1:20:13] lode it was no hope better get a chair
[1:20:15] into the top of the building she got to
[1:20:18] the top of the building with the
[1:20:18] children
[1:20:19] poor longer the chimney of the house and
[1:20:22] the wildlife the cottonmouth moccasin I
[1:20:24] believe I'm what deadly snake than your
[1:20:25] Diamondback rattler they were calling
[1:20:28] for safety and they caught up on the
[1:20:31] roof also with her and by listening to
[1:20:34] her husband listen carefully by
[1:20:37] listening to a husband not taking heed
[1:20:41] to the warning so this is not a family
[1:20:43] warning
[1:20:45] this is an individual warning that's not
[1:20:50] a wee thing
[1:20:51] removing show missus to the individual
[1:20:57] [Music]
[1:21:00] hallelujah and by listening to her
[1:21:02] husband not take heed to the warning she
[1:21:05] stumped she beat she had to stand on
[1:21:07] what was officious snakebites her
[1:21:09] children until they died on the roof and
[1:21:12] the mother herself was bitten so much
[1:21:14] until she died and that's the only way
[1:21:16] we got the story after the storm
[1:21:18] acquired and search parties hundred four
[1:21:20] buddies the fungal lien on the top of
[1:21:21] the roof with a cheering limb by a sigh
[1:21:23] it peers to take warning the first thing
[1:21:28] to do before they can be a warning they
[1:21:30] had to be a preparation made for safety
[1:21:32] so what did tell em in Florida there is
[1:21:35] a safety please leave your house and get
[1:21:38] the deal it's a food there enough that
[1:21:40] day you know whatever it is the
[1:21:42] structure could withstand the storm go
[1:21:43] dear
[1:21:44] so before port could give a warning they
[1:21:46] have to be a safe place isn't that right
[1:21:53] and the warning is only a voice of one
[1:21:57] Avenue to prepare for the danger there
[1:22:00] has to be a preparation made first and
[1:22:02] if the preparation is made then the
[1:22:05] warning can go forward to cause you to
[1:22:08] make a decision because that was done
[1:22:12] this thing
[1:22:16] the warning challenge review to make a
[1:22:19] decision
[1:22:19] life is about decisions about actions
[1:22:23] about what people do
[1:22:25] isn't that right Court has the same
[1:22:28] method whether you listen to it or not
[1:22:31] if you don't want to listen to it up
[1:22:32] that's up to you if you risk it there is
[1:22:35] safety Jesus see if you don't listen and
[1:22:37] do what he says you're fool the foolish
[1:22:40] man if you listen to do what he said
[1:22:42] you're wise person that's the problem
[1:22:44] today about young people don't want to
[1:22:45] listen you want to do the only thing you
[1:22:47] got a field a fruit on the side of
[1:22:49] energy in their side of time on the side
[1:22:50] you don't have that you have that boat
[1:22:53] on your side so God has the same method
[1:22:57] we work on God's method in that way
[1:22:59] Gordon the early days when the people
[1:23:02] got so wicked God could not look upon it
[1:23:04] he has laws when those laws are broken
[1:23:07] has no penalty there is no law the
[1:23:10] reason that there is a law in hostile
[1:23:12] penalty phase to be a law if there is no
[1:23:15] penalty there is no law just do it on
[1:23:17] your Brickley right like there's no
[1:23:19] charge it's not ticket to go over speed
[1:23:20] there's no ticket there's no no law then
[1:23:22] everybody do the own thing but the
[1:23:24] reason is how a penalty it has a law
[1:23:26] however the law was a penalty there
[1:23:29] surprise isn't alright watch so any Lord
[1:23:32] has broken hospitality is in the law you
[1:23:34] cannot break the laws of go around
[1:23:35] without having to pay for it somewhere
[1:23:38] you must do it
[1:23:40] be sure your sins don't find you out the
[1:23:43] only to watch so therefore many people
[1:23:45] think smoking cigar is a sin it isn't
[1:23:47] many birthing that lying is a sin isn't
[1:23:49] committed adultery isn't a sin these are
[1:23:51] attributes of unbelief there are only
[1:23:53] two things either you believe or your
[1:23:56] unbeliever if you believe you don't do
[1:23:59] this thing so when you are born you are
[1:24:03] born from above and you have the Holy
[1:24:05] Spirit coming down from God listen that
[1:24:08] changes your nature no matter your
[1:24:11] sister your mother your best friend
[1:24:12] could be dressed that way but the
[1:24:14] Christian has born of the Spirit God is
[1:24:16] born from above their spirit is of
[1:24:18] another Kingdom
[1:24:19] you are ruled or governed from above
[1:24:23] your influences even your hairstyle is
[1:24:26] from above it interest is not what
[1:24:28] Hollywood have your clothing is that
[1:24:30] interests my Hollywood its influence
[1:24:32] from above isn't that right
[1:24:39] I'm so glad the simpleness of the Holy
[1:24:42] Spirit to follow it watch it how it
[1:24:46] behaves and makes you believe now here
[1:24:49] we go the Holy Spirit will not misbehave
[1:24:54] itself in one person and behave itself
[1:24:57] another so that's why it's so
[1:25:02] flimsy when people say I don't believe
[1:25:04] it like how you see it I see it so I see
[1:25:07] it so when you look at the life and a
[1:25:09] behavior no behavior so their their
[1:25:13] behavior come to our doctrine or
[1:25:14] teaching but that's not right that's
[1:25:17] like what a Branham said I prefer
[1:25:19] somebody right in spirit and long and
[1:25:22] doctrine that to be wrong and spirit and

[1:41:46] Holy Ghost begins to work that is what
[1:41:48] we waiting on
[1:41:49] that's what beyond expectation for for
[1:41:52] the Spirit of God to begin to flow
[1:41:54] freely because qua gonna find a bunch
[1:41:56] gonna find a people we're gonna find
[1:41:59] people somewhere on this earth that he
[1:42:01] could work through the Spirit of God
[1:42:02] yeah is my spirit flowing freely from
[1:42:12] the teachings to the manifestation of
[1:42:15] God because when Jesus began his
[1:42:19] ministry there was there was challenging
[1:42:21] they wondered about his authority his
[1:42:24] doctrine was so different he was
[1:42:26] teaching with the authority of God
[1:42:29] so but around says and after watch so
[1:42:32] Abraham I promise that too is see the
[1:42:33] whole will be blessed and we find out
[1:42:35] when he was 35 years old and series
[1:42:37] white was 65 years old and Abram stuck
[1:42:39] under the promise of god rom believe it
[1:42:40] was strong given preach to God and God
[1:42:43] time after time tested him and he come
[1:42:47] to that here we go
[1:42:48] I already always thought I bring a
[1:42:50] notebook and a pen I wanted with the
[1:42:53] write down stuff
[1:42:54] time after time was testing him are you
[1:42:57] ready I'm the comma time final test
[1:43:00] before the blessing was going to happen
[1:43:04] aha you'll be there's a final test you
[1:43:06] can feel of what you
[1:43:10] that is final test before you get your
[1:43:14] blessing and that's the way it is with
[1:43:20] all the seed of Abraham God gives us
[1:43:24] that final test just before he gives the
[1:43:29] promise are you ready for some more and
[1:43:32] if it's possible I like this is omnia
[1:43:35] personally I will hold that that final
[1:43:38] test is to see how you will react upon
[1:43:41] it
[1:43:42] notice when God calls people out from
[1:43:45] Egypt he call him what to give him a
[1:43:47] good line right now we find out he bless
[1:43:49] them in the wilderness the journey and
[1:43:50] everything else when you squeamish mania
[1:43:52] which was the the final Junction to

[1:49:14] [Applause]
[1:49:26] or we don't
[1:49:29] let me see that praise God for that lost
[1:49:34] coin the Prophet said woman lost her
[1:49:38] coin she didn't ring in that time that a
[1:49:40] ban little wedding ring and in the
[1:49:42] banner coins and they fall in adultery
[1:49:45] they will call on take her to the temple
[1:49:47] and take out the coins of virtue and so
[1:49:50] on like that this woman lost the coin
[1:49:52] she didn't commit adultery she lost the
[1:49:54] coin she had to find it before her
[1:49:56] husband come because it miss him she be
[1:49:59] taken adulteress so she began a search
[1:50:01] to get the fine she won the blood of a
[1:50:04] niche the word of the age the force of
[1:50:07] the age because the voice of ears is
[1:50:08] roughly kindness forgiveness yes why I
[1:50:11] say this peace and forgiveness you don't
[1:50:13] probably Chinese I get dr. fate without
[1:50:15] fits attack of the Holy Ghost your knees
[1:50:17] hands they need forgiveness you need to
[1:50:20] chop your hearts you'll need a blood of
[1:50:21] the edge check out your to find it give
[1:50:25] the Lord a shout
[1:50:26] [Applause]
[1:50:28] [Music]
[1:50:29] [Applause]
[1:50:32] so the Prophet prophesied she had cheek
[1:50:37] watch she swept the walls she turned on
[1:50:40] the cobwebs she kept on and then she
[1:50:42] found what she had lost when she did she
[1:50:45] call her little sister Chisholm
[1:50:47] come now I believe you're Methodist
[1:50:49] Baptist Pentecostal but I don't care
[1:50:51] what message does it belong to
[1:50:53] what could we belong to I don't care
[1:50:54] because I found it when you find it you
[1:51:00] don't care you haven't you forgiven
[1:51:04] [Applause]
[1:51:07] just picky with on
[1:51:10] [Applause]
[1:51:12] just sticking with forgiveness if people

[1:51:17] [Applause]
[1:51:18] just sticking with love
[1:51:20] [Applause]
[1:51:23] so the Prophet prophesied let us rejoice
[1:51:26] together then he prophesied when that
[1:51:29] time comes when the church finds it's
[1:51:32] probably love when the church famous for
[1:51:35] decency when the church finds its place
[1:51:37] in Christ it will call the other members
[1:51:39] of the body camera Joyce with us God
[1:51:42] want the church to love him Oh blurring
[1:51:45] of God God wants the church to love him
[1:51:50] what's the objective citizen Tungus
[1:51:54] clash husband a wife and everything else
[1:51:55] what's the objective of oats grudges and
[1:51:58] all these different things to cut you

[2:23:00] [Applause]
[2:23:07] so all those international churches have
[2:23:10] gone as children they belong to this
[2:23:12] mystic kingdom what are they waiting for
[2:23:16] they are waiting to see something take
[2:23:19] place that will draw their hats into it
[2:23:23] so that Baptists Lunia shall over them
[2:23:25] it's not the real thing Methodists this
[2:23:28] group interpretation una shall they look
[2:23:31] at normal and they believe and they here
[2:23:33] and this group and in that Trish and
[2:23:34] whatnot but there are seeds of God
[2:23:36] waiting for something to join their
[2:23:38] hearts right there the only ending in
[2:23:41] the head and have the choice and it
[2:23:43] thinks so on the fields so humanistic
[2:23:45] but one of these days when that Holy
[2:23:48] Spirit began to move my god understand
[2:23:51] this that come like a magnet magnet
[2:23:54] don't pick up cloth and people if makeup
[2:23:57] pick up think that I'm magnet I see it
[2:23:59] it makes up metal and everything else so
[2:24:01] when the magnet of the Holy Ghost begins
[2:24:03] to move over the world it will pick up
[2:24:06] those that have the magnetism of the
[2:24:07] Spirit you pick them up pick them up one
[2:24:10] here one here there between a bit one
[2:24:13] taken in them focused a lot some shouts
[2:24:16] there between the feet one taken that
[2:24:19] one have the magnetism inside of them
[2:24:21] you comment to get magnetized what we
[2:24:24] call you come here and sometime when
[2:24:26] there when the metal don't have no
[2:24:27] magnet you take a magnet and rub it and
[2:24:30] they keep rubbing it and it transfer and
[2:24:32] get the atoms going and when you take
[2:24:34] the word I begin to take that put in
[2:24:35] your heart
[2:24:36] yes not to rub it brings caught
[2:24:38] something chance for both plural accord
[2:24:40] the secret is the word is in the Frank
[2:24:43] so the magnetism inside are you put the
[2:24:47] devil didn't put this eyelid here he
[2:24:48] cannot take it out
[2:24:50] [Applause]
[2:24:52] so you come to church to get the word
[2:24:55] inside of you the word coming inside of
[2:24:58] you and then the Holy Spirit could take
[2:25:01] that off
[2:25:02] do you see it now Florina good so in the
[2:25:06] last days they're gonna come a famine
[2:25:08] not for bailing water but for hearing
[2:25:10] the true Word of God and the words that
[2:25:12] come join come join but we enjoy them
[2:25:14] nothing Waclaw really good question this

[2:26:47] you know it and I know it blowing up God
[2:26:50] we get into something Oh hallelujah
[2:26:55] so not some organization but behold I
[2:26:58] send the promise of my father upon you
[2:26:59] but tyranny city of Jerusalem until you
[2:27:02] be endued with power from on high
[2:27:05] not poor for a bishop not poorer books
[2:27:08] and tapes power from on high
[2:27:09] when I talk upon you is his power coming
[2:27:12] upon your life what glorious God you are
[2:27:15] sons and daughters of God
[2:27:16] what have no hierarchy you have no Pope
[2:27:18] - Bishop and Bishop over the bishop and
[2:27:20] then you have that that's all a
[2:27:22] structure here they get brought into the
[2:27:25] church instead of this church Jesus
[2:27:30] Christ no bishop no Cooperman no poop no
[2:27:33] man-made powers but Jesus Christ is his
[2:27:36] kingdom was coming into power and you
[2:27:38] shall receive power after the Holy Ghost
[2:27:41] comes upon you you shall receive power
[2:27:43] after you're made of Bishop after you
[2:27:46] made a preacher after the Pope as we
[2:27:48] made a priest no after the Holy Ghost
[2:27:50] comes upon you pull in the head of the
[2:27:53] church Jesus Christ what kingdom is it
[2:27:56] the Messiah Kingdom the church is not an
[2:27:59] organization it's a mystical body the
[2:28:02] rich Christ is the head Christ is here
[2:28:05] this morning to connect with you
[2:28:07] you are members of his body you are
[2:28:09] members of this machine Oh glory to God
[2:28:12] what is the church is just a mystical
[2:28:15] body of Jesus Christ who set it up the
[2:28:17] Lord Jesus himself and you will never be
[2:28:21] able to understand the kingdom of God
[2:28:22] until you are born again it's an
[2:28:25] unraveled mystery but when you are when
[2:28:28] you are born again the plans of the
[2:28:30] kingdom and the Kingdom itself becomes
[2:28:33] real to you
[2:28:34] you have got to understand the blueprint
[2:28:38] or you won't know the blueprint
[2:28:40] until your Zbornak
[2:28:41] car just has somebody going until one
[2:28:44] bill is on business there's a blueprint
[2:28:45] you have to understand how to billets
[2:28:47] then I could wander the building isn't
[2:28:50] that right
[2:28:51] so therefore the four-piece praise God
[2:28:53] we said take care of the seven spirits
[2:28:55] lion poor Lavinia smarten ox Columba for
[2:28:59] th the man Newton Wesley and the eagle
[2:29:02] is William Branham isn't that butter
[2:29:04] Ramsay this creature or living creature
[2:29:06] was not beast this little creature is a
[2:29:08] word called zoom and beast wild beasts
[2:29:12] Asterion
[2:29:13] but as soon as living creatures Tyrion
[2:29:16] is the word piece as identified as room
[2:29:19] as United and United States they are
[2:29:21] beasts Tyrion but these four piece is
[2:29:24] not that these four pieces zoom they are
[2:29:27] living creatures
[2:29:29] isn't that right revelation 4 is living
[2:29:32] creatures not beasts okay and in Ezekiel
[2:29:35] Ezekiel saw it Ezekiel one and he read
[2:29:39] the scripture praise God hallelujah and
[2:29:42] watch living creatures they are not
[2:29:44] angels he said the voice of many either
[2:29:47] wrong above the throne there are three
[2:29:48] different categories there here on the
[2:29:51] throne is four living creatures outside
[2:29:54] of that 24 elders on salad act a host of
[2:29:57] angels so there are three categories
[2:29:59] wrong the throne four beasts living
[2:30:02] creatures is an array low hallelujah
[2:30:06] they are not angels they are not
[2:30:08] redeemed men what a day would you like
[2:30:11] to know
[2:30:11] here is my interpretation they are court
[2:30:14] guards of a strong these are his guards
[2:30:18] they are course angels to clad the
[2:30:20] throne so this throne of God is gathered
[2:30:24] that means any and anybody can access
[2:30:27] the glory the power the presence you're
[2:30:31] going to drum on that troll let me give
[2:30:34] the Lord a shout hallelujah hallelujah
[2:30:38] praise God praise God
[2:30:40] the first piece lion okay I skip that
[2:30:43] whoo glory to God and in Ezekiel chapter
[2:30:45] 1 there was on wheels and one explained
[2:30:48] that the four beasts and they couldn't

[2:39:43] come on give your son praises beyond all
[2:39:50] shadow he drove out the man that he
[2:39:54] placed at the east of the garden
[2:39:56] cherubim flying science fine sword
[2:39:59] flaming sword turn every week the four
[2:40:02] piece there's only four ways you could
[2:40:04] go east-west not and so so all you need
[2:40:08] is four guess the only for PC could go
[2:40:11] east/west not insult isn't that right
[2:40:14] these cherubim are flaming sword at the
[2:40:17] gate in the gadna eating cause if man
[2:40:19] ever got hold of the Tree of Life he
[2:40:22] could live forever
[2:40:23] oh my so these cherubim first mentioned
[2:40:27] whether the east gate of the garden
[2:40:29] going for means there's a Garden of Eden
[2:40:33] and this is the gate that opens swings
[2:40:35] out and at the gate or the cherubims it
[2:40:38] doesn't the cherubim it said Terrapins
[2:40:40] was placed there to guard what the Tree
[2:40:44] of Life that is what there was the guard
[2:40:46] the way of the Tree of Life the way boys
[2:40:50] away Jesus where is it reflected from
[2:40:53] the holy place where there was
[2:40:56] terrible's the holiest of Holies
[2:40:58] they are garden and reflecting the fire
[2:41:02] of God the way of the Tree of Life it
[2:41:04] can't come from Presbyterian seminary or
[2:41:07] Pentecostal seminary is a reflected
[2:41:10] light that might come from the throne of
[2:41:12] God these cherubims that John saw must
[2:41:16] have been interested and keeping the
[2:41:18] Tree of Life
[2:41:19] therefore they're interested in human
[2:41:21] beings now what you just show watch they
[2:41:24] cap that you have like candidate if man
[2:41:26] eats this bread he will live forever no
[2:41:28] there's our way back to the Tree of Life
[2:41:30] I want to show you know here the meat
[2:41:33] okay say I get the salad
[2:41:35] you got to thing but this is this is my
[2:41:36] past ever this is the caustic armistice
[2:41:39] you know get your knife and fork ready
[2:41:40] this is what you're going to get no
[2:41:42] inside and they can tell you know I want
[2:41:44] to show you I make this sure it's an
[2:41:47] altar this must have been an altar at
[2:41:54] the Gardner Eden
[2:41:56] you know why do you remember Keenan evil
[2:41:59] come here to worship so that shows that
[2:42:03] God's altar was moved and set you at the
[2:42:07] Gardner Eden and the only way back to
[2:42:11] Eden is by the altar here you are again
[2:42:16] back to Eden true the altar they were to
[2:42:20] keep that mere two got it and they
[2:42:22] couldn't get back there until this
[2:42:24] author was covered with blood
[2:42:27] nothing but the blood there has to be an
[2:42:30] atonement a mercy seat and this altar of
[2:42:34] judgment becomes a mercy seat by the
[2:42:37] blood and when the blood is lifted it
[2:42:40] cannot the judgment again
[2:42:42] isn't that right and the only way to
[2:42:45] enter into the gate of Eden is to the
[2:42:46] blood of Jesus so King went out from the
[2:42:50] presence of the Lord from the kid of the
[2:42:52] garden therefore the presence of the
[2:42:55] Lord must have been at the altar so the
[2:42:58] dragon angels was guarding the presence
[2:43:00] of the Lord that was at the altar that
[2:43:03] all the reflected the throne of God
[2:43:06] oh then the proverb in little deeper he
[2:43:16] said Moses was told to make things as
[2:43:18] thought in heaven and the after the
[2:43:20] Covenant had cherubims carved out it's
[2:43:23] not right
[2:43:23] Prince beatitude wings touch each other
[2:43:26] to represent the cat's hallelujah the
[2:43:30] after the Covenant but teacher burns the
[2:43:31] gaudy act what was a throne guards the
[2:43:35] God the mercy seat when God there we go
[2:43:37] in his Shekinah glory where was the
[2:43:41] Shekinah glory at the mercy seat the
[2:43:43] garden Shekinah glory he said woo listen
[2:43:46] friends then it goes to show that not no
[2:43:49] scallywag every Scalia and come there
[2:43:53] and pick of that that is why when the
[2:43:57] sons of sceva was trying to cast the
[2:43:59] devil out come out of him in the name of
[2:44:01] Paul who poor creatures common endeavor
[2:44:03] and them devil top doctor dimension Paul

[2:44:10] and I'm spirit jump on them fellas
[2:44:12] because trying to cast them in name of
[2:44:14] Jesus that poor creature

[2:44:19] the Shekinah glory comes off the throne
[2:44:22] of God those Devils know and they
[2:44:24] recognize the authority of God that
[2:44:27] comes back in the church those Devils

[2:44:54] act and he had to anoint his church to
[2:44:56] approach His Holiness Jesus his life was
[2:44:58] squeezed out and the same holy was upon
[2:45:01] him is put upon the church to perfume
[2:45:03] that person approaching the holiest of
[2:45:05] holies has she been jointed with the
[2:45:07] same Holy Spirit and he walks holy holy

[2:46:21] the resume of the ages he says the ears
[2:46:24] started at the tiller a twentieth
[2:46:26] century and it was to the age in which
[2:46:28] true church would return to being the
[2:46:31] bride she was at Pentecost we know that
[2:46:33] them was of necessity be a return of
[2:46:34] dynamic power the believers sense this
[2:46:37] in their spirits began crying to God for
[2:46:39] a new or poem in the first century what
[2:46:42] seemed to be the answer came as many
[2:46:46] began to speak in tongues and manifest
[2:46:48] gives in the spirit it was then believed
[2:46:50] that this was indeed the long-awaited
[2:46:52] restoration it was not for the latter
[2:46:55] rain here we go can only come after the
[2:46:58] former rain which is teaching REME the
[2:47:01] latter rain is harvest rain how could
[2:47:04] this be the real thing talking about the
[2:47:05] Pentecostal revival how could it be the
[2:47:07] real thing when the teaching rain has
[2:47:09] come the Prophet messenger who was sent
[2:47:12] to teach the people until the heart of
[2:47:14] return back to the pedicle forefathers
[2:47:15] had not yet come thus what was thought
[2:47:18] to be the restoration and final quittin
[2:47:21] on the rapture had not come in it was a
[2:47:24] mixture here we go
[2:47:26] the unrighteous partaking of spiritual
[2:47:29] blessing that's already to mend the
[2:47:33] unrighteous partaken of spiritual
[2:47:37] blessings and manifesting in the Holy
[2:47:40] Ghost as we have kept pointing out to
[2:47:42] you
[2:47:42] it was also was daily power as men was
[2:47:47] under the control of Devils yet no one
[2:47:51] seemed to realize it and to prove it was
[2:47:54] not real these people even before the
[2:47:57] second generation I appeared organized
[2:47:59] and wrote it on Scripture doctrines and
[2:48:01] build their own fences as every other

[3:03:19] masterpiece amen
[3:03:22] and there's so much that was said but as
[3:03:26] Roberta's coming to the end of his
[3:03:27] message he was referring to when those
[3:03:30] men said Paul I know and Peter I know
[3:03:33] and you know what I I heard a preacher
[3:03:35] say the devil has got to know your name
[3:03:37] [Music]
[3:03:39] the devil has got to know your name you
[3:03:42] have to break enough of the rules of
[3:03:44] this kingdom for the devil to recognize
[3:03:46] who you are so not only will they say
[3:03:49] Paul I know Pete I know but but he won
[3:03:52] they say but I'm honest I know him too
[3:03:54] and I know she and Williams and I know
[3:03:57] Antonio Brian because when they speak
[3:04:00] their words are backed up because they
[3:04:02] come from corner going back to God
[3:04:07] so you know you're making progress when
[3:04:09] the devil knows your name and there's a
[3:04:11] warrant out for you because you are just
[3:04:13] different but we are called to be
[3:04:15] different can we give the Lord a shout a
[3:04:18] blessed be the name of the Lord
[3:04:21] we have some phrases and prayer requests
[3:04:24] from but the Mike Blackman I want to
[3:04:26] give our Lord and Savior high note of
[3:04:28] praise he said I hacked the church to
[3:04:31] pray for God's protection during the
[3:04:33] vacation that my wife and I took we
[3:04:35] spent time in boot Bahamas and in our
[3:04:38] last week in Florida there was bad
[3:04:40] weather warning during that period but
[3:04:43] all was well I thank God for getting us
[3:04:45] all before the incoming storm which came
[3:04:48] just days after we left what another
[3:04:50] praise amen

[3:06:16] heart maybe it's for healing maybe for
[3:06:20] the Holy Ghost maybe it's just for a
[3:06:21] touch maybe it's just be able to tie a
[3:06:25] knot on the rope and to just hang in

[3:10:23] believer that we don't spend enough time
[3:10:27] practice in the presence of the Lord we
[3:10:31] don't spend enough time practicing the
[3:10:34] presence of the Lord a lot of people
[3:10:37] soon after service is over they can't
[3:10:39] wait to get back to quote/unquote life
[3:10:43] they can't wait to get back to paying
[3:10:45] the bills they can't wait to get back to
[3:10:48] reporting for work but when you hear
[3:10:51] you're in the presence of the Lord and
[3:10:53] there's coming a time you know but of it
[3:10:56] was preaching and he said you know you
[3:10:58] don't know this is the last service you
[3:11:00] don't know if a new tweak is gonna come
[3:11:01] and I saw the pictures of Barbara and
[3:11:04] some of these islands or whatever stated
[3:11:06] and I said you know Alberta speak and
[3:11:09] said they were been up there might have
[3:11:10] been a preacher preaching the Sunday
[3:11:12] before and they didn't know that was
[3:11:14] their last service because they say over
[3:11:17] 90% of the island is uninhabitable and
[3:11:20] they would have gone to church thinking
[3:11:23] it's just another service mother
[3:11:24] suddenly not knowing that the church
[3:11:27] building would no longer be there but
[3:11:29] the Branham said in a court he said one
[3:11:31] day Bible will be shut one day the last

[3:11:46] place like that's covered under the
