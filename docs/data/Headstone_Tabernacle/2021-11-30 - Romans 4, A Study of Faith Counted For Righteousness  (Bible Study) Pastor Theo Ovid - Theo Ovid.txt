have to walk in in his will maduka has been among us i believe twice and coming to the conventions in trinidad and you know his wife and and i know that is a tremendous loss not just for him but also for the church there in lagos nigeria so let's put our heads almighty god we do thank you for your grace lord and your blood and the cross at calvary that has given us the opportunity to cross each other's path without the gospel we would have never known each other or maybe encountered each other lord you made special provisions that we have friends and believers from around the world of light precious faith and father we thank you tonight for their lives and their testimonies in their various countries and to this can we bring brother maduka this family before you that your comfort will go to them lord and ministers of them in a way that that human and flesh and blood can minister remember the lagos church as they go through their own tectonic movement or their own portion of pain as this is what life affords us stress distress and and pain and suffering but through it all we are comforted by your word that romans 8 28 the lord and all things will work together for good to them that love you and we love you father and we created the love of god to reach out to the family and bless them remember the beach and family father visit them in a special way and those that don't know you may they come into the saving knowledge of jesus christ by the witness of your spirit calling them to come home to come to the cross to come to calvary bless this session tonight lord of the word of this bible study and what we will have to share may be an encouragement maybe a soul-searching maybe something to think on a silla rest opposed to think on these things granted father she wait on you in jesus name i ask it amen i want to thank you tonight for coming out and um being here with us to fellowship around the word of god and we certainly do appreciate it tonight and we'll see what the lord will do amen so the prophet said something here one he said here when god wants us to unfold the word we are living in the last days we are trying to linger back on some old church creed we're living in the time that god's great beautiful church ought to be standing on its feet shining like the lily of the family but we are back some say well i belong to presbyterian methodist pentecostal i'm this that what a disgrace you should be unfolding we should be unfolding god's spirit point out not just one little gusher not one little baptism but baptism after baptism not a revelation joshua by faith or sanctification of the gifts of the spirit but revelation after revelation power after power glory after glory we ought to be way up the road ready for the translation and we are lingering back down in all things saying well we keep going back let's go forward and i want to encourage you tonight friends let's go forward regardless of what took place back in your life seek to go forward this is what god wants you to do our scripture here tonight revelation 13 you've got to find it i want to read this here this is our backdrop to what we want to share version 13 says then up i stood upon the sun of the sea and saw a beasts rise up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten horns ten crumbs upon his head the name of blasphemy and the beast which i saw was like on the leopard his feet were at the feet of a beer his mouth as a mother of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great authority and i saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wandered after the beast and they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast and they worshipped the beast saying who is like unto the beast who is able to make war with him and there was given unto him among speaking greetings and blasphemies and powers given up to him to continue forty and two months and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against god to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven and it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them and power was given him over all kindreds tongues and nations note verse 7 here power was given him over all kindreds and tongues and nations who is him the beast was eight and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world i read that one again and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him who is him the beast whose names are not written in the book of the life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world so we have something to thank god tonight if you recognize and understand that he put your name in the lamb's book of life and it is impossible for you to give the beast system any worship at all now what's the name you was thinking about that a name and it has this description a word or set of words by which a person or thing is known addressed or referred that's what a name is a name a person a thing and to this person an individual tonight we want to zero in tonight tonight we want to speak to the individual you as an individual not family or group but you as an individual not one hiding in church or hiding in a prayer group or hiding in a you know the ladies group or men's group or whatever but you as an individual before god now i believe that god has a low meant to feel ministries to feel pastors to feel big guys to feel and fall and i believe it is to ensure that our confidence doesn't rest on the arms of flesh we have seen men crumble and crack and feel and fall over the years and it tells us the god we serve this god who say i hate the deeds of the nicoletas he hate men that would conquer his people and we know that the church and the body of believers is not tools or to be tools in the hands of these manipulative men and the bible talk about in the statue of perfect man or shall i say in ephesians 4 and one of the objectives of this fightful ministry for the perfection of the saints the work of the ministry edifying the body is is still we all come unity of the faith knowledge of the son of god and to perfect man under the fullness of the measure of the statute of the measure of the study of christ and this other party that we be no more children tossed to and through by the slave of men in conicon and craftiness whereby the line way to deceive now these are not uh irregular bandits and crooks these are crafty ministries men that actually handle the word with craft i don't think it's the man himself i believe the spirits that influence people to handle the word of god and craft deceitfully um command to manipulate people's lives now before i came on tonight i was thinking about truth i was wondering to share something about whole truth you know there's something about having full truth or whole truth there's a reason that it just said do you swear or to tell the whole truth nothing but the truth and only the truth there's a reason for that because you could leave all things and it's not a whole truth you could add things and it's not whole truth so we always look for that balance then it always had the jihad groups the the suicide bombers the extremists in everything extreme to the left extreme to the right but we have been taught to strive to come down in the middle of the road there is always a middle there is always fanatics on both sides it has the the conservative who should i see it the intellectual fanatics the fanatic to our fault in terms of the crimes i've said email i'd have the wild one they will swing on the lights they give them a chance but but we are called not to be a lemon not to be a tangelo but to be orange not sweetie sweetie sweetie not sour sausage but to be a real orange so tonight in looking at this individual um we want to look at abraham and i want you to note how the bible fleshes out this character called abraham as an individual and god called abraham out of the whole world of people why because ibraheem is better no it's grace god's chosen election and call you are what you are because the grace of god has made you what you are if you if you want to remember something tonight or i should say don't forget this tonight you are what you are because the grace of god has made you what you are it's by grace these things are called god are set in the church god has to call you to be a christian let me repeat that it's from the prophet god has to call you to be a christian god called abraham and he elected him not because he was better than somebody else but because god has called him and this is for christians then after god called him the first thing i want you to do is separate yourself that is what god calls for today so a genuine call of god is reflected by the call to separation because god don't ever call you and say stay where you are when the call of god goes to you it always calls you out of what you're in because that is why you come to call not stay where you are you're blessed and you have no stress and you're good and everything is nice no no you're in the wrong place in the wrong atmosphere in the wrong position come out if you stay where you are you'll be destroyed if you stay where you are things will fall apart so i'm calling you out to show you alone to give you allah to give you a promise this was god's approach to abraham no in chapter 11 of genesis it gives at the end india gives the background of ibraheem lineage and they talk about neho we got terror terror live 70 years we got ibrahim neho and hiran we find out that hiran and and abraham and neo took them wives the name of even what was sirai name of niho's wife was milka name of hiran the father of milka and the father of iska and syria was barren and she had no child and lot was the son of herod sun right and that is how the ending of chapter 11 closes off all of a sudden in genesis chapter 12 of verse 1 it it it goes here now the lord had said unto abraham get thee out of their country and from thy kindred and from my father's house onto a land i will show thee so it wasn't as if god gave him a blueprint a map a treaty a picture on a video of this land and trying to stimulate abraham after you see it you see it you see it look look at the trees in it look the food's in it no he said onto a land i will show you so you see it yet right it was true and i will make thee a great nation i will bless thee and make thy name great and doubt shall be a blessing i will bless them that bless thee and cursed him that cursed thee and indeed shall all the families of the earth be blessed that's all go tell abraham come out i will bless you i'll show you the land i'll bless them that bless you curse them i kiss you verse 4 and abraham departed as the lord had spoken unto him a lot went with him ivan was 70 and five years old when he departed out of here so abraham watch the action of fate at work because that's what we want to get into tonight and drain them a bit this action of faith make abraham leave his comfort zone leave his known world leave friends environments um fellowships um whatsapp groups whatever he left it watched and departed of the heron he took sarah his wife was five unlocked his brother's son and all their substance that they had gathered and the souls that they had gotten in here and they went forth to go into the land of canaan and into the land of canaan the king and abraham passed through the land unto the priests of shechem under the plain of mori and then canaanite was then in the land and the lord appeared to abraham and said and said unto thy seed will i give this land and dear builded an altar unto the lord who appeared unto him so now we want to go into our substantive scripture for tonight romans 4. and i call this a study of romans 4 study of faith counted for righteousness romans 4 we want to go if you have your bibles going wanna go to romans chapter four tonight at first you wanna read from one to ten and we would take it down the track and see what the lord will have for us tonight praise the lord romans chapter four what shall we then see that abram or father aspecting into the flesh had found for if abraham were justified by works he had way of the glory not before god but what saith the scripture abraham believed god and it was counted for him for righteousness now to him that wicket is the reward not reckon of grace but of debt okay now that all right we continue but to him that will get not but believe it on him that justified the ungodly this is a big one his fate is counted for righteousness even as david also described it the blessedness of the man under whom god imputed righteousness without works and then paul here in verse 7 is quoting david saying blessed are thee whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin commit this blessedness then upon the circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision also for we say that faith was reckoned to abraham for righteousness then how was it then reckon how was the fate how was righteousness attributed to abraham's feet when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision not in on not in circumcision but in uncircumcision and he received here we go the sign of circumcision and this is where the holy ghost comes in a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised so this is not faith when you go to church this is faith before you reach the church this is faith that you had as a sinner this is faith that god put inside of you because the cornerstone of fate was leading you guess where guess when before the foundation of the world so before the foundation of the world god put that seed inside of you that gene inside of you that germ inside of you something inside of you that could make you respond that's what we've seen here's the night he received a sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the fate which he had yet being uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them also the father of circumcision to them who are not of this exception only but who also walk in the steps of feet of our father abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised here we go for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to abraham or to his seed to the law but to the righteousness of faith i want to read from the amplified verse 10 to 13 and kind of kept that this part off and it says unlike how it phrased it in verse 10 how then was it credited to him was it before or after he had been circumcised it was not after but before he was circumcised he received the mark of circumcision as a token or an evidence and seal of righteousness where she had by faith while he was he still uncircumcised faith so that he was to be made the father of all who truly believe do without circumcision and who does have righteousness which is right standing with god imputed to them and credited to their comp if loved credited to their come as well as that he made the father of those circumcised persons who are not merely circumcised but also walk in the way of that faith which all father abraham had before he was circumcised for the promise to abraham all his posterity that he should inherit the world did not come true observing commands of the law but through the righteousness of faith may god bless his word you love him tonight i trust that this would assist you tonight in this fate walk and it is a feet walk and i want to emphasize again we are addressing the individual we're not addressing you and your mother you and your father you and your husband you and your wife you and your children you are the family and you're in the church no we're not talking about talking about you as an individual and when you see yourself as an individual it doesn't matter husband wife children mother father uncle aunt it doesn't matter it matters where you are standing with god that is what matters tonight genesis chapter 17 we want to read this go down into genesis chapter 17 chapter 17 when abraham was 99 years old and nine so this is quite some time from 75 almost 24 okay and the lord appeared to abraham abraham and said i am the almighty god now he's an old man but look at the address called given walk before me and be thou perfect and i will make my covenant between me and thee i will multiply thee exceeding me now this is a barren man this is a man wife is barren this man is old he can't have children and god is speaking to him i will make my covenant between me and thee and multiply thee exceedingly and abram fell on his face and god talked with him saying as for me behold my covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations not a father of children a father of many nations neither shall thy name anymore be called abram but thy name shall be abraham for a father of many nations have i made thee it's finished in god's mind it is finished in his thinking verse 6 and i will make thee exceeding fruitful i will make nations of thee and kings shall come out of me and i will establish my covenant between me and thee thy seed after thee in their generations plural for an everlasting covenant to be a god unto thee until i see it after thee and i will give unto thee until thy seed after thee the land wherein the water stranger all the land of canaan for an everlasting possession and i will be their god and quote unto abraham though shall keep my covenant therefore dull and thy seed after thee in their generations this is my covenant which you shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee every man child among you shall be circumcised or shall receive the holy ghost back to the holy ghost and he shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin it shall be a token of the covenant between mixed near you and he that is eight years old shall be circumcised among you every man child in your generations he that is born in the house or bought with money of any stranger which is not of thy seed he that is born in thy house he that is brought with thy money must needs be circumcised and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant isn't that something so god and this was a natural land he was bringing abram to it was a whole natural satan and god give a natural cutting of the flesh in order to show a token evidence that this is a covenant between me and you between abraham and god and his seed after him so it was it was from one land the land that abram was in to canaan natural land to natural land but but we know where we are at that god call us into a spiritual baptism because the holy ghost really is our land in this time of either one land of promise isn't that right amen praise the lord so now we want to look at the covenant that god gave abraham and do you find that covenant is in genesis chapter 50. you go to slip to genesis chapter 15 and uh you will find out what the lord spoke to abraham abraham reaction this was the very beginning of god really sticking giving abraham this jab this jab of this promised son coming to him after these things genesis 15 verse 1 the word of the lord came unto abraham in a vision saying fear not ibrahim his name is not changed here yet i am thy shield an exceeding great reward so this is what god speak to abraham and abraham said lord god what will dog give me seen i go childless and the steward of my house is this elise of damascus abraham said behold to me that was given no seed and no one born in my house is my ear and behold the word of the lord came on them saying this shall not be done here but he that shall comfort out of their own bowels shall be dying here and you know sometimes we are challenged we are challenged about our own selves many times it eases a belief for somebody else than to believe for your own self you're praying for this one you're praying for that one you believe koga heal this one lord god bless this one but you're not believing god will bless you god will heal you or deliver you you believe that this one will get delivered you believe this one will get a breakthrough you believe that everybody else but not you why why is it so difficult to believe god speaking to you as an individual and he means what he says god wasn't generalizing god told abraham i am thy she i am thy exceeding great reward god told abraham this shall not be thine ear but he that shall comfort out of thine own bowel shall be done here this fight and he brought him forth abroad and said look now towards heaven and tell the stars if they'll be able to number them he said unto him so shall i see be and this is the path and he believed in the lord and he commented it to him for righteousness so god took abraham faith and pronounced him righteous based upon his fate trust confidence reliance on god what an exchange tonight that god could take your faith and pronounce you as righteous because of that fate now this fate is the original fate this is the same fate that noah had when noah couldn't explain how this flood was going to come and all know i could rely on is god said so when the scientists come and said we never come from heaven before and this and that and all the explanation and the scientific facts that they have all naw could rest back on is god said so how could abraham explain that his body will be changed or transformed to produce isa how could abram explain that syrah will be changed he couldn't all he could say is god said so could you come to that spot where you could receive the promises of god and just say god said so and count your feelings your flesh whatever come as a lie and believe god would to be true and become a daughter of abraham a son of abraham that's tackled not at the promise of god do you think that there will be people like that i i do i do because ghost and a prophet to turn our hearts back to the feet of the fathers and after luke 17 you get luke 18 and in luke 18 the question was asked jesus asking when the son of man committed shall he find faith and in other words things would be so messed up fatally so scarce because i'll tell you something one thing that you could see evidence of faith is praise and worship one thing that you will always see where fit is present you will always see an atmosphere of praise and thanksgiving because fate is the equivalent of that dollar or that money to buy the bread so even though you don't have the bread yet even though you don't go you haven't reached the bakery yet you have the purchasing power of the bread so therefore you could rejoice you have to journey to the bakery to get the bread but you have the money you can't eat the money you can't give away the money that money is to purchase the bread you exchange the fate and you get the bread but because you have the money you could rejoice because all you're waiting for is to get the bread faith is the substance of what you're hoping for is the evidence of what you have not seen that's what faith is so isaac was booted into abraham's spirit he couldn't show isaac to sarah because god didn't speak to her faith come by hearing and hearing the word the word came to abraham so abraham had a bit of faith syrah did not have that but god told abraham seerah is true syria you're going to have that son so he had was to believe not only for himself but believe for his wife also so he had a double challenge on his hand to believe god for himself and that is why tonight you have to begin to see yourself as an individual to your between the bed one taking one left two in a few one taking one left you have to begin to see do you have the faith i'm not talking about your husband praying for you i'm not sure about your wife praying for you i'm just going to church praying for you i talk about you yourself having defeat that was once delivered to the saints or defeat to go to this rapture or the fate and make it to be one of those who are alive and remain oh praise the lord tonight or do you get it praise the lord and i hope tonight that this is helpful to you so then uh verse four you can just go over that and behold the word of the lord came at him saying um okay no and he believed in the lord who's six and he counted it to him or righteousness and he said unto him and look how god speaks i am the lord that brought thee out of the earth of the chaldeans to give d to this land inherited and you could take it personal i am the lord that brought you out of adultery or lion or the bar or drinking or smoking or the world i am the lord that brought you out of the ear of charlie's to give thee this land to inherit it and he said lord god whereby shall i know i shall inherit it that's a beautiful question he wanted a confirmation of this inheritance so all this now a realm of faith and around the spirit and he said unto me take me a half of three years old she go three years old around three years old turtle love young pigeon he took unto them all these divine enemies made each piece one against the other but the birds divided it not when the falls came upon the carcasses ibrahim drew them away bush 12 and when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon abram and lua horror of great darkness fell on upon him so he's going into vision and god is speaking to him about the darkness speaking them about his experience he said unto abram no of a surety this is sure that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not the earth and shall save them and they shall afflict them 400 years and also that nation whom they shall save will i judge and afterwards shall they come out with great substance and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace though shall be buried in good old age but in the fourth generation they shall come here again for the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full so by this scripture here you could understand that god doesn't just work in a haphazard manner he is waiting for the iniquity of the amorites to be full verse 17 came to pass but when the sun went down it was dark they were smoking fullness fire right a burning lamb that passed through those pieces in the same day the lord made a covenant with abraham so what is happening here something supernatural is taking place here it has nothing to do with human this has to do with the light the burning lamp the white light the light of elohim the light of the holy spirit so in other words something supernatural this is abraham's experience it's not a group experience it's not a church experience this is not the pastor's experience this is abraham's experience in the same day the lord made a covenant with abraham saying unto thy seed have i given this land from the river of egypt unto the great river the river euphrates and god gave details the canites canazites cadmium knights hittites perizzites reaffirms amorites canaanites gershoscites jebusites oh blessed be the name of the lord so god lifted all these things to show the land the details of the land that he used to take so let's continue now switch back to rumors you want to continue romans 13 to 25. want to continue of that same scripture romans 4 13-25 oh blessed be the name of the lord could we give you god some praises tonight hallelujah hallelujah see what i said about faith one thing you could see these scriptures say says am i going to read it here now okay verse 13. for the promise that he should be heir of the world was not to abraham or to a seed to the law but through the righteousness of faith that's verse 13 14 run over forward and if d which are of the lobby ears fate is made void so it doesn't make sense having faith if keeping the law make your ear so it's saying faith is made void and the promise made of non-effect because for safety the law will get wrath for where no law is there is no transgression therefore it is a faith for 16 that it might be by grace here we go therefore it's what it is a faith reason that it might be by grace that would reason again therefore it is a fate that it might be by grace now the holy ghost alone alone is the divine revealer of the revelation of jesus christ so when you see my pastors and men pumping that they're revealing this and revealing that that is foolishness they could preach but they can't really reveal they could speak the word but revelation and that is what the church is built upon the church is not built upon knowledge the church is built upon peter gave it he said though had the christ the son of the living god the fact was if the key was given to what by what jesus said flesh and blood hath not revealed it's unto you so that is why the revelation of jesus christ can be made known in the most illiterate prison that is why you don't even have to have an education to get revelation how many standards tonight you don't have to have a degree you don't have to pass common entrance you don't have to even ever go to school and you could have divine revelation that is why the bible described peter and they as ignorant and unlearned but they had to take note that they've been with jesus because it's the holy ghost revealing it to you it has nothing to do with flesh and blood it has to do with the operation of the spirit so the spirit who know you by name hallelujah and a name is an individual hallelujah not a group not a group named an individual john jones harry whatever it is it's the individual when god called you by name john andrew philip peter all our names so god doesn't call you as a group gentiles god call you as an individual so when you think about that that means you could have your own personal revival tonight you can have your personal dynamics your personal presence your personal witness of the spirit your rainbow could come down the glory of god will come over you tonight right in your home and that has nothing to do with anybody else in the zoom room you are in a zone all by yourself as a son as a daughter of god blessed by god called by god elected by god predestinated by god whose name on the land local life before the foundation of the world and the devil can't do anything about it he can't take your joy he can't take your peace he can't take a revelation because jesus is upon this rock i will build my church and jesus can't lie if there's one thing we know jesus can't lie he said that the gates of hell shall not reveal against it's impossible think about it now they could break down the church building but they can't break down the revelation because the revelation is god himself that you heard from heaven you heard from your tiophone you heard from the spirit itself and that gives you the assurance in your heart oh my i can say the rapture is a revelation he said the bride of christ is waiting for the referee so if they react to the revelation which church could have that think about it it's so foolish join here come here come here which church would give the revolutionary rapture they can't that comes from god the church the pride is written for revelation of the rapture and i'll keep saying the rapture is in you it has to be inside of you just as the kingdom is inside of you and when the big magnet of the dynamics or the charity of the holy ghost or the voices of angel when they come to pick up you can only pick up those that magnetize it oh hallelujah oh being for tremendous time i tell you friends we in fact tremendous time this word from the prophet small cannot return void it's impossible he stood there for all these years speaking and we wasn't even wrong yet some of us was even born yet but he was speaking for us because he knew we would come he's a prophet he went up into the knowledge of god seed on the road dropped back down and said i believe the bride is called i see the bright seal into the kingdom she's waiting on dynamics and so on he see you so you guys sit down there like a lump and a log like in your old age and you're saying like you're dying like you were dead you don't make it or what kind of thing you can't go like that think about this man called abraham he was old and god said walk before me be not perfect not because you're old you had to walk like a sucker not because you're all gotta walk like if you're you're losing your mind or something so like that god still demands perfection because that is what where we come from come for something that is perfect you want us to go back to that we only bypass our tea offending our word buddy to be tempted here are the only purpose that is the only reason we we are how we are we bypass that word part that of any part is is come from taught the flesh in order to be tested and the reason god could say have you considered my seven job is because he knew that what in job the devil don't know the devil don't have a revelation with son of joke he thinks it's all these natural things he's not your blessing because bless his people you know what god blesses blessing what god bless is properly blessed and when god put his hand upon you nobody can take but change that blessing i don't care what they say i've seen it over the years people curse people expect you to fall you look in the waiting and you snake that bit pole you're waiting for it to drop down you're waiting for it to freeze up and you went to hell you went through all kind of thing but you're still alive today you're still pressing forward today you still have an anchor you still have a anchor to your soul people crash ships wreck and you're still sealing through and people want to know how your boat making sure you see you're both leaning so lean this way and what kind of thing but you're still making it true for the anchor whole that won't have to be christ gonna be a man you cannot be a pastor let me say good cannot be a evangelist it cannot be apostle and prophet it cannot be flesh and blood it has to be the holy spirit himself god himself oh glory to god man just parisian is beef in front of they presenting themselves and when they crack up and they fall under people lose faith and they think they're overthrown they call it trust present man and when isaiah was leaning on king uzziah and god removed king uzziah by judgment let me say it good when god removed king uzziah by judgment and as i have run into the temple and then god gave him a supernatural experience he said i saw the lord high and lifted up oh glory to god we think we are somebody and that's the problem we think we somewhere we did the god so jazz saw the lord high and lifted up and strained filled the temple and then he saw the saraswati holy holy lord when he called the atmosphere there what do he's nothing he said what was me what you gonna do yeah you wear a shoe your dress your shoes your tie your car your house what you're gonna show your plane your rocket what you will show god when you're coming to divine presence where flesh comes like nothing oh hallelujah woe is me i'm undone my mother won't clean the seraph come with coals fresh coals for fiery coals off the altar oh god bring back them coals bring back the fire coals all the foolishness will get burned out all the unbelief will get blown out all the lust will get burned out everything contrary in your life heart spirit will get burned out by the fire of the holy ghost he doesn't watch our water what we need is fire water is way too much a word word word word mystery mystery hidden mystery deep mystery long long journal services without any fire without any paul without any witness of the spirit and to me this is what we need tonight sorry i sound like a preacher not to get excited i get excited because there's one man abraham this man that stood for righteousness and stood for faith and leave his country leave a safe zone as a problem a lot of you you like to stay safe in your safe zone you're not going to step out tonight you are being challenged to step out from where you act into the promises of god into the the you know into god's hands then lord new people you're sending me two's a whole new environment you're breaking them into and he said yes lord yes lord i'm willing to go i'm willing to pay that price i'm willing to see what the lord or your lord lead oh blessed be the name of the lord you love him tonight or give the lord some praises oh blessed be the name of the lord so so watch now for if verse 14 they which are of the lord be heirs fate is made void from his speed of non-effect because the law will get wrath and where no law is there is no transgression therefore it is a fate that is made by greece to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not only the witches of the law but that also which is of the fate of abraham was the father of paul how else could revelation 22 17 be effective if not for the grace of god in this hour of judgment god put a blood cord god put a hidden mystery brought put in revelation in revelation 22 17 and the spirit and the bright side come that is for our loved ones that is for our family amidst judgment the monk zion will be the bride and the bride will have the blood of jesus the bride of the spirit itself the bride will pack the mercy seat for the final time just say the spirit and the bright say come here we go let him not hear it say come and whosoever will that is where they come in let him come and take up the water of life freely you as the bride of jesus christ will be unfolding the living fountain their teaching well the everlasting fountain to your own loved ones and they will come in not because of their works right now they wearing short pants hot pants earring tattoo whatever they have right the off off-key right now but because of the grace of god the fountain will be opened up to them and it's their choice to respond the spirit and the bride say come right now we say come they say what come to church they're not interested in that they're really not interested in the church but you see when the darkness covered you growth darkness covered the people and if the bible says mr arise and time for thy light has come and you could unlock the founding the fountain that the spirit will flow freely and they see that they are running straight to them and this is the joy that we have like the lily pressing from the muck and the maya and all the old tires and all the old filth coming down the stream and you are just hitting here all kind of thing hitting by you keep pushing pushing pushing and you're pressing upwards because you have some flower to unfold you have revelation to unfold it has spirit to unfold and then bees out there waiting to see something unfold to come and partake of the nectar of this love of god they're gonna be flowing from the heart of this bride of jesus christ isn't he wonderful tonight so what's something therefore it is a fate that's might by grace verse 17 as it is written i have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even god who quick net the dead and call it those things which be not as though they were who against hope believe in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall my seed be and being not weak and faith here we go saints being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead nobody anybody did it when he was about a hundred years old neither the deadness of savior's room and this is the bomb here he staggered not at the promise of god true unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god you mean brother evidence of the strength of your faith is in evidence by the praises and the glory that you give to god yes exactly you know that when you fall insane you can't worship you get banged you get dumb because you get condemned condemnation in your heart and the devil himself is sitting on your shoulder and telling you who you praising god your hypocrite look what you do and until you get that out your system you're in trouble your spirit is not free you see but when you repent you make things right it gets off your shoulder then you have to limit the time to your lord your love of god over your soul because you know the mercy of god has returned back to your life david was feeling terrible terrible and david said restore unto me the joy of my salvation oh god i said but oh god i lost my joy oh god help me it's pressure it seemed david said i was glad that he said unto me let us go to your house you know what when db57 are boxing condition he had no glad he asked water restore bring it back bring back the passion bring back to cry to get in the spirit bring back the fervent desire to please god so he's taken that to the promise of god to unbelief but a strong in faith giving glory to god watch stagger not at what the promise of god now what god gave him promise that he'd be the father of nations he changed his name to show that it's secure it is fixed it's a done deal i'm changing the name from abram to abraham father of nation what is the promise of god let's read something here from the prophet so you notice before they got to the promised land before they were to enter afghanistan which will only be a few days 10 or 11 days maybe not that much only 40 something miles they would have went right on into the promised land right up to the year every stage of the journey that we have walked and they come across the red sea fire army was drawn behind them they were free from the enemies started through the wilderness got to the edge of the promised land that chemist by mia and there they feel why why did they fail moses said to the ten tribes you send out men of each man of each tribe to represent he tried to inspire the land to see what kind of condition it was i said that's exactly up to this place this morning where you come today the church has come to justification through luther through signification through the methodist and now up to the time of the promise the promise is the baptism of the spirit the promise is what the baptism of the spirit don't let nobody fool you the female promises have a high education knowing plenty things and because you know more than others it puts you on a higher plane than others that is foolishness that has absolutely nothing to do with the promise is the spirit that is what is wrong you shall receive power when when after that the holy ghost is come upon you so the promise is to get the holy ghost to come upon you and it has to have something to bring the holy ghost upon you there's a ladder there is faith and virtue and knowledge and temperance and patience and there will be kindness and then this holy ghost the person of the holy ghost comes upon that individual and then that is christ dwelling in sons and daughters of god he said when that time comes then you will see vindicated sons and vindicated daughters now before that time we are on our way we are journeying we will be deceiving you if we say we are dear never children say are we are you there yet and i say not yet are we there yet not yet we have a long day we get him to go down there that is where the position is to get here that's what we're promising to get there go there call out abraham to wild him up and and and gain a bogus and a fraudulent offer of this new land no no you give them a specific thing this land i'll give it to you when you see that that's what god did to give her so watch this you know the promise is the baptism of the spirit which is promised all to the old testament and new to the promise and he's identifying the promise there's not to you over the same islam behold i send the promise of my father upon you and peter said that on a little pentecost that is the promise and here we go the promised land is to live in this land of the holy spirit remember some bible let's not be had those that in the flesh cannot please god remember that so the promised land as many as led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god so god really want to hear us the pendulum swinging we're born in sin let's see you can see my finger let's say bonus in this way let's say the spirit is this way so now when we born instead we this week and this have to swing and come across this so this is what happened in other words you're being released from sin and as you go this way the grip of the devil he has less grip on your life so you're going this way you're getting nearer you're getting nearer you're going towards this other side here now which is the land of the spirit you see then you will see perfect visions perfect holy spirit books charity come down to give that you're going towards this way and when you're ready here now you're ready here for the translation you're getting ready for the rapture this flesh pan here he cannot subject himself to god whatsoever he's the enemy of god this guy on this idea so god has to do something together some here to get us over this other way here now so i'm saying it's not an overnight thing but it's a growth thing so as we grow in god we get closer to god and the experiences of our lives the journey that god takes us through that is why we have to hold to certain scriptures for example romans 8 28 we have to hold to that in real not all things work together for good um sometimes you know when things were kind of nice no all things it can be something all things work together for good because he is omniscient he know the end from the beginning so he know the jamming you're getting in this issue here and the pressure you're getting is good for you because this will qualify you for the next level if he ease up the pressure on you by the time the other level comes you will just faint and fall and just give up but you have to be taken from states to stage we was we were not born victorious we were born defeated we wasn't we didn't wasn't born victory we were born defeated we grow into victory we grow into faith and faith is a victory that overcomes the world so as we grow in faith we grow in victory as we go in faith we go into stature as we go and say all things of god is of hit so god has to give you the faith to be here tonight god has to give you the fear to believe that uh you would hear from him tonight you would hear a word to your life tonight god has to give you that faith so let's continue so what this is the promise the promised land is to live in this land of holy spirit notice all what we're talking here are we speaking about here now have nothing to do with the church like the church church fellowship church that is god's promise for the church to live in the power of the spirit it's another world it's another land and here we go you have to come out of the conditions that you have been in to come out to live in this promised land to receive the promise remember the promise is you shall receive power from an eye after the holy ghost is come upon you so then barbara is reading the scripture and beat now we weakened fate he considered not his own body now dead when he was 100 years old neither the deadness of syria's room he staggered not on the promise of god true unbelief but strong giving glory to god at 100 years old look his body now dead his manhood save his womb is dead he wasn't even considered when he revealed him that bed and then barbara switches now switching address the conditions in the midst that bed is not considered you are paralytic whatever you are isn't considered the wheelchair is not under consideration for the little boy so brother branham is preaching this teaching this and he is releasing faith based on abraham not considering his own body or sarah's room dead and he is challenging them to say the bed is not considered you are paralytic so a paralysic person was on a bed he said that that is not even considered whatever you are isn't considered the wheelchair is not under consideration for that little boy may be paralyzed whatever it is i don't know it's not under consideration don't even consider it but the doctor said he will never get out of here the doctor said she will never come that is not even considered well look i'm an old person i'm getting middle aged not even considered and we here we go are the children of abraham hallelujah not as isaac was but his royal seed through jesus christ by faith that he had abraham's seed coming forth in the last days to shine like the stars abraham's children considered not his own body now dead neither even considered it it wasn't even brought into question whether god would do it or not god said he would do it why it was revealed to him and when it's revealed to you then you don't even consider anything else or impossible it is don't consider what the doctor said you don't consider what mama said what papa said but the preacher said what anybody else said just consider what god said he considered not his own body now dead these are the deadness of syria's room it wasn't even brought under consideration oh my that just shaking body dead down the deadness of syria's womb that even brought under consideration no circumstances or glory will be considered when faith finds its bed and ground now we're talking about real fate we're not talking about usage in church you're not saying oh yeah but i hear that already you know ah you know but here's saying about the same thing over here but it's not revealed to you you're gonna see if it's revealed to you when fate hits that bedding ground everything changes everything changes your blues your tiredness your weariness you're struggling all of that changes because faith is hallelujah feet does bring you to the rest faith is a struggle and a battle because you're climbing with faith you're persevering with fate canaan man is the rest okay you guys shut down in the wilderness you you you're tired so you decide to hold your tent the cloud moving so the pillar fire moving so and you you can't get that i am moving you will perish in the rhythm your willingness is not the journey the willingness is the journey rather the willingness is not the promise right now you go into your wilderness keep on going never behind you keep on moving let them stay behind don't let them get in front do you understand what i'm saying during the wilderness keep on moving because you're moving towards your promise you're moving to this is not a time to let go let up give up pack up team back this is another time corner virus is stopping he twists and he turning he call it a new variant well no we we're moving like abraham that we have a new variant not really a variant you're going back to the original you're going from less fit to more fit to greater faith we change into the night is one the change to change the trajectory of your life to change the trajectory of opening it work out and you're looking for the mercy oh grace i've got stop that stop that believe god believe what god said start to believe for your healing start the belief in deliverance oh glory to god are waiting for testimony for brother michael thompson to just send it out oh hallelujah you were supposed to get a heart operation and hope i ain't jumping a gun and and when you go back to the doctor doctors say you don't need that you don't need that this is a miracle you don't need that oh hallelujah what a rocking chicken thing say brother mike we have to talk hallelujah no long what a mike under manage i'll hold on believe in god and look a miracle comes so america could come for you tonight abraham with 25 years for his norwegian 120 years the upper room with 14 days oh glory to god don't get me started tonight i get an exercise tonight oh glory to god we can't be tired for abram gave his life for this message a bunch of jokers was in the beginning all in the 70s 80s all that run out now but you are here this is 2021 we're going into 2022. oh this year have to leave we had to leave this year without banging on with our bank we know getting into position you know about to get started this virus can't cool your feet this virus doesn't anoint your feet because we have a promise sons of god going to back up sickness but the back of diseases going to push back the plagues i see any points adopted sons oh hallelujah neither of this is not what we need them oh don't be one tonight oh get there tonight hallelujah praise god okay no circumstances will be considered when feet finds its bed and ground when a gym gene from a man finds the egg in the womb on both of them for a time something going to happen the doctors say you will not have a baby i can prove your genes are dead in your body and eggs will never be free time but let that fatal egg let that gym twist itself so like one time what should happen that little boy or little girl comes on the scene why feet has found his belly grub works go to work sell under pasel and here comes a little fella god have mercy upon us oh god if he was a rugged christian like we should be if we were men and women could take god of this word you can't do it until it's revealed to you how about the clues believe it or not oh now we know works as faith express and this is how we wrap up here and try to get enough balance notice the holy fate of god was united with the holy works of his prophet remember god's holy fate was revealed to abraham he received it and by dear he started with his holy works by believing and they see the promise are the place to grow what if he said abraham well you know syria after all have been 25 years since called me that promise if something would happen but it wouldn't god no it wouldn't the bible said in verse 20 we almost finished verse 20 of romans 4. he staggered not on the promise of god true unbelief but was strong and fake giving glory to god this to anyone says and being fully persuaded no you know what isaac would always say when it's worded like that it's for a reason it could say and being persuaded that he that had promised he was able to fulfill that what he promised he didn't see that and being persuaded no it's that fully there is for a reason and being fully persuaded you see you can be persuaded but not fully that's what he had promised he was able to find therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness oh you're mainly fully persuaded yes defeat fully persuaded it was then imputed unto him for righteousness oh glory to god and one time as a beautiful phrase the prophet said when abram came into the fullness of believing i just love that the fullness of it he believed but he came to the fullness of believing all right verse 24 we almost reach uh what and what okay it was 22. therefore it was imputed on him for righteousness no it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed in him but for us also who's 24 to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raise up jesus from our our lord from the dead who was delivered for our offenses and raised up for our justification oh blessed be the name of the law hallelujah thank you lord jesus i skipped a skip so let me just read this portion here from romans 18 amplified from film 18 for abraham human reasons for hope being gone hope and fate that he should become the father of many nations as he had been promised so numberless shall your descendants be he did not weaken in faith when he considered the utter impotence of his own body which was good as dead because he was 100 years old but when he considered the baroness of serious dead womb no unbelief or distrust medium waiver doubting me question concerning the promise of god but he grew strong and empowered by faith as he gave praise and glory to god fully satisfied and assured that god was able and mighty to keep his word and do what he had promised that is why faith was credited to him as righteousness but the words it was credited him or written not for his sake alone but here we go this for us but they were written for our sakes too righteousness standing acceptable to god will be granted and credited to us also who believe in trust in adhere to and rely on god raise up our lord from the dead who was betrayed and put to death because of our misdeeds and was raised to secure our justification or acquitter making our account balance and absorbing us from all guilt before god or this had been so well praised well phrased in other words we were in the red we were owen but when jesus rose up for our justification it balanced off the account he paid the arrest he paid off the mortgage he paid for your sins and now you stand justified and that would justify as if you never did it this is defeat that is exchanged for the righteousness of god give god glory tonight give god some praises tonight right where you are in your home and in your house we are done tonight this is how it was exchanged oh blessed be the name of the lord the fate counted for righteousness oh glory to god this is the study we had here in romans 4. let us bow our heads father i bless you tonight i praise you tonight it was such a joy to see the life and see the testimony of this man called abraham a reflection of the true believer a reflection of how fate has this personal work this individual walk it doesn't matter what the wife thinks or what do i feel it was hard for abraham i guess he must have wished that god spoke to his wife sarah it would have been so much easy the food might have been made with a smile in the whole atmosphere would have been so different she got cranky i guess she got upset i will guess she was old and you know it was really really rough but lord it harnessed and strengthened this feet of abraham and that's the feet royal seed fate that faith was to produce jesus christ and jesus christ produced that living faith that we are participating off tonight and you send a prophet lord to turn us back to the fate of the father this living faith god and we have such a powerful testimony from the michael thompson father oh god and and i trust lord as we hear different testimonies as the monies begin to grow and come forth that it will anoint the fate of your people and the feet will go higher and higher and higher until they could see such miracles such signs such wonders dead being raised included that would actually annoy their faith for the rapture because this rapturing is a glorified divine human and there are people now they don't want to talk about signs they don't want to talk about runners they don't want to talk about miracles and when we talk about that they fear we're talking pentecostal stuff but this is what the church had in the original and we have promised lord another book of acts begin to write it tonight any sick person in our midst heal them any backslidden them inaudib needing a touch from heaven tonight may you touch them tonight lord do miracles do wonders do signs among us lord confirm your word with signs one is miracles you promise in the last days there will be a church that jesus walking in in other words there will be a church that sin mark 16 will be an action father the bible said the lord himself and everywhere with them confirming the word with signs following father even though we are in different places and in this zoom room you audio you are not too you're not that you can't hear lord you can answer prayer and heal your people and deliver people and set them free oh god be with us lord jesus be with us the prayer meeting on the day of prayer and fasting on friday and be with the service on sunday granted lord jesus my ask it amen amen god bless you church thanks again for being here and you have been a great audience and i trust that you were edified at night by the scriptures and you would see as an individual that your work is a walk that nobody else could do because your name is the name that nobody else could answer to it's your name it's your work it's your call because that was chosen god bless you and good night
