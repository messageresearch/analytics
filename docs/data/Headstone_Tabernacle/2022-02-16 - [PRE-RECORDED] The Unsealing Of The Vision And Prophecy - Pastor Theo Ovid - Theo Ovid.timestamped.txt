[24:35] see what he will say
[24:37] unto me
[24:39] and
[24:40] shall i answ
[24:42] and answer when i am reproved
[24:44] and the lord answered and said write the
[24:46] vision and make it plain upon tables
[24:50] that he
[24:51] may run
[24:52] that readeth it
[24:54] for the vision is yet for an appointed

[25:05] reading from revelation chapter 10
[25:08] i want to read from verse 8.
[25:25] and the voice which i heard from heaven
[25:27] speaking to me again said go and take
[25:29] the little book which is open the hand
[25:31] of the angel which standeth upon the
[25:33] scene upon the earth and i went unto the
[25:35] angel and said unto him give me the
[25:36] little book he said unto me take it eat
[25:39] it up it shall make thy belly bitter but
[25:42] it shall be my mouth sweetest honey and
[25:44] i took the little book out of the
[25:45] angel's hand and ate it up and it was in
[25:48] my mouth sweetest honey as soon as i'd
[25:50] eaten it my belly was bitter he said
[25:53] unto me though must prophesy again
[25:56] before many peoples and nations
[25:59] and tongues
[26:00] and kings represent chapter 22 reading
[26:02] from verse 7.
[26:10] behold i come quickly
[26:12] blessed is he that keepeth the sins
[26:15] of the prophecy of this book
[26:17] and i john saw these things and heard
[26:18] them and when i had heard and seen i
[26:21] fell down to worship before the feet of
[26:24] the angel which showed me these things
[26:26] then said he unto me see thou do it not
[26:29] for i am thy fellow servant and are thy
[26:31] brethren the prophets and of them which
[26:33] keep the saints of this book worship god
[26:36] he said unto me seal not the saiyans of
[26:38] the prophecy of this book for the time
[26:40] is at hand he doesn't just let him be
[26:43] unjust still he was just filthy let him
[26:45] be filthy still he that is righteous let
[26:48] him be righteous still he that is holy
[26:50] let him be holy still and behold i come
[26:52] quickly and my reward is with me to give
[26:54] every man according and his work shall
[26:57] be let's bow our heads almighty god we
[26:59] thank you for your word and i pray dear
[27:02] god that you take me out of the way
[27:03] speak to our hearts may our lives be
[27:05] transformed by this word this morning
[27:08] made break upon us like a vision
[27:11] lord and inspiration granted father in
[27:13] jesus name we ask it amen and amen you
[27:15] may be seated
[27:24] this morning i have a title
[27:25] the unsealing of the vision and prophecy
[27:30] the unsealing of the vision and prophecy
[27:33] i have a taught
[27:35] inspiration making the vision plane
[27:39] something we shared last
[27:42] sunday i want to connect back to it
[27:44] god's behavior is his person
[27:48] what he is in his behavior
[27:51] declares
[27:52] his person
[27:53] and that's what you are
[27:55] in your behavior tells you
[27:58] what you are
[27:59] not what you say so much what not what
[28:01] you intend to be but what you are
[28:05] isn't that right so if god acted
[28:08] one time in a certain circumstance and
[28:10] that circumstance arise he has to act
[28:11] the same way
[28:13] because he's the same yesterday today
[28:15] and forever
[28:16] if god healed in a certain condition in
[28:18] time past he has to heal today because
[28:20] he's the same yesterday today and
[28:22] forever you believe that
[28:25] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[28:27] praise this wonderful name
[28:29] hallelujah
[28:31] so therefore from a prophet like moses
[28:34] he said now
[28:35] first
[28:36] apostles and prophets
[28:38] teachers evangelists and pastors five
[28:41] spiritual officers in the church to set
[28:44] the church in order
[28:46] apostles prophets teachers pastors then
[28:49] the local congregation have nine
[28:50] spiritual gifts but these offices and
[28:52] places
[28:53] is the offices you hear from the apostle
[28:56] his ministry you hear from the prophet
[28:58] his ministry from the evangelist from
[29:00] the teacher from the pastor each has a
[29:02] separate ministry and their ministries
[29:05] is of god and god has set them in the
[29:08] church for a purpose
[29:10] so the ministries that god sets in the
[29:12] church is for a purpose
[29:14] now no to whatever you say what god sets
[29:17] not what man put himself in but what god
[29:20] says and what god says he says
[29:23] and he will vindicate what he says isn't
[29:25] that right
[29:26] now what was the holy ghost given for
[29:29] here what is to give unction to the
[29:30] preacher it's to give holiness to the
[29:32] group it's to set the church in order
[29:36] so in other words it's not man to set
[29:38] the church in order it's the holy spirit
[29:41] that's why the holy spirit was given to
[29:43] set the church in order give unction to
[29:46] the preacher give holiness to the group
[29:48] it is to unite us together with power it
[29:50] is to unite us together with broadly
[29:52] love
[29:53] what's the holy ghost given for to unite
[29:55] us
[29:55] man can't unite us the holy ghost was
[29:58] given to unite us isn't that right
[30:00] and watch is to unite us together with
[30:02] brotherly love i don't care if you're
[30:04] methodist baptist presbyterian catholic
[30:07] in all inner rain altering no rain it
[30:09] doesn't matter you you're united by
[30:11] brotherly love by the spirit of
[30:13] forgiveness i love you praise god you
[30:15] love me i forgive you you forgive me we
[30:17] forgive one another and the honey sticks
[30:22] to god we will always do something in
[30:24] the flesh to offend somebody upset
[30:26] somebody trap somebody whatever it is
[30:28] but because i could repent and say
[30:30] forgive me my brother you could repent
[30:32] forgive me my sister and whatever it is
[30:34] we could forgive one another and we
[30:36] could be free
[30:37] isn't that right that is what the holy
[30:39] ghost was given for because all have
[30:42] sinned and come short of the glory of
[30:45] god there is none righteous no not one
[30:48] so you can't have anything to boast
[30:49] about you always have something that you
[30:51] could confess and repent about could we
[30:54] give the lord some praises this morning
[30:56] oh we're in church this morning
[30:58] hallelujah glory
[31:00] so whatever you are we have all been by
[31:02] one holy spirit baptized into one body
[31:05] and become members of the body of jesus
[31:07] christ it's glorious thing to become a
[31:09] member of the body of jesus christ once
[31:11] you're in that body nobody can pull you
[31:12] out you're in his body you are part of
[31:14] him oh glory to god he can't move
[31:16] without you or glory wherever he moves
[31:18] you're moving also you are in him you
[31:20] are part of him isn't that right could
[31:22] you get tangled up for that this morning
[31:26] oh
[31:26] are you ready for the word this morning
[31:29] now notice when judas fell
[31:32] the apostles
[31:34] handpicked by jesus
[31:37] chose matthias
[31:39] to replace judas
[31:41] but the pillar of fire
[31:43] choose paul
[31:44] who was not even amongst their group
[31:47] one was man's chosen
[31:49] the other was god's chosen by pillar of
[31:52] fire
[31:53] and god has promised to take the church
[31:56] or return the church to her homeland
[31:59] which is back to pentecost
[32:01] the holy spirit was sent
[32:03] to take the people back to the word
[32:06] and the angel is on the earth to do just
[32:09] that
[32:10] to take the people back to the world
[32:12] because god could only vindicate the
[32:14] word
[32:15] the angel's manifestation which is the
[32:18] holy spirit coming into the church
[32:21] through the voice of the archangel to
[32:23] make the prophetic vision plain
[32:26] superbanam
[32:28] against organization organized religion
[32:31] he said the church rejected christ
[32:33] the only church is we have christ on the
[32:35] outside knocking trying to get in and
[32:37] this angel's message
[32:39] messenger from god
[32:41] was echoing his message on the earth to
[32:43] come out of babylon
[32:44] the holy spirit today here we go
[32:47] the manifestation of the holy spirit the
[32:50] holy spirit come in all kind of
[32:51] manifestation but he's speaking about a
[32:53] specific move
[32:55] the manifestation of the holy spirit
[32:58] is that angel
[33:01] trying to get the people back to the
[33:04] word
[33:05] not back to church
[33:08] back to the world
[33:10] millions going to church this sunday
[33:12] morning but that's not what we are
[33:14] talking about we are talking about where
[33:16] you want to line up with the word
[33:21] oh
[33:22] hallelujah cause the reason why the holy
[33:26] spirit will only vindicate the word
[33:30] it can't vindicate dogmas there is no
[33:32] life in them this is what we're standing
[33:35] for and that is what we believe but what
[33:37] did the word say
[33:38] hallelujah because god going to confirm
[33:41] his word so if you have your his word in
[33:43] you he will confirm you could we give
[33:46] the lord a shout
[33:47] so he said the church the real believer
[33:50] he's oh let me back up a little bit he
[33:52] said now some great theologian might
[33:53] come to the city that maybe had a lot of
[33:55] education could speak their words really
[33:56] good and plain and perhaps every church
[33:58] in the city would fully cooperate it
[34:00] would be a kind of honor to go out and
[34:01] hear the man which might be a marvelous
[34:04] speaker but that's not what the church
[34:07] is looking for
[34:09] the church isn't looking for marvelous
[34:11] speakers he said the church the real
[34:13] believer here we go it's looking for the
[34:15] manifestation of the holy spirit
[34:18] something moving in their heart
[34:20] oh glory to god not your head your heart
[34:22] isn't that right
[34:24] back to the word
[34:26] back to the principles that was laid out
[34:28] in the alpha church
[34:30] notice the purpose of god said in
[34:32] malachi 4 our elijah a 20th century
[34:35] prophet is to turn our hearts back
[34:38] to the faith of the fathers
[34:40] it's not just a modern thing will be
[34:42] modern times no they had something that
[34:44] we had to go and connect back with
[34:49] he didn't say god send you elijah to
[34:51] move you forward you can't move forward
[34:54] until you go backward and pick up what
[34:56] they had because they had the faith
[34:58] [Applause]
[35:01] and you need the faith to connect with
[35:03] the power
[35:04] and then the power and lead to the
[35:06] promise to manifest the promise
[35:09] oh could we give the lord some praises
[35:11] people
[35:17] you know we see that no fear come by
[35:19] what hearing the word therefore the word
[35:21] are to be preached and the word preached
[35:23] correctly rightly divided will bring
[35:26] faith to the people and the faith in the
[35:28] people will pull down what the power of
[35:30] the living god
[35:32] that's why you can drop the promise you
[35:35] shall receive
[35:37] power
[35:39] after the holy ghost come upon you
[35:46] glory
[35:48] so god sent the purpose of elijah was
[35:51] sent eternal hearts back to the fate of
[35:53] the fathers the fate the resurrection
[35:56] fate the original fate it will take
[35:58] faith based on forgiveness to receive
[36:00] the power that is promised
[36:02] faith is the leaders the power
[36:04] power is to take us to the promise to
[36:06] manifest the promise
[36:09] first thessalonians 4 16 the lord
[36:10] himself descends of heaven with a shout
[36:12] with the voice of the archangel are with
[36:15] the trump of god and the dead in christ
[36:17] shall rise first then we which are alive
[36:18] and remain shall be caught up together
[36:20] with them in the clouds to meet the lord
[36:21] in the air
[36:23] jesus
[36:24] does all three
[36:26] the shout
[36:27] the voice
[36:29] the trump
[36:30] jesus did the shout in true and by the
[36:33] prophet of malachi 4
[36:35] bringing the bread
[36:37] the word
[36:38] the message
[36:39] hallelujah jesus already did that
[36:43] hallelujah elias has already come
[36:45] and a message went out throughout the
[36:48] whole earth
[36:49] to get the seeds
[36:51] predestinated seats
[36:53] a dragnet was thrown out a big fishing
[36:56] net was thrown out an income to elect
[36:59] along with crabs snakes worms turtles
[37:03] and whatever else but amidst all of that
[37:06] there is an elect and the elect will not
[37:10] be deceived
[37:11] oh
[37:12] give the lord some praises people
[37:15] over here
[37:19] this shout message was sent out to get
[37:22] three kind of believers
[37:24] true believers
[37:25] amen make believers on unbelievers all
[37:28] got caught up in the net
[37:30] isn't that right here we go jesus
[37:35] did they shout in the prophet
[37:37] are you ready
[37:39] jesus
[37:41] is now doing the voice in the brain
[37:46] first
[37:48] to identify
[37:50] a fifo ministry
[37:53] divinely appointed
[37:55] to rightly divide the world
[37:59] this can only be done
[38:01] by the voice of the archangel
[38:04] this voice
[38:06] not the angel
[38:08] but the voice of the angel
[38:12] that voice will speak the word amen and
[38:16] remember the spirit
[38:18] the prophet and the pride will be saying
[38:21] the same thing amen
[38:23] oh glory
[38:25] from hebrews he said leaving let's go on
[38:27] to perfection oh my i wish i had the
[38:30] voice of an archangel now to bring this
[38:33] to a place where you could see it
[38:36] so in other words
[38:38] the voice of the archangel is to bring
[38:41] clarity
[38:42] of the vision
[38:44] that came even the prophetic vision
[38:48] and that's why habakkuk says write
[38:50] division
[38:52] and make it plain
[38:54] so the voice of the archangel is to
[38:56] bring it to a place where you could see
[38:59] what you are promised and no demon could
[39:03] rub you or cheat you out of what you are
[39:06] going after
[39:07] [Applause]
[39:12] i'll bring it down further
[39:14] if an earthquake
[39:16] hit trinidad and this church falls flat
[39:20] you supposed to have a vision
[39:22] in your soul
[39:23] as to what you going after if this place
[39:27] is divided up into 50 pieces and we
[39:30] cannot have church like we know church
[39:32] on your little piece of island you
[39:34] supposed to have a vision
[39:47] if you don't have that
[39:49] you may as well prepare your tribulation
[39:51] backpack
[39:59] how to survive this tribulation
[40:02] for three and a half years
[40:03] you gotta get a book in a manual called
[40:05] that now they get a backpack
[40:08] because this is what we're talking about
[40:09] this is real gospel
[40:12] this is going back to the days of the
[40:14] apostles yeah they were hiding in the
[40:16] upper room there wasn't out open just
[40:18] waving their hands no they were hiding
[40:20] for fear of the what was going on around
[40:22] they were hiding from the authorities
[40:25] waiting on their promise yes they were
[40:27] in tribulation time they were under
[40:29] pressure but they was on the promise
[40:32] under pressure and on the promise under
[40:35] pressure and on the promise under stress
[40:38] under pension on the bills to pay
[40:42] but on the promise all the same
[40:45] it is wonderful to be under a promise of
[40:48] god
[40:54] how how many in here know that they are
[40:56] under a promise of god
[40:58] [Applause]
[41:01] i am not talking about your failures and
[41:04] your shortcomings and your wickedness
[41:06] and your attitude i'm not talking about
[41:08] that i'm talking about a promise of god
[41:10] you didn't ask for the promise he gave
[41:14] the promise
[41:14] [Applause]
[41:17] he he didn't even
[41:21] i promise in the last days it shall come
[41:23] to pass i will pour out my spirit and
[41:26] don't
[41:31] [Applause]
[41:41] that's why
[41:42] albacore said
[41:43] the vision is from a point of time
[41:46] oh don't get worried
[41:47] don't get fed up don't get frustrated
[41:50] don't act yeah yeah
[41:52] don't act miserable don't lack that god
[41:54] is not in charge and god is under
[41:56] control he give a promise be satisfied
[41:59] but the promise of god and worship god
[42:04] for the testimony of jesus
[42:07] is the spirit of prophecy
[42:09] and if you take the book
[42:12] my god
[42:14] praise if you take the book and you eat
[42:16] the book you're gonna prophesy from the
[42:19] book
[42:19] [Applause]
[42:24] glory
[42:27] the book
[42:29] the book will empower you
[42:31] to prophesy
[42:33] some of you not eating a book
[42:35] i know
[42:36] because there's no bitterness in the
[42:37] belly
[42:39] the eating of the book have a result
[42:41] the eating of the book have an effect
[42:43] you don't eat the book and say eating
[42:45] nice
[42:48] it's honey in the mouth
[42:49] it's honey to talk about it it's hard to
[42:52] speak it it's only to share it it's
[42:55] honey to fellowship about it but when it
[42:57] go down in the belly when it got down to
[43:00] the part that got seeped
[43:02] when you have to stand and said no
[43:03] gossiping when you have to sign and say
[43:05] come on the phone with that foolishness
[43:08] when you have to stand and face those
[43:10] ministers to their face
[43:13] come on now
[43:15] your friends
[43:17] [Applause]
[43:20] when you have to take a stand with your
[43:22] family with your loved ones with your
[43:24] husband with your wife with your
[43:25] children with your neighbor with the
[43:27] pastor with the elder with a deacon with
[43:29] so-called bishop with poops and
[43:30] potentials and would-be apostles when
[43:32] you have to take his time with all of
[43:34] them it's peter in the belly
[43:36] but if john who typed the pride he took
[43:39] the book he eat the pork and it was
[43:42] sweet in the mouth it was spit in the
[43:44] belly and the voice said though must
[43:46] prophesy
[43:47] again
[43:49] and the spirit of prophecy is the
[43:51] testimony of jesus so when you prophesy
[43:54] under the spirit of prophecy it's the
[43:57] voice of the archangel
[43:59] anoint him to produce the testimony of
[44:02] jesus
[44:04] let them laugh
[44:05] but the testimony of jesus is
[44:08] prophesying
[44:09] that the word will be fulfilled
[44:12] in your life
[44:15] oh give the lord some praise people
[44:18] [Applause]
[44:22] hallelujah hallelujah
[44:24] oh glory
[44:25] praise god
[44:27] hallelujah
[44:29] blessed be the lord
[44:31] jesus told his disciples he that
[44:33] receiveth
[44:34] you
[44:35] receives me
[44:37] and he that receives me
[44:40] receive him that sent me
[44:42] and the prophet said in spoken word you
[44:44] can only serve god
[44:46] as you do and believe
[44:48] the servants that god sends
[44:51] you can only serve god on earth
[44:54] as god's servants that send on earth by
[44:57] divine
[44:59] inspiration
[45:00] interprets the word to you
[45:03] so in other words god going to have to
[45:05] raise up men
[45:06] that will have to correctly divide the
[45:08] world
[45:09] not by intellectual study and so forth
[45:12] but by divine watch that word divine
[45:15] divine means there is no
[45:17] uh facts about it there is no emails
[45:20] about it there is no discussion about it
[45:22] divine is just that divine
[45:25] divinely revealed
[45:28] inspired
[45:30] from heaven how many know their sons and
[45:33] daughters of god
[45:34] [Applause]
[45:36] how many know you have a father
[45:40] and if you want to talk to you he could
[45:42] talk to you
[45:43] he he don't have to talk to you talk to
[45:45] a pastor
[45:46] uh
[45:47] he don't have to talk to you to a bishop
[45:50] you don't need a priest for him to tell
[45:52] the priest something to tell you
[45:54] he reveals to whomsoever he will
[45:58] that that is enough to make a baptist
[46:00] shout out
[46:04] divinely
[46:05] reveal
[46:07] so the promise
[46:08] of the voice of the archangel is here
[46:11] in the form of the spirit of prophecy
[46:14] to prophesy from the open book
[46:18] two things happen before dynamics is
[46:20] poured out
[46:21] two main things
[46:23] luke 24 27 and beginning at moses
[46:26] on all the prophets he expounded unto
[46:29] them in all the scriptures
[46:32] the things
[46:33] concerning himself
[46:36] in other words jesus unlocked the word
[46:38] or opened the word or brought a turtle
[46:42] to reveal the word to his elect
[46:45] this was a private opening
[46:48] it wasn't on the mountain it wasn't with
[46:50] the five thousand with eaten bread eaten
[46:52] five thousand it wasn't with the seven
[46:54] thousand bred looking people
[46:56] it was private resurrection faith
[46:59] resurrection ministry the opening of the
[47:02] word to these elected people that was
[47:05] about to be have a promise because the
[47:08] vision had to be made plain to them as
[47:10] to what really unfolded
[47:13] from genesis come on home
[47:18] so the bible said begin at moses
[47:20] he began to break the scriptures to them
[47:23] and luke 24 45 then open he the
[47:26] understanding
[47:28] amen that they might understand the
[47:30] scriptures
[47:32] word open
[47:33] understanding open what's the sense god
[47:35] trying to show you something and you're
[47:37] blind first he open your eyes then he
[47:39] could say see
[47:41] oh hallelujah before the fish could swim
[47:44] he'd have to have sea to swim in
[47:46] so before god could bring to reveal to
[47:48] you you have to have the ability to
[47:50] receive
[47:52] a divine revelation
[47:55] and the pride the elect has the ability
[47:58] here we go to hear from god
[48:02] oh i want a bigger shout on that one
[48:05] i want to make a shout out on that one
[48:07] i want to make a shout on that one
[48:09] you don't have to wait for your husband
[48:12] you don't have to wait for your wife or
[48:14] the minister to elect us the ability to
[48:18] hear from god
[48:21] and once more
[48:24] the world will hear direct from god
[48:29] because the voice gonna be in a bride
[48:33] oh blessed be the lord
[48:35] hallelujah
[48:37] genesis 18 17 you may be seated and the
[48:41] lord said
[48:43] shall i hide from abraham
[48:45] the things which i do
[48:47] seeing that abraham shall surely become
[48:49] a mighty and great nation
[48:51] and all the nation of the earth shall be
[48:53] blessed in him
[48:54] for i know him
[48:56] and he will command his children
[48:58] and his household after him
[49:01] that they keep the way of the lord
[49:04] and to do justice
[49:06] and judgment

[49:10] that which was spoken to him

[49:37] judgment over sodom
[49:39] sodom was finished and didn't know it

[53:15] it has retained
[53:16] fleas coming off of rats and infecting
[53:19] people and they said the fleas are now
[53:21] resistant to spray
[53:24] so these are mutants fleas
[53:27] and what did the prophet said we are
[53:29] striving
[53:30] to enter
[53:32] the kingdom of god

[53:53] lamb's wife the angel having the plagues
[53:57] it is judgment about the strike the

[1:00:04] he never tell him who he was he just
[1:00:06] said it is written
[1:00:07] it is written
[1:00:09] it is written because the word is
[1:00:10] unveiled to me
[1:00:12] it's revealed to him so he knows every
[1:00:15] one of the devil's tricks
[1:00:17] that is the only way he could really
[1:00:19] overcome
[1:00:20] to recognize the devil at every one of
[1:00:23] his tricks his main trick in this age is
[1:00:26] to get you off the wood
[1:00:28] [Music]
[1:00:29] [Applause]
[1:00:34] not catching not to blame us
[1:00:37] no
[1:00:37] not that easy
[1:00:39] you know the devil is out there but it's
[1:00:41] to keep you in church and take you off
[1:00:42] the wood
[1:00:45] tell you you could hate somebody and say
[1:00:47] about hallelujah glory hello
[1:00:50] [Music]

[1:00:58] you're miserable in your own house and
[1:00:59] you're playing nice and church oh
[1:01:01] yeah
[1:01:02] you're off the word
[1:01:04] you have to die
[1:01:05] you have to humble yourself
[1:01:07] you know what homework has to defer you
[1:01:10] have to give in you have to subject
[1:01:12] yourself you have to be submissive
[1:01:15] to christ
[1:01:18] [Applause]
[1:01:35] i can't say i wish i was a teacher you
[1:01:37] know my fine teacher very easy boy
[1:01:40] he could just teach you word and he he
[1:01:42] does have a burden for
[1:01:44] for nothing
[1:01:45] just teach the mysteries and teach break
[1:01:47] it down
[1:01:50] and the poor pastor comes here trying to
[1:01:52] teach something and you've got a thing
[1:01:53] this year until you say i was telling
[1:01:55] somebody that's a secret that's why i
[1:01:56] don't know some people lining up in
[1:01:58] front of my office trying to see me
[1:01:59] a lot of answers are answered by the
[1:02:01] word
[1:02:02] i gotta help by doing the preaching and
[1:02:03] so on you get ministered to so there's
[1:02:05] no need to line up from my office i want
[1:02:07] to see you see you for what
[1:02:09] you really have to want to see me
[1:02:11] yeah i have something serious because i
[1:02:13] trying to deal with this stuff
[1:02:15] your stuff
[1:02:17] spirit pick up your stuff whatever your
[1:02:20] stuff they're going through their people
[1:02:21] get invited to our service here and then
[1:02:23] they get vex afterwards they say they
[1:02:24] push to invite them tell the pastor
[1:02:25] about them
[1:02:27] i personally know who they are but the
[1:02:29] spirit pick up their stuff and when the
[1:02:31] holy spirit deals with their stuff they
[1:02:33] get messed up who don't like it too much
[1:02:35] but i can't help that there's something
[1:02:36] moving here that angel
[1:02:39] angels drop down
[1:02:43] because you see it's not about me it's
[1:02:45] about you
[1:02:49] that's where a lot of these ministers
[1:02:50] get tied up they think it's about them
[1:02:52] and their ministry
[1:02:56] like it's a power building bodybuilding
[1:02:59] contest or something and they're trying
[1:03:01] to display the ministry and stuff god
[1:03:02] are they choosing that foolishness
[1:03:04] couldn't pray that flesh business one
[1:03:06] god wanted some dead men
[1:03:08] because listen the fightful ministry is
[1:03:10] for your perfection
[1:03:13] not for the minister's glorification
[1:03:16] i i am the bishop is that right of what
[1:03:20] [Applause]

[1:05:34] we are given an understanding by the
[1:05:36] word that we are going to understand it
[1:05:38] because there will come an efficient age
[1:05:40] to it

[1:09:09] that's why we're here this morning you
[1:09:11] know why i'm preaching this way is this
[1:09:12] blood
[1:09:13] i don't have no special something it's
[1:09:15] just blood
[1:09:16] blood dripping all over me when god look

[1:09:32] flow
[1:09:33] that makes me fight the snow no other
[1:09:35] fault i know
[1:09:37] nothing but the blood of jesus
[1:09:39] and once there is blood there is
[1:09:41] presence
[1:09:44] glory
[1:09:45] glory
[1:09:47] [Applause]
[1:09:49] that's what abel brought
[1:09:51] abram brought alarm
[1:09:53] everybody blood
[1:09:54] came by the flowers of his own
[1:09:56] understanding and interpretation but
[1:09:58] abram border blood
[1:10:00] offering a blood sacrifice confirming
[1:10:02] that something must die
[1:10:04] for us to live and we have to be
[1:10:06] grateful to god
[1:10:08] oh hallelujah praise god
[1:10:11] amen remember see then
[1:10:13] remember
[1:10:14] for mauritian booker symbols as daniel
[1:10:16] hear the seven thunders and utter their
[1:10:18] voices remember daniel grabbed the pen
[1:10:20] started to write and john heard the same
[1:10:22] thing
[1:10:23] watch but on the backs of the bible the
[1:10:26] revelation was shown to daniel and say
[1:10:28] that there are seven voices to be
[1:10:29] uttered that no man could open no man
[1:10:31] know what it was but the bible said and
[1:10:33] told daniel told john
[1:10:35] in these last days these seven voices
[1:10:38] will be made known by the real true
[1:10:42] church
[1:10:43] you get it you can see where the falls
[1:10:46] and counterfeit is trying to keep great
[1:10:48] men from places like that
[1:10:51] so therefore
[1:10:52] to you the elect
[1:10:54] what's about to come forth you are going
[1:10:56] to understand it
[1:10:58] it will not
[1:11:00] fly over the heads of god elect
[1:11:02] the thing of it is this
[1:11:04] god was so mysterious
[1:11:06] that the people couldn't understand him
[1:11:09] or comprehend he was just too mysterious
[1:11:11] by the jerome
[1:11:12] and he wanted
[1:11:15] to reveal himself
[1:11:17] so it pushed god to the point where he
[1:11:20] became one of us
[1:11:21] to be touched
[1:11:23] to be handled
[1:11:25] and john beautifully said it this way in
[1:11:27] the beginning was the word
[1:11:28] the word was with god
[1:11:30] the word was god and the word
[1:11:34] became flesh
[1:11:35] and dwelt among us
[1:11:37] so god made it so plain
[1:11:39] not even a fool should owe therein
[1:11:42] no you cannot
[1:11:44] separate in the church the natural from
[1:11:46] the spiritual
[1:11:47] because they were ordained to be
[1:11:49] together
[1:11:50] isn't that right
[1:11:51] in the church bad good
[1:11:54] renegade rebellious
[1:11:57] but the elected is the full known of god
[1:12:01] chosen from the foundation of the world
[1:12:03] and here we go are you ready and
[1:12:06] vindicated
[1:12:08] by the process
[1:12:09] that he god in his wisdom takes them
[1:12:11] through
[1:12:14] i want to hear beginning on that one
[1:12:16] the elected
[1:12:18] is the full known of god
[1:12:20] and they are vindicated by
[1:12:23] the process
[1:12:25] that god in his wisdom takes them
[1:12:27] through
[1:12:29] by their place of trying
[1:12:31] wilderness
[1:12:32] testings
[1:12:33] trials
[1:12:35] whatever else to prove to these sons and
[1:12:37] daughters that they are not like eve
[1:12:40] [Music]
[1:12:42] example pillow fire hangover brown is a
[1:12:44] baby
[1:12:47] somebody take a camera clicks
[1:12:51] looks good
[1:12:52] but that pillow fire over that baby is a
[1:12:54] sign
[1:12:55] that that is elected
[1:12:57] predestinated
[1:12:58] for ordained
[1:13:00] gift to the earth
[1:13:02] now
[1:13:03] let's talk process
[1:13:07] you see people like the lights
[1:13:09] they like the picture they like posing
[1:13:11] with engine and lights and rain monsters
[1:13:13] all that is fine but let's talk about
[1:13:15] process
[1:13:16] you see this is the point a young man
[1:13:18] want to drive a car you see people
[1:13:19] driving i want to drive too but there's
[1:13:21] a process you have to get a license you
[1:13:23] have to be tested on the road if you
[1:13:25] don't get that you are illegally driving
[1:13:27] your father's car
[1:13:31] people want to get big jobs but they
[1:13:33] don't want to get
[1:13:34] the big results and the papers of the
[1:13:36] exams
[1:13:37] but to go and get this big job you have
[1:13:38] to get some big qualifications to get
[1:13:40] the big qualification you got to get
[1:13:42] some big studies and you have to pass
[1:13:43] these big exams
[1:13:45] then you can get this big job
[1:13:48] it is called the process
[1:13:50] there's also something called the
[1:13:52] process of character
[1:13:55] [Applause]
[1:13:58] development of course
[1:14:00] of course preach people don't like to
[1:14:02] talk about that
[1:14:03] god i'm going to bless you god i'm going
[1:14:05] to bless you
[1:14:06] oh yeah
[1:14:09] i feel blessed to be stressed oh yeah
[1:14:11] all kind of catchphrases and stuff god
[1:14:13] i'm gonna do with that channel like them
[1:14:15] inventing in your own mind
[1:14:17] god say abraham you are blessed abraham
[1:14:19] say oh i bless i have no children
[1:14:22] go say plain rude come outside let me
[1:14:23] show you the stars start the count
[1:14:25] ibrahim i wrote all the numbers he said
[1:14:28] social you'll see me now go back and
[1:14:30] worship god
[1:14:36] i'm not only latino
[1:14:37] holy promise
[1:14:39] and he don't tell them how long they
[1:14:40] look for and abram didn't even know he's
[1:14:42] 25 years old and you know what i've ever
[1:14:43] said here this beauty he staggered
[1:14:47] at the promise of god
[1:14:49] true unbelief
[1:14:51] but was strong
[1:14:53] come on now strong
[1:15:00] let me hear you give a shout
[1:15:10] you don't be seated
[1:15:11] better of it are you saying that the
[1:15:13] stronger i get in faith is the more i
[1:15:15] will get in praise of course
[1:15:18] of course
[1:15:20] because the day god gave you a promise
[1:15:21] every day is closer to it
[1:15:24] the problem the problem is when you
[1:15:26] don't have a promise
[1:15:27] that is pressure
[1:15:29] hallelujah
[1:15:30] that is pressure when you go over
[1:15:32] promise when you promise delivering
[1:15:34] inferior time moses coming 400 years of
[1:15:36] people in bondage and their money
[1:15:38] passing general suggestion from deliver
[1:15:40] coming deliverer coming somebody saying
[1:15:42] i'm tired of that you have to hit it
[1:15:43] again it's prophecy delivery is coming
[1:15:47] listen to the testimony of jesus spirit
[1:15:48] of prophecy moses is coming somebody
[1:15:50] coming
[1:15:53] you're saying that it's small you're a
[1:15:55] long beard you all know it's still
[1:15:57] coming
[1:15:57] [Applause]
[1:16:01] well a hundred years passed you said
[1:16:03] that away 300
[1:16:04] more and after 150
[1:16:07] 250 150 more but what about when it's
[1:16:10] 375
[1:16:13] 280
[1:16:15] 295 five more years
[1:16:18] 391 399
[1:16:23] nine months
[1:16:28] baby moses born
[1:16:30] nine months
[1:16:32] and delivered not mature yet not ready
[1:16:33] to speak no flies yet
[1:16:35] be able to deliver in baby form
[1:16:38] be
[1:16:39] deliver in in seed form god love this
[1:16:42] seating you know when you want to whip
[1:16:44] up the enemy just throw a seed
[1:16:47] [Applause]
[1:16:50] that's why when he broke the seven seal
[1:16:52] silence
[1:16:56] silence
[1:16:58] but only for half an hour
[1:17:00] because god won't be silent for too long
[1:17:02] the silence has to be broken
[1:17:05] and when the seed is seated silent
[1:17:07] it's all locked up waiting for rain
[1:17:10] if i could only get rain
[1:17:12] the seed is dry
[1:17:14] but he promised lot of rain it's all
[1:17:16] come to pass i'll pour out
[1:17:18] pour oh
[1:17:21] [Applause]
[1:17:26] and the devil job is to make sure he put
[1:17:28] the umbrella over your seed
[1:17:30] [Music]
[1:17:35] don't let that rain
[1:17:37] touch
[1:17:38] don't let that water touch that you know
[1:17:40] because every time that water hits your
[1:17:42] seed you're gonna have to break up
[1:17:44] you're gonna have to cry
[1:17:46] you're gonna start the ball you'll start
[1:17:47] to groan
[1:17:49] all the shell around you will break out
[1:17:51] you cannot be the same
[1:17:53] when the water of his mercy
[1:17:55] water of his blessing the water of his
[1:17:58] spirit
[1:17:59] [Applause]
[1:18:03] balaam you
[1:18:05] let me praise you a little bit
[1:18:07] when you praise
[1:18:09] and worship
[1:18:10] you are actually watering the seed
[1:18:16] so the devil job is to kill your praise
[1:18:19] [Applause]
[1:18:23] why you think sin is so important to the
[1:18:25] devil
[1:18:26] not just for you to sin you know
[1:18:28] you may be seated let me just say this
[1:18:29] here
[1:18:32] the devil know
[1:18:34] you are sons and daughters
[1:18:36] he can't deny that right
[1:18:37] but he could make you lose your joy of
[1:18:39] salvation
[1:18:42] and he could cut you off from your
[1:18:43] access right because if you get your
[1:18:45] messed up it comes like you lose your
[1:18:48] channel
[1:18:49] to approach your god
[1:18:52] so his job is to trick you
[1:18:54] trap you mess you up but when you come
[1:18:56] you're heavy
[1:18:58] why are my people heavy
[1:19:00] heavy leading
[1:19:02] booting down
[1:19:03] say praise god your hand how to do so i
[1:19:05] give
[1:19:06] you gotta take exercise to reach it up
[1:19:07] like that
[1:19:08] yeah
[1:19:09] and get the swinging mode because it
[1:19:11] can't go up normally come on no you can
[1:19:13] make it you can you can make it up you
[1:19:15] can make it happen you're not sure how
[1:19:16] long it will stay up because you can
[1:19:18] make it up that's not what god wants
[1:19:20] that's that kind of stingy praise
[1:19:22] when jesus come on that donkey you know
[1:19:24] when kings come in they have healed out
[1:19:25] and whatnot kings kings kings with the
[1:19:27] crown and all the village and the whole
[1:19:30] city come out when jesus come on the
[1:19:31] donkey that was their king
[1:19:33] the bible said you king come lowly he
[1:19:36] had no crown on him but that was the
[1:19:37] king and and they began to trouble
[1:19:39] branches that you rolled the carpet
[1:19:42] they were all worked after all
[1:19:45] they didn't have catholic they had
[1:19:46] branches and they dropped the branches
[1:19:48] on jesus king moving slowly on that
[1:19:51] donkey the king coming lonely according
[1:19:55] to scriptures

[1:20:15] big trumpet song
[1:20:17] bringing all kind of confetties falling
[1:20:19] all right continue showing up
[1:20:21] but this king
[1:20:22] different king
[1:20:24] different king now
[1:20:25] he's the king of kings the lord of lords

[1:20:33] on sat no no
[1:20:35] jesus told him to find it
[1:20:39] not not any donkey

[1:20:43] no man sat on that one before this is
[1:20:46] king king
[1:20:48] this is kingdom king
[1:20:49] and where are we going

[1:21:16] the sense of empowerment
[1:21:18] when truth comes to you
[1:21:21] you could feel truth
[1:21:23] you could connect with truth you can't
[1:21:26] even explain anything and they they
[1:21:28] follow jesus and i mean they couldn't
[1:21:30] understand everything he's saying but he

[1:27:17] spirit he said broke his arms
[1:27:19] one arm
[1:27:20] and he said how he bandages up he said

[1:27:24] know what i'm going to do tell him
[1:27:25] dustin i'll break both arms the weak one
[1:27:27] and the strong one
[1:27:28] that this sword will follow his hands he
[1:27:31] said i will put my sword in the hands of
[1:27:33] the king of babylon and he was stretched
[1:27:34] over the land of egypt
[1:27:37] you know why god told egypt how can i
[1:27:39] like you like a tree like a big bow
[1:27:42] one might the river you're so tall all
[1:27:44] the other trees envy you but because you
[1:27:46] get puffed up thinking because you're so
[1:27:48] tall and the others you are somebody
[1:27:50] and ghost i'm gonna cut you down because
[1:27:52] i made you beautiful
[1:27:54] god said i made you beautiful i put you
[1:27:57] by the river that is why you're so tall
[1:27:59] that is why you're so blessed stop
[1:28:02] complaining
[1:28:08] you see you can understand why am i
[1:28:10] going here you can understand why but
[1:28:12] imam says god looking for somebody the
[1:28:14] more he blesses is the more humble they
[1:28:17] become
[1:28:18] most of the time when people get blessed
[1:28:20] to get puffed up but god looking for a
[1:28:22] humble heart that was your humble heart
[1:28:23] i would not despise
[1:28:25] find me somebody that want to be nobody
[1:28:27] find me somebody that wanted me nothing
[1:28:30] find me somebody that want to come out
[1:28:31] of the way that god could be glorified
[1:28:37] [Applause]
[1:28:42] are we going to answer the question why
[1:28:43] would god choose a brightness evil age
[1:28:46] answer to try her
[1:28:48] [Music]
[1:28:51] i thought i heard a bigger than that i'm
[1:28:53] not begging for him and said the amends
[1:28:58] i am different
[1:29:00] i'll preach whether you say amen or not
[1:29:02] by just letting you know how your amen
[1:29:04] sung in god have a meeker up here
[1:29:07] temperature
[1:29:08] so there's no when i hit in this spot
[1:29:10] so if i got hit in it i will know i'm
[1:29:12] like a doctor then
[1:29:14] open them out
[1:29:16] and then read the temperature
[1:29:19] we call it the amen temperature
[1:29:22] temperature of which you confirm the
[1:29:23] word
[1:29:24] because when you say a man you say that
[1:29:26] that that's mine
[1:29:27] am i mean so be it to me i want it
[1:29:33] got something something so anointed
[1:29:36] something killing beer something getting
[1:29:38] lying something like anything beat them
[1:29:39] for instance
[1:29:41] one time they catch them in a city and
[1:29:42] they close the gate
[1:29:44] lock the gate up and say we have him now
[1:29:46] so i can take the gate and he posts
[1:29:48] i'm over with it
[1:29:51] not just the gate you know i like that
[1:29:52] baguette and post
[1:29:54] that means they kind of hung up a gate
[1:29:55] now they'll post hang it upon
[1:29:57] not to build pause and then pop gate
[1:29:59] something they bought because the spirit
[1:30:02] come upon him
[1:30:05] i went house and feel that anointed when
[1:30:07] the spirit of the lord comes upon my
[1:30:09] heart i could run to a troop i could
[1:30:12] leap i could walk on the water when the
[1:30:14] spirit of the lord comes upon my heart
[1:30:18] some of your husbands need the spirit of
[1:30:20] the lord you're too dead in your house
[1:30:23] you need the spirit of the lord
[1:30:28] alex you need to be inspired
[1:30:31] that's a problem
[1:30:32] some of you are not inspired
[1:30:35] me to inspire
[1:30:37] inspire husbands inspired fathers
[1:30:40] inspired mothers inspired wives
[1:30:43] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:30:45] oh glory to god people people packing
[1:30:48] their own inspiration
[1:30:50] and they figure that is god
[1:30:51] lord show me the old question to me
[1:30:54] yeah but in the big broad scope is it
[1:30:56] really god or if it's you cloudy with
[1:30:58] your own mind and thoughts and ideas we
[1:31:00] need to be free good jesus was free you
[1:31:02] know
[1:31:03] this didn't work up i like that
[1:31:06] and that is that is the joy of being
[1:31:07] authentic
[1:31:09] i find it's hard to be not yourself
[1:31:12] it's a difficult thing to impersonate
[1:31:13] you know
[1:31:15] you know he come and say hello you gotta
[1:31:16] do so and this one like blue so you wear
[1:31:18] a blue hat
[1:31:19] and when you're beating this one she's
[1:31:21] like pink so you switch your blue hair
[1:31:22] to pop a pink hat because they're what
[1:31:23] you like and you don't want to get vexed

[1:32:55] liberty i love to see people empowered
[1:32:57] yes i love this people are inspired
[1:33:00] [Music]
[1:33:01] there's some people are inspired cooks
[1:33:03] they could just take anything and make
[1:33:05] up a meal oh this just right
[1:33:07] and there's some people not so very
[1:33:08] inspired in the cooking area we're not
[1:33:10] going to touch that
[1:33:13] there's people are inspired musicians
[1:33:16] just touch the key and they know
[1:33:18] they're inspired touch the board touch
[1:33:20] the getter they're inspired there are
[1:33:22] some people who are inspired singers so
[1:33:24] as to hold the microphone and start you
[1:33:26] know there's a gift behind it
[1:33:28] there's some who
[1:33:29] they're better in poetry but they make a
[1:33:31] good effort
[1:33:34] but they try their very best
[1:33:37] but they are people that are inspired
[1:33:39] and so in in whatever there's an
[1:33:42] inspiration that connects to your life
[1:33:45] and in that anointing there's a faith
[1:33:48] that nobody could change and replace
[1:33:52] and that's why jesus ah his faith was
[1:33:55] based upon who he was
[1:33:57] not the anointing upon him and that's
[1:34:00] perfect faith when you come one with the
[1:34:02] inside when you're one with god one with
[1:34:05] the word
[1:34:07] when there's no conflict within you
[1:34:12] and your words are true and genuine
[1:34:14] you're not in hypocrisy you're not
[1:34:16] saying one thing with your lips and
[1:34:17] thinking one another god bless you and
[1:34:19] your mind saying i hate you if i could
[1:34:21] let you have it i'll let you have it but
[1:34:22] god bless you
[1:34:29] you're hearing about me and people
[1:34:30] houses and they may always breaking
[1:34:32] dishes they're always slipping out
[1:34:34] they made mad as hell
[1:34:37] and that's why i keep slipping out
[1:34:39] like that that's what automatically
[1:34:41] happened every time they watch
[1:34:43] something something breaking
[1:34:45] and they don't know why it's slippery it
[1:34:47] slipped out the slipper but he paid too
[1:34:49] small
[1:34:52] if they increased the pay i saw nothing
[1:34:53] i could break after that
[1:34:55] but the master mean
[1:34:58] so it lives out
[1:35:00] babies as a man thinking his heart two
[1:35:02] years
[1:35:03] it's what's inside of here your head's
[1:35:05] saying one thing heart seeing something
[1:35:06] just have to connect there's no
[1:35:08] disagreement then you're authentic

[1:39:55] i'm trying to figure out how you're
[1:39:56] going to survive three and a half years
[1:39:58] you can't buy or sell except you take
[1:40:00] the mark
[1:40:01] of the beast
[1:40:03] and you know
[1:40:04] if you take the mark of the beast that's
[1:40:05] it
[1:40:06] oh hallelujah all dwell in the earth
[1:40:08] worshiping
[1:40:09] oh hallelujah everything is set you know
[1:40:11] the bombs are already set listen when
[1:40:13] they invented slingshot
[1:40:15] they use it bow and arrow they use it
[1:40:18] one bullet gun stuff it boom
[1:40:21] they use it one bullet at a time
[1:40:23] cannon fire
[1:40:26] boom they use it
[1:40:28] every weapon man made he has used it
[1:40:32] man you should see the kind of weapons
[1:40:33] that russia have and missile and bomb
[1:40:36] could destroy so much
[1:40:38] and they only belong more and improving
[1:40:41] now they have one that if it glyph off
[1:40:43] it it's selling six dummies
[1:40:46] and one is immediate one
[1:40:47] so you try to shoot it down you don't
[1:40:48] know which one you're shooting them
[1:40:52] that is how keen children reach very
[1:40:53] smart very intelligent we can't fight up
[1:40:56] with key insurance
[1:40:57] you can study how to make an underground
[1:40:59] bunker to protect you from these guys
[1:41:01] out there
[1:41:02] it makes no sense
[1:41:04] i'm not looking for on the bank
[1:41:06] i'm looking to go on the rapture
[1:41:08] and i know it will take rapture and
[1:41:11] faith
[1:41:11] i know it will take the life of jesus so
[1:41:14] theo have to die
[1:41:18] i'm not hearing you
[1:41:20] we have to die
[1:41:23] no excuse
[1:41:25] this have to live
[1:41:26] [Applause]
[1:41:30] and if god put your wife like moses on
[1:41:32] to be hot tempered that you could get
[1:41:34] tempers
[1:41:36] patience
[1:41:38] godliness are you any scissors anymore
[1:41:40] any brother's not saying anymore
[1:41:42] i hope that another confirmation that
[1:41:43] you know
[1:41:46] but but i'm talking about
[1:41:48] so i'm talking about whatever god put
[1:41:51] in order to hone your life
[1:41:54] for
[1:41:55] for to get his character
[1:41:57] and his nature because you see
[1:41:59] correcting as a gift that's why giving
[1:42:01] your children money doesn't help them it
[1:42:03] will just spend giving them car hall
[1:42:05] what not until you help them help them
[1:42:07] it's not helping them they have to go
[1:42:09] through
[1:42:10] that's why they get all the human
[1:42:11] because you're feeling sorry for them
[1:42:14] that is not god sarian
[1:42:16] that's not god's compassion
[1:42:18] god's compassion is doing the will of
[1:42:20] god sometimes they have to pain
[1:42:22] sometimes they have to strain you crack
[1:42:24] the egg of the chicken you will kill it
[1:42:27] you could smother your children with the
[1:42:28] wrong kind of a love
[1:42:30] hug them so tight they lose their breath
[1:42:32] and they die right in your arms because
[1:42:34] they love them so much
[1:42:38] that is not love
[1:42:40] that's foolishness actually
[1:42:43] because our example is not
[1:42:45] our appearance our example is god
[1:42:49] [Applause]
[1:42:51] the bible says love your wife as christ
[1:42:53] love your church not as your father love
[1:42:55] your mother okay if i didn't know
[1:42:56] everybody know they trouble
[1:42:58] so not using that as the example using
[1:43:00] the word as the example as christ loved
[1:43:03] the church so odd men to love their
[1:43:05] wives
[1:43:06] so what you have no excuse
[1:43:09] well i come to this and i come to that
[1:43:10] look at the bible
[1:43:12] look at the word that's how we're coming
[1:43:14] back to the word as christ loved the
[1:43:17] church and give himself for it
[1:43:20] [Applause]
[1:43:22] so mister you have to step up
[1:43:24] [Applause]
[1:43:27] and take responsibility
[1:43:30] oh my lord
[1:43:32] hallelujah where
[1:43:35] because we came from taught the flesh
[1:43:38] and bypass or tiopony
[1:43:41] we are here to reconnect
[1:43:43] to our theophany by way of the word
[1:43:46] do you believe that
[1:43:48] the seed
[1:43:50] the thought that we are in god could now
[1:43:53] be expressed because the word is sort of
[1:43:55] expressed
[1:43:56] and therefore by the word
[1:43:59] the forming of the word image this word
[1:44:01] back to the word the unveiling of god
[1:44:04] the word
[1:44:05] the revealing of the son of man was
[1:44:06] revealed in the word
[1:44:08] the land the promises
[1:44:09] these promises are the word the word
[1:44:12] is coming to you
[1:44:14] by way of the third pull
[1:44:17] which is the opening of the word the
[1:44:20] word truly have to open to you
[1:44:23] that you as an individual bride member
[1:44:27] could see your promises and your
[1:44:28] inheritance
[1:44:30] you've got to see it
[1:44:31] you have to go beyond salvation it's not
[1:44:33] good just to be saved
[1:44:35] you must want your inheritance because
[1:44:38] that is what jesus died for adam lost
[1:44:40] the book
[1:44:42] jesus died to pay the price to get back
[1:44:44] to book revelation 10 to book him on the
[1:44:46] earth version 10 8 the voice said take
[1:44:49] the book and eat it before there is a
[1:44:51] further manifestation that got to be the
[1:44:54] spirit of prophecy
[1:44:57] hallelujah
[1:44:59] and the prophecy must be upon you
[1:45:01] how could you prophesy over your own
[1:45:03] life and act negative
[1:45:06] how could you prophesy over your wife
[1:45:08] and don't have the expectation for the
[1:45:09] fulfillment in her life
[1:45:12] jesus
[1:45:13] when the report came man said lord my
[1:45:15] daughter is sick
[1:45:16] somebody come and say forget about it
[1:45:18] don't ask him again she's dead
[1:45:19] he said i go wake her
[1:45:23] hallelujah
[1:45:24] she wasn't awoke right away

[1:45:46] for that he was the world

[1:49:31] rock confession divine revelation and
[1:49:34] when you are cut out by divine

[1:50:01] marital issues family issues is to be
[1:50:03] settled by the word
[1:50:05] not by emotions feelings what you think
[1:50:08] but what does the word speak about the
[1:50:09] matter oh blessed be the name

[1:50:17] hallelujah can you take a little more
[1:50:24] daniel 8 15 and it came to pass that i
[1:50:26] even daniels had seen the vision
[1:50:29] and sought for the meaning
[1:50:31] and behold they stood before me
[1:50:34] the appearance of a man
[1:50:36] and i heard a man's voice between the
[1:50:38] banks of ulai which called and said
[1:50:39] gabriel
[1:50:41] make this man to understand the vision
[1:50:44] so he came near where i stood or when he
[1:50:47] came i was afraid and fell upon my face
[1:50:50] but he said unto me
[1:50:52] understand o son of man for at the time
[1:50:56] of the end
[1:50:57] shall
[1:50:58] be
[1:50:59] division
[1:51:01] daniel 9 20
[1:51:02] and while i was speaking and praying and
[1:51:04] confessing my sin
[1:51:06] and the sin of my people israel
[1:51:08] and presented my supplication before the
[1:51:10] lord my god for the holy mountain of my
[1:51:12] god yeah while i was speaking in prayer
[1:51:15] even the man gabriel whom i've seen in
[1:51:17] the vision at the beginning being caused
[1:51:19] to fly swiftly touched me about a time
[1:51:21] of the even oblation
[1:51:23] and he informed me
[1:51:25] and talked with me and said oh daniel
[1:51:27] i am now come
[1:51:29] forth to give these skill
[1:51:31] and
[1:51:32] understanding at the beginning of i
[1:51:34] suffocation the commandment came forth
[1:51:38] and i come to show thee for our greater
[1:51:40] beloved
[1:51:41] therefore understand the matter
[1:51:43] and consider the vision
[1:51:45] seventy weeks i determine upon thy
[1:51:47] people
[1:51:48] and upon thy holy city to finish the
[1:51:50] transgression
[1:51:52] to make up end of sins to make
[1:51:54] reconciliation for iniquity
[1:51:56] to bring in everlasting righteousness
[1:51:58] and this is the power i wanna get up
[1:51:59] here and to seal up the vision and
[1:52:03] prophecy
[1:52:04] and to anoint
[1:52:06] the most holy
[1:52:08] now but abraham and the sinful purpose
[1:52:09] of gabriel
[1:52:10] he was highlighting that part to seal up
[1:52:12] the vision and prophecy because the
[1:52:15] vision and prophecy was sealed
[1:52:17] but we have promised that that vision
[1:52:20] will be unsealed
[1:52:22] isn't that right because god told us to
[1:52:24] danielle go ahead danielle the book is
[1:52:25] sealed
[1:52:26] till the time of the end
[1:52:28] daniel 12 michael shall stand up the
[1:52:31] great prince notice
[1:52:33] watch and many of them that sleep in the
[1:52:36] dust of the eagle shall awake something
[1:52:37] everlasting life some to everlasting
[1:52:39] shame and contempt and those that turn
[1:52:41] away
[1:52:42] turn to many to righteousness as a
[1:52:43] stance forever but daniel
[1:52:47] o'donnell showed the words
[1:52:49] sealed the book even to the time of the
[1:52:51] end what is it
[1:52:52] do you see it class
[1:52:54] here we go
[1:52:55] this
[1:52:55] revelation of jesus christ and of his
[1:52:58] power there we go of his coming
[1:53:01] of the end time
[1:53:03] was sealed up
[1:53:05] until this time
[1:53:07] that is what he come to do
[1:53:09] it's hid from the scholars seal it up
[1:53:12] until the time of the end close up the
[1:53:14] words what did he do
[1:53:16] to seal up the vision and prophecy
[1:53:19] daniel
[1:53:20] had prophesied these things
[1:53:22] he saw it in a vision and the angel came
[1:53:25] down
[1:53:26] to seal the vision
[1:53:28] and to seal the prophecy
[1:53:31] that they can read it
[1:53:32] but cannot understand it until the end
[1:53:35] time
[1:53:36] oh could be here getting bigger
[1:53:39] what is the end time the end of the
[1:53:41] century week when the prince the
[1:53:43] antichrist will be revealed making
[1:53:45] himself god
[1:53:46] oh hallelujah so in other words this on
[1:53:50] ceiling the time is now
[1:53:53] but when the seven seal broke something
[1:53:55] was hidden under there you know what was
[1:53:57] under there you on the deal
[1:53:59] you were sealed on the deer
[1:54:01] you were hidden on the deer
[1:54:03] so therefore unsealing the vision and
[1:54:06] prophecy also means unsealing you
[1:54:09] oh glory to god
[1:54:11] to bring you out
[1:54:13] into a manifestation
[1:54:15] oh hallelujah as many as receive him to
[1:54:19] them give the power to become the sons
[1:54:22] of god
[1:54:26] so we're not coming back our sons
[1:54:28] saved
[1:54:29] sons salvation no
[1:54:32] our sonship is romans 8 the whole
[1:54:34] creation is groaning for the
[1:54:36] manifestation of the sons of god
[1:54:39] this is how adam was before the fall
[1:54:42] that means the book have to come back on
[1:54:44] the earth
[1:54:46] and the book came back
[1:54:48] god gave it to the prophet
[1:54:50] mighty angel
[1:54:52] seven thunders out in their voices
[1:54:57] oh hallelujah
[1:54:59] oh my
[1:55:00] god oh glory to god amen
[1:55:03] i'm saying if this is the third pearl
[1:55:04] then there's a great ministry line ahead
[1:55:07] first little birds
[1:55:09] then bigger birds
[1:55:10] than angels oh blessed be the name of
[1:55:13] the lord remember satan will try to
[1:55:15] impersonate he will try to impersonate
[1:55:17] everything that the church will do we
[1:55:19] notice through the antichrist but this
[1:55:20] is one thing he cannot impersonate
[1:55:22] there'll be no mimics to it there is no
[1:55:24] way for him to know it it's the third
[1:55:26] pull he knows nothing about it he says i
[1:55:29] want to consecrate my life anew across
[1:55:32] here this morning
[1:55:33] oh hallelujah then he said after
[1:55:35] bringing this indictment against my
[1:55:36] clitoris and friends out there and i
[1:55:38] have to say these things lord i did it
[1:55:40] by inspiration and he's praying i feel
[1:55:42] that you told me to do it now it's off
[1:55:44] my shoulder lord i'm glad it's off let
[1:55:46] them do whatever they will father i pray
[1:55:49] that they'll accept it i pray you will
[1:55:50] save them everyone lord hear this prayer
[1:55:53] media comfort a revival of the just
[1:55:57] and great power come among the church
[1:56:00] just before it is going

[1:56:05] pray that because you promise it
[1:56:08] and we are looking lord for that third
[1:56:10] pull that we know will do great things
[1:56:12] in ormonds
[1:56:14] oh hallelujah
[1:56:16] hallelujah
[1:56:18] the prophet went on to say there are
[1:56:20] people with bulldog faith they could
[1:56:21] claim whatever and get it but there are
[1:56:23] people who weaken faith he said that's
[1:56:24] who the temple is for
[1:56:26] oh glory to god that you could speak and
[1:56:28] see it materialize oh could we give the
[1:56:31] lord some praise as people

[1:56:39] together if we want to see that pull
[1:56:42] really do something for god
[1:56:44] it's a coordination every one of us and
[1:56:46] that's why we have to get into action
[1:56:48] hallelujah if the vision strikes you you
[1:56:50] must get into action you can't come back

[1:57:17] the eternal lost
[1:57:18] because of what jesus did
[1:57:20] when he died he went down and preached
[1:57:23] to those who were in prison
[1:57:24] those who heard it in noah's day and
[1:57:26] didn't receive it this souls had to be
[1:57:28] preached to and i'm not going to read it
[1:57:30] but the bride will have a ministry to
[1:57:32] preach to people who cannot be saved
[1:57:36] they have to hear the word
[1:57:39] even with signs wonders and miracles and
[1:57:41] they can't touch it
[1:57:43] what a horrible time
[1:57:44] that's going to be
[1:57:46] declaring the day of vengeance of our
[1:57:47] god

[1:58:58] life because all of them heard the word
