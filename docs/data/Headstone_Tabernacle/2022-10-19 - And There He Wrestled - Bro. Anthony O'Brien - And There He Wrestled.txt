atmosphere uh amen it's the people that bring the Revival amen praise God so we we thank God for that that God has a people in the land amen who under their Messenger will be the final voice to the final age amen that's the prophecy and we're walking into that now amen by faith so God bless you all tonight in a special way really appreciate you God bless you amen good to have you pass here tonight God bless amen we're so we're still feasting off a Sunday amen a high Ambitions amen amen really tremendously man so we thank God for all things and well praise God real food I do we just want to turn over now to the scripture God bless you and thank you so much one more time thank you so much amen for the music tonight and uh praise God so as you get into the scripture I have a thought tonight we want to share by the grace of God Genesis chapter 32 and we want to read from verse 24 from verse 24 here it's just here amen all right Genesis 32 and verse 24 and we also want to find for our markers in Luke 16. and verse 16 okay amen Genesis 32 and chapter 24 getting into this story we know about Jacob and this is kind of what we want to draw context tonight amen Genesis 32 24 says and Jacob was left alone and there Wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his time and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with hymns all of this is happening in the moment amen Nextbook says now he said let me go for the day breakth and he said I will not let thee go except thou bless me and he said unto him what is thy name and he said Jacob and he said thy name shall be called No More Jacob but Israel for us a prince has doubt power with God and with men and has prevailed amen uh one one second here please go on and has prevailed amen and Jacob asked him and he said tell me I pray thee thy name and he said wherefore is it that thou Dost ask after my name and he blessed him there and Jacob called the name of the place penile for I have seen God face to face on my life is preserved amen remember he was faint for his life but he got a blessing there and his life was preserved amen what a blessing amen I want that kind of blessing tonight amen my life is preserved amen hallelujah it's not right oh wonderful right so Saint Luke 16 now 16 and verse 16 just one was there we want to read amen and then ask God's blessings upon a little thought here tonight by the grace of God Saint Luke 16 from verse 16. says the law and the prophets were until John since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man press it into it got a blessing to the reading of his word let's just bow our heads forward to pray almighty God we thank you for your blessings tonight Lord we thank you for your call Upon Our Lives father Lord It's a privilege to walk in this way Lord Lord not Lord not many there be that find it Lord but we thank you for your love Upon Us Lord Lord that you could help us to see in this last hour so father we pray that your lord as we've just read your scriptures Lord we pray your holy spirit will just come for a few moments Lord while we wait and talk about you Lord we pray that your presence would come and just anoint these scriptures we I have here tonight this little thought to share their God lord you know what you place upon my heart but I pray Lord that I say deliver it up to you now father that you prayed you multiply it alone make it a something Lord a minister and father to your people here tonight Lord that we could see something in your word Lord that would Inspire us Lord Inspire us to pray Inspire us to motivate us to be better Christians Lord to press the battle award Phantom to keep on keeping one father because there's a promise of the road amen and may your promise Lord that in your time and season you would fulfill it so bless your people tonight as we labor in the scripture tonight take me out of the way and hide me behind your cross Lord and just bless your people tonight in a special way we pray and ask it in Jesus name amen and amen you have your seats tonight glory to God hallelujah amen wonderful amen glory praise God okay God bless you tonight so I have a title amen short and sweet and there he wrestled amen that's my title tonight and there he wrestled amen that's my title amen so it speaks about a few things there it's just a short uh phrase but there's a few things in there and there he wrestled there talking about a place praise God there's a place where you meet with God amen and that that he is a subject and we're praying tonight that each one of us could find amen that place where we could go to wrestling amen wrestling with who wrestling with uh uh uh with God isn't that right wrestling with that angel for the promise that he he gave isn't that wrong amen and rap that wrestle there is a verb as we know amen and uh I'm going to read a definition here to wrestle it means to engage to engage in a much engage in a boat or a form in wrestling it is to wrestle with is Narayan another word for another way for it says to move or to maneuver wrestling means to force with difficulty praise God isn't that right and one of these interesting things about the word wrestle and as I was studying it I realized that wrestling does not ensure victory it's a struggle that they're talking about amen it's not guaranteed for you to win it's a wrestle it's a power versus another Power it's a force versus another force and who will win depends on who is more desperate than who it's more who is more determined than who that is who's going to win the wrestling match isn't that right that's what wrestle means amen and as we study this this story about Jacob and how he had come down to his defining moment he had sent everything away his wives and his children and all that he had and the Bible said he was left found alone oh and how we need to be found alone sometimes praise alone for all the cares of this life separated from everything that we think is so important that we think is so amen so so like like a pedestal like so valuable but God wants to get us alone tonight it's got us separated from the world separated from our thoughts separated from our cares separated from our ideas and get us locked into a channel where he could speak to you oh Gloria got in their rights no wonder the prophet used to go up into the mountains go up into the high places away from the noise away from the traffic away from the horns beeping away from the voices of other people why so he could hear the voice of God oh to hear something speak to him oh safe to speak to something and let somebody speak back to him or to have that communion he needed to separate himself and tonight that's what we come to do we come to separate ourselves from all unbelief and get locked into a channel where we know the promises of God are going to come to pass he promised the Holy Ghost he promised a failure he promises Celia he promised to anoint you that promise will not fail but it's your faith in his promised word that will bring it to pass nothing wrong with the promise it's how much you can reach out for it or that's how it's gonna be affected to you and tonight we come to wrestle oh to wrestle and to overcome to wrestle and to be victorious oh somebody say Amen tonight Hallelujah Oh Glory hallelujah amen and that's just the way it's set up in the world and since the fall of Man wouldn't go over that but we know how it developed from there into this present time and the world is designed that way in every Avenue of Life there is some form of struggle for survival man found himself in a dangerous place and they found it it's not right oh then the Wilderness fighting up with the Lions and the Tigers and the Bears it isn't that right he is in danger amen he's in a place where he has no control in the Garden of Eden he had power over this power over that but here man found himself in a place of danger constantly constantly fighting constantly hiding in tens and caves constantly making fire constantly cutting Spears from wood to defend himself why because he found himself in a great uh uh uh jungle praise God obtained us from all around it's not right and even in today's modern world even though things have become so civilized still there's a struggle there's a struggle to survive there's a struggle to make ends meet there's a struggle to wake up there's a struggle to step out there's a struggle to go to school struggle to get dedication struggle to pay your bills struggle to fight every day or wrestling every day you're struggling that's how life is designed foreign and God knew it would come like that but he purposely allowed it to come that way so that you could prove yourself in this age to be the bride you say you are then come on and struggle come on and fight because in that atmosphere in that environment is when what inside of you really comes out oh hallelujah hallelujah when it's ease and Zion you don't know what's in there everything looking the same but when you turn it over on his head when you turn it upside down oh and then you see what's really going on then it becomes a fight for Survivor then it becomes a struggle for life oh Hallelujah will bring situations within circumstances into your home into your marriage into your garage wherever you have to bring it he will bring it so that you could fight and struggle and wrestle and wrestle wrestle with your thoughts wrestle with your mind wrestle with your Hallelujah with your condition wrestle with your situation what are we fighting for we're fighting to overcome we fight understand we're fighting to press every foot we put forward is another foot closer another step closer I'm not away for Hallelujah into a promise that's what we're here to do tonight hallelujah oh do you believe it do you believe it Hallelujah and they wrestled oh we gotta find a place tonight I don't know where to be Jesus said drop here drop your job drop your curtain and go into your prayer closet oh Hallelujah and wrestle with God in there oh he don't overcome it while I grant to sit at him in my Throne oh Hallelujah it is to him that overcome it that is who will kept the victory oh Hallelujah but if if you're willing to fight if you're willing to wrestle if you're willing to battle if you're willing to grit to grind to scrape to scream to cry to crawl until you receive the baptism of the Holy Cross what are you willing to do what are you willing to sacrifice what are you willing to give up yeah Hallelujah and we'll see I hope by the grace of God we'll see as we go through these stories in the Bible that it come at Great personal sacrifice and if I could use that as a theme tonight almost with this message great personal sacrifice Jacob lost his leg in this fight what are you willing to give up tonight he couldn't walk with his swagger like he used to he couldn't walk with his punks unless he could walk with a rock like this young boy Rock like he used to he lost the whole of his tie in this battle he was willing to give up something but when he got up from there he was Victorious and that's how I want to be tonight oh if I lose my leg that's all right oh I wanna have a pitbull look on God's promise I want to have a pit bull to our luck on God's people and Promises tonight he promised the Holy Ghost that's mine he promised to deliver me it's mine he promised my freedom is mine he promised to break me out I've got a pit bull lock on it oh you can saw my arm off I'm still holding on if you cut my leg off I'm still holding on oh I'm still staying strong oh Hallelujah amen [Applause] determination a crit that's what it takes to wrestle now I have an interesting read here from Arabic now this is interesting here now he put an article called wrestling with God and this Rabbi is a teacher in the Jewish community and the Jews as we know very connected with Jacob and the story because in this story his name is changed to Israel and this is the Jews birthmark isn't that right this is the the whole thing here you see so here's what he says listen this real I just pull the X up out here just to bring a context from a Jewish conceptual or understanding of this wrestle because it's very important today listen to this he said traditional texts sometimes identify us Jews as benign or the children of Jacob and he said but but the name that the Torah and the Torah and that we ourselves use much more often Israel which is the children of Israel you see he says so Jacob becomes Israel however only after he wrestles with the angel then he changes from Jacob to Israel he says so this is here so in order to be an authentic Israelite he said we too must wrestle with God so the rabbi is saying basically how Israelites identified how Jews identify themselves with God is through the same story of Jacob where his name is changed from Jacob to Israel and he is basically saying in order for you to be an authentic which means real which means a genuine Israelite you too must wrestle with god oh if our fathers wrestled in the wilderness they say we too must also wrestle in order to belong oh how to wrestle to enter in and I say tonight if you want to call yourself a Christian you want to call yourself a Believer and you don't want to fight come on you have to wrestle too there's something you got to do you got to be willing to lay your life on the line for this birthrights you've got to be willing to cast it all aside for this birth rights for This Promise of God for this promise of the Holy Ghost for This Promise of the Rapture for this promise of the quickening power for This Promise of the Dynamics to the mechanics you've got to wrestle tonight in order for you to overcome oh oh you gotta make up your mind oh to wrestle to fight to press the battle it's not right and that's why Saint Luke 16 brings that into context for us because since that time the gospel has been preached and every man pressed their way into it if God forced you to wrestle God will force you also to wrestle to get down on your knees and begin to cry and ask for God to give you the Holy Ghost the burn burn Holy Ghost burning your soul put on all the lusts but on all our lives but not all the filths burn out everything inside of you oh and I don't want to come out fire is coming fire is coming fire is coming to burn to burn out the demons to burn out the lust and the lies and the filth God hallelujah it's gonna force the issue so that you struggle and that you fight until you win oh can I get an amen can I get a Hallelujah [Music] Glory you don't fight till you're tired if I tell it you feel like giving up you fight until you win regardless of what you lose you're fighting to win oh Hallelujah Give me liberty or give me debt oh there is there not a cause oh Hallelujah yes it looks bleak yes it looks dark yes it looks like the enemy have every stronghold conquered but if there is a cause for Christ in this hour then brother that ought to be enough for us to take our swords of the spirits into our hands and walk firmly into the battlefield jealous and Reckless and Page oh God's got your back tonight oh stand up and fight the good fight of fate and wrestle wrestle meets a struggle struggle isn't that right but Brown talk about that airplane when they're going past the sound barrier that it's going start to take up speed but as it gets faster it starts to shake it starts to wrestle with the air it starts to wrestle praise God with the sound barrier that's around it because it's trying to get to a speed that is just beyond that sound barrier but in order to do that it has to get faster and as they get faster it rattles what about them said look like the airplane look like the wings might tear off of it look like all the nuts and Bulls shaking inside but keep on pressing keep on pressing you're almost there the sound barriers right there your present promises right there the Holy Ghost is right there what you're longing for what your thirsting for what you're Desiring for what you've been coming to church for all these years what you've been praying for what you've been looking for a mighty Revival to bring the backsliders to heal to save the loss that anointing is almost there tonight you've just got to wrestle on the point Hallelujah to see the victory ahead [Applause] so the condition of the world today is designed to bring out the struggle itself it's not right it's not right so the act of wrestling itself does not really ensure victory it's an opportunity for victory isn't it it's an opportunity for you to be victorious but it depends on how much you willing to put into the fight tattoo Victorious you'll be in the wrestle oh but there's gonna be a wrestle whether you like it or not whether you're ready or not there's gonna be a wrestle there's a wrestle going on in this message and the devil is fighting he is fighting to the nail oh Hallelujah he doesn't want that Holy Ghost he doesn't want that Jesus Christ coming back upon the Earth but there is a promise tonight and that's what fighting for there is a Bible tonight and that's what Python's for there's a prophetic message tonight that William Branham fought for he wrestled he wrestled to the point of suicide he wrestled at a point I'm almost given up but he said though he's flaming yet I trust him the Lord give and the Lord take it away and he kept wrestling and fighting and struggling and tonight what are you fighting for oh come on now you're gonna fight come on now where's your catch with your caption with your energy oh oh Hallelujah [Music] you gotta dig deep find that thing that keeps you alive in order to win the battle sometimes boxes at the end of their wit at the end of the energy at the end of their last their last weekend and somehow by some Merit they're behind on the points so they're losing already and they're against the ropes somehow some boxers have the unique ability to tap into an extra resource deep tongue inside a reason for survival a reason to win this match it had a guy one time he used to box for money and he used to do it and you know he enjoyed his sport and did it for money and stuff like that was cool he liked it he enjoy it he leave boxing after a while times got hard the 1930s depression kicked in in America and then he ended up on the bread line trying to feed his children then he got desperate when the friend come and tell him come and let me boxes for bunny he said yeah I need money he went out there and start the fight he started to fight and fight he was winning every match he bounced up a man who he used to fight before and he calls telling brother you fight this man already what is your problem he said boss he said coach there's not the same man this man thirsty this man hungry this man pray [Applause] praise God it was a difference and you've got to have a test tonight oh I thought for the supernatural I touched by the promise I touch my healing I touched with Deliverance I touched me I break through you're gonna be so thirsty you don't care if I lose an arm lose her legs but I've got to get to the Finish Line oh I see my promise in view oh Hallelujah glory to God that's the attitude amen that's that mental attitude that brought the prophet is talking about that right mental attitude it comes from a deep desire a deep call into a deep there's got to be a tip to respond in your heart you know there's a deep out there somewhere God didn't call me for nothing all these years I was a teenager oh Hallelujah but God met me he spoke to my heart spoke to my pen I could never be the same no more he's still the same God he was all those years ago he's still the same God tonight he still heals he still seals he still delivers he still restores he still baptizes with the Holy Ghost on Fire he is the same yesterday oh today and forever Great Is Our God tonight well do you believe it yeah man give him a shout out please oh feeling good now so listen closely to this language here listen closely to this Revelation 3 21 Bible says to him not overcome it well I Grant and sit with me in my truth even as I also overcame I must set down with my father in his room so that part I on the line there was to him that overcome it meaning this glorious victory that's being painted in the scripture by Jesus Christ himself he's saying it is to him that overcome it to him whosoever that is that is willing to break past that is willing to fight that is willing to press him do not overcome it will I grant to say to me my true oh Hallelujah him that is willing to pray him that is willing to sacrifice him that is willing to call upon God he that is willing to pray and to pass and to do all that he can do he or her whoever praise God is not right promise is to get enough him not overcome it okay let's take another scripture Joshua 14 12. this is Caleb Caleb says now therefore give me this mountain oh he's making his appeal right he said where of the Lord speak in that day in other words he has a revelation he knows that this mountain they're talking about is not a random Mountain but this is his Mountain this is the one Moses speak of oh Hallelujah I've got it written down praise God hallelujah I can quote it back where that Prophet said that this is my Mountain oh hallelujah hallelujah oh but I'm tired of having it on paper I want it in reality I wanted materialize I want my mountain [Applause] all right you hear the language all right good amen so he said where the Lord speak in our day for thou hood is that the anarchyms would oh my under the cities are great and fence but he's not worried about that he goes on he said if so be watch this now that the Lord will be with me then I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord had said oh honey in other words he's taken his confidence and God's ability to help him in his hour of need but he ain't afraid he is not scared tonight to go all the way up or up on his mountain and take what rightfully belongs to him he's already convinced of that oh hallelujah hallelujah oh Hallelujah and if the Lord be at me that I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord had said in other words there might be a risk factor here if the Lord is not with me I might make it Hallelujah by the will to pull it all on the line to know that he is with me and that I will be able to overcome Hallelujah I've got faith to believe that he didn't bring me out this power for me to walk around in the wilderness and die no no no no no I got Visions man I want to see my mountain man I want to build my house man pray come on now give me my Mountain that's the way you feel tonight then say Lord give me my Mountain give me my inheritance give me my promises I am will able to possess the land tonight tonight and kick Satan off my property oh give the Lord a shout out praise yeah hey man Glory Glory Hallelujah [Applause] you're going good that's the 4 16. here's the next one talking about Esther right she told him she said go gather all the Jews that are present in shushan and fast for me and neither eat or not drink these three days all night on a day so she said I also and my tomatoes were fast likewise it means we're all in the atmosphere now pray God we all believe in she said but so I will go in unto the King which is not according to the law there's a risk factor here she said if I perish I perish but I'm going in to see the King this is the only chance we have this is the only chance I've got and I'm taking it I'm taking it oh I'm going in I'm going in if I lose my life it doesn't matter I'm leaning on the line create personal sacrifice but oh god I've got to see the king [Applause] oh they're here tonight [Music] huh if I perish I die if I die die don't matter but I see something up the road I see Victory up the road and I'm willing to wrestle I'm willing to do what it takes to get my promise that's the attitude that I tonight in order to get it it's not right amen woman of the blood is you she was in the same boat sure life was on the line her blood was running out her money had already run out she wasn't gonna wait for more things to run out she had heard of a man called Jesus and she was willing to give that a try she was willing to give that one more chance she said if I if I could just Touch the Hem of His comments there's a risk factor here I may not make it I may not make it in time but I gotta try this is my one last chance this is my one last reviver I went to a meeting one night or my heart was right and I laid it all on the line oh Hallelujah glory to God amen it's not right so come back to Jacob you got a risk factor in the morning was going to be a different story in the morning it was going to be a different day if he didn't have this blessing if he didn't have this thing that he desired most but Obama said the very thing he was chasing all his life it's a thing to turn around and kill him in the end pray he was desperate he was looking oh Hallelujah for something he said Lord have got to wrestle and he met a man there the Bible says in the right and there he wrestled well and there he he

seconds of sin said you hate me now but you'll appreciate me when you get out there in the ring he said that was right that was right all right so here's another quote here amen just some inspiration tonight amen just encourage you preparation Prophet said here uh uh uh paragraph 46 said here not long ago I was in the west heard of an Indian that got converted said how are you feeling chief after a few days he said well pretty good pretty bad said what do you mean Prophet said pretty good we said what do you mean pretty good said well since I got saved said there's two dogs in me he said one's black and one's white and he said and they just fight all the time he said the black dog wants to do me bad and he's having a good dog wants me to do good or the white dog wants me to do good and stuff like that right he said so what's so the prophet asked him he said which one is going to win chief he said huh he said well depends on which one Chief feeds the most he said that's it the prophet said oh you've got to feed your faith tonight and starve your doubts feed your page and that thoughts get going to fighting it's not the size of the dog in a fight but it's the size of the fight that is in the talk oh Hallelujah tonight don't you worry if you've got a faith big enough for your promise let me tell you oh Hallelujah you'll hear me tonight if you got a fridge that's big enough to claim your promise they claim your healing to claim your deliverance oh other than you gonna get it you're going to receive it oh it's the size of the fight depends on which one you feed the most feed your faith in it if it's not right he said that's the thing he said that's the thing that's in your heart now the prophet said telling you that it is God's truth telling you that that is the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the way he said that's the thing that dog is inside of you fighting wrestling what is it he's telling you that that is God's truth that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the way of God preparation today is the holy spirit is a blood watch Church regenerated and filled with the Holy Ghost science and wonders and vindicating it proving that he is with it that thing that's telling you that he said feed it the prophet said feed it and I tell you tonight feed it feed your desire feed your thirst for the Holy Ghost be the authors for healing feel your thirst for deliverance beat it and see if that don't don't win oh Hallelujah thank you Glory oh glory amen that thing that's telling you that he said feed that he said a few minutes he said and you will be numbered with them that's right one of them one of them amen that's right amen go Glory Hallelujah okay another quote here I want to read here from time tested Memorials of God Amen some time ago the great Caesar Augusta after a great famous battle had won a great Victory and he they was going to give him a celebration in Rome right and he said to them he said I want some man to ride some worthy man to ride by my side while I'm doing this he said so they're having a celebration and he's looking for someone to ride with him in the celebration right he said so he's going wrong he said so I want some man to share this blessing with me and he said he went through the camps and all of the officers was trimmed with their plumes and Polished their swords and stuff making their armors real bright and everything practice standing straight and a certain salute to their King and so forth he said on each one walked up with their big armor before him and he settled down his throne watching and they come up an officer with his big fine plume just feather edge stood up made a salute Caesar shook his head walked away not that one right another one come up made a salute shook his head said no and he walked away Time After Time Prophet said soldier after Soldier keep coming and he got turned on right finally way down along the line come a little foot man he didn't have any Shield to polish neither did he have a plume to trim but he walked up in front of Caesar and he didn't even know how to make right a kind of a salute but he just bowed his head and walked away and Caesar said wait a minute who are you he said come back here he walked up there and he looked at him said there's scars over his face and cut he was disfigured and crippled up he said where you get all them scars at he said out there in the battle fighting for my Lord Caesar amen hallelujah Caesar said climb up here and sit down by my side he said you're the one that's been tested and proven oh hallelujah oh and I tell you Church you gotta have some Battle Scars to show that you've been in a fight that you've been in a war that's not a Wall of Shame whether you wear that like a badge of honor pray I've been through the mountain some to the waters some to the flood some two great trials but all through the blood battles card battle slain but I made it it is a testimony that Jesus was good to me oh I have a testimony of the goodness of God I've seen many battles fought many wars and in all of them it's a testimony of his grace I was out there fighting for my Lord Jesus Christ oh and every time he saved me and every time he redeemed me and every time he fill me with his love and power he is doing the same tonight if you are willing if you are willing hallelujah or to lay everything aside he'll be with you in a battle praise God Amen fighting for your lord Prophet said brother it is not bloom trimming time it's not educational days he said it's time testing time he said it's a time that God is testing his church to find the Battle Scars of hard trials and fights and battles he said that is the one who will ride by his side oh God don't want no potato peelers come on now God wants battles cards soldiers have you been baptized oh Hallelujah have you been to the river have you been to the mountain have you seen the Lord you've got to have a testimony not your friend's testimony not your neighbor not this one or that one but your personal trial oh you got to say he was with me when I fought the bear he was with me when I Fought The Lion and the god that delivered me from the bear the god that delivered me from The Lion he is well able to deliver into my hands into my hands this philistine oh come on now [Applause] oh come on now right at me praise God Amen oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right that's what it is okay praise God papa telling you know I think we ought to stop here and deal with the thought of God's people have always been and always will be persecuted he said you know that Genesis is a book of beginnings and what you find started there will carry on right to the Revelation and never change see and there we see that Cain persecuted killed Abel because the latter please God good meaning Abel right amen understand he said he said then we see a perfect picture in Abraham's son of the flesh Ismael Ishmael who teased and fought the son of Promise Isaac he said and there was Esau come back to our story here who hated Jacob and would have killed him had not caught intervened oh Hallelujah it come up persecution praise God but God had to intervene oh however but it took a wrestle it took a struggle to get to that point of intervention oh and Jacob knew he had everything on the line praise God hallelujah he knew the breaking of the day so Jacob had to play the long game break that Jacob had to wrestle every time Jacob feel weak he had to take another arm and lock the angel neck waiting to go in waiting to go in the day is coming the breaking of the day he know the angel can't stay so he's playing a long game he's trying to tie him out every time the angel tried to leave he locked his neck again every time the angel trying to leave he grappled it with his foot grappling with his leg grappling with his neck and not let you go I'll not let you go and that is how you get your promise that is how you get your portion that is how you get your inheritance it is not easy but it is worth it but there's a struggle you've got to fight you've got to press you got to fight you gotta press your way it's not gonna be easy but don't you worry God is with you oh he will back anyone up who is interested in this split right tonight oh oh they may be few and far between but they are Soldiers of Fortune Tonight Tonight You Are Soldiers of

Hallelujah however Jesus said I have water you know data and if you drink from this water if you drink from this Fountain you will never thirst again oh because it's the only thing that satisfies

Wednesday nights meet today man I said look I said hold a gospel song Amen wonderful he said in the New Testament we find that Judas betrayed Jesus while the religious orders of the first century attempted to destroy the early Believers so there's always been a struggle coming down all the line it's not right the prophet right and true history here showing at every Point there's been a struggle a battle and raging lives lost this gospel dripping with blood the Bible said they were in hunted they were hunted and persecuted in dense in caves destitute Afflicted some of them tormented some of them saunasunder some of them sworn in half isn't that right slain with the edge of the sword they wander wrong in sheepskins caught skins but these all having not attained but they were looking forward to something they were looking for a city whose pillar and make ours called oh God hadn't provided something better for us tonight we have been given something better for us tonight amen Brothers we have been given something better provided for us that day without us shall not be made perfect call to a prophet through hard trials to hard testing to persecution reveal us this pyramid to show us what we have to attain to show us what we are wrestling for or to be against Define with the Statue of a perfect man oh let this life of Jesus live in me as my prayer let feet live in me let you live in me knowledge living me Temperance living me oh don't he's slavy you gotta trust him let me walk up that hill let me Ascend to the hill of the Lord and stand in his holy place with Clean Hands and a pure heart oh Hallelujah presented blameless before him in love oh deeply rooted and grounded in the love of God that's how we want to be that's what the prophet fought for and by the grace of God that's what we're fighting for tonight the fight has not stopped it's only move on to another generation we've got to be the ones to take our mountain tonight to take our inheritance tonight to wrestle there all night long until the breaking of the day until the Dayton and the Daystar Rising our house Hallelujah perfection adoption that's what we're fighting for and we won't stop We Can't Stop not two billion Devils is not enough to stop us God predestined us to be perfect God predestinated us that the Holy Ghost and Fire God predestinated us to make our church in Trinidad that would make a Revival that people will come from miles around and say the seven tunnels that's not even written it's being made manifest all the seven tunnels striking striking a mechanic's word bringing it to life [Music] [Applause] oh I believe it on my heart Oh Glory Glory Glory oh hallelujah hallelujah I'm getting ready to close out I better close out I think the wood got home praise God I feel good tonight amen Hollywood wrestling wrestling with that word until we overcome do we come into it amen I just love it just like the same just like the Jew had to wrestle to become Israelite so to you oh you who the gospel was preached to you who by the sacrifice of Christ have been they joined heirs with him Hallelujah the main fellow heirs into the kingdom yet there's something we have to do there's a part we have to play in order to enter in because by one Spirit we are baptized into that party and that the kingdom of God is preached and every man have to press their way so that that Spirit could baptize you into himself you've got to have a desire a strong desire a thirst it's got to overwhelm you it's going to overcome you oh Hallelujah tell all you want all you need is a baptism of the Holy Ghost oh all you're looking for all your hopes all that is highest is a true baptism oh of the Holy Ghost whereas faith and put your knowledge Temperance praise God oh Hallelujah hey man that's what they're looking for amen amen hallelujah okay can I read this here oh Hallelujah the thing of it is I was saying last night the Prof the Pentecostals are waiting for a Russian right to win but they failed to hit a still Small Voice see that's what's wrong to do these things they think as long as the wind is rushing it's all right but that didn't attract The Prophet's attention rushing we never bothered the Elijah in the cave the mighty Thunder and Lightnings and things pouring down never attracted them at all but what's Title Here what caught his attention was that still Small Voice that's something speaking with inside with inside that my word is truth let every man's word be a lie I let mine be true see he said that's what attracted the prophets see he said and it'll still do it the word of God always attracts that spiritual mind because it's a mind of Christ in you that knows that that word is true another Prophet said then you go through a testing time he said and a church goes through a testing time each individual goes through a testing time before it can ever possess the Gate of the enemy you've got to go through a testing time a time of wrestling a time of fighting oh a victory seems uncertain but you've got a promise in your soul that you're holding on to and when everything else is stripped away when all your thoughts all your hopes all your cares are Stripped Away then one thing about desired David shared one thing about it is higher and that will I seek after Lord that I might dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord until quiet as temples because in a time of trouble in a time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in a secret place he saw hide me and he shall set me up upon a rock and now my head shall be lifted up above mine enemies because thou has made all of the Lord thy God thy habitation oh somebody give him a shot of praise tonight oh Hallelujah glory to God oh Hallelujah you could keep standing unfinished we could worship Christ went through it he said after Christ was filled the Holy Ghost he could place Them Softly he said after Christ was filled with the Holy Spirit there at the River Jordan Prophet said he went through a testing time after Abraham was called out put into his land where he was to be a pilgrim given a circumcision all that God met him time after time yet he had to go through a timer testing every seat of Abraham does the same thing Abraham and his seat and he said any organization a church that reason we find organization is failing because when it comes to the test what test he said God's word there's a test can you hold on can you believe oh I'll only believe oh how all things are possible hold to that word tonight there's a test he says God's word is the test will we do what a bunch of man says do or will we do what God says to he said that is the difference oh I'm finished so nice may
